        "content": "When we hear that \u201cBitcoin is too risky,\u201d as citizens of the U.S. and as holders of dollars we must remember that this simple statement comes from a position of substantial privilege, specifically \u201cexorbitant privilege.\u201d First termed by French Finance Minister Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing in the 1960s, exorbitant privilege refers to the unique benefits that the U.S. enjoys due to the widespread use of the dollar in international trade, finance and as a global reserve currency. Some of the benefits from the global ubiquity and near-insatiable demand for dollars are the U.S. government\u2019s ability to print dollars with minimal consequence and to borrow at lower interest rates than other countries, many with checkered financial pasts (like Argentina). Global reserve status also simplifies monetary policy decisions for the U.S., as the Federal Reserve is the de facto global central bank, setting the tone for other central banks to follow similar rate policies to defend their exchange rates. Or, as John Connally, President Richard Nixon's Treasury Secretary, bluntly put it to a group of European finance ministers: \u201cThe dollar is our currency, but it's your problem.\u201d"

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies rose Wednesday as investors continued to grapple with the market's summer doldrums and looked ahead to the Federal Reserve's annual meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Friday.\n\nBitcoin rose more than 2% to $26,517.09. The cryptocurrency has been hovering around the $26,000 level since breaking below it suddenly late last week and posted its worst week since May. Ether added more than 3% to trade at $1,684.20.\n\nBinance coin , the third-largest crypto asset by market cap excluding stablecoins, gained 4%. Tokens tied to ethereum competitors were up as well \u2014 Solana's coin jumped 6%, while Cardano's gained 5.5% and Polygon's rose 4%.\n\nThe crypto market move higher coincided with gains in the major stock averages. Crypto assets spiked more sharply around noon ET, though it's unclear what exactly could have caused the sharp move.\n\n\"You're probably going to see some wild moves up and down as bitcoin tries to march back to $30,000,\" said Callie Cox, analyst at investing firm eToro. \"Add in summer trading volumes, and you have a recipe for day-to-day volatility. Bitcoin prices have been more resilient today on hopes for lower rates, and a few hours of stable trading could have been enough to bring buyers back in.\"\n\nThe market has also been concerned in recent weeks that Fed Chair Jerome Powell could deliver a more hawkish speech about rate hikes this week at the central bank's meeting in Jackson Hole, which some say could be manifesting now in a sell-the-rumor, buy-the-news moment.\n\nCrypto has been suffering since the spring from low liquidity and thin trading volumes, which has exacerbated moves on both the upside and the downside. This has been especially true throughout the seasonally sleepy month of August.\n\n\"The correlation between equity indices and bitcoin has declined to near zero in 2023,\" said Sam Callahan, lead analyst at Swan Bitcoin. \"Bitcoin's price appears to be bouncing after a sharp sell off last week that was exacerbated by over $2.7 billion worth of liquidations of leveraged positions.\""

The increase comes on the heels of Bitcoin\u2019s worst week since November and crypto exchange FTX\u2019s collapse."

        "title": "Bitcoin back at US$26,500 as cryptos mirror Wall Street gains - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin rose on Thursday morning in Asia to trade in the US$26,500 range. The token logged its biggest one-day increase for the past six weeks on Wednesday, making up some of the losses from last week\u2019s nosedive. Ether also moved up to challenge the US$1,700 resistance level, while all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded higher. The rise across cryptocurrencies mirrored a rally in the U.S. equity market on Thursday. S&P Global\u2019s purchasing manager\u2019s index for August showed a slowdown in the U.S. economy, mitigating inflation and rate hike concerns.\n\nSolana\u2019s SOL led the crypto winners after Solana Pay announced a partnership with Shopify to allow USDC payments on the e-commerce platform. The Forkast 500 NFT index fell as OpenSea\u2019s decision to stop enforcing creator royalties continues to impact the market. Meanwhile, U.S. AI chipmaker Nvidia released a better-than-expected earnings report which drove a 6% rise in the firm\u2019s shares and a boost for U.S. equities.\n\nCryptos benefit from Wall Street gains\n\nBitcoin rose 2.23% in the last 24 hours to US$26,510.04 as of 07:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, but lost 8.11% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency reached a seven-day high of US$26,786.90 on Wednesday, a jump of over 3.7% from its daily low of US$25,806.99.\n\nThe rise in Bitcoin came on the back of a Wall Street rally. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite posted gains of more than 1% at close of trading Wednesday. That followed the release of S&P Global\u2019s flash U.S. Composite PMI index \u2014 a measurement of economic activity in both the manufacturing and service sectors.\n\nThe index showed that economic growth in August was close to stalling. Investors were hopeful that a slowdown in consumer spending could lead the U.S. Federal Reserve to pause its cycle of interest rate increases \u2014 good news for the crypto market playing out in today\u2019s price increases.\n\nCoinGlass data showed total Bitcoin liquidations at US$39.08 million over the past 24 hours. That included US$9.65 million of long positions \u2014 positions where investors bet the cryptocurrency price will rise.\n\nIt was the first time since August 20 that liquidations on Bitcoin short positions \u2014 which totaled US$29.43 \u2014 surpassed long position liquidations, indicating an improvement in investor sentiment.\n\nLike Bitcoin, Ether gained. It rose 3.04% to US$1,681.25 but was still down 7.06% over the past seven days.\n\nBitstamp, a Europe-based crypto exchange, revealed Wednesday it will stop providing Ether staking services to U.S. customers from September 25, citing \u201ccurrent regulatory dynamics\u201d in the country. The exchange previously announced it would suspend trades of seven cryptocurrencies declared securities by the U.S. Securitees and Exchange Commission (SEC) from August 27.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded higher over the past 24 hours. Solana\u2019s SOL token led the winners, jumping 5.35% to US$21.61. But it was still down 5.23% for the week.\n\nSolana Pay, a free-to-use payment protocol built on the Solana blockchain, announced a partnership with Canada-based e-commerce platform Shopify on Wednesday. The partnership will allow Solana Pay users to use USDC stablecoin for online shopping without intermediary fees. The protocol will also consider adding other payment options such as SOL and BOND in the future, TechCrunch reported on Wednesday.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization rebounded 2.53% to US$1.07 trillion. Trading volume rose 10.71% to US$35.37 billion.\n\nNFT market not at rock bottom yet\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 1.11% over the past 24 hours to 2,271.35 as of 10:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, down 7.48% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum and Cardano NFT indexes also logged losses, while the Solana and Polygon indexes moved up.\n\nThe Forkast 500 has posted a loss of 44.87% since the start of the year. But the index still has room to fall, Forkast Labs NFT strategist Yehudah Petscher said in a video posted to YouTube Wednesday.\n\n\u201cLast year from the start of the year to the end of the year, the market lost over 75% of its value, meaning we have much further to fall. Possibly a 30% (drop) or more,\u201d Petscher said.\n\nHowever, all is not lost, as rising transactions indicate the potential for industry growth.\n\n\u201cNFTs are dead? Someone\u2019s lying to you,\u201d Petscher tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cTotal sales are similar to early/mid 2021 levels, but the number of buyers/sellers are near 2022 levels. Transactions hit an all-time high too with 3,701,251 last week.\u201d\n\nNFTs are dead? Someone's lying to you.\n\n\n\nHere is the most important NFT chart that nobody's talking about yet.\n\n\n\nPrices are down but traders haven't left at all.\n\n\n\nTotal sales are similar to early/mid 2021 levels, but the number of buyers/sellers are near 2022 levels. Transactions\u2026 pic.twitter.com/firjqSxJiE \u2014 hudah.eth|tez (@Hudah_Idiot) August 23, 2023\n\nTotal NFT trading volume dropped 11.20% in the past 24 hours to US$12.92 million. Volumes on the Ethereum and Polygon blockchains dropped, while Solana, Bitcoin and Cardano volumes edged up, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\n\u201cOverall the OpenSea royalty policy is still having an impact on the market. Transactions have been declining, total sales are down and average sales price is up,\u201d said Petscher.\n\n\u201cThe higher average sales price lately indicates expensive NFTs being sold, but these are typically at a loss these days,\u201d he added.\n\nOpenSea, one of the world\u2019s leading NFT marketplaces, announced last week it would stop enforcing royalties \u2014 a major source of income for NFT creators \u2014 from Aug. 31.\n\nIn response to the OpenSea announcement, rival NFT marketplace Rarible said on Wednesday it will continue supporting royalties. It will also stop aggregating orders from the OpenSea, LooksRare and X2Y2 marketplaces, all of which have stopped enforcing royalties.\n\n\u201cDecentralization offers the opportunity to dispel the stigma of the \u2018starving artist,\u2019 and enable the continued growth of projects through true ownership and ongoing earnings,\u201d said Alex Salnikov, co-founder of Rarible, in a statement posted on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWe stand in solidarity with creators and artists. That\u2019s why we will no longer support marketplaces that neglect royalties,\u201d he added\n\nAfter the announcement, Rarible experienced a 310.85% surge in 24-hour trading volume to US$34,000 as of 11:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. That\u2019s still only a fraction of OpenSea\u2019s 24-hour volume of US$2.19 million \u2014 a 8.82% drop, according to DappRadar data.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it moves the needle one way or another, but now it\u2019s time for collectors and creators to put their money where their mouth is,\u201d said Petscher in Wednesday\u2019s YouTube video.\n\n\u201cIf creators feel strongly that royalties are necessary, they are gonna mint on Rarible, they are gonna partner with Rarible. And the same goes to collectors,\u201d he said.\n\nEthereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) topped the 24-hour sales volume for NFT collections. It fell 50.91%% in the past 24 hours to US$1.34 million. Mythos Chain-based DMarket and Ethereum-based Sorare placed second and third in the ranking.\n\nNvidia gives global equities a boost\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading higher as of 11:40 a.m. in Hong Kong with the tech-heavy Nasdaq posting a 1.30% gain. The three major U.S. indexes closed higher at the end of regular session trading Tuesday.\n\nMain stock indexes across Asia also went higher on Thursday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei all logged gains.\n\nFinancial intelligence corporation S&P Global released its flash U.S. composite PMI index on Wednesday. The index dropped from 52.0 in July to 50.4 in August \u2014 the weakest upturn in economic activities since February 2023.\n\n\u201cA near-stalling of business activity in August raises doubts over the strength of US economic growth in the third quarter,\u201d Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said in Wednesday\u2019s report.\n\n\u201cThe survey shows that the service sector-led acceleration of growth in the second quarter has faded, accompanied by a further fall in factory output,\u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, the flash composite PMI index in the euro zone fell from 48.6 in July to 47.0 in August. That\u2019s the lowest reading since November 2020, according to the Hamburg Commercial Bank on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIn reaction to the (PMI) data, government bond yields have fallen sharply across the board, including at the front end due to stronger expectations that the ECB and Fed are now more likely to keep rates unchanged,\u201d Mohamed A. El-Erian, an adviser to Germany-based financial services firm Allianz, tweeted on Wednesday.\n\nWeak PMIs, especially in #Europe, push yields lower and raise expectations of unchanged central bank policy rates:\n\nLed by #Germany, the #Eurozone's PMI fell to 47 (from 48.6) with, services (48.3) contracting for the first time this year while manufacturing (43.7) remained\u2026 \u2014 Mohamed A. El-Erian (@elerianm) August 23, 2023\n\nThe U.S. interest rate is now between 5.25% and 5.50%, the highest level in the past 22 years. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 13.5% chance for a 25-basis-point rate hike at the Fed\u2019s next meeting in September, down from 15% on Wednesday.\n\nTo receive further insights into the Fed\u2019s future monetary policies, investors await Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s opening speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday. Central bank leaders from across the world will attend the Fed-held annual summit.\n\nElsewhere, U.S. AI chipmaker Nvidia reported second-quarter revenue of US$13.51 billion on Wednesday, an annual jump of over 100%. The firm also forecast revenue of US$16 billion for the three months to the end of October, higher than the analysts\u2019 expectation of US$12.5 billion.\n\nThe share price of Nvidia closed 3.17% higher on Wednesday, and reached an all-time high of over US$517 in extended trading on Thursday morning in Asia.\n\n\u201c(Nvidia\u2019s results show) that betting on AI is paying off today,\u201d Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at financial website Investing.com, told Bloomberg. \u201cThis is a big deal because it validates the narrative that has been propping tech stocks in general this year.\u201d\n\nIn Asia, South Korea\u2019s central bank kept its base rate unchanged at 3.50% on Thursday. The country\u2019s annual inflation rate sits at a two-year low of 2.26%.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

The SOL token saw the biggest gain in the top 10, following its new partnership with e-commerce giant Shopify.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin falls below US$26,000 following Evergrande\u2019s bankruptcy\n\nSOL leads winners as Bitcoin, Ether rise with most top 10 cryptos\n\nSolana\u2019s SOL token rose 4.33% in the 24 hours to 4:30 in Hong Kong to US$20.79, as the day\u2019s biggest gainer in the top 10, after Solana announced partnering Shopify to offer crypto payments with no transaction fees on the e-commerce platform via Solana Pay, a peer-to-peer payments protocol built on the blockchain. Despite the good news, SOL remained near a six-week low.\n\n1xXOwDNYmLP2JEUlCHo5VVb3VZmh22uzK3R4jdRdglCkfh7MsIJ Umq sg qbr8WhQbM3ZSJU18REtsTFAUEITJ2UCVDwe378UujyTOBqSdnR04J966JFMQPiNpuLdeXg7jX 6XvFqriZBgZosXFPk\n\nBitcoin was little changed during afternoon trading in Asia, changing hands at US$26,430 as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong after it briefly rose to the US$26,769 mark earlier today.\n\nDespite today\u2019s small rally, Lucas Kiely, the chief investment officer of digital asset platform Yield App, said that returning to US$25,000 remained a possibility.\n\n\u201cUS$25,000 is the level where BlackRock filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF. There is support at that level. Investors will be spooked if Bitcoin falls below that level. After that level, Bitcoin could fall to approximately US$19,870, which represents the level where Silicon Valley Bank failed,\u201d wrote Kiely, in a statement shared with Forkast.\n\n\u201cWhen SVB failed, Bitcoin rocketed to US$31,000 before moving sideways. BlackRock and other firms then made their Bitcoin ETF announcements, and Bitcoin ripped again.\u201d\n\nEther rose 0.59% during afternoon trading in Asia to US$1,671 bringing its weekly losses to 6.92%.\n\nTron\u2019s (TRX) token rose 1.73% in the past 24 hours to US$0.077, bouncing back from a two-month low of US$0.073 on June 25.\n\nTotal crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours rose 1.45% to US$1.07 trillion while market volume decreased 8.66% to US$32.44 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nStory continues\n\nOpenSea\u2019s decision continues to weigh on NFT market\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index fell 1.12% to 2,272.28 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong and 7.43% in the past week.\n\n\u201cOverall the OpenSea royalty policy is still having an impact on the market. Transactions have been declining, total sales are down and average sales price is up,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs, referring to OpenSea\u2019s decision to cut creator royalty fees.\n\n\u201cThe higher average sales price lately indicates expensive NFTs being sold, but these are typically at a loss these days.\u201d\n\nBored Ape #8585 was sold for US$255,000 on Sunday, at a loss of over US$777,000 compared to its purchasing price of US$1.03 million a year ago.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour non-fungible token sales rose 1.63% to US$8.51 million, as sales for the largest Ethereum-based collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, rose 3.89% to US$1.64 million. Sorare sales also rose 17.3% to US$537,421, making it the third largest NFT collection across all chains by 24-hour sales volume. CryptoPunks sales also increased 25.51%.\n\nDraftKings, a Polygon-based NFT project, fell to become the seventh-largest collection across all chains after its 24-hour sales volume fell 25.97%. Polygon\u2019s 24-hour sales also declined 17.66%, while the Forkast POL NFT Composite was nearly flat for the day.\n\nInterest in Ordinals inscriptions also remained low, as 24-hour NFT sales on the Bitcoin network fell 12.04%.\n\nNvidia earnings boost U.S. stock futures, Asian equities\n\nImage: elements.envato\n\nMajor Asian equities rose as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong on Thursday, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index, the Shenzhen Component and the Shanghai Composite all posting gains.\n\nInvestors were optimistic after Chinese President Xi Jinping indicated in written remarks that the fundamentals of the Chinese economy remained strong despite minor headwinds at home and abroad.\n\nMost Major U.S. stock futures also rose for a third consecutive day, except the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures. The S&P 500 futures index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures both posted gains.\n\nNasdaq\u2019s gains received a boost from Nvidia share prices that gained over 3% after the chipmaker\u2019s earnings report showed that its data center revenue rising 171% year over year to US$10.32 billion.\n\nNvidia\u2019s earnings report also provided fuel for European equity markets, with Frankfurt\u2019s DAX 40 gaining 1% and the pan-European STOXX 600 inching up 0.9% on Thursday.\n\nOn the corporate front, investors are anticipating earnings reports from Intuit, the Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto Dominion Bank, NetEase and Marvell Technology, scheduled for later today.\n\nInvestors are also looking ahead to key speeches by U.S. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and ECB President Christine Lagarde at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday where central bank leaders will converge.\n\nSee related article: Singapore\u2019s Stablecoin framework, Australia\u2019s crypto landscape & Binance shuts \u2018Connect\u2019\n\nUpdates with equities"

Based on preliminary unaudited results, Bitcoin Depot announced that it expects consolidated revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, to range between $196 million and $198 million, a 17% to 18% improvement compared to $168 million in the second quarter of 2022.\n\nIn April, Jacksons Food Stores announced Bitcoin Depot was assuming a contract with the retailer. The agreement allows the crypto ATM company to install 80 Bitcoin ATMs (BTMs) throughout the c-store\u2019s network, according to a company press release.\n\n\"This partnership with Jacksons Food Stores, one of the larger convenience store chains in the U.S., further exemplifies Bitcoin Depot\u2019s leading market position and its ability to partner with key retailers in the convenience store industry that are looking for a reliable partner,\u201d Brandon Mintz, CEO and founder of Bitcoin Depot, said at the time.\n\nIn March, the BTM company partnered with GetGo Caf\u00e9+Market, with 270 locations across the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions, to install 125 devices in stores.\n\n\u201cCrypto ATMs require a very small footprint in terms of square footage and offer huge benefits. They attract paying customers, increasing potential revenue for any type of business willing to host them,\u201d said Scott Buchanon, COO of Bitcoin Depot.\n\nIn March, NACS Daily reported that overall the number of ATMs is shrinking. The number of machines in the U.S. peaked in 2019 at 470,000 but has since fallen to 451,500, according to research firm Euromonitor International.\n\nTo learn more about cryptocurrency, read \u201cDo You Crypto?\u201d from the October 2022 issue of NACS Magazine."

        "title": "Bitcoin gains traction in West Africa with educational drive - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) adoption in West Africa is dominated by Nigeria, the crypto powerhouse and the region\u2019s economic engine. But against a backdrop of anti-French sentiment, Bitcoin educational efforts are also bubbling away in French-speaking West Africa.\n\nSenegal recently opened its first physical Bitcoin exchange and education center called Bitique, and the country of 17 million people will host another Bitcoin Forum in the capital, Dakar, in December, where pseudonymous local Bitcoin advocate, known as Nourou, runs an independent Bitcoin node beamed from space.\n\nIn Benin, a country of 13 million people to the west of Nigeria, the Bitcoin-only Bitcoin Mastermind conference takes place next month. The first of its kind in the country, Bitcoin Mastermind unites Bitcoin entrepreneurs and crypto enthusiasts from homegrown groups and businesses such as Izichange, GoesPay and Flash, and it offers locals a space to learn about Bitcoin.\n\nCointelegraph spoke with Nourou, the founder of Dakar Bitcoin Days and Bitcoin Senegal, and Lo\u00efc Kassamoto, the founder of Bitcoin Mastermind, to better understand the Bitcoin and West African crypto evolution \u2014 or revolution.\n\nA rising tide lifts all boats\n\nCountries in French-speaking West Africa are subjected to the West African CFA franc currency, described by the Economist as a \u201ccolonial hangover.\u201d The Senegalese are vocal in their criticism of the currency, with some Bitcoin advocates, such as local crypto enthusiast and entrepreneur Mama Bitcoin, explaining that it\u2019s pretty normal to complain about the currency \u2014 an implicit criticism of post-colonial French policy in the region.\n\nAnti-French sentiment has historically existed in the region but has recently manifested in public demonstrations. Neighboring Mali recently dropped French as the nation\u2019s official language \u2014 a law in place since the country won its independence in 1960.\n\nIn Niger, to the east of Mali and north of Nigeria, a recent military coup represented a significant setback for French President Emmanuel Macron and France\u2019s military strategy in the region. Well-known French newspaper Le Monde commented that the coup was a \u201cnew heavy blow\u201d for France\u2019s military strategy in Niger\u2019s Sahel region.\n\nA groundswell of alternative currency initiatives is occurring across French-speaking West Africa. Growing numbers of Senegalese are turning to Bitcoin as a savings tool and a means of exchange, while in Benin, Bitcoin Mastermind\u2019s Kassamoto told Cointelegraph the number of Beninois turning to Bitcoin is also on the up.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin in Senegal: Why is this African country using BTC?\n\nIn the West, much financial discussion and education tends to take place online. However, the emphasis in West African countries is on physical meetups and real-life interaction. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Nourou said that discussions about Bitcoin and money were transferred and confined to online platforms such as ClubHouse and X (formerly Twitter), but more and more physical spaces have opened up post-pandemic.\n\nNourou opens Bitique in the Dakar business district. Source: Nourou\n\nIndeed, as Kassamoto explains, one of the keys to unlocking deeper levels of financial education and demonstrating how West Africans could use a decentralized currency such as Bitcoin is through interactions in the real world:\n\n\u201cBitcoin conferences, meetups and shops provide opportunities for education, outreach and direct interaction. Conferences and meetups bring the community together, share knowledge and exchange experiences.\u201d\n\nNorou opened Bitique, which is Dakar\u2019s first physical Bitcoin store for buying and selling cryptocurrency. He explained that in addition to trading services, there will also be educational programs for people to learn about Bitcoin in person: \u201cTraining courses will be around 10,000 francs [$16] for two or even three hours of training.\u201d\n\nThe in-person training goes hand in hand with a series of classroom sessions that Bitcoin Senegal conducts nationwide called the \u201cBaol Digital Kids\u201d program, which teaches kids how to use Bitcoin and the Lightning Network.\n\n@SeckIdrissa, un membre actif de notre communaut\u00e9, vient d'animer une session de sensibilisation sur la th\u00e9matique Bitcoin/cryptomonnaies \u00e0 de jeunes enfants, lors du \"Baol Digital Kids\" organis\u00e9 par @xaralatech.\n\nUne initiative \u00e0 encourager et \u00e0 soutenir pic.twitter.com/aX4u9kVFoz \u2014 \u20bfitcoin S\u00e9n\u00e9gal (@bitcoin_sen) August 11, 2023\n\nThe kids in the video who received and sent their first satoshis via the layer-2 Lightning Network can spend the money at a growing number of merchants listed on the open-source Bitcoin tool BTCmap.org. In just 18 months, Dakar has developed from one small Bitcoin office to tens of artisans, restaurants and caf\u00e9s accepting the cryptocurrency.\n\nNourou recently received a Blockstream Satellite kit, which, once set up, will allow him to run a Bitcoin node that will be protected against network interruptions. The internet service can sometimes be patchy and unreliable in West Africa. According to Blockstream, the satellite kit ensures that any connected Bitcoin full node \u201cwill not be isolated or partitioned,\u201d with blocks streaming continuously for the node to verify.\n\nAcross a few borders in Benin, Kassamoto, along with his peers, runs what he believes to be one of Benin\u2019s first Bitcoin nodes.\n\n8GB of Ram and using the Ubuntu process from Umbrel and bim we became probably one of the first to run a Bitcoin node in Benin\n\n\n\nWe'll share more experience about this soon. \u2014 Lo\u00efc Kassamoto (@Loicbtc) January 24, 2023\n\nHe explains that Bitcoin adoption has increased, but it comes with risks due to its association with crypto:\n\n\u201cBitcoin adoption in West Africa is greatly helped and hindered by cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nKassamoto said that the money-making side of crypto attracts more and more people into the \u201ccrypto universe,\u201d but crypto scams, loss and rug pulls taint Bitcoin\u2019s appeal. The promise of crypto riches drawing noobies into Bitcoin is not necessarily good.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s toxic for Bitcoin because these people are very quickly disappointed with their loss and associate it with Bitcoin because they haven\u2019t even had time to understand the difference between the two,\u201d he said.\n\nKassamoto said that \u201cBitcoin, not crypto,\u201d is what the West African community should understand.\n\nThere are more Bitcoin meetups and, therefore, more opportunities to demonstrate what many Bitcoin exchanges and thought leaders have preached for some time: that there could be a difference between Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market.\n\nRelated: Worldcoin cryptocurrency project suspended in Kenya\n\nThe Central African Republic, which made headlines in 2022 for adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, was elevated and then dropped by large swathes of the Bitcoin community. After adopting Bitcoin, it announced its own crypto token, Sango Coin, while the country is now experimenting with tokenizing real-world assets such as farmland.\n\nIn Ghana, to the east of Benin, another large Bitcoin and educational conference will occur this year. Strike CEO Jack Mallers and Human Rights Foundation chief strategy officer Alex Gladstein will speak as part of a Bitcoin educational drive in West Africa.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space."

        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market value, dropped just below the $26,000 mark on Wednesday after trading in a tight range over the past 24 hours and hitting a weekly low of $25,500. The cryptocurrency rebounded slightly from the low, but remains down 9% over the last seven days as markets await developments from the central bankers\u2019 meeting at Jackson Hole on Friday. \u201cIt is possible that any semblance of dovishness from Jay Powell on Friday could help inspire a recovery. Beyond that, we also have a potential ruling in the Grayscale case to look forward to,\" Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat, wrote in a note. Farrell said he thinks the market is closer to a local bottom rather than top, given the absence of industry-specific catalysts and a decline in liquidity."

        "content": "Bitcoin fell Wednesday morning in Asia to trade below US$26,000. Ether also dropped to near the US$1,600 support level as all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded flat to lower. Solana\u2019s SOL led the losers. The Forkast 500 NFT index declined, while a former manager at NFT marketplace OpenSea received jail time for insider trading. U.S. stock futures edged higher after Wall Street closed mixed on Tuesday. S&P Global Ratings joined the Moody\u2019s ratings agency in downgrading a number of U.S. banks.\n\nNew Bitcoin support level at US$25,000?\n\nBitcoin dipped 0.71% in the last 24 hours to US$25,946.61 as of 07:20 a.m. in Hong Kong and lost 11.05% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency has been trading around the US$26,000 mark this week following a near 10% slide last Friday. But it reached a 24-hour low of US$25,520.73 on early Wednesday morning.\n\nAfter the previous week\u2019s nosedive, some crypto analysts are predicting further losses. Social media commentator Ali Martinez put the token\u2019s new key support level at US$25,400. Keith Alan, co-founder of analytics firm Material Indicators, put it as low as US$25,000. Both Martinez and Alan said losing the key support level could drive the token to a new low in the US$20,000 range.\n\n\u201cBitcoin prices falling below a US$25,000 support level could be considered a bearish indicator, from a technical perspective, as it may signal a general uptrend reversal,\u201d Wade Guenther, partner at U.S.-based asset management firm Wilshire Phoenix, said in an emailed comment.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s technical indicators including the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) suggest the token\u2019s price could be oversold.\n\n\u201cThe 50-day moving average (MA) has begun to sharply diverge towards the 200-day MA. Generally, it could be considered a bearish signal if the 50-day MA crosses below the 200-day MA,\u201d added Guenther.\n\nOn the regulatory front, investors await a much-anticipated verdict in the lawsuit between Grayscale Investments and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Grayscale has applied for permission from the regulator to convert its Bitcoin trust product (GBTC) to a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). However, the decision was delayed twice last week.\n\nThat delay added to the delays of other Bitcoin applications. On Aug. 11 the SEC delayed its decision on the ETF application submitted by Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest.\n\nElsewhere, decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Balancer reported Tuesday that it had detected a vulnerability affecting several of its liquidity pools.\n\nBalancer has received a critical vulnerability report affecting a number of V2 Pools.\n\n\n\nEmergency mitigation procedures have been executed to secure a majority of TVL, but some funds remain at risk.\n\n\n\nUsers are advised to withdraw affected LPs immediately.https://t.co/PDzX32gqeS pic.twitter.com/F1f649Wz3L \u2014 Balancer (@Balancer) August 22, 2023\n\nThe company said it has introduced \u201cemergency mitigation procedures\u201d to secure user assets. An update on early Wednesday showed 1.4% of the total value locked (TVL) on Balancer was still at risk. That would amount to US$9.19 million, according to data from DefiLlama.\n\nLike Bitcoin, Ether posted losses. It fell 2.20% to US$1,631.18 for a 10.75% decline over the past seven days.\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded lower over the past 24 hours. The exceptions included Tron\u2019s TRX, which logged a gain of 0.20%. Solana\u2019s SOL token led the losers, dropping 3.35% to US$20.54 and 13.78% for the week.\n\nBinance\u2019s BNB token also posted losses. It dropped to a 14-month low of US$204.40 on early Wednesday evening after a Wall Street Journal report said the world\u2019s leading crypto exchange helped Russian entities move money abroad after Russia invaded Ukraine \u2014 a violation of international sanctions. The company denied the claim, saying it follows global sanction rules on Russia.\n\nThe report could prove damaging given Binance\u2019s mounting regulatory challenges. The SEC sued the company in June for alleged securities violations.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization creeped closer to the psychologically important US$1 trillion level, dropping 1.46% in the past 24 hours to US$1.04 trillion. Trading volume rose 8.88% to US$31.95 billion.\n\nEx-OpenSea exec sentenced to jail for insider trading\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.59% in the past 24 hours to 2,300.54 as of 10:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, falling 7.08% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum, Solana and Cardano NFT indexes also logged losses, while the Polygon index remained flat.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume rose 21.95% in the past 24 hours to US$15.22 million. Volumes on the Ethereum, Solana and Polygon blockchains logged increases, while Bitcoin and Cardano volumes dropped, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nWith the average NFT sales price at US$36.11 \u2014 down over 50% from the start of July \u2014 NFT sellers posted a net loss of US$2.14 million in Tuesday\u2019s trading.\n\n\u201c(We are seeing) a continued loss of value across blockchains,\u201d Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs, said in a YouTube video posted Tuesday.\n\n\u201cTotal transactions and average sales price (on Monday) both almost a mirror image of Sunday, so you can see we are kind of stagnant right now,\u201d\n\nEthereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) topped the 24-hour sales volume for NFT collections. It rose 83.68% in the past 24 hours to US$3.01 million. Mythos Chain-based DMarket and Ethereum-based Mutant Ape Yacht Club placed second and third in the ranking.\n\nNathaniel Chastain, a former product manager at NFT marketplace OpenSea, was sentenced by a U.S. district court to three months in jail Tuesday for insider trading. He was found guilty of fraud and money laundering in May for using confidential information about the platform to profit from NFT trades.\n\nChastain\u2019s case was the first-ever insider-trading case in the U.S. to involve digital assets. The former OpenSea executive bought and sold NFTs he knew would feature on OpenSea\u2019s homepage and would, as a result, rise in price. The court found that he made over US$57,000 in profit from the trades.\n\nOpenSea itself is under fire for its announcement last week that it will stop enforcing creator royalties from August 31. The platform will still charge a 2.5% marketplace fee for all transactions.\n\nOpenSea\u2019s decision received widespread criticism. Mark Cuban \u2014 a U.S. entrepreneur and investor in OpenSea \u2014 said the move is a \u201chuge mistake\u201d that \u201cdiminished trust in the platform and hurts the (NFT) industry.\u201d\n\nYuga Labs, the creator of hit NFT collection BAYC, said it would gradually wind down its presence on the OpenSea marketplace following the announcement. Given the significance of BAYC to the overall NFT market, that could spell bad news for OpenSea.\n\n\u201cYuga\u2019s 30-day volume is 80% the size of OpenSea\u2019s. This is the leverage that IP has over NFT Marketplaces,\u201d Trevor Owens, chief executive officer at NFT intelligence platform Ninjalerts, tweeted on Saturday.\n\nYuga's 30d volume is 80% the size of OpenSea's\n\n\n\nThis is the leverage that IP has over NFT Marketplaces\n\n\n\nThe NFT Marketplaces are dead without the most important IP\n\n\n\nWill this lead to walled garden marketplaces by IP owners? That's much more complicated, so I'm not sure.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/FHdWG99q07 \u2014 trevor.btc (@TO) August 19, 2023\n\nElsewhere, Web3 social media application Friend.tech renamed its \u201cshares\u201d to \u201ckeys\u201d on Tuesday. Some analysts said the platform \u2014 which allows users to buy and trade the so-called \u201ckeys\u201d to unlock gated Telegram-like chat rooms and other privileges \u2014 acted to avoid potential legal problems amid a spate of lawsuits brought by the SEC against digital asset firms.\n\nThe switch from \u201cshares\u201d to \u201ckeys\u201d was \u201cprobably to get around being called a security,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nThe question of whether digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and NFTs are securities is the source of much of the legal debate surrounding the industry.\n\nS&P joins Moody\u2019s in downgrading US banks\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading higher as of 12:30 p.m. in Hong Kong. The three major U.S. indexes closed mixed at the end of regular session trading Tuesday, with the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average logging losses and the Nasdaq Composite edging higher.\n\nMain stock indexes across Asia were mixed on Tuesday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index and South Korea\u2019s Kospi dropped, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng and Japan\u2019s Nikkei moved higher.\n\nU.S. bank shares dropped Tuesday after financial intelligence corporation S&P Global downgraded the credit ratings of five U.S. banks on Monday citing \u201ctough operating conditions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile many measures of asset quality still look benign, higher rates are pressuring borrowers,\u201d S&P wrote in a report viewed by Bloomberg. \u201cBanks with material exposures to commercial real estate, especially in office loans, could see some of the greatest strains.\u201d\n\nThe news followed a similar downgrade on ten banks by ratings firm Moody\u2019s Investors Service two weeks earlier.\n\nDespite concerns in the banking sector, U.S. stock futures rose as investors await Nvidia\u2019s second-quarter earning release on Wednesday. Analysts expect the AI chipmaker\u2019s revenue to surpass its own forecast from three months ago. The company\u2019s shares hit an all-time high of US$481.87 on Tuesday, but ended the day 2.77% down for the day.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will give the opening speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday. The Fed-held annual summit will be attended by central bank leaders from across the world. Powell\u2019s speech could provide insights into the Fed\u2019s future monetary policy.\n\nJuly\u2019s strong U.S. economic data indicated that \u201cthe reacceleration scenario has come onto the table in a way that it really wasn\u2019t three or four months ago,\u201d Richmond Federal Reserve President Thomas Barkin told Reuters Tuesday. That could influence the Fed\u2019s thinking on interest rates, he added.\n\nPowell \u201cis unlikely to give direction on September, but he is likely to hint at elevated rates for longer to ensure that inflation has come down,\u201d analysts at Canadian investment bank TD Securities told Reuters.\n\nThe U.S. interest rate is now between 5.25% and 5.50%, the highest level in the past 22 years. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 15% chance for a 25-basis-point rate hike at the Fed\u2019s next meeting in September, down from 15.5% on Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile in China, the country\u2019s technology giant Baidu Inc. reported larger-than-expected annual revenue growth of 15% in its second-quarter earnings report released Tuesday. That figure is the company\u2019s largest recorded increase in more than a year. The corporation is building itself into a leader in A.I. technology and introduced its latest generative A.I. model \u2014 Ernie 3.5 \u2014 in June 2023.\n\n\u201cGenerative AI and large language models hold immense transformative power in numerous industries, presenting a significant market opportunity for us,\u201d Robin Li, co-founder and CEO of Baidu, said in a Tuesday press release.\n\n\u201cBy adopting an AI-native mindset, we are reinventing our products and offerings for innovative experiences, and to support various enterprises to capture this opportunity,\u201d Li added.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "title": "The future of BTC mining and the Bitcoin halving - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "On the latest episode of Cointelegraph\u2019s Market Talks, host Ray Salmond spoke with Dan Rosen, associate director of derivatives at Luxor, a United States-based Bitcoin (BTC) mining pool, research hub and service provider.\n\nThe show touched on a number of broad topics, including Rosen\u2019s view on how the upcoming Bitcoin halving will impact BTC price, why Bitcoin\u2019s volatility is set to remain in the double-digits for years to come, and miners\u2019 ability to hedge their operations via hash rate derivatives.\n\nAccording to Rosen:\n\n\u201cAny maturing asset goes through experiences of high volatility when it first launches, and if you compare Bitcoin to the tech stocks of the early 90s, like Apple and Google, their volatility was astronomical. Bitcoin has also touched crazy high levels of volatility in the 70% to 100% [range] four years ago. This is dropping over time, but we will continue to see this trend as the asset becomes more investable and the eventual launch of an ETF [exchange-traded fund]. One day, we are likely to see a 20% or sub-20% annualized asset class, in maybe four or five years.\u201d\n\nHistorically, outside of pledging mined Bitcoin rewards, miners have had few options for hedging risk within their operations. Luxor\u2019s hash rate derivatives essentially add infrastructure to this area of the industry by allowing miners to hedge their exposure to changes in hashprice. The derivatives give miners the option to predict and lock in future revenue during events of unexpected volatility that impact the efficiency of their operations.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin difficulty jumps 6% to new peak as miners ignore BTC price dip\n\nMacro continues to impact Bitcoin\u2019s price and miners\n\nRegarding the macro and how this could impact Bitcoin\u2019s price and its miners, Rosen said, \u201cThe market is starting to realize that we\u2019re probably not going to get to that 2% inflation target rate any time soon, and it does appear that the market is starting to price in that inflation longer-term will hover around the 2.5% to 3% range. At the same time, we\u2019re still seeing the U.S. dollar as a flight-to-safety asset, and this is impacting equities and creating macro headwinds at the same time, leading to a depreciated value of dollar-denominated assets.\u201d\n\nDespite this dismal economic outlook, Rosen believes:\n\n\u201cWhile Bitcoin price might not hit six figures leading into the halving or directly after it, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see new lows over the next six months due to macro headwinds and then a stronger rally afterward.\u201d\n\nListen to the full episode of Market Talks on the new Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel, and don\u2019t forget to click \u201cLike\u201d and \u201cSubscribe\u201d to keep up-to-date with all our latest content."

And with no liquidity issues or heightened volatility indicated, did the 11.4% mid-August price drop worsen conditions due to the largest futures liquidations since November 2022?\n\nBitcoin futures premium settled at a neutral 6% after the recent $26,000 crash, signaling balanced demand between leveraged longs and shorts. This aligns with a neutral -7% to 7% BTC options skew, suggesting reasonable downside protection prices.\n\nReviewing another article, Pechman discusses macroeconomic analyst Lyn Alden\u2019s take on a common currency proposal among BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa).

        "title": "How to put words into a Bitcoin address? Here's how vanity addresses work - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Have you ever wondered whether a Bitcoin (BTC) address \u2014 or a string of 26\u201335 alphanumeric characters \u2014 can happen to have human-readable words instead of random letters?\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard of the Lightning Network, which allows you to create a fancy BTC address that looks like an email or a web domain. But there\u2019s also a way of creating Bitcoin addresses containing human-readable words on the original Bitcoin blockchain. Such addresses are known as vanity Bitcoin addresses.\n\nWhat is a vanity Bitcoin address?\n\nA vanity Bitcoin address is a personalized BTC address that contains a specific pattern or word in a part of its total 26-35 character string of letters and numbers. Unlike a usual Bitcoin address \u2014 which is made of random characters \u2014 a vanity Bitcoin address allows users to customize their addresses or even send a specific message just within the address.\n\nThe term \u201cvanity address\u201d comes from the plain meaning of the word \u201cvanity,\u201d which is used to express inflated pride in oneself or one\u2019s appearance. In line with the direct meaning, vanity addresses are used by those who want to stand out and give their wallet address a unique identity.\n\nVanity Bitcoin addresses became popular a few years after the anonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto launched the cryptocurrency back in 2009. The first vanity address generator, called \u201cVanityGen,\u201d was released as an open-source platform on GitHub in 2012. One of the first references to vanity addresses on Bitcointalk.org \u2014 a major crypto forum created by Nakamoto \u2014 goes back to 2013.\n\nAccording to Trezor\u2019s Bitcoin analyst Josef Tetek, Nakamoto didn\u2019t use vanity addresses: \u201cHe disappeared from the public before vanity addresses became popular,\u201d Tetek told Cointelegraph, referring to Nakamoto\u2019s vanishing in 2011.\n\nBesides the Bitcoin blockchain, vanity addresses are also available on other networks, including the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike Bitcoin vanity addresses, which allow users to choose among 26\u201335 alphanumeric characters, Ethereum vanity addresses only feature hexadecimal numbers, as Ether (ETH) addresses can only include letters \u201cA\u201d through \u201cF\u201d and numbers zero through nine.\n\nAccording to the ETH Optimism vanity address generator, creating an Ethereum vanity address starting with \u201c0xFad69\u201d would take up to five minutes.\n\nHow to create a Bitcoin vanity address?\n\nThere are two ways of creating a vanity BTC address: manually and using specialized vanity address generator services. The first method relies on software and requires some computing power and coding skills to run programs to find Bitcoin addresses starting with a specific word combination.\n\nMany Bitcoin experts like Trezor\u2019s Tetek agree that the first method is the most secure way of creating a vanity Bitcoin address, as this method allows users to keep their seed phrase private. Being the only owner of a private key or a seed phrase enables the user to be the sole holder of the funds associated with the address.\n\nThe manual method requires installing vanity address-generating software like VanityGen, which is available on the cloud-based software website GitHub. Running such software requires certain computing power specs, with larger sequences of symbols demanding more time to create a vanity address.\n\nVarious sources estimate that generating a vanity address containing a five-symbol word takes about one hour using a regular personal computer, while larger sequences like seven symbols could take up to three months. More sophisticated setups involving powerful graphic cards or even application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips can significantly reduce the time needed to generate a vanity address.\n\nThe second method of creating a vanity address is more straightforward but less secure as it relies on delegating the address search to third-party services, also known as \u201cvanity address miners.\u201d\n\nReliance on Bitcoin vanity services is associated with major risks, as miners can potentially take over the address and its assets at any time. That is because such miners are the first to receive the private key before passing it to the customer. The private key is generated at the moment of creating a Bitcoin address and cannot be changed afterward.\n\nThe vanity generation service is often offered via websites like Vanitygen.net, allowing users to simply order a certain desired word or sequence to be searched with computing power bought online. Such services often allow users to order a sequence of letters up to eight symbols. Once generated, the private key for the vanity address is sent to the customer\u2019s email in exchange for the agreed price.\n\nFor example, generating a Bitcoin vanity address starting with \u201c1Satoshi\u2026\u201d would cost around 0.0217 BTC, worth around $600 at the time of writing. Larger sequences like \u201c1Nakamoto\u2026\u201d would require at least 0.11 BTC, or as much as $3,250.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that not all letters and numbers can be included in a vanity Bitcoin address, just like a normal BTC address. Some letters, like the uppercase letter for \u201cO,\u201d the uppercase letter for \u201cI,\u201d the lowercase letter for \u201cL,\u201d and the number \u201c0,\u201d are excluded from the set of 26\u201335 alphanumeric characters available in all Bitcoin addresses. The exclusions aim to help users avoid confusion when sending funds on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe risks of using a Bitcoin vanity address\n\nA decision on whether or not to use a Bitcoin vanity address ultimately depends on the reasons for having such an address in the first place, taking into account all possible risks. Some cryptocurrency exchanges like BitMEX have experimented with vanity addresses using the native Segregated Witness (SegWit) address format Bech32 with the \u201cbc1qmex\u2026\u201d prefix.\n\nA spokesperson for BitMEX told Cointelegraph that most vanity addresses are used for marketing or considered \u201ca bit of fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin vanity addresses were quite popular on BitcoinTalk circa 2011, when many solicited donations to their personal vanity address, for example, 1Name,\u201d the BitMEX\u2019s representative noted, adding:\n\n\u201cIn the days before structured proof of reserves systems, the exchange-wide use of vanity addresses gave a way for users to informally sum up the reserves of an exchange.\u201d\n\nThe firm also attempted to use vanity addresses to make it harder for attackers to scam users since BitMEX only gave vanity addresses to users. However, one should not rely on vanity addresses as a security mechanism, as more advanced attackers could manage to copy the vanity address format, the representative noted.\n\nBitMEX\u2019s spokesperson says vanity addresses are best suited for advanced users: \u201cThe main weakness for individual users is reduced privacy. In general, we would advise users not to reuse addresses at all,\u201d adding that newer BitMEX customer addresses no longer feature a vanity prefix.\n\nTrezor\u2019s Bitcoin expert Tetek strongly advised against using vanity addresses because such addresses \u2014 even if generated in a secure manner \u2014 promote address reuse, which is a bad practice in terms of privacy. He said:\n\n\u201cIf a Bitcoin address is used more than once, other people can easily track the receiving and spending habits of a person. It is, therefore, also easier to identify the owner of the address.\u201d\n\nBesides privacy and asset safety risks, vanity BTC addresses are also associated with security vulnerabilities. In 2022, hackers managed to steal $3.3 million in crypto through a vulnerability in Ethereum vanity address-generating tool Profanity. Additionally, in March 2023, attackers also used hacked vanity addresses to steal $500,000 worth of tokens from layer-2 scaling solution Arbitrum\u2019s airdrop.\n\nThe future of Bitcoin vanity addresses\n\nDespite Bitcoin vanity addresses becoming much less popular since 2011, there is no evidence that such addresses have not been used in recent years.\n\nOne report recently described the use of a Bitcoin vanity address containing swearing words apparently directed toward Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin. The address has transacted a total of 0.29 BTC ($7,595) in 67 transactions between 2018 and 2020, turning its balance to zero.\n\nOne of its last recorded transactions included a 0.0004 BTC ($10) transaction to the public Bitcoin address of famous Bitcoin critic Warren Buffet, who was given a BTC address and a gift from Tron founder Justin Sun.\n\nMoreover, challenges and considerations persist. For instance, the security risks linked to vanity address generators must be addressed, prompting the development of more secure and user-friendly tools. Vanity address creation could become more streamlined and available to a wider audience, not just those with coding expertise, as blockchain systems develop and incorporate new features.\n\nHowever, the privacy issues raised by the reuse of addresses will remain a crucial consideration. Therefore, users who want personalized addresses must balance the advantages of uniqueness against possible privacy breaches.\n\nWhile it\u2019s important to understand that Bitcoin vanity addresses are quite risky and expensive, such addresses apparently unlock some new and maybe weird use cases of the cryptocurrency. With that in mind, it\u2019s up to Bitcoin users whether the future of Bitcoin vanity addresses is bright or not.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space."

        "title": "Bitcoin ETF Approval: Potential Impact on Mainstream Adoption - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "The financial world is buzzing with excitement as regulators evaluate whether to approve a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). This potential watershed moment has spurred widespread debate regarding the consequences for Bitcoin's mainstream adoption and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole.\n\nAn ETF could act as a link between traditional finance and the digital asset area, possibly changing the investment and adoption environment. We explore the subtleties of Bitcoin ETF approval and considers the potential implications on the cryptocurrency sector.\n\nA Game-Changer in the Bitcoin ETF Landscape\n\nAn ETF is a financial vehicle that tracks the price of an underlying asset, giving investors exposure to it without directly owning it. A Bitcoin ETF, like a standard stock, would allow investors to obtain exposure to Bitcoin's price swings through their existing brokerage accounts.\n\nFor several years, the concept of a Bitcoin ETF has been a hot topic, with various proposals presented to regulatory authorities. A Bitcoin ETF might offer institutional and ordinary investors a regulated and familiar entry point into the bitcoin market, thereby lowering entry barriers and enhancing accessibility.\n\nWall Street's Pursuit of Bitcoin ETF: Transforming Investment Landscape\n\nThe allure of a Bitcoin ETF is captivating Bitcoin investors as Wall Street's giants vie for regulatory approval. Amidst Bitcoin's price stagnation, major financial players like BlackRock and others are seeking to introduce a Bitcoin ETF, aiming to revolutionize accessibility and sentiment around the cryptocurrency.\n\nBlackRock's recent filing to launch the \"Black Bitcoin Trust\" ETF underscores this transformative trend. As other industry titans like Fidelity and Ark join the race, the prospect of a Bitcoin ETF holds promise as a mainstream investment avenue, echoing the democratization impact seen with gold ETFs.\n\nA Bitcoin spot ETF, allowing indirect ownership via ETF shares, is a concept gaining momentum. While not entirely new, its potential to reshape how Wall Street approaches Bitcoin is significant. Currently, American investors have Futures ETFs, but a spot ETF would entail asset managers holding Bitcoin equivalent to the ETF's value, potentially sparking institutional demand.\n\nHowever, regulatory hurdles loom. The SEC's prior concerns about market manipulation and surveillance sharing have led to ETF application rejections. Notably, BlackRock and others are working to address these apprehensions through partnerships and agreements.\n\nShould a Bitcoin spot ETF gain approval, the implications are substantial. Institutional investors may find this a safer entry point, potentially triggering increased Bitcoin demand. Coupled with the prospect of integrating Bitcoin into retirement portfolios, this could foster notable market cap growth.\n\nA Potential Paradigm Shift\n\nThe approval of a Bitcoin ETF is a watershed point in the evolution of the cryptocurrency sector. The possible impact of such permission is varied, and it could have an impact on a variety of factors of popular adoption:\n\nEase of Access and Familiarity: The establishment of a Bitcoin ETF could open doors for investors who are apprehensive to participate directly in the cryptocurrency market. ETFs could bridge the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset universe by providing exposure through familiar investment mechanisms. This could entice a broader range of investors, including individuals who have been hesitant to invest due to perceived difficulties or uncertainties. Institutional Participation: Institutional investors have been examining the cryptocurrency industry with caution, looking for legislative clarity and well-established frameworks. A Bitcoin ETF might provide the regulatory control and legitimacy that institutions are looking for, potentially leading to increased institutional engagement in the market. This injection of institutional funding may help to stabilize Bitcoin's price and drive overall market growth. Market Maturity: The approval of a Bitcoin ETF could indicate that the cryptocurrency market has reached a certain level of maturity. Regulatory acceptance would establish Bitcoin as an investable asset class, perhaps drawing more sophisticated investors and increasing media interest. This process of maturing may result in more sophisticated trading techniques, stronger market infrastructure, and enhanced investor protection. Increased Public knowledge and Education: The creation of a Bitcoin ETF could lead to more public knowledge and education regarding cryptocurrencies. As ETFs become more widely discussed and covered in mainstream financial media, more people may become interested in Bitcoin and its underlying technology. This increased awareness may pique the public's attention and pique their curiosity.\n\nConclusion: A Watershed Moment with Far-Reaching Consequences\n\nFinally, the approval of a Bitcoin ETF has the potential to reshape the bitcoin environment and boost mainstream adoption. A Bitcoin ETF might improve accessibility, encourage institutional interest, contribute to market maturation, and raise public awareness in addition to functioning as a handy investment instrument. The road to regulatory approval is an important step toward combining digital assets with traditional finance.\n\nHowever, it is critical to recognize that regulatory concerns and potential problems persist. The cryptocurrency market is notorious for its volatility and regulatory uncertainty, and the licensing of a Bitcoin ETF would not be without scrutiny and controversy. The potential benefits must be balanced against the potential risks and the requirement for strong investor protection.\n\nOne thing is certain as the financial world awaits regulatory decisions: the possible approval of a Bitcoin ETF has the ability to transform attitudes, narratives, and investing strategies in the cryptocurrency industry. The repercussions of this decision will echo across the financial ecosystem for years to come, whether as a springboard for greater adoption or as a stimulus for regulatory conversation."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is due to hit nearly $150,000 during its next four-year halving cycle, Pantera Capital believes.\n\nIn its latest \u201cBlockchain Letter,\u201d released on Aug. 22, executives at the crypto asset manager doubled down on their bullish BTC price forecasts for 2024 and beyond.\n\nHalving data reinforces November 2022 BTC price bottom\n\nBitcoin price performance depends heavily on its halving cycles, Pantera Capital argues, and with the next due within the coming twelve months, the firm is betting that historical trends will continue.\n\nBTC/USD, it notes, tends to put in a cycle bottom and top roughly equal lengths of time from each block subsidy halving, which cuts the number of Bitcoin paid to miners per block by 50%.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has historically bottomed 477 days prior to the halving, climbed leading into it, and then exploded to the upside afterward,\u201d it wrote.\n\n\u201cThe post-halving rallies have averaged 480 days \u2013 from the halving to the peak of that next bull cycle.\u201d\n\nThat same theory suggests that the 2022 bear market bottom marked the current BTC price cycle bottom.\n\n\u201cIF history were to repeat itself, the price of bitcoin should have troughed December 30, 2022,\u201d Pantera continued.\n\nLooking forward, by the halving date in April 2024, BTC/USD could be trading at around $35,000 \u2014 something that it is still on track to accomplish.\n\nHowever, what happens in the 480 days afterward involves not only a new all-time high but much more.\n\n\u201cThe 2016 halving decreased the supply of new bitcoins only one-third as much as the first. Interestingly, it had exactly one-third the price impact. The 2020 halving reduced the supply of new bitcoins by 43% relative to the previous halving. It had a 23% as big an impact on price,\u201d Pantera stated.\n\n\u201cThe next halving is expected to occur on April 20, 2024. Since most bitcoins are now in circulation, each halving will be almost exactly half as big a reduction in new supply. If history were to repeat itself, the next halving would see bitcoin rising to $35k before the halving and $148k after.\u201d\n\n480 days from an April 2024 halving makes Bitcoin scheduled to hit its next all-time high by July 2025.\n\nBitcoin halving characteristics (screenshot).

Joe Kelly, the cofounder and CEO of financial services company Unchained, also sees steep upside for bitcoin after the halving process. He pointed out in a recent note that 12 months after the 2012, 2016, and 2020 halvings, bitcoin was up 8,069%, 284%, and 559%, respectively.\n\n\"Taking a conservative view,\" Kelly wrote, \"if bitcoin stays around $30K until the halving, even a 12-month post-halving increase of 250% \u2014 which, again, is conservative relative to previous halvings \u2014 would price bitcoin at $105K.\""

        "title": "Bitcoin options data points to an interesting outcome after this week's $1.9B expiry - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The upcoming $1.9 billion Bitcoin monthly options expiry on Aug. 25 is key to defining whether the $26,000 support level will hold. One could pin the recent cryptocurrency market sell-off on the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delaying its decision on spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, but there\u2019s also the macroeconomic perspective.\n\nIf the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to curb inflation work, it\u2019s probable that the trend of a stronger U.S. dollar will persist. This was evident as the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), a measure of the dollar against other currencies, reached its highest level in 76 days on Aug. 22.\n\nTo prevent a potential loss of $380 million due to the monthly Bitcoin (BTC) options expiry, Bitcoin bulls must ensure Bitcoin's price trades above $27,000 by Aug. 25.\n\nBitcoin bears will benefit from the threat of harsh regulation\n\nCryptocurrency bulls have encountered regulatory challenges lately. This is evident as the top two cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance and Coinbase, are currently entangled in lawsuits with the SEC. Additionally, the initial victory celebrated by Ripple against the SEC is now under appeal by the regulatory body.\n\nAdding to these developments, Bitstamp recently revealed its decision to halt staking services for U.S.-based clients. A pivotal concern within the ongoing U.S. regulatory landscape revolves around the classification of Ether (ETH) as either a commodity or a security.\n\nFurthermore, Binance has communicated the suspension of its crypto debit card offerings across Latin America and the Middle East. This decision follows allegations of Binance also suspending euro withdrawals and deposits through SEPA on Aug. 20. The exchange clarified that there is no definite timeline for reinstating the service.\n\nData shows bulls were excessively optimistic about Bitcoin price\n\nThe open interest for the options expiry on Aug. 25 stands at $1.9 billion. However, it\u2019s projected that the final amount will be less due to certain traders foreseeing price levels reaching $29,000 or even higher. The unexpected 12% correction in Bitcoin\u2019s price from Aug. 14 to Aug. 19 certainly took bullish investors off guard, as evident from the Deribit Bitcoin options interest chart.\n\nBitcoin options aggregate open interest for Aug. 25. Source: Deribit\n\nThe 0.56 put-to-call ratio reflects the imbalance between the $1.2 billion in call (buy) open interest and the $685 million in put (sell) options. However, if Bitcoin\u2019s price remains near $26,500 at 8:00 am UTC on Aug. 25, only $35 million worth of these call (buy) options will be available. This difference happens because the right to buy Bitcoin at $27,000 or $28,000 is useless if BTC trades below that level on expiry.\n\nBitcoin bears aim for sub-$26,000 to maximize their gains\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on Aug. 25 for call (buy) and put (sell) instruments varies depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit.\n\nThis crude estimate disregards more complex investment strategies. For instance, a trader could have sold a call option, effectively gaining negative exposure to Bitcoin above a specific price. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no easy way to estimate this effect.\n\nBetween $25,000 and $26,000: 100 calls vs. 15,100 puts. The net result favors the put instruments by $380 million.\n\n100 calls vs. 15,100 puts. The net result favors the put instruments by $380 million. Between $26,000 and $27,000: 1,400 calls vs. 11,000 puts. The net result favors the put instruments by $250 million.\n\n1,400 calls vs. 11,000 puts. The net result favors the put instruments by $250 million. Between $27,000 and $28,000: 4,000 calls vs. 8,400 puts. The net result favors the put instruments by $110 million.\n\n4,000 calls vs. 8,400 puts. The net result favors the put instruments by $110 million. Between $28,000 and $29,000: 6,000 calls vs. 5,300 puts. The net result is balanced between call and put options.\n\nTake note that for the bulls to level the playing field before the monthly expiry, they must achieve a 6% price increase from $26,400. In contrast, the bears only require a modest 2% correction below $26,000 to secure a $380 million advantage on Aug. 25.\n\nGiven Bitcoin\u2019s repeated drops below the $26,000 support level from Aug. 21 to Aug. 23, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if this level was tested again before the options expiry. Furthermore, considering the current cryptocurrency regulatory landscape, there\u2019s minimal incentive for Bitcoin bulls to reverse the prevailing bearish momentum after the $1.9 billion monthly options expiry.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "BlackRock founder, chairman and CEO Larry Fink has said crypto represents a digitised alternative to popular hedging assets such as gold after his firm filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a bitcoin ETF.\n\nHaving previously been more neutral on digital assets than other prominent figures including Warren Buffett, the founder of the world\u2019s largest asset manager has recently been outspoken in favour of the asset class\u2019s potential and last year even describing tokenisation as the \u201cnext evolution\u201d in securities.\n\n\u201cCrypto is digitising gold in many ways,\u201d Fink said in a recent Fox News interview. \u201cInstead of investing in gold as a hedge against inflation, a hedge against the onerous problems of any one country or the devaluation of your currency.\n\n\u201cAs I have said in the past, we are a believer in the digitisation of products. ETFs were a big revolution for the mutual fund industry and they are really taking over the mutual fund industry.\n\n\u201cWe believe if we can create more tokenisation of assets and securities \u2013 and that is what bitcoin is \u2013 that could once again revolutionise finance.\u201d\n\nFink continued, stating crypto assets and their underlying technology are an opportunity for asset managers to further \u201cdemocratise the cost of investing\u201d provide investors with fractionalised access to securities.\n\n\u201cRight now, the bid-ask spread for crypto is very expensive and it does erode a lot of the returns because it costs a lot of money to transact bitcoin.\n\n\u201cOver the last 10 years, we have lowered the cost of iShares ETFs by 30%. What we are trying to do with crypto is make it more democratised and much cheaper for investors.\u201d\n\nFimk\u2019s comments follow the firm\u2019s surprise move to file for a bitcoin ETF in the US in June.\n\nThe iShares Bitcoin Trust is vying to be the first spot bitcoin ETF in the US and will rely on Coinbase Custody for spot market data and storage of its underlying assets if approved.\n\n\u201cWe hope, like the past, we can work with our regulators and get this filing approved one day. I have no idea when this one day will be,\u201d Fink continued.\n\n\u201cI cannot get into any specifics but\u2026we work really closely with our regulators and we want to hear what their issues are and how we can fix those.\u201d\n\nBlackRock currently has a formidable track record of ETF approvals, with all but one of its 576 applications being approved by the SEC.\n\nThe firm\u2019s bitcoin ETF filing came within weeks of the regulator suing Coinbase for allegedly operating as an unregistered securities exchange.\n\nBlackRock first partnered with Coinbase last August to offer institutional clients using its Aladdin platform the ability to purchase bitcoin. BlackRock launched its own spot bitcoin trust for US institutional clients later that month.\n\nFellow spot bitcoin ETF applicant Grayscale Investments previously sued the SEC after the regulator thwarted its efforts to convert its spot bitcoin trust into an ETF. The regulator has once again delayed its verdict on Grayscale\u2019s recent spot bitcoin ETF application.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas described BlackRock\u2019s move to enter the bitcoin ETF space as a \u201cshocker\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere have been no signs at all the SEC is willing to approve but BlackRock is a very connected company so maybe they know something,\u201d he said.\n\nLast year, BlackRock noted \u201csignificant interest\u201d from clients in the asset class but told ETF Stream it had \u201cno plans\u201d to launch a crypto ETF.\n\nA spokesperson previously said: \u201cIt is worth noting that the SEC has yet to approve an application for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP).\n\n\u201cIn general, any decision as to whether to launch iShares ETPs is based on an array of factors including market and asset dynamics, regulatory considerations and client demand.\u201d"

        "title": "What are the 3 assets most correlated with Bitcoin? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The financial media often points out Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) correlation to Big Tech. \u201cBitcoin is trading like a tech stock\u201d is a common narrative alongside BTC\u2019s often acute inverse relationship with the United States dollar.\n\nBut are these correlations set in stone, and can they help predict future price moves? Let\u2019s look closely at several reports analyzing the relationship between Bitcoin and various asset types.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s historic correlations vary across timeframes\n\nA report published in October 2022 by the Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute arrived at several key conclusions regarding Bitcoin\u2019s correlations with traditional financial assets, including:\n\nThe extreme volatility of the Bitcoin market means that long-term correlations are stronger than short-term correlations.\n\nThe \u201cpositive linkage between Bitcoin and risk assets increases during extreme shocks,\u201d such as during COVID-19.\n\nBitcoin can be positively correlated with risk assets and negatively correlated with the U.S. dollar.\n\nBitcoin can serve as a hedge against the U.S. dollar.\n\nWhile some of these points can be countered with newer price data over the last nine to 10 months, such as a major drop in volatility, insight can still be gained from examining them. In addition, other researchers have gone deeper into the relationship of specific assets to Bitcoin during set timeframes.\n\nCrypto-specific stocks\n\nA few crypto-related equities have been more correlated to Bitcoin than any other assets on the market. The 90-day correlation coefficient for BTC/MSTR, BTC/COIN, and BTC/RIOT have all remained near 1 for the last several months. The symbols \u201cBTC/xxxx\u201d indicate the correlation coefficient for each asset as measured against Bitcoin.\n\nFor MicroStrategy (MSTR), the coefficient has fallen no lower than 0.68 since September 2022. The coefficient for Riot Platforms (RIOT) fell to roughly 0.75 in June 2023, while Coinbase (COIN) trended near 0 for a time during May and June.\n\nCOIN, ROIT and MSTR year-to-date chart with 90-day correlation coefficients compared to BTC. Source: TradingView\n\nAll of these stocks have outperformed Bitcoin so far this year while also showing greater volatility. Investors may use these assets as proxies for Bitcoin, which can\u2019t be bought through a brokerage account.\n\nOne reason these three stocks are so closely correlated to Bitcoin has to do with the balance sheet of their respective companies. They all have a substantial amount of Bitcoin holdings.\n\nAs the table below shows, MicroStrategy has the most holdings of any public company, with 152,333 Bitcoin; Coinbase is fourth, with 10,766 Bitcoin; and Riot is eighth, with 7,094 Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin holdings by public companies. Source: CoinGecko\n\nPrecious metals\n\nWhen it comes to correlation with commodities and precious metals, silver beats gold in mirroring Bitcoin\u2019s price moves since 2019.\n\nA November 2022 report by Jordan Doyle and Urav Soni of the CFA Institute titled \u201cHow do cryptocurrencies correlate with traditional asset classes?\u201d shed some light on Bitcoin\u2019s most-correlated assets.\n\nCrypto and commodities correlation heat map. Source: CFA Institute\n\nSilver has been the commodity most closely-correlated to Bitcoin from October 2019 to October 2022, with a correlation coefficient of 0.26, according to the report. Gold\u2019s correlation, by comparison, was just 0.15, perhaps due to silver\u2019s greater volatility.\n\nThe report notes:\n\nSilver has the highest correlation, peaking at 0.26 for silver and bitcoin. Bitcoin, the so-called 'digital gold,' exhibits only weak correlation with the precious metal.\n\nPassive and active equity funds and bonds\n\nWhen speaking of stocks as a whole and their correlation to Bitcoin, looking at an index or exchange-traded fund would be the most common way to make a comparison. This provides an overview of the asset class in general rather than zeroing in on one specific stock, which may have any number of factors affecting it.\n\nAs might be expected, growth funds tend to be more correlated with cryptocurrencies, presumably due to their more speculative nature. Notably:\n\n\u201cGrowth funds exhibit a stronger correlation to cryptocurrencies than value funds. The correlation coefficient between small-cap growth funds and bitcoin, for instance, is 0.41, compared to 0.35 for small-cap value funds and bitcoin.\u201d\n\nCrypto, equity funds and bonds correlation heat map. Source: CFA Institute\n\nIn other words, crypto markets as a whole are \u201cweakly sensitive to interest rate dynamics\u201d that were at least partially responsible for a broad drawdown in equities throughout 2022.\n\nFinally, Bonds bear little to no relationship with Bitcoin. Passive bond funds showed a correlation of just 0.11, while active bond funds were just two basis points higher at 0.13. All data points are for the timeframe of October 2019 to October 2022.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s correlations are not a crystal ball\n\nDue to Bitcoin\u2019s large price swings, all correlations can change at a moment\u2019s notice. Still, the data used here provides an accurate picture of the assets most closely correlated to Bitcoin in the recent past.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin and correlations: examining the relationship between btc, gold, and the nasdaq\n\nCrypto-specific stocks will likely continue having a strong correlation due to their Bitcoin holdings, while the correlation with commodities and equity funds could quickly change course going forward.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

One person Magazine spoke to believes it will eventually lead to an interconnected supercomputer being built on-chain.\n\n\n\nDanny Yang, a Stanford PhD, creator of OCM Dimensions and Bitcoiner since 2013, says recursive inscriptions unlock the next evolution of Bitcoin:\n\n\u201cPeople won\u2019t believe it when it\u2019s presented to them now. It\u2019s not going to operate exactly like Uniswap, but other high-value digital assets will emerge on Bitcoin. That\u2019s what Ordinals and recursive inscriptions will evolve into. They will become a new form of programmable assets and code.\u201d\n\nThese tech developments \u2014 while at a very early and speculative stage \u2014 are making Bitcoin interesting again. A Bitcoin maxi friend complained to me that I never write about Bitcoin. In truth, there\u2019s been very little new to write about until recently.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty true,\u201d Yang agrees.\n\n85% of on-chain bitcoin transactions in the past 24 hours are ordinals related\n\n\n\nEIGHTY FIVE PERCENT\n\n\n\nthe main usecase of the bitcoin chain is ORDINALS pic.twitter.com/PCZt4if5jf \u2014 Udi Wertheimer (@udiWertheimer) August 20, 2023\n\nRecursive support switched on in June\n\nYang has worked on recursive inscriptions since February in the form of Bitcoin generative NFT collections OCM Dimensions and OCM Genesis. He inscribed both of those innovative collections on Bitcoin in February (along with compression and 3D programming libraries) before anyone understood the significance of what he had done.\n\nYet OCM Dimensions was only publicly launched on June 15, the day that recursive inscription support was turned on for Ordinals.com. Yang explains to Magazine:\n\n\u201cYou have to show something before people start listening, and finally, after months of beating the drums about the significance of recursive inscriptions on Bitcoin, people are starting to get it after we showed what was possible with OCM Dimensions \u2014 the first 3D, high resolution, animated and interactive work on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nFor now, the smart contract-enabled Ethereum blockchain is the home of more developer activity than anywhere else, and it dominates the DeFi sector. Until this year, the idea of building a genuine smart contract \u2014 the self-executing code used as building blocks for programmable money ecosystems \u2014 was not possible on Bitcoin.\n\nBut some now say Ordinals and recursive inscriptions could see a DeFi ecosystem emerge on Bitcoin fairly soon. It\u2019s not going to be easy, though.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals is a big deal. I\u2019ve been building on Bitcoin for over ten years, and Ordinals is the most significant development in recent years. Don\u2019t get distracted by the monkey JPEGs talk, and do learn why the Ordinals Protocol is important. \ud83d\udc47\ud83e\uddf5 \u2014 danny huuep (@huuep) June 20, 2023\n\nWhat are Ordinals and recursive inscriptions?\n\nOrdinals allow you to uniquely identify a satoshi or a sat. A satoshi is 100 millionth of a Bitcoin. Identifying a fractionalized part of a Bitcoin means creating NFTs on Bitcoin or creating a provenance certificate on-chain is now possible. The idea of NFTs on Bitcoin, the most decentralized OG chain, is tantalizing for some.\n\nRecursive Inscriptions are difficult to understand but have heaps of potential. (Pexels)\n\nIn January 2023, developer Casey Rodarmor released the Ordinals protocol, creating Bitcoin NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain. Rodarmor found an unintended loophole in the taproot scripts that command lines of Bitcoin code.\n\nThe Ordinals\u2019 protocol creator argues that such NFTs are now \u201ccomplete,\u201d as the token and related images are stored on the Bitcoin blockchain rather than side chains or using off-chain storage systems like most Ethereum NFTs. Digital artifacts on Bitcoin are truly immutable.\n\n\u201cNow you can own the actual art, not just a contract that points at a piece of art stored on centralized databases,\u201d says Carlo Fox, an \u201cOrdinals OG\u201d since February who created the Nakamoto Whales series. NFTs, as we know them on Ethereum and on other chains, are more like digital ownership certificates than actual on-chain art, and Ordinals change that.\n\n\u201cI got super excited for Ordinals for a few reasons: for one, we now can create and own on-chain art that is truly immutable. When you understand the ramifications of this, it\u2019s huge. Half the time, NFTs as we know them are stored on AWS, centralized, and controlled by creators who can turn your art into pictures of turds at any time.\u201d\n\nOrdinals allow you to store any type of data on the most decentralized blockchain, and no one can modify it. \u201cOrdinal artifacts may be most likely of any on-chain data to exist 2,000 years from now. That\u2019s meaningful, and I think it is particularly relevant when in the context of important works of art, literature and science. I believe that Ordinals will become the premiere destination for the most coveted and important on-chain art. It\u2019s akin to carving a statue out of gold,\u201d says Fox.\n\nSo the business case for high-value NFTs minted on Bitcoin makes sense. Using the new tech to create cool 3D art for OCM Dimensions helped Yang\u2019s company Metagood sell the idea of launching tokens on Bitcoin Ordinals to Asprey Studios and the Italian car company Bugatti recently.\n\nBut OG Ordinals could only hold 4MB of data, and that is one reason why recursive inscriptions have emerged.\n\nFox launched the Nakamoto Whales Ordinals collection: (Twitter)\n\nRecursive inscriptions = Bitcoin cloud computing\n\nAt its most basic recursive inscriptions let you record stuff associated with a particular Bitcoin and enable smart contract-type functionality \u2014 Yang says they could have been called programmable inscriptions. By interlinking data through a series of calls (a contract for a sell order, for example), it\u2019s possible to extract that data to run more complex processes anchored on Bitcoin blocks.\n\nThis enables recursive inscriptions to function like a distributed data repository, like putting AWS cloud on Bitcoin.\n\nRecursive Inscriptions 101\n\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nA recursive inscription calls data from prior inscriptions. Could be an image or some script which massively saves data/fees\n\n\n\nBrandon Marshall (@marshallmixing) tweeted about his website that uses recursive inscriptions\n\n\n\nSounds complicated? Nah,\u2026 pic.twitter.com/K3j3sBYNrK \u2014 Doggfather (@DoggfatherCrew) June 13, 2023\n\nComposability \u2014 getting disparate projects and protocols to work together seamlessly \u2014 is an important part of crypto and one of the main reasons behind the exponential growth of the Ethereum DApp ecosystem.\n\nRecursive inscriptions mean that even the most complex data sets, like video files and audio files, could now technically be hosted on Bitcoin. With a one-time cost to inscribe, data could be hosted forever on the most immutable and decentralized network in the world.\n\nRecursive Inscriptions use data inscribed elsewhere on new inscriptions, cutting down on storage requirements. (Pexels)\n\nInscriptions are like data legos, enabling data to be taken from somewhere else and built upon. In computer science, that\u2019s where the phrase recursive comes from, as recursive inscriptions are a mechanism that extracts data from existing inscriptions and utilizes that data within new inscriptions.\n\nRecursion is a fully on-chain process that uses scripts to combine various other on-chain data sources. These can include image layers, audio, code or other data sources. Individual scripts of code merge these layers together through recursion.\n\nRecursive inscriptions use data inscribed elsewhere on new inscriptions, cutting down on storage requirements.\n\nFox uses the example of PFP art. Instead of uploading thousands of unique images (which can be prohibitively expensive), you can upload 200 and use scripts to combine them via the fully on-chain recursion process. The possibilities this offers are only just being explored.\n\nThis is powerful because recursive inscriptions enable new types of applications that were not possible before it. Applications like on-chain AI couldn\u2019t be done on the base layer of Ethereum, but NewBitcoinCity builder Punk 3700 believes they could now be done on Bitcoin. He\u2019s been playing around with \u201cPerceptrons,\u201d an early on-chain AI experiment on Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nHe explains that \u201cit wasn\u2019t possible to store the AI neural net models on-chain together with the artworks. So we split the AI models into different inscriptions and compose them at runtime.\u201d\n\nInscriptions an important development for human freedom?\n\nOne of the most fascinating elements of recursive inscriptions is that once the data is on the blockchain once, you can simply refer to it again and again, vastly cutting down storage costs and block space utilization.\n\n\u201cInscriptions are now reusable,\u201d explains Punk 3700, \u201cYou can inscribe a very large code library like p5.js once, and other developers can reference that p5.js library at run time without inscribing it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is super exciting because we start seeing a community-driven public infrastructure being built out.\u201d This means more complex inscriptions are being created at a fraction of the cost.\n\n\u201cEssentially, any type of data can be an inscription. The most rudimentary use case combines multiple data sources together, and every piece of it can live on-chain. On-chain data might be able to communicate with each other, and data could be realized over time.\u201d\n\nFox explains further: \u201cThe best way to think of it is anything you can do locally on a computer and have all little pieces live together in different files and work together.\u201d\n\nHe gives examples like \u201copen-source libraries, all on-chain,\u201d meaning important research papers on Bitcoin, with citations on recursions on-chain, meaning major discoveries can be published on Bitcoin blocks for time immemorial. Javascript packages can be inscribed on Bitcoin. Essentially, a tiny internet that\u2019s developed to live on Bitcoin can\u2019t be taken down, building and building until one day it has created \u201can interconnected supercomputer living on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe public hasn\u2019t grasped the significance of these developments, says Fox.\n\nWhat if you could play games that couldn't be shut down, run exactly as programmed without fraud or interference & could live far beyond our lifetimes?\n\n\n\nSay GM to the era of Decentralized Games (dgames) on #Bitcoin\n\n\n\n\u2192 https://t.co/5zV6MpFHd1\n\n\n\nA thread \ud83d\udc47\ud83e\uddf5 pic.twitter.com/wYytBISiEV \u2014 3700 | New Bitcoin City (@punk3700) June 23, 2023\n\nLet\u2019s start with DeFi and AWS first\n\nLong before the supercomputer cranks up, we\u2019re likely to see Bitcoin DeFi and the chain emerge as a data storage competitor.\n\nToby Lewis co-founded OrdinalsBot, which automates inscriptions to help expedite development on Ordinals. He thinks that, for now, competing with the Web3 data storage provider IPFS is the best use case for recursive inscriptions. In the short term, both high-end and low-end NFTs can now be more affordably held on-chain.\n\n\u201cThe end point of storing data onto Bitcoin will get people excited. That\u2019s because Bitcoin has better name recognition than IPFS [\u2026] Bitcoin becomes the ultimate store of truth.\u201d\n\nDecentralized data storage on Bitcoin could disrupt NFT culture by allowing images, text files and audio files to be stored directly with tokens.\n\nOrdinals timeline (Ordinals Bot)\n\nLewis also thinks DeFi on Bitcoin is just becoming a realistic prospect now and that Bitcoin-native DeFi products are inevitable, even if they will be rudimentary for a while.\n\nThere is likely a large segment of users who will want to build and do something on Bitcoin, especially if the end state is a multichain ecosystem, posits Lewis. That is, use Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain as the layer-1 base, and use Ordinals and recursive inscriptions to connect to other applications.\n\nImagine we could split up parts of Bitcoin Core, load just an executable frontend, and the program \"calls\" the code it needs from other Inscriptions.\n\n\n\nYou're now running Bitcoin ON Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nWe can theoretically do this with a lot of different programs. \u2014 OrdinalHub \u25c9 (@ordinalhub) June 12, 2023\n\nDEXs and automated market makers are starting to emerge. Lewis notes that Bitcoin can link up to other layer-2 applications as another way for smart contracts to emerge on Bitcoin.\n\nThis is the kind of DeFi that Punk 3700 has been building on Bitcoin. He launched a new protocol called Trustless Computer that enables writing smart contracts and building DApps on Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cIf Ethereum and Bitcoin have a baby, that\u2019s Trustless Computer.\u201d\n\nOne of the first DeFi protocols it deployed was a Uniswap fork.\n\n\u201cNow that you could write smart contracts on Bitcoin, it turned out that building an AMM DEX was very simple. It took us just a couple of days.\u201d A month after deploying Uniswap on Bitcoin, Punk 3700 connected it to Ethereum layer-2 network Optimism and says it can trade with two-second latency and low transaction fees.\n\n\u201cWe now have a scalable infrastructure for DeFi to thrive on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nBitcoin maximalists aren\u2019t going to like the use of Ethereum protocols in conjunction with Bitcoin, but Punk 3700 says it\u2019s the future.\n\n\u201cThis is the power of having a general-purpose programming language (Solidity) and a general-purpose virtual machine on Bitcoin. Developers can build any kinds of applications they want for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin is now no longer just a currency. It is becoming a DApp store.\u201d\n\n\u26a1 NOS: Scaling for Bitcoin \u26a1\n\n\n\n* 2-second block time\n\n* Super fast\n\n* Low cost\n\n* Smart contracts supported\n\n\n\nThe NOS testnet is live.\n\n\n\nSpecs: https://t.co/GFZb0865Oz\n\n\n\nCode samples: Building a decentralized Discord https://t.co/8ZKvl8JsBI\n\n\n\nExplorer: https://t.co/Ax0IjKrQOj\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc47\ud83e\uddf5 pic.twitter.com/NJODoVrA4S \u2014 3700 | New Bitcoin City (@punk3700) June 1, 2023\n\nNew generation of Bitcoin maxis?\n\nAt present, these use cases for recursive inscriptions and smart contracts on Bitcoin are highly speculative, and many Bitcoiners would no doubt argue abstracting it away on layer 2s means it\u2019s no longer really Bitcoin at all.\n\nBut Leonidas, the founder of Ordinals marketplace Ord.io, is very excited about the new Web3 experiments on the Bitcoin layer 1 as well. He believes that \u201cthe release of the Ordinals protocol earlier this year ended a long period of stagnation\u201d for the chain. He\u2019s seeing a whole new wave of developers flood into the Bitcoin ecosystem, who are \u201ceager to build everything from NFT marketplaces to DeFi protocols.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think people will be pleasantly surprised with how much you can actually do on Bitcoin layer 1,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe issue was never that Bitcoin as a technology wasn\u2019t capable of handling Web3 use cases; it\u2019s that a culture of toxic maximalism had driven the most talented developers to other ecosystems where they would be celebrated for their innovations rather than harassed.\u201d\n\nLeonidas firmly believes that through Ordinals, Bitcoin has \u201centered a new era where developers rather than idealists will dictate its future,\u201d and he is optimistic that Bitcoin\u2019s brightest days lay ahead."

        "title": "Bitcoin ordinals inscriptions climbing steadily despite lull in prices - CNBC",
        "content": "Ordinals inscriptions have been consistently higher this summer while the price of bitcoin was in a lull. The number of ordinals recorded onto the bitcoin blockchain has spiked above 400,000 three times since July 30, surpassing the May high of 400,091, according to Dune Analytics. Twice in July the number jumped above 385,000. Ordinals are a new protocol that makes it possible to store and trade digital content on the bitcoin blockchain. The idea is similar to NFTs, barring some technical differences, and investors are excited about their ability to bring utility to the Bitcoin network beyond just trading its native token. \"The number of ordinals being inscribed is still going pretty solidly up and to the right,\" said Alex Miller, CEO of Hiro, a bitcoin developer tools company. \"People just want to be putting content and inscribing things onto the Bitcoin chain, which is why we're climbing at a steady rate.\" Meanwhile, the price of bitcoin is driven more by larger, more macro-level developments, he added. Ordinals first launched in February. Ordinals saw their first big spike in May, which led to a parabolic increase in bitcoin transaction fees . Given the newness of the idea, however, it's anyone's guess what it's adoption trajectory will be \u2014 especially given the former hype and uncertainty around their cousins, NFTs. Although NFTs have a wide range of potential utility, they became largely known as digital art and a concept lost on many. The recent ramp in ordinals activity came amid a pullback in NFT trading, Miller explained. Bitcoin transaction fee activity has been more muted in recent weeks. \"Transaction fees went crazy high because people were running large inscriptions, especially the initial setup ones for BRC-20 coins,\" Miller explained about the first spike this year. \"The inscriptions of late have been smaller and more efficient.\" That's due in part to a technical feature that allows users to save space on chain when recording data by referencing other existing inscriptions. These \"recursive inscriptions\" both \"make the art that you're seeing now, but the other thing is people are using this to figure out different ways to use the underlying technology that can get recombined and reused in different ways in the future for no- art based things as well.\""

        "content": "Our weekly roundup of news from East Asia curates the industry\u2019s most important developments.\n\nHashKey Hong Kong to commence retail trading\n\nCrypto exchange HashKey, the first licensed virtual asset provider in Hong Kong, will open its doors to residents for retail trading on Aug. 28.\n\nAccording to local news reports, investors will only be allowed to invest up to 30% of their net worth into cryptocurrencies when using the platform. A risk control warning will be displayed if the limit is exceeded. However, Xiaoqi Weng, chief operating officer of HashKey, mentioned that the exchange \u201ccannot validate users\u2019 net worth,\u201d and the limit is largely based on \u201cself-verification\u201d of assets.\n\nWeng also disclosed that the exchange will assess users\u2019 investment background based on information submitted during Know Your Customer verification. \u201cBeginners are limited in what they can purchase,\u201d said Weng.\n\nAt its debut, users can only trade Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) on HashKey Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission has not yet allowed the margin trading of crypto products or crypto derivatives on regulated exchanges, Weng noted.\n\nDark side of China\u2019s crypto crackdown\n\nIt appears China no longer wants any private blockchain firms operating within its borders and is on the warpath to get rid of them, no matter the consequences. The move comes amid an increase in using crypto as a means of capital flight in an economic downturn.\n\nLocal media reports suggest that, legitimate or not, blockchain projects in China have literal bounties on their heads. First, third-party tracking firms tip off the police on undercover crypto projects in the country; if the report leads to arrest and asset forfeiture, the tracking firm stands to make millions of dollars in commission \u2014 if not hundreds of millions of dollars for large-scale projects such as Multichain.\n\nA recent tip-off led to a 400 billion yuan ($55 billion) crypto money laundering bust by Chinese police. (DouYin)\n\nThen, after arrest, crypto executives are reportedly intimidated into handing over the project\u2019s private keys and access to servers. Police then allegedly get third-party payment processors to \u201cdump\u201d the coins and tokens over-the-counter in exchange for Chinese yuan.\n\nCrypto executives are then charged with operating a \u201cmultilevel marketing scheme,\u201d \u201cpyramid scheme,\u201d or \u201cmoney laundering.\u201d If convicted, the charges result in the seizure of all protocol-related assets by the state.\n\nSources claim that a portion of the funds goes into law enforcement agency revenue. Zhengyao Liu, a senior lawyer at the Shanghai Mankuen Law Firm, wrote:\n\n\u201cIn fact, in the past two years, the profit-seeking law enforcement in crypto-related criminal cases, especially in crypto-related MLM cases, has been the main reason people do not trust the case-handling agencies. For example, the \u2018contribution\u2019 of crypto-related criminal cases to financial fines and confiscation revenues is more than 50% higher than in previous years in the Jiangsu Province.\u201d\n\nThe crackdown has led to the termination of several protocols this year, with little recourse for non-Chinese users with funds stuck on these platforms. Unsurprisingly, it has sparked a wave of emigration among Chinese Web3 founders and overseas law enforcement efforts to try and recover the \u201cstuck\u201d funds.\n\nThe last message sent by Chinese exchange BKEX before its entire platform shut down and its staff disappeared. (BKEX)\n\nDigital yuan green bonds debut\n\nDespite the draconian crackdown on private crypto activities, government-led blockchain efforts in China are doing quite well.\n\nOn August 18, the first digital yuan central bank digital currency green bond was issued with a principal amount of 100 million Chinese yuan ($14 million), a term of two years, and a coupon rate of 2.6% per annum.\n\nFacilitated by the Bank of Ningbo, the loans will be used to finance a 1.4 gigawatt and a 1.0 GW solar panel facility expansion project in Wuxi.\n\nThe digital yuan CBDC has been repeatedly \u201cshilled\u201d for much of this year as a means of stimulating domestic spending amid a financial crisis within the country. In the city of Tianjin alone, digital yuan transaction volumes have surpassed $17.5 billion in the first half of 2023, with over 302,000 merchants accepting the CBDC as a means of payment.\n\nFBI tracks $41 million in North Korean crypto\n\nOn Aug. 22, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation announced the identification of 1,580 BTC ($41 million) stolen from various projects by North Korean hackers. The six displayed wallets include funds stolen from the $60 million Alphapo hack in June, $37 million stolen from CoinsPaid in June, and $100 million stolen from Atomic Wallet in June. The FBI wrote:\n\n\u201cPrivate sector entities should examine the blockchain data associated with these addresses and be vigilant in guarding against transactions directly with, or derived from, the addresses. The FBI will continue to expose and combat the DPRK\u2019s use of illicit activities \u2014 including cybercrime and virtual currency theft \u2014 to generate revenue for the regime.\u201d\n\nThe agency said it believes North Korea will attempt to cash out the stolen funds. Criminal investigations into North Korean hackers\u2019 role in the Harmony\u2019s Horizon Bridge and Sky Mavis\u2019 Ronin Bridge exploits last year are still ongoing.\n\nChinese Bitcoin mining magnate sentenced to life in prison\n\nYi Xiao, a former vice chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Political Consultative Conference Party Group, has reportedly been sentenced to life in prison by the Hangzhou Intermediate People\u2019s Court for unrelated charges of corruption and abuse of power in a Bitcoin mining enterprise.\n\nAccording to local news reports on August 22, Yi Xiao operated a 2.4 billion Chinese yuan ($329 million) Bitcoin mining enterprise under the corporate name Jiumu Group Genesis Technology from 2017 to 2021. Despite knowing about a ban on cryptocurrencies, Xiao amassed over 160,000 Bitcoin miners with other corporate executives and, at one time, 10% of the city of Fuzhou\u2019s entire electricity consumption.\n\nXiao was convicted of using his public office to secure preferential subsidies, capital, and electricity supply for the Jiamu Group. The former official also used his position to fabricate statistical reports to conceal the operations\u2019 true nature.\n\nStarting this year, China has been cracking down harshly on crypto activities amid a spree of data theft and money laundering incidences involving digital assets. Earlier this month, a Chinese national was sentenced to nine months in prison for purchasing $13,067 worth of Tether (USDT) for an acquaintance.\n\nYi Xiao, awaiting sentencing on charges of corruption and abuse of power (Hangzhou Intermediate People\u2019s Court)"

Discover SCENE\n\nEight Republican candidates are gearing up to take the debate stage tonight as the early 2024 presidential election cycle reaches a pivotal point.\n\nFormer President and Republican frontrunner Donald Trump\u2014who owns some Ethereum and has his own NFT collection\u2014will be notably absent, electing to skip the chit-chat in lieu of a pre-recorded interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Twitter.\n\nTrump also used Twitter in 2019 to say that \u201che\u2019s not a big fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,\u201d favoring the U.S. dollar. But other presidential hopefuls have also weighed in. Where do the candidates stand?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis has expressed support for Bitcoin since his first official day as a candidate. During his campaign\u2019s kickoff alongside Tesla CEO and Twitter owner Elon Musk, DeSantis told the billionaire that Bitcoin will probably be killed off if President Joe Biden is reelected.\n\n\u201cYou have every right to do Bitcoin,\u201d DeSantis also said. \u201cThe only reason these people in Washington don\u2019t like it is because they don\u2019t control it.\u201d\n\nDeSantis has critiqued central bank digital currencies (CBDC) as well. He once called the technology a \u201cmassive transfer of power from individual consumers to a central authority\u201d and moved to prevent a digital dollar from ever entering the Sunshine State.\n\nCBDCs are similar to stablecoins, as both are tokens pegged to the price of a sovereign currency like the greenback. But instead of being issued on public networks by private companies, CBDCs are maintained by their respective governments or central banks.\n\nEntrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy\n\nWhile Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. established himself as a pro-Bitcoin Biden alternative in May at Bitcoin 2023 in Miami, Biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy was also a speaker with plenty to say about crypto\u2019s largest coin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThomas Jefferson, he would\u2019ve been mining for Bitcoin today, I have little doubt about that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s an American embodiment. It\u2019s who we are as people.\u201d\n\nDuring his speech at Bitcoin 2023, Ramaswamy said that Bitcoin is not a security, lambasted the Federal Reserve for trying to play \u201cfinancial god,\u201d criticized CBDCs, and skewered the Biden\u2019s administration proposed 30% excise tax on crypto mining.\n\nOne of the primary objectives of his campaign is to reform the U.S. central bank, Ramaswamy said. He implored conference-goers to get him to the debate stage by donating Bitcoin to his campaign, and to make 2024 a \u201creferendum on sound money in the United States.\u201d\n\nRamaswamy told the crypto news site CoinDesk in May that he\u2019s the only candidate with enough knowledge to talk about Bitcoin intelligently. He also accused DeSantis of adopting many aspects of his pro-Bitcoin and anti-CBDC stance.\n\nEarlier this week, Ramaswamy got a thumbs up from Elon Musk, who called him \"a very promising candidate.\"\n\nSenator Tim Scott of South Carolina\n\nSouth Carolina Senator Tim Scott has established himself as supportive of crypto regulation. He\u2019s a member of the Senate\u2019s Financial Innovation Caucus, which discusses issues like digital assets, stablecoins, and CBDCs.\n\nScott was also a co-sponsor of the Equal Opportunity for All Investors Act, a bill that ultimately failed last year but sought to define digital assets as an investment and modify existing rules surrounding accredited investors.\n\nAt a Senate Banking Committee hearing devoted to digital assets in February, he called out Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler for his decision not to attend, contrasting it with a plethora of TV interviews Gensler has done.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe also asked whether the SEC was \u201casleep at the wheel\u201d for failing to take action against FTX before it was too late, leading to the collapse of the exchange last November.\n\n\u201cThe American people deserve to know why no action was taken prior to the collapse of FTX, and how millions of dollars of American\u2019s hard-earned money just vanished into nothing,\u201d he said.\n\nNorth Dakota Governor Doug Burgum\n\nNorth Dakota Governor Doug Burgum hasn\u2019t been a vocal proponent of Bitcoin on the campaign trail, but he\u2019s given the crypto sector a tip of the hat within the past year. Commenting on the construction of a data center in North Dakota last year, he noted the state\u2019s emergence as a hub for crypto mining.\n\n\u201cThis major investment in North Dakota will further cement our state\u2019s growing reputation as a hub for data centers and cryptocurrency mining,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are well-positioned to support data centers and other energy-intensive industries.\u201d\n\nCould be a supporter, but it\u2019s hard to tell\n\nThere were several candidates set to take the stage on Wednesday who do not appear to have issued public comments about cryptocurrency or Bitcoin. They are former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley, former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson, and former Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nHonorable mention\n\nMiami\u2019s pro-crypto Mayor Francis Suarez acknowledged on Wednesday that he did not qualify for the upcoming debate, after he erroneously claimed he did a week before, per ABC Action News.\n\nDuring an interview with the crypto news site The Block, Suarez said he would potentially take his salary in Bitcoin as president, something he already does as Miami\u2019s mayor. Additionally, the candidate accepts Bitcoin transactions.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important for a president to encourage generational innovation,\u201d he said. \u201cI do support alternative assets like crypto, and I think they\u2019re very good for a country like the U.S.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "The Cayman Islands has long been an idyllic beach getaway for tourists, but the archipelago could soon welcome Bitcoin (BTC) holders as new residents through BTC-backed loans used to invest in real estate.\n\nBitcoin banking firm Ledn, which is registered with the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority as a virtual assets service provider (VASP), is providing an avenue for Bitcoin holders to use their BTC as collateral for loans to invest in real estate on the islands.\n\nThis is just one avenue that prospective new residents of the islands could take to obtain citizenship, with investments over $2.4 million in real estate in the Cayman Islands qualifying a buyer for permanent residency.\n\nRelated: Noted tax haven Cayman Islands sees new bills to bring local crypto to FATF\u2019s heel\n\nSpeaking directly to Cointelegraph, Ledn CEO Adam Reeds unpacked a new partnership with local real estate agency Parallel, which has also facilitated a number of cryptocurrency-based property sales in the Cayman Islands.\n\n\u201cLedn will provide real estate buyers in the Caymans with crypto-backed loans, which Parallel will accept as a means to finance purchases. Parallel will only accept borrowed funds if they\u2019ve been loaned by Ledn \u2014 it is an exclusive partnership in this sense.\u201d\n\nAccording to Reeds, Parallel handles conversion to fiat currency if either a buyer or seller prefers the option over a cryptocurrency payment. Meanwhile, Ledn\u2019s portion of any transaction will be fiat-free, paid in either BTC or United States dollar-backed stablecoins.\n\n\u201cParallel is a crypto-centric real estate broker in the Caymans, so users can now finance their purchase of real estate completely fiat-free.\u201d\n\nIt is also possible for cryptocurrency holders to pay for a property with crypto in the Cayman Islands through Parallel. Reeds, however, highlighted a potential draw card in that investors can leverage their BTC holdings as collateral without selling a portion.\n\n\u201cThen if or when BTC goes up, your loan-to-value ratio goes down, so your house is appreciating, and so is the asset you\u2019re borrowing against.\u201d\n\nGiven that Parallel has previously sold real estate in cryptocurrency-facilitated transfers, Reeds added that both companies have seen demands for the service to finance significant property transactions.\n\nThe real estate firm sold a $10 million property in December 2022, which was paid for entirely in cryptocurrency. The company is also registered as a VASP with the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority, allowing it to facilitate cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nBoth Ledn and Parallel must adhere to comprehensive compliance requirements as part of their registration with the local monetary authority.\n\nThe concept of attaining residency by investment involving cryptocurrencies is not entirely new. Vanuatu claims to be the first country to accept Bitcoin as a means of payment to obtain citizenship by investment.\n\nA number of other countries have emerged as cryptocurrency-friendly destinations to try and obtain citizenship. Portugal, Malta and El Salvador have all emerged as relatively crypto-friendly countries, but it is still not possible to directly invest in Bitcoin to obtain or be eligible for residency.\n\nMagazine: Tokenizing music royalties as NFTs could help the next Taylor Swift"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) this summer completed its longest-ever period of negative year-over-year returns, wrote Dan Morehead, founder of crypto investment firm Pantera Capital.\n\nIt won't last, he argued.\n\n\"Our view is that we've seen enough,\" Morehead wrote. \"There's just so long markets can be down.\"\n\n#Bitcoin recently experienced the longest period of negative year-over-year returns in its history, lasting 15 months.\n\n\n\nThe longest period prior was just under a year.\n\n\n\nOur view is that we\u2019ve seen enough \u2013 there\u2019s just so long markets can be down.\n\n\n\nMore: https://t.co/REfxkTp9CJ pic.twitter.com/UCEMMcznAM \u2014 Dan Morehead (@dan_pantera) August 23, 2023\n\nAs of June 12, Morehead said, the price of bitcoin had been negative on a year-over-year basis for 15 consecutive months (starting Feb. 8, 2022). Prior to this, the longest period had been less than a year (Nov. 14, 2014, to Oct. 31, 2015), he continued.\n\nIt's notable that bitcoin is, as of Wednesday, up more than 20% year-over-year, even after last week's tumble from the near-$30,000 level.\n\nAs for possible positive catalysts for a market surely in need of one, Morehead notes that July's positive court ruling on the XRP token for Ripple Labs still stands, as do \"endorsements\" from BlackRock, Fidelity and other asset managers in the form of their spot bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nAnd don't forget about the upcoming April 2024 halving at which the BTC block reward for mining fresh blocks will be cut in half. Morehead isn't buying the efficient market hypothesis that the halving is so widely known that the its effect has already been reflected in pricing.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"If the demand for bitcoins stays constant and the supply of new bitcoins is cut in half, this will force the price up,\" said Morehead. His models suggest bitcoin bottomed for good late last year, should hit around $35,500 by the April 2024 halving and nearly $150,000 by late 2025.\n\nBitcoin retakes $26,000 level on Wednesday as rates plunge\n\nWeak economic data out of Europe early Wednesday sent previously surging interest rates sharply lower, with 10-year government bond yields in Germany, the U.K. and the U.S. all lower by 12 to 20 basis points.\n\nU.S. stock indexes are higher, led by the Nasdaq Composite's 1.5% advance. The S&P 500 is ahead by 1%.\n\nBitcoin is up 2% to $26,400, roughly inline with the gain for the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI).\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell takes center stage\n\nThe week's main economic event takes place on Friday morning, where U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell will deliver the keynote speech at the Kansas City Fed's Jackson Hole Symposium.\n\nWhile the Jackson Hole speech in the past has occasionally been a forum for important policy announcements, the betting this time around is that Powell delivers a status quo message \u2013 that the Fed remains focused on containing inflation and will be data dependent going forward on decisions about whether to further tighten monetary policy.\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "Institutional Players Embrace Bitcoin: What It Means for the Market - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "In recent years, the cryptocurrency environment has undergone extraordinary change, with one of the most significant transitions being the increased interest and participation of institutional players in the Bitcoin market. Bitcoin, long regarded as a volatile and speculative asset, is rapidly gaining acceptance as a genuine investment alternative among institutional investors.\n\nWe dive into key trends of institutional actors embracing Bitcoin, examining the ramifications for the cryptocurrency market, traditional finance, and the global economy as a whole.\n\nThe Changing Nature of Institutional Interest\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have traditionally been associated with individual investors and computer enthusiasts. However, a tectonic change has occurred in recent years. Investment businesses, hedge funds, family offices, and even publicly traded organizations have begun to commit a portion of their holdings to Bitcoin.\n\nUnpacking the Institutional Shift\n\nBitcoin's institutional acceptance represents a fundamental shift in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This tendency has far-reaching repercussions for a variety of stakeholders:\n\nLegitimacy and Validation: Institutional involvement gives the cryptocurrency market legitimacy and validation. Traditional finance participants contribute a level of due diligence, regulatory compliance, and risk assessment that can act as a catalyst for wider acceptance. Price Dynamics and Market Stability: The entry of institutional investors has the potential to influence the price dynamics of Bitcoin. While retail investors may respond more emotionally to market volatility, institutional investors tend to take a longer-term perspective, which may contribute to enhanced market stability. Institutional participation Resulting in increasing Mainstream Awareness and Education: Institutional participation always results in increasing mainstream awareness. As major financial news sites cover institutional interest in Bitcoin, the general public gains a better understanding of the asset class, potentially leading to additional entrants and investors. Regulatory Considerations: The arrival of institutional players frequently sparks regulatory debates and considerations. Regulators may step up their inspection to protect investors and guarantee market integrity. Maintaining institutional engagement requires regulatory certainty. Trading Infrastructure and Liquidity: Institutional participants require sophisticated trading infrastructure, such as regulated exchanges, custody solutions, and liquidity pools. The requirement for such infrastructure promotes cryptocurrency ecosystem innovation and improvement. Market Diversification: Institutional participants add diversity to the market, which can assist alleviate concentration problems. Diversification helps to create a more balanced and robust market ecosystem.\n\nInstitutional Adoption of Bitcoin: Catalysts and Players\n\nInstitutional adoption of Bitcoin is witnessing remarkable growth, as key players across sectors embrace the cryptocurrency.\n\nFinancial institutions, technology firms, and investment companies are propelling this transformative shift, driven by distinct motivations.\n\nFinancial Institutions:\n\nDiversification and Portfolio Management: Bitcoin presents an alternative asset class, offering potential returns while reducing portfolio risk.\n\nClient Demand: Meeting clients' cryptocurrency interests retains customer loyalty and prevents attrition to rivals.\n\nHedge Against Economic Uncertainty: Bitcoin's decentralized nature and limited supply safeguard against currency devaluation and economic uncertainty.\n\nTechnology Companies:\n\nInnovation and Market Expansion: Integrating Bitcoin bolsters innovation and positions companies at the forefront of technological trends.\n\nSeamless Payments: Bitcoin's blockchain facilitates swift, secure cross-border transactions, making it ideal for payment processors and digital services.\n\nInvestment Firms:\n\nPotential Returns: Bitcoin's historical price performance allures investment firms aiming to generate alpha and outperform traditional markets.\n\nPortfolio Diversification: Adding Bitcoin diversifies investment strategies, minimizing risk and enhancing performance.\n\nStore of Value: As a digital store of value akin to gold, Bitcoin preserves wealth amid a digitally-driven world.\n\nInstitutional involvement signifies growing acceptance and recognition of Bitcoin's transformative impact. The participation of key players fosters stability, liquidity, and credibility in the cryptocurrency market, propelling Bitcoin's trajectory and integration into the broader financial ecosystem.\n\nWhat is the source of institutional interest?\n\nSeveral factors contribute to institutional investors' growing interest in Bitcoin:\n\nNarrative of a Store of Value: The narrative of Bitcoin as \"digital gold\" has acquired popularity among institutional investors. Bitcoin's scarcity, combined with its decentralized structure, puts it as a possible hedge against traditional financial market dangers. Inflation Fears: Central banks' unprecedented monetary policies in response to the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 epidemic have sparked concerns about impending inflation. Bitcoin is viewed by institutional investors as a hedge against currency depreciation and inflation risks. Potential for huge Returns: While some investors are put off by Bitcoin's volatility, others see it as a chance for potentially huge returns. Institutional investors with a risk appetite may be drawn to Bitcoin's historical price performance. Diversification Strategy: Institutional investors frequently strive to diversify their holdings in order to reduce risk. Bitcoin is a unique uncorrelated asset class that can help diversify portfolios.\n\nConclusion: A Changing Environment\n\nFinally, the institutional acceptance of Bitcoin represents a paradigm shift in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The ramifications of traditional finance colliding with the new arena of digital assets go far beyond price movements. The involvement of institutions brings legitimacy, market maturity, and increasing public awareness. It does, however, introduce regulatory concerns and the requirement for robust infrastructure.\n\nThe synergy between traditional banking and innovative technology is redefining the future of finance as the cryptocurrency market evolves under the influence of institutional actors. The road forward entails negotiating regulatory frameworks, fine-tuning investment strategies, and encouraging deeper collaboration between the two areas. The institutional acceptance of Bitcoin is more than just an investment trend; it represents a watershed moment in the convergence of finance and technology."

        "content": "On Aug. 24, Cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced its intention to modify its zero-fee Bitcoin (BTC) trading program starting Sept. 7. The action has the potential to initiate a significant market downturn, reminiscent of the 90% trading volume decline observed following Binance\u2019s discontinuation of zero-fee trading in March.\n\nIn an official statement, Binance said it intends to modify zero-fee Bitcoin trading for the BTC/TUSD spot and margin trading pair.\n\nPreviously, traders experienced zero maker and taker fees while engaging in BTC trading with TUSD pairs. However, a regular taker fee will now be implemented based on the user\u2019s VIP level. Nonetheless, users will still encounter no maker fees when conducting Bitcoin trades on the BTC/TUSD spot and margin trading pair.\n\n\u201cThe corresponding trading volume on the BTC/TUSD spot and margin trading pair will count toward VIP tier calculation and all Liquidity Provider programs. In addition, BNB discounts, referral rebates, and any other fee adjustments will resume for BTC/TUSD spot and margin trading volumes.\u201d\n\nThe program's discontinuation may indicate a decreased backing for the TrueUSD (TUSD) stablecoin due to various concerns. Importantly, users will still retain the privilege of zero maker and taker fees while engaging in Bitcoin trading within the First Digital USD (FDUSD) spot and margin trading pair.\n\nThe adjustment could inadvertently incite another round of selloffs in the market.\n\nRelated: Binance dubs barred Russian banks on its platform as \u2018Yellow\u2019 and \u2018Green\u2019 cards\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, the BTC/TUSD and BTC/USDT pairs are the most frequently traded for Bitcoin, constituting 11% and 7%, respectively. The trading volume in Tether (USDT) pairs experienced a significant drop after Binance stopped supporting Binance USD (BUSD) and designated TUSD as the sole trading pair for zero-fee Bitcoin trading.\n\nYet again, the exchange is redirecting attention away from the widely traded TUSD to the lesser-known FDUSD stablecoin. Notably, FDUSD doesn\u2019t rank within the top 10 Bitcoin pairs by trading volume, with the market capitalization of FDUSD standing at $324 million.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Deposit risk: What do crypto exchanges really do with your money?"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin\u2019s mining difficulty has hit a new all-time high despite the digital asset\u2019s less-than-stellar price performance of late.\n\nMining difficulty refers to how competitive it is to mine Bitcoin (BTC). The difficulty rises as more mining units get deployed, and thus suggests that the activity continues to be a profitable and popular enterprise.\n\nAccording to data from CoinWarz, Bitcoin\u2019s mining difficulty is 55.62 trillion hashes. The network's last notable peak was 53.9 trillion hashes on July 17 this year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"The deployment is an arm\u2019s race. Everyone is putting as much as possible online before the halving. You can see this with Hut8, Canaan, and Riot,\" co-founder of mining firm LSJ Ops Scott Norris told Decrypt. \"We\u2019re also seeing Antpool and other Chinese firms growing hash rate at a pace we haven\u2019t seen in over a year. Whatsminer has shipped their latest generation machines already and their hash abilities are growing substantially.\"\n\nDespite the milestone, markets currently tell a different story.\n\nInvestor sentiment towards Bitcoin turned bearish last week after Chinese property giant Evergrande filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in a Manhattan court, pushing some investors to dump their more speculative assets.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price fell 10.8% over the last 7 days to trade a fraction south of $26,000 on Wednesday, per CoinGecko.\n\nHowever, the mining sector moves relatively slowly, so more positive metrics like its rising difficulty or hash rate are not typically reactive to Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s because most rigs that came online in the last 24 hours were paid for long in advance.\n\nBitcoin mining stats on the up\n\nCertain events can significantly pull down the metric\u2014such as China\u2019s 2021 crackdown against crypto miners, or a cold snap in North America last winter that caused some operational problems to the grid, prompting some big miners to either shut down or curtail power.\n\nHowever, when those machines relocate or come back online, the data usually shows a marked upward adjustment.\n\nBroadly speaking, mining difficulty is constantly climbing year-on-year. That\u2019s because every year more machines are deployed than shut down.\n\nAnother metric that climbed recently\u2013and that is also always climbing every year\u2013is hash rate. Hash rate measures the computing power of the Bitcoin network.\n\nBitcoin mining rigs use their power to break codes to validate logs of transactions on the network\u2014called \u201cblocks\u201d\u2014which are then added to Bitcoin\u2019s immutable distributed ledger system. Miners are rewarded for this work with Bitcoin.\n\nEach attempt at cracking the encryption generates a code called a \u201chash.\u201d The first miner to transmit the valid hash for their candidate block gets the reward and gets added to the blockchain. Miners are thus incentivized to work quickly.\n\nThe higher the hash rate is, the more attempts (or hashes) Bitcoin miners can make within a second to break the code\u2014a clear indicator of the network\u2019s computational power.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nToday, Bitcoin is making 446 quintillion codebreaking attempts every second.\n\nThat\u2019s high but not quite as high as earlier this month, when the network was making almost 486 quintillion attempts every second."

        "title": "Down 9% in the Past 5 Days, Is Now the Right Time to Buy Bitcoin? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After Bitcoin (BTC -0.51%) crashed 65% in 2022, investors are surrounding it with a renewed sense of optimism. The price of the top cryptocurrency has soared 56% in 2023, almost double the gains of the Nasdaq Composite Index.\n\nBut as of Aug. 17, Bitcoin's price has dropped about 9% -- and even more at some points. Perhaps there's some bearish sentiment starting to take hold.\n\nShould investors take advantage of the dip and buy Bitcoin right now? Or is it best to wait until there's more clarity about the near term? Let's take a closer look at the world's most valuable cryptocurrency.\n\nNotable headwinds\n\nSpaceX, the private aerospace company founded and run by Elon Musk, sold all of its Bitcoin holdings during the first three months of 2023. This was after the business wrote down the value of that investment by $373 million in the last two years.\n\nSpaceX has owned Bitcoin since mid-2021, so maybe the move was simply to take the loss, minimize the distraction that it might have caused, and instead focus on the core business of developing rockets and spacecraft.\n\nBitcoin's market cap is about $500 billion now, so the amount that SpaceX sold was tiny in the grand scheme of things. But it's not hard to believe that when news of the sale broke, it could have spurred other investors to do the same. That's because some parts of the investment community follow anything that Musk says or does very closely. So, when his company ditched its Bitcoin holdings, it's certainly possible that others followed suit.\n\nMusk isn't new to moving in and out of Bitcoin. In early 2021, Tesla bought a sizable $1.5 billion stake in the crypto and said it would accept it as payment for its popular electric cars.\n\nJust a few months after, Tesla decided that it wouldn't accept Bitcoin as payment due to climate concerns -- something that Musk, a brilliant tech mogul, should have known about before buying the digital asset in the first place. And in July 2022, it was reported that Tesla sold 75% of its Bitcoin position.\n\nBesides Musk's company potentially having an impact on Bitcoin, economic concerns could be at the top of investors' minds. Although the Federal Reserve does expect to cut interest rates sometime in 2024, rates also could be kept higher for longer.\n\nSpecifically, officials believe it will be awhile before the federal funds rate gets back to where it was before the pandemic, between 2% and 3%. Higher rates are generally a headwind for risky financial assets. Just look at what happened to tech stocks and the crypto market last year.\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nThe near-term picture for Bitcoin is a bit unclear. Macroeconomic issues -- like where interest rates and inflation are headed, as well as how the economy is holding up -- will always be things to pay attention to. The price will continue to be volatile, which isn't surprising to anyone. And developments around regulatory updates probably will affect price action, too.\n\nBut I don't think the long-term story for Bitcoin has changed. The central thesis for owning the digital asset is that it could become a viable alternative to gold as a store of value, especially as the world continues becoming more digital and the internet grows in importance.\n\nPlus, Bitcoin possesses some characteristics that make it more attractive than gold, in my opinion. It is easy to transact in, and there are various financial services that allow users to buy things with it. And compared to gold, Bitcoin is more divisible and portable. These traits will likely be valued highly.\n\nAfter such a strong start to the year, Bitcoin appears to be taking a breather. Investors who are still bullish should take advantage of the recent dip."

        "content": "The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has flagged six Bitcoin (BTC) wallets linked to North Korean state-backed hacking group Lazarus. The six wallets contain 1,580 BTC worth $40 million believed to be hoarded from various cryptocurrency hacks over the past year.\n\nThe FBI in its investigation found that Lazarus Group moved approximately 1,580 BTC linked with several crypto exploits. These funds are currently sitting in the following Bitcoin addresses:\n\n3LU8wRu4ZnXP4UM8Yo6kkTiGHM9BubgyiG\n\n39idqitN9tYNmq3wYanwg3MitFB5TZCjWu\n\n3AAUBbKJorvNhEUFhKnep9YTwmZECxE4Nk\n\n3PjNaSeP8GzLjGeu51JR19Q2Lu8W2Te9oc\n\n3NbdrezMzAVVfXv5MTQJn4hWqKhYCTCJoB\n\n34VXKa5upLWVYMXmgid6bFM4BaQXHxSUoL\n\nThe FBI warned crypto companies that the movement of funds linked to the infamous North Korean hacking group could be a sign that they are looking to sell. The federal investigation agency advised crypto companies to keep an eye out for the six BTC wallets and use blockchain data to keep track of any movement of funds.\n\n\u201cPrivate sector entities should examine the blockchain data associated with these addresses and be vigilant in guarding against transactions directly with, or derived from, the addresses.\u201d\n\nThe North Korean hacking group has been actively involved in multiple crypto-linked exploits over the years, stealing billions of dollars worth of crypto assets. A recent report from TRM Labs suggests that the North Korean hackers have stolen nearly $2 billion in crypto since 2018. The group was most active in 2022, having stolen nearly $1 billion worth of crypto assets last year alone.\n\n2022 saw some of the biggest decentralized finance (DeFi) exploits, and Lazarus Group was identified as the mastermind behind Harmony\u2019s Horizon bridge and Sky Mavis\u2019 $625-million hack on Ethereum-linked sidechain Ronin Bridge last year.\n\nRelated: \u2018Nobody is holding them back\u2019 \u2014 North Korean cyber-attack threat rises\n\nAlthough crypto-linked exploits due to code vulnerabilities in platforms and protocols have increased due to the sophistication in methods used by these hackers, blockchain technology still makes it problematic for exploiters to launder or move their ill-gotten gains due to the public ledger that makes it possible to track the movement of funds.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies like the FBI, along with crypto companies, have worked together on several occasions in the past to freeze funds linked to such exploits. Earlier in February this year, Huobi and Binance froze $1.4 million worth of crypto assets linked to North Korea. Similarly, $63 million worth of assets linked to the Harmony Bridge hack was also frozen by crypto exchanges.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Deposit risk: What do crypto exchanges really do with your money?"

Markets await US Fed Chair Powell\u2019s speech at an annual conference this Friday to determine its direction with clarity on macro-economic trends,\" Vikram Subburaj, CEO, Giottus Crypto Platform, said.The market cap of bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, was around $515 billion. Bitcoin's dominance is currently 48.36%, an increase of 0.07% over the day, according to CoinMarketCap.Bitcoin has been trading above the $26000 level. This could be indicative of the market awaiting a decision on the Bitcoin-ETF in the US, Edul Patel, CEO and co-founder of Mudrex said.Ethereum continues to trade above the $1600 mark. Altcoins like Stellar and Hedera saw more than 5% growth in the last 24 hours. This renewed interest in altcoins and AI-related cryptocurrencies could be because of AI and computer-chip giant Nvidia reporting Q2 revenue of $13.51 billion versus consensus estimates of $11.19 billion, Edul said.Bitcoin's recent sideways movement following a significant drop on August 17th indicates uncertainty among both bullish and bearish participants. Consequently, it's wise to await a breakout before making substantial trading decisions.The elongated lower shadow on Bitcoin's candlestick chart for August 22nd is a positive signal, suggesting strong efforts from bulls to defend the $24,800 support level. Nonetheless, bullish momentum will remain subdued until the price surpasses the resistance levels at $26,833 and subsequently the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $27,777.

        "title": "Scrap solution: Burning tires to mine bitcoin - Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists",
        "content": "Photo by Zachary Keimig on Unsplash\n\nA bitcoin mine located at a waste coal power plant in Pennsylvania wants to add a new fuel to its power generation mix: scrap tires.\n\nStronghold Digital Mining describes itself as an \u201cenvironmentally beneficial\u201d bitcoin miner. But during a virtual press conference on Monday, Russell Zerbo, an advocate at Clean Air Council, said the facility, Panther Creek, had received at least seven air quality violations since it was acquired by the cryptocurrency mining company in 2021.\n\nThe press conference brought together representatives of local and national environmental organizations, including Earthjustice and PennFuture, along with residents of Carbon County\u2014where the plant is located\u2014to ask the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to reject Stronghold\u2019s permit application for this new fuel source.\n\nTires are a significant waste problem: The United States generates some 300 million scrap tires every year. According to the EPA, burning scrap tires is better than dumping them in a landfill, but not as beneficial as finding ways to reuse or recycle them. In a landfill, the flammable materials that tires are made of can pose a risk of uncontrolled tire fires. Abandoned tires can also become breeding grounds for disease vectors like mosquitoes.\n\nAnother problem is that the burning of tires releases a number of air pollutants. In addition to the usual pollutants and greenhouse gases associated with burning fossil fuels\u2014such as carbon oxides, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides\u2014burning tires can also release polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), along with other hazardous air pollutants and metals. Many PAHs are carcinogenic, but as the environmental organizations protesting Stronghold\u2019s application point out, Panther Creek does not monitor releases of these pollutants.\n\nStronghold is hardly the first company to think of burning tires to mine cryptocurrencies. In 2017, Vice News reported that the company Standard American Mining had partnered with PRTI, a tire \u201cthermal demanufacturing\u201d company based in North Carolina. Both the websites for Standard American Mining and the company that apparently acquired them are now nonoperational, but PRTI was still burning tires to mine cryptocurrency as recently as 2021.\n\nMel Magazine reported on another company in Texas, XcelPlus International Inc., which claimed it could convert all kinds of waste and garbage, including tires, and convert it to fuel to mine bitcoin. That company\u2019s website is now also defunct, but an archived snapshot shows the company boasted that this would net them carbon credits, tax credits, and waste disposal fees.\n\nAs I previously reported for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, the history of bitcoin mining has been a race to find the cheapest energy available. Increasingly, miners have resorted to acquiring the means of power production themselves. Some have purchased retired power plants, others have installed generators at gas wells, mining bitcoin at the source. Tire-derived fuels are cheaper than other fossil fuels, so the trend of bitcoin miners chasing cheap energy continues.\n\nEven though recycling scrap tires is considered superior, this can also come with risks. Artificial turf made in part from recycled tires can release acutely toxic levels of metals like copper and zinc into stormwater, which if it flows into streams or other bodies of water, can be toxic to aquatic life. Home gardeners have even been warned to not use tires as cheap raised beds because they contain aluminum, cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, selenium, and sulfur, which can be released into the water and soil as the tires break down.\n\nEven if there are few good options for disposing of scrap tires, environmental advocates have asked Pennsylvania\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection to consider the use to which the energy produced at Panther Creek is being put. Electricity generation powers homes and businesses, and until the transition to renewable energy is complete, burning fossil fuels could arguably be necessary, to a certain degree. But using it to mine cryptocurrency is of little to no use for the residents of Carbon County.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency is a completely useless private product that provides absolutely no benefit to residents currently impacted by Panther Creek\u2019s incineration of waste coal,\u201d Zerbo said. He argued that as such, the plant should be permitted as a solid waste incinerator, which would be subject to more air pollution monitoring requirements than a power plant.\n\nLinda Christman, a resident of Carbon County and president of the local environmental group Save Carbon County, pointed out that Carbon County is among the poorest counties in the state of Pennsylvania, making this an environmental justice issue. She said that 36 percent of the population within a mile of Panther Creek are living under the federal poverty level. \u201cThat may lead companies like Panther Creek to think that they can get away with anything,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to say, \u2018no.\u2019\u201d"

        "content": "Shares of bitcoin miners are, not surprisingly, highly correlated to spot bitcoin prices. With that trait in mind, it\u2019s expected that these stocks ebb and flow with the largest cryptocurrency.\n\nFor the stocks and exchange traded funds such as the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) , those correlations are double-edged swords. They\u2019re great when Bitcoin is rising and dangerous when the token slumps.\n\nThose dangers were on display during the crypto winter of 2022. It appears some crypto miners, including some SATO holdings, learned a valuable lesson and working to diversify their revenue streams. Alone, that\u2019s a positive. But when considering where some SATO member firms are turning to broaden sales avenues, the allure increases. They\u2019re turning to artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nMining-to-AI Transition Makes Sense\n\nExperienced investors know that bitcoin mining is a technology-intensive industry, requiring expensive, sophisticated semiconductors and high-level computing power. Because SATO holdings already possess those wares, the transition to the AI realm is practical and smooth.\n\nAdditionally, both bitcoin mining and AI require language learning models, meaning the former industry has synergies with the latter. In fact, a recent report by JPMorgan indicates that some miners have recently been selling crypto holdings to speed up AI entries.\n\n\u201cWith the rapid growth of AI, the increased demand for HPC is now opening a new and perhaps more profitable avenue for utilizing GPUs previously used for Ethereum mining,\u201d according to the bank.\n\n\u201cHPC\u201d means high-performance computing \u2013 a staple of both crypto mining and AI. Currently, some bitcoin and ethereum miners are testing established HPC capabilities to see if they\u2019re AI-ready. Importantly, initial testing is revealing profitability \u2013 something that\u2019s often evasive in the crypto mining space.\n\n\u201cIn these beta tests, miners are reporting high profitability per unit of power consumption, much above the profitability from bitcoin mining. With bitcoin miners having already secured more than 100MW of long-term contracts with their power grids, if the profitability reported in beta tests is able to be repeated in large scale it would overshadow in the future the revenues coming from bitcoin mining at the moment,\u201d added JPMorgan.\n\nMiners\u2019 ability to find new sources of revenue is important for another reason. The 2024 bitcoin halving is expected to make the mining process of the largest digital currency costlier and less rewarding. That could be all the impetus some SATO constituents need to forge further into AI.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel .\n\nvettafi.com is owned by VettaFi LLC (\u201cVettaFi\u201d).

The Swiss-based crypto service is available to private banking customers only. Now, however, BBVA has introduced to its product range in Spain the financial instrument Fidelity Physical Bitcoin ETN (Exchange Traded Note), a publicly traded ETN issued by the asset manager Fidelity Exchange Traded Products GmbH. The ETN tracks the performance of bitcoin, net of management fees and operating costs.\n\nTrading orders on this ETN can be placed only online or via the BBVA smartphone app by individual customers interested in crypto-assets who have qualified under the suitability assessment mandated by MiFID regulations. The instrument is not considered suitable for investors who are unfamiliar with the specific nature and risks of ETNs and crypto-assets, so the bank's physical branch offices and personal banking managers will neither offer the product nor advise on it.\n\nTrading delivers the same user experience as any other exchange-traded security. Trading in the ETN is subject to the opening and closing hours of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (09:00-17:30 CET), so, after closing, orders cannot be placed until the next business day.\n\nCustomers can track their investment from their overall BBVA securities position, along with the rest of their asset portfolio. BBVA thus remains at the forefront in the adoption of blockchain technology and in offering the most cutting-edge products in the market, while always providing the highest standard of customer safeguards.\n\n\"This ETN issued by Fidelity means that BBVA customers in Spain who, being aware of the risks of this type of investment, wish to expose part of their investments to bitcoin, can now trade using the app and the website,\" says Francisco Maroto, Head of Blockchain and Digital Assets at BBVA. \"With the addition of this product, we continue to advance our goal of giving our customers access to new digital asset markets.\u201d\n\nFidelity Physical Bitcoin ETN is regulated and supervised by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) of Germany and has been registered with the Comisi\u00f3n Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV) in Spain by means of the EEA passporting procedure."

        "content": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation has published information on six cryptocurrency wallets operated by North Korean hackers and believed to be holding stolen funds.\n\nThe cryptocurrency addresses, the FBI says, hold roughly 1,580 Bitcoin that are likely related to the recent theft of cryptocurrency assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n\u201cOver the last 24 hours, the FBI tracked cryptocurrency stolen by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK) TraderTraitor-affiliated actors (also known as Lazarus Group and APT38). The FBI believes the DPRK may attempt to cash out the bitcoin worth more than $40 million dollars,\u201d the FBI says.\n\nAccording to the agency, TraderTraitor-affiliated hackers stole $60 million and $37 million in cryptocurrency from Alphapo and CoinsPaid in July, and $100 million from Atomic Wallet in June.\n\nPreviously, the hackers stole crypto assets in attacks against Harmony\u2019s Horizon bridge and Sky Mavis\u2019 Ronin Bridge.\n\n\u201cPrivate sector entities should examine the blockchain data associated with these addresses and be vigilant in guarding against transactions directly with, or derived from, the addresses,\u201d the FBI says.\n\nIn April 2023, the US government warned that the North Korea-linked Lazarus Group, which has been blamed for numerous high-profile cyberattacks, was targeting entities and exchanges in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry to generate and launder funds.\n\nBased on the shared indicators of compromise associated with this campaign, which the US government named TraderTraitor, GitHub linked North Korea to social engineering attacks targeting employees at technology firms in July.\n\nAdvertisement.

        "title": "ARK, Glassnode propose Bitcoin economic analytics framework using new metric - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "ARK Invest and Glassnode have released white papers describing a proposed framework for analyzing Bitcoin on-chain metrics. The new method is called Cointime Economics and introduces a new measure \u2014 the coinblock \u2014 to represent the state of the Bitcoin (BTC) network.\n\nCointime Economics can be used to represent Bitcoin\u2019s economic state in place of outstanding supply. The use of the new system may improve valuation metrics and provide a new analytical tool to measure Bitcoin activity, according to authors David Puell of ARK Invest and James Check of Glassnode. They said:\n\n\u201cThe importance of a single bitcoin should vary based on the last time it moved. Upon its transfer, for example, the information value of a bitcoin that had been unmoved for 10 years is more important than one that had been unmoved for 1 week.\u201d\n\nThe reasoning behind this supposition is found in a footnote:\n\n\u201cCoins held for a prolonged period of time suggest ownership by the market cohort with the longest time investment horizon and the most profitable cost basis. They therefore display the market behavior of the largest capitalized and historically most savvy market participants in Bitcoin\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nThus, when long-dormant Bitcoin is moved, it is likely to be the action of hodlers and whales, and so is more significant than actions with more newly mined Bitcoin. Lost Bitcoin does not count at all.\n\nA coinblock is the basic unit used for calculation. It is determined by multiplying the number of Bitcoin by the number of blocks (the basic unit of mining) produced while the Bitcoin sits idle. \u201cBecause the Bitcoin network produces a block every 10 minutes on average, one coin generates approximately 144 coinblocks per day: 6 blocks produced per hour multiplied by 24 hours,\u201d the authors write.\n\nCoinblocks are \u201cdestroyed\u201d in line with the length of time the Bitcoin was held: \u201cIf two bitcoins had not moved in seven blocks and then transacted, for example, 14 coinblocks would have been destroyed.\u201d Bitcoin that had been held longer thus produces a larger number of coinblocks destroyed, pointing to higher activity by hodlers. Coinblocks destroyed is a variation of coindays destroyed, a metric that Glassnode already employs.\n\nAll Bitcoin coinblocks. Source: ARK Investment Management\n\nIn comparison, the traditional unspent transaction output (UTXO) model, which is essential to many settlement systems, gives all Bitcoin equal weight. Because of this difference, the overall amount of active and inactive Bitcoins is represented differently in the two models, giving differing views of the market.\n\nRelated: Brace for BTC price volatility? Bitcoin \u2018coin days destroyed\u2019 metric jumps to 2-month highs\n\nUnder UTXO, inactive Bitcoin is that which miners have not spent. In Cointime Economics, it is the so-called \u201cvaulted supply,\u201d which is the total number of coinblocks created divided by the total number not destroyed (that is, \u201cstored\u201d).\n\nIs Bitcoin\u2019s inflation rate underestimated? ARK's @dpuellARK and @glassnode's @_Checkmatey_ explain why this may be the case in our new white paper, Cointime Economics. https://t.co/bdkmARE4HY \u2014 ARK Invest (@ARKInvest) August 24, 2023\n\nThe white paper provides three use cases to demonstrate the utility of Cointime Economics. A more advanced version of the paper for blockchain specialists is also available from Glassnode, along with a suite of Cointime Economics metrics.\n\nARK Invest is the investment management company founded by Cathie Wood. Glassnode is a Swiss-based market intelligence service.\n\nMagazine: Recursive inscriptions: Bitcoin \u2018supercomputer\u2019 and BTC DeFi coming soon"

        "content": "Why Bitcoin Mining from Home Can Still Be Profitable In Latin AmericaPhoto: Valeria Mongelli/Bloomberg(Bloomberg/Valeria Mongelli)\n\nThe price of the most popular cryptocurrency is still far from its all-time high, but in countries where energy is cheap, mining at home can still be profitable\n\nWhy Bitcoin Mining from Home Can Still Be Profitable In Latin America\n\nBloomberg L\u00ednea \u2014 Bitcoin (XBT) has seen a price recovery in 2023, gaining almost 60% from December 2022 to date, but it remains 61% below its all-time high of $67,734.04. However, the low cost of energy in some Latin American countries allows home mining of the most popular cryptocurrency to continue to be profitable in some countries.\n\nVIEW + How Latin America\u2019s First Ever Stablecoin Could Trigger a Crypto Battle The Argentine cryptocurrency company Ripio announced that it has launched what is considered the first Latin American stablecoin, called \"Criptodolar\", what are the implications?\n\nAccording to information published by crypto data aggregator Coingecko regarding how much money has to be spent mining to obtain a bitcoin in different global locations.\n\nCoingecko estimates that a lone miner needs an average of 266,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity to mine a single bitcoin. This process would take approximately seven years to complete, which would amount to a monthly electricity consumption of about 143 kWh. From this, it took the cost per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for each country (using global oil prices as a source, with prices updated to December 2022) to estimate how much it costs to mine this cryptocurrency.\n\nVIEW + US Probes Puerto Rico Tax Breaks That Lured Crypto Traders, Fund Managers The controversial tax breaks are designed to bring wealthy Americans to a US territory fresh out of bankruptcy and where more than 40% of residents live in poverty\n\nIn which countries is it profitable to mine bitcoin?\n\nTo August 23, 2023, one bitcoin cost $26,592. In which countries of Latin America is it possible to mine below that price?\n\nPUBLICIDAD\n\nCuba: $7,989\n\n$7,989 Argentina : $9,040\n\n: $9,040 Venezuela : $12,240\n\n: $12,240 Paraguay: $14,630\n\nThe margin is so high that, even with price readjustments, it is most likely that with bitcoin close to $27,000 in all these countries home mining will continue to be profitable.\n\nIn Mexico, for example, the price of energy ($26,340 to mine a bitcoin) is practically at the same value as the cost of mining, so it would not make sense to do so, unless there is a significant rise in the price of the cryptocurrency. Something similar occurs in Ecuador ($25,540 per bitcoin mined).\n\nHow much electricity is needed to mine 1 Bitcoin?\n\n\n\nAs a solo miner, an average of 266,000 kWh of electricity is required to mine a 1 $BTC. This process spans about 7 years, with a monthly electricity consumption of around 143 kWh.\n\n\n\nRead the full study: https://t.co/J0zATdjsb1 pic.twitter.com/XiaFwHispF \u2014 CoinGecko (@coingecko) August 23, 2023\n\nIn contrast, in Uruguay energy costs mean each bitcoin would cost $67,300 to mine, meaning that it would make no sense to do so unless the crypto currency returns to its all-time high.\n\nPUBLICIDAD\n\nHow much would it cost to mine bitcoin in other Latin American countries?\n\nChile : $49,210\n\n: $49,210 Colombia : $47,610\n\n: $47,610 Brazil : $45,490\n\n: $45,490 Dominican Republic: $32,720\n\nThe world\u2019s cheapest countries for bitcoin mining\n\nWhile energy subsidies in some Latin American countries make mining profitable, nothing compares to Lebanon, where mining one bitcoin can cost as little as $266.02, according to Coingecko\u2019s data.\n\nIn Iran, too, it is a profitable business, as the cost of energy makes mining the most popular crypto unit cost $532.04.\n\nIn Syria it would cost $1,330.10, with the following countries also profitable markets for mining:\n\nEthiopia: $1,596.12\n\nSudan: $2,128.17\n\nLibya: $2,660.21\n\nKyrgyzstan: $2,660.21\n\nAngola: $3,724.29\n\nZimbabwe: $3,990.31\n\nBhutan: $4,256.33"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes believes the Federal Reserve will lose its quest to beat inflation, ultimately benefiting \u201crisk assets of finite supply,\u201d such as Bitcoin.\n\nIn a blog post published on Wednesday, the essayist argued that the Fed is sucking money from one area of the economy while injecting money into another.\n\nAs long as the Fed\u2019s strategy to combat inflation remains \u201cquixotic,\u201d assets like Bitcoin will likely rise in the long run.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBitcoin has a finite supply, and therefore as the denominator of fiat toilet paper grows, so will Bitcoin\u2019s value in fiat currency terms,\u201d Hayes wrote. Aside from big tech and crypto, the ex-CEO believes nothing will yield a better return for investors besides parking their money at Fed and earning nearly 6% yield.\n\nHe went on to explain why the Fed\u2019s tactics have been flawed.\n\nSpecifically, by continually raising its Reverse Repo Program (RRP) and Interest on Reserve Balances (IORB), the central bank is forced to pay out billions more per month to depositors, which counteracts the Fed\u2019s effect on the money supply from quantitative tightening (QT; selling bonds on the open market).\n\n\u201cIf the Fed believes that to kill inflation it must both raise interest rates and reduce the size of its balance sheet, then it is cutting its nose to spite its face,\u201d wrote Hayes.\n\nThe central bank\u2019s approach differs from Paul Volcker \u2013 a former central bank chairman credited with crushing inflation in the 1980s through hawkish monetary policy. As Hayes explained, while the Fed in the 1980s may have adjusted its policy rate, it did not micromanage RRP and IORB rates to match it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe only variable that changed from the Fed\u2019s perspective was the size of its balance sheet,\u201d said Hayes.\n\nAt present, the Fed is draining $80 billion per month from the market through QT, while injecting $22.53 billion into banks. Though this still appears \u201crestrictive,\u201d Hayes estimated that the rising interest expense on U.S. government debt is putting another $80 billion per month back into the economy. \u201cI estimate that ~$23 billion in liquidity is net injected every month,\u201d he said.\n\nEventually, Hayes said he expects the Fed to reverse course on QT as the U.S. Treasury becomes replete with alternative buyers of its debt, and grows desperate to avoid a cataclysmic default. That said, the market doesn\u2019t seem to acknowledge this as imminent, and thus hasn't moved its capital into Bitcoin \u2013 yet.\n\n\u201cWe gotta go down to go up,\u201d concluded Hayes. \u201cI\u2019m not going to fight the market, but just sit tight and accept my stimmies.\u201d"

        "title": "Cryptocurrency bitcoin's price tumbles again, but fans say it's a buying opportunity ahead of next 'halving' - The Australian Financial Review",
        "content": "But Nick Bishop, a professional bond trader turned founder of crypto consultancy NotCentralised, says the halving will not necessarily mean a surge in bitcoin price in the second half of 2024.\n\nThe former investment banking head at Gresham Partners adds that evidence suggests some professional crypto traders try to front-run hype around the halving by selling to less sophisticated investors in the months before the anticipated event.\n\nIndeed, historical bitcoin price charts around the time of the last three supply halvings \u2013 in November 2012, July 2016 and May 2020 \u2013 suggest investors tend to take profits by selling as excitement builds ahead of halving events.\n\n\u201cTo anyone who wants to act like a price sage, I would respectfully point out we\u2019ve only had three data points from past halvings so far,\u201d Bishop says.\n\n\u201cHowever, what we can say from those three instances is bitcoin prices peaked about 12 to 15 months before the halving event. Then, between three and six months after a halving event, the price has recovered to the prior peak that occurred 12 to 15 months before the halving.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRisk proxy\n\nBishop says arguably a bigger driver of bitcoin\u2019s price is its increasing correlation to other risk assets such as equities in traditional finance. That is, as big institutions such as BlackRock get involved, the bitcoin price is more likely to track traditional assets such as shares.\n\nOnline data shows a large proportion of the 19.5 million bitcoins in circulation are locked in cold storage or have not moved for more than six months, which suggests they\u2019re owned by long-term holders \u2013 \u201chodlers\u201d in crypto slang \u2013 with little interest in selling.\n\nAs a consequence, large institutional adopters in traditional finance such as Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Investments or the world\u2019s largest asset manager BlackRock may be left scrambling to buy a relatively small free float of bitcoins estimated at between 2 million to 5 million.\n\n\u201cThe more institutional interest we get, the more they\u2019re chasing a somewhat constrained supply,\u201d Bishop says.\n\n\u201cSo, in a simplistic sense, if bitcoin demand stays the same then a halving means a higher price. But you\u2019ve got all these real-world market interactions, the macro uncertainty, and the fact cryptocurrencies are highly correlated to risk assets. And as more institutions lean into bitcoin products like ETFs that will increase.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe halving of the bitcoin awarded for verifying transactions occurs each time 210,000 separate blocks in its blockchain are mined, which is roughly every four years based on the 10-minute average time it takes the network\u2019s hash rate (total computer power) to mine a single block.\n\nAccording to Caroline Bowler, the chief executive of Australian crypto exchange BTC Markets, a smooth halving event should support the bitcoin price over the long term.\n\n\u201cI run BTC Markets, so I have to be bullish bitcoin,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThe halving is indicative of the fact bitcoin is a young technology and does what it says it will do, which is the expectation in the market. But if we saw problems, there would be immediate downward pressure on the price.\u201d\n\nThe appeal of get-rich-quick and the public\u2019s increasing cynicism around central banks\u2019 money printing to support government spending has helped bitcoin\u2019s price to rise more than 200 times in value over the past 10 years since August 2013.\n\nStill, its future as a decentralised, apolitical and slightly crazy experiment in human psychology remains uncertain."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA contentious debate stirred last week after a report surfaced showing Bitcoin Ordinal sales volumes had dropped 97% from May to August.\n\nDappRadar\u2019s report indicated \u201cdeclining interest\u201d in the wider NFT space, with trading volume for unique active wallets on Ethereum and Polygon dropping by 22% and 60%, respectively.\n\nFigures for Ordinals were purportedly far more pronounced, however.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin Ordinals are Bitcoin\u2019s version of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). They are digital artifacts inscribed onto individual satoshis, the smallest denomination of a Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nPer DappRadar, unique active wallets for Ordinals also fell from their June peak of 85,316 to just 6,708 as of August 14, marking a whopping 92% drop.\n\nAs expected, these numbers led some to speculate that Ordinals are dead, landing hefty pushback from some in the Ordinals community.\n\nBitcoin entrepreneur and head of the Bitcoin Frontier Fund Trevor Owens fought the FUD with a lengthy Twitter post claiming DappRadar\u2019s report had been a \u201chit piece\u201d with \u201chighly inaccurate\u201d information.\n\nHe told Decrypt that he would \u201chave liked to find some value\u201d in the report, but \u201cwhen the data is wrong it\u2019s difficult to find anything redeeming,\u201d claiming there are \u201cclear indexing errors in their tech.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOrdinals, apples and oranges\n\nSeveral other on-chain data providers offered different figures than those published by DappRadar.\n\nFor example, Crypto Slam, a multi-chain NFT data provider, has sales volumes for May sitting at $195 million, a far cry from the $452 million reported by DappRadar.\n\nA Dune Analytics dashboard puts Ordinals sales volumes for May at roughly $154 million, closer in line with Crypto Slam\u2019s figures.\n\nJuly volumes on Crypto Slam were $65 million, while DappRadar\u2019s report showed $35 million. Although the Dune dashboard clocks $50 million, the percentage drops, again, line up with Crypto Slam rather than DappRadar.\n\nCross-referencing between Crypto Slam and Dune Analytics, both indicate a May to July drop of 67% and 69% in sales volume, respectively.\n\nIt\u2019s still quite a brutal fall, but it showcases a vast difference from DappRadar\u2019s 92% figure.\n\nBeyond these figures, what raised the most red flags for Ordinals fans was comparing entire months to just two weeks in August. For Owens, \u201cthe calculation that determined the 97% [drop] was based on 14 days in August and 31 days in May\u201d was the most egregious bit of the report.\n\nSeveral other prominent Bitcoin Ordinal fans echoed the sentiment, including Doggfather, the pseudonymous creator of the Frens Protocol, an Ordinals-based social graph on Bitcoin. He told Decrypt that \u201cthe most obvious error of the reporting was comparing full months to August\u2019s fifteen days.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJake Gallen, head of NFT and Strategy at Emblem, a tool that lets users store tokens across blockchains, also told Decrypt the numbers aren\u2019t entirely right. \u201cThey included BRC-20 transaction volume data in some areas but not others,\u201d he explained, adding that \u201cvolume is down but there are also tens of thousands of transactions per day.\u201d\n\n'Ordinals an odd beast', says DappRadar\n\nSenior Communications Manager for DappRadar, Robert Hoogendoorn told Decrypt \u201cOrdinals are an odd beast,\u201d which require a \u201cunique methodology.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t label the current discussion as a controversy, and that they \u201caim to be open and transparent about how we track things.\u201d\n\nHoogendoorn shared a prepared statement from DappRadar that countered the \"strong criticism from Ordinals community members questioning the credibility of our data and analysis.\"\n\n\"Our team members are experienced Web3 analysts and reporters\u201d and \"the data published is accurate,\" reads the statement.\n\nAlthough DappRadar acknowledged \u201cpotential discrepancies,\u201d due to BRC-20 swaps made through marketplaces, the team explained that \"we\u2019re mainly focusing on NFTs [and] Inscriptions. Unlike other platforms that track transactions not visible on the block explorer and which remain unconfirmed, we\u2019ve chosen to exclude such data.\"\n\nThat said, neither Hoogendoorn nor DappRadar addressed the concerns regarding reporting on numbers for an incomplete month for August.\n\n\"What\u2019s more, DappRadar tracks trades on marketplaces such as Unisat and Ordinals Wallets, markets that peaked earlier this year and were perhaps not covered by competitors,\" the statement continues.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRegardless of which numbers users turn to, though, the reality is still pretty bleak for Ordinals. But that's true for much of the industry.\n\nAccording to Isabel Foxen Duke, former communications director for the Ordinals protocol, the market \u201cis down after a hype cycle,\u201d but she told Decrypt \u201cIt\u2019s hard to take seriously the idea that Ordinals are going away.\u201d\n\n\u201cHistorical inscriptions will always have value to collectors at a certain price,\u201d she concluded."

The firm filed to issue the exchange-traded funds with the SEC earlier this month and will be the advisor to the funds. 21Shares and ARK, which have teamed up on other bitcoin ETF applications, will perform subadvisor roles.\n\nFirms like BlackRock Inc., Fidelity, and Invesco have been rushing to roll out digital asset ETF products as the Securities and Exchange Commission faces mounting pressure to greenlight an array of cryptocurrency funds. The Empowered fund filings come as a slew of firms, including ARK and 21Shares, await approval for a spot bitcoin ETF. Empowered is seeking to launch ETFs that track bitcoin futures contracts, as opposed to spot ETFs that track physical bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin ETFs on the Horizon\n\nThe ARK 21Shares Active Bitcoin Futures ETF will invest in bitcoin futures contracts and serve as the underlying fund for the other two products set to launch. The ARK 21Shares Active On-Chain Bitcoin Strategy ETF will allocate at least 25% of its assets in its Digital Asset and Blockchain Strategy ETF. The third ETF, the ARK 21Shares Digital Asset and Blockchain Strategy ETF, will also invest in the Active Bitcoin Futures ETF. The funds can also invest in Treasury securities, according to their prospectus.\n\nWhile investors are anticipating a spot bitcoin decision, other firms are taking advantage of increased interest in the space to launch new products. The first and largest futures bitcoin fund is the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which has $955 million in assets.\n\nProShares saw significant first-mover benefits by being the first to launch a bitcoin futures ETF, seeing millions in deposits on the first day it hit the market. Some speculate the SEC will approve multiple spot bitcoins at once to avoid one firm getting the vast majority of market share.\n\nStory continues\n\nContact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2023 etf.com.

This means these investors would be in an unrealized loss position if the coin\u2019s value fell.\n\nNoting that this behavior was common among BTC\u2019s short-term holders, Glassnode found that:\n\n\u201cSharp upticks in STH Supply in Loss tend to follow \u2018top heavy markets\u2019 such as May 2021, Dec 2021, and again this week.\u201d\n\n\u201cOut of the 2.56M BTC held by STHs, only 300k BTC (11.7%) is still in profit,\u201d Glassnode added.\n\nFurther, Glassnode assessed the Profit or Loss Bias (dominance) of STH volumes flowing into exchanges and found the profit dominance of STH volumes flowing into exchanges has been on a consistent decline since BTC\u2019s value began its uptrend in January.\n\nThis is because many investors that comprise the STH cohort of BTC holders have continued to buy the coin at \u201can increasingly elevated cost basis.\u201d\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nWith last week not being any different:\n\n\u201cWe saw the largest loss dominance reading since the March sell-off to $19.8k. This suggests that the STH cohort are both largely underwater on their holdings and increasingly price sensitive.\u201d\n\nThis tells us that the current BTC market is becoming more top-heavy. With STHs prone to more losses because they keep buying at the top, BTC\u2019s price might struggle to grow in the meantime.\n\nPointing out that last week\u2019s price fall was \u201cone to keep a close eye on,\u201d Glassnode found that loss momentum and dominance amongst BTC short-term holders have surged. When this happened in May and December 2021, it was followed by \u201cmore violent downtrends\u201d in BTC\u2019s value."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) price has entered into a slump after a prolonged accumulation. After a boring sideways price action in the past few months, the biggest cryptocurrency experienced a flash crash last week. BTC price dipped below the key psychological level of $25,000 on some exchanges before stabilising around $26,000.\n\nAfter a 0.24% drop on Monday, the pioneering digital asset extended its loss by another 0.11% on Tuesday. At press time, the token is changing hands at $26,095 just before the start of the New York session. Technical analysis reveals that the bears are in business after a change in market structure.\n\nBTC Dominance Drops To 49%\n\nThe sideways movement of BTC to USD sucked the air out of most altcoins. This resulted in an increase in BTC dominance which is now up 17% since the start of 2023. However, due to an intense sell-off last week, the dominance of the top cryptocurrency fell to 49%. This translated into a weekly loss of 2.45%.\n\nThe following chart reveals the correction in Bitcoin dominance, which shows the BTC\u2019s share in the total crypto market capitalization. However, despite the decreasing dominance, altcoins have failed to catch a bid. It shows that the capital has moved to stablecoins instead of other altcoins. A 9% increase in the USDT dominance last week is proof of this thesis.\n\nBitcoin Price Falls Below 200 MA\n\nA look at the following Bitcoin price chart on a weekly timeframe reveals that the price has broken below the 200 MA. This key moving average is a major line in the sand for many mid-term holders and swing traders. A breakdown below this level has validated the bearish thesis putting more downside on the cards.\n\nThe 200 moving average on the weekly chart currently lies at $27,500. If the bears fail to break above this level soon, the next stop could be the 50 MA which lies at $23,800. This would mean a potential 8% downside from here. The only silver lining for the bulls is that the price has still not made a lower low on the weekly timeframe. A weekly closure below $24,770 could be the final nail in the bulls\u2019 coffin.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction Flips Bearish On Daily Chart\n\nThe daily chart analysis gives an even more bearish outlook than the weekly chart. BTC price has also dropped below 200 MA on the daily timeframe. This has flipped the Bitcoin price prediction bearish on the daily chart. It shows that the bulls have totally lost the momentum that was gained after the biggest asset manager, Blackrock, filed for a spot BTC ETF in June 2023.\n\nMy biggest fear is an acceptance back in the $25,100-17,600 trading range. BTC to USD broke out of this trading range in March 2023. In case of a bounce from current levels, the most critical will be the retest of the $27,500 level.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The Bitcoin community spread a news story that a mysterious $3 billion BTC wallet, labeled as the cryptocurrency\u2019s third-largest hodler, belongs to Gemini instead of BlackRock.\n\nSo BlackRock still does not own any Bitcoin?\n\nLet\u2019s see all the details together.\n\nBitcoin News: $3 billion crypto-wallet is not BlackRock\u2019s, but Gemini\u2019s\n\nYesterday\u2019s Bitcoin news covered a mysterious crypto-wallet worth more than $3 billion that possibly could have belonged to the US investment company BlackRock.\n\nThe address in question reportedly began accumulating Bitcoin for the first time on 8 March 2023, becoming the cryptocurrency\u2019s 3rd largest hodler in just a few months, coming to own a whopping 118,300 BTC equivalent to $3.09 billion.\n\nThe rumors of alleged connection with the world\u2019s largest hedge fund began to surface in the late evening of Monday, 21 August after several Twitter profiles had begun to suspect Larry Fink\u2019s hand.\n\nThis unknown address has accumulated over $3 Billion worth of #Bitcoin in the last 3 months.\n\n\n\nThe prime suspect?\n\n\n\nThe first major transaction of 3400 BTC occurred on May 16th 2023. Almost exactly 1 month later on June 15th 2023, BlackRock filed for it's spot #Bitcoin ETF. pic.twitter.com/TdFuUkELuH \u2014 DivXMaN (@crypto_div) August 21, 2023\n\nThe strangest thing about this affair is indeed the timing with which the owner of the address allegedly began to heavily accumulate its holdings, since the largest transaction that took place was on 16 May, just a month before BlackRock\u2019s application for a Bitcoin spot ETF to the SEC.\n\nAs many as 3,400 BTC were in fact bought on that date, suggesting that the giant hedge fund had loaded up its positions before the market pumped due to the news regarding its entry into the industry.\n\nAs we are well aware, since mid-June the crypto market has charged one of the most important rallies of all 2023, with the premier cryptocurrency rising 15.65% during the week that the first application for a spot ETF in the United States was announced.\n\nMost likely Larry Fink and his partners bought Bitcoin before the market exploded to the upside, as advanced smart money in the financial world usually does.\n\nHowever, in reality, it seems that BlackRock had nothing to do with the $3 billion wallet and that the real holders are the famous Winklevoss twins with their cryptocurrency exchange Gemini.\n\nRegardless, BlackRock may still have bought the cryptocurrency secretly by diligently hiding its cryptographic footprints so as not to arouse suspicion and being able to move freely.\n\nLatest news says the 118,300 Bitcoin wallet belongs to Gemini and not Blackrock\n\nThe latest news from the crypto world indicates that the 118,300 Bitcoin wallet belongs to cryptocurrency exchange Gemini and not to hedge fund BlackRock.\n\nIt was the \u201cWu Blockchain\u201d Twitter profile that first mentioned the connection with the Winklevoss twins, which pointed out that some transfers from the US exchange platform dated 3 months ago had as their recipient the very address that now shares a $3 billion balance sheet.\n\nGemini has transferred bitcoins to the new address bc1q\u2026.59v2 in the past 3 months. It currently holds 118,000 bitcoins, or about 3.08 billion U.S. dollars. It is currently the third largest bitcoin holder. The first and second largest Bitcoin addresses are Binance Cold Wallet\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) August 22, 2023\n\nIt is often the case that for reasons of security or \u201clogistical convenience\u201d cryptocurrency exchanges periodically send their funds to new addresses, causing the countervalue of the latter to grow quickly.\n\nThe Bitcoin that the famous address has \u201caccumulated\u201d as of March 2023 are simply the assets of the exchange\u2019s users, among which you might be one if you are a Gemini customer.\n\nThe image below shows the performance of a cold wallet of the Winklevosses that from May 2023 onwards has completely emptied all its reserves reaching zero in the last days of June.\n\nThe transfers are all directed to the address \u201cbc1ql4,\u201d incorrectly attributed to the giant BlackRock.\n\nAs if that were not enough to create confusion among the community in this story, we can see how on-chain tracking firm Nansen labeled the $3 billion Bitcoin wallet under Robinhood\u2019s ownership.\n\nAccording to Nansen, the massive cryptocurrency holding would be under the domain of the US broker as \u201cJump Trading Custody\u201c\n\nIn reality, the transactions on the blockchain clearly show how Gemini is the real owner of the mysterious wallet.\n\nWe hope that Tyler or Cameron Winklevoss will clarify once and for all who is the third largest Bitcoin holder in the world.\n\nBTC balance sheet of exchange wallets\n\nAfter debunking the news of BlackRock\u2019s alleged hand in the $3 billion wallet and clarifying Gemini\u2019s true ownership, we can now devote a brief discussion to the topic of Bitcoin balance sheets of cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nSince 2014, major crypto exchange platforms have been accumulating positions in Bitcoin, becoming one of the largest aggregate entities in terms of cryptocurrency supply.\n\nIndeed, in March 2020, a period related to the dump of the markets at the time of the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak, exchanges such as Binance, Bitfinex, Bithumb, Bitmex, Coinbase, Gemini, Deribit, Kraken, and Kucoin reached the incredible aggregate sum of 3.2 million Bitcoin equivalent to 15.23% of the max supply of the digital gold.\n\nFrom that point on (classified as ATH of the exchanges\u2019 balance sheet) the numbers began to decline periodically to the current 2.28 million BTC.\n\nAs the 2020-2021 bull market bore fruit by raising crypto asset prices, exchanges decreased their share from HODLers, likely sold to the market for FIAT or stablecoins.\n\nTruth be told, even after the bullish market ended, this metric has continued to see the holdings of exchanges shrink in a trend that still has not stopped and appears to want to continue.\n\nFrom November 2021 onward, the ATH month for Bitcoin, about 500,000 coins have evaporated from exchange wallets.\n\nMost likely this wealth has ended up in the hands of individual holders who jealously guard their coins on personal wallets without risking handing over their private keys to third-party entities."

        "title": "Bitcoin mining difficulty reaches all-time high of 55 trillion hashes - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "The Bitcoin mining difficulty increased by 6.17% on August 22, reaching an all-time high of 55.62 trillion hashes, as the Bitcoin Network hashrate continues to rise despite past increases in the difficulty adjustment. And different than some might believe, this is usually not good for Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nDifficulty adjustment on Bitcoin mining is a protocol feature created by Satoshi Nakamoto that serves to keep an average interval of 10 minutes between every new block that is discovered by Bitcoin miners, filled with transactions, and then added to the blockchain. This adjustment directly impacts mining profitability, as increased difficulty also means increased costs for the activity.\n\nWith a sustained increase in mining difficulty over time, Bitcoin miners are working \u2018underwater\u2019, as the average cost to mine one single BTC has been superior to the average price of 1 BTC in the spot market year-over-year since August 2022. The Bitcoin Network now registers a hashrate of 446.6 EH/s (exahashes per second), with a mining difficulty of 55,621,444,139,429 hashes to find a block. Data was retrieved by Finbold from the mempool.space network explorer on August 23.\n\nHashrate and Difficulty chart. Source: Mempool.space\n\nWhy is increasing mining difficulty bad for Bitcoin?\n\nThe Bitcoin mining activity is a high-cost business model. That requires a physical structure, specialized equipment (known as ASICs), high consumption of energy, and specialized know-how.\n\nBitcoin miners \u2018mine\u2019 in the expectation of discovering the next block with the block subsidy of 6.25 BTC (~$162,500), which is then used to pay for the costs (usually in US dollars), and collect the profit (being in BTC or USD, according to miners choice). For every 210,000 blocks discovered, the block subsidy is halved (cut by half), in an event called \u2018Bitcoin Halving\u2019.\n\nWith an increased difficulty, the work needed to receive the same reward also increases \u2014 as so do the costs, and the risks of the activity. Miners work more to receive the same payment, which is also directly affected by Bitcoin\u2019s price in the spot market.\n\nThe higher the costs, also the higher the amount of newly circulating BTC that miners must sell in order to cover these costs. The more Bitcoin is sold in the market, the more the price can be negatively affected by this extra supply, if demand remains the same (or lower).\n\nCreating a vicious cycle because, with lower prices, miners\u2019 rewards in USD get even lower.\n\nThe Hashprice Index, by Luxor Mining, illustrates the effects of a growing hashrate and mining difficulty adjustment \u2014 measuring the expected receiving amount per calculated hashrate. This index is also heavily affected by the Bitcoin halving, every four years.\n\nHashprice Index in BTC/TH/DAY. Source: Luxor\n\nBad for Bitcoin\u2019s decentralization\n\nBesides the possible negative consequences for Bitcon\u2019s price \u2014 which are usually short-term consequences \u2014 the described events could cause many Bitcoin miners to be forced to close their businesses.\n\nUsually, small or medium miners are the mostly affected entities, as big miners can use different hedging strategies, have healthier structures, and have easier access to cheaper capital (as in loans or private funding).\n\nMedium and small #Bitcoin miners are at risk: \u201cIt is not profitable anymore\u201d\n\n\n\nThe constant increase in #BTC mining difficulty raises questions about the profitability of the business \u2014 I talked with some miners for insights regarding the activity.\n\n\n\n\ud83e\uddf5\u2193 [1/>25++] pic.twitter.com/3WitWIW1na \u2014 Vini Barbosa (@vinibarbosabr) June 18, 2023\n\nTherefore, as small and medium miners could be forced to close, there are fewer entities capable of keep working and growing their businesses, which could cause an effect of increased centralization over time, in a sort of economy of scale dynamics.\n\nHowever, what is expected by most Bitcoin advocates is that this could cause the network hashrate to decrease, also decreasing the mining difficulty, and allowing small and medium miners to get back to business.\n\nAlthough historical data shows otherwise, with both hashrate and difficulty adjustments growing over time, while bigger mining pools continue to earn a bigger share of block rewards, as seen in this comparison between the percentage of blocks each pool has mined in both a 3-year and 1-year time frames.\n\nMining pool shares of discovered blocks. Source: Mempool.space\n\nAs per the image, the two biggest mining pools (Foundry USA and AntPool) are growing their dominance for hashrate, block discovery, and collected rewards over time.\n\nConsidering that Foundry USA went from 16.58% to 29.52% of the total, and AntPool went from 16.03% to 20.48% of network dominance, for a period of three years and one year, respectively.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s value perception is directly connected to the security of the system, which is also directly connected to the decentralization of the network. A decreasing decentralization could possibly impact the market\u2019s value perception over the leading cryptocurrency."
