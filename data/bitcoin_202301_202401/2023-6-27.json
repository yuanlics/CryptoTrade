        "content": "Although hovering around the $100 range since mid-2022, Bitcoin Cash has skyrocketed after it was listed by a new crypto exchange that\u2019s backed by big-time TradFi players\u2014Citadel Securities, Fidelity, and Charles Schwab.\n\nThe new exchange, EDX Markets, offered only four cryptocurrencies at launch: Bitcoin, Ether, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin. The price of Bitcoin Cash has more than doubled over the past week since the announcement, trading near $235 as of Tuesday morning. The coin\u2019s price was up nearly 20% over the past 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin Cash got a boost when it was not named a security in the Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase filed earlier this month. EDX listing the token has given investors more confidence that regulators may be ignoring it.\n\nIn a 2018 video from a crypto event hosted by Bloomberg and Fidelity, now-SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said Bitcoin Cash, along with two other EDX-listed cryptocurrencies, Litecoin and Ether, were not securities. That statement differed from the SEC chairman\u2019s oft-repeated stance that every crypto except Bitcoin is a security.\n\nBitcoin Cash was created following a dispute between Bitcoin\u2019s users and developers over different visions for the future of the blockchain. In 2017, a group that wanted Bitcoin to focus more on consumer payments split, or forked, the blockchain to create Bitcoin Cash.\n\nDespite being valued at vastly less than its namesake\u2014Bitcoin was trading near $30,700 on Tuesday morning\u2014Bitcoin Cash is still a top 20 cryptocurrency, with a market cap above $4.5 billion."

        "title": "Speculation mounts BlackRock bitcoin ETF will get green light - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nSpeculation that BlackRock will finally break the US regulators\u2019 decade-long resistance to exchange traded funds based on bitcoin has fuelled a rally in the token to its highest level in a year.\n\nOptimism among crypto traders has soared in the two weeks since the world\u2019s largest money manager filed an application to run the first publicly traded spot bitcoin ETF in the US. Bitcoin, the most popular digital token, has soared by a fifth to more than $30,000.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s application has pitted a group with a substantial record of ETF approvals against the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has repeatedly rejected industry efforts for an ETF based on trading in the underlying bitcoin asset.\n\nSupporters argue a cheap and regulated asset in the world\u2019s largest investment market would encourage more investors and hope the financial muscle of the asset manager will succeed where others have failed. The SEC has three months to assess the application.\n\n\u201cThe BlackRock ETF is likely to be approved,\u201d said Dave Weisberger, chief executive and co-founder of CoinRoutes, an algorithmic trading platform for the digital asset industry.\n\n\n\nBlackRock has \u201cpretty much undercut all the SEC\u2019s arguments other than \u2018meh, we don\u2019t like bitcoin\u2019, so I think they have a very reasonable chance,\u201d he added.\n\nDozens of asset managers have applied to launch such a fund since the Winklevoss twins, the entrepreneurs, made the first filing in 2013, when bitcoin was trading at about $1,000.\n\nDigital assets dashboard Click here for real-time data on crypto prices and insights\n\nThe SEC has yet to pass an application for an ETF based on the underlying bitcoin asset, which is traded on unregulated exchanges. The agency says it cannot offer investors guarantees the market is free from fraud and manipulation.\n\n\n\nThe only crypto-ETFs the US has approved are based on bitcoin futures contracts, which are listed and monitored on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a regulated market.\n\nBoth ETF and crypto markets are hoping to ride in BlackRock\u2019s slipstream. Invesco, WisdomTree, Bitwise, Ark Investment Management and Valkyrie have all had spot bitcoin ETF filings rejected in the past but have refiled their applications, with some modifications. Ark is ahead of BlackRock in the filing queue, with the SEC due to make a ruling on its application by August 13.\n\nThe discount to the net asset value of the $18.9bn Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the world\u2019s largest crypto fund, has narrowed sharply to a nine-month low of 31.3 per cent. Grayscale is suing the SEC for its refusal to allow it to convert GBTC into an ETF, a move that, if allowed, would probably see the discount disappear.\n\nPart of the optimism stems from BlackRock\u2019s formidable record. According to Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, the asset manager has had 575 filings approved by the SEC and only one rejection. He put the odds of approval on this occasion at 50-50. Both BlackRock and the SEC declined to comment.\n\nIts application is also subtly different from those that have gone before. The chief difference is that the Nasdaq exchange, where the iShares Bitcoin Trust would be listed, \u201cis expecting to enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement with an operator of a United States-based spot trading platform for bitcoin\u201d.\n\nIn previous rejections the SEC has said a deal on surveillance \u201cwith a regulated market of significant size\u201d was one way for an applicant to meet its obligations to prevent fraud and manipulation in the underlying market.\n\nCoinbase is the proposed custodian for the fund and widely expected to be BlackRock\u2019s chosen exchange.\n\n\u201cIf Nasdaq is able to enter into an agreement with an exchange such as Coinbase, that could theoretically clear a pathway towards approval since it would directly address the SEC\u2019s main concern\u201d, allowing regulators \u201cto monitor for and pursue bad actors\u201d, said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, a financial adviser.\n\nHowever, Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research, North America, at Morningstar, felt BlackRock was only \u201cedging closer to addressing [the SEC\u2019s] concerns\u201d.\n\nWhile a surveillance-sharing effort with a cryptocurrency exchange \u201cis certainly better than having zero insight into the underlying market\u201d, he argued that manipulation could still be occurring on other exchanges, which would influence the price of bitcoin.\n\nGeraci suggested the new EDX Markets exchange, which launched this week, \u201ccould be the exact solution needed to get the SEC comfortable\u201d.\n\nThe marketplace is backed by Fidelity Investments, Charles Schwab and Citadel Securities and only allows accredited members to trade on it, much like Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange. But Geraci admitted it needed to generate sufficient volume for the SEC to consider it as \u201csignificant size\u201d.\n\nMoreover, the SEC also sued Coinbase this month, alleging it violated US securities law by failing to register as a broker, national securities exchange or clearing agency. Coinbase has vowed to fight the suit and continue as usual.\n\nClick here to visit Digital Asset dashboard\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s reliance on an enforcement-only approach in the absence of clear rules for the digital asset industry is hurting America\u2019s economic competitiveness and companies like Coinbase that have a demonstrated commitment to compliance,\u201d said Paul Grewal, Coinbase\u2019s chief legal officer.\n\nArmour was unconvinced by the trust structure argument but retained an open mind.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s 575-to-1 record is \u201cthe only reason why we would expect it to be approved\u201d, he added. \u201cThere is a reputational risk that comes with the filing. You feel that they wouldn\u2019t do this if there wasn\u2019t a reason.\u201d"

        "content": "After a year of falling prices, SEC lawsuits, and company failures, news of BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application earlier this month was a welcome reprieve: Bitcoin hit a 52-week high.\n\nThe news helped fuel the highest inflows to cryptocurrencies in a year\u2014nearly $200 million, according to a report by CoinShares\u2014but that\u2019s not without risk. Despite support from the market, BlackRock still faces an uphill battle. The Securities and Exchange Commission has never approved a spot Bitcoin ETF, rejecting at least 30 attempts in the past, according to Bloomberg, mostly because the agency says it\u2019s concerned about market manipulation.\n\nIn the best-case scenario, BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF, along with any others that get approved, may lead to a rush of investment and a new bull market that sends the price of Bitcoin soaring. At the same time, market players say Wall Street effectively controlling millions of tokens as portfolio assets could give TradFi firms outsize influence over the space.\n\nIncluding even one-third of all Bitcoin in financial products could be harmful to the overall network, causing it to deviate from its original purpose, said Steven Lubka, head of Swan Private at Swan Bitcoin, a financial services firm.\n\n\u201cYou always want to see a world where a healthy amount of people own Bitcoin and self-custody and use it directly, for the network to kind of truly maintain what is, in my opinion, its original purpose\u2014and what gives it value,\u201d he told Fortune.\n\nThere\u2019s also the risk that BlackRock and its peers could use their influence to push for changes to the underlying Bitcoin blockchain, such as pushing for a \u201cfork\u201d that would create two separate cryptocurrencies, Lubka added. Bitcoin was forked once before, after users and developers disagreed over its future, resulting in the creation of a new coin, Bitcoin Cash.\n\nIf there was another fork, BlackRock\u2019s ETF prospectus says it gets to decide which of the two cryptocurrencies is the \u201creal Bitcoin,\u201d despite what investors or other users of the blockchain think, Lubka said. This likely would lead the firm to dump all of its holdings in whichever coin isn\u2019t selected.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re sitting on 5 million Bitcoin, that means they\u2019re going to sell 5 million of the other fork,\u201d Lubka said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to tank the price.\u201d\n\nOthers like Jay Jog, cofounder of Sei Labs, disagree. Jog said Wall Street firms may gain more influence with the approval of these ETFs, but it\u2019s doubtful companies like BlackRock would push for major changes to Bitcoin because of the myriad potential legal and financial implications.\n\n\u201cThese entities, they\u2019re going to have so much money at stake,\u201d Jog told Fortune, \u201cthat even if there is the possibility for them to act maliciously by taking advantage of their stake in the network, from an economic standpoint, it makes no sense for them to do that.\u201d\n\nWhile there is some risk, both Lubka and Jog ultimately believe that the entry of traditional financial firms is something that will benefit Bitcoin\u2014and crypto overall.\n\nThe entry of traditional financial firms to the market has often spurred big inflows. When ProShares, the manager of several traditional finance ETFs, launched one of the first Bitcoin futures ETFs, in 2021, there was an influx of $1 billion into digital assets in a single week, according to James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares.\n\nOn the back of the spot ETF application by BlackRock, Invesco and WisdomTree each filed its own, soon followed by that $199 million deluge of inflows\u201494% of which went into Bitcoin\u2014according to CoinShares.\n\n\u201cParticipation among institutional investors has been scant so far, mainly due to reputation concerns associated with such investments,\u201d Butterfill told Fortune in an email. \u201cBut now, with BlackRock deciding to launch an ETF, many anticipate other institutions to follow suit.\u201d"

But one market expert told Forkast that this won\u2019t last long.\n\nSee related article: JPMorgan begins euro payments on its blockchain platform: Bloomberg\n\nFast facts\n\nBitcoin Cash rose 15% to US$222.46 in the 24 hours to 2 p.m. in Hong Kong on Tuesday, according to CoinMarketCap data. Another Bitcoin hard fork, Bitcoin SV, also rose nearly 50% in the past week. It is currently at US$37.23 after gaining 5% in the last 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV typically trade in low volumes, said Benjamin Stani, the director of business development and sales at crypto trading platform Matrixport.\n\n\u201cI would say it\u2019s mostly sentiment related \u2014 both are not tokens that are widely used and generally considered coins from the past cycle,\u201d said Stani, clarifying that there was no fundamental upgrade on Bitcoin forks to lead to long-term growth.\n\n\u201cThe narrative I\u2019m hearing is that Bitcoin forks obviously should get the same treatment as Bitcoin from the Securities and Exchange Commission, i.e. be considered commodities,\u201d Stani told Forkast via Telegram message.\n\nThe U.S. SEC has been aggressively policing local crypto entities on the basis that most cryptocurrencies could be seen as securities.\n\nBitcoin Cash was created in 2017 as a hard fork to Bitcoin to increase the block size on the network to allow faster and more affordable transactions. A hard fork is a permanent update to a blockchain protocol that makes the new network backward-incompatible with previous blocks.\n\nBitcoin Cash is also among the four cryptocurrencies that are offered on EDX Markets, the new compliance-focused crypto exchange backed by Wall Street giants such as Citadel Securities, Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab.\n\nLast week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have \u201cstaying power\u201d as an asset class.\n\nSee related article: How Dubai and Hong Kong are shifting crypto\u2019s power dynamics: Opinion"

        "content": "Bitcoin Cash, a spin-off from the oldest digital asset, has struggled to find a market since launching in 2017. But it\u2019s been on a roll this month: since the start of June, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is up 98%, jumping from $113 to $224.\n\nThe slightly obscure digital asset\u2014one of many cryptocurrency \u201cforks\u201d\u2014is following Bitcoin, like many other coins and tokens which have surged in price since the biggest digital asset experienced a run. But BCH is doing by far the best.\n\nWhy? The coin is one of the lucky four chosen for EDX Markets, a new crypto exchange backed by major Wall Street players Charles Schwab, Citadel Securities, and Fidelity Digital Assets.\n\nEDX, which launched last week, decided to let its traders\u2014institutional investors only\u2014start off with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nThe reason is simple: regulatory clarity.\n\n\u201cThese specific cryptocurrencies are generally perceived as commodities by regulatory bodies, which significantly mitigates potential legal challenges,\u201d Sei Labs co-founder Jeff Feng told Decrypt.\n\nYouwei Yang, Chief Economist at BTCM, added that the four assets are \u201cwidely regarded as digital commodities, making them relatively safe\u201d from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission because they are made with electricity\u2014a commodity.\n\nIn perhaps its toughest regulatory crackdown yet, the SEC has gone after a number of major crypto brands for allegedly flogging unregistered securities. Earlier this month, it went after Coinbase for allegedly offering and selling unregistered securities via its staking service. It also targeted Binance, the world\u2019s biggest exchange, with a massive lawsuit for allegedly \u201coperating as a fking [sic] unlicensed securities exchange in the U.S.A. bro,\u201d according to the SEC.\n\nIn February, it hit Kraken with a $30 million fine for allegedly failing to register the offer and sale of its crypto asset staking-as-a-service program.\n\nEvery Crypto Project Must Reckon With the SEC's Howey Test\n\nStory continues\n\nThese regulatory enforcements are all because SEC Chairman Gary Gensler thinks\u2014and has said for years\u2014that most cryptocurrencies are unregistered securities.\n\nBut he has made it clear that Bitcoin is a commodity. He has been less clear on Ethereum, but the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CTFC) has said the asset is a commodity.\n\nAnd Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin are both Bitcoin forks\u2014new cryptocurrencies that emerged from the asset\u2019s original code\u2014meaning they are likely to have the same status in the eyes of regulators.\n\nGreg Moritz, Co-Founder at the crypto hedge fund AltTab Capital, said that \u201cnone have been listed by the SEC as unregistered securities,\u201d adding that all four assets are established and have history, \u201ckey factors in the decision-making process of EDX\u2019s backers.\u201d\n\nEDX Markets CEO Jamil Nazarali also said that he felt \u201cvery comfortable\u201d that the four assets weren\u2019t securities.\n\nFor now, these four \u201cold school\u201d cryptocurrencies will give \u201cold school\u201d investors a taste of the crypto world. But things could change, Feng noted. \u201cAs regulations evolve and the understanding of different cryptocurrencies becomes more nuanced, we could anticipate exchanges like EDX broadening their offerings,\u201d he added."

        "title": "Bitcoin's Booming and Black Rock Files for ETF. What Does This Mean For Ethereum & Altcoins like Caged Beasts? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "As the bull market gains momentum and Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price continues to surge, the spotlight is shining on altcoins and their potential to follow in Bitcoin\u2019s footsteps. Following unveiling the private Bitcoin Trust in August last year, BlackRock\u2019s (BLK) iShares lodged with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) yesterday to launch a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nWith Bitcoin\u2019s price skyrocketing by 4.5% in the last 24-hr, the highest since April, investors are becoming more optimistic about the likelihood of BlackRock and other institutional players investing in digital assets. What could this mean for Bitcoin? Will Ethereum (ETH) follow in the footsteps of Bitcoin, and how much of it affect other altcoins such as Caged Beasts (BEASTS)? Let\u2019s discuss and learn all about it.\n\nBlack Rock Bitcoin ETF: The Gateway to Mainstream Adoption\n\nThe Black Rock Bitcoin ETF has attracted significant interest within the financial realm as an exchange-traded fund that focuses exclusively on Bitcoin. By investing in this ETF, individuals can benefit from Bitcoin\u2019s price fluctuations without possessing the actual cryptocurrency, meaning the risk is less. This ETF effectively connects conventional finance with cryptocurrencies, appealing to institutional investors and those desiring a regulated investment option.\n\nComparing Black Rock Bitcoin ETF with direct cryptocurrency ownership has various benefits. First off, it offers simplicity and accessibility that attracts a broader spectrum of investors. Some security issues with traditional Bitcoin exchanges are reduced when trading on licensed exchanges. Additionally, the ETF structure promotes liquidity and transparency, attracting institutional investors who have previously hesitated to enter the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe significance of the Black Rock Bitcoin ETF lies in its potential to accelerate the adoption of Bitcoin among mainstream investors. Introducing a regulated investment vehicle tied to Bitcoin reduces barriers to entry and establishes a sense of trust and legitimacy in the market. This development could lead to increased institutional participation, which may contribute to the long-term stability and growth of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum: The Catalyst for Altcoin Season\n\nThe efficiency and adaptability of Ethereum render it a desirable investment prospect. As the foundation of countless DApps and digital initiatives, Ethereum has become a dominant force in the cryptocurrency industry. Thanks to its robust infrastructure and vibrant developer community, the Ethereum platform is constantly improving and innovating. Ethereum is likely to be an accurate store of value, and its staking functionality makes it possible to earn passive revenue.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s price movements often dominate headlines, Ethereum has the potential to act as a catalyst for altcoin surges. After a 2-day short struggle with altcoins such as Cardano and Chainlink, they have returned to their position. As the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum\u2019s price movements often influence the overall sentiment and performance of the altcoin market. Ethereum can create a domino effect, driving up the value of other altcoins. This presents investors with opportunities to capitalize on the growth potential of various altcoins.\n\nCaged Beasts: The Altcoin You Need\n\nIn the realm of altcoins, meme coins have gained considerable attention due to their unique appeal and community-driven nature. Caged Beasts is an emerging meme coin that has captured the imagination of crypto enthusiasts worldwide. With a focus on community engagement and utility, Caged Beasts aim to stand out in a crowded market and establish itself as a force to be reckoned with.\n\nTheir referral bonus provides an additional 20% on Tether (USDT) tokens, increasing the potential for passive income generation. And owing to a novel referral program, early investors are able to go on an exhilarating journey with these additional advantages. Caged Beasts have piqued people\u2019s interest with their attractive staking incentives and alluring memes by creating a thriving ecosystem and encouraging a sense of belonging among investors. Given its numerous positive elements, Caged Beasts have the ability to transform how meme currencies are used.\n\nBlack Rock Bitcoin ETF\u2019s emergence as a regulated investment vehicle for Bitcoin paves the way for mainstream adoption and opens doors for institutional investors. Ethereum\u2019s position as a leading blockchain platform and influence on altcoin performance highlights its significance in the crypto market. Meanwhile, Caged Beasts represent meme coins\u2019 creative and community-driven nature with utility, appealing to investors seeking unique and engaging opportunities.\n\nCaged Beasts Website: https://cagedbeasts.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CAGED_BEASTS\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/CAGEDBEASTS"

        "content": "According to new research, fewer cybercriminals are turning to Bitcoin as their primary method of moving illicit funds, with bad actors opting to go back to fiat channels or choosing other cryptocurrencies.\n\nDigital asset compliance and risk management firm TRM Labs revealed that illicit finance volumes involving Bitcoin (BTC) had fallen significantly over the past seven years, according to its \u201cIllicit Crypto Ecosystem Report,\u201d released on June 28.\n\nTRM Labs said instead a new multichain era has led to a \u201cqualitative leap\u201d away from Bitcoin as a primary means of moving criminal proceeds. The firm also highlighted that cash and other forms of fiat-related finance remain the \u201cdefault\u201d means of criminal money movements.\n\n\u201cIndeed, cash and even older forms of finance such as hawala (transferring money without physically moving it) remain the default means by which illicit activity is financed and its proceeds are laundered.\u201d\n\nTRM Labs also noted that while illicit activity involving crypto has increased, \u201ccrypto did not invent these criminal forms.\"\n\nThe firm reported that around $2 billion in crypto was stolen through attacks on cross-chain bridges in 2022, but very little of that was Bitcoin.\n\nCharts showing the volume of Bitcoin used across various types of illicit activity. Source: TRM Labs\n\n\u201cThe multi-chain era has had a sweeping impact on the distribution of illicit crypto volume as a whole,\u201d it noted, adding that Bitcoin\u2019s share of illicit transactions plummeted from 97% in 2016 to just 19% in 2022.\n\nFurthermore, while two-thirds of the crypto hack volume was in Bitcoin back in 2016, that had fallen to just under 3% by 2022. The slack was taken up by Ethereum (68%) and BNB Smart Chain (19%), it said.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin was also once the \u201cexclusive currency\u201d for terrorist financing back then as well, but by 2022 it had been \u201call but replaced\u201d by Tron, with 92%, TRM Labs claims.\n\nAdditionally, TRM Labs claims that there has been a 240% increase in the use of Tether (USDT) among the terror financing entities that it tracked in 2022.\n\nUse of USDT and BTC for terrorist financing. Source: TRM Labs\n\nThe latest illicit finance figures in crypto may be brighter news for Bitcoin, which in recent days looks to be back on the table for institutional adoption.\n\nHowever, the cryptocurrency saw at least $7.8 billion paid into Ponzi and pyramid schemes, as much as $1.5 billion was spent on darknet markets specializing in narcotics, and $3.7 billion was stolen through DeFi hacks and exploits in 2022, according to TRM Labs.\n\nRelated: North Korea and criminals are using DeFi services for money laundering\n\nEarlier this year, Cointelegraph reported that 2022 set a new record for illicit crypto transactions. The total cryptocurrency value received by illicit addresses topped $20 billion last year, according to analytics firm Chainalysis.\n\nMagazine: Hall of Flame: William Clemente III tips Bitcoin will hit six figures toward end of 2024"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nIn the U.S., several aspirants have submitted proposals for an ETF that would provide exposure to Bitcoin\n\nEvery application for a spot market Bitcoin ETF has been turned down so far by the SEC\n\nCameron Winklevoss, warned the \u201cwindow\u201d to buy Bitcoin before the ETF \u201cfloodgates\u201d open is \u201cclosing fast\n\nA spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded funds (ETFs) have evolved into something of a big deal for the cryptocurrency world ever since the initial application for a U.S. Bitcoin exchange-traded fund was submitted in 2013.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF tracks the value of Bitcoin as its underlying asset. The complexity of exchanges, digital wallets, and private keys, according to proponents of a Bitcoin ETF, remains a formidable barrier to entry for novices to the crypto space. These investors may obtain exposure to Bitcoin through a Bitcoin ETF without actually holding any of the cryptocurrency themselves.\n\nAround the world, Bitcoin ETFs have shown up in countries including Canada, Brazil, and Dubai where they are really considered a big deal. The ProShares Bitcoin futures ETF also debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in October 2021.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which provides direct exposure to Bitcoin as opposed to futures contracts, has, to date, denied every application for a spot Bitcoin ETF. The possibility of market manipulation among cryptocurrency traders has been mentioned by the SEC on numerous occasions as one of their worries.\n\nIt All Started With Gemini\n\nIt has taken a while for there to even start talking about a Bitcoin ETF. The SEC has been holding up the creation of a trust that operates like a Bitcoin ETF since the Winklevoss twins initially proposed it in 2013. Over the past few years, it has frequently postponed making decisions on a number of big deal Bitcoin ETFs, leading companies like VanEck to withdraw their applications out of concern that the SEC will reject them.\n\nThe SEC formally denied the Winklevoss twins\u2019 application for a Bitcoin ETF in July. The Securities and Exchange Commission indicated that, in a nutshell, it does not think that investors would be sufficiently safeguarded from fraud and manipulation in the young market.\n\nAccording to the SEC, \u201cThe Commission thus cannot, on the record before it, conclude that bitcoin markets are uniquely resistant to manipulation.\u201d in the 92-page paper outlining how the decision was made.\n\nMany Have Failed \u2013 Or Gave Up\n\nThere is a long series of unsuccessful spot Bitcoin ETF applications, and the SEC has so far, as was already mentioned, denied each and every one of them. Some of the biggest companies tried but were still rejected. Here are some of the biggest SEC rejections:\n\nGlobal X\n\nIn July 2021, Global X Digital Assets submitted an application to the SEC. The proposed Global X Bitcoin Trust would be administered by the Bank of New York Mellon and traded on the Cboe BZX platform.\n\nThe SEC rejected the spot ETF proposals from Global X and NYDIG in March 2021.\n\nKryptoin\n\nIn October 2019, Delaware-based Kryptoin submitted their initial application for a Bitcoin ETF, with the proposed Kryptoin Bitcoin ETF Trust to be listed on NYSE Arca. In April 2021, the financial services firm attempted an additional Bitcoin ETF with a new plan that called for the Trust to be listed on Cboe\u2019s BZX Exchange. The service providers that would help with the launch of its ETF were included in its updated filing, including the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, which would act as custodians for the Trust\u2019s Bitcoin holdings.\n\nAfter several push-backs, the SEC rejected Kryptoin\u2019s application at the end of 2021.\n\nFidelity/Wise Origin\n\nThere was a spike in applications for Bitcoin ETFs in March 2021, including one from Fidelity\u2019s Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust that seemed like a big deal. According to the application for The Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, Fidelity Service Company Inc. would act as the trustee and Fidelity Digital Assets would be the custodian of the Bitcoin used to back the ETF.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s worries about market manipulation, according to Cboe Global Markets, have been \u201csufficiently mitigated\u201d as a result of growing investor participation and institutional adoption of the cryptocurrency, which have \u201cfacilitated the maturation of the Bitcoin trading ecosystem,\u201d according to a proposal to list Fidelity\u2019s Bitcoin ETF that seemed like a big deal and was submitted in May 2021.\n\nFidelity\u2019s ETF was rejected in January 2022, but now it is striking again.\n\nGrayscale\n\nGrayscale, a manager of cryptocurrency investment funds, has made no secret of its goal to turn its GBTC Bitcoin trust into a full-fledged Bitcoin spot ETF. The trust currently oversees well over 600,000 BTC, which are worth close to $20 billion at the current exchange rate. It started the procedure by formally filing a conversion application in October 2021.\n\nThe SEC rejected Grayscale\u2019s application in June 2022, claiming that the business had not taken sufficient steps to guard against potential fraud. Immediately after, Grayscale started legal action against the regulator, calling its justification for rejection \u201cillogical.\u201d\n\nVanEck\n\nOne of the first companies to apply for a Bitcoin ETF was VanEck. The VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust, created in collaboration with SolidX, was their first attempt at a Bitcoin ETF, and it debuted back in 2018.\n\nThe VanEck Bitcoin Trust application was submitted to the SEC in December 2020, with shares of the trust scheduled to trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Although the application was withdrawn in September 2019, VanEck made a second attempt to launch a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nBefore rejecting VanEck\u2019s second Bitcoin ETF filing in November 2021, the SEC continually postponed making a decision on it.\n\nA third application was submitted in the middle of 2022, and the SEC again hesitated before denying it in March 2023.\n\nDespite SEC\u2019s Crackdown on Crypto \u2013 Bitcoin Seems To Be Covered\n\nSince its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has been synonymous with cryptocurrencies, making it a constant topic of conversation. Throughout the regulatory mess the US Securities and Exchange Commission produced, Bitcoin has also managed to avoid being examined.\n\nAccording to SEC Chair Gary Gensler in an interview with CNBC, unlike other cryptocurrencies that past SEC leaders had evaluated, Bitcoin is a commodity. Gensler stated: \u201cSome, like Bitcoin, and that\u2019s the only one, Jim, I\u2019m going to say because I\u2019m not going to talk about any of these tokens [that] my predecessors and others have said [are] a commodity.\u201d\n\nThis may be a reference to a lecture by former SEC Director William Hinman, who used ether as the foundation for his defense of the securities vs. commodities debate.\n\nGary Gensler was observed at a presentation identifying a few cryptocurrencies that he deemed to be \u201cnot securities\u201d even before being appointed as the SEC Chair. In his presentation, Gensler named four cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nThe SEC recently announced a flurry of allegations against Coinbase and Binance, two of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, launching a legal conflict that will help shape the future of cryptocurrencies. Although there are significant differences between the two lawsuits, at their core, both Coinbase and Binance are charged with failing to register their exchanges with the SEC.\n\nBoth of these businesses have made up their minds to contest the accusations leveled against them and are getting ready for a lengthy battle.\n\nBlackRock Fever and Why It\u2019s Important?\n\nBlackRock stunned the financial community on June 15 when it filed for the iShares Bitcoin Trust, becoming the most notable filer for a spot Bitcoin ETF after the US Securities and Exchange Commission had rejected the approach for years. The timing of BlackRock\u2019s relationship with Coinbase and the unexpected filing, which followed the SEC\u2019s action against Coinbase (COIN) and Binance, is puzzling.\n\nBlackRock, the biggest asset manager in the world, would lend much-needed respectability to the Bitcoin market right now. An iShares spot Bitcoin ETF would be a welcome upgrade in light of the SEC\u2019s crackdown on the high-fee, unreliable Bitcoin ETFs now on the market. If this is the case, it raises the question of whether investors need to purchase this fund when it does so. Bitcoin\u2019s future is uncertain and it is very volatile. Investors cannot rely on a fundamental value, hence this factor should take precedence over all others, including fund structure.\n\nAside from its potential as an investment, it\u2019s important to comprehend how a spot Bitcoin ETF would compare to other products offered in the US. Grantor trusts, futures-based ETFs, and equity funds with exposure to Bitcoin are the three types of funds that make up the Bitcoin ETF market at the moment. The BlackRock-proposed spot Bitcoin ETF would add a fourth bucket because it doesn\u2019t fit in the existing three.\n\nWhat Does BTC Spot ETF Mean For the Crypto Market?\n\nThe co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, Cameron Winklevoss, declared on June 21 that he thinks \u201cThe Great Accumulation\u201d of Bitcoin between institutions and retail investors has started.\n\nHe said that purchasing Bitcoin before the ETFs become public is comparable to buying stock prior to an IPO and that the \u201cfloodgates\u201d for purchasing Bitcoin are \u201cclosing fast.\u201d\n\nThe Great Accumulation of bitcoin has begun. Anyone watching the flurry of ETF filings understands the window to purchase pre-IPO bitcoin before ETFs go live and open the floodgates is closing fast. If bitcoin was the most obvious and best investment of the previous decade, this\u2026 \u2014 Cameron Winklevoss (@cameron) June 21, 2023\n\nSome observers believe that the investing behemoth BlackRock\u2019s recent application for a Bitcoin spot ETF with the US Securities Exchange Commission, which was followed by those of Fidelity, Invesco, Wisdom Tree, and Valkyrie, is what caused Bitcoin\u2019s 19% price increase to $30,240 since June 16.\n\n5 Bitcoin ETF applications in 5 days!\n\n\u2013 Blackrock\n\n\u2013 Fidelity\n\n\u2013 Invesco\n\n\u2013 Wisdom Tree\n\n\u2013 Valkyrie \u2014 Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) June 21, 2023\n\nIn his own piece, MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor added his two cents, speculating that growing institutional demand may eventually force out retail investors.\n\nThe window to front-run institutional demand for #Bitcoin is closing. https://t.co/JQP6ZZSarV \u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) June 20, 2023\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first leveraged Bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) last week. The Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX) made its debut on the Chicago Board Options (CBOE) BZX Exchange on Tuesday, June 27.\n\nAccording to the BITX SEC filing, the company \u201cseeks investment results that correspond to two times (2x) the return of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Bitcoin Futures Daily Roll Index.\u201d\n\nAmid reports of potential spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and other well-known companies entering the digital currency market, the price of Bitcoin has risen above $30,000. Despite an increase of more than 80% in 2023, the price of Bitcoin is still more than 50% behind its record high reached in November 2021."

Additionally, more traditional financial institutions are venturing into the U.S. digital asset industry, with asset manager Fidelity reportedly preparing for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application.\n\nAll top 10 cryptos rise\n\nBitcoin climbed 1.3% to US$30,606 over the last 24 hours to 7:10 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is up 8.51% over the past seven days.\n\nEther rose 1.63% to US$1,887 for a gain of 5.61% for the week.\n\nAll top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded higher, with Polygon leading the gains on a 3.26% jump and a 5.96% weekly gain.\n\nFidelity is close to filing an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S., The Block news site reported on Tuesday, citing a source familiar with the matter. This follows a wave of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF applications submitted by asset managers this month, including BlackRock, WisdomTree, Invesco and Bitwise, indicating institutions are confident in the profit potential in digital assets.\n\nHowever, all the applications will need approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission and Fidelity\u2019s previous attempt to offer a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. in 2021 was rejected. It did however launch the Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF in Toronto, Canada, in December 2021. The ETF has risen 75% since the beginning of this year.\n\nInvestors are also reacting to reports HSBC, one of the world\u2019s top 10 banks, is reportedly offering Bitcoin and Ether futures ETFs on its investment platform for bank customers in Hong Kong.\n\nHSBC did not respond to requests seeking clarification on exactly when the products became available to clients as they were listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange in December. However, the development is seen as significant as the bank has traditionally been frosty toward cryptocurrencies, preventing clients from transferring funds from HSBC accounts directly to crypto exchanges.\n\n\u201cAlthough these crypto ETFs [in Hong Kong] are based on CME futures and are not physically backed like many of the [exchange traded products] in Europe, this is certainly very positive news for investors in the region who want to get regulated exposure to price movements in Bitcoin and Ethereum,\u201d Bradley Duke, co-CEO at Europe-based ETC Group, said in an emailed statement.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap rose 1.21% to US$1.19 trillion, with trading volume dropping 8.08% to US$35.49 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nAzuki Elementals NFTs take off\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market.

The index is down 0.72% for the week.\n\nThe decline was mainly driven by the Forkast ETH NFT Composite, which fell 1.54%, said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\n\u201cThis may reflect traders selling their existing assets to buy the new Azuki Elementals collection,\u201d Petscher added. \u201cIt also reflects a major sell-off in the main Azuki and Beanz collections, as traders had been buying those in order to have a shot at the [Elementals] presale [on Tuesday].\u201d\n\nNFT trading volume on Ethereum jumped 307% to US$67.19 million over the past 24 hours, while volume on the Bitcoin network fell 81.61% to US$1.56 million, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\n\u201cAs expected, Azuki exploded and gave Ethereum its biggest day of sales volume of the year,\u201d Petscher said, adding that with wash trades removed, it should be the most sales since May 2022 when Otherdeeds NFTs were minted.\n\nNotably, CryptoSlam\u2019s top four collections by trading volume are all Azuki-related collections. The new Azuki Elemental Beans collection saw total transactions of about US$36.36 million with the new Azuki Elementals recording US$4.87 million.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that these big volume days may be healthy, but big mints also extract liquidity from the ecosystem,\u201d Petscher said Tuesday on Twitter. \u201cWill we see some big secondary sales that then flow back into existing projects or will this be another cycle of liquidity being extracted?\u201d\n\nAsia stocks mixed, China industrial profits sink\n\nChinese Premier Li Qiang. Image: Getty Images\n\nAsia equity markets were mixed on Wednesday morning following Wall Street\u2019s overnight rally mainly driven by rebounding home sales and strengthened consumer confidence.\n\nHowever, U.S. stock futures edged lower as of 10:50 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 0.04%, S&P 500 futures slipped 0.16%, and Nasdaq Futures dropped 0.36%.\n\nIn China, profits at industrial firms sank 18.8% in the first five months of this year, on the back of a slowing post-Covid economic recovery, according to official data released Wednesday.\n\nPremier Li Qiang said at the so-called Summer Davos Forum on Tuesday in China that the country was still on track to hit its annual growth target of around 5%. \u201cGDP grew by 4.5% in the first quarter year-on-year, and is expected to expand faster in the second quarter than in the first,\u201d Li said.\n\nElsewhere in the region, South Korea\u2019s consumer sentiment index climbed in June to beat expectations and reach the highest since May last year.\n\nIn Australia inflation eased more than expected in May. Its monthly consumer price indicator rose 5.6% in the 12 months to May, the smallest increase since April 2022, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data showed Wednesday\n\n\u201cWhile prices have kept rising for most goods and services, many increases were smaller than we have seen in recent months,\u201d Michelle Marquardt, head of prices statistics at the ABS, said in a Wednesday statement.\n\nWhile the economic indicators out of the U.S. this week showed the economy is holding up despite inflation and higher interest rates, investors will hear more from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell when he speaks at events in Europe. Last week he said there may be more rate increases this year in the U.S.\n\nPowell will speak at the European Central Bank Forum in Sintra, Portugal, on Wednesday and again on Thursday at the Banco de Espa\u00f1a Fourth Conference on Financial Stability in Madrid, Spain.\n\nU.S. interest rates are now between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 76.9% chance for another 25-basis-point rate hike, and a 23.1% chance the Fed will leave rates unchanged at the next meeting on July 26.\n\n(Updates to add South Korea data in equities section.)"

        "content": "Bitcoin fell in Wednesday afternoon trading in Asia but is still holding above US$30,000 on market positivity as more traditional financial institutions show interest in digital assets and plan on introducing Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Ether and all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies fell in the past 24 hours.\n\nSee related article: Sony Network Communications to invest in Japanese Web3 developer Startale Labs\n\nCrypto stumbles, investor optimism endures\n\nBitcoin fell 0.76% to US$30,178 in the 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, the smallest drop among other top 10 cryptos, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is up 4.54% over the past seven days.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has benefitted from the U.S. banking confidence crisis earlier this year and the [Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s] lawsuits [against crypto exchanges] as well as the enthusiasm around the potential launch of a Bitcoin ETF,\u201d Denys Peleshok, head of Asia at London-based financial trading firm CPT Markets, said in an emailed statement on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cBitcoin ETF applications have supported investors\u2019 sentiment as institutional and retail investors show increasing interest in the market through such investment vehicles. If the SEC approves new applications, the market could record a surge in demand and in the number of buyers,\u201d Peleshok added.\n\nAccording to Matteo Greco, research analyst at digital asset and fintech investment firm Fineqia International, it is the first time since February 2022 that Bitcoin is showing a positive delta on the year-on-year price metric. However, this alone does not confirm if the bear market is over.\n\n\u201cBut the combination of good news at the macroeconomic level and the news concerning BTC adoption of institutions gave the market a boost to head towards a good Q2, following an already convincing Q1 in 2023,\u201d Greco said in an emailed statement on Tuesday.\n\nEthereum, the second biggest cryptocurrency, dropped 1.30% to US$1,850 in 24 hours, but is up 2.10% on the week.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptos fell on Wednesday afternoon trade with Solana leading losses. The token dropped 4.33% to US$15.97, bringing its weekly losses to 5.11%. Cardano\u2019s ADA token dropped 2.32% to US$0.2761 in the past 24 hours, losing 0.81% on the week.\n\nThe SEC named several altcoins as financial securities, including Solana, Cardano, Polygon and BNB, in the week of June 5, while filing lawsuits against crypto exchanges Binance.US and Coinbase. Altcoin prices have taken a hit since then as investors\u2019 funds seem to be flowing into Bitcoin.\n\nMore traditional financial institutions are venturing into the U.S. digital assets space. Fidelity is reportedly applying for a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S., according to crypto news site The Block. This follows a series of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF applications submitted by asset managers earlier this month, including BlackRock, WisdomTree, Invesco and Bitwise.\n\nInvestor sentiment was further boosted by reports of banking giant HSBC offering Bitcoin and Ether futures ETFs on its \u201cEasy Invest\u201d mobile application. These investment products were listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange last December.\n\n\u201cWe are happy to see more interest and demand in the digital assets space, but we would suggest that while ETFs are more convenient for many types of investors, that doesn\u2019t make them better,\u201d Michael Silberberg, head of investor relations at AltTab Capital, said in an emailed statement on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cBTC ETFs, including those now in Hong Kong, are all futures ETFs that have historically lagged the pricing upside of just holding BTC and taken larger downswings,\u201d Silberberg pointed out.\n\nTotal crypto market capitalization dipped 1.03% to US$1.17 trillion, while market volume rose 4.76% to US$37.34 billion in the past 24 hours.\n\nAzuki Elementals NFT disappoints\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 1.05% to 2,860.44 in 24 hours to 5.45 p.m. in Hong Kong, bringing its weekly losses to 1.37%.\n\nThe Forkast ETH NFT Composite also dropped 0.84% to 979.43, part of a 1.65% seven-day loss.\n\nNFT trading volume on Ethereum rose 307.62% to US$71.57 million in 24 hours, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nSolana overtook Bitcoin as the blockchain with the second-highest NFT sales volume over the past day. NFT sales volume on Solana rose 67.91% to US$2.73 million, while that on Bitcoin dropped 69.87% to US$1.51 million.\n\nCryptoSlam\u2019s top four collections by trading volume are all Azuki-related collections. Azuki Elemental Beans collection clocked sales of US$36.59 million in 24 hours, while Azuki Elementals recorded sales of US$8.93 million.\n\nThe main Azuki collection rose 1.84% to US$7.87 million, and Beanz rose 2.10% to US$2.52 million in 24 hours.\n\nElementals, an Azuki spin-off consisting of 20,000 NFTs, transacted nearly US$8 million in secondary action in the past 24 hours. Combined with the primary sale, and Azuki\u2019s Beanz and Elemental Beanz sales, the Ethereum NFT ecosystem saw its best day in over one year, according to Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\n\u201cHowever, collectors of Elementals aren\u2019t just underwhelmed. They are angry. The collection\u2019s art looks nearly identical to the original Azuki collection, leading many to believe the project has just devalued the ecosystem. The mint itself was a borderline disaster as well, though the 15-minute sell-out brought in US$38 million for the team,\u201d Petscher said.\n\nAzuki,\n\n\n\nIt's always both challenging & exciting opening up the gate to the Garden.\n\n\n\nThis time, we missed the mark.\n\n\n\nWe hear you \u2013 the mint process was hectic, the PFPs feel similar and, even worse, dilutive to Azuki. \u2014 Azuki (@Azuki) June 28, 2023\n\nHolders of Azuki NFTs were given a 10-minute presale mint, and the next 10 minutes opened up to Beanz holders. In the end, many Azuki holders were left stuck with a loading message and could not mint. Beanz holders were upset that very few were left for them, and no Elementals made it to public sale, Petscher said.\n\n\u201cThis was all but a worst case scenario for NFTs as it shows little has been learned over the past few years, and projects seem to be focused on profits first, and maybe exclusively,\u201d he added.\n\nAsian equities mixed; European bourses gain\n\nStock market display on the street. Image: Envato Elements\n\nAsian equity markets showed mixed results on Wednesday, reacting to news that profits of industrial firms in China sank 18.8% year-on-year in the first five months of 2023, due to a slower-than-expected post-Covid recovery.\n\nAt the end of Asian trading hours on Wednesday, the Shanghai Composite remained unchanged while the Shenzhen Component dropped 0.47%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index gained 0.12% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 strengthened 2.02%.\n\nAccording to a Bloomberg survey of economists, the world\u2019s second-largest economy is expected to cut its interest rates on one-year policy loans by 5 basis points to 2.6% in the last quarter of this year to boost economic growth.\n\nU.S. stock futures mostly dropped as of 7 p.m. in Hong Kong, as the S&P 500 futures dipped 0.09%, and the Nasdaq 100 Futures fell 0.19%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 0.06%.\n\nInvestors are looking forward to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s speech at events in Europe. Powell is set to speak at the European Central Bank Forum in Sintra, Portugal, on Wednesday and again on Thursday at the Banco de Espa\u00f1a Fourth Conference on Financial Stability in Madrid, Spain.\n\nLast week, Powell said there may be more interest rate increases this year in the U.S., which are currently between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006.\n\n\u201cU.S. equity investors today are being rewarded with a smaller return premium for bearing equity risk than at any time in recent memory, at a time when macroeconomic risks are high and central banks are in less supportive mood,\u201d Duncan Lamont, head of strategic research at Schroders, said in an emailed statement on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. may have been the strongest performing market for much of the past 15 years, but our analysis of the equity risk premium suggests that it will struggle to repeat that feat. Long-term investors may be better served by allocating more to non-U.S. markets in the decade to come,\u201d Lamont added.\n\nEuropean equity markets strengthened on Wednesday, following Wall Street\u2019s overnight rally on the back of rebounding home sales in the U.S. and strengthened consumer confidence.\n\nThe benchmark STOXX 600 gained 0.68% and Germany\u2019s DAX 40 rose 0.88% during Wednesday afternoon trading hours in Europe.\n\nPhilip Lane, European Central Bank\u2019s Chief Economist, indicated on Wednesday that stock markets should not factor in interest rate cuts in the next two years.\n\nThe central bank has been increasing interest rates since last year, amounting to 400 basis points of raises so far, with market expectations of two more rate hikes later this year.\n\n(Update adds NFT and equity sections.)"

        "content": "The recent news of BlackRock filing for a spot bitcoin ETF seems to have sparked considerable excitement in what has otherwise been a miserable crypto market. Some are even saying it marks the beginning of a new \u201ccrypto summer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you think is going to benefit the most from that?\u201d asks Avi Felman.\n\nThe head of digital asset trading at GoldenTree answers his own question: \u201cThere\u2019s this great instrument, GBTC.\u201d\n\nIf Grayscale were to succeed in being turned into an ETF, following BlackRock\u2019s lead, it could be a \u201cgreat trade,\u201d says Felman.\n\n\u201cIt is currently trading at a 33% discount,\u201d he says.\n\nSpeaking to Cumberland\u2019s Global Head of Trading Jonah Van Bourg on the 1000X podcast (Spotify/Apple), Felman explains that GBTC shares sell at a discount compared to their underlying bitcoin assets, enabling some interesting opportunities.\n\nGBTC sells at a lower price than the underlying BTC due to the fact that Grayscale, while it aims to exist as an ETF, is currently structured as a trust and does not provide asset redemption of its shares. As a result, supply and demand dynamics can cause the price of GBTC to deviate from the value of BTC.\n\nWhile currently trading at a discount, the shares have been priced at a premium in the past. Some traders prefer to avoid the risks of directly custodying the digital asset, instead leaving the job to Grayscale. Twelve-word mnemonic phrases and hardware wallets don\u2019t seem to suit the institutional vibe.\n\nConverting the trust into a spot ETF could reduce pricing deviation by enabling 1:1 equivalent redemption between the shares and bitcoin, but the Securities and Exchange Commission rejected the company\u2019s 2022 application, sparking a lawsuit that is not yet resolved.\n\nGBTC\u2019s price recently surged following news of BlackRock\u2019s ETF filing and a number of subsequent institutional filings. Van Bourg expresses caution against banking on the discount, warning that GBTC will likely sell off again \u201cat some point.\u201d\n\nThe reason for Van Bourg\u2019s hesitancy, he says, \u201cis DCG\u201d \u2014 Grayscale\u2019s owner. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if the managers of DCG are economically rational\u201d or if they are more driven by \u201creputational\u201d concerns.\n\nGrayscale doesn\u2019t have to compete\n\n\u201cIn theory,\u201d Van Bourg explains, \u201cthe textbook says they should just do nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever the price of GBTC does, it doesn\u2019t change the amount of fees that Grayscale collects. It\u2019s really just the price of bitcoin going up and down that alters their fee.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey collect 2% of the bitcoin held in the fund every year.\u201d\n\nWhile BlackRock is filing for an ETF, Grayscale doesn\u2019t really have to compete with them, according to Van Bourg. \u201cEven if the price of GBTC gets fire-sold down to a discount of minus 90%, technically, they\u2019re still collecting those same fees.\u201d\n\nIf a BlackRock ETF were to be approved, Grayscale might be better off eventually buying their own shares back at a deep discount, Van Bourg suggests. BlackRock could clear a regulatory path, after which Grayscale could convert their trust into an ETF.\n\n\u201cThat would be a scummy thing to do to your investors,\u201d he says, \u201cbut if you\u2019re just purely economically rational, that might actually make sense to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is some risk to the downside there.\u201d\n\nFelman argues that the probability of such a move is \u201cextremely low\u201d due to legal and reputational implications.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to build a business,\u201d he says, \u201cas opposed to generating a lot of cash in the short-term and then opening themselves up to legal liability.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat being said, a lot of people have done a lot of worse things in crypto,\u201d Felman admits.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re managing GBTC and BlackRock comes out with a product that\u2019s infinitely superior,\u201d Van Bourg says.\n\nGrayscale investors will rotate into BlackRock, he argues, leaving the company little choice but to allow the redemption of GBTC shares. \u201cGBTC is going to get redeemed and the assets are going to get rotated into something more institutional.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Will $30K be a new springboard for Bitcoin bulls? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "After a failed rally above $31,000 on June 23, Bitcoin (BTC) has sustained the $30,300 resistance for the past three days. Curiously, this happened while gold reached its lowest level in three months, trading at $1,910 on June 22, down from a $2,050 peak in early May.\n\nInvestors now question how solid Bitcoin\u2019s $30,000 support is. So analyzing what caused the recent price rally is essential to understanding how traders are positioned on BTC margin and futures markets.\n\nWhy did BTC price break above $30,000?\n\nSome analysts attribute Bitcoin\u2019s recent 21.5% gains in 11 days to BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) filing. But other events might have fueled the cryptocurrency gains. For instance, on June 26, HSBC Bank in Hong Kong reportedly introduced its first local cryptocurrency services using three listed crypto ETFs.\n\nMoreover, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, a Bitcoin futures fund, experienced its largest weekly inflow in a year at $65 million, with its assets topping $1 billion. It was the first BTC-linked ETF in the United States and is one of the most popular among institutional investors.\n\nBut, more importantly, the U.S. crypto regulatory environment may be improving after a period marked by enforcement actions from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) aimed at exchanges supposedly operating as unregistered securities brokers.\n\nRelated: How security, education and regulation can mitigate rising crypto scams\n\nOn June 25, Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman said that financial institutions had been left in a \u201csupervisory void\u201d in terms of emerging technologies, including digital assets. Bowman added that policymakers have been relying on \u201cgeneral but non-binding statements,\u201c leaving substantial uncertainty and imposing new business requirements after significant investments have been made.\n\nIn that sense, a draft bill in the U.S. House of Representatives aims to prohibit the SEC from denying digital asset trading platforms registration as a regulated alternative trading system. Published on June 2, the proposed legislation would allow such firms to offer \u201cdigital commodities and payment stablecoins.\u201c\n\nBitcoin margin, futures suggest bullishness\n\nNow let\u2019s look at Bitcoin derivatives metrics to better understand how professional traders are positioned amid improved regulatory perspectives and a sizable institutional inflow.\n\nMargin markets provide insight into how professional traders are positioned because they allow investors to borrow cryptocurrency to leverage their positions.\n\nOKX, for instance, provides a margin-lending indicator based on the stablecoin/BTC ratio. Traders can increase their exposure by borrowing stablecoins to buy Bitcoin. On the other hand, Bitcoin borrowers can only bet on the decline of a cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nOKX stablecoin/BTC margin-lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nThe above chart shows that OKX traders\u2019 margin-lending ratio bottomed at 17 on June 20 but has improved over the past four days. The movement indicates a prevalence of margin longs as the present 24x ratio favors bullish stablecoin lending.\n\nStill, investors should analyze the Bitcoin futures long-to-short metric, which excludes externalities that might have solely impacted the margin markets.\n\nExchanges\u2019 top traders Bitcoin long-to-short ratio. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThere are occasional methodological discrepancies between exchanges, so readers should monitor changes instead of absolute figures.\n\nTop traders at Huobi vastly increased their longs between June 22 and June 24 as Bitcoin price broke above the $30,000 resistance.\n\nOn the other hand, OXK\u2019s top traders initially increased their shorts on June 22 and June 23, but subsequently reverted their positions by adding bullish bets.\n\nLastly, the top traders at Binance started adding longs on June 21 and have kept increasing bullish positions until June 23.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s $30,000 support showing strength\n\nOverall, Bitcoin bulls have added leverage-long positions using margin and futures markets backed by the positive momentum from multiple spot Bitcoin ETF requests, heavy institutional inflow and a more rational approach from U.S. lawmakers.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s regulation-by-enforcement approach is not backed by some U.S. Federal Reserve governors and has faced some serious backlash in the U.S. House of Representatives. For example, Representative Warren Davidson has introduced the SEC Stabilization Act, citing \u201congoing abuse of power\u201d and demanding the removal of Gary Gensler as chair of the SEC.\n\nGiven the favorable scenario toward cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin bulls should now have the upper hand to sustain the $30,000 BTC price support level in the coming weeks.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Thanks to its strong performance, MicroStrategy in the first three months of the year notched its first profitable quarter in more than two years.\n\n\"The conviction in our bitcoin strategy remains strong as the digital asset environment continues to mature,\" CFO Andrew Kang said in a statement in May, after the company had snapped up 7,500 tokens that quarter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaylor, an active market commentator via Twitter, has made other predictions recently, including how the next president will be pro-bitcoin, how the token is more attractive than the traditional safe haven asset gold, and even calling the crypto \"immortal.\""

Companies like crypto fund manager Valkyrie, WisdomTree and Invesco re-filed for spot Bitcoin ETFs, with Bitwise also reportedly trying again for a BTC ETF.\n\n\u201cAnd our bull case for spot bitcoin ETF approval can basically be summed up in four words: \u2018What does BlackRock know?\u2018\u201d Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote on Twitter. ETF Institute co-founder Nate Geraci took to Twitter on June 26 to express similar sentiments.\n\nMany industry observers have highlighted the timing for BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF filing, with some alleging that the firm could have insider information about the SEC\u2019s BTC ETF policies.\n\nNew t-shirt drop via @EricBalchunas\u2026\n\n\n\nI will say, seems hard to believe this is all coincidence:\n\n\n\nBlackRock files for spot btc ETF\n\n\n\n4 other issuers quickly follow suit\n\n\n\nEDX crypto exchange launches (backed by Fidelity, Schwab, etc)\n\n\n\n2X leveraged btc futures ETF allowed by SEC pic.twitter.com/5CfG7ThcLg \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) June 26, 2023\n\nDespite growing optimism over the potential arrival of a spot Bitcoin ETF to the U.S. market, many experts believe that such products are not coming in the near future.\n\nThe SEC is unlikely to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF in 2023 as it hasn\u2019t progressed much since the Winklevoss twins filed for one back in 2017, Wilshire Phoenix\u2019s partner Wade Guenther told Cointelegraph.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETF fever returns: Biggest inflow to ProShares\u2019 BITO in a year\n\n\u201cThere really hasn\u2019t been a lot of development since the first time many of these sponsors filed their initial spot Bitcoin ETFs,\u201d Guenther said, adding:\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe that a spot Bitcoin ETF will be available to the public anytime soon because there\u2019s still a certain amount of time for review. So it could be not until next year, potentially the year after that, we could see a spot Bitcoin ETF.\u201d\n\nPreviously, ETF Institute co-founder Nate Geraci predicted that the world would not see a spot Bitcoin ETF in 2023.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin 2023 in Miami comes to grips with \u2018shitcoins on Bitcoin\u2019"

        "content": "Cointelegraph\u2019s Crypto Trading Secrets podcast has published its 10th episode, featuring an interview with trader Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, who caters to an audience of more than 650,000 on Twitter under the handle @CryptoMichNL. During the June 14 interview recording, host Benjamin Pirus discussed several topics with van de Poppe, such as his opinions on what might drive Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price over the rest of 2023. His answer, in part, references United States regulations.\n\n\u201cI think if there\u2019s clarity on the framework that\u2019s being established in the U.S. in terms of whether or not cryptos are going to be securities or commodities \u2014 that\u2019s going to push markets,\u201d van de Poppe said, adding:\n\n\u201cBecause if you have that framework, it opens up for more institutional investors. I don\u2019t believe that the U.S. is going to be the big one. I think the other parts of the world are already stepping in.\u201d\n\nIn mentioning other regions\u2019 crypto-related regulatory environments, van de Poppe highlighted the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework from the European Union, which was approved in late May. \u201cI think the U.S. is behind, but the more we get clarity on that, it\u2019s going to be beneficial for the markets and activate more liquidity into the markets,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe trader also noted the macroeconomic conditions potentially affecting Bitcoin significantly, such as the situation around interest rates and unemployment in the United States and other countries. \u201cI think all those factors are going to move all the markets, including Bitcoin, and that\u2019s what we need to find out in the rest of the year whether or not there is going to be a recession and whether or not Bitcoin is going to be the big winner or the big loser,\u201d van de Poppe said.\n\nVan de Poppe also spoke about several other topics, including his early interest in the stock market as a kid.\n\nCheck out this and other episodes from Cointelegraph\u2019s Crypto Trading Secrets podcast on Cointelegraph\u2019s podcast page, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts or TuneIn.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "Should You Back Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV as Price Doubles? Analyst's Warning - CCN.com",
        "content": "Recently, focus has been on Bitcoin (BTC) and the two hard forks that broke off from the main chain: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin SV (BSV). BSV and BCH prices have soared over the past week, outperforming even BTC.\n\nOn the grounds that the majority of cryptocurrencies could be viewed as securities, the U.S. SEC has been vigorously monitoring domestic crypto companies.\n\nJerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve, stated last week that digital currencies like Bitcoin had \u201cstaying power\u201d as an asset class.\n\nPowell allegedly stated that stablecoins used for payments are viewed by the central bank as a kind of money during a monetary policy hearing on Capitol Hill on last week.\n\nHe also claimed that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have \u201cstaying power\u201d as an asset class. Additionally, he asserted that stablecoin regulation should be strengthened by the central bank.\n\nBCH Rises But Not for Long\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency\u2019s offshoot, Bitcoin Cash , has increased in value by almost 108% over the past week as speculators hope that American regulators will classify the Bitcoin-based altcoin in the same category as commodities.\n\nBenjamin Stani, the director of business development and sales at crypto trading platform Matrixport said he heard rumors that Bitcoin forks obviously should get the same treatment as Bitcoin from the Securities and Exchange Commission, i.e. be considered commodities.\n\nIt makes sense looking at the graph that shows BCH price being pretty bland and then, after Powell\u2019s speech, rising up.\n\nHe, however, warned that the overall rise is probably mostly sentiment related \u2014 \u201cboth are not tokens that are widely used and generally considered coins from the past cycle,\u201d said Stani , adding that there was no fundamental upgrade on Bitcoin forks to lead to long-term growth.\n\nHowever, the other reason for the current price increase in Bitcoin Cash appears to be the introduction of EDX Markets, a platform for institutional investors.\n\nFinancial behemoths Fidelity, Schwab, and Citadel Securities support EDX Markets, which is not registered with the SEC but has considerable clout thanks to its well-known backers.\n\nThe only cryptocurrencies that are listed on the platform are Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. The market has viewed this exclusive listing as a vote of confidence in Bitcoin Cash, especially in light of the SEC\u2019s increased scrutiny of other blockchain initiatives.\n\nIn order to address differences of opinion among the Bitcoin community regarding scalability and transaction capacity, the Bitcoin network underwent a fork in 2017 that produced Bitcoin Cash.\n\nThe great blockers and the minor blockers, two factions with various proposals, soon developed. The big blockers\u2019 support for larger blocks of transactions resulted in the \u201chard fork\u201d that gave birth to Bitcoin Cash in August 2017. By splitting the Bitcoin blockchain in two, Bitcoin Cash was given its own ledger.\n\nA change in how the market views Bitcoin Cash may be indicated by its inclusion on a platform built for institutional investors. Despite its contentious beginnings and several forks, Bitcoin Cash\u2019s performance over the past few months indicates it is gaining favor with professional investors.\n\nBitcoin SV Rise Boosted by China and UK\n\nAfter a second split in Bitcoin Cash in 2018, Satoshi\u2019s Vision, led by Australian computer scientist and self-declared Bitcoin creator Craig Wright, was born. BSV trades quite similarly to the original Bitcoin. That\u2019s advantageous right now since over the past few days, investors have flocked in droves to the most popular cryptocurrency.\n\nIn the last seven days BSV jumped by 54% and the force behind this boom could be the emergence of China back into the cryptocurrency space.\n\nChina recently modified its perspective on cryptocurrency. Beijing recently released a whitepaper named \u201cWeb3 Innovation and Development White Paper (2023)\u201d that emphasized the importance of Web3 technology for the advancement of the internet.\n\nThe global markets might be severely impacted if China were to entirely withdraw the cryptocurrency prohibition or soften its stance, which would increase demand and drive up prices. However, based on what has been happening, there are still a lot of rumors swirling about everything right now.\n\nA week ago, parliamentarians in the United Kingdom have approved a new law that would classify cryptocurrency as a regulated industry there.\n\nThe Financial Services and Markets Bill (FSMB), which was approved on Monday by the House of Lords, the upper chamber of Parliament, now moves on to the legislative process.\n\nThe comprehensive measure, which is over 340 pages long, was unveiled in July in an effort to make the most of Brexit-related freedoms and give authorities more control over the British financial system.\n\nAlthough a proposal to regulate stablecoins within the nation\u2019s payment regulations was included in the initial bill, revisions to treat all cryptocurrency as a regulated activity and provisions to oversee crypto advertising were introduced later as the bill moved through Parliament."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) may see a \u201cmarket correction\u201d should BTC price action go much beyond $33,000, research warns.\n\nIn the latest edition of its weekly newsletter, The Week On-Chain, analytics firm Glassnode flagged speculative selling risk on the horizon.\n\nBitcoin speculator profits average 12%\n\nBitcoin short-term holders (STHs) \u2014 the more speculative BTC investors \u2014 have returned to the spotlight this year.\n\nRecently, their aggregate cost basis appeared to form wider BTC price support near $26,000. For Glassnode, which observed the cost basis\u2019 significance in recent weeks, the opposite effect could soon appear.\n\nAs part of its coverage of short-term and long-term holder (LTH) activity, researchers highlighted levels at which speculators should take profit en masse.\n\nIt used the market value to realized value (MVRV) metric, which divides the spot value of coins versus the price at which they last moved. The resulting number, which forms a measure of profitability or loss, fluctuates around one, corresponding to a \u201cbreakeven\u201d price.\n\n\u201cWe can also see a strong reaction in the Short-Term Holder MVRV indicator, reacting strongly off the break-even level of MVRV = 1,\u201d \u201cThe Week On-Chain\u201d explains.\n\n\u201cThis ratio is currently at 1.12, suggesting that, on average, the short-term holder cohort is sitting on a 12% profit.\u201d\n\nShould BTC price continue to make gains, STH-MVRV will rise with it, and once it passes 1.2, the danger of profit-taking historically becomes real.\n\n\u201cThe risk of market corrections tend to rise when this metric exceeds levels of between 1.2 (~$33.2k) and 1.4 (~$38.7k), as investors come into increasingly large unrealized profits,\u201d Glassnode added.\n\nBitcoin short-term holder MVRV chart (screenshot).

        "content": "Bitcoin slipped 0.04% on Tuesday afternoon in Asia but remained above US$30,000. Ether also dropped, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed after a week of gains led by crypto-related exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in the U.S.. Asian equities and U.S. stock futures gained while European markets traded mixed.\n\nSee related article: Singapore outlines design framework for interoperable networks in collaboration with financial firms\n\nBitcoin, Ether dip in 24 hours, but post weekly gains\n\nBitcoin dropped 0.04% to US$30,402 in 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, but strengthened 13.32% in the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap data. Prices of the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization have been on the rise since a number of traditional institutional players showed interest in introducing Bitcoin exchange-traded-fund (ETF), indicating its mainstream acceptance.\n\n\u201cRetail investors have been steadily accumulating Bitcoin over the years, and a significant portion of the supply remains untouched by long-term holders,\u201d Rajagopal Menon, Vice President of WazirX, India\u2019s largest crypto exchange by volume, told Forkast in an emailed response.\n\n\u201cWith the influx of institutional investors and the consequent surge in Bitcoin demand, the limited supply and illiquid nature of Bitcoin are poised to propel its price higher,\u201d Menon added.\n\nEther, world\u2019s second-largest crypto exchange, fell 0.97% to US$1,875 in 24 hours, but has risen 8.41% on the week.\n\nCardano\u2019s ADA token was the biggest loser among top 10 cryptos, dropping 2.63% to US$0.2828, which brought its weekly gains to 9.11%. Solana was the second biggest loser in the top 10, falling 1.26% to US$16.73 in the last 24 hours, but has gained 4.76% in the past seven days.\n\nThe U.S. SEC filed lawsuits against crypto exchanges Binance.US and Coinbase in the week of June 5. In doing so, it named several altcoins as financial securities, including Cardano, Solana, Polygon and BNB.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has surged to a new yearly high, leaving the altcoin market trailing, partly due to the U.S. SEC declaring them securities. This shift in liquidity dynamics, where funds seem to be flowing from altcoins to Bitcoin\u2026 indicates the potential for Bitcoin to sustain its upward trajectory, potentially at the expense of altcoins,\u201d Menon of WazirX added.\n\nBitcoin Cash, the spin-off of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, gained over 108% in the last seven days as investors hope the Bitcoin-based altcoin receives the same categorization as commodities by U.S. regulators. Bitcoin Cash rose 13.9% to US$220.68 in the 24 hours to 5.10 p.m. in Hong Kong on Tuesday, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has been outpacing Wall Street recently. It is attracting an increase in exposure and interest from institutional investors, which typically include pension funds, hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds,\u201d Nigel Green, chief executive of financial advisory firm deVere Group, said in an emailed statement on Monday. \u201cInvestors should \u2018follow the big money\u2019 as institutional funds flow into Bitcoin,\u201d Green added.\n\nCrypto exchange Bybit said on Monday it has received a license to operate a crypto exchange and provide custody services in Cyprus. The license from the regulatory authorities in Cyprus would allow the company to provide services including trading between crypto and fiat currency pairs, financial services related to crypto assets, and custody solutions tailored to clients in Cyprus and E.U. member states.\n\nSeychelles-based crypto exchange Bitget said on Monday it has launched a local website and a fiat gateway in Turkey, enabling local users to trade on Bitget using the Turkish Lira (TRY). Fiat Gateway serves as a bridge connecting traditional financial systems and digital assets, enabling transactions between fiat currencies like USD, EUR, or TRY, and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization fell 0.09% to US$1.18 trillion, while total crypto market volume rose 11.12% to US$35.63 billion.\n\nAzuki NFT collection outsells BAYC on Ethereum\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 1.24% to 2,878.63 in 24 hours to 5.30 p.m. in Hong Kong, but has gained 0.21% over the past seven days.\n\nThe Forkast ETH NFT Composite also dropped 0.42% to 988.48, bringing its weekly losses to 1.28%.\n\nNFT sales volume on Ethereum rose 18.50% to US$18.62 million in 24 hours, while that on the Bitcoin network fell 23.06% to US$4.94 million, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nSales of Ethereum-based Azuki increased 98.3% to US$4.4 million, making it the most-sold collection in the last 24 hours, as NFT enthusiasts await the Tuesday minting of Azuki\u2019s new Elementals collection.\n\n\u201cRight now this is the talk of NFTs, and traders are looking for liquidity to have their chance at this mint, or to have enough funds to purchase on secondary,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\n\u201cThe narrative in the NFT space is that Azuki seems primed to give BAYC (Bored Ape Yacht Club) a run for being the top NFT collection,\u201d Petscher added.\n\nBAYC ranked second by sales volume, gaining 1.88% to US$2.17 million in the last 24 hours.\n\nAsian markets, U.S. stock futures gain; European markets mixed\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nAsian markets mostly rose after Chinese Premier Li Qiang said on Tuesday that the world\u2019s second largest economy would achieve its annual growth target of around 5%. He also expects China\u2019s economy to grow faster in the second quarter than in the first. His comments come after S&P Global lowered its outlook on China\u2019s economic growth on Monday.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite gained 1.23% and the Shenzhen Component rose 0.97%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index gained 1.88%, but Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 lost 0.49%.\n\nChina\u2019s latest Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI), which is an indicator of the health of manufacturing and service sectors, is due for release later this week. China\u2019s GDP grew by 4.5% in the first quarter of this year, official data showed.\n\n\u201cDomestic demand [in China] is moderating. Demand for consumables, as well as real estate, is shrinking amid subdued confidence,\u201d according to a Monday report by Singapore\u2019s DBS bank.\n\n\u201cIncome growth has yet to catch up with the pre-Covid time. Weakening investment growth also points to softening demand,\u201d the report added.\n\nEuropean equities were mixed on Tuesday, after European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said inflation remained too high. The European Central Bank has been increasing interest rates since last year, amounting to 400 basis points of raises so far, with market expectations of two more rate hikes later this year.\n\nThe benchmark STOXX 600 dropped 0.13% and Germany\u2019s DAX 40 rose 0.02% during Tuesday afternoon trading hours in Europe.\n\nAccording to a Reuters poll of economists, the Bank of England (BoE) will raise borrowing costs further to tackle persistent inflation. Last week the central bank, in a surprise move, increased interest rates by half a percentage point to 5%, the highest since 2008.\n\n\u201cThe U.K. is poised for a modest economic upturn due to lower energy prices, government support measures, and a robust labor market. However, trade prospects may remain lackluster due to the sluggish economies of major trading partners,\u201d data and analytics company GlobalData said in its \u201cMacroeconomic Outlook Report: UK\u201d on Monday.\n\n\u201cBusinesses also face a high cost of financing which remains another area of concern. Although the inflation rate is projected to ease, it is expected to stay at an elevated level of 7% in 2023, down from 9.1% in 2022 but much higher than the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2%,\u201d GlobalData said.\n\nU.S. stock futures strengthened as of 7 p.m. in Hong Kong, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 0.06%, and the S&P 500 futures gained 0.23%. The Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 0.48%.\n\nIn the U.S., indicators for this week on the state of the economy include home sales, consumer confidence reports and jobless claims.\n\nInvestors continue to assess the interest rate situation in the world\u2019s largest economy, following Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s comments last week that indicated more rate hikes later this year. Current interest rates in the U.S. are between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006.\n\n\u201cGiven the risk of a U.S. economic recession in the second half of 2023, investing in bonds may across various Asian markets could enable a diversification of risks, as well as help attract capital into the Asian bond markets,\u201d Swa Wu, a Hong Kong-based investment director of fixed income at Schroders, said in an emailed statement on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe end of the U.S. rate hike cycle means the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar may come to a pause. This would present an opportunity for other currencies to strengthen and enhance the appeal of non-US dollar-denominated Asian bonds, and further attract capital to the asset class,\u201d she added.\n\n(Updates with equities section)"

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s relative percentage of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization has hit 58%, its highest level since April 2021, according to a new report from Coin Metrics.\n\nWith a staggering $590 billion market capitalization, the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency currently has further pushed back on Ethereum and smaller altcoins. The total market cap for the industry sits at $1.2 trillion according to Coingecko.\n\nThis comes amid news of heightened regulatory scrutiny by U.S. regulators\u2013who recently claimed a handful of cryptocurrencies were unregulated securities, causing several to shed billions off their market capitalizations.\n\nSEC Claims Solana, Polygon, Cardano Are Securities in Binance Lawsuit\n\nBitcoin has been leading a bullish rally over the past week, after BlackRock filed for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The Wall Street colossus sparked Bitcoin\u2019s rise in crypto market dominance and triggered investors to buy the asset\u2014despite many previously denied ETF applications.\n\nThe price boost has also spilled over into other assets, such as Grayscales Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). The so-called \u201cGBTC discount,\u201d which refers to the difference between the price of the shares and the net asset value (NAV) of the Bitcoin it holds, continues to drop, hitting a monthly low of -30%, according to YCharts.\n\nCoin Metrics, an open-source data analytics platform for public blockchains, reported Bitcoin\u2019s dominance steadily dropped during the crypto spring of 2021, slumping to its lowest level in January 2022. At the time it accounted for 37% of the global crypto market cap.\n\nBitcoin Market Dominance Hits Lowest Level Since 2018\n\nThe report also showcased that Bitcoin\u2019s presence in the so-called CBMI 10\u2013Coin Metric\u2019s index for the top 10 cryptocurrencies\u2013has hit its highest point in 2 years, weighing in at 65%. The metric, however, excludes stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) or USDC.\n\nBitcoin is up year-to-date 85%, currently trading hands at $30,395 as per Coingecko data. The asset has outscored the majority of cryptocurrencies in 2023, with notable exceptions from Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Lido Finance (LDO)."

The strategic collaboration between the Tether and the Georgian government will focus on building key infrastructure for a thriving startup ecosystem in Georgia.\n\nThe collaborative effort aims to attract international attention and investment toward the nascent decentralized space. The partnership aims to foster the growth of P2P technology at a state level and help build financial tools around it. Some of the key areas of development include education on Bitcoin (BTC) and blockchain technology, building payment infrastructure for merchants, and developing a resilient, open and private P2P communication system.\n\nPaolo Ardoino (CTO, Tether) and Irakli Nadareishvili (Deputy Minister of Economy and Sustainable Development) signing the MOU for the collaboration between Tether and the Government of Georgia to develop Blockchain, #Bitcoin and Peer-to-Peer Infrastructure. pic.twitter.com/g3LayZxDPX \u2014 Tether (@Tether_to) June 28, 2023\n\nTether said the partnership with the Georgian government would also look at creating and implementing a strong, autonomous financial and communication system. This entails encouraging the adoption of P2P technology-based digital payment and communication systems, as well as improving existing infrastructure to ensure its robustness and dependability in supporting blockchain-based solutions. The collaboration intends to bring changes to public administration and the business sector.\n\nGeorgia will create a special fund for local startups to help develop blockchain technologies and position Georgia as a country with an attractive ecosystem for tech startups. Irakli Nadareishvili, Deputy Minister of Economy and Sustainable Development, said the collaborative effort \u201cwill contribute to the development of local blockchain technologies in the country, as well as the introduction of companies operating in this sector in Georgia.\u201d\n\nRelated: Peer-to-peer crypto exchanges struggle to navigate shifting legal landscape\n\nTether\u2019s collaborative effort in Georgia is not its first. Over the years, many crypto companies have worked closely with governments to advance the nascent technology. In most cases, collaborations translate into a better understanding of the tech by governments, eventually leading to positive regulation.\n\nEl Salvador, the first country to make Bitcoin a legal tender, had Bitfinex as its key exchange technology partner and granted the country\u2019s first digital asset license to the exchange.

Source: Glassnode\n\nIt noted that there was currently an \u201cextremely high exchange interaction,\u201d from Bitcoin miners which had sent a record $128 million to exchanges over the past week. This is equivalent to 315% of their daily revenue, the analytics platform noted.\n\nThere have been several spikes in miner revenue sent to exchanges during the 2021 bull run as they took profits. There was also a capitulation inflow in late 2022 as markets hit their cycle bottom.\n\nHowever, this latest spike has dwarfed them all by a considerable margin.\n\nUsually, when miners send BTC profits to exchanges they do so in preparation to cash out to cover their expenses and take profits.\n\nThis past week would be a good time to do so since BTC hit its highest price of the year so far, touching $31,185 on June 24.\n\nAt the time, CryptoQuant co-founder and CEO Ki Young Ju echoed the sentiment, stating that the current price-to-earnings ratio was at an \u201cattractive price for miners to sell.\u201d\n\nBitcoin prices are yet to be affected however, as the asset remains slightly above the $30,000 threshold at the time of publication.\n\nNevertheless, the current $31,000 price zone is a major resistance level for BTC, with markets failing to break it in mid-April and again in late June. If bulls can't break new ground future losses are expected, especially if miners start liquidating.\n\nBitcoin mining profitability, or hash price, has increased slightly over the last week due to the rise in BTC prices. It is currently $0.076 TH/s (terahashes per second) per day, according to HashrateIndex.\n\nRelated: Riot Platforms to add 33,000 Bitcoin miners ahead of 2024 halving\n\nDespite the price of Bitcoin increasing more than 88% year-to-date, miners are still facing some tough challenges. Profitability has slumped more than 30% since July last year and is down over 80% since the peak of the 2021 bull market.\n\nWhen combined with almost record hash rates of 377 EH/s and peak difficulty levels, Bitcoin miners are still facing an uphill battle.\n\nIncreasing hash rates and difficulty, combined with higher energy prices, have put downward pressure on mining profitability. This means that selling their hard-earned Bitcoin may prove an unpleasant necessity to cover expenses.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with \u2018Net Zero\u2019 promises"

As a reason for the rejections, the regulator noted that it did not meet the rules of practice and Exchange Act requirements for listing a financial product.\n\nSpeaking in a recent interview, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart confirmed that ARK\u2019s request is the front-runner for a Bitcoin ETF. \u201c21Shares, ARK and Cboe [Chicago Board Options Exchange] are first in line because their next SEC decision date is Aug. 13, 2023, and we don\u2019t yet have a date for the other 19b-4 applications like the one from BlackRock,\u201d he noted.\n\nEven if ARK receives approval in the coming weeks, the BTC ETF saga may not be over, as it still needs to appoint a crypto exchange to enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement. Although Coinbase may be a strong candidate for this position, the company has already partnered with BlackRock to become a Bitcoin custodian should approval be granted.\n\n\u201cWould BlackRock [...] even allow Coinbase to enter into a SSE agreement with another that would help another issuer beat them to market? If so ARK would need another crypto exchange to use,\u201d Balchunas continued on Twitter.\n\nBlackRock joined the long line of applicants on June 16, triggering a wave of similar initiatives on Wall Street, especially from previous applicants. Financial investment firms such as Valkyrie, WisdomTree and Invesco have refiled for spot Bitcoin ETFs in the past few days.\n\nCointelegraph reached out to ARK Invest but did not receive an immediate response.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with \u2018Net Zero\u2019 promises"

Understanding the significance of L1 networks becomes crucial in this context.\n\nThe Solity Network platform offers a comprehensive and real-time Bitcoin Insights Dashboard to address this interconnectedness. This tool provides users with up-to-date data and in-depth analysis of the evolving dynamics of Bitcoin. Furthermore, by presenting a comprehensive overview of Bitcoin\u2019s liquidity, the dashboard empowers users to monitor fluctuations and correlations within the cryptocurrency market closely. This capability enhances risk assessment and facilitates informed decision-making within the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a statement by Marijo Radman, the CTO and Co-Founder of Solity Network, he mentioned: \u201cFor DeFi to go mainstream the underlying dynamics of Bitcoin and its interconnectedness to the DeFi space have to be understood in depth. The Bitcoin Insights Dashboard is the first step in that direction. Our mission is to create more transparency and make it accessible to everyone to foster DeFi adoption.\u201d\n\nWith the Bitcoin Insights Dashboard launch, Solity Network solidifies its position as an industry leader in blockchain risk solutions. The company\u2019s dedication to innovation and the advancement of the crypto landscape propels them to develop groundbreaking tools that enable investors to navigate the complexities of decentralized finance.\n\nAbout Solity Network\n\nSolity Network provides the infrastructure for Decentralized Finance to enable the real-time processing of fundamental risks across chains, protocols, and liquidity pools. By aggregating multi-chain risk parameters, Solity Network creates transparency, sets the stage for machine learning, and implements risk-adjusted returns for digital assets investment managers.\n\nDisclaimer: There is no offer to sell, no solicitation of an offer to buy, and no recommendation of any security or any other product or service in this article.

        "content": "Bullet Blockchain, Inc.\n\n\u201cBullet ATM\u201d Branded ATM Machines Will be Integrated With the Company\u2019s Patented Technologies, Making Them the First Licensed Bitcoin ATM Network in North America\n\nRENO, NV, June 28, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NewMediaWire \u2013 Bullet Blockchain, Inc. (\u201cBULT\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), (OTC: BULT), a pioneering software development and SaaS company at the forefront of blockchain technologies and Web 3.0, is pleased to announce the successful completion of a strategic transaction to acquire a fleet of Bitcoin ATMs. As the owner and licensor of two Bitcoin ATM patents, the Company is excited to expand its offerings and provide greater accessibility to cryptocurrencies.\n\nAs previously announced, BULT acquired an intellectual property portfolio consisting of Bitcoin ATM Patents (the \u201cIP Portfolio\u201d). BULT\u2019s IP Portfolio will be integrated into all Bullet ATMs making it the first licensed Bitcoin ATM network of kiosks in North America. Bitcoin ATMs have experienced significant growth in the United States, driven by the increasing demand for convenient cryptocurrency transactions. According to the website CoinATM Radar, there were nearly 31,000 Bitcoin ATMs in the United States and nearly 2,800 Bitcoin ATMs in Canada as of the time of this release. BULT intends to license its IP Portfolio to other Bitcoin ATM operators and manufacturers in North America.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to be one of the few publicly traded Bitcoin ATM companies with our anticipated roll out of our Bullet ATMs,\u201d commented Simon Rubin, Chief Executive Officer. \u201cBitcoin is a rapidly growing asset class, and we believe that our Bullet ATMs will provide a convenient and easy way for people to get involved. We believe that the Atlanta Georgia metropolitan area is a great market for Bullet ATMs. The city has a large and growing diverse population who are more likely to be interested in Bitcoin. We are confident that our Bullet ATMs will be well-received by the local community.\u201d\n\nBitcoin ATMs allow users to conveniently buy and sell Bitcoin for cash using a free-standing kiosk similar in size to a traditional ATM machine. The process is simple and secure, and users can typically complete a transaction in minutes. These automated machines allow individuals to buy or sell Bitcoin using cash, providing a seamless bridge between traditional fiat currency and the world of digital assets. As the adoption of cryptocurrencies continues to rise, the future of Bitcoin ATMs in the United States appears promising.\n\nStory continues\n\nBitcoin ATMs are becoming increasingly popular, as they offer a convenient way for people to access the Bitcoin market. As more people recognize the potential of Bitcoin and seek to participate in the Bitcoin market, the need for accessible on-ramps becomes crucial without relying on online brokers or exchanges. BULT\u2019s CEO, Simon Rubin, concluded: \u201cBullet ATMs are a reasonable alternative to online exchanges and the accessibility makes Bullet ATMs an attractive option for both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and newcomers to the space.\u201d\n\nAbout Bullet Blockchain\n\nHeadquartered in Reno, Nevada, Bullet Blockchain Inc. \u2013 common stock is publicly traded on the OTC Markets under the symbol (BULT) \u2013 the owner and licensor of two Bitcoin ATM patents, is a diversified software development and SaaS company, specializing in blockchain technologies and Web 3.0.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDeep down, I know that Candy Crush Saga isn\u2019t a particularly clever or inventive puzzle game\u2014but nearly a decade after first savoring its specific brand of freemium dopamine hit, I still can\u2019t help but get lost in its mindless, color-matching glow from time to time. And now there\u2019s a version that pays you cryptocurrency for playing it.\n\nGranted, Sweet Bitcoin isn\u2019t an official Candy Crush Saga game, and it\u2019s not created by mobile giant King. Like so many iOS and Android games, it\u2019s a pretty convincing knockoff that matches the feel and flow of the juggernaut franchise. In this case, however, Bling Financial\u2019s copycat game nails the basics while rewarding you with bits of Bitcoin or Ethereum along the way.\n\nSweet Bitcoin doesn\u2019t fuss with the classic formula. Here, you\u2019re still trying to match three or more like-colored candies on a grid, with the aim of completing some basic objective\u2014clearing X number of this candy, or spreading a bubble-gum sheen across the whole board by making matches\u2014within a limited number of moves.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nScreenshots from Sweet Bitcoin on iPhone. Image: Decrypt\n\nBling\u2019s facsimile packs in hundreds of levels, and from the few dozen I played, Sweet Bitcoin amiably recreates the real deal. In fact, it feels less prone to serious difficulty spikes\u2014a trademark feature of Candy Crush that\u2019s tied to its freemium model, thus potentially nudging players to spend real money to buy more in-game lives instead of waiting to play again.\n\nSweet Bitcoin is a free-to-play game too, but it\u2019s anchored around full-screen video ads that you\u2019re forced to watch after each and every level you play. The downside, of course, is that you have to pause to watch obnoxious ads for scammy-looking games, some of which promise to pay you hundreds of dollars a day for playing them. That\u2019s surely not legit.\n\nI know that because Sweet Bitcoin itself pays you crypto for playing, and it doesn\u2019t come anywhere close to that kind of payout. In fact, my earnings tallied up to around $0.05 per hour worth of Bitcoin. After about two hours of playing, I had a dime\u2019s worth of BTC sent to Coinbase.\n\nIt\u2019s not much, but that's pretty much par for the course for games like this. It varies by game and developer, but in my experience, you\u2019ll typically only earn a few cents per hour worth of crypto. With Bling games, you\u2019re rewarded with \u201cBling points\u201d that can be converted into BTC or ETH and cashed out, but the end result is the same: free crypto for playing amusing mobile games.\n\nThe repetitive and overlong ads quickly turn tiresome, however, plus the amount of points you earn per level appears to diminish over time. After a few hours, I was ready to flee back to the safety of one of the handful of official Candy Crush incarnations for my next fix.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven so, Sweet Bitcoin served up the most fun I\u2019ve had playing any of these crypto-earning mobile games to date. What it lacks in originality it makes up for with\u2026 well, free crypto for playing a solid imitation of an addictive mobile game. If you can put up with the ads, that is."

        "title": "What Does Blackrock's Bitcoin ETF Mean for Cryptocurrencies? - Morningstar Asia",
        "content": "Bryan Armour: BlackRock (BLK) shocked the financial world when it filed for the iShares Bitcoin Trust on June 15, becoming the most prominent filer for a spot Bitcoin ETF after years of rejection of the strategy by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The surprised filing came on the heels of the SEC's lawsuit against Coinbase (COIN) and Binance, making the timing in BlackRock's partnership with Coinbase and the filing even more odd.\n\nBlackrock Would Make Bitcoin Legitimate\n\nAs the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock would immediately give legitimacy to the Bitcoin market in need of it. Between the SEC's crackdown in high-fee, imperfect Bitcoin ETFs currently on the market, an iShares spot Bitcoin ETF would be a welcome facelift. Whether that means investors should buy this fund should it hit the market is another question. Bitcoin is highly volatile, and its future is uncertain. There's not a fundamental value to lean on for investors, so this consideration should outweigh all others, including fund structure. Aside from investment merit, it's worth understanding where a spot Bitcoin ETF would fit in with other offerings available in the U.S. Currently, the Bitcoin ETF market is composed of three types of funds \u2013 grantor trusts, futures-based ETFs, and Bitcoin-adjacent equity funds. A spot Bitcoin ETF like the one BlackRock is proposing would create a fourth bucket because it doesn't fit in the others.\n\nWho Are Blackrock's Competitors in the Bitcoin Space?\n\nCurrently, the largest Bitcoin offering in the U.S. is Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, ticker GBTC. It operates more like a closed-end fund than an ETF, meaning investors have faced large premiums and discounts in its price versus NAV that have nothing to do with Bitcoin. The iShares Bitcoin Trust would have continuous offerings like other ETFs, meaning authorized participants would be able to create and redeem shares at NAV at any time. This would help keep the ETF's price in line with its NAV. Grayscale currently doesn't allow redemptions. So, investors' only option is to sell at the prevailing price, which is currently heavily discounted.\n\nHow Will Blackrock's Bitcoin ETF Work?\n\nFutures-based Bitcoin ETFs do a better job of tracking Bitcoin's price, but they also introduce other differences from holding Bitcoin. First, the intention of these funds is to hold the front month futures contracts. But futures contracts expire. Each month, the portfolio managers must roll into the next month's futures contract, often at a slightly higher price. This creates an added cost for the fund that a spot Bitcoin ETF wouldn't incur. The exchange that lists Bitcoin futures, the CME, also imposes position limits to avoid any one firm from controlling too much of the market. Should that occur, as it did in 2021 when ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, ticker BITO, launched, the portfolio managers had to move further out on the futures curve by buying longer-dated futures contracts. A rule of thumb is the longer a futures contract has until expiration, the less closely it will track the asset spot market.\n\nIn terms of its ability to track the price of Bitcoin, a spot Bitcoin ETF like the one proposed by BlackRock would clearly be an upgrade over currently available options. It would likely also come with lower fees. Grayscale charges a 2% fee while BITO charges 95 basis points, and this is one cause for investors that's highly likely to improve should BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF come to market.\n\nWhy is Blackrock Filing a Bitcoin ETF Now?\n\nThe ultimate question is why now for BlackRock's filing? There have been over 30 past filings for spot Bitcoin ETFs, but this is BlackRock's first. Perhaps it could be due to the impending decision of Grayscale's lawsuit against the SEC about rejecting a spot Bitcoin ETF, or perhaps BlackRock thinks it has the right approach to surveillance to quell the SEC's concern over manipulation of the Bitcoin market. We will all stay tuned to find out."

        "content": "This is Part 2 of a 2 article series about the future of Bitcoin. We looked at a speech by Michael Saylor. He\u2019s the founder and CEO of MicroStrategy.\n\nSo, let\u2019s see what he has to say about Bitcoin. Here\u2019s a link to Part 1.\n\nSource: Twitter\n\nWhat Is Money?\n\nSaylor sees money as \u201cA way to store your economic energy and not have it stolen from you\u201d. For example, by the government or by bad investment decisions. So, what makes good money? For instance, gold. However, this is defective because we keep creating more of it. By creating 2% more, the half-life of your gold money is 35 years. It halves in value, every 35 years.\n\nSo, he states that it is difficult to create sound money. For example, it became 50 trillion times more difficult to mine Bitcoin. That\u2019s since its conception. As a result, good money needs a cap, and it must be not easy to create it. Like Bitcoin, with a 21-million-coin cap.\n\nAll monetary assets have a natural frequency. In this case, their half-times or half-lives. So, a low frequency means that it will last longer. Bitcoin started with a high frequency. However, now it has a much slower frequency. With each new Bitcoin halving, Bitcoins frequency half-life will go up. In 2024, it will go up to 100 years. See the picture below. For instance, in 2036, the half-life of your economic energy in Bitcoin is 1000 years. In 2048, it will be 10,000 years.\n\nHe states that politicians will tell you that this is not possible. However, according to Saylor\u2019s charts, there is one asset, Bitcoin, that has a long and low enough frequency. You can expect this asset to keep its value forever. You can keep that money forever. He calls this economic immortality. Now, this gives hope. So, perfect money is a way to escape the economic misery of the economic war. The picture below shows the Bitcoin economic energy in 1000 years.\n\nWhat Is the Winning Economic Strategy?\n\nAccording to Saylor, the best strategy is to hold the best money. It should come as no surprise that Saylor sees this as being Bitcoin.\n\nThe best currency, according to him, the USD, is going to zero. So, he sees gold as better money than USD. Stocks are better than gold. And, Bitcoin is better than stocks.\n\nCorporate equity makes 7% gains. Many experts see this as a good investment. However, owning Bitcoin has a lifelong escape from technological destruction. It lives in cyberspace, so you can\u2019t destroy it and it\u2019s incorruptible. So, he looks at owning $100 million today. With the current inflation rate of 7-8%, what do you have, 100 years from now? See the picture below. It gives a clear view of the winning strategy.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe looked at Michael Saylor, founder and CEO of MicroStrategy. He gave a speech at a Bitcoin conference in early June 2023. This is a recap of his speech. He makes a clear case of why investing in Bitcoin is a winning strategy. It will let you escape the economic war.\n\nAt the end of the speech, he also shows how MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin assets performed. It outperformed inflation with 14% gains vs. 7% inflation.\n\nAt the time of publishing this article, the current price of Bitcoin is $30,242.55. Its market cap is $587 billion. There\u2019s a max and total supply of 21 million BTC coins. The circulating supply is currently 19.4 million BTC.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Check out our most up-to-date research, NFT and Metaverse buy, and how to protect your portfolio in this market by checking out our Altcoin Buzz Access group, which for a limited time, is FREE.

        "content": "Jun 28, 2023, 09:14AM IST\n\nSource: TOI.in\n\nRatan Tata, the Chairman Emeritus of Tata Group, has issued a significant clarification regarding his involvement in cryptocurrency investments. Through a Twitter post, Tata emphatically stated that he has no associations whatsoever with any form of cryptocurrency. He urged netizens to remain vigilant, cautioning them about false articles or advertisements that falsely link him to cryptocurrency and are intended to deceive citizens. To support his message, Tata shared an example of a misleading analysis claiming his recent investment had startled experts and major banks. Similarly, Anand Mahindra, Chairman of Mahindra Group, faced a similar situation when fake news circulated, asserting his cryptocurrency investments had left banks terrified. Mahindra promptly refuted the claims, calling them unethical, dangerous, and completely fabricated. He emphasized that he had not invested a single rupee in cryptocurrencies. These clarifications from Tata and Mahindra serve as reminders for the public to exercise caution, raising awareness about the prevalence of fake news and cryptocurrency scams."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCrypto companies that were partnered with Prime Trust are clearing the air about the safety of customers\u2019 assets following the custodian\u2019s failure.\n\nSome firms\u2014many of which declare proudly that they are \u2018Bitcoin only\u2019\u2014are in worse shape than others.\n\n\u201cThere are still many unknowns, but we intend to fight for our members that have funds locked up with Prime Trust,\u201d tweeted Coinbits, a platform for buying, selling, and automatically saving in Bitcoin on Wednesday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis is thread that we would never have wanted to write. We\u2019ve been posting updates on our website and in email, but we think it\u2019s important to communicate directly to Bitcoin Twitter about what the Prime Trust meltdown means for Coinbits. \u2014 Coinbits | DCA into bitcoin (@CoinbitsApp) June 28, 2023\n\nPrime Trust was placed into receivership on Tuesday by the Nevada Financial Institutions Division due to years-long financial issues that were recently brought to light. Between losing old private keys and misappropriating user assets, the State\u2019s filing indicated that Prime Trust is over $82 million in the hole from fiat liabilities.\n\nWhile the company claimed to have a nearly solvent $68 million in digital assets to cover client\u2019s crypto deposits, analysis by Arkham Intelligence indicates that the vast majority of these funds are held in an illiquid token called \u2018AUDIO\u2019. Only $7.5 million are held in Bitcoin.\n\nNevertheless, Coinbits said Prime Trust \u201cstill has enough bitcoin to honor our members\u2019 balances,\u201d and plans to move towards a \u201cno-custody solution\u201d in the future. As of writing, most of the app\u2019s service remains offline.\n\nMeanwhile, Swan Bitcoin, another Bitcoin financial services company, is under fire from Bitcoiners after rapidly withdrawing all assets from Prime Trust weeks in advance of the custodian\u2019s fallout.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAll Swan clients\u2019 assets now rest with Fortress, a crypto custodian that happens to be led by Scott Purcell, the same CEO that led Prime Trust until January 2021.\n\n\n\nBefore moving to Fortress, Purcell was CEO of Prime Trust partner Banq, which recently filed for bankruptcy due to mismanagement under his service, alleged the company earlier this month.\n\nMany suspect that companies like Swan may be subject to clawbacks during Prime Trust\u2019s bankruptcy process, despite withdrawing before its collapse. However, Swan CEO Cory Klippsten claims that wouldn\u2019t be possible due to \u201ca century of trust legal structure precedent.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIf there were somehow going to be clawbacks (illegal, and contra a century of precedent), Swan would just make our users whole,\u201d added Klippsten.\n\nKlippsten denied that Swan knew Prime Trust was insolvent before withdrawing, saying that the firm had been preparing to migrate away from the custodian for 9 months.\n\nNot luck AND didn\u2019t know. We\u2019d been prepping to move for 9 months, had already moved some users/states to Bitgo, and pulled the trigger when PT lost Connecticut bc that regulator was going to force the sale of user BTC. If a custodian keeps losing states you need to change. You\u2026 \u2014 Cory Klippsten | Swan.com \ud83e\udda2 #Bitcoin (@coryklippsten) June 28, 2023\n\nMuch like Swan, Bitcoin lightning wallet Strike narrowly escaped Prime Trust with users\u2019 assets intact. However, rather than choosing a new custodian, the firm decided to take asset custody in house, unlocking some new features for users.\n\nWhen asked why Swan didn\u2019t pursue a similar approach to Strike, Klippsten told Decrypt that he suspects this approach will invite regulatory problems.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don't think having the ledger/custody on the broker side is the answer because I expect regulations soon forcing the separation of brokerage and custody, which is required for the rest of the financial industry and is the best legal setup for users,\u201d wrote Klippsten via DM.\n\n\n\nIn terms of choices for custodians, the CEO said there are few options for \u201clegally segregated, bankruptcy remote\u201d trust accounts for individual users. \u201cPrime Trust plus Fireblocks dominated for 3-4 years, and now all the fintechs have moved to Fortress plus BitGo,\u201d he said.\n\nBitGo originally planned to acquire Prime Trust earlier this month, but later backed out of the deal.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

On Tuesday, it was up 2.2%.Fidelity did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.A spot bitcoin ETF is a publicly-traded investment vehicle that tracks the price of bitcoin and offers investors exposure to the asset class. On the other hand, futures-based bitcoin ETFs track the price of bitcoin futures contracts and have been viewed more favorably by the SEC Fidelity had previously dipped its toes in the crypto ETF space. It applied for a spot bitcoin ETF in 2021, but its proposal was rejected by the SEC, which said it did not meet the standards to prevent fraudulent and manipulative practices.SEC Chair Gary Gensler's tough approach to crypto companies has earned him the \"bad cop\" reputation among industry players.The regulator is also locked in a dispute with Grayscale Investment , which sued the SEC for rejecting its application last June to convert its flagship spot Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF."

        "title": "How High Can Bitcoin Price Rise Due To Spot ETFs? Running The Numbers - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The recent Bitcoin rally has led to speculation that the price could rise further with the introduction of spot ETFs. The arrival of ETFs, especially from reputable companies such as BlackRock and Fidelity, could boost institutional investor confidence and lead to a surge in the Bitcoin price. The one million dollar question, however, is: how high? Clues to answering this question can come from various metrics and data.\n\nOne such data point was provided yesterday by CoinShares\u2019 Chief Strategy Officer Meltem Demirors via Twitter. As she writes, the Bitcoin spot ETF news is not the only story. Many of the largest financial institutions in the US are currently actively working to provide access to BTC and more. In total, there are more than $27 trillion in client assets waiting on the sidelines.\n\nWith BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager has filed a Bitcoin ETF application. Rumour has it that the world\u2019s number three, Fidelity Investments, is also flirting with a Bitcoin ETF. Bitcoin ETF applications from Invesco and WisdomTree (both top 10 ETFs) are a fact.\n\nHow High Can Bitcoin Rise? All-Time High? Quadruple?\n\nIf just a fraction of the $27 trillion in client money managed by the largest asset managers were to go into Bitcoin spot ETFs, the impact on price would be gigantic. Just 1% would amount to over $270 billion (rather more because not all Bitcoin ETF applicants are included in the chart). In comparison, the Bitcoin market cap is currently $590 billion.\n\nAs NewsBTC reported two weeks ago, the performance of the gold price after the first gold ETF in November 2004 could also be a metric that provides a glimpse into the future. The launch of the first gold ETFs led to a fabulous gold rally. While the price of gold was still at $400 at the time of approval, it reached $600 in 2006 and $800 in 2008. Seven years after approval, in 2011, gold reached its preliminary high of almost $2,000 (+359%).\n\nRenowned expert Will Clemente commented via Twitter:\n\nShown below is when GLD launched, allowing easy access to Gold exposure for investors. If/when Blackrock\u2019s (who has a 99% ETF approval) Bitcoin ETF launches (very similar structure to GLD), expect similar price action as it unlocks access to Bitcoin exposure for the masses.\n\nAs Bitcoin is the digital gold of the 21st century, it is also worth looking at the market capitalizations of both assets in comparison. While BTC stands at $590 billion, the gold market capitalization is around $12 trillion.\n\nIf Bitcoin were to gain just 10% of gold\u2019s market share (around $1.2 trillion), this would be a doubling of BTC\u2019s current market capitalization and, to put it simply, a doubling of Bitcoin\u2019s current price. That this target is by no means impossible is shown by BTC\u2019s all-time high of around $67,000 at the end of 2021, when its market capitalization was already around $1.2 trillion.\n\nAnother benchmark is the total market capitalization of the global stock market of over $100 trillion. Apple accounts for about 3% of this. The company is thus five times as capitalised as Bitcoin.\n\nOne factor that also needs to be taken into account when determining the price is the supply side. As expert Alessandro Ottaviani writes, BlackRock and Fidelity would only have to move 0.3% of their managed capital into Bitcoin to buy all existing BTC on the exchanges at the current price.\n\nThe on-chain analysis service Glassnode has published research on this. The analysts write that after a period of weaker relative US demand, there is a revival in 2023. This encounters a highly illiquid market.\n\nCurrently, there is a continued transfer of wealth to HODLers, while more and more coins are being withdrawn from exchanges. According to Glassnode, there are currently only 2.28 million BTC left on exchanges (11.9% of circulating supply), a short term holder supply of 2.65 BTC (13.6% of circulating supply) while 14.47 BTC are held by long term holders (74.5% of circulating supply).\n\nAll the above metrics and data suggest that Bitcoin is facing a huge bull run led by institutions. However, there is no guarantee for this. One thing to consider is that the US Securities and Exchange Commission could reject the Bitcoin spot ETFs despite BlackRock\u2019s fantastic success rate.\n\nOn the other hand, BlackRock and others need to buy BTC on the spot market for it to have a direct impact on the price. But one possibility is that BlackRock could buy Bitcoin over-the-counter (OTC). For example, the asset manager could buy the BTC seized by the US government (over 200,000) over-the-counter.\n\nThis could lead to a \u201cbuy the rumor sell the news\u201d event. But even if they bought over-the-counter from the US, this could be beneficial in the long run, as it means that the US government will no longer sell its BTC on the open market as it did in the past.\n\nAt press time, the BTC price stood at $30,388.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

During this time, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) increased by 13% and 8%, respectively.\n\nAccording to data, the number of unsettled futures contracts, or BCH open interest, increased from US$75 million the week before to over US$400 million on Monday. The cryptocurrency exchange Binance sparked the most interest in trading, with traders opening long or short positions worth US$240 million in BCH.\n\nRising available revenue implies that new cash is streaming into the market or existing members are expanding their distribution. The measurement can determine market feeling and the strength behind cost patterns.\n\nA network upgrade and an influential exchange listing have likely sparked the sudden interest in BCH trading.\n\nIn May, the Bitcoin Cash network underwent a hard fork that increased the network\u2019s privacy and security and revealed plans for \u201cCashTokens,\u201d a scaling system enabling developers to create decentralized applications directly on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.\n\nSmaller transaction sizes and smart contract functionality, which will enable Bitcoin Cash-based applications to provide Bitcoin Cash users with opportunities for recurring payments, derivatives trading, and crowdfunding, among other uses, were two additional enhancements.\n\nBCH has also logically profited from the send-off of EDX Markets, as indicated by crypto research firm Santiment.\n\nThe new exchange, which opened trading on Tuesday and supports BCH in addition to Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC), is backed by traditional financial institutions like Citadel Securities, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Charles Schwab.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "After a challenging first half of June, Bitcoin rebounded in July amid growing involvement from large financial institutions. After a rough start in June, Bitcoin (BTC) is on the up again, thanks to BlackRock and other large financial companies. BlackRock has applied to launch a Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund.\n\nThe latest institutional interest has caused a positive ripple effect for many cryptocurrencies like Pepe (PEPE). There are also suggestions of \u2018whales\u2019 buying significant chunks of the token, another contributor to the rally.\n\nAmong these crypto contenders, Millionaire Game (MG) emerges as a potential \u2018dark horse,\u2019 offering an opportunity for investors to turn their dreams into reality.\n\nWhat is MG\u2019s Unique Selling Point?\n\nUnlike many meme coins focused purely on viral appeal, Millionaire Game (MG) token seriously aims to generate millionaire-level wealth for investors. The project aims to \u201cmint\u201d a new crypto millionaire each month\n\nOnce this happens, a random lucky draw handled by smart contracts will decide the winner. The more tokens one holds, the higher their chance of getting selected.\n\nWhen is Millionaire Game (MG) Officially Launching?\n\nMillionaire Game (MG) is currently in Stage 2 of its presale, offering tokens at a discounted price of $0.0047. The Millionaire Game team aims to hold its first official token draw once the project achieves a $40 million market capitalization.\n\nThis means that investors participating in the current presale stand to gain substantially once the presale goal is reached and MG token value increases. The presale also presents an opportunity for potential investors to get involved before MG token prices potentially surge upon launch.\n\nRelated Reading: Game for creating new millionaires?\n\nBitcoin (BTC) vs. Millionaire Game (MG)\n\nWhile Bitcoin (BTC) is the most popular coin, it\u2019s also the most expensive. With BTC\u2019s market cap being north of 600 billion, any 2x gain would require significant market structure adjustments.\n\nIn contrast, Millionaire Game (MG) tokens offer a much more financially accessible entry point for potential investors and higher potential returns. This lower barrier to entry, coupled with MG\u2019s clear use case of creating a new millionaire each month, positions the project for potentially higher price appreciation.\n\nPepe (PEPE) vs Millionaire Game (MG)\n\nWhile Pepe started as a meme coin, its developers aim to introduce decentralized finance (DeFi) utilities over time. Meanwhile, Millionaire Game (MG) tokens are already integrated into DeFi applications like its staking pools that offer various rewards, including chances to win Millionaire Game\u2019s coveted prize.\n\nHowever, Millionaire Game\u2019s core differentiator and value proposition is its clear mission to create real-world crypto millionaires from relatively small MG token investments.\n\nMillionaireGame (MG) Presale Information\n\nWebsite: https://www.millionairegame.net/claim-discount\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"
