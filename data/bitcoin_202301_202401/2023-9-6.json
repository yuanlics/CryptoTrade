        "title": "Texas paid a bitcoin miner more than $31 million to power down during heat wave - Texas Public Radio",
        "content": "Get TPR's best stories of the day and a jump start to the weekend with the 321 Newsletter \u2014 straight to your inbox every day. Sign up for it here.\n\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) paid a bitcoin miner $31.7 million in energy credits in August to not mine bitcoin.\n\nDuring the August heat wave, ERCOT issued eight calls for voluntary energy conservation.\n\nPeople were asked to adjust home thermostats or delay doing laundry during the energy call.\n\nBut for the bitcoin miner Riot \u2014 located in Rockdale \u2014it was an opportunity to cash in.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s monthly report, it curtailed its power usage by more than 95% during peak demand by powering down its computers that were grinding out bitcoins.\n\n\"Texas experienced another month of extreme heat in August 2023, causing demand for electricity to spike, in some cases approaching total available supply,\"the company said in a statement.\n\n\"Riot continued to execute its power strategy by curtailing its power usage by more than 95% during periods of peak demand, forgoing revenue from its Bitcoin mining operations to instead provide energy resources to ERCOT. The company\u2019s curtailment of operations meaningfully contributed to reducing overall power demand in ERCOT, helping to ensure that consumers did not experience interruptions in service.\n\nRiot received an estimated $24.2 million in power curtailment credits under its contract with ERCOT and $7.4 million from ERCOT\u2019s demand response program.\n\nRiot made more from energy credits in August than it did from actual bitcoin mining.\n\nThe company has plans to build another facility in Corsicana, with 1GW of capacity approved by ERCOT.\n\nThe credits Texas offers to the bitcoin mining industry has made it a sought-after state for these companies to do business.\n\nA bill that would have done away with those credits passed the State Senate earlier this year, but it failed to advance past committee in the House. The Texas Legislature ended up passing two bills that expand the credits. They took effect Sept. 1."

        "title": "Bitcoin: What You Need to Know - Ramsey - Ramsey Solutions",
        "content": "Bitcoin, and digital currencies like it, are best known for two things: They\u2019re really hard to understand and their value is all over the map. Just last week, the value of the cryptocurrency market dropped by $150 billion in 24 hours!1\n\nEven so, investors have been looking for ways to make money on Bitcoin since it was created in 2009. Businesses are jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon too, with more than one-third of small- and medium-sized businesses accepting it as payment.2 And it\u2019s gaining popularity with bigger businesses like AT&T, Microsoft and Overstock. Even Wikipedia takes donations in bitcoin.3\n\nSo, is bitcoin just another get-rich-quick scheme or a legit investment worthy of your hard-earned cash? Let\u2019s talk about it.\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is the most widely known type of cryptocurrency\u2014aka digital money. There are no bills to print or coins to make. It\u2019s all done over the internet using complex computing and coding. Like gold, bitcoins are worth what people are willing to pay or exchange for them.\n\nThere are currently over 2,000 other cryptocurrencies floating around the internet, and most play off of Bitcoin\u2019s concept: anonymous and nationless digital cash. These include Ethereum, Ripple\u2019s XRP, Litecoin, Tether and Bitcoin Cash (a totally different currency, despite its namesake).4 But none are as accepted as their prototype, Bitcoin.\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Work?\n\nBitcoin users exchange their digital \u201ccoins\u201d for goods and services or trade them for cash. They pay electronically using a computer or mobile app, sort of like sending money via PayPal. Both bitcoin mining (don\u2019t worry\u2014we'll explain that later) and trading are handled anonymously, making the cryptocurrency scene prime for cybercrimes, like phishing and blackmail schemes.5 All that, combined with the fact Bitcoin is not regulated by any bank or tied to any country, makes for a scary combination.\n\nSo why is Bitcoin such a buzzword? In 2017, Bitcoin began building credibility when a large financial firm created a futures exchange for the currency.6 Let\u2019s break down what that means: Futures exchange is fancy investment lingo for a central marketplace where you buy and sell futures contracts. Futures contracts obligate a buyer or seller to buy or sell a certain type and amount of an asset (like gold) at a certain price. Depending on what people are willing to pay for these assets, futures contracts help determine the value of the asset. The Bitcoin futures exchange allowed investors to participate in the rise and fall of its value without actually having to buy the currency.\n\nIn 2020, more investment companies began to embrace Bitcoin, and many large, household-name companies started to buy and hold bitcoins as assets, adding to Bitcoin\u2019s credibility.7 And it looks like a bitcoin-associated exchange-traded fund could be approved this year.8\n\nHow Do You Buy Bitcoin?\n\nIf you are willing to take on the risk, you only need a digital currency account, like Coinbase, CEX.IO or Kraken to purchase a bitcoin. PayPal also allows its users to buy, hold and sell bitcoins. These accounts act as a digital wallet\u2014just upload your information and money and you can buy bitcoins. The process is actually scarily easy.\n\nHow Do You Mine Bitcoin?\n\nMining is the only way new bitcoins are released. It\u2019s super technical and complicated, but when you boil it all down, these anonymous miners are essentially validating a block (one megabyte) of bitcoin transactions\u2014and they have to be the first to solve a numeric problem to get paid. A miner who\u2019s lucky enough to jump through these hoops is paid 6.25 bitcoin per block ($100,000).9\n\nMarket chaos, inflation, your future\u2014work with a pro to navigate this stuff.\n\nThis is a weird, not to mention uncertain, payment agreement \u2014especially when you think about the vast brain and computing power it takes to mine bitcoins. We definitely don\u2019t recommend it\u2014even as a side gig.\n\nThe creator of Bitcoin limited the overall supply to 21 million, but the last bitcoin won\u2019t be mined until sometime in 2140.10\n\nHow Much Is Bitcoin Worth?\n\nBitcoin is worth whatever buyers are willing to pay. Without a governing authority\u2014like we have for nationally based currencies\u2014or the correlation to earnings\u2014like we have for stock prices\u2014it\u2019s really up to buyers. This is another huge risk that comes with the cryptocurrency world. The lack of a consistent pricing tool is one of the major reasons we see such huge swings in a bitcoin\u2019s worth.\n\nIn July 2010, a bitcoin was only worth eight cents. Its value had ups and downs in those early years, but continued to trend up until it broke the $1,000 mark in November of 2013. It dropped off before rising to $1,000 again in early 2017. That\u2019s when things started to get crazy. Bitcoin\u2019s value reached $5,000 in October that year, then doubled to $10,000 in November. By mid-December its value was almost $20,000! The bubble finally burst, and the value dropped to about $3,500 by November 2018.11\n\nThen, in 2020, the bitcoin roller coaster started trending up again. Its value climbed more than 300% to an all-time high of just under $42,000 per bitcoin before the latest cryptocurrency crash.12\n\nWhat Are The Risks of Bitcoin?\n\nThe biggest and most obvious risk of investing in bitcoin is its volatility. Sure, it sounds great to have your money grow by 300% in a year, but how will you feel when the bottom drops out? And based on the past performance and volatility it most likely will.\n\nWe want you to invest your money in something you can fully understand\u2014something that has a track record\u2014so you can see how it\u2019s performed over the long-term. We are not interested in seeing money grow 300% in a year. We're interested in long-term compound growth that builds real wealth for your retirement dreams.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s other big red flag? It\u2019s downright mysterious! Bitcoin\u2019s creator goes by the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. No one knows who he or she really is.13 All the transactions are anonymous, which is really shady. Plus, there\u2019s no basis for a bitcoin\u2019s value and it\u2019s completely unregulated. That adds up to a lot of unnecessary risk\u2014and we don\u2019t want you to take unnecessary risks with your retirement or your future.\n\nHere\u2019s the truth: If you can\u2019t explain an investment to a seventh grader, don\u2019t put your money in it. Your family and your retirement are too important.\n\nShould You Invest in Bitcoin?\n\nIn case you missed the point, we\u2019ll say it again: Never risk your retirement on an investment that\u2019s too complicated or unreasonably risky just because it\u2019s the new, trendy thing to do. Build your wealth slow and steady by investing in mutual funds with a history of strong performance.\n\nNow, if you\u2019re investing at least 15% of your income for retirement, and you\u2019re on track to meet your retirement goal , there\u2019s room to talk about investing some of your money in other ways. After you talk to your investing professional about your mutual fund investments and get that all squared away, ask them about the best way to invest in your financial future. That way your retirement is secure, and you might choose to participate in other new ways to invest.\n\nOur SmartVestor program is a free and easy way to connect with an experienced investing professional in your area who can answer all your questions about investing for retirement and, when you\u2019re ready, investing for fun."

        "content": "Hundreds of millions of people have crypto investments. A new report shows how many crypto millionaires and billionaires exist.\n\nHundreds of millions of people around the world have some form of crypto holdings, whether that is in bitcoin or one of the many other digital currencies.\n\nTo be exact, 425 million people use crypto, according to Henley & Partners' Crypto Wealth Report, which was released by the investment migration consultancy on Tuesday.\n\nCrypto may no longer be booming in the same way as it did at the peak of its popularity, but it remains a highly common investment. For example, over half of Gen Z (between the ages of 18 and 25) have invested in it, a report by the CFA Institute and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's Investor Education Foundation showed earlier this year.\n\nSeventy-five percent of Americans however aren't sure that investing in, trading or using cryptocurrency is currently safe or that they can rely on the currently available tools to do so, a Pew Research survey found in April. Forty-five percent of those surveyed also said their investments hadn't done as well as they thought they would \u2014 and only 15% said it had exceeded expectations.\n\nBut some seem to have found more success with crypto, and now have holdings worth millions or even billions of U.S. dollars, according to Henley & Partners.\n\nThe firm's report on Tuesday says says 88,200 people have crypto assets worth at least $1 million \u2014 less than 1% of overall crypto users. Some 40,500 of them hold their investments in bitcoin, just under 46% of the total.\n\nFar fewer people are so-called centi-millionaires who have crypto holdings valued at over $100 million. Just 182 such investors exist, with a reported 78 of them focused on bitcoin.\n\nAnd 22 people have crypto holdings worth at least $1 billion. Six of them hold their investments in bitcoin \u2014 a far smaller proportion than among the crypto millionaires and centi-millionaires.\n\nFor comparison, the total value of the crypto market, at the time the report was written, was $1.18 trillion."

        "content": "Almost half a billion people around the world have invested in some form of cryptocurrency\u2014but only 22 of those investors have billions of dollars of those holdings.\n\nIn its 2023 Crypto Wealth Report, published Tuesday, Henley & Partners said 210 million people globally were invested in Bitcoin by the end of June, while a total of 425 million held cryptocurrencies of some kind.\n\nAccording to the report, six\u2014or almost one in three\u2014of the world\u2019s crypto billionaires reached that status by holding Bitcoin.\n\nThat means just 0.000003% of those who hold Bitcoin have Bitcoin assets worth more than $1 billion.\n\nIn the wider crypto space, 0.000005% of cryptocurrency investors\u2019 assets are valued at more than $1 billion, according to the figures in the report.\n\nInvestors were much more likely to have gained millionaire status than a 10-figure net worth via their crypto holdings, Henley & Partners said, with 88,200\u2014or 0.02%\u2014of the world\u2019s crypto investors owning cryptocurrencies worth at least $1 million.\n\nBitcoin has created a similar proportion of millionaires, according to the investment migration consultancy, with 40,500 of those invested in the most widely traded cryptocurrency seeing their assets reach a value of at least $1 million.\n\nThe industry also created a number of centimillionaires\u2014people with crypto holdings of $100 million or more\u2014with 78 individuals deriving that wealth from Bitcoin and 182 gaining it from any form of cryptocurrency, the report said.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much the individuals referenced in the report initially invested in the cryptocurrencies, or how much their crypto assets had gained or lost since they held them. Henley & Partners did not immediately reply to Fortune\u2018s request for comment.\n\nWhich countries are most keen on crypto?\n\nAs part of its deep dive into the world of crypto investors, Henley & Partners also analyzed which countries had adopted cryptocurrencies most widely.\n\nThe consultancy found that the U.S. had the third-biggest public adoption of cryptocurrencies, trailing behind the UAE and Singapore.\n\nThe U.K. and Canada rounded out the top five.\n\nHenley & Partners created the Crypto Wealth Report in partnership with New World Wealth, using public information from major crypto platforms like Binance and Etherscan, as well as their own in-house databases.\n\nThe organizations measured public adoption of cryptocurrencies via the level of awareness, interest, and engagement in the general population. To score individual countries, researchers used indicators such as the percentage of crypto users relative to the total population, Google search interest, and the number of institutions in each location that offered courses on blockchain and cryptocurrency.\n\nCrypto misfortunes\n\nCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are notoriously volatile, and being prone to wild swings in value has prompted warnings from the likes of Warren Buffett and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon about their worth as investments.\n\nIn the wake of the collapse of crypto exchange FTX last year, U.S. regulators have taken steps to crack down on malpractice allegedly being undertaken in the crypto sector, suing Binance and Coinbase in quick succession earlier this year.\n\nThe legal action weighed on an already suffering crypto industry, with crypto assets across the board still reeling from 2022\u2019s widespread selloff that became known as the Crypto Winter.\n\nLast year\u2019s downturn saw more than $200 billion wiped off the market in a single day back in June, with some experts predicting the phenomenon\u2014which saw many crypto investors\u2019 life savings wiped out overnight\u2014could last through 2023 and possibly into 2024.\n\nThe spectacular implosion of crypto exchange FTX in 2022 led to some speculation over whether the world was witnessing \u201cthe end of crypto,\u201d with some heralding the company\u2019s collapse as the cryptocurrency market\u2019s \u201cLehman moment.\u201d\n\nBitcoin has recovered somewhat from last year\u2019s lowest point, but at today\u2019s price of just below $26,000 the digital token is still far from its all-time high of nearly $69,000.\n\nInvestors \u2018shouldn\u2019t put blind faith in crypto\u2019\n\nCarl Hazeley, head analyst at retail investor platform Finimize, told Fortune on Wednesday it was \u201cnot surprising\u201d only 22 of the 425,000 people who held crypto assets had become billionaires through those investments.\n\n\u201cIn fact, most retail investors actually lost money from investing in the space,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd ever since [the Crypto Winter], headlines have predominantly been filled with negative crypto stories and the collapse of prominent companies. This means the mainstream audience isn\u2019t putting, and shouldn\u2019t put, any blind faith in crypto.\u201d\n\nHazeley, a former Goldman Sachs analyst who led the IPO of food delivery giant Just Eat during his time with the banking giant, added that investors determined to put money in crypto should be watching out for signs of real-world use cases that could lead to mass adoption, like central bank digital currencies and popular payments platforms integrating digital tokens.\n\n\u201cFor those who are interested in individual crypto projects, coins like bitcoin and Ethereum seem to be a safer, more promising bet than early-stage projects,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say you should throw out your digital coins immediately. It could be worth holding onto the crypto you have, just in case it ramps up one day\u2014but don\u2019t bet on it.\u201d"

        "title": "Texas paid bitcoin miner more than $31 million to cut energy usage during heat wave - CBS News",
        "content": "As a bitcoin mining enterprise, Riot Platforms runs thousands of computers in the energy-guzzling pursuit of minting digital currency. Recently, however, the company got big bucks from Texas to lower the mining operation's electricity usage.\n\nRiot said on Wednesday that the state's power grid operator paid the company $31.7 million in energy credits in August \u2014 or roughly $22 million more than the value of the bitcoin it mined that month \u2014 to cut its energy consumption during a record-breaking heatwave in the state.\n\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which operates the state's power grid, issues the credits to incentivize companies to reduce activities that might strain the state's already overloaded energy system.\n\n\"The effects of these credits significantly lower Riot's cost to mine bitcoin and are a key element in making Riot one of the lowest cost producers of bitcoin in the industry,\" CEO Jason Les said in a statement.\n\nRiot, which is publicly traded, in 2022 reported a loss of more than $500 million on revenue of $259.2 million. In its most recent quarter, it had a loss of roughly $27 million on revenue of $76.7 million.\n\nTexas' power grid has faced growing demand from consumers and businesses in recent years as climate change leads to more extreme weather. In 2021, residents faced a blackout when a snowstorm knocked out coal and gas facilities, nuclear plants, and wind turbines.\n\nThe strain on the grid persists. On Wednesday, Texas officials declared an emergency as sky-high temperatures again threatened to trigger rolling blackouts across the state. ERCOT asked that residents and business owners conserve energy between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m., according to CBS News Texas.\n\n\"Operating reserves are expected to be low this afternoon due to continued high temperatures, high demand, low wind, & declining solar power generation into the afternoon & evening hours,\" the group said in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter).\n\nBitcoin mining, in which virtual transactions are verified on a computer network in exchange for a certain amount of bitcoin, is highly energy-intensive. Bitcoin consumes roughly 110 Terawatt Hours per year, or 0.55% of global electricity production \u2014 roughly equivalent to that consumed by Sweden, data from the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance shows.\n\nRiot did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPublic concerns\n\nHeavy energy consumption from bitcoin mining has caused a stir in Texas, with some people expressing anger that their tax dollars are subsidizing energy credits for miners. Residents of Navarro County, Texas, started a petition last year opposing a bitcoin mining facility in their area.\n\n\"This factory-that-produces-nothing will affect every single citizen of Navarro County and MUST BE STOPPED,\" reads the petition, which has amassed nearly 1,200 signatures. \"We do NOT want this enormous burden on our already fragile infrastructure.\"\n\nSome Texas lawmakers have also grown wary of cryptocurrency mining. In April, the state's senate passed a bill that would limit incentives for miners participating in the state's energy grid load-reduction program.\n\nFor now, the credits are a boon for Riot and other bitcoin miners whose profits have dried up during a cryptocurrency market downturn deepened by the collapse of exchange FTX last fall."

        "title": "Long-Awaited Bitcoin Accounting Rules to Capture Rises, Dips (2) - Bloomberg Tax",
        "content": "Crypto companies and other businesses with significant holdings of digital currencies will get long-awaited accounting rules to measure the value of the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto in their coffers, US accounting standard-setters unanimously voted Wednesday.\n\nUnder new rules expected to be published by year end, companies that hold or invest in cryptocurrency will be required to report their holdings at fair value, a measurement that aims to capture the most up-to-date value of an asset\u2014including rebounds in value after prices dip. While the new standard will inject volatility into the earnings of companies that are heavily invested in crypto, the ability to record recoveries will be an improvement over the current practice, companies and accountants have told the Financial Accounting Standards Board for months.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not very often that we can both take cost out of the system and improve the decision usefulness of information, and it makes it a really easy vote to do both of those,\u201d FASB member Christine Botosan said.\n\nThe rules will go into effect as soon as 2025, but companies will have the option to apply them early, FASB agreed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great step forward for the entire crypto market. I think it\u2019s a great step toward mainstream adoption,\u201d said Jeff Rundlet, head of accounting strategy at accounting software company Cryptio. \u201cI can see finalizing this proposal to help large corporations that are maybe scared to hold crypto on their balance sheet because they\u2019re scared of the technical complexities.\u201d\n\nRulebook Gaps\n\nNo part of the rulebook for US accounting specifically addresses how companies like enterprise software maker MicroStrategy Inc., automaker Tesla Inc., or crypto exchange Coinbase Global Inc. should recognize and measure the digital currencies they own.\n\nCompanies currently default to an American Institute of CPAs practice guide that treats most cryptocurrency as an intangible asset, a category that includes things like trademarks, copyrights, and brands\u2014all items that, unlike crypto, are rarely traded. This means companies record their crypto at the historical price they paid and assess their holdings every quarter for impairments, or value declines. If the price of Bitcoin drops even briefly during the period, it\u2019s considered impaired. Companies can\u2019t revise values upward if the market recovers.\n\nThis accounting method routinely dings the earnings of MicroStrategy, the largest public company holder of crypto.\n\nFair-value crypto reporting \u201cwould enable us to provide investors with a more relevant view of our financial position and the economic value of our bitcoin holdings, which in turn would facilitate the ability of investors to make informed investment and capital allocation decisions,\u201d MicroStrategy CFO Andrew Kang wrote to FASB in May, responding to the board\u2019s original proposal.\n\nThe accounting rules will be mandatory for all companies\u2014public and private\u2014for fiscal years beginning after Dec. 15, 2024, including interim periods within those years. This means 2025 adoption for calendar year-end companies. Companies will be allowed to adopt the rules once FASB formally publishes them later this year.\n\nCompanies are already required to present intangible assets as a line item in their balance sheets. Under the new rules, companies will have to make a separate entry for their crypto assets so investors and other readers of financial statements get a clear picture of how much a company is invested in crypto.\n\nIn addition, they will disclose in their footnotes every reporting period significant holdings of crypto and any restrictions on those holdings. On an annual basis, they will have to reconcile\u2014or disclose changes in the opening and closing balances of\u2014their crypto assets, broken out by category. They will not need to include within the reconciliation activity information about crypto assets received as payments and immediately converted to cash, FASB agreed Wednesday.\n\nIn addition, since crypto will be measured at fair value, companies will be subject to the disclosures required in the appliacable accounting rules, ASC 820, so financial statement readers know how companies came up with their measurements, FASB agreed.\n\nLong Journey\n\nFASB has rejected three separate requests since 2017 to write rules for crypto, reasoning that too few companies use Bitcoin in a material way. The board changed its tune once major companies like Tesla and MicroStrategy started investing in the blockchain-traded asset.\n\nThe board kept its focus narrow, covering assets that are created or reside on distributed ledgers based on blockchain technology and are secured through cryptography. The crypto assets have to be currently classified as intangible assets, as defined by US accounting rules, and fungible, meaning they can be interchanged with assets of the same type.\n\nNon-fungible tokens, or NFTs\u2014unique digital tokens that can be anything from video clips to digital sports trading cards\u2014won\u2019t be covered by the rules. Stablecoins and wrapped tokens\u2014digital tokens that allow crypto from one blockchain to be used on another\u2014also aren\u2019t covered.\n\nSeveral groups, including all four Big Four accounting firms, pressed FASB to include wrapped tokens in the final plan, saying they are held for similar purposes and trade at prices similar to the underlying crypto assets.\n\nThe majority of board members on Wednesday said they needed more information about the market before expanding the scope of the board\u2019s work, and rejected calls to include wrapped tokens.\n\n\u201cIntentionally keeping this project narrow has really allowed us to get this information in the hands of investors sooner,\u201d FASB member Susan Cosper said.\n\nFASB has said it will continue monitoring the crypto market and take additional action if necessary.\n\n\u201cThis won\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be the last crypto project; there should be more to follow,\u201d said Aaron Jacob, vice president of enterprise accounting at software company TaxBit. \u201cThis is the right first step.\u201d"

        "title": "Who Needs a Bitcoin ETF? Actually, the SEC Does. - Bloomberg",
        "content": "Should the US Securities and Exchange Commission approve an exchange-traded fund focused on the spot market for Bitcoin? The question has yet again gained relevance, thanks to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, which last week reversed the SEC\u2019s decision to reject a Bitcoin ETF proposed by Grayscale Investments.\n\n\n\nThe answer is yes: With a revised approach to the issue, the SEC could turn its loss into a win.\n\n\n\nSet aside the irony of using an ETF to bet on Bitcoin, a technology supposedly designed to displace such traditional intermediaries. Maybe enthusiasts expect that Bitcoin\u2019s many flaws \u2014 including extreme volatility, high transaction costs, inadequate throughput, and a large carbon footprint \u2014 will eventually be fixed, and that the benefits will somehow accrue to token holders. It isn\u2019t regulators\u2019 job to stop people from making bad decisions.\n\n\n\nSo why not just let it happen?\n\n\n\nIn a way, the SEC is already doing so: It has approved ETFs that track Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. It\u2019s less partial to ETFs like Grayscale\u2019s because they would directly track the price on crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, which don\u2019t face the same requirements for safety, soundness and investor protection that the CME does. This distinction makes little sense: If, say, \u201cwash\u201d trades on exchanges artificially inflate spot prices, they\u2019ll affect futures, too. But given that the SEC is suing Coinbase for operating an illegal securities exchange, it\u2019s understandably reluctant to approve an ETF with the company\u2019s involvement.\n\n\n\nA different approach could both establish more consistency and give regulators much-needed authority over crypto. The SEC could approve spot Bitcoin ETFs, provided that the exchanges involved meet the same standards that their regulated competitors do. Such conditionality would rationalize the rules while motivating big ETF sponsors (such as BlackRock and Fidelity) to monitor compliance.\n\n\n\nIt would also help resolve another persistent challenge. Because Bitcoin is defined as a commodity, it doesn\u2019t fall under the SEC\u2019s direct jurisdiction. Instead, it\u2019s overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \u2014 but only when it comes to futures, not spot trading. The ETF approval could thus become an important step toward setting consistent standards across crypto, including for products that don\u2019t fit into traditional categories. And it would in no way undermine the SEC\u2019s enforcement of securities laws.\n\n\n\nIn the absence of action from Congress, regulators should do what they can to bring crypto into line without killing it off. Here\u2019s an opportunity. People would still be free to lose their money on ill-considered bets. But they\u2019d be much less likely to get ripped off along the way.\n\nMore from Bloomberg Opinion:"

        "title": "Bitcoin ETF: The quiet 800-pound gorilla in the room is about to roar - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "A Bitcoin ETF will likely be approved in the U.S. by the end of 2023. The general public has no idea this is about to happen. Even crypto natives, dismayed by depressed markets and a decade of rejections by the Securities and Exchange Commission, are somehow brushing off the current state of affairs.\n\nBitcoin exchange-traded funds have been highly sought after since 2013 when the first application was submitted to the SEC and subsequently rejected. Over the past 10 years, the SEC has denied each of the several dozen ensuing proposals, including over 30 just since 2021. There are currently 10 active applications from major institutions. An uninformed observer may expect more of the same rejection, but this would be naive.\n\nTwo substantial developments in the past three months have drastically improved the prospects of an approval. Let\u2019s take a look at these developments and consider whether or not a spot ETF could revitalize Bitcoin and lift crypto out of its bear market.\n\nDevelopment 1: BlackRock\u2018s ETF bid\n\nMomentum kicked off on June 15 this year when BlackRock made waves by unexpectedly submitting a Bitcoin ETF application.\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink has spoken favorably about Bitcoin since then. Bitcoin \u201chas a differentiating value versus other asset classes, but more importantly, because it\u2019s so international it\u2019s going to transcend any one currency,\u201d Fink said. His change of tune is remarkable as he previously denounced Bitcoin as an \u201cindex of money laundering\u201d back in 2017.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s track record of ETF application approvals is nothing short of superb. The asset management giant has submitted 576 applications and all but one have been approved. Have the Bitcoin ETF tea leaves adjusted, and BlackRock taken note? BlackRock\u2019s 99.8% approval rate suggests so.\n\nSeveral other high-profile institutions including Fidelity and Ark Invest have followed suit with pending applications under review. Their filing dates and decision deadlines are largely identical. There are four deadlines during the review process in which the commission may, and often does, opt for delay and further review.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhether the SEC decision arrives early or not until final deadlines, the caliber of the institutions currently applying and their optimism are signaling one result: approval.\n\nDevelopment 2: Grayscale\u2018s court win\n\nA separate but equally significant development in the direction of ETF approval is the Aug. 29 federal court ruling that the SEC was wrong to deny Grayscale Investments\u2019 filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Grayscale previously applied to convert their Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF. The SEC denied this application, and Grayscale responded with a lawsuit arguing that the decision was incorrect. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia sided with Grayscale in its decision stating \u201cIn the absence of a coherent explanation, this unlike regulatory treatment of like products is unlawful.\u201d The court also ruled that the SEC\u2019s \u201cdenial of Grayscale\u2019s proposal was arbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\nThe court ordered the SEC to once again review Grayscale\u2019s application, effectively reversing the previous rejection.\n\nWhile the ruling does not equate to automatic approval, it strengthens the odds that approval is on the horizon. The SEC would need to provide strong support for further rejection. This begs the question: If such support exists, would it not have been included in their original rejection?\n\nOdds of approval\n\nWhile the SEC recently delayed all ETF applications on Sept. 1, as most applicants\u2019 first deadline for review was on Sept. 2, the delays were largely expected. The market responded accordingly with Bitcoin dropping about 5% from the delay announcement to around US$25,700 at the time of this writing. Despite the delays, the path to a spot ETF approval is much clearer after Grayscale\u2019s win in court. JPMorgan analysts believe this, as well as former SEC Chair Jay Clayton who says approval is \u201cinevitable.\u201d\n\nIt is reasonable to expect the SEC to approve several or even all of the filings at once. The applications are structured very similarly, and it may be considered unfair to grant any of the applicants a head start. Cathie Wood, the CEO of Ark Invest, told Bloomberg: \u201cI think the SEC, if it\u2019s going to approve a Bitcoin ETF, will approve more than one at once.\u201d Ark Invest has the earliest \u201cfinal deadline\u201d for its filing, which is slated for Jan. 10, 2024.\n\nEric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, believes there is a 75% chance of a spot Bitcoin ETF getting SEC approval this year. He ups the odds to 95% by the end of 2024.\n\nScreen Shot 2023 09 07 at 1.22.09 AM\n\nIf SEC approval is inevitable, how might we expect markets to respond?\n\nWhat crypto markets will do, post-ETF\n\nBitcoin ETFs already exist in the European Union, Canada, Brazil and Dubai. But as the U.S. is the center of world financial markets, including crypto markets, approval by its government would undeniably be a major event.\n\nAn ETF would shuttle new money into Bitcoin. While crypto exchanges such as Coinbase are the primary avenue for entering crypto today, the average American understandably has trust issues with them. KYC (know-your-customer) procedures and having to transfer funds to purchase crypto are also onerous as opposed to simply buying an ETF share. Crypto wallets, private keys and self-custody complicate matters further.\n\nThe institutions applying for a Bitcoin ETF deeply understand these hurdles. They know an ETF is an opportunity for a large segment of the population, who have thus far remained sidelined, to comfortably begin adding crypto exposure to their portfolio.\n\nBitcoin spot ETFs, in contrast to futures ETFs \u2014 which have traded in the U.S. since 2021 \u2014 may be particularly constructive to crypto markets. Spot ETFs, the type that all current applicants are applying for, would require the offering institutions to back the ETF with real Bitcoin. This differs from futures ETFs, which merely enable investors to trade an indexed derivative. In the case of futures ETFs, Bitcoin does not actually change hands. A new buyer of a spot ETF has a genuine positive impact on the price of the underlying asset.\n\nAnother way of thinking about a futures-based ETF is like two people betting on how the price of something will change. It\u2019s more akin to a side bet on what will happen. Their bet has no direct effect on the price of the asset they are betting on.\n\nA Bitcoin spot ETF issuer such as BlackRock or Fidelity must buy bona fide Bitcoin to back the shares of the fund that their customers hold. A Bitcoin spot ETF buy or sell will actually change the price of BTC.\n\nThe new source of fund flows into the space may provide the spark the industry needs to recover from a series of blows in 2022. The news itself will almost certainly cause a rush of buying in the short term. The volatility will breathe new life into the markets which have largely been subdued throughout this summer. The Grayscale decision on Aug. 29 produced a near immediate 6% Bitcoin price increase from US$26,100 to US$27,700. This increase fully re-traced on news of the SEC\u2019s choice to delay all of the outstanding applications on Aug. 31 as the first decision deadline for most filings approached.\n\nIf the ETF is approved, it is possible that market gains will extend longer than only in the short term.\n\nIn the short to medium term, a reflexivity loop may be created whereby:\n\nBitcoin price increases on ETF approval news.\n\n\u2b07\n\nInvestors desire Bitcoin allocation due to price increases.\n\n\u2939 \u2934\n\nInvestors purchase shares in a spot ETF, which drives Bitcoin prices up further.\n\nIn the long term, we will see BlackRock et al shepherding clients to diversify part of their portfolio into Bitcoin. Passive investors will buy and hold for the long term. As Bitcoin\u2019s supply is finite, the price is bound to be driven upward.\n\nGold appreciated eight years in a row after the initial spot Gold ETF was approved back in 2004. For all proclamations of Bitcoin as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d it would be fitting for Bitcoin\u2019s next upward cycle to similarly commence following ETF approval.\n\nThe world is not paying attention to Bitcoin at the moment. That will change before the year ends."

        "title": "FASB Votes In Favor of Fair Value Accounting For Bitcoin - Nasdaq",
        "content": "In a long-anticipated move, Bloomberg Tax reported that the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is set to introduce new fair value accounting rules for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. These new rules aim to provide a more accurate reflection of the market value of digital assets and bring greater transparency to the financial reporting of companies that hold cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe rules, expected to be published by the end of the year, are set to go into effect as soon as 2025, but companies will be able to apply them earlier than that, the report said.\n\nFor years, the valuation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin has been a challenging aspect of financial reporting for companies. The volatile nature of these digital assets has made it difficult to accurately assess their fair market value. Under the current accounting standards, companies often struggled to present a true picture of their financial health, as the value of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies fluctuated wildly.\n\nThe FASB's move to introduce fair value accounting rules will require companies to regularly assess the fair market value of their digital assets and report any fluctuations in value as part of their financial statements. This means that if the price of Bitcoin surges or plummets, companies will have to reflect these changes in their financial reports, providing stakeholders with a more accurate picture of their financial position.\n\nThe old treatment accounted for Bitcoin as an intangible asset, which meant if the price went lower than what companies bought it for, they had to take an impairment charge on their books, even if they didn't sell. But if the price went up, they couldn't receive any benefit on their books unless they sold. Now, with fair value accounting, periodically (i.e. every quarter) companies can report the unrealized gains and losses to get an actual benefit on their books if the price of the asset increases (without having to sell to capture it). This could make companies more likely to add bitcoin to their balance sheet and become long-term holders as they can report the appreciation without having to sell anything.\n\nInvestors and regulators will now have access to more timely and accurate information about the financial health of companies involved in the Bitcoin space. This increased transparency is expected to foster greater trust and confidence in the industry, which has often been plagued by concerns over its lack of oversight and regulation.\n\nThe move towards fair value accounting also aligns with the growing acceptance of Bitcoin in mainstream finance. As it become more integrated into the global financial system, it is essential that accounting standards evolve to accommodate digital assets. The FASB's decision to implement fair value accounting rules is a recognition of the maturing market and its importance in the broader economy.\n\nHowever, implementing fair value accounting for cryptocurrencies is not without its challenges. The volatility of Bitcoin and other digital assets means that companies will need to invest in robust valuation methods and procedures to ensure accuracy in their financial reporting. Additionally, auditors will need to develop expertise in assessing the fair market value of these assets, which can be a complex task.\n\nDespite these challenges, the introduction of fair value accounting rules for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is a significant step forward for the industry. It will provide much-needed clarity and transparency, ultimately benefiting investors, companies, and regulators alike. As the Bitcoin market continues to grow and evolve, having a standardized accounting framework in place is essential to maintain trust and ensure the responsible integration of BTC into the global financial system.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "BREVARD COUNTY, Fla. \u2013 It\u2019s a mind-boggling, eye-opening story involving your friends and neighbors losing millions of dollars and an investigator who got much of it back.\n\nTwenty percent of Americans have gotten involved in cryptocurrency, mainly the popular Bitcoin, so scam artists have too \u2013 even in Central Florida.\n\nJust in Brevard County, more than 100 people have reported they\u2019ve been ripped off.\n\nBrevard County realtor Isabel Castro is one of them.\n\n\u201cSo one of my friends on Instagram was posting the screenshots of pretty hefty deposits on his Cash App account,\u201d Castro said. \u201cAnd so it was late at night and I messaged him and asked him if it was legit and he was like \u2018yeah.\u2019 And we went back and forth a little and I thought I was talking to him. I trusted my friend, I\u2019ve known him since grade school.\u201d\n\nShe painfully discovered it wasn\u2019t her friend at the other end of an Instagram message urging her to buy Bitcoin cryptocurrency and send it off to a crypto-exchange site for a big return.\n\n\u201cSo I was seeing my deposits inflate as I sent money from my Bitcoin wallet, but then I couldn\u2019t pull any of the money out,\u201d Castro said.\n\nAnyone can buy digital currency online; Bitcoin is the most popular.\n\nBut these days, more people are buying Bitcoin at their local pharmacy or gas station and paying an obnoxiously high commission. News 6 found crypto ATMs inside several convenience stores and pharmacies in Rockledge, just down the road from the Brevard County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nAnd most of the people using the new-age ATMS are buying Bitcoin not for an investment, but because they\u2019re being scammed and don\u2019t know it, according to Brevard County Sheriff\u2019s Office Agent Justin Wood.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d Wood said. \u201cThis is one of the fastest growing frauds.\u201d\n\nAgent Wood is the lead cryptocurrency investigator at the Brevard County Sheriff\u2019s Office\u2019s Economic Crimes Unit. He\u2019s also on the Secret Service\u2019s Cyber Fraud Task Force.\n\nWood said more than 100 crypto fraud victims in Brevard County have lost more than $4.5 million in total. Isabel Castro is one of them. Agent Wood handled her case.\n\n\u201cThe coach told her to send bitcoin to this address and you\u2019ll see a great amount of return on your investment,\u201d Wood said.\n\nCastro kept buying more Bitcoin and transferring more to the crypto exchange site. She poured in $9,000 of her money until she realized she was being scammed.\n\n\u201cUntil I realized this is going to go on forever, I\u2019m never going to see this again,\u201d Castro said.\n\nAgent Wood, through his unique crypto-fraud training, followed the funds.\n\n\u201cAnd we can see they\u2019re sent to a series of different digital addresses and ultimately they funnel into one digital address,\u201d Wood said. \u201cAnd we can see it\u2019s located at an exchange. A cryptocurrency exchange company.\u201d\n\nWood sent the exchange company a search and seizure notice to freeze the funds and get back Castro\u2019s money. The exchange complied and returned Castro\u2019s $9,000.\n\nCastro\u2019s case was only the latest where Wood got results.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done probably about a hundred cases and I\u2019d say we successfully made probably about 30 recoveries,\u201d Wood said.\n\nAgent Wood is one of the few investigators in Florida who\u2019ve trained with the Secret Service at their digital currency course in Alabama. He alone has closed 80 cryptocurrency cases in Brevard County.\n\n\u201cIn the past three years we\u2019ve successfully seized and recovered about $700,000 worth of cryptocurrency,\u201d Wood said.\n\nWood said as much as people would like to believe that cryptocurrency can make them a quick buck, anyone offering quick and high returns is likely a scammer.\n\nAnd anyone who pressures you into buying cryptocurrency is likely a scammer, Wood said.\n\nCastro said she wishes she had picked up the phone and called her \u201cfriend\u201d to discover his Instagram account had been hacked.\n\nBrevard County residents who need help can reach out to Wood at justin.wood@bcso.us.\n\nGet today\u2019s headlines in minutes with Your Florida Daily:"

        "title": "Texas paid bitcoin miner Riot $31.7 million to shut down during heat wave in August - CNBC",
        "content": "During the crypto boom of 2021, Riot Platforms was raking in cash from bitcoin mining. Now the company is losing so much money that it's counting on energy credits from selling power back to the Texas grid to keep its costs under control.\n\nRiot said on Wednesday that it earned $31.7 million in energy credits last month from Texas power grid operator ERCOT. The company generated the credits by voluntarily curtailing its energy consumption during a record-breaking heatwave.\n\nThe total value of the credits dwarfed the 333 bitcoin the company mined in August, worth about $8.9 million dollars as of the end of the month.\n\n\"August was a landmark month for Riot in showcasing the benefits of our unique power strategy,\" said Jason Les, CEO of Riot, in the company's press release. \"The effects of these credits significantly lower Riot's cost to mine Bitcoin and are a key element in making Riot one of the lowest cost producers of bitcoin in the industry.\"\n\nIt's a dramatic strategy shift for Riot, whose revenue soared almost 8,000% in 2021 from booming demand for bitcoin. The crypto market reversed in 2022, leading to a net loss of over $500 million for the year. In the latest quarter, the company lost $27.7 million.\n\nBitcoin's recovery this year from 2022's lows has boosted Riot's stock, which is up about 230% so far in 2023, closing Wednesday at $11.24. But it's still way down from its 2021 peak of $77.90.\n\nBitcoin miners broadly have struggled amid low trading volume, according to an analyst note from JPMorgan Chase on Sept. 1. The firm found that the market cap of the 14 U.S.-listed bitcoin miners it tracked fell 21% in August to $9.7 billion. Riot was the worst-performing stock in that list, falling 39% for the month.\n\nBallooning energy prices have also helped to drag down profits for the sector, so companies have turned to alternative sources of income."

        "title": "3 Crypto Stocks in Focus as Bitcoin Gears Up for a Comeback - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency rally came to a sudden halt in August. The price of Bitcoin (BTC) fell below the $25,000 mark in late August, its lowest level since mid-June, as volatility continues to grip markets ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s September policy meeting.\n\nBitcoin staged a solid turnaround from its 2022 lows and was trading above $31,500 in early July. However, the rally stalled in late July, and August saw somewhat of a bloodbath for Bitcoin, with a nearly 10% decline.\n\nIn fact, the start to September is also rocky, holding below the psychological level of $26,000 over the past 24 hours. So, what\u2019s in store for Bitcoin in September?\n\nTraditionally, the price of Bitcoin has been closely correlated with the performance of the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 stock index. This is because both tech stocks and cryptocurrencies are viewed as risky assets, and investors often respond to market conditions in a similar manner when assessing their investment strategies.\n\nRight now, there are a lot of positives for having faith in Bitcoin despite its recent lows. Last month, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA came up with robust earnings. This gave not only investors confidence to invest in tech stocks but also cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, a boost.\n\nMoreover, the long-date Treasury yields hit multi-year highs in August. The 10-year Treasury yield hit its highest level since 2007 last month. However, it has since fallen to 4.23% as of Sep 5.\n\nThe Fed has so far increased interest rates by 525 basis points, taking the benchmark rate to the range of 5.25-5.5%. The measure has resulted in inflation declining sharply over the past year. However, inflation remains a lot higher than the Fed\u2019s target of 2%. This has kept the Fed open for more interest rate hikes, which has been putting pressure on the bond yield.\n\nHowever, a series of economic data released over the past week indicates that the labor market is cooling. This has raised hopes of the Fed keeping interest rates unaltered in its September meeting. The CME FedWatch Tool shows that around 95% of the market participants are now confident about the Fed pausing its interest rate hikes in September.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis definitely bodes well for high-risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Moreover, the growing interest in cryptocurrencies among financial giants is expected to drive up the prices of Bitcoin and other digital currencies in the near future.\n\nFor instance, BlackRock, Inc. BLK has urged regulators to create a spot Bitcoin ETF, a move that could boost retail investor involvement.\n\nSimilarly, The Charles Schwab Corporation SCHW is backing a new exchange called EDX Markets, indicating a growing institutional interest in the crypto space. These developments could have a positive impact on the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rally may have taken a pause but the future holds promise. Currently, it is advisable for investors to contemplate accumulating cryptocurrencies through a buying-on-the-dip strategy. Each decline in cryptocurrency prices may present an advantageous opportunity for acquisitions, potentially resulting in significant gains as the market's volatility eventually settles.\n\nStocks to Watch\n\nRobinhood Markets, Inc. HOOD operates a financial services platform in the United States. Its platform allows users to invest in stocks, exchange-traded funds, options, gold and cryptocurrencies.

        "title": "El Salvador Launches Education Program To Teach Bitcoin In Every School - Nasdaq",
        "content": "El Salvador, the first nation to officially adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, is once again making headlines in the world of cryptocurrency. With the combined efforts of My First Bitcoin, Bitcoin Beach, and the Ministry of Education, the nation announced the inception of an ambitious pilot program today. This initiative aims to incorporate Bitcoin education in all schools across the country by 2024.\n\nInitiated on the 2-year mark of the groundbreaking Bitcoin Law, this program is set to train 150 public school teachers about Bitcoin. After receiving their training, these educators will disperse across the nation, integrating Bitcoin knowledge into their respective curriculum and classrooms.\n\nThe key player, My First Bitcoin, is a non-profit and Bitcoin education-focused NGO rooted in El Salvador. Having imparted Bitcoin education to over 25,000 in-person students since 2021, they have shown an unwavering commitment to enlightening the masses about this digital currency. Their comprehensive 10-week Bitcoin Diploma is now in its 5th edition, which the Ministry of Education adopted as foundational material to structure the country's curriculum.\n\nThe success of Bitcoin Beach, a pioneering project that fosters a Bitcoin circular economy, played a pivotal role in El Salvador's decision to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender. Their invaluable contributions span from facilitating trainings to funding the printing of educational material.\n\nAnother crucial supporter, The Bitcoin Office, is a governmental entity birthed in El Salvador. Their continuous dedication ensured the triumphant realization of this project. Their alliance with Cubo further highlights their commitment to not only mainstream Bitcoin education but also to promote elite developer programs.\n\nWith a clear vision, My First Bitcoin was established with dual aspirations: to position El Salvador as a global front-runner in Bitcoin education and to make the country a beacon of inspiration for the world.\n\nAs the Ministry of Education embarks on this novel journey, the global community is undoubtedly watching with keen interest. The impact of My First Bitcoin has already rippled beyond El Salvador's borders. Collaborating with grassroots projects in over 20 countries, they have generously shared their open-source resources and best practices. Their influence is also evident in early dialogues with two Latin American governments, which are considering large-scale Bitcoin education programs.\n\nEl Salvador's pioneering spirit and dedicated partners are shaping the future of Bitcoin education, fostering a generation that is well-versed with the world's most renowned cryptocurrency. The nation stands as a testament to what's possible when innovation meets education.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "22-year-old who lost $80,000 in crypto: 'I was investing with money I didn't necessarily have' - CNBC",
        "content": "Ethan Nguonly, a 22-year-old software engineer, started investing in the stock market with the help of his parents before he was a teenager. Today, his investment portfolio includes close to $135,000 in retirement and brokerage accounts, plus two houses. But he didn't get there without making what he now calls his biggest financial mistake. Between November 2021 and June 2022, Nguonly says he lost about $80,000 by investing in crypto on margin. His losses include $30,000 of his original investment and an estimated $50,000 in unrealized gains. Investing with margin involves using borrowed funds to purchase an asset. Nguonly says he had already made pretty hefty crypto investments in bitcoin and ethereum of around $40,000, plus a few hundred dollars in altcoins like shiba inu and dogecoin. But as bitcoin's price went on a tear, he decided to buy more \u2014 about $15,000 worth \u2014 on margin. For a moment, Nguonly says he was up about $50,000 as the price of bitcoin reached its all-time high. But at the end of 2021 the crypto market took a turn, and by the summer of 2022 bitcoin's price crashed over 70%. \"I was investing with some money that I didn't necessarily have,\" Nguonly tells CNBC Make It. \"Once the crypto market kind of reversed, my losses were amplified.\"\n\nBuying on margin: Know the risks\n\nInvesting on margin is a sophisticated strategy that can prove lucrative if your investments continue to perform well. But it amplifies your losses if the market takes a dip. When you buy on margin, you're borrowing money from a broker in order to invest more than you otherwise could have. As a result, you can boost your earnings, but are also at risk of losing more if the market goes the other way, as Nguonly experienced. Bitcoin's price crashed so much he faced a margin call, meaning he had to sell a significant portion of his holdings to cover the cost of the loan. To make a profit when buying on margin, your investments have to outperform the cost of the loan itself, which is part of why your losses will be greater if your investments depreciate. This can happen with any kind of security, but particularly volatile assets like cryptocurrency may make you more vulnerable to losses like Nguonly's. Indeed, investing in cryptocurrency in any capacity has always been risky. Even during the run-up to bitcoin's November 2021 all-time peak, the investments remained speculative, volatile and mostly unregulated. While investing is an important factor in building wealth, it always comes with risk. Especially when it comes to crypto, experts recommend only investing what you can afford to lose. It's also important to avoid investing techniques you don't understand, such as options trading or investing on margin. \"Margin accounts can be very risky and they are not appropriate for everyone,\" the Securities and Exchange Commission warns in its guide for investors. There are rules, like minimum deposits and borrowing limits, from the Federal Reserve and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority aimed at ensuring people who open margin accounts know the risks and understand the financial commitment they're making.\n\n'Only invest money you have'"

        "title": "Firms can mark Bitcoin rebounds on their balance sheets in long-awaited accounting change - Fortune",
        "content": "The wonkier corners of Crypto Twitter were buzzing on Wednesday on news that the Financial Accounting Standards Board, a.k.a. FASB, had unanimously passed a measure that will bring a big change to how companies hold crypto on their balance sheets. This has immediate implications for the likes of Bitcoin-buying Block, Tesla, and MicroStrategy\u2014and could potentially lead other large firms to consider adding crypto to their treasuries.\n\nMost people are understandably reluctant to dive into the finer points of corporate accounting, but the big change is not hard to grok. It stems from the fact that, for the longest time, the head bean counters stayed silent on crypto\u2014refusing to provide guidance for how to value it on a balance sheet. This led to Bitcoin being chucked into a category called intangible assets along with things like trademarks and goodwill. In practice, this meant that any company holding crypto had to mark down its value as an \u201cimpairment\u201d if the price dropped\u2014but could not record a gain if the price shot back up.\n\nThanks to this week\u2019s FASB vote, that practice is out the window, and very soon firms will be able to tally a gain whenever their crypto holdings rebound from a price shock. While this has been in the works for many months, the new accounting regime is now official\u2014albeit with a few quirks. Namely, the updated rules apply to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies, but not to the synthetic or \u201cwrapped\u201d versions of the currencies that power much of the DeFi landscape. Likewise, stablecoins and NFTs are not included, according to a helpful Bloomberg Tax report on the news.\n\nAll of this is unlikely to inspire most firms to rush out and add crypto to their balance sheets, especially in the current bear market. But the fact there are finally clear accounting rules in the first place is likely to make corporate finance departments less skittish if their company wants to experiment with Bitcoin and Ethereum in one way or another.\n\nMore broadly, the FASB rule change comes at a time when the financial landscape around crypto is maturing rapidly. Other recent changes include Coinbase announcing a crypto lending service for large investors, and firms in the hyper-volatile Bitcoin mining sector learning to employ hedging strategies in order to stabilize revenue.\n\nThese developments mean that, more than ever, the forces of traditional finance are likely to shape the next phase of crypto. For now, though, the crypto industry\u2019s main concern is coming up with a way to rekindle interest in the sector in the first place.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nGenesis Global Capital, which made large loans to the hedge funds Alameda and 3AC, is suing parent company DCG to recover over $600 million in unpaid loans even as the firms negotiate a bankruptcy settlement.

        "title": "Bitcoin above US$26,000; JP Morgan working on blockchain payment system - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin rose on Friday morning in Asia to trade above the resistance level of US$26,000, leading a rally across most top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies. The exceptions were Cardano and Toncoin, which both posted minor losses. Ether logged moderate gains but remained below US$1,650. U.S. financial services giant JPMorgan Chase & Co. is reportedly exploring a blockchain-based payment and settlement system, raising optimism for more institutional adoption of blockchain. U.S. stock futures traded mixed, after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed lower on Thursday. Stronger-than-expected jobs data has added to U.S. rate hike concerns.\n\nBitcoin spearheads crypto winners\n\nBitcoin rose 1.62% in the last 24 hours to US$26,179.43 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, turning a weekly loss into a gain of 0.75%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency had been trading between around US$25,500 and US$26,000 since Saturday. It reached an eight-day high of US$26,409.30 early Friday morning.\n\nJPMorgan, the largest bank in the U.S. by asset size, is \u201cin the early stage\u201d of developing a blockchain-based digital deposit token for cross-border payments and settlements. The bank has already laid out most of the underlying infrastructure, but will wait for approval from U.S. regulators before making the token itself, Bloomberg reported Friday.\n\nDeposit tokens are transferable digital assets representing deposit claims against a commercial bank. Token transactions take place on blockchains, making deposits faster and cheaper than traditional methods.\n\n\u201cIt is another sign that large corporations continue to build their blockchain capabilities during this bear market,\u201d Markus Thielen, head of research & strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, said in an emailed comment.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to crypto, some traditional players are holding back while others are making strides,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of Asia-Pacific business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock. PayPal\u2019s announcement that it will launch a stablecoin has started a domino effect of institutional action in crypto, he said.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cOnce a large player kicks things off and competitors see that as a desirable/profitable set-up, it won\u2019t be long until other players launch their own solution, if only to stay relevant in an ever-advancing space,\u201d d\u2019Anethan added.\n\nThe market is currently waiting on a decision from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding another U.S. financial giant \u2014 BlackRock. On June 15, the world\u2019s top asset manager applied for approval to create a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\n\u201cWhile most expect the SEC Blackrock decision to hit the market in October, the news of a potential ETF approval can also come any time,\u201d Thielen said.\n\n\u201cOnce Bitcoin regains some momentum, the rally could have legs and bring prices back above US$30,000,\u201d he added.\n\nElsewhere, Martin Gruenberg, chairman of the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), said on Thursday that despite the apparent good health of the U.S. economy, the country\u2019s banking industry \u201ccontinues to face significant downside risks from the effects of inflation, rising market interest rates, and geopolitical uncertainty.\u201d\n\nBitcoin prices have historically benefited from uncertainties in the banking system, such as the crisis at Zurich-based lender Credit Suisse in March. The bank\u2019s sudden collapse sent the token\u2019s price from below US$27,000 to over US$28,000 on March 19.\n\nEthereum gained 0.77% to US$1,644.68 over the past 24 hours and edged down 0.07% for the past seven days.\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies logged small gains. Cardano\u2019s ADA and the TON network\u2019s Toncoin were the only tokens that posted losses, dipping 0.14% and 0.70% respectively. But both coins posted gains for the week at 1.07% for ADA and 3.68% for Toncoin.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization gained 1.37% to US$1.05 trillion. Trading volume dropped 11.95% to US$23.81 billion.\n\nStrong US jobs data; China restricts iPhone use for government employees\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading mixed as of 09:40 a.m. in Asia. The three major U.S. indexes also closed mixed on Thursday, with the Nasdaq Composite posting a 0.89% loss. All the main Asian indexes were down Thursday morning, with Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng leading the losses with a 1.34% drop.\n\nInitial jobless claims in the U.S. fell to 216,000 for the week ending Sept. 2, the lowest level since February. That was short of the 234,000 forecast by experts in a Reuters poll.\n\nLast week\u2019s August jobs data pointed to a gradual softening in the U.S. labor market. But Thursday\u2019s jobless report shows \u201cthe labor market is still tight,\u201d Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told Bloomberg. She said the data could influence the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s thinking on interest rates,\n\n\u201cMore moderation in job growth will be needed to keep rate hikes further down the road off the table,\u201d Vanden Houten said.\n\nOn the other side, multiple Federal Reserve officials said on Thursday they thought the U.S. central bank should keep interest rates unchanged at its meeting on Sept. 20. In July, the Fed raised the rate to between 5.25% and 5.50% \u2014 the highest level in the past 22 years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not yet convinced that we\u2019ve extinguished excess inflation. But in today\u2019s complex economic environment, returning inflation to 2 percent will require a carefully calibrated approach\u2014not endless buckets of cold water,\u201d Lorie Logan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas said on Thursday.\n\nLogan said that another rate hike pause would be \u201cappropriate\u201d when the Fed meets again later this month.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 95% chance the central bank will maintain the current rate unchanged in September, up from 93% on Thursday. It gives a 57.4% chance for another pause in November.\n\nMeanwhile, multiple Chinese government agencies have instructed their staff not to bring iPhones to work amid tensions between Beijing and Washington. The government may also expand restrictions to state-owned enterprises and affiliated organizations.\n\nChina is one of Apple\u2019s largest foreign markets. It accounted for nearly a fifth of the firm\u2019s global revenue in 2022. Apple\u2019s shares closed 2.92% lower on Thursday following the reports.\n\n\u201cThe Nasdaq is sinking as one bad Apple spoils a bunch of mega-cap tech stocks,\u201d Edward Moya, senior market analyst at U.S.-headquartered foreign exchange corporation OANDA, told Fortune on Friday.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s growth story is heavily reliant on China and if the Beijing crackdown intensifies that could pose a big problem to the bunch of other mega-cap tech companies that rely on China,\u201d Moya said.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "title": "How to Buy Bitcoin Cash? - FX Empire",
        "content": "Buying Bitcoin can be done quickly and easily with 2 steps. Below is a step-by-step guide to buying Bitcoin cash:\n\nStep 1 \u2013 Create a Bitcoin Cash Wallet\n\nSame as other cryptocurrencies, you have to open a bitcoin cash wallet in order to store the coin safely. There are many Bitcoin cash wallets providers that allow you to hold Bitcoin Cash as it is, usually, a similar wallet to Bitcoin. One of the most recommended wallet for Bitcoin Cash is BTC.com. Software wallets include JAXX and Exodus. For hardware wallets that provide the most secure method to hold cryptocurrencies, you can use Trezor or Ledger.\n\nStep 2 \u2013 Find the Best Bitcoin Cash Exchange\n\nAs Bitcoin Cash is one of the most popular and used cryptocurrencies, there are many exchanges that support Bitcoin Cash:\n\nCoinbase \u2013 One of the biggest cryptocurrencies exchanges that provide Bitcoin cash trading with US dollars. In addition, You can store your Bitcoin cash coins in Coinbase platform.\n\nBinance \u2013 Currently, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange by volume allows traders and investors to purchase Bitcoin cash with other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. For those who own Bitcoin or Ethereum, the process is easier as all is needed is to register and open an account at Binance.\n\nFor those that do not own Bitcoin or Ethereum and prefer to trade via Binance as it has a wide selection of cryptocurrencies, we would advise you to acquire Bitcoin or Ethereum through Coinbase.\n\nBitcoin Cash Exchanges\n\nThe next method, if you don\u2019t hold Bitcoin cash, is to go to an exchange and buy it. Some of the major Bitcoin exchanges like CEO.IX, Kraken, and Bittrex have already started trading in Bitcoin cash and are witnessing surging volumes in them. So, all that you need to do is to visit these exchange sites, take a look at demand and supply and the price and go and get them. Though Kraken had begun trading in Bitcoin cash in the last few days, it is only today that they started accepting deposits and withdrawals in Bitcoin cash, which is a sign of the growing use of this cryptocurrency in the recent days.\n\nOnce you have received your Bitcoin cash, either from the exchange or by buying it from the exchange, you can use it any way you want, just like how you would spend any other altcoin for that matter. You could also convert it into Bitcoin again and use the bitcoins as well. It\u2019s as simple as that.\n\nBut there are a few things to keep in mind though. The addresses are identical for both bitcoin and bitcoin cash and hence, if you reveal one, it means that you automatically reveal the other as well and this is quite risky in terms of security and privacy.\n\nAlso, you reveal your public key and not your private key which would, in turn, mean that you are losing out on a specific layer of security that is inbuilt into the cryptocurrency industry. These are just a couple of things that you need to keep in mind before you start using Bitcoin cash. One of the ideas to overcome this problem would be to move the bitcoin or bitcoin cash to an entirely new address so that you can ensure the safety and security of the other part.\n\nWhat are the Benefits of Bitcoin Cash compare to Bitcoin?\n\nThe start of the Bitcoin cash market has been bright as it started off with a large market cap and it also started with a large price tag. Due to the split, Bitcoin cash is no longer associated in any manner with Bitcoin and has to survive on its own. How it survives will be known in the coming days as we wait for more and more miners to jump into the Bitcoin cash market and begin mining.\n\nJust like any other cryptocurrency, it is very important that Bitcoin cash gets enough processing power (hashrate) from the miners to keep building the blockchain, else it will slowly wither away and die. It is important for the Bitcoin cash industry to build itself a good ecosystem around it so that it would be able to keep those who invest in it satisfies. Those will be important parameters for such instruments to succeed.\n\nBitcoin cash has to develop its own market and show itself to be different and more useful than Bitcoin. So far, the pickup in Bitcoin cash, in the transactions market, has been slow but it is expected to pick up speed and strength in the coming days as more and more traders and investors begin to realize that it is here to stay. One of the major advantages it already has is the fact that anyone who owned Bitcoin on August 1 will automatically get an equal number of Bitcoin cash and with the proliferation of wallets and with exchanges accepting them, bitcoin cash is likely to do well.\n\nAnother major advantage of Bitcoin cash is its larger block limit. This was one of the major drawbacks of the Bitcoin market and this was the reason why the supporters of Bitcoin cash wanted a split in the first place. Now, with the higher limit, they would be able to perform a much larger number of transactions which would help the Bitcoin cash to propel the next stage of this technology.\n\nWhat\u2019s Gonna Happen with Bitcoin Network?\n\nWhat this means for the Bitcoin network is to set up the stage for the growth of technology and also a stance that the technology would keep everyone in mind as it grows. What this split has done is that it has shown the market that the technology is willing to listen to the market and its needs and adapt itself accordingly. Once the Bitcoin cash market begins to thrive, it will also show that this technology split does not necessarily mean one is better than the other or that one has to die to make the other survive but rather that both can survive and help in the growth of the network and the technology.\n\nThis could also result in lower transaction fees for both bitcoin and bitcoin cash which would, in turn, mean that investors and traders are more likely to pick up more bitcoins and bitcoin cash. This reduction in fees can be achieved due to the fact that Bitcoin cash has helped to expand the size of the network which would mean that there is less congestion now.\n\nSuch advantages are likely to drive more and more of Bitcoin\u2019s traders and miners towards Bitcoin cash and this would help this market to thrive, grow technologically and also mature to be an example for other cryptocurrencies. The recent split phenomenon will boost confidence in such instruments which would, in turn, lead to more countries beginning to adopt such technology.\n\nAlready, the Bitcoin market has begun to show its approval as the demand has grown and prices have shot through the $7000 mark as of this writing. This shows that the Bitcoin network is alive and thriving as well, which is likely to help Bitcoin cash achieve the same effect."

        "title": "Bitcoin remains tied to the US economy, and that needs to change - Blockworks",
        "content": "One of the many narratives surrounding Bitcoin is that it represents a pathway to an alternative global economy that might contest the US dollar\u2019s supremacy. After all, Bitcoin did emerge as a counterpoint to the 2008 US financial debacle, a digital champion for free markets and sound money.\n\nYet bitcoin the asset remains intricately linked to the US economy. Factors like dollar-pegged stablecoins, US regulatory sway and the sheer weight of US financial entities anchor the cryptocurrency to the old greenback.\n\nWill this continue to hold true in an increasingly multipolar world? The simple answer is \u201cyes, for now.\u201d Is this the outcome we should expect in the long term? That would be a hard \u201cno.\u201d\n\nWhat hinders Bitcoin\u2019s independence\n\nThree principal factors are roping bitcoin to the dollar, hindering its complete global currency independence:\n\nDollar-pegged stablecoins\n\nStablecoins such as USDT and USDC have amplified crypto\u2019s reliance on the US economic landscape. Bitcoin predominantly trades against the US dollar on numerous crypto platforms, often indirectly via stablecoins.\n\nThe controversial issuer of USDT, Tether, recently shared its Q2 attestation report, where it grew to a $71 billion market cap, and it\u2019s even larger today. In total, stablecoins are a $124 billion market, with significant influence over bitcoin\u2019s own $500 billion one.\n\nWhen a single asset makes up roughly 25% of another\u2019s market cap, the two are correlated.\n\nWith bitcoin\u2019s value so closely intertwined with the US economy, bitcoin users around the world are prey to any instability the currency faces, meaning it truly isn\u2019t a free market yet.\n\nRegulatory dynamics\n\nThe US regulatory landscape has a significant impact on bitcoin\u2019s market sentiment. Any positive or negative news regarding policy can have ripple effects on the entire crypto market, including bitcoin.\n\nGlobally, crypto\u2019s legality and mainstream acceptance are at stake. The US exerts influence on global crypto policies, framed mainly by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)\u2019s 2021 guidelines. And the US, given its stature, plays a pivotal role in directing FATF\u2019s advice.\n\nUS legislative moves also shape institutional investor inclinations. The unfolding saga of the prospective Bitcoin ETF is a prime example of this, with entities like BlackRock and Fidelity patiently awaiting the SEC\u2019s verdict. The recent Grayscale victory is a sure sign that institutional adoption isn\u2019t a dream but a reality.\n\nInstitutional acceptance\n\nUS institutional adoption has further intertwined bitcoin with the nation\u2019s economy. ETF outcomes aside, significant financial bodies now include bitcoin in their asset arrays, tying its value to US market sentiments.\n\nThis means that those using bitcoin as an alternative investment are still at the whims of US firms. Let\u2019s remember the impact Tesla\u2019s purchase of $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin had on the market.\n\nThe path to decoupling\n\nMany investors turn to bitcoin as a hedge against US dollar depreciation in uncertain economic climates. Yet, if current conditions continue, bitcoin might more closely mirror traditional US investment avenues like equities.\n\nThis scenario is problematic, to say the least. Free markets shouldn\u2019t hinge on the US economic climate, legislative landscape or decisions by its major corporations. Bitcoin was envisioned to counter exactly this.\n\nFortunately, the bond between Bitcoin, the US and the broader American economy is breakable. As the crypto realm matures, multiple factors can help Bitcoin evolve into a truly global, uncorrelated asset.\n\nEmerging stablecoins with diverse denominations could promote a shift from USD-centric tokens. Enthusiasts advocate for stablecoins tethered to varied currencies to lessen dependency on the US dollar, fostering a truly diversified crypto market.\n\nAlternative fiat currencies include the Japanese yen or Chinese yuan as dominant bitcoin trading counterparts. Europe\u2019s MiCA legislation might lead to more diversity in the form of EUR-denominated stablecoins. But this potential shift will take time \u2014 likely many years.\n\nThere\u2019s also notable momentum toward augmenting bitcoin\u2019s global adoption, reducing US market dependency. Efforts include regional partnerships, educational drives, and crafting use cases specific to areas like Africa and Latin America, where Bitcoin\u2019s appeal as a sovereign currency resonates.\n\nCrypto champions are continuing to actively working with regulators globally, striving for balanced rules that spur innovation without undue US influence. This regulatory diversity poses challenges for regions reluctant to welcome Bitcoin and its peers.\n\nTechnological strides are boosting Bitcoin\u2019s reach and applicability, rendering it more apt for regular global transactions. Universal adoption for purposes beyond just a value reserve could insulate Bitcoin from single-economy volatilities.\n\nReflecting on what\u2019s to come\n\nBitcoin\u2019s intrinsic potential to foster free markets has remained unchanged since 2009. Roughly fifteen years after its inception, stakeholders \u2014 both within and outside the US \u2014 are still unlocking its possibilities.\n\nIn this narrative, the US dollar, economy and geopolitical clout remain pivotal in the cryptocurrency\u2019s evolution. Yet as bitcoin and its ecosystem evolve, its reliance on the US dollar has a chance to diminish, heralding a more balanced global economic landscape.\n\nDanny Oyekan is the founder and CEO of Blockfinex, a Dubai-based digital asset exchange platform.

        "content": "Riot Platforms Inc., one of the largest Bitcoin miners in Texas, said it earned a record $31.7 million from power credits during the August heat wave that swept across the Lone Star State.\n\nThe Castle Rock, Colorado-based company has earned credits in part by participating in the demand response programs offered by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which is the state\u2019s power grid operator. Those programs aim to ease power shortages by paying certain consumers for reducing or shifting their energy usage. Miners like Riot have been able to make millions from such shortages while residents in Texas see soaring electricity prices and power outages during extreme weathers such as heat waves and winter storms."

        "content": "Texas paid bitcoin miner Riot \u2013 the most power-intensive bitcoin operation in the country \u2013 $31.7 million during the month of August to conserve energy, a CNBC article reported.\n\nRiot, located in Rockdale, an hour east of Austin, is by no means a successful operation \u2013 CNBC reported that they only made about $8.9 million this month. So they and other failing bitcoin operations are turning to \u201calternative sources of income,\u201d as CNBC puts it \u2013 like the Texas grid operator \u2013 to generate profits.\n\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas relies on large industrial consumers for \u201cdemand response\u201d programs, where they offer credits in exchange for conservation. They rely on average residential customers for the same thing \u2013 just without the compensation. This practice has sparked outrage among Texans who have been repeatedly asked to conserve voluntarily amid triple-digit heat, while actually paying higher electric bills than usual. \u201cThis is a prime example of state officials putting corporate profits over people,\u201d said Public Citizen\u2019s Adrian Shelley. \u201cIt's fundamentally unfair to average Texans, many of whom struggled to pay the monthly bill to keep their homes cool this brutal summer.\u201d\n\nAnd Riot is being paid by those same consumers: A recent New York Times investigation found that 10 bitcoin mining operations in Texas have accounted for ratepayers\u2019 electric bills rising by 5% annually, and five of those have pocketed a combined $60 million since 2020. During the 2021 winter storm, the Bitdeer facility neighboring Riot got an $18 million windfall. The two combined use the same amount of energy as the nearest 300,000 homes.\n\nCurrently the only compensated demand response program available to Austin Energy ratepayers gives customers who install smart thermostats credits toward their electric bills."

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Reflecting 'Weak Intermediate-Term Momentum:' Technical Analyst - CoinDesk",
        "content": "Taking a look at the crypto markets. Let's let's discuss more about the charts with none other than fair lead strategies, founder and managing partner, Katie Stockton. Hello, Katie Happy September. Oh, yeah, thanks. You too. That was the exciting month in trading. And I know you're, you're all excited about the charts here that you have, we have several. Um I I kind of want to look at uh the first chart we have here is Bitcoin because uh yeah, you, you kind of see Bitcoin in a very, in a cloudy situation. Uh explain how cloudy it really is for Bitcoin. Well, it's a really good way to put it, Lawrence, the, the cloud model that you see on the chart, it's the shaded area and it's a trend following model based on price solely and it is really widely used by FX traders. Now we see that it has held a lot of relevance for Bitcoin and many other AL coins as well in that the last relief rally or the sort of intermediate term up move met resistance right at the upper boundary of that cloud and there and it kind of preserved the downtrend that started in 2022. So now, unfortunately, we have a corrective phase that left that resistance intact and that does reflect weak intermediate term momentum. So we, we have some setbacks here on the chart. There's very strong support that's uh just, just below current levels. And you'll see that it's roughly 25,200. It defines former resistance, which was the upper boundary of a trading range. It'd be a natural place for Bitcoin to stabilize at least temporarily. However, we have seen some others including Ether take out equivalent support. So that doesn't give us much peace of mind. Yeah, I, I kind of want to take a look at that Ether chart because again, Ether and Bitcoin are so highly correlated uh that you, you, you wonder if Ether is sort of, uh, how am I say leading the situation or at least, um, serving as a for, for Bitcoin. But it certainly has, uh, some scary warnings for people who are trading Bitcoin, correct. Uh We have to have the same. Mhm. Yeah. So with, with the Ether trade, I mean, they have been very positively correlated and, and actually somewhat neutral, relative strength between the two of late. But it, it is within the context of a broader relative up trend favoring Bitcoin. We tend to usually see Ether underperform when both are moving lower because it's seen as a bit riskier perhaps than Bitcoin or Bitcoin just being the stalwart in the Cryptocurrency markets. So right now, you know, we have a, a relatively fresh breakdown and ether below some support. It puts next support or around 15 30 which is based on the bottom boundary that cloud that you see. So there is of course room to that level, you see that there's downside momentum for the weekly MAC D indicator that's pictured on our chart. And that means that oversold conditions might not be something to get excited about. At least not yet. What we have up actually is, is the relative price of, of Bitcoin it priced as E um And so when it goes up, that's Bitcoin strength. And I don't want to say Bitcoin strengthening against E because they're both going down. But it's more like eth is weakening more steadily or, or, or more severely that if you will than Bitcoin in that chart. So, so that's a relative strength comparison, right. So in this situation, you, you see that as an uptrend, in other words that they might both be falling, but eth is gonna fall for some time in the future more than Bitcoin, correct? Is that, is that right? Right. Yeah, the, the relative strength of course, will be a read on just how they relate to one another. It won't give you a sense of what's happening in absolute terms in a market where both are going down in absolute terms. We would expect either to underperform in that environment given again, it's sort of position as your perception perhaps as being a bit riskier uh but also potentially higher reward than, than Bitcoin. So it does depend on whether they're going up or down in absolute terms, usually the way we see that ratio play out, but the long term trend is gradual and it does support Bitcoin still, even with what we've seen of late, you know, everyone's been talking about ETF S we of course, have the Ether futures ETF that folks are thinking may be approved by the end of the year if that does get approved. Do you see Ether overtaking Bitcoin and maybe um something a little bit different happening? Well, I think anything that fosters institutional demand for cryptocurrencies is probably a positive for the whole space longer term. It doesn't mean that it has a real short term impact or anything that's meaningful. And next year, for example, we did see a favorable reaction on the G BT C news recently from Bitcoin, but it was really just a blip on the chart. I think it's folks sort of anticipating that as ultimately being a positive, but I don't think it's really necessarily a near term positive. Uh but anything that does foster that institutional adoption, especially if it is lopsided towards one and not the other. Well, then that, that would probably favor that Cryptocurrency in terms of its um you know, sort of uptake, right, Katie. And finally, we need to take a look of look at this very cool animated chart that you sent to us. And I have to say you are the first guests since I've been on this show, which has been like a few months now who sent an animated chart. And I love it. It shows the 12 week Lawrence I it, it, it seems like the, the graphic was designed by someone who spent a lot of time at fish concerts. I think it's yes, perhaps a little trippy, right? But it is a great way to visualize uh sort of normalized relative performance in the Cryptocurrency market. So what we've done there is taken in the top 10 sort of market cap um oriented cryptocurrencies and and taking their ratios versus Bitcoin. So using Bitcoin as the anchor, the anchor being represented by the crosshairs in that graph and anything that's pointing up into the right is outperforming Bitcoin with stronger momentum as a kind of hook over while they're still, you know, outperforming. But doing so with less momentum as the idea. And I know you were just discussing Solana quite a bit. You see that Solana is one that still has a very favorable relative trajectory versus Bitcoin. And this is a 12 week view. So that provides an intermediate term takeaway. We can look at this kind of comparison which is called a relative rotation graph and we can look at it on a daily time frame, weekly, monthly. So you can really um sort of be fractal in how you're analyzing the time frames. And what I think is sometimes interesting from our perspective is when you can see, you know, a shift perhaps from risk on to risk off or some kind of emerging leadership on the coin front. And lastly, light coin is seeing a drop off. Why do you think that is? Oh, I, I don't know why the chart won't tell us that answer, unfortunately. Uh but, but we know that it is and, and my hope is that folks will see that and can infer what's happening there and, and listen, if it's happening before there is any uh you know, sort of obvious negative um news or influence around Bitcoin. Well, perhaps it's a heads up that these rotations are, you know, suggesting that investors are less interested in it for some reason. So it basically deserves more. Research is the way I'd see that Katie, thank you very much for joining us this morning. Of course, have a good day. That was fair strategies founder and managing partner, Katie Stockton."

        "title": "How to Buy Bitcoin? - FX Empire",
        "content": "Can I Use Regular Money to Buy Bitcoin?\n\nCash can be used to buy Bitcoin and there are a number of ways to do this. LocalBitcoins is the most popular exchange that allows Bitcoin to be purchased by cash. The Bitcoin trade can be carried out in person or by way of a cash deposit.\n\nLocalBitcoin locates a Bitcoin seller willing to accept cash and requests the prospective buyer to place the order for the number of Bitcoins wanted who then receives the account number of the seller for cash to be deposited. Once the buyer provides proof of the cash deposit, the Bitcoins are then sent to the buyer\u2019s LocalBitcoin wallet.\n\nThe alternative to depositing the cash into the seller\u2019s account would be to meet the seller face to face and give the money in person, though as always, it\u2019s important to make sure that buyers remain vigilant. Also, it\u2019s important to be aware of the fraud.\n\nBecause LocalBitcoin and similar agents ensure privacy, the price of Bitcoin is between 5-10% higher than the price on exchanges and there is a flat 1% fee for each transaction.\n\nOther companies that look to match cash buyers with Bitcoin sellers include:\n\nBitQuick, Wall of Coins, LibertyX, Bitit and then there are Bitcoin ATMs that also allow cash purchases of Bitcoins.\n\nDo note that buying and selling Bitcoins on LocalBitcoin and the other agents listed above are for smaller transactions. Buying a large number of Bitcoins is more difficult and Bitcoin ATMs will have limits that would require additional information for larger purchases.\n\nGetting a Bitcoin Wallet\n\nWhen looking to buy BTC, it is strongly recommended that the Bitcoins purchased are not stored on the exchange once purchased and that the Bitcoins are kept in a wallet created by the buyer.\n\nA wallet is essentially the same as a bank account and in very much the same way, allows the owner of the wallet to send, receive and hold Bitcoins\n\nTwo common forms of wallet used are software wallets and web / hosted wallets. Software wallets are installed on a computer or mobile, with the owner of the wallet in complete control over the security of the Bitcoins held. Hosted wallets are created on 3rd party websites and are considered much easier to create and use, the only issue is that the host would need to be trusted to ensure that adequate privacy measures are always in place.\n\nFor those looking to create a wallet, recommended sites include Coinbase and Blockchain.info.\n\nFace-to-face, or \u2018over-the-counter\u2019 (OTC) trades\n\nAs we discussed earlier, the two most common ways to buy or sell Bitcoin are either face to face with cash or on an exchange/broker.\n\nFace-to-face transactions are the small investor looking to buy and sell a small number of Bitcoins anonymously. In stark contrast is the OTC market, where particularly large amounts of Bitcoins are bought and sold, the buyers and sellers being referred to as whales within the crypto world.\n\nThe benefit of an over-the-counter trade for those looking to buy a substantial number of Bitcoins is that the entire transaction would be carried out at a negotiated price that is likely to be more favorable than an average price for Bitcoins bought through an exchange.\n\nExchanges will have significantly less liquidity and Bitcoin buyers would need to break down the total number of Bitcoins to buy through smaller lots. The issue here is that each purchase could push the price up and more so if there is a lack of liquidity, by the time the buyer purchases the final batch of Bitcoins, the price may have moved considerably. This is not only likely to be less cost-efficient, but also less time efficient.\n\nThe commonality between face to face and over-the-counter transactions is that, in both instances, a counterparty is located for the trade. The difference will be that there is unlikely to be a negotiation on price in a face to face trade, while OTC transactions will involve a negotiation on price.\n\nOTC transactions will be carried out through exchanges and broker/dealers. Dealers will generally trade using their own funds, while brokers link buyers and sellers and negotiate on price for the buyer, whilst charging a fee. Bitcoin exchange OTC trading desks are used for the more sizeable transactions that go into the millions of dollars.\n\nSuggested Articles: How to Buy Bitcoin Cash?\n\nBitcoin Exchanges\n\nIt\u2019s quite important to select the right exchange. Unlike deciding which bank account or credit card to apply for, Bitcoin and the crypto world is unregulated, making it essential to ensure that the exchange chosen is not going to put your money or your Bitcoins at risk.\n\nThe location of the exchange is the first consideration. Where the buyer lives and the laws and regulations differ by geography, so it would be recommended to buy Bitcoins on an exchange that is in the same country as the buyer.\n\nOnce the list of exchanges has been identified by geography, the next step would be to identify the most competitive and also the most widely used exchanges. Transaction fees vary across the exchanges and some may have additional fees. While looking to find an exchange with competitive fees, it is worth paying a little more to use an exchange that has a sizeable order book.\n\nExchanges that have a large number of customers will tend to make public their order book, which then shows how liquid the exchange is.\n\nOther factors to consider when deciding on the best exchange include:\n\nHow well known is the exchange? There are a number of forums on the internet where reviews are available on the exchanges and it is worth doing some due diligence.\n\nHow long it takes for Bitcoins to be received following a purchase and how quickly funds will be received in event of a sale. On this note, it would also be important to make sure that prices are locked in at the time of purchase or sale and not on the day on which the Bitcoins are received or funds are remitted.\n\nExchange security is of significant importance. For greater security, exchanges selected should be on an HTTPS site and should request secure logins to limit the possibility of being hacked.\n\nFinally, obviously knowing how you can buy and sell Bitcoins is of importance and will vary from person to person. Some exchanges will accept payments by wire transfer, credit/debit cards, PayPal and even cash.\n\nWhen considering the method of payment, exchanges may not always carry the currency of the country that the exchange is located in and it is important to gauge how competitive exchange rates and fees are across the exchanges available.\n\nBitcoin Mining\n\nWhile the majority are looking to buy and sell Bitcoin to try to make a tidy return on investment, there are those that are looking to enter the world of mining. Mining for Bitcoin is perhaps the most challenging of the mining environments within the cryptoworld, with miners needing significant computer power to be able to compete with existing miners.\n\nBitcoin mining is the validation of transactions that take place on each Bitcoin block. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin means that transactions are broadcasted to a peer-to-peer network and once broadcasted, needs to be verified, confirming that the transaction is valid and then having the transaction recorded on the public transaction database, which is known as the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nMiners basically are the people involved in the processing and verifying of transactions before then recording the transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nMiners will then receive transaction fees in the form of newly created Bitcoins.\n\nMiners compete with everyone on the peer-to-peer network to earn Bitcoins. The faster the processing power, the more attempts are made by the hardware to attempt to complete the verification, etc., earning the miner the Bitcoins that are highly sought after along with transaction fees.\n\nThe speed of processing power in Bitcoin mining is referred to as the hashrate and the processing power is referred to as the hashpower of the hardware.\n\nIn the early days, Bitcoin was mined using CPUs, but in the race to generate more income, miners shifted to Graphic Processing Units (GPUs). Then came Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) followed by Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) that are used today.\n\nFor miners, the key metric is hashing power and the more hashpower, the more money miners can make. Today\u2019s miners have warehouses of mining equipment, with Bitcoin\u2019s mining community concentrated to a small number who account for the majority of the hashpower.\n\nBecause of the concentration of hashpower, not to mention the significant cost to set up a mining network, it\u2019s recommended to join a mining pool, where miners combine computing power or to mine via cloud mining. For those looking to mine using a CPU or laptop, entering a mining pool will be of little value, since the mining income earned is proportional to the computer power contributed. A CPU or laptop just won\u2019t be offering much compared with GPUs and ASICs hardware.\n\nFor cloud mining, you won\u2019t feel the mining experience, just the income, though after fees etc., it\u2019s not going to be earth-shattering.\n\nBitcoin cloud mining does provide a medium in which to receive newly mined Bitcoins, without the need to own costly mining hardware or even have any mining know-how, allowing the mining world to not only attract the technically minded but a far wider audience, who lack the technical knowledge needed to get into Bitcoin mining.\n\nOne of the major concerns over cloud mining is fraud, however. There have been plenty of reports of fraudulent activity, not to mention lower profits and even mining companies having the ability to halt operations should Bitcoin\u2019s price fall below certain levels, so some due diligence on a mining company is recommended, with some basic steps to reduce the risk of being defrauded including:\n\nNo mining address and/or no user selectable pool.\n\nNo ASIC vendor endorsement. If there are no advertisements from the ASIC vendor, the mining company may not even own the hardware.\n\nNo photos of the hardware or data center of the mining company.\n\nNo limit imposed on sales or does not display how much hash rate sold against used in mining.\n\nReferral programs and social networking. A mining company willing to pay high referral fees should be avoided as these may well be Ponzi schemes.\n\nAnonymous operators should certainly be avoided\u2026\n\nNo ability to sell your position or get the money out upon sale.\n\nSuggested Article: How Blockchain will change our Life, Economy and the World\n\nBitcoin ATMs\n\nBitcoin ATMs are not like your traditional bank ATMs that dispense with cash from your bank account. The purpose of Bitcoin ATMs is to facilitate the purchase and sale of Bitcoins on an internet connected machine.\n\nThe ATMs allow you to insert cash to purchase Bitcoins or dispense cash in the case of a sale. Unlike the traditional bank ATMs, Bitcoin ATMs are not linked in any way to banking networks and it\u2019s also worth noting that transaction fees can be particularly high.\n\nThe world\u2019s first Bitcoin ATM was reported to have been introduced in Vancouver, Canada back in October 2013.\n\nToday, Bitcoin ATMs are located worldwide, with a reported 30 different types of Bitcoin ATMs and as Bitcoin becomes increasingly more popular. ATM providers will likely widen the net to attract the traffic that can generate transaction fees of 7%, before even considering exchange rates that are certainly considered less competitive than high street banks.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt\u2019s a whole new world for many even though Bitcoin has been in existence since 2008. The continued rise in value and talks of $100,000 have brought in a new wave of investors. With the scheduled launch of Bitcoin futures in December and the likely influx of institutional money, there will be more interest and the Bitcoin net will be widening. Whether this is a Bitcoin bubble or something more sustainable remains to be seen, after all, even the dot.com saw a mix of institutional and retail investors get burned. For now, the key to Bitcoin\u2019s growth will be dependent on the Bitcoin world\u2019s ability to educate and facilitate the buying and selling of Bitcoin.\n\nA multitude of new companies has been established that have begun fundraising through the Initial Coin Offering market, with the cryptocurrency world in a hurry to catch up with the more mature, traditional financial markets.\n\nCertain countries have already begun accepting Bitcoin as a means to buy, Japan has been one of the first movers and this is likely to continue to evolve in time.\n\nCash may be king, but knowledge is wealth. Going into Bitcoin at such levels requires both cash and knowledge, not to mention a resilience to noise and volatility. After all, this is the only asset class that has left investors ruing an early sale when faced with adversity."

Solana led the winners after Visa announced it would expand stablecoin payments to the Solana network. U.S. stock futures traded mixed after a down day Tuesday. Oil supply restrictions from Russia and Saudi Arabia have aroused inflationary concerns and fear among investors of more U.S. interest rate hikes to come.\n\nSolana surges on Visa partnership\n\nBitcoin edged up 0.01% in the last 24 hours to US$25,764.10 as of 07:10 a.m. in Hong Kong for a weekly loss of 6.72%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency has been trading between US$25,500 and US$26,000 since Saturday. It was trading at the same range in June before U.S. investment giant BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application sent the price over US$30,000\n\n\u201cThe market seems to underestimate the potential impact of U.S. BTC spot ETFs. A spot ETF approval should attract enormous inflows, creating significant buying pressure on BTC. Conversely, if the BTC spot ETFs are rejected, nothing changes,\u201d wrote crypto research firm K33 Research in a report Tuesday.\n\n\u201cPrices are now the same as before the Blackrock news that injected new life into BTC spot ETF chances. In the same time span, the Nasdaq 100, often a good indicator of the market\u2019s general risk appetite, is up 2%. The BTC spot ETFs will be huge, and with improved odds of approval, it looks evident that the market is mispricing it,\u201d the report continued.\n\nDigital asset manager Grayscale Investments sent a letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Tuesday urging the regulator to approve its application to turn the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot Bitcoin ETF. That followed a favorable court decision on August 29 for the digital asset management firm requiring the SEC to review an application it rejected last year.\n\n\u201cGBTC is ready to operate as a bitcoin ETF upon regulatory approval, and Grayscale looks forward to further constructive engagement with the SEC,\u201d said Grayscale in a Twitter thread on Tuesday.\n\n$GBTC is ready to operate as a #bitcoinETF upon regulatory approval, and Grayscale looks forward to further constructive engagement with the SEC.

Solana\u2019s SOL led the winners, rising 4.43% to US$20.22 but still posted a loss of 7.19% for the week.\n\nVisa Inc. announced on Tuesday it would expand its USDC stablecoin settlement services to the Solana blockchain.

The platform has raised over US$57 million in investment, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission made Friday.\n\nThe platform\u2019s launch follows the bankruptcies of major crypto lenders including Celsius Network, BlockFi and Genesis Global.

The Dow edged higher, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq logged losses. All three major U.S. indexes closed lower on Tuesday. The Dow led the losses with a 0.56% drop.\n\nThe main stock indexes across Asia mostly posted losses. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, and South Korea\u2019s Kospi moved lower, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei rose by 0.58%.\n\nThe benchmark Brent Crude Oil price reached a high of US$90.38 per barrel on Tuesday, the highest price since November 2022. The rise came after Saudi Arabia and Russia extended their unilateral oil supply cuts by three months to the end of the year, contributing to the declines in the Asia equity market.\n\nInvestment bank Goldman Sachs on Tuesday lowered its estimation for a U.S. economic recession in the next 12 months from 20% to 15%. The figure is much lower than a Bloomberg analyst consensus of 60%. The Goldman Sachs report cited continued positive inflation and strong labor market data as the reasons for its improved outlook.\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said in a Tuesday interview with CNBC that \u201ca hell of a good week of data\u201d for August, including a better-than-expected jobs report, points to a slowdown in inflation. But he said it is still too early to tell if the Fed is done with its monetary tightening policies.\n\n\u201cI want to be very careful about saying we\u2019ve kind of done the job on inflation until we see a couple of months continuing along this trajectory before I say we\u2019re done doing anything,\u201d Waller said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think one more hike would necessarily throw the economy into recession if we did feel that we needed to do one,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not obvious that we\u2019re in real danger of doing a lot of damage to the job market, even if we raise rates one more time.\u201d\n\nCleveland Fed President Loretta Mester was more hawkish. She said in an interview with German news outlet B\u00f6rsen-Zeitung Tuesday that the Fed \u201cmight have to go a bit higher\u201d in its policy rates to handle a still high level of demand in the economy.\n\nThe Fed will meet on Sept. 20 to make its next move on interest rates, which are currently between 5.25% and 5.50%, the highest level in 22 years.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 93% chance the Fed will maintain the current rate unchanged in September, down from 94% on Sept. 1. It also gives a 41.3% chance for another 25-basis-point rate hike in November, up from 33.5% on Sept. 1.\n\n\u201cFed officials are unlikely to move quickly toward easier policy unless growth slows more than we are forecasting in coming quarters,\u201d said Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, in a Tuesday research note viewed by Bloomberg. \u201cWe therefore expect only very gradual cuts of 25-bps per quarter starting in 2024Q2.\u201d\n\nA series of official speeches Thursday will provide further indication of the Fed\u2019s plan for rates. Elsewhere, S&P will release its U.S. services purchasing manager index (PMI) for August later Wednesday.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

The operation is highly energy intensive.\n\nHowever, during last month's record-breaking heat wave, it cut down consumption. ERCOT paid the company $31.7 million in energy credits to do so. That's roughly $22 million more than the value of the bitcoin it mined that month.\n\n\"I have been saying throughout June, July and August that every time ERCOT put out an announcement that the grid was tight, we should conserve.

This latest news has left its 600 plus members furious.\n\n\"We have a 16% poverty rate,\" Sawicky said. \"We have single moms and senior citizens right now having to decide between feeding themselves and their kids and keeping the lights on and paying their electricity bills.\"\n\nIn a statement, Riot Platforms CEO Jason Les said:\n\n\"The effects of these credits significantly lower Riot's cost to mine bitcoin and are a key element in making Riot one of the lowest cost producers of bitcoin in the industry.\"\n\nERCOT told CBS News Texas that \"companies have to qualify for these programs and follow the rules. The service is the ability to curtail.\"\n\nSawicky said they are not alright with this. \"Real solutions are transmission lines to bring solar and wind to densely populated areas. We need battery warehouses and energy efficiency and conservation.\"\n\nThe Texas Coalition Against Cryptomining said they are hosting several events next month to continue demanding action against this.\n\nCBS News Texas reached out to Riot Platforms for comment, but so far has not received a response."

        "title": "Is a Bitcoin ETF Coming? These 3 Stocks Could Benefit From It. - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "A big catalyst could soon be coming for crypto investors. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC -1.84%) could become the first exchange-traded fund that gives investors exposure to Bitcoin. This comes after a judge recently sided with Grayscale in its lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission, which blocked the company's attempt to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF.\n\nThe ETF could attract many new crypto investors and lead not only to a surge in the value of cryptocurrencies but also more trading activity. That can be great news for Block (SQ -3.02%), PayPal Holdings (PYPL 0.93%), and Coinbase Global (COIN -4.85%). Here's why they can benefit from this development.\n\n1. Block\n\nBlock is a financial services company that makes it easy for vendors to process payments through its point-of-sale terminals. Through its Cash App, the company also makes it easy for people to buy, sell, and send Bitcoin. It's such a big part of Block's business that it now generates the most revenue for the company.\n\nThrough the first half of the year, Block generated $4.6 billion in Bitcoin revenue. That's up around 30% from a year ago, when it brought in $3.5 billion from that area of its business. And this year, it has accounted for more than 43% of its top line.\n\nThe downside for Block is that it's also costly as its year-to-date expenses related to Bitcoin total just under $4.5 billion.\n\nIt may not generate huge profit growth for Block, but more transactions to process will definitely lead to more revenue growth for its business, and that could attract investors. A Bitcoin-focused ETF could be what helps give the stock a boost as Block is trading near its 52-week low.\n\nThere's some risk here as the business has incurred a loss in each of the past four quarters, but if you're bullish on crypto, Block could make for an underrated growth stock.\n\n2. PayPal\n\nAnother place where you can buy and sell crypto is through PayPal. The company allows its users to trade other cryptocurrencies as well, including Ethereum and Litecoin. Even if the new ETF would be focused on Bitcoin, all cryptocurrencies could rise in popularity as a result.\n\nThe company doesn't break out crypto revenue, but as of the end of June, it held more than $1 billion in crypto assets on its books, which is 68% higher than the $604 million it reported a year ago.\n\nOn Aug. 7, PayPal also announced the launch of a stablecoin, PayPal USD, as it looks to extend its exposure to crypto. It will be redeemable on a 1:1 basis for U.S. dollars, which could entice risk-averse crypto investors.\n\nPayPal generated a modest 7% growth last quarter when it reported sales of $7.3 billion for the period, ending June 30. More trading through its platform could help give its top line a much-needed boost. Trading near its 52-week low, PayPal could make for a good buy right now.\n\n3. Coinbase Global\n\nCoinbase operates a top cryptocurrency exchange, and it might see the most significant boost from an uptick in crypto trading. This year, it has been the hottest stock of the three listed here, achieving gains of 118% thus far (Block is down 7% while PayPal declined by 11%).\n\nThe company generates revenue from transaction fees and subscriptions. Unlike the other stocks listed here, its success is most directly related to the success and popularity of cryptocurrencies. For that reason, it's a much riskier stock to hold -- but it also has more potential upside.\n\nThe business has been struggling through the first six months of 2023, however, as revenue of just under $1.5 billion was down 25% year over year. The positive is that its net loss during that stretch was $176.3 million, a small fraction of the $1.5 billion loss Coinbase incurred over the same period last year.\n\nCoinbase is a stock that's most suitable for investors with high risk tolerance. But even if you do invest, you should tread carefully with the stock as it's a volatile investment."

        "content": "September has never been a great month for Bitcoin, and, according to analysts, this year could be worse than usual.\n\nBitcoin has only recorded positive monthly returns in September twice since 2013. Otherwise, the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency has consistently taken modest drawdowns, according to crypto data firm CoinGlass. A year ago, the coin fell 3% in September, and while it typically falls by single digits during the month, it fell as much as 19% in 2014, a year in which the coin lost half its value.\n\nThis year, some analysts are predicting a monthly decline of up to 10%, which as of Wednesday would put Bitcoin around the $23,000 range. The top crypto had been trading consistently at around $30,000 between June and mid-August before falling back to earth. Since then, barring a few spikes, it has floated between $25,000 and $26,000. That said, it\u2019s still up 55% year to date, but far from its 2021 high of more than $68,000.\n\nOn Crypto Twitter (now X), pseudonymous crypto analyst Rekt Capital said in a Tuesday tweet that they expected a decline of 7% to 10% based on historical data. Benjamin Cowen, another crypto analyst and influencer, said 10% is more likely.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s victory over the Securities and Exchange Commission last week sent Bitcoin up as much as 8%, to $28,000, but in just a few days those gains were erased.\n\nRic Edelman, the founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, said investor eagerness following the Grayscale decision was misplaced. \u201cThis was a euphoric response from those who naively believed that the ruling would instantly translate into a spot Bitcoin ETF becoming available for purchase,\u201d he told Fortune.\n\nAlthough the court vacated the SEC\u2019s decision to deny Grayscale\u2019s proposal to create a spot Bitcoin ETF, the agency isn\u2019t being forced to approve one immediately. But that could happen in October.\n\nIn the wake of the Grayscale decision, some analysts have said the odds of the SEC eventually approving a spot Bitcoin ETF have improved. Valkyrie Investments chief investment officer Steven McClurg said in a TV interview with Bloomberg News on Tuesday he thinks the odds of his firm\u2019s application being approved in October are greater than 50%. Still, the SEC has already delayed its final decision on several spot Bitcoin ETF applications, including those from Valkyrie and BlackRock, until mid-October.\n\nValkyrie CIO Steven McClurg says he believes there is \"a greater than 50% chance\" that the SEC will approve a spot-Bitcoin ETF this year https://t.co/epvKek1dXa pic.twitter.com/oJsWZy1TSe \u2014 Bloomberg (@business) September 5, 2023\n\nEdelman pointed out that the agency has several other options that don\u2019t include approving a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\n\u201cThe SEC could instead appeal the court\u2019s decision, demand that Grayscale refile its application, delay all pending spot Bitcoin ETF applications for 240 days each, or even rescind its prior approval of bitcoin futures ETFs (which would seemingly satisfy the court, which objected to the ETFs being treated differently),\u201d Edelman added via email. \u201cAny of these actions would send Bitcoiners into despair, and likely cause Bitcoin prices to fall 20% or more.\u201d\n\nStill, some analysts, including Vetle Lunde, a senior analyst at digital assets brokerage K33 Research, believe now is the time to buy. In a Tuesday note, Lunde said Bitcoin should not be trading at a three-month low, given that the last quarter brought about several positive developments\u2014BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application and Grayscale\u2019s court victory among them.\n\n\u201cThe last three months have greatly enhanced the odds of an ETF approval,\u201d Lunde wrote, \u201cyet prices are far from reflecting this.\u201d"

        "title": "Texas cryptomining outfit earns more from idling rigs than digging Bitcoin - The Register",
        "content": "Bitcoin mining outfit Riot Platforms earned $31.7 million from Texas power authorities last month for curtailing operations \u2013 far more than the value of the Bitcoin it mined in the same period.\n\nIn a press release yesterday, Riot said it produced 333 Bitcoin at its mining operations in Rockdale, Texas, which would have been worth just shy of $9 million on August 31. All the cash earned from those energy credits, on the other hand, equates to around 1,136 Bitcoin, Riot CEO Jason Les said in the company's monthly update.\n\n\"August was a landmark month for Riot in showcasing the benefits of our unique power strategy,\" Les said. \"Riot achieved a new monthly record for Power and Demand Response Credits \u2026 which surpassed the total amount of all Credits received in 2022.\n\n\"These credits significantly lower Riot's cost to mine Bitcoin and are a key element in making Riot one of the lowest cost producers of Bitcoin in the industry,\" Les said.\n\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) operates a demand response program that allows big energy consumers, like Riot, to earn power credits for using less of it for operations and selling power back to the grid, as well as additional credit for being enrolled in its demand response programs.\n\nAs we reported in August of last year, the company earned $9.5 million in credits during a July 2022 heatwave as well \u2013 still far less than it earned in Texas's hottest August on record this year.\n\nEnergy prices have been generally up, and aren't coming down, but you know what has deflated? The price of a Bitcoin. Sure, the price of 1 BTC has been up from the depths it plumbed late last year, but hovering in the mid-$20k range all year is nothing like the heady late-2021 highs of near $70k per coin.\n\nThe combination of inflated electricity costs and a drop in the value of Bitcoin means mining simply isn't as profitable as it was in 2021, the year Riot's revenue soared as demand for, and the value of, Bitcoins rose.\n\nFast forward just a year and things began looking different. Losses followed as Bitcoin prices plummeted and trade volume started to shrink \u2013 a problem that has only continued in the crypto world.\n\nAnalysts see Bitcoin miners struggling, and JPMorgan Chase said recently that the market cap of the largest Bitcoin mining firms in the US dropped by 21 percent in August. Surprise, surprise \u2013 Riot, with a 39 percent drop in market cap over the month, was the worst hit. While Riot's stock is up this year, like Bitcoin its value has dropped precipitously since 2021, when the mining firm peaked at $71.33 a share. Today it's worth just $11.10.\n\nBut if ERCOT is going to pay the market mWh rate for not mining, it can't be that bad of a business model.\n\nNeither ERCOT nor Riot responded to questions for this story. \u00ae"

        "title": "Bitcoin Miner Warns Lawmakers Of 'Chinese Takeover In Wyoming' - Cowboy State Daily",
        "content": "Chinese-connected corporations have allegedly acquired land next to Sean Murphy\u2019s bitcoin mining operation in the Campstool Business Park outside Cheyenne, which has killed an agreement his company had with the state of Wyoming.\n\nMurphy, who represents Bison Blockchain, told the Legislature\u2019s Management Audit Committee on Wednesday that a conglomerate of about eight \u201ccorporate entities\u201d run by Chinese nationals with varying levels of connections to companies in China \u2014 including the largest manufacturer of bitcoin miners in the world \u2014 have pushed his Wyoming-based company out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a diverse, complicated flow from Chinese nationals operating companies,\u201d Murphy said in warning lawmakers about the potential for Chinese companies to exploit Wyoming\u2019s business and land-use laws.\n\nHe said although some of the companies that buried Bison Blockchain are based in Wyoming, they are all connected to China.\n\n\u201cWe came to learn that they were Chinese,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a Chinese takeover in Wyoming.\u201d\n\nWhat Murphy didn\u2019t tell the committee is that his business had a prior relationship with at least some of these companies.\n\nIn May, Bison Blockchain filed a $22 million lawsuit in Wyoming federal court against five companies based in either Delaware or the Cayman Islands related to its bitcoin mines in Cheyenne. The lawsuit accuses the companies of breach of contract, covenants of good faith and fair dealing, enterprise liability and intentional interference with contractual relations.\n\nWhat Are They Doing?\n\nBlockchain mining is the process of adding transaction records to the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIn June 2022, Black Hills Energy entered into a five-year service agreement with Bison Blockchain involving up to 45 megawatts of power, with an option to expand to as much as 75 megawatts at the North Range Business Park in Cheyenne.\n\nBlack Hills said at the time that the facility \"will represent one of the largest bitcoin mining operations in the region,\" according to a press release from the utility.\n\n\u201cWe were the largest bitcoin miners in the state until we weren't,\u201d Murphy told the committee.\n\nIn October 2022, Bison Blockchain broke ground on the future site of its MineOne Data Center at North Range. It is now suing MineOne as one of the parties in the lawsuit.\n\nHow It Works\n\nPower is an incredibly important valuable asset in bitcoin mining and the data centers that typically house these operations, as they need a significant amount of electricity to run their operations.\n\nBison Blockchain leased state land next to a large Black Hills Energy substation to run its operations off 30-45 megawatts of power. To put that number in perspective, Murphy said the entire city of Cheyenne runs on about 100-120 megawatts.\n\nTheir business model was to generate revenue for the state on a per-miner basis, the process of creating valid blocks that add transaction records to Bitcoin's public ledger. For each Bitcoin miner, the company would pay the state $1 per month.\n\nBison Blockchain was paying the state $5,000 a year on its 10-year lease.\n\nMurphy said a large mine like Bison could result in 10,000-15,000 bitcoin miners, representing as much as $1 million to $2 million revenue for the state over the course of its 10-year lease.\n\n\u201cThe more bitcoin that we mined, the more money the state made,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a great win-win-win.\u201d\n\nMurphy said the other companies acquired private land next to the Black Hills substation and have since taken over Bison Blockchain\u2019s service agreement with Black Hills. Now, Murphy said the companies will be using Black Hills power to mine their own bitcoin, all of the proceeds of which he believes will eventually go to China.\n\n\u201cWhat we trying to do was generate more revenue for the state on this state land, but that\u2019s been wiped out,\u201d he said.\n\nMurphy said Bison Blockchain will continue to honor its lease agreement with the state and will compete with the new competition.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to compete with the Chinese,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to roll over.\u201d\n\nBut he implored the committee to help shore up state regulations, saying the situation is \u201cnot good\u201d and needs to be addressed.\n\nDuring the 2023 legislative session, two bills were drafted that prohibited Chinese ownership of land in Wyoming. Both died before making significant traction.\n\nHow Committed?\n\nState Sen. Tara Nethercott, R-Cheyenne, questioned Murphy if he would commit to not selling his company out to a high bidder some day, which could be a company connected to China.\n\nMurphy didn\u2019t deny that his company is in business to make money and that they wouldn\u2019t pass up an ideal situation to sell someday. But he also said his company has \u201clearned our lesson\u201d from working with Chinese companies.\n\nHe said Bison\u2019s original 10-year lease agreement with the state could have led to more revenue through additional state land leases in the future, where even bitcoin could have gone to the state\u2019s coffers.\n\n\u201cThat is an asset I believe the state should look at acquiring,\u201d he said.\n\nCurrently, Murphy said, the U.S. government only takes in bitcoin by seizure.\n\nLeo Wolfson can be reached at Leo@CowboyStateDaily.com."

        "title": "Bitcoin Up 365999% Since Krugman Dismissed It at $7 - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Twelve years ago, economist and Nobel laureate Paul Krugman first addressed Bitcoin and his opinion was skeptical to say the least.\n\n\n\nIn that now-famous article, penned for The New York Times on September 7, 2011, Krugman criticized and dismissed the cryptocurrency, which was then trading at an average of $7.03 per Bitcoin across exchanges.\n\nFast forward to today, and Bitcoin's remarkable journey has proven Krugman's skepticism to be one of the most costly missed opportunities in financial history, as demonstrated by the reaction to an X post today by Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo.\n\nWhen Krugman's article was published, Bitcoin was still in its infancy. The digital money, created by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, had only been around for a couple of years. It was largely unknown to the mainstream, with a small but passionate community of early adopters and tech enthusiasts.\n\nIn his article, Krugman argued that Bitcoin was a bubble waiting to burst. He questioned its viability as a currency, criticized its decentralized nature, and expressed skepticism about its long-term prospects.\n\nAt the time, Bitcoin's price of $7.00 seemed trivial, and many shared Krugman's doubts.\n\nHowever, history has proven Krugman and other early Bitcoin skeptics wrong. Bitcoin has not only survived but thrived over the past 12 years. Its price has experienced unprecedented growth, reaching highs of over $69,000 in early 2021.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $25,000 per coin, representing a staggering 365,999% increase from its price when Krugman penned his critique.\n\nStill, it's worth noting that Krugman acknowledged at the time that Bitcoin had been a good investment, even while he questioned it could serve as a currency, writing:\n\n\n\n\"The dollar value of that cybercurrency has fluctuated sharply, but overall it has soared. So buying into Bitcoin has, at least so far, been a good investment. But does that make the experiment a success? Um, no. What we want from a monetary system isn\u2019t to make people holding money rich; we want it to facilitate transactions and make the economy as a whole rich. And that\u2019s not at all what is happening in Bitcoin.\"\n\nIn addition, he criticized Bitcoin for being deflationary, adding that there is an \"incentive to hoard the virtual currency rather than spend it.\"\n\nBut while this has proved largely true, Krugman's claims have been undermined by Bitcoin's continued utility as a currency, BTC's rise to $25,000 demonstrating its potential as a means of transferring value across borders with relative ease.\n\nBitcoin has even been adopted as a currency in El Salvador, where it serves alongside the U.S. dollar as a form of legal tender, in wide use by small merchants. Further, Bitcoin, 15 years on, retains a niche in online commerce.\n\nAll this in mind, in retrospect, Krugman's dismissal of Bitcoin at $7 serves as a reminder of the unpredictability of financial markets and the potential for revolutionary technologies to reshape the world.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "The Bitcoin Verdict: A Conversation With Evertas Founder J. Gdanski About Cryptocurrency and Web 3 Insurance - Brown Rudnick",
        "content": "In this episode of \u201cThe Bitcoin Verdict,\u201d host and partner Hailey Lennon is joined by J. Gdanski, CEO and founder of cryptocurrency insurance company Evertas, to discuss how his company navigates an industry that doesn\u2019t fit into traditional insurance coverage and policies. Evertas is a client of Brown Rudnick.\n\nOne of the bigger challenges in providing insurance in the crypto space is complexities in calculating and covering risk, according to Gdanski.\n\n\u201cWhat is unique about what we\u2019re doing, which is different than what was done with cyber, is we actually have deep technical experts from the field and the industry that we\u2019re trying to insure, and we started with the kind of bottom-up risk management and risk assessment framework, and from there, it came to pricing its products,\u201d Gdanski said. \u201cWhat was done with cyber was just this sort of top-down thing; it was designed by insurance people who were not experts in anything except for insurance.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2017, Evertas is a crypto insurance company that develops regulated insurance and risk mitigation solutions for crypto assets. The Chicago-based company focuses on covering institutional holders of crypto assets including exchanges, custodians, traditional financial institutions, funds, family offices, and high-net-worth individuals.\n\nBefore starting Evertas, Gdanski was a leader in the enterprise blockchain space and was one of the first to work on institutional custody for crypto. He also served as an early contributor to blockchain consortia, including Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, of which he was a founding member.\n\nAs the need for crypto insurance develops, government agencies and regulators are starting to have an interest in people having coverage to protect themselves, Gdanski said.\n\n\u201cIt used to be \u2018have insurance, just show them a piece of paper that says insurance with your company\u2019s name on it or not,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s changed, shockingly. Sooner than I thought, actually. So people with money transmitter licenses, they would have these Fidelity insurance policies, they were relatively inexpensive, and I thought it would be sometime this year or next, but they started last year.\u201d\n\nHe said companies that are dealing in cryptocurrency and fiat started getting questions last year from regulators and the government about why their policies only covered the fiat transfers, not crypto.\n\nAnd now, those companies are being required to have crypto insurance, as well, which led to a number of panicked phone calls from people who couldn\u2019t operate their business until they got a new insurance policy, Gdanski said.\n\n\u201cI think certainly, when you look at Hong Kong, for years Hong Kong authorities had very stringent insurance requirements,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are likely to be some coming out of the EU, they\u2019re already in the UAE. And it\u2019s not just that you have a piece of paper that has your name on it that says insurance, but that the insurance is actually covering the right risk.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin price can hit $46K by 2024 halving \u2014 Interview with Filbfilb - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has a chance to end 2023 at $35,000 despite heading lower in between, veteran analyst Filbfilb believes.\n\nIn his latest interview with Cointelegraph, the co-founder of trading suite DecenTrader reveals some BTC price targets that should resonate with the long-term holder base.\n\nBitcoin faces multiple obstacles to its current uptrend, and the current cycle offers various key differences from those that came before it. It is not just the Bitcoin spot price exchange-traded fund (ETF) debacle; the entire macroeconomic environment looks markedly different from just a few years ago.\n\nFilbfilb predicts that the April 2024 block subsidy halving will nonetheless have a cathartic effect on BTC price performance. BTC/USD could even trade as high as $46,000 by that time, but losses are \u201clikely\u201d to come next.\n\nFilbfilb eyes \u201clikely\u201d BTC price dip to low $20,000 range\n\nCointelegraph (CT): On short timeframes, you recently predicted another BTC price dip to \u201ccrush the remaining hopium.\u201d Where do you see the long-term floor?\n\nFilbfilb (FF): This depends on circumstances; as we saw during the COVID-19 crash in March 2020, the floor was slightly north of $3,000, so I would expect the lows of around $16,000 seen following the FTX crash to be maintained. However, avoiding a black swan event, somewhere in the low $20,000s seems likely.\n\nCT: Do you still expect a reversal in price behavior in Q4 as miners and smart money \u201cbuy the rumor\u201d on the halving?\n\nFF: Based on the previous cycles, we have seen a contraction of new emitted supply to market in advance of the halving. Coupled by increased speculative demand, this dynamic is likely to repeat in my opinion.\n\nCT: Speaking of miners, what\u2019s your stance on price versus hash rate, considering how the latter continues to see new highs?\n\nFF: I\u2019ve not been able to attribute a direct correlation between hash rate and price.\n\nCT: What\u2019s surprised you about BTC price action this year compared to other pre-halving years?\n\nFF: There has been a failure to break the 100-week moving average thus far, which is a notable difference. In the past, this has confirmed the bull market to some extent. Timing-wise, the uptick from the 2022 lows is in line with what we have seen previously.\n\nCT: A lot has been made about the outcome of the Grayscale vs. SEC lawsuit last week. How significant do you think the news really is? Do you see a U.S. Bitcoin spot ETF approval on the horizon?\n\nFF: The SEC seemingly has a policy of \u201cdelay at all costs,\u201d which has now included unreasonable rejection. If you look at how the room is behaving \u2014 i.e., BlackRock et al. putting in a number of filings for ETFs \u2014 it would seem highly unlikely that the biggest institutional asset managers will have done little due diligence and would anticipate failure. In my humble opinion, it is a matter of \u201cwhen\u201d it will be approved rather than \u201cif.\u201d\n\nCT: You\u2019ve called U.S. inflation the \u201celephant in the room\u201d this cycle \u2014 how might this impact Bitcoin post-halving next year?\n\nFF: The longer inflation and rates remain high, the less disposable income retail has to invest. Additionally, the cost of capital has generally increased due to the risk-free rate of return being higher; this means asset allocation toward riskier assets becomes less attractive. The longer this remains the status quo, the less capital will seek investments such as Bitcoin.\n\nCT: What are your preferred noise-free metrics for tracking BTC\u2019s price?\n\nFF: On a high level, directional price momentum, coupled with market positioning (such as long/short ratios, funding rates and open interest), underpins what I am looking at in the market overall when determining shorter-term moves.\n\nCT: What\u2019s your BTC price target for the end of the year and at the 2024 halving?\n\nFF: Assuming no black swan event, around $35,000 by the end of the year and possibly as high as $46,000 some time pre-halving in Q1 2024.\n\nDOGE, XRP stand out among altcoins\n\nCT: Bitcoin aside, are you surprised by the NFT market collapse? Does it have a future?\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price metric copies move that last came before -25% FTX crash\n\nFF: I am unsurprised about the NFT collapse. I do think there is some utility in some forms of NFTs, such as for ticketing and music applications; however, massively overpriced works of \u201cart\u201d was never something I could understand.\n\nCT: Are there any altcoins in particular that you think can moon particularly hard in the new cycle?\n\nFF: At the moment, I am mostly focused on Bitcoin; altcoins tend to make their move after the halving. However, I would expect XRP (XRP) to do quite well next cycle due to its legal case with the SEC and effectively playing catch-up in market share. I\u2019d also not rule out Dogecoin (DOGE) doing well once again, particularly if Elon Musk integrates crypto into X.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Bitcoin short-term holders capitulate as data highlights potential generational buying opportunity - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price action suggests that the asset remains in a precarious position, and a recent report from ARK Invest says that short-term Bitcoin investors had no choice but to capitulate in August, as the percentage of Bitcoin supply in profit fell by 14 percentage points.\n\nBitcoin market sentiment and monthly valuation change in August. Source: ARK Invest\n\nAlthough many traders view significant price dips as buying opportunities, at this point in the Bitcoin (BTC) halving cycle, a notable bearish move was Bitcoin\u2019s price falling below its 200-week moving average (MA) for the first time since June 2023.\n\nAs shown in the chart below, the 200-week MA generally acts as a key support level during major downtrends, and ARK suggests that any future bearish catalysts could see the BTC price fall as low as $20,300, where its realized price currently resides.\n\nBitcoin 200-week moving average and realized price. Source: ARK Invest\n\nDespite the rather dismal short-term outlook for the crypto market, a more optimistic view of Bitcoin\u2019s dip below the 200-week MA would highlight the fact that dips below the realized price and the long-term moving averages presented cyclical buying opportunities. Investors who accumulated when the price dipped below both metrics in 2019, 2020 and early 2022 found themselves in deep profit within the next six months.\n\nAnalyst Ben Lilly recently alluded to a similar occurrence within the Bitcoin dominance metric, suggesting that \u201cBitcoin\u2019s about to take the driver\u2019s seat again.\u201d\n\nBitcoin market cap dominance. Source: TradingView\n\nAccording to Lilly:\n\n\u201cIn terms of price action, right now I see a lot of similarities to what took place in 2019. And it has me anticipating a trend to unfold regarding Bitcoin over the next few weeks and possibly months. It has to do with Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D), a measure of Bitcoin\u2019s market share of crypto based on its market cap. In the chart below, we can see that that rally in 2019 started back in 2018, when we got a nice double bottom (red box), followed by a solid run up until Q1 2019. Then, we trended down for a few months (first red arrow) before getting the massive reversal on April Fools\u2019 Day (first green arrow).\u201d\n\nComparing market participant sentiment from 2018-2019 to the current market sentiment, Lilly suggested that today\u2019s price action reminds him of the pre-reversal period in 2019 when \u201cwe were in a winter, everybody was low energy, nobody cared about bitcoin or crypto.\u201d\n\nStablecoin market cap data also reflects the absence of bullish investor sentiment, and according to ARK, the fact that \u201cthe 90-day supply of aggregate stablecoins has dropped more than 20% from $162 billion in March 2022 to $120 billion today\u201d is illustrative of the decline in market liquidity and investors\u2019 confidence in engaging with Bitcoin and altcoins.\n\nStablecoin aggregate market cap 90-day percentage change. Source: ARK Invest\n\nObviously, the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are on nearly every retail and institutional investor\u2019s mind, and until one is approved or the narrative of the upcoming Bitcoin halving takes precedence over the \u201cETF approval triggering a bull market narrative,\u201d the market dynamics described above are likely to persist.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "When you hear the word mining, your first thought probably goes to miners wearing dirty overalls and helmets with flashlights on them carrying pickaxes and shovels into dark tunnels in a quest to strike gold.\n\nBut there\u2019s a new \u201cgold rush\u201d happening that replaces pickaxes and shovels with powerful computers and advanced software programs. And instead of mining for gold nuggets, this new crop of miners is trying to unearth a new kind of commodity that you can\u2019t see or touch: Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin mining has captured the imagination of thousands of folks with dreams of making a fortune overnight, very much like the wave of travelers flocking to California in the 1800s to dig up gold. It\u2019s a frenzy that has gone from a few folks with computers in their basements to warehouses filled with computers as far as the eye can see in an attempt to mine for bitcoins\u2014the most popular and widely accepted form of cryptocurrency in the market today.\n\nBut how do you \u201cmine\u201d for something that only exists in the digital realm? Here\u2019s what bitcoin mining is, how it works, and whether or not it\u2019s worth your time (and money).\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin Mining?\n\nBitcoin mining is the process of creating new bitcoins by solving complex math problems meant to confirm that transactions made with bitcoins are legit. Don\u2019t worry: You don\u2019t have to do any actual math yourself with a calculator or anything like that\u2014your computer does all the work for you.\n\nBitcoin mining basically does two things. First, it releases new bitcoins into the market (and it is the only way that new bitcoins are created). And second, bitcoin mining helps make the Bitcoin payment network more trustworthy, with thousands of computers working to validate transactions made with bitcoins to prevent fraud and double spending. (We know\u2014this is a lot to digest. Keep reading, this will make more sense in a second!)\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Mining Work?\n\nLet\u2019s back up for a second. Before we can really dive into bitcoin mining, we need to cover some Bitcoin basics first. It\u2019s a completely digital currency, which means there are no actual paper bills or metal coins involved. Instead, everything is done over the internet and bitcoins are worth whatever people are willing to pay for them.\n\nOne of the biggest fears surrounding digital currencies like Bitcoin is that someone can hypothetically \u201ccopy\u201d a bitcoin and send it to someone else while still holding onto the original bitcoin. This is called double spending, and it\u2019s something you have to worry about with any virtual currency.\n\nHow does a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, which isn\u2019t regulated by or tied to any government, fight against the risks of cybercrime and fraud to create a safe and secure network? That\u2019s where bitcoin mining comes in.\n\nYou see, Bitcoin is powered by something called blockchain technology. A blockchain is basically a digital record of transactions that is copied and passed around across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. This makes it extremely difficult to change, hack, or cheat the system\u2014because everyone in the network has access to the ledger and can see if something doesn\u2019t match up.\n\nJust think of the blockchain as a really, really big book. This book contains every transaction ever made with bitcoins, and each page in that book represents a \u201cblock\u201d of transactions made with bitcoin.\n\nMarket chaos, inflation, your future\u2014work with a pro to navigate this stuff.\n\nBitcoin mining is just a way to make sure that the transactions on a new page are legitimate. If they are, that page is added to the book. So if you think about it, bitcoin mining is really bitcoin transaction verification (but that sounds even less fun than mining\u2014which doesn\u2019t really sound fun at all).\n\nBitcoin miners add blocks of the transactions to the blockchain by using specialized computers to solve math puzzles that help confirm whether or not a block of transactions is valid. These computers perform millions of calculations at lightning speed to try and quickly solve those math puzzles through a process of trial and error. It\u2019s basically a race between your computer and thousands of other bitcoin mining computers around the world to solve the puzzle first.\n\nWhen a block gets added to the chain and the new bitcoins are rewarded to the miner who solved the puzzle first, the process then starts again.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Reward for Successfully Mining Bitcoins?\n\nIf you\u2019re the first to solve the puzzle, congratulations! For successfully adding a new block of transactions to the blockchain, you get rewarded with some newly created bitcoins\u2014also known as a block reward. If you successfully mined bitcoin today, you would receive 6.25 bitcoins as your block reward.\n\n(Side note: The reward for successfully mining bitcoin gets cut in half after 210,000 blocks are added to the blockchain, or roughly every four years. In 2024, the reward for mining bitcoin will be chopped down to 3.125 bitcoins.)\n\nBut there\u2019s a limit to how many bitcoins can exist. There\u2019s a maximum of 21 million bitcoins that will ever exist. Right now, there are about 19 million bitcoins in existence\u2014meaning there are roughly 2 million bitcoins left to be mined.\n\nOnce that 21 million mark is reached, no more bitcoins can be created . . . which means bitcoin miners will rely on transaction fees instead of block rewards for profits. But experts say the last bitcoin probably won\u2019t be mined until the year 2140 . . . so there\u2019s plenty of time to figure out what comes next.1\n\nWhy Bitcoin Mining Isn\u2019t Worth It\n\nThe price of Bitcoin reached all-time highs in 2021, almost hitting $69,000 per bitcoin in early November.2 So if someone successfully adds a block of transactions to the blockchain and gets 6.25 bitcoins as a reward at around that price, those bitcoins would be worth almost $431,000!\n\nSounds great, right? But the bad news is that bitcoin is so expensive, complex and time-consuming that you\u2019re better off staying away from it altogether. Here\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t quit your day job to become a bitcoin miner.\n\nBitcoin prices are very unpredictable.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin is more up and down than the Tower of Terror at Disney World\u2014with the price rising and falling by thousands of dollars in a matter of days. Just how volatile is Bitcoin?\n\nIn October 2021, Bitcoin made headlines by crossing the $66,000 per coin threshold.3 Bitcoin owners were feeling pretty good at that point! Fast forward to one week later, and the price tumbled back down to under $58,500 per bitcoin, an 11% drop.4 That means in seven days the value of Bitcoin lost $7,000 in value. And that\u2019s just a typical week in the life of a Bitcoin owner.\n\nAll this means one simple thing: You never really know what your bitcoins will be worth if you ever wind up successfully mining for them (and that is a very big if). And then there\u2019s the risk of everyone waking up one morning and suddenly agreeing that Bitcoin is worth as much as Monopoly money . . . if that happens, that\u2019s the ballgame\u2014and you\u2019ll be left with nothing for all your efforts. Do not pass \u201cGo\u201d and do not collect $200.\n\n1. The competition for bitcoin mining is fierce.\n\nAs time goes on, it\u2019s going to get more and more difficult to successfully mine for Bitcoin (and the reward for successfully mining Bitcoin will become smaller and smaller). That\u2019s because there will be more miners getting in on the hunt to compete for the next block reward.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s harder to mine for bitcoin today than it has ever been\u2014with mining difficulty reaching an all-time high of 25 trillion back in May 2021.5 Translation? That means it is insanely more difficult than ever to successfully mine for bitcoins because there are more and more miners trying to get in on the action and it will take a ton of computing power just to keep up with them.\n\nYou\u2019ll be going up against firms that have built warehouses filled with thousands of computers that are mining for Bitcoin all day, every day. If you\u2019re trying to compete with them with a single mining computer in your basement, good luck with that! You probably have a better chance of winning the lottery and then getting hit by lightning on the way to pick up your prize than successfully mining bitcoins.\n\n2. Bitcoin mining is very expensive, complex and time-consuming.\n\nThat\u2019s mostly by design. You need a specific kind of computer hardware that is known as \u201capplication-specific integrated circuits\u201d (or ASICs) and those puppies can cost anywhere from $2,000 to $14,000 each\u2014maybe more.6\n\nThese computers also require massive amounts of energy to operate (upsetting many environmentalists in the process), which can rack up your electric bill and cut your profits. Fun fact, if Bitcoin was a country made up of bitcoin miners, it would consume more electricity than Argentina (yes, the country) as a whole!7\n\nThe Proven Way to Building Wealth\n\nBuilding wealth is a marathon\u2014not a sprint. And bitcoin mining is just the latest in the long line of get-rich-quick schemes that will more than likely leave you broke and broken.\n\nMost millionaires in America today didn\u2019t build their seven-figure net worth by rolling the dice on risky investments they didn\u2019t understand or pouring money into a long shot. Here are three things they did do:\n\nDave Ramsey\u2019s new book, Baby Steps Millionaires: How Ordinary People Built Extraordinary Wealth\u2014and How You Can Too, will show you the proven path that millions of Americans have taken to become millionaires\u2014and how you can become one too!\n\nTalk With a Financial Advisor\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to get started on the path to building wealth the right way, get in touch with one of our SmartVestor Pros.

Bitcoin and Ether were little changed, even as Bitcoin whales have been steadily accumulating the asset since Aug. 25, market experts told Forkast.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Grayscale\u2019s favorable court verdict, ETF hype fail to lift Bitcoin above US$28,000\n\nSolana leads winners, Bitcoin whales continue buying\n\nSolana\u2019s SOL token was the day\u2019s biggest gainer in the top 10 cryptocurrencies, rising 2.38% in the past 24 hours to US$19.81. SOL started gaining yesterday after the protocol announced a partnership with Visa. The payments giant will be using the Solana blockchain as a settlement layer in its pilot program for enterprise-grade throughput at \u201cvirtually no cost\u201d for Visa issuers and merchants.\n\nAdding to the blockchain\u2019s utility, Visa also announced that two additional merchants, Worldpay Global and Nuvei, will be piloting USDC settlement payments on Solana.\n\nIn the wider crypto market, Bitcoin was little changed during afternoon trading in Asia, trading at US$25,735 as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong.\n\nDespite Bitcoin\u2019s sluggish price action, large holders, also known as \u2018whales\u2019, have been steadily accumulating Bitcoin since Aug. 25, according to Mike Ermolaev, founder of blockchain PR firm Outset PR and the author of the interview series \u2018Crypto Opinion with Mike Ermolaev.\u2019\n\n\u201cInstitutional investors who have deep pockets and the ability to hold Bitcoin long-term are key to supporting Bitcoin\u2019s growth. Positive regulatory developments coupled with the upcoming halving event of Bitcoin in 2024 have the potential to lead to a strong price increase for Bitcoin,\u201d wrote Ermolaev, referencing the below chart.\n\nmr5E5lnTO1U6PcgM8UTe4mNOyDPK eq9IWgD36rXgwLaYuefWql2yagbz5K 8525eYpqxJBZM2z4LCmuKTwd79QkI571pQSKHwuLvADg6ODPSUdxlZ AanNwf0cGs7H6k7 NJrWsZlwoPl09Xib8NAY\n\nAs for the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, Ether slipped 0.12% during afternoon trading in Asia to US$1,629 and declined 5.06% during the past week.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours rose 0.15% to US$1.04 trillion while market volume increased 0.04% to US$24.14 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nStory continues\n\nMutant Ape Yacht Club sales rise over 200%\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.26% to 2,176.81 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong but fell 0.78% during the week.\n\nFollowing yesterday\u2019s 400% sales surge for the Bored Ape Yacht Club, 24-hour sales for it\u2019s twin collection, the Mutant Ape Yacht Club, rose 213% to US$762,915, making it the third-largest NFT collection across all blockchains by 24-hour sales volume.\n\nBoosted by the collection, Ethereum\u2019s 24-hour non-fungible token (NFT) sales rose 32.74% to US$6.62 million. Sales for Milady Maker strengthened 596% to US$287,012.\n\nMythos Chain remained the second largest blockchain by 24-hour sales volume, despite sales falling 6% in the past 24 hours to US$1.15 million. Sales for the DMarket collection fell 6.38% to US$1.13 million, remaining the second-largest NFT collection by daily sales volume.\n\nIn the wider NFT space, tokenized real estate platform Roofstock OnChain successfully completed its third property sales through its NFT marketplace, with a property in South Carolina sold for US$204,000 worth of USDC, marking another milestone for tokenized assets.\n\nAsian equities rise despite yuan falling to 10-month low, U.S. equities fall after Cleveland Fed chief hints at more rate hikes\n\nImage: elements.envato\n\nMost major Asian equities \u2013 Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index, the Shanghai Composite and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 \u2013 rose as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, except the Shenzhen Component.\n\nChina\u2019s yuan fell to a 10-month low against the U.S. dollar, before the People\u2019s Bank of China stepped in, offering support for the yuan to prevent a further price fall. Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that major state-owned banks were actively selling U.S. dollars onshore in early trading, while mopping up yuan liquidity, to slow the yuan\u2019s decline.\n\nMajor U.S. stock futures \u2013 Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures \u2013 fell on Wednesday.\n\nThe declines followed hawkish comments from Fed Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester, who said that the central bank may need to raise rates \u201ca bit higher,\u201d but did not mention what officials should do at the next interest rate meeting that is scheduled for Sept. 19-20.\n\nOver in Europe, the benchmark STOXX 600 fell 0.63% while Frankfurt\u2019s DAX 40 fell 0.34%, following hawkish remarks from European Central Bank official Klaas Knot, who cautioned that traders betting against an interest rate increase next week might be underestimating its likelihood. Klaas also emphasized that achieving the central bank\u2019s 2% inflation target by the end of 2025 should be the minimum commitment for policymakers.\n\nAdding to investor concerns, German industrial orders fell 11.7% in July, surpassing the expected 4.3% decline, according to the federal statistics office. This marks the steepest drop since the aftermath of the Covid-19 outbreak in April 2020.\n\nSee related article: Grayscale wins against SEC as India moves on blockchain; Friend.tech loses friends"

        "title": "Institutions May Be Forced To Fight Over Just 5% of Bitcoin Supply, According to InvestAnswers - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "A widely followed analyst says a key Bitcoin (BTC) metric is looking strong despite the crypto market downturn.\n\nCiting an infographic from blockchain analytics firm Glassnode stating that 95% of the existing supply of Bitcoin has not moved over the past 30 days, the anonymous host of InvestAnswers tells his 447,000 YouTube subscribers that all the flagship crypto asset needs to rally is a buy-side catalyst.\n\n\u201cBreaking news: 95% of all Bitcoin has not moved in the last 30 days. So again, despite the weak market, only 5% is moving around \u2013 95% is sitting tight. And we know why\u2026\n\nBut the real magic of this, imagine there\u2019s a catalyst and imagine big money wants to jump in and buy a truckload of Bitcoin? Price will just go parabolic. And that\u2019s just economics, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nThat is kind of why I\u2019m so obsessed with Bitcoin. It\u2019s so scarce, so literally when the big institutions come, and they\u2019re fighting over that 5% and all the legacy holders are just sitting there watching. Anyway, it\u2019s a reason to be excited.\u201d\n\nThe anonymous host of InvestAnswers further says that the remaining supply of Bitcoin after accounting for long-term holders and the lost Bitcoin is also a bullish indicator.\n\n\u201cThe amount of Bitcoin that is either hodled or lost, or basically has not moved in the last five years, is nearly eight million Bitcoin. That means technically only 11 million, or thereabouts, have not.\n\nAnd in fact taking this five-year plus it doesn\u2019t include all the Bitcoin lost over the last five years or less. So we know it\u2019s just super scarce. It\u2019s mind-boggling how scarce it is.\n\nAnd I always get the question, \u2018well, if it\u2019s so scarce is that not bad?\u2019. No, it\u2019s not. It means the price of what\u2019s left will go up. And it won\u2019t take a lot to move it as well.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "It's been a whipsaw 2023 for investor sentiment, and even though equities markets have defied expectations, a recent report from ARK Invest highlights reasons why the remainder of 2023 could present several economic challenges.\n\nARK manages $13.9 billion in assets, and its CEO, Cathie Wood, is a strong advocate for cryptocurrencies. In partnership with the European asset manager 21Shares, ARK Investment first applied for a Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in June 2021. Its most recent request for a spot BTC ETF, which is currently pending review by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, was initially filed in May 2023.\n\nLong-term bullish, short-term bearish?\n\nDespite ARK\u2019s bullish view on Bitcoin, which is supported by its research on how the fusion of Bitcoin and artificial intelligence could transform corporate operations by positively impacting productivity and costs, the investment firm doesn\u2019t foresee a straightforward path for a Bitcoin bull run given the current macroeconomic conditions.\n\nIn the newsletter, ARK cites several reasons for its less-than-optimistic scenario for cryptocurrencies, including interest rates, gross domestic product (GDP) estimates, unemployment and inflation. One point is that the Federal Reserve is implementing a restrictive monetary policy for the first time since 2009, as indicated by the natural rate of interest.\n\nFederal Reserve natural rate of interest. Source: ARK Investment\n\nThe \"natural rate of interest\u201d is a theoretical rate at which the economy neither expands nor contracts. ARK explains that whenever this indicator exceeds the real federal funds policy rate, it puts pressure on lending and borrowing rates.\n\nARK anticipates that inflation will continue to slow down, which would drive up the real federal funds policy rate and increase the gap above the natural rate of interest. Essentially, the report holds a bearish macroeconomic view due to this indicator.\n\nThe analysts also focused on the divergence between real GDP (production) and GDI (income). According to the report, GDP and GDI should closely align, as income earned should equal the value of goods and services produced.\n\nHowever, the most recent data shows that real GDP is approximately 3% higher than real GDI, indicating that downward revisions in production data should be expected.\n\nAnother focal point was U.S. employment data, and the analysts note that the government has revised these figures downward for six consecutive months.\n\nU.S. nonfarm payroll revisions. Source: ARK Investment\n\nThe chart above highlights a labor market that appears weaker than initial reports indicated. The fact that the last time six consecutive months of downward revisions occurred was in 2007, just before the onset of the Great Financial Crisis, is also notable.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin short-term holders capitulate as data highlights potential generational buying opportunity\n\n\u201cStagflation\u201d is usually bearish for risk-on assets\n\nAnother bearish development to keep an eye on is \u201cstagflation.\u201d The writers highlight the reversal of the yearlong trend of price discounts driven by increased consumer spending. Referencing the Johnson Redbook Index, which encompasses over 80% of the \u201cofficial\" retail sales data compiled by the U.S. Department of Commerce, it becomes clear that total same-store sales rebounded in August for the first time in 12 months, suggesting that inflation may be exerting upward pressure.\n\nJohnson Redbook retail sales index. Source: ARK Investment\n\nThe metrics suggest that ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty could continue in the coming months. However, it does not provide a clear answer regarding how cryptocurrency investors might react if this trend confirms lower economic growth and higher inflation \u2014 a scenario typically considered highly unfavorable for risk-on assets.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin and ether. We\u2019ve also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this article began. According to Wikipedia, a cryptocurrency is \u201ca digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.\u201d\n\nBitcoin was the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Ether is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three with its launch in July 2015. XRP, which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We\u2019ve included it here for reference.\n\nThe third-largest market share of cryptocurrency, tether, is a token \u201cbacked by actual assets\u201d which includes one US dollar, one euro, or loans to affiliate companies and is controlled by the owners of Bitfinex. It\u2019s a controversial cryptocurrency due to its alleged manipulation of crypto pricing. It is called a \u201cstable coin\u201d because it was designed to always be worth $1.00. We do not chart it because its price rarely changes.\n\nFor a better understanding of crypto market cycles, read more here.\n\nThe Latest Crypto Data (through September 5, 2023)\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price surged last week following the Grayscale ruling, but the initial excitement has quickly died down as Bitcoin\u2019s price has since dropped over 5% from last week. Nevertheless, BTC is now up ~55% year to date.\n\nRead more about the Court of Appeals ruling here.\n\nAfter a brief uptick last week, XRP\u2019s price resumed its general decline that had begun in early July. XRP is currently up ~47% year to date.\n\nEther\u2019s price hike from last week was also short lived as the price swiftly declined, hitting its lowest point in nearly six months. ETH is currently up ~36% year-to-date.\n\nAn index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. Ether tops the chart, i.e., the price of an ether has changed the most out of all three cryptocurrencies.\n\nETFs associated with cryptocurrencies include: ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) and ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITI).\n\nOriginally published on Advisor Perspectives.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel."

According to the press release, the company increased its U.S. operational hash rate by 2% month-over-month to 19.1 exahashes in August, and it increased its installed hash rate by 1% month-over-month to 23.1 exahashes. The rise occurred due to the upgrade of Bitmain Antminer S19j Pro miners to more efficient S19 XP models.\n\nMarathon reached its primary domestic growth target of 23 exahashes and now aims to hit 30 exahashes, with two planned to be obtained through international facilities and five by contract from other entities.\n\nRelated: Marathon Digital Q2 results miss revenue and earnings forecasts\n\nMarathon is also finalizing paperwork on its new mining facility in Garden City, Texas, with its joint venture in Abu Dhabi mining 50 Bitcoin in August.\n\nAs to the relative decrease in BTC production, Marathon CEO Fred Thiel blames it on climate conditions:\n\n\u201cThe decrease in Bitcoin production from July was largely due to increased curtailment activity in Texas due to record high temperatures. These temporary shutdowns more than offset the progress we have made to increase our operational hash rate and optimize our operations.\u201d\n\nIn August, Marathon published its Q2 2023 financial results, claiming a 228% increase in revenue over Q2 2022. The company reported a $23.4 million gain from selling 63% of the Bitcoin mined in the quarter, which it used to fund operating costs.

        "content": "In the latest episode of Cointelegraph\u2019s The Market Report, analyst Marcel Pechman explores the drivers that point to Bitcoin heading to $22,000, with investor sentiment worsening after Grayscale Investment\u2019s much-hyped legal victory against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Aug. 29 and its postponement of multiple spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund applications.\n\nAccording to Pechman, on the side of the bears are multiple lawsuits from the SEC against Binance and Coinbase, including a potential indictment from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding money laundering and facilitating trades from Russian entities. But, more importantly, U.S. inflation has come down to 3.2%, and the U.S. Federal Reserve is draining liquidity from the markets.\n\nPechman also analyzes BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes\u2019s claims that the Bitcoin bull market began in March. Hayes pinpoints the Silicon Valley Bank fallout and the subsequent intervention by the U.S. Treasury Department as the turning points for the crypto market.\n\nPechman agrees with Hayes but raises the issue of the U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. dollar against other major foreign currencies, such as the euro or the Swiss franc, and now sits at the same level as six months prior. Pechman says investors have realized that other countries would likely collapse before the U.S. in the event of a global economic recession.\n\nUltimately, Pechman believes it doesn\u2019t matter to the Federal Reserve if salvaging the banks could trigger economic turmoil, given that U.S. Treasurys and the U.S. dollar are still considered the safest options.\n\nListen to the full episode of The Market Report on the new Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel, and don\u2019t forget to click \u201cLike\u201d and \u201cSubscribe\u201d to keep up-to-date with all our latest content.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space."

        "title": "Severance Taxes Saved by Diverting Flared Gas to Bitcoin Mining - FORVIS",
        "content": "Well and pipeline operators in Texas have a new opportunity to apply for a severance tax exemption on otherwise vented or flared gas.\n\nTexas House Bill 591 (HB 591)\n\nHB 591 was signed by Gov. Greg Abbott on June 2, 2023 with an effective date of September 1, 2023. This bill allows for an exemption of severance taxes on natural gas wells that would have legally vented or flared gas. HB 591 may be specifically of interest to those diverting flared gas for use in on-site consumption in mobile centers for bitcoin mining and other mobile or modular data centers. Data center demand continues to rise, especially as artificial intelligence (AI) gains steam.\n\nEligibility\n\nThe gas must be consumed \u201cnear\u201d the qualifying well, which has been defined as 1,000 feet.\n\nA qualifying well is one that: Is connected to a pipeline whose capacity is not expected to meet the demand for gas produced from the well, or Is not connected to a pipeline and would be economically unfeasible to connect to a pipeline, but is operated by a well operator that has contracted the produced gas to a pipeline operator, or Is not connected to a pipeline and is operated by a well operator that has not contractually dedicated the well, the gas produced by the well, or the land or lease on which the well is located to a pipeline operator.\n\n\n\nApplication\n\nThe well operator\u2014and pipeline operator, if applicable\u2014may apply to the Texas Railroad Commission (the TX-RRC) for a severance tax exemption with the following: Attestation of pipeline takeaway capacity not expected to meet the demand for gas produced from the well, and Certification of TX-RRC authorization for gas from that well to be flared for at least 30 days during the preceding year in which the application is filed.\n\nOnce the certification of the well is approved by the TX-RRC, the operator of the well will receive a certificate from the TX-RRC.\n\nUpon TX-RRC certification of the application, a separate application must be filed with the Texas Comptroller.\n\nThis is an annual application process.\n\nQuantifying the Opportunity\n\nA report published in the July 2022 issue of NAPE magazine helps quantify the opportunity well and pipeline operators may have. The publication looked at 185 wells in Reeves County, Texas, that are estimated to be flaring 275,000 Mcf per month. The report estimates that selling this vented or flared gas to data centers would generate about $3.4 million in monthly revenue. This does not consider the additional severance tax that could be saved if the well is a certified HB 591 well.\n\nESG & SEC Reporting Implications\n\nEnvironmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals and targets are commonly discussed in many boardrooms today. HB 591 creates additional opportunities for operators in Texas to improve ESG performance, while potentially saving on taxes and generating additional revenues.\n\nThe SEC has signaled it will be requiring new climate-related disclosures. However, the timing of when this rule will go into effect is still uncertain. Recent SEC commissioner comments continue to indicate that Scope 1 disclosures will be a key component of the finalized rule. Often, a firm\u2019s flared gas is captured under Scope 1 emissions; therefore, reducing flaring could lead to a reduction in a company\u2019s overall greenhouse gas emissions profile.\n\nSource: WRI/WBCSD Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (PDF), page 5.\n\nConclusion\n\nHB 591 solidifies the severance tax exemption in Texas. Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, said, \u201cMany oil and gas operators have not seriously considered partnering with a bitcoin miner to help mitigate and monetize their flared gas. This bill will act as a signal to them that they should consider it more seriously.\u201d\n\nThe eligibility requirements and application process are complex and nuanced. If you have questions or need assistance with your application to the TX-RRC and Texas Comptroller or are searching for holistic tax planning and compliance strategies, please reach out to a professional at FORVIS or submit the Contact Us form below."

        "content": "The team behind nonfungible token collection OnChainMonkey is shifting its entire collection of 10,000 NFTs from Ethereum to Bitcoin, in a massive undertaking expected to take several months.\n\n\"A historical transition is on the horizon as we prepare to migrate our flagship collection, OCM Genesis, from Ethereum to Bitcoin,\u201d Metagood co-founder and CEO Danny Yang said in a statement on Sept. 7.\n\nThe OnChainMonkeys were first launched in September 2021 on Ethereum, but Yang said the migration to Bitcoin Ordinals was due to its community seeing Bitcoin as offering a more secure platform for its users.\n\n\u201cThe Bitcoin Ordinal protocol is better designed for decentralization and security than the Ethereum NFT protocol. High-value NFTs will win on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe proposal to migrate to Bitcoin was passed by 99% of OnChainMonkey tokenholders. Yang said this means the community had a high conviction for moving to Bitcoin.\n\nThe migration would come at a hefty cost though, with Metagood expecting to fork out over $1 million to ensure the migration process runs smoothly.\n\nWhy is the Art and Collectibles market significant for Bitcoin?

Holders will receive the corresponding Bitcoin Ordinal once they\u2019ve burned the Ethereum NFT.\n\nHowever, Yang says the migration shouldn\u2019t be too challenging compared to what Metagood has already accomplished in the Bitcoin Ordinals space:\n\n\u201cWe were the first to inscribe 10,000 images of a collection on Bitcoin. We were the first to launch a parent-child collection with OCM Dimensions 300. We pioneered recursive inscriptions on Bitcoin, as well as inscribing Three.js and p5.js for everyone to use.\u201d\n\nHowever, Ethereum continues to dominate the NFT market, settling $236.8 million in NFTs over the last month, compared to second place Solana ($37.7 million), with Bitcoin ($11.1 million) back in sixth place, according to CryptoSlam.\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin Ordinals transaction volumes plunged 98% between May and mid-August despite rising to popularity in early 2023.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals is dead.\n\n\n\nBitcoin is dead. We heard this many many times over the years. In the case of Bitcoin Ordinals, let's actually understand what actually is dead.\n\n\n\n1. Bitcoin Ordinals is a new protocol at release 0.8.2.

Both Bitcoin and Ethereum NFT ecosystems can thrive, he added.\n\nRelated: Ordinals still make up majority of Bitcoin txs despite price collapse\n\nOnChainMonkey NFTs currently trade at an average floor price of 1.10 Ether (ETH) with over 20,550 ETH in transaction volume from 9,500 items since it launched on NFT marketplace OpenSea in September 2021.\n\nOf the 2,900 owners of the OnChainMonkey NFTs, 31% are unique owners, according to OpenSea.\n\nList of OnChainMonkey NFTs currently traded on OpenSea.

        "content": "Photo Illustration by Avishek Das/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nIn a pioneering move, El Salvador is gearing up to introduce Bitcoin education into its public school curriculum by 2024. Spearheaded by the Ministry of Education and backed by the non-profit organisation Mi Primer Bitcoin (MPB), also known as \"My First Bitcoin,\" this visionary initiative aims to equip the nation's youth with the knowledge and skills necessary to embrace the digital currency revolution.El Salvador has been a trailblazer in adopting Bitcoin as a legal tender, and now it's taking its commitment to crypto education to the next level. The Ministry of Education is collaborating with MPB and Bitcoin Beach, a community-driven initiative in El Salvador, to integrate Bitcoin into the country's public school curriculum within the next three years.Students who complete the Bitcoin curriculum will be awarded a diploma, signifying their proficiency in Bitcoin-related concepts and applications. John Dennehy, the founder of Mi Primer Bitcoin, emphasised the program's crucial role in shaping the curriculum's content and direction.The journey toward Bitcoin enlightenment commences on September 7 with the launch of a pilot program. This inaugural phase will see 150 public school teachers from 75 institutions undergo comprehensive training to establish a solid foundation of Bitcoin knowledge. The aim is to equip educators with the necessary expertise to effectively teach their students about Bitcoin and its significance in the modern financial landscape.El Salvador's commitment to Bitcoin education aligns with its pioneering stance on crypto adoption. In June 2021, El Salvador became the first nation to embrace Bitcoin as legal tender, a historic move that captured global attention. The country's President, Nayib Bukele, has been a vocal proponent of crypto adoption and has initiated various initiatives to integrate Bitcoin into the nation's economy.John Dennehy sees the program as more than just an educational endeavour, as it's an opportunity for El Salvador to inspire the world regarding Bitcoin adoption and education. He believes that quality education is pivotal in ensuring that El Salvador's pioneering example sets a positive precedent for the global adoption of digital currencies.As El Salvador paves the way for Bitcoin literacy in its schools, it could inspire other nations to follow suit, accelerating the global understanding and acceptance of cryptos. The world eagerly observes El Salvador's progress as it takes a noteworthy stride towards a Bitcoin-savvy future."

        "title": "Bitcoin's Wild Ride: Analyzing the Volatility of the Past Month - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Few assets garner as much attention and scrutiny as Bitcoin in the ever-changing cryptocurrency world. The previous month has demonstrated the intrinsic volatility of this digital money, leaving both investors and analysts befuddled by its volatile price movements. In this article, we look at Bitcoin's recent wild journey, evaluating the reasons that have contributed to its volatility and examining the consequences for the broader crypto market.\n\nPrice Swings on a Roller-Coaster\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is infamous for its wild price changes, and Bitcoin is frequently at the epicenter of these movements. Bitcoin's price has fluctuated dramatically over the last month, leaving investors both excited and concerned. This wild ride serves as a reminder of the unusual character of cryptocurrency markets, where emotion and external factors can have a large impact on pricing in a short period of time.\n\nIs Bitcoin's Low Volatility Pointing to a Potential Further Decline?\n\nBitcoin and various cryptocurrencies are currently experiencing low volatility, a pattern that has preceded further price declines in recent times. Bitcoin's price has remained relatively flat at around $25,750 over the past 24 hours, staying below the $26,000 level, which has served as a key support in the previous month. This comes after a brief surge above $28,000 following a pro-crypto court ruling, which proved to be short-lived.\n\nBitcoin's volatility has reached record lows in recent months, and it appears to be returning to that pattern, lacking the dynamism seen in traditional markets like the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500.\n\nHowever, cryptocurrencies continue to be influenced by the same macroeconomic factors affecting equities. Concerns over resurging inflation and its impact on interest rates, which, in turn, affect the demand for riskier assets, have put pressure on the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe Causes of the Volatility\n\nBitcoin's volatility is caused by a variety of causes, and recent events have highlighted some of the most important ones. Bitcoin's price trajectory can be influenced by regulatory developments, market sentiment, macroeconomic trends, and technological improvements.\n\nUncertainty in Regulation\n\nGovernment regulatory announcements or crackdowns can have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market. Speculation about prospective regulatory changes might cause market volatility and sell-offs. For example, rumors of heightened regulatory scrutiny in a major market can cause investors to panic sell, resulting in dramatic price reductions.\n\nMarket Attitudes\n\nInvestor attitude fluctuations frequently impact cryptocurrency markets. Positive news, such as institutional adoption or endorsements from high-profile personalities, can cause price spikes to occur quickly. Negative news, such as security breaches or legal issues, might, on the other hand, cause sell-offs and significant price decreases.\n\nTrends in Macroeconomics\n\nBitcoin's value is also affected by broader economic factors. During periods of economic uncertainty, investors may regard Bitcoin as a safe haven against traditional financial markets, resulting in greater demand and price increases. In contrast, during periods of economic optimism, Bitcoin's price may fall as investors shift toward riskier assets.\n\nTechnological Progress\n\nBitcoin's price can be influenced by technological advancements inside the bitcoin ecosystem. Updates to the Bitcoin network, scalability enhancements, and breakthroughs in security protocols can all have an impact on investor confidence and price stability.\n\nConsequences for the Crypto Market\n\nThe dramatic price oscillations of Bitcoin might have repercussions throughout the cryptocurrency industry. Alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, frequently follow Bitcoin's lead, with their prices corresponding to Bitcoin's changes. This connection arises from Bitcoin's prominence and status as the crypto space's benchmark.\n\nWhen the price of Bitcoin fluctuates significantly, it might increase trading activity across all cryptocurrencies. Traders may attempt to profit from short-term price movements, increasing volatility throughout the market. Furthermore, significant price movements in Bitcoin can cause investors to rethink their positions in other cryptocurrencies, potentially causing cascading impacts on their pricing.\n\nGetting Through the Volatility\n\nWhile Bitcoin's volatility brings both opportunities and threats, investors must proceed with caution and knowledge.\n\nA variety of factors can influence short-term price fluctuations, many of which are difficult to forecast. As a result, navigating the unpredictable cryptocurrency market requires a long-term investing strategy underpinned by comprehensive research and risk management.\n\nA Look Into the Future\n\nBitcoin's volatility may progressively reduce as cryptocurrency marketplaces develop and regulatory clarity improves. Participation by institutions, regulatory acceptance, and widespread adoption could all contribute to a more stable price environment. However, due to the speculative character of cryptocurrencies, some volatility is expected to endure.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin's recent rapid rise highlights the cryptocurrency market's unique difficulties and prospects. While its volatility can be intimidating, it also exposes the possibility of large gains and losses in a short period of time. Traders and investors must remain cautious, remaining educated about the factors influencing Bitcoin's price movements and taking into account their risk tolerance and investment objectives. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem evolves, the lessons acquired from Bitcoin's wild ride will surely impact market participants' strategies."

That leads to the second key difference: Bitcoin BSC offers staking rewards.\n\nInvestors in BTCBSC can stake the token to validate transactions on the blockchain and earn rewards without traditional Bitcoin mining. The token is structured so that new BTCBSC rewards are released every 10 minutes, on the same schedule as Bitcoin block rewards.\n\nStaked tokens are locked for 7 days. The reward investors receive is proportional to how many tokens they have staked out of the entire staking pool.\n\nThe ability to stake BTCBSC changes the incentives for investors in this token. They can profit not only from the price of BTCBSC increasing, but also from holding and staking BTCBSC and earning token rewards.\n\nSixty-nine percent of the total BTCBSC token supply has been set aside for staking rewards, ensuring that there are enough tokens to continue rewarding investors for 120 years. BTCBSC rewards will cease around the same time that Bitcoin is fully mined out.\n\nBNB smart chain offers fast, low-cost transactions in BTCBSC\n\nAnother important advantage for BTCBSC is that the BNB Smart Chain offers extremely fast and cheap transactions. It\u2019s faster than not only the Bitcoin blockchain, but also the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThis makes BTCBSC a potential alternative to the ERC-20 Bitcoin clone BTC20. Whereas investors can transact BTCBSC for an estimated $0.10 on BNB Smart Chain, transactions in BTC20 on the Ethereum blockchain can cost up to $10.\n\nBEP-20 tokens like BTCBSC are also widely compatible with dApps, including decentralized wallet apps like MetaMask and Trust Wallet. That makes it easy for investors to buy and sell BTCBSC, including during the presale. Presale investors can purchase BTCBSC on the Bitcoin BSC homepage using ETH, BNB, or USDT.\n\nBitcoin BSC presale promises fair launch at $0.99 price\n\nThe Bitcoin BSC presale, going on now, offers investors a limited-time chance to lock in BTCBSC at a price of only $0.99. That\u2019s nearly the same price at which BTC20 launched before delivering a 7x return for investors.\n\nThe total supply of BTCBSC is 21 million tokens, the same as for Bitcoin. The presale will make 6,125,000 tokens available for purchase, while the remaining 14,455,000 tokens are reserved for staking rewards.\n\nAt launch, BTCBSC will have a market cap of $6,063,750. That\u2019s nearly 100,000 times lower than the market cap of Bitcoin, illustrating just how much room this new token has to run after it hits exchanges.\n\nInvestors can check out the Bitcoin BSC whitepaper or follow the project\u2019s Twitter and Telegram accounts for the latest presale updates and roadmap progress.\n\nThe presale has a soft cap of $3.96 million and, based on the performance so far, it could sell out quickly. Once the presale sells out, the team behind Bitcoin BSC plans to launch the token on a BNB Smart Chain-based decentralized exchange.\n\nTake part in the Bitcoin BSC presale, powered by Web3Payments, at bitcoinbsc.io."

        "title": "NFT Community OnChainMonkey Spends Over $1 Million USD to Migrate the Entire Digital Art Collection from ... - Business Wire",
        "content": "REDMOND, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Metagood, the creators of OnChainMonkey (OCM), are the first to move a 10,000 NFT collection, OCM Genesis, from Ethereum, the nominal home of smart contracts, to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, the most decentralized and secure blockchain. The OCM DAO voted to financially subsidize some of the substantial cost of the large migration from Ethereum to Bitcoin.\n\nOn 30 August 2023, the OCM team proposed subsidizing the cost of this migration and making it free for all OCM Genesis NFT holders with a Bitcoin Badge. The Bitcoin Badge was rewarded to OCM holders who participated in missions that took about a year to complete.\n\nThe DAO proposal will award a subsidy of 350 ETH (approximately USD $570,787 currently) for the migration to Genesis, and reached a quorum of 2,000 votes within 24 hours and finished with over 4,700 votes cast in favor of the proposal. This is the highest number of votes any DAO proposal has received within 24 hours since OCM\u2019s DAO was founded in 2021. The proposal had nearly unanimous support, with 99% of voters supporting the migration to Bitcoin.\n\nThe vote was not assured and involved an education campaign on Bitcoin Ordinals and the new technical development of Recursive Inscriptions led by the Metagood leadership team, who proposed the migration idea and wrote the DAO proposal.\n\nImportantly, the OCM community subsidy doesn't cover all of the costs of migration, which amount to around $1M. Metagood is covering the rest of the cost for their community of holders.\n\n\u201cOur OCM community has conviction in our move to Bitcoin,\" said Metagood CEO and co-founder and OCM Genesis Collection creator Danny Yang. \"We have been involved with Ordinals since the beginning of the year, and the OCM community, in particular, has a great understanding of the potential and benefits of the migration to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\n\"A historical transition is on the horizon as we prepare to migrate our flagship collection, OCM Genesis, from Ethereum to Bitcoin. Inscribed in early February in inscription #20219, Genesis represents our firm belief in the promising future that awaits digital artifacts on Bitcoin,\u201d said Metagood co-founder and COO Amanda Terry. \u201cIt is remarkable that the DAO almost unanimously voted for the Ordinals technology that only emerged in February this year.\u201d\n\nIn truth, part of the vote likely reflects the faith in Metagood and OCM co-founder Danny Yang, who has been building on Bitcoin since founding Maicoin, his first Bitcoin company, in 2013 (the largest cryptocurrency company in Taiwan today), and early in building on Ordinals. Yang helped pioneer recursive inscriptions, creating 3D generative art on Bitcoin with the OCM Dimensions collection. The recursive inscription technology gives Bitcoin new powers, previously thought impossible without changing Bitcoin\u2019s core protocol. Now, complex programs can be stored and run from the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nRecursion and other features of Ordinals allow for an on-chain kind of NFTs referred to as Digital Artifacts. These are more secure and decentralized NFTs.\n\n\u201cA migration of this order of magnitude is a monumental milestone for our OCM Community and a first-of-its-kind migration and upgrade for a 10K collection,\" mentioned Danny Yang. \"The Genesis collection will have a ton of innovative features to its name and be on Block 9 Satoshis (sats), the first sats in circulation. They will be in sequential order, matching the sats, and have clear collection provenance on Bitcoin, and provenance going back to their origin on Ethereum.\u201d\n\nYang said further: \u201cIn the past, other projects have been paid a substantial amount of money to move to another blockchain. We are doing the opposite. We are so convinced in our move that we are spending more than $1M of our own resources to make the move to Bitcoin and in an important and innovative way.\u201d\n\nClearly, OCM DAO members believe in this truly decentralized future for digital assets on Bitcoin. OnChainMonkey will celebrate its 2 year anniversary of the launch of its Genesis collection on Ethereum this Monday, September 11.\n\nAbout OnChainMonkey\n\nOnChainMonkey, created by Metagood, is a pioneering digital art collection. It is the first NFT profile pic collection created on-chain in a single transaction on Ethereum in 2021. In 2023, OnChainMonkey made history again, becoming the first 10k collection inscribed on Bitcoin in inscription 20219. The collection of 10,000 generative art NFTs is led by an experienced team, including Danny Yang, who founded Taiwan\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange Maicoin; Amanda Terry, who served as a digital media business development executive at Twitter and NBC; and Bill Tai, a legendary VC who was the first investor in Zoom and early investor in Canva, Dapper Labs as well as over 20 companies that have become publicly listed. The OnChainMonkey community is building businesses in Web3 and making real world impact.

        "title": "Hedging cryptocurrencies with futures: A look at common use cases - Coinbase",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have delivered strong returns relative to traditional assets on both an absolute and a risk-adjusted basis over the past decade, with bitcoin generating an annualized return of 47.88% and a Sharpe ratio of 2.08, compared to 10.26% and 0.84 for the S&P 500, according to data from Portfolios Lab as of August 9, 2023. But the common tradeoff has been exposure to high volatility. For many investors, managing that volatility can be challenging, and that\u2019s led to increasing interest in hedging that risk. While there is a cost to hedging any investment, crypto or otherwise, the costs of not hedging can be significantly higher. History is rife with examples of institutions \u2013 from Long Term Capital Management to Lehman Brothers or First Republic \u2013 that have collapsed, largely as a result of their failure to properly hedge their exposure to different financial risks. Holders of cryptocurrencies may want to hedge for various reasons. Venture capital firms (VCs) might want to hedge the risks of tokens they own that are currently locked; participants in proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols may wish to hedge potential downside price moves while staking; and miners may want to insulate themselves from future price volatility. It\u2019s possible to hedge crypto holdings using liquid and regulated futures, but doing so requires a keen understanding of which vehicles and strategies to use, how different cryptocurrencies are correlated, and how to manage costs and mitigate risks. Choosing the appropriate hedging strategy depends on the particular circumstances and assets. Below, we look at some of the most common use cases and provide investors with guidelines to help them construct effective hedges for each.\n\nScenario 1: Protecting staked positions As ethereum (ETH) and other PoS cryptocurrencies have garnered greater market share, many holders have opted to stake their holdings. When users want to withdraw or unlock their staked tokens, a process known as unbonding, they need to initiate a request to release the locked funds from the staking contract. However, most PoS networks impose a lockup period, and, in the case of ETH, the exit queue was several weeks long immediately after withdrawals were enabled in April 2023. While the wait time has since normalized, it is still variable. If holders want to insulate themselves from price declines while waiting to complete the unbonding process, or if they want to hedge against depreciation risks while actively staking their assets, they can sell futures against their holdings. For ETH holders this is relatively straightforward, as there are liquid ETH futures contracts available. But liquid and regulated derivatives may not be available for holders of other commonly staked tokens, such as Polkadot (DOT) and Cardano (ADA). In these cases, holders can construct cross hedges using (other) positively correlated assets. For example, a synthetic hedge can be created by selling an appropriate amount of either bitcoin (BTC) or ETH futures as a proxy. To determine which futures contract to use, holders could identify the cryptocurrency with the highest positive correlation to their staked asset. For example, as seen in the table below, DOT and ADA both exhibit slightly stronger correlations with ETH than with BTC, so ETH futures may provide a more precise hedge. Next, holders may calculate the hedge ratio, which is defined as: (Standard Deviation of Spot Asset / Standard Deviation of Futures Contract) * Correlation Coefficient. For example, as of August 7, 2023, DOT had a standard deviation of 2.74 and ETH had a standard deviation of 2.13, according to Macroaxis data, while the 30-day correlation coefficient between the two was 0.83, as seen in the table below. So the hedge ratio between the two was: (2.74/2.13) * 0.76 = .1.07. So, each dollar of DOT exposure in this hypothetical example could be hedged with $1.07 of ETH futures. Correlations among BTC, ETH, ADA, and DOT BTC ETH ADA DOT BTC - 0.89 0.86 0.76 ETH 0.89 - 0.84 0.83 ADA 0.86 0.84 - 0.73 DOT 0.76 0.83 0.73 - Source: Coinbase, August 2023. Of course, correlations can and do change over time, sometimes quite suddenly. So, when constructing hedges such as these, where the asset used to hedge is different from the one held, it\u2019s crucial to continuously monitor the performance of the assets and the correlation between them and to adjust the hedge ratio if necessary. It is also worth noting that hedges can not protect against certain risks that are unique to crypto assets, notably protocol risk, which is the risk associated with the underlying technology or protocol on which a cryptocurrency operates. For example, if a significant security vulnerability were discovered in a token\u2019s underlying protocol, the price of the token \u2013 and its correlation with BTC and ETH \u2013 could drop meaningfully.\n\nScenario 2: Hedging assets that are locked up Many token holders, notably VC firms, are subject to lockup periods that can last several years, during which tokens cannot be liquidated. Tokens with significant market caps and a high percentage of locked assets include Arbitrum (ARB), Avalanche (AVAX), and Sui (SUI). As with many staked tokens, liquid and regulated derivatives are not available for these locked tokens, but it is possible to construct a hedge with BTC or ETH futures. The table below shows the 30-day correlation coefficients between ARB, AVA, SUI, BTC, and ETH. Again, we see relatively high correlations to ETH and slightly lower correlations to BTC. Correlations among BTC, ETH, ARB, AVAX, and SUI BTC ETH ARB AVAX SUI BTC - 0.89 0.63 0.44 0.55 ETH 0.89 - 0.68 0.59 0.54 ARB 0.63 0.68 - 0.67 0.54 AVAX 0.44 0.59 0.67 - 0.39 SUI 0.55 0.54 0.54 0.39 - Source: Coinbase, August 2023.\n\nScenario 3: Hedging for bitcoin miners Bitcoin miners depend on selling their BTC for more than it costs them to mine it, so significant price declines can seriously impair profitability. This dynamic would seem to make hedging a natural part of the mining business, as it is for miners of traditional commodities like gold. However, many miners didn\u2019t hedge their exposure throughout bitcoin\u2019s long bull market. But the bear market of 2022 drove home the potential benefits of hedging, and more miners are now hedging with derivatives. To do so, miners can sell futures contracts with a notional value equivalent to the value of their BTC holdings or sell \u201cforward production\u201d and lock in a price at which their mined BTC can be sold. Alternatively, miners could hedge the portion of their mined BTC that is needed to pay for fixed operational expenses (e.g., estimated energy costs) and leave the balance of their BTC production unhedged to retain market exposure. By selling futures, miners don\u2019t have to pay an upfront cost (beyond minor transaction costs outlined below), as they would if they were purchasing put options because futures are settled at expiry. If the miner sold BTC futures at $25,000 and the price was trading at $26,000 at expiry, then they would owe $1,000 per coin. They would sell their spot BTC and pay the cost, pocketing the $25,000 per coin. If the price went down to $20,000 per coin at expiry, the futures contract would essentially pay the $5,000 difference \u2013 again, allowing them to realize a price of $25,000 per coin. Miners need to maintain enough cash margin to support the futures position throughout the lifecycle. If the price of BTC were to increase significantly, for example, they might need to post additional (variation) margin. These margin requirements are designed to protect both parties involved in the futures contract and ensure that the gains are able to be paid by the losing party."

        "title": "Waiting For Confirmation: Bitcoin Optech's Series On Mempool And Policy - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Much of the discussion about Bitcoin technology lately revolves around various soft-fork consensus changes to the Bitcoin protocol including new opcodes or sighashes or around layer 2 technologies like Lightning. Discussion of mempool or policy (the non-consensus rules around Bitcoin nodes communicating with one another) often falls to the background. However, with recent high transaction volume and launch of various NFT and token projects/platforms and the accompanying feerate spike, mempool and policy came to the forefront.\n\nUser of Inscriptions and other protocols ran into issues with standardness policy rules, leading many to question their purpose and look for ways to remove or subvert them. Regular Bitcoin users ran into issues with fees or bumping fees. In an effort to educate and engage the community, Bitcoin developers Gloria Zhao and Murch authored a 10-week series about mempool and relay policy called \u2018Waiting for confirmation\u2019 on the Bitcoin Optech website.\n\nThe series starts with an overview of what this cache of unconfirmed transactions we call a mempool is and why we have one. Having a mempool of unconfirmed transactions allows better fee estimation for wallets, faster downloading of new blocks, and supports a decentralized transaction and block relay network.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin miners are under no obligation to include these unconfirmed transactions in a block. As block space is limited, miners select transactions with the highest feerate by transaction weight to maximize their profits. The post on incentives details some nuances around feerates including the fact that onchain fees are paid not in proportion to the transaction amount but by the size of the transaction and complications that arise with relationships between different transactions.\n\nBut what should a transaction\u2019s feerate be? That is the goal of feerate estimation: to translate a user\u2019s urgency into a minimal feerate a transaction should pay. Transactions in the mempool and transactions in recent blocks can help provide a good start for estimating transaction fees.\n\nIn \u2018Bidding for block space\u2019 Gloria and Murch discuss practical strategies to get the most for your transaction fees. When creating a transaction, consider coin selection, using newer output types like taproot\u2019s P2TR that allow for fee savings, or batching. After broadcasting a transaction, techniques like Child Pays For Parent (CPFP) and Replace By Fee (RBF) can be used to increase the feerate of a transaction that is taking too long to confirm.\n\nWith the goal of a robust and decentralized network of Bitcoin nodes in mind, we want it to be as cheap and accessible as possible for anyone to run a node. Not only that, but a node\u2019s resources must be protected from DoS attacks. Transaction policy rules that are more restrictive than Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules help protect node resources (including memory, computational resources, and bandwidth) by enforcing limits on its untrusted peers on the Bitcoin P2P network.\n\nLikewise, network-wide resources including the UTXO set, protocol upgrade hooks, the size of the block chain and the computational effort required to process it, also need to be protected. A series of other policy rules, including limits on arbitrary data publishing to the block chain, minimum feerates, and limits on low value outputs all help safeguard these network resources.\n\nWhile policy is optional, Bitcoin Core doesn't offer many ways to configure them. In \u2018Policy Consistency\u2019 Gloria and Murch outline potential ramifications of altering some of the default policies and why Bitcoin Core has historically been conservative with the configurability of policies.\n\nIt is not just individuals running nodes that should be aware of transaction policy rules. Wallets, services, and layer 2 protocols that broadcast transactions must be designed with policy rules in mind to avoid creating transactions that are rejected and to ensure they can get confirmed, even during times of fluctuating feerates. For example, different types of pinning attacks are possible on L2 settlement transactions like Lightning that take advantage of limitations in mempool policy to prevent incentive-compatible transactions from entering mempools or getting confirmed.\n\nJust as policy rules have been changed or added in the past, there are a series of proposals to improve policy as well. Package relay, cluster mempool, version 3 transaction relay, and ephemeral anchors are a few that are under development currently.\n\nHowever, since transaction relay policy changes to Bitcoin Core can impact many ecosystem participants, they require collaboration, socialization, feedback, and testing from the wider Bitcoin community prior to consideration. The authors note: \u201cDecentralized decision-making is a challenging process, but necessary to support the diverse ecosystem of protocols and applications that use Bitcoin\u2019s transaction relay network.\u201d\n\nReaders should consider getting involved in the different avenues of discussion and participation.\n\nBitcoin Optech\u2019s also has a podcast special that highlights all of the 10 weeks of our discussion with Murch and Gloria, including comments by guest speakers and questions from the audience.\n\nThank you to Gloria Zhao and Mark \u201cMurch\u201d Erhardt for authoring the series as well as explaining each weekly article on the Bitcoin Optech Podcast.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Blockchain analytical firm Arkham Intelligence identified Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust as the second-largest Bitcoin (BTC) holder in a Sept. 6 post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nThe company said that the trust is the \u201csecond largest BTC entity globally\u201d and that the fund contains over $16 billion of the flagship digital asset. This is in tandem with Grayscale\u2019s website, which shows that the total assets under its BTC trust are $16.009 billion.\n\nArkham revealed that the funds are distributed among more than 1,750 addresses, each holding 1,000 BTC or less. The wallets were identified despite Grayscale\u2019s decision to keep the trust\u2019s on-chain addresses confidential.\n\nLast year, Grayscale faced heavy speculations about its Bitcoin balance after the collapse of FTX. At the time, the crypto investment funds cited \u201csecurity concerns\u201d as why it decided not to publish on-chain addresses associated with it. Nonetheless, its custodial partner, Coinbase, later released a report detailing the assets it held on behalf of the investment firm.\n\nArkham\u2019s disclosure positions it as the pioneering firm in identifying the specific addresses associated with the GBTC fund.\n\nArkham previously identified Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust as the second-largest Ethereum (ETH) holder, with addresses associated with the fund holding around $5 billion worth of ETH. The firm had also identified Robinhood as the holder of the third-largest Bitcoin wallet and the fifth-largest Ethereum wallet.\n\nGBTC discount under 20%\n\nGBTC\u2019s discount has remained under 20% despite the bearish sentiments that have kept BTC under $26,000 for most of the current month, according to Ycharts data.\n\nThe discount had rapidly dropped to its lowest level within the last two years after Grayscale secured a victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in August. The court had ruled that the financial regulator acted \u201carbitrarily and capriciously\u201d in rejecting its attempt to convert its trust into an exchange-traded fund.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Bitcoin vs. Gold: Google Bard AI shared 4 reasons why BTC is better - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Since the emergence of Bitcoin (BTC), its proponents have often regarded the cryptocurrency as a potential rival to the traditional store of value, gold. It\u2019s worth noting that these two products belong to distinct asset classes, and as Bitcoin matures, proponents believe it may eventually surpass gold. This topic has sparked debates within financial circles.\n\nIn this scenario, Finbold sought insights from the generative artificial intelligence (AI) platform Google Bard, posing, \u2018Which asset is a better investment: Bitcoin or Gold?\u2019 The tool provided four compelling reasons why Bitcoin might have an advantage over gold as an investment.\n\nGoogle Bard\u2019s comparison between Bitcoin and gold. Source: Google Bard\n\nHighly liquid and can be traded 24/7\n\nThe tool identified liquidity as the main advantage of Bitcoin. Unlike gold, which necessitates physical possession, Bitcoin can easily be traded and transferred 24/7, allowing investors to access their funds quickly and conveniently. This ease of access and high liquidity make Bitcoin an attractive option for those who value agility in their investments.\n\nEasy to store and transfer\n\nUnlike gold, which necessitates physical possession or storage in a secure vault, Bitcoin is a purely digital currency, existing solely in the digital realm. This characteristic makes it extremely easy to store and transfer.\n\nAll that is required is a digital wallet, which can be a software, hardware, or paper wallet, to Bitcoins securely. Investors can store their wallet information digitally or even memorize a passphrase, making it highly portable and easy to access.\n\nNot subject to government regulation\n\nBard also identified another point in Bitcoin\u2019s favor: its independence from government regulation. Gold has historically been subject to government oversight and regulation, which can impact its value and trade.\n\nIn contrast, Bitcoin operates on decentralized blockchain technology, making it resistant to government interference. This attribute appeals to individuals seeking a financial asset that operates outside traditional systems.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that there are ongoing global efforts meant to regulate Bitcoin, but entirely outlawing the digital currency has become a challenge.\n\nPotential for high returns\n\nSince its inception, Bitcoin\u2019s staggering value ascent has magnetized investors looking for substantial returns. While gold boasts a track record of wealth preservation, Bitcoin\u2019s price trajectory suggests the potential for significant gains within a relatively short span. This allure of high returns, however, comes bundled with cryptocurrency volatility.\n\nOn the other hand, the AI tool also offered some of Bitcoin\u2019s cons, identifying volatility, new asset class, and risks of hacking and theft as the main undoing of the maiden cryptocurrency.\n\nIt is worth noting that Bitcoin represents a relatively uncharted asset class in comparison to gold. Yet, its underlying technology holds the potential to transform various industries beyond finance. As blockchain advances, Bitcoin\u2019s utility and value may expand, making it a captivating investment.\n\nIn summary, Bard indicated that ultimately, when it comes to investment options, it narrows down to the individual and their preferences."

        "content": "In September 2021, this nation became the first in the world to establish cryptocurrency as legal tender, alongside the U.S. dollar.\n\nAlthough bitcoin reaches two years as a legal trend in El Salvador, the population has not widely embraced this cryptocurrency.\n\nIn September 2021, this nation became the first in the world to establish cryptocurrency as legal tender, alongside the U.S. dollar. Over US$250 million has been invested in this project, which stands as President Nayib Bukele's flagship economic endeavor.\n\nTwo Years with Little Data\n\nThe Bukele administration allocated US$150 million to a trust for converting cryptocurrency into dollars, spent at least US$107 million to acquire 2,381 bitcoins, and provided a US$30 bonus to those who downloaded the government's digital wallet.\n\nInformation on the use of these resources has been kept confidential by public institutions, with Bukele's social media posts being the only official source.\n\nIn mid-November 2022, Bukele announced that his administration would start purchasing one bitcoin daily. As of now, 295 days have passed, and authorities have not confirmed any such purchases. Salvadoran bitcoin reserves originally cost around US$107 million but are currently valued at approximately US$61.3 million due to fluctuations in cryptocurrency prices.\n\nIn 2022, it was also expected that the Bukele administration would issue bitcoin bonds, known as \"Volcano Bonds,\" worth US$1 billion to finance the construction of Bitcoin City in the eastern part of the country. However, this financial move did not materialize.\n\nAndy Vermaut shares:Bitcoin has only 6 billionaires in the entire world, report reveals: \"It could be worth holding onto the crypto you have in case it ramps up one day\u2014but don\u2019t bet on it.\" Thank you. https://t.co/IWCCQ9eFRP pic.twitter.com/VtemQm0Wog \u2014 Andy Vermaut (@AndyVermaut) September 6, 2023\n\nBitcoin for Campaign Financing?\n\nIn 2024, El Salvador will hold general elections, and despite constitutional objections, Bukele will seek immediate re-election for another five years.\n\nAccording to Eduardo Escobar, director of Citizens' Action, the country is once again heading into elections \"with open doors and windows for organized crime, public funds, and foreign governments to finance electoral campaigns.\"\n\n\"We have been highlighting the deficiencies in oversight by both the Supreme Electoral Tribunal and the Court of Auditors,\" he stated, adding that bitcoin \"is allowed for campaign financing\" but can also serve as a tool to obscure the source of funding.\n\nThe adoption of this cryptocurrency \"has only increased the opacity in the management of public affairs,\" Escobar said, adding that bitcoin has been used to promote an image of a modern El Salvador, which is mostly propaganda.\n\nSome Economic Figures\n\nAccording to the Central Reserve Bank (BCR), El Salvador's economy grew by 10.3 percent in 2021. However, economists attribute this growth to the post-COVID-19 economic recovery rather than the adoption of Bitcoin.\n\nIn 2022, the country's economy expanded by 2.6 percent, slightly below the expected 2.8 percent, and it is projected to close 2023 with economic growth between 2 and 3 percent, among the lowest in the region.\n\nThe number of jobs generated by the adoption of Bitcoin, as well as its contribution to foreign and private investment, remains unknown. There are at least 97 registered service providers, including recognized exchange houses.\n\nOn the other hand, El Salvador experienced a 28 percent decline in remittance receipts through cryptocurrency wallets between January and July 2023, compared to the same period in 2022."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe DFINITY Foundation\u2019s new partnership with the municipality of Lugano will see the Swiss city\u2019s MyLugano crypto payment app add support for Chain-Key Bitcoin (ckBTC), a multi-chain Bitcoin \u201ctwin\u201d running on the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain.\n\nWith the addition of ckBTC, MyLugano app introduces a multi-chain, multi-wallet solution, expanding the already existing possibilities of purchasing goods and sending transactions with LVGA, Lugano\u2019s local stablecoin, Bitcoin (BTC), and Tether\u2019s USDT.\n\nLugano is the economic capital of Southern Switzerland, strategically located between the metropolitan areas of Milan and Zurich, and has the ambition to become the world\u2019s leading crypto hub. The Swiss city, which also runs the initiative called Plan \u20bf, has previously recognized BTC, USDT, and LVGA as \u201cde facto\u201d legal tender, with more than 400 merchants accepting all these three cryptocurrencies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe started to discuss with Lugano and its technical partner NOKU in 2022, with the purpose to explore ways to integrate the Internet Computer with the MyLugano app,\u201d DFINITY Foundation\u2019s founder and chief scientist Dominic Williams told Decrypt. \u201cIt naturally made sense that as a home for blockchain that the Internet Computer played a role in the city. Today, we are proud to launch ckBTC on the MyLugano app.\u201d\n\nFirst introduced in April this year, ckBTC uses open-source, verifiable smart contracts and is described as a more cryptographically secure alternative to existing cross-chain solutions such as bridges and wrapped Bitcoin. The developers claim that by removing the dangers of third-party intermediaries and the hacking risks related to bridges, ckBTC is bringing true decentralization to DeFi and the broader blockchain space.\n\nAccording to Williams, it also maximizes the Web3 experience of Bitcoin, making it easy to use and transact at web speed and neglectable fees.\n\n\u201cckBTC is backed 1:1 by Bitcoin, and because it lives on ICP, you can transact it fast and cheap,\u201d Williams told Decrypt. \u201cAt the protocol level, ckBTC is seamlessly woven into the fabric of the Bitcoin network, creating a dynamic interplay that redefines transactional efficiency.\u201d\n\nDFINITY unveils $1 million grant fund for Lugano-based startups\n\nAs part of the collaboration, the DFINITY Foundation is launching a $1 million grant fund for Lugano-based blockchain startups. The fund will support projects working on decentralized applications that run on ICP and leverage ckBTC to create open internet services that have the potential to benefit the global community.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cConsidering its positioning as one of the fastest growing crypto hubs in the world, Lugano is driving innovation in the field of blockchain technology,\u201d Williams told Decrypt. \"These grants are intended to assist these startups in their efforts to improve, advocate for, and expand upon the Internet Computer platform.\u201d\n\nAccording to Williams, the grants will be awarded in $5,000, $25,000 and $100,000 bands, with the $100,000 grants generally reserved as a follow-on to a smaller grant.\n\n\u201cThis partnership is an excellent example of our new technology combined with Lugano\u2019s forward thinking in regard to blockchain technology to accelerate the mass adoption of Web3,\u201d he stated, adding that Lugano is one of the world\u2019s fastest growing blockchain hubs with \u201cmany exciting things happening.\u201d"

        "content": "Key Points Coinbase surged 15% on August 29, driven by news of a potential Bitcoin ETF.\n\nU.S. regulators delayed action on existing Bitcoin ETF applications until October 19.\n\nThe launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs could make cryptocurrency more accessible and push prices higher.\n\n5 stocks we like better than Coinbase Global\n\nCoinbase Global Inc. NASDAQ: COIN pulled back after rocketing nearly 15% higher on August 29 on news that a potential launch of a long-awaited Bitcoin ETF may be getting closer.\n\nInvestors were initially excited about what a new ETF might mean for Coinbase, but their expectations clearly came back down to earth. Coinbase still finished the week ending September 1 with a gain of 5.02%.\n\nGet Coinbase Global alerts: Sign Up\n\nOn August 29, a federal court brushed aside a Securities and Exchange Commission motion to stop Grayscale Investments\u2019 plans to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust OTCMKTS: GBTC to an exchange-traded fund.\n\nShares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust also leaped on the news. With assets under management north of $16.3 billion, it\u2019s the largest Bitcoin fund.\n\nA Slew Of Bitcoin ETFs To Launch?\n\nGrayscale also runs other digital asset funds, so it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see the asset manager launch additional ETFs over time.\n\nThe SEC previously gave the nod to futures-backed Bitcoin ETFs, which became available in 2021. The regulator hasn\u2019t yet OK\u2019d spot Bitcoin ETFs. The phrase \u201cspot bitcoin\u201d refers to the immediate purchase or sale of actual Bitcoin at the current market price, as distinct from futures or derivatives.\n\nOn August 31, the SEC said it was delaying action on existing Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nThere\u2019s significant interest in launching new Bitcoin funds: Several asset managers, including Fidelity, Invesco Ltd. NYSE: IVZ, BlackRock Inc. NYSE: BLK, VanEck and WisdomTree NYSE: WT have submitted applications, which the SEC says it will evaluate by October 19.\n\nIts original deadline was September 2.\n\nBlackRock, Invesco and Wisdom Tree all rose on August 29 and finished the week higher, but the broader market also rallied. It\u2019s unlikely that the asset managers\u2019 upticks were due to a future ETF with an unspecified launch date.\n\nMaking Bitcoin Easier To Purchase\n\nWhen spot Bitcoin funds are eventually launched, that will make the cryptocurrency significantly easier for many investors to purchase. For example, many curious investors would view that as a more accessible way to dabble than using an exchange such as Coinbase. As funds buy up the asset to meet investor demand, that could result in a significant price increase.\n\nThat\u2019s what caused the initial euphoria among buyers of Coinbase stock on August 29.\n\nAfter Coinbase\u2019s initial uptrend, investors seemed to come back to reality.\n\nIn June, the SEC charged Coinbase with operating an unregistered securities exchange, clearing firm, and brokerage. The agency also charged Coinbase with selling unregistered securities.\n\nYou can see on the Coinbase chart that shares initially gapped down in June on news of the SEC action, but the stock has rallied back, advancing 27.97% in the past three months and 124.92% year-to-date.\n\nShares of other Bitcoin-related stocks Marathon Digital Holdings NASDAQ: MARA and Riot Platforms Inc. NASDAQ: RIOT, also rallied on the Grayscale news. However, both showed the same trading pattern as Coinbase as they retreated in subsequent sessions.\n\nAnalysts Say \"Hold\"\n\nCoinbase, which boasts a market capitalization of $18.50 billion, is the largest of those companies and has attracted significant analyst coverage.\n\nMarketBeat\u2019s Coinbase analyst ratings show a consensus view of \u201chold,\u201d and there have been no analyst actions since the August 29 court decision.\n\nHowever, at least one analyst expressed his skepticism about Coinbase\u2019s rally.\n\nMizuho Securities Dan Dolev called the move a \u201cknee-jerk reaction and short covering\u2026.\u201d\n\nOne Analyst Doesn't See Upside\n\nOn August 23, ahead of the court ruling, Mizuho reiterated its \u201cunderperform\u201d rating on Coinbase.

        "title": "Jack Dorsey's Thirst For An Africa-Led Bitcoin Revolution Is Not Going Away - WeeTracker",
        "content": "In a significant development for the campaign to drive adoption of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin in Africa, \u20bftrust, a non-profit organisation seeded by X (fka Twitter) and Square co-founder Jack Dorsey and music tycoon Jay-Z (Shawn Carter), committed to decentralising Bitcoin software development, has recently acquired Qala, a fledgling organisation that set out to train African Bitcoin and Lightning engineers.\n\nThe deal, finalised this month, will result in Qala undergoing a rebranding as the \u20bftrust Builders Programme, marking a strategic move to further \u20bfTrust\u2019s mission of promoting the development and education of Bitcoin open-source engineers from the Global South.\n\n\u20bftrust, established in 2021 with initial funding of 500 Bitcoins from Jay-Z and Dorsey, a notable Bitcoin maximalist known to be keen on the potential for Bitcoin adoption in Africa, primarily focuses on nurturing developer talent and supporting the free and open-source Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\n\u201c[\u2026] Africa will define the future (especially the bitcoin one!) [\u2026],\u201d Dorsey wrote in 2019 as he concluded a tour of key African tech hubs, adding that he would be living in Africa for 3-6 months the following year to push the mission, though those plans ultimately never materialised. However, in 2021, Dorsey co-created the Bitcoin endowment \u2018\u20bftrust \u2018 with an initial focus on funding Bitcoin development in India and Africa, appointing three Nigerians to its board months later.\n\nAfrica\u2019s crypto prospects have long been promising, with growing adoption, innovative applications, and increasing interest from both the public and private sectors. Although the downturn currently stifling the crypto market has caused a lull, interest in Bitcoin has soared over the years as the continent embraces digital currencies, blockchain technology, and fintech innovation to address financial access gaps.\n\nCurrently overseen by a board of directors including Abubakar Nur Khalil, Carla Kirk-Cohen, Obi Nwosu, and Ojoma Ochai, \u20bftrust has initiated initiatives such as the Africa Open Source Cohort, supporting Bitcoin Development Kit contributor Vladimir Fomene, and proudly sponsoring the Africa Bitcoin Conference, an annual gathering of Bitcoin stakeholders from across Africa and beyond.\n\nOn the other hand, Qala, founded in 2021, specialises in identifying, training, and connecting African software developers with leading Bitcoin companies worldwide, equipping them with highly sought-after skills in the global Bitcoin talent market. With a vast online community spanning over 42 countries, including Nigeria, Kenya, and Uganda, Qala boasts an impressive fellowship placement rate, with its alumni securing positions at renowned companies like Galoy, SphinxChat, and Bitnob, along with receiving open-source grants from \u20bftrust and Superlunar.\n\nBernard Parah, Co-Founder/Director of Qala, expressed his enthusiasm about the acquisition, emphasising that it will significantly accelerate their mission to cultivate a critical mass of African engineers well-versed in Bitcoin\u2019s capabilities, which can drive transformative change across the continent. Parah sees this transition not just as a boost for the Bitcoin ecosystem but also as a crucial step towards leveraging Bitcoin to achieve financial freedom in Africa and the Global South.\n\nAs part of the acquisition, Femi Longe, CEO of Qala, and Stephanie Titcombe, Programmes Manager at Qala, will assume roles as Programme Leads at \u20bftrust Builders. This move signals a shift in \u20bftrust Builders\u2019 focus towards open-source training, and they have already launched a call for their next cohort of senior African software developers interested in transitioning into Bitcoin and Lightning development.\n\nOjoma Ochai, a Board Member at \u20bftrust, expressed pride in welcoming Femi and his team, highlighting Qala\u2019s remarkable work in driving open-source development in the Global South through education, closely aligning with \u20bftrust\u2019s core mission. The organisation is now committed to building upon Qala\u2019s achievements and empowering more developers in the Global South to create innovative open-source solutions using Bitcoin.\n\nLooking ahead to September 2023, \u20bftrust Builders is gearing up for the \u2018Build for Africa\u2019 Hackathon, aimed at encouraging makers to develop solutions that address African challenges and boost Bitcoin adoption on the continent. This event will serve as a platform for open innovation and collaborative problem-solving, with a particular focus on tackling Africa-specific issues and accelerating Bitcoin projects through mentorship in design, development, and Lightning integration. The hackathon sets the stage for the Africa Bitcoin Conference in December, an event that \u20bftrust supports for the second consecutive year, solidifying its commitment to the region\u2019s Bitcoin community.\n\nFeatured Image Credits: Coin Culture"

        "title": "The Fintech Owner Accused of Laundering Drug Money in Huge Bitcoin Scheme - BNN Bloomberg",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A fintech owner in London is facing allegations that he helped notorious drug traffickers attempt to launder hundreds of millions of euros through a crypto exchange platform on a scale rarely seen by European prosecutors.\n\nAuthorities in Belgium are seeking the extradition of Caio Marchesani from the UK as part of their effort to dismantle a transnational gang. They accuse the 38-year-old Italian of \u201cknowingly and intentionally\u201d hoarding piles of cash for Sergio Roberto De Carvalho, a Brazilian described by Interpol as one of the world\u2019s most wanted kingpins before his arrest in 2022, and managing crypto accounts on behalf of Flor Bressers, a Belgian national known as the \u201cfinger cutter,\u201d who was also nabbed last year.\n\nMarchesani owns Trans-Fast Remittance, a payments business regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. He was arrested in May at Heathrow Airport.\n\nThe case puts the British financial-technology scene under fresh scrutiny amid fears that its weak controls are enabling the movement of illicit funds around the world. Transparency International UK has called for tougher supervision after finding that more than one-third of UK-licensed electronic-money institutions show red flags. In response to Bloomberg queries, the FCA said it is \u201cengaging\u201d with Trans-Fast \u201cas part of our ongoing supervisory work, including in relation to these matters.\u201d\n\nThe Belgian investigation kicked off three years ago after Dutch customs officials seized more than 12 tonnes of cocaine, worth more than \u20ac260 million ($283 million), from containers at Europe\u2019s busiest port, Rotterdam. Authorities traced the haul to Bressers and De Carvalho, later zeroing in on Marchesani after a breakthrough in decoding encrypted communications.\n\nIn all, 33 suspects have been identified, linked to countries including Brazil, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and France \u2014 five are in pretrial detention, with Bressers and De Carvalho in Belgium and Marchesani in the UK.\n\nThe case against Marchesani came to light at a series of extradition hearings in London. A request for bail was turned down by the court after prosecutors described him as a flight risk. The judge intends to rule on the extradition later in September.\n\n\u2018Large Cash Sums\u2019\n\nMarchesani managed 14 Binance accounts for Bressers, according to Belgian prosecutors. He also held cash for De Carvalho, charging suspiciously high rates of as much as 9% for transferring funds, the prosecutors said.\n\nAs many as 85% of Trans-Fast customers were Brazilian, filings from a separate employment case show. A recorded company telephone message says it is currently offline and unable to process orders.\n\nThe underground network is alleged to have essentially combined new technology with hawala, a centuries-old money transfer system practiced in regions including the Middle East, where international and local remittances are paid largely based on trust. Its use of crypto currencies increased after the Covid pandemic made cash deliveries much harder, according to Belgium prosecutors. Binance provided law enforcement with \u201cpractical operational assistance\u201d in relation to the investigation, a spokesperson for the crypto-trading platform said.\n\nAmanda Bostock, a lawyer acting for Belgium authorities, described Marchesani as \u201ca dark banker who receives money and moves it around at the will of the criminal organization in order to disguise its origins.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery large cash sums\u201d protected by a round-the-clock guard were said to have been stored at an apartment Marchesani rented near the US embassy in south London, prosecutors said. He was found with some \u00a31.5 million ($1.9 million) of cryptoassets. The electronic wallet holding them was subsequently frozen.\n\nMarchesani\u2019s lawyers deny the allegations. The money for Marchesani\u2019s bail surety had legitimate origins from a UK company with a \u201cthriving business focused on healthy eating in a cafe setting,\u201d the judge said in a reference to Acai Berry Foods Ltd. of which Marchesani is the chief financial officer and a 50% shareholder. The prosecution\u2019s case has \u201cfalse, vague, ambiguous or inaccurate particulars,\u201d his lawyers at Mishcon de Reya said. \u201cWhat is clear however, is that none of the allegations against him relate to any of his business interests in the UK.\u201d\n\nMarchesani, who interned at Deutsche Bank from October 2013 to January 2014, wanted to convert Trans-Fast into an online bank according the employment case tribunal ruling. Companies House filings from August show another owner added to the registry.\n\n\u2018Everything is Criminal\u2019\n\nIn an encrypted chat decoded by authorities, Marchesani, using the moniker \u2018Greysmith,\u2019 asked, \u201cfriend, this ted 60 is for crime or normal?\u201d to which \u2018Lucrativeherb\u2019, a pseudonym prosecutors say was used by De Carvalho, replied, \u201cNormal. Everything is criminal,\u201d the Belgian law enforcers alleged. The judgment did not mention what \u2018ted 60\u2019 referred to. In another message, Marchesani is alleged to have said: \u201conly risk is when the police are around.\u201d\n\nBressers, who has a masters in criminology, was wanted on charges including kidnapping, gang drug trafficking and theft, and was arrested in February 2022 in Zurich. De Carvalho was nabbed in Hungary in June 2022 and transferred to Belgium by the air force earlier this summer. He was subject of an Interpol Red Notice, with countries including Brazil demanding his extradition for drug trafficking, money laundering, forging documents and murder in connection with organized crime.\n\nThe Belgian prosecutor said in a July letter to the UK, that nearly all the evidence has been collected and that she aimed to conclude the probe in early September. She said she\u2019d already decided the case will go to a full criminal trial. A spokesperson confirmed the letter and declined to comment.\n\nIn London, Marchesani\u2019s lawyers said they planned a further challenge to his extradition because investigators were presenting different cases at different moments. If convicted, Marchesani faces a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment in Belgium, a country his lawyers say he\u2019s never visited.\n\n--With assistance from Stephanie Bodoni, Donal Griffin and Sarah Jacob.\n\n(Corrects to say that Marchesani isn\u2019t accused of converting cash into crypto in the sub heading and the second paragraph.)\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P."

        "content": "Rick Edelman, manager of the Digital Asset Council of Financial Professionals fund, has revealed some predictions for the price of bitcoin by the summer of 2025.\n\nHe believes the price will reach $150,000 in the next two years, driven by continued technological growth and the likely approval of a spot ETF by the SEC.\n\nAt the moment, however, the price of bitcoin is struggling and the likelihood of a return to $20,000 in the short term is looking increasingly real.\n\nAll the details below.\n\nRic Edelman and his predictions for the price of bitcoin by 2025\n\nRic Edelman, founder of the Digital Asset Council of Financial Professionals, said in a recent interview with Coindesk that his predictions for the future price of bitcoin are very bullish.\n\nSpecifically, according to the manager of the $300 billion fund, the leading cryptocurrency will reach a price of $150,000 by the summer of 2025.\n\nJUST IN: \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Founder of $300 billion fund manager Ric Edelman predicts #Bitcoin to hit $150,000 by summer of 2025 \u2013 CoinDesk pic.twitter.com/B1Whoq3HNU \u2014 Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) September 5, 2023\n\nThere are many reasons for his optimism.\n\nFirstly, Ric Edelman notes that following the SEC\u2019s stepped up legal action in June this year, we are going through a period of change, with the crypto market getting rid of the \u201cbad boys\u201d and becoming a cleaner industry.\n\nIn addition, the continued technological growth of the protocol is driving adoption to new horizons, with more institutional players interested in cryptocurrency and more asset management funds, venture funds and pension funds attracted by its potential.\n\nIn particular, the entry into the crypto sector of BlackRock, Fidelity, VanEck, Wisdom Tree and Invesco with their various applications for a spot ETF and Invesco has reinforced the bullish forecasts of most digital asset analysts, who now see a rise in the price of bitcoin as increasingly likely.\n\nIndeed, the approval of a spot ETF would lead to a significant increase in volume in the regulated markets, as many fund managers would be forced to buy the underlying in the market in order to offer it to their clients, significantly reducing the supply in circulation.\n\nSpeaking of supply, Eric Edelman also mentioned the halving factor in his explanation of the bullish forecast for bitcoin, explaining that the expected halving of the miners\u2019 premium in April 2024 could trigger a bull run in the price of digital gold.\n\nAt least, this is what has happened in recent years, with bulls always coming out on top after the previous three halving of the cryptocurrency, which occurred in 2012, 2016 and 2020.\n\nFor example, if we take the price of bitcoin in October 2019 (7 months before the next halving) and that in July 2021 (the summer after the halving), we can see a 5x increase in its value.\n\nSimilarly, now that the next protocol update is 7 months away, we can expect a similar performance, which would take the price of the cryptocurrency directly to over $125,000 by 2025.\n\nIf we also take into account the much more positive outlook compared to the context of 2019, when cryptos were still a \u201cbet\u201d, we can easily agree with Erc Edelman\u2019s prediction, which could potentially reach an even higher value than the one mentioned for 2025.\n\nThe accumulation period before a BTC halving has historically been the best time to build a position.\n\n\n\nThe mark up phase post halving this time could see Bitcoin rally up to 5-600% above the current price if we assume a bull top at 150-180k.\n\n\n\nThis period won't last forever. pic.twitter.com/HK4KPL95jt \u2014 Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) September 3, 2023\n\nMarket analysis of the value of bitcoin\n\nDespite Eric Edelman\u2019s extremely positive predictions for the price of bitcoin by the summer of 2025, the short-term price action looks set to mark further declines unless a catalytic event occurs in the coming weeks.\n\nSince mid-July, the market\u2019s most capitalised crypto has interrupted the positive phase it has been experiencing throughout 2023, with prices beginning to fall rapidly without the ability to respond to the bears.\n\nNot even Grayscale\u2019s victory against the SEC on 29 August, when the appeals court described the federal agency\u2019s reaction as \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d and forced it to reconsider its offer for a spot ETF, was enough to reverse the short-term trend.\n\nThis bodes ill for the price outlook, as the asset lost 1.5% and then 5% over the next two days, wiping out all of its earlier gains.\n\nThe cryptocurrency is now hovering around $25,700, with many short positions open just above $26,000 and downward pressure looking to break through the $25,000 support.\n\nIn particular, there have been two downward attacks that ended in liquidity grabs and the formation of two spikes, one on the 22nd of August and one on the 1st of September, which has technical analysts worried. A further downward push could permanently break the key level and take bitcoin to $23,000 and then $20,000.\n\nOnly a small bullish divergence on the daily RSI, which we are currently observing, could have a positive impact on the price in the coming days, which now seems to be compromised to the downside.\n\nDaily Bitcoin price chart (BTC/USD)\n\nGiven the market outlook, it is unlikely that we\u2019ll go below $20,000, as that figure represents the top of the 2017 bull run and there are plenty of traders ready to enter the market around that level.\n\nIn any case, in the short term, the odds are in favour of the short sellers, with prices likely to fall throughout September, which is statistically a terrible month for price action in the asset.\n\nIn fact, since the currency has been tradable on the markets, there have only been 2 occasions when its price has posted positive gains this month, compared with 8 occasions when it has posted losses.\n\nOctober, on the other hand, tends to be a month of strong gains, especially in the years leading up to the half and half years.\n\nThe decline could therefore continue for a few more weeks before the bulls take over again."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is currently experiencing mounting bearish pressure, just a week after the cryptocurrency attempted to rally toward the $30,000 level, supported by positive regulatory developments. These bearish sentiments arise as crucial technical indicators signal a potential downward trajectory in both the short and medium term.\n\nAs per an analysis posted on TradingView on September 5 by TradersWeekly, caution should be observed when assessing Bitcoin\u2019s price. The analysts noted that despite a brief period of stability over the long weekend, BTC price largely remained flat, hovering around the $26,000 mark, a notable area of concern.\n\nThe analysis pointed out that after a brief spike above $28,000 last week, Bitcoin\u2019s technicals have begun to turn bearish again. Furthermore, the weekly timeframe also indicates a growing bearish sentiment, with key indicators such as the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Stochastic Oscillator pointing firmly to the downside.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView\n\nOf particular concern is the MACD, which currently hovers just slightly above the midpoint. TradersWeekly warned that a further slide to zero could spell more trouble for the cryptocurrency, anticipating a further drop below $24,000.\n\n\u201cMACD is just slightly above the midpoint, and if it breaks below zero, it will strongly bolster a bearish case in the medium term. As a result, our stance has not changed since the previous update on Bitcoin. We expect it to continue lower in the short and medium term, sliding to the area around $24,000,\u201d the analyst warned.\n\nNo interest in BTC\u2019s current price\n\nFurthermore, the analyst stated that another worrisome sign is the behavior of large investors in the cryptocurrency space. The number of Bitcoin addresses holding 1,000 or more coins dropped below levels seen shortly before last week\u2019s price spike.\n\nIn this case, the analysts consider the move a lack of interest in the current price by major players. Such behavior by institutional investors can exert further downward pressure on Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nIt is worth noting that Bitcoin briefly rallied after a United States appeals court directed the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) to reconsider its decision not to approve the Grayscale Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).\n\nHowever, Bitcoin has since slid into familiar consolidation territory, which has been synonymous with most of the year. Notably, the ETF development is considered a catalyst for Bitcoin to regain new heights, as it is seen as the driver of institutional capital into the asset.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nIn the meantime, the price of Bitcoin continues to hover below the $26,000 mark. By press time, BTC was valued at $25,744 with weekly losses of almost 7%.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart.
