        "title": "Bitcoin breaks $30,000 as ETF rumors swirl - Fortune",
        "content": "It feels like something is finally happening in the crypto markets, whose famous volatility all but vanished in the past six months, only to be replaced by something that\u2019s felt more like stagnation. During this time, Bitcoin has stayed mostly stuck in a sleepy band between $25,000 and $29,000.\n\nOn Monday, the action returned thanks to a screwy series of events. Trade publication Cointelegraph tweeted out \u201cnews\u201d that the SEC had approved BlackRock\u2019s application for a Bitcoin ETF, showing an alleged screenshot from Bloomberg\u2019s authoritative news terminal. Bitcoin prices briefly shot up over $2,000 in response, suggesting a long-awaited rally was on its way.\n\nSince this is crypto, and anything can, and does, happen, the news turned out to be fake\u2014part of an apparent news-based pump-and-dump scheme that raised awkward questions for Cointelegraph of who exactly had the keys to its social media accounts and why this happened. In any event, the rally petered out within an hour while whoever was behind the scheme presumably made a bundle on put and call options.\n\nIronically, though, the fake news served to uncover some real news\u2014that price gains expected to coincide with the SEC approving a Bitcoin ETF were not, as many thought, already baked in. This appears to have nudged the price over the course of the week until Bitcoin crossed over the psychologically important $30,000 mark in the early hours of Friday before retreating to around $29,600 by midmorning.\n\nMeanwhile, a band of social media commentators set out trying to read\u2014or misread\u2014the tea leaves for when the SEC will actually flip the switch and approve a long-awaited Bitcoin ETF. This included seizing on the fact that Friday is the day when the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit\u2014which in August rejected the SEC\u2019s reasons for not approving the ETF\u2014checks a procedural box that it is done with the case. The date does not appear to be significant but sets off a spate of bullish chatter all the same.\n\nThings also took a further twist on Thursday when New York\u2019s attorney general sued trading firm Genesis and its parent company, DCG, for joining the Winklevoss-owned Gemini in marketing 8% returns on cash and Bitcoin\u2014a business that turned out to have been based around making huge loans to Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s fraudulent hedge fund. This has raised the question of whether the lawsuit against DCG means trouble for its subsidiary, Grayscale, which is one of the front-runners to land a Bitcoin ETF. A lawyer and an analyst who cover this space obsessively say the answer is no since Grayscale is a separate operation, but we shall see.\n\nAll of this underscores how an ETF remains crypto\u2019s best hope of breaking out of its long-running slump, and how Bitcoin may be defined by drama once again.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nThe SEC has dropped charges against Ripple\u2019s top executives, but the agency is still expected to pursue its appeal of a court ruling that XRP is mostly not a security. (Fortune)\n\nThe price of XRP jumped 7% on news of the SEC dropping the charges.

        "content": "KEY TAKEAWAYS The price of bitcoin briefly rose above $30,000 for the first time since August.\n\nA final mandate from courts soon, could bring more clarity on Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's conversion to an exchange-traded fund.\n\nThe bitcoin price briefly spiked roughly 10% on an incorrect report of a spot bitcoin ETF approval earlier this week.\n\nAnalysts think a spot bitcoin ETF could raise the bitcoin price as a regulatory stamp of approval from the SEC could make the crypto asset more accessible to investors.\n\n\n\nThe price of bitcoin briefly crossed the $30,000 mark Friday for the first time since August on optimism that a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) will likely be approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the near future.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF Approval Expected Within Months\n\nMuch of the increased optimism around a spot bitcoin ETF approval comes from recent developments in a lawsuit regarding Grayscale Investments's intention to convert their Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) into an ETF.\n\nThe Securities an Exchange Commission chose not to appeal a decision by the courts that disagreed with the regulator's reasons for turning down Grayscale's ETF conversion. The courts could issue a final mandate soon that will provide more clarity on the next steps in that process.\n\nBut there were other triggers too. On Monday, an incorrect report that the SEC had approved BlackRock's spot bitcoin application, pushed bitcoin prices higher.\n\n\"Some of this rally is way beyond the rumor,\" said Blackrock CEO Larry Fink, told Fox Business in an interview clarifying the incorrect report. \"I think the rally today is about a flight to quality with all the issues around the Israeli war now [and] global terrorism. And I think there are more people running into a flight to quality, whether that's in treasuries, gold, or crypto, depending on how you think about it. And I believe crypto will play that type of role as a flight to quality.\"\n\nIn an interview with CNBC earlier this week, Galaxy Digital Holdings CEO Michael Novogratz said he thinks the SEC's approval of a spot bitcoin ETF is going to happen before the end of the year.\n\nPreviously, Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas estimated a spot bitcoin ETF's chances of approval by January 10, 2024 at 90%. A research report released by JPMorgan on Wednesday also indicated a spot bitcoin ETF approval is likely by that same date.\n\nThe eventual approval of a spot bitcoin ETF would be a major step toward the crypto asset's regulatory acceptance, making it easier for anyone to own the cryptocurrency and enabling more institutional money to enter the market. In a recent interview, Morgan Creek Capital CEO Mark Yusko indicated $300 billion could move into bitcoin following a spot ETF approval."

Other digital assets also pushed higher, including the XRP (XRP-USD) token issued by Ripple. Year to date, bitcoin has rallied more than 80%.\n\nThe rally punctuated the end of a volatile week for crypto investors, who found reasons to cheer a series of legal developments, market chatter, and rumors involving the SEC, which is attempting a widespread crackdown on the crypto industry. The regulator has sued a number of big players, including Coinbase (COIN) and Binance.\n\nThe seal of the Securities and Exchange Commission at SEC headquarters in Washington.

The SEC had denied the various applications, arguing the products were vulnerable to market manipulation.\n\n\"Once the SEC announced that they would not be pursuing an appeal, we saw a very compelling bid,\" Sean Farrell, a digital asset analyst with Fundstrat, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThen on Monday a rumor circulated that giant money manager BlackRock (BLK) had received new SEC approval for a spot bitcoin ETF, and that pushed bitcoin near $30,000. Prices pulled back when BlackRock denied it.\n\nThe SEC is still considering applications from BlackRock, Grayscale, and a number of other asset managers; investors expect the agency to rule on the applications by Jan. 10.\n\nStory continues\n\nBlackRock headquarters in Manhattan.

She later rejected an attempt by the SEC to appeal her split ruling.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s claims against Garlinghouse and Larsen over the sale of XRP to those investors were still scheduled to be tried before a jury, but the SEC said Thursday it no longer wanted to pursue those charges.\n\nThe SEC asked the court to give the agency three weeks to confer with Ripple in the hope of establishing a financial settlement tied to its sale of XRP to institutional investors.

Now, the massive lot is becoming a sprawling bitcoin mine.\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nSANDERSVILLE, Ga. \u2014 The newest mine in Sandersville has nothing to do with mining at all.\n\nIt's a bitcoin mine, and Sandersville leaders say it's making a major impact on the city's economy.\n\nLast year, 13WMAZ got a look inside the high-tech facility. Now, it's expanding, and our cameras once again got a tour.\n\nThe massive facility expansion has its own power substation just to help manage the 250-megawatt power output. That's 10 times what it takes to power the whole city. The city itself only uses 25 megawatts of power.\n\n\"There were some trees and a dirt field, and it's come a long way, and it's moving really quick,\" Site Manager Bo Ginn said.\n\nFast forward about two months and a sprawling tract of land is turning into a sprawling bitcoin mining facility.\n\n\"We're halfway, you know, up the hill here with six buildings coming up,\" Ginn said.\n\nEach building is as long as the Titanic.\n\nAll of them will eventually house hundreds of computers that crunch numbers all day to create bitcoin.\n\n\"Think of cash for a digital age. That's what bitcoin does,\" Chief Communications Officer at Cleanspark Isaac Holyoak said. \"Unlike some of these other digital currencies that have a CEO, there's no CEO of bitcoin.\"\n\nHolyoak says that's why the company's posted record profits. He says more people are buying in, and they need to meet the demand. So, they're expanding their Sandersville facility to become the company's flagship bitcoin mine.\n\n\"There is more energy in Georgia than there is use for that energy,\" Holyoak said.\n\nSandersville City Administrator Judy McCorkle says that creates an advantage for them. Since the city manages its own electric company, it reduces bills for everyone else.\n\nThat money flowing into the city's coffers can also help homeowners on their property tax bill.\n\n\"At some point, I could see that property tax bill being rolled back to almost nothing, almost 0%. That's huge for us,\" McCorkle said.\n\nGinn says those effects will be even stronger once they expand.\n\n\"We're sending over six figures back to the city each month, and that's going to be very significant post-expansion,\" Ginn said.\n\nHe estimates they'll pay $500,000 a month in taxes alone. That's about $6 million a year, all going to the city.\n\n\"That money is money that the city wouldn't be getting. It's going to schools, to roads, to other community infrastructure that may have been neglected for a while,\" Ginn said.\n\nMcCorkle says it's likely the city's property tax rate will eventually be as low as one mill. She says they're also considering building a hotel with the funds."

        "title": "Can Bitcoin Really Double in Price to $60,000 by the End of 2023? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ever since BlackRock (BLK -2.29%) announced its plans to apply for permission to create a spot Bitcoin (BTC -2.14%) exchange-traded fund (ETF) back in June, the crypto market has been buzzing about what this new fund's launch might mean for the price of Bitcoin. That buzz only intensified when six other financial institutions also announced plans to launch their own spot Bitcoin ETFs. The conventional wisdom is that the token could surge past the $30,000 level and begin another rally as new investor money floods into the crypto market.\n\nIn fact, a new report from blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant says that Bitcoin could soar above $50,000 and start to challenge its all-time high of $68,790. It even speculates about a price jump to as high as $73,000. That would imply an increase of close to $1 trillion in the market cap of Bitcoin. Given the huge numbers involved here, it's only natural to ask: Just how realistic is this scenario?\n\nKey assumptions\n\nA number of key assumptions underpin this pricing model. The most important of them is that the financial institutions creating these new spot Bitcoin ETF products will recommend to their clients that they allocate at least 1% of their portfolios to Bitcoin. This percentage will give you a good idea of how much new money could flood into the crypto market after the ETF approvals.\n\nCombined, the firms with pending ETF applications have $15.6 trillion in assets under management. Take 1% of that number and you arrive at a figure of $156 billion. This gives you a rough idea of how much money theoretically could immediately start to flow into Bitcoin.\n\nBut we're not done yet. You also have to assume that there will be a sort of multiplier effect. In essence, new money pursuing a limited supply of tokens will lead to higher prices, which will attract even more new money from investors, which will lead to even higher prices, which will attract even more new money.\n\nIf you take a look at past Bitcoin bull market cycles and analyze how its market capitalization has increased during those periods, it's possible to calculate that the multiplier effect applies at a ratio of between 3 and 6. By taking the base figure of $155 billion, and then using this multiplier to determine upper and lower bounds, the total market cap of Bitcoin could increase by anywhere from $465 billion to $930 billion.\n\nStress testing the numbers\n\nTo see if these numbers make sense, it's important to provide some perspective about the total size of the crypto market. Right now, the total market capitalization of Bitcoin is roughly $560 billion and the total market cap of the entire crypto market is just over $1 trillion, so it accounts for more than half of the total value of the crypto market. This value, known as the Bitcoin dominance factor, has oscillated between 0.40 and 0.55 over the past three years, and now stands at 0.52.\n\nThat's why I think the multiplier effect might be much lower than some people think. After all, by saying that Bitcoin will double in value, you are making another implicit assumption: that investors will be pouring money into other crypto assets as well, keeping the ratio between Bitcoin and other tokens at roughly the same level. Otherwise, the Bitcoin dominance factor will go completely off the charts.\n\nEven if you are a Bitcoin super-bull who thinks that it really should account for 95% of the entire crypto market (as it did back in 2017, before there were so many other tokens), there is another way to think about the numbers. If the market cap of Bitcoin really does increase by $1 trillion, that would make it a $1.55 trillion asset. Right now, there are only a handful of companies in the world worth more than $1 trillion. Thus, you would be saying that Bitcoin should be worth more than Amazon ($1.35 trillion), NVIDIA ($1.06 trillion), Meta ($820 billion), or Tesla ($725 billion). Just about the only companies that would be more valuable than Bitcoin would be Apple ($2.7 trillion) and Microsoft ($2.5 trillion).\n\nWhere will Bitcoin be in 2024?\n\nWhile I'm certainly bullish on the prospects of a new spot Bitcoin ETF, it's important to push back on some of the assumptions that underpin any Bitcoin pricing model. From my perspective, some of the assumptions used by those who conclude that these ETFs could lead to a doubling in the price of Bitcoin appear to be overly optimistic.\n\nMoreover, it's important to keep in mind that Bitcoin-linked investment products already exist. For example, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC -3.29%) currently has $17.6 billion in assets, and the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO -3.03%) has $1 billion in assets. So it's not like there aren't already ways to invest in Bitcoin beyond directly buying the tokens.\n\nThat said, I'm long-term bullish on Bitcoin. The flow of new institutional money should help to push up its price. And it should also help to make the crypto go even more mainstream. Anytime you have big Wall Street firms supporting Bitcoin, it helps to make it more attractive to all investors, which has the potential to send prices higher."

        "content": "Bitcoin extended its weekly gains on Friday, briefly topping $30,000 for the second time this week, as confidence a spot bitcoin ETF will soon be greenlit grew and crypto investors continued weighing uncertainty in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nThe price of the flagship cryptocurrency was last higher by 2.76% on Friday at $29,538.99, according to Coin Metrics. It ended the week with a 10.4% gain, making it its best week since June 23 when it added 17%. At one point, it climbed as high as $30,193.87. Ether added 2.46% to trade at $1,606.42 on the day and was up 4% for the week \u2014 best week since Sept. 29, when it gained 4.4%. On Friday, Ether rose to a high of $1,630.03.\n\nThe gains come even as the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield briefly topped 5% for the first time in 16 years. Higher yields historically have had a negative effect on bitcoin, but the crypto asset is benefiting from a key catalyst investors have been watching all year: the approval of what would be the first spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. Earlier this week, JPMorgan said the Securities and Exchange Commission is likely to approve an ETF in the next few months. Mike Novogratz, whose Galaxy Digital has an ETF application with the SEC in partnership with Invesco , told CNBC he thinks it could happen as soon as the end of the year."

        "content": "Between the bond market volatility, concerns about the Federal Reserve's rate path, and worries about a recession, some are turning to bitcoin (BTC-USD). Sean Farrell, VP of Digital Asset Strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors, tells Yahoo Finance Live that amid all those concerns, there are now \"very well-reputed financial professionals who don't normally wade into crypto waters saying that this digital bearer asset is a good alternative\" to things like a 30-year Treasury. It comes after BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said the recent rally in the digital currency reflects a \"flight to quality.\"\n\nClick here to watch the full interview on the Yahoo Finance YouTube page or you can watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live here.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nBRAD SMITH: We had actually discussed with Michael Sonnenshein, the Grayscale CEO, about what that crypto environment could look like after it looked like there was a clear pathway forward. And he said that they're expecting, or anticipating, an environment that we have not seen before, after that legal win took place. What could that look like from your purview, and what type of inflows do you think it could trigger for Bitcoin and other crypto-related assets?\n\nSEAN FARRELL: Yeah, look, I think-- that's a great question, and a great point by Michael. So assets trade based on who is trading them, right? And so historically, we've seen Bitcoin pretty closely correlated to tech stocks at times. At times, also very correlated, like this year, with gold. And a lot of that has to do with who is trading that asset.\n\nWhen there was-- we had the post-COVID monetary stimulus. All of the employees working from home and trading meme stocks. There was a lot of borrow, a lot of credit, in the crypto ecosystem. And so, what we saw is this incredible fervor rally that was largely correlated with unprofitable tech.\n\nBut now, I think people are seeing the volatility in the sell off in the bond market. They're seeing global calamity, a reducing of trust in and between different central banks. And that's reflected in sovereign debt prices.\n\nAnd you have very well-reputed financial professionals who don't normally wade into crypto waters, saying that this digital bearer asset is a good alternative for those who don't want to assume a 30-year bond in even a developed country. So I think you're going to see a new cohort of investors really seek Bitcoin in times of both increase in global liquidity to hedge against both asset and price inflation. And we'll also see it, as Larry puts it, a flight to quality."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBy 2140, 21 million Bitcoins will be mined, enhancing the network\u2019s scarcity and value.\n\nMiners\u2019 Bitcoin rewards decrease after every 210,000 blocks mined in an event called the Bitcoin halving and by 2140, miners will rely solely on transaction fees.\n\nMiners\u2019 motivation to secure the network is done to seek profit, support decentralization, and view mining as a long-term investment.\n\nTransaction fees, which currently account for about 5% of miner\u2019s revenue, may balance out the declining block rewards in the future, especially with off-chain solutions like the Lightning Network emerging.\n\nBitcoin mining was increasingly attractive due to the lucrative incentives for miners to maximize their Bitcoin yield. Starting at 50 Bitcoins every block back when it first launched, miners now earn 6.25 BTC for validating a block, a reward which has been halved thrice since Bitcoin\u2019s inception. There are currently over 19.5 million Bitcoins currently in circulation, leaving 1.5 million yet to be mined before hitting the 21 million cap by the year 2140.\n\nBitcoins finite supply is a defining part of Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s decentralized protocol. In an effort to engineer the cryptocurrency with a predetermined limit, Bitcoin boasts scarcity which increases Bitcoins demand and value over time.\n\nWhy Do Miners Participate In Bitcoin Mining?\n\nMiners decide to engage in the mining process for a variety of reasons, both financial and ideological. Here are the primary motivations:\n\nFinancial Incentive\n\nThe most obvious reason is the potential for profit. Miners receive block rewards every ten minutes at random and transaction fees from the blocks they successfully mine. Especially in the early days of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, many miners were attracted by the prospect of earning substantial rewards.\n\nSupporting Decentralization\n\nCryptocurrencies offer a decentralized alternative to traditional centralized financial systems. By participating in mining, individuals contribute to this decentralization, ensuring that the network remains resistant to censorship and external control.\n\nLong-term Investment Strategy\n\nBy mining and accumulating cryptocurrency, some miners view their activities as a long-term investment strategy, hoping that the coins they mine now will appreciate in value in the future. The below chart illustrates the hashrate that is currently securing the network.\n\nA high hashrate on the Bitcoin network signifies its strength and robustness, instilling trust among investors about the network\u2019s security.\n\nWhile there might be occasional dips in the hashrate due to various reasons, they often represent temporary shifts. For instance, when China implemented a ban on Bitcoin mining, in 2021, miners adapted by relocating their operations, showcasing the resilience and adaptability of the Bitcoin community. Such moments emphasize the dynamic nature of the network and its ability to overcome challenges.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin\u2019s Supply Incentive And Miner Revenue\n\nDuring bull markets as illustrated in the LookIntoBitcoin chart below, the rise in fees becomes a greater source of income for miners. This surge in fees corresponds with heightened Bitcoin demand, as newcomers engage in and conduct transactions on the network. Conversely, in bearish phases, fees as a portion of the total miner earnings tend to decline.\n\nOver time as off-chain solutions like the Lightning Network begin to offer swift, cost-effective Bitcoin transfers, the layer one blockchain will not be used as often.\n\nSome argue that the escalating transaction fees, which presently account for 5% of miners\u2019 revenue (illustrated above), will balance out the declining block rewards in the future.\n\nCan Bitcoin\u2019s Hardcap Of 21 Million Be Changed?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s hard cap of 21 million isn\u2019t explicitly stated in a single code line. The protocol behind the monetary policy of Bitcoin emerges from its initial block reward combined with the halving schedule. Initially, miners received 50 BTC for each block mined, and this reward halves every 210,000 blocks. By following this halving pattern, by the year 2140, over 99.99% of Bitcoins will be mined, and the reward will diminish to a point where it becomes negligible.\n\nWhen an individual sums up the rewards from each of these halving periods, the total converges to the 21 million BTC cap. The built-in halving mechanism in Bitcoin\u2019s code ensures that the minting of new Bitcoins will stop once this cap is reached. By 2140, miners will no longer earn block rewards, relying solely on transaction fees as compensation. This design guarantees that there will never exceed 21 million Bitcoins in circulation.\n\nWhat Happens When Bitcoin Mining Rewards Will Be Vanished?\n\nWhile the reward quantity has decreased over time, the soaring value of Bitcoin compensates for these reductions. Additionally, as Bitcoin becomes mainstream its transaction fees have also surged.\n\nBitcoin, often hailed as \u2018Digital Gold\u2019, possesses an intrinsic quality of scarcity with its fixed supply cap of 21 million coins. This design evokes an economic elegance, as it emulates the limited availability of precious resources in the universe. However, what unfolds when the last Bitcoin has been mined and miners can no longer receive block rewards? Why will miners continue to secure the network?\n\nHere are some key reasons miners will continue to mine:\n\nTransaction Fees\n\nAs miners pivot away from block rewards, the stakeholder who are deemed the lifeblood of the Bitcoin network, i.e. the miners will be incentivized primarily via transaction fees. This will ensure the network remains robust and continually processes transactions. It is expected that the transaction fee will be high enough in sats converted to the US dollar that the fee will be fair and justified.\n\nEconomic Renaissance\n\nBitcoin\u2019s finite nature might further solidify its role as a store of value. With no more inflow of new coins, scarcity could induce an appreciation in value, making it even more sought-after as a hedge against traditional fiat systems.\n\nMining Resilience\n\nAlthough mining rewards will cease, the expectation is that transaction volumes would have grown exponentially by then, making fee-based mining still profitable and sustainable.\n\nInnovation and Evolution\n\nThe crypto landscape is dynamic. It is likely that new layers or solutions are emerging to make the post-reward era more efficient and economical for all participants.\n\nThe Debate On Altering Bitcoin\u2019s Supply Cap\n\nTechnically, Bitcoin\u2019s supply cap can be modified by changing its foundational code. While Bitcoin operates on software, any modifications necessitate consensus from developers, stakeholders, and the broader community. Achieving such a consensus would mean all nodes on the Bitcoin network adopting the proposed amendments.\n\nEnsuring unanimous acceptance is challenging due to Bitcoin\u2019s inherent design to remain unchanged. Implementing these changes could lead to a hard fork. Which is a protocol change that redefines previously unauthorized actions as permissible. Ideally, all nodes would integrate the changes.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn contrast, a contentious scenario might emerge where only a subset supports the current 21 million BTC threshold. Miners and nodes resisting the modifications would persist with the existing Bitcoin protocol.\n\nThis divergence could instigate a competitive rift, resulting in a contentious hard fork and potentially spawning another Bitcoin variant, reminiscent of Bitcoin Cash\u2019s emergence. However, to date it is still unknown what will happen so far out in time.\n\nWhilst the future for Bitcoin is bright, it becomes difficult to forecast exactly what will happen to Bitcoin after all 21 million coins are in circulation.\n\nIt is anticipated that by then miners would be well established and fully prepared for the next century. Even if a vision for Bitcoin seems clear today, the actual outcome may prove different.\n\n\u201cBeing too far ahead of your time is indistinguishable from being wrong.\u201d \u2013 Howard Marks\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat happens to Bitcoin after all 21 million are mined?\n\nAfter all 21 million Bitcoins are mined by 2140, miners will no longer receive block rewards and will rely on transaction fees for compensation.\n\nWhy do miners participate in Bitcoin mining?\n\nMiners are motivated by profit from block rewards and transaction fees, supporting decentralization, and viewing mining as a long-term investment strategy.\n\nWhat\u2019s the incentive for miners when no more rewards are given?\n\nMiners will be incentivized through transaction fees, ensuring the Bitcoin network remains robust. The scarcity and potential value increase of Bitcoin might also motivate continued mining activity.\n\nWill the number of Bitcoins ever surpass 21 million?\n\nNo, the built-in protocol ensures the total Bitcoin supply will never exceed 21 million. Miners\u2019 rewards decrease over time and will eventually cease by 2140."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin and Other Major Cryptocurrencies Rallied This Week - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Major cryptocurrencies have soared over the past week, led by a 9% rise in the price of Bitcoin (BTC -2.14%). As of Friday's close, Bitcoin SV (BSV) -- a bitcoin fork token -- was up 61.6%, Stacks (SOL 6.20%) was up 27.7%, and Solana (STX -3.82%) had rallied 24.3% on the week, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nThe moves were spurred by increased optimism in recent days over impending improvals by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of new spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nOptimism building for the first spot bitcoin ETF approvals\n\nThe crypto rally this week was teed up by encouraging crypto headlines starting last Friday (Oct. 13, 2023). According to sources speaking to crypto news site CoinDesk, the SEC decided it would not appeal a federal court's August reversal of its decision preventing crypto-asset manager Grayscale from converting its widely popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC -3.29%) into an ETF. Assuming those sources are accurate, the court could finalize its decision as early as next week.\n\nBut this news is specific to bitcoin, so why is it good for cryptocurrencies in general? Because ETFs are a much more investor-friendly medium with shares that can be purchased throughout each trading day via any brokerage firm similar to individual publicly traded equity securities. Any approvals of a spot ETF that tracks the price of bitcoin would broaden investors' access to, and in turn, their acceptance of all crypto asset classes. As a result, it would almost certainly lead to hundreds of billions of dollars in additional liquidity flowing into cryptocurrencies' market capitalizations in short order. Looking further down the road, according to a report from data analytics firm CryptoQuant earlier this week, the value of the overall crypto market could grow by a total of more than $1 trillion after bitcoin ETFs are finally approved.\n\nWhat's next for Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nSure enough, multiple ETF providers filed amended registration statements for potential bitcoin ETFs this week, including Grayscale, Blackrock, and Fidelity, apparently in response to the SEC's decision not to appeal the federal court's aforementioned ruling.\n\nFurthermore, according to a research report released on Wednesday (Oct. 18, 2023) by JPMorgan, the timing of any approvals remains unclear but should happen within the next several weeks. At the very latest, the report adds, the first SEC approvals should arrive before Jan. 10, 2024 -- the final deadline by which the SEC is required to respond to ARK Invest's open application for its \"21Shares\" bitcoin ETF.\n\nFinally, the firm also speculated that rather than approve individual ETFs over the course of several months -- and noting its deadline to respond to BlackRock's application is March 15 of next year -- the SEC will likely approve multiple applications at once in order to prevent any single bitcoin ETF from gaining a so-called \"first-mover\" advantage.\n\nThat's fair enough and will also mean millions of retail investors will suddenly have access to several seamless avenues to diversify their portfolios into the budding cryptocurrency asset class. To be clear, that doesn't mean the rise in all cryptocurrencies will continue indefinitely over the long term. But because liquidity tends to be one of the primary drivers of the direction of any given market, this week's gains could be extended over the near term as optimism reaches a fever pitch surrounding the SEC's first spot bitcoin approvals in the coming months."

        "title": "4 Stocks to Watch as Bitcoin Makes a Solid Rebound - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is rebounding again after losing sheen somewhat over the past couple of months. The rally started on Oct 16 after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decided not to appeal its loss against Grayscale Investments in the D.C. Circuit court.\n\nThis rekindled optimism that the approval of a bitcoin ETF may be on the horizon. This sent Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE) and BNB (BNB) on a rally.\n\nBitcoin Rebounding Again\n\nThis week has particularly been good for Bitcoin. Following the SEC decision, Bitcoin\u2019s price surpassed the $28,000 mark and was trading above $28,500 on Oct 19. Apart from the SEC\u2019s decision in favor of Bitcoin, Members of Congress are working on new legislation to introduce stricter anti-money laundering regulations for cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis move comes in response to a Wall Street Journal report last week, following the surprise attack on Israel earlier this month. The report stated that Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad had received up to $134 million in cryptocurrencies since 2021.\n\nBitcoin made a solid turnaround this year after a dull 2022. The cryptocurrency was on a rally till July, when its price hit a 52-week-high of $31,500. However, the price has since fallen and hit a low of $24, 500 in late August and September.\n\nPrices of cryptocurrencies have since been rangebound, but a rebound started again last month after the Fed kept its benchmark policy rate unaltered in its September FOMC meeting to its current range of 5.25-5.25%.\n\nA higher market interest rate has a negative impact on high-growth sectors such as technology and cryptocurrencies. The Fed\u2019s monetary tightening campaign has also raised worries that the economy might slip into a recession.\n\nHowever, the Fed has hinted at going for one more 25-basis point hike this year before going for two rate cuts in 2024. Cryptocurrencies are making an attempt to recover from their recent lows, with investors expressing more positive sentiments. This renewed optimism follows the dovish comments from several Federal Reserve officials.\n\nStory continues\n\nStocks in Focus\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the value of the NVDA stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market. This is primarily due to the crucial role that GPUs play in data centers, artificial intelligence and mining or production of cryptocurrencies.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 221.6%.

        "title": "Chinese-owned crypto mines raise national security, grid concerns - Texas Standard",
        "content": "As bitcoin mining operations have sprawled across rural Texas and other remote parts of the country, questions have arisen about their impact on the power grid.\n\nBut a new concern is on the horizon as Chinese-owned companies, banned from mining crypto in their own country, have opened facilities in the U.S. The mines, which are warehouses full of powerful computers, have sometimes been located close to military bases or important infrastructure.\n\nGabriel J.X. Dance and Michael Forsythe have reported on Chinese crypto mine ownership for the New York Times. Dance says the web of companies and individuals who own crypto mines makes it unclear how closely connected the miners are to the Chinese government.\n\nListen to the interview above or read the transcript below.\n\nThis transcript has been edited lightly for clarity:\n\nTexas Standard: You found that a number of Chinese companies operate crypto mining operations in the U.S. I guess the question that everyone is asking is, are they connected with the Chinese government or the Chinese Communist Party? And is that the primary concern?\n\nGabriel Dance: Well, yes. What we have found is that not only are there a sprawling number of Bitcoin mines operated by Chinese nationals, but that several of them are directly connected to the government, as well as the different political agencies in China.\n\nBut I guess it would be difficult to ascertain which are connected and which aren\u2019t. You write that Chinese ownership is a bit of a web with multiple companies at the same address, folks involved in multiple companies and so on. What have you been able to determine?\n\nYou\u2019re right. It can be very difficult to determine. And I was very lucky to work with my colleague Michael Forsythe, who was based in China for several years and fluent in Chinese.\n\nAnd what we were able to determine is that several of these companies have direct ties back to whether it be directly with the Chinese government or associated with different political factions in China. Some of them are also just wealthy Chinese owners who are looking to make sure their currency exists outside of the reach of the authoritarian government.\n\nWhat\u2019s the nature of the national security threat? What are the implications? What would Bitcoin mines represent on that front?\n\nThe primary concern we found was specifically about one mine. This mine is located in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and it is directly adjacent to a Microsoft data center.\n\nAnd what we found is that Microsoft data center filed a report with the U.S. government over concerns that this Chinese Bitcoin mine was not only located very close to the Microsoft data center, which was performing support information for the Pentagon, but it was also about a mile away from an Air Force base. And that Air Force base controls nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n\nThe concerns from Microsoft was that the location could allow the Chinese to \u201cpursue full spectrum intelligence collection operations.\u201d So the idea is that it might be a Bitcoin mine that is situated less than a mile from the Air Force base, but it might be a cover, and that cover could facilitate anything from intelligence operations to different types of data processing, information and espionage.\n\n\u00bb GET MORE NEWS FROM AROUND THE STATE: Sign up for Texas Standard\u2019s weekly newsletters\n\nI mentioned that Bitcoin mines have sprouted up all across Texas. What did you learn about Chinese ownership of mines in Texas?\n\nSo there are many Chinese-owned Bitcoin mines in Texas, and several of them are very large. The two that we spoke directly to in the story are Bitdeer and Poolin. Now, Bitdeer is perhaps the largest mine operating in the United States right now \u2013 it\u2019s a little difficult to determine because they\u2019re not very forthcoming; most of these companies are not very forthcoming with how large they actually are.\n\nBut Bitdeer, which is situated in Rockdale, Texas, in an old smelting plant, consumes about the same amount of energy as over 300,000 U.S. homes. So it\u2019s a very large operation. The owner of Bitdeer, a man named Jihan Wu, was born in China, raised in China, started a very large Chinese Bitcoin mining machine company. And in 2019, that company, Bitmain, established this mine in Rockdale.\n\nIn 2021, there was a fight between the owners of Bitmain, and Jihan Wu splintered his company off into a company called Bitdeer, and that company continues to operate in Rockdale, Texas. Now, in the time since then, Mr. Wu has changed his country of residence to Singapore, which is not uncommon for Chinese nationals to do nowadays.\n\nIs there any way of knowing whether or not either of those mines pose any national security threat or are of interest to national security staffers?\n\nThere is concern, and the concern is not necessarily at a national security level, but it is at a Texas electrical grid level, which is to say: If these mines were to turn up or down this huge power consumption rapidly at certain periods of time, they could cause rolling brownouts and even blackouts.\n\nAnd if the Chinese mines were to \u2013 or any other mines were to \u2013 operate in conjunction with one another, they could bring down the entire Texas grid.\n\nIn fact, there\u2019s a 2021 Texas law that prevents foreign adversaries from running businesses involved in the state\u2019s infrastructure. In fact, China is actually named in that in that legislation. Is that affecting Chinese Bitcoin interests in the state? And if so, how?\n\nIt appears not to be as of yet. And that was one of the main questions that we are looking to answer with our article. What seems to be happening is these Bitcoin mines operate in a bit of a gray area, according to the national regulator of federal grid security.\n\nWhich is to say there\u2019s regulations that govern power generators and power transmission companies. But there\u2019s very little regulation on power users, even very large power users.\n\nAnd what the Bitcoin miners like to talk about is the benefit they bring, which is true. They are able to help grid operators balance the grid under periods of strain. But the flipside is also true, which is to say that if they were to operate in ways that are unhelpful to the grid, they could cause some pretty serious problems.\n\nDid you get the sense that a growing Chinese involvement in U.S. Bitcoin operations has actually had an impact on the thinking of regulators or government officials? What\u2019s happening in Wyoming?\n\nWell, in Wyoming, it\u2019s actually a bit of a point of controversy. What many of these small rural communities are doing are looking for industries and jobs. What they don\u2019t quite seem to understand until the Bitcoin mine comes there is that it brings very few jobs. And the main benefit is the sales tax: They\u2019re able to collect from the electricity sales, which is quite a bit.\n\nBut there is certainly concern at the national level and at different state levels about this problem. We spoke with a former assistant secretary for infrastructure protection at the Department of Homeland Security, and he said that there was an enormous amount of concern, particularly if the Chinese infrastructure impacts key energy systems.\n\nAnd so you mentioned the Lone Star Infrastructure Protection Act. Well, that act pretty clearly makes it illegal for Chinese-owned and operated companies, as well as some other foreign adversaries, to interconnect with the electrical grid.\n\nBut I believe that Attorney General [Ken] Paxton has ruled that while that does apply to generators \u2013 so you couldn\u2019t have a Chinese-owned wind farm, for example \u2013 I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s been specified whether it whether it applies to these large electricity users.\n\nYou write that there seems to be something of a conflict between the way that Texas government officials have embraced crypto mining and a desire to be tough on China. What sort of situation did you have in mind? Was there something specific?\n\nWell, the state has these very lucrative incentives for Bitcoin miners, which make it a very popular destination. And the company I was referring to earlier, Bitdeer, has been awarded nearly $50 million for participating in these programs that help balance the grid."

        "title": "Bitcoin price shrugs off bears, but mining stocks take a beating: Report - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Until Bitcoin (BTC) breaks its long-established $25,000\u2013$30,000 trading range, the crypto market is arguably in what some analysts have called a \u201ccrab market.\u201d It is likely that a decisive macroeconomic or crypto-specific catalyst will be necessary to break out of it. This failed to occur in the month of September.\n\nThe BTC price briefly tested the lower end of the established trading range and touched $25,200. In the second half of the month, however, the price recovered to $26,900 and posted a monthly close of +3.92%. This both bucked the historical trend of negative closes in September and went against traditional markets. The S&P 500 was down 5.4% over the same time frame.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin\u2019s relative resilience did not stabilize the industry as a whole. Crypto stocks were hit with an even bigger correction than the S&P, and altcoins continued their month-long losing streak against BTC. As every month, the Cointelegraph Research Investor Insights report provides an overview of industry-wide developments. It is an invaluable resource, especially in bear market conditions when many of the less mature sectors of the industry drop out of the news headlines.\n\nThe report is available for Pro subscribers on the Cointelegraph Research Terminal.\n\nMajor mining companies down 30%\n\nMost publicly traded crypto companies faced a challenging month in September, and their stocks underperformed. In many cases, share prices dropped between 10% and 40%, and the sector averaged a decline of 22.4%. Crypto mining stocks were hit especially hard.\n\nTeraWulf, Marathon Digital and Iris Energy all lost almost one-third of their valuation. The miners affected by these large corrections had rallied massively in the first half of the year, sometimes gaining +300%. However, share prices started to decline in July and have now mostly erased these previous gains. Some of the reasons for this correction are specific to the mining sector and are unlikely to affect crypto more widely.\n\nBitmain releases new Antminer iteration\n\nThe large corrections in the stocks of the mining stocks can, among other things, be attributed to a tightening of mining economics. In April 2024, the next Bitcoin halving event will occur, which will slash rewards for validating votes in half overnight. Despite this outlook, network hash rate and difficulty show no signs of slowing down and keep hitting all-time highs.\n\nThe result is that Bitcoin mining is becoming increasingly competitive by the day, and profit margins are becoming slimmer. Once mining companies exhaust their ability to raise new capital, they could be financially squeezed after the halving unless Bitcoin puts in a significant rally.\n\nIn September, Bitmain, the largest producer of ASIC mining hardware, announced a new model of Antminer rigs that will intensify this competition further in the coming months. The new S21 rigs will have a mining efficiency of 17.5 J/TH \u2014 a more than 20% increase compared to the previous front-runner. Miners who manage to raise the capital for an upgrade quickly will be able to price out their competition once the effects of the halving kick in.\n\nThe Cointelegraph Research team\n\nCointelegraph\u2019s Research department comprises some of the best talents in the blockchain industry.

        "title": "Is Bitcoin Eyeing Another Bull Run or Crypto Winter? - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "The world of cryptocurrencies has been a hotbed of speculation and anticipation, frequently characterized by extraordinary volatility. Investors and enthusiasts are constantly looking for hints and insights to estimate the future trajectory of the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin, the pioneer and flagship cryptocurrency. Everyone is wondering whether Bitcoin is on the verge of another bull run or if the crypto winter is just around the horizon.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin's Cycles\n\nThe history of Bitcoin is marked by periods of rapid price gains followed by large corrections. These cycles are frequently referred to as bull markets (periods of significant price growth) and bear markets (periods of significant price decline). Understanding these cycles is critical for judging the market's current state.\n\nBitcoin's last major bull run happened in late 2020 and early 2021. During this time, the price of Bitcoin skyrocketed to an all-time high of approximately $64,000 in April 2021. The excitement, however, was short-lived, as Bitcoin and the larger crypto market saw a steep fall, resulting in a bear market that lasted most of 2021.\n\nFactors Contributing to Speculation\n\nSeveral variables have contributed to the conjecture about Bitcoin's potential price movement:\n\nKeep Reading TradingView Enhances DeFi Tools on Polygon via QuickSwap Partnership\n\nInstitutional Adoption: Institutions and huge organizations have showed increasing interest in Bitcoin in recent years. Tesla and Square have made big Bitcoin investments, and traditional financial institutions have begun to offer cryptocurrency-related services to their consumers. Institutional adoption is seen favorably for Bitcoin's long-term prospects.\n\nMacroeconomic Environment: Bitcoin has been referred to as \"digital gold\" and an inflation hedge. Concerns about currency depreciation and inflation have intensified as governments around the world implemented large stimulus packages in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Some investors see Bitcoin as a potential safe haven against these economic risks.\n\nTechnological Advances: Ongoing developments in the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as the Taproot update and the Lightning Network enabling faster and cheaper transactions, have spurred confidence among the crypto community. These enhancements are intended to increase Bitcoin's utility and scalability.\n\nMarket Sentiment: Market sentiment influences crypto price changes significantly. Positive news, prominent endorsements, and social media talk can all lead to FOMO (fear of missing out) purchases, driving up prices. Negative news or regulatory changes, on the other hand, might cause selling and market downturns.\n\nRegulatory Uncertainty's Role\n\nRegulatory ambiguity is one of the crypto market's constant concerns. Governments and regulatory agencies all around the world are debating how to effectively control cryptocurrencies. This uncertainty has the potential to affect investor sentiment and market behavior.\n\nThere have been major regulatory developments in recent months, particularly in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States has postponed judgments on multiple Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications, citing concerns about market manipulation and investor protection. The outcome of these regulatory decisions could have a significant impact on the future of Bitcoin.\n\nRisk Management and Market Volatility\n\nInvestors must understand that the crypto sector, including Bitcoin, remains extremely volatile. While there is the potential for huge gains, there is also the danger of significant losses. The need of risk management and diversification in one's investment plan is highlighted by this volatility.\n\nWhen entering the cryptocurrency market, investors should examine their risk tolerance and investment horizon. Stop-loss orders, dollar-cost averaging, and maintaining a diverse portfolio can all assist to manage the inherent risks.\n\nThe Long-Term Prospects\n\nPredicting the future of Bitcoin, or any other asset, is a difficult task. The crypto market is influenced by a plethora of internal and external forces, and its dynamics can shift quickly.\n\nSome industry experts and analysts remain bullish about Bitcoin's long-term prospects, citing rising usage, expanded use cases, and improving technology. They anticipate that the price of Bitcoin will hit new highs in the next years.\n\nSkeptics, on the other hand, claim that Bitcoin's price is mostly driven by speculation and that its volatility makes it an untrustworthy store of value. They underline the possibility of regulatory obstacles as well as the prospect of a prolonged crypto winter.\n\nBlackRock and JPMorgan's Entry Could Propel Bitcoin to Massive Bull Run\n\nInstitutional involvement is reshaping the crypto landscape, with BlackRock and JPMorgan leading the charge. These financial titans, managing $8.5 trillion and $3.8 trillion, respectively, are laying the groundwork for the next Bitcoin bull run.\n\nBlackRock's pioneering move involved utilizing JPMorgan's blockchain collateral system. Moreover, BlackRock is considering launching a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), while JPMorgan displays optimism regarding Bitcoin mining's future.\n\nForbes even predicts that BlackRock and JPMorgan's involvement will ignite the upcoming bull run, driven by institutions pouring trillions into the crypto space, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Vanguard, and Grayscale.\n\nThis surge in institutional interest hints at the potential for substantial price momentum across various digital assets. Combined with the ongoing trend of long-term Bitcoin accumulation, market conditions seem primed for the next bull run.\n\nLong-term holders are already accumulating sizable amounts of Bitcoin each month, causing supply to diminish as demand soars.\n\nConclusion: The Uncertain Future\n\nThe crypto community and investors continue to debate Bitcoin's future as it sits at a crossroads. The history of bitcoin has proved that it is not immune to extreme price volatility and cycles.\n\nWhile Bitcoin's potential for another bull run remains a possibility, it is also critical to recognize the market's risks and uncertainties. Investors should proceed with prudence in the crypto realm, undertake extensive research, and remain cautious in risk management.\n\nUltimately, whether Bitcoin enters another bull run or experiences a crypto winter, its journey demonstrates the world of cryptocurrencies' ongoing fascination and inventiveness. The future remains unpredictable, but investors can use the lessons acquired from previous cycles to navigate the crypto landscape with caution and resilience."

        "content": "A Bitcoin \"original gangster\" who stole cryptocurrency from the original Silk Road a decade ago spent lavishly \u2014 but lived what sounds like a sad and lonely life before he was caught.\n\nAs CNBC reports, Bitcoin thief Jimmy Zhong not only helped write the original code of the cryptocurrency and early blockchain tech, but he also pilfered a bunch of it off the Silk Road in 2012, when its worth was a small fraction of what it became by the time he was busted in 2019.\n\nHe was also something of a rich nerd stereotype in Athens, Georgia, where he lived \u2014 a hard-partying local who dropped thousands to fly his friends cross-country on a private jet to attend a football game and had a stripper pole in his house \"for the girls,\" all of which masked how shallow those connections really were.\n\nZhong's fall from crypto grace began in March 2019, when he called the local police department in a panic because someone had stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of crypto from his house near the University of Georgia's campus \u2014 which is pretty ironic considering that the Bitcoin stolen from him was itself stolen.\n\n\"I\u2019m having a panic attack,\" the then-28-year-old computer scientist told the Athens-Clarke County Police dispatcher, per transcripts reviewed by CNBC.\n\nThough he tried to explain to the cops the significance of someone stealing 150 bitcoins from his house, calling it \"kind of an online thing,\" the local authorities were far out of their depth. To try to get to the bottom of the case, he hired Robin Martinelli, a private investigator in a nearby town.\n\nHerself far from a crypto expert, Martinelli said that as she learned more about bitcoin and about Zhong's case, she warmed to him \u2014 and felt the exact opposite way of the people he kept around him, whom she surveilled in attempts to see which of them had broken in and stolen whatever the crypto was physically stored on.\n\nZong's friends, Martinelli said, were \"very, very casual, plastic, not really caring, maybe using Jimmy a little bit.\" But he didn't respond well to her suspicions, seemingly clinging to the idea that his social circle was drawn by something other than a meal ticket.\n\n\"He would get upset,\" the PI said, \"when I would kind of mention somebody would had to have known where this cash was.\"\n\n\"Jimmy wanted to be loved,\" she added. \"Jimmy wanted friends.\"\n\nUltimately, that desire to be loved may have led to his downfall. As CNBC reports, that 2019 theft \u2014 which remains unsolved \u2014 brought government attention to Zhong, who, as it turns out, had been involved in the earliest days of crypto.\n\nBody camera footage reviewed by the news outlet showed how the young man's desire to be liked was turned against him when Zhong invited authorities into his house, where they were able to successfully ascertain that he had at least one Bitcoin wallet with tens of millions of dollars worth of crypto in it.\n\nThey then served him with a search warrant and tore his house apart until they found the computer that contained the rest of the 2012 Silk Road theft that netted Zhong 50,000 bitcoins, which ended up being worth a whopping $3 billion. It was the Justice Department's largest crypto seizure to date, and because nobody came forward to claim it, all of the proceeds went into government coffers.\n\nThough he was far from the first nerd to get rich and try to buy relationships \u2014 there was even an entire arc in \"30 Rock\" about such a man, the very year of the Silk Road theft \u2014 Zhong's painfully obvious loneliness adds a tragic new dimension to one the largest and earliest crypto crimes.\n\nNow 33, Zhong reported to a minimum-security federal prison camp in Alabama earlier this year and will only be there for 366 days, CNBC reports, which seems much more like a white-collar wrist slap than a book-throwing, and constitutes yet another all-too-familiar aspect of this saga.\n\nMore on crypto crime: You Have Got To See This Unhinged SBF Memo"

        "content": "Security researcher and developer Antoine Riard is stepping down from the Lightning Network\u2019s development team, citing security issues and fundamental challenges to the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nAccording to a thread on the Linux Foundation\u2019s public mailing list, Riard believes the Bitcoin community faces a \u201chard dilemma\u201d as a new class of replacement cycling attacks puts Lightning in a \u201cperilous position.\u201c\n\nHow does a lightning replacement cycling attack work?\n\n\n\nThere's a lot of discussion about this newly discovered vulnerability on the mailing lists, but the actual mechanism is a bit hard to follow.\n\n\n\nSo here's an illustrated primer...\n\n\n\n1/n pic.twitter.com/mvvS8bEc5f \u2014 mononaut (@mononautical) October 21, 2023\n\nThe Lightning Network is the second-layer solution built over the Bitcoin blockchain. It is designed to improve the scalability and efficiency of Bitcoin (BTC) transactions by enabling off-chain, peer-to-peer transactions.\n\nThrough the Lightning Network, users can open payment channels, conduct multiple transactions off-chain and settle the final result on the Bitcoin blockchain. The replacement cycling attack targets these payment channels. It is a new type of attack that allows the attacker to steal funds from a channel participant by exploiting inconsistencies between individual mempools. According to Riard:\n\n\u201cI think this new class of replacement cycling attacks puts lightning in a very perilous position, where only a sustainable fix can happen at the base-layer, e.g adding a memory-intensive history of all-seen transactions or some consensus upgrade. Deployed mitigations are worth something in face of simple attacks, though I don\u2019t think they\u2019re stopping advanced attackers as said in the first full disclosure mail.\u201c\n\nRiard also noted that addressing the new type of attack may require changes to the underlying Bitcoin network:\n\n\u201cThose types of changes are the ones necessitating the utmost transparency and buy-in of the community as a whole, as we\u2019re altering the full-nodes processing requirements or the security architecture of the decentralized bitcoin ecosystem in its integrality.\u201c\n\nLightning developers grapple with challenges, including criticisms surrounding the network\u2019s complexity and the demands placed on user experience. Since its inception in 2018, the layer-2 network has gained popularity, with a total value locked reaching $159.5 million at the time of writing, according to data from DefiLlama. However, this figure is still very modest when compared to Bitcoin\u2019s $587 billion market capitalization.\n\nRiard plans to focus now on Bitcoin core development, but warned about upcoming challenges for the major cryptocurrency ecosystem:\n\n\u201cOn the other hand fully explaining why such changes would be warranted for the sake of lightning and for designing them well, we might need to lay out in complete state practical and critical attacks on a ~5 355 public BTC ecosystem. Hard dilemma. There might be a lesson in terms of bitcoin protocol deployment [...]\u201d\n\nMagazine: Recursive inscriptions \u2014 Bitcoin \u2018supercomputer\u2019 and BTC DeFi coming soon"

        "title": "4 Ways To Implement Bitcoin Governance Strategies - Ledger",
        "content": "\n\nThings to know:\n\n\n\n\u2013 Your Ledger devices are extremely useful for letting users self-custody their Bitcoin. But what if you\u2019re an organization, or a financial institution?\n\n\n\n\u2013 Multiple solutions exist to implement Bitcoin Governance with complex rules. Among them are Miniscript, Multi-Party Computation (MPC), as well as MuSig2 and FROST. Our Ledger devices already support Miniscript, and I\u2019m glad to announce that we will support MuSig2 in the coming months.\n\n\n\n\u2013 We have also developed the Ledger Vault to empower organizations and financial institutions to efficiently manage Bitcoin and other crypto assets.\n\n\n\n\u2013 This solution leverages Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) and Personal Security Devices (PSDs). We have loaded the Ledger Operating System with its security property, isolation, and cryptographic implementation on the secure hardware and a governance framework.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a friend introduced me to the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2011, I decided to study this protocol\u2019s cryptography, technology, double-spending problem, and decentralized consensus. I returned to my friend and told him: \u201cYour Bitcoin thing is pretty interesting, but frankly, I don\u2019t understand the use case!\u201d When I joined Ledger in 2017, he made fun of me: \u201cDo you finally get it?\u201d he said. Yes, I finally got it.\n\nBitcoin is revolutionary because it brings something unprecedented: \u201cPermissionless Money\u201d. With Bitcoin, you don\u2019t need to ask anyone to own and spend your digital value. No state, bank, or third-party can ever interfere with the value you hold and transact. With Bitcoin, you possess a piece of the Internet with complete self-sovereignty and freedom.\n\nTwo properties enabling permissionlessness: \u201cdecentralized consensus\u201d & \u201cself-custody\u201d\n\nThe first property that contributes to Bitcoin\u2019s permissionless nature is known as \u201cdecentralized consensus\u201d. With Bitcoin, you have decentralized pools of miners that are incentivized to secure the network and prevent censorship over the execution of transactions. Simply put, when you want to make a transaction, no one can prevent you from making it.\n\nThe second property is self-custody. With self-custody, you own your value, and no one can prevent you from owning it, which allows you to control your crypto-assets fully. In order to own Bitcoin, you simply have to generate a public (which is essentially your address) and a private key (your key to prove ownership over your assets). If you lose your private key, you lose your assets, and if an attacker accesses your private key, he will be able to make a transaction\u2026 and there\u2019s nothing you can do to revert it.\n\nThis need to protect your private keys from hackers is why we\u2019ve built our Ledger Nano devices. This hardware embeds a secure element, where your secrets are generated within the enclave, and the cryptography is implemented within it so that your secrets don\u2019t have to leave the enclave. Your device also features a trusted display, allowing you to understand the transaction you are about to consent to signing.\n\nAll of the elements I\u2019ve explained above are pretty simple, but mostly apply to individuals. What does it mean when you are a group of people, an organization, or a financial institution?\n\nLeveraging Bitcoin at the institutional level\n\nYou may not want to store your assets on a Ledger Nano when you are an exchange (some did it at the expense of their customers, including FTX and QuadrigaCX). These devices are perfectly secure; you could keep billions on them, but you want to avoid the operational risk of having a single person from your organization fully controlling all the customers\u2019 funds.\n\nWho has access to the coin if organization X decides to buy $100 Million worth of bitcoin? Who can rule whether they use it this way or that way? These are crucial questions, so let\u2019s consider what kind of governance we can have over Bitcoin.\n\nThe initial and onchain option: MultiSig on Bitcoin\n\nIt used to be Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT). This is not very well known, but you have a scripting language called Script on Bitcoin. With this scripting language, you can define an account with different rules enforced on-chain. So, you can create a rule saying: \u2018I can spend X amount of Bitcoin when I have these signatures.\u2019 Then, the blockchain verifies that these free signatures happen.\n\nScript is great, but the Script language can be cumbersome to verify. That\u2019s why Miniscript was created in 2019. Miniscript is a language for representing Bitcoin Scripts in a structured way, enabling efficient analysis, composition, generic signing, and more. For instance, \u201cAlice can spend (main path), or a 3-of-3 of Bob, Carol, and Dave can spend, but after three months, two signatures are enough (secondary spending path).\u201d\n\nOur hardware wallet devices have supported both PSBT and Miniscript on SegWit for over a year and Miniscript on Taproot will be supported in the next release. You can leverage all the security properties of Ledger devices and an onchain governance over Bitcoin accounts. You can even leverage miniscript with Ledger in order to further minimize trust.\n\nMulti-Party Computation (MPC) solutions\n\nMPC stands for secure Multi-Party Computation. That\u2019s a wide field of cryptography that consists in doing computation in a distributed manner, such as, for example, jointly computing signatures. In particular, in a t-of-n threshold signature scheme, the signing key is distributed in n shares and a subset of t shares is required to compute a valid signature (where typically n=3 and t=2). From a blockchain standpoint, the resulting signature looks like a standard \u201csingle-party\u201d signature.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty elegant, but there are a few drawbacks to the currently implemented solutions.\n\nThe first drawback is address management. Existing threshold signature schemes are not compatible with BIP32, meaning it is not possible to have HD (hierarchical deterministic) wallets as with a standard seed. Additionally, due to the specific nature of MPC-based wallet, recovering your wallet on a standard BIP39 wallet could be impossible, which is a limitation to self sovereignty.\n\nThe second drawback is that current secure hardware does not support MPC today. That means that the cryptography of MPC protocols must be implemented in software, which is not a good practice. I often hear some dismissive marketing saying that as it\u2019s MPC, there is no secret. This is not true. You still have secret key shards, and you need to secure them.\n\nThe third drawback is that currently available MPC protocols rely on ECDSA, the original signature scheme used in Bitcoin, resulting in complex and hard to implement schemes, as testified by the multiple vulnerabilities found in existing MPC wallets.\n\nMuSig2 and FROST\n\nThe good news is: Schnorr signatures have been standardized on Bitcoin around three years ago with the Taproot upgrade. The Schnorr signature scheme is really better than ECDSA for various reasons. First, it has better security guarantees than ECDSA which is not provably secure, and second, its algebraic structure is much simpler than ECDSA, which means that MPC protocols for Schnorr are much easier to design.\n\nIt\u2019s been standardized on Bitcoin with these two papers. The first one is MuSig2, allowing multi-signature (i.e., n-of-n threshold signatures), and the second one is FROST, enabling you to do arbitrary t-of-n threshold signatures.\n\nAt Ledger, we are already supporting Schnorr on our devices and working on supporting MuSig2, allowing multi-signatures on-chain on Bitcoin, in the coming months.\n\nLedger Enterprise for Tailored Institutional Governance\n\nWhile perhaps not as widely well known as Ledger\u2019s retail solutions, we have developed a suite of products designed to empower enterprises, organizations, and financial institutions in the secure and efficient management of digital assets at scale. This innovative solution leverages Ledger\u2019s robust technology and secure hardware along with a flexible governance framework on top of it.\n\nThe solution is called Ledger Vault. It leverages Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) and Personal Security Devices (PSDs). We have loaded the Ledger Operating System with its security property, isolation, and cryptographic implementation on the secure hardware, and on top of this, a governance framework.\n\nWith Ledger Vault, you can achieve the same level of security and self-custody as Ledger Nanos, but with the valuable addition of a governance layer allowing corporations to establish various organizational roles, including shared owners, administrators, and operators.\n\nDepending on these roles, you can define rules and policies to regulate access and transactions. For example, it permits you to grant a specific group access to a set of accounts and restrict them to transactions to particular addresses. If a group intends to execute a transaction exceeding a certain threshold, it requires the consensus of three out of five approvals.\n\nThe governance can also be based on KYC/AML checks and connected to other actors like exchanges through our product TRADELINK, further enhancing its adaptability and compliance capabilities.\n\nLedger Vault offers this high level of flexibility within a secure framework, and is specifically designed to cater to the self-custody governance needs of institutional users. Its universality across different blockchains makes it a standout solution in the digital asset management space, ensuring it meets the diverse needs of users across the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nAs I\u2019ve outlined above, Bitcoin is game-changing because it brings permissionless money, something enabled by two key concepts: decentralized consensus and self-custody. Self-custody is more complex when it comes to organizations, and my conviction is that self-custody is fully compatible with companies if you have some predetermined levels of governance over the tokens.\n\nThen, you have different possibilities. Some are on-chain, others are off-chain, but you can also consider a mix of them. At Ledger, we are supporting PSBT and Miniscript on Ledger Nano devices. We are also working on implementing MuSig2, which is coming soon.

Governance includes who can access and who can spend the digital assets. It\u2019s also about determining thresholds, maintaining whitelists, etc. Then you also have to think about security: where the essential materials are stored, how they are secured, how the cryptography is implemented. You must also strongly consider control, which means: who has access to the shards? This becomes particularly critical in a multisig setup that depends on a third party you don\u2019t particularly trust. Finally, backup and interoperability are essential aspects. Having a backup and testing it is something you need to consider. Interoperability is significant, too. If your provider disappears, you need to keep control over your wallet."

However, The state of New York has filed a lawsuit against Digital Currency Group, and its subsidiary Genesis Global Capital along iwht crypto exchange Gemini alleging fraud to the tune of more than $1 billion.\n\n\n\nAfter a short-lived profit booking, Bitcoin was back in green on Friday as the last crypto token surged more than 3 per cent to regain the 29,000-levels. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, also rose more than 2 per cent but remained below $1,600-level. Majority of altcoins were trading higher in the early morning.\n\n\n\nThe crypto market narrative is seemingly shifting more towards the increasing Bitcoin dominance.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIt was a good week for holders of virtually all leading cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Solana, and XRP.\n\nAfter many weeks of inertia and slow movement, Bitcoin (BTC) finally rebounded with some bullish price action, adding 10% over the last seven days to change hands at $29,523 as of this writing. The rest of the market rebounded with it.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rally began on Monday, following last Friday\u2019s news that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission would not be appealing a court verdict that labeled the regulator\u2019s rejection of crypto asset manager Grayscale\u2019s ETF application \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe world\u2019s favorite cryptocurrency also received another boost\u2014of around 10%\u2014on Monday when Cointelegraph tweeted fake news that Wall Street titan Blackrock had been approved to launch a U.S. Bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink responded to the price pump that day, saying during an appearance on FOX Business: \u201cIt\u2019s just an example of the pent-up interest in crypto. I think the rally today is about a flight to quality.\u201d A marked change of tune from 2017 when Fink called Bitcoin an \u201cindex of money laundering.\u201d\n\nLater in the week, BlackRock submitted an amended prospectus for its ETF application. Changes to its filing include acknowledgment of competition in the race for ETF approval and detailed explanations on the product\u2019s pricing and reporting mechanisms. On a related note, a report released by JP Morgan that day (Wednesday) called it \u201cmost likely\u201d that a spot Bitcoin ETF could get approved before January 10.\n\nBy Friday, the news had pushed Bitcoin\u2019s price to briefly reclaim $30k, a level not seen since summer, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThe wider market: Solana, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash\n\nWhile Bitcoin generally acts as the industry\u2019s pace-setter (typically when BTC rises, other coins and tokens rise with it), this week, the market leader\u2019s gains were far outpaced by some of its rivals.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nClosest contender Ethereum (ETH) didn\u2019t manage to catch up with it this week. Ethereum rose 3.4% to enter the weekend trading at $1.602.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP blew up this week, but not quite as much as Bitcoin. XRP grew 6.7% to $0.515669 off the back of news that the SEC had voluntarily dismissed charges against Ripple execs, CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Executive Chairman Chris Larsen. The SEC sued them alongside the company in December 2020 for allegedly violating securities laws with sales of XRP.\n\nThe biggest rallies this week came from two altcoins: Solana (SOL) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Bitcoin Cash blew up 11.6% and currently trades at $239.40, while Solana mushroomed a staggering 25% to hit $26.89 at the time of writing.\n\nSOL\u2019s impressive rally appears to have been spurred by news that the FTX estate has decided to stake roughly $122 million in Solana held in the bankrupt exchange's crypto wallets rather than liquidate it.\n\nFinally, there were no significant losses among the top thirty cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The only red candle this week was from Cosmos Hub\u2019s ATOM, which fell 3.8% to $6.36.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

Doing too much could also do unnecessary harm to the economy,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cGiven the uncertainties and risks, and how far we have come, the Committee is proceeding carefully.\u201d\n\nData from CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool showed changing tides among market expectations when it comes to future rate decisions.\n\nAt its next meeting on Nov. 1, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is now unanimously thought to hold rates at their current levels, per data from CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool.

        "content": "For Bitcoin to beat the resistance around $30,000, the volume around the previous buying pressure needs to be higher.\n\nBTC accumulation is increasing and could be followed by a rise in volatility.\n\nAfter blasting past $29,000, optimism in the market has started to rise again, with many opining that Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] journey to $30,000 was a question of when not if. However, according to IntoTheBlock\u2019s data, it may not be an easy ride to the said price. This is because of a potential resistance around the $30,000 mark.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the BTC Profit Calculator\n\nBitcoin is in a critical position\n\nIn spite of the fact that 73% of Bitcoin holders were now in profit, the blockchain insight platform noted that the resistance may occur because of the over 1.4 million addresses that accumulated in the region.\n\nAs Bitcoin is inching closer to $30k, we find that the most significant potential resistance is also around that $30k mark, where 1.49M addresses acquired Bitcoin. At the same time, 73% of Bitcoin addresses are currently in profit. This level has proven to be a significant\u2026 pic.twitter.com/OymqUOQ4Hw \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) October 20, 2023\n\nOne reason why this region was also important was due to the historical demand BTC had at this level. For instance, institutional investors like Michael Saylor\u2019s Microstrategy, and Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla purchased high volumes of BTC around these prices.\n\nIt was also the same case with a number of retail participants. Therefore, it is likely that some market players might try to break even at these points. This could, in turn, draw back the upward movement experienced lately.\n\nA smooth sail may be coming\n\nTo avoid such an occurrence, a lot of accumulation has to take place, and it may need to be more than 496 BTC stockpiled previously at the $29,796 to $30,673 region. Well, data from Glasssnode showed that Bitcoin\u2019s accumulation trend score was 0.72 at press time.\n\nAs a value ranging from zero to one, the accumulation trend score is an indicator that reflects the relative size of entities that are actively accumulating coins on-chain in terms of their BTC holdings.\n\nWhenever the value of the metric is closer to zero, it means that the market is in distribution mode. Thus, the value mentioned above means that there has been more accumulation than distribution.\n\nHence, the chances of Bitcoin hitting $30,000 is much higher than a fall below $29,000.\n\nAs Bitcoin tries to move higher than the price at press time, it is also likely to see a surge in volatility. This was the opinion of Korean on-chain analyst Mignolet. Mignolet, who made his opinion known on CryptoQuant, noted that 3-6 months Spent Output Age Bands (SOAB) was proof of the hike in price fluctuations.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nThe SOAB is a bundle of all spent outputs that were created within a specified age band. The metric is responsible for revealing the behavior of holders in a certain market atmosphere. Regarding the recent movement, the analyst explained that,"

The firm also filed for a bitcoin spot ETF in the U.S., making it one of a number of firms, like BlackRock, whose applications are pending after the SEC delayed its decisions.\n\n\u201cFrankly, having more filers at once is what\u2019s best if you\u2019re going to approve a product; that\u2019s what\u2019s best for investors because then they have a wide array of choices,\u201d Dowling said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to approve it, line us up all at once, so that the investor has the best opportunity to survey the offerings and go with what they think best fits their profile.\u201d\n\nSEC oversteps\n\nIn past career roles, Dowling worked very closely with the SEC as a federal prosecutor for 11 years and as assistant U.S. attorney, with her last government gig in the economic crimes unit of the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Northern District of California.\n\nBut there\u2019s a question of what the current mission for the agency is in regards to the sector, as it differs from one administration to another. \u201cThere\u2019s a divergence between what the staff is trying to do and get right versus what they\u2019re being guided to work on and how to do that,\u201d Dowling said. \u201cThe SEC has been very active in a number of areas, not just within crypto . . . [but] I do think there\u2019s been some big oversteps with the current SEC.\u201d\n\nDowling said the SEC can\u2019t overstep its jurisdiction and try to \u201cgrab areas that maybe shouldn\u2019t be within their purview.\u201d\n\nShe thinks that the collapse of FTX has had an impact on regulators\u2019 view on the crypto industry. \u201cWe were on a good pace to get toward some more regulatory clarity,\u201d but the downfall of the crypto exchange took the industry \u201cmany steps back,\u201d Dowling said.\n\nWithout the FTX collapse, she believes that there would have already been legislation around the industry in regards to subsectors like bitcoin spot ETFs and stablecoins. Even though FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s trial is ongoing, Dowling thinks the FTX debacle won\u2019t affect future regulators\u2019 or legislators\u2019 decisions as much given that \u201cthe big bombs have already exploded and that\u2019s already baked in.\u201d\n\nEven though the industry has been slowly moving toward regulation, the future looks bright. Dowling still holds hope that the crypto industry \u2014 and those advocating for it \u2014 are \u201cpushing in the right direction.\u201d\n\nThis story was inspired by an episode of TechCrunch\u2019s podcast Chain Reaction.

        "title": "Google Data Shows Growing Interest in Spot Bitcoin ETF - Crypto Times",
        "content": "According to data from Google Trends, the global search interest for the term \u201cspot bitcoin ETF\u201d is expected to reach its highest point, indicating a surge in public curiosity.\n\nThe value for \u201cbitcoin ETF\u201d has also risen to 39, the highest it has been since the launch of ProShares\u2019 futures-based ETF two years ago, when it also reached a peak of 100 in search interest.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF Trend\n\nPeople in the market believe that the U.S. SEC, which recently didn\u2019t meet a deadline for a significant legal challenge, will likely give the green light to a spot ETF in the early part of next year. This approval is expected to bring a substantial increase in available funds and trading activity.\n\nThe idea of getting approval for a Bitcoin (BTC) Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) has been a consistent topic of discussion in the cryptocurrency industry. Many people view it as a way to measure how widely accepted BTC is becoming in mainstream finance.\n\nGoogle Trends provides mostly unfiltered samples of search requests made on Google and ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 indicating the highest level of interest at a given time. In the past, when Bitcoin and Solana (SOL) reached a score of 100 on Google Trends, it often coincided with the peak of their price increases during bull markets.\n\nA spot ETF follows the real-time price of Bitcoin and doesn\u2019t involve trading in Bitcoin futures. Instead, the ETF provider buys and holds actual Bitcoins. This is a good option for people who want to invest in Bitcoin without needing to personally own the cryptocurrency."
