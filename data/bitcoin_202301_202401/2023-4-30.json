        "title": "Invest in Bitcoin? I'm a Bitcoin Loser and I Won't Be Going Near It Again - Kiplinger's Personal Finance",
        "content": "Should you invest in Bitcoin is a common question posed by many who have witnessed the cryptocurrency\u2019s rollercoaster ride over recent years.\n\nEach Bitcoin is now worth about $30,000 after a year of gains for the cryptocurrency, but the last five years have seen it swing from $3,000 to $65,000, which shows the seesaw it\u2019s been on. That has led not just to a surge in Bitcoin investing but also in Bitcoin mining .\n\nI have tried my luck at it, albeit with rather small sums compared to some, but it taught me that seeing it as an investment is the wrong course of action for most. Unless you really, really know what you are doing, then it\u2019s a gamble, akin to playing the tables in Vegas.\n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance Be a smarter, better informed investor.

Sign up\n\nThat means it really should be viewed as something only to dabble in if you can afford to lose that cash, so something to have fun with rather than truly invest in. That\u2019s my view, and you may disagree, but here\u2019s why I think so.\n\nWhy Bitcoin is closer to gambling than investing\n\nWhen you invest in the stock market or in commodities you can at least do some research to help inform your decision. How has this fund manager performed? What is this company\u2019s growth plans? Or, what do experts think will happen to the price of gold?\n\nThese are all questions you can answer using research to help inform you of potential outcomes. You can also get financial advice from experts who know the markets and the system.\n\nOf course, most investors know that there is always the risk of their investment tanking due to big world events such as COVID-19, or due to more localized or company-specific issues.\n\nYet few stocks or commodities have experienced the white-knuckle ride of Bitcoin, and that propensity for it to move suddenly, sometimes seemingly with no warning, is why it is so much harder to predict, and why it is closer to gambling than investing in my view.\n\nOne reason Bitcoin is hard to predict is because the mechanics behind it are so complex that most people don\u2019t understand them and therefore don\u2019t have the same knowledge they have of more traditional investments.\n\nI suspect die-hard crypto experts who do nothing but study Bitcoin and other similar currencies such as Ethereum will disagree with me, but this article isn\u2019t aimed at them, but at the less-well-informed majority.\n\nMy Bitcoin loss\n\nA few years ago when everyone seemed to be talking Bitcoin up during one of its highs, I bought $300 of it. I saw it rise to about $500, then drop suddenly, only to go back up again.\n\nAfter a few months later, I withdrew it all at a loss of $50. I could swallow a $50 hit and I saw the experience as a bit of fun to see what would happen to the $300.\n\nThe problem is, I had no idea why it was going up or down and saw no way to even remotely forecast which way it would go. I didn\u2019t like the feeling that I had no control at all.\n\nDon\u2019t get into Bitcoin unless you understand the risks\n\nBitcoin is having a good 2023, with its value up 75% year-to-date. That may encourage some people to try their luck.\n\nI say go for it if you want to have some fun, but only with money you can afford to lose, unless you really consider yourself a cryptocurrency expert.\n\nBut please beware the many companies out there trying to sell you a Bitcoin \u201cinvestment\u201d as a sure-fire way to make money. You may get lucky but you may as easily get burnt.\n\nWhether you agree or disagree, feel free to tweet me @guyanker."

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies took a dip on Monday to start the week and new month as investors bet the takeover of First Republic Bank could put an end to the financial crisis, which has been the biggest driver of this year's bitcoin rally.\n\nBitcoin fell about 4.2% to 28,137.76 to start the week and new month, according to Coin Metrics. Ether lost 4% to 1,828.81.\n\nOn Monday regulators took possession of First Republic, making it the third U.S. bank failure this year and the biggest one since the 2008 financial crisis. JPMorgan Chase will acquire most of its deposits and assets.\n\nLast week, the price of bitcoin rallied in the final week of April as troubles at the bank unfolded. Trading of the cryptocurrency has been choppy, however, as investors straddle the effects of the banking crisis on crypto with high inflation, Federal Reserve policy, a potential recession and an increasingly bearish narrative building around the U.S. dollar.\n\n\"It's unclear whether the banking crisis narrative can continue to be a boon for bitcoin,\" said Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy. \"Overall, the market lacks clear positive near-term catalysts, with supply issues overhanging bitcoin \u2026 That being said, bitcoin accumulation by small addresses is outpacing issuance, and we expect Ethereum staking to increase, each of which provides a supportive supply narrative.\"\n\n\"Outside of crypto-native factors, we expect a back-of-the-year macro environment to be characterized by tightening, recession, and an expanding multipolarity in the global economy, all of which can be supportive of gold and bitcoin,\" he added.\n\nInvestors have been expecting a slowdown from bitcoin's first-quarter rally, although cryptocurrency remains on its upward trend and has gained about 70% for the year, after finishing down more than 60%. April marked the first time in two years that bitcoin notched a fourth consecutive positive month.\n\n\"Bitcoin and ether started 2023 inorganically cheap, allowing for plenty of room to move higher off a low-base effect,\" Thorn said. \"A widening banking crisis became evident in March and the contrast with Bitcoin's transparent and decentralized nature provided a further leg up for bitcoin, while Ethereum's successful Shanghai upgrade provided a catalyst for ethereum.\""

        "content": "Bhutan is bullish on Bitcoin (BTC). Following the revelation that the small Himalayan kingdom has been quietly accumulating crypto, the country is also mining Bitcoin. Moreover, the country of less than 800,000 people leverages green energy to power its Bitcoin mining operations.\n\nKnown for its focus on \u201cGross National Happiness\u201d and picturesque landscapes, Bhutan has found ways to harness its immense hydroelectric potential, which accounts for 30% of its gross domestic product.\n\nFirst reported in an expos\u00e9 in local Bhutanese news and followed by inquiries from Forbes, Bhutanese officials confirmed that mining began when the price of Bitcoin was around $5,000 in April 2019. The price per Bitcoin has since soared to roughly $28,000 per coin at the time of writing.\n\nThe kingdom has reportedly explored partnerships to expand its mining operations further. Notably, it is negotiating with Nasdaq-listed mining company Bitdeer to secure 100 megawatts of power for a Bitcoin mining data center in Bhutan. This partnership would increase Bitdeer\u2019s mining capacity by about 12%.\n\nThe scale of Bhutan\u2019s mining operations remains a mystery, with little information available about the location, size and profitability of its mining farms. Some Druk Holding and Investments (DHI) employees have listed \u201ccrypto mining\u201d as their tasks and skills on their LinkedIn profiles.\n\nIt is also unclear why the government chose not to disclose this project to its citizens or international partners. However, it is known that the state-owned holding company DHI has invested millions of dollars in cryptocurrency holdings, with the funds managed on behalf of its people.\n\nAlthough mainstream media would indicate the contrary, Bitcoin mining is the world\u2019s cleanest industry, with more than 50% of its energy sources being renewable or clean energy. Bitcoin mining advocates, such as MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor, explain that \u201c99.92% of carbon emissions in the world are due to industrial uses of energy other than Bitcoin mining.\u201c Due to cheap, abundant hydroelectric power, DHI reported that Bhutan is an ideal destination for mining Bitcoin.\n\nRelated: How Bitcoin mining saved Africa's oldest national park from bankruptcy\n\nBhutan adds to a long list of regions from East Africa to Scandinavia mining Bitcoin with hydropower, one of the cheapest clean energy sources.\n\nCointelegraph reached out to Druk Holding and Investments and will update the article when a comment is received.\n\nCointelegraph Magazine: Bitcoin in Senegal: Why is this African country using BTC?"

        "title": "Are Stocks, Bonds, Bitcoin, or Your Humble Home the Best Investment Today? - Realtor.com News",
        "content": "In these financially fraught times, just about everyone is struggling to figure out the best way to keep their money safe\u2014and, more importantly, to make it grow. Are homebuying and selling the best investments you can make? Does it make sense to stash as much cash as you can into the stock market? Is it a bad time to flip a home, or a good one? And why are financial gurus suddenly so gung-ho on CDs?\n\nThat\u2019s an awful lot for the average investor to consider. That\u2019s why Realtor.com\u00ae wanted to see just how the American dream of homeownership compared with other common investments. So we took a look at nine real estate and other financial investments to see how they have performed over the past five years.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s hiking of interest rates, to tame inflation, has changed the financial landscape dramatically. As a result of the Fed increases, the housing market has been upended by higher mortgage interest rates and there have been several prominent bank failures, including First Republic Bank. The stock market has had some big swings, while other more overlooked investments like money market funds, certificates of deposit, and even humble savings accounts have suddenly become sought-after, more profitable places to stash some cash.\n\nUnfortunately, the landscape has shifted enough that past returns might no longer be a good predictor of future profits. These investments are highly sensitive to what the Fed does with rates, so their profitability might hinge largely on whether interest rates rise or fall.\n\n\u201cEach investment has its own unique risks, potential rewards, and barriers to entry,\u201d says Anna Sergunina, president and CEO of MainStreet Financial Planning. \u201cHomeownership and flipping require significant capital and expertise, while stocks, REITs, and bitcoin can be more volatile. Bonds, CDs, and money market accounts offer lower risk, but potentially lower returns.\u201d\n\nNo matter what\u2019s going on in the financial markets, most planners recommend folks spread their money around in different investments. This protects them so that if the stock market is down, their bond investments are still strong, or vice versa.\n\nWatch: Mortgage Rates Are a \u2018Wild Card\u2019 for Both Homebuyers and Sellers: April 2023 Real Estate and Economy Update\n\nFinancial experts also caution against investing just for the short term, and advise also taking a more long-term view of their investments. And perhaps the biggest consideration of all, they warn their clients not to invest any money that they wouldn\u2019t be comfortable losing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to predict the future,\u201d says Cynthia Meyer, a financial planner at Real Life Planning in Gladstone, NJ. \u201cIf you take the long view and you\u2019re really well diversified across investments, so you don\u2019t own one stock, you own hundreds of stocks \u2026 some of those cylinders are always going to be firing.\u201d\n\nMost financial professionals also strongly caution against get-rich-quick schemes and investments such as putting all of their savings into cryptocurrency or meme stocks like GameStop.\n\n\u201cThat mentality was ill-advised,\u201d says Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf it was so easy to generate large returns based on fads, then we\u2019d know a lot more people who became wealthy overnight.\u201d\n\n1. Home price appreciation*\n\nOne-year returns: 6.26%\n\nThree-year returns: 32.88%\n\nFive-year returns: 48.95%\n\nHomeownership is a core tenet of the American dream for a good reason.\n\nHistorically, prices have risen over the long term, catapulting scores of Americans into the middle class and providing wealth that can be passed down through generations. Plus, homeowners can live in\u2014and enjoy\u2014their investments. (You don\u2019t get that from CDs.)\n\nThe challenge right now for many first-time buyers is to find a home they can afford. A shortage of homes for sale has kept prices high in many markets, and higher mortgage rates have pushed many would-be buyers out of the market.\n\nAnd even those who can make the numbers work aren\u2019t protected from downturns in the housing market. During the Great Recession, home prices plummeted, plunging many homeowners under water on their mortgages. Millions of Americans lost their homes to foreclosure.\n\nBut those who were able to hold on to their properties have seen prices rebound and then some over the past 15 or so years. And while many real estate professionals predict prices will dip in the months ahead, they\u2019re not predicting any catastrophic drop. Many markets are still seeing prices increase, and most experts believe prices will recover nationally by next year or 2025.\n\n\u201cHomeownership is the greatest generator of wealth for most Americans,\u201d says Bankrate\u2019s Hamrick. \u201cOver a long period, that should work well for most people and it generally does.\u201d\n\n2. Stock market*\n\nOne-year returns: -2.9%\n\nThree-year returns: 40.9%\n\nFive-year returns: 51.9%\n\nInvesting in the stock market isn\u2019t for the faint of heart. After what seemed like meteoric growth during the COVID-19 pandemic, the S&P 500 has since had a few headline-making drops before recovering some of those losses. But while the market is risky\u2014and plenty of folks have lost their shirts in it\u2014it\u2019s generally considered a good long-term investment.\n\nThe key is to play the long game and not focus on the day-to-day or week-to-week fluctuations, say financial planners.\n\nThose who are nearing retirement and may need that money sooner might want to put less money in the stock market because of that volatility. They might want to invest more in bonds, mutual funds (which are collections of stocks), and certificates of deposits, which are considered to be safer investments.\n\n\n\n\"The market is going to go up and it\u2019s going to go down. Over the long term, it\u2019s going to be very important just to have had held on to those investments,\" says Daniel Johnson, a financial planner at RE|Focus Financial Planning based in Winston-Salem, NC.\n\n3. Bonds*\n\n2023 average 10-year U.S. Treasury bond rate: 3.6%\n\n2020 average 10-year U.S. Treasury bond rate: 0.89%\n\n2018 average 10-year U.S. Treasury bond rate: 2.91%\n\nBonds have always been considered a safer, more stable, vanilla type of investment. But higher interest rates are changing that calculus.\n\n\"It's very exciting right now,\" says Vance Barse, a financial planner at Your Dedicated Fiduciary based in San Diego. \"You can earn a much higher interest rate than you could [previously].\"\n\nInvestors who opt for shorter-term bonds, with terms of a year or less, can find rates above 5%.\n\nBonds are loans made to companies and to federal, state, and local governments for a pre-determined length of time, typically ranging from a single month to 30 years. Investors earn interest on bonds and then receive their money back when the bonds mature.\n\nWhile higher rates mean more profitability, the downside is that bonds purchased when rates were lower aren\u2019t as attractive to invest in as the newer ones with higher interest rates. So if someone needs to sell a bond before it matures, they could lose money on that sale. And they might not get their full investment back if they don\u2019t wait until the end of their term.\n\nThat\u2019s how Silicon Valley Bank got itself in trouble and ultimately collapsed. The failed financial institution had bought up a lot of bonds that were worth less as interest rates increased.\n\nThis explains why the returns for bonds, which is what investors will make if they sell early, were down 1.51% over one year, down 9.26% over three years, and up 6.24% over five years as of April 25, according to Morningstar Direct.**\n\n\"But all of these losses are unrealized until someone decides to exit their exposure to the investment,\" says Bankrate's Hamrick. \"These losses are essentially on paper.\"\n\n4. Bitcoin*\n\nOne-year returns: -27.4%\n\nThree-year returns: 270.6%\n\nFive-year returns: 218.3%\n\nThe spectacular rise of cryptocurrency has been well documented\u2014as has its even more tremendous fall. The industry has been reeling since the large crypto exchange FTX collapsed late last year and its charismatic founder Sam Bankman-Fried was hit with 13 criminal counts, including securities fraud and money laundering. The repercussions have been felt throughout the digital currency landscape.\n\nInvestors who still want to put their money in bitcoin, the OG of digital currency, must accept the high amount of volatility. The market can plunge at any moment, which has happened, costing many investors their savings. There are no government insurance protections if something goes wrong. Investors who forget their credentials for their bitcoin wallet, where they can store the cryptocurrency, can lose everything. And transactions are irreversible.\n\n\"It\u2019s not something I ever advocate investing in if you\u2019re not willing to lose that investment,\" says Johnson, with RE|Focus Financial Planning.\n\n5. Home flipping*\n\nGross returns in 2022: 26.9%\n\nGross returns in 2019: 40%\n\nGross returns in 2017: 47.3%\n\nHome flipping might seem glamorous\u2014and lucrative\u2014on HGTV. But the reality is that flipping a home takes a lot of money and work, and investors can wind up losing quite a bit in the process.\n\nInvestors made about $67,900 per flip last year, according to real estate data firm ATTOM. That was down from the previous year. And that figure doesn't capture what flippers sunk into the home for maintenance and renovations. The gross return on investment numbers factored in only the difference between the initial price the home was purchased for and how much it sold for after it was renovated within a 12-month period.\n\nTypically, flippers should expect that about 20% to 30% of their profits will be spent on renovations. And that's if nothing goes terribly wrong during construction, such as an unexpected structural or plumbing issue, or home prices fall.\n\n\n\n\"The main risks are renovation budgets and schedules that fall short of reality, contractors who take longer than expected or do shoddy work, and potential delays in getting renovations approved by building inspectors,\" says ATTOM CEO Rob Barber.\n\nInvestors also need to be cognizant of what's going on in the market. Many flippers got themselves into financial trouble when they assume that home prices will keep rising indefinitely. During the Great Recession, many lost money when the market crashed and they couldn't recoup what they had put into these homes.\n\n\"Home flipping is really great in the good times,\" says RE|Focus Financial Planning's Johnson. \"But it can be really, really bad in the bad times because you\u2019re stuck with a house that you can\u2019t sell for what you\u2019ve invested in it.\n\n\"It can come with a lot of risk if the housing market turns on you very quickly,\" he adds.\n\n6. Real estate investment trusts*\n\nOne-year returns: -19.78%\n\nThree-year returns: 34.22%\n\nFive-year returns: 31.71%\n\nFor investors who would like to own a lot of real estate\u2014but simply don't have the funds to start buying up lots of property\u2014real estate investment trusts might be something to consider. They allow regular Joes an affordable way to invest in commercial real estate, such as apartment buildings, warehouses, and other types of property, on the cheap.\n\nInvestors buy shares in REITs, which are companies that own real estate, and then receive quarterly dividend payments. They can also buy and sell their shares on an exchange, potentially for a profit.\n\n\"For the average person, you're not going to have access to owning that business all by yourself,\" says Meyer, with Real Life Planning. \"Owning REITs gives you access ... without having to have a billion dollars.\"\n\nHowever, REITs are risky. The rise in mortgage interest rates hammered just about every real estate category investors can purchase REITs in. Those concentrated in the office sector took a heavy beating last year as the rise of remote and hybrid work resulted in many companies breaking leases or cutting their office space. Returns in this sector fell 37.6% in 2022, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. Apartments, manufactured homes, and single-family rentals also saw steep declines.\n\nThe good news for investors: In the first three months of this year, returns on REITs focused on industrial, self-storage, and data storage real estate have been climbing.\n\nThe value of REITs is \"going to go up and down with the economy,\" says Meyer.\n\n7. Money market funds*\n\nOne-year returns: 2.5%\n\nThree-year returns: 2.57%\n\nFive-year returns: 5.86%\n\nMoney market funds have recently been enjoying a rare moment in the spotlight thanks to higher interest rates. The average seven-day yield on these funds is now about 4%, according to Morningstar Direct.\n\nThese funds are popular with investors who value liquidity and stability over higher returns. The low-risk mutual funds typically invest in short-term U.S. Treasury and other less volatile bonds. While these funds are not completely risk-free, they're considered to be pretty close. And investors can sell shares in them at any time.\n\n\"We\u2019ve entered a new paradigm,\" says Barse, with Your Dedicated Fiduciary. \"Given where interest rates are, many of the banks are paying a fraction of what you can get in a money market fund ... or an FDIC-insured CD.\"\n\n8. Certificates of deposit*\n\nOne-year yield: 1.68%\n\nThree-year yield: 1.21%\n\nFive-year yield: 1.23%\n\nCertificates of deposit, better known as CDs, have become much more attractive to investors who don't mind tying up their money for a few months to a few years. Most banks offer the investments, which require folks to fork over a set amount of money for a predetermined period of time at a fixed rate. Once the CD matures, the investor gets the money back plus interest.\n\nSome financial institutions are offering rates above 5% for CDs with roughly one-year terms. So if you invest $1,000 in a 12-month CD, you'll walk away with $50 once it matures. That's not too shabby.\n\nThe downside is that if you need to take the money out early, you'll pay a penalty for doing so.\n\n\u201cThere are no guarantees that interest rates will stay where they are today,\" says Johnson, with RE|Focus Financial Planning. With a CD, \"you have a bank that's guaranteeing you that rate for a period of time.\"\n\n9. Savings accounts*\n\nCurrent average annual percentage yield: 0.24%\n\n2020 average APY: 0.09%\n\n2018 average APY: 0.09%\n\nMany folks will probably find savings accounts a surprising addition to this list\u2014especially with such low yields. That's because many of the larger banks have kept rates low on most savings accounts.\n\nHowever, savvy individuals who shop around can find accounts, many at online banks that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., offering rates 20 times as high, according to Bankrate's Hamrick. He notes there were accounts offering roughly 4.8% yields last week.\n\nThe higher rates are a result of the Fed hiking interest rates.\n\n\"The world got flipped upside down with the most aggressive Federal Reserve in 40 years, resulting in the best savings account [yields] in a decade,\" adds Hamrick.\n\n* Home price appreciation is based on Realtor.com median home list prices in March 2023 compared with March 2022, March 2020, and March 2018.

        "content": "Bitcoin edged up on Monday morning in Asia on the first trading day of May to hold above the US$29,000 mark as worries about the U.S. banking system resurfaced and amid bullish price forecasts for the token. Ether dipped below US$1,900, paring its 5% gain in April. Most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded lower, though Binance\u2019s BNB gained after the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange added the Sui blockchain to its Launchpool. Litecoin led the losers. U.S. equity futures traded flat to lower in Asia ahead of the Fed interest rate decision this week. All three major U.S. stock indexes logged gains for April.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin flirts with US$30,000, Ether regains US$1,900\n\nCrypto\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nBitcoin inched up 0.48% to US$29,309 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data, holding a weekly gain of 5.32%, after rising to as high as US$29,952 on Sunday.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency tested the lower US$27,000 line multiple times in April, but gained more than 4% for the month for the longest streak of monthly gains since March 2021. This could foreshadow a surge in 2023 that could send Bitcoin to US$105,000, according to a Bloomberg analyst report on Sunday.\n\nBitcoin could attract investment from global bond investors due to negative real rates and real returns, according to Jamie Coutts, a senior market structure analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nEther dipped 0.81% to US$1,884, but was trading 0.34% higher for the week. The world\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency gained over 5% for the month of April.\n\nBinance\u2019s BNB jumped 5.56% to US$339.09, logging a weekly gain of 2.05%. Binance introduced Sui blockchain\u2019s SUI token to its Launchpool on Monday, allowing Binance users to stake their BNB and TrueUSD (TUSD) to farm the recently launched SUI, whose price jumped over 20% in the past 24 hours.\n\nBNB also received a boost from Binance\u2019s return to Japan. Sakura Exchange BitCoin (SEBC), a regulated crypto exchange platform in Japan that was acquired by Binance in November 2022, will end its domestic services by the end of May and start a new service under the name \u201cBinance Japan\u201d from June 2023, according to a notice by SEBC on Friday.\n\nLitecoin led the losers, falling 2.33% to US$88.67 but adding 1.56% for the week.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization edged up 0.09% in the past 24 hours to US$1.20 trillion. The total trading volume over the last 24 hours rose 33.36% to US$32.79 billion.\n\nNFT\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index edged up 0.37% to 3,757.67 in the 24 hours to 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, but remained 0.55% lower for the week. The index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts. It is managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nMad Lads, a Solana-based NFT first minted on April 21, logged the largest seven-day sales volume across the market of over US$7.63 million, beating Bored Ape Yacht Club\u2019s (BAYC) US$7.04 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. The floor price of the NFT was 63.75 SOL as of 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, almost 10 times higher than the first token minted at 6.9 SOL.\n\nBAYC, one of the biggest NFT collections by market cap, also saw a surge in sales volume in the past 24 hours, jumping 170.22% to US$1.05 million, the largest volume across the NFT market.\n\nEquities\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded flat to lower as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures inched down 0.03%. The S&P 500 futures and the Nasdaq Composite Index both dipped 0.04%.\n\n\n\nThe three indexes closed higher last Friday on strong earnings from Intel Corp. and Exxon Mobil Corp., and logged gains for both the week and the month of April, according to Reuters on Saturday.\n\nHowever, the stock market gains last week were overshadowed by worries about the banking industry. The share price of U.S.-based First Republic Bank plunged 43.20% on Friday after the lender reported a 40.8% drop in deposits, or around US$100 billion, since the start of the year. Regulators are preparing to take over and sell the embattled bank, with multiple large financial institutions having submitted bids, according to the Wall Street Journal on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nMeanwhile in China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, the purchasing managers manufacturing index for April unexpectedly fell to 49.2 on month, missing expectations of a 51.4 gain, pointing to slower growth in the country, according to Reuters on Monday.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s next move on interest rates is due on May 3. The Fed has repeatedly raised rates over the past year to bring inflation down to its target range of 2%. With U.S. inflation still trending at around 5%, analysts at the CME Group now expect an 85.5% chance the Fed will raise rates by 25 basis points this week.\n\nU.S. interest rates are currently between 4.75% to 5%, the highest since June 2006.\n\nSee related article: Coinbase says SEC\u2019s legal threats punish transparency, undermine public listing process"

        "content": "Jack Dorsey\u2019s Block is on a mission to shake things up in the bitcoin mining world by creating its own custom silicon for mining hardware.\n\nWith only a few companies dominating the supply of bitcoin mining ASICs, Block is looking to level the playing field and bring some much-needed decentralization to the industry.\n\nPlus, the company revealed it scored a deal with Intel for a stash of bitcoin mining ASICs, giving it a major boost to accelerate its mining system development and focus on creating the next-gen three nanometer ASICs, which are only accessible to a few companies worldwide.\n\nThe chip giant only recently announced that it would discontinue its bitcoin mining chip, and will stop taking orders on October 20. The exact number of ASICs Block acquired from Intel was undisclosed.\n\nBlock said it has been in the ASIC design game for a long while, honing its skills by making ASICs for its Square payments processing solutions. Since the start of the project, Block has hired a team of designers that have cranked out some initial designs that are giving the best ASICs on the market a run for their money.\n\nBitcoin mining ASICs currently on the market are typically made using five-nanometer technology. In the past year, Block finished designing a top-of-the-line bitcoin mining ASIC using this semiconductor process.\n\nA nanometer \u2014 one billionth of a meter \u2014 is a common measurement describing the size of microscopic features on a computer chip. Five- and three-nanometer technology are among the most advanced manufacturing processes in the semiconductor industry. Shrinking the size results in more transistors and a more powerful and energy-efficient chip.\n\nBlock has just greenlit the manufacturing of a prototype for its completed five-nanometer design. This milestone will give the company a chance to try out different design variations, and fine-tune testing on actual silicon.\n\nNext, the company awaits the prototypes\u2019 arrival this fall, which it expects \u201cwill be a valuable input into our three-nanometer ASIC development work.\u201d\n\nBlock plans to make its bitcoin mining technology open-source, with a view to drive innovation and expand the bitcoin mining hardware ecosystem to new heights.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Bitcoin hash rates threaten blockchain decentralization - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Blockchain technology was introduced in 2008 as a decentralized, secure, transparent system for managing digital transactions. Its primary aim was to provide a solution to major problems with traditional transactional systems, including trust, security, decentralization and efficiency. Blockchain has since expanded beyond finance and has been used in supply chain management, healthcare, games, digital media and social media, among others.\n\nHowever, the blockchain industry is still facing significant challenges \u2014 such as a lack of diversity, wealth control by a few holders, hash rate problems and a loss of the promise of decentralization.\n\nHash rate and why it\u2019s a problem\n\nThe cryptocurrency on everyone\u2019s mind \u2014 and in the digital wallets of more than 400 million people around the world \u2014 is Bitcoin (BTC). Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate is the computing power required to validate transactions and produce new blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain. A high hash rate is necessary to maintain the integrity of the Bitcoin network, but it also presents some significant challenges.\n\nHash rate distribution among the largest mining pools for the six months ending April 25, 2023.\n\nOne of the most pressing issues is the high energy consumption required to maintain a high hash rate. As more miners join the network, the hash rate increases \u2014 and so does the energy consumption required to sustain it. The environmental impact of BTC mining has led to concerns throughout Bitcoin\u2019s volatile history and rise to mainstream fame.\n\nAnother challenge with Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate is the centralization of mining power in a few large mining pools. As the hash rate has increased over time, it has become increasingly difficult for individual miners to compete with these large pools, leading to concerns about the potential for these pools to monopolize the network and control the direction of Bitcoin\u2019s development.\n\nRelated: Elizabeth Warren wants the police at your door in 2024\n\nThere is also the potential for 51% attacks by mining pools that control the majority of the hash rate. If a single mining pool or a group of mining pools controls over 50% of the hash rate, they could potentially control the network and carry out malicious activities, such as double-spend attacks or rewriting transaction histories. This presents a significant threat to the security and integrity of the Bitcoin network.\n\nFinally, the limited scalability of the Bitcoin network is another challenge associated with its hash rate. As more users join the network and the number of transactions increases, the network can become congested, leading to slow transaction times and high fees. This can limit its utility as a viable payment system and has led to ongoing debates within the Bitcoin community about how to address these scalability challenges.\n\nPhantom decentralization comes in many forms\n\nThe blockchain industry has quickly fallen into a massive imbalance of power, mirroring the traditional finance industry. The concentration of wealth and power within a small group of individuals has created an industry that is far from decentralized. Those who were early adopters of blockchain technology, particularly Bitcoin, were able to accumulate large amounts of wealth through mining, investing and trading.\n\nThis has led to a concentration of wealth and power within a small group of individuals. The complexity of blockchain further limited early adoption to a minuscule percentage of people in the tech world. This concentration of power and wealth has made it difficult for new players to enter the market and challenge the dominance of established players.\n\nBitcoin ownership concentration, 2021 v. 2023. Source: Glassnode\n\nThe high barriers to entry have also contributed to the imbalance of power in the blockchain industry. The cost of setting up and running a successful blockchain project can be significant, and not everyone has the resources or expertise to do so. This has made it difficult for new startups to enter the market and challenge the dominance of established players.\n\nNetwork effects also play a role in the imbalance of power in the blockchain industry. Blockchain networks rely on network effects, which means that the value of the network increases as more people use it. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where established networks become increasingly dominant, making it harder for new networks to gain traction.\n\nFrom phantom decentralization to the real thing\n\nDespite the challenges facing the blockchain industry, there are ways to address these issues and create a more sustainable, equitable system.\n\nOne of the most pressing issues with Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate is its high energy consumption. To address this, the industry could move toward using renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar power, to power mining operations. This would not only reduce the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining but also make it more sustainable in the long run.\n\nRelated: CBDCs will lead to absolute government control\n\nTo address the issue of limited scalability in the Bitcoin network, efforts should be made to improve the underlying technology. This could include the development of new protocols or the adoption of existing protocols, such as the Lightning Network, which could significantly improve the speed and efficiency of Bitcoin transactions.\n\nFinally, greater efforts should be made to educate people about blockchain technology and its potential. This could be achieved by providing greater access to information and resources, offering training programs and workshops, and working with educational institutions to integrate blockchain into their curricula.\n\nAlexa Karp is head of marketing at Lumerin and a former founding marketing manager at Metaplex.

        "content": "Block, the financial services and technology company owned by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, has announced it has completed the prototype design of its new five-nanometre (5nm) Bitcoin (BTC) mining chip \u2014 which it claims is key to decentralizing the supply of Bitcoin mining rigs.\n\nAccording to a blog post published on April 28, Block explained that developing Bitcoin mining ASIC rigs is both financially and technically challenging. The result of this has been \u201cthe excessive concentration of custom bitcoin mining silicon\u201d in the hands of a select few companies. Block deems this centralization harmful to both miners and the Bitcoin network as a whole.\n\nWe have an update on our mining initiative. This one is about ASICshttps://t.co/bJOM9YNxfl \u2014 Thomas Templeton (@TempletonThomas) April 28, 2023\n\nNotably, the San Francisco headquartered company wrote that it plans to make Bitcoin mining technology \u201copen source\u201d where possible by selling standalone ASICs and other hardware components to \u201coptimize innovation and maximize the size of the Bitcoin mining hardware ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe post adds that the steps taken over the past few months will allow the firm to experiment with new designs and aid them in bringing more efficient and affordable Bitcoin mining chips to market. In order to fast-track this development push, Block added that it has purchased a large batch of ASIC chips from Intel.\n\nOn April 18, Intel announced that it would halt taking new orders for its Blockscale 1000 Series ASICs by Oct. 20 and end shipping in April 2024 as part of cost-cutting measures. Block says this large intake of ASICs from Intel will help accelerate the development of its proprietary 3nm chip, which it claims upon its release, would be the most advanced chip to date.\n\n\u201cWe can now focus our design team exclusively on cutting edge three nanometer ASIC development.\u201d\n\nThe scale of a nanometer (1nm) is approximately equivalent to the width of two silicon atoms. As parts of the chips become smaller, it allows for more transistors to fit into a silicon die of the same size. By reducing the overall size, the electric current travels less distance in the circuit to perform a calculation, which means that overall efficiency is improved and the amount of heat produced is decreased.\n\nRelated: Mineflation: Cost to mine one Bitcoin in the US rises from $5K to $17K in 2023\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that 5 nanometre ASIC chips have been around for some time, with the earliest 5nm ASIC being released in 2021 from Chinese mining firm Canaan. Currently, most Bitcoin mining ASICs run on 5nm chips; however, no company has made their ASIC chip designs open source.\n\nBitmain S19 ASIC mining rig.

Source: EIA/Hashrate Index/Luxor\n\nCoupled with Bitcoin\u2019s downward performance in 2022, which saw a maximum drawdown from around $48,000 to below $15,000, it is evident that active miners generated consistent losses due to the increase in operational costs and lower returns.\n\nBut this changed in Q1 of 2023 as the miners\u2019 hash price, or the U.S. dollar price per terahash per second per day (TH/s/d), rose 31% thanks to Bitcoin\u2019s price recovery toward $30,000.\n\n\u201cBleak as the new year looked at the outset, the lowest day for hashprice on a USD basis in Q1 was January 1,\u201d noted researchers at Hashrate Index, adding:\n\n\u201cIt was only up from there as a 70% rise resuscitated Bitcoin\u2019s price over the quarter, and along with it, hashprice.\u201c\n\nBitcoin hash price (in the dollar terms).

On the other hand, Texas has amended its utilities and tax codes, bolstering restrictions for crypto mining companies.\n\nEnergy deflation could boost miners\u2019 profitability\n\nFurthermore, the researchers anticipate the Bitcoin mining margins to grow further based on the U.S. Energy Information Association\u2019s (EIA) expectations of energy price deflation.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin advocates rally at Texas State Capitol to oppose bill cutting mining incentives\n\nFor instance, the agency expects the demand for electricity to drop by 1% in Q2, citing additional generation from renewable sources and cheaper natural gas prices.

        "title": "Bitcoin And Ethereum Maximalism: Silly And Self-Defeating - Blockworks",
        "content": "Maximalism is one of the least attractive philosophies in crypto.\n\nIt\u2019s the belief that any given blockchain is fit for all purposes, and that other blockchains are therefore inherently useless and of no value.\n\nThis is as dumb as it sounds.\n\nThe original maximalists were Bitcoiners, many of whom predate the era of smart contracts.\n\nAccording to Bitcoin maxis, the Bitcoin blockchain is capable of almost any functionality that later chains have added; or they assert, bizarrely, that any functionality not supported by the Bitcoin blockchain is not useful, and is therefore unnecessary.\n\nNever mind that Bitcoin is often slow, and somewhat expensive for everyday transactions.\n\nI\u2019m a pretty big fan of Bitcoin. It has many strengths, not least the fact that it\u2019s decentralized, secure, an excellent way to store value, and pretty much censorship-resistant. This makes it useful for all manner of things; some anticipated and desirable, some less so.\n\nI\u2019m also a major admirer of Ethereum. It is also highly decentralized, and it has a fantastic community of developers and builders who have created thousands of useful and utterly new applications on Ethereum.\n\nIt\u2019s also a little expensive, scaling it has involved a lot of compromises and a confusing array of solutions, its governance is tricky, and the manner of its launch made a few people who probably deserved it very rich (as well as a couple of folks who were just lucky enough to be in the room at the time).\n\nAnd I\u2019m excited about lots of other foundational blockchains, some of which have features they don\u2019t really share with Ethereum or Bitcoin, some of which are optimized for transaction cost, or volume, or some other metric.\n\nI try to imagine what it must be like to assert, contrary to logical analysis, that MY blockchain is the ONLY blockchain.\n\nAnd I guess it must be the equivalent of having just one tool in your garage, a drill, and wanting to use that drill for every home improvement project.\n\nHanging some drywall? Drill it! Repairing the stucco? Drill it! Fixing the plumbing? Drill it!\n\nOf course, we can\u2019t necessarily have exactly the right tool for every single situation. Your car, for example, may be a compromise car.\n\nMaybe you own a Toyota Camry. It\u2019s not designed to go extremely fast around corners. It wouldn\u2019t be much good off-road. It doesn\u2019t haul half a ton of lumber.\n\nEssentially the Camry is the Ethereum of cars. It does a bit of everything, which makes it a great solution for people who need their car to do a bit of everything.\n\nBut let\u2019s say you need your blockchain to be very, very good at one thing.\n\nFor instance, you are designing for the billion or so gamers out there.\n\nGamers don\u2019t want to pay little fees every time they mint an NFT achievement like clearing a level in record time, or collect an item they might use in a sequel.\n\nSo maybe you need a blockchain that has no fees.\n\nThat takes some pretty specialist design. Ethereum can\u2019t, by its very nature, support that precise need.\n\nMaybe you need your blockchain to be more private, or more secure, or much faster, or infinitely scalable, or to support some novel quantum-resistant cryptography. There are lots of reasons you might be prepared to trade all the usefulness of Ethereum for something very, very specific to your needs.\n\nIn which case, maximalism is exposed as a fraud.\n\nSure, clever folks have figured out lots of workarounds to make Ethereum more useful. In much the same way that Toyota figured out a nicer set of features to appeal to the customer who orders the loaded Camry \u2013 a better stereo, a more powerful engine, quad exhaust tips (don\u2019t get me started).\n\nBut a very nicely-equipped Camry is still not a Mercedes.\n\nNo matter how you slice it, Ethereum is a general use blockchain suitable for most general uses.\n\nIt is not the answer to every single real-life use case.\n\nWhich is why maximalism, in all its forms, no matter what blockchain the maximalist is maximizing, is an indication of a minimalist level of intellectual curiosity and honesty.\n\nNot to mention: We\u2019re ostensibly all in this together, right? We all want roughly the same thing: A better way of doing things, for the betterment of our experience on this planet?\n\nWe get there by collaborating, cooperating, working to find the right tool for the right job. Not by screaming at each other for daring to suggest that a general-purpose blockchain may not fit every use case.\n\nEthereum is a great innovation, it has a wonderful community and almost endless uses. Bitcoin is a remarkable and world-changing accomplishment, one that has opened countless minds to new possibilities.\n\nNeither of them is perfect. And that\u2019s okay.\n\nA version of this op-ed first appeared in Blockworks\u2019 newsletter.

        "title": "Will $28K Bitcoin price hold? 2 indicators remain solid despite 5% pullback - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin saw considerable volatility between April 25 and May 1, ranging between $27,200 and $30,000. From a trading perspective, the 10.5% move sounds alarming, resulting in $340 million in leveraged BTC futures contract liquidations.\n\nHowever, from a broader angle, the Bitcoin (BTC) price is up 72% year-to-date in 2023, while the S&P 500 stock market index accumulated 9% gains.\n\nBTC price climbs on weaker U.S. dollar, banking crisis\n\nBitcoin\u2019s bull run happened while the dollar strength index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of foreign exchanges, was nearing its lowest level in 12 months.\n\nThe indicator stands at 102, down from 105.3 eight weeks prior, as investors price in higher odds of further interventions from the United States Treasury to contain the banking crisis.\n\nOn May 1, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation closed down First Republic Bank (FRB) and transferred control to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The FDIC then entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with JPMorgan Chase to protect depositors. FRB joined Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank to become the latest U.S. bank to collapse in 2023.\n\nNow, the upcoming Federal Reserve decision on interest rates on May 3 is causing Bitcoin investors to question the sustainability of the $28,000 support level. By pushing the rate return closer to 5%, the central bank removes incentives for risk markets investments; hence, it's essentially negative for the price of Bitcoin.\n\nLet's look at derivatives metrics to better understand how professional traders are positioned in the current market environment.\n\nBitcoin margin markets show modest optimism\n\nMargin markets provide insight into how professional traders are positioned because they allow investors to borrow cryptocurrency to leverage their positions.\n\nOKX, for instance, provides a margin lending indicator based on the stablecoin/BTC ratio. Traders can increase their exposure by borrowing stablecoins to buy Bitcoin. On the other hand, Bitcoin borrowers can only bet on the decline of the cryptocurrency's price.\n\nOKX stablecoin/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nThe above chart shows that OKX traders' margin lending ratio increased between April 17 and April 30. That is somewhat concerning, as it shows that leverage has been used to support the Bitcoin price gains.\n\nMoreover, the 43% ratio favoring BTC longs on April 27 was the highest level in 40 days, indicating overexcitement as Bitcoin flirted with $30,000, which adjusted to 32% after the latest correction to $28,400.\n\nTo exclude externalities that might have solely impacted the margin markets, traders should analyze the long-to-short metric. The metric gathers data from exchange clients\u2019 positions on the spot, perpetual and quarterly futures contracts, thus offering better information on how pro traders are positioned.\n\nRelated: What the Gensler hearing means for US crypto regulation and policy\n\nBTC derivatives markets show no signs of bearishness\n\nThere are occasional methodological discrepancies between different exchanges, so readers should monitor changes instead of absolute figures.\n\nExchanges' top traders Bitcoin long-to-short ratio. Source: Coinglass\n\nEven though Bitcoin failed to break the $30,000 resistance, professional traders have increased their leveraged long positions using futures, according to the long-to-short indicator.\n\nAt crypto exchange OKX, the long-to-short ratio sharply increased, from 0.66 on April 27 to 0.93 on May 1. Moreover, at Binance, the long-to-short ratio also increased, favoring longs, moving from 1.12 on April 25 to a 1.26 peak on April 30.\n\nTherefore, despite the 5% price decline from a high of $29,970 on April 30, the bears using futures contracts were not confident enough to add leveraged shorts. Simply put, even if Bitcoin retests $28,000, bulls should not yet throw in the towel, as both margin and futures market indicators remain healthy.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

And what\u2019s Mt. Gox?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Department of Justice last year seized more than $3 billion worth of Bitcoin affiliated with the dark net marketplace Silk Road. They then sold a huge chunk of it\u2014and said they plan to sell more.\n\nMt. Gox, on the other hand, was a popular Bitcoin exchange that was forced to shut down eight years ago after a crippling hack. Once one of the biggest exchanges in the world, it closed in 2014 after losing 850,000 Bitcoins (today worth $24.9 billion) in the massive exploit.\n\nAccording to our data, the US government and the Mt. Gox trustee hold 205,514 and 137,890 #BTC, respectively. Monitor their balances and set alerts for coin movements in Studio. US government chart: https://t.co/cfQFqSfN0m\n\nMt. Gox trustee chart: https://t.co/3YxvDTGGyq pic.twitter.com/MhCiSiLfqx \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) April 27, 2023\n\nInvestors who lost their funds are still waiting to get it back from a trustee.\n\nChristoph Ono, a contributor at open source Bitcoin resource Bitcoin Design, told Decrypt that the intrigue is all centered around risk.\n\nHe said: \u201cWill the US government hold on to those Bitcoin forever? Or sell them off? If so, will they do it in a manner that reduces impact on the market or just dump in one go? Or auction them off? Who knows.\u201d\n\nThe fascination with watching the wallets where Mt. Gox funds are being held is similar, he added. \u201cI believe Mt. Gox is somewhat similar in that there are various unknowns,\" Ono said. \"At some point the coins will be released into the wild but no one really knows when and how.\u201d\n\nWhile Glassnode lead analyst James Check said that big investors may be interested in government coins.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPeriodically, the U.S. government auctions off these coins, which institutions in particular often find quite attractive, since they are in theory blessed and cleared by the U.S. government,\u201d he said. In the past, some institutions have fretted over the provenance of crypto assets when buying them and worried they could be unknowingly buying from bad actors.\n\nWhatever happens, investors are always keeping an eye on big HODLers\u2014known as whales\u2014especially unorthodox ones like the U.S. government.\n\n\u201cRoughly 10 billion dollars of bitcoin is an immense amount for the market to absorb,\u201d Evan Kaloudis, the developer behind Zeus, a non-custodial Lightning wallet, told Decrypt. \u201cI for one, though, am excited for the government to offload them to the market to circulate to new holders.\u201d\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to clarify that the \"Mt. Gox alert\" was the result of user error and not a \"bug fix\" by Arkham as initially reported."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nOrdinals notched a new record on Saturday as the protocol used for inscribing digital assets on Bitcoin\u2014producing assets comparable to Ethereum-based NFTs\u2014had its busiest day yet.\n\nThe daily number of inscriptions made through Ordinals on Saturday totaled around 223,000, according to a widely-used Dune dashboard. It marked the first time over 200,000 inscriptions were made in a single day and suggests the protocol is as popular as ever as it enters its fifth month since launch.\n\nIn April alone, the daily record for inscriptions made was shattered four other times. That included roughly 72,000 inscriptions on April 2 and 193,000 inscriptions on April 23, according to the Dune dashboard.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the same time, the number of Bitcoin transactions neared levels not seen in several years, according to blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock. On Sunday, the firm said that the weekly average of daily Bitcoin transactions was around 396,000, its highest level since December 2017.\n\nThe 7-day average of daily Bitcoin transactions was at its highest this week since December 2017. The increasing number of daily transactions suggests growing active usage of the Bitcoin blockchain pic.twitter.com/zKWUM8Vw5P \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) April 30, 2023\n\nLooking at some of the latest inscriptions using ordinals.com, what once resembled a sea of images early on has morphed into a wall of text-based inscriptions. The tides began to shift last month as people discovered Ordinals could be used to create fungible tokens on Bitcoin, in a way that\u2019s analogous to what one can do on Ethereum.\n\nThe trend was kicked off by a pseudonymous on-chain data enthusiast named Domo, who created the \u201cBRC-20\u201d token standard as an experiment. And as of Sunday, close to 6,900 tokens using the new-developed standard have been launched, including several meme tokens with multi-million dollar market caps, according to data from brc-20.io.\n\nNorth of 99.8% of the total inscriptions made on Saturday was text-based compared to just 272 image-based inscriptions, which represented 0.1% of the daily total. While not every text-based inscription is tied to fungible tokens, the ratio on Saturday represents a shift in Ordinals\u2019 use compared to when the month began.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen the daily record for inscriptions made was broken on April 4, text-based subscriptions accounted for only 86% of the daily total, while image-based ones made up nearly 13% at 9,273.\n\nAside from the creation of fungible tokens under the so-called BRC-20 standard, Ordinals is opening the door to activity on Bitcoin in other ways, such as the Sats Name (.sats) standard that resembles name services built on Ethereum.\n\nOn Friday, the self-described NFT Historian @LeonidasNFT recognized recent developments in the Ordinals space, saying that \u201cordinals protocol innovation on Bitcoin has been increasing exponentially.\u201d\n\nOrdinals Inscriptions Rare Sats BRC-20 .sats None of these things existed 3 months ago. Ever since the release of the ordinals protocol innovation on Bitcoin has been increasing exponentially. 14 years in and we haven't even scratched the surface of what Bitcoin can do yet. \u2014 Leonidas.og (@LeonidasNFT) April 28, 2023\n\nThat same day, the account celebrated a separate milestone for Ordinals, as the total number of inscriptions crossed 2 million. Just a couple of days later, the total number of inscriptions is now over 2.5 million, according to the Dune dashboard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s thrilling to see inscriptions growing the way they are,\u201d Ordinals Project Communications Director Isabel Foxen Duke told Decrypt, \u201cI\u2019m concerned these numbers are inflated by a flood of inscription-generated BRC-20 tokens which are highly insecure and may pose a risk to retail investors.\u201d\n\nIndeed, some projects that have quickly embraced the experimental token standard have encountered headwinds, such as UniSat Wallet. Shortly after the digital wallet project\u2014which supports inscriptions and BRC-20 tokens\u2014launched its own marketplace, the service was compromised \u201cdue to a vulnerability in [its] codebase.\u201d\n\nA few hours ago, UniSat Marketplace, which just launched, experienced a large number of double-spend attacks due to a vulnerability in our codebase.\n\nDuring our testing last week, we simulated different approaches to double-spend attacks and made improvements and enhancements to\u2026 \u2014 UniSat Wallet - Store, Inscribe and Search. (@unisat_wallet) April 24, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUniSat Wallet indicated it will compensate users who were affected by the incident on Twitter, which it said had impacted 70 transactions. The project did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Decrypt.\n\nInscriptions are sometimes referred to colloquially as Bitcoin NFTs, but the process for creating inscriptions and how each one\u2019s corresponding data is stored is distinct compared to digital assets that are created on blockchains like Ethereum or Solana.\n\nNFTs are unique digital tokens minted using smart contracts, where people interact with code that operates on decentralized protocols. They represent the ownership of an item, often digital art, and though it\u2019s possible to store assets such as images on-chain using Ethereum or Solana, most NFTs point to an asset that is stored off-chain.\n\nlInstead of creating a token that\u2019s entirely new, using Ordinals, people inscribe content like images or text to individual Satoshi, the smallest denomination that a Bitcoin can be divided into (1/100,000,000 BTC). And that content is stored directly and permanently on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain."

If the rate hike pause takes effect, the crypto market could potentially take a bullish position in anticipation of what could be a Fed pivot, which means rate cuts in further meetings.\n\nBitcoin Bullish In Next 45 Days?\n\nAs the market expects a rate hike pause in the June 14 meeting, any indication of a dovish stance from Fed Chair Jerome Powell in the post FOMC press conference could be key for setting the market mood for the next 45 days. However, further fluctuations in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and jobs data could dent the prospects of a rate hike pause in near future. Earlier, CoinGape reported that Bitcoin price could see resistance at $31000 level, as against the current price range of $29,243.\n\nAs per the CME FedWatch Tool, as many as 84% of the respondents are expecting that the US Fed takes a 25 bps hike decision in the May 3 meeting. Hence, a rate hike on expected lines may likely trigger a Bitcoin price drop, before taking an upward path, depending on Powell\u2019s comments. Already, Goldman Sachs economists said they don\u2019t expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in June 2023. Hence, the next 45 days could overall be bullish for Bitcoin price, even as many predict BTC to go as high as $100,000.\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu\u2019s Shytoshi Kusama Can Ask Binance To List BONE, Here\u2019s How"

        "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Continues Downtrend Despite Daily Transactions Nearing All-Time High - NewsBTC",
        "content": "While Bitcoin (BTC) has continued a downtrend, the asset has recently recorded a high volume in daily transactions nearing its all-time high. According to a report by on-chain analytics provider Glassnode, \u201cBitcoin daily transaction counts are approaching All-time-highs, seeing an explosive uptick in 2023.\u2019\n\nRegardless of this news, Bitcoin has continued to move downward after its weekend plateau of trading at just between $29,300. The asset trading volume has also surged slightly indicating a possible violent sell-off.\n\nBitcoin Records Daily Transactions Nearing Peak Levels\n\nAccording to Glassnode, on the 30-day moving average, Bitcoin daily transactions have reached an amount of 348,700. While the peak level which was seen in 2017 remains at 379,000 transactions per day. This has proved Bitcoin\u2019s daily transactions are beginning to near the all-time high last seen about 5 years ago.\n\nFurthermore, according to the Glassnode report, this surge in Bitcoin daily transactions is thanks to the Ordinal inscriptions. The Ordinal inscriptions also known as Bitcoin non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or Ordinals, are inscriptions (digital artifacts) inscribed on satoshis (sats) \u2013 little units of Bitcoin.\n\nGlassnode noted the inscription accounts for approximately 30% to 40% of mined transactions and 10% to 20% of fees paid. Meanwhile, the remaining majority of transactions are monetary in nature, frequently conducted through exchanges.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, compared to Ordinals activity on the Bitcoin blockchain, BTC exchange activity is relatively low, representing roughly 30% of fees and transactions.\n\nThe trend of creating inscriptions initially gained popularity in February when users started inscribing NFTs on satoshis. However, the recent resurgence has been dominated by inscriptions that are based on text.\n\nGlassnode noted:\n\nBitcoin transaction counts, address activity, Inscriptions, and Mempool congestion are all elevated. As is the degree of HODLing, and supply acquired below $30k. Conviction remains.\n\nBTC Continues Downtrend\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is yet to make any significant move in the past few days. Instead, it has only seemed to pick up from where it left off in its downward trend in recent weeks. Over the past 24 hours, the top crypto has plummeted nearly 4% with a market price of $28,435, at the time of writing.\n\nThis downtrend follows a notable fall from the $30,000 region in recent weeks. So far, Bitcoin has a 24-hour range between a low of $28,315 and a high of $29,944.\n\nMeanwhile, the BTC market cap is still in the green while its trading volume signals selling pressure, indicating a possible continuous bearish trend.\n\nOver the past week, Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization has surged from a low of $528 billion on April 24 to as high as $550 billion as of today. Its trading volume has also spiked from a daily trading volume of $15.4 billion to $19.8 billion, over the same time period.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Hacking is something uncommon in the unregulated world of cryptocurrency, right? Almost every other month in recent years, hackers have targeted and stolen millions of dollars in crypto. But what a mysterious hacker recently did, is something we seldom hear of.\n\nA mysterious hacker gained access and stole $300,000 worth of bitcoin belonging to various Russian govt agencies. But that's not it. Instead of using the stolen crypto money, the hacker reportedly donated it to the war-hit nation of Ukraine.\n\nHacker Donates Stolen Crypto To Ukraine\n\nindiatimes\n\nThe crypto experts say that the hacker has transferred the stolen bitcoins to the addresses of Ukrainian volunteers, as per CoinDesk report citing Chainalysis, a cryptocurrency monitoring company that works with the U.S. government.\n\n\n\nThe mystery hacker seems to have been able to put blockchain and bitcoin technologies to work against the aggressor state. Using their arcane skills, the hacker gained access to hundreds of crypto wallets, which likely belonged to Russian law enforcement agencies.\n\nChainalysis analysts reportedly believe that the hacker used a feature of documenting transactions in the bitcoin blockchain to identify 986 wallets controlled by the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (GRU), the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), and the Federal Security Service (FSB), as per a report in The New Voice Of Ukraine, a daily premier news firm in the war-hit country.\n\nAlso Read: 5 Crypto Firms That Filed For Bankruptcy Besides FTX\n\nWhat The Hacker Said In His Messages\n\nThe hacker left messages in Russian to the owners of the wallets, in which he states that these wallets were used to pay for the services of hackers working for Russia.\n\nshutterstock\n\nIt is not known to what extent these allegations are true. Western analysts reportedly consider it indisputable that Russian intelligence services use hackers to conduct numerous operations.\n\n\n\nThey note that at least three of the allegedly Russian wallets have already been linked to Russia by third parties. Two of them were allegedly involved in the Solar winds attack, and the third paid for servers used in Russia's disinformation campaign in the 2016 elections.\n\n\n\nHacking Through 'Inside Work'?\n\nThe hacker seems to have gained control of the wallets, which he claims were controlled by Russian intelligence services, not through hacking, but through \"inside work\".\n\n\"Simply put, this person could have infiltrated the structure of hackers working for Russia, or he could have been an employee of the Russian special services who later became a defector.\n\nThe first hacks were carried out a few weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nThe hacker was initially determined to simply destroy the stolen funds in the wallets of the Russian special services.\n\nHowever, when Russia's war with Ukraine began, the hacker changed tactics. Since the first days of the war, the Ukrainian government has used cryptocurrency to raise millions of dollars for military and charitable purposes. Click here to know how crypto donations have played a key role in helping Ukraine.\n\nAP\n\nAccording to Chainalysis, some of the wallets involved in this investigation transferred funds to Ukrainian government wallets after the war began. Basically, the mysterious hacker stopped burning money and started sending it to help Ukraine, Chainalysis said, as per the report.\n\n\n\n\"The fact that the OP_RETURN sender was both willing and able to burn hundreds of thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of bitcoin in order to spread their message makes it more likely in our opinion that their information is accurate,\" the analysts concluded.\n\nAlso Read: 22-YO Shubham Saini's Tea Stall Accepts Crypto Payments\n\nFor more such interesting content and the latest financial news, keep reading Worth.

        "content": "As we close out Q1 of the year, looking at the crypto market\u2019s performance is important. Crypto has had a great start in 2023, which could indicate what is to come. Some of the major assets on the market are showing positive trends, and if these continue, investors can expect good returns.\n\nDespite various challenges, Bitcoin (BTC) has remained the leading crypto and is currently experiencing an upward trend, surpassing its value from a year ago, further proving its dominance.\n\nHowever, other cryptocurrencies have demonstrated their potential for growth in 2023, and it is worth noting them. Three such coins are Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), and Big Eyes Coin (BIG).\n\nSolana and Avalanche\u2019s 2023 Plans\n\nThis year, the cryptocurrency market has seen an impressive rise from Solana and Avalanche. Within a month at the beginning of the year, Solana and Avalanche witnessed an extraordinary surge, with Solana up by 140% and Avalanche up by 82%.\n\nThese two coins are already considered major players in the crypto market and are expected to launch exciting new plans shortly. Solana has been gaining recognition for its innovative features, including its proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, which ensures network security while allowing for fast transaction processing.Additionally, the platform\u2019s unique architecture allows for horizontal scaling, which means it can handle high transaction volumes without compromising speed or security.\n\nSolana has recently announced a new initiative called \u201cIgnition\u201d, which aims to support the growth and development of projects built on the Solana blockchain. The program will provide funding, technical support, and marketing assistance to promising projects to drive innovation and growth on the Solana platform.\n\nMeanwhile, Avalanche quickly gained popularity for its high transaction speeds and low fees. The platform\u2019s native token, AVAX, has seen significant growth in value since its launch, making it one of the most promising cryptocurrencies in the market. Avalanche\u2019s unique consensus algorithm, Avalanche-X, allows for high-speed transactions while maintaining security and decentralization.\n\nRecently, Avalanche announced its plans to launch a new cross-chain bridge called \u201cAvalanche Bridge,\u201d allowing users to seamlessly move assets between different blockchain networks. The bridge will support various assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others, making it easier for users to move their assets across different networks.\n\nBig Eyes Prepares to Launch\n\nBig Eyes is one of the newest meme coins in the space, but it feels long-established despite still being on the market. Its popularity based on the large community it has already built can be seen from its incredible success in presale alone.\n\nBig Eyes has attractive tokenomics, with 70% of the 200 trillion supply sold to the general public and 5% reserved for charitable purposes in a charity wallet. This unique combination of features has resulted in one of the market\u2019s largest presales for a meme coin ever seen.\n\nInvestors and traders should pay close attention to Big Eyes as the project\u2019s presale will soon end after raising over $34 million, becoming the most significant presale result in recent years. The project is set to launch officially on June 3rd, which has generated considerable anticipation among its fan base. To celebrate this milestone, those who have yet to purchase Big Eyes can take advantage of a limited-time offer of 300% extra tokens using the code END300.\n\nFor All Things Big Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Shalom,\n\nIt's a new week and month! Trust you\u2019re prepared for May because it holds many exciting opportunities. \ud83e\udd17\n\nToday is International Workers' Day, also known as Labour Day or Mayday in some countries.\n\nIt\u2019s a day to recognise your hard work and dedication as a working-class citizen, raise awareness about your rights, and protect you from exploitation.\n\nConsequently, if you have a 9-5 or work remotely in Africa, I'm seizing this moment to appreciate your efforts and wish you a wonderful time and a great workplace culture to thrive and become the best you can be.\n\nEnjoy your holiday as you reflect on your career goals and how far you've come as a worker. \u263a\ufe0f\n\nHere's what I've got for you today:\n\nKenya's Communications Authority's battle to detect fake phones\n\nMTI's CEO to pay $3.4b for Bitcoin fraud\n\nSEC launches Regulatory portal for fintech startups\n\nKenya's Communications Authority's battle to detect fake phones\n\nThe Supreme Court has given the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) permission to revive the device management system (DMS) implementation to detect and combat fake phones.\n\nThis means the communications regulator will install a device on mobile phone networks to detect fakes.\n\nBe the smartest in the room Join 30,000 subscribers who receive Techpoint Digest, a fun week-daily 5-minute roundup of happenings in African and global tech, directly in your inbox, hours before everyone else. Digest Subscription Email First Name Subscribe Give it a try, you can unsubscribe anytime. Privacy Policy.\n\nIn October 2022, the watchdog asked the court to lift the ban that blocked the launch of the DMS in 2018 amid concerns that reviving it would give the government access to more customer data, including calls, messages, and financial activity.\n\nAlso, the apex court dismissed a second appeal from the Law Society of Kenya (LSK) to stop the implementation of the DMS.\n\nThe Society argued that intercepting and recording communications and mobile data would usher in an era of increased governmental control and invasion of personal privacy. However, it could not persuade the Supreme Court to halt its implementation.\n\nA five-judge panel of the Supreme Court ruled that the court does not have jurisdiction to \u201chear and determine the instant petition of appeal.\"\n\nIn 2020, the Court of Appeal permitted the CA to continue developing the DMS. But it stated that the rules or regulations governing its installation should be open to public input.\n\nInsisting that the technology can only detect and record the unique identification number of mobile phones and assigned subscriber numbers, the regulator disputed claims that the DMS can access subscriber phone records, location data, and mobile money transaction information.\n\nThe CA defended the device's installation, claiming it was intended to combat counterfeits by establishing an Equipment Identification Register (EIR).\n\nThe EIR will detect all devices, isolate the illicit ones, and refuse services to fake ones.\n\nThe watchdog also argued that the manufacturers of fake devices had advanced in technology and began attaching genuine International Mobile Equipment Identification (IMEI) numbers to the fakes, which made detection more difficult.\n\nThe CA stated that, in addition to cloning real IMEIs, the next front in the fight against fake devices is SIM boxing.\n\nMTI's CEO to pay $3.4b for bitcoin fraud\n\nCornelius Steynberg. Image source: Criptomercato.it\n\nI mentioned last week that an Acting High Court Judge, Alma de Wet, called South African company, Mirror Trading International (MTI), a \"fraudulent investing scheme.\"\n\nWell, a United States court has directed that Cornelius Johannes Steynberg, the CEO of MTI, pay a total of $3.4 billion \u2014 $1.7 billion in restitution to victims of the fraud scheme and another $1.7 billion as a civil penalty.\n\nAccording to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), that amount represents the highest fraud case involving Bitcoin.\n\nJudge Lee Yeakel in the Western District of Texas authorised the default judgment against Steynberg.\n\nThe CFTC charged Steynberg in 2022 with soliciting Bitcoin from thousands of people online to supposedly run a commodity pool through Mirror Trading.\n\nThe regulator said that the company made claims regarding off-exchange, retail foreign currency trading with participants who were ineligible to trade.\n\nPer the CFTC, Steynberg accepted and misappropriated at least 29,421 Bitcoins from over 1,300 participants in Texas between May 2018 and March 2021, totalling over $1.7 billion in value by the end of the time frame.\n\nAbout 23,000 participants were from the United States overall.\n\nMTI is being liquidated in South Africa, and Steynberg has been imprisoned in Brazil since December 2021, despite being wanted by South African authorities.\n\nPer the court's ruling, MTI is \"liable for fraud in connection with retail foreign currency (forex) transactions, fraud by an associated person with a commodity pool operator (CPO), registration violations, and failure to comply with CPO regulations.\"\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Steynberg is permanently barred from registering with the CFTC and trading in any market the watchdog regulates.\n\nSEC launches Regulatory portal for fintech startups\n\nOn April 28, 2023, the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched the Regulatory Incubation (RI) portal for fintech startups planning to or operating in the Nigerian Capital Market.\n\nAlso, unregistered innovators who need regulation in the fintech space can apply for the RI programme. The deadline for application is May 26, 2023.\n\nStartups focusing on crowdfunding, robo advisory/digital investment advisory, and sub-broker serving multiple brokers via digital platforms can not apply because they fall under different regulations.\n\nAlso, fintech companies that want to apply must have solutions that are applicable to the Nigerian Capital Market and be safe for investors.\n\nThey must also present a genuine innovation that introduces a new product or process to meet specific investor needs, address any current compliance or supervisory issues (optional), and is ready for testing.The decision to open a portal stems from a 2021 agreement announcing the RI programme for fintech companies interested in participating in the Nigerian Capital Market.\n\nLast week on Techpoint Africa\n\nWhat I'm reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nClevertech is looking for a remote Mobile Engineer.

As we approach a critical juncture in the market, a variety of experts have been consulted to provide their insights on the matter.\n\n32 fintech and crypto experts were asked to give their end-of-year price predictions for BTC, suggesting that the asset is expected to perform positively as per a Finder study.\n\nAccording to the results shared with Finbold, the experts suggest that Bitcoin is set to rise as the year progresses, although it will not come close to its all-time high of over $69,000. Indeed the polled finance professionals believe that BTC could reach its peak in 2023 at $35,459.\n\nBitcoin 2023 price prediction. Source: Finder.com\n\nIn addition, the surveyed specialists have made some notable projections regarding Bitcoin\u2019s future performance. They predict that Bitcoin will reach $99,781 by 2025 and $297,848 by 2030, which represent a 29% and 58% increase, respectively, from the estimates made by the panelists in January 2023.\n\nWhat the experts say on BTC\n\nAs per the findings of a recent survey, industry experts predict that Bitcoin\u2019s price will continue to surge in the short to medium term.\n\nThe surveyed panelists estimate that Bitcoin\u2019s peak price in 2023 will average around $42,225, with some experts forecasting that it could surpass $50,000. On the other hand, the lowest price Bitcoin could hit in 2023 is expected to average around $17,026, with some panelists projecting it could fall as low as $15,000 or below.\n\nFinance Magnates senior analyst and editor, Damian Chmiel, the expert\u2019s prevailing sentiment is that a higher Bitcoin price is highly likely in the short to midterm.\n\n\u201cAn increase to $50K seems not a bold prediction but rather just a formality,\u201d Chmiel said. \u201cThe recent banking crisis has indeed shown that Bitcoin can be a safe haven in times of uncertainty.

        "content": "Bhutan\u2019s largest and only government-owned holding company Druk Holding and Investments (DHI), has confirmed that it has been mining Bitcoin (BTC) for several years as part of its diversified portfolio.\n\nAccording to the company, its interest in Bitcoin mining began when the maiden cryptocurrency was valued at around $5,000, but it also has a slight interest in Ethereum (ETH), the local media outlet The Bhutanese reported on April 28.\n\nDHI officials assured that the risks associated with cryptocurrencies are mitigated, considering that the company is not involved in direct selling and buying digital assets. At the same time, DHI noted that the investment pays for itself by selling Bitcoin to cater for the mining operational costs.\n\nThe company clarified that the investment in Bitcoin mining is a strategic move rather than driven by the fear of missing out (FOMO) on the technology. As part of this strategy, DHI is assembling a team of experts in cryptocurrencies and harnessing the benefits of regulated cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide.\n\nFinbold initially reported that it emerged that the landlocked Himalayan country was secretly investing millions in Bitcoin alongside other digital assets. The investment revelations came to light following the bankruptcies of crypto lenders BlockFi and Celsius.\n\nSurplus of electricity\n\nThe mining operation is powered by Bhutan\u2019s renewable energy source, which is generated through hydro projects. Notably, the country generates nearly 100% of its electricity from renewable sources, which produces a surplus of electricity, making it ideal for Bitcoin mining.\n\nThe venture into cryptocurrency mining is part of Bhutan\u2019s efforts to spur economic growth, where technology is viewed as a key element.\n\n\u201cOur portfolio contains investments across a range of asset classes that deliver exposure to traditional sectors and the industries driving the modern economy. This includes global equities, fixed income and venture capital investments in promising startups; domestic and international real estate; renewable energy including hydropower generation; healthtech, biotech, life sciences, and agritech; and digital asset mining and investment,\u201d said a statement from DHI.\n\nFurthermore, DHI CEO Ujjwal Deep Dahal explained that the company had managed to repay all the loans borrowed from bankrupted crypto firms BlockFi and Celsius. He clarified that DHI did not suffer any financial losses compared to the cost of mining digital assets in Bhutan."

        "content": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC), after a sharp increase on April 25 and 26, BTC underwent days of relative stability, only to drop by over 4% as last weekend came to a close.\n\nIn a tweet on April 30, crypto analyst Ali Martinez put forward an observation regarding Bitcoin\u2019s price direction, highlighting two critical levels that may play a role. Martinez notes that a significant support level is evident, with 1.85 million addresses purchasing 650,000 BTC between the price range of $27,440 and $28,315.\n\nAdditionally, Martinez identifies a key resistance level, with 1.37 million addresses having acquired 530,000 BTC between $29,260 and $30,130. These levels could potentially influence Bitcoin\u2019s future price action.\n\nTo determine the direction of #Bitcoin, keep an eye on these two key levels:\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 1.85M addresses bought 650K $BTC between $27,440 and $28,315, which acts as support.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd34 1.37M addresses bought 530K #BTC between $29,260 and $30,130, which acts as resistance. pic.twitter.com/z3gzPoe0vw \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) April 30, 2023\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin\u2019s price sits at $28,551, placing the digital asset just above the support level mentioned in the tweet.\n\nBitcoin price drops with the start of May\n\nAfter initially rising from $27,400 on April 25, Bitcoin reached a resistance just below $30,000 on April 26, and the coin spent the weekend trying to breach the resistance at $29,260. BTC reached the height of $29,800 on three occasions over the past week \u2014 Once on April 26, another time on April 27, and one last time on April 30.\n\nHowever, with the arrival of the new week, Bitcoin\u2019s price dropped to roughly $28,500, which is where it sits at the time of writing. In the past 7 days, BTC price has grown by 4.13%, but on a 24-hour chart, it is 2.35% down.\n\nBitcoin price chart (last 7 days). Source: Finbold.com\n\nThe price drop comes ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy decision, which is expected to be made on Wednesday, May 3. The uncertainty has caused the majority of crypto assets to trade in the red, moving toward neutralizing the weekly gains seen in the final days of April.\n\nFor now, traders are waiting for one of the levels to break. However, it remains to be seen which level will break first.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice. Investing is speculative.
