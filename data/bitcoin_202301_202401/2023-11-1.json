        "title": "Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Cash: What's the Difference? - Investopedia",
        "content": "Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Cash: An Overview\n\nBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency that achieved public awareness. It began as a payment method outside the control of governing bodies or other third parties. Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency created from a Bitcoin blockchain fork, which occurs when users resist change or reprogram a blockchain to operate the way they want it to. Bitcoin cash forked in 2017 after developer and user disagreements about the direction Bitcoin was heading.\n\nKey Takeaways Bitcoin is limited by transaction processing time, an issue that has caused rifts among factions within the Bitcoin mining and developing communities.\n\nBitcoin Cash was started by Bitcoin miners and developers concerned about the future of Bitcoin and its ability to scale effectively.\n\nThough Bitcoin blocks are limited to 1 MB, BCH blocks can be up to 32 MB.\n\nBitcoin\n\nIn July 2017, mining pools and companies representing roughly 80% to 90% of Bitcoin computing power voted to incorporate a technology known as segregated witness (SegWit). This fix made the amount of data needing verification in each block smaller by removing signature data from the block that needs to be processed in each transaction and attaching it in an extended block. Signature data was estimated to account for up to 65% of data processed in each block, so this was not an insignificant technological shift.\n\nIn September 2017, research released by cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX showed that SegWit implementation had helped increase the block size amid a steady adoption rate for the technology.\n\nBitcoin Cash\n\nBitcoin Cash is a different story. Bitcoin Cash was started by Bitcoin miners and developers equally concerned with the future of the cryptocurrency and its ability to scale effectively. However, these individuals had their reservations about the segregated witness feature. They felt that SegWit did not address the fundamental problem of scalability meaningfully, nor did it follow the roadmap initially outlined by Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous party who first proposed the blockchain technology behind cryptocurrency.\n\nIn August 2017, some miners and developers initiated a hard fork, effectively creating a new blockchain and currency: Bitcoin Cash (BCH). BCH has its own blockchain and specifications, including one crucial distinction from Bitcoin: it has an increased block size of 8 MB to accelerate the verification process. This block size has an adjustable size level, which ensures transaction verification speeds, regardless of the number of miners supporting it. This limit was increased to 32 MB in 2018.\n\nBitcoin Cash is thus\u2014theoretically\u2014able to process transactions more quickly than the Bitcoin network, meaning that wait times should be shorter and transaction processing fees could be lower. The Bitcoin Cash network is also believed to be able to handle many more transactions per second than the Bitcoin network. However, this claim has yet to be tested, as the blockchain only averages more than 115,000 daily transactions.\n\nSpecial Considerations\n\nThe debate about scalability, transaction processing, and blocks has continued beyond the fork that led to Bitcoin Cash. In November 2018, for example, the Bitcoin Cash network experienced its own hard fork, resulting in the creation of yet another derivation of Bitcoin called Bitcoin SV. Bitcoin SV was created in an effort to stay true to the original vision for Bitcoin that Satoshi Nakamoto described in the Bitcoin white paper while making modifications to facilitate scalability and faster transaction speeds.\n\nBitcoin remains the most popular cryptocurrency in the world as well as the largest by market capitalization, so BCH users may find that liquidity and real-world usability are lower than they are for Bitcoin.\n\nEven with an increased block size implemented to decrease transaction times and improve usability, BCH doesn't experience near the popularity and volume of Bitcoin. BCH block sizes on Nov. 1, 2023, ranged from a few hundred bytes to about 7 MB, while BTC blocks ranged consistently from 1.1 MB to about 1.8 MB.\n\nHow Does the Market Capitalization of Bitcoin Cash Compare With Bitcoin's? On Nov. 1, 2023, Bitcoin Cash had a market capitalization of $4.7 billion, ranking it No. 18 among cryptocurrencies by this measure, while Bitcoin was the largest cryptocurrency by far, with its market cap of $673 billion.\n\nWhat Is the Total Supply of Bitcoin Cash? Like Bitcoin, the total supply of Bitcoin Cash will never exceed 21 million coins. The rate at which new coins are added to the circulating supply gradually decreases along a defined schedule, with the issuance rate cut in half about every four years. As of Nov. 1, 2023, the circulating supply of Bitcoin Cash was 19,547,438 BCH or about 93% of the total supply. Bitcoin's circulating supply was 19,530,375 BTC or 93% of the total supply.\n\nWhat Are the Features That Make Bitcoin Cash an Effective Medium of Exchange? Bitcoin Cash enables peer-to-peer payments between individuals, like cash, but in digital form. Fees for sending Bitcoin Cash are typically a fraction of a cent, while settlement occurs almost instantly regardless of the physical location of the participants in the transaction. These features make Bitcoin Cash useful for daily transactions as well as microtransactions.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are two cryptocurrencies that evolved from the original Bitcoin release. Bitcoin Cash forked from Bitcoin in 2017 after the community disagreed on how to fix scalability and speed issues. Bitcoin remains the top cryptocurrency by price and market capitalization, but Bitcoin Cash has a significant user base as well.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Block\u2019s share price soared in after-hours trading after the payments company surpassed analyst expectations for its third quarter earnings, which included news of a double-digit jump in Bitcoin revenue.\n\nThe company\u2019s Bitcoin revenue grew 37.5% to $2.42 billion from $1.76 billion in the same period last year. Gross profit the company reaped from Bitcoin rose to $44 million, compared with $36 million last year.\n\nBlock also touted the value of the Bitcoin holdings in its corporate treasury, which amounted to $216 million based on market prices. The value of its holdings based on market prices was $114 million higher than the value on its books.\n\nThe discrepancy between book value and market value is due to a quirk in accounting rules (set to be changed) that require firms to record any decreases in Bitcoin price as an impairment charge, but prevents them from recognizing increases in the value of their Bitcoin holdings until the assets are sold. In the third quarter of 2023, the company did not recognize a Bitcoin impairment loss.\n\nIn total, Block\u2019s net revenue grew 24% year-over-year to $5.62 billion from $4.52 billion a year ago. Bitcoin revenue made up about 43% of total revenue. The jump in revenue that came from the cryptocurrency was fueled by strong performance of the company\u2019s CashApp product.\n\nCash App revenue grew 34% to $3.58 billion, up from $2.68 billion a year ago.\n\nBlock shares were trading at about $50, up 15% after market close on Thursday."

        "content": "The largest crypto exchange in the U.S. announced on Thursday that smaller investors, otherwise known as retail traders, are now be able to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum futures on its U.S. platform.\n\nCustomers can access the two new financial products through Coinbase Advanced, an offshoot of the exchange\u2019s main platform that lets investors trade more financially complex crypto products. As opposed to CME, a U.S. derivatives exchange that also sells Bitcoin and Ethereum futures, Coinbase\u2019s offering targets shallower-pocketed traders.\n\n\u201cThese contracts offer lower upfront capital requirements and can be an affordable investment option for a broader range of retail customers,\u201d the company wrote in a blog post announcing the products.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s unveiling of a futures contract in the U.S. for both Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, comes as the exchange looks to diversify its products to compete with the likes of Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world.\n\nFutures allow traders to not only speculate on the future price of an asset but to gamble with more assets than they actually own. Customers can front, for example, $100 as collateral and trade $200 worth of crypto, magnifying their losses and gains as a cryptocurrency\u2019s price waxes and wanes.\n\nBy most estimates, the global trading volume of the crypto derivatives markets, which include futures, far outpaces that of crypto spot markets, or the simple purchase or sale of cryptocurrencies. As of Wednesday, the 24-hour trading volume of crypto derivatives was approximately $37 billion on Binance compared with just about $9 billion in spot, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nBinance dominates the crypto derivatives market. The 24-hour trading volume of its nearest competitors OKX and BitMart was a little more than a fourth of Binance\u2019s. If its recent product announcements are any indication, Coinbase, which has historically been more willing than Binance to play nice with regulators and avoid risky crypto financial instruments, is looking for a slice of that pie.\n\nIn April, the publicly traded crypto exchange announced that it had obtained a regulatory license in Bermuda. In May, it then launched a Bermuda-based offshore exchange, which specializes in futures. And then, in late September, it opened up its offshore exchange to retail investors.\n\nThe exchange\u2019s most recent unveiling of crypto futures, however, is in the U.S., where it obtained a license to sell the risky financial instruments earlier this year."

I am not a fan and don\u2019t recommend (or own) volatile securities that are all \u201cperceived value\u201d and backed by nothing. Plus, it\u2019s not easy to buy them, though that may be about to change.\n\nWhen you buy a crypto currency you are putting your trust in an unregulated business (hello FTX), you\u2019d better not forget your password, and you or your holding company better not get hacked. There is no FDIC or SIPC protection.\n\nAlternatively, one can invest in a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) like ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO). But that fund invests in bitcoin futures contracts instead of bitcoin and rolling over futures contracts as they expire is expensive. As an example, the S&P 500 is where it was one year ago. But the ProShares Short S&P 500 (SH), which also uses futures contracts, has lost 8 percent over the same period. Shouldn\u2019t it be unchanged as well?\n\nHere\u2019s the good news for those who own or want to buy bitcoin: The SEC may be close to approving bitcoin ETFs that will track the spot price instead of the futures price. Several ETF providers have already submitted applications. They include BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, Invesco, ARK, and others.\n\nWhat will happen to bitcoin\u2019s price if/when a spot bitcoin ETF is approved? With bitcoin rallying above $35,000 it is already getting priced in. But this could be early innings if bitcoin ETFs are approved.\n\nOnce there are spot bitcoin ETFs then any investor with a brokerage account can buy bitcoin just as they would a stock or an index fund. Many will choose to do so with a portion of their money. More demand means higher prices. Those that own bitcoin now will welcome the news.\n\nIt is ironic that cryptocurrencies began as a way to avoid large financial institutions and regulations, but soon enough the world\u2019s largest financial companies, all of which are highly regulated, will dominate the bitcoin marketplace.\n\nThe introduction of spot bitcoin ETFs should boost prices as more people participate. Eventually, however, investors will realize that there is nothing but perceived value backing the holdings. It has no earnings and it pays no dividends. Those who buy simply hope to sell it later to someone at a higher price. That\u2019s the Greater Fool Theory. Owning bitcoin as a trade based on potential new ETFs is fine. But long term you can count me out.\n\nDavid Vomund is an Incline Village-based Independent Investment Advisor. Information is found at http://www.VomundInvestments.com or by calling 775-832-8555.

        "title": "Coinbase CFO on Trading Volume, Spot Bitcoin ETF - Bloomberg",
        "content": "00:00\n\nHow are you thinking about that going forward? Because that's been a declining trend. It has. We saw record low volatility is the lowest we've seen since we measured it in 2016. And when we see low volatility, we tend to see less active trading of our advanced trade clients, of our markets, which are our most advanced traders. I would note that these tend to be our lower revenue customers, but it's a broader trend that we're seeing. What I'm pleased to show, though, is even in these very low volatility environments with low trading volume, we generated $181 million of adjusted EBIT. We generated only a $2 million loss of net income. And so we're very proud of our financial performance. Despite the low volatility and the low trading volume that we saw this quarter for the current quarter than the quarter, that Coinbase can claim profitability with just how much you have been able to kind of keep a handle on the bottom line. I think it's really important to share the beginning of this year we said that we were wanting to build a company that could generate positive adjusted EBITDA in all market environments and we're very proud that now for those three quarters in a row, we generated more than $100 million of positive adjusted EBITDA. This is a change from when we went public when we were trying to generate profits through a cycle. And we really listen to the market and we brought down our expenses. We're proud of being a more financially disciplined company. We're offering with a lot more efficiency now and being able to deliver the financial results that we did this quarter. To the extent that the environment stays somewhat muted, do you think that Coinbase is going to have to tighten its belt further? And should you have to, where does that come from? It's a good question. Again, our goal right now is to generate positivity in all market conditions and we are pleased that we were able to do so this quarter. We also think it's important to continue investing in new technologies in the future of crypto. We have a three phase and product strategy that we are excited about, which is continuing to invest in utility, international expansion, growing new innovative products and services. We just watched derivatives this quarter, which we think is going to be an area that will continue to see investments in growth in coming quarters. And so given the financial performance, no, we're not looking to make a significant change to our expenses in Q4. And we say that in our shareholder letter about what our outlook is in the near term. However, we are always looking at the market and looking for what are the catalyst for growth, what are the risks and adjusting accordingly. Well, let's talk about one of the big potential calls in the market right now, and that is, of course, potential US spot Bitcoin ETF approval. Obviously that has ignited a rally in everything crypto. And I want to talk to you about what that could mean about Coinbase's business because a few of the more bearish analysts out there have argued that that might actually be a negative for Coinbase because it could further pull trading away from your platform. So I think what is loud and clear is that investors would like access to crypto and you see that with the excitement around these Bitcoin ETFs. So we believe this is going to be additive, this is going to be new capital that enters the market because today certain types of investors, whether that's pensions or registered investment advisors, they don't have the ability to access Bitcoin for their customers. So we believe this is going to bring new capital to the market. We will also benefit with our platform of just added interest in Bitcoin more broadly will benefit because we are going to be selected as a infrastructure provider to some of the issuers in this space where we can then custody and provide that service to the market. But overall, we think this grows, the pie grows, the interest in Bitcoin overall, and that's going to be a net benefit to the ecosystem in US. Well, just to push back, it's interesting to read this note coming from Barclays, basically asking the question is the offset that people don't need to trade Bitcoin on Coinbase because they can just buy the ETF in a typical brokerage account? I mean, is that a potential, a possibility that you're preparing for? We prepare for all sorts of possibilities, but that's not what we expect to happen. We think that there's a lot of people who are crypto enthusiasts who are looking for the underlying access to the spot asset to be able to use that in different ways. And it'll have the option of selling it, buying it, sending it, receiving it, using it in different defi applications. And so we think that there's still going to be a lot of interest in the rec spot and we think that we're going to see new market participants who want to hold this alongside other securities or other assets in an investment portfolio. Alicia, I got to ask you about the SEC's lawsuit against Coinbase. The regulators have indicated that they want to see exchanges operate separately from brokerages, custodians, that kind of thing. What kinds of discussions has Coinbase had internally about potentially splitting up the company? Is that something that you're actively planning for? So I think it's really important to note that that all comes around security tokens. And again, Coinbase would love to list security targets for today. We do not list security tokens on our platform because we haven't got to a place where we understand the market structure rules visibly how one would trade security tokens on a platform, and what those rules of market structure are to the questions that you're asking. So we like to be we'd like to be a participant in that market. We would like to be able to be a vocal contributor to how that market structure should evolve. But today that is not something that we offer. Please help me understand what's happening for assets outside of Bitcoin. We've talked before about the uncertainty that other crypto assets have relative to Bitcoin and Ethereum, but if you look at the transaction revenue of other crypto assets at Coinbase, it's jumped pretty meaningfully from the second quarter to the third quarter. What's contributing to that? So as we said before, there's episodic events that cause outside trading in any single asset at a point in time and we did see some certain assets that had elevated trading in Q3. These are be Q2 and prior quarters. Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to be the top two assets traded on our platform. And for the first time this quarter, we did disclose that USDC exceeded 10% of trading volume. And so that was a high transaction volume on the platform during the quarter. I think it's also important to note that all of these things can evolve like different quarters. We've seen different events that cause outside trading volume and this is something that we continue to support the breadth of assets in the ecosystem, but it goes back and forth. But Ether and Bitcoin continue to be the largest contributors to trading volume. Really quickly. We have only about 30 seconds here, Alicia, but the stablecoin revenue, how consistent do you see it moving along? How consistent do we see? How consistent do you see growth yet? Stablecoins are a really important part of the overall ecosystem, and it's an area that we continue to invest in on our platform. We did see a growth in native Stablecoin assets on our platform in the quarter, so we're holding more usdc for our customers in Q3 than we did in Q2. And we've integrated into our international exchange. We're offering now rewards for people which give them the ability to earn rewards while they're are in a passive situation, while they're waiting to trade."

        "content": "Congratulations, Texas! Forget your poor rankings compared to other states for education, health services and environmental quality.\n\nYou are now number one!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s official. Texas is the bitcoin mining capital not only of the United States, but also of the entire world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout half of all bitcoin mining in the U.S. is Texas-based, and that\u2019s enough to propel Texas to the No. 1 world leader.\n\nWatchdog Alert Are you a taxpayer in Texas? The Watchdog has your back. SIGN UP Or with: Google Facebook By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nFor some reason, many Texans are not celebrating. Rather, they\u2019re confused, wondering if this is a good thing, especially with its impact on our fragile ERCOT-run electricity grid.\n\nThey are fearful of grid strain and anxious about the lack of transparency in the new industry. They are baffled by the millions of dollars of profit some mining companies earn when they sell electricity back. Companies can also earn millions of dollars in energy credits by voluntarily shutting down in a crisis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s a sampling of The Watchdog\u2019s mail:\n\n\u201cWatchdog, we have heard nothing about these enormous electricity consumers being asked and complying with closing their operations during this 2023 exceptionally hot summer. Many of us have been asked to conserve electricity.\u201d \u2014 Sid Harris of Richardson.\n\n\u201c[Bitcoin miners earning millions by selling back unused power, often at a profit] is inexcusable while we Texans are faced with skyrocketing electric bills. How about using millions to shore up the system for all of us, rather than lining the pockets of energy hogs?\u201d \u2014 Janice White of Southlake.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[I\u2019m worried about] all the mining companies pouring into Texas and draining the electrical power we have, as well as overloading our power grid. ERCOT just seems to be wheeling and dealing with these companies.\u201d \u2014 Charles Coleman of Euless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Undue attention\u2019\n\nRecent headlines about companies making big profits \u201cattracted undue attention,\u201d says Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, the trade group for the new industry.\n\n\u201cBitcoin miner pockets $7 million. Firm rewarded for cutting power during heat wave.\u201d \u2013 The Dallas Morning News\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTexas paid a Bitcoin miner $31.7 million to use less electricity during the state\u2019s hottest month.\u201d \u2013 Texas Monthly\n\nStory behind headlines\n\nYes, ERCOT paid Riot Platforms $7.4 million for reserves for cutting power in August. This was done, I\u2019m told by members of the industry, to support grid reliability during the summer heat wave. The company also sold about $24 million of pre-purchased unused energy back to its provider, TXU.\n\nFor power shutdowns in September, the company received $2.5 million. Plus, the company earned $11 million in energy credits for future bills.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Colorado-based company makes public disclosures because it\u2019s a publicly traded company. Riot\u2019s biggest plant in Texas is in Rockdale. It\u2019s building another data center in Corsicana.\n\nHere is what\u2019s fascinating about this. By voluntarily curtailing its power usage during the heat wave in September, Riot said it doubled the revenue it would have received from mining.\n\nAs Dallas Morning News staffer Irving Mejia-Hilario reported, \u201cRiot mined 362 bitcoin [in September], but the money it earned from its deals with ERCOT and TXU equates to approximately 511 bitcoin, the company said.\u201d\n\nBratcher says, \u201cThese market mechanisms are not unique to bitcoin miners. Bitcoin miners do not receive any special treatment or subsidies from the state of Texas, ERCOT or anyone else.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe says all industrial and commercial industries can sell back unused power. One difference is where it might take a manufacturing facility hours to shut down in an emergency, a bitcoin miner can pull the plug in several minutes.\n\nHe says reliable, constant power usage by bitcoin miners brings stability to the grid, especially during low-demand times of day.\n\nBitcoin mining accounts for about 2-3% of industrial power usage in the state. That\u2019s why Bratcher says those headlines flabbergasted him.\n\nFor all industrial usage, ERCOT\u2019s payouts were close to $1 billion for August, he said, with bitcoin mining a very small part of that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMining, he said, brings to a community tax revenue, jobs and power consumption that electricity companies possibly couldn\u2019t sell.\n\nLee Bratcher is President of the Texas Blockchain Council. (WATCHDOGSUN_2023_1105 / Courtesy of Texas Blockchain Cou)\n\nThe China concern\n\nU.S. and Texas growth in mining has China to thank. China banned bitcoin operations, causing companies and investors to find new locales.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTexas, with its permissive regulatory environment, tax incentives and cheap power available to miners, launched a successful campaign to lure miners here.\n\nThe New York Times found that Chinese nationals are among the owners of U.S.-based companies. In Texas, two companies \u2014 Bitdeer and Poolin \u2014 are Chinese-owned, the Times reported.\n\nI asked Bitdeer about this. A spokesman said Bitdeer is not a Chinese company. \u201cBitdeer was founded in and is headquartered in Singapore,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are a company with global operations, and we are glad to have had a presence in Texas since 2018. Also, as a Nasdaq-listed company we are subjected to the same regulatory scrutiny as any other company listed in the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny indication that we are influenced by or connected to the Chinese government is false and wrong.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Times reported an owner of the company left China to set up shop in Singapore.\n\nThe Texas Infrastructure Protection Act prohibits citizens of China, Iran, North Korea and Russia from any connection with critical infrastructure. Bratcher cited a 2022 Texas attorney general ruling that said as long as foreigners from those countries do not have \u201cdirect or remote access to or control of critical infrastructure\u201d there\u2019s no violation of the act.\n\nThe law was signed by Gov. Greg Abbott in 2021.\n\nI wrote to the governor\u2019s office asking if he is concerned about Chinese ownership in relation to the law. The Watchdog didn\u2019t hear back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLack of transparency\n\nWhen Denton Municipal Electric signed a contract with Core Scientific to lease space at its plant for a small-scale mining operation, city officials expected millions of dollars for city coffers.\n\nCore Scientific filed for bankruptcy. While it\u2019s still operating in Denton, expected earnings have dropped.\n\nI criticized the secrecy of the contract between city and company. Details of the plan were redacted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t know what the kWh rate Core Scientific pays DME for electricity. But during my research for this Watchdog report, I found that some mining companies have long-term contracts with their electricity providers to pay as low as 2 cents a kWh. Must be nice.\n\nIn the city of Denton's 2021 agreement with crypto mining company Core Scientific, key details are redacted.\n\nScrutiny? What scrutiny?\n\nHere\u2019s proof how unregulated the industry is: It wasn\u2019t until September that bitcoin companies were even required to register with the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s a long time to get such a free ride from regulatory scrutiny. Oh, no. Wait. What scrutiny?\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nERCOT has convened a task force to consider rule changes that could beef up requirements for all industrial and commercial customers, including bitcoin miners.\n\nUsers would have to disclose information about their energy usage and power shutdowns. Bratcher says the rule change could make the shutdown process \u201cmore methodical.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReader Bob Gibson of Carrollton tells me, \u201cAs much as I am glad to see new methodology for grid reliability with these developments, I don\u2019t see any way the consumer is going to be getting any break in their rates because of it.\u201d\n\nEnergy analyst company Wood Mackenzie writes in a report that \u201cby our calculations, bitcoin mining already raises electricity costs for non-mining Texans by $1.8 billion per year or 4.7%. These figures are conservative.\u201d\n\nStill to be decided: Will consumers benefit?\n\nIf matters go as they have been in this long-running state electricity crisis, who will pay the biggest cost?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou will.\n\nBecome a citizen of Watchdog Nation.\n\nJoin Dave Lieber and learn to be a super-consumer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWatchdog newsletter: Sign up for The Watchdog\u2019s FREE weekly newsletter to keep up: click here.\n\nSubscribe: PLEASE support The Watchdog\u2019s brand of straightforward journalism designed to save you time, money and aggravation.

The difficulty became apparent from the outset as Jones stumbled through each question.\n\nAfter Jones passed on the first question, Keiser said, \u201cYou\u2019ve lost this quiz already; you can\u2019t even get a simpler question than that.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 @MaxKeiser gives Alex Jones a simple 5 question #Bitcoin quiz for 10,000 #BTC's ($350,000,000 USD) \ud83e\udd2f pic.twitter.com/3XL6DXJQbk\n\n\u2014 Crypto News Alerts \ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf99 (@CryptoNewsYes) October 31, 2023\n\nThe questions presented by Keiser during the Bitcoin challenge encompassed key aspects of the cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nThey included questions about the total number of Bitcoins in existence, the frequency of difficulty adjustments, the core hashing algorithm\u2019s name, the average block formation rate, and whether Craig Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto \u2014 the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin.\n\nWill The SEC Finally Approve Long-Awaited Bitcoin Spot ETF?

        "title": "Bitcoin's Price Rallied 28% in October as Crypto Rally Widened - CoinDesk",
        "content": "Bitcoin gained roughly 28% in October. Its strongest showing since January as the crypto rally widened. Joining us now to discuss this coin desk indices. Head of research, Todd Groth, welcome back, Todd October. Indeed for Bitcoin historically, it's been a very seasonally positive month for for the crypto assets, Bitcoin up 28 Ethereum up eight broad CM I coin desk market index of about 21. So it was really out performance of a Bitcoin um underperformance on a relative basis of Ethereum, but pretty broad gains indeed across the market. Let's take a look at some of the sectors we break down this coin desk coin desk breaks down into roughly six sectors. Here. Talk about that. Uh Yeah, so uh on a relative basis, uh again, had uh uh Bitcoin and with that, it's in the currency sector uh that uh that was the outperformer as well as the computing. That was I apologize. Uh Bitcoin is the largest component of that currency sector. Correct? Exactly. So these sectors are market cap weighted and because of the market capitalization of Bitcoin relative to others in the currency sector, it really has a large impact on that sector which, which, which drove it to be the relative performance gainer of across the sectors. Computing was up 23 as well. The biggest component there is chain link which was also up 41 on the on the month as well. Where is that on currencies or computing? Uh No, that's a smart contract platform that was a relative under performer only up nine and then D five D five sector as well was up one digitization slightly slightly negative down to really almost all sectors positive for the month. So if you think about it broadly, the gains were shared across the whole space but definitely currency and computing holding larger gains due to the presence of Bitcoin and chain link within computing, correct me if I'm wrong. But I think this is one of the first times in a while that we've seen so much green when we look at these sectors, how does this compare to previous months? Uh Yeah, it's, it's uh the correlations across across tokens have uh have have have tightened a bit. So really we're having much more trading like the like a whole sector up and down. And that's, that's partially because of Bitcoin. Bitcoin being the largest. If you look at from market cap weighted lens, it's going to contribute more. But it's also it's a bit of the gravity of the whole market as what we see across the cycle. Generally. Bitcoin leads tokens upwards through a cycle, then once you get to closer to the peak of the cycle, then you have investors make some side bets away from Bitcoin into the alt coin season as it's referred to. So it's just seeing that the strong upward upside correlation Bitcoin sort of dragging up the space currently. 11 alt coin Solana, formerly known as Sam's coin. Yeah, I mean, it's not, it was never actually the name, of course, but that was definitely the nickname. Uh It, it's, it's been rallying for a while now. Not just in October September 2. I there have been some times here where uh we, we're, we're seeing kind of AAA resurrection of Solana even though it's far down from where it was at its peak. So can you explain what's going on here? Is it a dead cat bounce or what's the excitement now around Solana? If there is any real excitement? Yeah, it's, it's, it's just been, it's a combination of sentiment getting better because sentiment was so bad earlier. It started last year, for instance, with the F TX collapse last fall. I can't believe it's been a year now. So initially it was, oh, here's, here's some of FX tokens, here's a Sams Token. It, it's going to be an orphaned project that no one will build on. Well, in January, February, we saw a fairly big rebound as people were selling off at the end of the year to harvest some of those losses. And then, so you had sort of a reversal initially. And then over time, it's the network, the community is still building, it is still growing. And I think the combination of showing that there is underlying support, the community is still thriving. It's not what it used to be, but it is, it continues to build. And II, I almost think that this, what happened in October was with the FTX trial, there was a bit of a, as a risk premium, you know, sort of like what, you know, what, what if there was something that was disclosed during the, during the process that might have a negative impact on the token? I think as we've kind of gotten to near the end of the trial, investors are realizing that that sort of the F TX SBF Association with Salon is a bit of a thing of the past and, and with that, they are still holding developer conferences, people are still building on it and it doesn't seem to be going away. It's almost, it's almost better now because in itself being an orphan project, it doesn't have an association anymore going forward. So I think that's actually to the benefit of the community. If we zoom out now, how would you characterize the broader macroeconomic environment? Sure. Yeah, it's challenging out there in the equity market was down for the month, both the S and P the tech heavy NASDAQ bonds down too. Uh You know, I just searched this morning. I like to, I like to look at what a balanced equity bond portfolio would do since a lot of investors, most investors, if you don't, if you don't configure your 401 by default, you're put into a balanced stock bond fund. That's been down 2% this month, down 7% over the last three months. It's this idea of this traditional stock bond portfolio mix. It's a bit broken now with rising yields with valuations fairly high across the equity market. So investors are looking for what, what real assets can I can I can I put my money into gold for the month. Gold was up nine. So you know, Bitcoin, Bitcoin up multiples of that, but both in a similar direction. Um also positive that Bitcoin is decoupling from both equities and interest rates. I know earlier earlier this year when we saw interest rates rise be, oh no, that's going to be bad for Bitcoin or are the dollars rising? That's bad for Bitcoin. It seems like now we coupled from both equities and equity risk sentiment as well as interest rates. So that's a very positive development as well. Is that long term though, I mean, is it or is this, has this been a short term change in in correlation for at least uh due to other factors that might not necessarily be interest rate related? And at the end of the day, crypto remains particularly Bitcoin. The market cap of Bitcoin is smaller than many companies on the S and P 500. So, are there other factors involved in how people invest in crypto that might not be macro related that might be very specific to moving money around, for instance, has been charged? And um I is this is sort of trying to read too much into the risk uh into whether or not the risk is no longer the, the story with crypto. That, that, that's a great question. You know, we, we are all, all the price sectors has been on fairly low volume. I think what we really tell as whether or not we've decoupled is if, you know, unfortunately, if we have a big risk off event, where will the, where will that knee jerk response go of investors? Where will they flee to? Will it be crypto? It could be the volatility of crypto has decreased again, similar similar to the off of low volume. So you take that with a grain of salt. Um But yeah, I think that's, that's, that's a great question. I think with the, with the, with the Israeli Gaza conflict that was showing a bit of event risk, which was positive for gold and Bitcoin did rally sort of during that and after that on that. But it's also, it's also been clouded with the, with the, uh with the spot ETF the, the, the march towards the spot ETF also more, more shoutouts from large investors in TRD, Larry Fink, Mohammed El Arian was even saying Bitcoin is an alternative to bonds. Stanley Druckenmiller also, I don't own Bitcoin, but I should. Um so he, he said that and, and I look at that and I'm like, well, OK, as an investor, you, you, you try to remove your bias of previous uh returns because you have to kind of always look forward into what the investment will bring in the future. So for him to say that and not act, what would the Stanley but in all seriousness, what would, what would stop him from looking forward and saying there's too much risk on the table and, and, and I think the other thing too, as you mentioned, some of the the factors there are major players that you just mentioned, Iran and Russia, notably uh players in, in crypto, whether whether we like to admit it or not that are involved at least on some level with uh uh with the price of, of things such as Bitcoin is that, do, do you think that that's kind of a thought that some investors have uh kind of ghoulishly if you will, that these players will, will act in Bitcoin? Oh A as as in because some state actors that are, are have less than stellar reputations are also in Bitcoin. They don't want to be associated as investors, they do want to be associated because you know, people are degenerates. Um um, and that's a badge of honor and crypto. Uh But, but it's this idea that, you know what if these, if these guys are going to, if they're going to try to fund some of their uh war using Bitcoin, let's jump in on that train. Oh, yeah. Well, I mean, it, it does bring up because Bitcoin gold, there are only a few ways to kind of invest in non sovereign and non sovereign denominated assets. So in, in that sense, it is a bit of a of an escape valve from, from what continues to be kind of increasing debt and debt interest rate burdens in the developed economies. Yeah, it is, it is back to your comment. It is interesting that, you know, someone like Dr and Miller who I it it's, you know, I would put pass to easily be able to invest in Bitcoin, but just sort of that passing comment I should is interesting. Um But yeah, I think as unfortunately, uh if, if political strife increases more uncertainty increases, it's going to be viewed as a, as a, as a a fungible global hedge is to to at least have some in crypto. We've seen that in Argentina Turkey, any, any sort of country with a weak, weaker currency has is having greater Bitcoin adoption. So it is in some sense that sort of that passport, international passport of value as gold is. But you know, if it's gold physical. Well, you got to lug those bars around. So it makes a little less than ideal of moving money across borders, Todd. We just saw the Bitcoin trend indicator. While you were speaking, we also have the ether trend indicator to throw up on the screen, talk about, talk to us about what we are seeing here. So most most of October, we saw a strong positive indication from Bitcoin trends and that's just on the back of the strong price action of the asset. Well, we had a bit of a neutral, initially, initially negative, a slight negative, neutral. Now it's a slight positive on Ether. So it's interesting that we are seeing that Bitcoin kind of run away from Ethereum over the last few weeks. Now both have positive trends, albeit Bitcoin has a stronger trend currently. So it would be interesting to see that sort of that bit e spread to see if we, if we come back to kind of more more average average levels. Um kind of with that Bitcoin dominance is now even even higher than it was over the summer. We're now 40 54% in October in the previous high over the last two years was 52 in June. So increased, increased enthusiasm on a relative basis for Bitcoin. And I think really, it's on the back of much more, much more, much more shout outs across, across the traditional financial markets and that enthusiasm for this body"

        "content": "The bitcoin white paper was published 15 years ago by Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThe paper outlined the blockchain technology that would underpin a decentralized payment system.\n\nThe pseudonymous author has never been identified, though there are theories as to their identity.\n\nNEW LOOK Sign up to get the inside scoop on today\u2019s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business \u2014 delivered daily.

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the end of October 2008, an unidentified individual or group on people under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper to a mailing list called Metzdowd titled, \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.\"\n\nThe paper introduced bitcoin as a currency and explained the foundations of blockchain technology. It was a short paper, just nine pages long, written in an academic style, with an abstract, introduction, and conclusion \u2014 but it introduced the world to what would become the biggest cryptocurrency by market value today and laid the groundwork for the cashless payment system that is underpinned by the blockchain.\n\n\"A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution,\" the paper reads.\n\nThe paper has made its mark, but intriguingly, nobody today has figured out who Satoshi Nakamoto is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheories say that Nakamoto is probably from the UK because they used British English spelling for words like \"favour\". It is also assumed that Nakamoto is a billionaire, by tracing the amount of bitcoin presumably held in wallets linked to Nakamoto.\n\nThe last time Nakamoto was heard from was in April 26, 2011, when they sent an email to fellow bitcoin developers, Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen.\n\nOther rumored identities have also cropped up over the years. Newsweek in 2014 claimed someone named Dorian Nakamoto was the crypto's creator, though he denied this. Australian computer scientist Craig Wright meanwhile has publicly stated that he is bitcoin's inventor, though this has been disputed. Programmer Nick Szabo has also been proposed as the author's true identity.\n\nNo one individual has been proven to be Satoshi Nakamoto and other theories claim they are most likely a group of people who collectively came up with the idea for what would eventually become the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2014, Nakamoto made their final post on a forum saying, \"I am not Dorian Nakamoto.\"\n\nWhat's in the white paper\n\nWhile bitcoin was officially launched in January 2009, in the 2008 paper Satoshi Nakamoto laid out the fundamental framework of the blockchain-based payment system.\n\n\"What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.\"\n\nTrust was the biggest issue the electronic transaction system was supposed to solve. Instead of relying on a central authority to verify transactions, Nakamoto wanted to create a decentralized system, in which verification did not rely on a single entity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNakamoto proposed a currency where a coin would be defined by a \"chain of digital signatures.\" Every time a transaction took place, the payer had to \"sign\" off on it. Each transaction would be broadcasted to a network of receivers and payers, who would verify the order of the transactions, which is done via complex and energy-intensive cryptographic computer work. Whoever verifies a certain transaction first would post their \"block\" in the chain of other verified \"blocks,\" and be rewarded with bitcoin.\n\nIt wasn't written in the white paper, but the system is designed so that there are only 21 million bitcoins that will ever exist. Because the amount of coins that enter circulation is finite, every four years, the amount of bitcoins a miner is rewarded with is reduced by half. The next halving event will occur around the middle of 2024, which will reduce the reward to miners to 3.125 bitcoins for each verified transaction block.\n\nThere are currently 19.5 million tokens in the market. As more bitcoin is mined, verifying the transactions requires more and more time, energy, and power. Experts predict that the last bitcoin will be mined in 2140.\n\nSince the white paper's publication, the crypto market has surged in value and cultural relevance, and the total market value of all crypto coins is about $1.2 trillion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe market is currently awaiting on the approval from regulators of the first ever ETF that would track the spot price of bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin on Wednesday was trading around $34,300."

But this year, we could see a far more significant rally as the United States Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission and BlackRock line up to deliver a bonanza of holiday cheer.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) finished its penultimate meeting of 2023 on Wednesday, and it decided to hold interest rates steady. As we know, U.S. inflation has been tamed from a high of 9.1% in June 2022 to its current level of 3.7% thanks to the Fed\u2019s aggressive interest rate hiking cycle that brought the Federal Funds Rate to 5.25-5.5% \u2014 its highest level since 2001.\n\nHowever, while this campaign has been unquestionably successful, markets remain deeply concerned about the potential of higher rates, or even rates sustained at this level, to trigger a recession in the U.S. The Fed also now shares these concerns as it softens to some degree against inflation.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin is evolving into a multiasset network\n\nShould the next Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation reading on Nov. 14 show a move downward, we can expect to see money flooding into risk assets as investors anticipate the next interest rate decision to be a cut. This will, of course, have a positive impact on equity markets, and even bond markets as yields fall and the back end of the yield curve flattens.\n\nGUNDLACH: THINK CPI WILL COME DOWN BASED ON INFLATION MODEL \u2014 *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) November 1, 2023\n\nCrypto markets will follow suit, with Bitcoin (BTC) remaining strongly correlated to main markets. What will provide an extra shot in the arm, though, will be the approval of the first U.S.-based Bitcoin spot ETF \u2014 which is likely to come before Jan. 10, as J.P. Morgan predicts. This is underlined by the excitement that rumors of the approval of BlackRock\u2019s application have generated over the past few weeks, which sent Bitcoin back up to $35,000: a level it hasn\u2019t enjoyed since the pre-Terra Luna days of 2022.\n\nEventual approval will provide further impetus for Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), and large swathes of altcoin markets. However, if investors are following the old adage, \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the fact\u201d, it may not be huge. We might even see a small dip before a more sustained rally. There is little doubt, however, that approval will be positive for cryptocurrency. Indeed, longer-term it has the potential to be the greatest driver of crypto markets since the conditions created by the Covid pandemic saw BTC top $60,000 in 2021.\n\nRelated: Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s trial is telling a story of classic financial deceit\n\nPotential spanners in the works include higher inflation in the U.S. before the end of the year, and potentially a ramping up of tensions between Israel and Palestine. Either of these could put the brakes on an end-of-year Santa rally \u2014 but that does not seem to be the direction of travel right now.\n\nIndeed, Bitcoin has already enjoyed quite a rally this year. While the fallout from the FTX crash in November 2022 saw BTC fall to the $15,000 range and start 2023 at a paltry price of slightly more than $16,000, its level today of $34,000 to $35,000 represents growth of more than 100%. Of course, it\u2019s only the very smart or lucky traders who ever manage to take advantage of Bitcoin\u2019s extreme volatility. Year-on-year, many crypto investors are still nursing losses.\n\nFor FTX investors, for example, while there are now hopes some will get their Bitcoin, Ether, and other tokens back, most will face somewhat of a Pyrrhic victory as they stare down the barrel of 60% to 70% losses. This accounts for the generally pessimistic mood in the crypto market, which would otherwise look like the winner of 2023.\n\nAs we approach the end of the year, then, it would do all of us well to take a step back and view Bitcoin and crypto markets with fresh eyes. Even if we don\u2019t get a much anticipated and, perhaps, deserved Santa rally, we can celebrate the fact that crypto has survived another challenging year and is ending on a high.\n\nLucas Kiely is chief investment officer of Yield App, where he oversees investment portfolio allocations and leads the expansion of a diversified investment product range.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBased on historical trends, BTC may experience a significant price increase.\n\nMatrixport head of research noted that Bitcoin could finish the year with a strong rise.\n\nWhat caused BTC\u2019s recent rally, and where will it arrive at the end of 2023?\n\nA well-known adage on Wall Street is that unless there is an outside influence, a bull market will often continue to go forward.\n\nAccording to crypto services company Matrixport, Bitcoin has historically lived up to the proverb based on Sir Isaac Newton\u2019s third law of motion and may do so once more, reaching as high as $56,000 by the end of the year.\n\n\u2018Santa Claus Rally\u2019 Could Lead Bitcoin to $56,000\n\nMarkus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, wrote a note to clients on Thursday that stated:\n\n\u201cIf Bitcoin is up at least +100% by this time of the year, then there is a +71% chance or five in seven that Bitcoin would finish the year higher with average year-end rallies of +65%.\u201d \u201cWe could call the six to seven weeks from early November to mid-December Bitcoin\u2019s Santa Claus Rally, as the cryptocurrency typically reaches its peak by December 18th.\u201d\n\nCurrently trading over $35,000, Bitcoin has increased by 114% year to date as of this writing. The remarkable increase may be explained by a number of factors, such as haven demand, spot ETF optimism, and theories that the Federal Reserve\u2019s cycle of liquidity tightening has peaked.\n\nBitcoin is up more than 100% to start the year. I joined @SquawkCNBC this morning to discuss why investors are interested in the decentralized currency amid the chaos and uncertainty of the modern world. pic.twitter.com/rUNy9oAT8u \u2014 Pomp \ud83c\udf2a (@APompliano) October 25, 2023\n\nBy year\u2019s end, Bitcoin might trade above $65,000 thanks to the anticipated 65% price increase.\n\nThielen added that, considering these statistics, Bitcoin still presents an opportunity for upward growth, with the potential for a year-end rally of +65% that would bring prices to $56,000.\n\nThe graph displays Bitcoin\u2019s historical performance for the first ten and last two months of each year between 2010 and 2022.\n\nHistorical BTC Trends Hint at Year-End Surge\n\nBitcoin has gained at least 100% in the first ten months in seven of the last twelve years. In the last eight weeks, Bitcoin has increased in value by an average of 65% over the past seven years.\n\n\u201cWhen Bitcoin is up at least by 50% by the end of October, there is, on average, a 78% chance that Bitcoin will advance even more into year-end. Bitcoin rallied by another 68% until year-end on seven of nine previous occasions. This analysis is based on thirteen years of bitcoin history,\u201d Thielen stated.\n\nIt\u2019s important to emphasize that while historical data can provide insights, it doesn\u2019t guarantee future outcomes. However, the likelihood of history repeating itself remains significant, particularly in anticipation of the upcoming bullish mining reward halving scheduled for early next year.\n\nFed\u2019s Policy Also Boosts BTC\n\nFurthermore, it seems that the US Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to maintain interest rates between 5.25% to 5.5% validated the market\u2019s optimistic attitude that has prevailed since October.\n\nThe chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, reaffirmed the bank\u2019s \u201cstrong commitment\u201d to reducing inflation. Powell stated during the meeting that recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a strong pace \u2013 well above earlier expectations.\n\nWhile maintaining a restrictive monetary policy for the foreseeable future, the majority of committee members think that another rate hike is necessary before the year ends.\n\nAfter the FOMC meeting, the price of Bitcoin started to rise again, rising beyond $35,000 to trade at a record high for the year. BTC is currently trading at $35,383, up by 3.3% over the previous day."

        "content": "With a renewed rally, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has surged by almost 23% in the last month. This is not unusual, with cryptocurrencies having a reputation for skyrocketing in quick time. Bitcoin is likely to trade above $50,000 in the next few months. Besides exposure to quality cryptocurrencies, consider buying some of the best crypto stocks for robust returns.\n\nThe news of the possibility of a spot ETF for Bitcoin will likely be a key upside catalyst. Additionally, Bitcoin\u2019s halving is due in 2024 and will have a positive impact on the digital asset.\n\nFurther, the rise in geopolitical tensions has supported the flow of funds into Bitcoin. If these factors were insufficient, I would add that potential rate ruts are due next year. A weak dollar is positive for all risky asset classes.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet\u2019s discuss three crypto stocks to buy at current levels.\n\nCoinbase Global (COIN)\n\nA Bitcoin rests on top of a computer with the Coinbase (COIN) logo and a trading chart.\n\nSource: Nadezda Murmakova / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) stock has already surged by 129% year-to-date. However, the rally from oversold levels does not make COIN stock expensive. I would bet on another 100% returns if Bitcoin touched $50,000.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Coinbase is among the top five centralized exchanges globally. The company stands to benefit if there is a cryptocurrency bull market. Trading and speculation will likely increase, translating into higher income for Coinbase.\n\nIn March 2023, Coinbase initiated an international expansion drive in six continents. This is important to mention as the company has been making steady business progress during the cryptocurrency bear market. Global expansion and the continued addition of new digital assets to the platform are other factors that will boost trading volumes.\n\nCoinbase ended Q2 2023 with cash and equivalents of $5.5 billion. With adjusted EBITDA turning positive, the company has high financial flexibility to make aggressive investments for growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT)\n\nIn this photo illustration, the Riot Platforms (RIOT) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nRiot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) is possibly the best Bitcoin mining stock to consider at current levels. After touching highs of $20.7 in July, RIOT stock has corrected to $9.8. This presents a good accumulation opportunity. If Bitcoin touches $50,000 in the next few quarters, RIOT stock will likely triple.\n\nFrom a fundamental perspective, Riot is attractive, with $510 million in cash and digital assets. Further, the company has a zero-debt balance sheet that provides high financial flexibility.\n\nRiot also has ambitious expansion plans. As of Q3 2023, the company reported a hash rate capacity of 10.7EH/s. The company expects to expand capacity to 20.1EH/s by Q4 2024 and further to 35.4EH/s in 2025.\n\nThis will likely translate into robust revenue and cash flow upside if Bitcoin remains in an uptrend. As the company\u2019s financial flexibility increases further, there is a strong case for diversification-driven growth.\n\nBitfarms (BITF)\n\nBitcoin and crypto mining farm. Big data center. High tech server computers at work. Bitfarms (BITF) mines crypto.\n\nSource: PHOTOCREO Michal Bednarek / Shutterstock.com\n\nI am also tempted to talk about a penny crypto stock to buy as Bitcoin trends higher. Bitfarms (NASDAQ:BITF) is another attractive Bitcoin miner that seems poised to deliver multibagger returns. On a very conservative basis, BITF stock will double from current levels. However, I would not be surprised with 3x to 5x returns if Bitcoin is at $50,000.\n\nAs of September, Bitfarms reported a mining capacity of 6.1EH/s with a year-on-year growth of 45%. The important point to note is that Bitfarms reported a liquidity buffer of $65 million for Q2 2023. Additionally, the company expects to be debt free by February 2024. Therefore, there is high financial flexibility to pursue aggressive expansion.\n\nAnother positive is that the company is a low-cost Bitcoin miner. For Q2 2023, Bitfarms reported direct cost of production at $15,700 per Bitcoin. Assuming a scenario where Bitcoin trades above $50,000, the company will be positioned to report healthy EBITDA and cash flows. A big rally from current levels, therefore, seems entirely likely.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nDerivatives drove the previous BTC rise and will likely drive the next.\n\nOptions trading data points to a $36,000 Gamma Squeeze zone.\n\nChart analysis supports this assumption.\n\nBitcoin experienced a parabolic surge, hitting a new yearly peak of $35,100 on October 24. However, this meteoric rise was succeeded by a period of stagnation, and for over a week, the market has been characterized by sideways movement. As the market settled into this calm phase, many wondered what might be on the horizon for this leading cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile analysts often turn to chart analysis for insights, when it falls short, they explore on-chain data and liquidity. Alex Thorn is one such analyst who recently outlined a potential scenario in which Bitcoin\u2019s price could be gearing up for another parabolic ascent if the current price trend continues.\n\nWhat is gamma squeeze?\n\nLet\u2019s begin by delving into the concept of a gamma squeeze. This term is used to describe a phenomenon in options trading where the price movement compels trading in the underlying asset. Similar to the dynamics of a short squeeze or a long squeeze, in which price levels trigger actions due to liquidity positions, it forces prior buyers to sell and vice versa. What sets this apart is its relevance to options trading, where gamma and delta principles are essential. To grasp gamma fully, one must first understand delta. Delta measures the expected change in an option\u2019s price with a 1-point shift in the underlying asset, such as Bitcoin. For instance, if a call option possesses a delta of 0.5, the option\u2019s price will increase by 50 cents for every $1 rise in the cryptocurrency\u2019s price. Now, let\u2019s introduce gamma. Gamma plays a role in determining how delta changes with that 1-point move in the underlying asset. If gamma is 0.1, and the asset\u2019s price increases by $1, the delta will rise from 0.5 to 0.6. Think of gamma as the acceleration factor. While delta informs you about the rate of the option\u2019s price shift, gamma reveals how much that rate is accelerating or decelerating. Traders closely monitor gamma because it provides insights into how an option\u2019s value will fluctuate with shifts in the underlying asset\u2019s price. This is particularly valuable for active options traders as it aids in risk management and decision-making regarding trading strategies. Essentially, gamma is crucial for options traders, aiding in predicting price changes in asset-linked options and facilitating risk management and strategy development.\n\nBitcoin Gamma Squeeze\n\nNow that we have a solid understanding of gamma and delta and how they operate, let\u2019s explore some recent discoveries made by Alex Thorn, who serves as the Head of Firmwide Research at Galaxy.\n\nIn a X post , which has garnered the attention of 509.8K individuals, he articulated a compelling observation. Thorn mentioned that \u201cif BTCUSD ascends to the $35,750-36k range, options dealers will find themselves in the position of procuring $20 million worth of actual BTC for each 1% upward price movement. This situation has the potential to trigger significant market dynamics if we indeed approach these price levels.\n\nHe further added : \u201cWhen dealers are short gamma and price moves up, or when they are long gamma and price moves down, they need to buy spot to stay delta neutral. Last week\u2019s expiries will dampen potential explosiveness, but it\u2019s still in play.\u201d\n\nWhile not definitive, this analysis reveals key derivatives market dynamics that may exert influence soon.\n\nBitcoin Price Analysis\n\nThis theory matches our chart analysis outlook, which we published yesterday, October 30. In that analysis, we pointed out that this sideways range seen from October 24 is most likely a wave 4 started from a larger five-wave impulse.\n\nAnticipation of another higher high is on the horizon, possibly targeting $38,600 and potentially nearing $40,000. This ongoing uptrend, originating from a lower-degree impulse that began on November 21, may eventually be followed by a significant correction.\n\nThis analysis strongly suggests a high likelihood of Bitcoin surging past the $36,000 mark, potentially in a parabolic fashion. Should it reach $40,000, this would represent an additional 18% increase from the current levels.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "content": "Block\u2019s share price soared in after-hours trading after the payments company surpassed analyst expectations for its third quarter earnings, which included news of a double-digit jump in Bitcoin revenue.\n\nThe company\u2019s Bitcoin revenue grew 37.5% to $2.42 billion from $1.76 billion in the same period last year. Gross profit the company reaped from Bitcoin rose to $44 million, compared with $36 million last year.\n\nBlock also touted the value of the Bitcoin holdings in its corporate treasury, which amounted to $216 million based on market prices. The value of its holdings based on market prices was $114 million higher than the value on its books.\n\nThe discrepancy between book value and market value is due to a quirk in accounting rules (set to be changed) that require firms to record any decreases in Bitcoin price as an impairment charge, but prevents them from recognizing increases in the value of their Bitcoin holdings until the assets are sold. In the third quarter of 2023, the company did not recognize a Bitcoin impairment loss.\n\nIn total, Block\u2019s net revenue grew 24% year-over-year to $5.62 billion from $4.52 billion a year ago. Bitcoin revenue made up about 43% of total revenue. The jump in revenue that came from the cryptocurrency was fueled by strong performance of the company\u2019s CashApp product.\n\nCash App revenue grew 34% to $3.58 billion, up from $2.68 billion a year ago.\n\nBlock shares were trading at about $50, up 15% after market close on Thursday.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "content": "Business intelligence firm MicroStrategy Inc (NASDAQ:MSTR) has reported a substantial paper gain of $900 million on its stack of 158,400 Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), profiting from the recent surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price and fueled by optimism surrounding the potential approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nWhat Happened: As of now, Bitcoin is trading above $35,400. The apex cryptocurrency has confidently surpassed the $35,000 resistance level, which had previously limited its upward movement over the past two weeks.\n\nSince the third quarter, MicroStrategy, founded by Michael Saylor, has added 6,067 Bitcoin (BTC) to its holdings, with another 155 acquired in October, according to the company\u2019s November 1 results filing.\n\nAlthough the firm\u2019s revenue increased by 3% year-on-year to $129.5 million over the quarter, it recorded a net loss of $143.4 million. Notably, digital asset impairment losses and income taxes accounted for $33.6 million and $109.6 million of the total net losses, respectively.\n\nDuring the third quarter (July 1 to September 30), while Bitcoin experienced a price decline of 11.5% from $30,480 to $26,970, MicroStrategy capitalized on this downward period by purchasing the 6,067 BTC at an average price of $27,590.\n\nCurrently, MicroStrategy\u2019s BTC holdings amount to 158,245 BTC, with an original investment of $4.715 billion. The current value of the holdings stands at $5.640 billion, reflecting a 20% increase. However, had MicroStrategy invested the same amount in Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), they would now possess 3,971,678 ETH, resulting in a value of $7.40 billion, significantly higher than the current BTC holdings, data from blockchaincenter.net shows.\n\nWill The SEC Finally Approve Long-Awaited Bitcoin Spot ETF?

Don't let this chance slip away \u2013 secure early bird discounted tickets now!\n\nSee More: A Stay At The Floating Palace From James Bond's \u2018Octopussy\n\nWhy It Matters: Considering staking as an alternative approach, MicroStrategy could have earned 387,460 ETH at a 4% return. This ETH would be worth approximately $722.4 million, bringing the total value (with staking) to 4,359,138 ETH, equivalent to $8.127 billion.\n\nWhile MicroStrategy continues to benefit from the rise in Bitcoin\u2019s value, the narrative raises the question of what might happen if the company were to invest in ETH at the present moment. If MicroStrategy were to trade its BTC for ETH, it could potentially hold 3,025,059 ETH. Moreover, the annual revenue from staking this amount would amount to approximately $282 million, showcasing the significant potential returns that could be achieved.\n\nPrice Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $35,728.12, up 3.66% in the last 24 hours, according to Benzinga Pro.\n\nRead Next: Here\u2019s How Much You Should Invest In Shiba Inu Today For A $1M Payday If SHIB Hits 1 Cent?\n\n\u00a9 2023 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Bitcoin Could Notch Huge Gains Over Next Few Years - ETF Trends",
        "content": "Amid hopes that a spot bitcoin exchange traded fund or multiple versions of that product will soon debut in the U.S., the digital currency is on a torrid pace in 2023.\n\nWhat could prove even more accretive for ETFs such as the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) is the point that some cryptocurrency market observers believe this year\u2019s bitcoin rally is the start of something more substantial.\n\nNew analysis by Bernstein speculates that bitcoin, the largest digital currency by market capitalization, could be trading at $150,000 by mid-2025. The Bernstein forecast implies that digital currency could more than quadruple in the span of just 20 months. The giant of cryptocurrencies traded $35,470 as of this writing.\n\nBitcoin Rally Could Boost SATO\n\nSATO is an equity-based ETF, but its largest holding is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) , which has clear ties of its own to digital currency price action. After GBTC, the bulk of the SATO roster comprises cryptocurrency miners. Those shares are highly correlated to the assets they mine.\n\nOne way of looking at those scenarios is that, regardless of the positive or negative catalysts, SATO is levered to the digital currency\u2019s price action. That\u2019s something to consider if the aforementioned Bernstein forecast proves anywhere close to accurate.\n\n\u201cYou may not like bitcoin as much as we do, but a dispassionate view of bitcoin as a commodity suggests a turn of the cycle,\u201d noted Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani. \u201cA good idea is only as good as its timing.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, the Bernstein analysis highlights the cryptocurrency\u2019s April 2024 halving as a potential spark for the digital asset. Over its albeit brief trading history, it has often rallied in advance or following a halving. In simple terms, halvings make bitcoin mining more difficult, thus limiting the introduction of already limited supply to the market.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s hard to ignore the possible effects approval of a spot bitcoin ETF could have on the digital currency itself as well as ETFs like SATO. Traders could opt to sell the digital currency on approval news or add to those positions in anticipation of higher prices.\n\n\u201cWe expect US regulated ETFs to be the watershed moment for crypto and we expect a SEC approval by late 2023/Q1, 2024,\u201d Chhugani wrote. \u201cPost halving, we expect the bitcoin spot demand via ETFs to outstrip miner selling by 6-7 times at peak. We expect bitcoin ETFs to be equivalent to 9-10% of spot bitcoin in circulation by 2028.\u201d"

        "title": "Could Bitcoin Spark And Ethereum Potentially Be One Of The Gainers This Cycle? - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Among the many digital currencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum have particularly stood out due to their innovative technology and increasing popularity. This article will delve into why Bitcoin Spark and Ethereum could one of the gainers this cycle.\n\nEthereum - Layer Zero Potential\n\nEthereum, since its inception, has gained considerable attention due to powerful smart contracts and scalability. Experts believe that Ethereum has \u2018Layer Zero potential,\u2019 functioning as the foundation of DeFi that enables the existence of numerous other blockchains and applications to run on it.\n\nThe potential of Ethereum lies in its decentralized, secure, and scalable infrastructure for a new generation of applications. It enables the creation of smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and even other cryptocurrencies. Developers can build and launch their projects and create a thriving ecosystem of innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem. However, the Ethereum network can only process a limited number of transactions per second, leading to congestion and high fees during peak times. Once these obstacles are resolved, Ethereum is likely to be a top gainer this upcoming bull season.\n\nBitcoin Spark Fusing PoW and PoS\n\nBitcoin Spark is another contender for one of the biggest gainer this cycle, thanks to its innovative fusion of Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms. This combination aims to harness the strengths of both systems and mitigate their weaknesses, creating a more secure, efficient, and sustainable blockchain.\n\nPoW, used by Bitcoin, involves miners solving complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and create new blocks. While this system has proven secure, it is resource-intensive, leading to criticisms about its environmental impact. On the other hand, PoS, employed by Ethereum, allows coin holders to validate transactions based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to 'stake' as collateral. This system is less resource-intensive but has been criticized for potentially favoring the 'rich' who can stake more coins.\n\nBitcoin Spark's fusion of PoW and PoS aims to create a balance, offering the security of PoW with the efficiency of PoS. This innovative hybrid approach culminates in the Proof-of-Process (PoP) consensus mechanism and could make Bitcoin Spark a significant player in the cryptocurrency market, leading to substantial gains in this cycle.\n\nTraders Convinced Smartphone Mining Is The Next Big Thing\n\nThe rise of smartphone mining is another trend that traders are keeping a close eye on. As the name suggests, smartphone mining involves using smartphones to mine cryptocurrencies. This method makes mining more accessible to the masses, as it does not require expensive hardware or high energy consumption.\n\nThe potential of smartphone mining lies in its convenience and accessibility. With billions of smartphone users worldwide, the potential user base for smartphone mining is massive. Furthermore, smartphone mining apps are typically user-friendly, making it easy for even non-tech-savvy individuals to participate in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThis is where Bitcoin Spark convinces new but also veteran crypto traders to be on top of the next bull run with its innovative Spark App that will enable users to simply mine BTCS via their smartphones.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIn conclusion, the cryptocurrency market is dynamic and ever-evolving, with Bitcoin Spark and Ethereum potentially being the one of the gainers this cycle. Ethereum\u2019s Layer Zero potential and the upcoming upgrades promise a more scalable and efficient platform, while Bitcoin Spark's fusion of PoW and PoS offers a balanced and innovative approach to blockchain technology.\n\nFor more information:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register\n\nThis post was authored by an external contributor and does not represent Benzinga's opinions and has not been edited for content.

Starting with Bitcoin and Ether support, SGKB plans to expand its offerings to additional cryptocurrencies based on client demand.\n\nFounded back in 1868, St.Galler Kantonalbank is a major Swiss regional bank offering retail and commercial banking, as well as private and institutional banking. SGKB is reportedly the fifth largest bank in Switzerland, with a total of 53.6 billion Swiss francs ($58.9 billion) in assets under management at the end of 2022.\n\nSGKB\u2019s partnership with SEBA marks the bank\u2019s first step into the digital asset industry, aiming to allow banking customers to seamlessly access cryptocurrencies within their investment portfolios.\n\nRelated: Standard Chartered-owned crypto platform Zodia launches in Hong Kong\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to offer a select client base access to digital assets and the digital economy,\u201d SGKB head of market services Falk Kohlmann said, adding:\n\n\u201cThanks to our cooperation with SEBA Bank, we\u2019ve implemented a straightforward initial setup, which allows us to learn and grow well aligned to our clients\u2019 needs.

After receiving a banking license from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority in 2019, SEBA has been actively onboarding crypto services to major private and retail banks, including LGT Bank Liechtenstein and Bank Julius Baer.\n\nThe Swiss crypto ecosystem has rapidly evolved, with many local banks introducing cryptocurrency services. In September 2023, a licensed Swiss bank, Dukascopy Bank, officially launched its crypto-enabled services, including marginal trading and online retail banking accounts.\n\n\u201cWe believe that cryptocurrencies continue to play a significant role in today\u2019s world,\u201d Dukascopy Bank\u2019s chief brokerage officer told Cointelegraph. \u201cWe are confident that offering crypto-related services through a regulated bank adds substantial value to the cryptocurrency industry as a whole,\u201d the executive added.\n\nMagazine: How to protect your crypto in a volatile market \u2014 Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in"

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s spectacular rise and fall in the cryptocurrency industry \u2014 a journey that included his testimony before Congress, a Super Bowl advertisement and dreams of a future run for president \u2014 hit a new bottom Thursday when a New York jury convicted him of fraud in a scheme that cheated customers and investors of at least $10 billion.\n\nAfter the monthlong trial, jurors rejected Bankman-Fried\u2019s claim during four days on the witness stand in Manhattan federal court that he never committed fraud or meant to cheat customers before FTX, once the world\u2019s second-largest crypto exchange, collapsed into bankruptcy a year ago.\n\n\u201cHis crimes caught up to him. His crimes have been exposed,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon told the jury of the onetime billionaire just before they were read the law by Judge Lewis A. Kaplan and began deliberations. Sassoon said Bankman-Fried turned his customers\u2019 accounts into his \u201cpersonal piggy bank\u201d as up to $14 billion disappeared.\n\nShe urged jurors to reject Bankman-Fried\u2019s insistence when he testified over three days that he never committed fraud or plotted to steal from customers, investors and lenders and didn\u2019t realize his companies were at least $10 billion in debt until October 2022.\n\nThe trial attracted intense interest with its focus on a fraud on a scale not seen since the 2009 prosecution of Bernard Madoff, whose Ponzi scheme over decades cheated thousands of investors out of about $20 billion. Madoff pleaded guilty, was sentenced to 150 years in prison, where he died in 2021.\n\nREAD MORE: In court, FTX\u2019s Sam Bankman-Fried denies he took customers\u2019 funds but acknowledges that people got hurt\n\nThe prosecution of Bankman-Fried, 31, put a spotlight on the emerging industry of cryptocurrency and a group of young executives in their 20s who lived together in a $30 million luxury apartment in the Bahamas as they dreamed of becoming the most powerful player in a new financial field.\n\nU.S. Attorney Damian Williams said they engaged in one of the biggest frauds in U.S. history.\n\nProsecutors made sure jurors knew that the defendant they saw in court with short hair and a suit was not the man with big messy hair and shorts that became his trademark appearance after he started his cryptocurrency hedge fund, Alameda Research, in 2017 and FTX, his cryptocurrency exchange, two years later.\n\nThey showed the jury pictures of Bankman-Fried sleeping on a private jet, sitting with a deck of cards and mingling at the Super Bowl with celebrities including the singer Katy Perry. Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicolas Roos called Bankman-Fried someone who liked \u201ccelebrity chasing.\u201d\n\nIn a closing argument, defense lawyer Mark Cohen said prosecutors were trying to turn \u201cSam into some sort of villain, some sort of monster.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s both wrong and unfair, and I hope and believe that you have seen that it\u2019s simply not true,\u201d he said. \u201cAccording to the government, everything Sam ever touched and said was fraudulent.\u201d\n\nThe government relied heavily on the testimony of three former members of Bankman-Fried\u2019s inner circle, his top executives including his former girlfriend, Caroline Ellison, to explain how Bankman-Fried used Alameda Research to siphon billions of dollars from customer accounts at FTX.\n\nWith that money, prosecutors said, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate gained influence and power through investments, contributions, tens of millions of dollars in political contributions, Congressional testimony and a publicity campaign that enlisted celebrities like comedian Larry David and football quarterback Tom Brady.\n\nEllison, 28, testified that Bankman-Fried directed her while she was chief executive of Alameda Research to commit fraud as he pursued ambitions to lead huge companies, spend money influentially and run for U.S. president someday. She said he thought he had a 5 percent chance to be U.S. president someday.\n\nBecoming tearful as she described the collapse of the cryptocurrency empire last November, Ellison said the revelations that caused customers collectively to demand their money back, exposing the fraud, brought a \u201crelief that I didn\u2019t have to lie anymore.\u201d\n\nFTX cofounder Gary Wang, who was FTX\u2019s chief technology officer, revealed in his testimony that Bankman-Fried directed him to insert code into FTX\u2019s operations so that Alameda Research could make unlimited withdrawals from FTX and have a credit line up to $65 billion. Wang said the money came from customers.\n\nNishad Singh, the former head of engineering at FTX, testified that he felt \u201cblindsided and horrified\u201d at the result of the actions of a man he once admired when he saw the extent of the fraud as the collapse last November left him suicidal.\n\nREAD MORE: Amid value drops and increased regulation, what\u2019s the future of cryptocurrency?\n\nEllison, Wang and Singh all pleaded guilty to fraud charges and testified against Bankman-Fried in the hopes of leniency at sentencing.\n\nBankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas last December and extradited to the United States, where he was freed on a $250 million personal recognizance bond with electronic monitoring and a requirement that he remain at the home of his parents in Palo Alto, California.\n\nHis communications, including hundreds of phone calls with journalists and internet influencers, along with emails and texts, eventually got him in trouble when the judge concluded he was trying to influence prospective trial witnesses and ordered him jailed in August.\n\nDuring the trial, prosecutors used Bankman-Fried\u2019s public statements, online announcements and his Congressional testimony against him, showing how the entrepreneur repeatedly promised customers that their deposits were safe and secure as late as last Nov. 7 when he tweeted \u201cFTX is fine. Assets are fine\u201d as customers furiously tried to withdraw their money. He deleted the tweet the next day. FTX filed for bankruptcy four days later.\n\nIn his closing, Roos mocked Bankman-Fried\u2019s testimony, saying that under questioning from his lawyer, the defendant\u2019s words were \u201csmooth, like it had been rehearsed a bunch of times?\u201d\n\nBut under cross examination, \u201che was a different person,\u201d the prosecutor said. \u201cSuddenly on cross-examination he couldn\u2019t remember a single detail about his company or what he said publicly. It was uncomfortable to hear. He never said he couldn\u2019t recall during his direct examination, but it happened over 140 times during his cross-examination.\u201d\n\nAssociated Press reporter Ken Sweet contributed from Palm Springs, California."

With the Bitcoin halving fast approaching (April 2024) and investors\u2019 belief that a spot BTC ETF is imminent, the drop in Ether\u2019s value in its BTC pair suggests that investors feel more bullish about BTC and possibly allocating less money to Ether investments.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin dominance hits 54% \u2014 Highest in 2.5 years as BTC halving approaches\n\nEthereum price breaks below critical support vs. Bitcoin\n\nThe ETH/BTC pair dropped to 0.050 BTC on Oct. 23 and has remained in a downtrend since then. A notable occurrence was the pair\u2019s fall below its 200-week exponential moving average near 0.058 BTC,which raises the possibility for further downside in the short-term.\n\nAccording to Cointegraph contributor Yashu Gola,\n\n\u201cThe 200-week EMA has historically served as a reliable support level for ETH/BTC bulls. For instance, the pair rebounded 75% three months after testing the wave support in July 2022. Conversely, it dropped over 25% after losing the same support in October 2020.\u201d\n\nThese factors are likely to continue impacting Ethereum's price relative to Bitcoin. The multifaceted market dynamics, investor sentiment and staunch regulatory environment could remain the dominant headwinds against the ETH/BTC pair for the foreseeable future.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Photo: Getty (Westend61 via Getty Images)\n\nBitcoin broke through the $35,000 (\u00a328,700) level after the US Federal Reserve opted to hold rates steady.\n\nAt Wednesday's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting the US central bank did what many analysts expected and announced another rate pause. The benchmark federal funds rate is now unchanged at 5.25%-5.50%.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) rose by almost 3% in the past 24 hours, now changing hands at $35,300 (\u00a329,020), according to CoinGecko data.\n\nRead more: Crypto live prices\n\nAt one point over the past day, the world's largest digital asset by market capitalisation eyed the $36,000 (\u00a329,600) mark, reaching a height of $35,875 (\u00a329,492), according to CoinGecko data.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Today we decided to leave our interest policy unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. We will make decisions about the extent of additional policy firming and how long policy will remain restrictive, based on the totality of the incoming data, and the evolving outlook at the balance of risks,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference after the meeting.\n\nStocks associated with digital assets also pushed higher. Coinbase (COIN), the largest US crypto exchange, rose 0.89% on Wednesday, while MicroStrategy (MSTR) rose 0.77%. Bitcoin mining firms Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Marathon Digital (MARA) increased 4.4% and 1.25%, respectively.\n\nRead more: Institutional investment brings new momentum to crypto\n\nBitcoin has been on a sustained rally since around October 15. This rising price trajectory appears to be partly driven by speculation that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is close to granting approval for a spot bitcoin ETF, which would allow investors to get exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to own it.\n\nBlackRock (BLK) is among the money managers that have applied to launch such a product. Shortly after the commencement of bitcoin's recent rally in the middle of October, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink spoke in favourable terms about digital assets in an interview with Fox Business. He indicated that the market's recent response to the digital asset is \"pent-up interest in crypto.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I think there are more people running into a flight to quality, whether that is in Treasuries, gold or crypto, depending on how you think of it.

We\u2019ve also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia, a cryptocurrency is \u201ca digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.\u201d Cryptocurrency is a young asset class that has developed a reputation for price volatility; however, there are ETFs that could help mitigate risk for those investors seeking crypto exposure.\n\nBitcoin was the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Ether is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three with its launch in July 2015. XRP, which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We\u2019ve included it here for reference.\n\nThe third-largest market share of cryptocurrency, tether, is a token \u201cbacked by actual assets.\u201d It includes one U.S. dollar, one euro, or loans to affiliate companies and is controlled by the owners of Bitfinex. It\u2019s a controversial cryptocurrency due to its alleged manipulation of crypto pricing. It is called a \u201cstable coin\u201d because it was designed to always be worth $1.00. We do not chart it because its price rarely changes.\n\nFor a better understanding of crypto market cycles, read more here.\n\nThe Latest Crypto Data (through October 31, 2023)\n\nBitcoin finished October up ~29% from September and is now up ~107% year to date.\n\nXRP finished October up ~16% from September and is now up over 70% year to date.\n\nEther finished October up ~9% from September and is now up ~50% year to date.\n\nAn index has been created to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. Ether tops the chart, i.e., the price of an ether has changed the most out of all three cryptocurrencies.\n\nETFs associated with cryptocurrencies include: ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITI), VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), and Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH).\n\nOriginally published on Advisor Perspectives.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel."

The mystery inventor's worth has reached as high as $70 billion, but not a single one of those bitcoins has ever traded hands or moved from Nakamoto's online wallet.\n\nAfter sending a few cryptic emails stating he \"may not be around,\" Nakamoto went silent and has not been heard from since early 2011.\n\nWhy did Nakamoto disappear? Some have speculated that he may have taken his own life. Or maybe he wanted to wash his hands of his bitcoin project, walking away from it all and maintaining his anonymity.\n\nIn this film, director and producer Paul Kemp goes on a worldwide journey to piece together the most compelling case yet for who Satoshi Nakamoto was and why he disappeared."

        "title": "BTC price cools off, but 'You can never have too much Bitcoin,' says Saylor - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "This week Bitcoin (BTC) price came within a hair of the $36,000 mark, before abruptly reversing course and correcting to $34,250. After a near 30% run over the past month, it is natural for the price to cool off as some traders take profit and market participants evaluate whether or not the catalysts for the rally remain valid.\n\nDespite the intraday price action, which saw a 4.67% drawdown, a number of analysts remain bullish on Bitcoin, and some expect another \u201cgamma squeeze\u201d if BTC price manages to push through the $36,300 level.\n\nPermabulls like MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor appear unbothered by the whipsaw price action, and on Nov.1, MicroStrategy announced the October purchase of 155 BTC for $5.3 million.\n\nIn October, @MicroStrategy acquired an additional 155 BTC for $5.3 million and now holds 158,400 BTC. Please join us at 5pm ET as we discuss our Q3 2023 financial results and answer questions about the outlook for #BusinessIntelligence and #Bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/w7eRUcGobi \u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) November 1, 2023\n\nWhen asked about the upcoming Bitcoin halving during an interview with CNBC Squawk on the Street host Sara Eisen, Saylor said:\n\n\u201cMost of the natural sellers of Bitcoin in the market right now are Bitcoin miners, and they have to sell to cover their electricity bills and capital costs and retire their debt. That\u2019s about a billion dollars per month worth of selling into the market. The protocol forces that to be cut in half as of next April, or late April.\u201d\n\nConsidering the impact of the halving on selling and demand, Saylor said:\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re going to see $12 billion of natural selling per year converted to $6 billion of natural selling a year. At the same time as things like spot Bitcoin ETFs increase the demand for Bitcoin. So that\u2019s why all of us are fairly bullish over the next 12 months. Demand is going to increase, and supply is going to contract and this is fairly unprecedented in the history of Wall Street.\u201d\n\nNow is a \u201cpretty ideal entry point\u201d for Bitcoin\n\nTo date, Bitcoin price has gained 114%, 30% of which was added in the last month. Despite these gains, the price remains nearly 50% down from its all-time high, and the average person is likely to have memories of the FTX implosion and other crypto scandals in their mind before considering BTC\u2019s performance in 2023.\n\nWhen asked whether he believed the well of institutional investor interest had been poisoned by \u201cbad and dark applications of this cryptocurrency and people like Sam Bankman-Fried, Saylor said,\n\n\u201cI think that the liabilities or the early crypto cowboys, the crypto tokens which are unregistered securities, the unreliable crypto custodians, for the industry to move to the next level, we\u2019re going to need to migrate to adult supervision.\u201d\n\nRelated: BTC price dips 3.5% as 'overheated' Bitcoin derivatives spark angst\n\nRegarding the current investing climate, Saylor suggested that \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a 12-month to 48-month time horizon, this is a pretty ideal entry point into the asset.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen banks on Wall Street and responsible custodians are managing Bitcoin and the industry takes its eyes away from all the shiny little tokens that have distracted and demolished shareholder value, I think the industry moves to the next level and we 10x from here.\u201d\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Blockchain stocks are a great way for investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrency. During the 2020 crypto bull market, bitcoin mining and blockchain stocks soared and outperformed the underlying asset. The prospect of cryptocurrency becoming a primary asset class is becoming more of a reality, rather than just a dream.\n\nThe latest cryptocurrency bull market in 2020/21 proved that widespread adoption was inevitable. Interest was largely fueled by fiscal stimulus, institutional adoption and central bank digital currencies. Now, investors are betting that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will approve of a Bitcoin (BTC-USD) ETF in the coming months. This will be a major milestone for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. With the next Bitcoin halving approaching in 2024, these 3 blockchain stocks could soar in the next bull market.\n\nBelow are my top 3 blockchain stocks to buy right now!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings (MARA)\n\nMacro view of miner working for bitcoins mine pool. Devices and technology for mining cryptocurrency. Mining cryptocurrency concept. MARA stock. Crypto mining.\n\nSource: Yev_1234 / Shutterstock\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) is a vertically integrated Bitcoin mining company. They are one of the largest miners in the world, with fleet operations covering nearly 5% of the Bitcoin network. The stock is currently up 190% year-to-date, as Bitcoin recovered from its slump at the end of 2022.\n\nMarathon Digital is continuing to garner momentum in November, as the cryptocurrency sector sees large inflows in Q4 2023. During the 2020 cryptocurrency bull run, Marathon Digital skyrocketed more than 4000%. As Bitcoin hit all time highs of nearly $69,000 in 2021, Bitcoin miners were making record profits. But the good times can come to an end as record inflation and higher interest rates hit the U.S. in 2022.\n\nIn 2022, rising energy prices, high debt levels and falling Bitcoin prices heavily affected the mining industry. Bitcoin bulls were not anticipating the price to fall more than 60% going into the new year. However, the future does look bright for Marathon Digital. In September 2023, Marathon produced 1,242 Bitcoin and increased their monthly hash rate by 20%. They have installed mining capacity of approximately 23 EH/s with 13,726 Bitcoin\u2019s in their treasury.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor Q2 2023, Marathon Digital\u2019s total revenue grew 228% to $81.76 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $25.6 million, compared to a loss of $167.1 million in the year prior. Totalled Bitcoin mined for the quarter was 2,926, up 314% YOY. This was driven by a rapid increase in operational hashrate growing from 0.7 EH/s in Q2 2022 to 17.7 EH/s in Q2 2023. If you\u2019re bullish on cryptocurrency going into 2024, Marathon Digital is one of the best blockchain stocks to buy.\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT)\n\nIn this photo illustration, the Riot Platforms (RIOT) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nRiot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) is on the rise this week as Bitcoin crossed the $35,000 mark. They are one of the largest Bitcoin mining companies in the United States. The company is currently ramping up their mining capacity at their new facility in Navarro County, Texas.\n\nRiot also benefited tremendously from the cryptocurrency bull market and the higher prices in 2020/21. The stock rose more than 60X from its low in February 2020 to the peak in February 2021. Riot\u2019s share price crashed back down to reality as the crypto winter began in the back half of 2021. However, operational improvements and expansions continue at both its Rockdale and Corsicana facilities.\n\n\n\nBy the end of November 2023, Riot expects its mining capacity to reach 12.5 EH/s. Their recent purchase of next generation MicroBT miners is expected to increase their hash rate by 7.6 EH/s. When fully operational, their mining capacity will exceed 20 EH/s by mid 2024. Currently, Riot holds approximately 7,327 Bitcoin\u2019s in its treasuries producing an average of 12.1 per day. With Bitcoin and cryptocurrency on the rise, RIOT is a top blockchain stock to buy in 2023.\n\nMicroStrategy (MSTR)\n\nMICROSTRATEGY - sign at headquarters building. MSTR stock.\n\nSource: DCStockPhotography / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) is an American software company which primarily provides business intelligence and cloud-based solutions services. However, in recent years they have emerged as one of the largest supporters of Bitcoin and blockchain technology.\n\nIts founder Michael Saylor is a well known Bitcoin maximalist, and is largely against traditional fiat currencies. He believes Bitcoin is the best asymmetric bet of the century, and that Bitcoin will become a larger asset class than Gold. MicroStrategy has faced a lot of criticism in recent years, as their Bitcoin bet is extremely risky and could destroy shareholder value. However, if MicroStrategy is right on Bitcoin their shareholders will be rewarded handsomely. As of October 2023, MicroStrategy remains the world\u2019s largest institutional holder of Bitcoin. They currently hold 158,400 Bitcoin in their Bitcoin treasuries, valued at approximately $5.62 billion USD.\n\nBesides their exposure to Bitcoin, MicroStrategy is capitalizing on the market opportunities in artificial intelligence. Their Microstrategy One platform includes a large partnership network and integrated data, AI, and advanced cloud capabilities. As the Bitcoin halving approaches in 2024, MicroStrategy should certainly be kept on your radar.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "While the approval of a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) will likely spike the price of Bitcoin, some analysts are concerned it won\u2019t be enough to fully thaw the markets from their winter chill.\n\nOn Oct. 24, Bitcoin staged its largest single-day rally in over a year, surging more than 14% on the news that the ticker of BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF \u2014 IBTC \u2014 had been listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) website, something markets understood as a positive step forward for the funds\u2019 application.\n\nThe surge turned out to be even stronger than that of Oct. 16, when Cointelegraph\u2019s incorrect X post that suggested a spot Bitcoin ETF had been approved.\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, pseudonymous trader TheFlowHorse, who boasts 184,000 followers on X, said that the two market blips can be seen as a hint of Bitcoin\u2019s price action should a spot Bitcoin ETF be approved.\n\nAddressing the two developments and their impact on Bitcoin, TheFlowHorse added that investors could expect to see a move of \u201cthe same, if not greater magnitude\u201d if the ETF is approved.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin surged to north of $35,000 on Oct. 24. Source: TradingView\n\nHowever, TheFlowHorse noted that, while approval will likely drive prices significantly upward, it\u2019s also likely it will be followed by an eventual retrace in the mid-term.\n\nThis is because, in TheFlowHorse\u2019s view, the trade will be crowded heavily by eager investors looking to chase the news.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a ton of crowding\u2026 and that\u2019s ultimately an inefficient move. The inefficient moves get refilled and retrace to some degree,\u201d he added.\n\nTony Sycamore, an analyst at IG International, told Cointelegraph that he expects to see Bitcoin continue to surge through new yearly highs on the day of the announcement, while Rachael Lucas, a technical analyst at Australian crypto exchange BTC Markets, said the approval of BlackRock\u2019s ETF will act as a catalyst for the rest of the traditional finance sector.\n\n\u201cThis participation not only amplifies institutional capital inflows but also heightens retail curiosity, contributes to supply limitations, and underscores the deflationary aspect of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHere's a short clip of @kaileyleinz asking Gensler about $GBTC and other spot #Bitcoin ETFs. Mostly non-answers in my opinion but does talk about the disclosure review team. We've had some insight into their process via the amendments from some of these filers in recent days pic.twitter.com/lIWZc74OAi \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) October 18, 2023\n\nHowever, while Sycamore said there\u2019s a chance the \u201crally could stick,\u201d a full-scale trend reversal for Bitcoin seems unlikely, given that interest rates remain considerably higher than they were when Bitcoin notched its previous all-time high.\n\nTina Teng, an analyst at CMC Markets, also believes it would be worthwhile to adopt a more cautious stance, as there\u2019s no guarantee of an all-out trend reversal.\n\n\u201cBitcoin still lacks the fundamentals to support a quantitative valuation like shares and does not have the scope of utilization like commodities. An approval by the SEC cannot change the nature of it being a speculative asset.\u201d\n\n\u201cMacro changes will have a major impact on the crypto markets, which usually start building an upside trend during a Fed rate cut cycle,\u201d Teng concluded.\n\nRelated: Grayscale files for new spot Bitcoin ETF on NYSE Arca\n\nThe certainty and timing of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval are still up for debate. While unlikely, ETF analysts said that United States Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler could be waiting until the very last minute to pull off an \u201camazingly sadistic\u201d denial of the impending applications.\n\nWhile analysts from JPMorgan claimed in an Oct. 17 investment note that an approval could arrive within the next few months, the general consensus \u2014 held by Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas \u2014 peg the chances of an approval by Jan. 10 next year at 90%.\n\nI've gotten a lot of questions regarding my current view on Spot #Bitcoin ETFs over the last couple weeks.

The whitepaper provides a detailed description of key concepts such as Bitcoin transactions, proof-of-work, network structure, privacy protection, and incentive mechanisms. It serves to emphasize the characteristics of decentralization and openness by providing guidance for the development of subsequent cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe main idea was to create a digital currency system that does not rely on central authorities, ensuring transaction security through a decentralized proof-of-work mechanism. It also offers pseudonymity and encourages miners to participate in the network to ensure long-term reliability.\n\nThe Bitcoin Rainbow Chart\n\nClick to expand.

Meaning of colors: Typically, red and orange areas indicate an overheated market, possibly in a price bubble, while blue and purple areas indicate a potentially undervalued market with buying opportunities.\n\n2. Not an absolute buying and selling indicator: Although the Rainbow Chart can provide an intuitive impression of market sentiment, it should not be used as the sole basis for making buying and selling decisions.

Source: Bitget\n\n2013: On March 25, 2013, the Cyprus government, European Central Bank, and International Monetary Fund announced a bailout of 10 billion euros for Cyprus, and imposed a tax on all accounts in Cyprus with deposits exceeding 100,000 euros. As a well-known tax haven, Cyprus banks held a significant amount of offshore accounts for wealthy individuals worldwide. To avoid taxation, account holders in Cyprus bought a large amount of Bitcoin, driving the price from $80 to $260.\n\nOn April 10, 2013, following the news of the Cyprus bailout, the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin exchange, Mt.Gox, experienced a sharp decline in price due to the Chinese government declaring Bitcoin as non-currency and banning all financial institutions from participating in Bitcoin-related activities.\n\n2014: On February 24, 2014, amidst accusations within the Bitcoin community, the Bitcoin exchange Mt.Gox announced its closure. Mt.Gox revealed that over 850,000 user and company-owned Bitcoins had been stolen over the past few years, resulting in a loss of $450 million.\n\nOn October 6, 2014, the Bitstamp exchange experienced the largest sell order in history, with a trader selling 3,000 Bitcoins at a price of $300 per coin. On the same day, Bitstamp was hacked, resulting in the theft of 18,866 Bitcoins worth $5.2 million. The hacker gained access to the hot wallet\u2019s private keys by compromising an administrator\u2019s account. Bitstamp suspended operations for 8 days to fix the system vulnerability. Although no users suffered financial losses in this hack, market confidence plummeted, causing a sharp decline in Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\n2016: On August 2, 2016, Bitfinex, the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin exchange, was hacked, resulting in the theft of 119,756 Bitcoins worth over $72 million. On the same day, Bitcoin\u2019s price plummeted by 20%.\n\n2017: On March 3, 2017, Bitcoin\u2019s price surpassed $1,000 for the first time in 3 years, mainly due to extensive media coverage attracting new investors.\n\nOn June 15, 2017, Bitcoin experienced a 15% drop in a single day and a 30% drop within 3 days due to rumors of a comprehensive ban on cryptocurrency trading by the People\u2019s Bank of China.\n\nOn September 4, 2017, after the release of the \"Announcement on Preventing the Risks of Token Issuance Financing\" by the People\u2019s Bank of China and six other ministries, Bitcoin experienced a cliff-like decline.\n\nOn October 20, 2017, Bitcoin\u2019s price hovered around $6,000, reaching a new all-time high. Within 1 hour and 35 minutes, from 13:39 to 15:14, the price rapidly rose from $5,640 to $5,975.\n\nOn December 7, 2017, Bitcoin\u2019s trading price surpassed $15,000 and 100,000 Chinese yuan for the first time.\n\n2018: On December 16, 2018, Bitcoin\u2019s price hit a bottom at $3,200, declining over 80% from its all-time high.\n\n2019: On the evening of October 26, 2019, Bitcoin\u2019s price surged from $7,600 to $10,800, a 40% increase in a single day, marking the third-largest price swing in Bitcoin\u2019s history.\n\n2020: On the evening of March 12, 2020, the cryptocurrency market experienced a $2 billion liquidation, with the largest liquidation amount reaching $10 million and an average of $51,000 per liquidation.\n\n2021: On March 13, 2021, Bitcoin surpassed the $60,000 mark.\n\nOn April 10, 2021, Bitcoin reached its all-time high of $64,800.\n\nOn June 9, 2021, the President of El Salvador proposed making Bitcoin the country\u2019s legal tender, and on June 9, the proposal was passed by a majority vote in Congress. El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt a virtual currency as legal tender.\n\nOn November 9, 2021, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $68,300.\n\n2022: On March 1, 2022, the U.S. Treasury Department issued new regulations prohibiting Americans from providing any support to Russian oligarchs and entities, including through the use of digital currencies or crypto assets. On the same day, Bitcoin\u2019s price experienced a short-term surge from around $41,800 to nearly $44,000, with a 24-hour increase of over 14%.\n\nOn June 14, 2022, influenced by the LUNA collapse event, Bitcoin\u2019s price briefly dropped below $21,000, reaching a low of $20,846, the lowest point since December 16, 2020.\n\nOn October 4, 2022, Bitcoin fell below the $19,800 mark.\n\n2023: On August 17, 2023, Bitcoin\u2019s price fell below $29,000 per coin for the first time since August 7, with a 0.58% decrease within 24 hours.\n\nIn September 2023, Bitcoin dropped below $25,000 per coin, experiencing a decline of over 3% in a single day.\n\n2023 Q4\n\n1. The cryptocurrency market has experienced a widespread surge\n\nIn recent days, the cryptocurrency market has witnessed a significant surge across the board. Market confidence has been bolstered by the listing of BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust on DTCC (US Securities Centralized Depository and Clearing Corporation). This development is widely interpreted as a precursor to the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the market. Bloomberg ETF analysts have also indicated that BlackRock plans to inject seed ETF into their ETF in October, further signaling the imminent arrival of spot Bitcoin ETFs for investors.\n\n2. The ETF market holds immense potential\n\nThe participation of major institutions such as BlackRock, Invesco, and Fidelity in the cryptocurrency space has prompted investors to reevaluate their perceptions of cryptoassets, dispelling doubts and fears surrounding the industry. According to ETFGI statistics, as of June 2023, the global ETF market\u2019s total assets under management are nearing $10 trillion. With the successful approval of cryptocurrency ETFs, cryptoassets will seamlessly enter this $10 trillion market, injecting a significant boost to their value. Increased liquidity and the influx of professional traders will follow, driving the price of Bitcoin higher.\n\n3. Future market trends to watch\n\nWhat can we expect for the future of cryptoassets in the market? Externally, the prevailing view is that Bitcoin and Ethereum are primarily seen as technological assets, and their value tends to fluctuate in response to macroeconomic monetary policies. Internally, Bitcoin is set to undergo a halving event in May 2024, reducing its production from 6.25 to 3.125. The scarcity of Bitcoin is a key reason why mainstream investors currently favor Bitcoin over Ethereum. In terms of market rotation cycles, it is common for Bitcoin to lead the upward trend, followed by Ethereum, and then a rotation towards Altcoins.\n\n4. Other cryptoassets worth considering\n\nApart from Bitcoin and Ethereum, there are other cryptoassets that deserve attention. Firstly, within the Bitcoin ecosystem, there is immense potential for continuous exploration, whether it\u2019s related to Bitcoin network payments, Layer2 solutions, privacy-focused projects, or upcoming innovative ideas. Secondly, there are DeFi-related currencies within the Ethereum ecosystem. Decentralized finance has always been a central narrative of the Ethereum network, enabling users worldwide to establish trustless decentralized networks and enhance financial efficiency across various domains.\n\nAbout Bitget\n\nEstablished in 2018,Bitget is the world\u2019s leadingcryptocurrency exchange and web3 company.

        "content": "MicroStrategy, the software firm led by prominent Bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor, is once again demonstrating the potential of Bitcoin as a store of value.\n\nWith a strategic approach to accumulating the Bitcoin through the entirety of the most recent bear market, the company is now sitting on a nearly $1 billion gain.\n\nMicroStrategy's journey into Bitcoin began in August 2020 when it first announced its entry into the world of digital assets. The company's initial investment, at a cost basis of $4.68 billion, has now soared in value to $5.62 billion, representing a $932 million profit, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.\n\nThis increase in MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings has only reinforced Saylor's unwavering confidence in the digital currency.\n\nSaylor, a fervent advocate for Bitcoin, has been vocal about his belief that the cryptocurrency is not just an asset but a revolutionary monetary network. He asserts that Bitcoin's inherent qualities, including scarcity and decentralization, make it a superior long-term investment and a hedge against inflation.\n\nSaylor's conviction extends beyond his role at MicroStrategy, as he has been a prominent figure in the broader financial landscape, advocating for the adoption of Bitcoin by other institutional investors. He has encouraged companies to allocate a portion of their treasuries to Bitcoin, as a safeguard against the devaluation of fiat currencies and the erosion of purchasing power.\n\nThe rise in MicroStrategy's Bitcoin investment serves as a testament to Saylor's vision and persistence. Despite fluctuations in Bitcoin's price, Saylor remains steadfast in his belief that it represents a paradigm shift in the world of finance.\n\nHe often characterizes Bitcoin as \"digital gold\" and sees it as an essential component of any forward-thinking investment strategy.\n\nStill, looking ahead questions remain for the MicroStrategy empire. With a Bitcoin Spot ETF on the horizon, institutional investors may have new options for acquiring Bitcoin, dampering what has long been a driver in the company's stock price.\n\nRegardless, his firm will likely be well positioned for the return of a sound money era with a Bitcoin stash that will be unrivaled among public companies.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

Seasonal conditions triggered the slump of 35% month over month (MoM): the miner halted its operations at the Helios facility in Dickens County, Texas, due to the severe winter that hit the United States and caused additional load on the electric network.\n\n\"During the winter storm, Argo joined other Texas Bitcoin miners in reducing power usage by an estimated 1,500 MW, according to the Texas Blockchain Council. Argo has always committed to being a good community partner, and the company is proud to have contributed to the stability of the Texas power grid during the winter storm,\" the company commented in the press release.\n\nArgo's Bitcoin digging revenue in December came in at $2.49 million, slipping 39% MoM from the $3.456 million reported in November. At year-end, the publicly listed miner held 141 Bitcoins in its vault, most of which (116) were \"Bitcoin Equivalents.\" The company's total hash rate remained at 2.5 EH/s.\n\nKeep Reading TradingView Enhances DeFi Tools on Polygon via QuickSwap Partnership\n\nAhead of the US cash market opening on Wednesday, Argo shares reacted to the trading update rising 1.04% to $27.09.

However, the company dismissed the Chapter 11 bankruptcy grim vision due to a strategic deal with Galaxy Digital Holdings, Ltd, a financial firm focused on digital assets, owned by Mike Novogratz.\n\nArgo decided to sell its Texas-based crypto mine Helios for $65 million and use a new loan from Galaxy to refinance its current debt obligations take out to finance the development of its ongoing business.\n\n\"This transaction with Galaxy is a transformational one for Argo and benefits the company in several ways. It reduces our debt by $41 million (\u00a334 million) and provides us with a stronger balance sheet and enhanced liquidity to help ensure continued operations through the ongoing bear market,\" Peter Wall, the Chief Executive of Argo Blockchain, said.\n\nNot Everyone Was So Lucky\n\nAlthough Argo Blockchain was able to save itself from bankruptcy, not every company in the crypto space was as fortunate. The prolonged crypto winter fueled by the collapse of FTX cryptocurrency exchange led to the collapse of BlockFi, a popular cryptocurrency lender and caused Midas Investment, a digital assets company from the DeFi space, to declare bankruptcy in late December.\n\nMeanwhile, the insolvency of the Terra ecosystem in May caused the bankruptcy of Three Arrows Capital, a crypto hedge fund, and two lenders, Celsius Network and Voyager Capital."

The gains have been buoyed by renewed institutional interest, as well as hopes that an upcoming \u201chalving\u201d event will spark another record-breaking bull run.\n\nScheduled to take place in April 2024, the event will see the production of bitcoin cut in half as part of an anti-inflationary measure that was hard-coded into its underlying blockchain by its pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is beyond the point of no return, a bull market is inevitable,\u201d said popular Dutch analyst PlanB, whose price prediction models have previously forecasted patterns related to halving cycles of the cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cThe only questions are: when does FOMO [fear of missing out] start, how high will this bull go, and how long will it last?\u201d\n\nView more\n\nAmong those betting on a bull run is MicroStrategy, a software firm that has made bitcoin investment one of its core strategies in recent years.\n\nThe US company bought another 155 bitcoins at an average price of $29,586 per BTC in October, taking its total holdings to 158,400 BTC.\n\nMicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor said during an earnings call on Wednesday that \u201cpositive regulatory initiative\u201d and increasing clarity would create \u201cmore comfort for institutional investors\u201d to buy bitcoin.\n\nAndrew Kang, MicroStrategy\u2019s chief financial officer, added: \u201cOur commitment to acquire and hold bitcoin remains strong, especially with the promising backdrop of increased institutional adoption.\u201d\n\nRecent data has also led to speculation that a new cycle for the crypto market is emerging, driven by a new wave of investors.\n\n\u201cThe cumulative daily volume for 22 October to 28 October reached $2412 billion, the highest level recorded since the end of March,\u201d noted Matteo Greco, a research analyst at crypto investment firm Fineqia International.\n\n\u201cThis increase in volume is mainly due to heightened bitcoin trading activity. Specifically, BTC\u2019s total trading volume in the past seven days hit $9.1 billion, a 42 per cent rise from the previous week and a substantial 139 per cent surge from two weeks ago. These trends suggest a gradual influx of new investors into the market.\u201d"

        "content": "Quick Take\n\nBitcoin has achieved a new milestone, fortifying a support level at $35,000 and hitting fresh year-to-date highs last night on Nov. 1. In the past 24 hours, per data from Coinglass, a staggering 60,851 traders have faced liquidations, leading to a cumulative loss of approximately $160 million.\n\nA deeper dive into the data reveals an interesting trend. Over $100 million of the liquidated amount was due to short liquidations, making up nearly 62% of the total liquidations. This indicates an overwhelming majority of traders betting against digital assets performance were caught off guard by this sudden uptick, resulting in considerable losses.\n\nFurthermore, Binance, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, contributed a majority share to this phenomenon with $76 million worth of liquidations.\n\nUpon examining the liquidation heatmap on Binance for the BTC/USDT pair, it becomes evident that there\u2019s a significant liquidation threshold at $35,000. Should this support level be violated, it could potentially trigger a downward trend for Bitcoin. Notably, there are two substantial liquidation levels at around $34,000, each estimated to be approximately $140 million, further reinforcing the critical significance of these price points in the market dynamics."

        "content": "While publicly mocking nonfungible tokens (NFTs) during a podcast, Tesla CEO and billionaire Elon Musk appears to have inadvertently highlighted the case for Bitcoin Ordinals, also known as Bitcoin NFTs.\n\n\u201cThe funny thing is the NFT is not even on the blockchain \u2014 it\u2019s just a URL to the JPEG,\u201d said Musk in an Oct. 31 released interview on The Joe Rogan Experience.\n\nMusk said NFT projects should at least encode the JPEG on-chain:\n\n\u201cYou should at least encode the JPEG in the blockchain. If the company housing the image goes out of business, you don\u2019t have the image anymore.\u201d\n\nOn social media, Bitcoiners argued Musk\u2019s comments actually summed up the use case for Bitcoin Ordinals. Bitcoin\u2019s version of NFTs was launched in January by developer Casey Rodarmor, which was made possible by the Taproot soft fork in November 2021.\n\nCryptocurrency analyst Will Clemente was among those who praised Musk\u2019s comments, noting there are 38 million and counting Ordinals inscriptions that will forever exist on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.\n\n.@elonmusk you just laid out the case for Bitcoin ordinals - image/text inscriptions directly on the most secure open source monetary network on the planet. There are currently 38 million of these inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain. pic.twitter.com/WASj1qpkz8 \u2014 Will Clemente (@WClementeIII) November 1, 2023\n\n\u201cThis is why Ordinals will continue to grow,\u201d said Rohun \u201cFrank\u201d Vora, the creator of NFT projects DeGods and y00ts. \u201cIt\u2019s the most elegant solution to one of the most universal criticisms of NFTs.\u201d\n\nOrdinals developer known as \u201cLeonidas\u201d liked Musk\u2019s comments so much that they inscribed the 19-second video into Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain at block 814,773:\n\nVideo of Elon Musk inscribed on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain via the Ordinals protocol. Source: Ord.io\n\nThe criticisms from Musk toward NFTs aren\u2019t new. In December 2021, he mocked NFTs as a sign of mental illness in a meme showing a patient lying on a therapist\u2019s couch.\n\nMusk\u2019s comments, however, don\u2019t stand true for all NFT projects on Ethereum.\n\nFor example, Larva Labs moved its CryptoPunks NFTs on-chain in August 2021 after they lived off-chain for the first four years.\n\n\u201cStoring them on-chain in this way would further cement the long-term survival of the Cryptopunks images and attributes, and ensure that they can be fully accessed by anyone with only an Ethereum client,\u201d Larva Labs said in the statement.\n\n.@elonmusk is correct that having NFT merely provide an http link to someone's domain is silly.\n\n\n\nHowever, with rare exceptions, it's also silly to insist NFT content be on chain,\n\n\n\nIPFS links, with the content backed by whoever owns the NFT is the natural solution. \u2014 Arthur B. (@ArthurB) November 1, 2023\n\nRelated: Are NFT markets in a death spiral or ready for a resurgence?\n\nMetagood, the team behind the Ethereum-native OnChainMonkeys, announced in September that it would migrate its NFTs to Bitcoin.\n\nWhile the firm\u2019s CEO, Danny Yang, didn\u2019t directly address the JPEG dilemma, he explained that NFTs \u201cwill win on Bitcoin\u201d because it is a securer network to work from:\n\n\u201cThe Bitcoin Ordinal protocol is better designed for decentralization and security than the Ethereum NFT protocol. High-value NFTs will win on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHowever, Ethereum still remains home to 84% of all NFT trading volumes, according to CoinGecko, sourcing data from June. Bitcoin and ImmutableX came in second and third with market shares of 11% and 2.5%, respectively.\n\nMagazine: NFT Collector: William Mapan\u2019s Distance sells out, NFT float in Macy\u2019s Parade, Nouns DAO forks"

For one, Bitcoin is set for a \u201chalving\u201d event next April that will reduce Bitcoin mining rewards by 50%\u2014substantially reducing the amount of Bitcoin likely to be flooded by miners into the market.\n\nRumors are also flying on Wall Street that the first spot Bitcoin ETF\u2014long desired but never yet greenlit by U.S. regulators\u2014could finally gain approval as soon as Christmas, opening the cryptocurrency to even more mainstream investment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see $12 billion of natural selling per year converted into $6 billion of natural selling a year\u2014at the same time as things like spot Bitcoin ETFs increase the demand for Bitcoin,\u201d Saylor said of the near-term Bitcoin climate. \u201cSo that\u2019s why all of us are fairly bullish over the next 12 months: demand\u2019s going to increase, supply\u2019s going to contract, and this is fairly unprecedented in the history of Wall Street.\u201d\n\nSaylor went on to further elaborate on his belief that as major financial institutions expand their investment in Bitcoin, centralized institutions will stabilize not only Bitcoin itself, but the crypto industry as a whole\u2014further boosting Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\n\u201cWhen banks on Wall Street and responsible custodians are managing Bitcoin, and the industry takes its eyes away from all the shiny little tokens that have distracted and demolished shareholder value, I think the industry moves to the next level and we 10x from here,\u201d Saylor said.\n\n\u201cWhen banks and responsible custodians are managing #Bitcoin & the industry takes its eyes away from all of the shiny little tokens that have distracted & demolished shareholder value, I think the industry moves to the next level and we 10X from here.\u201d @saylor to @SaraEisen pic.twitter.com/sVKugHt7Tx \u2014 Brad Mills \ud83d\udd11\u26a1\ufe0f (@bradmillscan) November 2, 2023\n\nBitcoin has been riding high the last few weeks.

        "content": "Defining Bitcoin Ordinals The Role of Ordinals in Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin ordinals refer to the unique identification numbers assigned to each satoshi on the blockchain. They serve as a timestamp and help establish the order in which satoshis occur. Ordinal theory enables participants to verify the chronology of satoshis, ensuring that the network reaches a consensus on the state of the blockchain.\n\nWhen a Bitcoin transaction takes place, it is recorded on the blockchain, which is essentially a decentralized ledger. Each satoshi is assigned a unique ordinal number, which acts as a digital fingerprint. This ordinal number is generated using complex cryptographic algorithms, making it virtually impossible to tamper with or forge.\n\nBy using ordinal numbering, Bitcoin ensures that all participants can agree on the order of satoshis. This is crucial in a decentralized system where there is no central authority to validate and confirm transactions.\n\nExploring Bitcoin Inscriptions\n\nThe Purpose of Bitcoin Inscriptions\n\nBitcoin inscriptions are the actual messages or data that are recorded in the blockchain. They can be used to record any arbitrary data, but are also used to issue and transfer arbitrary tokens. In that case, they include details such as the sender, the recipient, the amount, and any additional information associated with the transaction. Inscriptions provide a comprehensive record of data inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain, enabling seamless auditing and verification.\n\nHow Bitcoin Inscriptions Contribute to Blockchain\n\nBitcoin inscriptions are committed to the blockchain using Bitcoin transactions, ensuring that they cannot be tampered with. These inscription transactions, along with the associated metadata, are organized into blocks and added to the blockchain by miners just like regular transactions. This distributed ledger structure guarantees immutability, providing the same degree of immutability to inscriptions as all other Bitcoin transactions.\n\nThe Connection Between Bitcoin Ordinals and Inscriptions\n\nHow Ordinals and Inscriptions Interact\n\nBitcoin ordinals and inscriptions work in harmony to create a robust and reliable system. Ordinals provide a means to associate an inscription with an owner, while inscriptions allow for a means to inscribe arbitrary data to the blockchain guaranteeing its availability. Together, they form an interconnected web of information that fuels the entire Ordinals ecosystem.\n\nThe Future of Bitcoin: Ordinals and Inscriptions\n\nHow Ordinals and Inscriptions Could Shape Bitcoin's Future\n\nBitcoin ordinals and inscriptions form the foundation of a secure and transparent digital artifact and token ecosystem. As the landscape evolves, their importance cannot be underestimated. Further research, innovation, and adoption in the field of ordinals and inscriptions will pave the way for a more robust and efficient Bitcoin network, ultimately shaping the future of digital finance, art, and collectibles.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

The resurgence which has see many FX pairs and Gold lose ground to the Greenback has had very little impact on the price of Bitcoin. There has been a sizeable shift in market sentiment around Crypto markets and Bitcoin in particular over the past month or so. This is reflected in the image below as the crypto fear and greed index has risen from 48 a month ago to 66 today, which keeps it in \u201cGreed\u201d territory.\n\nSource: FinancialJuice\n\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency ad crypto markets faced calls that it was dying toward the back end of 2022 before becoming the best performing asset of 2023. It does appear however that Crypto and blockchain technology are on their way to mainstream adoption. This is evidenced by the countless number of global institutions like JPMorgan, BNP Paribas and Santander are among those who are currently involved in various blockchain projects.\n\nThe hype around the ETF is justified as we have heard comments from many asset managers and CEOs confirming they are fielding many enquiries and calls regarding diversification into Crypto. This hype seems to be underpinning Bitcoin right now so if we do have a rejection of the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF then we could be in for a deeper retracement. Right now, it does appear that that markets are leaning on the side of an approval, will we get it though?\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nREAD MORE: HOW TO USE TWITTER FOR TRADERS\n\nRecommended by Zain Vawda Get Your Free Introduction To Cryptocurrency Trading Get My Guide\n\nTECHNICAL OUTLOOK AND FINAL THOUGHTS\n\nFrom a technical standpoint BTCUSD is currently stuck in a 2k range between the $33.3k and $35.3k. Price action is choppy as we appeared ready to make a new high before a bearish doji candle close yesterday hinting at a fresh low. However today we have seen the $34177 support area hold firm with the daily candle looking likely too close as a hammer candlestick. The question will be whether we can push on to make a fresh high above the $35.3k.\n\nOf course, we have the US FOMC meeting tomorrow evening which could stoke some volatility. However, looking at the resilience in Bitcoin today, I\u2019m hesitant to say that a hawkish Fed will push Bitcoin prices lower. Today saw a sizeable rally in the DXY and still Bitcoin prices have held the high ground, a sign of the buying pressure still present.\n\nKey Levels to Keep an Eye On:\n\nResistance levels:\n\n35000\n\n35300\n\n37500\n\nSupport levels:\n\n34177\n\n32528\n\n31493\n\nBTCUSD Daily Chart, October 31, 2023.\n\nSource: TradingView, chart prepared by Zain Vawda\n\nRecommended by Zain Vawda Get Your Free Top Trading Opportunities Forecast Get My Guide\n\n--- Written by Zain Vawda for DailyFX.com\n\nContact and follow Zain on Twitter: @zvawda"
