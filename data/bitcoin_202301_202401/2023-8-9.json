        "title": "SEC Should Reject Bitcoin ETF Filings Because They Will Expose Investors to Fraud, Manipulation, and Other Investor ... - Better Markets",
        "content": "WASHINGTON, D.C.\u2014Scott Farnin, Legal Counsel, issued the following statement on the filing of Better Markets\u2019 Comment Letters (found here and here) to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in response to multiple proposed rule changes filed by national securities exchanges to list and trade shares in spot bitcoin-based exchange traded products (\u201cETP\u201d):\n\n\u201cThe crypto industry\u2019s track record is clear when it comes to consumers, investors, and financial stability. The industry has suffered $2 trillion in losses; multiple enforcement actions, bankruptcies, and criminal prosecutions; and dozens of lawsuits for lying, cheating, and stealing. Meanwhile, the principal beneficiaries of the crypto craze are the criminals who use it to facilitate ransomware, money laundering, and illegal conduct of all types. It is within this context that the SEC must evaluate latest wave of Bitcoin ETF filings this month.\n\n\u201cFor years the SEC has rightfully rejected multiple attempts by national securities exchanges and sponsors to list and trade shares in spot bitcoin-based ETPs. Our comment letters urge the SEC to remain consistent with its previous orders disapproving such filings and reject the eight proposed rule changes pending before the agency.\n\n\u201cThe Exchange Act is explicit in providing that any proposed changes to national securities exchange rules must be designed to \u2018prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices\u2019 and \u2018to protect investors and the public interest.\u2019 The proposed rule changes at issue, which would enable the listing and trading of shares in spot bitcoin-based ETPs, fail to meet those statutory requirements and must be rejected.\n\n\u201cThe spot bitcoin markets (1) have a history of artificially inflated trading volumes due to rampant manipulation and wash trading; (2) are highly concentrated; and (3) rely on a select group of individuals and entities to maintain bitcoin\u2019s network. These are features of the bitcoin network that make a proposed spot bitcoin-based ETP extremely vulnerable to manipulation by bad actors, posing unnecessary risks to investors and the public interest. The proposed rule changes offer little to neutralize these threats. Their reliance on the surveillance of other markets to detect and address manipulation is wholly inadequate. For example, the CME bitcoin futures market is not a regulated market of significant size, and the surveillance-sharing agreements with Coinbase would add little or no value in detecting and deterring manipulation of any proposed spot bitcoin-based ETP. Products that pose such clear threats to investors and fail to comply with the core requirements of the law must be rejected.\u201d\n\nRead our full comment letters here and here.\n\n###\n\nBetter Markets is a non-profit, non-partisan, and independent organization founded in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to promote the public interest in the financial markets, support the financial reform of Wall Street and make our financial system work for all Americans again. Better Markets works with allies\u2014including many in finance\u2014to promote pro-market, pro-business and pro-growth policies that help build a stronger, safer financial system that protects and promotes Americans\u2019 jobs, savings, retirements and more.

        "content": "The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization briefly shot past $30,000 Tuesday evening, a sudden moment of volatility for Bitcoin in a month of comparative steadiness.\n\nThe token reached a high of $30,177 at about 5 p.m. ET before quickly falling to just above $29,800. The cryptocurrency is now trading at a similar mark after briefly jumping to $30,043. In the past week, Bitcoin is up nearly 2%.\n\nThe almost $1.2 trillion market for cryptocurrencies\u2014of which Bitcoin constitutes almost half\u2014is also up, about 1%, in the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap. Crypto prices are not in line with the broader stock market, as the S&P 500 is down nearly 2% and the Nasdaq almost 3% in the same time frame.\n\n\u201cThe rise in Bitcoin price so far is only about 3% off of recent lows,\u201d Chris Bendiksen, Bitcoin research lead at CoinShares, told Fortune in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s well within its historic daily volatility profile, so it shouldn\u2019t really warrant much excitement.\u201d\n\nFollowing lows of almost $16,000 to start the year, the price of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market cap has almost doubled after a disastrous 2022.\n\nIn the beginning of June, when Bitcoin was trading near $27,000, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued both Binance and Coinbase, two of the largest exchanges, and the broader crypto market tumbled, with Bitcoin nearly touching $25,000.\n\nHowever, just days later, BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, filed an application for a Bitcoin spot ETF, or a way for more traditional investors to gain exposure to the daily price swings of the cryptocurrency. Soon after, a flood of other firms filed applications for their own Bitcoin spot ETFs, and the price of the cryptocurrency soared to a year high of over $31,000.\n\nBitcoin hasn\u2019t pushed past that high-water mark since, but it has plateaued in a surprising bout of stability for a usually volatile asset.\n\n\u201cIn order to rekindle proper excitement in the markets,\u201d CoinShares\u2019 Bendiksen added, \u201cI believe we need to see a convincing breakout above $32,000, followed by a prolonged period of price holding above those levels.\u201d"

        "content": "MicroStrategy now owns roughly 0.75% of bitcoins in circulation and has shown no intention of slowing down its purchases.\n\nThe company\u2019s bitcoin (BTC) buy-and-hold strategy isn\u2019t exactly risk-free, one analyst said \u2014 though another industry watcher said the company is likely to only stop, and perhaps sell, if absolutely necessary.\n\nMicroStrategy owns 152,800 BTC \u2014 bought for $4.53 billion, or $29,672 per bitcoin. Its holdings have steadily ticked upwards, with the company buying in bull and bear markets alike.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to stop,\u201d said Lance Vitanza, managing director of equity research at TD Cowen.\n\nThe company did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nNo end in sight\n\nThe business intelligence software company run by bitcoin bull Michael Saylor kicked off its bitcoin acquisition strategy in August 2020.\n\nIt more recently bought 12,333 BTC for $347 million between April 29 and June 27 \u2014 its largest acquisition since June 2021. It then added 467 BTC to its stash in July.\n\nExecutives have been clear on earnings calls that the company plans to continue accumulating BTC over time using excess cash and net proceeds of capital markets transactions, including issuing convertible notes.\n\nMatthew Weller, global head of research at StoneX, said the company has become well-known for its \u201chybrid corporate strategy\u201d of converting profits from its core software intelligence business into BTC \u2014 an asset it views as a superior store of value.\n\n\u201cHaving already gone so far along this path, it\u2019s hard to see MicroStrategy stopping its bitcoin buying spree with any excess cash the operating company generates,\u201d Weller told Blockworks.\n\nVitanza said he expects the firm to limit buys to when market conditions are attractive \u2014 based upon the price of BTC and the price at which MicroStrategy can issue securities, either debt or equity.\n\nThe firm\u2019s stock price was $377.84 through Wednesday\u2019s close \u2014 up 160% on the year. The price of BTC was $29,390 at that time, a 77% increase from the start of 2023.\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s bitcoin buys are very much dependent on the relationship between those both prices, Vitanza argued.\n\n\u201cI am confident that the company has a model that is very specific and that has that algorithm plugged in.\u201d Vitanza said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as though they\u2019re just sitting there waking up in the morning saying, \u2018Hey, you know what, the stock\u2019s at $390 and bitcoin\u2019s at $30,000\u2019 \u2014 it feels like a good mix.\u201d\n\nMicroStrategy indicated in an August 1 filing that it had entered into a sales agreement with Cowen and Company, Canaccord Genuity and Berenberg Capital Markets to sell up to $750 million of stock with one or more of those entities.\n\nOn an earning call last week, Chief Financial Officer Andrew Kang said MicroStrategy could use the proceeds for \u201cgeneral corporate purposes,\u201d including to buy more bitcoin, or to repurchase or repay its outstanding debt.\n\nKang noted the company terminated its prior $625 million at-the-market (ATM) equity offering \u2014 of which about $290 million of capacity remained \u2014 to replace it with the $750 million facility.\n\n\u201cThey looked at it and said $290 million isn\u2019t enough, so that tells us something,\u201d Vitanze said. \u201cI would have expected that they would have continued to use the old facility until it was closer to zero. But the fact that they [wanted] to blow this thing up to a bigger size makes me think they are buying in the near term, or they were.\u201d\n\nBerenberg Capital Markets analysts said in an August 1 research note that they expect MicroStrategy to hold 156,800 BTC \u2014 4,000 BTC more than it does now \u2014 by April 2024.\n\nWhat are the risks, and when could they sell?\n\nMicroStrategy is not buying bitcoin based on six month price projections, Vitanza said.\n\nThe strategy, rather, he said, is based on the idea that over many years bitcoin will become an increasingly accepted form of money while fiat currencies continue to devalue.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they will sell it just to recognize gain,\u201d Vitanza said. \u201cBecause what are they going to do with the money? They\u2019re going to put it into a fiat currency, which is then going to be devalued at 10% per year.\u201d\n\nMicroStrategy would only sell bitcoin if they are in need of operational capital, to pay taxes or pay off dollar-denominated debt, the TD Cowen research managing director said. The company\u2019s outstanding debt and convertible notes amount to $2.2 billion.\n\nAbout half of that is set to come due as early as 2025, Vitanza said.\n\n\u201cIf the financing markets are awful and the company has no cash, then they might be in a position that they\u2019re forced to sell bitcoin to generate the dollars that they need to pay off their debt,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s unlikely, in my opinion, but I think that\u2019s kind of the only scenario.\u201d\n\nIn terms of risks for MicroStrategy, buying too much bitcoin is not one of them, Vitanza said. But buying bitcoin in a way that investors don\u2019t deem prudent could cause some to look to other vehicles to gain bitcoin exposure.\n\nRead more: MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin Buy Draws Criticism\n\nAnother such way could be via a spot bitcoin ETF \u2014 a product the Securities and Exchange Commission has not yet allowed to come to market, but that some believe could launch in the coming months after filings by BlackRock, Fidelity and others.\n\nWeller said the prospect of such a fund hitting the market after about a decade of attempts from a range of issuers could pose a \u201cbig risk\u201d for MicroStrategy.\n\n\u201cMany investors buy MicroStrategy stock as a widely available proxy to get exposure to Bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if a simple, low-fee alternative emerges, much of the current demand for the stock may dry up, leaving the highly-valued, slow-growing operating company to manage an unwieldy volatile balance sheet.\u201d\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF, if approved, \u201cwon\u2019t offer the same kind of leverage yield that MicroStrategy offers,\u201d Saylor said during the company\u2019s August 1 earnings call.\n\nA portion of institutional investors, however, will opt for a bitcoin ETF to get involved in the space, he acknowledged.\n\n\u201cMicroStrategy wouldn\u2019t be the right option for them because they really just need to be able to buy an unlimited amount of bitcoin, without worrying about not tracking the bitcoin price and with clarity and transparency,\u201d Saylor said. \u201cSo I think that will expand the pie\u2026and MicroStrategy is going to continue to be thoughtful and responsible about managing our business in order to find ways to get incremental bitcoin for our investors.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Exploring BTC trends \u2013 is Bitcoin entering its industrial phase? - TechHQ",
        "content": "Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has its fans and critics. And to understand what makes this cryptocurrency so polarizing, it\u2019s worth investing a small amount of time in unpacking the concept of money. By doing so, you can appreciate the opportunities and concerns on both sides of the digital coin, as well as gain a perspective on potential BTC trends over the longer term.\n\nGoing back centuries, civilizations have purchased goods and services using various means, including exchanging livestock and paying in shells. Fast forward to today, and we have trusted fiat currencies such as the US dollar, EURO, British Pound, and Chinese Yuan.\n\nAnd while digital payments increasingly dominate, technically \u2013 for example, in the case of the British Pound issued by the Bank of England \u2013 it is the physical notes and coins that represent the promise of payment from the central bank to the bearer of the currency.\n\nThis begs the question as to why people are so happy to give their money to retail banks and send funds electronically \u2013 if those numbers in the various accounts aren\u2019t, strictly speaking, legal tender. And the answer is that those traditional financial services have government backing.\n\n\u201cMaking a deposit into a bank or building society account is like giving your trust to that organisation,\u201d writes the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), which monitors banks and building societies in the UK. \u201cYou trust that it will look after your money and, when you want to access that money again, it will be there.\u201d\n\nCustomers of conventional financial institutions have protection up to a certain value. And while this oversight and government backing is mostly successful in keeping the wheels of traditional finance turning \u2013 the promise of payment is only directly tied to the cash in your pocket.\n\nPlus \u2013 as wobbles throughout history have shown \u2013 if confidence in the ability of the government to control its finances dips, so does the value of that promise to pay the bearer. And when times are shaky, investors reach instead for gold, which has been seen to hold its value during turbulent times.\n\nAnd this brings the discussion to the idea of cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin\u2019s main fork, dubbed Bitcoin Core (BTC), which some advocate has the potential to become a kind of \u2018digital gold\u2019.\n\nHow does BTC work and what is crypto mining?\n\nThe best way to understand crypto mining is to simply look at a block in the BTC blockchain. And there are a couple of key details to focus on. The first is the hash, indicated in the screengrab below by a green arrow, and the second is the so-called \u2018nonce\u2019.\n\nA hash digest is a fixed-length code that\u2019s commonly used as an integrity check on digital files. The one-way function generates a unique fingerprint of a file\u2019s contents. And, if the hash function is truly collision-proof, then no two inputs will produce the same output.\n\nFor example, if you apply a SHA256 hash (the function used to digest blocks when crypto mining BTC) to the phrase \u2018Helloworld\u2019 you get \u2013\n\n5ab92ff2e9e8e609398a36733c057e4903ac6643c646fbd9ab12d0f6234c8daf\n\nBut if we re-run the SHA256 hash on \u2018Helloworld+1\u2019, the one-way function generates a different code, or fingerprint \u2013\n\n4865d2b4b49f88cc5a721fdc7ff210878f657219d5a768e317134b66a18a4605\n\nAnd this tells us quickly that the input (which, rather than our simple example, could instead be a GB-sized file and hence enable rapid integrity checks for software such as large operating system updates) has been modified. Also, while the fingerprint is impossible to predict, we can engineer patterns in the output by adding random values to the input.\n\nIn our case and sticking with the SHA256 algorithm, if we try \u2018Helloworld+1580358748\u2019, we get \u2013\n\n5a0506dd28159d6d8bb1e1e2a3edc4d10e1fa2519193726e9bff6960887a2aa2\n\nAnd you\u2019ll notice that adding \u20181580358748\u2019 to the list of cryptocurrency transactions comprising BTC block #802502 (plus a hash of the previous block, to secure the blockchain) produces a string of zeros at the front of the hash digest \u2013\n\n00000000000000000001a3c8e6069d5a7d7c7236c91953bfd356794211151b04\n\nFinding a suitable \u2018nonce\u2019, which can be added to a block so that its hash has a string of preceding zeros, gets to the heart of bitcoin mining. And although the exercise may sound a little abstract, it gives BTC coins \u2013 which are issued to the crypto miner that\u2019s first to solve the challenge for each block \u2013 their scarcity.\n\nWith the blocks themselves representing sequences of transactions, stamped with an integrity check thanks to the hash functions, we now have the makings of a digital currency. What\u2019s more, if a bad actor wanted to rewrite history and change any of the entries on the digital ledger, the hash would fail to match due to the modified contents.\n\nPlus, coming up with new \u2018nonces\u2019 \u2013 which is a trial and error process \u2013 represents too big a challenge were adversaries to try and cover their tracks.\n\nDigital gold, or not?\n\nLikening BTC to gold serves as a useful comparison in picturing a possible role for future cryptocurrencies. Although, time has yet to pass the same degree of judgement on BTC, with gold having been accepted for thousands of years as a trusted store of value.\n\n\u201cBitcoin and gold are similar from both a psychological perspective and, especially, as a resource,\u201d write the economists Wolfgang H\u00e4rdle, Campbell Harvey, and Raphael Reule in a useful discussion paper on \u2018Understanding Cryptocurrencies\u2019 [PDF]. \u201cNeither can be created arbitrarily: each must be mined and each has a finite supply (at least on planet Earth)\u201d.\n\nREAD NEXT Blockchain token economy secures swarm robots\n\nSimilarly, just as it takes energy to extract gold from rock buried underground, it typically requires a vast number of guesses before crypto miners discover a suitable nonce. The probability of an input generating an output with zero as the first digit is 1 in 16 (the hash digest is hexadecimal). But to find 19 leading zeros, as in the hash digest of BTC block #802502, drops that likelihood to just (1/16)19 \u2013 an incredibly small number.\n\nThe probability of successfully hashing a new block is many times less than winning a national lottery. But, of course, crypto miners can (sticking with the example of a lottery) buy trillions of tickets per second to boost their chances of hitting upon a valid guess.\n\nLooking at the hash rate for BTC \u2013 the number of guesses being made on finding a suitable nonce value \u2013 that figure is more than 382 million per second, and it\u2019s measured in units of terahashes (1 trillion guesses).\n\nIn the physical world, mining equipment is big and bulky and requires industrial scale power. And the analogy holds for digital crypto mining rigs too. To be competitive, crypto miners need pools of computing hardware that\u2019s been designed specifically for the task.\n\nUnits such as Bitmain\u2019s popular S19 model, which is specified as delivering a hashrate of 151 terahashes per second (TH/s) and consumes more than 3kW of power at the wall, are whirring away all over the world (where allowed) to validate BTC transactions on a decentralized digital ledger.\n\nLong-term BTC trends\n\nCritics of such a consensus mechanism, dubbed proof-of-work, point to the power that\u2019s consumed. But, without coming down on either side of the fence, it should be noted that managing traditional currencies consumes energy too. There\u2019s a vast amount of backend services supporting modern banking operations, and it\u2019s the price to pay for running systems that customers trust.\n\nAs mentioned, the use of gold goes back thousands of years, which is ages long compared with the not-yet two-decade-old practice of BTC crypto mining. We live in interesting times with ambitious projects to deliver zero-knowledge proof, privacy-preserving World IDs, and the boom in AI.\n\nThere\u2019s an element of the unknown when new technologies emerge, and it\u2019s fair to say that cryptocurrencies occupy that space. Parallels with the utility of gold may serve as a guide on how the story of BTC plays out, but time will tell whether Bitcoin has similar appeal, and that clock has only just started ticking."

        "content": "Over the past two years, public blockchain adoption has been driven by three primary use cases:\n\ndecentralized finance (DeFi), which provides an open financial system built using smart contracts on public blockchains\n\nnon-fungible tokens (NFTs) that certify ownership of digital assets and enable broad transferability of those digital assets\n\ndigital currency payments that enable value transfer without intermediate institutions\n\nIn addition to the adoption driven by the early Web3 innovators, regulated enterprises are also increasing their use of public blockchains. For example, financial institutions such as Ita\u00fa Bank and Fidelity are entering into the cryptocurrency space as trusted, regulated custodians and exchanges. Other institutions, such as Nasdaq, are enabling cryptocurrency for traditional finance as technology providers. Media companies such as Warner Music Group and consumer companies such as Nike continue to incorporate NFTs into their event ticketing and loyalty programs. Payment processors such as Visa and Mastercard are offering cryptocurrency debit cards and solutions for merchants.\n\nHowever, the growing adoption has also highlighted one of the growing challenges of building with blockchain, which is data. The immutability of blockchain transactions, a strength of the technology, means that the data can only grow with time. And although this data is stored publicly and can be accessed by everyone, transforming this information into a performant and accurate format that can be accessed efficiently at scale by applications is a challenge for many customers.\n\nIn this post, we describe the general challenges of working with blockchain data and introduce how Amazon Managed Blockchain Query, a feature of Amazon Managed Blockchain, can help you access blockchain data quickly so you can focus on building differentiators for the mainstream businesses and consumers.\n\nChallenges of blockchain data\n\nAt a high level, the challenges of preparing blockchain data is similar to many other big data problems: complicated ETL (extract, transform, and load) processes, disparate sources of information, and expensive storage.\n\nFirst, the method in which blockchain data is stored poses challenges for application use. Blockchain data is essentially stored as a ledger of state transformations between each block. That is, the information captures what changed from block n to block n+1, such as balance changes in addresses or new smart contracts being deployed. This structure, although well-suited for ensuring data integrity and security on a decentralized network, isn\u2019t ideally suited for tasks like data analysis or developing applications that need to run complex queries. There are no simple data views that can serve commonly requested data in a performant manner that application builders are used to. Take for example a wallet developer, who needs to load the historical wallet balance of a user in seconds. To run the queries efficiently, they would first need to download the entire blockchain ledger (which could be several hundreds of gigabytes in size and requires connecting to blockchain nodes) from multiple blockchains such as Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Polygon. Following this, the data would need to be indexed in a database system that allows efficient queries\u2014a task that presents a significant computational challenge, especially when dealing with larger blockchains.\n\nSecond, in order to provide real-time data, developers have to adapt their system for blockchain finality, which is the assurance that that past transactions can never change. Because blockchains are global and decentralized, it takes a certain time (or number of blocks) for the network to reach an agreement, or consensus, about the blockchain\u2019s legitimate state. During this time, which could range from minutes to hours, data received by a blockchain node may be replaced by another dataset that is recognized by the network as legitimate. In busy times with many transactions being submitted to different nodes, blockchains may revert transactions from multiple blocks. This characteristic of eventual finality is challenging for developers because in such cases, they have to correct the data they have already processed and calculated (such as balances), while still keeping up to date with the streaming information from the blockchain. This also causes problems in situations demanding real-time data for decision-making processes. Take for example a financial application interacting with public blockchains. A high-value trade could potentially be run based on a confirmed transaction in the system. However, this transaction could be later reversed if the network acknowledges another chain as the true one. The financial implications of such a reversal could be significant, demonstrating the inherent risk and complexity associated with streaming real-time data from the blockchain.\n\nThird, developers must assimilate data from multiple sources to construct a complete picture of transactions and interactions in a manner that is easy for humans to understand. With applications now expected to be deployed across multiple blockchains, developers have to process information from different blockchains with potentially different standards. Data stored on the blockchain includes critical information such as the from address, to address, transaction amount, and address of the token smart contract. Blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum both store data in completely different structures, and as such, developers who wish to access data from these blockchains must navigate these differences in data structure and JSON-RPC API options to extract that data in a usable manner.\n\nFourth, developers sometimes have to rerun smart contracts to understand the fine-grained details of their operations. This is one of the most resource-intensive challenges when working with blockchain data. Smart contracts are self-running contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. However, the current flexibility in how different smart contract developers code their functions and emit events on the blockchain makes tracking vital information such as balances or transaction details an arduous task. To interact with the distributed applications on the blockchain, such as decentralized lending platforms or decentralized exchanges, transactions often involve calling multiple smart contracts. Smart contracts often interact with each other and their behavior can vary based on the blockchain\u2019s state. Consequently, obtaining an accurate understanding of what a smart contract was doing at a specific point in time often entails recreating the entire state of the blockchain at that moment and tracing the transactions. For example, consider a music artist offers a token-gated event where only holders of that artist\u2019s Non-Fungible Token (NFT) collection on a given date would be admitted to a live concert. To verify the exact conditions under which an individual may be granted access to the event \u2014such as the token balance of a given user\u2019s wallet at a historical point in time or the exact NFT that user owned\u2014a developer might have to recreate the entire state of the blockchain at a given time to determine who should and should not be granted access to the event, depending on smart contract design. This process is computationally expensive and time-consuming, presenting considerable challenges in terms of efficiency and scalability.\n\nAMB Query \u2013 Key Features\n\nIn this section, we discuss key features of Managed Blockchain Query and how it supports builders\u2019 blockchain data needs.\n\nCost-efficient public blockchain data\n\nManaged Blockchain Query provides standardized APIs to retrieve blockchain data from multiple public blockchains, starting with Bitcoin and Ethereum, without requiring you to provision or manage infrastructure for blockchain nodes nor maintain indexing infrastructure to extract, transform, and load blockchain data for use in your applications. Managed Blockchain Query APIs offer predictable pricing by allowing you to pay only for the API requests you make, paying per million requests based on pricing buckets that are priced according to the compute and data resources required to render the result for the API request.\n\nTo illustrate the cost-efficiency of Managed Blockchain Query, imagine you operate a custodial digital asset wallet that interacts with the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. Imagine the monthly demand for this wallet requires 20 million requests for token balances for user addresses on Bitcoin and .5 million requests to get transaction events (for example, transaction inputs and outputs) for Bitcoin. Additionally, the wallet must accommodate 5 million requests for token balances for Ethereum assets and 2.5 million requests for Ethereum transaction events. The cost for this request traffic is calculated in the following table (in the us-east-1 Region).\n\nReliable and highly available\n\nWith REST APIs available in the supported Regions backed by robust data indexing infrastructure and ETL pipelines, Managed Blockchain Query provides reliable and highly available access to public blockchain data across multiple chains. Managed Blockchain Query follows the AWS high standard for reliability, so you can build your application to use Managed Blockchain Query with confidence. Furthermore, you no longer have to guess about capacity, because Managed Blockchain Query APIs scale with your request volume to service your requests at subsecond latency. Managed Blockchain Query also provides high availability, and you can expect 99.9% availability from the service.\n\nRegardless of whether you are building a proof of concept or a high-scale production workload, Managed Blockchain Query can support your blockchain data query needs.\n\nAccelerate development of Web3 applications with developer-friendly REST APIs\n\nManaged Blockchain Query offers APIs that reduce the time and complexity involved in rendering public blockchain data insights to your applications and your users. For example, with a single API call, you can retrieve a list of transactions sent and received from a given wallet address on Ethereum, which makes it easy to populate a user interface with historical transaction details. Furthermore, you can use Managed Blockchain Query to get the current finalized and historical balance for native coins (such as ETH and BTC) and non-native tokens (such as ERC20) with subsecond latency. You can use this API to retrieve individual tokens as well as to retrieve a full list of token balances for a given wallet address. Managed Blockchain Query APIs make common blockchain data insights readily available to developers to use within a myriad of applications, such as web and mobile wallets, analytics pipelines, trading applications, and more, helping developers with dependencies on blockchain data launch products faster.\n\nUse cases for Managed Blockchain Query\n\nManaged Blockchain Query delivers common public blockchain data in a simple way to developers, without requiring custom data indexing and query infrastructure. For example, imagine a digital wallet that needs to display a list of historical transactions and current balances for Ethereum tokens (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155 and native Ether (ETH). With Managed Blockchain Query APIs, this data is available with a simple REST API call. You can learn more about each API in the Managed Blockchain Query collection in Managed Blockchain Query Developer Guide.\n\nIn this section, we discuss a variety of lower-level use cases that Managed Blockchain Query APIs can address.\n\nQuery current and historical token balances on public blockchains\n\nThe GetTokenBalance API provides a way to get the balance of native coins (ETH, BTC) and various tokens (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155), which can be used to get the current balance of an externally owned account (EOA) or a historical balance using a universal timestamp (Unix timestamp, in seconds). For example, you can use the GetTokenBalance API to get an address\u2019s balance of an ERC20 token, USDC, on the Ethereum mainnet. You can also retrieve balances of tokens in a batch by providing a list of coins or tokens for which to get balances using the BatchGetTokenBalance API.\n\nRetrieve historical transaction data for a given address\n\nWith Managed Blockchain Query, you can easily retrieve historical data from public blockchains such as Ethereum. This enables several use cases, like populating transaction history on a mobile or desktop crypto wallet or providing contextual information about a transaction based on its transaction hash. In this example, you can use the ListTransactions and GetTransaction APIs to first get a list of all transactions for a given externally owned address (EOA) on the Ethereum mainnet, and then retrieve transaction details for a single transaction in the list.\n\nGet all token balances for a given address\n\nThe ListTokenBalances API is a powerful tool for wallets, user interfaces, Web3 utilities, and more, because it returns a list of all balances for an address across both tokens (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155) and native coins (ETH, BTC) on a given public blockchain in a single API call. In this example, you can provide an EOA and a network on the Ethereum mainnet, and receive a list of token and native coin balances on Ethereum in the response.\n\nGet all tokens minted by a smart contract\n\nThe ListTokenBalances API can also return a list of all tokens (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155) minted by a smart contract when passed the smart contract address as input. For example, you can retrieve information related to NFTs minted by an ERC721 smart contract on Ethereum in a single API call.\n\nList events emitted by a given transaction\n\nThe ListTransactionEvents API allows you to retrieve a list of smart contract standard events that are emitted as a result of a given transaction, identified by its hash (transaction identifier). For example, you can use ListTransactionEvents to inspect the resulting events of a transaction that calls a function of an ERC20 token smart contract on Ethereum, such as a Transfer event.\n\nUsing AMB Query in the AWS Management Console\n\nThe AWS Management Console experience for Amazon Managed Blockchain Query offers a graphical user interface query editor that allows you to test Query APIs straight from your browser via your AWS account. To illustrate how to use the query editor, this example details how to use the ListTransactions API to retrieve a full list of transactions an EOA has been party to.\n\nNavigate to the AWS Management Console and sign into your AWS account. Then navigate to the Amazon Managed Blockchain service using the search bar and select the \u201cQuery public blockchains\u201d radio button on the right-hand side of the screen. Finally, select \u201cLaunch AMB Query\u201d.\n\nOnce on the query editor page, you must select between the Bitcoin network or Ethereum mainnet as the target for your query. For this example, select \u201cETHERUM_MAINNET\u201d from the \u201cBlockchain network\u201d dropdown.\n\nThen, select the AMB Query API you wish to run from the \u201cQuery type\u201d dropdown, which in this case will be \u201cListTokenBalances\u201d.\n\nThen, fill in both required and/or optional query parameters to finalize your request for blockchain data. In this example, provide an Ethereum externally owned account (EOA) address and any filters by date/time that are relevant.\n\nAfter adding all necessary details to your request, select \u201cRun query\u201d to receive results for your request. If no results are returned, verify that you are using an EOA that has transactions occurring within any date/time filters you have set for your request.\n\nYou may use the AMB Query editor in the AWS Management Console to test all supported AMB Query APIs and explore the Bitcoin and Ethereum data these APIs offer. AMB Query is a pay-as-you-go service billed based on your usage of APIs, thus no resources have been provisioned in your account as part of this hands-on example that need to be deleted.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this post, we addressed the common challenges builders face when working with blockchain data, as well as how Managed Blockchain Query can address many of those challenges.

        "content": "STEVENS POINT, Wis. (WBAY) - Stevens Point police, firefighters, and UPS saved a woman from losing $16,000 to scam.\n\nStevens Point police say scammers emailed a 79-year-old woman that she had bogus charges on her PayPal account. Through an elaborate scheme, they directed her to withdraw money from her bank and deposit it at a Bitcoin cryptocurrency ATM.\n\nWhen that didn\u2019t work, she tried sending the $16,000 in cash through UPS to an address in Texas.\n\n\u201cShe made multiple attempts to deposit money in the machines and then she went to mail it through UPS. They told her they thought she was being victimized, and they took her package -- they weren\u2019t going to mail her package -- and they let their investigators know, and then that is how we got involved,\u201d Stevens Point Police Lt. Joe Johnson said.\n\nThe woman was able to deposit the money in the cryptocurrency ATM eventually.\n\nUsing a search warrant, police and firefighters were able to get into the machine and find the woman\u2019s cash.\n\nOur sister station WSAW reports two more people came to the same Bitcoin ATM to deposit large sums of money while detectives were investigating the first case. Police stopped them before they lost any money. The would-be victims were told similar stories as the first woman.\n\nPolice say the scammers had also directed the older woman to buy gift cards, send the cards to them and cut up all the receipts.\n\nStevens Point police say these scams seem to involve messages received through email or text saying there is a problem with a financial account, their computer has been hacked, or that their account shows evidence of child pornography or other criminal activities. Once the victim makes contact with the scammers on the phone, they are told there are fraudulent charges on their accounts.\n\nScammers seemed to know the correct balance of the victims\u2019 bank accounts, making the scam more believable to the victims. They might have accessed that information through spyware.\n\nAs we told you in a Consumer First Alert about investment scams, consumer experts say many of these scams go unreported because people are embarrassed. It\u2019s important to talk to your friends, parents, and grandparents about these scams and how they work. Remind them it\u2019s not their fault and if they\u2019re a victim to report it to the police.\n\nCopyright 2023 WBAY. All rights reserved."

        "content": "Kentucky\u2019s utility regulator has approved more than $4 million in electricity cost discounts over several years for a Bitcoin mining operation being run by Kentucky\u2019s largest coal producer.\n\nThe Kentucky Public Service Commission (PSC) in its Monday order said the economic development incentives offered by Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities (LG&E and KU) to Bitiki-KY, a Bitcoin mining subsidiary of coal company Alliance Resource Partners, would be unlikely to harm LG&E and KU\u2019s ratepayers, and the costs of the discounts would likely be covered.\n\nThe commission opened a case last year investigating the reasonableness of the electricity discounts, known as an economic development rider, given to Bitiki-KY and two other cryptocurrency mining operations after environmental and renewable advocacy organizations raised concerns about the incentives.\n\nThe groups \u2014 including Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, Kentucky Solar Energy Society and the Kentucky Resources Council \u2014 questioned whether the jobs created by cryptocurrency mining were worth the discounts and whether the discounts should be saved for other industries that employ more Kentuckians.\n\nAlliance promised to create five jobs and invest $25 million as part of the agreement for the discounts. During a commission hearing, one LG&E and KU employee said the utility didn\u2019t have a way to ensure employees aren\u2019t being double-counted from another part of Alliance\u2019s business.\n\nAlliance is operating high-powered computers on top of a former coal mine in Union County, not far from the sprawling coal company\u2019s largest underground mine that produced more than 10 million tons of coal in 2022. Alliance\u2019s CEO is Joseph Craft III, whose wife Kelly Craft lost an expensive race to become the Republican nominee for governor earlier this year.\n\nMining cryptocurrency requires immense amounts of electricity to power high-capacity computers that perform complicated mathematical calculations, securing online transactions of virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. Mining operations are compensated for solving the calculations with Bitcoin itself, valued at nearly $30,000 as of early August.\n\nThe environmental and renewable energy groups argued before the commission that LG&E and KU had not provided evidence of job creation by Alliance through its Bitcoin mining operation, nor had LG&E and KU offered evidence Alliance would have relocated its operation without the discounts.\n\nIn its Monday order, the commission said LG&E and KU is not required under existing state regulations \u201cto demonstrate minimum levels of investment or job creation\u201d as a part of the economic development incentives.\n\n\u201cBitiki has asserted that it plans to make $25 million in capital investments and its project will create five jobs,\u201d the commission order stated. \u201cThe Commission has no reason to doubt the veracity of Bitiki\u2019s assertions.\u201d\n\nLG&E and KU spokesperson Natasha Collins said the utility was \u201cpleased\u201d with the commission\u2019s decision to approve the discounts and that it determines whether to offer economic development incentives based on, in part, if a company also receives incentives from state government. Bitiki-KY in March 2022 received $250,000 in tax benefits from the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority.\n\n\u201cThis helps ensure that our EDR candidates have bona fide economic development projects in the view of the Commonwealth. We rely on that vetting process as well as the plausible representations of prospective EDR customers with regard to potential job creation,\u201d Collins said.\n\nAlliance did not respond to a request for comment on the order.\n\nThom Cmar, a senior attorney for Earthjustice representing the environmental and renewable energy groups in the PSC case, said the groups were \u201cdisappointed\u201d in the commission\u2019s decision to approve the discounts. He also said the regulator\u2019s order didn\u2019t address the fact that Alliance was operating its Bitcoin mining operation with the electricity discounts suspended during the commission\u2019s investigation.\n\n\u201cIf the company in particular is already operating without those discounts, there really ought to be compelling evidence in the record as to why they need them,\u201d Cmar said. \u201cKentucky Utilities did not attempt to provide that type of evidence, and the commission made a judgment that it wasn\u2019t necessary to dig into that issue.\u201d\n\nAn LG&E and KU employee said in past commission testimony that the Bitcoin mining operation\u2019s electricity usage hinged on receiving the discounts: Alliance would likely not increase its power usage at its Bitcoin mining site from 10 megawatts to 13 megawatts without the discounts.\n\nCmar said he hopes the commission in separate investigations it is conducting will deny economic development incentives given by utility Kentucky Power to two other cryptocurrency mining operations. One of those operations would likely be the state\u2019s largest cryptocurrency mining facility and have the capacity to use up to 250 megawatts of electricity.\n\n\u201cWe just think it\u2019s important that the commission give all of these contracts close scrutiny and make sure that these economic development discounts are being used for actual meaningful economic development, and [we] don\u2019t believe that the cryptocurrency facilities for which they\u2019ve been proposed are providing that,\u201d Cmar said."

This margin is around 0.5% and depends on market conditions.\n\nOn top of the spread, PayPal charges the following transaction fees based on the purchase amount:\n\nPurchase amount Fee $1.00 - $4.99 $0.49. $5.00 - $24.99 $0.99. $25.00 - $74.99 $1.99. $75.00 - $200.00 $2.49. $200.01 - $1,000.00 1.80%. >$1,000.00 1.50%.\n\nHolding crypto on PayPal\n\nThere are no fees for holding crypto on PayPal. You can view the amount of crypto you hold, and its market value, in the same tab you used to purchase.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to hold a significant amount of crypto, a wallet is a more secure option.\n\n\u00bb Ready for a wallet? Here are our top picks\n\nSelling crypto on PayPal\n\nOnce you have crypto assets in your PayPal account, you\u2019ll be able to view the current price and sell through the same tab. The fees for selling are the same as the fees for purchases: a per-transaction fee, plus the 0.5% market spread.\n\nProceeds from the sale will go to your PayPal account, where you can use the funds to make purchases or transfer them to your bank account.\n\nTransferring crypto into your PayPal address\n\nSelect your chosen coin in the Crypto tab and use the transfers button to move coins into PayPal from an outside source. The platform doesn\u2019t charge fees for transferring, but your wallet or exchange may charge a sender fee. The transfers button looks like this:\n\nYou may need to confirm your tax information, including your Social Security number, before continuing. Once verified, you can select \u201cReceive.\u201d\n\nPayPal will generate a unique address for your transfer, which you can copy and paste manually or share with a QR code. As with any crypto transfer, make sure you input this address correctly. Coins sent to the wrong address can\u2019t be recovered.\n\nThe address generated will work for only this specific transfer; this is not a private key.\n\n\u00bb Learn more about private keys: How to get a crypto wallet\n\nTransferring crypto from your PayPal wallet\n\nSelect your chosen coin in the Crypto tab and use the transfers button to send your crypto out of PayPal into an external wallet. Again, PayPal doesn\u2019t charge a specific fee for transfers, but you\u2019ll likely be charged a blockchain network fee, which applies to most crypto transactions between platforms.\n\nIf your identity is verified, you can select \u201cSend\u201d and enter the wallet address where you want to send your crypto. Similar to the receiving feature, you can copy and paste the address or scan a QR code to ensure you enter it correctly.\n\nSending crypto to another PayPal user\n\nSending crypto to another PayPal user is easier than transferring it in or out of the platform, and there are no fees, including the blockchain network fee.\n\nChoose the coin in your Crypto tab and use the transfers button to send coins to another user.\n\nSelect \u201cSend\u201d and choose the user you\u2019re sending to in your PayPal contacts. You\u2019ll be able to double-check the amount and the destination before you confirm.\n\nPayPal cryptocurrency alerts\n\nThe PayPal app can send push notifications that alert users to crypto price changes. You can customize these alerts with a specific currency and the desired percentage price increase or drop: 5%, 8% or 10%. Crypto alerts can be found in the app\u2019s settings under the bell icon.\n\nDoes PayPal offer tax forms?\n\nYes, PayPal will provide users with any necessary 1099 forms and report the same information to the IRS. All crypto sales on PayPal are taxable.\n\nTrack your finances all in one place Get started by signing up and linking an account. Sign Up\n\nWhat protections does PayPal offer?\n\nLike with other exchanges, your crypto funds on PayPal aren\u2019t eligible for Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. coverage, which would normally protect up to the first $250,000 in deposits.\n\nPayPal Buyer Protection also doesn\u2019t apply to cryptocurrency purchases, though PayPal says crypto purchases will be protected from unauthorized activity. In the event of an unauthorized transfer, you may be eligible for reimbursement up to the equivalent of $50,000.\n\nIf you suspect fraudulent activity on your account, PayPal says you should file a claim through the customer resolution center."

        "title": "The PayPal stablecoin is bigger news than any bitcoin ETF - Blockworks",
        "content": "The launch of PayPal\u2019s stablecoin \u2014 PYUSD \u2014 is the biggest crypto news in 2023, more significant than news about any future bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nPayPal has always been an early crypto adopter relative to their banking and fintech peer group. In September 2020, they helped initiate the bull cycle by being the first large fintech to allow their millions of users to buy crypto.\n\nPayPal\u2019s entry into crypto helped legitimize it as an asset class and changed the agenda of board meetings globally \u2014 directors started asking CEOs \u201cwhat is your crypto strategy?\u201d and companies rushed to develop slide decks, partnerships and a broad suite of products: The impact could be felt globally from Mexico to Brazil and beyond.\n\nChad Cascarilla, the CEO of Paxos, summarized the industry sentiment well \u2014 \u201cBefore they were afraid to be first, now they\u2019re afraid to be left behind.\u201d\n\nPYUSD is a similar watershed moment for the industry, coming at a critical time when stablecoin volume outstanding is increasingly moving to offshore options such as USDT.\n\nPayPal entering the crypto space adds legitimacy to stablecoins and paves the way for additional companies to incorporate regulated stablecoins into their platforms or launch their own.\n\nBack to the headline \u2014 why is this bigger news than the bitcoin ETF?\n\nThrough PYUSD, PayPal is on a journey to onboard millions of people to crypto and public blockchains, while a bitcoin ETF would instead ultimately lock users into the traditional financial system. PYUSD can be sent to public Ethereum addresses 24/7/365, as opposed to ETF products that would trade only during market hours.\n\nTo be clear, the bitcoin ETF is a great milestone for our industry. But it ultimately comes with the same legacy challenges of a closed system \u2014 consumers still need accounts issued by intermediaries to access the ETF and need to pay recurring fees to hold the asset. A bitcoin ETF would enable a greater swath of the traditional financial system to gain price exposure to bitcoin, but it still does not help make public blockchains universally useful or accessible.\n\nPYUSD, however, increases both utility and accessibility, enabling anyone globally (across borders) to permissionlessly access and use trusted US dollars in legacy and novel financial products. It also further legitimizes public blockchains as reliable platforms for value exchange and innovation.\n\nWhy would Paypal launch a stablecoin?\n\nThe first reason for PayPal to launch a stablecoin is to capture payments that would otherwise be completed through other channels.\n\nA major challenge of closed loop payment systems is that they require both sender and receiver to have accounts. PYUSD, however, enables an open loop system \u2014 it\u2019s possible to use this stablecoin without even having a PayPal account at all.\n\nSaid differently, the advent of a PayPal stablecoin makes a user\u2019s PayPal balance more universally useful.\n\nIf a consumer wants to pay with PayPal but the merchant doesn\u2019t have a PayPal account, the merchant can simply provide a blockchain address and the PayPal app could issue a PYUSD withdrawal to immediately settle the transaction. Without an open system, the transaction would have been completed through a different payment channel or not completed at all.\n\nSecond, PayPal is uniquely positioned to solve the massive opportunity of fiat onboarding \u2014 they have the banking relationships, regulatory framework and infrastructure to onboard millions of dollars to millions of wallets.\n\nRead more: Why the PayPal stablecoin could be different than Meta\u2019s diem\n\nSeamless fiat on/off boarding is still a largely unsolved but important unlock for the crypto ecosystem, and a key opportunity for brands like PayPal to build recurring relationships with customers. And critically, by both being a fiat on-ramp and a stablecoin issuer, PayPal can maintain a customer relationship after onramping the dollar into PYUSD, unlike other onramps where value is derived during the transaction alone.\n\nThirdly, I expect that PayPal\u2019s stablecoin could dramatically reduce costs for their global settlement operations.\n\nPayPal makes it easy for someone like me to checkout at a small merchant on a trip to Colombia, but the merchant is charged high fees (up to 4%) to help PayPal cover the settlement costs from USD to local currency and fund the banking operations. However, if PayPal can settle the transaction in USD instead of needing to convert to local currency, they can dramatically reduce their cost basis while still providing currency conversion services upon request, perhaps even through on-chain software instead of banks.\n\nLastly \u2014 and importantly \u2014 stablecoins are good businesses, especially in high interest rate environments. Tether alone made $800+ million last quarter from stablecoin issuance. Even if PayPal can capture $500+ million from interest payments, not including the other revenue streams stablecoins unlock, they could increase their net income by almost 50% and provide recurring, low-risk free cash flow.\n\nWhere PayPal goes from here\n\nEither at launch or soon after, PayPal will likely focus on PYUSD withdrawals to private wallets, merchant payments and issuance on additional blockchains to build more reasons for users to hold and use PYUSD.\n\nI also expect their entry will formally kick off the stablecoin wars, driving many positive narratives and launches for crypto over the next six months.\n\nWhile other known stablecoin issuers are facing declining volumes or regulatory headwinds, PayPal is well positioned to expand stablecoin adoption through its advantages: A trusted brand, a strong regulatory stack and a large e-commerce network.\n\nDisclaimer: I was previously a Product Lead at Paxos from 2020-2022 and worked directly with the PayPal team.

        "content": "While a decision from the Securities and Exchange Commission on the future of spot bitcoin ETFs could come as soon as this weekend, Bitwise Asset Management CIO Matt Hougan warns that crypto investors might have to wait a while longer.\n\n\"In every case since 2016, [the SEC] has taken up to or entirety of the 240 days they have to review these applications,\" Hougan told CNBC's Bob Pisani on \"ETF Edge\" on Monday.\n\nFollowing ARK's application for the spot iteration of the fund, a June 15 filing in the Federal Register named Aug. 13 as the deadline for the SEC to give a thumbs up or thumbs down on the exchange-traded fund.\n\nBut the SEC also has the option to stretch the deadline, with a final response not coming until as late as January 2024 for the Ark, Hougan explained.\n\n\"These are complex applications with a lot of data,\" he said. \"I think they're likely to extend this until the final review.\"\n\nHougan noted there have been a series of positive indicators for the fund's approval, such as surveillance-sharing agreements between exchanges and custodians, a more regulated and robust bitcoin futures market, and a better understanding of crypto custody and broker transfer.\n\n\"The totality of circumstances is what the SEC is looking at,\" Hougan said. \"I don't think there's any silver bullet.\"\n\nWhile classification of cryptocurrencies and the funds that track them have been a point of deliberation among investors and institutions alike, the SEC has firmly labeled the bitcoin as a commodity, something that Hougan agrees with.\n\n\"It's so decentralized, we don't know who created it,\" he explained of the flagship coin. \"There's no single person in charge of it, it's globally distributed. There are no insiders, all the information is public. And that's what makes it clearly a commodity.\"\n\nBut as you go from bitcoin to Ethereum and other assets, Hougan said, the degree of centralized control increases and the question will eventually get more complex, an obstacle he believes legislation will solve.\n\n\"You have the two largest regulators disagreeing on whether most crypto assets are securities or commodities,\" Hougan added, referring to past classification efforts between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\n\"The right solution there is for legislators to come through and make that clear so that U.S. innovators can win in the market.\"\n\nBesides Ark, eight other organizations including Hougan's firm, Bitwise, have filed applications for a spot bitcoin ETF. Grayscale has also filed to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot fund.\n\nShould the SEC move forward with the approval process, he said the best outcome for investors would be the approval of multiple products.\n\n\"I think there should be a fair playing field that allows us to have multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs that compete in the market,\" Hougan said. \"It will allow prices to be the lowest, it will allow competition to be the highest, [and] it will allow service to be the highest.\"\n\nDisclaimer"

        "title": "What will Bitcoin do if the Justice Department takes aim at Binance? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "In early August, sources leaked word that officials with the United State Department of Justice were considering fraud charges aimed at Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange. However, they indicated, officials are worried that it could cause a run on the market akin to the November 2022 collapse of FTX.\n\nThose concerns have not deterred the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission from levying their own charges against Binance, which in part accused the exchange and its founder, Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao, of allowing Americans to use products they are prohibited from accessing and of manipulating trading volume with a market-maker called Sigma Chain that Zhao \u201cowned and controlled.\u201d\n\nTo put the numbers in perspective, at the time of writing, Binance had facilitated $7 billion in trading volume over the preceding 24-hour period. Coinbase facilitated a relatively paltry $970 million, while KuCoin \u2014 another well-known exchange \u2014 fell short of $350 million.\n\nWith markets in flux and lingering questions over whether central banks will pull off a \u201csoft landing\u201d for the global economy in the months ahead, it\u2019s fair to wonder what the implications might be if law enforcement joins regulators in targeting Binance. For feedback, we asked a number of Cointelegraph staffers for their thoughts \u2014 and how they plan to handle their own investments if the Justice Department does file charges against Binance or its executives.\n\nCointelegraph: How do you think the market will respond if the DOJ issues charges related to Binance? Are you going to be buying or selling when that happens?\n\nJoe Hall, reporter:\n\nBitcoin will likely drop if the Justice Department issues charges related to Binance, and the broader crypto industry might faceplant. But the need for sound, decentralized, censorship-resistant money is global: Bitcoin buyers in Africa, Europe and Latin America will gobble up the dip. Personally, I\u2019m going to keep asking myself (and my Bitcoin node): Will there only ever be 21 million Bitcoin? If the answer is \u201cYes,\u201d then I will continue to earn, save and spend in Bitcoin. (Spoiler alert, the answer is \u201cYes.\u201d)\n\nCT: Where do you think the price of Bitcoin will stand on Dec. 31?\n\nJH: $38,000. Dr. Adam Back, Paolo Ardoino (chief technology officer of Bitfinex/Tether) and Giacomo Zucco (a Bitcoin consultant) have all told me they believe Bitcoin will be above $35,000 by the end of this year. They\u2019re pretty smart Bitcoin people. How high the price could go before the halving is anyone\u2019s guess, but it does feel (for the umpteenth time) that sentiment toward Bitcoin is slowly warming up.\n\nTom Blackstone, reporter:\n\nIn my experience, news like this has very little impact on the market long-term, for three reasons. First, charges don\u2019t mean much unless there is a conviction, and trials can take a very long time. Second, if one exchange goes down, another one will pop up to replace it. Third, crypto is too useful for consumers to give up, and interest in it is growing organically as more people learn about it. So, I think it will continue to be a good investment regardless of the news cycle.\n\nBTC Price on Dec. 31? On a chart, Bitcoin has support at $15,300 and resistance at $41,000, so I would expect its price to be in that range by the end of the year.\n\nRelated: Demand is driving the price of Bitcoin to $130K\n\nJonathan DeYoung, senior copy editor:\n\nMy investment thesis is to hold on for dear life and hope that the market continues to grow over the medium to long term. I rarely, if ever, even look at what I\u2019ve saved. I try to forget it exists, and crypto pretty much never enters my brain when I think about financial planning for the near term. This offers me a level of psychological insolation from market-moving events, such as might be the case if Binance were charged.\n\nBTC Price on Dec. 31? Now that I have no particular thoughts on.\n\nCassio Gusson, reporter for Cointelegraph Brasil:\n\nIt will be a big blow to the market. There will likely be an asset drain from Binance, and this will greatly damage the exchange\u2019s image globally. This will affect the price of Bitcoin and the entire system of assets on BNB Chain. There will likely be a new crash similar to what happened with Terra, with several investors withdrawing assets in protocol staking on BNB Chain, withdrawing assets from Binance and in exchange-related products such as PancakeSwap.\n\nIt will be a big blow to the market.

There will likely be a new crash similar to what happened with Terra, with several investors withdrawing assets in protocol staking on BNB Chain, withdrawing assets from Binance and in exchange-related products such as PancakeSwap.\n\nI\u2019ll be selling on the day it happens. I\u2019ll be buying in the next 48 hours after the event has already reached its bottom and buyers resume trading.\n\nBTC Price on Dec. 31? I don\u2019t think it will be more than $40,000. There are studies that show that the impact of Bitcoin\u2019s halving is decreasing. We could reach $40,000 if the Securities and Exchange Commission approves a Bitcoin spot ETF. Otherwise, a maximum of $35,000.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETFs: Even worse for crypto than central exchanges\n\nKristina Lucrezia Corn\u00e8r, editor-in-chief:\n\nIn the nascent landscape of the blockchain market, accusations leveled against major players like Binance send shockwaves through the whole industry and its closely-knit community. And these allegations not only target specific individuals but also challenge the overall credibility and reputation of our sector. What follows is a dynamic process akin to a seismic event, reshaping perceptions and redefining power dynamics within the ecosystem.\n\nBut these shockwaves aren\u2019t just disruptive; they foster growth and transformation, reinforcing the industry\u2019s values, unearthing its concealed resources, and nurturing sustainability and positive change. Amid challenges, the blockchain sector emerges stronger, fortified by its ability to embrace improvements and navigate vulnerabilities. And so does Bitcoin.\n\nBTC Price on Dec. 31? For me personally, the value of Bitcoin is felt not as absolute numbers but rather as a comparative value with the strength of other currencies we use, and I strongly believe that in this sense, its value will only continue to grow, even while maintaining its volatility. If, on Dec. 31, one Bitcoin can buy one Tesla Model 3 [$32,740 after a tax credit, as of Aug. 8], I will even forgive Elon Musk for giving up on the bird. Maybe. (This is not investment or moral advice!)\n\nFelix Ng, editor:\n\nI\u2019ve seen enough companies collapse to know that nothing and no one is \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d crypto firm or not. That being said, it still seems unlikely that such charges would completely shut down crypto\u2019s biggest exchange.\n\nHowever, charges for Binance would likely cause a dip in crypto prices and a shifting of funds to other exchanges or cold wallets. Another exchange could rocket up to the top position. It\u2019s happened throughout the history of crypto. If there is a sharp dip, I\u2019ll be buying.\n\nBTC Price on Dec. 31? Finger in the air? $32,000. The Christmas period has historically been a positive one for Bitcoin, so assuming BTC trades mostly sideways for the next six months, we should get a little spike near Christmas.\n\nMarcel Pechman, reporter:\n\nBinance (mostly) doesn\u2019t operate in the U.S., so the impact, if any, will be minimal. The BitMEX case, which was very similar, resulted in $100 million in fines and house arrest for the founders, and that\u2019s it. Sure, there might be additional steps for U.S. market makers currently operating on Binance international, and U.S. citizens will be forced to use a VPN at all times when using the exchange, which may reduce volumes by 20%\u201330% max. Other than that, if Bitcoin plunges solely due to Binance\u2019s case, it\u2019s a buying opportunity.\n\nIn my opinion, Tether remains the most significant risk for the ecosystem, as there\u2019s literally zero use for a stablecoin without fiat gateways (in theory).\n\nBTC Price on Dec. 31? No idea. Seriously. I always bet on prices staying the same for zero to six months. My guess is that an ETF approval could cause between 50% and 130% gains in two months, so if we start at $30,000, we could get to $69,000.\n\nRelated: BlackRock\u2019s misguided effort to create \u2018Crypto for Dummies\u2019\n\nRay Salmond, head of markets:\n\nIf significant enforcement action came from the DOJ, to the extent of a Red Notice being issued for CZ\u2019s arrest or Binance being shuttered \u2014 even temporarily \u2014 I think this would have a sharp, negative impact on the broader crypto market and Bitcoin\u2019s price. I\u2019ve been looking at the Bitcoin price chart literally every day for more than six years, and I\u2019ve been buying the entire time. I dollar cost average \u2014 and I no longer use derivatives heavily \u2014 so I\u2019m agnostic to price and beyond any emotional shock from Binance blowing up and the impact it could have on crypto.\n\nI pretty much view any sharp downside move in BTC and ETH as an accumulation opportunity. I also always use 1 BTC as a trading instrument, where I sell it at micro tops and rebuy at swing lows, so most of my Bitcoin has no cost beyond the cost of taxes on trading. For this reason, my risk tolerance might be different than other investors, and any sharp dip in BTC price is something I view as an opportunity. Somehow, this magic money always finds a way to go back up.\n\nBTC Price on Dec. 31? I don\u2019t have any. The current trading range is too tight. We\u2019re still within that range, and volatility is at a multiyear low.\n\nArijit Sarkar, editor:\n\nIf the Justice Department drops charges against Binance, there will be a momentary price drop because of panic sellers. But it won\u2019t have a long-term effect. When Mt. Gox collapsed, people thought it was the end of Bitcoin because the exchange was managing 80% of the in-circulation BTC. But we\u2019re here having the same discussion a decade later.\n\nI\u2019m not going to panic sell even if the price drops. I\u2019m going to silently accumulate more Bitcoin and wait for the bull market to reap the rewards of patience.\n\nBTC Price on Dec. 31? Bitcoin\u2019s historical performance indicates something around the $25,000 mark. I\u2019m expecting it to momentarily fall in the third and fourth quarters of 2023, mainly due to rising regulatory hurdles, the government\u2019s growing affinity toward central bank digital currencies and the ongoing concern of ecosystem collapses.\n\nHowever, this is all par for the course prior to the halving in April 2024. Bitcoin\u2019s price has shot up every time we\u2019ve had a halving event. I\u2019m utilizing the next three quarters to dollar cost average and accumulate as many Bitcoin/sats as possible.\n\nRudy Takala, opinion editor:\n\nAltcoins look appealing right now. Coins like Algorand are 5%\u201310% off their all-time lows. They could sink a little before the market picks up, but that\u2019s more likely to be a product of time capitulation than of panic sellers reacting to a Binance indictment or any other news event. I doubt most tokens will drop more than 30% from here, regardless of what happens.\n\nBTC Price on Dec. 31? $32,500. The only thing I\u2019m going to regret is that I didn\u2019t buy more.

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether dip but more bullish times ahead? - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin dipped on Thursday morning in Asia after briefly breaching the US$30,000 resistance level. Ether also dipped, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. Cardano\u2019s ADA token led the winners. Meanwhile, the Forkast 500 NFT index moved higher. However, trading volume dropped after a surge earlier in the week. U.S. stock futures logged losses Wednesday but were trading higher on Thursday morning in Asia. Investors now await key U.S. inflation data with an eye on how that will affect the Fed\u2019s decision making on interest rates.\n\nBitcoin dips but set for bullish trend\n\nBitcoin dropped 0.72% in the last 24 hours to US$29,592.49 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, but rose 1.59% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency reached a high of US$30,093.44 on Wednesday evening, but struggled to stay above the US$30,000 threshold.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin prices remain range bound, the token is set for a bullish trend, said Samer Hasn, market analyst at Australia-based global multi-asset broker XS.com.\n\n\u201cWe witnessed the number of open interest positions (in Bitcoin) rise to the highest level since October of 2022 with more than 10.4 billion positions on August 8,\u201d Hasn said.\n\nHe added that a high number of open interests, which includes long and short positions, generally precedes a rise in momentum and increased volatility.\n\n\u201cThe increase in the number of open positions reflects more positive sentiment among investors with more recognition,\u201d Hasn said, adding that the new offering of the PYUSD stablecoin from PayPal \u2014 one of the world\u2019s largest payment companies \u2014 will increase access to cryptocurrency networks.\n\nSimilarly, spot Bitcoin exchange traded fund applications from major investment firms like BlackRock and Wisdom Tree will, if approved by U.S. regulators, provide \u201cmore access by individual investors, institutional investors, and large companies that may not be able to invest in cryptocurrencies directly,\u201d Hasn said.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, Ether dipped 0.21% to US$1,856.01 but held a weekly gain of 0.94%. Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed, with Cardano\u2019s ADA leading the winners, while Binance\u2019s BNB, Tron\u2019s TRX and Litecoin logged losses.\n\nCardano\u2019s ADA rose 1.03% to US$0.3016 for a weekly gain of 0.75% after the Cardano mainnet launched the Bitcoin token cBTC on Wednesday. The launch will allow Bitcoin holders to tokenize their Bitcoin on the Cardano network as cBTC and use it in Cardano\u2019s decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nBitcoin, meet Cardano.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re excited to announce mainnet is now LIVE \ud83d\udc7c\n\n\n\nMainnet below \u26c5\ufe0f\ud83d\udc47https://t.co/j6vHNUKIlL pic.twitter.com/Li81Pr8fpn \u2014 anetaBTC \ud83d\udc7c Mainnet Live (@anetaBTC) August 8, 2023\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dipped 0.31% in the past 24 hours to US$1.18 trillion, while trading volume remained flat, inching down 1.11% to US$35.54 billion.\n\nThe future is now for gaming NFTs\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.71% in the past 24 hours to 2,493.11 as of 09:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, and notched a 0.10% gain for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum and Solana NFT indexes also logged gains, while the indexes for Polygon and Cardano dropped.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume dropped 16.72% in the past 24 hours to over US$16.31 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volumes on the Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, Polygon, and Cardano blockchains all also logged losses.\n\nAmong NFT collections, Polygon-based DraftKings saw the largest 24-hour sales volume, but fell 65.56% to US$1.43 million. Still, those sales accounted for over 50% of the total NFT trading volume on the Polygon network. The collection is based on sports and betting company DraftKings\u2019 NFT games.\n\n\u201cDraftKings did huge numbers, at one point reflecting over US$4.6 million on CryptoSlam\u2019s collection rankings,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist for Forkast Labs.\n\n\u201cThese are being driven by fantasy football packs in the Reignmakers series. Packs range from US$20 to US$9,999, and some with supplies of over 50k packs. You can see how with brands like DraftKings and the National Football League (NFL), and prices like that, how they can rack up millions of dollars in sales in a day.\u201d\n\nAccording to Petscher, winter in the market can be a blessing for NFTs used in play-to-earn games.\n\n\u201cThis bear market is sorta like the Great Reset for NFTs,\u201d said Petscher in a Wednesday tweet. \u201cWithout it traders would still be conditioned for unrealistic gains. Now they\u2019ll be happy for a few dollars here, maybe 20 bucks there, and then some home runs every so often. Expect to see more numbers like DraftKings, DMarket Gods Unchained and Sorare.\u201d\n\nIn CryptoSlams\u2019 NFT collection ranking, DraftKings, Mythos Chain-based DMarket, Ethereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), ImmutableX-based Gods Unchained and Ethereum-based Sorare took up the top 5 spots by seven-day sales volume.\n\n\u201cMythos Chain, Polygon, ImmutableX, and Ethereum are all represented in CryptoSlam\u2019s Top Five Collections so far this week, and show the multi-chain future that\u2019s not just ahead of us. It\u2019s here,\u201d tweeted Petscher on Thursday.\n\nElsewhere, Canadian musician and producer Claire Elise Boucher, known professionally as Grimes, said in an interview with U.S. magazine Wired that she has earned more money from NFTs than from her music career. Boucher sold around US$6 million worth of NFTs in an auction in early 2021.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sad about what happened to NFTs and crypto, because it got polluted fast with people trying to make as much money as possible,\u201d said Boucher in the interview.\n\n\u201cBut I do want to think about compensating artists, especially digital artists. And I hope when the aggro niche dies down, we can come back,\u201d she said.\n\n(Updates with NFT section.)\n\nU.S. equity futures up ahead of key inflation data\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures traded higher as of 11:10 a.m. in Hong Kong, after the stock market closed lower on Wednesday.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes were mixed on Wednesday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng and South Korea\u2019s Kospi logged losses, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei moved up.\n\nInvestors are now waiting for the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) in July, which is set for release on Thursday. Analysts expect the annual inflation rate to hit 3.3% in July, up from 3.0% in June, with the monthly rate remaining unchanged at 0.2%.\n\nHowever, an acceleration in the annual inflation rate would not necessarily equate to a reverse of the recent inflation slowdown.\n\nTalking to The Wall Street Journal, Laura Rosner, founding partner at advisory firm MacroPolicy Perspectives, pointed to this time last year when inflation peaked in June and then slowed down in the following month.\n\nA monthly inflation rate of 0.2% in June would be consistent with the moderate inflation that the Federal Reserve wants to see, Rosner said.\n\nMeanwhile, Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker said on Tuesday the Fed might be ready to pause interest rate hikes.\n\n\u201cAbsent any alarming new data between now and mid-September, I believe we may be at the point where we can be patient and hold rates steady and let the monetary policy actions we have taken do their work,\u201d said Harker.\n\nThe Fed meets on Sep. 19 to make its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest level in the past 22 years. Analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predict a 87.0% chance there will be no interest rate hike in September, up from 86.5% on Wednesday.\n\nElsewhere, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order Wednesday to regulate U.S. investment in Chinese entities engaged in three sectors: semiconductors and microelectronics, quantum information technologies, and artificial intelligence.\n\nHowever, the sectors listed in the order were narrower than expected, which some analysts interpret as a sign that Biden\u2019s administration is seeking to improve relations with China.\n\n\u201cFor the business community, this is relatively good news,\u201d Sarah Bauerle Danzman, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and associate professor of international studies at Indiana University, told Bloomberg. \u201cIt\u2019s a relatively narrow notification process and a very narrow set of prohibitions.\u201d\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"

But eventually [that] 5% will be coming down at some point.\n\nI don\u2019t think Bitcoin and other better-known cryptocurrencies are going to go away. There\u2019s enormous interest around the world in being able to have something you can transfer without the government knowing about it and keeping it private. You can say that people shouldn\u2019t do that, but that\u2019s not going to stop people from doing it.\u201d\n\nAccording to Rubenstein, even though there is a divide in opinion on crypto among US officials, the rest of the world is becoming more and more open minded. He says people have a strong desire for an alternative currency outside the purview of governments.\n\n\u201cI think Democrats in Congress and particularly the people regulating, the SEC, are skeptical of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But outside the United States, there\u2019s a lot of interest in it. I think FTX really hurt when it went bankrupt\u2026\n\nBut a lot of people around the world want to be able to trade in a currency that their government can\u2019t know what they have and they want to be moving [it] around, rightly or wrongly. And so I don\u2019t think Bitcoin is going away. I think the Republicans on Capitol Hill have been pretty supportive of it.\u201d\n\nThe SEC currently has pending lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance, two of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, on allegations that the platforms have been selling unregistered securities.\n\nBitcoin is trading for $29,735 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) can easily end up below $25,000 next month, says one longtime market observer.\n\nIn a new BTC price outlook, Timothy Peterson, founder and investment manager at Cane Island Alternative Advisors, put the odds of a dip to local lows at 50/50.\n\nBTC price may see \u201clast big dip\u201d in September\n\nWhile Bitcoin bulls continue their breakout attempts above $30,000, various popular traders and analysts have their sights on lower levels.\n\nPeterson, well known for his technical insights, now believes that the typical August and September performance may yield a return to the $25,000 mark.\n\nUploading a chart of monthly performance statistics for BTC/USD to X (formerly known as Twitter), he concluded that a \u201clast big dip\u201d may hit before September is over.

        "title": "Bitcoin Lightning Network is growing, but 3 major challenges remain - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Lightning Network is a layer-2 solution built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, and its primary objective is to address the Bitcoin network\u2019s scalability issues. It also allows for faster and cheaper transactions by facilitating off-chain payments through a network of payment channels.\n\nThe Lightning Network has gained traction since its launch in 2018, hitting a total value locked of $140 million, but this is relatively small compared to Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) $580 billion market capitalization. However, this oversimplification disregards that this scaling solution focuses on instant transactions, not lending, yield farms or other activities that require staking.\n\nAdditionally, the number of nodes has grown by a mere 6% since June 2022. This suggests that there are significant reasons why it has not achieved mainstream adoption. Let\u2019s take a look at a few of the factors influencing Lightning Network growth.\n\nChannel balancing, finding liquidity and the associated costs impact network growth\n\nIf Lightning Network users wish to make a payment that exceeds their channel balance, they must find a well-funded node with a direct channel to the recipient to facilitate the transaction. This process can be challenging and time-consuming, especially if the recipient is not well connected within the Lightning Network.\n\nChannel balancing requires users to manage the funds in their channels effectively. Rebalancing is automatic when using apps like the Phoenix or Breeze, but it adds complexity for mid-level users relying on their own nodes. According to Viktor Bunin, protocol specialist at Coinbase Cloud:\n\n\u201cThis capital inefficiency at the edges for non-custodial users is a hard and annoying optimization problem, and it\u2019s objectively worse than an account-based model with arbitrary transaction sizing. However, it\u2019s not an unworkable problem.\u201d\n\nBesides the issue of optimizing the channels\u2019 funding, there are also the associated costs of opening and closing channels, as it requires an on-chain transaction. That can create serious issues if the median fee surpasses $5 or $10, which would drastically limit the use for the lower-income population and disincentive the network capillarity.\n\nThe risk of development hiccups could be pushing potential users away\n\nThe Lightning Network is still under development, meaning it still faces certain security risks. One concern is that if a node goes offline, it becomes unable to process payments through the channels it is connected to. This disrupts the payment process until the node comes back online, potentially causing an inconvenience for users.\n\nBunin highlights that there are no offline methods for Lightning payments, but noncustodial wallets offer \u201cclever workarounds\u201d using background tasks in mobile devices. Still, this solution might present constraints if the device\u2019s operating system limits the performance to preserve battery power.\n\nDouble-spending is a risk on any blockchain-based system, including the Lightning Network. This attack could emerge from a node being offline for too long, subsequently providing an incorrect state and returning coins to the other party. This risk emerges only if the user is not active to inform the \u201cjustice transaction\u201d or hasn\u2019t set up \u201cwatchtowers\u201d to prove that a fraud is being committed when a channel closing is requested.\n\nDragging merchant adoption and user awareness\n\nThe widespread adoption of any payment system requires acceptance by a large number of merchants and high user awareness. However, the Lightning Network faces challenges in both areas.\n\nMerchant adoption is limited due to complexities in integrating the Lightning Network into existing payment systems, concerns about Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility and regulatory uncertainties. On the other hand, efforts are being made to increase merchant adoption through user-friendly point-of-sale systems and partnerships with payment processors.\n\nFor instance, Zeus and OpenNode are popular wallets that offer a user-friendly point-of-sale app for merchants. The app allows merchants to accept Lightning Network payments with a QR code or NFC scan.\n\nAdditionally, user awareness about the Lightning Network\u2019s benefits and usage is still relatively low. Educating users about the advantages and ease of Lightning payments is essential to overcoming this limitation.\n\nWhat is the future of the Bitcoin Lightning Network?\n\nBesides the more obvious problems cited, including channel rebalancing and security risks, developers are working on payments that can be made when the receiver is offline, known as asynchronous (async).\n\nAn important milestone for this Bitcoin scaling solution has been its integration by the Binance exchange in July. The reduced fees for withdrawal are a major selling point in comparison to wrapped Bitcoin options available on competing blockchains. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong confirmed in August that the exchange is also looking forward to implementing Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning network.\n\nThis layer-2 scaling solution holds immense potential to enhance Bitcoin\u2019s transaction efficiency and scalability. As the technology matures and efforts are made to address these issues, the scaling solution may eventually gain broader acceptance and increased adoption.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin whales are major market players who can influence the price of bitcoin when they decide to buy or sell large volumes of the digital currency.\n\nBitcoin whales can significantly impact the price of bitcoin when they decide to buy or sell BTC in large quantities, making them some of the most important Bitcoin market participants.\n\nRead on to learn more about bitcoin whales, how they influence the market, and how you can spot them.\n\nWhat Are Bitcoin Whales?\n\nBitcoin whales are individuals or entities holding large amounts of the digital currency and have the potential to impact price movements with a single trade.\n\nThe widely accepted minimum threshold for a bitcoin whale is 1,000 BTC.\n\nThe term \u201cbitcoin whale\u201d is a colloquial phrase to put the size of the holding in perspective when compared to other \u201csmaller fish\u201d in the market. The wallet owner can be an individual or a group pooling resources to make significant investments.\n\nHow Do Whales Influence the Market?\n\nWhales\u2019 position as the biggest players in the Bitcoin market makes them highly influential. Their significant holdings allow them to significantly affect bitcoin\u2019s immediate demand or supply on exchanges (or via OTC trading desks) whenever they trade. As a result, the market often responds with price movements.\n\nThe price of bitcoin often rallies when a while decides to add to their bitcoin position due to the size of their trades. Conversely, if a Bitcoin whale opts to exit their position by selling a portion of their holdings, the price tends to respond with a decline.\n\nMoreover, a lot of whales\u2019 wallets are publicly tracked, which results in the wider Bitcoin trading community responding to whale\u2019s trading decisions (or expected trades), often resulting in a large price movement as many traders mirror the whale\u2019s (expected) trade.\n\nConsequently, some whales prefer trading with others directly via OTC trading desks to limit their impact on the price. However, some whales trading on exchanges may take the opportunity to move the market in the direction they want by signaling to the market that they are a large buyer or seller.\n\nThree Ways to Spot a Bitcoin Whale\n\nKnowing how to spot a Bitcoin whale can be a helpful addition to your Bitcoin trading arsenal, given its potential to impact the market with a simple buy or sell order.\n\nLet\u2019s look at three ways you can spot a Bitcoin whale.\n\nUse Blockchain Explorers : Bitcoin\u2019s public ledger allows you access to all transactions. Using a blockchain explorer such as blockchain.com, you can identify large amounts of bitcoin being moved . Analyze Trade Patterns : Whales tend to execute large trades, leading to sudden price dips or spikes. If you pay attention to trading patterns, the emergence of unusual patterns might signify a Bitcoin whale making a move. Social Media : Some bitcoin whales are active on social media, sharing their opinions on investment strategies and the bitcoin market. You can gain some insights into their potential trading activities and use information.\n\nBiggest Bitcoin Whales in the Market\n\nAccording to this bitcoin whales chart, as of July 2023, there are 2,018 BTC wallets with balances of over 1,000 BTC. Some notable whales have held onto their bitcoin for the long term.\n\nLet\u2019s look at five of the most notable, publicly known bitcoin whales.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto : The identity of Bitcoin\u2019s creator remains unknown, with no clear evidence of whether it is an individual or a group of people. Whoever they may be, they mined approximately 1 million BTC, and the wallet has remained inactive for years. Changpeng Zhao : With an estimated net worth of over $10 billion, the Binance co-founder is one of the top crypto billionaires. While the size of his BTC holdings is unknown, he\u2019s indicated in the past that crypto forms 95% of his portfolio. The Winklevoss Twins : Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss started adding bitcoin to their portfolio in 2012. At some point, they owned approximately 1% of bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply. Michael Saylor/MicroStrategy : Through MicroStrategy, his business analytics software company, Michael Saylor holds approximately 150,000 BTC. He\u2019s one of the most vocal Bitcoin advocates, especially on his Twitter account, where he shares the benefits of Bitcoin. Tim Draper : The American venture capitalist famously bought 29,656 bitcoin from the U.S. Marshalls when Silk Road assets were auctioned. He is a prominent opponent of government overreach and advocates for decentralization. The size of his current BTC holdings is unknown, but he continues to be a vocal advocate.\n\nSpotting a bitcoin whale\u2019s activities can help you make shrewd moves in the market. However, remember that even whales can make emotional decisions without rationality. Some may even seek to manipulate the market to benefit themselves. Ensure you go beyond tracking their activities and find their reasons before making decisions."

The U.S. bond yield curve is inverted\u2014an economic event that has preceded every recession in U.S. history\u2014and the New York Times says that it\u2019s about to get even worse. Interest rates are currently at generational highs, creating devastating credit conditions for many American families. According to JPMorgan analysts, we are likely headed for a recession by the end of 2023 or early 2024.\n\nWhile inflation has finally started to cool down, there\u2019s no denying that Americans are finding life more and more unaffordable. It\u2019s no wonder why more American families than ever are reporting that their salaries aren\u2019t keeping pace with the cost of living\u2014inflation, unlimited government spending, and economic mismanagement are all to blame.\n\n(IronMonk Solutions via AmericanCompass, sponsored) Major Costs for a Middle-Class Family of Four vs. Median Male Income.\n\nEnergy and commodity prices have soared to record highs within the last year, and it costs more to heat and power one\u2019s home today than it has in decades. Simply put, many of us can\u2019t afford to make ends meet, and no amount of governmental intervention appears to be working.\n\nIf a recession were to hit, who knows what kind of price we would have to pay?\n\nThe economic indicators of a recession are looming, and they aren\u2019t getting any better. Gasoline prices are about 61.5% higher than they were only a few years ago. In July, the national average price at the pump surged by over 4 cents in a single day\u2014a rare economic event that usually suggests that something has gone wrong in the international supply chain.\n\nWhen fuel prices rise, the rest of the economy feels the effects. That\u2019s because transporting goods to market requires fuel for vehicles. Every recession might not be led by a sharp rise in fuel prices, but a rise in oil prices of 50% or more has nearly always been followed by a recession.\n\n(IronMonk Solutions via Bianco Research Twitter, sponsored) Surge in Energy Prices Suggest High Probability of Recession.\n\nGiven the multitude of negative economic signs in the economy, it\u2019s a small wonder why the Bankrate Economic Indicator survey puts the odds of a recession by July 2024 at 59 percent.\n\nIf you\u2019re nervous about your IRA and wondering how you can protect your life\u2019s savings, you\u2019re not alone. The good news is that many investors choose to protect against economic risks by diversifying their portfolios with recession-resistant investment assets. Namely, physical assets like gold and silver have a long history of outperforming stocks, bonds, and other conventional assets during most recessions and market downturns.\n\nTo manage risk, retirement investors often choose to add precious metals such as gold to their IRAs by working with IRS-approved custodians, brokers, and storage experts.\n\nBut are you aware that you can now do this with Bitcoin too?\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin IRA?\n\nGold IRAs and Silver IRAs are retirement accounts that hold some of their value in precious metals. Bitcoin IRAs work the same way, by holding Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as an investment asset.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin IRAs have only recently become an option for investors, more and more people are electing to create one in order to diversify their portfolios and limit their exposure to systemic market risks. They also can provide impressive upside potential for those looking to make a handsome profit\u2014for instance, Bitcoin appreciated an incredible 103.95% between July 16, 2021, and November 12 of the same year.\n\n(IronMonk Solutions via Statista, sponsored) The price of Bitcoin in USD from 2013-2023\n\nThroughout its history, Bitcoin prices have volleyed up and down. The Bitcoin market has enjoyed large bull runs where many investors cashed out with new fortunes, and downturns where investors were stuck waiting for the next bull run.\n\nThe key is that Bitcoin prices generally do not reflect stock market prices or have any strong relationship to economic indicators. In a way, Bitcoin operates in a world of its own. For that reason, it is often sought after as a way to spread risk around within a diversified portfolio.\n\nAccording to market research, the cryptocurrency market is growing at a rapid pace. From 2023 until 2030, the market is expected to grow at an annualized rate of about 12%. As the general appetite for Bitcoin has risen, interest in Bitcoin IRAs has grown too. Americans have flocked to these accounts as a way to chase Bitcoin\u2019s gains over the long term and to, hopefully, more rapidly grow a retirement nest egg while reducing their tax burden.\n\nBut not so fast! Before you get started with a Bitcoin IRA, there are a few things that you should know first.\n\n1. Make Sure to Use the Right Kind of IRA\n\nRemember: Bitcoin IRAs are still in their infancy, unlike Gold IRAs. Assets like gold and silver have stored value for thousands of years and could be added to IRA accounts for 25 years now, ever since the adoption of the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act. So, of course, getting your IRA ducks in a row is the first step.\n\nTraditional brokerage accounts typically do not support crypto investing. If they do, naturally, the opportunities for live trading are nil. Consider using a trusted Bitcoin IRA administrator, such as My Digital Money, to open up a Bitcoin IRA. My Digital Money was one of the first companies in the IRA market to receive a crypto trading license and one of the first to offer all major crypto assets as part of a retirement account.\n\nAn all-in-one provider such as My Digital Money can facilitate the process of creating and managing a Bitcoin IRA from start to finish. My Digital Money is also fully transparent about its fee structure, has industry-leading user privacy policies, and uses military-grade security protocols to protect its customers\u2019 assets.\n\nYou have a choice of two types of self-directed retirement accounts you can use when establishing a Bitcoin IRA:\n\nRoth Bitcoin IRA\n\nAfter-tax retirement savings account that works just like any other Roth IRA\n\nNo upfront tax deduction with contributions\n\nZero requirements to pay taxes on gains later on when you retire and begin to take distributions\n\nTraditional Bitcoin IRA\n\nTax-deferred retirement savings account\n\nContributions reduce tax liability for the year they are made (In most cases, contributions are tax-deductible)\n\nFor 2023, annual contribution limits are $6,500 if under age 50 and $7,500 if age 50 or above (add an additional $500 to each for 2024)\n\nMust pay taxes on gains when you take distributions during retirement\n\nBoth types of IRA accounts offer tax benefits. Financial advisors sometimes note that if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket at retirement than you are now, a Roth IRA may work well, since you will pay a lower marginal tax rate on your contributions today. Conversely, individuals who expect to have a lower tax liability during retirement may opt for a traditional Bitcoin IRA instead.\n\nIf you have a Bitcoin wallet for your IRA, though, you can only fund it with your IRA. It is not legal to commingle your Bitcoin wallet with other IRA funds. If you try to skirt around this, you could wind up in some serious trouble with the IRS.\n\n2. Diversification\n\nCryptocurrency is, more than anything, a diversification tool. Unlike other diversifiers, such as precious metals, Bitcoin is a highly asymmetrical investment. In other words, the upside potential (i.e., price ceiling) is much higher than the downside risk (price floor).\n\nBitcoin appears to be mimicking precious metals as a safe haven asset amid all of the geopolitical chaos in Europe. For example, during the first week of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine (Feb. 24-Mar. 1, 2022), the price of Bitcoin skyrocketed by roughly 33%.\n\n(IronMonk Solutions via Stockcharts, sponsored) Price of Bitcoin.\n\nFor better or worse, as Russia becomes more isolated economically, the ruble declines, and the rest of the world feels spillover effects from rising oil prices and inflation, crypto has a growing role in the investment market. Its decentralized qualities and seamless and borderless P2P payments have never been more crucial than now.\n\nBitcoin represents a sea change in financial systems. The existing, traditional financial infrastructure is composed of financial services firms that are tightly regulated by governments. The new financial infrastructure being created with cryptocurrencies is being built upon open-source, decentralized software that is not controlled by any organization.\n\nDigital currencies represent a $2 trillion+ market value, currently have over 200 million users, and offer a new global financial system with improved transaction efficiency. Adding exposure to this type of asset in a retirement account could be an outstanding long-term play. Perhaps that\u2019s why over 80% of central banks worldwide are exploring Central Bank Digital Currencies and why the U.S. Federal Reserve is investigating a fully digital U.S. Dollar.\n\nIn 2023 so far, Bitcoin has outperformed both gold and the stock market. This is something that it has accomplished in both 2020 and 2021 as well.\n\n3. Limited Supply = Inflation Hedge\n\nFor years, according to Reuters, gold has protected investors from excessive inflation and currency debasement.\n\nAs inflation surges, the value of the dollars you earn today may not retain its purchasing power tomorrow. Throughout history, gold has consistently managed to keep up with inflation, mainly due to its status as a limited and rare resource. During periods of political or economic uncertainty, the demand for gold tends to soar as investors seek a safe haven.\n\nPresently, we find ourselves facing a dual challenge with inflation reaching a 40-year peak and witnessing the most significant invasion of a European sovereign nation since World War II. Interestingly, Bitcoin might be even more suitable for this specific context than gold ever was. Just like gold, Bitcoin is a finite resource\u2014its blockchain protocol is designed to cap the total number of coins at 21 million. This immutable supply cannot be manipulated, and unlike fiat currencies, Bitcoins cannot be arbitrarily generated by governments or central banks.\n\nNumerous respected analysts speculate that Bitcoin could potentially supplant gold\u2019s role as a reliable store of value and a long-term hedge against inflation. Ponder this: Bitcoin currently commands around 20% of the \u201cstore-of-value\u201d market. If its market share were to expand to 50% within the coming years, even without an overall increase in demand for stores of value, its price could effortlessly ascend beyond $100,000. As a result, institutional investors are increasingly turning towards Bitcoin as a safeguard against inflation.\n\n4. Resistance to Confiscation\n\nLove it or hate it, Bitcoin is decentralized and, at present, largely secure from government intervention. It is anonymous, cryptographically protected, and resistant to confiscation, theft, and seizure. Its decentralized nature provides both security from theft or fraud, as well as financial privacy.\n\nThose are some of the reasons crypto demand has skyrocketed during the Russia-Ukraine crisis.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials are now frozen out of the traditional global financial system. Assets being seized, such as offshore bank accounts, have turned the Russian economy upside down. Ordinary Russians feel the pain, too, with the ruble worth less than half a dollar and the Russian central bank setting its overnight interest rate to a sky-high 8.5%.\n\nFrom the Ukrainian side, crypto has also served a vital need. People worldwide are donating crypto to Ukraine as a form of remittance. The anonymity of crypto donations reduces the risk of Russia seizing donations.\n\n5. Know the Risks\n\nThe undeniable long-term potential of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency stands out. However, before delving into establishing an IRA, it\u2019s crucial to consider several risks.\n\nSimilar to any investment asset, Bitcoin carries its own set of risks. Its relative novelty and susceptibility to significant price swings make it vulnerable. These risks can also be magnified due to the asset\u2019s emerging nature. Being a relatively immature asset, Bitcoin is prone to volatility, erratic price movements, cyber theft, fraudulent exchanges, and an uncertain regulatory landscape.\n\nThe concept of opportunity cost applies to Bitcoin as well, much like any other potential investment. Opportunity cost means that when you allocate funds to an IRA, you forego the chance to use that limited contribution space (typically $6,000 to $7,000 annually) for other assets. Additionally, recurring custody and maintenance fees, as well as potential costs associated with crypto trades, should be considered.\n\nThe risk of \u201cforking\u201d pertains to occasions when the Bitcoin blockchain undergoes periodic modifications and updates based on a consensus among its network users. Forking events can lead to price fluctuations that may erode investor confidence.\n\nYou can take steps to mitigate investment risks. It\u2019s essential never to invest more than you can afford to lose, and it\u2019s prudent to establish a Bitcoin IRA through a reputable provider. This ensures a more secure investment journey.\n\nTop 5 Companies for Adding Crypto to Your IRA\n\nAmid the global surge of cryptocurrency, experienced investors are increasingly considering the long-term prospects of their crypto portfolios. Surprisingly, even newer investors are gravitating towards extended timeframes, regardless of their level of experience.\n\nWhile the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency taxation remains complex and subject to change, there\u2019s a fundamental aspect that remains constant. IRA accounts offer an excellent avenue for saving towards retirement or stashing funds for the long haul, coupled with the advantage of tax deductions.\n\nJust as you would with a traditional IRA through a conventional brokerage platform, there are now companies facilitating cryptocurrency investment within an IRA structure.

The key is to look at the long-term potential and make sure that you do your due diligence.

One decision you will have to make is whether to go with an all-in-one firm, such as My Digital Money, that handles purchasing crypto, Bitcoin IRA management, and storage, all in-house, or with a provider that merely connects you with appropriate third parties to handle custodial management and IRS-approved storage.\n\nTo find out more about how a Bitcoin IRA can work for you, consider requesting a FREE info kit from My Digital Money or give them a call at 1-833-636-2008 for more information.\n\nREQUEST FREE KIT"

        "content": "Colorado-based Bitcoin mining firm Riot Platforms narrowed its second quarter net loss to $27.7 million as it ramped up its Bitcoin production and reached record hash rate capacity.\n\nThe crypto miner posted total revenue of $76.7 million \u2014 up 5.2% from Q2 2022 \u2014 which was primarily driven by a 27% year-on-year increase in Bitcoin (BTC) production, offset by a decline in Bitcoin prices, according to the firm\u2019s Aug. 9 results filing.\n\nThe firm\u2019s mining revenue of $49.7 million made up 64.7% of the firm\u2019s total revenue over the quarter. An additional $13.5 million was made through the firm\u2019s power curtailment credits.\n\nMeanwhile, its Q2 net loss was a massive reduction from the prior year period, which was $353.5 million. It was also around half the net loss posted in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nRiot Platforms managed to cut its net loss to $27.7 million in Q2. Source: Riot Platforms\n\nThe firm produced 1,775 Bitcoin in the quarter, while its average cost to mine a Bitcoin (BTC) was $8,389 in Q2, beating beat Q1\u2019s average price.\n\nThe mining firm also reached an all-time high hash rate capacity of 10.7 exahashes per second and anticipates this figure will reach 20.1 EH/s by the second quarter of 2024, before reaching 35.4 EH/s in 2025.\n\nThe estimates come following its purchase of 33,280 mining rigs in late June, with the 35.4 EH/s figure assuming that Riot will exercise its right to purchase an additional 66,560 miners at the same price and terms at some time in the near future.\n\nRiot predicts the facility's hash rate capacity to increase from 10.7 EH/s at current levels to 35.4 EH/s in 2025.

        "title": "Newly discovered Bitcoin wallet loophole let hackers steal $900K \u2014 SlowMist - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "A newly discovered vulnerability in the Libbitcoin Explorer 3.x library has allowed over $900,000 to be stolen from Bitcoin users, according to a report from blockchain security firm SlowMist. The vulnerability can also affect users of Ethereum, Ripple, Dogecoin, Solana, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash and Zcash who use Libbitcoin to generate accounts.\n\nSlowMist Security Alert\n\n\n\nRecently, #Distrust discovered a severe vulnerability affecting cryptocurrency wallets using the #Libbitcoin Explorer 3.x versions. This vulnerability allows attackers to access wallet private keys by exploiting the Mersenne Twister pseudo-random\u2026 \u2014 SlowMist (@SlowMist_Team) August 10, 2023\n\nLibbitcoin is a Bitcoin wallet implementation that developers and validators sometimes use to create Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrency accounts. According to its official website, it is used by \u201cAirbitz (mobile wallet), Bitprim (developer interface), Blockchain Commons (decentralized wallet identity), Cancoin (decentralized exchange)\u201d and other applications. SlowMist did not specify which applications that use Libbitcoin, if any, are affected by the vulnerability.\n\nSlowMist identified cybersecurity team \u201cDistrust\" as the team that originally discovered the loophole, which is called the \u201cMilk Sad\u201d vulnerability. It was reported to the CEV cybersecurity vulnerability database on Aug. 7.\n\nAccording to the post, the Libbitcoin Explorer has a faulty key generation mechanism, allowing private keys to be guessed by attackers. As a result, attackers exploited this vulnerability to steal over $900,000 worth of crypto as of Aug. 10.\n\nSlowMist emphasized that one attack in particular siphoned away over 9.7441 BTC (approximately $278,318). The firm claims to have \u201cblocked\u201d the address, implying that the team has contacted exchanges to prevent the attacker from cashing out the funds. The team also stated that it will be monitoring the address in case funds are moved elsewhere.\n\nFour members of the Distrust team, along with eight freelance security consultants who claim to have helped discover the vulnerability, have set up an informational website explaining the vulnerability. They explained that the loophole is created when users employ the \u201cbx seed\u201d command to generate a wallet seed. This command \u201cuses the Mersenne Twister pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) initialized with 32 bits of system time,\u201d which lacks sufficient randomness and therefore sometimes produces the same seed for multiple persons.\n\nBx seed command producing the same seed twice. Source: Milk Sad information site\n\nThe researchers claim to have discovered the vulnerability when they were contacted by a Libbitcoin user whose BTC had mysteriously gone missing on July 21. When the user reached out to other Libbitcoin users to try to determine how the BTC could have gone missing, the person found that other users were also having their BTC siphoned away.\n\nCointelegraph reached out to Libbitcoin Institute member Eric Voskuil for comment. In response, Voskuil stated that the bx seed command \"is provided as a convenience for when the tool is used to demonstrate behavior that requires entropy\" and is not intended to be used in production wallets. \"If people did in fact use it for production key seeding (as opposed to rolling dice for example) then the warning is insufficient,\" Voskuil stated. In that case, \"We'll likely make some change within the next few days to strengthen the warning against production use, or remove the command altogether.\"\n\nWallet vulnerabilities continue to pose a problem for crypto users in 2023. Over $100 million was lost in a hack of the Atomic Wallet in June, which was acknowledged by the app\u2019s team on June 22. Cybersecurity certification platform CER released its wallet security rankings in July, noting that only six out of 45 wallet brands employ penetration testing to discover vulnerabilities.\n\nUpdate (Aug. 10 20:51 UTC): This article has been updated to include a comment from Eric Voskuil."

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Hovers Around $29.5K After July CPI Data - CoinDesk",
        "content": "New us. Inflation data is out. The consumer price index rose 0.2% in July on a seasonally adjusted basis. Joining us now to discuss how the crypto markets are reacting is path trading partners, co-founder and Chief Market strategist Bob Aino. Welcome back to the show, Bob. Good morning. Good to see you, Jesse just made me smile. He's like in such a good mood all the time. I love that. I know he just brings the energy first thing in the morning and Bob every time I get to say your last name, I smile, it just rolls off the tongue. A Chino cappuccino. So as long as you like, I love cappuccinos. All right, this is not a show about coffee. Let's talk about the markets. Uh Bitcoin is not moving, Bob, it's not moving. We're hovering around 29,500. Uh What's your reaction to what's going on in the markets right now? Well, I mean, I'm pretty positive and unfortunately, uh you know, one of the things I think that sparked this recent rally in Bitcoin was Larry think of black rock kind of blessing Bitcoin as something that's actually going to be here long enough to create an ETF. Um I, I think it's interesting that after that we just kind of solve these levels because I've, I've been both positive and negative short to medium term and honestly, I couldn't be more positive the asset right now just looking at what's happening, looking at what's happening in the broader economy. I've said this on your show before, Jen, that I think the two things for me are gold and Bitcoin right now. Gold. Simply because, you know, as an old finance guy myself, it's definitely easier to convert to fiat when I need to. Uh Bitcoin has little longer term play for me. It's, it was a long time before I decided that Bitcoin wasn't my space and once I made that decision, um it's stuck with me and it's just kind of the, the longer term investment, I don't see any way around it. The more people from the old economy that we have on our podcast that we record every week, the more I believe Bitcoin is here to stay. So, um, you know, it's funny because, you know, you're bullish and a lot of people are bullish, but it, there is kind of a wintry gust still, you know, it doesn't, it doesn't totally feel like crypto is, is, is back completely right. And, and I guess my question would be like, what, aside from, you know, one of these ETF S being approved would sort of be the, the thing that sort of pushes the needle in your opinion. Well, I think when Jesse was talking about, you know, getting more people to just give it a try that, that resonated with me. It's actually something I talked about in another interview, uh, about 10 days ago where you still have people that just say, I don't understand it and the effort to understand it just isn't there and getting people to either a realize that at least to get involved, you don't need to understand Blockchain and, and NFTS in the entire world of, of D I, you just have to understand that it's decentralized and that essentially it's the answer to the questions that most of us in the old finance world are asking, you know, again, as long as it's not regulated out of existence, which that's the part of the Black Rock thing. I mean, I, I'm not a fan of Black Rock as a company at all, but the fact that they want to make an ETF, you can look at them as sort of the evil empire and say they'll make money off of anything they can. But they're also not going to invest in something that isn't going to be here for the long term for them to make money, which is what they're actually doing right now. So the second part of that, uh, Emily is that you, you have to actually bring people across and get this world, the world that you guys exist on a daily basis to simplify some of these things. You know, listening to Jesse talk, I realized that there's about 80% of the terms that I don't even know what they are. And I'm an older owner and a holder of Bitcoin myself. So it's a more complex world than people like me know, but it's also a simpler world than the people that I can't seem to drag in. Keep kicking and screaming to learn the basics of it is all right, Bob. And lastly, we mentioned that CP I index in our intro here. What's your reaction to the latest us inflation data? And how might that relate to how we see the crypto markets move? So I'm sort of an inflation evangelist and what I mean by that is trying to get people to understand why when an economy is actually strong in the data, why they still feel so bad about the data? And one of the things I looked at about a week ago was the employment cost index, right? Which is basically what we all get paid all in, right? What it costs businesses to pay us. And that's up since about the first quarter of 2020 is up, about 14% inflation is up about 18%. So it's that gap that makes people feel like the economy is still bad. You know, we were talking about coffee earlier. I had a really knowledgeable friend of mine call me and say, can you show me a coffee chart because I don't understand why my Starbucks is still a dollar more than it was later or it was last year because all I keep hearing about is inflation coming down. Inflation is the rate of growth of prices. And we still had a positive number this month. Even though it was lower than it was in previous months, you go back to last August month, over month, it was up 0.3 this month, it was up 0.4. So prices are still going up, but they're going up at a much, much slower rate. And that means that the catch up is coming. And that's why you still, you see strikes, right? You see people complaining about the wages they're getting. That's because they haven't caught up to inflation yet. So as long as that remains in check and we still have this push for higher wages, people will actually get to the point on main street where they feel better about the economy overall. All right, Bob, we are gonna have to leave it there. Thanks so much for joining the show. Always a pleasure having you on. Good to see you guys. That was path trading partners, co-founder and Chief Market strategist Bob Aino."

        "content": "\"I can\u2019t even believe that people would be allowed to burn tires.\"\n\nTire Fire\n\nA Pennsylvania crypto company wants to burn tires to fuel Bitcoin mining \u2014 and community members from the area surrounding the proposed blazes are furious.\n\nIn interviews with The Guardian, residents and environmentalists of Nesquehoning, the quaint Poconos township where Stronghold Digital Mining has asked the Environmental Protection Agency for permission to burn tires to generate energy for its proof-of-concept Bitcoin mining facility, spoke out about the plan.\n\n\"I was shocked,\" Carol Etheridge, who lives near Nesquehoning, told the British newspaper. \"It\u2019s terrible. I can\u2019t even believe that people would be allowed to burn tires.\"\n\nBurning tires as a means to repurpose waste into energy is legal and was once, as The Guardian notes, considered an EPA-approved alternative method to conventional fossil fuels \u2014 in a now-archived page that hasn't been updated since 2016, at least. Stronghold isn't even the first company to attempt the gambit, either: back in 2017, the similarly-generic-named Standard American Mining company partnered with a tire waste reusal outfit to concoct a similar scheme in North Carolina.\n\nThat's not to say the practice is necessarily safe. As the report explains, combusting tires can release, among other byproducts, a mega-toxic type of chemical known as \"furans,\" which have been linked to cancer and have difficulty breaking down in the environment.\n\nBurn, Baby, Burn\n\nStronghold's specialty, per its website, is repurposing \u2014 first with waste coal at its two plants in PA, and now, the company hopes, with used tires.\n\nBut as local environmentalists have argued, both its waste coal programs and its proposed tire combustion plan carry significant environmental impacts.\n\n\"There is no analysis for how [burning tires] will add to the existing burden of legacy pollution in the area,\" Rob Altenburg of the environmentalist group PennFuture told The Guardian.\n\nCharles McPhedran, a lawyer with the environmental group Earthjustice, has told everyone from The Guardian and the local NPR affiliate to Cointelegraph and the Bitcoinist blog that Stronghold is bad news. As he told the British newspaper, \"this sort of disposal of tires is a last resort.\"\n\nAlthough the mining company insists on its website that it is \"actively improving the environment,\" McPhedran pointed out to Cointelegraph that both sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide emissions rose after Stronghold took over Panther Creek Energy Facility, the former coal mine in Nesquehoning where it wants to burn tires to fuel up to 15 percent of its operation. Overall, he told local NPR affiliate State Impact, the effect is similar to burning coal for energy.\n\nThe attorney and the group he represents are now calling on the state government to deny Stronghold's application to burn tires.\n\n\"Panther Creek already poses a threat to Pennsylvania\u2019s air quality,\" McPhedran told the local Times News paper. \"Considering tire-derived fuel introduces another issue.\"\n\nMore on energy: Teen Activist Lectures Greenpeace to Stop Railing Against Nuclear Power"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nThe CEO of Galaxy Digital predicts a four- to six-month regulatory window for a spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nMike Novogratz warned investors that he would \u201cfight like cats and dogs to win market share\u201d\n\nInvesco renewed its application only a few days after BlackRock resubmitted\n\nGalaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz used insider connections at BlackRock and Invesco where it is claimed that institutional players think that regulatory approval for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund was a \u201cquestion of when, not if.\u201d\n\nBlackRock told CCN it has filed a registration statement with the SEC, and due to regulatory filing restrictions, it is not able to provide further comment.\n\nBitcoin ETF Likely 6 Months Away\n\nDuring the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call on August 8, Novogratz commented that the connections anticipate that the SEC would approve spot Bitcoin ETFs within the following four to six months.\n\nAccording to \"contacts\" from inside BlackRock and Invesco spot Bitcoin ETF approval a matter of \"when, not if\" likely in \"four to six months\" \u2014 Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz on earnings call this morning pic.twitter.com/TIhHC7xnHI \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) August 8, 2023\n\nThe introduction of Bitcoin ETFs by major companies like BlackRock has started to change institutional investors\u2019 perceptions of the leading cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cInstitutions have come back some in the immediate term. They\u2019ve come back in futures. They\u2019ve come back in some of these stocks. But importantly, they\u2019re coming back in structural ways,\u201d he stated .\n\nNovogratz cited as examples Monday\u2019s stablecoin launch by PayPal Holdings and Deutsche Bank\u2019s request for cryptocurrency custody services. Many organizations, including college endowments, pension funds, and asset managers, \u201cgot to the starting line, and then they all backed away,\u201d he added, prior to the FTX exchange\u2019s collapse.\n\nGlobally, stablecoin usage is increasing, according to Novogratz. With PayPal\u2019s involvement, \u201cthey could end up creating a stablecoin that gives interest \u2014 which right now would be a security \u2014 that really destabilizes the banks.\u201d\n\nFink as a Spearhead\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who formerly referred to Bitcoin as a \u201cspeculative investment\u201d but has now changed his mind, is perhaps best known for spearheading the asset management industry\u2019s adoption of the digital currency.\n\nNovogratz previously claimed that Fink had supported Bitcoin as the first \u201cglobal money,\u201d giving the virtual currency additional legitimacy within the conventional financial sector.\n\nThe approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF, in Novogratz\u2019s opinion, is the opening for institutional investment into the cryptocurrency market since it will make it \u201cvery easy for people to make large allocations into the space.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Novogratz underlined Galaxy Digital\u2019s determination to vigorously compete for a part of the ETF industry, saying:\n\n\u201cOnce it\u2019s approved, we\u2019re going to fight like cats and dogs to win market share.\u201d\n\nAlso notable is \"we're going to fight like cats and dogs for mkt share\" this is something Cathie Wood brought up on ETF IQ yest too which is: All of these ETFs will basically do the same thing (hold btc) so marketing is going to be crucial and thus, heavy and prob over the top \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) August 8, 2023\n\nAn ETF Might Arrive Even Sooner\n\nChris Ferraro, president of Galaxy Digital, said in answer to a query that he wouldn\u2019t be shocked if the SEC ultimately approves a prospective Bitcoin ETF to avoid being branded as \u201cobstructionist.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe that\u2019s where the potential ETF approval comes in saying, hey, you can\u2019t call us anti-crypto, we just approved an ETF,\u201d the author commented and added the company is thus hoping that its filing will receive the same treatment.\n\nMeanwhile, depending on the outcome of Grayscale\u2019s case against the SEC, some analysts think the wave of spot Bitcoin ETFs may arrive even sooner.\n\nLast year, Grayscale filed a lawsuit against the SEC when the agency denied its request to turn its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot ETF..\n\n\"If the SEC loses its case against @Grayscale , as we expect, the path of least resistance would be a wave of simultaneous approvals for all spot #Bitcoin ETF applicants \u2014 including Grayscale and the other eight active filings.\" @NYCStein in @Bloomberg today. Cc @EricBalchunas \u2026 pic.twitter.com/k72W6Ek7RK \u2014 Craig Salm (@CraigSalm) August 2, 2023\n\nThe path of least resistance, according to analysts , would be the simultaneous acceptance of a number of or all spot Bitcoin ETF applicants should the SEC lose its lawsuit against Grayscale.\n\nBlackRocks\u2019s Win Would Show the SEC\u2019s Confidence\n\nJeff Feng, co-founder of SEI Labs and a former Goldman Sachs analyst, commented that BlackRock obviously believes that its ETF application will allow it to keep a strong presence in international capital markets. He added that if it becomes successful, it would demonstrate the SEC\u2019s confidence in its leadership to handle the difficulties of a novel product while also legitimizing Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cGiven BlackRock\u2019s change in its position about bitcoin over the last few years, it\u2019s clear that they do not view bitcoin and tokenization as something that can be ignored as a globally traded asset,\u201d he said .\n\nThe success of the first Bitcoin Futures ETF to receive regulatory approval is proof that the first to market will probably make a fortune. Just two days after its debut, the ProShares Bitcoin ETF recorded $1.2 billion in turnover, which is the quickest an ETF has ever done so.\n\nBecause of this alleged first-mover advantage, certain businesses, like Grayscale Investments, have asked the SEC to consider all spot Bitcoin ETF applications similarly and approve them all at once, should that be their preferred course of action.\n\nA SEC\u2019s decision is anticipated this week to be made in accordance with the 45-day window starting from the date of the initial submission."

        "content": "Jonelle Still, the director of investigations and intelligence at CipherTrace, a Mastercard company, recently submitted a report supporting the defense in the United States v. Roman Sterlingov, a criminal case involving the Bitcoin Fog cryptocurrency mixing service.\n\nThe company\u2019s involvement in the case comes at the behest of Sterlingov\u2019s defense attorneys and includes a 41-page report detailing Still\u2019s opinion on the efficacy of data obtained by the prosecution from blockchain investigation organization Chainalysis.\n\nAt the core of the report is the assertion that data provided by Chainalysis cannot be corroborated on-chain:\n\n\u201cThe blockchain forensics and tracing tools used in this case were misused to erroneously conclude that Mr. Sterlingov was the operator of Bitcoin Fog when no such evidence exists on-chain.\u201d\n\nSterlingov has been accused by the United States government of being the founder of Bitcoin Fog, a cryptocurrency mixing service that allegedly participated in illegal money laundering transactions in the claimed amount of $336 million.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, Sterlingov was arrested in April of 2021 after a 10-year investigation resulted in the allegations. According to his attorneys, the criminal claims were based on evidence provided by Chainalysis.\n\nIn a recent podcast, Sterlingov\u2019s legal representatives, Tor Ekeland and Michael Hassard, laid out the case from their perspective. They assert that Chainalysis failed to trace transactions back to their client using data and instead merely provided the prosecution with an opinion on the matter of who founded Bitcoin Fog.\n\nEkeland and Hassard claim that the government\u2019s case is built on Chainalysis\u2019 data and the assertion that in 2019 IRS agents sent a message to \u201cwhatever they think is the help desk or whatever\u201d at Bitcoin Fog asking if the service would be good to launder Bitcoin they\u2019d earned selling \u201cmolly\u201d (a street name for 3,4-methyl\u200benedioxy\u200bmethamphetamine).\n\nRelated: Darknet crypto mixer operator pleads guilty to laundering $300M in BTC\n\nThe lawyers claim that Bitcoin Fog never responded to the message and that the IRS agents went ahead and proceeded to use the Bitcoin Fog service in what the U.S. now claims was a laundering scheme. Ekeland and Hassard say the government never actually sold molly for Bitcoin (BTC) with the intent of laundering the proceeds through the Bitcoin Fog service.\n\nThe report provided by CipherTrace highlights some of the issues surrounding the Chainalysis data, including Still\u2019s opinion that the conclusions drawn from it (that Sterlingov is the founder of Bitcoin Fog) cannot be demonstrated with on-chain data.\n\nStill, the report\u2019s author ultimately concludes that \u201cBlockchain forensics should only be used to generate investigatory leads. Standing alone, they are insufficient as a primary source of evidence.\u201d The author continues to state that it is \u201cstriking\u201d that the U.S. and Chainalysis reached the conclusions they did without \u201cany corroborating evidence for the blockchain forensics.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo prevent wrongful arrests like this one,\u201d writes Still, \u201cit is recommended that Chainalysis, and their methodologies of blockchain analysis be independently audited.\u201d\n\nAs the U.S. has seized all of Sterlingov\u2019s assets while he\u2019s on trial, his defense team and CipherTrace have aided his legal efforts pro bono."

Trading with unregulated brokers will not qualify for investor protection.\n\nBitcoin 360 AI \u2013 Explained\n\nBitcoin 360 AI is a new cryptocurrency trading platform that claims to offer a unique way of trading digital assets, including some of the best cryptocurrencies. According to the platform\u2019s website, Bitcoin 360 AI deploys a reliable auto-trading software, which has the capability to automatically scan the volatile cryptocurrency markets to suggest new trades and signals.\n\nBoth new and seasoned traders with less experience or time on their hands can leverage Bitcoin 360 AI\u2019s trading software to enter the cryptocurrency markets. The platform is created via cutting-edge technology, which assists in automatically scanning and navigating popular digital currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP and more.\n\nAfter signing up for free and making a minimum deposit of $250, users can begin using the platform\u2019s trading software to open new positions. However, the lack of information and clarity on the runners of the platform makes it difficult to verify any of the claims that the Bitcoin 360 AI claims to offer.\n\nBitcoin 360 AI \u2013 Strengths & Weaknesses\n\nTo get a better understanding of some of the platform\u2019s offerings, our Bitcoin 360 AI review will discuss some of the platform\u2019s pros and cons.\n\nPros\n\nAuto Trading software that claims to directly scans the market for new crypto signals\n\nNo sign-up fees\n\nGives access to some of the largest crypto assets\n\nCons\n\nHigh minimum deposit ($250)\n\nLack of information about the platform owners\n\nVisit Bitcoin 360 AI\n\nCryptocurrencies are unregulated. Trading with unregulated brokers will not qualify for investor protection.\n\nHow Does Bitcoin 360 AI Operate?\n\nUnlike most cryptocurrency exchanges that act as a platform to connect users with popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin 360 AI claims to take it a step further. After joining Bitcoin 360 AI, investors can access automatic trading software that can make trades on behalf of the user.\n\nAccording to its website, the Coin App 360 AI platform leverages its in-built software, which claims to have been made with advanced technology. In an effort to discover potentially profitable trades, the software constantly scans the cryptocurrency markets in real-time.\n\nAfter creating an account with Bitcoin 360 AI, users can make a minimum deposit of $250 and then choose between an auto trading feature or the manual platform option. The automatic trading feature can be set live and will begin making trades with your funds. With the manual trading feature, investors can get signals from the platform and open new trades independently.\n\nAccording to the website, the software boasts an unparalleled performance due to its ultra-modern technology. The software can scan the markets 0.01 seconds faster than any other platform, which is one of the reasons it claims to be successful. Bitcoin 360 AI also claims to boast a success rate of 99.4%, but we cannot verify these claims due to the lack of information available without creating an account.\n\nMain Features of Bitcoin 360 AI\n\nThe sections below discuss some of the main features of the Bitcoin 360 AI trading platform, as per the information on its website.\n\nHigh-Speed Trading\n\nOne of the key characteristics of Bit App 360 AI is that it boasts the ability to scan the markets at a fast speed to make new trades. According to the platform, Bitcoin 360 AI\u2019s software can scan the markets with its technology 0.01 seconds quicker than any competitor.\n\nWith the use of artificial intelligence, the software analyzes real-time market data in order to find potentially profitable trades to suggest and make on behalf of its users. Offering high levels of customization, users can simply change to an automatic trading mode with the click of a button and give the software control over their funds.\n\nDue to the ultra-rare technology that Bitcoin 360 AI claims to offer, investors can potentially earn a high yield on their investment since the success rate is suggested to be 99.4%. However, we cannot verify any of these claims at this time.\n\nDemo Account\n\nSimilar to tools like Immediate Connect and BitiCodes, another feature which Bitcoin 360 AI has is a demo account. The demo platforms can be leveraged by new customers who are looking to test out the platform features and trading modes without risking any real funds.\n\nCoin App 360 AI claims to incorporate a backtesting feature that lets investors test their future trading signals and strategies. Thus, one can get a feel of the platform and then decide whether or not to use the Bitcoin 360 AI trading bot.\n\nData Protection\n\nOn Bitcoin 360 AI, traders can be ensured that their data and trading activities will be kept private. The website claims to use advanced technology and security measures, which will be leveraged to protect sensitive information.\n\nThe platform also suggests that it adheres to all laws and regulations to protect its customers and keep the accounts safe.\n\nFast Account Set-up and Withdrawals\n\nWith Bitcoin 360 AI, investors can quickly visit the website, enter their personal details and create an account.

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether rise; Solana leads post-PayPal stablecoin launch rally; several US banks downgraded - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin rose on Wednesday morning in Asia to trade above US$29,700. Ether also logged gains along with all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies. Solana led the winners with an almost 5% jump. The crypto rally followed PayPal\u2019s launch of a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin on Monday. That coincided with a sharp drop in global government bond yields Tuesday after the release of China\u2019s weaker-than-expected economic data. Meanwhile, the Forkast 500 NFT index edged higher on increased trading volumes, while U.S. stock futures traded lower as ratings agency Moody\u2019s downgraded several mid-size U.S. banks.\n\nCryptos rally\n\nBitcoin rose 2.02% in the last 24 hours to US$29,764.75 as of 07:50 a.m. in Hong Kong and moved up 0.41% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency briefly breached the US$30,000 resistance level on early Wednesday morning.\n\nEther gained 1.61% to US$1,855.88 but was still down 0.82% over the past seven days. All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded higher, with Solana\u2019s SOL leading the winners. The token rose 4.93% to US$24.19 and logged a weekly gain of 1.07%.\n\nThe crypto market received a boost from global payment giant PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch on Monday. Known as PayPal USD (PYUSD), the stablecoin will allow users in the U.S. to make transfers to compatible external wallets, pay other customers and purchase foreign currencies using the token.\n\n\u201cPayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch is an important development for crypto within the U.S. Although the initial launch is limited, with PayPal\u2019s size and global reach, it is likely to impact global stablecoin usage and adoption going forward,\u201d said William Cai, co-founder and managing partner at U.S.-based asset management firm Wilshire Phoenix.\n\n\u201cIt is another clear signal of institutional confidence that crypto isn\u2019t going away and will emerge from this \u2018crypto winter\u2019 stronger,\u201d added Cai. \u201cStablecoin is the grease of the crypto markets. Overall increase in stablecoin market cap will coincide with a major upward trend in crypto prices.\u201d\n\nGreta Yuan, head of research at Hong Kong-headquartered digital asset exchange VDX, said that while it is not the first time major institutions have entered the stablecoin space, previous attempts met with substantial regulatory obstacles.\n\n\u201cThe recent progress of a bill aimed at establishing a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, coupled with PayPal\u2019s deep expertise in the payment industry, has the potential to set up PayPal for a more promising growth path,\u201d Yuan added\n\nMeanwhile, Ark Invest Chief Executive Officer Cathie Wood said in a Tuesday interview with Bloomberg that she expected the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve multiple spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) at the same time.\n\nThere is now a growing sense of optimism that successful ETF applications from major U.S. asset managers including BlackRock, Fidelity Investments and Wisdom Tree could be the start of large-scale institutional investment in the digital asset space.\n\nLater on Tuesday, Mike Novogratz, CEO of investment management firm Galaxy Capital, reportedly said via conference call that the SEC\u2019s approval of a Bitcoin ETF was likely a matter of \u201cwhen, not if.\u201d Issuers of Bitcoin ETF would, he said, \u201cfight like cats and dogs to win market share\u201d once they received approvals.\n\n\u201cThis could have caused the 3-4% rally in Bitcoin prices overnight,\u201d said Markus Thielen, Head of Research & Strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport.\n\n\u201cA common pattern is emerging where Bitcoin prices tend to rally during US trading hours but retrace during Asian trading hours,\u201d Thielen added. \u201cNevertheless, Bitcoin is still in a trading range but a potential SEC approval could push prices higher.\u201d\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization gained 1.71% in the past 24 hours to US$1.18 trillion, while trading volume moved up 9.37% to US$36 billion.\n\nSome pep in the step for NFTs\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index inched up 0.14% in the past 24 hours to 2,483.18 as of 09:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, but was still down 0.90% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum NFT index also logged gains, while the Solana, Polygon and Cardano indexes dropped.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume surged 64.03% in the past 24 hours to over US$20.4 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volume on the Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, and Cardano blockchains all also logged increases, while the Bitcoin blockchain saw a drop.\n\n\u201cAgain we\u2019re in the green and suddenly there\u2019s a little pep in traders\u2019 step,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist for Forkast Labs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really beginning to see the type of NFTs that do well in this market, which is cheaper NFTs with high volume. DMarket, Gods Unchained, Sorare and DraftKings all represent a form of gaming, all are pretty darn affordable, and all have thousands of traders. This is what the future of NFTs will really look like,\u201d Petscher added.\n\nAmong NFT collections, Polygon-based DraftKings saw the largest 24-hour sales volume. It rose 26.23% to over US$4.12 million for 85% of total NFT trading volume on the Polygon network. The collection is based on sports and betting company DraftKings\u2019 NFT games.\n\nForkast Labs\u2019 Petscher said that Paypal\u2019s stablecoin launch is providing a timely boost for the NFT industry. The global payment giant could prove successful in onboarding those unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies into the NFT space, he said Tuesday in a video uploaded to Youtube.\n\n\u201cGive them some PayPal stablecoin and then watch OpenSea integrated, and then let them buy Starbucks NFTs on secondary with their PayPal stablecoins,\u201d Petscher said. \u201cThis is huge for the world of crypto and it\u2019s huge for NFTs. This is what building looks like.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, NFTs are seeing growing interest in the art space.\n\nU.K.-based NFT platform ElmonX announced Wednesday that it will partner with international image licensing company Bridgeman Images to mint \u201cSalvator Mundi\u201d \u2014 a painting attributed to Leonardo da Vinci \u2014 as NFT collectibles. The painting was sold for US$$450.3 million at the Christie\u2019s auction house in 2017, making it the most expensive artwork ever sold.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci's masterpiece: Salvator Mundi \ud83d\udd2e\n\n\n\nRediscovered, restored, and auctioned for a record-breaking USD 450,312,500 in 2017, making it the world's most expensive artwork ever sold \ud83d\udcc8\n\n\n\nTwo digital collectibles drop Saturday 12th August 9AM PT only on\u2026 pic.twitter.com/nAppalhFSC \u2014 ElmonX (@elmonx_official) August 8, 2023\n\nElsewhere, Chinese artist Yue Minjun on Tuesday launched Kingdom of the Laughing Man \u2014 a collection of unique NFTs based on his artworks \u2014 on NFT platform LiveArt. The collection has logged a 24-hour sales volume of over US$978,000 and sits third in Crypto Slam\u2019s sales volume rankings, right behind Bored Ape Yacht Club.\n\nU.S. equities drop on bank downgrades, China records annual decline\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded mixed as of 11:50 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures moved higher. The U.S. stock market closed lower on Tuesday.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes were also mixed on Wednesday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng and Japan\u2019s Nikkei logged losses, while South Korea\u2019s Kospi rose.\n\nOn Tuesday, Moody\u2019s Investor Service lowered the credit rating of 10 small and midsize U.S. banks citing funding risks and weaker profitability. The ratings agency warned that it could downgrade several other major U.S. lenders including U.S. Bancorp, Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and State Street Corp.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a big deal in the bigger picture of how the economy operates, because regional banks\u2019 lending is one of the main lubricants of the economy,\u201d said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy and research at asset manager Glenmede, in a Reuters report published Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIf it slows down, the engine just doesn\u2019t work as well,\u201d Pride added.\n\nAll eyes are now on the release of U.S. consumer price index (CPI) data on Thursday. Bloomberg analysts expect the core CPI to rise 0.2% in July, which would be the smallest monthly increase in the past two and a half years.\n\nOn the U.S. inflation front, the Federal Reserve meets on Sep. 19 to make its next move on interest rates.\n\nThe rate now stands at between 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest level in the past 22 years. Analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predict a 86.5% chance there will be no interest rate hike in September, and a 13.5% chance the Fed will raise rates by a further 25-basis-points.\n\nMeanwhile in China, the country\u2019s July CPI posted an annual decrease of 0.3%. The Producer Price Index (PPI) also dropped 4.4% year-on-year, Chinese state media Xinhua News Agency reported Wednesday.\n\nThe dip in July CPI data represents China\u2019s first annual decline since February 2021. However, the drop was smaller than the analysts\u2019 expectation of 0.4%.\n\n\u201cChina is in deflation, for sure, the question is for how long.\u201d Robin Xing, chief China economist for Morgan Stanley, told Bloomberg. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the policy makers how they react.\u201d\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"

        "title": "BItcoin: Navigating Economic Shifts and Financial Challenges - Coinbase",
        "content": "Summary In an environment where many global central banks are still tightening rates, it may seem premature to talk about structural shifts towards disinflation. Yet, in the US at least, we no longer seem to be beleaguered by persistent inflation fears, while the country appears to be enjoying steady economic growth, courtesy of the government\u2019s expansionary fiscal policy. Generative artificial intelligence promises greater long-run productivity and cheaper goods, which may also put a cap on inflation in the future but potentially downsize workforces. We believe that such conditions may warrant the need for loose monetary policies in the long term. Not only will central banks have to manage the supply-demand misalignments that contribute to price instability, but second order objectives may become more meaningful. Worker displacement will need to be offset by new job creation. More government expenditures will mean more borrowing which will need to be offset by lower rates to reduce the costs of debt service. All things being equal, we think that the potential combined effect of expansionary fiscal and monetary policy should support bitcoin in the long term. That is, bitcoin is not only a technologically innovative instrument but a financially innovative one. Its unique properties (as a globally accessible, decentralized supranational asset with a fixed supply) may offer relative stability against the shifting tides of fiat debasement and profligate spending. Moreover, crypto allocations can diversify fund managers\u2019 exposure to uncommon sources of risk in traditional \u201cbalanced\u201d equity vs bond portfolios.\n\nThe long bitcoin story About a year ago, the biggest concern for the macroeconomic environment was that inflation was so persistent that it wasn\u2019t clear that even manufacturing a recession would be enough to bring it down. That\u2019s a far cry from where we are today, where at least in the US, inflation seems to be under control and economic growth has been steady. Note that we are seeing some divergence between what\u2019s happening in the US compared to the rest of the world, mostly because of expansionary US fiscal policy. But overall, energy price shocks have subsided, real wage growth is negative and global supply chains are once again facilitating the supply of cheap goods. The biggest fear that many had last year was that the price alignments stemming from the pandemic were structural. That didn\u2019t seem entirely outlandish at the time because it seemed to cap off a multi-year trend of de-globalization and near-shoring. The economic era of cheap stuff seemed to be over. Instead, prudence in the eurozone helped relieve anxiety over gas shortages alongside a mild winter. Economic activity in China has slowed materially, and its stockpiling of crude oil has moderated. The value of its exports in USD terms is down for the third straight month by 14.5% YoY (July), which may incentivize the country to boost production. China\u2019s producer price index (PPI) fell 4.4% YoY last month, which may also be a precursor to lower US prices in the months ahead. Meanwhile, generative artificial intelligence (AI) may be a game changer for the world\u2019s future economic prospects. Generative AI promises to raise productivity, lower input costs and possibly moderate the size of workforces going forward. Goldman Sachs reported in late March that around two-thirds of current occupations are exposed to AI task automation and as much as a quarter to half of all work tasks. That is, AI has the potential to displace hundreds of millions of jobs at scale, while signaling a structural shift towards cheaper goods \u2013 possibly putting a ceiling on inflation. The implications of such a trend is that central banks may need to retain loose monetary policy to avert the misalignment between supply and demand. Keeping people in jobs (i.e. maximum sustainable employment) is a part of the Federal Reserve\u2019s dual mandate as well as a secondary objective for the European Central Bank. Loose monetary policy may also be required because overall government spending is increasing. For example, in the US, the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act represent US$2.1T in new expenditures over the next few years. The US government pays for this via higher taxes but more importantly, higher borrowing. In fact, the Treasury Department recently announced an increase in its supply of new issuance \u2013 boosting its net borrowing for 3Q23 alone from $733B to $1T. Very likely, we believe the Fed will need to maintain an expansionary stance in order to manage this debt burden in a sustainable way over the long run or otherwise risk a potential debt crisis. That is, they will need to lower rates or use quantitative easing to reduce the costs of servicing this debt over the long term. Structurally, we think all of this favors a long bitcoin world.\n\nWhat, me worry? What distinguishes bitcoin as a financially innovative instrument is that bitcoin is a globally accessible, decentralized supranational asset with a fixed supply. This is distinct from bitcoin being a technologically innovative instrument due to its cryptographic ability to facilitate trustless, tamper-proof transactions. In our view, what bitcoin represents as a financial instrument makes it an exceptional hedge for excessive fluctuations in money supply and falling real rates. To be clear however, we don\u2019t necessarily believe that increases in the global supply of fiat currency must translate to uncontrollable rises in the price level of goods and services. The dramatic increase in the M2 money supply in the early stages of the pandemic pressured the multilateral USD index level lower, weakening the currency\u2019s safe haven properties but leaving inflation mostly subdued at the time. (The effects of money supply growth may operate with variable lags.) Higher rates (or the prospect of higher rates) in 2022 then precipitated the USD\u2019s recovery, raising confidence in its reserve status at a time when real incomes were being eroded. We believe that bitcoin\u2019s weak performance last year was more a response to such effects of central bank tightening and the withdrawal of liquidity around the world, and not strictly to upside inflationary pressures. Moreover, the selloff in bitcoin followed a major fiscal regime shift in 2020-21 which had been triggered by the pandemic. Modern monetary theory (MMT) was employed in earnest during that time as countries responded to a unique, once-in-a-lifetime health crisis. That led many countries to spend without scrutinizing the long-term effects on debts and deficits. During this time, bitcoin played a dual role. Not only did it represent an alternative to the traditional financial system, but it operated as an important portfolio diversifier because of its low-to\u2013negative correlation to stocks and/or bonds at that time. See chart 2. That dynamic shifted last year for two separate but interrelated reasons. First, as more buyers accumulated bitcoin, the macro developments that informed their allocation decisions for the traditional financial instruments in their portfolios also impacted the non-traditional assets in their portfolios (including but not limited to cryptocurrencies). Second, and perhaps more importantly, the magnitude of the market distress in 2022 represented such a unified fundamental theme that it led investors to become more single-minded about their allocations. These factors are what we believe led to a rise in the correlation between crypto and other asset classes. Over the course of 2023, that correlation has declined sharply to a coefficient of 0.10 based on bitcoin and S&P 500 daily returns over a 90-day window. This suggests that these variables have little-to-no relationship at the moment, as the factors driving digital asset performance are once again more endogenous rather than exogenous to the crypto ecosystem. Moreover, in a recent study , we\u2019ve found that crypto allocations can diversify fund managers\u2019 exposure to uncommon sources of risk in traditional \u201cbalanced\u201d equity vs bond portfolios. That is, our multi-factor risk model shows that adding cryptocurrencies to a portfolio can increase the diversification benefits from a systematic risk perspective. Not only that, but these contributions to factor diversification tend to rise at a faster than linear pace.\n\nNew rates, new challenges Keep in mind too that the current era of high global interest rates is a limiting factor on the available universe of instruments for investors. The higher cost of capital reduces earnings expectations, for example, which partly explains why the total global equity market cap fell from $121.5T at the end of 2021 to $97.6T at the end of 2022, according to Bloomberg. Over the same period, SIFMA reports that the total outstanding of global fixed income markets fell from $134.1T to $129.8T. Among the higher yielding instruments, the size of the junk bond market is down nearly 10% from its 3Q21 highs to $1.42T, while high-yield loans are not faring much better. During the pandemic, the private credit market benefited from those declines, rising from $1T to $1.55T. But now, opportunities in private markets are starting to be impacted as well. Large asset management portfolios are already loaded up on private equity allocations, and fundraising is down 35% compared to mid-year 2022, according to Bain & Co . Moreover, not only has dealmaking slowed down, but defaults on the leveraged loans used to finance corporate buyouts are on the rise. According to Deutsche Bank , credit losses are expected to pick up in 2H23 then increase sharply next year with a peak in defaults anticipated in 4Q24. That said, more banks like JP Morgan and Bank of America believe that the US may avert a recession altogether in this cycle, which may temper such harsh credit loss forecasts. In our view, it\u2019s still too early to tell, as the line between a recession and a soft landing is fairly thin. Even if a US recession is avoided, chances are we may nevertheless see subpar growth next year. Plus, we think that despite the Fed\u2019s efforts (via liquidity backstops, for example), US regional banks continue to look fragile. As recently as August 7, ratings agency Moody\u2019s (1) downgraded the credit ratings of ten mid-sized US banks, (2) are reviewing six banks for downgrade and (3) put a negative outlook on eleven of the nation's largest lenders. In fact, we believe that investor concerns surrounding an approaching credit \u201cmaturity wall\u201d in 2H24 or 1H25 could increase excess demand for alternatives like bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies as a means of diversifying the concentration of credit risk in existing portfolios. Such developments may also coincide with the approval of one or more spot bitcoin ETF(s) in 1Q24 as well as the bitcoin rewards halving in 2Q24, both of which are events that we believe could support increased adoption overall."

Dubbed .frens, the project brings the social aspect of Bitcoin onto its immutable blockchain.\n\nSpawning from the decade-old meme term fren\u2013which means friend\u2013the .frens protocol is designed to build a social graph on Bitcoin where users declare their social connections via Ordinals Inscriptions. The protocol also relies on an indexing feature that creates a reputation score depending on how many interactions a particular address has\u2014a measure of social capital.\n\nThe protocol shares its name with many other unrelated projects, including a Fren Protocol deflationary pepecoin token, a Frens Protocol oracle API, and a Frenz NFT metaverse.

Discover SCENE\n\nXverse, a Bitcoin wallet designed to work with projects native to the coin, announced on Thursday a seed funding round of $5 million led by Jump Crypto.\n\nOther participants in the round included Franklin Templeton, the Bitcoin Frontier Fund, Old Fashion Research, and several strategic angel investors, Xverse told Decrypt in a written statement.\n\nXverse\u2019s wallet, which is available as a Chrome browser extension and mobile app, is billed as a \u201cBitcoin wallet for Web3.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt works with networks that push crypto\u2019s largest coin beyond a pure focus on financial transactions like Ordinals, Lighting Network, and Stacks.\n\nThe company sees Bitcoin as a growing frontier for decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, which have become established staples of Ethereum over the past few years.\n\nThe funding will help Xverse pursue more advanced features in emerging areas, company founder and CEO Ken Liao told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cWe want to power all kinds of web applications built on top of Bitcoin, whether that\u2019s through Ordinals or Layer-2s like Stacks and Lightning,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we see something that's promising and can bring a lot of utility, we are into supporting that as well.\u201d\n\nOrdinals, a protocol that allows for the creation of NFT-like assets on Bitcoin by attaching data to individual satoshi (equal to 1/1,000,000 of a whole Bitcoin), has been a boon to Xverse, Liao said. It gave the firm a shot in the arm and room to grow, he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe firm established itself as an early mover in the Ordinals space, rolling out support for inscriptions this past February\u2014a month after Ordinals launched. As of late, Xverse has given users a way to store Ordinals-based assets on Ledger\u2019s hardware wallet.\n\nThat includes the ability to store BRC-20 tokens, which take inspiration from ERC-20 tokens. The experimental class of coins has notched a market cap of close to $260 million since being introduced in March, according to CoinGecko.\n\nXverse is one of the most integrated Bitcoin wallets when it comes to Ordinals-related applications, Liao said, striking partnerships with the NFT marketplace Magic Eden and the exchange OKX as well.\n\nWhile enthusiasm among venture capitalists for investing in crypto companies has waned over the past year, Liao said Ordinals piqued the interest of many.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a lot of ways for people to make money with applications built on top of Bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now, with Ordinals, even though it's just the beginning, they can see that \u2018hey, there's this demand.\u2019\u201d\n\nSupport for Ordinals came a year after the firm adapted to Stacks, a network built on top of Bitcoin that allows developers to deploy smart contracts on Bitcoin and has its own NFT ecosystem too.\n\nXverse started out as purely a Bitcoin wallet that didn\u2019t support other networks, but its goal is to become the go-to wallet for any Bitcoin-related applications, Liao explained.\n\n\u201cWe want to become the MetaMask of the Bitcoin ecosystem, but I think we can go even further beyond that,\u201d Liao said. \u201cBitcoin is bigger than Ethereum, and there's a lot of capital locked in Bitcoin that could be used in Web3 applications.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Bitcoin and other top crypto tokens were mostly higher on Wednesday ahead of the key economic data due later this week. The entire narrative for Bitcoin has shifted towards the Bitcoin ETF, which is less volatile of late as the $30,000-mark is a critical threshold. But macros continue to weigh.\n\n\n\nBitcoin was back in action on Wednesday as the largest crypto token gained more than 2 per cent to regain 29,500-mark. However, its largest peer, Ethereum was trading higher, rising more than a per cent but could not race past $1,850-levels. Price action in the major altcoins was on the higher side.\n\n\n\nBitcoin\u2019s prices crossed $30,000 before settling at trading above the $29,500 level. This shift might be because of China's reduced trade figures for July and the US 10-year Treasury yield dropped. Over the past 24 hours, Solana, Shiba Inu, Hedera, and TonCoin gained Ethereum continuing trading between the $1,800-$1,900 range, said Edul Patel, CEO & Co-founder at Mudrex.\n\n\n\nBarring a few exceptions, all top crypto tokens were trading higher on Wednesday. Shiba Inu and Solana gained more than 5 per cent each, while Polygon gained 4 per cent. XRP rose 3 per cent, whereas Cardano, Polkadot and Litecoin added 2 per cent each. Among the losers, Bitcoin Cash and Tron were about a per cent each.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly higher, rising up to $1.19 trillion-mark as it rose as much as 2 per cent in the last 24 hours.

However, if MATIC is unable to break through the $0.75 barrier, price may fall.

        "content": "Thu 10 Aug 2023 \u25aa 8 min of reading \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nDespite an unstoppable bear market, bitcoin (BTC) is still attracting investors. This infatuation with the flagship crypto is no accident. It\u2019s based on the financial relevance the asset has built up over the 14 years of its existence. A period during which the asset has seen its lows. The asset\u2019s lowest valuation was $0.001, its first estimated value in October 2009. The flagship crypto has also experienced highs. In November 2021, the price of bitcoin reached a valuation of $69,992. This figure remains, by far, the highest ever reached by bitcoin since it came into existence. Will the leading cryptocurrency return to this level again? Indeed, bitcoin seems to be facing a glass ceiling. Benefiting from the dynamics of the crypto market, the asset has twice reached a price of $30,000 this year. A level that the flagship crypto was subsequently unable to break through. Yet many players in the crypto industry don\u2019t seem to trust these trends. Indeed, many of them have repeatedly expressed their optimism in this regard. They believe that, given current economic and financial conditions, the price would explode. Could this be the reason why many asset managers are scrambling to buy as many bitcoins as possible? Find out below.\n\nThe unbridled race for Bitcoin\u2026\n\nThe price of bitcoin (BTC) is falling. But the asset is attractive, that\u2019s a fact. A fact confirmed by the operating results of certain companies in the second quarter of 2023. This is the case of Tether Limited, the crypto company behind stablecoin USDT.\n\nPaolo Ardoino, the company\u2019s CTO, made this clear in a recent speech. In it, he acknowledged the substantial investment made by Tether Limited during this financial year. This expenditure would amount to some $45.4 million. These funds were used to acquire 1,529 bitcoins.\n\nOn analysis, Tether Limited\u2019s operational choice to acquire bitcoin does not appear to be tendentious or opportunistic. Since the beginning of the year, the crypto firm had announced that it would allocate part of its quarterly profits to bitcoin. The acquisition of substantial volumes of BTC therefore follows this logic.\n\nIn line with this, up to 15% of the company\u2019s quarterly profits were used to buy bitcoin. This brought the total number of BTC held by the company to 54,000, for a portfolio valued at around $1.56 billion. Tether is therefore, to say the least, a whale of the bitcoin market.\n\nAnother company, this time a financial one, and not the least on the bitcoin market, has made similar transactions. This is MicroStrategy, the business intelligence software company co-founded by Michael J. Saylor, who is the company\u2019s Executive Chairman.\n\nAs of June 27, 2023, MicroStrategy held some 152,333 bitcoins. Total assets valued at around $4 billion. A price calculated by taking into account the current unit price of bitcoin of around $29,000. However, despite being one of the largest holders of BTC in the United States, the company has admitted to acquiring additional BTC. 467 in July, for a total of 12,333 bitcoins acquired at $347 million during the quarter.\n\n\u201cOur bitcoin holdings increased to 152,800 bitcoins as of July 31, 2023, with the addition in the second quarter of 12,333 bitcoins being the largest increase in a single quarter since Q2 2021,\u201d said MicroStrategy CFO Andrew Kang.\n\nIn the light of this data, a clear trend seems to be emerging. A bit like an arms race, some companies are in a frenzy to buy bitcoin. How can such a rush be explained? Especially since the crypto market has been showing signs of running out of steam for some time now. A number of recent and upcoming events may provide some clues.\n\n\u2026 motivated by current trends \u2026?\n\nIf companies like Tether Limited and MicroStrategy are injecting substantial funds into bitcoin, it\u2019s not for fun. There is potentially a well-thought-out strategy behind this choice, based on bitcoin and its explosive potential. At least, that\u2019s what many crypto market analysts envisage. By the end of the year for the optimists, or 2024 for the more reserved.\n\nThe basis for this outlook: first and foremost, the performance of the flagship crypto. Since the beginning of the year, it seems to have laughed off the bear market. Although it hasn\u2019t come close to its historic valuation peaks, bitcoin is still alive and kicking. The asset has remained extremely dynamic on the market, buoyed by a deleterious economic context. This situation is linked to a certain crisis of confidence in traditional currency, which is suffering from sustained inflation.\n\nFrom January 2023 to the present day, bitcoin has in fact staged an impressive rally. Its valuation has risen by almost 76%. This trend is attracting renewed interest from institutional investors. Asset manager BlackRock is the best illustration of this trend. Larry Fink, the company\u2019s boss, who was one of bitcoin\u2019s detractors, has suddenly changed his position.\n\nConvinced of the asset\u2019s relevance, the head of the company sent a Bitcoin ETF application to the SEC. Several other leading asset managers such as Fidelity, WisdomTree and Invesco followed suit. Many analysts estimated that the chances of success of these proceedings would only be a 50% winning bet. Bloomberg\u2019s ETF experts put the odds at around 65%.\n\nThe race for bitcoin could therefore be explained by these different reasons. But they may not be the only ones.\n\n\u2026 and future trends?\n\nThe halving of bitcoin could, to some extent, explain the bitcoin acquisition frenzy of Tether Limited and Microstrategy. This event, programmed into the bitcoin protocol to occur approximately every four years, is generally bullish. David Gamble, an executive at Blockware Solutions, has predicted that the crypto market will reach a market capitalization of $10 trillion. That\u2019s within the next few years. A prospect whose realization would be linked to the arrival of traditional institutional investors on the decentralized financial market (DeFi). A dynamic which, he believes, could be a positive step in DeFi\u2019s evolution.\n\nDavid Gamble acknowledges the possibility of a meteoric rise in the price of BTC at the advent of halving next year. He therefore recommended that investors consider buying as many bitcoins as possible. A way for them to anticipate a significant appreciation in the asset\u2019s value. On the basis of this argument, we can reasonably assume that Tether Limited and Microstrategy are on the right track.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe bitcoin acquisition policy deployed by players such as Tether Limited and MicroStrategy is not insignificant. It reflects a trend towards investment in the flagship cryptocurrency. This dynamic seems to follow on from bitcoin\u2019s operating results this year, despite a crypto market in decline. It is also potentially the consequence of a rush by institutional investors into the decentralized finance market (DeFi). That said, firms Tether Limited and MicroStrategy appear to be gearing up to profit from a potential BTC surge. A number of financial and crypto market analysts agree.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "title": "Worldcoin explained: Everything you need to know - TechTarget",
        "content": "AI continues to grow at a furious pace. While there are many benefits to AI, such as time saving and writing prompts, there are also some challenges and dangers, including deepfakes and fraud.\n\nOn July 24, 2023, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman introduced Worldcoin as a new cryptocurrency that offers a new and unique method for identification to reduce the risk of fraud, and all eyes are on it -- literally.\n\nThe new cryptocurrency determines \"personhood\" with a scan of the eyes, helping to prove someone is a person and not a robot.\n\nWhat is Worldcoin? Altman, along with Alex Blania and Max Novendstern, co-founded the cryptocurrency initiative and online platform known as Worldcoin. It combines AI technologies with cryptocurrencies and blockchain in an open source protocol to give anyone access to a global economy. Worldcoin is decentralized, like other cryptocurrencies, which means the decisions are made by users and not a centralized entity, such as a bank. It took two years to develop this project. It seeks to address income inequality through a unique World ID. The World ID proves that someone is a person and not some form of bot or AI. There are three parts to this project: A unique digital identity to be used globally. A global currency via Worldcoin tokens. An app for payments, transfers and purchases using cryptocurrency or traditional assets. Learn more about the pros and cons of cryptocurrency.\n\nHow does Worldcoin work? Worldcoin is different from other popular cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, because it offers people a token for the future without requiring any investment funds upfront. The Worldcoin project aims to help create a global economy for all, regardless of country or economic status. To get Worldcoin, people need to scan their eyes through a sphere-shaped device called the Orb to ensure everyone is human and only signs up once. The unique identifier is taking center stage as AI continues to grow, and proving someone is a person versus a machine is vital with the rise of AI. Irises are distinct for each person, similar to fingerprints. The iris structure of the subject's eyes is used by the Orb to generate a special identifying code that serves as the person's unique identifier. The code is then saved on the Worldcoin decentralized blockchain to prevent others from replicating the code. The scans are anonymized so they cannot be traced to that person after the identifier is created. Here are the main differences between a decentralized blockchain and a centralized blockchain. Worldcoin uses a decentralized blockchain. The Orb does not store biometric data but does keep an IrisHash, which is a set of generated numbers to identify the person based on their scan. After a person receives their IrisHash and crypto wallet, they get their World ID or digital passport. People can find an Orb center for scanning in facilities across 35 countries. The Orb is about the size of a bowling ball and conducts iris scanning in-person at these centers. There are Orbs in several large cities in Africa, Asia, Europe, South America and North America, including locations in New York and California. Check out Orb locations here.\n\n3 steps for Worldcoin To complete the Worldcoin process, there are three steps: Download World App. Users can create a Worldcoin account and obtain a crypto wallet called WalletConnect to link to other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, and more conventional currencies, such as stablecoins. WalletConnect also works with social media apps, such as Instagram and X.\n\nUsers can create a Worldcoin account and obtain a crypto wallet called WalletConnect to link to other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, and more conventional currencies, such as stablecoins. WalletConnect also works with social media apps, such as Instagram and X. Sign up for World ID. Users can use World App without the World ID, but they cannot get the free share of Worldcoin tokens without visiting a Worldcoin Operator center and scanning their iris with the Orb to verify identity.\n\nUsers can use World App without the World ID, but they cannot get the free share of Worldcoin tokens without visiting a Worldcoin Operator center and scanning their iris with the Orb to verify identity. Receive a free share of Worldcoin and other digital currencies. A person can use their World ID in World App to get their free Bitcoin and Ethereum airdrops after confirming their distinct identity. In countries where Worldcoin tokens are available, users enter their World ID to claim their free tokens.\n\nUser privacy concerns There have been concerns from both regulators and privacy advocates with the collection of Worldcoin's data, including users' informed agreement to having one business handle all their data. According to Worldcoin, its project is entirely confidential since the biometric data is either erased or stored in an encrypted format. There are concerns that the iris scans will be available to purchase on the black market, enabling people to gain access to Worldcoin accounts."

        "title": "Is Bitcoin (BSV) a Security? - CoinGeek",
        "content": "To read full Legal Opinion Click Here.\n\nInternational law firm Buffone Law Group has issued guidance to the Ayre Ventures that the original protocol of Bitcoin as represented by BSV blockchain is likely not a security under U.S. law.\n\nThe advice was no doubt sought out of prudence following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) barrage of enforcement actions against the listing of illegal digital asset securities. SEC Chair Gary Gensler had signalled that such enforcement was around the corner back in September, when he warned that the \u2018vast majority\u2019 of digital assets on exchanges were securities. Buffone had earlier issued advice that Ethereum 2.0 amounted to a security, reflecting increasing recognition by the private sector and regulators that many digital assets previously thought to not be securities do in fact meet the definition.\n\nIndeed, as the memo points out, the SEC doubled the size of its digital assets enforcement division in May 2022 and highlights that the SEC has brought at least 99 enforcement actions against digital asset companies.\n\nIn the midst of this, the advice says:\n\n\u201cOne truth remains: that Bitcoin is not a security. However today there exists a dispute over what that original Bitcoin is\u2026 BSV, which is based upon the original Bitcoin protocol and committed to keeping that protocol static, is clearly not a security.\u201d\n\n\u201cOther versions of bitcoin, including Bitcoin Core (BTC), have changed their underlying protocol, necessitating ongoing developer intervention and promotion, that raise questions about whether these digital assets have transformed into securities. Only BSV, which has remained unchanged and consistent with the original Bitcoin White Paper since bitcoin first launched in 2009, does not face these risks.\u201d\n\nBitcoin as represented by BSV blockchain does not meet the Howey test\n\nThe memo goes over the latest status of the Howey test as it applies to digital assets. Howey is a long standing-legal precedent which establishes the test for whether a given asset offering amounts to an investment contract under the U.S. securities legislation and therefore is a security.\n\nUnder Howey, an investment contract exists if there is:\n\nAn investment of money; In a common enterprise; With a reasonable expectation of profits based upon the efforts of others\n\nThere is an investment of money. This prong of Howey will almost always be met. The test does not require investment of fiat \u2013 merely an exchange of value \u201cwhich includes not only fiat money but also digital tokens and even goods and services,\u201d according to the memo.\n\nIn a common enterprise. Some dispute has arisen over what constitutes a common enterprise, and courts are generally split between requiring \u2018vertical commonality\u2019 (meaning commonality of interest between the investor and the promoter) and \u2018horizontal commonality\u2019 (meaning commonality between investors).\n\nReasonable expectation of profits based on the efforts of others. This is the prong of the Howey test which gets the most attention in the digital assets\u2019 context.\n\nWhere an issuer has privatized their ledger and the utility of the underlying coin is required to give the asset continuing value, that has the effect of making the purchasers reliant upon the issuer for the asset\u2019s value, likely fulfilling this prong of the Howey test. \u201cAccordingly,\u201d says the memo, \u201ca touchstone for finding whether profit is expected from the effort of the promoter or third party is whether the blockchain underlying the digital asset is privatised.\u201d\n\nThis point has been the subject of new developments in the courts.\n\nThe court in the highly-publicized case of SEC v Ripple Labs recently analyzed whether Ripple\u2019s sale of XRP to various buyers fell afoul of Howey. Under this third prong, it found that only sales to institutional buyers met the Howey test; programmatic sales (i.e., public buyers on exchanges) did not because the buyers could not reasonably expect that Ripple would use the money to increase the value of XRP because the buyers could not have known their money was going to Ripple or some other seller of the asset.\n\nThough that decision was greeted with much applause from Ripple and XRP\u2019s many bagholders, it was quickly diminished by subsequent decisions. On July 31, a court with equal authority to the one in Ripple issued a decision in the SEC\u2019s case against Terraform Labs and its founder Do Kwon which expressly disagreed with the conclusion in Ripple. He said:\n\n\u201cThat a purchaser has bought the coins directly from the defendants or, instead, a secondary re-sale transaction has no impact on whether a reasonable individual would objectively view the defendant\u2019s actions and statements as evincing a promise of profits based on their efforts.\u201d\n\nYesterday August 9th, the SEC filed a letter of intent to request an interlocutory appeal to Judge Torres\u2019s July 13th summary judgement in the Ripple case.\n\nWhat this means for Bitcoin\n\nBuffone\u2019s memo sets the starting point for considering whether Bitcoin is a security: it highlights a speech given by SEC Chairman Jay Clayton in 2018 where he said that Bitcoin does not qualify as a security because it functions as a replacement for currency.\n\n\u201cIn other words,\u201d reads the memo, \u201cChairman Clayton reasoned that any digital currency whose primary function is to serve as a substitute for fiat currency would not qualify as a security.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, a speech given by former SEC Director of the Division of Corporation Finance William Hinman made the point that Bitcoin is not a security under the Howey test and \u201cin large part focused on how the distinction between a decentralized technology and central promoters driving a blockchain can create the distinction between a commodity and security,\u201d reads the memo.\n\nAdditionally, as recently as July 2022, current SEC Gary Gensler has reiterated that Bitcoin is not a security.\n\nWhich begs the question: what is Bitcoin? The memo describes Bitcoin as \u201ca direct-exchange (or user-to-user) network through which participants may send other participants bitcoins without the need for any intermediary. The Bitcoin system is comprised of 21 million coins that are designated as bitcoins and which each includes 100 million fungible, indivisible digital tokens known as satoshis. The Bitcoin protocol uses digital signatures, hashing algorithms that publish data in clear text, and a distributed network of nodes to control the management of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe definition of Bitcoin comes from the white paper, which unambiguously describes a system of electronic cash.\n\nIn the early days when Bitcoin initially adhered to this definition, it traded under the ticker BTC. However, the memo points out that several years into Bitcoin\u2019s development a group of developers seized control of the protocol and made fundamental changes to it, including the Segregated Witness (SegWit) update in August 2016, which removed all signature data from Bitcoin transactions and put them in a separate structure. This change was intended to enable the Lightning Network, \u201ca software that could now run on top of the new protocol and created a separate network which no longer has the characteristics of a blockchain and takes advantage of the separation from the blockchain to limit the traceability of transactions.\u201d\n\nAnother update, Taproot, \u201chad the intended outcome of making it harder to audit transactions and potentially allow for the anonymous use of BTC.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese changes moved away from the digital asset concept of the Bitcoin protocol towards a cryptocurrency concept that would allow for anonymous and untraceable transactions. Because SegWit introduced a new protocol that was incompatible with the Bitcoin protocol, new coins that complied with the new and changed protocol had to be issued.\u201d (emphasis added)\n\nBSV would eventually restore the original Bitcoin protocol\u2014and unlike BTC, the underlying protocol has been left untouched.\n\nThis distinction, says the memo, is key to understanding why Bitcoin as represented by BSV blockchain is not a security, while BTC very likely is. As referenced by both the Howey test and the SEC, centralized management of a blockchain is one of the key ingredients used to determine whether a digital asset is a security:\n\n\u201cFirst, centralized management often can bolster an argument that a common enterprise exists. Further, centralized management, which almost always is financially motivated, bolsters an argument an expectation of profit exists.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy taking a static and immutable protocol and implementing changes developed, advocated for, and implemented by a core group of developers with an obvious financial interest in BTC, BTC has opened itself to the argument that it has changed what was once a commodity into a security.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn short, as the SEC says, it is not enough to say you are not a duck. Merely claiming to be bitcoin will not save a coin that transforms into a security.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, the BSV blockchain had not deviated from the original Bitcoin protocol. The memo cites BSV blockchain\u2019s suitability as a platform for everyday transactions, the original vision for Bitcoin: \u201cBSV transactions are processed in a matter of seconds compared to between 10 minutes and up to 1 hour for BTC.\u201d It also points to BSV blockchain\u2019s average transaction fee of less than 1/1000 of a cent compared to BTC\u2019s average fee of around $7.25. Both these factors are reflected in the fact that BSV blockchain\u2019s daily transaction volume is over 2,500,000 per day with peaks of up to 50,000,000\u2014compared with just 450,000 per day for BTC.\n\nFurther, the memo says that the following factors weight strongly in favor of BSV\u2019s status as a commodity rather than a security:\n\nDid not do pre-mining\n\nHad no new issuance, reissuance, a secondary offering and/or airdropping in its lifetime\n\nIs based on genuine proof-of-work\n\nHas a locked base protocol according to the law\n\nIn other words: \u201cBSV does not walk like a duck nor quack like one.\u201d\n\nIn closing, the memo says that while the SEC\u2019s enforcement approach is evolving quickly, there remains one constant: Bitcoin is not a security.\n\n\u201cThe safest way to ensure any cryptocurrency is not a security is to ensure it stays true to the original Bitcoin protocol as envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto. That protocol was static and immutable. BSV is the only cryptocurrency utilizing that same static and immutable protocol. Meanwhile, those cryptocurrencies moving away from Nakamoto\u2019s original vision and protocol, as in the case of BTC \u2013 are increasingly at risk of securitization and being subject to SEC oversight.\u201d\n\nTo read full Legal Opinion Click Here.\n\nLondon Blockchain Conference 2023 AMA: Bitcoin at scale is all about micropayments\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

Two weeks ago, the American platform Hulu marked the return of the cult series with the broadcast of \u201cThe Impossible Stream\u201d. This was followed by \u201cChildren of a Lesser Bog\u201d and \u201cHow the West Was 101001\u201d, all about bitcoin, cryptos and NFT.\n\nBitcoin, a star in Futurama season 11\n\nMatt Groening hasn\u2019t breathed his last. The man who created The Simpsons, a series featuring such predictions as the election of Donald Trump as POTUS and the $589 ATH for XRP, is still making waves.\n\nAs early as the first quarter of 2023, the press echoed the return of Futurama after a 10-year hiatus. If the latest news is to be believed, Hulu kept its promise by broadcasting \u201cThe Impossible Stream\u201d on its platform and Disney+ on July 24.\n\nNEW \u2013 The latest episode of Futurama features #Bitcoin\n\n\n\n\u201cThe virtual money is soaring once again. Leading to a high tech gold rush.\u201d\n\npic.twitter.com/5ICYmyvkrR \u2014 Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 8, 2023 Bitcoin takes the stage in Futurama\n\nAccording to Cointelegraph, episode 3 of Futurama season 11 tackles the subject of bitcoin. Except that in the episode \u201cHow the West Was 1010001\u201d, BTC miners are mocked.\n\nHere\u2019s the story: Futurama\u2019s main characters (Fry, Leela, Bender, Amy, Hermes and co.) are saddled with debt. The robot mafia forces them to travel west to Crypto Country.\n\nThis adventure exposes them to other constraints that currently prevail in the real world. Among them: the environmental challenges of bitcoin, which cannot be separated from the high demand for materials such as thallium (in the series).\n\nIn Futurama\u2019s literal Wild West, the quest for \u201ccheap, dirty electricity\u201d is part of everyday life. The aim: to extract blocks of BTC.\n\nThis third episode, released on August 6, also highlights bitcoin\u2019s ongoing volatility. In the year 3023, i.e. in 1,000 years\u2019 time, the queen of cryptocurrencies will still not lose its volatile nature.\n\nOther cryptos in the spotlight\n\nDogecoin also got the red carpet in How the West Was 101001. Collider reports that Elon Musk\u2019s favorite memecoin occupies a very important place in Crypto Contry\u2019s Wild West.\n\nIn fact, Futurama granted a scene featuring Fry\u2019s team aboard a covered wagon entering \u201cDoge City\u201d. As they set foot in this crypto city, Professor Farnsworth was quick to extol the virtues of cryptocurrencies. He even tested the \u201cpricelessly toxic Thallium\u201d through his teeth.\n\nIn this sequence, the team was confronted with the difficulties of cryptocurrency mining: anarchy, volatility, insecurity, etc. No one reached out to them. The only prospector they spoke to was on a mission to reduce the population of Crypto Country. He died of a heart attack after achieving his goal.\n\nInterviewed by The Economic Times, Claudia Katz promised 20 episodes for Futurama season 11. And this is only the 3rd episode, with the 4th to be released on August 14.\n\nFuture Futurama releases are sure to touch on cancel culture, Covid-19, Bitcoin and NFTs.\n\nThe Futurama producer also mentioned in this interview that the war against Covid-19 won\u2019t end until 3023. This justifies the existence of an episode on vaccines. This reminds us of an alternative disavowed by the Canadian truckers behind Freedom Convoy.

        "title": "The Mating of Economic Ideas and Bitcoin - AIER - Daily Economy News",
        "content": "In an effort to better understand the intellectual foundations of what eventually came to be known as Bitcoin, we have thus far explored those of the competition in currency proposed by economist FA Hayek and the idea of building a \u201cGalt\u2019s Gulch in Cyberspace\u201d (an adaptation from Ayn Rand\u2019s novel Atlas Shrugged). We then explored the anarchic roots from David D. Friedman \u2014 with important inputs from science fiction authors Robert Heinlein and Vernor Vinge. Each of these individuals was explicitly cited at least once by Timothy C. May who managed the Cypherpunk mailing list throughout the 1990s, where he built the case for some combination of online markets powered by strong encryption, a globally-interconnected public, an internet currency of sorts that would facilitate trade \u2013 and all capable of existing in a state of anarchy.\n\nBut to understand further, we must explore the intellectual influences that economists Lawrence H. White and George Selgin had on at least two of the more prominent Cypherpunks: namely Nick Szabo and Hal Finney.\n\nNick Szabo is the man responsible for engineering a couple of the attempts at an internet-native, privately-issued currency before Bitcoin: \u2018The God Protocols\u2019 (1999) and \u2018bit gold\u2019 (2005, now considered a direct precursor to Bitcoin). Hal Finney launched his own attempt in 2004 called \u2018Reusable Proofs of Work\u2019 (RPOW). None of these attempts at a digital currency was actually programmed up to a finished product; they were merely conceptualized in writing and (in RPOW\u2019s case) minimal amounts of code. Despite neither Szabo nor Finney being cited in the Bitcoin whitepaper, Satoshi later stated that Bitcoin was an implementation of Szabo\u2019s \u2018bit gold\u2019 (along with Wei Dai\u2019s \u2018b-money\u2019). As for Finney, he also happened to be the first recipient of a bitcoin transaction, from Satoshi himself, and famously tweeted \u201cRunning bitcoin\u201d on January 11th, 2009 \u2013 just eight days after Bitcoin went live. In sum, both Szabo and Finney made significant contributions to the evolution of ideas that inevitably led to what we now refer to as Bitcoin.\n\nBut to build a sound and scalable digital currency, one must not merely possess expertise in programming and cryptography. One must also understand what makes a good money in the first place. Szabo\u2019s blog \u201cUnenumerated\u201d takes a deep dive into the history of money (among many other topics), and a widely-read piece of his (among bitcoiners and the like) \u201cShelling Out\u201d contains references to the 19th century economist Carl Menger, who wrote about the spontaneous emergence of money. But interestingly, Szabo and Finney had also studied the work of Lawrence H. White and George Selgin.\n\nWhite and Selgin\u2019s influences on prominent Cypherpunks\n\nOne common research focus across the careers of White and Selgin is competition in currency, a theme pioneered by FA Hayek during the high inflation years of the 1970s, with his important book on the topic: The Denationalisation of Money.\n\nIn the 1990s, White and Finney had a friendly debate of ideas back-and-forth via three published articles in Extropy magazine. Finney argued in a 1993 article that the internet would enable the possibility of an internet native currency (not backed by fiat or goods in the real world); White replied in 1995 that he was skeptical, arguing the difficulty of getting away from the network effect of fiat currencies; Finney responded in kind in 1996.\n\nIn 2010, Finney referred to Selgin\u2019s 1988 book The Theory of Free Banking as one of his own influences in the so-called \u201cBitcoin Forum\u201d, a platform for discussion for early bitcoiners. \u201cGeorge Selgin has worked out the theory of competitive free banking in detail\u201d, Finney wrote, \u201cand he argues that such a system would be stable, inflation resistant and self-regulating.\u201d\n\nIn an appearance on Peter McCormack\u2019s What Bitcoin Did podcast in 2019, Szabo credits both White and Selgin for shaping his own thinking, explaining that:\n\n\u201cI was doing research on the history of money and working my way backwards, part of the history of money was private banking, where private banks would issue money, IOUs, bank notes and George Selgin and Larry White were the main people I read on that one. That was inspiring, but then you read later how it failed and it got usurped by central banks and then later on, maybe 100, 200 years later, the central banks get turned into fiat currency.\u201d\n\nBeyond the Cypherpunk mailing list, White and Selgin were all participants of a separate private mailing list with some of the prominent Cypherpunks called \u2018Libtech\u2019 in the late-1990s. Szabo recounts about the Libtech experience that \u201cmyself, Wei Dai, Hal Finney, Larry White, George Selgin and a few others were on a mailing list I created called Libtech and that\u2019s where I came up with Bitgold [sic], and Wei Dai came up with b-money, and we had great discussions on there.\u201d\n\nIn a 2019 Twitter thread, Szabo also credited both White and Selgin on both Finney\u2019s and his own thinking about how a free banking system might work under a Bitcoin standard, suggesting that Layer 2 technologies such as the Lightning Network provide a more trust-minimized way of achieving it.\n\nWhite and Selgin on Bitcoin\n\nBoth White and Selgin critique Bitcoin from different angles. With White, the ideal money is one with a stable purchasing power (a point repeatedly emphasized by Hayek), while Selgin\u2019s ideal money \u201cwould stabilize nominal spending\u201d (he tells me by email) \u201cwhile allowing the price level to vary with changes in the state of total factor productivity.\u201d\n\nIn White\u2019s new book Better Money: Gold, Fiat, or Bitcoin?, he writes that \u201c[because Bitcoin\u2019s] supply curve is vertical, the impact of demand shifts is entirely on price and not at all on quantity. In this respect purchasing-power volatility is baked into Bitcoin\u2019s design.\u201d He goes on to say that \u201cmy own view is that the volatility of Bitcoin\u2019s purchasing power makes its widespread use as a medium of exchange very unlikely\u2026 but only time will tell.\u201d\n\nSelgin calls Bitcoin a \u201csynthetic commodity money\u201d meaning that, like fiat, any non-monetary use is less obvious, but like a commodity it \u201cis naturally or inevitably scarce.\u201d (He considers \u201cmere investment use\u201d to be non-monetary). He also argues that the advantage of a synthetic commodity money \u201cis precisely that by resorting to it one can avoid leaving the management of money either to central bankers or to the blind forces of nature. Instead, supply is determined once and for all by artificially arranged resource constraints.\u201d He goes on to say that a \u201csynthetic commodity monetary regime might perform better than either existing fiat money regimes or than potential commodity money alternatives\u201d but emphasizes the unlikeliness of any government to adopt such a regime.\n\nIn 1989, White suggested the possibility of a monetary policy with a predetermined supply schedule, applying a solution proposed by Ronald Coase to the \u201cassurance problem.\u201d As explained in White\u2019s new book, to understand the Coasean assurance problem, we can think of potential buyers that may be hesitant to purchase, say, artwork from an artist in the present, knowing that the artist can still later reproduce copies of the artwork and sell at a lower price to future buyers, yet at a price still above the artist\u2019s marginal cost of production. One solution to calm potential buyers would be for the artist to number each piece of artwork (#7 of 100, etc.). Satoshi built a similar quantity commitment into Bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy. White writes that \u201cDespite recognizing, many years before the introduction of Bitcoin, that a quantity commitment device could in principle solve the Coasean assurance problem for a free-market irredeemable money, [\u2026] I did not foresee that the device could or would in practice be used to successfully launch a medium of exchange.\u201d\n\nHowever, in a presentation given to the Center for Market Education in Malaysia, White does concede that Bitcoin\u2019s purchasing power volatility could dampen if its use as a medium of exchange would increase substantially as such use would mean less volatile demand. He also points out that banking on a Bitcoin standard would go a long way to help.\n\nConclusion\n\nLawrence H. White and George Selgin\u2019s career-long efforts to understand better money ultimately served as contributions to the climate of ideas that inevitably shaped the thinking of at least two of the most prominent Cypherpunks \u2013 Nick Szabo and Hal Finney \u2013 who worked to make something like Bitcoin a reality in the first place.\n\nWhether Bitcoin\u2019s volatility will remain a stumbling block in the way of its eventual widespread adoption as a medium of exchange remains to be seen. As Bitcoin is a highly decentralized and an antifragile system with no real-world backed assets that can be seized to shut it down, and as it has already reached a fair bit of scale globally, it (to me) appears to be the only realistic candidate to (by \u201csly roundabout way\u201d, as Hayek proposed) introduce something that government cannot stop. As such, volatility may be the price we pay to win the long game.\n\n\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: I have chapter 5 of Professor White\u2019s book Better Money to thank for alerting me to several of the sources referenced in this article."

After that, it fell steadily to $3100 in December 2018,\u201d he explained during the interview.\n\nIn the end, it was a discussion with Wences Casares that was decisive in his choice. Casares told him that bitcoin (BTC) could be worth $100,000, or even $1 million. However, what convinced him most was the blockchain technology underpinning bitcoin.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I believe less in Bitcoin (BTC), but more in blockchain technologies, \u2026 And I believe that new technologies can destroy the current banking system, including central banks,\u201d he added.\n\nThis choice reflects Faber\u2019s investment philosophy, which favors assets outside the traditional banking system. This approach is in line with the ideas of the crypto community, which is also looking to escape conventional monetary policies.\n\nDoes he still own his BTC?\n\nIt\u2019s entirely possible that he still owns the bitcoins (BTC) he acquired in 2019. Since this announcement, the Swiss billionaire has not communicated publicly on his BTC position.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) chart \u2013 source: TradingView\n\nA look at the BTC chart on TradingView shows that Marc Faber\u2019s BTC portfolio is currently up 660%. During the interview with Cash, he did not specify the exact quantity of bitcoins he had purchased.\n\nHowever, Faber is certainly one of the best-timed investors. Indeed, his sense of timing proved exceptional, as the price of bitcoin (BTC) never fell below its purchase price (around $3800).\n\nWhat if Xapo CEO Casares\u2019 predictions prove to be right, with Bitcoin (BTC) reaching $1 million? Only time will tell.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program! Earn points for each article you read and gain access to exclusive rewards.

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s short-lived breakout lacks momentum\n\nThe cryptocurrency markets saw a brief breakout yesterday, with the price of Bitcoin popping back above $30k for the first time in two weeks.\n\nThe market leader was unable to sustain the momentum and has since dropped back below the important level, where it\u2019s now been hovering for a number of weeks. Bitcoin was changing hands for around $29,800 this morning, up 2 per cent over the past 24 hours.\n\nElsewhere, Solana (SOL) and Toncoin (TON) both led the way with increases of 5 per cent since yesterday. Volatile memecoin Shiba INU has increased in price 10 per cent over the past day and 20 per cent over the week.\n\nAnalysts suggest the price moves could be linked to fresh concerns about the US banking following Moody\u2019s downgrade of ten mid-sized US banks, while long-time Bitcoin doom monger Peter Schiff cited the potentially-imminent SEC approval of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs \u2013 considered a game changer for the reputation of the industry and its acceptance as an asset class by traditional finance.\n\nYesterday\u2019s Crypto AM Daily\n\nIn the Markets\n\nThe Bitcoin Economy\n\n*Data can be found at https://terminal.bytetree.com/\n\n\ud83c\udf05Total crypto market cap\n\n\ud83d\udd35 $1.145 trillion\n\n\ud83d\udd3a 0.09%\n\nWhat Bitcoin did yesterday\n\n\ud83d\udd3a Daily high $30,176\n\n\ud83d\udd3b Daily low $29,113\n\nBitcoin market capitalisation\n\n\ud83d\udfe0 BTC $579.19 billion\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 Gold $12.932 trillion\n\n\ud83d\udcb3 Visa $501.16 billion\n\nBitcoin volume\n\n\ud83e\udea3 Total spot trading volume $21.772 billion\n\nSP500\n\n\ud83d\udd3a 0.35%\n\nFear and Greed Index\n\nBitcoin\u2019s market dominance\n\n\ud83d\udcca 50.61\n\nRelative Strength Index (RSI)\n\n\ud83d\udcaa 58\n\nValues of 70 or above indicate that an asset is becoming overbought and may be primed for a trend reversal or experience a correction in price, while 30 or below indicates an oversold or undervalued condition.\n\nWhat they said yesterday\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas to explain why #Bitcoin is up so much today? \u2014 Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) August 8, 2023\n\nWhether you\u2019re a Bitcoin expert or a total newbie \u2013 or even somewhere in between \u2013 you can now join the new HODLers Telegram community to learn more\u2026 or share your insights with others!\n\nOur goal is simple: to provide a safe place where people can ask any question they want about Bitcoin, even if they think it\u2019s a daft one!

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s monumental performance in recent years, as well as the increasing coverage of digital assets in the mainstream media, have attracted traders of all shapes and sizes looking to break into the world of cryptocurrency. While retail investors typically look to purchase modest amounts, you may want to purchase a large amount of Bitcoin in one go, which is where certain exchanges and OTC desks come in handy. By using one of these specialised services, you will be able to cut down on the costs involved compared to using a regular exchange.\n\nDisclaimer: This information should not be interpreted as an endorsement of cryptocurrency or any specific provider, service or offering. It is not a recommendation to trade.\n\nBefore going any further, it\u2019s important to consider what actually constitutes a large amount of bitcoin. Of course, the definition of \u201clarge\u201d will be different for everyone. A sizable trade for you will vary depending on factors like your income, net wealth, experience with digital currency and overall level of risk tolerance.\n\nHowever, for the purposes of this guide, we\u2019re talking about individual trades worth anywhere north of $10,000 and potentially into hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars.\n\nOptions for buying a large amount of bitcoin\n\nThe two main options when buying a lot of bitcoin are to either purchase through a traditional cryptocurrency exchange or to use an over-the-counter (OTC) exchange. Each type of platform has its pros and cons, so let\u2019s take a closer look at which one might be right for you.\n\nLarge transactions on traditional cryptocurrency exchanges: pros and cons\n\nTraditional exchanges offer a simple and straightforward way for their customers to buy bitcoin and other crypto coins. These centralised platforms allow buyers and sellers to trade cryptocurrencies based on current market prices, with the exchange acting as an intermediary between the two parties. Examples of such exchanges include Binance, CoinSpot and Coinbase.\n\nYou register for an account, deposit fiat or cryptocurrency to your trading balance, and then place an order to buy your desired number of coins. All buy and sell offers are listed in a publicly available order book.\n\nPros\n\nEasy to use. Traditional cryptocurrency exchanges are designed to make it simple and straightforward to buy coins and tokens. If you\u2019re new to the world of cryptocurrency, they\u2019re generally one of the easier ways to purchase coins and tokens.\n\nTraditional cryptocurrency exchanges are designed to make it simple and straightforward to buy coins and tokens.

This can help a new user enter the marketplace and start trading. Trade up to $100,000 per day. While transaction limits vary substantially between exchanges and can be based on your level of verification, some platforms will allow you to buy up to $50,000 or even $100,000 of bitcoin per day.\n\nAccess to a wide range of coins and tokens. The list of supported currencies varies from one exchange to the next, but many platforms allow you to go beyond bitcoin and trade an extensive selection of altcoins.\n\nCons\n\nTransaction and withdrawal limits. Traditional exchanges have much lower transaction and withdrawal limits than OTC exchanges. For example, if you\u2019re a new customer, you may be limited to a daily trading limit of $2,000 or $3,000. Furthermore, your options for withdrawing funds may be restricted or capped.\n\nTraditional exchanges have much lower transaction and withdrawal limits than OTC exchanges.

Raising transaction and withdrawal limits takes time. Many exchanges offer different transaction limits to their customers based on their level of verification, so you may need to provide additional personal details or proof of ID to raise your limit. Other platforms will only allow you to trade larger amounts once you\u2019ve been a customer for a specified period of time or only if you\u2019re a frequent trader.\n\nMany exchanges offer different transaction limits to their customers based on their level of verification, so you may need to provide additional personal details or proof of ID to raise your limit.

As cryptocurrency markets are still in their infancy and there are hundreds of exchanges to choose from, there may not be sufficient liquidity on your chosen platform to fulfil a large trade in one transaction. When this happens, your transaction will be split into several smaller trades and could lead to slippage.\n\nAs cryptocurrency markets are still in their infancy and there are hundreds of exchanges to choose from, there may not be sufficient liquidity on your chosen platform to fulfil a large trade in one transaction.

Slippage occurs when the market moves against you before your trade can be completed, resulting in the total cost of the transaction being more expensive than expected. It is often associated with large orders that take longer than usual to fill.\n\nSlippage occurs when the market moves against you before your trade can be completed, resulting in the total cost of the transaction being more expensive than expected. It is often associated with large orders that take longer than usual to fill. Risk of hacking and theft. Storing funds in an exchange wallet for any length of time exposes you to the risk of hacking and theft. There have been dozens of well-publicised examples of crypto exchanges falling victim to hacks, which is particularly worrying for anyone looking to spend a large amount.\n\nTraditional exchanges compared\n\nWhich traditional cryptocurrency exchanges are well set up to support large trading amounts? Check out the brief reviews below for more details on the transaction and withdrawal limits that apply on a selection of popular exchanges, as well as the steps you\u2019ll need to complete to access those limits. All figures quoted are accurate at the time of writing (27 April 2018).\n\nBinance\n\nBinance is a crypto-only exchange that allows you to buy and sell dozens of digital currencies. While there\u2019s no limit on the amount you can deposit into your Binance account, the standard 24-hour withdrawal limit on a basic account is 2 BTC. You can upgrade this to 100 BTC by providing your name, gender, nationality and proof of ID. If you\u2019d like to upgrade to an even higher withdrawal limit, you can contact Binance support directly.\n\nBinance review\n\nBTC Markets\n\nBTC Markets provides its users with access to bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ether (ETH), Ethereum Classic (ETC), Ripple (XRP) and Litecoin (LTC), and it allows you to purchase digital currency with Australian dollars. The standard limits that apply on BTC Markets are as follows:\n\nBPAY deposit: $2,000\n\nAUD withdrawal: $8,000\n\nCrypto deposit: $100,000\n\nCrypto withdrawal: $50,000\n\nHowever, you can apply for increased limits by providing the reason for the increase, specifying your occupation and entering your website or social media profile.\n\nBTC Markets review\n\nCoinSpot\n\nMelbourne-based exchange CoinSpot limits BPAY deposits to $1,000 per 24-hour period and online bank transfer deposits to $10,000 per 24-hour period. If you want to deposit cash at a newsagent, a limit of $1,000 per 24-hour period applies.\n\nA $5,000 trading limit applies to sell orders, while the maximum buy order is $20,000.\n\nCoinSpot doesn\u2019t have any withdrawal limits, but you\u2019ll need to verify your account before you can withdraw any funds. Verification is only available for Australian residents with an Australian contact number and bank account. You can verify your identity by submitting proof of ID, proof of address and a photo of yourself holding a handwritten statement\n\nBTC Markets review\n\nKraken\n\nFounded in 2011, Kraken is a digital currency exchange designed to suit serious traders. Its deposit and withdrawal limits vary depending on the level of verification you achieve. It supports a range of fiat currencies like US dollars (USD), Canadian dollars (CAD), euros (EUR), and Japanese yen (JPY).\n\nKraken account levels Account tier Daily limits Monthly limits Requirements Tier 0 N/A (deposits and withdrawals not available) N/A (deposits and withdrawals not available) Account signup Tier 1 Deposit (fiat): $0 Deposit (crypto): No limit Withdraw (fiat): $0 Withdraw (crypto): $2,500 Deposit (fiat): $0 Deposit (crypto): No limit Withdraw (fiat): $0 Withdraw (crypto): $20,000 Full name Date of birth Country of residence Phone number Tier 2 Deposit (fiat): $2,000 Deposit (crypto): No limit Withdraw (fiat): $2,000 Withdraw (crypto): $5,000 Deposit (fiat): $10,000 Deposit (crypto): No limit Withdraw (fiat): $10,000 Withdraw (crypto): $50,000 Provide all Tier 1 information Verify your address Tier 3 Deposit (fiat): $25,000 Deposit (crypto): No limit Withdraw (fiat): $25,000 Withdraw (crypto): $50,000 Deposit (fiat): $200,000 Deposit (crypto): No limit Withdraw (fiat): $200,000 Withdraw (crypto): $200,000 Meet all tier 1 and tier 2 requirements Government-issued ID Proof of residence ID confirmation photo Tier 4 Deposit (fiat): $100,000 Deposit (crypto): No limit Withdraw (fiat): $100,000 Withdraw (crypto): $100,000 Deposit (fiat): $500,000 Deposit (crypto): No limit Withdraw (fiat): $500,000 Withdraw (crypto): $500,000 Contact Kraken support to request tier 4 limits\n\n\n\nHuobi\n\nHuobi is a crypto-to-crypto exchange platform that allows its users to trade more than 190 currency pairs. It imposes limits on the maximum amount you can buy and sell per transaction, and those limits vary depending on the currency pair you choose. For example, the following limits apply if trading ETH/BTC:\n\nMaximum amount of limit order: 10,000\n\nMaximum buy of market order: 1,000\n\nMaximum sell of market order: 10,000\n\nThere\u2019s also a currency-specific limit on the maximum amount you can withdraw on your account per transaction. If your account is verified, you can withdraw a maximum of 200 BTC, 2,000 ETH or 5,000 LTC.\n\nHoubi review\n\nLarge transactions on OTC exchanges: pros and cons\n\nOTC trading refers to any cryptocurrency trading that takes place away from conventional crypto exchanges. While trades can be arranged peer-to-peer using online chat rooms like #bitcoin-otc, recent years have seen the emergence of an increasing number of OTC brokers. These brokers specialise in helping large-volume traders buy and sell substantial amounts of cryptocurrency and avoiding slippage.\n\nPros\n\nBetter value for money. OTC brokers can offer a higher level of liquidity than conventional exchanges, which means that they can help you access one single price for a buy order. This removes the risk of slippage and means a lower total transaction cost.\n\nOTC brokers can offer a higher level of liquidity than conventional exchanges, which means that they can help you access one single price for a buy order.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) investors and enthusiasts are bracing themselves for a potential seismic shift in the cryptocurrency landscape, as a prominent analyst warns that the post-2024 Bitcoin halving could usher in a \u201cmajor bear market.\u201d\n\nCrediBULL Crypto has stirred the crypto community with his recent analysis, suggesting that the upcoming halving event might not be the catalyst for a bull run, as many expect.\n\nBitcoin halving events, which occur roughly every four years, have long been closely watched by investors due to their historical impact on the cryptocurrency\u2019s price trajectory. The halving mechanism is built into the cryptocurrency\u2019s code and reduces the block reward miners receive by half.\n\nThis scarcity-driven event often leads to supply shocks and, historically, has sparked significant price rallies. The previous halvings were indeed followed by remarkable bull runs. However, CrediBULL Crypto suggests a paradigm shift may be on the horizon.\n\nBitcoin Bull Market Peak\n\nCrediBULL Crypto\u2019s analysis challenges the conventional narrative surrounding BTC halving cycles. While many have considered the halving events as the starting point of new bull cycles, CrediBULL argues that the post-2024 halving might mark the peak of the ongoing bull market cycle, which he posits began in 2018 when Bitcoin was priced at $3,000.\n\nWhy the next $BTC halving in April/May 2024 will likely mark our bull cycle TOP rather than the \u201cstart\u201d like many are expecting and why we will likely be in the depths of a MAJOR bear market by 2025: I\u2019ve previously explained that the amount of time we are spending\u2026 pic.twitter.com/lQrGSo4rRs \u2014 CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) August 10, 2023\n\nThis alternative timeline implies that the cryptocurrency is still within a prolonged bull market, and he anticipates a higher price peak than the previous record of $69,000 in November 2021.\n\nCrediBULL\u2019s assertion is grounded in his interpretation of historical data, raising intriguing questions about the cyclical nature of Bitcoin\u2019s price movements and the broader factors influencing its trajectory.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 #Bitcoin $BTC Amount of HODLed or Lost Coins just reached a 5-year high of 7,803,692.388 BTC View metric:https://t.co/dJK8rxBVD3 pic.twitter.com/vb4dTp2Ezp \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) August 9, 2023\n\nHODLers Unfazed Amid Uncertainty\n\nAs the debate over Bitcoin\u2019s future intensifies, recent data from Glassnode provides a nuanced perspective. The amount of \u201cHODLed\u201d or lost Bitcoin, those coins held tightly by long-term investors, has surged to a new five-year high, reaching 7.8 million Bitcoins.\n\nThis phenomenon suggests that a significant portion of Bitcoin holders remains undeterred by market fluctuations, choosing to retain their investments rather than capitulating amid potential uncertainty.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) retains position in the $29k territory. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nEnduring Market Sentiment\n\nBitcoin stands at $29,415.22 via CoinGecko, with a minor 0.3% decline in the past 24 hours, and a modest 0.9% rise over the last seven days. Nevertheless, the resilience displayed by committed HODLers may hint at a more complex and enduring market sentiment.\n\nAs the crypto community ponders the potential implications of the post-2024 halving, CrediBULL Crypto\u2019s contrarian perspective challenges the prevailing wisdom and underscores the need for ongoing scrutiny of the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nInvestors are left to contemplate whether this forecasted bear market will materialize, or if the crypto market\u2019s resilience will once again defy expectations.\n\nFeatured image from Lenexa Manufacturing"

        "title": "Bitcoin miners underwater as BTC mining difficulty surges - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Difficulty adjustment on Bitcoin (BTC) mining is a protocol feature created by Satoshi Nakamoto that serves to keep an average interval of 10 minutes between every new block that is discovered by Bitcoin miners, filled with transactions, and then added to the blockchain. This adjustment directly impacts mining profitability, as increased difficulty also means increased costs for the activity.\n\nWith a sustained increase in mining difficulty over time, Bitcoin miners are working \u2018underwater,\u2019 as the average cost to mine one single BTC has been superior to the average price of 1 BTC in the spot market year-over-year since August 2022.\n\nThe average mining cost is calculated by Cambridge University and plotted in a chart by MacroMicro. On August 8, it registered an average cost of $34,835 per mined BTC, against a spot price of $29,902 on August 9 \u2014 accounting for a loss of $4,933 per unit of the leading cryptocurrency produced coins.\n\nBitcoin Average Mining Costs. Sources: MacroMicro and Cambridge University\n\nThe highest average cost registered in the 1-year period was $49,415 on July 17, versus a price of $30,145/BTC on the same day, for a loss of around $19,270 per mined BTC.\n\nExcept for a few single-day deviations on the chart, Bitcoin miners were mostly mining underwater, according to the presented data. This makes mining businesses hedge their position with financial products such as energy futures contracts.\n\nThe entities that suffer the most are small and medium Bitcoin miners who can\u2019t keep a profitable activity, losing market share and hashrate share for bigger miners \u2014 in a sort of economy of scale dynamic.\n\nThe most recent difficulty adjustment comes amid an energy crisis in Texas, one of the most prominent hubs for Bitcoin mining in the world, as reported by CBS News. Making energy even costier than before.\n\nBitcoin mining difficulty adjusted to 52.39 trillion\n\nThe block height 802368 was confirmed on August 9 with a positive adjustment of 0.10% on mining difficulty. It now requires 52.39 trillion hashes to a block to be considered valid.\n\nOn June 11 (block 798336), the difficulty was adjusted to an all-time high of 53.91 trillion (+6.45%), followed by a retrace on July 26 (block 800352) to 52.33 trillion hashes (-2.94%), which still holds this metric above historical data.\n\nDifficulty adjustments are directly correlated with hashrate dynamics. The more proof-of-work (PoW) that is being computed by Bitcoin miners \u2014 measured by hashrate \u2014 the higher the chances that one of these miners will find a valid block in an interval lower than 10 minutes. Also valid for the opposite direction, when less hashrate on the network also means longer times between blocks.\n\nWhat is the mining difficulty and how does it work\n\nMining through the proof-of-work system was the method chosen to secure the Bitcoin network and distribute new BTC to entities providing work and resources to the activity.\n\nTo guarantee a programmed distribution up to the maximum limit of 21 million, guaranteeing a controlled inflation of the BTC circulating supply, the Bitcoin protocol uses algorithms that help to keep the creation of a new block (with the corresponding payment of its reward) every about 10 minutes.\n\nThis algorithm works by adjusting mining difficulty. Evaluating the frequency of discovering new blocks over the last 2,015 blocks \u2014 about two weeks, assuming 10 minutes per block.\n\nIf the last 2,015 blocks are being mined in an interval greater than the desired 10 minutes, the mining difficulty needs to decrease, making it easier to mine more blocks in a shorter amount of time. The reverse is also correct: increasing the mining difficulty if the last 2,015 blocks have been discovered in an interval of less than 10 minutes between each block.\n\nAlthough the adjustment is proportional to the computational power being used in the network, it cannot exceed four times the previous value. In case, the mining difficulty adjustment always needs to be less than 300%, in a raise; or less than 75%, in a reduction.\n\nThe mining difficulty is affected by including or removing the number of \u201czeros\u201d that must go to the left of the other random characters."

        "title": "Bitcoin price could go parabolic with this pattern formation - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Although the price movements of Bitcoin (BTC) in the past few weeks have not demonstrated any surprises, this might change in the following months, at least when taking into account the historical chart patterns that have preceded bullish runs on a couple of previous occasions.\n\nSpecifically, the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset could experience a parabolic movement with the bottom formation mimicking that from 2016 and 2020, according to an analysis shared by pseudonymous cryptocurrency expert Trader Tardigrade on August 9.\n\nBitcoin price patterns in 2016, 2020, and 2023. Source: Trader Tardigrade\n\nAs it happens, in 2016, Bitcoin first formed a bottom at $355, following the low of $200 in 2015, after which it proceeded to form another bottom at $452, followed by the $677 level, which served as a stepping stone for the parabolic run that culminated with $6,750 in 2018.\n\nIn 2020, a similar thing occurred, as the maiden crypto asset swept the lows at $5,350, formed the bottom at $8,850 during the summer, and then at $10,111, preceding the $12,941 level in late 2020, which subsequently led Bitcoin to an all-time high (ATH) of $69,000 in late 2021, according to the expert\u2019s chart.\n\nThis year, Bitcoin hit a low at $15,700, formed the bottom at $26,500, and looks to form another at around $31,220. If it continues to follow the 2016 and 2020 patterns, it could reach the $46,850 price level in 2024, which would become the foundation for the next parabolic run and potentially a new ATH above $200,000 sometime in 2025.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin was at press time trading at $29,480, indicating a drop of 0.97% on the day, as well as a 1.44% gain across the previous week but a 3.4% decline on its monthly chart, according to the most recent price data retrieved by Finbold on August 10.\n\nBitcoin 7-day price chart.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) briefly broke above the $30,000 threshold within the last 24 hours, defying declining stock prices and a strengthening US dollar. Still, its stay above this pivotal mark was short-lived, as the cryptocurrency quickly retreated to approximately $29,800.\n\nHowever, although the leading crypto is already trading in the green, a far greater move may be in the cards, according to a widely-used technical indicator.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin Bollinger Bands (BB) \u201care the narrowest they\u2019ve been on the weekly since October 2020,\u201d real-time chart provider Barchart noted on August 8.\n\nBitcoin Bollinger Bands trading in the narrowest range since October 2020. Source: Barcharts\n\nWhat does it indicate?\n\nBollinger Bands serve the purpose of gauging market volatility and detecting potential shifts in price direction. When these bands contract, they imply reduced market volatility, resulting in narrower price fluctuations.\n\nFurthermore, constricted Bollinger Bands can suggest a phase of consolidation or an absence of a distinct trend. Traders often view this as a prelude to an impending price breakout. As volatility rises, the bands expand, marking the emergence of a new trend or a substantial price movement.\n\nConversely, traders may also interpret tight Bollinger Bands as an indication of uncertainty or a period warranting careful consideration.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAt press time on August 9, BTC was trading at $29,774, up 2.17% on the last day.\n\nBTC 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nThe maiden cryptocurrency gained 1.15% over the past week while losing around 1.7% on a monthly basis.\n\nAs can be observed from the chart, the price of Bitcoin rose above $30,100 at one point in the past 24 hours, before retreating below this psychological threshold.\n\nThe upswing came despite a drop in equity prices and a surge in the US dollar. According to blockchain intelligence platform Santiment, Bitcoin transactions are witnessing the highest profit taking in about 3 weeks. Specifically, the ratio of profit-taking versus loss-taking currently stands at 2:1, data showed.\n\nMeanwhile, long-term average trading returns are back above 20%, after sliding below 18% earlier this month.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
