        "title": "Crypto Poses Significant Tax Problems\u2014and They Could Get Worse - International Monetary Fund",
        "content": "Crypto assets that can be used as instruments of payment have proliferated into more than 10,000 variants since the 2009 debut of Bitcoin, the first and still the largest. The bewildering speed with which they have developed and the pseudonymity they can provide have left tax systems playing catch up.\n\nIn a new paper, we discuss how governments can address the emerging challenges of taxing these crypto assets while its use is still limited so that they prevent a leakage in tax revenue and protect the integrity of the tax system.\n\nClassifying crypto\n\nViews of crypto assets are diverse and held with passion. The prospect of liberating financial transactions from oversight by governments and the involvement of financial institutions is a libertarian dream for some. El Salvador and the Central African Republic have gone so far as to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender.\n\nCritics, however, see crypto assets as not merely inherently worthless but a front for crime, scams, and gambling. They also point to their dizzying volatility. Bitcoin, for instance, soared from $200 a decade ago to nearly $70,000 in 2021 before plunging to around $29,000 today.\n\nThe collapse of FTX last year and recent US Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase have fed anxiety among users while the appeal to criminal activities has been reflected in high-profile seizures of billions of dollars. These developments have triggered increasing scrutiny from policymakers and widespread calls for regulation.\n\nBut whether crypto assets ultimately boom or bust, a coherent way to tax them is needed.\n\nA key issue is how to classify crypto assets\u2014should they be regarded as property or currency? When crypto is sold for profit, capital gains should be taxed as they would be on other assets. And purchases made with crypto should be subject to the same sales or value-added taxes, or VAT, that would be applied for cash transactions.\n\nSo, one important task is to ensure application of these principles, which requires clarity on how to characterize crypto for tax purposes: in essence, as currencies for VAT and sales taxes and as assets for income tax purposes. While this is not easy due to the evolving nature of crypto asset transactions, it is perfectly possible. The deepest challenges are then in enforcement.\n\nRevenue considerations\n\nCrude estimates suggest that a 20 percent tax on capital gains from crypto would have raised about $100 billion worldwide amid soaring prices in 2021. That is about 4 percent of global corporate income tax revenues, or 0.4 percent of total tax collection.\n\nBut with total crypto market capitalization down 63 percent from the late-2021 peak, tax revenues would then have shriveled. If these losses were fully offset against other taxes, there would be a corresponding reduction in revenue. In more normal times and with the current market size, global crypto tax revenues would probably average less than $25 billion a year. That, in the broader scheme of things, is not a huge amount.\n\nThere are also important fairness issues at stake. Though their pseudonymity makes it hard to be sure exactly who holds crypto, there are signs that ownership is heavily concentrated among the relatively wealthy\u2014even though holding of crypto is strikingly common across people with low incomes too. Available surveys indicate that about 10,000 people hold one quarter of all Bitcoin.\n\nThere is also VAT. Crypto transactions have similarities to those in cash in their potential for being hidden from tax administrations. Today, the share of purchases made with crypto is still small. But widespread use, if tax systems were not prepared, could someday mean widespread evasion of VAT and sales taxes, leading to materially lower government revenues. This may be the biggest threat from crypto.\n\nAddressing implementation\n\nThe most fundamental difficulty in taxing crypto assets is that they are \u201cpseudonymous.\u201d That is, transactions use public addresses that are extremely difficult to link with individuals or firms. This can make tax evasion easier. Implementation is thus at the heart of the matter for tax authorities.\n\nThe problem is surmountable when people transact through centralized exchanges, since these can be made subject to standard \u201cknow your customer\u201d tracking rules, and possibly withholding taxes. Many countries are putting such rules in place with the expectation that tax compliance will improve.\n\nHowever, reporting obligations could induce people to keep tax authorities ignorant by instead using centralized exchanges abroad. To address that concern, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has developed a framework for crypto-related exchange of information between countries. Implementation, however, is some way off.\n\nA more troubling possibility is that reporting rules (and the failures of some crypto intermediaries) could induce people to transact increasingly through decentralized exchanges or directly through peer-to-peer trades where no central governing body oversees these transactions. Those are still extremely difficult for tax administrators to penetrate.\n\nGiven the complexity of the fundamental challenges posed by pseudonymity, the rapidity of innovation, the vast information gaps, and the uncertainties ahead, the tide has not yet turned in the battle to incorporate crypto properly into the wider tax system. Some of the elements needed for doing so\u2014such as clarity in their classification for tax purposes\u2014are clear.\n\nBut the challenges are fundamental, and the risks, particularly to the VAT and sales taxes, may be greater than people recognize. As many (though far from all) governments are beginning to realize, policymakers need to develop clear, coherent, and effective frameworks for taxing crypto."

        "content": "In this article BTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nwatch now\n\nBitcoin touched a 13-month high on Thursday as the drumbeat for institutional bitcoin demand grew louder following comments from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. The cryptocurrency ended the day flat at $30,302.03, according to Coin Metrics. Early in the morning, it climbed to about $31,450, reaching its highest level since June 2022. It gave back those gains, however, after better-than-expected U.S. jobs data increased investor worries about path of interest rates. The earlier move was in contrast to both weaker stock prices and rising yields \u2014 the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note later climbed above 4% to a 16-year high. Additionally, the minutes of the Federal Reserve's June meeting, released Wednesday, showed that most officials would support more rate increases ahead. Cryptocurrency liquidity has been low for several months, continuing to exaggerate both up and down moves.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Bitcoin (BTC) pulled back Thursday following better-than-expected U.S. jobs data.\n\n\"There is still a weight on the price,\" said Noelle Acheson, economist and author of the \"Crypto is Macro Now\" newsletter. \"We have often over the past few weeks seen selling resistance at around $31,000. That will eventually be broken, but meanwhile traditional markets seem to be entering a more risk-off mood \u2013 we can't yet assume that bitcoin will just shrug that off.\" Sentiment among traders was high though, after BlackRock CEO Larry Fink gave bitcoin perhaps its biggest ever endorsement from a major institutional player. Speaking on Fox Business News on Wednesday, Fink called bitcoin \"an international asset\" and said it's \"not based on any one currency so it can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative.\" Bitcoin has steadily climbed since June 15, when BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, first filed to launch a spot bitcoin ETF. The number of coins held by institutions through trusts, ETFs and funds has spiked since then, reaching its highest level in more than a year, according to CryptoQuant, and bitcoin open interest is back to pre-FTX levels."

        "content": "Investors who want to bet on Bitcoin may soon have more options to choose from if US regulators soften their opposition to exchange-traded funds tied directly to Bitcoin holdings. Major financial firms including BlackRock, Fidelity and Invesco have submitted applications to sell US \u201cspot\u201d Bitcoin ETFs that would be physically backed by actual Bitcoin. In the past, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has routinely rejected these products, citing wariness over volatility and potential manipulation. Investors took the BlackRock filing, in particular, as a sign that the SEC was close to dropping its longtime opposition to such financial projects. Bitcoin prices hit a one-year high in the days after BlackRock\u2019s application.\n\nETFs, a $7 trillion industry , are part of a broader family of products known as exchange-traded products, though people frequently use \u201cETFs\u201d to refer to all of them since they are by far the largest and most popular category. Crypto-native firms and major Wall Street financial institutions alike are trying to launch a kind of ETF that actually holds Bitcoin, as opposed to the products that invest in Bitcoin futures. The SEC hasn\u2019t approved any applications for these so-called spot Bitcoin ETFs, whereas multiple futures-backed crypto funds already exist in the market. Futures-backed Bitcoin ETFs have been available to US customers since 2021. Issuers and investors are advocating for spot Bitcoin ETFs to be similarly accessible to retail and institutional investors in the US, a development that\u2019s perceived as having the potential to greatly broaden participation in the cryptocurrency industry."

        "content": "More than a year after cryptocurrency markets crashed, there\u2019s ample evidence that the economic benefits that many mayors claimed that digital currencies would bring their cities didn\u2019t stick, according to a new paper from researchers at the Brookings Institution.\n\nWhile benchmark crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum have recovered somewhat from their 2022 lows, there are plenty of mayor-led initiatives involving cryptocurrencies that collapsed. MiamiCoin, the bespoke token that Mayor Francis Suarez once touted as a future source of municipal revenue, was delisted in March after losing more than 99% of its value. In Chicago, a universal basic income project for formerly incarcerated people was thrown into jeopardy last year after FTX \u2014 the crypto exchange funding it \u2014 declared bankruptcy and saw its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, indicted on charges of fraud and money laundering.\n\nThose episodes and others should be taken as tough lessons for mayors about hyping up an emerging technology as the key to economic boom times, and why more deliberate and holistic approaches are needed, the Brookings paper argues.\n\nThe paper was authored by Tonantzin Carmona, a Brookings fellow who\u2019s warned about cities chasing their crypto dreams, as well as by Brookings fellows Mark Muro and Sifan Liu, who study technology and economic development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDespite some state and local governments\u2019 efforts to attract crypto activity, few of the associated startups and jobs have been stable or sustainable,\u201d they write. \u201c[The] most recent accountings suggest that in most cases, crypto-related business booms left behind few long-term job or startup gains. Instead, in many cases, what they did create were troubling pollution and energy costs, failed business projects, major consumer and investor losses, and an outbreak of fraud that local law enforcement struggled to curb.\u201d\n\nEven in the financial and tech hubs, cryptocurrency-related jobs were never an overwhelming trend \u2014 the industry never accounted for more than 0.15% of all job listings even in the most vibrant markets. And job losses have extended well beyond just the coin projects and exchanges that ended in disgrace \u2014 according to CoinDesk, nearly 30,000 crypto-related jobs have been eliminated since April 2022.\n\nBut there are lessons cities can learn from the crypto industry\u2019s shrinkage, the Brookings authors write. Any future endeavors hoping to leverage an emerging technology should be undertaken with a \u201cpragmatic baseline examination\u201d of the technology\u2019s inner workings and use cases, they write.\n\n\u201cAs local leaders move beyond the crypto debacle, they should ask themselves hard questions about the future emerging technology opportunities they come upon,\u201d the paper reads, urging leaders to take close looks at how an emerging industry would fit into the existing local tech economy and whether it will create a stable and sustainable job market.\n\nCity leaders should also aim to focus any such endeavors on what the paper\u2019s authors call an \u201cinnovation ecosystem\u201d \u2014 the community of government agencies, higher education institutions, employers, workforce organizations and other entities that have skin in a regional economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe collapse of the crypto bubble in most, if not all, places ought to nudge local leaders toward other strategies for regional economic development,\u201d the paper reads. \u201cIt should also be taken as a useful caution: Not all emerging technologies are promising, no matter how much they are hyped.\u201d"

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrypto is akin to \"digitizing gold\" and bitcoin has the power to \"revolutionize\" finance, according to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink.\n\nFink's optimism toward crypto comes as the world's largest asset-management company sets its sights on a spot bitcoin ETF, and is currently seeking approval from US regulators.\n\nJust days ago, the Securities and Exchange Commission told the CBOE and Nasdaq, which filed the bitcoin ETF applications for BlackRock and Fidelity, said that they weren't \"sufficiently clear and comprehensive.\"\n\nTo that effect, Fink said he is willing to work with regulators.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We work really closely with our regulators and we want to hear from our regulators \u2013 what are their issues and can we fix those issues around that,\" Fink said in a Fox Business interview on Wednesday.\n\n\"We do believe if we can create more tokenization of assets and securities, and that's what bitcoin is, it could revolutionize again, finance. We look at this as an opportunity to move one step further in terms of providing investors fractions of shares, fractions of this, democratizing the cost of investing,\" he added.\n\nFink admitted he was skeptical of crypto in the past, given its use for \"illicit activities\". But the pessimism has since given way to a more upbeat outlook. \"I do believe the role of crypto is digitizing gold in many ways,\" he said.\n\nWhile crypto enthusiasts tend to tout the advantages of bitcoin and digital assets in general, virtual currencies come with some inherent risks. That includes the asset class's extreme volatility - so far in 2023, bitcoin has rallied almost 90% after plunging 64% last year. It jumped almost 60% in 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt last check on Thursday, the world's largest cryptocurrency was up 2.27% to trade at $31,481.75, according to CoinMarketCap."

        "title": "Cathie Wood says BlackRock doesn\u2019t have an edge when it comes to SEC approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF - Fortune",
        "content": "I had an opportunity to sit down last week with Cathie Wood at ImPower Fund Forum in Monaco, one of the largest wealth and asset management conferences in Europe. Her investment management firm, ARK Invest, focuses on disruptive innovation and is well-known for big bets on crypto and Web3.\n\nRecently, ARK Invest made headlines by filing an amended Bitcoin ETF application with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Wood, the firm\u2019s CEO and founder, says the timing of the filing, which came after the SEC rejected earlier such bids by ARK and similar firms, could put her company in position to launch the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S.\u2014and gain a significant first-mover advantage in a new market.\n\nDuring our conversation, Wood shared her views on the broader potential of Bitcoin, the challenges of navigating the regulatory landscape, and her vision for the future of digital assets.\n\n(This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.)\n\nCan you describe how the idea of starting ARK Invest first came to you?\n\nI saw the traditional asset management world, especially after the tech and telecom bust and the 2008-09 meltdown, move towards passive and benchmark sensitive strategies, and away from innovation. And I said: \u201cNo, we have to focus on innovation because there are five major platforms evolving now.\u201d That includes multiomics (DNA) sequencing, robotics, energy storage, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology\u2014all evolving at the same time.\n\nAnd these innovations are going to cause explosive growth\u2014what we\u2019re calling super-exponential growth\u2014that we don\u2019t think people understand. But what they\u2019re also going to do is to cause a lot of disruption in the traditional world order. So, we wanted to focus exclusively on the change, and we wanted to educate people, so we give our research away. We have an open-research ecosystem. We are very happy when people comment on our research, especially if they\u2019re working in innovative areas. Give us more ideas, criticize or battle test our assumptions. So those are the main reasons.\n\nWhat about your involvement in crypto and blockchain? I read you started investing personally back in 2015. Can you tell us about your first impression of Bitcoin and this technology?\n\nYes, we had been curious about Bitcoin from 2011. Our chief futurist, Brett Winton, was fascinated by it. So, we started talking about it regularly, and when we started ARK, we wanted to dedicate resources to it. Now we have three crypto analysts.\n\nIn 2015, our analysts wrote a paper. And I asked my mentor, who\u2019s a good friend also now, Art Laffer, a very well-known economist, to read it and criticize it. And when he understood what Bitcoin was, he said: \u201cThis is what I\u2019ve been waiting for since we went off the gold-exchange standard.\u201d And I said to him then: \u201cOkay, then this is a very big idea.\u201d\n\nThis was in 2015, when it was $250. And we took our first position and gained exposure to Bitcoin through GBTC, the Grayscale Investment Trust, in 2015 for our ETFs.\n\nBlackRock just filed for a Bitcoin ETF, but ARK, along with investment company 21Shares, filed its initial application for a Bitcoin ETF back in April. Do you think this attempt will be successful attempt after earlier ones failed?\n\nWell, many people think BlackRock knows something about the SEC. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. We think that this has been in process for a while. But with the Grayscale trial [challenging the SEC\u2019s refusal to allow a spot Bitcoin ETF] coming to a conclusion pretty soon\u2014maybe August\u2014if the SEC loses that case, then the odds go up of a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nAnd we have our filing. The SEC has until around mid-January to approve it. BlackRock is through March. So, they were probably thinking: Okay, this is a call option potentially on the SEC looking more favorably on a Bitcoin ETF, especially because they\u2019ve approved not only Bitcoin futures ETFs, but now it seems that they\u2019re approving a leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF. And futures involve swaps, whereas a Bitcoin Spot ETF, at least the Grayscale version, is backed fully by Bitcoin in cold storage. So, a spot exchange seems to us to be much safer\u2014and the SEC\u2019s approval process has been contradictory from our point of view.\n\nAnd how much will it change, in your opinion, the development of the crypto industry if the SEC approves Bitcoin spot ETF finally?\n\nOne of the things we\u2019ve been worried about is the SEC chasing innovation away from the U.S. Innovation is in the U.S.\u2019s DNA, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re happy that the judicial branch of government and the legislative branch of government are getting involved. So, what this probably means is we will stop chasing away innovation once we get rules of the road fully in place. We\u2019ll bring back more of the innovation, and it\u2019ll be a global phenomenon. We\u2019re pretty excited that there are many other innovation hubs that want to make this happen, and we want to help them make this happen as well, because it is a global movement.\n\nDo you think that there may be an outcome where the SEC will do a favor to BlackRock, and will approve their spot Bitcoin ETF, but reject yours?\n\nWe don\u2019t think so. We know that there was a surveillance clause in their prospectus that ours didn\u2019t include, but what I\u2019m told is it won\u2019t take much time for us to amend our prospectus, and that all of the exchanges are moving in this direction. [ARK amended its application to add a surveillance clause shortly after this interview.]\n\nOther major crypto news includes the recent launch of EDX, which separates trading and custody, while other big players like Citadel Securities and Fidelity are getting into crypto. Your thoughts?\n\nYes, I think institutional development was thrown off by FTX last year and all of the turmoil, and by the Wells notice and the lawsuits, especially the Coinbase lawsuit by SEC. But I think we\u2019ve seen the worst, and the outcome is interesting. We\u2019re finding that institutions want to learn more, and they\u2019re becoming more sophisticated. So, they want to be ready for a new asset class, if this truly is a new asset class from their point of view, and we think it is."

        "content": "BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager with nearly $9 trillion in assets under management, has made significant strides toward embracing bitcoin, as indicated by its recent filing for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund. The company\u2019s decision to take steps to offer its clients exposure to the digital asset are likely to bring a surge of institutional adoption to the space.\n\nThe company also recently resubmitted their filing after the SEC responded that the initial filings required more information in regards to the exchange\u2019s involved, subsequently adding Coinbase to the filing, as other firms refiling did.\n\nAnd now, BlackRock\u2019s CEO, Larry Fink, has made an appearance on Fox Business where he stated that the role of bitcoin and crypto is \u201cdigitizing gold.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of investing in gold as a hedge against inflation \u2026 or the devaluation of your currency \u2026 [bitcoin] can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative,\u201d Fink stated. The description reinforces the perception of bitcoin as a store of value, akin to the role gold has traditionally played in investment portfolios. By likening bitcoin to gold, Fink acknowledges the international nature of the digital asset, highlighting its potential as a global store of wealth \u2014 and indeed, during his news appearance, Fink further emphasized that, \"Bitcoin is an international asset.\"\n\nThe televised statement underscores the conviction Fink, and likely BlackRock, have in bitcoin and its potential role in the future. Fink's recognition of bitcoin's international appeal further bolsters the case for increased institutional interest and investment.\n\nBlackRock's pursuit of a Bitcoin ETF and Fink's endorsement of bitcoin as digitized gold reflect a notable shift in the attitude of major financial institutions toward bitcoin. These developments suggest that BlackRock, along with other industry giants, recognizes the potential of bitcoin to reshape the financial landscape.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "If You Are Bullish on Bitcoin, This Skyrocketing Software Stock Is a Screaming Buy - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The first six months of the year have been extraordinary for Bitcoin (BTC -0.16%). The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is now up more than 80% for the year, and analysts are increasingly bullish about the crypto's long-term prospects. In fact, some analysts are now predicting that Bitcoin could hit $100,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nBut what if you are not ready to hold Bitcoin directly in your portfolio? Well, there's another way to get access to the upside potential of Bitcoin without taking on as much risk, and it comes in the form of MicroStrategy (MSTR 10.85%), an enterprise software stock that's up almost 170% for the year. The company holds a tremendous amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet, and that's what makes it a fantastic indirect play on the price of Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin on the balance sheet\n\nIn August 2020, MicroStrategy became the first publicly-traded company to buy Bitcoin as part of its capital allocation strategy. Since then, MicroStrategy has been binge-buying Bitcoin and the company's founder, Michael Saylor, has become one of the biggest Bitcoin bulls in the world. The company now holds more than $4.6 billion worth of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. That's far more than even Coinbase, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nMoreover, MicroStrategy shows no signs of letting up on its Bitcoin strategy. Over the past two months, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, the company bought another 12,000 Bitcoins worth $347 million. The company now holds 152,333 Bitcoins on its balance sheet, worth about $4.6 billion. By way of comparison, the total market capitalization of MicroStrategy is about $4.9 billion. Thus, the market is essentially saying that the total value of Bitcoin accounts for almost all of the company's market value.\n\nSafer than Bitcoin?\n\nMicroStrategy was founded 34 years ago and is generally considered to be one of the top business intelligence software providers in the world. The company has clients in a number of different segments, including retail, financial services, healthcare, technology, and the public sector. And it's all those paying customers who provide a certain margin of safety. Even if the crypto market were to crash, the company would still have a sustainable software business to fall back on.\n\nRight now, MicroStrategy is modestly profitable. In the first quarter of 2023, for example, MicroStrategy posted a gross profit of $94 million, nearly identical to the $93.6 million gross profit that it posted in the year-earlier period. As long as the company can increase its enterprise software business, this number should continue to tick upward. For example, the company is now getting involved with artificial intelligence in order to find new ways to embed AI functionality into its core enterprise analytics packages. And the company is also working on ways to provide Bitcoin payment solutions to clients.\n\nA proxy for Bitcoin\n\nThe big caveat here, of course, is that MicroStrategy appears to be extremely correlated with the price of Bitcoin. Thus, the price of MicroStrategy increases if the price of Bitcoin rises. And, conversely, the price of MicroStrategy falls if the price of Bitcoin declines. This chart below, showing the relationship between Bitcoin and MicroStrategy in 2023, says it all:\n\nData by TradingView\n\nIn short, there's a good reason some institutional investors view MicroStrategy stock as a proxy for holding Bitcoin. The company simply holds so much Bitcoin right now -- equivalent to nearly 0.7% of all Bitcoin in circulation -- that the market is valuing it as an indirect play on the price of Bitcoin.\n\nAs MicroStrategy itself pointed out in its last earnings release in May, one major prong of its corporate strategy is to acquire and hold Bitcoin. And there's no reason to think that MicroStrategy is going to pull back on its current Bitcoin strategy anytime soon.\n\nThus, if you're bullish on Bitcoin, then you should be bullish on the prospects of MicroStrategy. With MicroStrategy, you can get access to the upside of Bitcoin without all the risk of investing in cryptocurrency directly."

        "content": "A small fraction of bitcoin trading volume, just 9.49%, exist on registered US crypto exchanges, leaving tons of transactional revenue off the table for platforms like Coinbase and Kraken.\n\nAnd a newly released report from CCData suggests that American exchanges have been giving up more and more of their share of bitcoin (BTC) trades since at least January 2023, with March being an uncharacteristically good month.\n\nSo where is all this bitcoin volume?\n\nThe data suggests that bitcoin trading volume, as well as the volume for most other tokens, remains on Binance. In June, users traded $239 billion worth of crypto on Binance\u2019s spot markets, representing a 12.6% jump from May.\n\nCoinbase, which CCData noted represents 61% of bitcoin trading volume among US exchanges, has a much smaller share of the total pie with just $30 billion compared to Binance\u2019s nearly quarter of a trillion.\n\nAnd Kraken\u2019s total spot trading volume was half that of Coinbase at $16.2 billion.\n\nCCData researchers added the caveat that despite firms like Binance experiencing incremental increases in spot trading recently, \u201cspot trading volumes on centralized exchanges remain at historically low levels, recording the lowest quarterly volumes since Q4 of 2019.\u201d\n\nThe data also points to the fact that offshore crypto exchanges are starting to get rewarded in terms of market share. The lawsuits against Binance, Binance.US and Coinbase, however, coincide with a decrease in their market share in June.\n\nBybit, which is headquartered in Dubai, experienced about a 0.5% and 1.3% increase in market share during June and May, respectively. Bullish and Upbit, both of which reside outside of the US, also saw jumps in their business over the last two months, according to CCData.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s also important to note that crypto derivatives trading volume is far greater than spot volume, a trend that began in 2021, according to CCData.\n\nIn fact, the derivatives made up nearly 79% of the entire crypto market in June. Binance once again captured the majority of it at 56.8%. Kraken is the next closest American competitor to Binance, but doesn\u2019t even come close. Similarly, Coinbase doesn\u2019t even crack the top eight firms in terms of derivatives.\n\nSource: CCData June Exchange Review\n\nAfter Binance, which notably claims it does not have a static headquarters, the rest of the biggest firms who deal in derivatives are all based outside the US. Seychelles-based OKX had 19.5% of the derivatives market share in June, and in third place was Bybit with 12.6% of the market. Bitget, also registered in Seychelles came in fourth.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

The top gainer among large-cap cryptos on Thursday, however, is bitcoin cash (BCH), up more than 12%, and continuing a big run higher following its listing on EDX Markets which is backed by Fidelity, Charles Schwab and Citadel Securities. Gains could continue in July as data from TradingView shows this month is historically a good one for cryptos. One year ago in July, BCH rose 34%, while BTC advanced 17%."

        "content": "Bitcoin is a new paradigm, it\u2019s been said, in which bubbles are mathematically impossible. Bear markets, however, are definitely part of our reality.\n\nStill, relying on legacy finance definitions of bull and bear markets to map bitcoin cycles is a fool\u2019s errand.\n\nThe old ways dictate that bear markets begin when an asset drops 20% from recent highs and end when they rise 20% from local lows. The S&P 500 was declared to have exited its bear market about one month ago under these very conditions.\n\nIf those rules truly mapped to crypto, bitcoin (BTC) would\u2019ve shed its most recent bear market sometime in early January, when BTC crossed $20,000 after crashing below $16,500 as FTX went kaput.\n\nBitcoin just finished a very long stretch of negative year-on-year returns\n\nAnother strategy riffs on those guidelines. A bear market would be over when bitcoin trades 20% above recent lows for one month or more. Bitcoin did just that this year, when it stayed above $18,800 throughout January until mid-February.\n\nHere\u2019s one more method: Bitcoin is in a bear market when its year-on-year returns are negative. It\u2019s in a bull market when the opposite is true.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, then bitcoin exited its longest bear market ever on June 12, just a few days after the S&P.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s year-on-year returns were negative for 490 days \u2014 a new record.\n\nReturns reached as low as -83.6% across that period.\n\nThe previous record was 353 days between November 2014 and October 2015\n\nThe 2023-2023 line is much longer than the others\n\nBitcoin would\u2019ve entered the most recent bear market early last February, when it traded for $44,000 \u2014 around 35% below its $69,000 high set in November 2021.\n\nIt\u2019s a very basic hypothetical. Nevertheless, it would imply that bitcoin has been in a bull market for the past 24 days. BTC\u2019s year-on-year returns have hit more than 61% in that time.\n\nMost probably, it\u2019s too early to say that we\u2019re back. Don\u2019t let that dampen your parade, especially if you\u2019ve been holding since at least the start of last year.\n\nCongratulations, you just survived the longest bear market in history.

        "content": "It seemed like a perfectly believable story: Two teenagers in Canada posed as members of Coinbase\u2019s support team and scammed an American man out of $4.2 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAfter seeing an email with a news release about the supposed arrest of the teenagers, a reporter from the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (CBC), one of Canada\u2019s leading news outlets, ran the since-deleted story, according to a member of the Hamilton Police Service familiar with the matter. (However, whether that email was the ultimate source for the story has yet to be determined.) The police in Hamilton, a city near the border of New York, reportedly teamed up with the FBI and the U.S. Secret Service Electronic Crimes Task Force to pin down the two 17-year-olds, who went by the aliases \u201cFelon\u201d and \u201cGaze.\u201d\n\nNews of the arrest of the teenagers, who, according to reports, used some of their $4.2 million in stolen crypto to buy coveted username @zombie on Instagram, then spread across a number of crypto publications. However, the entire story\u2014from the teenagers\u2019 alleged heist to their arrest\u2014is a sham, according to the Hamilton Police Service.\n\n\u201c[We] can confirm this investigation did not occur and the email did not originate from the Hamilton Police Service,\u201d the police said in an official statement. The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The CBC has since removed its original story, and its URL now redirects to a new piece describing how its reporter received a hoax email.\n\n\u201cCoinbase has extensive security resources dedicated to educating customers about preventing phishing attacks and scams,\u201d a spokesperson for the exchange said in a statement. \u201cWe work with international law enforcement to ensure that anyone scamming Coinbase customers is prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d\n\nWhile several publications were duped into running a lurid story of yet another crypto arrest, the theft as described would not have been the first of its kind.\n\nIn January 2018, in the village of Irvington, N.Y., 15-year-old Ellis Pinsky, nicknamed \u201cBaby Al Capone,\u201d allegedly stole almost $24 million from crypto millionaire Michael Terpin. Pinsky agreed to pay back Terpin without admitting any guilt.\n\nAnd the Hamilton Police Service itself has investigated and arrested a teenager for stealing almost $35 million in crypto through a SIM swap attack, or when scammers port a victim\u2019s phone number over to their devices to bypass two-factor authentication.\n\nThe investigation and arrest, which happened in 2021, echoes the spoofed news release, including the Hamilton police partnership with the FBI and U.S. Secret Service Electronic Crimes Task Force as well as the stolen crypto being spent on a rare online username.\n\nUpdate, July 5, 2023: This article has been updated with an official comment from the Hamilton police as well as more information about the CBC."

        "title": "Bitcoin to $200,000? Wall Street's Tom Lee Predicts Major Upside for the World's Largest Cryptocurrency - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC -0.07%) had a miserable 2022, and the token remains down by more than half from its all-time high. Investors are still digesting a wave of negativity, which included the collapse of several cryptocurrency exchanges last year, not to mention some of the industry's most prized stablecoin experiments.\n\nBut the crypto winter might be thawing, because Bitcoin has gained an impressive 84% in 2023 so far, outpacing traditional asset classes, including the stock market. The leading cryptocurrency has regained the attention of some Wall Street analysts, including the managing partner of Fundstrat, Tom Lee, who recently told CNBC he thinks it could be on its way to $200,000.\n\nLee has been spot on about the stock market lately, so it's worth paying attention to his call on Bitcoin. Here are the details.\n\nWhy investors went cold on the crypto industry\n\nThe decentralized concept behind cryptocurrencies resonates with many consumers who might have some level of distrust for the traditional banking system, and even their governments. But last year, they learned the true value of regulation.\n\nThe crypto industry suffered a plethora of high-profile collapses, with the TerraUSD stablecoin wiping out an estimated $60 billion worth of value seemingly overnight. Then, just months later, one of the largest cryptocurrency brokerages in the world -- FTX -- was found to have misappropriated customer funds. Investigations are ongoing, but as it stands, FTX customers are owed an estimated $3 billion.\n\nIf those funds were held with a U.S. bank instead of being held offshore in places like the Bahamas, account holders would have automatically been insured for up to $250,000, thanks to the government-backed Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC). But unfortunately, FTX customers face the real prospect of a total loss.\n\nBeyond those failures, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin haven't made much progress with respect to adoption as a payment mechanism. According to Cryptwerk, just 8,091 businesses around the world accept Bitcoin for the sale of goods and services, a drop in the bucket considering more than 330 million registered companies exist as of this writing.\n\nVolatility has likely played some part. Bitcoin's large price swings aren't an attractive feature for consumers who might want to spend it as a currency, because its purchasing power would fluctuate drastically from month to month. Tom Lee touched on that point in his interview with CNBC, saying Bitcoin trades like a risk-on asset, which follows the moves in the stock market.\n\nThat stacks up, given the major stock market indexes crashed last year just like Bitcoin, and both are trading comfortably in the green in 2023.\n\nTom Lee thinks $200,000 is on the table for Bitcoin\n\nLee has been bullish on Bitcoin for years. Back in May 2021, he predicted the token would close that year at a price of $100,000 -- it didn't happen, so it's always important to be mindful of the risks when buying speculative assets like cryptocurrencies.\n\nNonetheless, Lee cites a few reasons the token could climb over the next few years. He thinks it's particularly important that large asset managers like BlackRock are stepping into the crypto industry, filling the void left by bad actors like FTX. BlackRock recently filed to list a Bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF), and there is speculation the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might be on its way to approving it, despite being opposed to such securities in the past.\n\nFidelity Investments has also just applied for a Bitcoin ETF. As more trusted, well-known firms on Wall Street throw their hats into the ring, the SEC might find it harder to justify further rejections. After all, its job is to protect investors, and having them place funds in the hands of regulated financial institutions in the U.S. is preferable to them sending money offshore to unregulated brokerages.\n\nWhen it comes to setting a price target, Lee has referred to the work done by Ark Investment Management and the firm's CEO, Cathie Wood. Ark's base case is for Bitcoin to reach $600,000 per token by 2030, and it says there's even potential for it to reach $1 million in more bullish conditions. Wood has cited this year's regional banking crisis as a driver of Bitcoin adoption, and Lee says her idea of network value for Bitcoin and its scarcity suggest a price of \"$200,000 plus\" might be possible.\n\nStill, setting price targets based on those factors requires a huge amount of guesswork. Bitcoin generates no revenue or earnings, so pinning down a true value the same way you would for traditional financial assets is practically impossible.\n\nIt's unlikely any of these factors will draw consumers into the Bitcoin ecosystem, so it might still be relegated to the whims of speculators. But credible U.S. firms becoming more active in the space could entice a more conservative investor class into the asset, which is a positive in the long term. Personally, I wouldn't bet my money on Bitcoin soaring 549% from here to reach $200,000, especially with plenty of other exciting and much safer opportunities out there."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether, all other top 10 cryptocurrencies fall - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin, Ether and all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies fell on Thursday morning in Asia as the U.S. public holiday this week slowed trading and some investors seemed to be taking profits off recent gains. Bitcoin is still up 1% for the week, with BlackRock\u2019s head Larry Fink backing the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency as having the potential to revolutionize finance. Litecoin and Cardano led the losers.\n\nBitcoin driver\n\nBitcoin fell 1.06% over the last 24 hours to US$30,465 at 06:35 a.m. in Hong Kong, while its weekly gain stood at 1.02%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The token, which had a market cap of US$591 billion as of Thursday, has risen 83% so far this year in a rebound from the bear market slump in 2022.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is still the main driver of trading volume albeit that is also soft \u2013 no doubt linked to the July 4th U.S. public holiday washing through,\u201d said Caroline Bowler, the chief executive officer of Australia-based crypto exchange BTC Markets, in a text message to Forkast.\n\n\u201cWe may be seeing the effects of this reduced liquidity and greater asset concentration playing out, with some greater price sensitivities in trading,\u201d Bowler added. \u201cThe industry is coming out of the prolonged bear market so this is to be expected.\u201d\n\nThe price dip came after a run up in many tokens sparked by growing optimism around the possible approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., which will open the cryptocurrency to a wider pool of investors.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager that oversees about US$10 trillion, filed applications to launch the first publicly traded spot Bitcoin ETFs on June 15. It refiled the application on Monday after the regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, reportedly said it was lacking in detail.\n\nLarry Fink, chief executive officer of BlackRock Inc., said Wednesday that he wanted to \u201cdemocratize\u201d cryptocurrencies with the ETF filings, in an interview with Fox Business. Fink also said Bitcoin is an international asset that could revolutionize finance.\n\nEther lost 1.55% to US$1,911, though it was holding onto a gain of 4.40% for the past seven days.\n\nAll other top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization lost ground, with Litecoin and Cardano leading the losing pack.\n\nLitecoin slipped 3.84% to US$102.19 in what appeared to be profit taking after the token gained ahead of its halving on Aug. 2 and its listing on EDX Markets, the Wall Street-backed crypto exchange in the U.S. that opened on June 20. Litecoin is still up 22.72% on the week.\n\nCardano\u2019s ADA lost 3.60% to US$0.2843 while adding 5.61% for the week. Today\u2019s correction also seemed linked to profit-taking, even as parent company Input Output Global Inc. on Wednesday released Marlowe, a so-called toolset to build smart contracts on the blockchain.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap fell 1.32% to US$1.19 trillion in the last 24 hours, while crypto trading volume rose 0.58% to US$31.27 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nBlurry outlook for NFTs\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.96% in the 24 hours to 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong to 2,801.94, but logged a loss of 1.72% for the week. While the Forkast Ethereum NFT index rose, the indexes measuring the performance of Solana, Polygon and Cardano-based NFT markets all declined.\n\nInvestors remain basically pessimistic, said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\n\u201cForkast 500 NFT Index is up almost 1%, though still has traders wondering if this is a dead cat bounce, or if there is enough value with these discounted NFT prices that collections have fallen to recently,\u201d Petscher said. \u201cMost are betting this is not the bottom, and a new update from the Blur marketplace has traders worried.\u201d\n\nBlur marketplace took the NFT world by storm when it launched last November, and its 30-day trading volume surpassed previous NFT leader OpenSea in February. Blur picked up more steam when it launched Blend, a peer-to-peer lending protocol for NFTs on May 2.\n\nBlur is expanding its popular reward system that distributes $Blur tokens to users that have met certain criteria as \u201cairdrops,\u201d but Petscher says this could be bad news for NFTs overall.\n\n\u201c\u200b\u200bBlur is introducing rewards for trait offers, which means traders who bid on specific NFT traits on select projects will receive Blur reward points. These points will contribute to the amount of $Blur tokens that traders will receive at the end of Blur\u2019s season 2 airdrop,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nThis will lead to more farmers \u2014 buyers that generate income through staking NFTs \u2014 to prevail in the market over pure collectors.\n\n\u201cThe concert with the new mechanic is that traders will artificially inflate the rarer NFTs in collections, as you receive more points the higher a bid is from the floor price of the collection,\u201d said Petscher. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how the new trait offers affect NFT prices, but it\u2019s expected to continue artificially inflating NFT prices, and then culminate in floor crashes like we saw recently.\u201d\n\nBy NFT collections, Bored Ape Yacht Club topped the trading volume rankings on Cryptoslam with US$3.76 million, with the volume surging 74.52% on the day. Uncategorized Bitcoin Ordinals \u2014 unique digital assets on the Bitcoin network that are not identified as part of one established collection \u2014 placed second by transactions volume, rising 22.03% to US$1.86 million.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume dropped 4.61% to US$28.3 million. Volume on Ethereum fell 9.36% to US$19.3 million according to Cryptoslam data. Volume on the Bitcoin network gained 11.97% to US$3.69 million, while volumes on Polygon, Solana and BNB also rose.\n\nEquity futures slip\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen | Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures dipped as of 10:45 a.m. Thursday in Hong Kong, pointing to another down day for stocks that fell during regular trading on Wednesday. Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq all declined by about 0.1%.\n\nMinutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s June meeting showed most Fed officials favor more interest rate increases this year, adding to the conviction the U.S. will raise rates again this month, according to Trading Economics. This concern hit Asian equities as well.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 and South Korea\u2019s Kospi all moved lower. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite managed a marginal gain of 0.1% on Thursday.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen arrives in Beijing on Thursday and investors anticipate that the meetings she will have through July 9 may help stabilize relations between the world\u2019s two largest economies, currently marked by sanctions and distrust.\n\nOn economic indicators, the U.S. releases initial jobless claims and the services purchasing managers\u2019 index on Thursday.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s next meeting on rates is July 26. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 88.7% chance for a 25-basis-point rate increase, up from 87.4% on Tuesday. The likelihood the Fed won\u2019t increase is now at 11.3%.\n\n(Updates to add equities section)"

        "content": "Bitcoin fell below the US$30,000 support line in Friday morning trading in Asia as traders took profits amid worries about interest rate hikes in U.S. markets that drove investors into so-called risk-off mode, which pulled equities lower. Ether fell along with most other top 10 non-stablecoin tokens. Solana dodged the bearish sentiment to jump more than 6%. Despite the declines, the cryptocurrency Fear & Greed Index stands in the Greed territory at 56, as institutional interest in Bitcoin looks solid.\n\nLosing ground\n\nBitcoin fell 1.88% over the last 24 hours to US$29,919 at 07:20 a.m. in Hong Kong to post a loss of 1.68% for the past seven days, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency reached US$31,399 on Thursday night, the highest in 13 months.\n\n\u201cWith strong economic data in the US, good earning expectations and employment data in the private sector, investors are seeing increasing chances of further rate hikes; bond yields rose while equity indexes fell sharply,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of APAC business development at Belgium-based crypto market-maker Keyrock.\n\n\u201cThe broad sell-off in risk assets undoubtedly affected crypto traders\u2019 sentiment and new highs were seen as a profit-taking opportunity, rather than a chance to go long and hope for even higher prices,\u201d d\u2019Anethan said.\n\nLarge financial institutions show increasing interest in Bitcoin, according to the Bitcoin Monthly June 2023 Report by asset manager Ark Invest on Thursday, which highlighted the balance of Bitcoin held on over-the-counter (OTC) desks, a proxy for institutional activity, hitting a one-year high in late June.\n\n\u201cBy the end of the quarter, the OTC Bitcoin balance had increased by 60% sequentially,\u201d Ark Invest wrote in the report, which suggests \u201cinstitutions and other large capital allocators are focused increasingly on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nEther fell 3.13% to US$1,851, leaving it flat for the week. The token reached a high of US$1,956 on Thursday evening, but soon lost ground as investors took profits.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also logged losses in the past 24 hours, with the exception of Solana\u2019s SOL and Tron\u2019s TRX.\n\nSolana jumped 6.48% to US$20.12, moving up 12.52% for the week. The token breached the US$20 resistance level on Thursday evening for the first time since June 7 as sentiment received a boost from a partnership between Coca-Cola Serbia and Solana\u2019s non-fungible token (NFT) platform SolSea. The two will launch Coca-Cola brand NFTs at the Exit Festival in Serbia from July 6 to 9.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap fell 1.45% to US$1.17 trillion in the last 24 hours, while crypto trading volume rose 37.62% to US$43.26 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nForkast 500 NFT index dips\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.38% in the 24 hours to 11:15 a.m. in Hong Kong to 2,774.37, down 2.73% for the week. The two Forkast indexes measuring the performance of Solana and Cardano NFT markets logged increases.\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) led collections by trading volumes, which rose 19.85% to US$3.49 million. Mutant Ape Yach Club (MAYC) and Azuki ranked second and third.\n\n\u201cThe big NFT collections who saw large decreases in their floor prices have regained some footing, and now are bouncing up or down around 5% instead of the massive double-digit swings they were seeing earlier this week and last week,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\nThe floor price of BAYC edged up 0.6% in the past 24 hours to 30.95 ETH (US$57,477), according to data from CoinGecko, while MAYC and Azuki dipped 1.5% and 3.2% over the same period. However, the three tokens are still holding two-digit losses for the past seven days.\n\nDespite the low price opportunities, a lack of liquidity is keeping investors away from the market, according to Petscher, who said \u201ctraders are openly discussing having no liquidity and no plans to take advantage of historically low prices across blockchains.\u201d\n\nBlur, the leading NFT marketplace, launched its version 2 trading platform on Thursday, which introduced a 50% cut in gas fees and a new \u201ctrait bidding\u201d feature, which allows traders to bid on specific NFT traits rather than collections and receive Blur reward points.\n\nHowever, the update doesn\u2019t appear to be attracting traders. According to data from blockchain aggregator DefiLlama, the total value locked on Blur was US$134.96 million on Friday, down from 155.68 million on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also talk of ETH being withdrawn from Blur\u2019s ETH pool as some of the biggest points farmers are upset with the ongoing Season 2 of farming,\u201d said Petscher. Blur announced its Season 2 of farming in February and said it would distribute over 300 million Blur tokens as rewards for bidding, listing, lending and other activities in the marketplaces.\n\nGood news is bad news (again) for U.S. equities\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded lower as of 14:00 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CNN. The three major U.S. indexes also fell in the regular Thursday session.\n\nMost main Stock indexes across Asia also tumbled on Friday, with Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei all sliding. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index edged up.\n\nEconomic indicators out in the U.S. overnight showed increases in private sector jobs and pay, according to the ADP National Employment Report published. The payroll increase is more than double the analysts\u2019 expectation of 228,000, Reuters reported on Thursday, despite the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary tightening campaign.\n\nThe U.S. services purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) rose to 53.9 in June, according to the Institute for Supply Management on Thursday, which beats Reuters\u2019 projection of 51. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, below 50 a contraction.\n\nThe data added to concerns that the Federal Reserve will continue its campaign of raising rates and holding them higher for longer periods to tackle inflation. The Fed meets on July 26 to make its next decision on interest rates, after leaving them unchanged in June at between 5% and 5.25%.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 92.4% chance for a 25-basis-point rate increase, up from 88.7% on Thursday. The likelihood the Fed won\u2019t increase is now at just 7.6%.\n\nInvestors are now waiting for the U.S. government\u2019s employment report on Friday, with economists polled by the Wall Street Journal projecting the U.S. economy added 240,000 jobs in June, down from 339,000 in May.\n\n(Updates with NFT and equity sections.)"

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether fell during Wednesday afternoon trading in Hong Kong but remained above key price levels, while most of the top altcoins were in the red. The altcoin bear market could last another two to six months, due to the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) moves against these tokens, industry experts told Forkast.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin breaches US$31,195 following Fidelity\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application\n\nBitcoin, Ether, most top 10 cryptos decline except Doge, Sol\n\nBitcoin inched down 0.21% from 7:20 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong to US$30,735. Ether fell 0.61% in the same period to trade at US$1,929, floating above US$1,900 since Sunday.\n\nOn Tuesday, the price of Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, rose to US$31,371, its highest since June 2022, over optimism about spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund applications by a raft of Wall Street heavyweights, including Blackrock.\n\nWhile both Bitcoin and Ether remain firmly above key psychological levels, altcoins seem to lack momentum compared to the two largest cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cThe delisting of specific assets from US cryptocurrency exchanges in June has accentuated a demarcation in asset performance that has existed since the start of the bear market in 2021,\u201d Jamie Coutts, a senior market structure analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told Forkast in a statement.\n\n\u201cAssets deemed commodities, Bitcoin and Ethereum (although not enshrined), have generated a collective return shy of 70% year-to-date and are 58% from their all-time highs. Meanwhile, SECurities have averaged a paltry 18.87% languishing 84% below their all-time highs,\u201d wrote Coutts, adding that the altcoin bear market could last another two to six months.\n\nAltcoins have suffered from the SEC\u2019s crackdown on tokens that they deem financial securities. Solana, Cardano, Polygon and BNB were among those that the regulator named as unregistered securities in its lawsuits filed against the Coinbase and Binance.US exchanges in early June.\n\nLitecoin was the day\u2019s biggest loser in the top 10, falling 2.65% to US$104.49, followed by Binance\u2019s BNB token that decreased 1.20% in the past 24 hours to trade at US$242.29.\n\nDogecoin increased 0.45% to US$0.06858, followed by Solana\u2019s Sol token that inched up 0.26% to US$19.20, as the day\u2019s only two gainers in the top 10 cryptos.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours fell 0.89% to US$1.2 trillion and market volume decreased 27.35% to US$27.24 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nEthereum, BAYC NFT sales drop, Bitcoin Ordinals extend gains\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.83% to 2,770.49 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong but fell 3.35% during the week.\n\nAfter a weak Tuesday, Bitcoin\u2019s 24-hour non-fungible token sales rose 41.21% to US$3.53 million, as sales for $FRAM BRC-20 NFTs rose 3.19% to US$1.36 million.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales fell 22.24% to US$19.07 million, as sales for the largest Ethereum-native NFT collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, fell 20.44% to US$2.33 million, but Mutant Ape Yacht Club sales rose 29.44% to US$2.3 million.\n\n\u201cThe Forkast 500 NFT Index reflects declining sales prices across collections on all chains, but it\u2019s Ethereum that\u2019s really dragging the market down with it,\u201d said Petscher, pointing to the recent problems with the Azuki NFT collection.\n\n\u201cAzuki\u2019s struggles exasperated the already struggling market \u2026 Azuki\u2019s new Elementals mint was supposed to be a boom for NFTs and instead was a bust, becoming a catalyst that drove NFT collections down to all-time lows.\u201d\n\nAzuki sales continued their fall, decreasing 16.36% to US$1.66 million, after the new Azuki Elementals collection was criticized for being too similar to the original. The Azuki Elementals collection began minting last Tuesday and sold out in 15 minutes, but left collectors disappointed as the latest collection looked almost the same as the original.\n\nAmong the Forkast Labs NFT indexes, the Forkast SOL NFT Composite was the only one in the red, falling 0.75% to 791.91 points.\n\nAsian equities, U.S. stock futures fall, as investors brace for more rate hikes\n\nMajor Asian equities weakened as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, as investors were cautious ahead of Chinese inflation data scheduled for release later this week, with the risk of deflation still weighing on the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nThe Caixin China General Composite purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) \u2014 a measure of the performance of both the manufacturing and services sectors in China \u2014 dropped to 52.5 in June from 55.6 the previous month. This marks the sixth consecutive month of expansion for China\u2019s private sector. However, the growth rate was the slowest since January.\n\nEmployment in China also returned to growth, as the service sector created more jobs following a drop in manufacturing payrolls, according to Trading Economics.\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.25% and the Shenzhen Component Index fell 0.91%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index lost 1.57% and the Shanghai Composite decreased 0.69%.\n\nU.S. stock futures also fell during Wednesday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, as investors were concerned that continued monetary tightening could lead the U.S. economy into a recession.\n\nThe S&P 500 futures index slipped 0.33%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures weekend 0.48% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.3%.\n\nInvestors now anticipate the release of the minutes of June\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee meeting, scheduled for later today, for more clues on the central bank\u2019s upcoming monetary decisions.\n\nMarkets are expecting another 25 basis point interest rate hike this month, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that more rate increases are needed to bring inflation to the target 2%.\n\nSee related article: EU publishes draft bill for digital euro and cash payments\n\nUpdates with equities section."

        "content": "Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, has delivered pro-crypto remarks amid the asset manager applying to list a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States.\n\nSpeaking on Fox Business on July 5, Fink said the role of cryptocurrency was largely \u201cdigitizing gold,\u201d suggesting U.S. regulators consider how an ETF directly linked to Bitcoin (BTC) could democratize finance. During his time at BlackRock, Fink has often commented on major events affecting the crypto space, including the collapse of FTX in 2022 and rising interest in BTC.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear: Bitcoin is an international asset,\u201d said Fink. \u201cIt\u2019s not based on any one currency, and so it can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative.\u201d\n\nFink suggested that investors could turn to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation or the devaluation of certain currencies. As CEO of the largest asset management firm in the world, with more than $9 trillion in assets under management as of April, Fink\u2019s pro-crypto sentiment could create ripples in and out of the space.\n\nRelated: Developed markets lagging behind in digital payments: BlackRock CEO\n\nMany crypto users on social media reacted positively to Fink\u2019s interview, with at least one suggesting his words could cause the price of certain assets to surge in what the user called the \u201cFink Pump.\u201d At the time of publication, the BTC price was $30,473, having dropped by roughly 1% in the previous 24 hours.\n\nUnder Fink, BlackRock has attempted to launch a spot BTC ETF with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase acting as a surveillance partner. It\u2019s unclear if the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve the investment vehicle, given its track record of rejecting all previously filed spot BTC ETF applications to date.\n\nMagazine: Gary Gensler\u2019s job at risk, BlackRock\u2019s first spot Bitcoin ETF and other news: Hodler\u2019s Digest, June 11-17"

        "content": "The crypto market took a beating at the end of last year. The bankruptcy of FTX amid an alleged fraud dragged the prices of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, to multiyear lows. However, Bitcoin dismissed regulatory scrutiny and more than doubled this year from the trough of last year.\n\nAn improved economic environment coupled with new institutional participation in the crypto market encouraged investors to pile into the world\u2019s numero uno cryptocurrency, resulting in a price surge that exceeded gains in the stock market.\n\nAnd as market pundits expect Bitcoin\u2019s epic run to continue in the second half of this year, stocks such as HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. HIVE, Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. MARA and Bitfarms Ltd. BITF are poised to gain.\n\nBitcoin Witness a Remarkable Surge\n\nThe price of Bitcoin, has recently breezed past the psychological threshold of $31,000 and established a solid support level. Notably, the price of Bitcoin notched its best first half of a year since 2019. The price of the largest-digital asset even surpassed the tech-laden Nasdaq\u2019s best first-half gains in four decades.\n\nMoreover, on Jul 4, Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume soared 47.2% in 24 hours, a clear indication of investors\u2019 interest in the digital asset. Bitcoin\u2019s price, by the way, continues to hover above the 200-day simple moving average, indicating further upswing.\n\nWhat\u2019s Behind the Bitcoin Rally?\n\nBitcoin is zooming up, and it\u2019s partly because of the Federal Reserves\u2019 pause in interest rate hikes in its last policy meeting held in the month of June. Needless to say, an increase in interest rates was always a headwind in 2022, as higher rates weighed heavily on high-risk assets such as digital coins and tech stocks.\n\nMeanwhile, the banking sector turmoil in March 2023 that heightened worries about an impending recession was also a blessing in disguise for Bitcoin. This is because, during such a crisis, many investors saw the digital asset as a safer investment than some of the regional banks.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut most importantly, it\u2019s the renewed interest among large traditional financial institutions in crypto, including Bitcoin, that drove its prices northward. Financial bigwig BlackRock, Inc BLK, has applied, urging regulators to create a Bitcoin ETF. If the proposal gets accepted by the supervisory body, retail participation will increase and open opportunities for more institutional backing.\n\nSimilarly, financial heavyweights such as The Charles Schwab Corporation SCHW, Citadel Securities and Fidelity Digital Assets, to name a few, backed a new crypto exchange called EDX Markets. The exchange allows the trading of Bitcoin along with other prominent digital assets.\n\nCrypto Stocks to Make the Most of the Bitcoin Rally\n\nFrom an investment perspective, if you are looking to make money from Bitcoin\u2019s current upsurge, it would be judicious to approach it in a roundabout way, by keeping an eye on companies that make use of Bitcoin and technologies that support it, like blockchain.\n\nFirst on the list is HIVE Blockchain, which is one of the traded Bitcoin miners. As a thumb rule, miners do have negative margins when the price of Bitcoin falls below $20,000. But now, since the price is above this threshold, HIVE Blockchain\u2019s profit margins are positioned to improve.\n\nThe Canadian Bitcoin mining company posted solid financial results in June, while its shares have surged 248.7% so far this year, backed by the Bitcoin rally. In comparison, the broader S&P 500 Index has gained 17.1% in the same period.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHIVE Blockchain\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 54.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HIVE\u2019s current-year earnings has moved up 6.6% over the past 60 days. HIVE Blockchain has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.\n\nAnother Bitcoin mining company, Marathon Digital, is experiencing exponential growth this year. This is because Bitcoin miners\u2019 shares have a direct relationship with the price of Bitcoin. The profitability of Marathon Digital\u2019s mining operation will improve banking in the value of Bitcoin.\n\nShares of Marathon Digital outperformed the S&P 500 Index year to date, by gaining a whopping 348%.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMarathon Digital\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 113.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MARA\u2019s current-year earnings has moved up 525% over the past 60 days. Marathon Digital has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nAlso, Bitfarms specializing in mining Bitcoin, is expected to witness growth momentum soon. Its shares may have gained less than MARA stock, but it has reduced its debt considerably and has increased its mining capacity, which makes it all the more enticing for investors.\n\nBitfarms shares have skyrocketed 270.5% so far this year, thereby easily outdoing the S&P 500 Index.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBitfarms\u2019 expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 86.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BITF\u2019s current-year earnings has moved up 48.4% over the past 60 days.

        "title": "Bitcoin forks BCH, BSV and XEC soared last month, but are the gains organic and sustainable? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The start of June saw negative price action across the cryptocurrency market after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) brought fresh lawsuits against the world\u2019s largest exchanges, Binance and Coinbase.\n\nHowever, the sentiment quickly turned bullish after a crucial exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposal was filed by the world\u2019s largest asset management firm, BlackRock, on June 16. A wave of ETF fillings and institutional trading interest in digital assets followed BlackRock\u2019s ETF filling.\n\nThe launch of EDX Markets \u2014 backed by Wall Street giants Fidelity Investments, Citadel Securities and Charles Schwab \u2014 on June 20 fueled a particular sector of the market, that being Bitcoin forks like Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin SV (BSV) and other proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrencies like Kaspa (KAS).\n\nThe exchange debuted with Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and BCH. The inclusion of BCH catalyzed an uptrend across other Bitcoin forks.\n\nAmong the top gainers in June, three Bitcoin forks populated the list, followed by Kaspa and FLEX Coin (FLEX). FLEX benefited from its integration with Open Exchange (OPNX), which is backed by the co-founders of the bankrupt Three Arrows Capital fund.\n\nThe top five performing coins in June. Source: CoinGecko\n\nIn comparison, Bitcoin\u2019s monthly gains stood at 11.94%, as it traded above the $30,000 level for the first time since April 2023.\n\nFLEX Coin (FLEX) receives short-term boost from link with 3AC co-founders\n\nFLEX announced a transition to OPNX, a bankruptcy claims exchange, in May 2023. The token\u2019s price reached a 13-month high of $4.37 on June 27.\n\nOPNX is backed by the co-founders of now-bankrupt venture fund Three Arrows Capital. Reportedly, the co-founders face $1.3 billion in liability for actions that exacerbated the losses of the fund.\n\nStill, the duo continued to endorse OPNX under a new venture fund, using the same branding as their previous fund.\n\nFLEX was approved for a restructuring of its exchange by the Seychelles courts on March 6. Its integration with Open Exchange imparts utility to the FLEX token in OPNX to settle claims and earn staking rewards.\n\nNotably, as the FLEX price surged to 2022 peak levels, the trading volumes remained subdued at around 0.01% of the $1 billion daily volume it was generating at its peak, which raises a red flag.\n\nIt represents a case of significant volatility in illiquid assets. Due to limited liquidity, traders can more easily push up the price of these coins compared to larger, more liquid assets.\n\nTechnically, the 2022 breakdown level of around $5.08 and all-time-high level of $7.56 will act as resistance levels to the upside. The token faces 80% downside risk to $0.75, which represents the accumulation level in May 2023.\n\nFLEX price chart. Source: CoinGecko\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) riding the EDX Markets uptrend\n\nBCH\u2019s price more than doubled in June following its listing on EDX Markets. BCH was one of the four cryptocurrencies that debuted on the platform alongside BTC, ETH, and LTC.\n\nWhile the EDX listing acted as a positive catalyst, negative funding across perpetual swap markets and potential market manipulation on South Korean exchange Upbit are also the primary drivers of the recent uptrend.\n\nFunding rate for BCH perpetual swaps. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe token\u2019s price witnessed a combined liquidation of $21 million in June, according to an update from crypto analytics outlet The TIE. The levels are significantly higher than usual, when the \u201cdaily liquidations total tens of thousands of dollars, if anything.\u201d\n\nThe total fees paid on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain have ranged lower than $200 since the start of the year, indicating that the blockchain\u2019s usage has been limited.\n\nIn comparison, Litecoin, which provides a similar utility, generates around 10 times larger revenue for the miners in fees than BCH. The poor fundamentals and high liquidation levels raise a red flag on the sustainability of the recent gains.\n\nThe total fees paid on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. Source: CoinMetrics\n\nBSV rides the BCH wave despite poor fundamentals\n\nBCH and BSV have a strong correlation of 0.78, which appears to be the reason why BSV enjoyed 31.4% gains in June.\n\nBSV has been in a consistent downtrend since 2022, as interest in the blockchain faded after the crypto bull market and its trading volumes dried up.\n\nThe coin made an all-time low of $21.43 on June 10 before catching the BCH bullish tide and staging an up move.\n\nIts poor performance drove miners away from its ecosystem, making a 51% attack relatively cheaper on Bitcoin SV \u2014 a one-hour attack requiring less than $2,000 compared to $1.4 million for Bitcoin, which makes Bitcoin SV vulnerable.\n\nBSV daily price action. Source: CoinGecko\n\nRelated: \u2018Bitcoin Jesus\u2019 says Ethereum is the front-runner for global crypto adoption\n\nKaspa (KAS) benefits from improved performance and low liquidity\n\nKaspa is a PoW consensus-based blockchain network similar to Bitcoin and Litecoin.\n\nKaspa offers a high throughput of one block per second compared to one block per 10 minutes for Bitcoin. Kaspa Labs, the team building the blockchain, also hinted at the launch of a public testnet that will enhance its scalability 10,000 times, which appears to be fueling its market sentiments.\n\nHowever, the token is primarily traded on unregulated exchanges with low trading volumes and low trust scores, according to CoinGecko. This makes the cryptocurrency susceptible to high volatility and manipulation.\n\nTechnically, if the bullish momentum continues, KAS will look to retest 2023 highs of around $0.40. On the downside, the token faces the risk of a correction toward the yearly lows of around $0.15.\n\nWhile the token exhibits illiquid market signs, making it susceptible to volatility, and faces tough competition from large PoW networks like Bitcoin and Litecoin, its one-year price action has been positive, with higher highs and higher lows.\n\nKAS daily price chart. Source: CoinGecko\n\neCash (XEC) joins BSV and BCH in a Bitcoin fork-rally\n\nCryptocurrency eCash (XEC) is a rebranded version of a tertiary Bitcoin fork, Bitcoin Cash ABC, which was another fork of Bitcoin Cash, like Bitcoin SV.\n\nSimilar to BCH and BSV, XEC also rode the positive tide that lifted all boats in the BTC fork category.\n\nSimilar to Bitcoin SV, eCash lacks fundamental value and exhibits volatility due to illiquid market conditions. The token is listed on a few top exchanges like Binance and Bithumb. However, it has yet to be supported on any United States-based exchange, which raises a red flag.\n\nThe rise of tokens with low liquidity and loosely based narratives suggest that there could be some price manipulation in these tokens that is influencing their short-term price. The long-term value proposition of Bitcoin forks remains questionable, with low utility and security.\n\nMoreover, the cryptocurrency market is still suffering from the adverse impacts of the SEC\u2019s cases. The tokens regarded as securities, such as Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC) and Flow (FLOW), all posted more than a 20% loss over the month.\n\nAs the markets struggle with legal challenges, building bullish narratives has been difficult. Given that Bitcoin is leading the market, its price action will be crucial in determining the direction of altcoins.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Source: Coin Metrics\n\nBitcoin miners receive transaction fees whenever a new block has been validated \u2014 the amount of which is determined by the data volume and user demand for block space.\n\nCoin Metrics said the jump in fees was due to Bitcoin\u2019s recent price surge bolstering \u201ctop-line revenues\u201d and the advent of BRC-20 \u2014 a new token standard on Bitcoin network introduced in March to mint and transfer fungible tokens like Ordinals inscriptions \u2014 adding:\n\n\u201cThe token standard does unlock experimental new use cases for Bitcoin\u2019s core transaction types and accelerates the push to scale Bitcoin with the Lightning Network.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that transaction fees represented only 7.7% of the total $2.4 billion made by miners over the quarter.\n\nThe remainder came from Bitcoin block rewards, with miners currently rewarded 6.25 BTC for solving each block. This is set to fall to 3.125 BTC after the network\u2019s next halving, which is expected to occur around May 2024.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin miners send record $128M in revenue to exchanges\n\nBitcoin miners also had other reasons to celebrate in Q2, according to the firm.\n\nIn May, the Bitcoin mining industry \u201cnotched a win\u201d with the blocking of United States President Joe Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s proposed Digital Asset Mining Energy tax.\n\nIn this special edition of State of the Network, we take a data-driven look at the most important events that impacted the digital assets industry from Q2 2023.\n\n\n\nGet the insights here: https://t.co/xpcE27j1Fz#FutureofFinance #PutTruthtoWork pic.twitter.com/67RDHKA2bT \u2014 CoinMetrics.io (@coinmetrics) July 5, 2023\n\nBitcoin miners also enjoyed easier macroeconomics conditions in the quarter, with \u201creceding inflation pressures\u201d translating to lower electricity prices for U.S.-based miners, Coin Metrics noted.\n\nHowever, with Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate continuing to reach new all-time highs over the last 12 months, competition in the mining fee market is also tightening, Coin Metrics explained:\n\n\u201cCompetition remains as fierce as ever, with Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate breaking new highs during the quarter at 375 EH/s [...] We see that the overall network\u2019s efficiency continues to increase with the adoption of modern ASICs such as the S19 XP.\u201d\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin 2023 in Miami comes to grips with \u2018shitcoins on Bitcoin\u2019"

        "title": "Bitcoin mining stocks outperform BTC in 2023, but on-chain data points to a potential stall - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin mining companies outperformed Bitcoin by a huge margin amid the recent bullish price action in the top cryptocurrency.\n\nThe average year-to-date stock price gains in 2023 among the top nine public Bitcoin mining firms by market capitalization stood at 257.14%. The figure is almost three times higher than Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) gain in the same period.\n\nThe higher gains represent the leveraged beta effect that mining stocks enjoy. Leveraged beta suggests that during Bitcoin upside, these stocks outperform, whereas when Bitcoin slumps, they face deeper downside risk.\n\nDue to its high leveraged beta, Bitcoin\u2019s price performance will remain a crucial factor in determining the direction of mining stocks.\n\nThe trends within the mining sector show that miners are positioning themselves for the long term by buying more machines. However, they have yet to exhibit accumulation levels that match previous bull markets, suggesting that the uptrend in the stocks could stall in the medium term.\n\nPerformance of listed Bitcoin mining stocks. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nMultiple mining companies expanded in the past month, which added to the positive sentiments and long-term value of the stocks. At the same time, the mining conditions improved with a dip in hash rate and an increase in price.\n\nHowever, on-chain data shows miners unloaded a significant portion of their holdings, which could be a sign of a downturn in the near future.\n\nMining companies make expansive moves\n\nThe public mining companies in the United States made aggressive moves in June, signaling long-term strength in the industry.\n\nHut 8 Mining (HUT8) merged with US Bitcoin Corp (USBTC), increasing its total hash rate to 9.8 EH/s, making it the third-largest public mining entity in the United States. However, it also borrowed $50 million from Coinbase for general corporate purposes.\n\nCleanspark (CLSK) invested $9.3 million to increase its hash rate by almost 1 EH/s.\n\nAt the same time, Riot Blockchain (RIOT) entered into a $170 million deal with mining hardware manufacturer MicroBT to nearly double its hash rate capacity by 2024 upon full deployment.\n\nBitcoin holdings of public mining companies. Source: Mining Mag\n\nMining stocks are prepped for a short squeeze\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings (MARA) is one of the most shorted stocks on the Nasdaq, with 25.06% of its float shares shorted, per data from Fintel. For reference, values above 10% are considered heavily shorted.\n\nSimilarly, 14.54% of Riot's float shares are shorted \u2014 an increase from 13.48% in May \u2014 and Cipher Mining (CIFR) is at 22.32%.\n\nThe rest have between 5% and 10% of their floating shares shorted, representing a relatively neutral market stance.\n\nThe increased short interest in MARA, RIOT and CIFR could be due to excessive debt and stock dilution, which negatively affects the profitability of existing shareholders.\n\nMining profits improve, but miners are selling\n\nThe one-hop supply metric from Coin Metrics, representing the holdings of wallets that received coins from mining pools, shows that these addresses have reduced their holdings to a near one-year low.\n\nBitcoin miner one-hop supply. Source: Coin Metrics\n\nGlassnode data also recorded a significant volume of miner coins transferred to exchanges. The exchange inflows surpassed even the levels seen during the bull market of 2021.\n\n#Bitcoin Miners are currently recording extremely high Exchange interaction, sending an ATH of $128M to Exchanges, equivalent to 315% of their daily revenue.\n\n\n\nhttps://t.co/O78r5MY34f pic.twitter.com/MR5b9Au7AA \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) June 27, 2023\n\nMoreover, the miner holdings are still near a two-year low, which is likely due to low profitability for the most part of 2023.\n\nThe network\u2019s total hash rate reached a new all-time high at the start of June. However, it has been dropping amid heat waves in Texas. The dropping hash rate and increase in Bitcoin\u2019s price above $30,000 is contributing to increasing the profitability of running miners.\n\nThe production cost of the most used mining model, the Antminer S19, ranges from $20,000 to $25,000, depending on electricity cost.\n\nNotably, companies with mining farms in Texas such as Riot can incur some losses due to the climate. However, it is likely that the companies would have taken steps to hedge the heat wave risks, as it is not the first time they've experienced heat waves.\n\nRelated: Riot Blockchain's Bitcoin mining productivity dropped 28% YOY amid record Texas heat\n\nNevertheless, despite the improvement in profitability, miners are unloading Bitcoin, potentially a sign of future negative price action.\n\nWhile revenue improved in June, miners have continued to spend on expansion and operation costs, which suggests that a crypto bull market has yet to start.\n\nThe expansion plans of companies and the decline in on-chain miner holdings project medium-term sideways price action or a potential correction in mining stocks if the BTC price drops.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Bitcoin dips to trade flat; Solana gains; Polygon, BNB lead losers - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether traded little changed on Wednesday morning in Asia, while the rest of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were mixed. Bitcoin fell back under US$31,000, but its dominance in total crypto market cap is gaining, a sign of market recovery. Solana added to its gains this week, while Polygon\u2019s Matic and the BNB tokens led the daily losers list. Bitcoin Cash has taken the number 12 spot in the list of top tokens by market cap after its listing on the new EDX Markets exchange.\n\nCrypto price pause\n\nBitcoin fell 1.0% over the last 24 hours to US$30,801 at 07:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, shaving its weekly gain down to 0.39%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. On Tuesday, the price of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency reached US$31,371, its highest since June 2022, on the back of optimism about spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund applications by a raft of Wall Street heavyweights, including Blackrock.\n\nThe level of Bitcoin dominance sits near 50%, which is the highest since April 2021. Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, says this price uptrend in Bitcoin is a typical market recovery pattern in which the most significant asset in the sector attracts buyers first.\n\n\u201cIt will probably take about a year of Bitcoin price recovery before crypto enthusiasts start looking for one with higher risk, pushing altcoins higher and leading to a new wave of capitalisation swell,\u201d said Kuptsikevich, in an email statement. He said he doesn\u2019t see altcoins rallying before November.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent price recovery was sparked by Blackrock, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, filing an application last month to launch a Bitcoin ETF and refiling it again after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicated it lacked details.\n\nSeveral other U.S.-based asset managers, such as Fidelity Investments and WisdomTree, have filed their own Bitcoin ETFs, suggesting mainstream finance recognizes the Bitcoin opportunity and wants to offer clients the access to its price movements without actually owning the token.\n\nEther, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, looked to be on a run to break US$2,000 this week, but fell back 0.81% to US$1,941 today after a gain of 2.64% for the past seven days.\n\nThe other top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization traded mixed to flat, with Solana leading gainers with a 2.0% rise to US$19.45. The token has surged 15.35% in the past week.\n\nPolygon\u2019s Matic and Binance\u2019s BNB token were amongst the losers \u2014 Matic lost 1.99% to US$0.6981, though it\u2019s still up 4.29% for the week. BNB lost 1.68% to US$242.83, cutting its weekly gain to 1.81%.\n\nAltcoins have suffered from the SEC\u2019s crackdown on tokens that they deem financial securities. Solana, Cardano, Polygon and BNB were among those that the regulator named as unregistered securities in its lawsuits filed against the Coinbase and Binance.US exchanges in early June.\n\nWhile these altcoins have partially recovered after an initial plunge following the SEC suits, several trading platforms including California-based Robinhood Markets Inc., Israel-based eToro and UK\u2019s Revolut ceased support or limited access to some of these tokens for their U.S.-based customers.\n\nBitcoin Cash climbed to become the twelfth largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrency by market capitalization on CoinMarketCap at US$53.8 billion. The Bitcoin spin-off is one of the four cryptocurrencies listed on EDX Markets, the Wall Street-backed, compliance-focused crypto exchange that launched on June 20 in the U.S.\n\nBitcoin Cash had a market capitalization of US$20.6 billion and was valued at US$106.34 on June 19. It has since surged 160% to US$276.87. It dipped 1.70% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap fell 0.80% to US$1.21 trillion in the last 24 hours, while crypto trading volume fell 22.22% to US$31.14 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nAzuki dents NFT sentiment\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index rose 1.28% in the 24 hours to 07:45 a.m. in Hong Kong to 2,783.58, but logged a loss of 3.17% for the week. The two Forkast indexes measuring the performance of Ethereum and Polygon NFT markets rose.\n\nHowever, despite moderate gains in the indexes on Wednesday morning, the NFT market overall remains in a downtrend, said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\n\u201cThe Forkast 500 NFT Index reflects declining sales prices across collections on all chains, but it\u2019s Ethereum that\u2019s really dragging the market down with it,\u201d said Petscher, pointing to the recent problems with the Azuki NFT collection.\n\n\u201cAzuki\u2019s struggles exasperated the already struggling market \u2026 Azuki\u2019s new Elementals mint was supposed to be a boom for NFTs and instead was a bust, becoming a catalyst that drove NFT collections down to all-time lows.\u201d\n\nAzuki NFT creator Chiru Labs debuted its latest Elementals collection last Tuesday, to much negative response from the community, who deemed it almost identical to the original Azuki collection.\n\nWhile the team behind Azuki posted an public apology to buyers on Twitter, dissatisfied Azuki holders formed the Azuki DAO last week and passed a vote on Monday to launch a lawsuit against Chiru Labs, claiming the 20,000 ETH (US$39 million) the company holds should be returned to the DAO.\n\nLegalDAO, the decentralized autonomous organization formed in 2020 by a group of legal professionals, said Tuesday that it will help Azuki DAO in the effort to claim the 20,000 ETH.\n\nBy NFT collections, Bored Ape Yacht Club topped the trading volume rankings on Cryptoslam with US$3 million, but the volume was down 18.97% on the day. Mutant Ape Yacht Club, another Yuga Labs\u2019 Ethereum-based collection, saw its volume grow 11.94% to US$2.39 million to place second in the rankings.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume dropped 9.24% to US$31.5 million. Volume on Ethereum fell 9.17% to US$22.7 million according to Cryptoslam data. Volume on the Bitcoin network gained 3.73% to US$3.19 million, while volumes on Polygon, Solana and BNB all plunged.\n\nU.S. equity futures drop during holiday\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures dipped as of 10:45 a.m. in Hong Kong ahead of the restart of trading in the U.S. following the July 4 public holiday.\n\nFutures on all three indexes \u2013 Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq \u2013 declined but by less than 1%.\n\nAsian equities opened lower Wednesday morning. The Shanghai Composite fell 0.5%, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng dipped 1.3%, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index edged down 0.3%. South Korea\u2019s Kospi also lost 0.08%.\n\nThe Caixin China General Composite purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) \u2014 a measure of the performance of both the manufacturing and services sectors in China \u2014 dropped to 52.5 in June from 55.6 the previous month. This marks the sixth consecutive month of expansion for China\u2019s private sector. However, the growth rate was the slowest since January.\n\nEmployment in China also returned to growth, as the service sector created more jobs following a drop in manufacturing payrolls, according to Trading Economics.\n\nIn the U.S., New York Federal Reserve President John Williams\u2019 speaks on Wednesday and may provide an update on the Fed\u2019s view of inflation. The Fed will also release its June meeting minutes on Wednesday, where it decided to leave interest rates unchanged between 5% and 5.25%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s next meeting on rates is July 26. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 87.4% chance for a 25-basis-point rate increase, down from 89.9% on Tuesday. The likelihood the Fed won\u2019t increase is now at just 12.6%.\n\n(Updates to add equities section)"

        "content": "\n\n\n\nThe BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has expressed bullish sentiments towards crypto, specifically Bitcoin, as the asset manager reapplies to list a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. Fink's remarks came during an interview on July 5, where he highlighted the role of crypto in digitising gold and urged U.S. regulators to consider the potential democratisation of finance through a Bitcoin-linked ETF.\n\n\n\nDescribing Bitcoin as an \"international asset,\" Fink emphasised its independence from any single currency, making it an attractive alternative for investors. He suggested that Bitcoin could hedge against inflation or the devaluation of certain currencies. As the CEO of BlackRock, the world's largest asset management firm with over $9 trillion in assets under management, Fink's endorsement of cryptos could have significant implications for the industry.\n\nFink's remarks were met with positive reactions from crypto users on social media, with some speculating that his statements could trigger a surge in asset prices, dubbing it the \"Fink Pump.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBlackRock has been actively pursuing the launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF, partnering with crypto exchange Coinbase as a surveillance partner. It remains to be seen whether the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve the investment vehicle, as it has previously rejected all spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF by the SEC and the support of industry giants like BlackRock could have a transformative impact on the crypto market. A Bitcoin ETF would provide institutional investors with a regulated and accessible avenue to invest in Bitcoin, potentially driving further adoption and mainstream acceptance of cryptos.\n\n\n\n\n\nFink's position as the CEO of a prominent financial institution gives weight to his statements, potentially influencing both market participants and regulators. The increasing interest in cryptos among traditional financial institutions underscores the changing landscape and the growing acknowledgement of the potential of digital assets.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe future trajectory of the crypto market will heavily depend on regulatory developments and institutional involvement as it continues to mature.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe writer is the founder at yMedia.

We\u2019ve also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this article began. According to Wikipedia, a cryptocurrency is \u201ca digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.\u201d\n\nBitcoin was the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Ether is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three with its launch in July 2015. XRP, which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We\u2019ve included it here for reference.\n\nThe third-largest market share of cryptocurrency, tether, is a token \u201cbacked by actual assets\u201d which includes one US dollar, one euro, or loans to affiliate companies and is controlled by the owners of Bitfinex. It\u2019s a controversial cryptocurrency due to its alleged manipulation of crypto pricing. It is called a \u201cstable coin\u201d because it was designed to always be worth $1.00. We do not chart it because its price rarely changes.\n\nThe Latest Crypto Data (through July 4, 2023): Bitcoin, Ether, and XRP\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rally continued for a third straight week as the digital currency briefly crossed $31,000 during this past week. BTC is now up ~84% year to date.\n\nXRP dropped slightly from last week and is currently up ~41% year-to-date.\n\nEther\u2019s rallied continued for a second straight week and is currently up ~59% year-to-date.\n\nAn index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. Ether tops the chart, i.e., the price of an ether has changed the most out of all three cryptocurrencies.\n\nETFs associated with cryptocurrencies include: ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) and ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITI).\n\nOriginally published on Advisor Perspectives.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel."

        "title": "Replacing The World's Preferred Store Of Value, Bitcoin Will Make Housing Affordable Again - Nasdaq",
        "content": "This is an opinion editorial by Leon Wankum, a HODLer who is active in real estate and venture capital with a master\u2019s degree in financial economics.\n\nOn August 15, 1971, U.S. President Richard Nixon announced that the United States would end the convertibility of the U.S. dollar into gold. Since then, central banks around the world have started operating a fiat-based monetary system with floating exchange rates and no currency standards at all. The money supply has been rising steadily ever since. This forced market participants to look for ways to invest their money to protect against this inflation and one of the most popular investment assets has been real estate.\n\nIn the past, people owned real estate for its utility value, which is characterized by the fact that you can live on it or use it for production. Nowadays, however, it serves the world as the primary asset to store value. Around 67% of global wealth ($ 330T) is stored in real estate. This has pushed up real estate prices enormously and, with that, the cost of housing and the cost of living.\n\nHome Value Change Vs. Income Change\n\nThe chart below shows the increase in wages in the U.S. from 1965 to 2021 compared to the increase in housing prices. It shows that real estate prices have risen excessively.\n\nAs a result, it is no longer possible for most people to afford their own home. In addition, regulation and inflation have made construction significantly more expensive, for example, due to the increased building requirements because of so-called \u201cESG\u201d guidelines and the increase in raw material prices. Property owners pass this price increase onto tenants in the form of increased rents.\n\n\n\nFrom Utility To Speculation\n\nReal estate has become a speculative investment object because it is used as a store of value, a former function of money that is no longer possible due to decades of monetary inflation that has decimated peoples' purchasing power.\n\nThe exorbitant increase in housing costs is one of the biggest problems of the fiat-based financial system because it has created a multitude of secondary problems. When the number-one store of value in the world, real estate, becomes increasingly expensive, and thus inaccessible, people can no longer save and plan for the future. When house prices and rents become increasingly expensive while money loses purchasing power, people can no longer afford adequate housing, leading to a deterioration in living standards.\n\nIn addition, aside from being used to store value, real estate is the most commonly used form of collateral in the traditional banking system. It is frequently used by a borrower to secure the repayment of a loan to a lender. Banks lend to people and institutions that own real estate. This has created an exclusive financial system as real estate has become unaffordable. In an inflationary environment where money loses value over time, it is a problem if most cannot borrow because saving is not an efficient way to accumulate capital. Debt becomes necessary to be productive.\n\nThese developments, which can be observed worldwide, are among the main drivers of wealth inequality.\n\nFrom Speculation To Utility\n\nReal estate should be reduced to its utility value as a dwelling or place of production, rather than used as a store of value by proxy if we ever hope to solve the growing gap in wealth inequality. Since bitcoin is a nearly perfect store of value, it offers a straightforward solution to the housing crisis.\n\nThe properties associated with bitcoin make it an ideal store of value. The supply is finite. It is easily portable, divisible, durable, fungible, censorship-resistant and noncustodial. Real estate cannot compete with bitcoin as a store of value. Bitcoin is rarer, more liquid, easier to move, harder to confiscate and cheaper to maintain. You don\u2019t have to worry about daily maintenance, rent or repairs. It is easily accessible and cheap to store.\n\nYou can buy any amount large or small. You can self-custody bitcoin. All you need to store it safely is a basic computer without internet access and a BIP39 key generator - or a $50 hardware wallet.\n\nPeople can buy bitcoin to store value instead of doing so through a home or rental property. As a result, real estate prices will fall and allow people to afford buying a home for its utility value.\n\nBitcoin Presents A Solution\n\nAs explained in a recent episode of \u201cThe Hard Money Show,\u201d real estate has become a store of value in a world where fiat currencies are losing power, with many negative implications for society. But Bitcoin presents a solution.\n\nAs Bitcoin adoption increases, the money that would otherwise be invested in real estate, and some that is already invested in real estate, will flow into bitcoin. As pointed out above, this will make housing affordable.\n\nBy functioning as an actual store of value, bitcoin will absorb the monetary premium that real estate has accumulated over the past decades due to the broken monetary system. Under a Bitcoin standard, housing will eventually collapse to its utility value. The easy access to Bitcoin will create a financial system that is far more accessible than it is today.\n\nUnfortunately, this will not solve the problem of rising rents in the short term. This is a structural problem of the fiat system. Due to the ever-increasing supply of money, it loses purchasing power over time and prices rise. However, as our financial system adjusts to a Bitcoin standard, deflation will cause prices to fall.\n\nIt should also lead to a more decentralized and less regulatory form of governance, as governments increasingly become service providers.\n\nThis is a guest post by Leon Wankum.

        "title": "Can Bitcoin repeat a 2017-like rally as dollar correlation reverses? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "There is a common belief that when the U.S. dollar declines relative to other main global currencies, as measured by the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), the impact on Bitcoin is positive, and vice versa.\n\nFor instance, the DXY dropped from 103.0 in January 2017 to a 92.6 low in August 2017, while Bitcoin (BTC) rallied from $1,000 to $4,930 in the same period. But is there enough evidence to justify a bull run similar to 2016\u201317, as some analysts are arguing?\n\nIs the Bitcoin-dollar inverse trend real?\n\nTraders and influencers frequently warn about this negative correlation and how a reversal of the DXY will likely push the Bitcoin price higher.\n\nInvestment researcher Game of Trades recently posted a chart presenting the pattern in early 2023 and then again in May. There\u2019s some indisputable evidence of the inverse correlation there.\n\nBitcoin and DXY have maintained a negative correlation year-to-date in 2023 pic.twitter.com/VTePX3PNs6 \u2014 Game of Trades (@GameofTrades_) June 22, 2023\n\nMoreover, technical analyst Moustache presents a bearish \u201cGaussian Channel\u201d change on the DXY chart, which, according to the analysis, matched two previous bull runs for Bitcoin and altcoins in 2016\u201317 and 2020\u201321.\n\n#Bitcoin\n\n\n\nThe DXY (US Dollar Index) has changed the color from green to red on the Gaussian Channel.\n\n\n\nThe last two times this happened, $BTC and Altcoins experienced a bullrun (parabola) in the following months (2016-2017 and 2020-2021).\n\n\n\nSounds exciting, doesn't it? pic.twitter.com/kHJeM6iZDH \u2014 \u24d7 (@el_crypto_prof) June 26, 2023\n\nBTC-DXY correlation varies with time\n\nThe seemingly inverse relationship between Bitcoin and the DXY has never lasted more than seven weeks. The correlation indicator runs from negative 100%, indicating that certain markets move in opposite ways, to positive 100%, indicating that the movement is in lockstep; 0 represents a total lack of correlation between the two assets.\n\nDXY 20-day correlation versus Bitcoin. Source: TradingView\n\nThe metric has been negative for 81% of the past 670 days, indicating that DXY and Bitcoin have generally followed an inverse trend. Still, that\u2019s not how the correlation metric works, because readings between 0% and negative 50% denote a lack of correlation.\n\nIn fact, the longest-ever period of a correlation lower than negative 50% was the 47 days starting on Aug. 18, 2022. Therefore, saying that Bitcoin has an inverse correlation to the DXY would be statistically incoherent since it was negative 50% or lower for less than a third of the days since September 2021.\n\nBetween June 2021 and November 2021, the DXY and the BTC price presented a very similar pattern, as both rallied during that five-month period.\n\nEvents solely relevant to the cryptocurrency might have distorted the metric, however, such as the first Bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund in the United States, launched on Oct. 19, 2021.\n\nDXY (orange, left) versus Bitcoin (blue, right), 2021. Source: TradingView\n\nBut regardless of the rationale behind the move, correlation is not causation, meaning it is impossible to conclude that DXY\u2019s positive performance affected Bitcoin's price during the period.\n\nRelated: Will BlackRock\u2019s ETF slingshot Bitcoin\u2019s price skyward?\n\nLonger-term analysis still required for DXY\n\nEven though analysts and market influencers frequently use 20-day correlation data to explain daily price fluctuations, a longer time frame is required to comprehend potential, if any, effects of DXY on Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nFor instance, when the U.S. Federal Reserve injects trillion-dollar stimulus packages into the economy, odds are the impact on inflation and global currency flows will take a couple of weeks. After all, not every family, business and financial institution will put the money into circulation right away.\n\nBut the price signals on the Bitcoin market are more immediate, as coins are traded 24/7. So the price movements are extremely susceptible to news, macroeconomic data and geopolitical events, with reverberating effects for weeks and even months.\n\nA perfect example can be demonstrated by Bitcoin\u2019s 38% loss in nine days on June 8, 2022.\n\nDXY (orange, left) versus Bitcoin (blue, right), 2022. Source: TradingView\n\nNotice how it took almost four months for the DXY to move from 102.50 to the 114.2 peak in late September 2022, even though Bitcoin had already bottomed at $18,900 long before that.\n\nDXY a poor proxy for BTC price\n\nIn other words, those betting on a DXY reversal preceding a BTC price rally have no statistical support, given that the correlation varies over time.\n\nMoreover, even when the inverse correlation happens, there may be a gap between Bitcoin\u2019s immediate price action and the longer-term trends of the U.S. Dollar Index.\n\nWhenever favorable (or unfavorable) developments in the cryptocurrency industry occur, the historical correlation becomes irrelevant. That might have been the case for the recent Bitcoin gains, which can\u2019t be directly attributed to the supposed \u201cGaussian Channel\u201d reversion on the DXY chart.\n\nUltimately, cherry-picking two or three instances of the DXY inverse correlation happening while a cryptocurrency bull run occurred in the past is not enough to call a bull run similar to 2016\u201317, considering the multiple instances of positive correlation and gaps between both assets\u2019 price action.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Bipa, a Brazilian startup aiming to simplify financial transactions through Bitcoin, has announced the successful closure of its seed investment round, raising R$8 million (approximately $1.4 million).\n\nNotable investors include New Form Capital. a venture capital fund focused on early-stage startups involved with blockchain technology and the financial market and Hivemind Ventures, which invests in startups with a Bitcoin focus, which both made their first investment in the Brazilian market through this round.\n\nFounded in 2020 by Luiz Parreira, Bipa seeks to eliminate entry barriers and promote the use of bitcoin by providing a user-friendly digital account connected to instant payment networks PIX (Brazilian real) and Lightning (bitcoin). According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, the startup aims to attract users who find the process of buying and selling Bitcoin challenging and struggle to understand exchange operations, catering to a broader audience seeking simplicity and convenience.\n\nThe press release stated that the funds raised will support Bipa's expansion in the market, attracting new users and developing new business-to-consumer (B2C) products. Parreira said, \"Our mission is to make people using the Bipa application pay for coffee every morning.\" Currently, bitcoin usage remains niche in Brazil, with Bipa's primary focus on the local community. However, the company plans to broaden its reach and bring the financial and technological revolution of bitcoin to more individuals.\n\nTo coincide with its growth plans, Bipa has unveiled a new visual identity, emphasizing its accessibility and simplicity. The redesigned brand features a spring-shaped \"B\" logo, symbolizing impulse, and employs a lively and colorful palette. Parreira hopes that the rebranding efforts and improved user experience will encourage individuals outside the current Bitcoin ecosystem to join Bipa, with the goal of bringing over 15 million Brazilians into the Bitcoin community.\n\nAccording to data from the Investor X-Ray report by the Brazilian Association of Financial and Capital Market Entities (Anbima), approximately 6 million Brazilians, around 3% of the population, declare investments in cryptocurrencies. With this investment round, Bipa aims to tap into this market potential and become the go-to option for those seeking an entry point into the bitcoin industry.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Hong Kong wants to become an international crypto hub even as jurisdictions like the US cast a wary eye on the sector. In August, the first licenses were issued under a new system to regulate crypto exchanges offering trading in tokens like Bitcoin and Ether. The regime is part of Hong Kong\u2019s effort to attract fresh capital and talent back to the city, after its reputation was tarnished by years of harsh Covid-19 curbs and a crackdown on political dissent. Initial reaction was largely positive from digital-asset firms, but there was a lack of major new investment pledges. Hong Kong\u2019s push appears to have quiet backing from Beijing even as mainland China sticks with a ban on crypto trading.\n\nThe new rules mean that retail investors can trade coins on exchanges licensed by the city\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission. Hong Kong says its approach is high on consumer protection, with strict criteria on which virtual assets can be bought and sold. Some of the factors that platforms must consider when deciding on tokens to offer include how long a coin has been in circulation, its market capitalization and average daily trading volume. The tokens must also be incorporated in at least two cryptocurrency indexes from prominent institutions, one with a background in traditional finance. In addition, the SFC mandates that crypto firms must put other safeguards in place before accepting customers, like assessing if users have essential knowledge of digital assets before investing, and setting trading or position limits \u201cwith reference to the client\u2019s financial situation.\u201d"

The advent of large language learning models like ChatGPT has blown open the potential for AI and AGI to overhaul many industries and fundamentally change how humans carry out a litany of tasks.\n\nRelated: AI-related crypto returns rose up to 41% after ChatGPT launched: Study\n\nArdoino believes the future of humanity may well involve the merger of humans and AI through bionic elements and \u201caugmented brain capacity.\u201d He highlighted Elon Musk\u2019s Neuralink as a prime example of efforts to explore the possibility of enhanced cognition powered by AI technology.\n\nPointing to movies like The Matrix as popular representations of what a dystopian AI-ruled future might look like, Ardoino suggested that AGI would naturally choose Bitcoin over centralized currencies:\n\n\u201cA machine will always choose something that is fully decentralized that no one can control. If machines have to pay for electricity to work, they will always use something that humans cannot control, and they will use Bitcoin, in my opinion.\u201d\n\nThe chief technology officer of Tether, the company behind the largest United States dollar-backed stablecoin by market cap, Tether (USDT), also suggested that AI would not use USDT because of its centralized nature.\n\nThe possibility of a future in which humanity coexists alongside AI in whatever shape or form could be as close as 20 or 30 years away, according to Ardoino. However, this could be determined by differing focuses on reverse aging instead of incorporating AI and bionic elements into humans to augment their physical and mental capabilities.\n\n\u201cThe future tells me that we are going toward augmented intelligence that will end up with AI co-mingling with normal brains. Maybe that is the future of humanity.\u201d\n\nThe likes of BlackRock \u2014 the world\u2019s largest asset manager \u2014 have earmarked the AI ecosystem as a prime investment opportunity, given its \u201cdisruptive\u201d nature.

And both applications state that Nasdaq would \u201creceive market data for orders and trades from Coinbase\u201d as part of the agreement, while also being able to request information when necessary to investigate potential manipulation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile BlackRock has listed Coinbase Custody Trust Company and BNY Mellon as custodians that would respectively hold on to its ETF\u2019s Bitcoin and cash, Valkyrie simply states that it \u201cwill enter into a custodian agreement\u201d with a qualified custodian.\n\nWhen Valkyrie updated the filing for its Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund in a fresh prospectus in June, the firm removed Coinbase Custody Trust Company as the fund\u2019s specified custodian. For its ETF, it wrote in the filing, shares would trade under the ticker name \u201cBRRR.\u201d"

Sometimes referred to as \u201cthe halvening\u201d, the seismic event is built-in to bitcoin\u2019s technological foundations, and is aimed at making the digital currency anti-inflationary by reducing its supply.\n\n\u201cThe months prior to the halving have historically seen the start of a bullish trend for the market, hence the market participants are carefully looking at the second half of 2023,\u201d Matteo Greco, a research analyst at the fintech investment firm Fineqia International, told The Independent.\n\n\u201cRiot Platforms, an industry leader in bitcoin mining and data centre hosting, announced a $162 million investment to purchase 33,280 miners, aiming to nearly double its computational power in anticipation of the next halving.\u201d\n\nView more\n\nMr Greco pointed to the cryptocurrency litecoin, once referred to as the silver to bitcoin\u2019s gold, which typically experiences its halving event a few months before its more famous rival.\n\nIn the months leading up to Litecoin\u2019s halvings in 2015 and 2019 its price saw massive gains, which were then replicated by bitcoin.\n\nLitecoin\u2019s next halving is currently scheduled for 3 August 2023 and it is once again experiencing a significant price increase, outperforming broader market trends.\n\n\u201cLitecoin often served as a sentiment metric on the bitcoin halving,\u201d Mr Greco said. \u201cThe big increase in price, while most of the altcoins keep lagging, suggests bullish sentiment is increasing ahead of the next BTC halving.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s halving is currently scheduled for 26 April, 2024, with pseudonymous crypto trader PlanB noting another historic price trend that could signal more gains over the coming months.\n\n\u201cBuy bitcoin six months before a halving and sell 18 months after a halving has historically beaten \u2018buy and hold\u2019 [trading strategy],\u201d he tweeted on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe next halving is in April 2024... Will this strategy work again?\u201d"

Maybe.\n\nYears later, though, he admitted that Bitcoin was a \u201cgreat asset\u201d and that BlackRock had, in fact, made money from investing in the digital currency. He has continued to say that the asset would grow.\n\nHi you. Yes, you. Want to win some Ordinals?

A spot Bitcoin ETF does not yet exist in the U.S., and the SEC has launched a tough crackdown on the digital asset industry. But experts think BlackRock has a chance: the asset manager has had nearly every single one of its ETF applications approved by the regulator.\n\nBitcoin is currently trading for $30,446 per coin, according to CoinGecko data. At the start of the year, it was priced at less than $17,000."

        "title": "Heating a home with a Bitcoin miner: Staying warm with sats - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) miners emit a lot of heat.\n\nSome miners use that heat to warm swimming pools, dehydrate meat to make beef jerky or even dry out timber at a Swedish hydropower Bitcoin farm. In Ireland, the \u201cBitcoin Farmer\u201d joked that he hangs out laundry to dry in front of his Bitcoin miner.\n\nMiner heat is not new to the Bitcoin industry. In the early days of Bitcoin, enthusiasts would mine the cryptocurrency with their everyday computers, leading to overheating and stories of uncomfortably warm environments.\n\nBitcoin mining has changed since the early days. With the markedly increased difficulty of solving hash computations on the Bitcoin blockchain, miners have ditched ubiquitous graphics processing units for more powerful application specific integrated circuits, or ASICS. However, heating and cooling still remain an issue.\n\nIn a nod to the future of capturing waste heat, Satoshi Nakamoto shared a message showing precognition:\n\n\u201cThe heat from your computer is not wasted if you need to heat your home.\u201d\n\nSo why not take advantage of that heat and use it for productive resources? That\u2019s exactly what I wanted to experiment with at my home near Lisbon, Portugal, this winter.\n\nDo-it-yourself solutions that utilize Bitcoin miner \u201cwaste\u201d heat in the home are increasingly popular. However, it can be tricky. The #mine4heat hashtag on Twitter boasts Bitcoin hobbyists who can rewire and soundproof Bitcoin miners \u2014 without electrocuting themselves.\n\nOne savvy miner heats their mobile home, an airstream, while others have found ingenious ways to mine Bitcoin and keep their homes toasty:\n\nProud DIY basement miner dude that exhausts his heat with trash bags taped end to end when I dont need it:) pic.twitter.com/S1XTz3T08p \u2014 Barc (@Barcinthedark) April 21, 2023\n\nHowever, for the \u201caverage Joe,\u201d like me, it seems daunting. I\u2019m a technologically stunted Bitcoin enthusiast who took years to run a node. So while the idea is appealing, I feared I might burn the house down.\n\nThere are several heater-cum-Bitcoin mining companies, like Heatbit and BitHeater, which are aware of Bitcoin miners\u2019 ability to make money while heating spaces, but also that there could be pent-up demand for a plug-and-play solution.\n\nHeatbit founder Alex Busarov told Cointelegraph that while ease of use was appealing, the environmental use case for Bitcoin miner heat drove the mission: \u201cWe want to make mining truly green,\u201d he said.\n\nBusarov said, \u201cThe claims that \u2018xx%\u2019 of energy used for mining comes from renewable energy\u2019 are misleading. While the number might sound impressive, it ignores the fact that this renewable energy would have been added to the grid if not used for industrial mining.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin mining is only genuinely green when combined with heating; this way, no extra energy is consumed by mining.\u201d\n\nBusarov referred to the statistics and claims published by Bitcoin mining advocates, including that Bitcoin is the greenest industry and that Bitcoin mining incentivizes renewable energy buildout. Nonetheless, Bitcoin miners take a lot of heat even when using waste heat for productive purposes.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin 2023 in Miami comes to grips with \u2018shitcoins on Bitcoin\u2019\n\nPersonally, I was more focused on the power draw of the Heatbit Bitcoin miners. If it consumes less electricity than my standard electric heaters, it would be a no-brainer for use over the winter \u2014 so I got my hands on one and put it to the test.\n\nThe result: for four months, I heated my small flat in Portugal with a Heatbit.\n\nSet up\n\nThe package arrived in mid-November during an unseasonably hot spell. I lugged it upstairs, unboxed it and scanned the instructions. It seemed too good to be true. The instructions are idiot-proof.\n\nHeatbit box. Cointelegraph slippers for scale.\n\nI connected the Heatbit to power, downloaded the Heatbit app, and it quickly found the Heatbit device and synchronized. I selected the hot setting and soon felt a warm stream of air coming from the vent at the top. I pushed my ear to it and was surprised at how quiet it was.\n\nBitcoin miners are very, very loud when turned up full blast. Some residents of a Norweigan town have even made noise complaints about a nearby industrial-scale Bitcoin mine, but my fridge is much louder than the Heatbit.\n\nI waited until I had mined one satoshi \u2014 less than a penny \u2014 which took about 15 minutes. By that point, the balcony enclosure of my flat was uncomfortably warm, so I turned it off.\n\nOver the next few months, I turned the heater on and off, moving it around the flat on its two rear wheels.\n\nCan you make money with it?\n\nTechnically yes \u2014 but not really. I raked in 30,000 satoshis during winter, which is just over $10.\n\nThe miner was whirring away for a couple of hours most evenings and in the mornings I was at home. Sadly, I wasn\u2019t in Portugal a great deal, with trips to Senegal, Poland and Cape Verde during the winter. Had I been home, I would have netted another roughly 50,000 sats of \u201cheat.\u201d\n\nUsing the Heatbit during winter.\n\nMoreover, my electricity bill was marginally lower than the previous winter, which is a minor success in light of double-digit inflation in Portugal.\n\nHowever, that misses the point. The Hearbit is a heater first and a Bitcoin miner second. The heat is smoother than my regular heater and requires zero maintenance (so far). Plus, as Busarov points out:\n\n\u201cWe want to decentralize mining. It\u2019s unlikely that Satoshi envisioned mining to be centralized in large farms. The ideal approach is \u2018everyone contributing a bit.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Heatbit contributes to the Nicehash mining pool. Some critics claim that mining pools lead to mining centralization \u2014 something the Bitcoin community is attempting to overcome with upcoming Stratum V2 upgrades to the mining algorithm. Nonetheless, there have been other unexpected consequences to running a Bitcoin miner.\n\nLiving with a Bitcoin miner\n\nIn Portugal, central heating is rare. Most homes I\u2019ve stayed in use oil heaters or electric heaters. The Heatbit quickly replaced my electric heater, which was more expensive due to its higher power draw. The miner is also quieter, and the heat emitted is consistent and less punchy. However, it\u2019s also 10 times the price of my electric heater.\n\nInterestingly, the Heatbit\u2019s size and stature raise eyebrows and questions like, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d among friends visiting my flat. Guests were surprised to learn that the white box was mining Bitcoin, as invariably, they thought that Bitcoin mining took place in giant data centers. I showed them how much I\u2019d earned on my phone, and, in a way, the heater is an orange pilling aid.\n\nAs Busarov explains, the point of the Heatbit \u201cis to expand the Bitcoin community.\u201d \u201cThere are far more people using electric heaters than miners,\u201d he said. Tools like easy-to-use at-home Bitcoin heater miners are another step toward greater adoption.\n\nThe downsides are the price tag and the size. The unit is large, heavy and costs over $1,000 brand-new. Given that in Portugal, I use a heater for four to five months a year, the Heatbit becomes a large paperweight from April to October.\n\nUltimately, it would take a few years to pay off at current price levels in a warm country like Portugal. Naturally, if the Bitcoin price were in the six figures, it would be a different story.\n\nMoreover, on Reddit and YouTube reviews, some users have reported problems with use and concerns about customer service.\n\nPlus, the mainstream and plug-and-play nature of the Heatbit is contrary to the ethos of the DIY Bitcoin miners, who see the company as making a profit on something a person could do themselves. And fundamentally, Bitcoin was first propagated by hobbyists, so it\u2019s understandable.\n\nDevelopers working on works on the Heatbit One prototype. Source: Heatbit\n\nTo Heatbit\u2019s credit, it listened. The company is introducing a smaller heater, the \u201cHeatbit Mini,\u201d from $299, in time for the next European winter. Busarov explains:\n\n\u201cWe also added air purifying functionality, making the device usable all year round. And, as the name suggests, the [Heatbit] Mini is smaller in size \u2014 less than 50 cm tall \u2014 making it convenient to place in any room.\u201d\n\nThe Heatbit Mini consumes 300 watts for mining and air purification, boostable to 1,300 watts of heat in the wintertime. The 300-watt setting still contributes the full 10 terrahashes per second, while the original Heatbit hash rate drops off as it dials down.\n\nRecent: Bitcoin ETF race begins: Has institutional trust returned to crypto?\n\nThat should mean you can run it all year round as an air purifier and a heater. Naturally, I\u2019ve signed up for one.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "A recent report released by the United Kingdom\u2019s Law Commission could weaken a central argument brought by Craig Wright in his controversial lawsuit against 12 Bitcoin Core developers, argues the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund (BLDF).\n\nIn a 300-page report on digital assets published in late June, the Law Commission \u2014 an independent body that reviews and recommends reforms to U.K. and Whales laws \u2014 cited a classification of fiduciary duty that bolsters the developers\u2019 defense that they are not directly responsible for 111,000 Bitcoin (BTC) lost to hackers.\n\nWright, owner of Tulip Trading, claimed in a 2021 lawsuit that developers involved in the open-source development of Bitcoin Core owed him a fiduciary duty in connection with his loss. In order to recover the allegedly stolen funds, Wright is seeking a back door into the Bitcoin blockchain. Wright is also known for claiming he is Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThe bitcoin protocol was set in stone to create a system that is stable. Bitcoin is not a Cryptocurrency. By definition, Cryptocurrencies are anonymous and untraceable. Bitcoin is pseudonymous and traceable, it is digital cash.\n\n\n\nDon't believe everything you see at first sight. pic.twitter.com/vPt4a0fEEx \u2014 Dr Craig S Wright (@Dr_CSWright) May 30, 2023\n\nThe U.K. report sheds light on the definition of fiduciary duty, claiming that categories of fiduciary recognized by the law include \u201cagents, trustees, partners, company directors, and solicitors.\" The report said fiduciary duty rarely exists outside these categories. According to the BLDF, the developers\u2019 legal representative, the defendants do not fit any criteria mentioned by the Commission.\n\n\u201cThey are not agents, trustees, partners, company directors, or solicitors, and they never \u2018undertook or were entrusted with authority to manage the property or make discretionary decisions on behalf of another person,\u2019\u201d BLDF stated in a recent blog post, adding that \u201cBitcoin was created to facilitate transactions between individuals without the need to entrust any authority to a third party.\"\n\nAccording to a definition by the University of Texas, fiduciary duty is the \u201clegal responsibility to act solely in the best interest of another party.\" Common examples of fiduciary duties include undivided loyalty, due diligence, full disclosure of conflicts of interest and confidentiality.\n\nThe Tulip Trading suit could set case law for open-source developers\u2019 liability for assets, with a trial in the case expected to occur in 2024. During the Bitcoin 2023 conference in May, Jessica Jonas, BLDF\u2019s chief legal officer, noted that potential legal ramifications of the lawsuit could deeply affect the community of open-source developers, as 97% of the world\u2019s software programs are open-sourced.\n\nThe U.K. Law Commission report also pushed for the creation of a new and distinct category of personal property to accommodate the unique features of digital assets.\n\nMagazine: $3.4B of Bitcoin in a popcorn tin \u2014 The Silk Road hacker\u2019s story"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin miners are awash with funds from transaction fees, a multimillion-dollar windfall generated this past quarter due to the popularity of BRC-20 tokens and Ordinals, according to Coin Metrics.\n\nThe crypto analytics firm said that a formerly \u201ctepid fee market\u201d for Bitcoin miners has been suddenly upended, with its latest \u201cState of the Network\u201d report finding miners earning $184 million from transaction fees from April through June.\n\nCompared to $2.4 billion in Bitcoin mining revenue overall, that figure may sound small, but the latest transaction fee total represents more than the five preceding quarters combined, Coin Metrics said. It described the shift as \u201can exceptional change\u201d influenced by BRC-20 tokens.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLaunched earlier this year, Ordinals is a protocol that enables people to create NFT-like assets on Bitcoin by inscribing data to an individual satoshi\u2014the smallest unit of currency that a Bitcoin can be divided into, equal to 1/100,000,000 of a whole Bitcoin.\n\nEven though Ordinals\u2019 arrival has been met with some pushback from within the Bitcoin community, its potential has been highlighted by figures like MicroStrategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, a prominent Bitcoin supporter who noted the protocol\u2019s new ability to help miners stay profitable over time.\n\nBRC-20 tokens were introduced in March, and the experimental class of coins takes inspiration from Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 token standard. BRC-20 tokens have ballooned to over $240 million in market capitalization since being introduced, according to CoinGecko.\n\nIn order for people to mint BRC-20 tokens\u2014and essentially claim them from a BRC-20 project that\u2019s launched\u2014users have to submit a transaction along with a fee to have their move to mint tokens processed on Bitcoin\u2019s network and included in the next block of transactions.\n\nAs a sense of \u201cmania\u201d surrounding BRC-20 tokens took hold in May, people became more willing to pay a greater premium on transactions in exchange for speed, Nick Hansen, CEO and co-founder of Luxor Technologies, told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBRC-20s introduced this urgency because what you needed to do was get your transactions confirmed faster than other peoples\u2019 transactions,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you would basically win the coins from the mint.\u201d\n\nTransaction fees on Bitcoin were so high in May that some people claimed Bitcoin was under attack. And the amount of Bitcoin miners earned from transaction fees outpaced Bitcoin\u2019s block subsidy for the first time since 2017.\n\nCoin Metrics\u2019 report notes that payout amounts related to transaction fees have waned as the fervor surrounding BRC-20s ebbs. Still, the amount of funds that miners are receiving from transaction fees remains robust, Hansen said\u2014especially compared to years past.\n\n\u201cWe have calmed down, but we're still seeing persistent demand for Bitcoin block space,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cMiners are still making 10 to 15 times more from their transaction fee volume than they would have last year.\u201d"

        "title": "The 3 Cryptos Likely to Get the Biggest BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Boost - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have been in the spotlight in recent times, and recent predictions about the approval of BlackRock\u2019s (NYSE:BLK) Bitcoin (BTC-USD) exchange-traded fund (ETF) have generated a lot of buzz in the financial world. It\u2019s as if we are in the midst of an exciting story unfolding in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nImagine for a moment Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, who, with his knowledge and experience in the field, has predicted that there is a 50% chance that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF. But what makes this forecast so interesting?\n\nWell, it turns out that Elliott Stein, senior litigation analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, has estimated that there is a 70% chance that Grayscale, the company that has appealed the SEC\u2019s decision to reject its ETF application, will win its case. This situation creates a suspenseful and exciting scenario where BlackRock and Grayscale face off in a legal battle that could change the cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHistorically, the SEC has been cautious about approving Bitcoin ETFs and has rejected several applications in the past. However, Balchunas raises an interesting theory: by approving BlackRock\u2019s ETF, the SEC could demonstrate that it is open to financial innovation and willing to adapt to market demands. It could be a way to \u201csave face\u201d and show the world that they are willing to embrace change.\n\nThis legal story between Grayscale and the SEC has captured the attention of many investors and cryptocurrency enthusiasts. The case has gone through legal filings and oral testimony, and now we are awaiting the decision of the U.S. Federal Appeals Court. Everyone is expectant, waiting to know the outcome of this story that could mark a milestone in the world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nBut what does all this mean for other cryptocurrencies, and how might they benefit if BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF is approved? Now let\u2019s talk about three of them.\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD)\n\nEtereum coin is in pocket. Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. ETH crypto\n\nSource: Thaninee Chuensomchit / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst, Ethereum (ETH-USD) is the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and often shows a positive correlation with Bitcoin. Ethereum is known to be a platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications, which makes it sensitive to general trends in the cryptocurrency market. If BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF is approved, it is very likely that Ethereum will also experience an increase in its demand and price. Besides, Ethereum is one of the few platforms that are beginning to be adopted by governments, such as the ECB (European Central Bank), issuing bonds via the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThere is also a special use for this type of ledger in an industry that is seemingly growing by the day: the peer-to-peer betting industry. People can now bet on certain events by a specified date, sort of like an equity options contract, only better. Surely those on the inside of these complex networks will find a way to market these potential uses and ride the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF push.\n\nXRP (XRP-USD)\n\nCoin cryptocurrency ripple on the background of a stack of coins\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnother cryptocurrency that has shown a correlation with Bitcoin is XRP (XRP-USD). Ripple has focused on the traditional financial sector and has established partnerships with various financial institutions. This influence in the traditional sector may cause Ripple to also benefit from the approval of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF, as it could be seen as a vote of confidence in cryptocurrencies by the SEC. It would be like Ripple receiving some sort of official recognition and endorsement.\n\nFurther, as the nature of Ripple is near and dear to banking infrastructure, the potential future of accounting practices and ledger records may fall in the hands of the Ripple blockchain. If it is convenient for the banks, it will definitely gain a second look from the SEC in the commission\u2019s consideration of the coin\u2019s acceptance within the financial system. Without a doubt, one of the low-flying coins with high potential can be a synonymous description next to Ripple.\n\nLitecoin (LTC-USD)\n\nImage of one litecoin in front of many stacks of litecoins. Litecoin price predictions\n\nSource: Wit Olszewski / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, Litecoin (LTC-USD) has been known as the digital \u201csilver\u201d to Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cgold.\u201d Since Litecoin was created as a complement to Bitcoin, it often shows a positive correlation with its larger counterpart. Although Litecoin\u2019s market cap is considerably smaller than Bitcoin\u2019s, it is also likely to benefit from BlackRock\u2019s ETF approval, as it will follow the general trends of the cryptocurrency market. It would be as if Litecoin receives an additional boost from the confidence placed in Bitcoin.\n\nIn summary, the story of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF and the legal battle between Grayscale and the SEC have generated a lot of buzz in the cryptocurrency world. If the ETF is approved, this could benefit cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin, which have shown correlation to Bitcoin in the past. We are witnessing a story full of twists and turns and excitement in the world of cryptocurrencies, where the protagonists are these innovative digital currencies.\n\nAs of this writing, Gabriel Osorio-Mazzilli did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Nearly 8,000 Bitcoin are sitting on these desks, notching an impressive 60% increase this quarter.\n\nCathie Wood\u2019s ARK uses OTC desks as a proxy for institutional activity, suggesting that the numbers reported show institutions and other large capital allocators are focused increasingly on Bitcoin\u2013a bullish sign, they say.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn our view, increased balances on OTC desks suggest that institutions and other large capital allocators are focused increasingly on Bitcoin,\u201d Ark wrote in the report.\n\nKeeping on the institutional trail, the report also touches upon Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), one of the few firms that caters to large or accredited investors. It has been on quite the run this year, doubling in value\u2013with its GBTC shares starting the year at $8.65 now changing hands at $20.\n\nThe so-called GBTC \u201cDiscount,\u201d which refers to the difference between the price for the shares and the net asset value (NAV) of GBTC\u2019s holdings\u2013has narrowed to -30%, which ARK suggests could be the market\u2019s optimistic sign to the recent ETF filings.\n\nLong-term Bitcoin holders are often considered a sign of strength for the network, a sentiment that ARK said it agrees with. The report notes that nearly 70% of the 19 million circulating supply of BTC has not moved in more than a year\u2013an all-time high in both relative as well as absolute terms.\n\nThe report also showcases 13 metrics for Bitcoin\u2019s network\u2013ranging from percent supply in profit to miner difficulty. Only two of these metrics (transaction volume and time-weighted turnover) are considered neutral, whereas the rest, says ARK, are flashing bullish.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBlackRock CEO supports digital assets that are \u201cnot based on any one currency\u201d\n\nLarry Fink says he\u2019s trying to make crypto accessible to everyone\n\nBlackRock aims to change crypto by creating the first spot ETF\n\nOn Wednesday, Larry Fink, BlackRock CEO told the media that he\u2019s attempting to \u201cdemocratize crypto\u201d. The head of the asset manager is trying to move TradFi to the digital age, saying it\u2019s akin to \u201cdigitizing gold.\u201d\n\nBlackRock just refiled its spot ETF application with the US Securities and Exchange Commission including Coinbase as its surveillance partner. This comes after years of skepticism toward the application of crypto as a payment solution. So, what changed Fink\u2019s mind?\n\nAn International Asset\n\nLarry Fink is encouraging investors to buy Bitcoin, seeing the asset\u2019s potential in future applications in both investment and payment applications.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do with crypto is make it more democratized, and make it much cheaper for investors,\u201d he reported .\n\n\u201cIt costs a lot of money right now to transact Bitcoin,\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hope our regulators look at these filings as a way to democratize crypto.\u201d\n\nFink is of course referring to the SEC, the regulating body that ultimately decides whether or not to approve BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin spot ETF application.\n\nThe SEC has already responded to BlackRock\u2019s first application filed two weeks ago saying that it\u2019s \u201cinadequate\u201d. The SEC is demanding major investors such as BlackRock and Fidelity provide further proof of security and transparency.\n\nBlackRock refiled for its spot ETF, adding Coinbase as its surveillance partner. Coinbase, the biggest US-based crypto exchange is currently at odds with the SEC, dealing with a lawsuit that claims Coinbase traded in \u201cunregistered securities\u201d.\n\nValkyrie also followed BlackRock\u2019s footsteps, re-filing for its spot ETF as well, adding the same clause.\n\nBitcoin is Digital Gold\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink says that \u201cBitcoin is an international asset\u2014it\u2019s not based on any one currency\u2014so it can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative,\u201d pointing out the benefit of investing in a decentralized currency, shielding investors from local inflations.\n\nBlackRock being a major influence in the TradFi world led Larry Fink to make a comment regarding switching the company\u2019s focus to Bitcoin, claiming that it\u2019s like \u201cdigitizing gold\u201d\n\n\u201cCrypto is digitizing gold, instead of investing in gold as a hedge against inflation, a hedge against the onerous problems of any country, or the devaluation of your currency, whatever country you\u2019re in,\u201d reported Fink, highlighting its similarity to gold, being a standalone value separate from any currency\u2019s position.\n\nA Paradigm Change\n\nBlackRock is known for managing assets of the highest value, such as shares in Disney, Spotify, and Uber. The BlackRock CEO said that he was skeptical of Bitcoin\u2019s potential at first, saying that the currency posed a danger of being used to pay for undesirable products and services.\n\nHowever, the company\u2019s change of heart has led to renewed optimism in the market. Bitcoin saw an increase in price by $4,000 overnight following the news of the company\u2019s ETF application.\n\nNumerous organizations have also filed for similar ETFs, following BlackRock\u2019s lead as the company has a nearly flawless ETF application record. The list of companies includes some of the nation\u2019s biggest financial institutions, including Fidelity, another major asset management."

        "content": "Bitcoin has been struggling to surpass the significant resistance region of $30K for some time now, despite an overall bullish outlook. Recent price movements have shown bearish signals that could potentially lead to a short-term reversal.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nBitcoin\u2019s bullish rally has come to a halt upon reaching the crucial resistance region of $30K. This price range holds significant psychological resistance and has acted as a major barrier to the price for several months.\n\nHowever, there are indications of a double-top bearish reversal pattern forming in conjunction with declining and weakening bullish momentum. This suggests the possibility of a reversal and a consolidation phase before the market determines its next direction.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that if the price is rejected at this critical resistance, a drop toward the dynamic support level of the 100-day moving average at $28K becomes highly likely.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nIn the 4-hour timeframe, the diminished bullish momentum becomes more apparent as the price has been consolidating around the $30K mark for an extended period. Following a prolonged period of consolidation, a bearish double-top pattern has emerged, causing a slight decline as selling pressure outweighs demand.\n\nHowever, it is important to wait for confirmation of the double-top pattern, which requires the price to fall below the neckline at $29.8K. If successful, Bitcoin\u2019s next target would be the static support region at $27.5K.\n\nFurthermore, it is worth mentioning that a clear bearish divergence is visible between the RSI indicator and the price, increasing the likelihood of a short-term downturn.\n\nIn summary, Bitcoin is currently facing significant resistance at the $30K level, accompanied by bearish signals and weakening bullish momentum. A reversal and consolidation phase may be in the cards, potentially leading to a short-term decline.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price has been on a strong bullish rally since the start of 2023, leading to profitable returns for many investors. The NUPL metric, illustrated on the chart, represents the disparity between market cap and realized cap divided by market cap. Essentially, this metric serves as an indicator of the proportion of investors who are in a profitable state.\n\nValues above 0 indicate that investors are making profits, and a rising trend suggests an increasing number of investors entering the profitable zone. The recent upward movement in the NUPL metric, which reached its previous high from April, implies that more investors are now experiencing profitable returns. This serves as a significant indication of the prevailing bullish sentiment in the market.\n\nConsequently, if the metric surpasses its previous high simultaneously with further price appreciation, it would generate heightened buying pressure and establish an unequivocally bullish market condition."

        "content": "Q2 2023 is the first quarter to exceed the $100 million mark since Q2 2021.\n\nThe figure is more than five times the fees earned during the preceding five quarters combined.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] miners made $184 million from transaction fees in the second quarter of 2023. The amount is far more than what the miners made throughout 2022.\n\nThe finding is based on a report published by the cryptocurrency analytics platform Coin Metrics on 5 July.\n\nQ2 2023 is the first quarter to exceed the $100 million mark since Q2 2021. The payout amount of $184 million reflects a surge of more than 270% from Q1 2023. In fact, the figure is more than five times the fees earned during the preceding five quarters (Q1 2022- Q1 2023) combined.\n\nHowever, the transaction fees accounted for only 7.7% of the total $2.4 billion that miners earned during the last quarter.\n\nThe report attributed this surge in transaction fees to Bitcoin\u2019s recent price rally and the introduction of BRC-20 token standard and Ordinals.\n\nBRC-20 and Ordinals benefit Bitcoin miners\n\nThe BRC-20 token was announced in March 2023. It employs Ordinals inscriptions to mint and transfer fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network. This new class of tokens is modelled after Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] ERC-20 token standard. Since their introduction, the market capitalization of BRC-20 tokens has risen to more than $240 million.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals was launched in January 2023. Ordinals is a Bitcoin protocol allowing people to create NFT-like assets on the network by inscribing data to a single satoshi. Satoshi is the smallest unit of currency that we can divide Bitcoin into, i.e. 1/100,000,000 of one unit of BTC.\n\nBitcoin miners also benefited from better macro-economic conditions in last quarter, with \u201creceding inflation pressures\u201d leading to lower power rates for U.S.-based miners, the report mentioned.\n\nThe report also added that payout amounts related to transaction fees have dwindled as the excitement around BRC-20s tokens ebbs. Nonetheless, the amount of compensation miners receives from transaction fees remained substantial.\n\nHowever, as Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate has continued to achieve new all-time highs over the last 12 months, competition in the mining fee market has tightened."

        "content": "A new chapter in Bitcoin\u2019s evolution has been introduced with the application of the Bitcoin Standard BRC-69. Notably, this standard removes the pre-existing 4-megabyte data limit for inscriptions on Bitcoin Ordinals.\n\n(3/7) With BRC69, we can reduce the costs of inscriptions for Ordinals collections by over 90%. This reduction is achieved through a 4-step process: (1) inscribe traits, (2) deploy collection, (3) compile collection, and (4) mint assets. \u2014 Luminex (@luminexio) July 3, 2023\n\nBitcoin Ordinals, essentially non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin blockchain, have taken a revolutionary leap forward with the BRC-69 standard. This development allows users to utilize recursive inscriptions, a method of data extraction from existing inscriptions that can be used to create new ones.\n\nThis leap in efficiency has led to a more than 90% reduction in the time and cost associated with creating inscriptions.\n\nBlockchain technology is continuously innovating to make the most of Bitcoin\u2019s blockspace, a limited and precious resource. The BRC-69 standard addresses this matter, paving the way for more efficient use of blockspace.\n\nThe emergence of recursive inscriptions under BRC-69 is not the only development that\u2019s been seen in the Ordinals space. A new concept known as Bitmaps has also surfaced, providing Bitcoin users with an innovative method to claim ownership over Bitcoin blocks.\n\nThese developments are more than incremental advancements; they mark significant milestones in the history of Bitcoin.\n\nThe implications of these innovations are vast, promising an enriched, more flexible approach to storing data on Bitcoin and elevating the capabilities of the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency."

        "title": "Bitcoin Ordinals boom triggers questions - Brave New Coin Insights",
        "content": "Bitcoin Ordinals boom triggers questions\n\nOrdinals bring a new type of utility to the Bitcoin network that has resonated with users. However, Ordinals have also created controversy after they led to an increase in transaction costs and network congestion. Will the Ordinals debate define the philosophical direction of Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the oldest and largest cryptocurrency network, is dealing with a controversial new feature that is dividing community opinion. Introduced in January 2023, the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol has caused an increase in transactions on Bitcoin. Described by some as Bitcoin NFTs, Ordinals bring a new type of utility to the Bitcoin network that has immediately resonated with users. It has, however, courted controversy because it is both leading to congestion on the network and is not designed to be a payment solution (check World Coin Stats for updated data and performance metrics on Bitcoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies).\n\nBitcoin is a decentralized, encrypted decentralized digital currency transfer network. Using blockchain technology, it allows for permissionless peer-to-peer transactions without needing to use intermediaries. It was created in 2008 by pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto and was released in 2009 as open-source software.\n\nThe Bitcoin network has utility as a medium to facilitate private transactions. It has been used for peer-to-peer payments, POS merchant sales, and online payments. It is also used for investments. The asset powering the network, bitcoin or BTC, has a digital gold-like value proposition. It has a limited supply of 21 million coins, so it has scarcity. It is also incredibly secure and has a hard-coded emission release schedule.\n\nWhat Is A Bitcoin Sat?\n\nOrdinals theory powers the controversial new Ordinals protocol. Ordinals theory defines satoshis (sats) as an atomic unit that can be identified and traded individually on the Bitcoin network. There are 100 million sats that makeup 1 Bitcoin. Bitcoin sats are ordered based on their sequence of mining, and this ordering number which uniquely identifies a satoshi, is the ordinal number.\n\nThese sats are uniquely identifiable, and can therefore be inscribed with digital content. This capability is the core of the Ordinals model. Once inscribed, an Ordinal-powered sat can become an immutable digital collectible. It can be attached to images, text, and a variety of other assets.\n\nOrdinals were enabled by November 2022\u2019s Taproot upgrade. Taproot enabled the Ordinals protocols and has opened the door for fungible or non-fungible tokens to be issued on the Bitcoin network.\n\nThere are a number of different use cases Ordinals can power. They have primarily been used to create non-fungible tokens (NFTs) but they are now gaining popularity as a way to issue fungible tokens. Ordinals power the BRC-20 standard which resembles Ethereum\u2019s popular ERC-20 standard.\n\nSource: Dune Analytics, @dgtl_assets\n\nSource: Dune Analytics, @dgtl_assets\n\nThe total number of Ordinals inscriptions has exploded since the 3rd week of April. There tend to be around 100,000-200,000 new Ordinal inscriptions being made every day and there are now over 14 million inscriptions in the wild. This number has more than doubled since May 15th.\n\nParticularly in terms of fees being generated, the momentum of Ordinals has dropped off considerably since the mid-May peaks. Ordinals are by no means dead, however, and are still being activlely created everyday.\n\nSource: Glassnode, fees on the Bitcoin network surge\n\nSource: Glassnode, Transaction count on the Bitcoin network explodes\n\nA similar pattern can be observed with overall network activity on the Bitcoin chain. Bitcoin ordinals triggered a sudden sharp uptick in activity on the network in mid-May. This activity eventually fell away and the sharp peaks could not be maintained. Activity on the Bitcoin network, however, remains higher than pre-Ordinals levels.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals Clogging The Network\n\nThe emergence of Ordinals has had a clear impact on the wider Bitcoin protocol. While it has boosted transaction activity and increased demand to interact with Bitcoin, it has also bloated the network to the point of incapacity. The scalability of Bitcoin is yet again being questioned, with Ordinals now affecting the ability of Bitcoin to fulfill its primary function of peer-to-peer payment transactions.\n\nOne of the factors leading to Ordinals bloating the network is the NFT size. Ordinal interactions are layered and can require close to Bitcoin\u2019s max capacity of 4mb, standard Bitcoin transactions only take up a few kilobytes. The reason the Ordinals NFT size is so large is that they store data directly on-chain instead of pointing to a separate physical asset.\n\nOn June 17th, onchain data provider GLASSNODE\u2019s Twitter account reported that concerns that the popularity of the Ordinals protocols would bloat the Bitcoin chain size to unfeasible levels, were exaggerated. The Onchain data provider has said that the Bitcoin block size is still growing at a manageable rate of 1.89MB per block. This means that future node runners will still be able to download the Bitcoin without excessive hardware requirements.\n\nIt is noticeable that the moving average of the total Bitcoin block size has leveled off considerably since the launch of Ordinals in January 2023. This suggests Ordinals creators have developed ways to efficiently create Ordinals and release them to the network.\n\nOrdinals pushes Bitcoin further with the inception of BRC-20s\n\nGlassnode has recently reported that, for only the 5th time in history, the average fee per block exceeded the block subsidy. The last instance of this occurring was the 2017 market peak. In all five of the historical cases, high fees eased and the network normalized. Glassnode say that the fee boom was driven by the popularity of the BRC20 standard, enabled by the Ordinals protocol.\n\nTransaction fees reached 6.66BTC, well above the 6.25BTC block reward. This made the total miner reward a staggering 12.9BTC per block or ~US$348,000.\n\nBRC-20 was created by anonymous developer Domo. They are similar to Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 custom token model but are not powered by smart contracts. This means that they are not able to be plugged into decentralized applications or have multiple functions like Ethereum tokens. Users can presently only mint, deploy and transfer tokens.\n\nNot all Ordinals are BRC20s but all BRC20s are Ordinals. While there are millions of Ordinals there are around 35,000 BRC20s. The market cap of BRC20s has quickly risen to ~US$163 million but has dropped from peak levels hit late May and early June.\n\nBRC20s function using JSON to initiate simple token contracts, create new tokens and move tokens around. The limited functionality has meant that they have become a popular way to issue meme coins which are designed to have no utility and act more as community badges. Some of the largest BRC20s include PEPE, MEME, and BRUH. Ordi\u2013the largest BRC20\u2013has a market cap of ~US$149 million and is listed on exchanges such as Crypto.com and Gate.io.\n\nBRC20s and Ordinals have created controversy because of how they are stressing the network. There are also naysayers who believe that Ordinals are tainting the network because they are not aligned with Satoshi\u2019s version of a peer-to-peer decentralized money transfer network. They consider Ordinal transactions as spam.\n\nThe most well-documented of the limitations of Bitcoin\u2019s Proof-of-Work network consensus is a lack of scalability. Blockchains like Bitcoin face scaling challenges because every node in the network has to verify and execute every transaction. This is computationally intensive and expensive.\n\nDevelopments in the Ordinal Space\n\nMultichain NFT marketplace Magic Eden announced on June 27th that it would begin supporting trading of BRC20 tokens. It will allow users to trade BRC-20 tokens on a secondary market and will also includes a launchpad for users to create their own tokens that will then be tradeable on Magic Eden. The Magic Eden BRC-20 launchpad will be a premium service with marketing and strategy support for creators.\n\nAn NFT from the popular Ethereum collection, cryptopunks, has been burnt and then symbolically tied to an Ordinal NFT. The move was something of a publicity stunt by a group of Bitcoiners but nevertheless clearly identifies the grassroots popularity of Ordinals. On June 17th, Cryptopunk #8611 sold for 55 Ether or ~US$110,000 in today\u2019s prices. This NFT was then put to rest in a well-known inaccessible Ethereum address which also contains US$24.7 million worth of Ether (~12,598 ETH). Cryptopunk #8611 was then \u2018recreated\u2019 as Ordinal inscription 12,456,749 which appears identical to Cryptopunk #8611. The decision to burn and recreate was a community-led effort by a group called the Bitcoin Bandits, which has issued a set of Western-themed collections of Ordinals inscriptions. 150 people contributed to the Cryptopunk conversion cause. The Bitcoin Bandits say that after CryptoPunk #8611 is ceremonially sent to a digital wallet that belongs to Satoshi Nakamoto, in a one way trip similar to a burn, they will launch a special Ordinal NFT collection.\n\nLitecoin, alongside Bitcoin, has been enjoying an Ordinal driven boost in transaction activity. In February a developer brought Ordinals to Litecoin around a month after they arrived on Bitcoin. Litecoin Ordinals are accessible on marketplaces like liteverse.io. On May 23rd, 2023 the Litecoin Foundation said that the 3 million inscription mark was officially reached on the network. Litecoin is a fork of Bitcoin created in 2011. The price of LTC is up ~40% in the last two weeks. The Litecoin block reward halving, a major bullish fundamental halving which occurs every four years, is expected to occur in 28 days.\n\nDifferent approaches to scaling \u2013 The major Bitcoin layer-2\u2019s\n\nAt least in the short term, Ordinals are here to stay. Outside of blocking the protocol, there is potentially another way around the congestion and scaling issues \u2013 layer-2 technology. Original base layer technologies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have had historic challenges with scaling and breaking down when facing stress. This led to the building of Layer-1 and Layer-2 infrastructures.\n\nLayer-1 protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum can be a base layer that interacts with a third-party layer-2 protocol. The layer-2 takes computational load away from the base chain and leaves it to handle tasks like verification and finality.\n\nThe Lightning Network\n\nThe Lightning Network is a Bitcoin layer-2 that can buffer the network during periods of congestion. The conception of the Lightning Network began in 2015 when Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja began work to solve the high fees of the Bitcoin network, a key pain point for users of the blockchain. In January 2016, a whitepaper for the Lightning Network was published and developers began working on solutions for layer 2 which had a Satoshi-driven focus on payment channels.\n\nWithin a couple of years, a beta version of the Lightning Network was released. The core of the protocol is enabling the creation of a peer-to-peer payment channel between two peers on the Bitcoin network. Once the channel is established, the two transacting parties can transfer an unlimited number of transactions cheaply and quickly. This makes it useful for smaller payment transactions that may be beleaguered by high fees and wait times of base layer Bitcoin.\n\nOnly interactions like the opening and closing of a channel are recorded on the main Bitcoin chain. The Lightning Network has nodes that verify transactions across peers within a channel, this frees up the capacity of primary Bitcoin network nodes. The Lightning network has the added benefit of reducing the environmental output of Bitcoin.\n\nThe lightning network is also capable of routing transactions by combining individual channels of concerned payments. It can also consolidate transactions. This is when two channels chose to finish transacting. All the transactions are recorded and then sent to the Bitcoin mainnet.\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nThe number of channels and the amount of Bitcoin tied to the Lightning Network rose sharply in 2022 but has somewhat stalled so far in 2023.\n\nThe Lightning ecosystem has a variety of tools for node management, wallets, payments, and gaming designed to add functionality. They include \u2014\n\nPool: They help to manage liquidity needs for Liquid users\n\nTaro: A tool to issue or mint assets on the Lightning Network\n\nFaraday: a data analytics tool that helps node operators optimize channels and the flow of funds\n\nLightning Network Daemon: A Lightning Network node implementation tool\n\nNeutrino \u2013 A light client specification to allow non-custodial Lightning wallets to verify transactions privately, trustlessly, and a full sync to the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe Stacks Solution\n\nStacks is another layer-2 blockchain solution that connects with Bitcoin through a unique \u2018Proof-of-Transfer\u2019 (PoX) model. Stacks aims to boost the utility of Bitcoin by allowing more computationally intensive activities like Smart Contract and Decentralized Applications (Dapps). Stacks has a native token, STX, designed to align incentives within the network.\n\nStacks was founded as Blockstacks in 2013 before a rebrand in 2020. The project was founded by Muneeb Ali and Ryan Shea who met at Princeton University\u2019s Computer Science Department. Blockstacks first version focuses on replacing the reliance on centralized cloud service providers seen within the smartphone and browser app markets. It was a decentralized identity data storage solution that leveraged the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIn January 2021, the Stacks 2.0 mainnet was launched. This allowed users to deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (Dapps) on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nA key selling point for Stacks is its unique \u201cProof-of-transfer\u201d (PoX) consensus mechanism that directly ties to the Bitcoin blockchain. PoX requires miners to spend Bitcoin to participate in miner elections and create a new block on the Stacks blockchain. PoX is tied 1-for-1 with Bitcoin.\n\nMiners send BTC to set addresses for a chance to validate transactions and mine the next Stacks block. Essentially bidding with BTC to have a chance to mine the next Stacks block. The PoX model resembles the Proof-of-Burn (PoB) mechanism used by projects like Slimcoin. Unlike PoB where Bitcoin is sent to a burn address, with PoX BTC is sent to be distributed to STX stakers.\n\nThis model means that Stacks validators compete based on Bitcoin that is bid, as opposed to computational resources, as is the case with the Bitcoin base chain\u2019s Proof-of-work model. Expanding PoW without creating higher energy consumption, higher costs and waiting is extremely challenging. PoX is designed to be an expansionary system for the Bitcoin network. It is dependent on Bitcoin\u2019s output for every block\n\nStacks is different from the Lightning Network because it is not designed to be a peer-to-payment payment solution. It is focused on creating an expansion of Bitcoin that allows Bitcoiners to interact with a smart contract and dapps. In this sense it is less aligned with the original Bitcoin vision than other scaling solutions.\n\nNevertheless, there appears to be an inevitably about solutions like Stacks. As Bitcoiners have observed money flowing into Smart Contract driven sectors like NFTS and Gamefi, they likely want a piece of that action.\n\nSTX is up an impressive ~204% year-to-date, showing significant and outpacing many other digital assets. Over the same period, BTC is up ~63%.\n\nCk-BTC\n\nBrave New Coin recently interviewed Dominic Williams from the DFINITY Foundation (a major contributor to the Internet Computer) about Ck-BTC, a unique new implementation of layer-2 Bitcoin.\n\nckBTC, a version of Bitcoin built on the Internet Computer, is a multi-chain Bitcoin \u2018twin\u2019 that is cryptographically secured 1:1 with real Bitcoin. It is created by a pair of open-source, verifiable smart contracts, which allows for cross-chain transactions to stay completely decentralized.\n\nThe Internet computer is a blockchain network that is a set of protocols that allow independent data centers around the world to band together and offer a decentralized alternative to the current centralized Internet cloud providers.\n\nWilliams says that thanks to chain-key ECDSA and threshold cryptography, \u201cInternet Computer smart contracts can create their own Bitcoin addresses and sign bitcoin transactions on the Bitcoin network. This is a key difference: there are no bridges or centralized custodians involved. ICP is among the first blockchains to perform direct integrations with other blockchains.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, the DFINITY R&D team developed a framework for ICP to directly communicate with other blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum by designing a new protocol for threshold ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm). The protocol is detailed in this research paper. The protocol\u2019s design works with a trustless way of computing ECDSA signatures using a cryptographic multi-party protocol, with canister smart contracts controlling ECDSA signing keys on a public blockchain.\n\nckBTC allows Bitcoin transactions to be integrated into a variety of smart contract-based decentralized applications. This includes messaging app OpenChat. \u201cEvery OpenChat account doubles as a crypto wallet. This means that OpenChat users can send ckBTC as instant chat messages. If you forget your friend\u2019s birthday or need to pay back someone for dinner you can just send them a message with ckBTC attached and they will receive it instantly. ckBTC can always be redeemed for BTC, there will never be a liquidity issue or a bridge exploit.\u201d Williams explained.\n\nWilliams also stated that the boom of the Ordinals protocol has emerged as an opportunity for products like ckBTC. \u201cMulti-chain solutions like ckBTC can allow the Bitcoin network to function while Ordinal NFTs grow in popularity, I think it is a positive. We want more people to use blockchain technology and we now have the solutions to cater for more than just one use case.\u201d Williams also explained that his team is working towards building a Bitcoin Ordinals marketplace that will utilize ckBTC as a payment method.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe emergence of the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol in recent weeks has ushered in a new paradigm for the Bitcoin network. This one, like the ones before it which led to events like the bigger block debate and Segwit, is filled with promising opportunities but also formidable challenges. While the popularity of the Ordinals has died down, it has nonetheless changed the network forever, generating important questions surrounding the scalability and utility of Bitcoin.\n\nOne of the significant opportunities presented is to the Bitcoin layer-2 ecosystem \u2013 solutions that are designed to aid it with its scaling challenges. Now more than ever, Bitcoin needs help scaling, given the influx of new transactions affecting the user experience of the network.\n\nAs with any innovation,however, it\u2019s important to remain aware of the potential trade-offs and challenges ahead. Layer 2 solutions are often seen as distractions that fragment the network. Potentially, investment and development that would otherwise go into Bitcoin may be going into layer 2 solutions, and some argue that this is a detriment of the main chain. Numerous layer-2 creates competition for value, whereas ideally, all value should be flowing into Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin currently stands as the gold standard of cryptocurrency and will likely have to continue dealing with patches of high transaction demands. This may be because of hype periods like the one created by the Ordinals protocol, or simply because Bitcoin organically becomes more popular as a payment medium.\n\nBitcoin will likely have to adapt and innovate further. Leveraging layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network, Stacks, ck-BTC, and Liquid may be key in addressing the network\u2019s current scaling issues, optimizing transaction costs, and ensuring growth and expansion. As Bitcoin forges ahead on its journey, the lessons learned from the Ordinals episode will undoubtedly be invaluable in shaping its future."
