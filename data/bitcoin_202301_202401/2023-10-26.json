        "content": "Data: CoinGecko; Chart: Axios Visuals Bitcoin is tantalizingly close to breaking past its price from just before the terra usd stablecoin melted down in May 2022. Why it matters: It's a sign that the world's biggest cryptocurrency may have shaken off the bad news. And as the bellwether for the whole crypto industry \u2014 when bitcoin rises, every other coin and token tends to rise with it.\n\nBy the numbers: As of Thursday afternoon, bitcoin is trading at $34,122. It briefly touched $35,000 Monday on CoinGecko, but it has largely hovered just below.\n\nCoinGecko is putting its seven-day rise at 18.4%.\n\nTo recover from Terra, though, it will need to hold a level near $37,000 (where it stood just before Terra's collapse). It's not there yet.\n\nWhat's happening: The consensus is that people are anticipating a spot bitcoin ETF finally getting approved.\n\nGold ETFs coming in 2004 were a game changer for that asset's price, as Matt Hougan of Bitwise noted in a social media post.\n\nWhat they're saying: \"Rumors are flying since the appearance of BlackRock's bitcoin spot ETF ticker on a list at the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), including that the world's largest asset manager has already started purchasing bitcoin for the fund,\" Stefan Rust, CEO of data aggregator Truflation, said in a statement.\n\nYes, but: James Butterfill, the head of research at CoinShares, pointed in a recent blog post to more muted inflows of capital into bitcoin, compared to prior rounds of ETF excitement.\n\nGo deeper: Open interest in bitcoin derivatives are piling up\n\nEditors note: This story has been corrected to reflect the proper attribution of the inflows data."

        "content": "We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nBitcoin is a speculative investment but the returns on CDs are locked in from the start. Getty Images\n\nYou've likely heard of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. You may have even been enticed to buy some with hopes of striking it rich. Why not try to get in before the next spike? That move, however, could be a dangerous one.\n\nThe truth is that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are highly speculative assets with several significant hurdles to any real-world utility. Rather than throwing money into an emerging technology that may or may not be worth anything 10 years from now, you may be better with a CD to lock in today's impressive returns.\n\nOpen a CD now to lock in today's impressive returns.\n\nWhy you should cash in your bitcoin for a CD\n\nThe Federal Reserve has raised the target federal funds rate more than 10 times since early 2022. As a result, CDs are offering better returns than investors have seen in years. However, that's not the only reason you may want to ditch cryptocurrency and dive into a CD.\n\nCDs are stable while bitcoin is volatile\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are highly volatile investments, meaning these assets see sporadic and unpredictable swings in value. When more people buy bitcoin, the price of the cryptocurrency rises and when more people sell it, the price falls. The problem here is that nearly any news can cause significant swings in either direction.\n\nOn the other hand, CDs are stable investments with predictable returns.\n\nWhen you purchase a CD, you're not purchasing some high-risk asset hoping you'll make money in the long run. Instead, you know the exact return the CD is going to generate when you buy it. That's because when you purchase one, you lock in whatever rate CDs might be paying on that day. That's good news in today's high interest rate environment.\n\nBring stability to your finances with a CD today.\n\nCDs are a more straightforward investment\n\nIt's important to form a detailed understanding of anything you invest in. That may be difficult when it comes to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin because they're complex technologies in an emerging market. The world likely doesn't even know about some of the challenges bitcoin may face if it is ever used as a mainstream currency.\n\nOn the other hand, CDs are a more straightforward, easy-to-understand, investment option.\n\nDoug Roller, investment advisor representative and owner of Crossroads Financial Group in Fort Wayne, Indiana, says, \"CDs are relatively simple and straightforward investments.\" He went on to explain that CDs \"don't require much active management or monitoring,\" making them easier to manage for the average investor than high-risk investments.\n\nCDs promote better saving habits\n\nCDs are also a great way to improve your saving skills. Roller says, \"CDs promote disciplined saving habits, as they often have penalties for early withdrawal.\" That's good news because early withdrawal penalties can \"discourage impulsive spending and help you stick to your savings goals.\"\n\nRather than promoting sound spending habits, bitcoin can require a riskier approach.\n\nIf you purchased bitcoin, you probably did so based on stories you've read, watched or heard about people who have made millions investing in cryptocurrencies. Your hope is that bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency you invested in makes another run for the top, turning a few thousand dollars into a few million. While that may or may not be possible, the returns on a CD are definitive, promoting better saving habits and less risky investor behavior.\n\nDon't accept the risk. Lock in today's impressive CD interest rates now.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nIf you want to try your chances with bitcoin, do so cautiously. On the other hand, if you want to make real returns on your idle cash without having to worry about volatility, security, or other concerns, dive into CDs. Get started here today."

        "content": "Texan Activists To Bitcoin Miners: Don\u2019t Mess with Texas\u2019 Water and Electricity\n\nIn a resounding call to action, activists, environmentalists, and concerned Texans have come together for a week-long campaign aimed at challenging the environmental repercussions of the world's largest Bitcoin mining operation. This unified effort seeks to address the consequences of Bitcoin mining in the Lone Star State while advocating for transparency and accountability in the industry and by local politicians.\n\nCorsicana, TX (October 27, 2023) \u2014 In a dynamic week of action, Greenpeace USA, the Texas Coalition Against Cryptomining, and Navarro County residents confronted Riot Platforms Bitcoin mining operations in Texas. The week of action shed light on Riot Platform\u2019s impending launch of the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin mining operation in Corsicana, Texas. This development threatens to exacerbate Texas\u2019 already burdened energy grid and poses substantial environmental risks.\n\nJackie Sawicky, Founder of the Texas Coalition Against Cryptomining, said: \u201cBitcoin proof-of-waste \u2018miners\u2019 are wasting water, driving up our electricity bills, getting tax breaks, abatements, and deeply discounted energy. They get paid to shut down once the grid has destabilized, then they resell that cheap energy at a premium. Why on earth should every Texan pick up the tab for a digital casino that hardly any of us gamble in?\u201d\n\nRiot Platforms\u2019 choice of Corsicana, Texas, as the site for their colossal Bitcoin mine is driven by several factors, including proximity to the Navarro switch, privileged access to already strained water sources, lenient regulations, cost-effective electricity, and enticing incentives offered by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) through its Demand and Reserve Response programs. Through its participation in Demand Response, Riot is able to sell its deeply discounted energy back to Texans at a premium in times when electricity demand is high. This offers Riot substantial financial rewards at the expense of Texas ratepayers. The program has helped turn Texas into a hub for energy-intensive Bitcoin mining operations while Texans are urged to conserve energy and must contend with sky-high electricity bills.\n\nJoshua Archer, Greenpeace USA Bitcoin Campaign Lead said: \u201cWe stand in solidarity with the Texans who are bravely raising their voices against Riot Platforms\u2019 exploitation of their communities. This week of action embodies our collective determination to combat Bitcoin\u2019s destructive impact on electricity grids, water resources, and the global climate.\u201d\n\nThe protest on Wednesday lasted two hours in front of what will be the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin mine owned by Riot Platforms. Multiple residents who were driving by engaged with protesters and supported the cause. Photos of the week available here.\n\nKimberlee Walter, Founder of Stand Up for Change: Navarro County said: \u201cThis week of action has provided a crucial platform for raising awareness and informing my fellow Navarro County residents about the absolute devastation the presence of Riot Platforms\u2019 Bitcoin mining operation will have on all of us.\u201d\n\nLocal politicians in Navarro County have been less than transparent about the Bitcoin mining activities in their community, rejecting requests for an official Town Hall meeting to address concerns raised by activists.\n\nThese concerns include:\n\nExcessive electricity consumption on an already stressed and unstable grid;\n\nHigher electricity bills for Texas ratepayers;\n\nExcessive water usage, in drought-prone Texas;\n\nNoise pollution; and\n\nAdditional fossil fuel use at a time when we need rapid progress on emissions reduction.\n\nThe week of action included an unofficial Town Hall meeting on Tuesday hosted by the Texas Coalition Against Cryptomining (TCAC). Speakers included Ed Hirs, an energy fellow at the University of Houston; Adrian Shelley, the Texas office director of Public Citizen; and Jackie Sawicky from TCAC. It was moderated by Kimberlee Walter. Community members, officials from nearby districts, and journalists attended.

        "title": "Washington County to consider new settlement in Bitcoin mine suit - WJHL-TV News Channel 11",
        "content": "JONESBOROUGH, Tenn. (WJHL) \u2014 Washington County commissioners will consider a proposed settlement Monday in their lawsuit against BrightRidge and Bitcoin mine operator Red Dog Technologies, a wholly owned subsidiary of GRIID Infrastructure.\n\nAn agenda for the called 6 p.m. meeting shows that after a presentation of a proposed settlement agreement, the commission will enter a closed executive session. Certain matters related to the lawsuit, filed in November 2021, can be discussed without the presence of the public or media.\n\nAfter that, members of the public who sign up to address the settlement agreement issue will each have three minutes to speak. The only other item is discussion of the status and potential settlement of the lawsuit. GRIID, which gets about half its Bitcoin from the Red Dog site, lost $61 million in 2022 and $22 million in the first six months of 2023.\n\nLocated next to BrightRidge\u2019s Bailey Bridge Road substation in Limestone, the \u201cmine\u201d \u2014 where hundreds of high-powered computers perform complex equations to \u201cmine\u201d the cryptocurrency or validate its transactions \u2014 has been the subject of controversy since May 2021. That\u2019s when neighbors in the rural community began complaining about noise coming from the fans that are needed to cool the computers.\n\nBy late summer, commissioners learned that Zoning Administrator Angela Charles and County Attorney Allyson Wilkinson both believed the mine\u2019s function did not comply with the A-3 (agriculture business) zoning designation. BrightRidge had requested the property be rezoned from A-1 (general agriculture) to A-3 in February 2020 for what it described as a \u201cblockchain data center.\u201d\n\nThe rezoning request, which county commissioners approved unanimously, did not mention a Bitcoin mine or an operator other than BrightRidge.\n\nThe commission demanded that BrightRidge shut the operation down in September 2021. When that didn\u2019t happen, the commission filed suit.\n\nBefore the suit went to trial, Red Dog, BrightRidge and the county agreed to work toward a settlement. In June 2022, the commission approved a settlement that called for Red Dog to pay penalties totaling more than $200,000, relocate to the Washington County Industrial Park in Telford by the end of 2024, purchase the site for the new mine, and agree to penalties for decibel readings above 60 decibels.\n\nThe deal drew fresh public opposition from people living around the industrial park, and before it had time to be voted on in final form, a countywide election had changed the complexion of the commission. A follow-up vote on Nov. 28, 2022 failed 13-2, and early this year Washington County Chancery Court Judge John Rambo set a trial for Feb. 5-7, 2024.\n\nRed Dog parent co. lost $22 million first 6 months of 2023\n\nThe county will be negotiating with a wounded company that once had massive growth plans and hopes of going public. GRIID entered an agreement in late 2021 with a special purpose acquisition company, Adit EdTech, to take it public. There was much talk of a $3.3 billion value and growing from about 50 megawatts of capacity to more than 1,000.\n\nNone of that happened, and when the price of Bitcoin plummeted in the spring of 2022, the company \u2014 with roughly half its production capacity in Limestone \u2014 found itself unable to pay its creditors. It restructured its loan and as of late 2022, owed more than $57 million.\n\nThrough the first six months of 2023, GRIID posted an operating loss of $9.4 million and a total loss of $22 million according to Adit EdTech SEC filings. The public offering has continued to be delayed, and the prospects of GRIID having the capacity to construct a new mining operation in Washington County would depend on the appetite of Blockchain Access, GRIID\u2019s primary lender, to spend additional capital to stand up a new facility."

        "content": "By James Edwards\n\nThe industry still has some major hurdles to clear before Bitcoin can reach a new all-time-high\n\nThis week Bitcoin rallied to a 17-month high of $35,000 off the back of speculation that a Bitcoin spot ETF is imminent.\n\nInterest in crypto has seemingly done a 180, with institutional investors and retail traders returning to the fold.\n\nBut this euphoria could be short lived, as the industry still has quite a few hurdles to clear before another bull run can take off in earnest.\n\nHere's what you need to know before you jump back into the market.\n\nBinance is on thin ice\n\nSpeak to anyone with their ear to the ground in crypto, and they'll tell you the elephant in the room isn't the Sam Bankman-Fired trial or the SEC, but Binance.\n\nThe world's largest exchange by trade volume is currently facing a crisis on several fronts.\n\nOn October 17, Binance US disabled US dollar withdrawals after the SEC asked a court to freeze the companies assets.\n\nThis action is part of an on-going lawsuit which alleges Binance violated a number of securities laws.\n\nAmong the charges are illegal securities offerings of BNB and BUSD, the comingling of users funds, failure to register as an exchange, and falsifying trading volumes.\n\nThis isn't Binance's only battle in the U.S. either. An earlier lawsuit from the CTFC in March that alleges the company \"willfully evaded\" securities laws and by targeting and onboarding US to its derivatives platform.\n\nBoth lawsuits target not just Binance, but also accuse its CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), of breaking the law.\n\nThe pausing of US dollar withdrawals follows similar actions in Europe and Australia, where EUR and AUD payment partners have abandoned the firm, with no replacements to be found.\n\nJust months before AUD withdrawals were frozen, its Australian CEO Leigh Travers quit the firm as the Australian Securities and Investments Commission investigated Binance and closed its derivatives business by revoking its license.\n\nThings aren't much better across the pond either, with Binance losing its head of UK operations, \u200b\u200bJonathan Farnell, earlier this week.\n\nOn October 16, Binance restricted services for customers in the UK as a result of new Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) rules.\n\nThis is the latest in a series of departures, which saw Binance's Chief Strategy Officer, Senior Director of Investigations, and SVP for Compliance all depart in July.\n\nElsewhere, Binance is facing heat from regulators in Germany for violating securities laws and in both Japan and Singapore for operating without a license.\n\nFor their part, Binance continue to largely dismiss the claims against them, and have filed a request in court to have the SEC lawsuit thrown out.\n\nThe concern now is that Binance could face a liquidity crisis, similar to that of FTX and other defunct exchanges before it.\n\nIf users are forced to withdraw funds en masse, or simply panic, then it's unclear whether Binance would be able to meet demand.\n\nIt's no secret that Binance has built a sprawling web of financial services, which include all sorts of lending facilities, staking, funding deals, and trading activities.\n\nAny sudden capital flight could easily shock the system, and have flow-on effects throughout the industry.\n\nNo one quite knows if Binance is operating with integrity, but the concern is very real.\n\nThe Sam Bankman-Fried trial and FTX bankruptcy are still unresolved\n\nThe criminal trial against Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) is now in its 4th week, and won't conclude until November 9th at the earliest.\n\nA core line of inquiry has been FTX's sprawling empire and business dealings. These include hundreds of investments in crypto projects, its hedge fund Alameda and even millions of dollars of political donations.\n\nAs further evidence of illegal conduct is revealed, there's concern around what impact this will have on the wider industry \u2013 which is only just recovering.\n\nFor instance, FTX and its sister firm, Alameda, invested $5.3 billion in 473 companies via their venture capital efforts.\n\nOf this, approximately $3.2 billion was invested across 250 different crypto projects in return for tokens, or token IOUs.\n\nThe list includes major names like Polygon (MATIC), Near (NEAR) and Lido (LDO), as well as 200 or so lesser known projects.\n\nAs FTX administrators look to recoup customer assets, it\u2019s possible that these tokens will be sold off in order to reimburse creditors.\n\nThe latest proposal from FTX's administrators looks to settle bankruptcy proceedings and return funds to creditors by July 2023.\n\nSo any major sell-offs should be expected before this date, and could potentially dampen any fuel added to Bitcoin's rocket by an ETF approval.\n\nThis wouldn't just dampen token prices either.\n\nMost projects rely on the value of their token to fund their on-going development. A sudden devaluation of their treasury would place the future of many projects in peril.\n\nA new lawsuit: Gemini, Genesis and Digital Currency Group sued by New York AG\n\nOn October 19, the New York Attorney General, Letita James, filed a lawsuit against Gemini Trust, Genesis Global Capital and Digital Currency Group (DCG).\n\nThe lawsuit revolves around Gemini's Earn programme, with the three companies accused of defrauding more than 230,000 customers of $1.1 billion.\n\nGemini loaned user funds to Genesis, which is owned by DCG. Genesis then lent these to firms such as Alameda (of FTX fame) and Three Arrows Capital, which later collapsed, leaving $1.1 billion of bad debt that Gemini has been blaming Gensis for ever since.\n\nThe suit alleges that all parties \"falsely claimed\" they had the necessary licenses to operate in New York.\n\nGemini has worked hard to position itself as the victim in this case, with its owners, the Winklevoss Twins, accusing DCG owner Barry Silbert publicly via forums like X (twitter).\n\nThe New York AG is seeking to have Gemini, Genesis and DCG banned from operating in New York and is seeking compensation for the 29,000 New Yorkers affected \u2013 approximately 12.5% of the total users.\n\nIf forced to repay this portion of the $1.1 billion owed, DCG may be forced to sell off part of its portfolio of companies.\n\nThese include wholly owned entities like Grayscale Investments, CoinDesk and the Luno exchange. Then there is equity in another 200+ crypto related companies of all shapes and sizes, many of which play critical roles in the wider crypto economy.\n\nIn February this year, there were reports that DCG was forced to sell parts of its portfolio at a steep discount, in order to help fund the hole left by Genesis.\n\nWhile DCG has since sought bankruptcy for Gensis to try and stem the bleeding, the new suite by the NY AG may force DCG to sell off even more of its portfolio and disrupt markets further.\n\nStill a while to go\n\nDespite the excitement around a spot crypto ETF potentially being approved soon in the U.S., cryptocurrency markets still have a lot of skeletons in the closet and hurdles that need to be cleared before the next bull market can take off.\n\nInvestors will want to be wary of unbridled euphoria this time around, and make sure to analyze the bigger picture before going all in on one of the most volatile asset classes in history.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Options Worth $4.5 Billion Set To Expire Today\n\nThe crypto options market is facing a major event today that could lead to increased volatility and shifting prices for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAccording to data from Deribit, over $4.5 billion worth of options contracts in Bitcoin and Ethereum are set to expire at 8:00 UTC on Friday, October 27.\n\nOptions give buyers the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific expiration date. As these options reach their expiration date, holders will have to decide whether to exercise their contracts or let them expire worthless.\n\nThis could lead to a spike in trading volume and volatility around the expiration time as market participants react to whether large options positions are exercised or not. CoinDesk reported the current open interest in contract terms has increased to $20.64, significantly higher than in November 2021 when BTC was around $66,000.\n\nThe impending options expiration comes after a period of positive price movement for top cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin rose from around $26,000 to over $34,000 in recent weeks. This market activity led to increased options trading.\n\nTraders and investors will be closely watching the impact of this historic options expiration as it unfolds today. The $4.5 billion in contracts set to expire represents the scale of the crypto options market today, and how it can drive price action and volatility in underlying assets."

        "title": "Bitcoin Halving is Soon \u2014 Is Now the Best Time to Invest? - Entrepreneur",
        "content": "Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nLess than a year is left before the Bitcoin halving \u2014 an event when the reward for mining a Bitcoin block will be cut in half. Historically, the halving has been followed by a major bull run in the crypto market. Should we expect the crypto summer soon \u2014 and what other factors may push the Bitcoin price up?\n\nRelated: Bitcoin Is Back, Apparently. Here's What's Fueling the Surge.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin halving?\n\nBitcoin supply is limited. No more than 21 million coins will ever exist, and the new ones are only issued to reward miners for running the network. Currently, the size of this reward is 6.25 coins per block \u2014 and every four years, it is reduced by half. The 2024 halving, expected in April, will lower the reward to 3.125 BTC.\n\nBitcoin was designed to be scarce: its limited supply protects it from inflation. With the growing demand for the asset, its price must steadily grow \u2014 which is exactly what's happening with Bitcoin over the years.\n\nRelated: Why the Next Crypto Bull Run Will Be Like Nothing We've Ever Experienced\n\nThree halvings, three rallies\n\nHistorically, the halving has been followed by a bull run, and Bitcoin has reached new all-time highs within 1\u20131.5 years after the event. Bitcoin gained 30X following its 2016 halving and 6.5X after the one in 2020. More importantly, the Bitcoin halving makes the entire market soar: in 2020\u20132021, hundreds of altcoins surged by 1,000%+.\n\nShould we expect the same from the next halving?\n\nWill Bitcoin halving trigger a new rally?\n\nPantera Capital, the world's largest crypto hedge fund, argues that Bitcoin will grow to $148,000 in the new market cycle. The firm emphasizes: \"Bitcoin has historically bottomed 477 days prior to the halving, climbed leading into it, and then exploded to the upside afterward.\" This means that the latest bottom should have been hit in late 2022. If we look at the BTC price chart, we do see the local minimum of $15,490 in November. Bitcoin has historically reached the new ATH within 480 days after the halving.\n\nOther analysts agree that we've already passed the lows of the current cycle. By December 2022, 65% of the pre-halving period was over \u2014 the mark usually followed by a few months of a sideways price movement, which eventually ended up in growth.\n\nBitcoin did recover from the local minimum \u2013 but failed to keep above $30K this August.\n\nSome forecasts are, however, more restrained. For instance, MacroMicro, an analytical platform that consolidates global economic data, emphasizes the role of macroeconomic factors that may impact the prospective Bitcoin rally.\n\nThree latest post-halving bull runs coincided with a substantial increase in money supply by the USA, EU, China and Japan central banks. In contrast, these financial authorities have been doing the opposite during the last year \u2014 rising rates to tackle inflation. The chances that they'll ease the liquidity in the following months seem low.\n\nThe more the money supply grows, the greater BTC price increases.\n\nRelated: Tesla Reports $170 Million Loss in Failed Bitcoin Investment\n\nWhat else can pump Bitcoin?\n\nOne more factor favoring the Bitcoin price might be the approval of Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds).\n\nAn ETF is a fund that holds a portfolio of certain assets, and its shares are traded on an exchange. The owner of an ETF invests in the fund's portfolio by purchasing a share of it rather than buying the assets themselves.\n\nIn the case of a Bitcoin ETF, the fund owns Bitcoin, and investors can purchase the shares of this fund on an exchange. The value of these shares is tied to the Bitcoin price. For institutional investors, it is easy to embrace the first cryptocurrency \u2014 ETFs don't require buying and trading Bitcoin itself, which lets them avoid legal risks. For retail investors, ETFs are an opportunity to quickly diversify their portfolio with cryptocurrency without buying it directly.\n\nBitcoin ETFs are currently allowed in Canada and some other countries. While the USA is considered potentially the largest market for this kind of asset, the SEC has not approved any Bitcoin ETFs in America yet. But if it does, the first cryptocurrency may experience a large spike in trading volume \u2014 and, consequently, price.\n\nRelated: 5 Ways to Maintain and Expand Your Wealth During the Cryptocurrency Dip\n\nHow should I prepare for the bull run?\n\nSooner or later, the market will enter the growth phase of the cycle. Led by Bitcoin, it will also make other coins grow by 100%, 500%, and even 1,000% or more.\n\nThis is where picking the right coins to invest in is key. A sure way is doing your research and building up a balanced portfolio \u2014 when the market skyrockets, the chance of making gains is high, irrespective of what particular assets are included.\n\nAnother way is to leverage the portfolio composed by professional cryptocurrency researchers using AI tools trained to find the most promising coins. Those portfolios are publicly available as index tokens representing the combined value of multiple coins from different domains of the crypto market.\n\nSome of the index tokens are focused on halving \u2014 their purpose is to identify the coins that may demonstrate the most impressive growth in the next bull run. For instance, Bitdriven is an index token representing the value of Bitcoin, Top-10 crypto coins by market cap and many other altcoins from Web3, DeFi and other segments that promise to make gains from 10X to 15X after April 2024.\n\nThe data from different years demonstrates that Bitcoin gains less and less value in terms of Xs after each bull run. Whether you leverage index tokens or not, picking the right altcoins will be the key to making your best returns in 2024."

        "title": "Better Buy: Bitcoin or a Spot Bitcoin ETF? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Buzz is continuing to grow over the imminent launch of the first spot Bitcoin (BTC -2.96%) exchange-traded fund (ETF) for the U.S. market. This investment product is widely perceived to be bullish not only for Bitcoin, but also for the entire crypto industry. As a result, just about any bit of ETF-related news can send the price of Bitcoin soaring. On Oct. 23, for example, Bitcoin soared by $4,000 in a span of just 24 hours after a positive update from BlackRock (BLK -1.99%) on its planned Bitcoin ETF.\n\nBut just because a spot Bitcoin ETF might be good for the overall crypto market doesn't mean that it's necessarily good for your portfolio. Here's a closer look at the pros and cons.\n\nPros\n\nFor individual investors, the biggest advantage of a spot Bitcoin ETF is the lack of many of the biggest barriers to entry for crypto. You don't have to worry about creating an account with a cryptocurrency exchange. You don't have to worry about creating a blockchain wallet to hold your crypto. And you don't have to worry about crypto taxes, which can be hard to figure out.\n\nMoreover, a spot Bitcoin ETF will help to remove much of the perceived \"sketchiness\" of the crypto industry. Any Bitcoin ETF product will have the full blessing of government regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). And it will have the support of big institutional investors on Wall Street. Right now, a handful of different firms are rushing to create spot Bitcoin ETFs, and all of them are instantly recognizable brand names.\n\nAnd, most importantly, any spot Bitcoin ETF will be audited, monitored, tracked, and highly transparent. In short, you won't have to worry about a guy in the Bahamas walking away with all of your Bitcoin holdings, as we saw last year with the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX.\n\nCons\n\nHowever, buying a Bitcoin ETF does come with a few downsides. For one, you are losing direct access to Bitcoin. When you hold Bitcoin in your own crypto wallet, you can do with it whatever you want. Now that Ferrari accepts Bitcoin, for example, you could use your Bitcoin stash to buy a new car. Or, if a lender allows you to use Bitcoin as collateral for a loan, you could use your Bitcoin holdings. When you buy an ETF, though, you are buying shares in a fund that holds Bitcoin, and not a direct stake in Bitcoin itself.\n\nMoreover, with a Bitcoin ETF, you are paying highly compensated professionals on Wall Street (via fund management fees and expenses) to do something that you can easily do yourself. I have no issue whatsoever paying 1% a year in expenses if these Wall Street professionals are putting together, say, a diversified basket of Brazilian stocks so I can gain access to the Brazilian market. This is something that I couldn't possibly do myself.\n\nHowever, when it comes to Bitcoin, doing it yourself is certainly feasible. And it doesn't require creating an account at a cryptocurrency exchange or dealing with crypto wallets. For example, you can buy and sell Bitcoin via PayPal and Robinhood these days, and all it takes is a few clicks.\n\nCan ETFs really track the performance of Bitcoin?\n\nThe question of whether to buy a spot Bitcoin ETF really comes down to how closely this product will actually track the price of Bitcoin. For example, if the price of Bitcoin goes up by 100% in one year, then you want to make sure that your Bitcoin ETF also goes up 100% in one year. Otherwise, you are potentially leaving money on the table. Over time, these differences could add up.\n\nThe good news is that there are spot Bitcoin ETFs in Canada already, and they seem to do a good job of tracking the price of Bitcoin. When Bitcoin zigs, the ETF zigs. When Bitcoin zags, the ETF zags. This is highly important because the Bitcoin ETFs available today in the U.S. market rely on derivatives (such as futures contracts) to mimic the price of Bitcoin, and this can lead to disparities between the performance of Bitcoin and the performance of the ETF.\n\nCertainly, I expect the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETF products to be a huge positive for Bitcoin. They will open the door even wider for experienced investors to get access to Bitcoin. And these ETFs should help to make Bitcoin go even more mainstream with crypto-curious investors who might be hesitant about getting direct access to Bitcoin these days. If you decide that the pros outweigh the cons, they could be a useful addition to your investment portfolio."

        "title": "Spot Bitcoin ETF Could Spark these Crypto ETFs - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, is on a torrid pace of late, surging more than 16% over the past week amid speculation that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could finally sign off on a spot bitcoin exchange traded fund.\n\nSome experts believe such approval, which amounts to one of the most widely anticipated events in ETF industry is history, is just months away. It remains to be seen if this is a buy the rumor, sell the news type of event, but some things aren\u2019t up for debate. First, a spot bitcoin ETF would clearly \u2013 it already is \u2013 benefit the digital currency\u2019s price.\n\nSecond, such a product in the U.S. would likely bring a slew of new participants into the crypto market because some retail investors have been reluctant to embrace crypto due to technological concerns. Said another way, a spot bitcoin ETF could democratize the asset class and there\u2019s precedent for happening \u2013 one set by god ETFs.\n\nWhile crypto enthusiasts and ordinary investors wait on word from the SEC, some of the following ETFs could be worth considering.\n\nBitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ)\n\nThe Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ) is an equity-based fund, but it\u2019s chock full of stocks that fit the bill as \u201ccrypto-correlated.\u201d BITQ, which follows the Bitwise Crypto Innovators 30 Index, is proving as much as highlighted by a gain of 9.28% over the past week.\n\nAs Bitwise itself notes, BITQ\u2019s roster consists of \u201cpicks and shovels\u201d players in the crypto space, including the likes of Microstrategy (MSTR) and crypto exchange operator Coinbase (COIN). Much of the rest of the ETF\u2019s lineup consists of crypto miners \u2013 a group highly tethered to bitcoin\u2019s price action. But there\u2019s more to the story. A recent report by JPMorgan indicates some bitcoin miners are making strides in the artificial intelligence (AI) due to native supercomputing capabilities.\n\n\u201cIn these beta tests, miners are reporting high profitability per unit of power consumption, much above the profitability from bitcoin mining. With bitcoin miners having already secured more than 100MW of long-term contracts with their power grids, if the profitability reported in beta tests is able to be repeated in large scale it would overshadow in the future the revenues coming from bitcoin mining at the moment,\u201d noted the bank.\n\nProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO)\n\nOne of the original futures-backed bitcoin ETFs, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) remains pertinent today because bitcoin futures are, of course, levered to the underlying asset\u2019s price movements. To its credit, BITO, which turned two years old last week, has done a solid job of tracking spot bitcoin prices since inception.\n\nIt goes without saying that BITO would benefit (it already is) from approval of a spot bitcoin ETF, but there are more chapters in this book. Importantly, recent data indicate bitcoin\u2019s correlation to stock is declining, but its correlation to gold is increasing. That fortifies the \u201cdigital gold\u201d thesis.\n\n\u201cWe [view]bitcoin as an investment being a non-sovereign store of value which had potential exposure to economic and internet growth, whilst being largely uncorrelated to other asset classes,\u201d according to CoinShares. \u201cWe also find that in the context of a portfolio, it behaves in a similar manner to other alternative assets in providing diversification, with the exception that its portfolio diversification benefits are far greater than its competitors.\u201d\n\nVanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT)\n\nAs its name implies, the newly minted VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) isn\u2019t a bitcoin ETF. Rather, it\u2019s focused on ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency behind bitcoin. EFUT is one of several new futures-based ethereum ETFs that recently came to market, indicating regulators are warming to non-bitcoin crypto fare in the ETF wrapper.\n\nThat could be one sign that if a spot bitcoin ETF is approve, there could be trickle-down effects to fund such as EFUT. Even if that scenario doesn\u2019t come to fruition, ethereum offers investors an attractive fundamental story unto itself.\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s limited space is managed through fees charged to users for conducting business and value exchange,\u201d according to VanEck research. \u201cThis software is globally hosted and utilizes a protocol to establish a unified understanding of ownership, commercial activity, and business logic. It enables users to conduct commerce without the need for trust in participants or counterparts. Essentially, Ethereum\u2019s core business revolves around selling secure, immutable blockspace that powers internet commerce.\u201d\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

He explained that accomplishing this work requires cultivating a team culture defined by talent, hard work and passion.\n\n\u201cWe hold each other to a very high standard and expect that accountability to be mutual,\u201d Justin said.\n\nHaving a strong culture enables team members to show up to work each day eager to contribute toward the company\u2019s goals, something Matt M., Unchained\u2019s head of product, has seen firsthand. He believes that his team\u2019s work environment \u2014 anchored in empathy, self-motivation and evolution \u2014 is key to their success.\n\n\u201cWe take our craft very seriously and constantly challenge our approach and process to build something that will last long after we are all gone,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe take our craft very seriously and constantly challenge our approach and process to build something that will last long after we are all gone.\u201d\n\nMatt noted that there\u2019s one ritual his team holds sacred: weekly meetings to discuss ongoing initiatives and blockers. It\u2019s critical for his teammates to have space to engage in debates and share constructive criticism.\n\nGiven this focus on empowering employees, Matt added, it\u2019s important for those who join his team to embrace challenges and pursue the unknown without holding back.\n\n\u201cTake the initiative, and get outside of your comfort zone,\u201d he said.\n\nTo inspire team members to continually drive progress, Matt and Justin adhere to a certain set of practices, approaches and beliefs. Read on to learn how each leader builds culture on their respective teams.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnchained\n\nThe \u2018Bitcoin Ethos\u2019\n\nJustin believes that the work Unchained\u2019s engineering team accomplishes requires embodying the \u201cBitcoin ethos\u201d \u2014 meaning it\u2019s transparent, brutally honest and based on proof of work.\n\n\u201cWe want to see a strong sense of ownership, intrinsic drive, a desire to learn and grow and, ultimately, output and results,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that sounds like just the thing you\u2019ve been missing in your career up to this point, we look forward to seeing you in our inbox.\u201d\n\nGuided by this mindset, Justin\u2019s team is responsible for helping support everything that\u2019s ever been created on the bitcoin blockchain; a feat he considers far from simple.\n\n\u201cMaintaining this notion can be incredibly frustrating and challenging, but incredibly rewarding and pride-inducing at the same time,\u201d he said.\n\nAs his team members stay busy accomplishing their work, Justin strives to build a culture that prioritizes setting expectations and communicating frequently and clearly. His team also relies on various rituals to stay motivated, including engaging in an \u201cescape room\u201d exercise, during which team members work together to solve a real-world problem while leveraging the tools available to them to solve issues as quickly as possible.\n\nFor Justin, maintaining traditions like this one is important, as it creates an environment that encourages passion, collaboration, creativity and curiosity \u2014 all of which ultimately benefits both team members and the company as a whole.\n\n\u201cTeam culture leads to coherence, which leads to laser focus, which in turn leads to both collective and individual growth,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTeam culture leads to coherence, which leads to laser focus, which in turn leads to both collective and individual growth.\u201d\n\nThe Keys to Building Culture\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing Matt has learned throughout his career, it\u2019s that culture is difficult to define in writing.\n\n\u201cYou know a good culture when you see one, but each one is unique, and most of the things that make it good are unwritten,\u201d he said.\n\nMatt considers his teammates to be the main driving force behind the team\u2019s culture, influencing each other in a way that \u201cno written artifact ever can\u201d \u2014 which is why he aims to ensure the time he and his peers spend together is as productive as possible. His team structures their day-to-day activities around a six-stage product development process: discovery, build, acceptance, delivery, measure and review.\n\n\u201cThe most important parts of this process are the strategy and discovery phases, which can be summarized by the phrase, \u2018We think before we do,\u2019\u201d Matt explained. \u201cWe don\u2019t immediately jump into the most expensive process any tech company can perform, which is writing code, unless we\u2019ve thought through why we\u2019re doing it and what the plan is.\u201d\n\nWhile Matt naturally keeps an eye on tech trends, such as the emergence of ChatGPT to improve productivity, his main focus is on creating a team culture that is so easy to understand from the outside that it attracts the right people: those who are empathetic and self-motivated.\n\n\u201cThe key is to develop a strong and opinionated culture so it\u2019s clear to outsiders whether they would be a good fit,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best cultures in the world are obvious \u2014 you know exactly who will fit in and who won\u2019t.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin mining stocks are poised for a fall if the cryptocurrency hits this key level - CNBC",
        "content": "Now that bitcoin has pushed above its key resistance level of the year, the pressure is on for mining stocks, some of which could be in trouble if the cryptocurrency doesn't reach $50,000 by the second quarter of 2024. Earlier this week bitcoin climbed as high as $35,000 at one point, after being stuck under $30,000 for several months. But the Bitcoin halving is expected in the spring and it will likely reduce companies' revenue. That means the cryptocurrency may need to rally another 60% by then to lessen the suffering of some high-cost miners. \"Bitcoin prices holding steady at ($28,000-$32,000) is not tenable for a number of crypto companies, and especially not for high-cost miners,\" Needham's John Todaro said in a note this week. \"We anticipate material stock upside for Coinbase and low-cost miners if bitcoin prices surpass $45,000-$50,000 by the anticipated halving date of April 15, 2024, and material weakness if prices cannot sustain $45,000+ post-halving, in particular for high-cost miners.\" \"Post halving, lower-cost miners will take market share while higher cost producers will need to cut hash power contributed to the network until bitcoin prices rise,\" he added. Bitcoin's price is currently sitting just below $34,000, and chart analysts expect higher lows as well as higher highs over the next few months, with some anticipating it reaches $40,000 by the end of 2023. The Bitcoin halving event is highly anticipated event by crypto investors because it historically has set the stage for new bull runs. It takes place every four years when the reward for mining bitcoin \u2013 which makes up a significant portion of mining companies' revenue \u2013 is cut in half. That reduction is mandated by the Bitcoin code to reduce the supply of the cryptocurrency over time. \"The bitcoin mining industry is at a crucible moment as management teams (and investors) weigh the prospects of a bitcoin ETF, which may catalyze a rally, against record hashrate increases and the looming block reward halving that threaten industry revenues and profitability,\" JPMorgan analyst Reginald Smith said in an Oct. 11 note. \"With that as a back drop, we think discipline and timing are paramount and favor operators that offer the best relative value in light of their existing hashrate, operational efficiency, power contracts, funded growth plans and liquidity.\" Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms are the largest mining stocks by market cap. Marathon famously has the highest energy costs and lowest margins, while Riot has relatively low power costs but shares are expensive. CLSK YTD mountain Cleanspark shares year to date CleanSpark is the only mining stock in JPMorgan's coverage universe with an overweight rating, though its price target implies a 12% decline from current levels. Needham highlighted Riot and Cipher as its favorites, noting that their diversified revenue exposure could make impact from the halving more muted. Lower revenue, higher costs Generally, the mining stocks benefit from bitcoin price increases because those translate into higher mining revenue for the company. Riot shares have risen more than 10% over the past week, while CleanSpark climbed 12%, Marathon added 17% and Cipher jumped 40%. But their performance is more complex than that. In addition to their revenue from block rewards about to be cut in half, miners are also facing a steady rise in the network hash rate \u2013 which measures how much computing power the Bitcoin network uses to process transactions and is a key indicator of the network's health. The Bitcoin hash rate has been hitting new all-time highs consistently throughout the year, which is good for the health and security of Bitcoin but tends to hurt miners' revenue. \"There's been more miners that have come to the market with hardware and more people are competing for these coins today than ever before, and that makes the economics for the entire industry challenging,\" Smith said. When it comes to costs, the main one for miners is electricity. Some have a contract with a power producer where they buy a certain amount of power annually at a fixed price. Miners who buy power at spot prices stand to lose from any spike in power prices, often in the summer or winter. Another big cost: hardware. Some miners use older, less efficient mining equipment and may not be able to invest in newer equipment as they juggle other costs and variables. That could be challenging for companies as the halving approaches, but a big enough rally could help. \"If bitcoin goes up or doubles between now and the halving, these machines that I think will be uneconomical at the having could still be economical, and so it really depends on what happens with the price of bitcoin,\" Smith said. \"Roughly 20% of the network is powered by machines that just won't be economical to the next halving so those machines will have to come offline. Depending on who runs them and whether or not that entity has faster machines somewhere else, they may get forced out of the out of the market.\" \u2014CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting."

        "content": "Stefan Thomas, the former chief technology officer of Ripple, holds 7,002 bitcoins, currently valued at $244 million, in a hard drive he can no longer access because he misplaced the digital keys.\n\nThe programmer received these bitcoins in 2011 as payment for an educational video he created about bitcoin, only to lose the access code later that same year.\n\nCrypto security specialists at Unciphered have now thrown Thomas a potential lifeline.\n\nThe firm penned an open letter to him on Oct. 25, claiming they have the technical ability to outsmart Thomas\u2019s \u201cIronKey,\u201d the encrypted USB device, and help him gain access to his bitcoin fortune.\n\nYears ago, Thomas misplaced the paper containing his IronKey password, a device that permits only 10 attempts before permanently encrypting its contents.\n\nAfter fruitlessly trying eight of his go-to passwords, he\u2019s down to his last two guesses.\n\nThe drama gained attention in 2021, following a New York Times article detailing how the programmer had just two shots left to reclaim his crypto stash.\n\nUnciphered has claimed it successfully recovered data from an IronKey similar to Thomas\u2019s, also notably accomplishing this feat for digital culture publication Wired.\n\nThey utilized a \u201csecret cracking technique\u201d over months, permitting them more than the standard 10 attempts, Wired reported.\n\nPooling their resources, the company\u2019s founders reportedly assembled a team called Project Everest, comprising roughly 10 members, including staff and external advisors.\n\nNotably, several team members had previously sharpened their skills at the National Security Agency or similar high-profile government entities.\n\nUnciphered is keeping its research methods and the specific technique used to bypass the IronKey\u2019s guess limit under wraps, citing the potential risk associated with exposing such vulnerabilities.\n\nThe firm says this secrecy is necessary since the outdated IronKey models they breached can\u2019t be updated and might still hold sensitive data.\n\nThomas has so far declined Unciphered\u2019s help, per Wired.\n\nBlockworks has reached out to the former Ripple chief technology officer for comment.\n\nHe is said to have already struck a deal with two other cracking teams \u2014 cybersecurity firm Naxo and independent researcher Chris Tarnovsky \u2014 promising them a reward for unlocking the drive.\n\nYet, Naxo\u2019s progress remains uncertain, and Tarnovsky is waiting for some payment from Thomas to continue.\n\nDespite no success so far from the two parties, Thomas appears to be sticking to his original pact, giving the initial teams more leeway before seeking new aid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that the current team could decide to subcontract Unciphered if they feel that\u2019s the best option. We\u2019ll have to wait and see,\u201d Thomas told the outlet.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "How Important Would a BlackRock Bitcoin ETF be for the Crypto Industry? - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency community has been buzzing over the idea of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) from BlackRock, one of the world's largest asset management businesses. An ETF would provide investors with a more convenient and regulated way to obtain exposure to Bitcoin, potentially opening the door to institutional and retail involvement.\n\nBlackRock is a financial powerhouse:\n\nAccording to the most recent available data, BlackRock is a giant in the asset management sector, managing approximately $9 trillion in assets. It has an impact on traditional asset classes such as equities, fixed income, and alternative assets. Given its stature, every move by BlackRock into the crypto field is closely watched and anticipated.\n\nBTC\u2019s Price Action\n\nThe recent surge in Bitcoin's price is captivating the cryptocurrency world, with the digital currency breaking through the crucial $35,000 threshold. After a relatively lackluster performance in early October, Bitcoin's total gains for the month are now approaching an impressive 29%. While BTC is still a long way off from its all-time high of over $69,000 in November 2021, these price spikes have generated significant excitement in the crypto space.\n\nWhat's driving this bullish sentiment? It's primarily tied to the optimism surrounding the potential approval of the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by U.S. regulators. Last week, Grayscale filed an application that could enable its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) product to operate as a spot Bitcoin ETF. Currently, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has only approved cryptocurrency ETFs based on futures contracts, which derive their value from the expected future price of an asset like Bitcoin.\n\nKeep Reading TradingView Enhances DeFi Tools on Polygon via QuickSwap Partnership\n\nIn July, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals made a significant ruling in favor of Grayscale Investments, rejecting the SEC's opposition to turning GBTC into an ETF. Crypto enthusiasts believe this legal victory may open the door to spot Bitcoin ETFs from not only Grayscale but also other financial giants like BlackRock.\n\nThese positive developments have ignited hopes that Bitcoin's extended crypto winter could be thawing. Since the spring of 2022, the crypto market has weathered challenges, from bankruptcies to regulatory hurdles, causing significant turmoil. Now, investors are pondering whether this surge in Bitcoin's price signifies the end of the crypto winter or if it's merely a temporary respite before further price fluctuations.\n\nThe Search for a Bitcoin ETF:\n\nFor years, the notion of a Bitcoin ETF has been circulating, with many proposals from various businesses submitted to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). So yet, however, none have been approved. A Bitcoin ETF would allow investors to purchase shares that symbolize Bitcoin ownership without having to own the cryptocurrency directly. This format appeals to traditional investors who may be wary of the intricacies and security issues associated with holding digital assets.\n\nWhy BlackRock is Important:\n\nBlackRock's entry into the Bitcoin ETF market would be significant for multiple reasons:\n\n1. Credibility and trustworthiness:\n\nBlackRock has a well-established reputation for risk management and adherence to regulatory regulations. The firm's presence in the crypto market would almost certainly give the industry with the credibility and confidence it desperately needs to attract institutional investors. Because of worries about market integrity and regulation, many institutions have been cautious to invest in cryptocurrencies.\n\n2. Broad Adoption:\n\nBlackRock's ETFs have a proven track record of drawing large quantities of cash. A Bitcoin ETF backed by BlackRock has the potential to bring Bitcoin and the larger cryptocurrency market into the mainstream, making it more accessible to a broader variety of investors. This may result in increasing adoption and acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class.\n\n3. Price Discovery and Liquidity:\n\nETFs are well-known for their liquidity, and a Bitcoin ETF would most likely be no different. Increased liquidity may result in better price discovery in the Bitcoin market, decreasing the volatility that has put some investors off. As a result, Bitcoin may become a more appealing alternative for portfolio diversification.\n\n4. Regulatory History:\n\nIf the SEC approves a BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, it will set a major regulatory precedent. Other asset managers and financial institutions are likely to follow suit, resulting in an explosion of bitcoin ETFs. This could be a watershed event in the evolution of the cryptocurrency sector.\n\n5. Risk Reduction:\n\nSecurity issues are frequently cited by investors as a barrier to participation into the cryptocurrency market. Investors might acquire exposure to Bitcoin through a regulated and custodied vehicle with a BlackRock-backed ETF, eliminating the risks associated with self-custody and private key management.\n\nUncertainties and Challenges:\n\nWhile the benefits of a BlackRock Bitcoin ETF are obvious, there are several hurdles and unknowns:\n\n1. Regulatory Obstacles:\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has been hesitant in issuing Bitcoin ETFs, citing worries about market manipulation and investor protection. To get approval, BlackRock's proposal would need to address these concerns.\n\n2. Impact on the Nature of Bitcoin:\n\nSome believe that the adoption of an ETF will change Bitcoin's core essence, transforming it from a decentralized digital money to a more controlled and institutionalized asset.\n\n3. Market Influence:\n\nThe issuance of a Bitcoin ETF may result in large price volatility in the cryptocurrency. Investors should brace themselves for possible turmoil.\n\n4. The competition:\n\nIn the battle to develop a Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock will face competition from other financial behemoths such as Fidelity. In this competitive environment, the first-mover advantage could be critical.\n\nThe Verdict: A Game Changer?\n\nA BlackRock Bitcoin ETF has the potential to transform the cryptocurrency industry, ushering in a new era of institutional involvement and widespread adoption. However, it must also manage regulatory obstacles and uncertainty.\n\nUltimately, whether or not a BlackRock Bitcoin ETF is approved, the crypto industry is on an unstoppable path toward more acceptance and integration into the regular financial world. The likelihood of a major entity like BlackRock entering the market demonstrates the rising acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a viable asset class. This breakthrough will be eagerly watched by the crypto community, investors, and regulators alike, as it has the potential to transform the future of finance."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nUnciphered claims to have developed a method that can crack into IronKey encrypted hard drives.\n\nThe company now wants to demonstrate its technique on a drive owned by f ormer Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas.\n\nThomas famously lost the password to his IronKey, which contains the keys to BTC worth around $240M today.\n\nSo why has he declined Unciphered\u2019s offer?\n\nImagine leaving $240M in a safe only to forget the combination. Now imagine that the safe explodes destroying whatever\u2019s inside it after ten failed attempts at the code. Former Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas found himself in precisely this situation when he forgot the password to an IronKey encrypted hard drive that held the private keys to a crypto address containing 7,002 BTC.\n\nNow, more than a decade since his story was first publicized, Unciphered, a company that specializes in helping people just like Thomas, claims to finally have a solution to his exploding safe dilemma.\n\nNo Back Door To IronKey Encryption\n\nFirst developed thanks to a $1.4 million grant from the Department of Homeland Security, IronKey drives are used by government and military officials, intelligence agencies, private businesses, and anyone in possession of valuable secrets for whom data security is tantamount.\n\nGiven the USB drives\u2019 reputation for strong encryption, they have also proven popular among cryptocurrency investors like Thomas, who use them to protect their keys from prying eyes.\n\nDo you require military-grade security? \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f The #KingstonIronKey D500S USB Flash Drive features flagship military-grade security that makes IronKey the most trusted brand to safeguard your classified data. \ud83d\udd10#KingstonIsWithYou pic.twitter.com/h3Hg5cihuJ \u2014 Kingston Technology (@KingstonTechBiz) September 22, 2023\n\nBack in 2021, a spokesperson for Kingston Technology, the company that makes IronKeys, confirmed to TechRadar that even they couldn\u2019t help Thomas recover his private keys.\n\nA company spokesperson explained that Kingston\u2019s complete range of encrypted USB flash drives permits a maximum of 10 password attempts. Beyond this limit, the encryption key erasion occurs, making the data irretrievable. Thomas has already made 8 unsuccessful attempts to guess the code.\n\n\u201cThere is no backup password or alternative method, other than the original password that was set up by the user to retrieve the data,\u201d the Kingston spokesperson said.\n\nUnciphered Wins Race To Crack Digital Safe\n\nSince the company was founded in 2021, Unciphered has already made a name for itself by cracking into popular crypto hardware wallets, including the OneKey and Trezor T models.\n\nBut if breaking into those devices was impressive, there\u2019s a reason the team dubbed their efforts to crack the IronKey \u201cProject Everest.\u201d\n\nMarking a milestone in the history of digital safecracking, Unciphered now claims to have developed a method that allows it to bypass IronKey\u2019s ten-attempt limit, rendering its encryption susceptible to brute-force attacks.\n\nIn an open letter to Thomas, the firm said its technique is the result of months of research by its team of engineers and cryptographers, who have offered to break into his device and recover the $240M Bitcoin keys.\n\n\u201cWe started by reverse engineering all of the inter-chip communication protocols, then the firmware of the controller and cryptographic implementation details, and ultimately pieced together all aspects of how your device works,\u201d the letter stated.\n\nBefore reaching out to Thomas, Unciphered first enlisted the help of a Wired journalist to verify that their method worked.\n\nLo and behold, the company was able to break into an IronKey S200 and gain access to a secret phrase the reporter had stored on the device in order to prove they had done it.\n\nThomas Declines Offer To Unlock $240M Worth Of Bitcoin\n\nWhile most people would leap at the opportunity to unlock $240M worth of Bitcoin, according to Wired, Thomas declined the company\u2019s offer before they even got around to discussing fees or commission.\n\nApparently, the former Ripple CTO has already made a deal with two other cracking teams and has promised to split a portion of the locked-up Bitcoin between them if they succeed in breaking his IronKey\u2019s encryption.\n\nFor now, it seems as if Thomas is happy to honor his word and wait to unlock his private keys. But his story teaches an important lesson: just because a security challenge is insurmountable today, doesn\u2019t mean it will be forever.\n\nWhen Thomas was first locked out of his IronKey, the Bitcoin it controlled access to was worth $140,000. No small sum, but significantly less than its current value. Thankfully, he kept the drive safe for all those years and may soon be able to reap the rewards of his patience."

        "content": "Bitcoin Dominance Surges to 54% as Halving Approaches\n\nBitcoin's market dominance has reached a 30-month high of 54%, indicating the top cryptocurrency's growing strength leading up to the halving event in April 2024.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving occurs every four years, reducing the mining reward per block and lowering the influx of new Bitcoin into the market. With the next halving, the reward will be cut from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block.\n\nAs Bitcoin's supply growth slows while demand rises, its dominance increases. Bitcoin maintained over 80% dominance in the 2017 bull market, but it fell to the 50-60% range in the 2021 bull run.\n\nNow, ETF excitement and the halving event have brought its dominance back up to 54%, the highest level since April 2021. The rise coincided with Bitcoin rallying above $30,000 amid news of a potential spot Bitcoin ETF approval in the US.\n\nNoelle Acheson, a market analyst, says Bitcoin's safe-haven appeal and ETF momentum have helped boost its dominance over altcoins like ether. She notes Bitcoin tends to lead in early market cycles before investors get more comfortable with higher-risk assets.\n\nWith Bitcoin beating most altcoins in recent performance, its bullish momentum could signal an eventual altcoin rally once money begins flowing from Bitcoin into other crypto assets. For now, its dominance reflects its strength as the crypto market awaits the next major catalyst."

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy as Bitcoin Hits 18-Month High on Fresh Optimism - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The Bitcoin (BTC) rally, which had stalled two months back after making a solid turnaround earlier this year, once again rebounded on Oct 24. The cryptocurrency jumped nearly 6% to $34,872 to hit its highest level in almost one-and-a-half years on growing speculation that Blackrock\u2019s spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) will soon be a reality.\n\nTuesday\u2019s rally followed a 10% surge in Bitcoin on Oct 23, when it crossed the $35,000 mark. The enthusiasm surrounding Bitcoin sent other related stocks and major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) on a rally. Ethereum prices jumped 4.5% on Oct 23 to $1,786.30, hitting its highest level since August.\n\nInvestors Optimist about Bitcoin ETF\n\nThe approval of a Bitcoin-backed exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to boost demand as it would enable more conservative investors to own Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies via traditional stock markets.\n\nThe approval is also likely to attract new investments into the crypto sector, which could further boost demand.\n\nCryptocurrencies made a solid rebound in 2023 after suffering majorly last year as the Federal Reserve launched an aggressive monetary tightening campaign to curb multi-decade high inflation, which saw the central bank hiking interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022.\n\nMoreover, a couple of unfortunate events, the Terra Luna crash and a major fraud leading to the bankruptcy of FTX, saw a slump in the crypto market.\n\nCryptocurrencies staged a solid rebound this year, with Bitcoin hitting $31,000 in early July before the rally came to a halt. Bitcoin price has since been rangebound and hovering around the $25,000 mark as investors struggled to gauge the Fed\u2019s next move with its interest rate hike policy.\n\nHowever, renewed optimism among investors sent Bitcoin prices up last week after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decided not to appeal its loss against Grayscale Investments in the D.C. Circuit court.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpeculation is now rife that the modification made to the Registration Statement for the Ishares Bitcoin Trust, submitted to the SEC on Oct 18, suggests that Blackrock might buy Bitcoin this month to provide initial capital for its upcoming spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThis definitely bodes well for the crypto market.\n\nOur Choices\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the value of the NVDA stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market.

        "title": "The Race for the First U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF - U.S. Global Investors",
        "content": "It\u2019s not a matter of if, but when.\n\nI\u2019m talking, of course, about the long-awaited approval of a U.S.-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence now estimate there\u2019s a 90% chance that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will give the go-ahead to such an investment product by January 10, 2024.\n\nMany presenters at this week\u2019s European Blockchain Convention (EBC) were even more optimistic, saying they believe a Bitcoin ETF will appear on the market by the end of this year.\n\nMr. Market appears to agree. Responding to strong speculation that BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest investment management firm, is preparing to \u201cseed\u201d its iShares Bitcoin ETF this month with an unknown amount of capital in anticipation of its imminent approval, investors bid up the price of the digital asset this week to more than $35,000, a price we haven\u2019t seen in nearly a year and a half. That\u2019s roughly double what Bitcoin started the year at. For comparison\u2019s sake, Ether, the second largest digital token by market cap, is up around 50% year-to-date.\n\nInvestors Seeking Direct Access to Bitcoin\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs are already available to certain investors. Canada has had them for years. Europe launched its first one in August. But even when combined, Canada and Europe are dwarfed by the size of the U.S. stock market, which accounts for close to 60% of the total global equity market value. Of the top 10 largest investment management firms, only two\u2014France\u2019s Credit Agricole and Germany\u2019s Allianz\u2014are non-American.\n\nTo date, the only way for U.S. investors to get exposure to Bitcoin\u2014besides buying the asset outright\u2014is through futures, options and other derivatives. The largest of these products, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), has been trading publicly since 2015 and currently has over $21 billion in assets under management (AUM).\n\nBut trusts are unwieldy products compared to ETFs, which are traded on exchanges throughout the day and can be highly liquid.\n\nPlus, investors want access to spot Bitcoin prices, just as they have access to spot gold prices with physical gold-backed ETFs.\n\nGrayscale knows all of this, of course, which is why it\u2019s filed to convert GBTC to an ETF. And now, like BlackRock and a number of other firms that have also submitted applications for a Bitcoin ETF\u2014they include Fidelity, Invesco, Franklin Templeton, VanEck and WisdomTree\u2014Grayscale must play the waiting game at a time when many market experts are concerned that the U.S. could be falling behind other jurisdictions when it comes to Bitcoin investment, not to mention regulation.\n\nSome firms are choosing to act now. Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest, which also has a Bitcoin ETF in the pipeline, has begun selling shares of GBTC in anticipation of its successful conversion into an ETF.\n\nUnderstanding the Impact of a U.S. Spot ETF\n\nSo what are the implications?\n\nAssuming for the moment that the SEC is in fact ready to give its blessing to a BlackRock-issued Bitcoin ETF, it\u2019s possible we may never see the token below $30,000 again. In such a scenario, the New York-based investment firm would likely become the world\u2019s largest institutional holder of Bitcoin, creating a potential supply crunch. Remember, Bitcoin production is capped at 21 million, and the \u201chalving\u201d\u2014when the reward for mining Bitcoin is cut in half\u2014is coming up in around six months.\n\nThe availability of a Bitcoin ETF would also finally herald the arrival of institutional investors. For many financial advisors, fiduciaries and others, Bitcoin is not an approved wealth management strategy. A spot ETF, on the other hand, would be.\n\nAccording to estimates made by blockchain and digital asset company Galaxy, a U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETF would attract $14 billion in investor inflows in the first year alone. This would accelerate to $27 billion in the second year and, at the end of the third year following its launch, nearly $40 billion.\n\nThis is only an estimate, and no one can predict the future with absolute certainty. But for speculators, accumulating Bitcoin now\u2014before an ETF hits the U.S. market\u2014may end up being a very profitable decision.\n\nCertainty in an Uncertain World\n\nI\u2019m pleased to report that enthusiasm was very high at the ECB, held in beautiful Barcelona. It was the most well-attended event in the conference\u2019s history, with some 5,000 people in attendance\u2014double the turnout from earlier this year.\n\nDespite it being a blockchain/Web3/DeFi conference, Bitcoin was the $35,000 gorilla in the room. As a number of presenters said, the asset offers certainty in a highly uncertain world. This tracks with my recent comments that Bitcoin represents private property rights and, more broader, human rights.\n\nWith a spot ETF looking more and more likely, now could be an unprecedented opportunity to get exposure. Remember, however, to do your own due diligence and keep in mind that volatility is much greater than what you find in traditional investment instruments. For that reason, I recommend a weighting of no more than 2% of your total portfolio.\n\nIndex Summary\n\nThe major market indices finished down this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.14%. The S&P 500 Stock Index fell 2.67%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.62%. The Russell 2000 small capitalization index lost2.76% this week.\n\nThe Hang Seng Composite gained 1.49% this week; while Taiwan was down 1.86% and the KOSPI fell 3.04%.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury bond yield fell 7 basis points to 4.837%.\n\nAirlines and Shipping\n\nStrengths\n\nThe best performing airline stock for the week was SkyWest, up 13.1%. SkyWest reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.55, better than Visible Alpha\u2019s consensus of $0.39. The beat versus consensus was driven by better-than-expected revenue. The company introduced fourth quarter block hour production guidance of flat-to-down slightly sequentially or up 2% year-over-year. This implies fiscal year 2023 block hours down 9% year-over-year, ahead of prior expectations of down 11%.\n\nAccording to Bank of America, air cargo freight rates bottomed in early September and have sequentially moved higher, sustaining at 30%-35% above 2019 levels in the past month. The bank attributes the uptick to demand seasonality around the end-of-year peak as well as the imposition of fuel surcharges given rapid moves higher in jet fuel in the third quarter.\n\nIAG reported third quarter operating profit before the exceptional items of \u20ac1,745 million, 12% ahead of company consensus, which had been revised up following first half of the year results. The beat relative to consensus was driven by lower non-fuel unit costs (-3.5%) and better yields (up 2% year-over-year).\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe worst performing airline stock for the week was Frontier, down 10.5%. Hawaiian Air reported an adjusted loss per share of ($1.06), worse than FactSet\u2019s consensus of ($0.94). The miss versus consensus was driven by worse revenue and non-operating costs. Near-term revenue trends are being pressured by the negative impact of the Maui wildfires and accelerating industry capacity growth to Japan where demand is still recovering, while near-term unit cost growth is higher-than-expected due to an elevated number of aircraft on the ground.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley, weekly container spot rates confirm a downtrend while quarterly results from overseas firms also reveal guidance cuts and anticipated container losses. Consensus forecasts have not sufficiently factored in prospects of a net loss at Ocean Network Express (ONE), but expectations are falling.\n\nVolaris reported another challenging quarter, missing Bloomberg consensus estimates on the operating and bottom-line levels. The top line was at $848 million (up 10% year-over-year), nearly in line with consensus. Net income came in at -$39 million, below the Street at $2 million.\n\nOpportunities\n\nAccording to UBS, the latest UBS Evidence Lab Global Travel Manager Survey sheds light on expected business behavior in 2024 and beyond and still suggests business traffic recovery. Most travel managers see budget increases next year with on-average travel budgets expected to increase by 10% year-over-year and most expect a full recovery of travel budgets back to 2019 in the next two years.\n\nAccording to Stifel, over the course of the past 30 years, after adjusting for inflation and operating costs, the cash-on-cash return of a one-year time charter contract relative to the price of a new ship was 10% for a VLCC and 11% for a Capesize vessel. Currently, newbuild prices are 23% higher than the 20-year average for VLCCs and 26% higher for Capesize vessels. For a scrubber fitted VLCC and Newcastlemax (slightly larger modern version of a Capesize) the adjusted returns are 11.5% and 6.5%. This implies fewer ships will be added in the future.\n\nMedia is reporting that in response to increased fuel prices, Qantas is increasing fares by an average of 3.5%. Qantas Group had absorbed recent fuel hikes but according to a company spokesman, the current tensions in the Middle East, broader economic factors and a weaker Australian dollar means that fuel prices are expected to stay elevated for some time. Even after the adjustment, the fares are expected to remain below the peaks of last year.\n\nThreats\n\nMorgan Stanley believes there is a mounting risk of weakening pricing in long haul markets such as the Atlantic and Europe-Middle East Africa next year, with capacity scheduled to accelerate materially in these markets through winter.\n\nAccording to Bank of America, air cargo supply continues to grow around 10% year-over-year with surging belly capacity on international flight restoration and limited supply discipline from freighters for now. The bank sees more pressure ahead from further restoration of passenger flights in the upcoming winter 2023-2024 season, while freighter supply discipline could remain elusive until rates turn loss-making, particularly with new freighters getting delivered.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley, Spirit Airlines had the highest percentage of cancelations occurring over the past week at 4.5% of scheduled flights (compared to 0.1% the prior week). Spirit saw a jump in cancelations due to \u201ca necessary inspection of a small section of 25 of our aircraft,\u201d which will be out of service for several days. The airline noted the inspection was due to an abundance of caution and expects the network will take several days to recover.\n\nLuxury Goods and International Markets\n\nStrengths\n\nHermes reported a revenue increase of 16% in the third quarter. Sales in the United States and Europe were strong due to high demand for the costly Birkin and Kelly handbags. Growth in America topped estimates, while the performance in Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, was in line, reports Bloomberg.\n\nThe U.S. continues to report solid economic data. The Manufacturing PMI and Service PMI came in stronger than expected. The Preliminary Manufacturing PMI for October was reported at 50 versus the expected 49.5. The Service PMI climbed to 50.9, above the expected 49.9. Annualized GDP for the third quarter was released at 4.9%, above the expected 4.5%.\n\nDeckers, a footwear designer and distributor, was the best performing S&P Global Luxury stock, gaining 15.7% in the past five days. Shares gained almost 20% on Friday after the company reported strong quarterly sales. Deckers reported $6.82 earnings per share in the quarter, compared with $3.80 a share, in the same period a year ago.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nAll Kering brands reported a revenue drop in the third quarter except eyewear. The company\u2019s biggest brand, Gucci, reported a 7% decline in revenue, below the expected drop of 6.21%. Sales at Yves Saint Laurent slid 12% last quarter and sales at Balenciaga fell 15%, both missing estimates. The group sales declined 9%, missing estimates.\n\nThe preliminary Eurozone Manufacturing PMI for October was reported at 43.0, below the expected reading of 43.7, and September\u2019s 43.4. In the past 20 years, Manufacturing PMI dipped to the low 30 level twice: in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and in 2008 due to the global recession.\n\nSleep Number, a U.S. mattress maker and wellness technology leader, was the worst performing S&P Global Luxury stock, losing 17.5% in the past five days. On Friday, shares closed at a 52-week low on a light news flow. The prior week, Sleep Number was the best performing name among the luxury index members.\n\nOpportunities\n\nBank of America\u2019s luxury research team recommends selecting names within luxury sectors that are exposed to more affluent customer bases like Louis Vuitton, Hermes, Cucinelli, and Zegna. The super-rich are less affected by the economic downturn and will most likely continue to spend their wealth on luxury goods and services.\n\nChina announced measures to support its economy this week. The government approved CNY 1 trillion ($139.3 billion) in additional government bond issuance for disaster relief and reparations. Proceeds are to be transferred to local governments with half to be used this year. In addition, China lifted its 2023 budget deficit to around 3.8% of gross domestic product from an originally set 3%. Economists expect rate cuts to follow.\n\nAccording to a report released by global consultancy firm Kearny and beauty e-commerce platform Luxasia, South Asia and India are poised to be the next \u201cgold rush\u201d markets for luxury beauty. The report estimated that the two regions together will increase in size from $4.5 billion in 2021 to $12.7 billion in 2031, growing at a CAGR (cumulative annual growth rate) of 11%, compared to the estimated global luxury beauty industry growth rate of 4-6%.\n\nThreats\n\nAccording to Bank of America, in the United States, luxury spending relative to 2019 has peaked in the first quarter of 2022. The chart below shows seven quarters of acceleration in card spending, and so far, six quarters of corrections. BofA predicts luxury revenue growth to trough in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe European Central Bank is determined to bring inflation lower to its target of 2%, but this week the bank has decided to keep rates on hold after 10 consecutive hikes. The pause follows a slowdown in euro-are prices, but concerns are mounting that a recession could be coming to the region. If the Israel-Hams conflict worsens, this could result in higher energy prices.\n\nChris Watling, chief executive of financial advisory firm Longview Economics, warned that consumers are quickly running out of excess cash, while household savings are coming under pressure. Many strategists, asset managers, and CEOs remain concerned about the longer-term economic outlook, worrying about the United States falling into recession.\n\nEnergy and Natural Resources\n\nStrengths\n\nThe best performing commodity for the week was natural gas, rising 9.14%, partly on short covering prior to contract expiring at the end of the week and a slightly colder weather forecast. Chevron Corp. said it will no longer use put options to hedge the crude oil production it is acquiring from Hess Corp. once the deal is complete. Hess is one of a handful of major U.S. oil players that still participates in the options market to guarantee a minimum price for its barrels. In its most recent earnings report, published in July, the company had contracts in place that locked in $70 a barrel for about 80,000 barrels a day of WTI production, and $75 for about 50,000 barrels of Brent production for the rest of this year.\n\nAccording to RBC, uranium spot prices rebounded back near recent highs as activity picked up during the week, with a pick-up in financial/company buying and utility interest. On the news front, Euratom released its 2022 Annual Supply report which highlighted a projected moderate increase in uranium requirements and a decrease in inventories, while uranium requirements in the EU are generally covered by contracts through 2025.\n\nAccording to Bank of America, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) authorized transactions in Venezuela\u2019s oil and gas sector including production, lifting, sale and exportation of oil and gas (including provision of related services and payment of invoices). The licenses authorizing such transactions are valid through April 2024. The authorizations follow agreements between the government and the opposition to hold free elections on the second half of 2024. The licenses will be renewed only if Venezuela meets its commitments under the electoral roadmap as well as other commitments with respect to those who are wrongfully detained.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe worst performing commodity for the week was crude oil, dropping 3.33%, likely in response to dropping oil sanctions on Venezuela. Oil also fell amid signs Israel is rethinking the scope of a potential invasion of Gaza, at least temporarily containing the conflict in the Middle East. West Texas Intermediate fell below $86 a barrel in a volatile session that saw prices swing in a more than $2 range. Israel appeared to hold off on its widely expected ground offensive into the Gaza Strip to buy time for the release of hostages held by Hamas.\n\nA federal judge has rejected an argument by 34 coal-fired power plant owners and operators that they were not aware of five patents for a mercury-removal process before Midwest Energy Emissions Corp. sued alleging infringement. Midwest says the defendants are liable for induced and contributory infringement of certain method claims of the asserted patents by manufacturing and selling refined coal to non-party power plants.\n\nAccording to UBS, steel prices in Europe have continued to fall in October, with steel prices down \u20ac15/ton to \u20ac645/ton in Germany (the lowest level since 2020). Confidence in EU demand strength remains low and ordering activity at domestic mills subdued, in part due to the arrival of large volumes of imported steel.\n\nOpportunities\n\nChina is planning to boost its strategic stockpiles of cobalt, according to people familiar with the matter, just three months after the government last bought the metal used in everything from electric-vehicle batteries to aerospace alloys. The National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration, which manages the state\u2019s commodity stockpiles, has agreed to buy about 3,000 tons of cobalt, said the people, who are not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nChina is planning to boost its strategic stockpiles of cobalt, according to people familiar with the matter, just three months after the government last bought the metal used in everything from electric-vehicle batteries to aerospace alloys. The National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration, which manages the state\u2019s commodity stockpiles, has agreed to buy about 3,000 tons of cobalt, said the people, who are not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nSQM increased its bid for Azure Minerals to $3.52, ~A$1.6Bn, up 46% from its previous bid of $2.41. Azure stock was ~$1.70 prior to the original SQM bid in July. The current bid = +100% premium, where Azure was trading prior to the original approach. However, that bid may face some headwinds as Gina Rinehart\u2019s Hancock Prospecting has acquired 18% of Azure. SQM can pull out of the proposed transaction if another shareholder acquires more than 19%. Albermale Corp. was trying to buy Liontown Resources Ltd. but Rinehart blocked that transaction too.\n\nThreats\n\nCopper has gone from jump to slump this year as enthusiasm about China\u2019s reopening gave way to concerns over demand, ballooning stockpiles, and pricing patterns that speak to abundant, near-term supply. Benchmark three-month futures on the LME just sank to the lowest since last November and, absent a run of micro-evidence suggesting conditions are bottoming out, the bias will remain for further weakness into the year-end. At present, cash metal trades well below futures, known as contango.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley, steel global output came in below its five-year average as production declined in China (-6% year-over-year), while it rose sequentially on day-adjusted basis due to Europe and Iran. Morgan Stanley sees further downside to production run-rates, largely driven by China\u2019s seasonal slowdown and Europe\u2019s accelerating capacity cuts.\n\nRussia\u2019s oil flows are climbing steadily as Moscow\u2019s adherence to a pact with Saudi Arabia to keep barrels off the global market shows signs of waning. About 3.53 million barrels a day of crude was shipped from Russian ports in the week to October 22, an increase of 20,000 barrels a day from the previous seven days, tanker-tracking data monitored by Bloomberg show. That lifted the less volatile four-week average to 3.5 million barrels a day, the highest since June, and up by about 610,000 barrels a day in the past two months.\n\nBitcoin and Digital Assets\n\nStrengths\n\nOf the cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap, the best performer for the week was FLOKI, rising 84.97%.\n\nBitcoin surged above $31,000 for the first time since July as a U.S. federal appeals court made final a ruling that effectively clears the way for the issuance of an exchange traded fund (ETF) that invests directly in the cryptocurrency, writes Bloomberg.\n\nDeclining national fiat currencies and a generally unstable economy have helped propel Bitcoin to all-time high prices in Turkey and Nigeria, despite the asset trading 50% below its peak in U.S. dollar terms. Recent price surges have caused Bitcoin to cross price peaks against the Turkish lira and Nigerian naira, according to Bloomberg.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nOf the cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap, the worst performer for the week was Bitcoin SV, down 13.40%.\n\nBitcoin faces a reality check if ETFs spark a \u2018sell-the-new\u2019 pivot. Chart patterns hint that the Bitcoin rally has become stretched, and the founder of Venn Link Partners expects short-term selling if U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved, writes Bloomberg.\n\nBitcoiners might be excited, but Grayscale\u2019s proposal to turn its Bitcoin trust into an ETF still needs a green light from the SEC, and that is not a sure thing. SEC Chair Gary Gensler could still find a second reason to deny the proposal after choosing not to appeal a court ruling striking down his first one, writes Bloomberg.\n\nOpportunities\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s digital token, JPM Coin, now handles $1 billion worth of transactions daily and the bank plans to continue widening its usage. JPM Coin enables wholesale clients to make dollar and euro-denominated payments through a private blockchain network, according to Bloomberg.\n\nShares of Coinbase may move 9% higher after the company reports earnings, according to options data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nTaiwan has officially proposed a draft crypto act for the first reading. The proposal to regulate crypto assets passed the first reading at the Legislative Yuan. It would require all crypto platforms operating in Taiwan to apply for a permit, writes Bloomberg.\n\nThreats\n\nSam Bankman-Fried will take the stand to defend his actions in the lead-up to the collapse of his digital asset empire. This comes after taking a beating from former colleagues who described him as the mastermind of a years long scheme to defraud FTX customers and investors, writes Bloomberg.\n\nBinance is experiencing technical issues with crypto withdrawals, it said in a post on X and withdrawals will be temporarily unavailable, writes Bloomberg.\n\nCrypto platform Gemini Trust is suing bankrupt crypto lender Genesis Global Holdco LLC in an attempt to determine who rightfully owns a slug of shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, now worth nearly $1.6 billion, writes Bloomberg.\n\nGold Market\n\nThis week gold futures closed at $2,016.20, up $21.80 per ounce, or 1.09%. Gold stocks, as measured by the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, ended the week lower by 1.27%. The S&P/TSX Venture Index came in off just 0.04%. The U.S. Trade-Weighted Dollar rose 0.37%.\n\nStrengths\n\nThe best performing precious metal for the week was palladium, up 1.78%. U.S. stocks are in their third monthly decline while underwhelming corporate earnings and yields climbing above 5% have investors pondering their choices. When other assets don\u2019t look so safe, gold may find a more welcome buyer. As of Friday afternoon, gold is up more than 10% year-to-date and the S&P 500 is now up only 7%. Russia saw gold production drop 9.2% year-on-year and 4.1% month-on-month in September 2023, the Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) said in a statement. Despite the declining monthly data, the overall volume of domestic gold production rose 1.7% for the first nine months of this year.\n\nEldorado Gold reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.17, well above consensus of $0.04, partially driven by better-than-expected costs across the portfolio. Third quarter production of 121,000 ounces gold was pre-released, with higher quarter-over-quarter production, while consolidated AISC of $1,177 per ounce was 21% below consensus AISC of $1,486 per ounce.\n\nAlamos reported third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.14, above the consensus of $0.12. Production of 135,400 ounces at total cash costs of $835 per ounce and AISC (all-in sustaining costs) of $1,121 per ounce beat consensus by 12%, 4%, and 7% respectively, driven by continued outperformance at Mulatos. The company has increased its fiscal year 2023 production guidance from 480-520,000 ounces gold to 515-530,000 ounces gold and reiterated its cost guidance with AISC of $1,125-$1,175 per ounce.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe worst performing precious metal for the week was silver, down 1.34%. According to Morgan Stanley, gold ETF holdings are now at the lowest level since early 2020 with nearly continuous outflows since April 2022. This shows the challenge of gold as an investment when bond yields are rising, as it struggles to compete in portfolios as a non-yielding asset.\n\nGold edged lower as benchmark Treasury yields hit the highest since 2007 while fears of a spiraling conflict in the Middle East receded. The yield on 10-year U.S. bonds topped 5% on Monday for the first time in 16 years, driven by expectations the Federal Reserve will keep monetary policy tight for a long period. That is typically negative for bullion, which bears no interest.\n\nOceanaGold reported third quarter production of 99.0 k ounces gold, below the 104.1 k ounce consensus and AISC of $1,911 per ounce gold above the $1,757 per ounce consensus. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.00, missing the consensus estimate of $0.03. Concurrently, OceanaGold updated its fiscal year 2023 cost guidance, increasing forecasted cash cost by $50 per ounce to a range of $850 \u2013 $950 per ounce, while AISC by $125 per ounce to a range of $1,550 \u2013 $1,650 per ounce, reflecting the impact of lower production from Haile.\n\nOpportunities\n\nGold priced in Swiss francs shows that the precious metal could sustain its upward momentum should geopolitical tensions persist. The Swiss franc and gold have seen a surge in demand as haven assets amid the turmoil in the Middle East. Gold has gained more than 8% against the dollar so far in 2023, while the Swiss franc has appreciated by more than 3%, solidifying its position as the leading performer among G-10 currencies.\n\nAccording to recent data from the U.S. Treasury, Chinese investors sold $21.2 billion of U.S. assets in the month of August. Chinese investors may be among the first to direct their funds to gold markets. There are two main theories about the reasons of China\u2019s rapid selling of U.S. assets. First, the Asian nation needs to support the local currency. The second potential reason for China\u2019s activity lies in the realm of geopolitics.\n\nWheaton Precious Metals has entered into a definitive Precious Metal Purchase Agreement with Waterton Copper Corp. on its 100% owned Mineral Park Mine located in Arizona, USA. Wheaton will pay Waterton total upfront cash consideration of $115M in four payments during construction (three installments of $25M and a final installment of $40M) with construction to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2025. Under the stream, Wheaton will purchase 100% of the payable silver from the project for the life of the mine.\n\nThreats\n\nBitcoin continues to gain ground, taking bullish cues from traditional rate-sensitive assets like gold. Prices are up 14% for the month, with gold registering a much lesser 6.7% gain. Gold, however, picked up a bid a week before Bitcoin, as the outbreak of tensions between Israel and Hamas, alongside continued speculation about the end of the Fed tightening cycle, signaled an inflationary regime ahead.\n\nPanama\u2019s labor unrest surrounding First Quantum\u2019s new contract to operate its copper and gold mine is still facing challenges. Protests have broken out and now Panama\u2019s Supreme Court noted it will consider a lawsuit which alleges the nation\u2019s contract violates their constitution. Frano-Nevada Corp. has the most exposure to First Quantum through its royalty on the gold production. Regardless of the outcome, Panama makes itself look unsuitable for new mining investment currently.\n\nSibanye Stillwater Ltd. said it will enter talks with labor unions over the possible restructuring at some of its South African platinum group mines that could affect more than 4,000 workers. The consultations will concern four shafts \u2013 two of which have reached the end of their producing lives \u2013 at the company\u2019s Rustenburg, Marikana and Kroondal projects, the Johannesburg- based firm said in a statement.\n\nU.S. Global Investors, Inc. is an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d).

        "title": "Bitcoin soars amid buzz of potential ETF approval: Is a crypto renaissance on the horizon? - Forkast News",
        "content": "In this issue\n\nETF price pump Ethereum NFTs on the up Working blues\n\nFrom the Editor\u2019s Desk Dear Reader, It\u2019s not like it came out of nowhere. We\u2019ve known for some time about the potential for a spot Bitcoin ETF bounce and the buzz it can bring back to the crypto industry. But what many were unprepared for was the huge surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price over the past week. Briefly topping US$35,000 during Tuesday trading, Bitcoin is up around 23% for the past 7 days as we go to print. It started Oct. 16. Crypto media picked up on a post claiming the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had approved an application by investment giant BlackRock to create a spot Bitcoin exchange traded fund for the U.S., the world\u2019s largest economy. Bitcoin\u2019s price shot up nearly 10% to around US$30,000 before tracing back the gains when it was revealed the post was a fake. But the buzz was real. Confirmation of a win for digital asset investment firm Grayscale over the SEC then filtered through on Monday, Oct. 23, electrifying the market. The SEC, the regulator announced, will not contest Grayscale\u2019s right to convert its GBTC (Grayscale Bitcoin Trust) into a spot Bitcoin ETF. SEC head Gary Gensler confirms that the regulator is currently considering \u201ceight to ten\u201d of these spot Bitcoin ETF applications. Among those are applications from some of the biggest investment names out there. The consensus is that once one application is approved, the rest will follow. While obstacles remain \u2014 not least that the SEC may well find another way to oppose the creation of a spot Bitcoin ETF as a new financial instrument \u2014 the Grayscale announcement was seen as a major win for crypto. And don\u2019t we all need a win about now? A spot Bitcoin ETF will allow investors to trade the coin on regular stock exchanges. That\u2019s a big deal. Many think it will open the door for a multibillion dollar inflow of institutional cash into the Bitcoin market. But those gains aren\u2019t in the bag yet and we should temper our excitement over what is still a complicated process. Even if a U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF is approved and the bounce returns to the market\u2019s step, the wider industry needs to capitalize and make the most of that momentum. Perhaps then, after what has been a truly rough 18 months, the industry can return to its previous heights and beyond. Until the next time, Angie Lau,\n\nFounder and Editor-in-Chief\n\nForkast.News\n\n1. ETF price pump\n\nBitcoin surges past $35,000 after Grayscale\u2019s GBTC conversion gets a nod. Image: Canva\n\nWith one announcement Monday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may have inched closer to green-lighting a U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The belief is that once one such ETF is approved, others will follow, catalyzing institutional investment in the blockchain industry.\n\nThis sentiment was bolstered as the SEC announced it won\u2019t challenge Grayscale\u2019s conversion of its GBTC into a spot Bitcoin ETF. The news contributed to a 10% spike in Bitcoin\u2019s price, briefly sending the coin above US$35,000 for the first time since May 2022.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s GBTC, with assets worth $16.7 billion, is currently the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency fund. Following the SEC announcement, the company expressed its readiness and eagerness to transition GBTC into a Bitcoin ETF, emphasizing a commitment to its investors.\n\nThe introduction of a spot Bitcoin ETF is expected to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the relatively niche cryptocurrency market. As Jack Jia of Unlimit highlighted, such ETFs will streamline the investment process for potential crypto investors, making the onboarding process smoother via traditional brokers.\n\nHeavyweight financial institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest are also in the queue, having submitted their applications to the SEC. Historically, the SEC has shown reluctance to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF, voicing concerns about crypto market liquidity and potential price manipulation.\n\nVivian Fang, a finance professor and fintech expert, feels the SEC is becoming more receptive to the idea, especially given its recent acknowledgments of the Bitcoin market\u2019s resilience to potential manipulation.\n\nForkast.Insights | What does it mean? There is a certain irony that the SEC is now \u201cwarming up,\u201d as Vivian Fang put it, to the idea of a spot Bitcoin ETF. The Grayscale announcement arrived only a week after the fake BlackRock ETF news originally sent Bitcoin\u2019s price skyrocketing after months of losses and inactivity across crypto. The SEC\u2019s reasoning for now entertaining the idea of a spot Bitcoin ETF is that the Bitcoin market is sufficiently mature and large enough to protect investors from manipulation and overnight fluctuations in price. But the fake BlackRock announcement has, to some extent, shown that argument to be porous. Total transaction volume in the wider crypto market is still way down from its bull market heights, while Bitcoin\u2019s dominance of that market is now 53%. Whether or not the fake news post about BlackRock\u2019s successful ETF bid was a deliberate attempt at market manipulation, or simply a prank gone wrong, the effect was still a manipulation of the market. To the tune of US$100 million in BTC liquidations over the course of 30 minutes, to be exact. Will that now impact the SEC\u2019s thinking? Is governance and general reporting standards surrounding crypto robust enough to justify a spot Bitcoin ETF \u2014 a financial instrument expected to finally entice the mountains of institutional cash we\u2019ve all been waiting for into the industry? The moneypeople holding the purse strings seem to think so. At least \u201c8 to 10\u201d major investment funds are, according to Gary Gensler, in line to make that bet. BlackRock, it was revealed on Monday, has had a ticker for its spot Bitcoin ETF listed online since August. However, in the days since the ticker\u2019s existence was first discovered, the listing has been taken down, only to then be restored. While this may be nothing, and the existence of a ticker itself could just be part of the application process rather than anything concrete, what it does show is that we shouldn\u2019t take anything for granted.\n\n2. Ethereum NFTs on the up\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT Index is up 6.28% in the past seven days. Ethereum NFT sales volume is up 43.40%, hitting US$45.6 million in the week.\n\nAverage Sale price of Ethereum NFTs climbed to US$389.74 on Oct. 24, the highest it\u2019s been since average sale prices reached US$429.36 on July 13.\n\nIt was a 63-day high for Ethereum NFT sales, its highest mark since Aug. 22, when sales reached US$8.9 million.\n\nETH price climbed 13.70% in the past seven days to US$1,788.29, helping to drive up the price of NFTs on the network, which are denominated by the cryptocurrency.\n\nForkast.Insights | What does it mean? Many cryptocurrencies are reaching yearly highs this week and Ether seems to be on its way to similar heights. The sudden increase in Ether\u2019s price has brought the value of NFTs up along with it, and the excitement surrounding the movement is also driving sales volume. Traders who believe that crypto prices will continue to climb may be tempted to purchase some of the top NFT collections, most of which have been at all-time low prices. In the past seven days, multiple collections saw their floor price climb considerably. That includes Doodles (+34%), Nakamigos (+27%), CloneX (+23%), Milady Maker (+22%), and Azuki (+19%). So-called profile picture (PFP) collections benefited the most from this surge in trading. Bored Ape Yacht Club (US$6 million), Mutant Ape Yacht Club (US$2.5 million), and CryptoPunks (US$2.4 million) NFTs claimed 3 of the top 4 spots in the NFT collection rankings by sales volume on CryptoSlam.io. NFT sales and value increasing on Ethereum also has a correlation to declining sales on the social finance platform, Friend.tech. On Oct. 24, over US$7.6 million worth of keys were sold on FriendTech, the same day Ethereum NFTs hit their 63-day high of US$8.01 million in sales. With Yuga Labs\u2019 Ape Fest 2024 taking place in Hong Kong next week, hype around NFTs will be in full force in the Asia markets. Anticipation that the SEC may approve a U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF should also continue to drive NFT trading action. Many traders are now hoping to see sustained growth throughout the rest of the year.\n\n3. Working blues\n\nAmid a 63% plunge in global crypto market cap, major blockchain firms like Parity, announce workforce reductions. Image: Parity/Canva\n\nParity Technologies, the developer of the Polkadot blockchain, is cutting around 30% of its workforce, primarily targeting marketing and business development sectors.\n\n\n\nParity CEO Bj\u00f6rn Wagner told Bloomberg via a spokesperson that the company aims to allow affected employees to continue contributing to Polkadot. Wagner said that Parity\u2019s financial health and regulatory engagement \u201cremains robust.\u201d\n\nPolkadot\u2019s DOT token has a market value of US$5.35 billion and is ranked 15th in market cap among cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis wave of layoffs comes as the global crypto market capitalization plunged 63% from its all-time high. Widespread staffing reductions have become a trend in the crypto sector throughout this year, reflecting continued bear market conditions.\n\nEarlier in August, blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis announced it is shedding 15% of its 900 staff members, marking its second round of layoffs this year.\n\nBinance.US, the American subsidiary of global cryptocurrency exchange Binance, announced last month that it had cut one-third of its workforce.\n\nBlockchain and cryptocurrency developers like Polygon Labs and Circle have also announced job cuts over the course of the past year."

        "content": "Developed by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, Bitcoin is the world\u2019s first and largest cryptocurrency. It has increased in value from $0.30 to $16,811 today, with its highest recorded value being $69,000 in November 2021. Only 21 million bitcoins exist, and currently, there are 19 million bitcoins in circulation.\n\nAs exciting as Bitcoin may sound, it is a very risky investment. Its value is highly speculative and extremely volatile. So before investing in or acquiring bitcoins, make sure to learn as much as you can about it and understand the risks involved.\n\n10 Easy Ways to Get Bitcoins in 2024:\n\nWhere to Get Bitcoins\n\nThere are two main ways to get bitcoin: buy them or earn them.\n\nWhen buying bitcoins, you exchange real-world money (called fiat currency) for cryptocurrency. To do so, you can purchase bitcoins via these channels:\n\nCryptocurrency Exchanges\n\nInvestment Brokerage Firms\n\nPayment services like Paypal\n\nOffline services like Bitcoin ATMs\n\nPeer-to-peer exchanges\n\nThere are also numerous ways to get bitcoins without spending actual money. You only need to trade your time and use computer resources. Here are some quick ways to get bitcoin for free:\n\nPlaying mobile games that pay in bitcoins\n\nMining Bitcoins\n\nAccepting bitcoins as payment for rendered services\n\nWriting about Bitcoins and becoming a topic expert\n\nUsing a bitcoin faucet.\n\nUnderstanding the Bitcoin Wallet\n\nBefore you can start buying and spending bitcoins, you need to have a bitcoin wallet. It\u2019s like a physical wallet where you keep actual currencies. In reality, bitcoin wallets only store the encrypted keys of your bitcoins. You use these keys to access your actual bitcoins, which are located as part of the blockchain.\n\nThere are two general kinds of bitcoin wallets:\n\nHot Wallets\n\nThink of hot wallets as online wallets that run on the internet. You can access them on any device that has an internet connection. Hot wallets are convenient and easily accessible\u2014they allow for quick Bitcoin transactions.\n\nHowever, they\u2019re vulnerable to attacks, so it\u2019s best to avoid using them to store large amounts of bitcoins. You should also protect your wallet with good security measures such as strong passwords, safe browsing settings, and two-factor authentications.\n\nCold Wallets\n\nCold wallets, on the other hand, are offline wallets. It is not connected to the internet and can be stored on any device or physical location. They can be as simple as a piece of paper where the encrypted keys are printed or as complex as USB devices that are virus-proof.\n\nCold wallets are not easily accessible to hackers and can serve as a safer way to store a large amount of bitcoins. You can keep them in a secure place that\u2019s accessible only to you, such as safety deposit boxes.\n\nOn the downside, cold wallets are not easily accessible and can be complicated to set up. It would also be hard to retrieve if you lose it or forget where you\u2019ve kept it. Use cold wallets for storing bitcoins that you don\u2019t intend to trade or spend. Also, keep the paper or device in a location that you can easily access and remember.\n\nFive Common Ways to Get Bitcoins\n\nThe fastest way to get bitcoins is to buy them using fiat currencies. You can do these through the following channels.\n\nCryptocurrency Exchange\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges are marketplaces where sellers and buyers trade bitcoins for fiat money (real currencies) or other digital currencies (other cryptocurrencies). They are similar to stockbrokers and can either be centralized or decentralized. They provide tools within their platform that allow you to easily and conveniently trade bitcoins.\n\nPros:\n\nIt\u2019s quick and easy to setup an account.\n\nYou automatically get a cryptocurrency wallet where you can store your bitcoin.\n\nThere are many platforms to choose from, allowing for competitive rates and fees.\n\nSome platforms offer insurance for potential failures on their end like a security breach.\n\nCons:\n\nCentralized exchanges are prone to hacking, since they use private servers in a central location.\n\nIt\u2019s possible for your wallet to be exposed to hackers.\n\nYou don\u2019t own the keys to the wallet they provide. It\u2019s advisable to still keep a separate wallet for storing large sums of bitcoin.\n\nIn the case of decentralized exchanges, it can be used for any means including illegal uses.\n\nPopular Platforms: Coinbase, Binance US, Gemini, Kraken\n\nThings to Consider When Choosing A Cryptocurrency Exchange:\n\nReputation of the platform (Is it highly trusted?)\n\nTransaction fees and other associated fees (Are they economical?)\n\nSecurity of the exchange (Do they provide some form of insurance in case of breach?)\n\nWallet storage (Are you allowed to transfer your bitcoins to a personal bitcoin wallet?)\n\nEase of using the platform (Are they easy to use especially for beginners?)\n\nHow to Get Started:\n\nChoose a trading platform. For beginners, we recommend going to popular and established ones. Create an account by providing all the required information and wait for it to be approved. Once approved, fund your account using your bank account, credit card or debit card. Exchange the funds for bitcoins. Some exchanges offer an easy BUY NOW button. Some offer more advanced options. Once you\u2019ve purchased your bitcoins, the exchange will take care of storing them. In case you want to move it to your personal wallet, simply initiate a transfer.\n\nInvestment Brokerage Firms\n\nDue to the rise of cryptocurrencies, some traditional investment firms already offer bitcoin together with stocks, bonds, options, and other financial products as investment assets. These are accessible through online portals and easily traded on a smartphone just like traditional stocks.\n\nPros:\n\nMost investment firms don\u2019t charge commissions for successful trades.\n\nYou can use the platform to trade other types of investment assets.\n\nSome firms, like eToro, allow you to copy successful trades of other users.\n\nCons:\n\nOnly a handful of investment brokerage firms handle bitcoin trading.\n\nThese platforms don\u2019t have an online wallet to store bitcoins. You need to create a separate wallet outside the platform.\n\nCryptocurrency investments are not protected by SIPC (Securities Investor Protection Corporation) unlike other investment products.\n\nPopular Platforms: Robinhood, eToro\n\nHow to Get Started:\n\nChoose an investment brokerage firm. Sign up for an account on their website and provide the required details. Verify your identity. Fund your account using your debit card or bank account. Begin trading.\n\nPayment Services\n\nWith the popularity of Bitcoin, payment services like Paypal, Venmo and CashApp now allow users to buy, sell, and hold bitcoins. If you have cash earnings stored in these apps, you can use them to purchase bitcoins.\n\nPros:\n\nYou don\u2019t need to create a separate account on a crypto exchange platform or an investment brokerage platform.\n\nYou can buy bitcoins for as low as $1 making it easy to get started and learn more about cryptocurrency.\n\nYou can earn cashback in the form of bitcoins.\n\nCashApp allows users to earn bitcoins for every purchase made with their app.\n\nSome credit card companies offer Bitcoin reward cards that let you earn back bitcoins from purchases made with the card.\n\nCons:\n\nSome third-party providers do not accept Paypal as a means of purchasing bitcoins.\n\nPayment services charge hefty fees especially when purchasing using a credit card.\n\nBitcoins purchased and stored in a Paypal wallet cannot be transferred to another online wallet.\n\nPopular Platforms: Paypal, CashApp, Venmo\n\nHow to Get Started:\n\nCheck your current payment platform if they already offer bitcoin purchases. If they do, follow the process for purchasing bitcoin. For most payment providers, it\u2019s as simple as clicking the BUY button. Make sure your account is funded. You can purchase bitcoins for as low as $1. The payment provider takes care of automatic conversions.\n\nBitcoin ATM Machines\n\nBitcoin ATM machines are like cash ATM machines. You can deposit and withdraw cash as you buy and sell bitcoins. You visit a physical place where these machines are located and insert cash into the machine. You use the inserted cash to purchase bitcoins that are transferred to an online wallet.\n\nPros:\n\nMachines are easily accessible.\n\nThey accept cash which means you don\u2019t need to link banking information. This is helpful for people who don\u2019t use formal banking systems.\n\nThey are convenient and immediate. You can immediately buy or sell bitcoins using these machines.\n\nNewer machines have started dispensing cash in exchange for selling bitcoins.\n\nCons:\n\nThese machines charge hefty fees like a purchase fee and a conversion fee that are way higher than what crypto exchanges charge.\n\nRecently, they have started requiring government-issued IDs before a transaction can be completed. This eliminates the anonymity these machines once offered.\n\nApps for Finding Bitcoin ATMs: Coin ATM Radar, LibertyX, CoinMap\n\nHow to Get Started:\n\nCreate a bitcoin wallet and have the details ready. You can take note of the wallet\u2019s alphanumeric code or simply download the QR code . Visit the nearest Bitcoin ATM machine. Create an account with the ATM operator. Enter your bitcoin wallet information. Insert cash into the machine. The machine will automatically compute how much bitcoin is equivalent to the cash you inserted. This is based on the prevailing value of bitcoin plus the machine\u2019s fees. Review your transaction. The machine will display how much bitcoin you\u2019ve bought and the fees they charged. Confirm the transaction. The bitcoins will be deposited to your bitcoin wallet.\n\nP2P Exchanges\n\nAnother way to get bitcoins is by using peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange networks. These are direct connections between the buyer and seller.\n\nPros:\n\nYou can search for the best deals offered by different sellers.\n\nMost P2P exchange platforms have trust rating systems, so you can vouch for the reputation of the seller.\n\nYou enjoy very low transaction fees, since transactions are conducted directly between buyer and seller.\n\nYour private information is protected, given how P2P exchange platforms don\u2019t collect private information from both buyer and seller.\n\nPayment methods are flexible. Sellers can choose how to get paid and buyers can choose how to pay for purchases.\n\nCons:\n\nSlow trading speeds. The seller may decide to delay the transaction for various reasons.\n\nProne to fraud. While most P2P exchanges have security measures against fraud, it\u2019s still possible that fraudulent sellers and buyers exist in the platform.\n\nP2P platforms don\u2019t have an inherent bitcoin wallet to store your bitcoins. You need to create a separate wallet to store your bitcoins.\n\nPopular Platforms: LocalBitcoins, BinanP2P\n\nHow to Get Started:\n\nCreate an account on a P2P platform. Browse seller posts and decide on a trade you like. Contact the seller. Most platforms have a buy button that allows you to specify how much bitcoin you want to buy. Pay for the purchased bitcoins using your preferred payment method. Send proof of payment to the seller. At this point, the platform holds in escrow the bitcoin you purchased. Once the seller confirms payment, the bitcoin is released to your bitcoin wallet. In case of disputes, you can contact the P2P platform. Most have customer support to settle disputes.\n\nFree Ways to Get Bitcoin\n\nUsing real money and buying bitcoins is not the only way to get bitcoins. If you have the time to allot to it, you can get bitcoins for free.\n\nThere are many ways to do this. The most popular and easiest ones are listed below.\n\nLearning About Cryptocurrency\n\nDid you know that by simply expanding your knowledge about cryptocurrency, you can earn free bitcoins? Coinbase, a popular cryptocurrency website, rewards you with cryptos for every knowledge course you finish. The more you learn about cryptocurrencies, the more cryptos you get.\n\nYou can then exchange these cryptos for bitcoins. Check out Coinbase Earn to learn more.\n\nPlaying Online Games\n\nSome online games available in the market reward players with small amounts of bitcoins as prizes. This encourages players to keep playing and even watch ads.\n\nThe more players participate in these games, the more companies are encouraged to show ads in exchange for bitcoins. However, be warned. Most of the prizes are really very low.\n\nBitcoin Rewards Website\n\nBitcoin has become a popular reward for doing various odd tasks. There are websites that will give you free bitcoin in exchange for completing various tasks, such as answering surveys, testing website functionalities, taking quizzes, and so forth.\n\nThe rewards may be small but they add up over time.\n\nBecoming a Bitcoin Expert\n\nIf you learn a lot about bitcoin, you can start writing about it. There are sites who will pay bitcoins for your expertise. You can even continue and learn about different cryptocurrencies.\n\nA number of websites pay for this kind of knowledge. However, you must really sound knowledgeable in order to land such gigs. The best thing about pursuing this path is you can eventually become one of the top influencers in the crypto space.\n\nOnline Shopping and Cash Backs\n\nA popular browser add-on, Lolli, lets you earn cashback in the form of bitcoins for every successful transaction on their more than 1000 partner websites.\n\nYou\u2019ll automatically get a cash back for whatever product you\u2019re buying online, as long as it\u2019s from a Lolli partner. If you love shopping online, this is an easy and quick way to get bitcoins.\n\nOther Ways to Get Bitcoins\n\nThere are still other means to get free bitcoins. The ones listed above are the easiest and most rewarding ways for beginners.\n\nOther methods, like mining bitcoins or joining airdrops, are simply too resource-intensive or risky. We didn\u2019t include them in this list, but you can always research more about them.\n\nYou can also start accepting bitcoins as payment for selling items like influencer merch or rendering services like brand promotions. Bear in mind that accepting bitcoins as a form of payment is taxable in some countries. Be sure to review your tax laws to make sure you\u2019re compliant.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe world of cryptocurrency is a brand-new avenue for all of us. It has gained a lot of momentum and traction in the past years and more people are already open to the possibilities it brings.\n\nHowever, investing in cryptocurrencies, including bitcoins, is risky. They are highly volatile, and despite having huge gains today, their values may plummet tomorrow. You should always exercise caution when dealing with bitcoins.\n\nBut if you already understand the risks and are willing to take them, you can explore the numerous paid and free ways to get bitcoins. It\u2019s evident that cryptocurrencies are here to stay. So, if you can get your head in the game, now is the right time to do so."

        "title": "CryptoFinance: Cultures clash as bitcoin ETF turns rebellion into money - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Cryptocurrencies myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nHello and welcome to the latest edition of the FT\u2019s Cryptofinance newsletter.\n\n\u201cThe Times 03/Jan/2009: Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\u201d\n\nIn the early days of 2009, bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto etched that headline into the first batch of bitcoin transactions ever processed.\n\nThe message was a nod to bitcoin\u2019s intended purpose, as laid down in the initial white paper: a form of electronic cash that offered people the chance to separate their financial lives from the control of powerful intermediaries such as banks, regulators or the government.\n\nCrypto\u2019s confident, scornful and punky start came to mind this week for some when bitcoin surged to roughly $35,000. It was a small but meaningful moment: all those losses sustained after the Terra stablecoin collapsed and sent a whole heap of trouble pulsing through the market were erased.\n\nBut what triggered the gains was, well, nothing very much.\n\nThe market is on tenterhooks so much because BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, may soon receive regulatory approval in the US to launch a cash bitcoin exchange traded fund, something that invests directly in bitcoin and can be traded as easily on the New York Stock Exchange as Apple.\n\nBut this has been the case for months and the approvals may not come until next year. What seemed to have got bitcoin enthusiasts excited was BlackRock\u2019s ETF added to a list of eligible assets that are held at the US securities clearing house.\n\nThis is the equivalent of a harried waiter in a crowded restaurant clearing a table, before ushering you over; a necessary step but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to eat imminently.\n\nNor was the spike an isolated incident. Last week bitcoin leapt 8 per cent on a false rumour that BlackRock had indeed secured regulatory approval.\n\nThe assumption is that approval will inspire a new wave of inflows into a market that has long struggled with next to no liquidity.\n\nAs Jeremy Senderowicz of law firm Vedder Price told me: \u201cTo have an ETF launch necessarily represents the maturation of an asset class: it\u2019s a sign that it has arrived in the format that anyone can access . . . you would think that could only be a good thing for crypto.\u201d\n\nBut good news for Wall Street\u2019s crypto-curious is not being welcomed everywhere. Crypto\u2019s longtime believers, who have followed bitcoin\u2019s development since the early days, tell me a financial revolution is being traded in for a spot on Wall Street.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a maddening betrayal of crypto\u2019s foundational principles, a sellout to traditional finance and a surrender of our ideals,\u201d said Charles Storry, head of growth at crypto index platform Phuture.\n\n\u201cSatoshi Nakamoto\u2019s vision of a permissionless liberation from government now lies in the hands of the world\u2019s largest establishment, asking America\u2019s regulators to approve something that makes bitcoin just like any other asset class,\u201d he added.\n\nSome still fight the good fight. Last month Erik Voorhees, founder of crypto platform ShapeShift and ardent crypto-libertarian, tried to rally the faithful:\n\n\u201cBefore crypto, all movement of funds required someone\u2019s permission . . . try moving ten thousand dollars across a border and you\u2019ll be swiftly reminded of the permissions that are imposed on you . . . so thank God a permissionless form of money was invented.\u201d\n\nBut the excitement around BlackRock illustrates how the narrative on crypto has moved on as the reality of life intrudes. There is an argument that crypto should take what it can get: ETF approvals would be rare wins for a world whose former figurehead is on trial for fraud in New York, and whose biggest surviving companies are facing lawsuits for violating securities laws and illegally accessing US customers.\n\nIt\u2019s also easy to imagine that a successful BlackRock application would send the price of bitcoin flying.\n\n\u201cA BlackRock approval can open the tap for a lot of wealth managers and asset managers to take even a small position on bitcoin, it can potentially be a game-changer,\u201d added Javier Rodriguez-Alarcon, chief commercial officer at XBTO, a digital assets platform.\n\nBut not even a potential bull run for bitcoin can shake off the sense of capitulation for the industry\u2019s die-hards.\n\nOnly El Salvador and the Central African Republic adopted bitcoin as legal tender, nor did it really bank the unbanked, or seriously provide a financial lifeline to those living under an authoritarian regime.\n\nInstead Wall Street has executed its own takeover. Satoshi envisaged a unfluctuating world, where records are immutable and there are a finite number of bitcoins, 21mn. An ETF is a securitised version of bitcoin but it can be replicated, scaled and traded to match demand.\n\nAs Matthew Cloete, head of marketing at Ryze, a London crypto trading firm, notes:\n\n\u201cMost people think that the ETF is going to be the catalyst for the next bull market, which just goes to show how far we have strayed from the original vision, almost as if we\u2019re throwing in the towel.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on crypto\u2019s hopes for a BlackRock ETF? As always, email me at scott.chipolina@ft.com.\n\nFTX trial latest\n\nThe trial of Sam Bankman-Fried took another turn when the disgraced former FTX kingpin decided he would testify in his own defence.\n\nDefence lawyers don\u2019t usually advise this course of action to clients but observers say the prosecution has put forward a powerful case. Plus, it\u2019s no surprise to anyone who has followed Bankman-Fried closely that he would want to tell his version of events.\n\nBankman-Fried\u2019s defence got off to an unusual start: the judge sent the jury home while he decided what evidence can be repeated in front of jurors when they return today.\n\nHis lawyers have already publicly laid out the plan: SBF was following legal advice in many of his actions and lawyers help draft many of the policies, such as data retention (or lack of it) and how customer money intended for FTX ended up in his Alameda Research trading arm.\n\nSoundbite of the week: Senator Lummis turns up the heat\n\nThe wind has changed direction on crypto in Washington after Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel this month. Last week, I reported that Israeli law enforcement authorities ordered the closure of more than 100 Binance accounts, and Tether had frozen 32 addresses linked to \u201cterrorism and warfare\u201d in Israel and Ukraine.\n\n\n\nNow senator Cynthia Lummis and representative French Hill have urged the Department of Justice to speed up investigations into crypto\u2019s two largest players: the Binance exchange and Tether, the stablecoin provider.\n\n\u201cWe urge the Department of Justice to carefully evaluate the extent to which Binance and Tether are providing material support and resources to support terrorism through violations of applicable sanctions laws and the Bank Secrecy Act. To that end, we strongly support swift action by the Department of Justice against Binance and Tether to choke off sources of funding to the terrorists currently targeting Israel.\u201d\n\nData mining: A final word on BlackRock and bitcoin\n\nThe importance of the US regulator to a bitcoin ETF approval is underscored by location of bitcoin assets under management. The US is far ahead of the rest of the world, as figures from CCData show. Moreover the total value of bitcoin under management has increased by almost $3bn this month, to the highest point since June.\n\nFT Cryptofinance is edited by Philip Stafford.

        "title": "3 Buy-Rated Crypto Stocks to Consider as Bitcoin Prices Break Out - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTCUSD) prices have been on a wild ride lately, with the digital currency surging to its highest levels since May 2022 on growing hopes that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might finally give the green light to a spot Bitcoin ETF. Bitcoin has now doubled in value on a year-to-date basis, and is hovering right around $34,000 at last check.\n\nCoinbase (COIN), which is a big player in the crypto world, seems pretty confident that this ETF is on the horizon - but shares of the online exchange have shed more than 21% in the last three months while BTC has broken out, and analysts have a tepid consensus rating of \u201chold\u201d on COIN. However, with asset management heavyweights like BlackRock (BLK) getting ready to cash in on regulatory clearance for BTC-based ETFs, it's worth taking a look at some investing opportunities among cryptocurrency and blockchain stocks.\n\nHere, we'll highlight three top-rated crypto stocks, all priced under $10 per share, that have been moving higher with BTC as the market braces for a potentially massive new wave of institutional investing dollars.\n\nBITF: Riding the Bitcoin Wave\n\nBitfarms Ltd. (BITF) is a Canadian Bitcoin mining company offering analytics and engineering services. In August 2023, Bitfarms reported mining a cool 383 new bitcoins - down from August 2022, but up sequentially from July's numbers. Plus, BTC mined through the first eight months of 2023 were higher YOY.\n\nLike most other miners, BITF is in the Bitcoin business - so when BTC prices are up, so is BITF's stock. The stock is up 162.5% YTD to trade around $1.15, and has a market cap of $243 million.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nAll four analysts covering BITF are giving it the green light, with three shouting \"strong buy,\" and one rating the stock a \"moderate buy.\" The average target price for BITF is $3.19, hinting at potential 177% upside from current levels.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nCIFR: Mining for Profits in the Bitcoin Boom\n\nCipher Mining Inc. (CIFR), a New York-based Bitcoin miner, is outperforming broader BTC prices this year. The company has a market cap of $883 million, and CIFR currently trades right around $3.33 per share.\n\nSince the start of 2023, CIFR's stock has rocketed by 492%, leaving BTC's 105% gain in the dust.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nPlus, all seven analysts tracking CIFR rank it a strong buy overall. Five are shouting \"strong buy,\" one's going with a \"moderate buy,\" and one suggests a \"hold.\"\n\nThe mean target price for CIFR is $5.00 is also interesting, given the stock's major rally already this year. That target indicates an expected upside of more than 50% from current levels, suggesting plenty more gains ahead.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nRIOT: Capitalizing on the Crypto Craze\n\nColorado-based Riot Platforms Inc. (RIOT) might have renamed itself from Riot Blockchain, but the company's primary business is still focused on Bitcoin mining and infrastructure. So, when Bitcoin's up, RIOT's stock is on the rise too.\n\nRIOT's got a relatively hefty market cap of $1.945 billion, and trades just below $10 per share. On a year-to-date basis, RIOT has outpaced BTC prices by gaining 193% - and Wall Street sees more upside ahead.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nOut of the 8 analysts following the shares, 6 call RIOT a \u201cstrong buy,\u201d 1 suggests a \u201cmoderate buy,\u201d and only 1 is daring to go against the grain with a \u201cstrong sell.\u201d The mean target price for RIOT is $16.67, which represents a healthy premium of 68.5% to current levels.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nThe Future of Crypto Stocks Amid Bitcoin's Breakout\n\nIn conclusion, as Bitcoin continues to flex its muscles and break out, these three buy-rated crypto stocks look intriguing. They've been riding the Bitcoin wave, and with favorable analyst ratings, they're catching the attention of investors.\n\nBut here's the kicker: the crypto market can be an extremely volatile space. CIFR has a beta of 2.50, BITF has a beta of 3.28, and RIOT's beta is 4.31 - indicating all three stocks are considerably more volatile than the S&P 500 Index ($SPX), and are best suited for those investors with a healthy risk appetite. So while the potential upside is appealing, the heightened volatility and continuing regulatory overhang are worth keeping in mind here.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ebube Jones did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Should You Buy Coinbase Stock on Higher Bitcoin Prices? - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Valued at $18.45 billion by market cap, Coinbase Global (COIN) is among the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. Coinbase went public in 2021, and currently trades 79% below all-time highs.\n\nHowever, COIN has staged a remarkable comeback year-to-date, rising 114% in the first 10 months of 2023 - with recent gains fueled by fresh regulatory optimism for cryptocurrencies.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nMeanwhile, with none other than fund manager Cathie Wood taking advantage of the recent rally to unload her shares, let\u2019s see whether Coinbase stock is worth buying on the latest headlines.\n\nCoinbase Stock Lags Bitcoin's Price Surge\n\nThe performance of Coinbase is closely tied to key cryptocurrency asset prices, such as Bitcoin (BTCUSD) and Ethereum (ETHUSD), which account for a majority of the exchange's trading volumes. Generally, trading volumes are higher in a bull market, allowing Coinbase to benefit from higher fees and commissions. Alternatively, volumes drop when sentiment turns bearish, resulting in lower revenue.\n\nFor instance, Coinbase increased sales from $533.7 million in 2019 to $7.83 billion in 2021 as cryptocurrency prices exploded higher. But in the last 12 months, its sales have fallen to $2.7 billion, with Bitcoin currently trading about 50% below all-time highs.\n\nA key driver for the recent rally to 18-month highs in Bitcoin is investor optimism over the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. The long-awaited approval of Grayscale's fund could clear the way for more listings from large asset management companies, including BlackRock (BLK) and Invesco (IVZ) - which potentially opens the floodgates for billions more investor dollars to pour into the sector.\n\nHowever, investors should note that COIN is hardly a perfect proxy for Bitcoin prices, despite its dependence on the volatile market. Over the last three months, COIN is down 24%, while BTC is up 15%. And in the last month alone, COIN's 7% gain significantly lags a nearly 30% rise in BTC.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nCoinbase Stock: Looking Beyond Bitcoin\n\nTo its credit, Coinbase has expanded its portfolio of products and solutions over the past two years, enabling it to expand its ecosystem significantly and reduce its dependency on volatile crypto trading volumes. For instance, in 2021, the company\u2019s transaction revenue accounted for 87% of sales. In Q2 of 2023, transaction sales accounted for less than 50% of total revenue.\n\nIn particular, Coinbase is banking on its subscription and services business to gain traction. This segment includes products such as interest income, custodial fees, staking, and blockchain rewards. Revenue in its subscription and services business grew from just $45 million in 2020 to $792 million in 2023. In Q2, subscription sales more than doubled to $335.4 million.\n\nBut for Coinbase to remain a solid long-term investment option, Bitcoin will have to gain widespread adoption globally. Bitcoin was built to replace fiat currencies and facilitate global transactions at a low cost. However, the lack of regulatory clarity has remained a significant headwind - which is why crypto-related investments reacted so strongly to recent indications of a potential SEC victory.\n\nAnalysts Call COIN a Hold\n\nCoinbase enjoys a first-mover advantage and is forecast to end 2023 with sales of $2.78 billion, while adjusted earnings are forecast at $1.73 per share. That said, COIN trades at 6.7x forward sales, which is quite steep for an unprofitable company that's projected to report steeper losses into the next fiscal year.\n\nOut of the 22 analysts covering Coinbase stock, the average recommendation is a \u201chold.\u201d Six recommend \u201cstrong buy,\u201d one recommends \u201cmoderate buy,\u201d eight recommend \u201chold,\u201d two recommend \u201cmoderate sell,\u201d and five recommend \u201cstrong sell.\u201d The average target price for COIN is $83.84, which is 12.5% above the current trading price.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Better Bitcoin Stock: Marathon Digital vs. Riot Platforms - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin's (BTC -2.88%) price has surged more than 30% over the past month for two main reasons. First, BlackRock's (BLK -2.09%) proposed Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) briefly appeared on a clearing house eligibility list, which suggested it might be making gradual progress toward a regulatory approval. If approved, BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF would be the first ETF to be pinned to Bitcoin's spot price, which would set it apart other Bitcoin ETFs which are currently tethered to Bitcoin futures.\n\nSecond, the escalating Middle East conflict has been driving investors toward safe haven assets like gold again. Bitcoin is still more volatile than gold, but it could be lumped together with the precious metal as more investors pivot away from fiat currencies while inflation, high interest rates, and global turmoil rattle the global markets.\n\nTherefore, it wasn't surprising to see shares of Marathon Digital (MARA -9.90%) and Riot Platforms (RIOT -7.88%), the two biggest pure-play Bitcoin miners in the world, rally about 11% and 14%, respectively, over the last month. But should investors buy either of these stocks as a long-term play on Bitcoin's growth?\n\nThe differences between Marathon and Digital\n\nMarathon and Riot were both once tiny patent holding companies which abruptly reinvented themselves as Bitcoin miners. Riot, which was formerly known as Bioptix, made that leap in 2017, and Marathon followed that example in 2020. Both companies then ordered tens of thousands of top-tier Antminer mining systems from Bitmain.\n\nMany investors initially dismissed those rebrandings as cheap attempts to cash in on the market hype about Bitcoin. Yet both companies eventually grew their mining operations into sustainable businesses.\n\nRiot had deployed 98,694 miners by the end of September, which gave it a total hash rate capacity (the overall efficiency of its mining operations) of 10.9 EH/s (exahashes per second). It produced an average of 12.1 BTC daily during the month. Marathon has deployed 155,910 miners as of this writing, which gives it a much higher total hash rate capacity of 23.1 EH/s. It was producing an average of 41.1 BTC daily at the end of September.\n\nSimilar headwinds and tailwinds\n\nBoth companies faced tough headwinds over the summer as Bitcoin prices slumped while inflation and adverse weather conditions caused energy prices to soar. However, Riot and Marathon both started to grow their average daily BTC production again on a monthly basis in September as Bitcoin's price rose and energy prices stabilized.\n\nAvg. Daily BTC Production 5/2023 6/2023 7/2023 8/2023 9/2023 Riot Platforms 21.8 15.3 13.2 10.8 12.1 Marathon Digital 40.2 32.6 37.9 34.3 41.1\n\nBoth companies also liquidated some of their own BTC holdings to raise fresh cash over the past year. In September, Riot sold 340 of its mined BTC while Marathon sold 800 BTC. Those ongoing sales should provide both companies with a stable flow of cash to purchase even more miners and scale up their operations.\n\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2023, Riot held $289 million in cash and $221 million in BTC on its balance sheet. Marathon held $114 million in cash and $380 million in BTC.\n\nBoth companies should have enough capital to ride out their near-term losses. Analysts expect Riot's revenue to rise 22% to $318 million this year as it narrows its net loss from $510 million to $169 million. They expect Marathon's revenue to surge 210% to $366 million (mainly driven by the opening of two new plants and a new joint venture in Abu Dhabi) as it narrows it net loss from $687 million to $61 million.\n\nMarathon seems like the larger and stronger miner, but it has two notable weaknesses. First, it still faces an Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) probe regarding its joint venture with Beowulf Energy to secure favorable energy rates. Second, its debt-to-equity ratio of 1.2 is much higher than Riot's ratio of 0.1.\n\nThe better buy: Marathon Digital\n\nBoth stocks have similar valuations: Riot trades at nearly seven times this year's sales, while Marathon trades at about six times this year's sales.\n\nI'm not bullish on either of these stocks right now, since I believe it makes more sense to simply buy Bitcoin instead of investing in these capital-intensive miners. But if I had to choose one over the other, I'd pick Marathon because it's bigger, produces more Bitcoins every day, and has a much shorter and clearer path toward profitability."

        "content": "Over the past seven days, bitcoin has surged more than 20%. That\u2019s a bull market unto itself. It\u2019s also one fueled by speculation that the SEC will soon approve ETFs with spot bitcoin exposure. That\u2019s one of the most widely anticipated events in the histories of the ETF industry and the crypto space.\n\nThe long-running speculation can affect other cryptocurrency-related assets, including bitcoin mining equities. This is the asset class largely tracked by the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) .\n\nHopes for a spot bitcoin ETF cut both ways. Speculation is just that, and there are no guarantees that the SEC will imminently approve such ETFs. Said another way, bitcoin and ETFs such as SATO could use catalysts beyond regulatory approvals. Fortunately, it appears that\u2019s happening.\n\nCrypto ETF SATO Could Be Golden\n\nSATO could benefit in two ways. Recent data indicates bitcoin\u2019s correlations to equities, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 Index (NDX), are declining. Second, the cryptocurrency\u2019s correlations to gold are increasing.\n\nThat\u2019s a positive, because over the past month, the largest gold-backed ETF is higher by 4.22%. Those tightening correlations could fortify bitcoin\u2019s status as a safe-haven assets. That\u2019s something it has long lacked, but something crypto bulls have long craved.\n\n\u201cGeopolitical risk amid new conflict in the Middle East has raised hackles among investors and seen traders flock into gold, long seen as a safe bet in times of turmoil that rock the stock market,\u201d reported Jack Denton for Barron\u2019s. \u201cWhile Bitcoin has long been dubbed \u2018digital gold\u2019 by its proponents, the largest crypto has not always performed as a haven asset, though its increasing link to gold could be a sign that this is changing, especially with respect to geopolitical risk.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s emerging status as an alternative asset is useful on multiple fronts. Not only does it make bitcoin easier to classify for novice investors, it could bolster the digital currency\u2019s status as a safe haven amid rampant inflation and geopolitical volatility.\n\n\u201cWe [view]bitcoin as an investment being a non-sovereign store of value which had potential exposure to economic and internet growth, whilst being largely uncorrelated to other asset classes,\u201d according to CoinShares. \u201cWe also find that in the context of a portfolio, it behaves in a similar manner to other alternative assets in providing diversification, with the exception that its portfolio diversification benefits are far greater than its competitors.\u201d"

That's down from 2.6 million a year ago.\n\n\"To me, that's suggestive of a potential supply shock,\" Matt Weller, global head of research at Forex.com, told CoinDesk TV on Thursday. \"Essentially, there's not too much bitcoin actively liquid in the market that's available for trade.\"\n\nBitcoin balance on exchanges and price of bitcoin CoinDesk, Glassnode\n\nThe supply crunch could set up bitcoin for another price spike. Earlier this week, bitcoin hit $35,000, the highest since May 2022, on hopes that a spot bitcoin ETF would get regulatory approval soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch an ETF would boost demand for bitcoin, further squeezing the limited supply.\n\n\"With lower supply in the market, it only takes a small bump in demand \u2014 like what we've seen with speculation around the ETF \u2014 to really drive price higher at a rapid rate,\" Weller said.\n\nContributing to the constrained supply is that millions of bitcoin are being held by original \"die hard\" crypto investors. Weller estimated that about 3 million bitcoin tokens haven't been traded in 10 years.\n\nBut if the price of bitcoin soars, that could relieve supply by nudging some investors to sell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnlike a regular currency, the supply of bitcoin was designed to be finite, capped at 21 million tokens. There are currently 19.5 million tokens in circulation."

        "content": "Bitcoin is trading at an all-time high against Nigeria\u2019s national currency, the naira.\n\nThis price climb is due to the decline of the naira. Nigeria\u2019s currency has fallen 65% compared to the US dollar in the last four months.\n\nDespite the naira\u2019s fall, crypto trading remains popular in Nigeria.\n\nBitcoin is more expensive for Nigerians today than it was two years ago, when it reached its highest price in US dollar terms.\n\nIn fact, Bitcoin is trading at a new all-time high in Africa\u2019s most populous country despite still being only halfway to its peak US dollar price of $69,000 attained in November 2021.\n\nNigeria ranks high in global crypto adoption. However, Nigeria\u2019s crypto fondness is not why bitcoin has grown so expensive in the country. Instead, the reason lies in the massive decline of the naira, or NGN, Nigeria\u2019s national currency.\n\nThe Naira has fallen against the US dollar by 65% since June. This fall resulted from the country\u2019s central bank\u2019s decision in June to allow market forces to determine foreign exchange rates \u2014 a policy known as floating.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nCrypto trading in Nigeria is priced in US dollar terms, which is then converted to the naira value at the day\u2019s exchange rate. The naira has lost so much ground to the dollar that the value of $1 has almost tripled in the country\u2019s currency market since 2021.\n\nAs such, it costs more today in naira terms to become a wholecoiner, a colloquial term for an owner of at least 1 BTC, than it did back when bitcoin hit $69,000 in US dollar terms two years ago.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s current US dollar price of about $34,000 is equivalent to 38 million Nigerian naira. BTC is even trading as high as 43 million NGN, according to the rates advertised by some sellers on the Binance peer-to-peer platform.\n\nBy comparison, it cost 29 million NGN in November 2021 to become a wholecoiner.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nPresently, that amount \u2014 29 million NGN \u2014 can only buy three-quarters of a bitcoin, showing the extent of the naira\u2019s depreciation in the last two years.\n\nCrypto still popular\n\nThe falling naira has not, however, dampened enthusiasm for bitcoin and crypto assets. Crypto trading in Nigeria has grown 9% since 2021, according to the latest global cryptocurrency adoption report published by Chainalysis, a blockchain forensics company. Chainalysis ranked the country second in its global crypto adoption index released in September.\n\nMost of the growth since 2021 has been due to sustained interest in bitcoin and stablecoins, especially Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin, the report stated.\n\nStablecoin trading via crypto exchanges in Nigeria has crossed $60 billion over the last two years. Bitcoin volume in the country is nowhere near this mark but there has been a noticeable increase in BTC trading since Nigeria\u2019s government decided to float the naira.\n\nThis flight of funds into bitcoin and stablecoins in Nigeria can be attributed to investors needing to protect the value of their capital, Kola Oyeneyin, CEO of private wealth fund Opportunik Global Fund told DL News.\n\n\u201cAny asset that offers protection in the immediate term becomes the alternative,\u201d Oyeneyin said. \u201cThat\u2019s why the value of digital assets and hard commodities are on the rise in some markets, including Nigeria.\u201d\n\nNigeria is not the only country where bitcoin is trading at a peak price in local currency terms. The same situation is happening in Turkey where the local currency, the Turkish lira, has slumped over 30% against the US dollar since April. As a result, Bitcoin is trading at 960,000 lira now in dollar terms, vs 800,000 lira back in November 2021.\n\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

        "content": "Satoshi's Vision\n\nAccording to the white paper \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\u201d published by the pseudonymous figure Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, Bitcoin was created as a response to the flaws in the traditional financial system. Nakamoto\u2019s primary motivation was establishing a decentralized digital currency that operates on a peer-to-peer network, eliminating the need for intermediaries like banks or governments. Bitcoin aims to enable secure, transparent, borderless transactions while addressing concerns related to the \u201cdouble-spending problem\u201d (where the same digital token is spent more than once).\n\nRegardless of where you stand on Bitcoin, it\u2019s tough to argue that it hasn\u2019t been a raging success and probably has blown up more than Nakamoto ever dreamed. For example, in late 2009, the first recorded exchange of Bitcoin for dollars pegged one Bitcoin\u2019s value at $0.00099. Today, that number has ballooned to ~$35,000 per coin, and if Bitcoin were a stock, it would be in the top 10 in terms of market value ($668B USD). Today, we will do our best to illustrate unbiased arguments and data for Bitcoin as a currency or store of value:\n\nArguments for Bitcoin as a Currency\n\nProponents of Bitcoin as a currency highlight its potential to revolutionize the traditional banking system. They argue that Bitcoin transactions are fast, borderless, and offer low transaction fees compared to traditional banking systems or international money transfers. Evidence is starting to mount that citizens in hyper-inflation plagues countries are using Bitcoin as an alternative currency. Did you know Bitcoin\u2019s price recently notched an all-time high versus three hyperinflation-plagued nations? (Nigeria, Turkey, Argentina) Impressive when you consider that Bitcoin is far off of its highs of $69,000 versus the US Dollar.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nPictured: Bitcoin vs. Turkish Lira\n\nSpin: Currently, it is hard to argue that Bitcoin\u2019s primary function is as a currency. However, in inflation-plagued countries like Nigeria, Turkey, and Argentina, desperate citizens are turning to Bitcoin as a way of escaping the financial prison that is rampant inflation. For countries like the United States, Bitcoin does not make sense to use as a currency as the US Dollar offers far more stability.\n\nStory continues\n\nArguments for Bitcoin as a Store of Value\n\nBitcoin advocates argue that it serves as a store of value akin to gold. Benefits of Bitcoin include its limited supply (only 21 million coins will ever exist) versus traditional currencies that can be printed in unlimited quantities, leading to inflation. Proponents also argue that Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity and the decentralized nature of blockchain technology make it a reliable store of value. Amidst geopolitical escalations, rampant global inflation, and volatility in equities, Bitcoin is up more than 100% in 2023. In the past, Bitcoin has not only survived but thrived in situations like the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and the 2020 Covid-crash. In recent months, Bitcoin and Gold (universally thought of as the main store of value) have decoupled from the equity markets and gained ground.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Miles Deutscher\n\nPictured: Bitcoin (orange) decouples from traditional assets.\n\nSpin: With the US National Debtencroaching on nearly $50 trillion (and likely to grow due to geopolitical escalations in the Middle East and Europe), it\u2019s tough to argue against an alternative that has a limited supply and has held its value since its inception in 2009. The comparison chart between gold and Bitcoin provides further evidence.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThere is much more to the Bitcoin bull move than the hype surrounding a potential ETF approval. Evidence is mounting that Bitcoin is not only a trading vehicle but is becoming a real-world currency and a store of value.\n\n\n\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Surged Higher This Week - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What a week it was for mega-cap cryptocurrencies. Three of the most popular digital assets out there, Bitcoin (BTC -2.83%), Ethereum (ETH -3.15%) and Dogecoin (DOGE 3.10%), each saw impressive gains. As of 12:45 p.m. ET on Friday, these three top-10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization rose 14.7%, 10.4% and 15.4%, respectively, over the past seven days.\n\nIt shouldn't be surprising for many investors to see Bitcoin lead the market higher, as that's par for the course for this space. With roughly half the market cap of the entire crypto sector, the direction Bitcoin moves on a given week typically determines how other digital assets perform.\n\nAccordingly, one might view this week's news that a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) could be hitting the market sooner than thought as the rising tide that's lifting all boats. I certainly think there's something to that.\n\nWith that said, let's dive into what specifically drove these three cryptos higher over the past week and where they may be headed from here.\n\nBitcoin ETF launch dominates the crypto news cycle\n\nIt's been a busy week in the world of crypto, with the Sam Bankman-Fried trial ongoing, various macro-data releases impacting monetary policy decisions released, and a flurry of token-specific news that's been enough to make the heads of many investors in the market spin. Of course, this week's Bitcoin news has dominated the headlines, and for good reason.\n\nEssentially, a number of hints that Blackrock's spot Bitcoin ETF will finally be pushed over the goal line have materialized this week, with this ETF reportedly being listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation database under the ticker IBTC.\n\nThis ticker appears to have been taken down and put back up again, but the fact that we're seeing this ticker listed is apparently enough of a catalyst for crypto bulls to point to. Many believe this could be the moment Bitcoin is officially viewed as 'open for investment' for institutional investors, much in the same way gold ETFs made investing in precious metals much simpler and more attractive for money managers.\n\nOn that note, I've been reading a number of interesting analyses on this topic, with many experts attempting to quantify what a spot Bitcoin ETF could mean for the digital currency in terms of capital inflows into Bitcoin and the broader sector as a whole. Right now, I think most of these reports require a great deal of guesswork, so I'm not sure how much credence to give these. However, I do think it's true that Bitcoin and Ethereum (assuming a spot Ethereum ETF is next, which would be 100% logical) will receive a big boost from a rush of capital into these alternative assets.\n\nOther, more speculative altcoins, such as Dogecoin, may be well positioned to ride a wave of momentum higher. Dogecoin's price action typically takes its cue from the directional forces created by Bitcoin and Ethereum in a given week.\n\nIndeed, the fact that Dogecoin has moved even higher than Bitcoin and Ethereum on broadly bullish market sentiment outlines the value this token provides traders as a higher-beta option in this space. A number of experts continue to point to \"irrational exuberance\" when discussing Dogecoin's price action over the past few days as the key driver of this token. I tend to agree.\n\nWhere are these three tokens headed from here?\n\nIt's clear that there's robust reason for Bitcoin and Ethereum to be up this week. As for the rest of the market, animal spirits appear to remain high, which is a great thing for crypto speculators banking on yet another catalyst-driven bull run over the near term.\n\nThat said, the extent to which this rally can be sustained beyond a few days remains to be seen. Once a spot Bitcoin ETF is launched (and maybe a similar Ethereum option), it's unclear whether the bullish momentum that's driven valuations higher can continue. Indeed, it could be the latest \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" event. We'll see.\n\nIt's my view that now may be a good time to take a cautious view of this space and wait for the dust to settle before stepping in. These three tokens have made nice moves over the past week, for sure. Let's just see whether these gains will be held before jumping in to ride this latest leg higher."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is due to finish 2023 as it started, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode said, as October gains near 30%.\n\nIn the latest edition of its weekly newsletter, \u201cThe Week On-Chain,\u201d released Oct. 24, researchers argued that the past week \u201csets the foundation\u201d for a BTC price uptrend.\n\nBTC price \u201cconvincingly\u201d beats out resistance levels\n\nAs it hit $35,200 this week, Bitcoin eclipsed various key trendlines, which had previously acted as support for months.\n\nThese included various moving averages (MA), among them the 200-week simple MA at $28,400 \u2014 the classic \u201cbear market\u201d support line.\n\n\u201cA cluster of long-term simple moving averages of price are located around $28k, and have provided market resistance through September and October,\u201d Glassnode noted.\n\n\u201cAfter a month of the market grinding higher, the bulls found sufficient strength this week to convincingly break through the 111-day, 200-day, and 200-week averages.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart with moving average data (screenshot). Source: Glassnode\n\nIn so doing, the profitability of various investor cohorts improved considerably. The so-called cost basis of speculators and market newcomers also lies near $28,000.\n\n\u201cThe Short-Term Holder (STH) cost basis is also now in the rear view mirror at $28k, putting the average recent investor into an average profit of +20%,\u201d \u201cThe Week On-Chain\u201d continued.\n\nResearchers uploaded a chart of the short-term holder market-value-to-realized-value (STH-MVRV) ratio, which tracks the profitability of STH coins. They noted that even prior to the October upside, no major capitulatory behavior was visible.\n\n\u201cWe can see instances in 2021-22 where STH-MVRV reached relatively deep corrections of -20% or more,\u201d they explained.\n\n\u201cWhilst the August sell-off did reach a low of -10%, it is noteworthy how shallow this MVRV decline is by comparison, suggesting the recent correction found noteworthy support, being a precursor to this week\u2019s rally.\u201d\n\nBitcoin STH-MVRV annotated chart (screenshot). Source: Glassnode\n\nBitcoin \u201csets the foundation\u201d for green year\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, the presence of STH entities versus their seasoned counterparts, the long-term holders (LTHs), is now historically low.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price model expects $45K \u2018phase\u2019 to hit in November\n\nDespite facing profitability issues of their own, LTHs now own more than three-quarters of the available BTC supply for the first time.\n\nTheir cost basis is lower, further toward $20,000 \u2014 and while some believe that Bitcoin could still return to that area, Glassnode is optimistic over how the year will end.\n\n\u201cA meaningful proportion of supply and investors now find themselves above the average break-even price, located around $28k,\u201d it concluded.\n\n\u201cThis sets the foundation for a resumption of the 2023 uptrend. At the very least, the market has crossed over several key levels where aggregate investor psychology is likely to be anchored, making the weeks that follow important to keep an eye on.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD monthly returns (screenshot). Source: CoinGlass\n\nPer data from on-chain monitoring resource CoinGlass, BTC/USD is currently up 26% this month \u2014 by October standards, still relatively modest.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Inflows could reach $27 billion in the second year and $39 billion in the third.\n\nGalaxy Digital notes that the US wealth management business, with $48.3 trillion in assets, represents a sizable market for a Bitcoin ETF. The need for such products is obvious, with rumors and reports about ETFs driving significant price increases. Given the liquidity and price impact of large investments, the introduction of spot ETFs might result in a 74% spike in bitcoin prices in the first year.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "For more than a decade, the primary narratives surrounding Bitcoin (BTC) have focused on its role as peer-to-peer digital cash and a store of value.\n\nHowever, all indications suggest that we are witnessing a significant shift in this paradigm.\n\nSince the beginning of 2023, one of the most discussed topics in the Bitcoin ecosystem has been the use of the world\u2019s leading blockchain to store information that goes beyond the previously mentioned use cases.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin fragments could become more valuable than full Bitcoins\n\nIf you have been isolated in an igloo during this crypto winter and are unaware of the developments, here is a brief overview.\n\nIn January 2023, developer Casey Rodamor introduced Ordinals to the world, a protocol that allows you to permanently inscribe any file into the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first method created for such an action, but it gained the most traction, creating a trend where nonfungible token (NFT) collections, music, video games, journalistic articles and even WikiLeaks records began to be stored in an eternal and immutable manner on the world\u2019s largest decentralized network.\n\n'Anonymous activist group is inscribing the Afghan war logs published by WikiLeaks into #Bitcoin to protest imprisonment of Julian Assange' @BitcoinMagazine #FreeAssange https://t.co/1huZ6J9SDM \u2014 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 23, 2023\n\nAs a result, experiments, innovation and the perspective of the Bitcoin network as a vast decentralized database began to simmer.\n\nDespite being less than a year old, the Ordinals protocol has been evolving remarkably to become more efficient and to enable bolder use cases.\n\nOne of the noteworthy enhancements is the technique of recursive inscriptions, which allows users to circumvent the 4-megabyte storage limit per block, enabling the insertion of larger data on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nAs an example \u2014 illustrated by the image below \u2014 I inscribed an entire article from Cointelegraph on Bitcoin using a recursive inscription.\n\nCointelegraph article inscribed on Bitcoin as Ordinal inscription #35,185,228. Source: https://www.ord.io/35185228\n\nIn total, eight inscriptions were made to achieve the final result, at a total file size of 5.22 kilobytes. (That\u2019s small.) Seven of the inscriptions were images from the article, each stored individually in a satoshi through the Ordinals protocol. The eighth inscription comprises a code that contains the article\u2019s text and issues requests to retrieve the images from the other satoshis.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin has entered a civil war \u2014 Over \u2018art\u2019\n\nThis assembly allowed for the complete article to be eternally inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain, a feat that couldn\u2019t have been achieved in a single step while maintaining quality.\n\nLeonidas, a developer within the Ordinals community, offered an even more profound perspective on the matter on Twitter, writing:\n\n\u201cWhat if lots of people upload lots of packages of code into the Bitcoin Blockchain? So now there is a huge repository of packages for developers to build on top of. This would unlock powerful use cases that could never be accommodated in under 4 MB. The most complex pieces of software are just a bunch of code compiled together after all. Now it becomes possible to put a complex 3D video game fully on-chain on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWTF are recursive inscriptions?\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know:\n\n\n\nEarlier this year the Ordinals Protocol introduced the ability for anyone to inscribe files fully on-chain onto Bitcoin. These inscriptions are self-contained and unaware of the other files that had been\u2026 pic.twitter.com/O3jt6lhaxT \u2014 Leonidas (@LeonidasNFT) June 12, 2023\n\nWith just this, a world of possibilities can be contemplated and reimagined. After all, the ability to use the world\u2019s leading blockchain as an immutable, shared, uncensored data storage is huge.\n\nBut the innovations don't stop there!\n\nIn October, Lightning Labs announced the first mainnet release of Taproot Assets (TARO), further enhancing the Bitcoin blockchain as a multiasset network.\n\nAnnouncing the first mainnet release of Taproot Assets , a protocol for assets on #bitcoin and Lightning.\n\n\n\nWith this release, developers can issue financial assets on-chain in a scalable manner.\n\n\n\nToday marks a new era of multi-asset bitcoin. https://t.co/2cNvZSvv8v \u2014 Lightning Labs\u26a1\ufe0f (@lightning) October 18, 2023\n\nThis could not have occurred at a more opportune time, given the enthusiasm ignited by the Ordinals protocol and the way it paved the path for TARO to shine alongside it.\n\nThe Ordinals Protocol has broadened the perspective of users and builders, allowing them to construct and view Bitcoin as a network of multiple assets.\n\nOrdinals assets \u2014 via flooding the network with transactions \u2014 compelled Binance to implement an integration with Lightning. This key factor \u2014 combined with low costs, decentralization and high network settlement speed \u2014 makes trading other coins and assets very attractive through Taproot Assets.\n\nAnd among the various applications of the TARO protocol, one of the most mentioned is the ability to issue stablecoins on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe shift in paradigm is monumental, as it paves the way for Bitcoin to transform from being primarily an exchangeable asset to becoming the medium through which exchanges occur.\n\nThis innovation is going to empower builders to import successful use cases from other chains and bring them back to the mothership.\n\nSome even joke that all other chains are just Bitcoin\u2019s testnets. Does it all lead back to Bitcoin?\n\nTHE BITCOIN RENAISSANCE CAN\u2019T BE STOPPED\n\n\n\nthe magicians at @lightning labs are back with an efficient protocol for tokens on top of bitcoin\n\n\n\nethereum was a testnet. get in anon we\u2019re going to the moon pic.twitter.com/2g6vPFBAbV \u2014 Udi Wertheimer (@udiWertheimer) May 16, 2023\n\nOverall, we could say that we are on the edge of a new Bitcoin era \u2014 the era of the multiasset orange network.\n\nIn addition to attracting and retaining more developers who may be interested in these new protocols, these new applications also have the potential to draw in and retain new users who initially didn\u2019t find interest or value in Bitcoin as a store of value.\n\nFor some, transforming the world can sometimes occur through the simple enjoyment of some fun, encrypted sports cards. But with the optimization of Ordinals, the number of possibilities will continue expanding.\n\nA January 1993 post authored by Hal Finney speculating on the idea of marketing digital cash as cryptographic trading cards. Source: Compuserve\n\nHal Finney, a prominent cypherpunk \u2014 and the first person to receive a transaction from Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto \u2014 wrote in a 1993 post on Compuserve: \u201cGiving a little more thought to the idea of buying and selling digital cash, I thought of a way to present it.

Some crypto market observers believe the answer could be hiding within the price action of a frog-themed memecoin.\n\nIn an Oct. 27 post on X (formerly Twitter), Onchain Capital co-founder and Crypto Banter host Ran Neuner suggested that memecoin Pepe (PEPE) is a strong indicator of overblown crypto market fever.\n\nIf you want to know when a pull back is coming, just watch $PEPE.

Around the same time Pepe reached its peak, Bitcoin had already begun sliding downward from a recently attained yearly high.\n\nNeuner\u2019s theory has been shared by other crypto traders in the past. On Sept. 23, trader Alex RTB told his 60,000 followers that he had begun using Pepe as a reliable metric for impending short-term declines.\n\nThis $PEPE pump is another indicator of upcoming #BTC dump.\n\n\n\nI am speaking with experience, you can check past price movements.\n\n\n\nPumping coins like $PEPE, $DOGE, $XRP, $IMX, $LINK always indicates the bloodbath, let's see how it goes this time. pic.twitter.com/piseCxRiqD \u2014 Alex RT\u20bf (@rutradebtc) September 22, 2023\n\nHowever, the theory also attracted its fair share of skeptics, who claim the data hasn\u2019t always supported the theory.\n\nRelated: BTC price pullback after $35K? Bitcoin funding rates turn \u2018grossly positive\u2019\n\nDubai-based trader Reetika told Cointelegraph that Pepe\u2019s recent uptick was largely driven by bullish news regarding changes in the team and the fact that it would be burning additional tokens and that it wasn\u2019t necessarily a sign of broader overconfidence in the market.\n\n6.9T $PEPE Tokens worth ~$6,000,000 have been burned. https://t.co/aN5LRUFz8u\n\n\n\nA new team of advisors have been brought on to guide Pepe forward.

Source: TradingView\n\nReetika, meanwhile, suggested looking at Solana\u2019s SOL (SOL) as a potentially more reliable predictor.\n\n\u201cSOL has been a very good leading indicator for the moves so far. It has broken out of resistances at least a day before BTC/ETH over this entire move. I\u2019ve been using it actionably for estimating upside,\u201d she said.\n\nReetika, however, clarified that SOL isn\u2019t a perfect indicator either but had performed well on the most recent move.\n\nSimilarly, market commentator and avid crypto shitposter Poordart told Cointelegraph that Pepe probably isn\u2019t the best metric from which to gauge the future price action of majors like Bitcoin.\n\nIn Poordarts\u2019 view, Pepe is still far too new to the market to have any \u201creal lasting value\u201d as a reliable metric to gauge the price movements of Bitcoin with any significant accuracy.\n\nMagazine: Beyond crypto \u2014 Zero-knowledge proofs show potential from voting to finance"

The Bitcoin halving occurs every four years, and the next halving in 2024 will reduce the BTC mining reward from the current 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. As the total supply of Bitcoin is fixed at 21 million, the halving of BTC mining rewards creates a supply-demand gap that lowers the influx of new BTC into the market.\n\nBitcoin market dominance is a measure of the crypto asset\u2019s market capitalization relative to the overall digital asset market and highlights the asset\u2019s strength.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFreshman Mexican Senator Indira Kempis made headlines last year when she introduced a bill that would create of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Now, she has her eyes set on making Bitcoin an integral part of her political agenda.\n\nKempis is a congresswoman from the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, which is situated north of Mexico City and shares a small border with Texas. After coming across Bitcoin several times \u201cand not really understanding it,\u201d she told Decrypt that she knew she had to take a closer look after learning of obstacles that entrepreneurs were facing.\n\nHaving helped the group that later became Bitso, the largest exchange in the country, Kempis began to open the conversation in the legislative branch and push forward what she considers \u201cthe road to creative alternatives.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShe set forth the aforementioned bill, which had no mention of Bitcoin or decentralized assets in its original form. It was a pragmatic approach, she said, and a first step towards establishing the necessary legal framework for the country to acknowledge\u2014and ultimately accept\u2014Bitcoin as legal tender.\n\nIn her initial bill, the country\u2019s central bank, the Banco de M\u00e9xico, would be the sole issuer of digital currency. Having felt the backlash for introducing a CBDC by the crypto community\u2013although she claims \u201cit was a necessary step to open the discussion\u201d\u2013Kempis modified the proposal to include Bitcoin.\n\nIt\u2019s been an arduous journey, she told Decrypt, pointing out that after a Bitcoin ATM was installed inside the Mexican Senate, members of the Mexican congress and their teams are beginning to ask more questions.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t much opposition to her bill initially, \u201cbecause nobody really understood Bitcoin,\u201d Kempis recalled. Now, it\u2019s getting attention, both positive and negative. But she says she doesn\u2019t get upset when she runs across detractors, because their rejection still means \u201cwe are moving the system.\u201d\n\nKempis said she would like to see a heat map of Mexico showing where legislators stand regarding the bill. \u201cI\u2019m looking for clear positions,\u201d she explained, hoping to communicate to the Mexican public whether their representatives are interested or not in this type of innovation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMexico is known for its blossoming tech scene, a pioneering fintech law industry, and a tech-savvy population. In a recent Chainalysis report, it landed below the regional average for centralized exchange use (which is more common in Latin America), suggesting that Mexicans have a wider set of crypto products available to them.\n\nThe senator also pointed out that digital wallets are now available in indigenous languages, which are spoken by 6% of the population, and that remittances have been growing of late, registering a nearly 10% jump year-on-year.\n\nThe bill is being discussed, but has a long way to go. The country\u2019s Central Bank is an integral part of the legislative process, although it claims autonomy, and the Mexican senate has requested a formal analysis and stance from the institution. It hasn\u2019t arrived yet.\n\nThe former head of the central bank was a staunch critic of Bitcoin, said Kempis, whereas his successor, the current governor Victoria Rodr\u00edguez, has remained silent in most of the discussions surrounding Bitcoin.\n\nOther politicians are not sold. Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, also known as AMLO, came out to assure that Mexico \u201cwould not\u201d adopt Bitcoin as legal tender after Nayib Bukele\u2019s El Salvador approved its pioneering Bitcoin law.\n\nThat said, the digital peso, which the financial institution is aiming for, should arrive sometime in 2024, the senator said.\n\nAnnouncing a run for the Presidency in the upcoming 2024 elections, Kempis said she plans to continue on her Bitcoin crusade.\n\nBeyond the possibility of being president, the role of the legislative branch, for Senator Kempis, is to offer \u201ca dose\u201d of education and help push the discussion along the way through well-thought-out laws and regulations. \u201cIf El Salvador could do it, surely we can as well,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the end of the day, however, Kempis does take a practical approach to the technology, telling Decrypt that it won\u2019t solve all of Mexico\u2019s problems. Despite her bullishness, she concluded, \u201cIt\u2019s not a panacea.\u201d\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

While the global cryptocurrency market cap surged 0.77% to around $1.27 trillion in the last 24 hours.Bitcoin was up 1.47% at $34,626 as of 12:30 p.m., while its largest peer, Ethereum, surged 1.4% to above the $1,800 level.The consistent gains registered by BTC have overshadowed the price action of ETH and other major altcoins. This has led to BTC dominance hitting a new 30-month high of over 54%; the highest since April 2021. However, as investors become comfortable with the risk curve during this market phase, altcoins may see an uptick in investor interest, leading to a correction in BTC dominance, said Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead at CoinSwitch Ventures.Other popular altcoins, including Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, rose over 6% each. Also, Cardano, Solana, Polygon, Polkadot, Litecoin and Toncoin surged.In the last 24 hours, the market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, surged to $675 billion. Bitcoin's dominance is currently 53.24%, according to CoinMarketCap. BTC volume in the last 24 hours declined 27.1% to $24.14 billion.\"Bitcoin\u2019s decoupling from stock indices has brought cheer to the crypto community. The asset is up 23% on a weekly basis and aims to make a fresh move towards $35,000, a key level to hold for further gains. Bitcoin\u2019s dominance is at its highest since April 2021, implying that traders are routing capital to the number one crypto asset over altcoins,\" said Vikram Subburaj, CEO at Giottus Crypto Platform.\"However, some altcoins have rallied considerably this week including Layer-1 asset Solana (SOL) and memecoin Pepe (PEPE). A minor pullback in the markets is likely in the short-term but the trend is clear as Bitcoin heads towards a Golden Cross (crossing of 50-day and 200-day moving averages) which is typically bullish,\" Subburaj added. Bitcoin price is in an uptrend with potential resistance levels at $36,507 and $38,579. If the market turns bearish, support can be found at $31,212, $29,172 and $27,956.The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is high at 78, indicating potential overbought conditions but also strong momentum. The 50-day EMA at $30,673 supports a positive short-term trend. The bullish pattern, \"Three White Soldiers\", indicates a reversal from the previous downtrend.Bitcoin is currently testing the $34,705 level, which is a crucial point. A break above it can increase buying interest. Overall, Bitcoin's trajectory appears bullish, with $34,700 a critical level to watch.(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "content": "Welcome back to Chain Reaction.\n\nTo get a roundup of TechCrunch\u2019s biggest and most important crypto stories delivered to your inbox every Thursday at 12 p.m. PT, subscribe here.\n\nIt\u2019s week four of the Sam Bankman-Fried trial\u2026and he\u2019s taking the stand today at 2 p.m. So keep an eye out for additional coverage.\n\nThis marks the second time Bankman-Fried has spoken out publicly in the courtroom after saying \u201cyes,\u201d on the first day in response to Judge Lewis Kaplan asking if he understood he had the right to testify if he wanted to.\n\nThis is the first day the defense presented their arguments after multiple weeks of prosecutors making their case with rising sheafs of evidence.\n\nThe prosecutors rested their case around 10 a.m. on Thursday. Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried\u2019s lead lawyer, requested a motion for acquittal on all seven counts against his client, calling the government\u2019s case on the charges \u201cinsufficient\u201d with \u201cmateriality not shown.\u201d Prosecutors opposed the motion and Judge Kaplan declined it.\n\nThe trial was on recess from October 20 until today. But Wednesday morning, there was a virtual hearing between Judge Lewis Kaplan, the prosecutors and defense to frame the rest of the case.\n\nDuring the call, Cohen said that the defense has three potential witnesses and added \u201cour client will be testifying.\u201d Before the defense makes their case, the prosecutors plan on bringing out one more witness, FBI agent Marc Troiano, to \u201csummarize certain documents\u201d focused on FTX and Alameda, Assistant United States Attorney Thane Rehn said.\n\nThe defense also filed a letter to Judge Kaplan on Wednesday requesting permission to ask Bankman-Fried\u2019s \u201cgood faith\u201d about certain elements of FTX and Alameda. Some of the events regarded internal and external legal counsel implementing data retention policies, like auto-deletion policies for Slack and Signal, as well as loans made from FTX and Alameda to executives, drafts of terms and services and other areas.\n\n\u201cBankman-Fried\u2019s understanding that auto-deletion policies were instituted under the guidance of lawyers would be directly relevant to rebut the inference that these policies were instituted for improper purposes,\u201d the defense letter wrote.\n\nCohen said on the virtual call he expects Bankman-Fried\u2019s testimony to be the same length as that of his former colleagues, who pleaded guilty: FTX co-founder and CTO Gary Wang, Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX head of engineering Nishad Singh. He also said that it will take a \u201cgood part of Thursday, maybe all of Thursday,\u201d with potential for Friday cross-examination.\n\nEven though the trial was on pause, details were still transpiring, and we were still putting out more content. Details below.\n\nSBF trial\n\nThis week in web3\n\nIf you\u2019re getting SBF trial fatigue, here are some articles on what else is happening in the wild world of web3.\n\nThe latest pod\n\nFor this week\u2019s episode, Jacquelyn interviewed Josh Naftalis, partner at law firm Pallas Partners.\n\nHe\u2019s a longtime attorney who represents companies, boards and executives in cases for white-collar criminal defense, regulatory enforcement matters, internal investigations, crisis management and more.\n\nPrior to Pallas Partners, Josh was a federal prosecutor and served over a decade as assistant U.S. attorney in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York. While at the SDNY he led a number of government white-collar prosecutions and trials, and was a senior member of SDNY\u2019s Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force. Josh handled situations ranging from cryptocurrency to insider trading and market manipulation to corporate and accounting fraud. His work also involved coordination with other agencies like the SEC, CFTC and FBI.\n\nWhile at the SDNY, Josh secured convictions in every federal criminal trial that he led as an assistant U.S. attorney. So we saw him as the perfect person to dive into the eye-grabbing trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, who is fighting seven charges related to money laundering and fraud. SBF\u2019s trial is also taking place at SDNY where Josh worked.\n\nWe talked about all the nitty-gritty details of SBF\u2019s trial: the prosecution\u2019s strategy, the defense\u2019s strategy, how this case compares to ones that Josh previously led and how likely it is that jurors will reach a guilty verdict.\n\nWe also talked about:\n\nHow many years SBF could face\n\nImportance of jurors\n\nBest witness testimonies so far\n\nSentencing for other FTX execs\n\nWhy he thinks SBF will testify\n\nSubscribe to Chain Reaction on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or your favorite pod platform to keep up with the latest episodes, and please leave us a review if you like what you hear!\n\nFollow the money\n\nAvalanche-focused gaming studio Neon Machine closed a $20 million Series A round Singapore-based crypto payments startup Triple A raised $10 million in a Series A round Ethereum onchain privacy startup Nocturne raised $6 million in a seed round Binance led $12 million funding round for InfinityStakeChain Web3 healthcare platform Rymedi raised $9 million in a Series A\n\nThis list was compiled with information from Messari as well as TechCrunch\u2019s own reporting.\n\nWhat else we\u2019re writing\n\nWant to branch out from the world of web3?

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Rally: Analyst Sets $45,000 Target And It\u2019s Closer Than You Think - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Bitcoin rallied above $35,000 on the back of the euphoria of the possible approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF. Although the rally seems to have cooled off, a particular crypto analyst\u2019s prediction suggests that the bulls could enjoy total dominance soon enough in what will see the flagship cryptocurrency rise to $45,000.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Incoming Phase Could See It Hit $45,000\n\nIn a post shared on their X (formerly Twitter) platform, crypto analyst CryptoCon shared his prediction on Bitcoin\u2019s future trajectory. The analyst mentioned that Bitcoin was currently at the \u201cMid-Cycle phase 4,\u201d which happens to be the period where the crypto token is heading closer to the \u201cCycle Mid-Top,\u201d which currently positions Bitcoin to rise above $45,000.\n\nCryptoCon\u2019s prediction seems to be made based on the Fibonacci trading strategy, as evident in the accompanying chart, which he shared in his post. The chart breaks down Bitcoin\u2019s historical price data into four cycles, namely: Cycle 1 (2010-2014), Cycle 2 (2015-2018), Cycle 3 (2019-2022), and Cycle 4 (2023-2026).\n\nSource: X\n\nThe Phases In These Cycles\n\nThese cycles are further divided into five phases, which CryptoCon seemed to focus more on. These phases include Phase 1 (Cycle Lows), Phase 2 (Transition from Cycle Lows), Phase 3 (First Move out of the Lows), Phase 4 (Transition to Cycle Mid-Top), and Phase 5 ( Cycle Mid-Top).\n\nCryptoCon noted that Bitcoin\u2019s price usually hits phase 5 quickly once phase 2 is over (about two months after, according to the analyst), and if that is the case once again, then $45,000 could be soon. If that doesn\u2019t happen, he foresees that Bitcoin could face resistance at the top of the transition, where it is currently priced at $36,368.\n\nAs to when all this could happen, he noted that October represents the first month after phase 2 ended. Therefore, the market could see the mid-top phase could happen as soon as November when Bitcoin will likely hit and rise above $45,000.\n\nInterestingly, CryptoCon\u2019s prediction coincides with that of the crypto platform Matrixport, which estimates that Bitcoin could hit $45,000 between November this year and April 2024. In their report, Matrixport goes on to make a bolder claim that Bitcoin could hit $125,000 by December 2024.\n\nSource: Matrixport\n\nBitcoin Halving Or Institutional Adoption?\n\nDifferent crypto analysts have continued to make predictions about Bitcoin\u2019s future trajectory even as the Bitcoin Halving draws nearer. Some of these analysts have credited the event as the catalyst that will spark the massive surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price. Others believe that the launch of a Spot Bitcoin ETF alongside institutional adoption is what will make Bitcoin hit new highs.\n\nMeanwhile, some contemplate that the market may already be priced in as to any impending approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF, as this is a classic case of \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news.\u201d If that is the case, many predict that we could see a decline when the ETFs launch due to massive sell-offs from traders and investors looking to realize their gains.\n\nBTC maintains above $34,000 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Photo: Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto/Getty (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nBitcoin has sustained its rally well into a second week, and is nearing the $35,000 mark. The rally has lifted tokens at the top of the memecoin market cap, such as dogecoin, shiba inu, and the uniquely-named harry potter obama sonic 10 inu (HPOS10I).\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) has risen by about 22% in the past week, now changing hands at $34,655, (\u00a328,675) according to CoinGecko data.\n\nRead more: Crypto live prices\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market cap has risen by 3% in the past 24 hours to reach $1.32tn, traders appear to be adjusting their strategies to make riskier bets on memecoins.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, top memecoins such as dogecoin (DOGE-USD), shiba inu (SHIB-USD), and HPOS10I (BITCOIN-USD) have all rallied, up 10%, 11%, and 16% respectively. HPOS10I has made the most impressive gains if we zoom out to the week-long scale, with a rally of 114% in the past seven days.\n\nThe logo of the HPOS10I memecoin, which is represented by the BITCOIN ticker, was recently featured on an F1 car. This is an example of the growing enthusiasm among memecoin communities that strongly support these tokens.\n\nThe memecoin sector of the cryptocurrency space has been swept into rising action by the steady march of bitcoin over the last two weeks. Traders anticipate the world's largest digital asset by market capitalisation will soon have its own spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF is a financial product that investors hope will open the gateway for mainstream capital to flood the crypto market.\n\nWhy does the crypto sector need a spot bitcoin ETF?\n\nSeveral key factors highlight the importance of a spot bitcoin ETF and its potential impact on the cryptocurrency market:\n\nRegulatory Oversight: An ETF would be under US regulatory jurisdiction, lending it credibility. Retail Accessibility: ETFs are more accessible to the general public, opening the door to more widespread bitcoin investment. Investor Protection: The US Securities Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) role in ensuring that the financial product meets rigorous standards would enhance the appeal of an ETF. Institutional Adoption: With the potential for significant investments from pension and mutual funds, an approved spot bitcoin ETF could funnel billions into the crypto market.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to a report, the approval of a bitcoin spot ETF may generate $600bn in new demand for the digital asset. According to Cointelegraph, CryptoQuant analysts believe that an ETF approval will lead to a $1tn increase in bitcoin\u2019s market capitalisation. The current market capitalisation of bitcoin is $675bn, according to CoinGecko.\n\nWatch: Google is 'democratising AI' for non-expert business app creation | The Crypto Mile\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

        "content": "Leading economists and financial experts predict that Bitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, will experience substantial price growth by 2025.\n\nRespondents expect Bitcoin\u2019s price to surge to an average price of more than $87,000 by 2025 and $220,000 by 2030, according to a report published on October 25 by Frank Corva for Finder.\n\nInterestingly, these prices are lower than the ones that resulted from a similar report in July, of around $100,000 and $289,000, respectively.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price predictions for year-end 2023, 2025 and 2030. Source: Finder\n\nNotably, the interviewed finance experts forecast BTC at $30,463 by the end of 2023, which would result in losses of 11% from current prices at $34,260 on October 26.\n\nThe bullish outlook is driven by factors such as wider institutional adoption, technological advancements, and a growing understanding and recognition of digital assets in the traditional financial sector. Experts cite Bitcoin\u2019s increasing mainstream integration and advancing network technology for their positive forecasts, contributing to its wide adoption and greater market stability.\n\nBitcoin price predictions for 2023\n\nAmong the panel of financial specialists, 14 out of 30 believe the lowest price Bitcoin can reach by the end of 2023 is between $22,500 and $25,000, while 9 out of 30 believe BTC could trade as low as $17,500 until the year-end.\n\nOn the other hand, 13 out of 30 respondents don\u2019t believe Bitcoin will be trading above the $30,000 mark as its highest price, while 7 out of 30 see the leading cryptocurrency breaking out and holding from the $35,000 psychological resistance for the rest of this year.\n\nNevertheless, almost half of the financial experts believe Bitcoin is either trading at a discount (47%) or at its fair value (43%), while only 10% think BTC might be overpriced at the time of publication.\n\n\u201cIs Bitcoin (BTC) overpriced, priced fairly, or underpriced?\u201d. Source: Finder\n\nDespite these differing views, the data suggests that the majority of experts are bullish on Bitcoin\u2019s longer-term growth. According to Finder\u2019s study, over three-quarters of respondents believe it is now time to buy Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, this optimism doesn\u2019t diminish the ongoing concerns around Bitcoin\u2019s structural weaknesses and macroeconomic challenges. Volatility, regulatory uncertainty, economic recessions, and underlying technological issues like scalability are acknowledged barriers that can hamper Bitcoin\u2019s growth trajectory.\n\n\u201cWe live in highly unpredictable geopolitical and economic conditions where a recession is still a material risk, forecasting in the current macroeconomic landscape is a challenge, and anyone who pretends otherwise is likely hopelessly overconfident.\u201d \u2014 Pav Hundal, lead market analyst at Swyftx\n\nBitcoin price predictions for 2025\n\nThe study underlines that Bitcoin\u2019s future potential is substantial, and the experts are mostly looking toward two relevant events: A spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the SEC and Bitcoin\u2019s block subsidy halving by April 2024. Both events could bring higher prices for BTC, according to Finder\u2019s respondents.\n\nHowever, not all panelists were as bullish on the halving:\n\n\u201cThe effects of Bitcoin\u2019s halvings on the price have gotten weaker over time for two reasons. One is that the supply of new Bitcoins to the market is getting smaller over time in comparison to the existing supply of Bitcoins, causing the influence of mining on the price to weaken. The other reason is that, when the market cap [of Bitcoin] reaches trillions of dollars, it\u2019s a significant fraction of the size of the world economy, limiting the room for further growth.\u201d \u2014 Ruadhan O, creator of Seasonal Tokens\n\nInterestingly, 4 out of 5 analysts believe the spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved by the end of 2024. Additionally, 60% agree that this event would make BTC price increase by 2025, while 47% are highly optimistic, foreseeing the leading cryptocurrency to break its current all-time high sooner than by the end of 2025 if this happens.\n\nIn conclusion, while the majority of experts believe in Bitcoin\u2019s price escalation towards 2025, the cryptocurrency\u2019s inherent volatility must be remembered. As with all investments, potential investors are advised to do their research and exercise caution.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto took a breather on Friday ahead of the non-event weekend. However, the pause in the digital asset market was on the cards after a sizable rally in the last few days. However, analysts see the buying interest to remain in the digital asset market in the next few days.\n\n\n\nBitcoin saw some profit booking as the largest crypto token declined over a per cent but somehow managed to hold about 34,000-levels. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, was also seen in red, marginally lower, and remained below $1,800-level. Majority of the altcoins were trading with cuts.\n\n\n\nThe crypto market seems to be cooling off from its seven-day streak of rally. The crypto fear and greed index is also well within the greed zone with a score of 70/100, signalling bullish sentiments among crypto investors. The broader crypto market has reacted in sync and seems to be cooling off after the rally, said Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead at CoinSwitch Ventures.\n\n\n\n\"In other news, Deutsche Bank and Standard Chartered's SC Ventures are testing UDPN, a system that enables blockchain, stablecoins, and CBDCs to interact like SWIFT in traditional banking. UDPN bridges blockchains, incorporates digital identity standards and facilitates regulated transactions,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring a few exceptions, the majority of top crypto tokens were trading lower on Friday. Polkadot tumbled over 3 per cent, while Toncoin, Polygon, and Chainlink were down 2 per cent each. Among the gainers, Solana and BNB added about a per cent each, while Dogecoin was marginally up.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly lower, falling down to $1.26 trillion-mark, as it declined more than a per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes dropped about 7 per cent to $46.88 billion.\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nEthereum (ETH) is currently attempting a rebound after failing to breach the $1,900 resistance yesterday. The asset is witnessing ascending momentum in mid-term due to positive sentiments across the wider market. It may continue to consolidate at $1,800 levels in the short term before testing the upper boundary.\n\n\n\nImage: Chart-ETH\n\n\n\nETH is currently trading well above its 100-day moving average of $1,700 which acts as an immediate support level. Its RSI reading is at 71, cruising in overbought territory. If ETH successfully breaks and holds through the $1,835 barrier, it may retest the $1,900 levels. This may depend on Bitcoin continuing to do well.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $1,700, $1,650\n\nResistance: $1,835, $1,900\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Surge: Matrixport Forecasts $125,000 Price Target By December 2024 - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Bitcoin price (BTC) is currently displaying a significant uptrend, showing no signs of slowing down. The cryptocurrency has already begun its fifth bull run, with impressive price targets anticipated in the coming year.\n\nA recent report from Matrixport highlights BTC\u2019s history of four distinct bull market cycles, each driven by a unique narrative. However, the latest bull market, which started on June 22, 2023, stands out due to its primary driving force: institutional adoption.\n\nPer the report, this surge in institutional interest can be attributed to Bitcoin\u2019s characteristics, traditionally associated with safe-haven investments like Gold, as well as mounting concerns over the United States debt-to-GDP ratio. Matrixport\u2019s report predicts that Bitcoin\u2019s price could reach an impressive $125,000 by December 2024.\n\nBitcoin Price Rise Aligns With Mounting US Debt\n\nMatrixport suggests its emergence as a new payment mechanism propelled the first Bitcoin bull market in 2011. The second cycle was driven by China, where Bitcoin gained recognition as an alternative form of money.\n\nThe rise of initial coin offerings (ICOs) marked the third cycle, providing a novel means of establishing and funding companies. The fourth cycle saw the decentralized finance (DeFi) summer and the NFT craze dominating the market.\n\nHowever, per the report, Bitcoin\u2019s current bull market is driven by institutional adoption. Institutions are considering Bitcoin for diversifying their asset allocation due to its characteristics akin to safe-haven investments.\n\nNotably, the surge in Bitcoin\u2019s value coincides with the United States\u2019 escalating debt-to-GDP ratio, making it an attractive choice for institutions seeking to hedge against potential economic instability.\n\nBased on historical price signals, Matrixport estimated that Bitcoin price could reach $125,000 by December 2024.\n\nInterestingly, the report suggests that the onset of this bull market was officially recognized when BTC reached a new one-year high on June 22, 2023.\n\nFurthermore, Matrixport advises that the optimal entry point to buy Bitcoin is ideally 14-16 months before the next halving event. The report suggested that the end of October 2022 was an opportune time to enter the market when Bitcoin traded at $17,000.\n\nPotential BTC Correction On The Horizon?\n\nDespite the hype surrounding the current uptrend experienced by most cryptocurrencies on the market, crypto analyst \u201cCrypto Soulz\u201d presents a contrasting view on the future of Bitcoin price.\n\nIn a recent analysis of X (formerly Twitter), the analyst provides several reasons for considering a short position on BTC. According to Crypto Soulz, the next significant resistance level is at $37,330, but Soulz doubts the possibility of retesting it in the current market conditions.\n\nBitcoin recently reached a local top at $35,300, leading Crypto Soulz to believe a price decline may follow. The analyst emphasizes retesting the $31,500 level as crucial support, which Bitcoin did not revisit during the recent price surge.\n\nCrypto Soulz notes that spot and perpetual contracts rose during the pump, indicating potential market instability. Additionally, the futures market experienced significant liquidations during the rally, similar to previous wipe-outs in January and August.\n\nUpon examining the liquidation heatmap, Crypto Soulz identifies liquidity below the current price, implying a potential downward movement. Soulz targets specific liquidity pools at $32,300 and $30,800 as potential areas for the price decline.\n\nBased on its analysis, Crypto Soulz expects Bitcoin to \u201ccool off\u201d from its current levels and target lower prices.\n\nAt the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin is currently at $34,000, experiencing a 2.5% retracement in the past 24 hours.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin has surged 14 per cent in the last seven days amid optimism around Bitcoin Exchange-Traded-Fund (ETF). On Tuesday, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap had touched its highest level since May 2022. On Friday, it was trading at $34,134, down from a peak of nearly $35,000, data from CoinMarketCap showed.\n\n\"The ETF anticipation is driving FOMO among investors who are flocking to Bitcoin as its market dominance grows to 2021 levels,\" said Rajagopal Menon, vice president at WazirX. Bitcoin's dominance was 53 per cent on Friday.\n\nSeveral investment firms, including BlackRock and Fidelity Investments, have pending applications for bitcoin ETFs in the US, and speculation on their likely approval was fuelled by BlacRock's iShares ETF listing on the website.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF is expected to make buying and selling Bitcoin easier through the stock market.\n\nA US federal appeals court on Monday also formalised a victory for Grayscale Investments LLC in its bid to create a spot Bitcoin ETF over objections from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. This led to market optimism.\n\n\"Remarkably, crypto as an asset class has been decoupling from other 'risk on' assets like equities, which corrected sharply due to the rising macro and geo-political instability,\" added Parth Chaturvedi, investments lead at CoinSwitch Venture.\n\nOn Friday, the market saw a sell-off but it was majorly due to profit booking. \"The crypto market is showing signs of cooling off after the mega rally in the past few days,\" said Shivam Thukral, chief executive officer (CEO) of BuyUcoin.\n\nWhat to expect?\n\n\"Bitcoin is moving up by taking support from the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA-D). However, it's still facing a challenge at the $35,000 level. If it successfully breaks through, it could reach the $39,000 to $40,000 range, with potential support around $31,000 to $32,000. For Ethereum, the $1,740 level may act as a support, and crossing $1,860 could push it toward $2,000,\" the crypto exchange CoinDCX research team said."

        "content": "In brief The Trezor Safe 3 is the latest hardware wallet from Trezor.\n\nIt's aimed at \u201cnew entrants\u201d to the crypto space.\n\nIt's the first Trezor hardware wallet to feature a secure element.\n\nYour Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA long-established name in the crypto space, Trezor's line of hardware wallets has provided users with a reliable, if unshowy, means of self-custodying their Bitcoin and other crypto assets.\n\nNow it's branching out, with the Trezor Safe 3\u2014a hardware wallet that's explicitly courting newcomers with its slick design language and user-friendly UX.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWill it be enough to win the wallet wars?\n\nWhat is the Trezor Safe 3?\n\nThe latest addition to the firm\u2019s line of cryptocurrency hardware wallets, the Trezor Safe 3 is aimed at \u201cnew entrants\u201d to the crypto space, according to its CEO Mat\u011bj \u017d\u00e1k.\n\nThe idea is to provide a simple, secure solution for crypto holders to self-custody their assets\u2014taking their crypto out of the hands of centralized exchanges, which have proved vulnerable to both hacks and alleged corporate malfeasance, putting user funds at risk.\n\nJust 2% of the world\u2019s 420 million crypto users self-custody, \u017d\u00e1k told Decrypt, so there\u2019s definitely an opportunity\u2014but is this latest iteration of Trezor\u2019s hardware wallet enough to win them over?\n\nTrezor Safe 3: Design and Build\n\nThe Trezor Safe 3 comes in four colors. Image: Decrypt\n\nThe first wave of crypto hardware wallets were clunky, functional affairs, designed for die-hard early adopters who were prepared to overlook aesthetics and streamlined UX for the benefits of self-custody.\n\nTo broaden their appeal, wallet manufacturers like Trezor have taken design cues from mainstream consumer electronics (rival Ledger even enlisted the designer of Apple\u2019s iPod for its forthcoming Stax device).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile the Trezor Safe 3 follows the design cues of its stablemates, with a familiar shield-shaped design, screen, and button layout, the materials have had an upgrade.\n\nThe device sports a brushed aluminum back with the company's logo, in a variety of colorways that hark back to smartphones: silver, gold, rose gold, and \u201ccosmos black.\u201d\n\nThat aluminum finish isn\u2019t quite as polished as the smartphones it mimics, though.\n\nThe review units sent to Decrypt were cut slightly roughly around the edges where they meet the plastic surround. The surround itself had a somewhat rough finish, too; all six of the supplied review units had what seemed to be flash marks or glue overspills that were noticeable when running a finger around the edge of the unit.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame, as it lets down the premium consumer electronics feel that the company\u2019s aiming for (Trezor has since clarified that the review units supplied to Decrypt were pre-production models, and that the finish on the final production models should be smoother).\n\nTrezor Safe 3 and Ledger Nano S Plus. Image: Decrypt\n\nAt 14g, it\u2019s slightly less hefty in the hand than its nearest rival, the 21g Ledger Nano S Plus. The buttons have a satisfyingly clicky feel, too; more emphatic than those of the Ledger, while their placement next to each other means that you can depress both buttons with a single thumb click.\n\nThe Safe 3\u2019s display is a simple monochrome affair, unlike the whizzy touchscreen on Trezor\u2019s top-of-the-line Model T wallet. At 128 x 64 pixels, its screen resolution is identical to Ledger\u2019s rival wallet\u2014though slightly dimmer, when seen side by side.\n\nWithin Trezor Suite there\u2019s an option to set a background wallpaper, though on the device\u2019s tiny screen, the graphics aren\u2019t much to look at.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrezor Safe 3: What\u2019s in the box?\n\nBuilding on its consumer-friendly credentials, the Trezor Safe 3 comes packaged in a minimalist box in eco-friendly recycled packaging.\n\nTear off the shrink wrap and cardboard seal (the first line of crypto security) and a flap opens to reveal the contents: the Safe 3 itself, a USB-C cable, and a cardboard sleeve containing a quick start guide, two sheets for recording your recovery seed, and a collection of stickers if you want to advertise your crypto holdings to all and sundry.\n\nTrezor Safe 3 box contents. Image: Decrypt\n\nThe device itself sports a tamper-proof holographic security seal, to indicate that the device hasn\u2019t been handled since it went into the box in the Trezor factory.\n\nThe overall impression is one of a quality mass-market consumer electronics device, akin to something from Samsung or Amazon.\n\nTrezor Safe 3: Getting started\n\nFirst things first, you\u2019ll need to remove that holographic seal to reveal the Safe 3\u2019s USB-C port. Next, you\u2019ll need to plug it into your PC or Mac with the supplied USB-C cable (which, as ever, is too short\u2014designed with laptop users in mind, rather than your reviewer\u2019s desktop PC).\n\nTrezor Suite. Image: Trezor\n\nUpon plugging the Safe 3 in, you\u2019re immediately greeted with an in-browser popup telling you to \u201cgo to trezor.io to connect\u201d\u2014a nice touch. Upon heading to https://trezor.io/start, you\u2019re prompted to download the Trezor Suite management software to set up the device.\n\nUpon installing Trezor Suite, you\u2019ll be invited to update the Safe 3\u2019s firmware, before a check is performed to determine whether you have a legitimate Trezor device. A short tutorial follows to educate you on how the Trezor\u2019s two-button user interface works.\n\nNext up, you\u2019ll create a new wallet (or backup from a recovery seed)\u2014you have the choice of a standard 12-word wallet or a more complex, but secure, Shamir backup, which creates several lists of words that have to be combined to recover the wallet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCuriously, upon creating a new wallet you\u2019re given the option of skipping the backup phase entirely.\n\nWhile using your wallet without creating a backup will cause Trezor Suite to light up like a Christmas tree with warning messages, it\u2019s curious that the option is even there; Ledger\u2019s setup process forces you to check words from your seed phrase in order to proceed.\n\nTrezor Suite. Image: Trezor\n\nAssuming sense and reason haven\u2019t deserted you, the next thing you\u2019ll do is create your backup. This involves taking note of your 12-word seed phrase on your Safe 3, and then checking a selection of words off to ensure you\u2019ve recorded it correctly. Trezor Suite helpfully warns you not to take a photo of your backup, create a digital copy of it, or share it with anyone.\n\nNext up, you\u2019ll activate a selection of coins to show in Trezor Suite, before proceeding to the app proper.\n\nTrezor Safe 3: Trezor Suite\n\nTrezor Suite, a desktop app for Windows and Mac, is where the majority of the action happens; you\u2019ll need to connect your Trezor with the supplied USB-C cable to access your holdings.\n\nTrezor Suite. Image: Trezor\n\nThe app is slickly designed, and intuitive. Once you\u2019ve connected and unlocked your Safe 3, a dashboard shows your portfolio, supported assets, and a checklist of security features, including whether you\u2019ve created a backup, PIN, and passphrase. A \u201cDiscreet mode\u201d blurs balances and transactions from prying eyes, revealing them only on mouseover.\n\nYou can buy Bitcoin, Ethereum and other assets directly from the dashboard, with Trezor serving up a list of offers from different providers, listing fees, payment method and exactly how many sats you\u2019ll be stacking with each option.\n\nAn accounts tab shows your crypto accounts in more detail; it\u2019s here that you\u2019ll send and receive crypto.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nClick \u201csend\u201d and a window pops up with address and amount details, which you\u2019ll need to cross-reference on the Trezor device before signing the transaction. To receive crypto, you\u2019ll reveal your wallet address and a QR code\u2014which, again, you\u2019ll check against that displayed on your Trezor device.\n\nTrezor Suite's \"discreet mode\" blurs balances and transactions. Image: Trezor\n\nA Trade button takes you to a screen where you can buy, sell, or swap your crypto\u2014or even spend it using Bitrefill, which lets you purchase a selection of gift cards and phone refills.\n\nThere\u2019s also an associated mobile app, Trezor Suite Lite, which lets you view account balances and receive crypto, after you\u2019ve scanned your public key or received the address QR code in the main app.\n\nWallet features and assets\n\nOne of Trezor\u2019s key USPs is the additional privacy features baked into Trezor Suite. The app includes native support for Tor, which relays your connection through a network of distributed servers for greater anonymity.\n\nTrezor Suite also supports Coinjoin for Bitcoin transactions. The privacy-enhancing technique enables multiple users to pool their Bitcoin inputs into a single transaction, and receive the same amount of Bitcoin output but with a different address.\n\nThe end result is that it\u2019s more difficult to trace individual transactions back to their original sources, adding a much-needed layer of privacy to Bitcoin transactions.\n\nThe Trezor Safe 3 supports several hundred crypto assets, including Bitcoin, XRP, BNB, Litecoin, and Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens.\n\nThere are one or two omissions, though; if you want to interact with Cosmos tokens, for instance, you\u2019ll have to look elsewhere.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA limited-edition Bitcoin-only Trezor Safe 3 is available. Image: Decrypt\n\nA \u201cBitcoin-only\u201d limited edition Trezor Safe 3 is also available, with variant packaging and a unique Bitcoin Orange finish (though technically speaking it\u2019s possible to make any Safe 3 \u201cBitcoin-only\u201d by changing the firmware in Trezor Suite).\n\nAs well as Trezor Suite, the Trezor Safe 3 can also be used with third-party software wallets including MetaMask, MyEtherWallet, MyCrypto, and Ronin.\n\nWallet security\n\nUnlike other Trezor hardware wallets, the Safe 3 includes a secure element, an isolated chip that stores a secret that can decrypt the device\u2019s recovery seed. The Safe 3\u2019s secure element is CC EAL 6+ certified, compared to the EAL 5+ certification found on its nearest rival, the Ledger Nano S Plus.\n\nIncorporating a secure element is a big change for Trezor, which has previously relied entirely on open-source hardware (unlike rival hardware wallet manufacturers), and the company is at pains to stress that the secure element doesn\u2019t have access to your PIN or recovery seed itself.\n\nThe complete Trezor Safe 3 lineup. Image: Decrypt\n\nFurthermore, Trezor notes that its code remains open source, enabling the community of users to verify the integrity of its code and stress test it. And, it states, it has sourced its secure element chips from a producer that doesn\u2019t prevent it from disclosing potential vulnerabilities.\n\nUpon first launching Trezor Suite, the software performs an integrity check on your Safe 3, to verify that it\u2019s genuine Trezor hardware, while a \u201csafety check\u201d feature (which can be disabled) prevents the device from performing non-standard transactions, such as mismatching keys or enabling extreme fees.\n\nOne oddity, as mentioned above, is that the Trezor will let you set up and use the device without recording your backup recovery phrase. Although it flashes up warning messages until you record and verify your backup, in a device aimed at crypto newcomers it feels like this step should be mandatory, not an option.\n\nTrezor Safe 3: Verdict\n\nThe Trezor Safe 3 is a slick, well-designed piece of kit that almost (but not quite) matches the design and build standards of consumer electronics hardware like smartphones and tablets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWith an interface that\u2019s about as user-friendly as hardware wallets can get, it\u2019s a cost-effective way to self-custody for crypto newcomers and veterans alike\u2014although it doesn\u2019t offer access to quite as many tokens as its nearest rival, the Ledger Nano S Plus.\n\nCompared to the Ledger, the Safe 3\u2019s higher level of security certification, as well as its additional privacy features, make for a compelling case\u2014though security purists may prefer to eschew the single point of failure that a secure element represents, and take their chances with the Model T and Model One\u2019s entirely open source hardware.\n\nEdited by Liam J. Kelly."

        "content": "Bitcoin Up Review 2023: Is it Legit, or a Scam? Please note that we are not authorised to provide any investment advice. The content on this page is for information purposes only.\n\nBitcoin Up is a trading robot that is designed to execute automatic transactions in the cryptocurrency markets. According to its official website, the platform has been in operation for the past five years; however, no information about the platform\u2019s founders or the team can be discovered on the platform\u2019s website.\n\nBitcoin Up\u2019s trading platform says that the success rate of bitcoin trading is 99.4%, which is just a sweeping statement, particularly in a volatile market like cryptocurrency. In this Bitcoin Up Review, we will look into the claims made by the platform and determine how trustworthy this robot is when it comes to cryptocurrency trading.\n\nCryptocurrency trading has over time proven to be an effective way to make money either actively or passively. To make money from trading cryptocurrency requires timing, precision, and dedication because of the volatility of the market. This has discouraged a lot of people from it but technological advancement has provided a solution to trade easily and make a profit without too much effort from the user. The solution is a trading robot or as it is also called a bitcoin robot.\n\nBitcoin Up at a Glance\n\nType Bitcoin Robot Minimum Deposit $250 Withdrawal Duration 48 Hours Mobile App No Win Rate 99.4% Supported Cryptocurrencies BTC, ETH, LTE\n\nBitcoin Up Review: What is Bitcoin Up?\n\nBitcoin Up is a trading robot that leverages advanced algorithms to gather market data and conduct market analysis for profit generation. This software produces signals that users can utilize for making trades in the Bitcoin trading market. It examines market conditions, trends, historical data, and patterns to identify the most opportune moments for entering or exiting trades. The robot asserts that it can use this comprehensive information to execute trades with a high success rate.\n\nAside from automated trading, the Bitcoin Up app also makes manual trading for trading experts more convenient. On the trading interface, traders can enter their parameters, such as the asset to trade, the stop loss, the limits, and the price at which to purchase or sell, among other things. The deal is executed by the robot as soon as the trading requirements are satisfied.\n\nBitcoin Up: Legit or a Scam?\n\nThere are several strong indicators that Bitcoin Up is a reputable site to invest in. Because it is linked with some of the world\u2019s leading licensed brokers, you can trade in demo mode using real market circumstances and virtual money before investing real money. This helps you to become familiar with the platform and the markets before risking your own money on a live trade.\n\nEven if Bitcoin Up provides services that have been beneficial to traders, not everything they state about their platform should be taken at face value. It is improbable that the comments and testimonials of people who claim to be making $1200 in profits per day without any prior knowledge are accurate. A 99.4% accuracy claim has been made for the platform. This is not true because the bitcoin market is extremely volatile, and no robot could achieve such efficiency.\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Up Work?\n\nBitcoin up works with an automated trading robot that uses algorithmic tools with technologies like AI to analyze data and place trades based on the signals gotten. The robot after analyzing and has gotten optimum trades in the market sends the signals through an API to the partnered brokers that the platform uses. The platform partners with various brokers across various jurisdictions and execute the trades. The use of API allows the robot to send signals to the broker\u2019s platform. All these processes are completed and trade placed automatically with the user intervention.\n\nBitcoin Up Features\n\nPayouts\n\nThe program is said to function nonstop around the clock, and its signals appear to be accurate, according to reports. In our opinion, software that makes use of artificial intelligence (AI) and other technologies, such as natural language processing (NLP), has the potential to offer users reliable signals. However, whether Bitcoin Up can create $1,200 each day as they claim would rely on a variety of factors, including the size of the stake, the experience of the user, and the current state of the market, among others.\n\nVerification System\n\nNew users must register for accounts on Bitcoin Up by providing basic information such as their complete name and cell phone number, among other things. Furthermore, new users are required to submit a valid email address, which will be used by the team to verify their identification. After clicking the \u201cRegister Now\u201d button, a representative from the Bitcoin Up team will call you immediately to confirm your registration. During the phone conversation, the representative will check on the status of the new user and answer any questions that may have arisen.\n\nWithdrawal\n\nBitcoin Up accepts transactions made with MasterCard and VISA debit/credit cards, as well as bank transfers, for its services. The withdrawal process is only two clicks away from being completed, however, the time it takes for funds to appear in one\u2019s account varies depending on the payment provider that has been chosen. In general, the withdrawal procedure is simple and uncomplicated.\n\nFees\n\nBitcoin Up is a completely free piece of software. Interested users only need to establish a free account, and then everything is up and running! In addition, there are no fees or commissions charged on victories through the site, which is a huge plus. Suppose you earn $1,000 and request a withdrawal, you will be paid the entire amount.\n\nCustomer Support\n\nWhen it comes to reaching out to users, Bitcoin Up is lightning fast. A representative contacts you immediately after you register for an account to inquire about any problems you are having and to give support. Customers can also contact customer support by email if they choose. Following our analysis, we discovered that messages got feedback within five minutes at the most. When you consider that the customer service department deals with thousands of inquiries in a single day, this is a quick and dependable service.\n\nAffiliated Brokers\n\nOnce the account is activated, Bitcoin Up connects new users with brokers who are linked with the company. Typically, the recommended broker is the one who is closest to you \u2013 which is why it is critical to include your location in the registration form. New users are referred to a broker, and you should take the time to verify that they are in compliance with regulatory requirements.\n\nHow to Create a Bitcoin Up Account\n\nStep 1: Registration\n\nTo start using the app, you must first register on the Bitcoin Up platform. To register, you have to fill the registration form on the home page. The required information includes your name, email address, and contact number. After completing the sign-up procedure (which is simple and free), you will be required to verify your account. Following that, Bitcoin Up links you with a broker who is authorized to operate in your jurisdiction. As a result of regulatory regulations, reputable brokers will require identification verification, which means you will be required to upload a scanned copy of your approved government-issued ID as well as evidence of residency. Always keep in mind that if you fail to provide proof of your identity, you will be unable to withdraw your money.\n\nStep 2: Make a deposit\n\nAfter that, make a deposit of $250 or more in order to begin trading with the Bitcoin Up app. It should be noted that all deposits are made through the broker\u2019s platform. Cryptocurrency exchanges that are regulated have joined with Bitcoin Up to provide a safe and secure trading environment for their customers. In order to protect their clients\u2019 cash, some brokers have put in place safeguards such as segregated client accounts and insurance. Users can also fund their trading accounts using a variety of methods, including debit/credit cards, wire transfers, e-wallets such as Skrill and Neteller, and cryptocurrency wallets.\n\nStep 3: Try Demo\n\nHowever, while this step is not required, it is recommended and an alternative for traders who wish to test their trading techniques and have a better understanding of how the Bitcoin Up app works before proceeding. The demo account allows you to experiment with the software and get a better understanding of how it works by spending fictitious money. As a result, you will have a better understanding of what to expect when trading in real-time.\n\nIn addition, your broker will provide you with a plethora of training resources, like video lessons, live webinars, and guides, to assist you in becoming familiar with the platform.\n\nStep 4: Trade for Real\n\nThis is the point at which you can begin trading Bitcoin for real money in order to make real money. Before beginning a live trading session, the trader adjusts the trading and risk parameters in the software, which takes a few minutes. The trader also has the option of trading manually or allowing the software to trade on his or her behalf automatically. After that, the Bitcoin Up program will take over and begin conducting market analysis, producing signals, and executing bitcoin trades on behalf of customers. Because Bitcoin Up is fully automated, it requires little to no human involvement and produces excellent results for traders. It is possible to tailor the program to trade based on your preferences, such as which assets to trade, how much money to invest, what level of risk you want to take on, and so on.\n\nBitcoin Up Features \u2013 Why Choose this Bitcoin Robot?\n\nEasy to Use: This software is said to be quite simple to use, with testimonials from beginners with little expertise stating that they had no difficulties at all.\n\nHigh Profitability: Bitcoin Up says that users can earn up to $1,200 in daily returns if they use their service. Even though we were unable to verify this, we believe that the cost is a little inflated, especially for a well-designed piece of software.\n\nSpeed and Accuracy: Algorithms become faster and more accurate as a result of advances in artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP). The algorithms collect massive volumes of data and analyze it in a matter of seconds. A human dealer, no matter how experienced, will never be able to accomplish such a feat.\n\nRegulated Brokers: Bitcoin Up exposes new users to relevant partner brokers according to their location. Several of Bitcoin Up\u2019s connected brokers have the appropriate and essential licenses. Users will no longer have to be concerned about swindlers who may steal their money and hide it in the shadows thanks to these safeguards.\n\nSecurity: Top cybersecurity vendors such as McAfee and BitGo are tapped to supply services for the program. This means that user data is protected and that transactions are protected from prying eyes during the transaction process. Bitcoin Up guarantees to respect user data, which is stated as one of its policies in the platform\u2019s Terms and Conditions page.\n\nUser Testimonials: Trustpilot reviews for Bitcoin Up are overwhelmingly positive, with 85% of all Bitcoin Up reviews being positive. The vast majority of them are testimonials to Bitcoin Up\u2019s professionalism, particularly when it comes to assisting consumers in navigating the website.\n\nPros Cons Easy to use interface Brokers are chosen automatically Automated Trading Misleading promotion Regulated brokers No mobile app Safe and secure platform Responsive Customer Support\n\nWhich Countries is Bitcoin Up In?\n\nUnited States: Traders based in the US are also eligible to use the services provided by this robot. Bitcoin Up is a user-friendly platform for all cryptocurrency traders in the United States.\n\nUnited Kingdom: Bitcoin Up is a cryptocurrency that is available in the United Kingdom.

Cryptocurrency trading, however, is not almost as profitable without experience or prior expertise. Under no circumstances can this be applied to everyone. Before calculating how much a user may achieve in one day, several criteria have to be considered. Profit depends on the number of investments made, current market conditions, trade platform experience and the criteria of cryptocurrency and risk. We cannot thus promise a certain rate of return.\n\nWhen should I use Bitcoin Robots?\n\nAccuracy: As a very volatile cryptocurrency market, traders have to be accurate in their techniques to succeed. As traders have to enter and leave the market at a suitable time, these bots carry out the essential analyzes and enter or leave a trade at the appropriate time.\n\nKeep your emotions under control: Traders might sometimes grow emotionally tough about their companies. When they leave with the anticipation of generating a profit, they can stay on the market excessively long. This can hurt your portfolio considerably, which is why an automatic trader is utilized. Write down your trade strategies, and the software will work ruthlessly for you if you want to trade securely without allowing your emotions to get in danger.\n\nSimplifying complex trade procedures: certain business techniques are difficult to apply because they take too long to create or are too tough to grasp. These commercial approaches are undoubtedly profitable, but the employment of new technology will be necessary. Bots are able to perform these trades to optimize revenues.\n\nIs Bitcoin Up Right for Me\n\nThe Bitcoin Up trading robot is packed with great features. With its high speed, automation and user-friendly interface among many other features, you don\u2019t need to be a crypto expert to operate it. The Bitcoin Up platform is right for anyone who wants to make a good profit while trading the crypto market.\n\nWhat\u2019s Bitcoin Up, How Can I Use It Effectively?\n\nBitcoin Up is a bitcoin trading robot that automates cryptocurrency trades. The technique claims to have a 96.4 percent success record, which is questionable given the market\u2019s volatility. The platform analyzes massive amounts of data using sophisticated algorithms based on Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing.\n\nFurthermore, Market circumstances, historical data, patterns, and trends are among the data evaluated to find the optimum entry and exit locations for trade. To have more control over the assets to trade, stop loss, and other constraints, trades can also be set to manual. The robot executes the trade using a normal broker\u2019s platform once favourable market circumstances are satisfied.\n\nIn addition to automated trading, Bitcoin Up\u2019s bitcoin bot makes manual trading for specialists easier. On the trading interface, traders can enter their parameters, such as the asset to trade, the stop loss, the limits, and the price at which to purchase or sell, among other things. The deal is executed by the robot as soon as the trading requirements are satisfied. Using this method, you can place trades whenever you want without having to constantly check market circumstances.\n\nBitcoin Up is a free trading platform that facilitates automated trades for users. Bitcoin Up can be accessed by creating an account that requires your name, email and phone number. Bitcoin up has a demo feature that allows you to test out trade strategies to determine the best trades to place. Aside from the demo, bitcoin up connects you to a broker who helps you manage your account. The broker follows your instruction on the risk level you want to take and how much you wish to trade. You can use bitcoin Up effectively by harnessing the demo and choosing the kind of trade you want.\n\nWorthy Tips for Beginners to Make Positive Returns Using Bitcoin Robots\n\nLearn all you need to know about trading cryptocurrency\n\nIt is crucial to remember that it takes time and effort to understand the fundamentals of a trade. You need to know a couple of crucial concepts when you decide to use bitcoin robots as your business platform to get started and understand what you\u2019re doing. You won\u2019t have any trouble starting because, fortunately, the overwhelming majority of Bitcoin robots give you the vast majority of information you need.\n\nLearn about the crypto assets you want to trade\n\nKnow more than just the current performance of the asset about your favourite asset enables you to design stronger trade strategies based on changes in asset performance over time. Instead, if you have insufficient information on your item, you may be exposed to greater trade risks, hence raising the possibility of losses on your initial investment.\n\nJust invest money you can afford to lose\n\nWhen you start as a trader, you will undoubtedly make big initial deposits to earn more significant returns later on in your career. The money you invest can boost your odds of profits, but the money you invest can also up your chances of losing your money. In studying the principles of trade, starting with little amounts of cash and progressively increasing their investment as they gain more knowledge, novices must make every effort to be as secure as possible.\n\nDon\u2019t Rush\n\nHowever, despite the ever more competitive cryptocurrency market, this does not indicate that transactions should be entered as soon as accessible. Before you start trading, take time, among other things, to analyze your options, goals and dangers. This is the secret to success in the financial trading sector. The bulk of people make hasty financial judgments and research has proven that they take full advantage of their financial blunders.\n\nWithdraw your profits\n\nPlease ensure that after every profitable deal, you make a profit and deposit it into your account. This will help you to differentiate between your profit and the amount you invested.\n\nConsistently Trade\n\nAs the trading platform is always available, you can trade every day or night. There is nothing in your way to perform your routine. It is not necessary to spend at least 20 minutes a day on the platform.\n\nWhy are Bitcoin Robots Profitable? (November 2023)\n\nTiming\n\nBitcoin bots exceed manual cryptocurrency trading efficiency, because bitcoin bots are software programs that buy and sell cryptocurrency far faster than human beings can. You may want to use a trading bot to assist you to make more accurate market orders in stock exchanges with more precision utilizing a trading indicator.\n\nConsistency\n\nConsistency is one of the most significant differences when comparing bots and humans. Bots may work and transact continually according to particular indicators, although human beings are not. Robots outperform people by a considerable margin. It can be tough to maintain business discipline while dealing with cryptocurrencies; however, you can lessen the likelihood of emotional trading by using a trading bot.\n\nSpeed\n\nSpeed is crucial in the Bitcoin trading process since it\u2019s particularly true in the Bitcoin trading process in most other financial transactions. Bitcoin Trading Bots can therefore maximize your profits while enhancing the trader\u2019s efficiency.\n\nPossible Risks when trading with Bitcoin Up\n\nThe platform has no problems, even though the earnings are dim. One feature of bots\u2019 share is a high level of leverage, and Bitcoin Ups\u2019 leverage is as high as any other. While big gains are possible, it is also true that your whole capital could be lost in a matter of seconds. The platform offers leverage of 1:1000 which means the trader can bet 1000 the profit or loss. Trading with higher leverage is risky especially in the crypto space. For a new user, trading with leverage or using the robot to place leveraged trade may not work in your favor, as the returns are high so is the possibility of a loss of all your capital.\n\nDoes Bitcoin Up have an app?\n\nYes. You can use your web browser to access the Bitcoin Up application. With this, you won\u2019t have to worry about app upgrades, installations, or any other problems related to downloading apps. You can also use your mobile devices to access this platform, such as tablets and smartphones.\n\nHas Bitcoin Up Been Featured on the Media or Endorsed by a Celebrity?\n\nBitcoin Up Reddit Prominent Reddit articles claimed that Bitcoin Up is endorsed by several celebrities.

On the other hand, Jovanotti claims that such advertisements are inaccurate as he is unaware of them.\n\nBitcoin Up Review: Our Conclusion\n\nAccording to our investigation, Bitcoin Up appears to be a legitimate robot. While the services of a trading robot can be utilized as a part of a trading plan, a trader should avoid being fully reliant on the robot\u2019s capabilities. Furthermore, boasts of customers achieving profits of $1200 per day are nothing more than marketing tactics \u2013 you might not experience returns of this magnitude if you utilize Bitcoin Up. Furthermore, even though the robot\u2019s website makes it appear as if there are prominent individuals or celebrities linked with the platform, there are no such people or celebrities associated with the platform.\n\nTop 3 Alternative Bitcoin Robots:\n\n\n\nALSO READ:\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin Revolution Review\n\n\u2013 BitQH UK\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin Motion UK\n\nFAQs"
