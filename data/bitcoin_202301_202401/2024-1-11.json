        "title": "SEC has approved Bitcoin ETFs. Here\u2019s what you need to know - The Associated Press",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Nearly a dozen new bitcoin funds began trading in U.S. markets for the first time Thursday, providing increased access to the cryptocurrency for everyday investors.\n\nThe new exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, give investors an asset that closely tracks the price of bitcoin.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 funds from asset managers such as Blackrock, Invesco and Fidelity late Wednesday. The wave of approvals may work in your favor as fund managers seek to attract investors by competing on fees.\n\nBesides being a win for the fund managers, the approvals are also a win for the cryptocurrency industry, which has needed a victory after nearly two years of turmoil, including the failure of several crypto firms, most notably FTX in November 2022.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval, however, was lukewarm at best. Gary Gensler, the agency\u2019s chairman, has repeatedly said cryptocurrencies need more regulation and investor protections.\n\n\u201cInvestors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto,\u201d Gensler said.\n\nThe regulatory greenlight had been anticipated for several months, however, and the price of bitcoin has jumped about 70% since October on the belief that bitcoin ETFs will drive up demand for the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin rose 2% in early trading Thursday, and trading in the new ETFs was mixed.\n\nSome analysts think that ETFs may help stabilize crypto prices by broadening their use and potential audience. But many remain concerned that crypto ETFs will place too much risk and volatility into Americans\u2019 retirement accounts.\n\n\u201cThe notorious price volatility of bitcoin, as well as its fluctuating values against stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, could expose mainstream investors to a less familiar spectrum of investment risks,\u201d said Yiannis Giokas, senior director of Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n\nHere are some things to know about bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWHY ALL THE EXCITEMENT OVER A BITCOIN ETF?\n\nAn exchange traded fund, or ETF, is an easy way to invest in something or a group of things, like gold or junk bonds, without having to take possession of those assets. Unlike traditional mutual funds, ETFs trade like stocks, which means they can be bought and sold throughout the day.\n\nSince the inception of bitcoin, anyone wanting to own one would have to buy it. That in turn would mean either having to learn what a cold wallet is or having to open an account at a crypto trading platform like Coinbase or Binance.\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF could open the door to many new investors who don\u2019t want to take such extra steps.\n\nThe price of bitcoin has already soared in anticipation of the SEC\u2019s approval, with bitcoin trading at $47,500 Thursday, up from around $27,000 in mid-October. The price had sunk as low as $16,000 in November of 2022 following the implosion of the crypto exchange FTX.\n\nHOW WOULD THE ETF WORK?\n\nNew bitcoin ETFs will perform like the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD), which allows anyone to invest in gold without having to find someplace to store a bar or having to protect it. It\u2019s the same reason some people invest in the SPDR Bloomberg High Yield Bond ETF (JNK), which lets investors simply buy one thing instead of the more than 1,000 low-quality bonds that make up the index.\n\nThe Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) has been in existence since 2021, but it holds futures related to bitcoin, not the cryptocurrency itself. Those prices do not track as closely as a straight-up bitcoin ETF.\n\nHOW MANY BITCOIN ETFS COULD THERE BE?\n\nThe SEC said it gave approval to 11 ETFs, but more are certain to apply for trading in the coming months.\n\nWHAT ARE THE DISADVANTAGES OF AN ETF?\n\nLongtime crypto fans might object. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin were created in part due to mistrust of the traditional financial system. Wall Street would become an intermediary between investors and cryptocurrency in the case of ETFs.\n\nETFs also charge fees, though they tend to be relatively low compared with the overall financial industry. These fees are shown through what\u2019s called the expense ratio, which indicates how much of a fund\u2019s assets the ETF will take each year to cover its costs.\n\nWHEN IS IT BETTER TO HOLD ACTUAL BITCOIN?\n\nAn ETF will not put actual cryptocurrency into investors\u2019 accounts, meaning that they cannot use it. Also, an ETF would not provide investors with the same anonymity that crypto does, one of the big draws for many crypto investors.\n\nWHAT CONCERNS SHOULD INVESTORS HAVE?\n\nThe biggest concern for an investor in one of these ETFs is the notorious volatility in the price of bitcoin.\n\nDespite failing to catch on as a replacement for fiat, or paper, currencies, bitcoin soared near $68,000 in November of 2021. A year later it plunged below $20,000 as investors shunned riskier assets and a series of company blowups and scandals shook faith in the crypto industry.\n\nEven as regulators and law enforcement crack down on some of cryptos bad actors, like Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX, the industry still has a \u201cWild West\u201d feel to it.\n\nA hack of the SEC\u2019s X account this week, when a fake tweet claimed the ETFs had been approved, sent prices soaring and raised questions about both the ability of scammers to manipulate the market and the SEC\u2019s ability to stop them."

        "title": "SEC Approves Spot Bitcoin ETFs But Gensler Still Disapproves of Crypto - Mintz",
        "content": "On January 10, 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) approved eleven applications for spot exchange-traded funds (\u201cETFs\u201d) tracking Bitcoin. This landmark moment for the crypto asset industry has been over 10 years in the making. Many retail investors can now add Bitcoin exposure to their existing investment portfolios with the click of a button and just as easily as they purchase shares in an ETF tracking the S&P 500 \u2013 no crypto wallets or exchanges necessary.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of the Bitcoin ETF applications comes on the heels of an August 2023 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia that held that the SEC failed to adequately explain why it disallowed the listing and trading of a proposed Bitcoin ETF. The Court\u2019s decision was the culmination of a decade-long battle between the SEC and those applying to launch Bitcoin ETFs, dating back to July 2013, when the first application for a Bitcoin ETF was filed. The SEC denied that application in March 2017, generally concluding that the crypto asset market and regulatory oversight regarding crypto assets were not sufficiently mature. In the face of these early SEC denials, innovators in the crypto asset space continued to explore alternative paths to provide retail investors with access to Bitcoin through various means, including investment trusts, Bitcoin futures products, and spot ETFs in other countries.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of the eleven Bitcoin ETF applications can only be described as reluctant. In Chairman Gensler\u2019s statement immediately following the approvals, he said as much, explaining that \u201cthe Commission disapproved more than 20 exchange rule filings for spot bitcoin ETPs,\u201d and that this round of applications was similar to the previously doomed applications. Gensler acknowledged, however, that the circumstances were different after the Court of Appeals\u2019 August 2023 ruling, such that approving the applications became \u201cthe most sustainable path forward.\u201d This change in circumstances for the Bitcoin ETF applications does not mean, however, that the SEC\u2019s overall view on crypto assets has softened. As Gensler emphasized, \u201c[w]hile we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse bitcoin.\u201d\n\nIf any question remained whether the SEC\u2019s approval of the Bitcoin ETF applications might signal that the SEC was softening its stance on crypto, Gensler\u2019s post-approval statement answers that question with an emphatic \u201cno.\u201d Even in announcing the approval of a financial product where the underlying asset is Bitcoin, Gensler warned the public that \u201cinvestors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin\u201d and that Bitcoin is \u201cprimarily a speculative, volatile asset that\u2019s also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion, and terrorist financing.\u201d\n\nGensler\u2019s statement also suggests that attempts to launch ETFs based on other crypto assets will meet fierce SEC opposition. His statement emphasizes that the SEC\u2019s approval \u201cis cabined to ETPs holding one non-security commodity, bitcoin\u201d and that the approval \u201cshould in no way signal the Commission\u2019s willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities.\u201d\n\nBeyond offering a renewed sense of legitimacy to an industry whose reputation has recently been marred by scandal and unease, the SEC\u2019s approval has the practical effect of allowing more risk-averse retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without actually holding Bitcoin, itself. Indeed, the new Bitcoin ETFs would operate in much the same way as traditional ETFs, which investors can access through their brokerage accounts and on smartphones with the click of a button. This newfound availability on SEC-regulated financial exchanges means more investors can gain Bitcoin exposure without the hassle of buying the crypto asset itself. That said, some large financial institutions may have reservations about offering Bitcoin ETF access to retail customers from a \u201csuitability\u201d or \u201cbest interest\u201d perspective, and the SEC and other regulators may closely scrutinize the institutions that do.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision on Wednesday in granting approval for Bitcoin ETFs should be seen by crypto enthusiasts and retail investors alike as a major milestone in the push for crypto assets to become more institutionalized, more recognized as an independent asset class, and more widely available to retail investors. Despite the exciting news for investors, the decision should not be interpreted as a sea change in crypto asset regulation \u2013 at least from the SEC\u2019s perspective. It will, however, likely signal an influx of applications to launch ETFs with crypto assets other than Bitcoin (Ethereum or Ripple, for example). The approval of such products will likely face an even longer road to approval than Bitcoin ETFs, given Gensler\u2019s frequent distinction between most crypto assets that he believes are \u201csecurities,\u201d and Bitcoin, which he has characterized as a \u201ccommodity.\u201d\n\nSubscribe To Viewpoints"

It\u2019s been a roller coaster ride, especially in the last few years, and many traders have plunged into bitcoins, with some having made millions, while others have suffered great losses.\n\nIf you\u2019re considering this decentralized version of digital cash, you have a few different ways to buy bitcoins. You can buy them directly or indirectly from a few traditional brokers, as well as some newer upstarts. In fact, it\u2019s easier than ever to buy bitcoins, and you can likely do it at a lower commission than before too, since the Securities and Exchange Commission approved Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in early 2024.\n\nHere are five ways to buy bitcoins and some key factors that you need to watch.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is one kind of digital currency or cryptocurrency, a way to pay for things that exists only virtually. The currency debuted in 2009 and really broke into mainstream consciousness in 2017 with its rapid rise that year. Coins are created, or \u201cmined,\u201d when computers that organize the currency process and legitimize transactions in the currency.\n\nBitcoin uses a decentralized network of computers to manage everything \u2014 a distributed ledger called a blockchain that tracks transactions in the currency. It\u2019s like a huge public record of every transaction that has taken place in the currency. And the network monitors everything, ensuring the currency\u2019s integrity and the ownership of bitcoins.\n\n5 ways to buy bitcoins\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to trade Bitcoin, the good news is that you now have several options. You do not even need to open a separate and specialized account to do so, since major brokers offer a way to buy them via ETFs. (Here are some of the top brokers for trading cryptocurrency.) Plus, some unexpected players \u2013 PayPal and Cash App for example \u2013 now allow U.S. residents to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin, too.\n\nEach method below offers a different combination of cost, security and potential upside and downside.\n\nFinancial apps\n\nMany financial apps such as PayPal and Venmo now allow you to trade cryptocurrency.\n\nPayPal makes it tremendously easy to directly buy or sell bitcoins using the same app that you\u2019ve come to trust with your online payments. You\u2019ll pay $0.49 for trades involving less than $5, and the fees rise from there. Trades involving $200.01 \u2013 $1,000 cost 1.8 percent, while those above $1,000 come in at 1.5 percent. There\u2019s a spread markup on trades, but you won\u2019t pay a fee for holding cryptocurrency in your account, and you can trade as little as $1 at a time. Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash are also tradable here, as is a newly created PayPal stablecoin.\n\nVenmo charges the same fees, since it\u2019s owned by PayPal.\n\nCrypto exchanges\n\nCrypto exchanges are another popular option for those looking to buy Bitcoin. Exchanges offer a few key advantages to traders. First, the best crypto exchanges offer among the lowest possible all-in costs for trading cryptocurrency. So they\u2019re a good bet if cost is your key objective. Second, many exchanges don\u2019t charge spread mark-ups, which are hidden fees built into the trading prices. Third, many exchanges offer wallets, allowing you to securely store your cryptocurrency.\n\nThe fees at various crypto exchanges can differ markedly, so it\u2019s worthwhile looking around to find which offers the best combination of price, crypto choice and service. Popular options include Binance, Crypto.com and Kraken.\n\nTrading apps\n\nYou can pick up a few bitcoins with no direct commission by using a trading app such as Webull or Robinhood, though you\u2019ll end up making up for it with a spread markup. These apps also allow you to purchase Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nRobinhood takes its best trick \u2013 no commissions \u2013 and applies it to cryptocurrency, but it does charge a spread markup, the exact cost of which it does not reveal. You\u2019ll be able to buy bitcoins directly, and will have access to other digital currencies, too, a feature that other brokers listed here don\u2019t offer. Of course, you\u2019ll be able to buy stocks, ETFs and options while you\u2019re on the easy-to-use platform, including Bitcoin ETFs. Read more on Robinhood.\n\nWebull lets you trade a handful of cryptos, including Bitcoin. You\u2019ll pay a spread markup of 1 percent on each transaction, however. You can also trade stocks, Bitcoin ETFs and options. Read more on Webull.\n\nTraditional brokers\n\nSome traditional brokers have also ventured into the cryptocurrency arena, including Interactive Brokers and TradeStation. And with the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs, major brokers offer funds that let you buy the crypto, too.\n\nAt Interactive Brokers you\u2019ll be able to buy futures contracts on Bitcoin as well as trade the coin directly. The broker charges $5 per futures contract, which gives you exposure to five bitcoins. If you want to trade Bitcoin directly, you\u2019ll pay a competitive commission of 0.12-0.18 percent of your trade value, depending on your monthly volume. You\u2019ll also have access to Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. Interactive Brokers provides a whole range of other tradable securities, giving you access to securities across the world. Read more on Interactive Brokers.\n\nBitcoin ATMs\n\nAnother option is to buy bitcoins directly through a Bitcoin ATM, though you\u2019re likely to pay much more in commissions than you would elsewhere. You\u2019ll be able to buy bitcoins and some ATMs will allow you to sell them, too, using cash or a debit card. But you may need a Bitcoin wallet to make the transaction. Commissions can be pricey, with some ATMs charging around 7 percent per transaction, while the fees at others may stretch into the teens.\n\nBuying Bitcoin: Here\u2019s what to watch for\n\nAs you\u2019re considering how to buy Bitcoin, you\u2019ll want to evaluate the following factors, since they should influence your choice of where to buy it or whether to ultimately avoid it altogether.\n\nOwnership. What do you want to own exactly? You can own Bitcoin directly (say, through an ETF) or a derivative such as a futures contract, which offers a return on the currency\u2019s movement.\n\nWhat do you want to own exactly? You can own Bitcoin directly (say, through an ETF) or a derivative such as a futures contract, which offers a return on the currency\u2019s movement. Upside/downside. Your potential gain is related directly to whether you own the currency directly or via futures contract. By owning Bitcoin directly, your profit increases by a dollar with every dollar increase in the currency. In contrast, with futures you can gain much more quickly without having to front as much capital. However, your downside is more limited by owning directly, while you can lose more money with futures.\n\nYour potential gain is related directly to whether you own the currency directly or via futures contract.

Futures contracts get you a big piece of the action relatively cheaply, while some brokers may charge you several percent to buy directly. A few percent might not sound like a lot, but if you\u2019re trading in and out of the market, it will quickly eat away at your profits. In contrast, a Bitcoin ETF gets you in the game quickly with no direct commission and a low annual expense ratio, and it\u2019s simpler to trade that way, too.\n\nCommissions can vary widely depending on how you purchase Bitcoin.

In contrast, a Bitcoin ETF gets you in the game quickly with no direct commission and a low annual expense ratio, and it\u2019s simpler to trade that way, too. Security. One of the biggest concerns with any investment is making sure that it\u2019s secure. Some newer cryptocurrency players have had serious problems with security. For example, hackers stole about $570 million worth of Binance\u2019s BNB coin in 2022. More traditional brokers may offer better security because they\u2019ve been dealing with the issue for much longer. And with Bitcoin ETFs, the fund company manages security, making it an easy way to own the cryptocurrency.\n\nYou may also receive bitcoins as part of commercial transactions. Regardless of how you came by your coins, any transaction in the cryptocurrency is reportable to the IRS at tax time.\n\nWhat information is needed to purchase Bitcoin?\n\nWhen you open an account at a traditional brokerage or a crypto exchange, you\u2019ll need to provide basic personal information. Of course, you\u2019ll need to provide your name, but the firm will also require other data such as your Social Security number, your address, your phone number and your bank account number. You may also have to detail how much trading experience you have and how comfortable you are with trading, depending on the institution.\n\nThis information allows the firm to identify you and verify who you are. It\u2019s also vital during tax time when the broker or exchange prepares documents on your gains and losses, reports that you\u2019ll need to accurately file your taxes.\n\nIs Bitcoin an effective hedge against inflation?\n\nSome people think Bitcoin may be an effective way to protect yourself from inflation, or what\u2019s called an inflation hedge. A hedge is a kind of investment that offsets, partially or fully, the price move in another asset. So, an inflation hedge would protect you from inflation in some way.\n\nThere\u2019s little evidence to support the assertion that Bitcoin acts as an inflation hedge, experts say. Bitcoin has not existed long enough to have been through a major inflationary period, though it\u2019s been tested during the recent challenging macro environment. Bitcoin fell substantially in 2022, despite inflation rising to its highest level in decades.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not an effective hedge against the volatility of the stock market, either. Experts say that Bitcoin acts more like a risky tech stock or momentum stock, meaning that it rises when these stocks rise and falls when they fall. That\u2019s not the kind of thing you want from a hedge, which should perform the opposite of the asset being hedged, zigging when the market zags.\n\nWhere is the best place to store bitcoins?\n\nThe best place to store your bitcoins depends on what you intend to use them for. For example, if you plan on trading them, it may be best to keep them with the crypto exchange or broker where you do your trading, especially if you\u2019re trading frequently or in the near term. Like other ETFs, Bitcoin ETFs are held in your brokerage account.\n\nOthers may opt for a crypto wallet, if they\u2019re planning on spending the cryptocurrency or even just locking it down for safekeeping. A crypto wallet can hold and secure your cryptocurrency, though if you\u2019re taking custody of your assets, then it\u2019s your complete responsibility, and you could wind up losing your cryptocurrency if you\u2019re not careful.\n\nTwo popular options for this latter group include hot wallets and cold wallets.\n\nHot wallets\n\nA hot wallet allows your cryptocurrency to be used or moved around easily. Because your coins are secured by software rather than hardware and are still connected to the internet, they\u2019re less secure than cold wallets. But if you\u2019re using a wallet because you intend to use the cryptocurrency, it makes sense to go with a hot wallet. Hot wallets come in a few varieties:\n\nDesktop wallets: You can download wallet software to your computer and manage your crypto holdings from there. When you\u2019re done transacting, you can even take it offline, increasing your security.\n\nYou can download wallet software to your computer and manage your crypto holdings from there. When you\u2019re done transacting, you can even take it offline, increasing your security. Web wallets: This browser plug-in allows you to connect to the blockchain and make transactions quickly, but the internet connection makes it less secure.\n\nThis browser plug-in allows you to connect to the blockchain and make transactions quickly, but the internet connection makes it less secure. Mobile wallets: You can use software on a mobile device if you\u2019re using crypto to pay or transact.\n\nSome providers of hot wallets also offer multiple types of hardware wallets, so you can use one software type across multiple devices.\n\nCold wallets\n\nA cold wallet is more valuable if you really want to lock down your cryptocurrency and make it nearly impervious. Cold wallets rely on hardware, a physical device, to secure your holdings, and it looks like a USB thumb drive. This can be disconnected from the internet, making your holdings very secure. When you\u2019re ready to transact, you can plug it in and conduct business.\n\nWhile more secure than a hot wallet, a cold wallet has other potential risks, including theft of the device, loss of the wallet and even loss of the password. So even cold wallets are not foolproof.\n\nBottom line\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to purchase Bitcoin or other digital currencies as an investment, it\u2019s important to keep costs to a minimum. Given the novelty of the crypto market, many brokers would love to maximize their commissions (in contrast to the stock market where trading fees have gone to zero). Those fees eat into your profits, so look for a way to minimize those frictional costs. But the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs provides a cheaper and more secure way for traders to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile the price of Bitcoin has run high quickly, it still carries serious risks that make it not suitable for everyone. Those looking for conservative investments or who cannot afford to lose money should consider avoiding Bitcoin or trading only with an amount they are willing to lose."

        "content": "Bitcoin bulls join forces with Wall Street\n\nA new era of crypto trading is expected to begin as soon as today, after the S.E.C. finally approved the creation of new exchange-traded funds that would allow investors to more easily buy and sell Bitcoin.\n\nThe regulator yesterday authorized 11 fund managers \u2014 including the Wall Street fund giants BlackRock and VanEck and smaller companies like GrayScale and Valkyrie \u2014 to begin offering the new crypto investment products.\n\nIn anticipation of the decision, the companies have been aggressively cutting their management fees to gain an early advantage. \u201cThe fundamental change is a whole lot more money is coming into this asset class,\u201d Paul Grewal, the chief legal counsel of the crypto exchange Coinbase, told DealBook. Matthew Sigel, the head of digital asset research at VanEck, called it a \u201chistoric\u201d moment.\n\nBitcoin hit a 21-month high this week, as crypto boosters shrugged off a series of high-profile bankruptcies and a sweeping legal crackdown against some of the biggest players in the sector. That said, the cryptocurrency\u2019s price barely budged this morning, trading below $47,000, giving the digital token a market value of roughly $920 billion."

        "title": "SEC Greenlights Bitcoin ETFs: What Happened and What It Portends - Foley & Lardner LLP",
        "content": "On January 10, 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the launch of several BTC Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).[1] The approval order resolves the critical legal and regulatory issues entailed in launching a BTC ETF. Shares in trusts holding BTC can now be bought and sold on SEC-regulated exchanges, although other issues remain.\n\nIt may be that the SEC did this only because it was basically ordered to do so by three federal judges, and we note that its approval follows more than twenty disapprovals of other similar funds over the last six years.[2] But for once we see forward-looking progress rather than \u201cregulation by enforcement.\u201d\n\nJames Gorman, recently retired CEO and now Executive Chairman of Morgan Stanley, allows that Bitcoin has a role to play, albeit a \u201cvery small\u201d one, in a rich person\u2019s portfolio.[3] Meanwhile, Jamie Dimon, CEO and Chairman of JPMorgan Chase, has long held, to the contrary, that Bitcoin is \u201cworthless.\u201d[4] Between these two grand old men of traditional finance (TradFi), who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong about Bitcoin?\n\nAsked to decide, the SEC \u2013 to its credit \u2014 has decided not to decide. Rather, the SEC will let the markets decide. Specifically, the SEC will insist on full disclosure regarding Bitcoin ETFs, then let investors decide whether they want to invest.\n\nIn this piece, we explain how the stage for this development was set by Grayscale Investments\u2019 victory over the SEC in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Next, we explain what the SEC has now approved, and why. Then we comment on what\u2019s to come and what it all means.\n\nGrayscale Investments v. SEC\n\nThe SEC\u2019s order approving these BTC ETFs (Approval Order)[5] follows in the wake of Grayscale Investments\u2019 August 2023 victory in the D.C. Circuit, in which a unanimous court (appointed by Presidents from both parties) ruled that the SEC was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d in rejecting Grayscale\u2019s application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a BTC ETF listed on NYSE Arca.[6] The SEC had approved applications for the listing of two ETFs based on BTC futures contracts. The court found these futures-based ETFs to be materially similar to Grayscale\u2019s BTC ETF such that they all should have received the same regulatory treatment. The court\u2019s decision turned on two elements: the underlying assets (BTC futures and BTC cash) being closely related and the exchanges being expected to have the same controls in place for detecting fraudulent or manipulative market misconduct.\n\nBitcoin is a commodity. Like other commodities, it trades both in cash markets and in futures markets. In the BTC cash market, cash is exchanged for BTC, with delivery expected speedily. In the futures market, cash is exchanged for a contract to buy or sell BTC at a predetermined price on a specific later date. The contracts are traded on a designated contract market, more commonly known as a futures exchange. For example, BTC futures contracts trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Again, the court found that the assets underlying each kind of ETF \u2013 the BTC futures ETF and the BTC ETF \u2014 were closely related.\n\nThe SEC had denied Grayscale\u2019s application \u2013 and more than twenty other applications to list a BTC ETF \u2013 on the ground that such a product is not \u201cdesigned to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices\u201d as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).[7] In approving the two BTC futures ETFs, however, the SEC had found that each of them had satisfied legal requirements with a surveillance sharing agreement between the listing exchange and the CME.[8] The listing exchanges for Grayscale and for the BTC futures ETFs have identical surveillance sharing agreements with the CME. The court found, therefore, that there should be the same likelihood of detecting fraudulent or manipulative conduct in the market for BTC as in the market for BTC futures.\n\nThe Approval Order\n\nIn its Approval Order, the SEC approved the listing and trading of several BTC ETFs, marking a significant step in BTC\u2019s integration into TradFi markets. The ETFs that were approved by the Approval Order include the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, the Hashdex Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust, the Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund, the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, the VanEck Bitcoin Trust, the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, and the Franklin Bitcoin ETF.\n\nTo justify its conclusion, the SEC focused on the high correlation between spot BTC prices and CME BTC futures prices. The SEC relied on data submitted by applicants showing that the prices of spot BTC and of CME futures BTC have been highly correlated over the past 2.5 years.[9] From this, the SEC reasoned that manipulation in spot BTC markets would affect CME BTC futures prices and that CME surveillance would help detect any such manipulation. The SEC concluded that CME surveillance can effectively detect manipulation,[10] thereby justifying approval of the BTC ETFs.\n\nAs part of the Approval Order, the SEC accelerated the approval process of the applications, noting that the proposed rule changes to list and trade shares of BTC ETFs do not present novel regulatory issues. Notably, the SEC stated that the proposed rule changes to allow for the listing and trading of shares of BTC ETFs are consistent with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act.[11]\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nThe Approval Order resolved the critical legal and regulatory issues entailed in launching a BTC ETF. Shares in trusts holding BTC can now be bought and sold on SEC-regulated exchanges, but other issues remain.\n\nCritically, there will be a brutal battle for market dominance. It is often the case in the ETF industry that the first mover precludes competition by gaining so much market share early on that no one else can get traction. It is unclear that such will be the case here. Even before the BTC ETFs were approved, sponsors were competing against one another by cutting prices. Price competition will likely continue. Other factors such as name brand recognition and commitment to the crypto asset industry \u2013 or to disruptive technologies more generally \u2013 might also prove important. Among investment banks, likewise, price will matter, but so too will market power, especially retail distribution. Because these are single-asset funds, analyst prowess would seem to be relatively unimportant.\n\nThe Approval Order covers BTC ETFs only. It does not cover ETH funds, AVAX funds, Solana funds, or any other possible single-crypto-asset funds, nor does it cover multiple-crypto-asset funds. All of these, however, are theoretically possible. In his separate statement, Chair Gensler reiterated his well-known opinion that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of crypto assets are securities. But the federal courts have sometimes disagreed with him.[12] And even when he is right, an ETF can be brought to market if the SEC staff is directed to work with the applicant to craft a structure that will fit within the law.\n\nWe are optimistic about the development of additional cash market ETFs, as well as derivative and futures products and competitive private funds. In the realm of public funds, of course, the sponsor will need to apply to the SEC for relief and work with an exchange to obtain relief, fitting within the existing literature (now including the Approval Order) or arguing persuasively for an extension of existing precedents.\n\nOur Perspective\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of BTC ETFs is historic because it has been sought by so many for so long and because the potential market for BTC ETFs is multiple trillions of dollars. BTC ETFs are not a new asset class. The ETF is a new (and possibly better) wrapper for an existing asset, which is BTC \u2013 the first and most dominant asset among the US$1.7 trillion class of crypto assets. BTC was doing fine before BTC ETFs were approved, having doubled yet again in the last twelve months, and it has spread globally.\n\nChair Gensler himself noted in his separate statement that the Approval Order does not \u201csignal anything about the Commissions views as to the status of other crypto assets under the federal securities laws or about the current state of non-compliance of certain crypto asset market participants with the federal securities laws.\u201d The SEC has not changed course from its current positions regarding this asset class, but rather seems to have acknowledged the legal requirements that it treat like cases alike and let the market decide.\n\nThis SEC action is extremely encouraging. For one thing, it shows SEC obedience to the rule of law. Chair Gensler in his separate statement asserted twice that his SEC is \u201cmerit neutral,\u201d which is indeed its legally required perspective.[13]\n\nEven better from the viewpoint of technology innovation, this SEC action enables more of a United States retail market to develop for BTC, and probably other crypto assets, which until now has been foreclosed by administrative fiat. We will not be surprised if, years hence, crypto assets as an asset class have grown well beyond their current range and if this SEC action is viewed in hindsight as a watershed event because it enabled U.S. retail investors to buy, sell, and hold crypto assets in their IRAs, 401Ks, and brokerage accounts. That has been our experience with other financial innovations, including ETFs in particular.\n\nWe have been legal counsel for the structuring and regulatory approval of several pathbreaking ETFs, including the first foreign exchange funds and the first actively-managed fund. The ETF industry, which was alternately ridiculed and ignored in its infancy (like crypto), has grown since then to rival the larger mutual fund industry.\n\nSponsors and investment banks will now contend with one another to demonstrate to the United States retail investing public that their specific BTC ETF products, customer platforms, and prices are superior to their competitors\u2019 offerings and therefore deserve market acceptance. More sponsors and banks will probably seek market entry and gain it, at least on paper. From among many approved BTC ETF sponsors, only a few are likely to emerge victorious. But that is a commercial and market fight, not a legal and regulatory one.\n\nWe would be remiss were we not to remind readers \u2014 as in ending this paper we will do \u2014 that good governance by crypto-savvy, ETF-savvy officers and directors, and expert SEC legal advice by counsel, will all be necessary for sustainable market success in this industry. The digital assets industry is still a young and highly creative technology sector that is fraught with perils identified as legal and regulatory \u201crisk factors\u201d in several BTC ETF prospectuses.\n\nETFs are complex. Crypto assets are beyond complex. Sponsors and banks should not seek SEC approval for a crypto asset ETF, nor should a bank, broker, or RIA contract with a crypto asset ETF sponsor or authorized participant, unless led and advised by crypto-savvy, ETF-savvy officers, directors, and legal counsel. This is especially true for sponsors themselves, who need TradFi experience combined with DeFi experience on their boards and in their trenches.\n\n[1] In this paper, we generally refer to Bitcoin traded in the cash market by its ticker symbol, which is \u201cBTC.\u201d Exchange-traded funds or other exchange-traded products, all of which have many features of mutual funds but issue shares that trade on SEC-registered stock exchanges, are commonly referred to as \u201cETFs\u201d or \u201cETPs.\u201d An ETP whose portfolio is largely or entirely Bitcoin is referred to in this paper as a \u201cBTC ETF.\u201d\n\n[2] See Gensler, G. \u201cStatement on the Approval of Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Products,\u201d U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 10 January, 2024\n\n[3] See \u201cFormer Morgan Stanley CEO Says Bitcoin Is Not Going Away,\u2019\u201d CoinMarketCap, accessed 10 January 2024.\n\n[4] In an interview with FOX Business, Jamie Dimon reiterated his claim that BTC \u201cdoesn\u2019t have value\u201d even as JPMorgan Chase was named as an authorized participant in Blackrock\u2019s proposed BTC ETF.

The SEC has lost several cases against the crypto industry. And the GAO concluded that the SEC had violated the Congressional Review Act by issuing Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, relating to crypto asset accounting, without submitting a report to Congress or the Comptroller General as required by law. The longest-serving member of the SEC, who is Commissioner Peirce, has criticized the Commission majority for blocking digital asset development by engaging in merit regulation.

Peirce to Release No. 34-83723 (relating to the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust), July 26, 2018, (\u201cthe Commission is engaging in merit regulation\u201d); Commissioner Hester M.

        "content": "Trading is set to begin for a new type of bitcoin fund that gives investors access to the crypto market without some of the hassle and fees of owning bitcoin outright.\n\nFreshly approved by federal regulators, bitcoin ETFs -- Exchange-Traded Funds -- allow investors to buy an asset that tracks the price movement of bitcoin.\n\nFidelity, BlackRock and a host of other top investment firms have already begun to offer the product.\n\nBitcoin ETFs promise major potential gains but also notable downsides, presenting investors with a wide range of outcomes that will test their tolerance for risk, analysts told ABC News.\n\nInvestors could capitalize on a possible rise in the price of bitcoin if a flood of money into Bitcoin ETFs vaults the cryptocurrency into mainstream markets, they said.\n\nHowever, investors should be prepared to weather the asset's considerable volatility as well as uncertainty stemming from its association with issues of fraud and mismanagement in the wider crypto industry, they added.\n\n\"It's going to be a volatile ride,\" Bryan Armour, the director of passive strategies research at financial firm Morningstar, told ABC News. \"You have to know that going in and make sure you're okay with that.\"\n\nSome analysts said the new products could unleash a flow of investment and trigger a major spike in the price of Bitcoin, supercharging the most well-known and successful digital asset.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF would elicit more than $14 billion of investment inflows within its first year on the market and as much as a 74% price increase over that period, Galaxy Digital, a crypto management and research firm, said in a report in October.\n\nSome traditional institutions outside of the crypto arena have echoed that optimism, at least to a degree. Deutsche Bank forecasted price increases for bitcoin this year due in part to \"greater institutional investment\" in Bitcoin ETFs, according to a report reviewed by ABC News.\n\nA run-up in price would follow some previous bull runs for bitcoin, including a rise of nearly 70% over the past six months. But the cryptocurrency has also undergone periods of major decline.\n\nThe price of bitcoin experienced a decline of at least 45 percentage points four times in the past five years, Armour said on Wednesday in a report for Morningstar.\n\nThe acceptance of Bitcoin ETFs among a wide swathe of investors could smooth out some of the volatility but that outcome may not come to pass, Armour told ABC News.\n\n\"If adoption becomes wider and the market becomes more mature, the price will become more stable,\" Armour said. \"For now, I don't see it stabilizing.\"\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Gary Gensler attends a meeting of the Financial Stability Oversight Council at the U.S. Department of Treasury on December 14, 2023 in Washington, DC. Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nSetting aside their volatility, Bitcoin ETFs carry risks posed by the uncertain effects of fraud and mismanagement within the crypto sector, some analysts said.\n\nThe crypto industry entered this year bruised after a series of high-profile collapses and company scandals.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, formerly one of the industry's most prominent figures, could serve decades in prison after he was convicted on fraud charges in a federal trial. Changpeng Zhao, the founder and former CEO of major cryptocurrency exchange Binance, faces a jail sentence of up to 18 months after he pleaded guilty to federal charges of money laundering.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler affirmed the agency's decision to approve Bitcoin ETFs but offered a note of caution about cryptocurrency.\n\n\"We did not approve or endorse bitcoin,\" Gensler said. \"Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.\"\n\nJames Butterfill, head of research at digital asset management firm CoinShares, rebuked concerns about bitcoin tied to potential manipulation or fraud.\n\nThe green light to trade Bitcoin ETFs gives them the \"regulatory stamp approval,\" Butterfill said.\n\nUltimately, investors considering Bitcoin ETFs should consider the role a potentially risky asset should play in their wider portfolio, analysts said.\n\n\"You shouldn't allocate more to Bitcoin ETFs than you're willing to lose,\" Armour told ABC News.\n\nCallie Cox, an analyst at the investment company eToro who tracks cryptocurrencies, said each individual should weigh Bitcoin ETFs within his or her own financial goals.\n\n\"You have your own hopes and dreams for your portfolio, so you should see how it fits,\" Cox said."

        "title": "You can now invest in bitcoin ETFs. But should you? - CNN",
        "content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nIt\u2019s official. The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday gave the green light to the listing and trading of 11 bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. And they will be coming online quickly, with several starting to trade Thursday.\n\nThat means if you have have been curious about investing in bitcoin, you can do so in an SEC-regulated product, with fewer of the technical and cybersecurity risks that come with investing in it directly.\n\nBut before you jump on the bitcoin bandwagon, here are some things to think about.\n\nUnderstand what bitcoin is \u2026 and what it isn\u2019t\n\nIt\u2019s important to grasp what kind of asset bitcoin is.\n\nBitcoin is not tethered to anything tangible like the goods of a company or a natural resource.\n\nAnd it is not legal tender in the United States or most other countries. The US Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network characterizes it as \u201ca medium of exchange that operates like a currency in some environments.\u201d\n\nBut in the eyes of crypto advocates and some traditional money managers like Fidelity, it is a bet on the future of an increasingly digital world, and it\u2019s a bet that it will hold its value over time more than any other crypto currency because it is limited in number. Its creator designed it so that there will only be a finite number of bitcoin ever available.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is best understood as a monetary good\u2026 because bitcoin is the most (relative to other digital assets) secure, decentralized, sound digital money,\u201d Fidelity said in a recent report. \u201cAny other project or blockchain network that requires its users to believe they are transacting with a token that has real monetary value likely needs to be directly or indirectly connected to bitcoin as the ultimate monetary good.\u201d\n\nNew wrapper, many of the same risks\n\nBeing able to invest in bitcoin through an SEC-regulated exchange-traded fund may be appealing to some, given the lack of protections, backup and regulatory oversight for wallets and custodial crypto exchange accounts.\n\nFor instance, blockchain data researcher Chainanalysis reported that in 2023 digital wallet holders were scammed out of millions of dollars through a phishing scam that tricked them into giving scammers permission to spend the digital tokens in their wallets. The New York Times in 2021 had a report showing how crypto investors lost access to their crypto holdings because they forgot the codes to their digital wallets. And investors learned the hard way about the lack of consumer protections when crypto exchanges get into trouble, like the demise of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX.\n\nOne of the advantages of investing in an ETF of any kind, bitcoin included, is that you can house it at a registered broker-dealer that is a member of the nonprofit Securities Investor Protection Corporation and is therefore SIPC-insured. That means you will receive up to $500,000 of protection should your brokerage firm ever go bankrupt.\n\nIn addition, \u201cthe newly approved products [are trading] on established and trustworthy exchanges (CBOE, NASDAQ, and NYSE), which are generally more stable and secure than crypto exchanges. \u2026 [And] being able to access Bitcoin in an ETF format means investors can easily add it to a diversified portfolio and monitor it without needing a separate account,\u201d Alex Michalka, vice president of investment research at robo-advisory firm Wealthfront, said in an email.\n\nPlus, bitcoin ETFs will make it easier for financial advisers to access the cryptocurrency for their clients who can afford to invest in alternative asset classes.\n\nBut make no mistake, the price of a bitcoin will be just as volatile whether you invest in it directly yourself or through an ETF.\n\n\u201cOver the past 5 years, the volatility (in bitcoin) has been four times that of [the] stock market,\u201d said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research at Morningstar. \u201cThe exposure is the same. \u2026 It\u2019s still bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe price of bitcoin has fluctuated wildly over the years. For example, it hit an all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November 2021, then fell below $17,000 during the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d of 2022 and has mostly been trading north of $45,000 in the run-up to the SEC\u2019s decision. On Thursday, it was around $46,000 at midday.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, cryptocurrency markets notoriously have been subject to price manipulation and criminal activities.\n\nBetter Markets, a nonprofit that advocates for, among other things, greater investor protections, strongly opposes the SEC\u2019s approval of bitcoin ETFs. Among its objections is the bitcoin market\u2019s history of artificially inflated trading volumes known as \u201cwash\u201d trading, which can make it appear that there is more investor interest than there actually is. And it remains unconvinced that the SEC\u2019s efforts to ensure more transparency in the bitcoin trading market, which it does not regulate, will provide adequate protection for ordinary investors.\n\nDeciding if a bitcoin ETF makes sense for you\n\nThe investment firms that have received approval to offer bitcoin ETFs are competing fiercely for investor dollars. All but one have proposed very low management and administrative fees and say they will waive their fees for several months.\n\nBut none of that should influence your decision about whether to invest in the first place. Your financial goals, risk tolerance and time horizon will be key factors in assessing whether it is worth it for you to put money in a bitcoin ETF.\n\nPut bluntly, \u201cIt\u2019s not for the faint of heart,\u201d Armour said. \u201cThere is no way to fundamentally value where it should be priced at. It\u2019s at the whim of supply and demand.\u201d\n\nOne certified financial planner, Alex Lozano, believes clients should only take as much risk as necessary on any investment to achieve their goals.\n\nGiven that a bitcoin ETF is likely to be considered a speculative investment, Lozano said, \u201cI would not recommend [it], unless [investors] had the ability to lose their investment or hold it for long periods of time.\u201d\n\nIf you do decide to invest in a bitcoin ETF, certified financial planner Trent D. Porter recommends making it no more than 3% of your overall portfolio. And if you normally invest on a platform that automatically rebalances your portfolio for you, make sure the system does not rebalance your holdings based on your bitcoin investment.\n\n\u201cEven a very small percentage in a bitcoin fund can cause a large amount of volatility in the overall portfolio,\u201d Porter said. \u201cAs an extreme example, if bitcoin were to fall to zero, an automated system would continue to rebalance into the fund until the entire portfolio was gone.\u201d"

        "title": "Why Crypto Idealogues Won't Touch Bitcoin ETFs - WIRED",
        "content": "Bitcoin devotees are declaring a historic victory after US regulators approved a new, more accessible way for people to invest in the crypto asset after a decade of resistance. Yet they won\u2019t go anywhere near it themselves.\n\nOn January 10, after a farcical false start, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved the launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the country. The ETFs will be issued by a selection of big-name financial institutions\u2014including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton\u2014and will give people a way to invest in bitcoin through a brokerage, as if it were a stock. The price of the ETF shares will follow the price of bitcoin.\n\nThe arrival of the new ETFs has been broadly celebrated by bitcoin investors, who believe they will legitimize the asset in the eyes of wealthy institutional investors and make it easier for laypeople to invest, thereby broadening demand and driving up the price. The inconvenient catch is that spot bitcoin ETFs are at odds with practically everything bitcoin is supposed to stand for.\n\nIn their 2008 white paper, bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, outlined a vision for electronic cash that changes hands directly from person to person, under the control of no financial institution. It was two fingers to profit-hungry Wall Street. Yet the ETFs will be issued by some of the largest financial institutions in the US. Nor do investors own or keep any actual bitcoin; they are buying a representation. ETF investors may stand to \u201cbenefit from the financial upside, but will not attain all the benefits that Satoshi envisioned,\u201d says Peter McCormack, host of podcast What Bitcoin Did. \u201cThe true ownership of bitcoin entails direct possession.\u201d\n\nIn the weeks after launch, hundreds of millions of dollars are expected to flood into spot bitcoin ETFs. The result will effectively be a bifurcation of the asset into a form of bitcoin for investment and a bitcoin for bitcoin\u2019s sake\u2014held only by ideologues.\n\nTo explain the dissonance between the celebratory reception to the new ETFs and their blatant incompatibility with the Nakamoto ethos, bitcoiners point to the difficulty in achieving widespread adoption to date. The ETFs are a calculated compromise, they say, that addresses the unwillingness of regular people to deal with the perils of storing crypto themselves."

A Bitcoin ETF is managed by an investment firm and listed on a traditional stock exchange.\n\nWhile it\u2019s down from its November 2021 all-time high, Bitcoin has increased substantially in anticipation of the ETF approvals. Naturally, the increase in price has both individual and institutional investors wondering how they can get in on the action.\n\nTrading directly through a crypto exchange can be complicated for some investors. But with the introduction of ETFs tied to Bitcoin, the process of investing could become much simpler.\n\n\u201cInvestors will now be able to benefit from the added protections of the ETF structure and get Bitcoin exposure as part of a diversified portfolio with less volatility,\u201d said Alex Michalka, vice president of investment research at Wealthfront.\n\nThe SEC approved applications from 11 asset managers to list spot Bitcoin ETFs. Many of the funds cut their fees leading up to the approvals in an effort to win early investors.\n\nWho should invest in Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nInvesting in a Bitcoin ETF could be a good option for people who are looking for a more traditional way of investing in the digital currency. Investing directly in Bitcoin can be complicated and involves questions of how the asset will be stored and which exchange to purchase on. ETFs remove some of that complexity by packaging Bitcoin into ETF form.\n\nThe ETF structure could also make it easier for some institutional investors to enter the crypto market, which could help keep demand for Bitcoin high.\n\nStill, Bitcoin is a high-risk investment with a very short trading history and no underlying cash flows to support its value.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset that\u2019s also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion, and terrorist financing,\u201d Gensler said.\n\nWhere do you purchase Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nBitcoin ETFs are available through most online brokers who offer traditional securities like stocks and bonds. Some of these brokers may also offer the opportunity to invest in Bitcoin directly, while others only allow you to trade Bitcoin futures.\n\nETFs trade on traditional exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq. If you\u2019re interested in the widest offering of cryptocurrencies and are looking to directly invest in digital coins, you\u2019ll need an account with a crypto exchange, such as Binance or Kraken, but these exchanges find themselves in the regulatory crosshairs of the SEC.\n\nBitcoin ETFs\n\nETF Ticker Expense ratio Bitwise Bitcoin ETF BITB 0.0 percent (0.20 percent)* ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ARKB 0.0 percent (0.21 percent)* Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust FBTC 0.0 percent (0.25 percent)* Wisdom Tree Bitcoin Fund BTCW 0.0 percent (0.30 percent)* Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF BTCO 0.0 percent (0.39 percent)* Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund BRRR 0.0 percent (0.49 percent)* iShares Bitcoin Trust IBIT 0.12 percent (0.25 percent)* VanEck Bitcoin Trust HODL 0.25 percent Franklin Bitcoin ETF EZBC 0.29 percent Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC 1.50 percent\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\n*Note: Bitwise, ARK, WisdomTree to waive fee for first six months and/or $1 billion in assets. Invesco to waive fee for first six months and/or $5 billion in assets. IShares to lower fee for first 12 months and/or $5 billion in assets. Valkyrie to waive fee for first three months. Fidelity to waive fee until July 31, 2024.\n\nAre Bitcoin ETFs regulated?\n\nAll ETFs that trade on U.S. exchanges are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIn August 2023, an appeals court ruled against the SEC for rejecting an application from cryptocurrency asset manager Grayscale Investments to list its spot Bitcoin ETF on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThe court ruled that the SEC was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d to reject Grayscale\u2019s application, since its proposed Bitcoin ETF is \u201cmaterially similar\u201d to already-approved Bitcoin futures ETFs.\n\nIn October, the SEC chose not to appeal the decision.\n\nOther types of crypto-related investments\n\nIf you\u2019re not satisfied with the offering of crypto-related ETFs, you have some other options for investing in the digital currency world.\n\nInvest in crypto directly\n\nYou can always choose to invest directly in cryptocurrencies through a broker or crypto exchange. Some brokers offer a limited number of options for investing in crypto, typically offering only the major coins. If you\u2019re looking for a broad offering, you\u2019ll need to go through a crypto exchange, but be careful to watch out for costly fees associated with buying and selling.\n\nBlockchain ETFs\n\nAnother way to make crypto-adjacent investments is to invest in ETFs focused on blockchain, which is the technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Blockchain ETFs hold stocks of companies that are using blockchain technology as part of their current and future business plans. Holdings often include a combination of crypto companies, tech giants and financial institutions.\n\nStock in crypto companies\n\nThere is also the option of investing in stocks of companies that are directly involved in cryptocurrency. Coinbase, a large crypto exchange, went public in 2021 and other companies such as PayPal and Robinhood have also made a push into cryptocurrencies. Be sure to thoroughly research each company and understand how much of their business is tied to crypto before investing.\n\nBottom line\n\nTraders eagerly awaiting a Bitcoin ETF got their wish in 2024 after the SEC approved the applications for several funds that invest directly in Bitcoin. There are also other ways to get in on the crypto action through stocks and ETFs that are indirectly tied to crypto or blockchain technology. You can also invest directly through a crypto exchange.\n\nEditorial Disclaimer: All investors are advised to conduct their own independent research into investment strategies before making an investment decision. In addition, investors are advised that past investment product performance is no guarantee of future price appreciation."

        "title": "What is a spot bitcoin ETF, and how will its SEC approval impact investors? - CBS News",
        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday granted approval to spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, backed by Wall Street, a key regulatory step that will make it easier for ordinary investors to put their money into the digital currency.\n\nThe agency gave the green light to multiple financial firms to offer spot bitcoin ETFs, including asset management giants like BlackRock, Fidelity Investments and Franklin Templeton that cater to retail investors.\n\nUntil now, only bitcoin futures ETFs had SEC approval. Bitcoin prices have shot up on the SEC's approval of the ETFs, more than doubling since last year, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index shows. Prices for the cryptocurrency had already risen 61% since October on expectations that the agency planned to approve spot ETF applications, CoinDesk reported.\n\nHere's what to know about spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWhat's an ETF?\n\nETFs are pooled investments, like a mutual fund, but that trade on stock exchanges like a stock or bond and that track a specific index, sector or asset class such as gold. Unlike traditional mutual funds, they can be bought and sold throughout the day.\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain direct exposure to bitcoin without holding it. Unlike regular bitcoin ETFs, in which bitcoin futures contracts are the underlying asset, bitcoins are the underlying asset of a spot bitcoin ETF. Each spot bitcoin ETF is managed by a firm that issues shares of its own bitcoin holdings purchased through other holders or through an authorized cryptocurrency exchange. The shares are listed on a traditional stock exchange.\n\nWhich ETF applications were approved?\n\nThe SEC has approved the following 11 spot bitcoin ETFs:\n\nBlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF Bitwise Bitcoin ETP Trust WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust VanEck Bitcoin Trust Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund Hashdex Bitcoin ETF Franklin Bitcoin ETF\n\nWhen will spot bitcoin ETFs start trading?\n\nNearly a dozen new bitcoin funds have already begun trading in U.S. markets. Trading began on Thursday, with buying and selling for at least one ETF, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, kicking off as early as 4 a.m. Eastern Time, cryptocurrency trade publication CoinDesk reported.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs vs. buying bitcoin: What's the difference?\n\nInvesting in spot bitcoin ETFs differs from buying bitcoin directly in a few ways.\n\nFirst, investors who put money into bitcoin ETFs do not own any bitcoin outright, Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, told CBS MoneyWatch. Second, financial firms will charge fees for trading and managing a bitcoin ETF. By contrast, people who buy bitcoin directly pay a transaction fee, but there are no costs for managing the investment.\n\nThere are some advantages to owning bitcoin through an ETF. For example, investors can hold and track their bitcoin ETF in the same brokerage account as their other investments.\n\nWhat could be the impact of the SEC approving bitcoin ETFs?\n\nInvestors are betting that the emergence of spot bitcoin ETFs will pump billions of dollars into the digital currency by making it easier and less intimidating to invest.\n\nFirms like BlackRock and Fidelity are household names in financial services, and their move to enter the sector nudges bitcoin further into the mainstream as an investment class while conferring legitimacy to the shadowy and highly volatile crypto industry.\n\n\"A spot Bitcoin ETF marks the end of crypto as a 'novel' asset class and the beginning of a world where it can be part of every portfolio,\" said Nathan McCauley, CEO of Anchorage Digital, a crypto platform provider for financial firms.\n\nAnd as demand for bitcoin rises, so too will its price, likely spurring even more investment and interest in crypto, experts say. Boosting investment in bitcoin, coupled with the introduction of new products from reputable financial players, could also accelerate passage of sensible regulations aimed at eliminating fraud and normalizing crypto as a way to invest, make payments and more generally conduct business.\n\nStrengthening the regulatory framework for crypto is vital, according to Rajeev Bamra, senior vice president of Digital Finance at Moody's Investors Service.\n\n\"Whether this trend will hold depends on the trajectory of global monetary policymaking as well as the availability of cryptocurrencies to institutional investors through products that meet regulatory standards, ensuring their safety and security,\" he said."

However, under more optimistic conditions, Wood believes the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization could surge over 3,000% from current levels and trade at $1.5 million per coin. This revises her previous forecast of $1 million which she gave last year.\n\nWood points to Bitcoin's expanding fundamentals such as rising hash rate, increasing long-term holder reserves, growth in addresses holding BTC, and now the launch of the spot ETF as driving adoption and usage.\n\nThe SEC approval of ETFs backed by actual Bitcoins has been seen as a milestone event by the cryptocurrency industry. At least nine ETFs began trading on US stock exchanges yesterday, sparking immediate enthusiasm. Bitcoin prices shot up 9% in the first hour of trading on Thursday.\n\nARK Invest is one of the issuers licensed to operate a Bitcoin ETF. Wood claims that while the new spot ETFs will engage in intense competition, she expects the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin Trust ETF to emerge as one of the top performers.\n\nAs CEO of the high-profile ARK Innovation ETF, Cathie Wood has attained celebrity-like status in finance circles for her stakes in disruptive tech companies and digital assets like Bitcoin. It is estimated that nearly 25% of her net worth is invested directly in cryptocurrencies, underscoring her measurably positive outlook.\n\nOther forecasters also see a substantial upside in the Bitcoin price, although typically not to the same magnitude as Wood. Earlier this week, analysts at Standard Chartered Bank predicted $200,000 per Bitcoin by 2025 based on comparing the crypto asset's market with the advent of the first gold-backed ETF in 2004.\n\nWhile only time will tell whether Bitcoin reaches a multi-million dollar valuation, Cathie Wood remains an ardent believer in the network's long-term investment thesis. She stated that Bitcoin represents \"a financial super highway\" and \"public good\" that will expand from current levels as adoption continues increasing.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "Spot Bitcoin ETFs Start Trading Today\u2014Here's What You Need To Know - Investopedia",
        "content": "Key Takeaways 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds approved yesterday will start trading today.\n\nThe ETFs will be listed on three different exchanges NYSE Arca, Cboe BZX and Nasdaq.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs will make it easier for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin as they can trade the ETF through their brokerage account.\n\nMultiple bitcoin ETFs hitting the market today sparked a fee war among issuers, with each trying to entice investors with waivers and fee reductions.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ended months of speculation this week by approving the first-ever spot market Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Here's what you need to know about the ETFs that can start trading from Today.\n\n\n\n1) Which new bitcoin ETFs start trading today and where?\n\nThe SEC has approved eleven new ETFs that will be listed on the NYSE Arca, Cboe BZX, and Nasdaq exchanges. The following is a list of the ETFs trading on each exchange and their tickers:\n\nNYSE Arca will list and trade shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), and the Hashdex Bitcoin ETF (DEFI). DEFI currently trades as a bitcoin futures ETF and received approval to convert to a spot product, but Hashdex corrected an initial announcement to clarify that the change in name and investment strategy will occur at a later date.\n\nCboe BZX will list and trade shares of the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO), the VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL), the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW), the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), and the Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC).\n\nNasdaq will list and trade shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR).\n\n2)How does a Bitcoin ETF work?\n\nWhen you buy a share of an ETF, you are buying into a basket of securities that the ETF holds in its portfolio\u2014in this case it's bitcoin. The value of your investment will correlate to the change in bitcoin prices.\n\nUsing BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust as an example, the ETF will be listed on the Nasdaq exchange. Pricing of the ETF will be calculated daily using the CF CME Bitcoin Reference Rate, which \u201caggregates\" the notional value of bitcoin trading across major bitcoin spot exchanges.\n\n3)How can I trade Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nTrading bitcoin in the new ETFs will be easier than buying the cryptocurrency directly on exchanges. Investors can simply buy and sell shares in the new funds via their current brokerage account.\n\nBuying bitcoin (BTCUSD) directly involves the use of a Hot or Cold storage wallet and the requirement to maintain the private and public keys, which are cryptographic strings of letters and numbers required to make crypto transfers from your wallet. The complicated storage and the lack of SEC regulation on the exchanges were seen as a major deterrent to retail and institutional adoption of BTC.\n\n4)Are there fees involved?\n\nTrading in ETFs involves a fee but the imminent approval of a large number of new funds has sparked competition among providers. The new bitcoin investment vehicles will see lower fees and waivers for the first months of trading.\n\nBitwise said it would levy a 0.20% management fee for its spot bitcoin ETF, compared with the 0.37% average for current U.S. ETF products in 2022. VanEck's set its expense ratio at 0.25% while ARK Invest's 21Shares planned 0.21% fees. The world's largest asset manager BlackRock is set to charge 0.25%.\n\n\n\nEarly investors can also benefit as Bitwise said it will waive fees on the first $1 billion invested for the first six months. Ark also announced a fee waiver for six months or the first billion dollars invested whichever occurs first. BlackRock set a waiver period of 12 months or the first $5 billion invested.\n\nCorrection\u2014Jan. 11, 2024: This article was updated to reflect the correction and clarification from Hashdex.\n\n"

        "content": "More than $4 billion of a newly approved investment product tied to Bitcoin changed hands in the first day of trading on Thursday, as cryptocurrency enthusiasts celebrated a watershed moment for the industry.\n\nEleven of the products, known as exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.s, started trading on popular platforms such as the Nasdaq a day after federal regulators authorized them, creating a simpler way for investors to bet on the cryptocurrency markets. Major financial firms, including asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity, are offering the E.T.F.s.\n\nThe early volume was impressive, analysts said, comparing favorably with other E.T.F. debuts. But it may take months to gauge the impact on the cryptocurrency industry, which is still reeling from a recent series of market crashes and high-profile corporate bankruptcies. Initial market data did not show how much new investment flowed into the Bitcoin funds; some of the trading activity may have stemmed from investors who bought shares and quickly flipped them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a one-day event,\u201d said Sandy Kaul, who runs the digital asset arm of Franklin Templeton, a firm offering the E.T.F.s. \u201cSix months is a really good moment to understand: Is this a transformational product?\u201d"

        "content": "Those two were among the first of 11 funds that traded on Thursday after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved rule changes for its exchanges on Wednesday. The group combined for billions of dollars worth of trading volume in the first day.\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) closed up 0.5%, well off its highs of the day, while the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) fell more than 4% after initially rising in morning trading. Both funds saw tens millions of shares traded on Thursday.\n\nBitcoin exchange-traded funds saw big swings on their first day of trading on Thursday, mirroring a volatile day for crypto prices more broadly.\n\nThe Grayscale fund is the biggest of the group, as it was converted from an over-the-counter trust that already had more than $28 billion in assets. The Hashdex fund is currently a bitcoin futures product, and while a rule change to list the fund as a spot bitcoin product was approved, the fund's registration statement to convert the fund is still under review with the SEC.\n\nThe moves for the funds came as bitcoin saw volatile trading. The digital currency briefly hit the $49,000 mark Thursday morning before falling back below $47,000, for a gain of about 1%, according to Coin Metrics. Bitcoin trades around the clock, so the first-day moves for the funds could be affected by the exact timing of their launch.\n\nEven given the heavy trading volumes and swings in bitcoin, there appeared to be no major problems with the ETFs in their first day.\n\n\"Trading today went very well, very orderly,\" said Rachel Aguirre, the U.S. head of iShares product.\n\nETFs are an investment vehicle where investors buy shares that represent a claim on the fund's underlying assets. Some of the most popular ETFs are equity index funds, though other funds in the category track bonds, derivatives products and commodities such as gold.\n\nFinancial advisors and institutional investors often use ETFs because of their liquidity and tax advantages compared to mutual funds. Asset managers are betting that bitcoin ETFs will bring new investors to crypto.\n\n\"This is actually what ETFs were made for \u2014 to take difficult, complex things and make it simple and compliant to trade. This will mainstream the asset class,\" WisdomTree CEO Jonathan Steinberg said on CNBC's \"Money Movers.\"\n\n\"This will allow a less technology-sophisticated investor to buy bitcoin in a way that they are very comfortable with,\" Steinberg added.\n\nInvestors and financial advisors will be watching closely to see not only how the bitcoin ETFs perform, but also how well they track the price of bitcoin. Wide gaps between the price of a fund and the price of the underlying bitcoin that lasts for multiple days could be a sign of thin trading or structural issues with an ETF and scare off potential buyers, even if the fund is temporarily outperforming spot bitcoin.\n\nTrading volume will also be a key metric for investors, as funds with more trading are seen as more efficient, though first-day trading volumes are not always indicative of a fund's future success.\n\n\"We really wanted to see some day one volume, but we also understand that there's a lot of platforms and gatekeepers and advisors and investors who kind of want to let this breathe a little bit and make sure the fund's doing what it's supposed to,\" David Mann, head of ETF product and capital markets for Franklin Templeton, told CNBC. The Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) saw more than 2 million shares change hands on Thursday.\n\nThe success of the funds could also be affected by different price points. Several fund issuers cut their proposed fees just below launch, and many are offering temporary waivers that cut their management fee to 0% in the short run.\n\n\n\nDon't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"

        "content": "Now that regulators have cleared the way, regular investors will have easier access to the most mainstream \u2014 and valuable \u2014 cryptocurrency through bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. The Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s decision Wednesday followed numerous setbacks for the digital assets sector, including several pronounced downturns since 2022 and the successful criminal prosecutions of two of the industry\u2019s biggest players \u2014 Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of crypto exchange FTX, and his rival, Changpeng Zhao of Binance.\n\nBut the move, approved in a 3-2 vote, fell well short of a ringing endorsement. In a social media post on Tuesday ahead of the vote, SEC Chair Gary Gensler cautioned, \u201cCrypto asset securities may be marketed as new opportunities but there are serious risks involved.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWhat is bitcoin?\n\nFirst introduced in 2009, bitcoin is the oldest cryptocurrency, a type of monetary asset that can be exchanged anonymously. Over the past decade, bitcoin has continued to be the most popular and stable cryptocurrency, rising to a peak of about $64,000 per coin in November 2021. After crashing along with other crypto assets in 2022, bitcoin has since rebounded. On Thursday morning, its value sat above $47,000 per coin, its price buoyed by the SEC\u2019s announcement.\n\nWhat is an ETF, and what is a bitcoin ETF?\n\nETF stands for \u201cexchange-traded fund,\u201d which is very much like a mutual fund but can be traded like stocks on financial markets. Some ETFs peg their value to the performance of the S&P 500 index, while others rise and fall with the value of more specific assets and investments, such as stocks, bonds, commodities \u2014 and now bitcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe value of bitcoin ETFs is tethered to the price of their namesake currency. Asset managers will now be able to sell them to regular consumers, further incorporating bitcoin into the mainstream.\n\nPreviously, buying bitcoin and other crypto was more complicated: Investors had to go through cryptocurrency trading firms such as Coinbase that charged transaction fees. Now, retail investors will be able to buy the bitcoin ETFs in the same way they might acquire a public company\u2019s stock or a mutual fund.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nWhy did the SEC approve bitcoin ETFs?\n\nThe regulator maintains that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are extremely risky, and it has been wary of approving bitcoin ETFs. But Gensler said in a statement Wednesday that a court case essentially forced its hand.\n\nLast year, a federal court ruled that the SEC had not sufficiently explained its reasons for rejecting an application to list a bitcoin ETF by crypto asset manager Grayscale. The agency\u2019s decision came in response to that ruling, Gensler said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhile we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin ETP [exchange-traded product] shares today, we did not approve or endorse bitcoin,\u201d Gensler said, using the agency\u2019s preferred term for the bitcoin ETF. \u201cInvestors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.\u201d\n\nWhy does the SEC view bitcoin ETFs as risky?\n\nAll crypto currencies, including bitcoin, are extremely speculative and volatile. After the FTX crypto exchange filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, the price of bitcoin plunged to roughly $16,000 in a month and a half, compared with its peak of about $64,000 in 2021. Multiple crypto banks and exchanges collapsed in 2022, and many investors were wiped out.\n\nMoreover, the industry is still rife with scams, and bitcoin is regularly used by criminals to move money without being blocked by governments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a dissenting opinion, SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw said she was deeply \u201cconcerned that these products will flood the markets and land squarely in the retirement accounts of U.S. households who can least afford to lose their savings to the fraud and manipulation that appears prevalent in the spot bitcoin markets and will impact the [bitcoin ETF\u2019s].\u201d\n\nWhich firms are selling the ETFs?\n\nEleven firms won approval to issue the ETFs. They include traditional asset managers Fidelity and Invesco, as well as crypto-focused Grayscale Investments, Valkyrie Funds and Hashdex.\n\nWhen do the ETFs start trading?\n\nThe ETFs started trading Thursday, according to Reuters. Those included BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund, and ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF."

        "content": "Bitcoin, as of Thursday morning, was up more than 5% over the past 24 hours, to about $47,600, after the Securities and Exchange Commission said in a filing on Wednesday that it had approved 11 applications to create the first generation of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. The second-most-popular cryptocurrency, Ether, was up double digits, with a 10% rally pushing it above $2,600.\n\nWednesday\u2019s approval comes after hackers took over the regulator\u2019s X/Twitter account on Tuesday and sent a fake post announcing the approval of the pending spot Bitcoin applications. The fake-out spurred a flurry of excited tweets before SEC Chairman Gary Gensler alerted potential investors to the hack, a correction that led to myriad memes and ridicule of the agency online.\n\nSimilar fears spread briefly on Wednesday after the SEC\u2019s filing announcing the approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETF applications disappeared from the agency\u2019s website before reappearing. This time, Gensler confirmed the approval with a statement that said approving spot Bitcoin ETFs was the \u201cmost sustainable path forward,\u201d but did not guarantee financial products dealing with other cryptocurrencies would be approved. In a 3-to-2 vote, Gensler, a Democrat, sided with two Republican SEC commissioners in favor of approving the Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nA new chapter\n\nHope ran high among some analysts and market onlookers who said they believe spot Bitcoin ETFs will usher in a new era for Bitcoin.\n\nMark Connors, head of research at investment fund manager 3iQ, said although it may take months for some investment advisors to start bringing client money to Bitcoin, other pools of money could quickly create $2.5 billion to $3 billion of inflows after the ETFs start trading on Thursday.

This is truly\n\na historic day for crypto.

Already, BlackRock\u2019s ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust, had garnered $2 million of shares traded early Thursday, although those shares may have been sold before the ETF was approved, according to an X post by Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.\n\nStill, market onlookers, including British bank Standard Chartered, predicted that the new spot Bitcoin ETFs could help funnel $1 billion to Bitcoin over the next three months\u2014and $100 billion by the end of the year.\n\nAlready, the dozen or so companies vying for a spot Bitcoin ETF have begun to compete on fees, with several of the issuers dropping theirs to between 0.24% and 3% to attract customers. The average fee for a U.S. ETF is about 0.54%, according to Reuters. For comparison, the $27 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which also lets investors put money into Bitcoin, has a fee of 2%, although it plans to cut it to 1.5% for its spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nProminent finance figures have already started rallying support for spot Bitcoin ETFs, including Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, who said in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Wednesday that although her firm\u2019s ETF may not see \u201covernight success,\u201d she expects institutional dollars to come around after TradFi firms work through the due diligence process.\n\nWood said the firm\u2019s ETF will look to attract both institutional and retail investors.\n\n\u201cThe interest is far and wide,\u201d she said."

        "content": "Chesnot | Getty Images\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission just approved the first-ever batch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds to come out of the U.S. The agency gave the green light on Wednesday to sponsors of 10 ETFs, including BlackRock, Invesco, Fidelity, Grayscale, and Ark Invest \u2014 paving the way for these funds to begin trading as soon as this week. The move was largely expected, even after a social media hacking snag. A false statement saying the regulator had approved a bitcoin ETF was published Tuesday on the SEC's social media account on X, formerly known as Twitter. The agency later clarified that its account had been compromised. The actual approval Wednesday marked a massive step for the cryptocurrency, as it will give investors increased ways to gain exposure to the token \u2014 not just from holding it directly, but via existing financial instruments that trade on a regulated stock exchange.\n\nwatch now\n\nBut what does that all mean exactly, and how does it affect investors? CNBC runs through everything you need to know about the bitcoin ETF milestone.\n\nWhat's a bitcoin ETF?\n\nAn ETF is an investment fund that tracks the performance of an underlying asset. That could be stocks, a basket of currencies, a precious metal like gold, or, in this case, bitcoin. It's a way for investors to get exposure to the value of the underlying asset without directly owning it. ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges, and their value should rise when the underlying asset increases in price, or fall if it decreases. As crypto investors look to assess what the market impact of a bitcoin ETF might be, many are comparing Wednesday's news to the greenlighting of the SPDR Gold Shares ETF \u2014 the first-ever spot gold ETF \u2014 in 2004. The total gold market capitalization was worth around $1 trillion to $2 trillion before the gold ETF was approved, and this subsequently ballooned to $16 trillion in a few years after, according to Vijay Ayyar, vice president of international markets for Indian crypto exchange CoinDCX. \"Bitcoin's adoption will be much faster and bigger than that,\" Ayyar told CNBC via WhatsApp.\n\nwatch now\n\nAyyar said the story for bitcoin and crypto will \"accelerate\" in 2024, as the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF could spark interest from retail investors who were previously sitting on the sidelines.\n\nWhat does a bitcoin ETF mean for investors?\n\nA bitcoin ETF opens up the audience of people and institutions that can buy and sell bitcoin to those with little experience trading cryptocurrency. \"This ETF has two main impacts: increased distribution in the US (a moderate impact, as there have been ETFs outside of the US for years) and increased credibility of crypto as an 'asset class' (a very high impact),\" Kevin de Patoul, co-founder and CEO of crypto liquidity provider Keyrock, told CNBC. \"There is now a U.S. bitcoin spot ETF, and bitcoin is no longer considered shady or infamous. This significantly changes the perception for the mainstream public.\" It also means that bitcoin could start appearing in mainstream portfolios, where many more retail investors can gain exposure. Big institutional fund managers can add it to their investment funds. Retirement planners can now include it in employer-sponsored 401(k) plans. This makes it much easier to own bitcoin, as you don't have to rely on a vulnerable piece of hardware for storage. Investors don't need to tackle the difference between \"hot\" and \"cold\" wallets, which store digital tokens. Instead, they can just buy an ETF from one of the many regulated asset managers that are set to go live with their own ETFs.\n\nwatch now"

        "content": "Bitcoin slid on Friday to end an otherwise momentous week for the cryptocurrency, with the launch of 11 bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S. after a yearslong battle for institutional acceptance of the asset.\n\nThe price of bitcoin dropped 5.79% to $43,830.28, according to Coin Metrics, giving back gains from earlier this week and pulling most of the crypto market into the red. On Thursday, it briefly surged to $49,058.48, its highest level since December 2021. For the week, it finished slightly lower by 0.01%.\n\nMeanwhile, ether slipped -1.02%, trimming earlier gains. It rose 15% for the week, its first winning week in three and its best week since March 2023. Investors rotated into ether and out of bitcoin following the widely expected U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approval of bitcoin ETFs. On Thursday it reached highs not seen since May 2022.\n\n\"In our view, the crypto market has already moved to the next narrative, with ETH rallying more than bitcoin, likely on the expectation that crypto's second largest token could also see an ETF approval,\" Alex Saunders, an analyst at Citi, said in a note Friday."

        "content": "Shortly before the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Wednesday night, it reissued a \"no FOMO\" warning to investors.\n\nThe warning not to invest over \u201cfear of missing out\u201d emphasized the volatility of digital assets, noting how trendy cryptocurrency investments go through extreme highs and lows, representing billions of dollars in gains \u2014 and losses.\n\n#SECInvestingResolution 5: Say \u201cNO GO to FOMO\u201d (fear of missing out). Just because others might buy a particular investment, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the right opportunity for you. Learn more about finding out what\u2019s right for you and your investing goals: https://t.co/fixDWoNFrF pic.twitter.com/SGf1z6xmhL \u2014 SEC Investor Ed (@SEC_Investor_Ed) January 6, 2024\n\nEven after Wednesday\u2019s announcement, SEC chair Gary Gensler said in a statement that despite the approval of the ETF listing, \"we did not approve or endorse bitcoin.\"\n\nThe SEC\u2019s blessing brings industry standardization and regulation to digital asset investing. But financial experts urge caution, warning mainstream investors to tread carefully as bitcoin (BTC-USD) is still considered a speculative asset.\n\n\"From a very conservative financial perspective, you have to be very careful,\" Kiran Garimella, assistant professor at the University of South Florida Muma College of Business, told Yahoo Finance. \"If the financial instrument that's being traded doesn't actually represent anything of specific value underlying it, then you'd have to sit back and question that.\"\n\nBut first, what exactly is a spot bitcoin ETF?\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs are investment vehicles that track the performance of bitcoin. Investors purchase shares of the fund, which is managed by asset managers who hold the actual bitcoin and its immediate value (\u201cspot\u201d) as the underlying asset. Those managers make money on management fees and on the slim margin between the actual price of bitcoins (which fluctuates) and the price at which they sell the shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the value of the ETFs will move in tandem with bitcoin, the funds may be more stable as fund managers can utilize different financial instruments within the fund to soften the volatility.\n\n\u201cAn ETF not only makes it much easier to buy and sell and trade these bitcoins, it could also cover some of the strategic risk for you,\u201d Garimella said.\n\nThe world\u2019s first bitcoin originated in 2008 and is credited to a still-unknown person who used the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It was formed based on a free market, decentralized ideology where digital currencies are created, distributed, traded, and stored in a peer-to-peer ledger known as the blockchain.\n\nBitcoin's price has recently hovered around $46,500, surging to $49,000 at one point last week as reactions to the SEC approval played out. The value of a coin peaked at an all-time high in 2021 when the price surpassed $65,000. But it crashed to around $16,000 just 12 months later, as investors slowly lost confidence in the sector.\n\nShould bitcoin ETFs be part of your portfolio?\n\nThe highly anticipated SEC approval means that everyday investors can now own bitcoin in their investment or retirement accounts without having to buy digital tokens directly from a crypto exchange.\n\nThe crypto world is still opaque and out of reach to many Americans, but the 11 new spot funds are listed across the NYSE, CBOE, and Nasdaq \u2014 the same platforms where stocks, ETFs, and other traditional securities are bought and sold.\n\nGarimella said the new funds dramatically reduce the administrative risks of investing in bitcoin. Before, interested investors had to open up a \"wallet\" and use \"private keys\" just to own the tokens. Crypto exchanges themselves also carried risks, including hacking and fraud.\n\n\"Oh, boy, you'd have to go through hoops just to acquire a fraction of a bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency for that matter,\" Garimella said. \"Most people had no clue what a wallet or private key is.\"\n\nEven now, only the funds are standardized; a strategic risk is still associated with investing in a bitcoin fund.\n\n\"It's great if you can pull it off by investing in it at $5, sell it for $500, and make a lot of money,\u201d Garimella said. \"But can you be consistent and systematic, and can you come up with a strategy to capitalize on the value generated by that?\"\n\nBroad skepticism remains about crypto in general and its speculative nature. With such instruments, there is no intrinsic value backing the digital asset, only investors\u2019 belief that its price will go up.\n\n\"Cryptocurrency seems like speculation that central banking will be replaced \u2014 that maybe the US dollar is going to be replaced as the dominant reserve currency,\" Mark Higgins, CFA, CFP, and author of \"Investing in US Financial History,\" told Yahoo Finance. \"I am skeptical.\"\n\nThe Vanguard Group, the second-largest provider of ETFs, announced it has no plans to launch a spot bitcoin ETF or offer any crypto-related products.\n\n\"Our perspective is that these products do not align with our offer focused on asset classes such as equities, bonds, and cash, which Vanguard views as the building blocks of a well-balanced, long-term investment portfolio,\" the company said.\n\nOn the other side, Fidelity Investment, one of the world\u2019s largest asset managers, launched its Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) on Thursday, calling the product an efficient way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve long believed a spot-priced exchange-traded product would be an efficient way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin,\u201d Cynthia Lo Bessette, head of digital asset management at Fidelity, said in a statement.\n\nYet, in a sign of how uncharted this territory is, Fidelity is requiring investors to execute its Designated Investment Agreement (DIA) when placing an order for the FBTC fund. The DIA certifies that the investors are experienced, have high risk tolerance, and can afford to lose some or all of their investment in the digital product.\n\nEleven of the largest financial asset managers in the world launched a Bitcoin ETF. (Chesnot/Getty Images) (Chesnot via Getty Images)\n\nStill, these ETFs could be a safer way to own bitcoins because asset managers can reduce the funds' risk through sophisticated tactics such as opening up futures contracts, hedging, putting in call options, and improving laddering strategy.\n\n\"When you have an ETF that does all of that stuff, it introduces a certain level of stability or risk management to that underlying instrument,\" Garimella said. \"In a crypto market, you're exposing yourself to a certain level of risk, which could be minimized with the right ETF.\"\n\nThe biggest appeal of bitcoin, the world\u2019s best-known cryptocurrency, is perhaps blockchains' future potential. The technology could transform monetary transactions, its backers believe. Personally, Garimella said he owns bitcoin from an educational perspective and may put more money into an ETF because the digital coin could link to a tangible asset class in the future, given the innovation in the space.\n\n\"But would I advise my grandmother to invest in it? Probably not,\" Garimella said.\n\nWhere to purchase ETFs and what fees to expect\n\nInvestors interested in diversifying their portfolio with digital assets can purchase shares in spot bitcoin ETFs through their brokerage accounts. The funds will be listed similarly to other funds and can be traded throughout the day for liquidity. The approved ETFs are fund products from big financial players such as Fidelity, Invesco, and BlackRock.\n\nSEC chair Gary Gensler said in a statement that despite the approval of the ETF listing, \"we did not approve or endorse bitcoin.\" (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) (Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images)\n\nMany firms have announced their fees for managing the ETFs. Blackrock (BLK), the world's largest asset manager with nearly $10 trillion in managed assets, is charging investors 0.25%, a decline from the 0.30% it previously set. Grayscale is charging 1.5%, while Franklin said it would waive management fees through August, a sign of how competitive this new market is.\n\nToday, bitcoin remains the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization \u2014 $913 billion as of Jan. 11.\n\nRebecca Chen is a reporter for Yahoo Finance and previously worked as an investment tax certified public accountant (CPA).\n\nClick here for the latest personal finance news to help you with investing, paying off debt, buying a home, retirement, and more\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "content": "Gary Gensler, chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), during an interview in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, July 27, 2023.\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler's statement on why the agency has approved the listing and trading of a group of spot bitcoin ETFs indicates that he is still hostile to the cryptocurrency in general.\n\nGensler was faced with the difficult task of explaining why the SEC has reversed its position on bitcoin ETFs. He said that circumstances \"have changed.\"\n\nThey changed because the SEC lost a key court case last August: The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit held that the commission failed to adequately explain its reasoning when it turned down Grayscale's proposed bitcoin ETF.\n\nGensler was forced to give in, but not on all fronts.\n\nFor starters, he is engaged in several ongoing legal battles with the crypto community. In large part, the conflicts are based on his claim that most crypto assets are securities that come under the purview of the SEC.\n\nIn his statement, Gensler gave no indication he was changing his approach on this topic:\n\n\"Nor does the approval signal anything about the Commission's views as to the status of other crypto assets under the federal securities laws or about the current state of non-compliance of certain crypto asset market participants with the federal securities laws. As I've said in the past, and without prejudging any one crypto asset, the vast majority of crypto assets are investment contracts and thus subject to the federal securities laws.\"\n\nWill bitcoin ETFs make Wall Street \u2014 wirehouses and financial advisors \u2014 more willing to recommend the cryptocurrency to clients and allow it to trade on their platforms?\n\nPossibly, but Gensler made it clear that broker-dealers will have to adhere to existing rules:\n\n\"Further, existing rules and standards of conduct will apply to the purchase and sale of the approved [exchange traded products]. This includes, for example, Regulation Best Interest when broker-dealers recommend ETPs to retail investors, as well as a fiduciary duty under the Investment Advisers Act for investment advisers.\"\n\nRegulation Best Interest requires broker-dealers to act in the best interest of their retail customers when making investment recommendations. These recommendations must be \"suitable\" for the client.\n\nThat is a potential investment minefield for investment advisors, and it's likely to keep many advisors away from recommending bitcoin for some time.\n\nFinally, Gensler couldn't help taking a parting shot at bitcoin in general:\n\n\"Though we're merit neutral, I'd note that the underlying assets in the metals ETPs have consumer and industrial uses, while in contrast bitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset that's also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion, and terrorist financing. While we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse bitcoin.\""

        "title": "Crypto bulls see bitcoin flying above $100,000 after ETF approval - CNBC",
        "content": "Chesnot | Getty Images\n\nCryptocurrency bulls say bitcoin could surge to more than $100,000 this year after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission made a pivotal step to approve the first-ever U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund. Several crypto investors CNBC spoke with said they see the world's top cryptocurrency rising in 2024, as the effects of approval of a bitcoin ETF, which would diversify the range of investors that can gain exposure to the cryptocurrency, begin to become more apparent. Bitcoin's price hasn't moved a great deal since the news of the SEC ETF approval came in, which saw the agency give 11 products the green light. The regulator approved rule changes to allow the creation of the ETFs, but stressed that this move \"should in no way signal the Commission's willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities.\" Prices reacted to that substantially since the SEC's move Wednesday. Bitcoin's price was trading at $46,118 apiece Friday, down around 0.4%. It briefly topped $49,000 to levels not seen since December 2021. Over time, though, ETFs, coupled with other developments in the crypto world, are expected to drive major upward movements in bitcoin.\n\nWhat's a bitcoin ETF?\n\nETFs allow more retail investors to hold bitcoin indirectly via a share traded on a stock exchange. Investors expect acceptance of the token could begin to become more mainstream with more and more institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and others offering these products. Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital, said he's been increasing his exposure to bitcoin, ethereum, solana and other cryptocurrencies over the past year.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"I think this is a really big breakthrough for bitcoin as a digital asset, it's a much broader story for digital property in general,\" Scaramucci told CNBC's Arjun Kharpal at the CfC conference in St Moritz.\n\n\"I think bitcoin will probably see its all-time high at the end of the year, and is likely to go through its all-time high by the end of the year.\" As for what price Scaramucci expects for bitcoin, the noted investor said he sees the cryptocurrency hitting $100,000 over the next year. \"Could bitcoin be $100,000, which is more or a little bit more than a double over the next year? I do believe that.\" But he made a caveat: \"I have been wrong so many times before.\"\n\nHe compared the token's ETF approval to the 2004 green lighting of the first spot gold ETF. That development took years to translate into major price gains, but gold eventually skyrocketed in value. The precious metal is now worth around $1,592.76, up around 556% since 2004 when the SPDR Gold Shares ETF began trading. Crypto bulls expect a similar direction of travel for bitcoin \u2014 except it'll be much quicker this time around.\n\n\"We see it as digital gold,\" Scaramucci told CNBC. \"If you look at the market cap of gold, $13 trillion, there's no reason why bitcoin couldn't be 50% or 60% of that market capitalization. So that implies a 10x price over then next decade.\" Many crypto investors have compared bitcoin with gold in the past. But it's worth noting that, while backers believe they have similar qualities \u2014 like a finite supply and immunity to external economic and geopolitical headwinds \u2014 bitcoin hasn't exactly passed the mark as \"digital gold.\" Past price performance over the past few years has shown bitcoin trades in correlation with stocks, in particular the tech-heavy Nasdaq, rather than gold. Bitcoin did massively outperform the Nasdaq in 2023, many other risk-assets, and gold in 2023. But the cryptocurrency primarily got a boost from speculation that the Federal Reserve would dial back its aggressive interest rate rises, which would be supportive for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Vijay Ayyar, vice president of international for Indian crypto exchange CoinDCX, said ETF approvals had been \"priced in for some time now.\" Bitcoin's already gone from about $25,000 to nearly $47,000 since October. \"The next leg up is when we start seeing Bitcoin purchases for the ETF itself,\" Ayyar said. That could happen in the next week or two.\" \"If sentiment is to be believed, we are potentially looking at an accelerated move to new all-time highs some time this year, given we also have the Bitcoin halving coming up in April this year,\" Ayyar added.\n\n2023 was bitcoin's turnaround year\n\nIf bitcoin were to reach those levels, it would mark a turnaround for an industry that's been in the doldrums since the collapse of FTX, the once $32 billion crypto exchange, in 2022. FTX's founder Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty of all seven criminal counts brought against him by federal prosecutors in the U.S. last year.\n\nwatch now\n\nIn 2022, bitcoin was already falling sharply, with sky-high inflation and higher interest rates knocking prices of digital currencies across the board. But FTX's collapse caused deep distrust in the crypto industry among consumers, business players in the industry and regulators, as one of the largest names in the field was exposed for using assets it held on behalf of customers to make risky trades in other crypto assets and risky crypto-linked derivatives. The crypto market saw a little over $2 trillion erased from its market capitalization, as investors got cold feet and abandoned digital tokens en masse. In 2023, however, it was a different story. Bitcoin's price rose more than doubled for the year, with the token's price climbing some 152%. Other digital tokens also saw price gains. Ether roughly doubled in price, and XRP, solana, and ada also made strong gains. \"2022 was the worst year for us [but] 2023 happened to be the best year for us. So it's been the best and worst of times,\" Scaramucci said. Also in 2023, Binance CEO and founder Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to criminal charges and stepped down as the company's CEO as part of a $4.3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice. Many crypto investors see this as a chance to move forward and draw a line under bad behavior in the industry. Industry executives are calling the start of another bull run. They say that, on top of the approval of a bitcoin ETF, the bitcoin \"halving\" is a factor that will drive gains in 2024. The halving, which happens every four years, is an event written in bitcoin's code. The rewards so-called miners get for mining bitcoin is cut in half. This keeps a cap on the supply of bitcoin, of which there will only ever be 21 million. In previous price cycles, halving preceded a rise in the price of bitcoin.\n\n$250,000 by July?\n\nTim Draper, founder of Draper Associates, believes the bitcoin halving \u2014 along with other factors \u2014 could spur the price of bitcoin to hit $250,000 by July. The billionaire investor said he sees increased bitcoin adoption among mainstream investors and the token's much-anticipated halving event driving it to a new all-time high.\n\nwatch now"

        "content": "Key Takeaways Spot bitcoin ETFs had their first day of trading in the U.S. on Thursday.\n\nWhile there are currently 10 different spot bitcoin ETFs on the market, Grayscale's GBTC accounted for more than half of all of Thursday's trading volume for these financial products.\n\nAccording to one analyst, GBTC's current dominance may be due to investors selling that particular offering for one of the new alternatives.\n\nDespite the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), some major financial institutions are declining to offer these products to their clients.\n\nOn the first day of spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) trading, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which is a converted version of an already-existing financial product, dominated the competition. That said, there is reason to believe this could be a temporary phenomenon.\n\nGrayscale Takes the Early Lead, But It May Not Last\n\nThere was more than $4.6 billion worth of trading volume in spot bitcoin ETFs on U.S. exchanges on Thursday, which was the first day the newly approved financial products were allowed to be traded.\n\nTrading volume does not necessarily mean money flowing into these products. Why is that? More than half of the trading involved GBTC; however, this could be a temporary trend caused by GBTC holders selling their holdings in favor of alternative options, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart.\n\nWhen GBTC is removed, spot bitcoin ETF offerings from Blackrock (BLK) and Fidelity are the other major players in terms of volume, with Blackrock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) seeing more than $1 billion in trading volume on the day. Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin fund (FBTC) saw greater than $700 million in volume.\n\nWhen combined, the offerings from Grayscale, Blackrock, and Fidelity accounted for roughly 87% of the total spot bitcoin ETF trading volume today.\n\nThere are currently 10 different spot bitcoin ETF products approved for trading in the U.S. Hashdex's Bitcoin ETF (DEFI) that received approval to convert from a bitcoin futures ETF to a spot product clarified Thursday that it didn't hold a spot position yet. It will change its name and investment strategy at a later date.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, Galaxy Investment Partners CEO Michael Novogratz shared his view that the battle for spot bitcoin ETF dominance will be between Blackrock, Fidelity, and Invesco, despite the early centralization of activity around GBTC.\n\nVanguard Stays on the Sidelines, UBS Approaches With Caution\n\nWhile yesterday's official regulatory approval of spot bitcoin ETFs by the SEC was viewed by many as a landmark moment for the crypto asset from both a regulatory and institutional perspective. Brokerage clients of Fidelity and Charles Schwab (SCHW) have access to the spot bitcoin ETFs but there are still some major financial firms that are limiting their customers' access to this new product.\n\n\"While we continuously evaluate our brokerage offer and evaluate new product entries to the market, spot Bitcoin ETFs will not be available for purchase on the Vanguard platform,\" said a Vanguard spokesperson in a statement. \"We also have no plans to offer Vanguard Bitcoin ETFs or other crypto-related products. Our perspective is that these products do not align with our offer focused on asset classes such as equities, bonds, and cash, which Vanguard views as the building blocks of a well-balanced, long-term investment portfolio.\"\n\nOther firms took a more measured approach. A source close to UBS (UBS) said that the company is allowing its clients access to \"more than half\" but not all of the spot bitcoin ETFs available.\n\nWhile it is unclear which ETFs are available to UBS customers, trades will be allowed only if certain conditions are met. Those include trades that are unsolicited (initiated by the client and not sought by the advisor), made from a brokerage account as opposed to an advisory account and in line with the client's risk tolerance, among other factors."

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission finally yielded to the inevitable on Wednesday, allowing 11 companies to package Bitcoin as shares and letting investors buy stock in the cryptocurrency just as they would shares of Apple or Tesla. Crypto billionaire Michael Saylor marked the moment by saying \u201cTomorrow Bitcoin Goes Public,\u201d and that description sounds about right.\n\nSince the first batches of Bitcoins arrived in 2009\u2014way back when the blockchain spit out 50 Bitcoins every 10 minutes\u2014the cryptocurrency has been treated by many as something disreputable. This has especially been the case in Washington, D.C., and, until recently, on Wall Street, where bankers liked to sneer at it. Now, though, financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity will be using their new ETFs as a vehicle to distribute Bitcoin to their many clients, who will in turn start including it in retail investors\u2019 pension and retirement funds. This will only increase mainstream support for Bitcoin and help turn many remaining detractors into allies.\n\nI\u2019m hardly the only one to hold the thesis that the long-term case for Bitcoin is bullish, and I\u2019m confident it will be proved right in the next five years. The harder thing to predict is what happens in the short term. A quick look at the market confirms the popular crypto wisdom that any price jump from the ETF approval was largely baked in. The thing to watch now is whether the flood of new Bitcoin ETF shares, which will begin trading as soon as today, are snapped up or\u2014as is very possible\u2014if demand turns out to be muted and the currency slumps. A further wildcard is if the impending Bitcoin \u201chalving,\u201d which will cut the supply of new coins per block from six to three, will deliver an additional fillip for demand or if that too is baked in. No matter what happens in the next few months, though, it does not change the long-term bull case.\n\nThe other thing to watch in the coming days is which of the Bitcoin ETF issuers gobbles up the biggest market share\u2014history shows new ETFs are a winner-take-all business\u2014and which firms just spent months on expensive legal paperwork to get 1% or 2% of the market. Meanwhile, a related and more interesting question is how long it takes for the SEC to approve an Ethereum ETF, which is also only a matter of time. And beyond that, will the likes of XRP and Dogecoin also get the coveted stamp of respectability that comes with an ETF wrapper? The answer could be years or never.\n\nFinally, there is the matter of the SEC\u2019s colossal screwup on Tuesday, which saw a hacker take over the agency\u2019s X/Twitter account because it had failed to implement a basic security feature. This has already diminished Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s rapidly diminishing political clout, but also poses a fun mystery. As Matt Levine noted, a seasoned financial criminal could have used the compromised SEC account to come up with a more lucrative scheme than publishing a fake announcement about news that was already expected and priced in.\n\nGo ahead and put on your criminal mastermind hat for a moment and think of how you could make the most money with the SEC\u2019s Twitter account. Maybe announce a criminal investigation of Apple while shorting the stock? You get the point. Fortunately, the hacker (who is in huge trouble if caught) didn\u2019t do anything of the sort, suggesting that Levine may be right that the whole point was to troll the hell out of Gensler. Chalk it up to yet another colorful moment in a crypto history full of them.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nThe SEC stated the FBI is helping investigate who is responsible for Tuesday's social media hack.

        "title": "Bitcoin's Wall Street takeover frustrates crypto's true believers - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nThe price of bitcoin soared to its highest level in more than two years this week, as speculators bet that the first approved stock market funds for cryptocurrencies would open the door to a wave of new investors.\n\nBut some enthusiasts say the Wall Street takeover betrays their vision of crypto as an alternative financial system away from the prying eyes of government and mainstream finance, and cements bitcoin\u2019s status as merely a vehicle for speculation.\n\n\u201cThe founding principles of bitcoin and decentralised currency is really this cypherpunk, going against the grain, going against the big institutions,\u201d said Xavier Nukajam, a crypto start-up founder from the UK. \u201cIf you create this alternative and have to submit to what already exists . . . you\u2019ve failed.\u201d\n\nThat submission was underlined this week by the fanfare around the launch of bitcoin exchange traded funds, after more than 10 years of applications rejected by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe funds enable investors to own bitcoin via a regulated vehicle listed on the stock market, without directly holding the cryptocurrency itself. They are managed by established Wall Street giants including BlackRock, Invesco and Fidelity \u2014 a far cry from largely unregulated exchanges such as the collapsed FTX and Binance, which was fined $4.3bn by US authorities last month for money-laundering and violating international sanctions.\n\nThe ETFs, which trade on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and CBOE Global Markets, racked up a collective $4.37bn of trading volume on their first day alone, according to CCData.\n\nFranklin Templeton, the asset manager, tried to underline its newfound crypto credentials by turning the eyes of Founding Father Benjamin Franklin in its logo into red lasers on social media \u2014 aping a popular meme denoting enthusiasm for bitcoin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the end of a very long journey,\u201d said Jean-Marie Mognetti, chief executive of asset manager Coinshares. \u201cBitcoin has graduated with distinction and is recognised as an investable asset class.\u201d\n\nBitcoin has travelled a long way since its invention by Satoshi Nakamoto \u2014 whose true identity has never been revealed \u2014 in 2008. His famous \u201cwhite paper\u201d described a payments system that stood apart from mainstream financial institutions, instead relying on the public record of blockchain technology.\n\nHe and his early adherents championed the countercultural ethos of \u201ccypherpunk\u201d, with its emphasis on the power of cryptography to protect an individual\u2019s privacy from the long arm of the state.\n\nHowever, that vision has struggled to get real-world traction. Bitcoin\u2019s use as a widespread tool for payments has been limited because it is too cumbersome and slow to verify transactions. El Salvador made bitcoin legal tender in 2021, but consumers there have mostly shunned it.\n\nIts finite supply \u2014 the code that governs bitcoin allows only 21mn tokens ultimately to be created \u2014 led many to tout it as a hedge against inflation and the debasement of mainstream \u201cfiat\u201d currencies. That narrative took a hit last year when global inflation soared but the price of bitcoin tumbled.\n\nToday, such uses for bitcoin are mentioned more rarely. But its status as a speculative asset, albeit a highly volatile one, has been bolstered by its recent rebound and underlined by this week\u2019s fund launches.\n\nThe excitement surrounding bitcoin ETFs \u201cjust exposes how hollow the bitcoin narrative always was\u201d, said Hilary Allen, professor of law at American University Washington College of Law. \u201cAnyone who knew anything about economics or finance could have told you from day one bitcoin was never going to work as a payment system.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople have been in this to make a quick buck and having \u2018number go up\u2019,\u201d Allen added, referring to a popular boast among crypto devotees about their market gains.\n\nUS regulators, nervous of the scandals that have plagued the crypto world in recent years, seem inclined to agree.\n\nAlthough the SEC approved the ETFs, chair Gary Gensler was keen to stress that the agency had been pushed into its decision by a US federal appeals court ruling last summer. \u201cWe did not approve bitcoin,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that underlying assets in other ETFs, such as metals, had consumer and industrial uses. \u201cBitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset that\u2019s also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion and terrorist financing.\u201d\n\nFellow SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, who dissented from the approval, warned that spot markets remained open to fraud and manipulation.\n\nStill, some in the industry see a newfound respectability for bitcoin, whose price has soared nearly 1,300 per cent over the past five years, far outstripping other assets.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of the libertarian vision was frauds and the shitcoins,\u201d Andrew Bond, senior research analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, referring to smaller cryptocurrencies often launched to make a quick profit for their founders. \u201cIf you look at where there\u2019s been regulatory action, where there\u2019s been problems with the crypto space, it hasn\u2019t been bitcoin.\u201d\n\nCrypto advocates are hoping that the ETFs will boost the bitcoin price because the issuers will be required to buy the token on behalf of their customers. The coins will be held at a custodian, and the issuer will create and redeem shares to represent the owners\u2019 share of the pool.\n\nJad Comair, founder of digital asset investor Melanion Capital, bought his first bitcoin in 2013. \u201cYou had all these technological hurdles,\u201d he said. \u201cI was really worried about losing my phone and as a result losing my bitcoin forever. Now, you\u2019re in the hands of the biggest players in finance like BlackRock and Fidelity, and you know they\u2019re going to take all the necessary measures to safeguard people\u2019s assets.\u201d\n\nThe greatest impact may yet be on the crypto exchanges which have been the only option for people who want to hold bitcoin for the long term.\n\n\u201cThere will now be a bifurcated market in crypto,\u201d said Alison Jimenez, president of Dynamic Securities Analytics, a securities litigation consultancy. \u201cThose that still want to trade crypto will still go to these exchanges. Those that want to hold bitcoin as an investment will just take the simpler and more straightforward ETF route.\u201d\n\nFor some, the introduction of regulated third parties like custodians, exchanges, asset managers and market makers is an example of another emblem of a counterculture that became commoditised by mainstream finance.\n\nJames Angel, associate professor at Georgetown University, pointed out that alcohol and cannabis had once been illegal but have since become traded assets.\n\n\u201cIn the same way, bitcoin was seen as an outlaw outside of the respectable space of investments, and now it\u2019s taking its place in the old boys\u2019 club,\u201d he said. \u201cWall Street is really good at selling stuff, they\u2019ll sell anything they can make a buck on.\u201d"

We also have no plans to offer Vanguard Bitcoin ETFs or other crypto-related products,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Our perspective is that these products do not align with our offer focused on asset classes such as equities, bonds, and cash, which Vanguard views as the building blocks of a well-balanced, long-term investment portfolio,\" the statement continued.\n\nVanguard is one of two dominant players in the U.S. ETF market. Its chief rival BlackRock has entered the bitcoin space, with the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) launching Thursday.\n\nVanguard, headquartered just outside Philadelphia, has earned a reputation for being a low cost, and more conservative investment manager. Under its founder, Jack Bogle, Vanguard helped to drive down costs for investors starting in the 1970s by introducing passive stock index funds that tracked broader markets and, on average, outperformed highly paid active managers. It also constantly lowered its fees.\n\nBogle died in 2019 and Vanguard now oversees more than $8 trillion in assets but still operates using many of its founder's more cautious beliefs.\n\n\n\nDon't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"

        "content": "Corrections & Clarifications: A previous version of this story incorrectly included a firm's name as offering spot bitcoin ETFs. The story is updated to remove it.\n\nBefore now, everyday investors who wanted to trade digital currencies generally had to go to crypto exchanges, a potential deal-breaker for people unfamiliar with bitcoin.\n\nThat changed on Wednesday when federal regulators voted that ordinary American investors can buy and sell spot bitcoin ETFs in the same way they trade stocks.\n\nThe move opens up bitcoin investing to a larger swath of the American public, including potential investors who never quite understood what bitcoin is or how it works, let alone how to buy and sell it. Trading began in earnest on Thursday.\n\nThe vote, taken by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, allows the sale of exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, to the public.\n\nSEC approves bitcoin ETFs, clearing way for public trading\n\nETFs, for the uninitiated, are an investment vehicle akin to a mutual fund. They are traded on exchanges and typically track a specific index or \u201cbasket\u201d of stocks, bonds or commodities. They function like stocks, with prices that change throughout the trading day, whereas mutual funds trade once a day at a single price.\n\nAnticipation for the SEC vote drove up the price of bitcoin, which is notoriously volatile. The currency traded above $47,000 on Thursday, according to Coindesk, up from around $17,000 at the start of last year.\n\n\u201cToday is a monumental day in the history of digital assets,\u201d said Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at a bitcoin ETF issuer called Hashdex, in a statement quoted in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe new ETFs will be listed on Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, all highly regulated exchanges, according to Reuters.\n\nInvesting in a spot-bitcoin ETF will allow investors to reap potential profits from bitcoin without the attendant risks of owning bitcoin directly, Reuters said.\n\nInvestment experts say investing in a bitcoin ETF will be both easier and safer than buying bitcoin directly. Owning bitcoin directly means storing it in a digital \"wallet.\" Using the wallet means maintaining passkeys, encrypted strings of letters and numbers that enable crypto transfers, according to Investopedia. The wallets can be appealing targets for hackers, and the system lacks federal regulation.\n\nBuying and selling bitcoin ETFs will engender trading fees, Investopedia says, but the fees should be attractively low, especially in the first months of trading.\n\nThe federal securities agency had rejected prior bids for publicly traded bitcoin ETFs, on fears that bitcoin is susceptible to manipulation and fraud. The industry has sought ETF trading for more than a decade.\n\nBitcoin ETFs:Here are the best options this year\n\nBitcoin ETFs cleared for trading include Fidelity, BlackRock\n\nThe applications approved Wednesday came from 11 issuers, including such big-name investment firms as BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\nTwo of five SEC commissioners voted against the decision. One of them, Democrat Caroline Crenshaw, called the vote \u201cunsound and ahistorical\u201d in a statement.\n\nTime to give CDs a spin?Certificate of deposit interest rates are highest in years\n\nPublic trading of bitcoin funds marks \u201cthe beginning of a world where it can be part of every portfolio,\u201d said Nathan McCauley, CEO and co-founder of the crypto platform Anchorage Digital, speaking to Investor\u2019s Business Daily."

        "title": "Bitcoin ETFs are a siren song, not proof of concept - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nThe writer is chief executive and chief investment officer of Richard Bernstein Advisors\n\nProof of concept typically means evidence that a design idea is feasible. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts have suggested that the approval of bitcoin ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission this week is substantial proof of concept that cryptocurrencies are viable and marks a big step towards their integration into the financial system. The question, however, is viable and feasible as what?\n\nThe primary purpose of currencies throughout economic history has been to facilitate consumption, business dealings and capital investment. Trading, speculating and hedging happen after a currency begins to be widely used and its transactional economic purpose is well established.\n\nNo one actively traded or speculated in the dollar, the pound, the yen or other major global currencies before they were used for economic transactions. The required proof of concept is their economic use. Of course, not all currencies achieve this. Some emerging countries\u2019 inflation rates are so high that locals prefer to use established currencies, such as the US dollar, in day-to-day transactions. Cryptocurrency boosters have suggested that bitcoin might be a preferable option.\n\nEl Salvador is famous for trying to make the connection between bitcoin speculation and economic reality but, so far, the results are questionable. Despite claims that the flow of funds into El Salvador using bitcoin would be cheaper and easier than those using the US dollar, the El Salvadoran central bank estimates that only about 1 per cent of received remittances in the first six months of 2023 were in bitcoin.\n\nIf cryptocurrencies are indeed currencies, and not speculative collectible fads like baseball cards or Beanie Babies, then they would be the world\u2019s first traded currency with no economic purpose. Outside of relatively small constructive uses in some emerging economies, one might be able to pay for fentanyl or arms shipments covertly, hide wealth or fund terrorists, but they are of little value for day-to-day transactions like buying groceries or paying most bills.\n\nAnd despite the enthusiasm surrounding issuance of bitcoin ETFs this week, this does not facilitate the broader transactional use of cryptocurrencies in the US or global economies. It will still be hard to buy a cup of coffee with it.\n\nHowever, if Bitcoin\u2019s purpose is purely as a vehicle for trading and speculation, then these ETFs might indeed be proof of concept. They will probably encourage participation among individual investors who feel traditional exchange trading via better-known financial institutions is safer than the previously existing means of trading cryptos.\n\nWell-established financial institutions might want to be wary. The deflation of both the technology and housing bubbles revealed legal and financial liabilities they didn\u2019t anticipate. The spread of bitcoin speculation and any subsequent deflation could expose similar risks.\n\nDemocratisation of the market is a common characteristic of financial bubbles. The idea that the playing field has been levelled and everyone now gets access to an asset has historically been a siren\u2019s song luring investors to participate in financial bubbles. Bitcoin ETFs seem to be this bubble\u2019s bait.\n\nThey could even be an impediment to the US Federal Reserve\u2019s inflation fighting. Bubbles are inherently inflationary because an economy diverts capital to bubble assets instead of to productive resources. Simply put, money flows to things the economy doesn\u2019t need at the expense of things it does. If the resulting undersupply of goods and services can\u2019t keep up with aggregate demand, or productivity doesn\u2019t significantly improve, then a bubble\u2019s misallocation of capital ignites inflationary pressures.\n\nAs evidence mounts that globalisation is starting to contract, the US is in a somewhat precarious position because of its massive trade deficit. One might therefore expect capital flows to shift towards improving the country\u2019s woefully inadequate infrastructure and capital base. The advent of bitcoin ETFs could further sidetrack capital towards unproductive speculative use.\n\nSome have suggested that bitcoin is a digital version of gold. That seems to ignore the fact that such precious metals and commodities have economic uses and aren\u2019t merely a means of speculation or a store of value. The fillings in my mouth or my wedding ring won\u2019t ever be made of bitcoin.\n\nIn fact, it better resembles digital tulips, echoing the Dutch tulip bubble of the 1600s. This craze got so extreme that the Amsterdam Stock Exchange began to regularly trade bulbs alongside equities. The cryptocurrency rage is now extreme enough that established exchanges including the NYSE and Nasdaq will start trading bitcoin ETFs. This will probably spur additional public interest, but for the wrong reasons.\n\nThose looking to pile in should remember that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies still seem a tool for speculation, rather than currencies with proven economic merit. The actions of this week will simply expand that speculation to a broader, and likely unsuspecting, audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Jonathan Raa | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nThe bitcoin exchange-traded funds launching Thursday after the SEC's long-awaited approval come at a wide variety of price points, with signs that a fee war is already underway. The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) has the lowest expense ratio of all the new bitcoin funds, at 0.20%. Several other funds are close behind, including the Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) at 0.21% and the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) at 0.25%. The Bitwise fund also has a temporary waiver that will eliminate the fee entirely for six months on the first $1 billion of assets. Other proposed funds have similar waivers, meaning early adopters of the bitcoin ETFs will have little or zero management cost for a brief time.\n\nBitcoin ETF fee comparison Fund Ticker Fee Bitwise Bitcoin ETF BITB 0.20%* Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ARKB 0.21%* Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund FBTC 0.25%* iShares Bitcoin Trust IBIT 0.25%* Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund BRRR 0.25%* VanEck Bitcoin Trust HODL 0.25% Franklin Bitcoin ETF EZBC 0.29% WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund BTCW 0.30%* Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF BTCO 0.39%* Hashdex Bitcoin ETF DEFI 0.94% Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC 1.5%\n\nSource: SEC filings; * indicates temporary waiver for part or all of the management fee\n\nThe fees for bitcoin funds are higher than many broad stock index funds, with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) charging less than 0.10%. But the pricing is in line with or even below the biggest commodity funds, as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and the United States Oil Fund (USO) charge 0.40% and 0.60%, respectively. Fund managers make money by charging fees on the assets under management. ETF fees have been trending lower over time, and some asset managers have shown a willingness to run a new fund at a loss in order to attract more assets and maximize revenue long term. The fees are taken out of a fund's asset pool, and investors are not billed individually. The low prices before the launch show that the battle to lower fees is already in effect for crypto funds. For example, Ark-21Shares, Valkyrie, Invesco-Galaxy and others had shown higher fees initially but lowered them in subsequent filings. Even Bitwise dropped its proposed fee to 0.20% from 0.24%, which was already the lowest of the initial batch. \"I think the level of competition was maybe higher than expected. I think there were a couple of issuers like Ark for example that signaled potentially higher fees, and once the rubber sort of met the road, they all came in pretty low,\" said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar.\n\nMuch cheaper than options before"

        "content": "Print this page\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has approved the first spot bitcoin exchange traded funds in a watershed moment that cryptocurrency enthusiasts are betting will draw new retail and institutional investors into the market.\n\nThe top American securities regulator cleared 11 ETFs to list, with sponsors ranging from established players such as Fidelity and Invesco to digitally focused newcomers including Grayscale and Ark Invest.\n\nThe first funds \u2014 which trade on exchanges like stocks and enjoy special tax treatment in the US \u2014 are expected to start trading as soon as Thursday morning, when BlackRock will ring the opening bell at Nasdaq to promote its iShares Bitcoin Trust.\n\nThe approval comes after months of anticipation and a bitter legal battle. It also caps a wild 24 hours that saw hackers briefly seize control of the SEC\u2019s account on the social media site X and falsely claim that the applications had already been approved, prompting sharp swings in bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nBitcoin was trading 3 per cent higher at about $47,000 on Thursday morning, well below the $69,000 peak it hit in November 2021 but nearly three times the $16,000 trough it hit in December 2022 after the collapse of the now notorious crypto exchange FTX.\n\nWhile spot bitcoin ETFs have been available in other markets, the US approvals are expected to usher in a new era for the most popular and liquid crypto token. US institutional and retail investors will now be able to gain direct exposure to the coin through a regulated product, without the risks of buying from unregulated exchanges or the higher costs associated with ETFs that invest in bitcoin futures.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge milestone, it\u2019s recognition of bitcoin being a large-scale traditional investment,\u201d said Jad Comair, chief executive of Melanion Capital, the first company to launch a bitcoin thematic ETF in the EU. \u201cWe\u2019re opening the doors to Wall Street.\u201d\n\nThe decision also marks a U-turn by the SEC. The regulator resisted spot bitcoin ETFs for nearly a decade on the grounds that cryptocurrencies were susceptible to manipulation and fraud. But last year, Grayscale successfully challenged the watchdog\u2019s rejection of an earlier spot bitcoin application. A federal appeals court ruled in August that the decision was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d, putting pressure on the SEC to change its stance.\n\nSome crypto enthusiasts are betting that the ETFs will substantially boost demand for digital assets, though some ETF observers are sceptical that massive sums will flood into the products. When ProShares launched the first bitcoin futures ETF in 2021, it pulled in $1bn in two days.\n\nBut consumer protection and investor groups have warned that making the product available via an ETF would encourage retail investors to move money into a sector known for repeated scandals and massive price fluctuations.\n\nDennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, said the approval \u201cis a historic mistake that will not only unleash crypto predators on tens of millions of investors and retirees but will also likely undermine financial stability\u201d.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler tried to split the difference in a statement. \u201cWhile we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse bitcoin,\u201d he said, telling investors to \u201cremain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto\u201d.\n\nThe false message posted to the SEC\u2019s X account on Tuesday sent the bitcoin price up to a 1.5 per cent daily gain before falling as much as 3.4 per cent after the regulator set the record straight.\n\nThe aspiring ETFs are similar in that they all invest in bitcoin directly. All aim to launch organically except for Grayscale, which seeks to convert its $29bn bitcoin trust into an ETF, and Hashdex, which plans to convert a bitcoin futures fund into a spot one.\n\nA price war has already broken out among the new ETF providers. BlackRock, Fidelity and others updated their paperwork earlier this week to announce fees less than 0.5 per cent, with several promising to waive charges altogether in the early months of trading.\n\nGrayscale chief executive Michael Sonnenshein told the Financial Times that his firm had dropped its fee from 2 per cent to 1.5 per cent but did not plan further cuts. As a conversion from an existing product, GBTC \u201cis coming to market in a very differentiated way from other ETF issuers that are starting from zero and are just getting their product launched\u201d, he said.\n\nArk\u2019s Cathie Wood \u2014 whose firm will not impose its 0.21 per cent fee until six months after launch or until its ETF reaches $1bn \u2014 characterised bitcoin as a \u201cpublic good\u201d and said she was comfortable using the product as a loss leader.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that we provide access and make it as accessible as possible,\u201d Wood told the FT. \u201cWe are not looking to maximise profits on this. We\u2019ve got other actively managed products that will help us.\u201d\n\nIn a departure from normal ETF practice, the funds will use cash to create and redeem new shares rather than in-kind transactions involving their underlying assets \u2014 bitcoin, in this case.\n\nThe SEC held out against a spot bitcoin ETF for nearly a decade, but in late 2021 it allowed ProShares to launch the first of several ETFs that hold bitcoin futures.\n\nAfter Grayscale filed its lawsuit, well-known ETF providers began filing their own applications and the SEC started working with them to fine tune their proposals. In recent months, the issuers have spelt out how they will protect investors from market manipulation, identified some of the financial institutions that will create and redeem shares and shifted to the cash-based method of creation.\n\nThe SEC has been \u201cone of the most sceptical regulators in the world and has gotten to the finish line and approved it\u201d, Wood said. \u201cAnd you know there\u2019s been a lot of battle testing going on around this.\u201d\n\nThis article has been amended since publication to reflect that 11 ETFs have been cleared for listing, not 10"

        "content": "Following the recently reported hack of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\u2019s social media account yesterday (10 January 2024), the SEC formally announced that it had approved the launch of 11 Bitcoin ETFs in the US.\n\nAs the announcement states, these approvals are not an endorsement of cryptocurrency as an \u201cinvestment\u201d or of any of the issuers of the ETFs themselves.\n\n\u201cIt should in no way signal the Commission\u2019s willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities. Nor does the approval signal anything about the Commission\u2019s views as to the status of other crypto assets under the federal securities laws or about the current state of non-compliance of certain crypto asset market participants with the federal securities laws.\u201d\n\nThe Chair of the SEC went further and stated that (in contrast to assets such as metals, which have \u201cconsumer and industrial uses), \u201cbitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset that\u2019s also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion, and terrorist financing.\u201d\n\nThose of you who have followed the SEC\u2019s approach to cryptocurrency during under its current Chair\u2019s tenure, will find it no surprise that the announcement also made clear that \u201cthe vast majority of crypto assets are investment contracts and thus subject to federal securities laws.\u201d\n\nIt is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the reason the SEC finally approved bitcoin ETFs, is that it was forced to do so and that it is making the best of a difficult situation.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2023, the SEC received (and refused) applications for the launch of 20 spot bitcoin ETFs. One of those filings was by Grayscale, which proposed converting its bitcoin trust into a ETF. When this application was refused, Grayscale appealed and the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \u201cheld that the [SEC] failed to adequately explain its reasoning in disapproving the listing and trading of the Grayscale\u2019s proposed ETP.\u201d\n\nThe SEC was then in the position that it had to reconsider applications \u2013 and provide \u201cadequate\u201d reasoning for further approvals \u2013 or bring spot bitcoin into the ETF market where it would be subject to investor protection rules and transparency obligations. A ETF/ETP happens also to be a \u201csecurity\u201d which would satisfy the SEC Chair that he had brought crypto assets within his commission\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nWhat is a ETF or ETP?\n\nA ETF/ETP is a pooled investment vehicle which operates like a mutual fund. They track the price/value of an underlying asset (in this case, the price of bitcoin) without the investor needing to have direct exposure to the underlying. The \u201cE\u201d in ETF/ETP refers to the investment being exchange-traded. The price of the ETF\u2019s shares will change during the day as its shares are bought and sold on the market.\n\nHow to ETFs and ETPs work?\n\nETFs benefit from a process called creation/redemption. Creation is the buying of the underlying asset (in this cash bitcoin) and wrapping them into the traditional exchange-traded fund structure. Redemption is the process by which the underlying assets are unwrapped from the structure.\n\nThe process for creation and redemption is controlled by the ETF sponsor and third parties which in other structures would be called market-makers but in the ETF context are called \u201cauthorised participants\u201d (APs). APs create ETF shares by assembling blocks of the underlying assets and delivering them to the ETF sponsor/issuer. In return, the sponsor bundles the underlying into an ETF wrapper and delivers ETF shares to the AP. These newly-created shares are then introduced to the listed secondary market, where they can be bought and sold.\n\nRedemption is the reverse of this process: ETF shares are bought by the AP (taking them out of the secondary market) and delivered to the ETF sponsor in exchange for the underlying of an equivalent value (i.e. the sponsor delivers bitcoin to the AP).\n\nWhy are bitcoin ETFs so important?\n\nFirst, any ETF permits investors to gain some exposure to the market for the underlying without having to own the underlying itself. These approvals will permit institutions to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies and it will permit retail investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies with the protections afforded by the fact that they are buying/selling regulated securities on a regulated market.\n\nWhat next?\n\nBitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency or crypto asset. The likelihood is that the next round of ETF applications will be for spot ether. We understand that major ETF issuers and sponsors have applied for ether ETFs in the last few months \u2013 the applications will be working their way through the SEC\u2019s approval process. If those applications are approved (about which the industry is bullish), then the likelihood is that the next few years will see the launch of ETFs with a great variety of crypto asset underlyings.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of bitcoin ETFs also is likely to prompt other regulators around the globe to follow suit."

Net income for the quarter at the wealth group was $491 million, a decline of 31% when compared to the same quarter last year.\n\nSince 2019, Wells Fargo & Co., the giant bank, has been overhauling its wealth management business, jettisoning noncore operations like its overseas client operations and rebranding its private bank, and focusing on overhauling management and better retaining its private client wealth management advisors.\n\nMany of those advisors have been eying its independent arm, Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, or FiNet, where they work with greater autonomy and receive a more generous percentage of the revenue, but also shoulder more of the expenses as independent contractors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made significant investments the last few years across our franchise to better serve our customers and help drive growth,\u201d Mike Santomassimo, the bank\u2019s chef financial officer, said on a conference call Friday morning with investors. \u201cWe expect the revenue growth that these investments should generate in businesses like corporate investment banking and wealth and investment management will help fund additional investments.\u201d"

        "content": "As trading of spot bitcoin funds got off to a first day of action in the U.S., users with brokerage accounts at Vanguard were not able to participate.\n\nWhen contacted by telephone on Thursday, a day after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 spot funds, a Vanguard customer service representative said bitcoin ETFs were not available on the platform because they were \"highly speculative,\" \"unregulated\" and didn't fit with the company's long-term investing philosophy. The representative noted that the platform didn't allow other kinds of investments, such as leveraged ETFs.\n\nA company spokesperson confirmed that the spot bitcoin funds were not available on the platform.\n\n\"We also have no plans to offer Vanguard Bitcoin BTC -6.92% ETFs or other crypto-related products \u2013 our perspective is long-standing that cryptocurrencies' high volatility runs counter to our goal of helping investors generate positive real returns over the long term,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nClients who tried to buy a share of BlackRock's IBIT were told the trade could not be completed, with the website stating that \"securities may be unavailable for purchase at Vanguard due to a number of variables including regulatory restrictions, corporate actions, or various trading and/or settlement limitations.\"\n\nThat came in contrast to other brokerages such as E*TRADE, Charles Schwab and Fidelity, where users with brokerage accounts were able to purchase the spot bitcoin ETFs. On the Fidelity platform, users who tried to purchase shares were reminded that the investment was subject to a \"Designated Investments Agreement\" that acknowledged the user was an experienced investor with a high tolerance for risk."

        "title": "The SEC has approved bitcoin ETFs. What are they and what does it mean for investors? - The Guardian",
        "content": "The US securities regulator has approved the first US-listed exchange traded funds (ETF) to track bitcoin, in a watershed moment for the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency and the broader crypto industry.\n\nThe announcement came at the end of a tumultuous 24 hours for the popular cryptocurrency, which saw a tweet sent from the account of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announcing the approval of the long-awaited ETFs on Tuesday, leading the price of bitcoin to spike by more than $1,000. Soon after, the SEC said its account had been \u201ccompromised\u201d and that the tweet was \u201cunauthorised\u201d.\n\nBy Wednesday however, the SEC had approved the ETFs \u2013 this time for real \u2013 adding that it remained sceptical about cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat has been approved?\n\nThe SEC has given the green light to 11 ETFs for bitcoin in the US, opening the door to cryptocurrencies to many new investors who don\u2019t want to take the extra steps involved in buying actual bitcoin.\n\nAn ETF is an easy way to invest in assets or a group of assets without having to directly buy the assets themselves. For example, the SPDR Gold Shares ETF allows anyone to invest in gold without having to find a place to store a bar or protect it.\n\nETFs can also be easily traded on stock exchanges.\n\nSince bitcoin\u2019s inception, anyone wanting to own one would either have to adopt a digital wallet or open an account at a crypto trading platform like Coinbase or Binance. Cryptocurrency advocates say the development will thrust the once niche and nerdy corner of the internet even further into the financial mainstream.\n\nThe decision to approve the ETFs is a major win for huge fund managers like BlackRock, Fidelity Investments and Invesco who will manage the funds \u2013 and have pushed hard to get the SEC to approve them.\n\nSome products are expected to begin trading as early as Thursday, kicking off a fierce competition for market share.\n\nWhat has the SEC said?\n\nDespite approving the new ETFs, the SEC said it was still deeply skeptical about cryptocurrencies and that its decision did not mean it approves or endorses bitcoin.\n\n\u201cInvestors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto,\u201d said Gary Gensler, the agency\u2019s chairman.\n\nOther commissioners expressed alarm that the SEC agreed to approve the funds.\n\n\u201cI am concerned that these products will flood the markets and land squarely in the retirement accounts of US households who can least afford to lose their savings to the fraud and manipulation that appears prevalent in the spot bitcoin markets,\u201d Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw said in her dissent.\n\nWhat does this mean for the price of bitcoin?\n\nAfter nearly two years of turmoil that has seen the price of bitcoin plummet and the failure of several crypto firms, Wednesday\u2019s announcement will come as good news to many investors in the crypto market.\n\nThe greenlight from regulators had been anticipated for several months and the price of bitcoin has jumped about 70% since October as crypto investors speculated the broad use of bitcoin ETFs would drive up demand for the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe price had sunk as low as $16,000 in November 2022 after the bankruptcy of the crypto exchange FTX. It was trading at $46,500 in the hours after the SEC announcement.\n\nStandard Chartered analysts this week said the ETFs could draw $50bn to $100bn this year alone, potentially driving the price of bitcoin as high as $100,000. Others have said inflows will be closer to $55bn over five years.\n\nOther analysts have been more cautious in their predictions, saying that ETFs may actually help stabilise crypto prices by broadening their use and potential audience.\n\nMost, however, remain concerned that the broad use of crypto ETFs could put too much risk and volatility into Americans\u2019 retirement accounts \u2013 the price of bitcoin is known to fluctuate wildly, often without warning or explanation.\n\n\u201cThe notorious price volatility of bitcoin \u2026 could expose mainstream investors to a less familiar spectrum of investment risks,\u201d said Yiannis Giokas, senior director of Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n\nThe price of ethereum, the second-most popular cryptocurrency, has also risen on speculation that fund managers will create ETFs around it.\n\nReuters and the Associated Press contributed to this report"

        "content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission cleared nearly a dozen spot bitcoin ETFs Wednesday, with most now expected to start trading.\n\nThe SEC first approved what are known as 19b-4 proposals filed by the Cboe BZX Exchange, Nasdaq and NYSE Arca \u2014 the stock exchanges on which the funds are to be listed.\n\nRegistration statements, or S-1s, by the issuers were then made \u201ceffective\u201d \u2014 a final step toward launch.\n\nWhile a rule change to list Hashdex\u2019s bitcoin futures fund as a spot product was approved, its registration statement to convert the fund is still under SEC review, the firm said Thursday.\n\nWith a bunch of similar ETFs set to launch Thursday, industry watchers have said competition among the bitcoin funds will be fierce. The various asset managers have so far looked to differentiate via low fees and marketing campaigns.\n\nRead more: Fees, liquidity, brand: The factors investors would weigh when picking a bitcoin ETF\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the issuers set to launch the first spot bitcoin ETFs in the US.\n\nBlackRock\n\nFund name: iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT)\n\nExchange: Nasdaq\n\nFee: 0.25% (0.12% for the first 12 months, or $5 billion)\n\nBlackRock entered the spot bitcoin ETF race last June. The move from the world\u2019s largest asset manager was seen by many as positive, given its TradFi standing, size and stellar record of getting funds approved by the SEC.\n\nRead more: BlackRock\u2019s Fink wants to \u2018democratize\u2019 crypto\n\nThe team at BlackRock was busy in November and December, meeting with the SEC five times. In total, the SEC held over 20 meetings with potential issuers.\n\nNeena Mishra, director of ETF research at Zacks Investment Research, previously told Blockworks she would bet on BlackRock\u2019s spot bitcoin ETF to gain the favor of many investors.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s not to like about a low-cost product from the world\u2019s largest asset manager that seems perfect for an advisor or investor looking for safe and convenient bitcoin exposure?\u201d she said.\n\nFidelity\n\nFund name: Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC)\n\nExchange: Cboe BZX\n\nFee: 0.25% (0.0% through July 31, 2024)\n\nLike BlackRock, Fidelity is one of the largest financial companies in the world \u2014 with $11.5 trillion assets under administration.\n\nThe financial services giant rejoined the spot bitcoin race last June, having previously filed for the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust in 2022. Fidelity\u2019s Canadian subsidiary previously launched a similar product on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\n\nAs for fees, the firm announced a fee of 25 basis points, lowering its fee earlier this month after previously proposing a 39 basis point fee. The fund is also waiving the fee until July 31, 2024.\n\nArk Invest, 21Shares\n\nFund name: Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB)\n\nExchange: Cboe BZX\n\nFee: 0.21% (0.0% for first six months, or $1 billion)\n\nThe 2023 proposal from Ark Invest and 21Shares was the first in line for approval or denial by the SEC. The agency had until Jan. 10 to make a decision following multiple delays.\n\nUnlike BlackRock, Ark Invest and 21Shares previously filed for a spot bitcoin ETF \u2014 though, like it did to others, the SEC blocked the bid. 21Shares operates a number of crypto exchange-traded products in Europe.\n\nArk Invest CEO Cathie Wood correctly predicted that while her firm was first in line, the SEC was likely to approve multiple such funds at once.\n\nSimilar to other issuers, Ark and 21Shares lowered its fee ahead of the SEC decision, dropping the price point by four basis points in a Wednesday filing.\n\nArk Invest exited its position in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) ahead of the SEC approval. The move was seen by Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas as a way for the company to potentially give its \u201cown ETF a nice [assets under management] boost.\u201d\n\nBitwise\n\nFund name: Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB)\n\nExchange: NYSE Arca\n\nFee: 0.20% (0.0% for first six months, or $1 billion).\n\nBitwise filed for a physically backed bitcoin ETF in 2019, but withdrew its request in January 2020 amid SEC concerns. The crypto-focused fund group would start another unsuccessful attempt in October 2021.\n\nIt then was among the issuers that refiled for such a fund in the weeks after BlackRock revealed its proposal last June. Bitwise most recently published research in September addressing rebuttals to various bitcoin ETF filings over the years.\n\nBitwise was one of the first to market its ETFs prior to approval. The firm tapped actor Jonathan Goldsmith \u2014 known as the most interesting man in the world from Dos Equis ads \u2014 for several spots.\n\nGrayscale\n\nFund name: Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)\n\nExchange: NYSE Arca\n\nFee: 1.5%\n\nGrayscale is a bit different from the other issuers, as it filed to convert its existing Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF. It thus comes in to spot bitcoin ETF launch day with a large asset base.\n\nGBTC launched in 2013 and has more than $28 billion in assets under management. The trading of GBTC had historically been limited to OTCQX.\n\nThe SEC denied the conversion in 2022, spurring Grayscale to sue the regulator. A panel of judges ruled in favor of Grayscale last August, ordering the SEC to reconsider it.\n\nThe Grayscale ETF is set to carry a significantly higher price point than competitors, though it is lower than the 2% annual fee it previously charged.\n\nRead more: Why the planned fee for Grayscale\u2019s bitcoin ETF is much higher than others\n\nValkyrie\n\nFund name: Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR)\n\nExchange: Nasdaq\n\nFee: 0.25% (0.0% for first three months)\n\nThe crypto asset manager re-entered the spot bitcoin ETF race after BlackRock in June.\n\nValkyrie manages an ETF that holds the stocks of bitcoin mining companies, as well as a fund that invests in bitcoin and ether futures contracts.\n\n\u201cOur goal isn\u2019t to be the lowest fee provider,\u201d Valkyrie co-founder Steven McClurg told Blockworks Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re very thoughtful about how we run our products; we\u2019re really going to be focusing on performance.\u201d\n\nRead more: CoinShares tees up potential buy of Valkyrie\u2019s crypto ETF wing\n\nVanEck\n\nFund name: VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL)\n\nExchange: Cboe BZX\n\nFee: 0.25%\n\nVanEck was previously unsuccessful in launching a spot bitcoin ETF, as the SEC denied its application for such a fund in 2021. The company renewed its efforts in June in response to BlackRock\u2019s filing.\n\nThe firm has nearly 70 ETFs trading in the US with combined assets under management of $65 billion, according to ETF.com.\n\nVanEck previously launched a bitcoin futures ETF in 2021 and an ether futures ETF last year. It posted a bitcoin ad teaser on X last month after Bitwise and Hashdex revealed commercials on their own accounts.\n\nWisdomTree\n\nFund name: WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust (BTCW)\n\nExchange: Cboe BZX\n\nFee: 0.30% (0.0% for first six months, or $1 billion)\n\nWisdomTree, a firm that surpassed $100 billion in assets under management last month, renewed its spot bitcoin ETF effort in the days following BlackRock\u2019s June filing.\n\n\u201cThe bitcoin market has matured such that it is operating at a level of efficiency and scale similar in material respects to established global equity, fixed income and commodity markets,\u201d the firm noted in a filing at the time.\n\nWisdomTree last year launched a \u201cblockchain-native\u201d app where consumers can buy and sell bitcoin and ether, as well as digital funds that keep a record of investor share ownership on the Stellar or Ethereum blockchains.\n\nFranklin Templeton\n\nFund name: Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC)\n\nExchange: Cboe BZX\n\nFee: 0.29%\n\nFranklin Templeton, like BlackRock and Fidelity, is a household name in traditional finance circles. The firm manages roughly $1.5 trillion in assets.\n\nThe company joined the bitcoin ETF race a bit later than others, filing for one in September \u2014 several weeks after Grayscale\u2019s court win against the SEC.\n\nRoger Bayston, the firm\u2019s head of digital assets, told Blockworks in June that blockchain technology is set to be \u201ctransformational\u201d for capital markets.\n\nInvesco, Galaxy Digital\n\nFund name: Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO)\n\nExchange: Cboe BZX\n\nFee: 0.39% (0.0% for first six months, or $5 billion)\n\nInvesco\u2019s latest spot bitcoin ETF bid \u2014 with partner Galaxy Digital \u2014 commenced in June just days after BlackRock\u2019s filing.\n\nThe firms had first teamed up to build a crypto ETF suite in September 2021.\n\nInvesco is perhaps best known for its QQQ ETF, which holds Nasdaq 100 companies. About half of the company\u2019s nearly $460 billion of US ETF assets under management reside in that fund.\n\nHashdex\n\nFund name: Hashdex Bitcoin ETF (DEFI)\n\nExchange: NYSE Arca\n\nFee: 0.94%\n\nBrazil-based Hashdex started offering a spot bitcoin ETF in Brazil in August 2021.\n\nThe asset manager filed in August to modify its Bitcoin Futures ETF (DEFI) in the US to a fund that also holds bitcoin directly.\n\nThough a rule change to list Hashdex\u2019s bitcoin futures fund as a spot product was approved Wednesday, the firm noted its registration statement to convert the fund remains under SEC review.\n\nHashdex has released bitcoin ads on X in recent weeks, touting its focus on the crypto segment.\n\n\u201cWe believe investors will gravitate towards thematic asset management experience with a sole focus on digital assets and bitcoin, with extensive experience running bitcoin ETFs in several markets,\u201d Hashdex marketing head Chris Glendening told Blockworks last month.\n\nCasey Wagner contributed reporting.\n\nUpdated Jan. 11, 2024 at 5:20 pm ET: Noted that Hashdex\u2019s bitcoin futures fund has not yet converted to a spot product after the firm issued a corrected press release late Thursday.\n\nUpdated Jan. 11, 2024 at 9:50 am ET: Changed Valkyrie fee to 0.25% from 0.49%.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "It was a big day for spot bitcoin ETFs, and BlackRock appears to be the victor in the first day of trading.\n\nOn a day in which spot bitcoin ETF trading volumes reached nearly $4.6 billion, BlackRock's fund saw just over $1 billion, according to data from Yahoo Finance compiled by The Block. That made BlackRock's instrument the top-performer in terms of volume among new bitcoin funds.\n\nFidelity ranked as the second-best performing ETF among the new crypto-based funds, racking up $685 million in trading.\n\n\"While it's premature to make final judgments, this significant trading volume indicates a considerable influx of investor funds into the spot-based bitcoin ETFs,\" said James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares.\n\nFirst day of trading\n\nThursday marked the first day of trading of spot bitcoin ETFs after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the new product only yesterday.\n\nWhile Grayscale's spot bitcoin ETF led all of the funds in trading volume on Thursday, with $2.3 billion, the institution's fund is a conversion of its flagship GBTC fund. Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas speculated that most of Grayscale's volume is likely \"all selling\" as opposed to an inflow of fresh capital.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nBloomberg Intelligence Analyst James Seyffart posted a similar statement to the social media platform X.\n\n\"Very easy argument to be made that a ton of this volume was selling of [Grayscale's fund] and buying of other ETFs for now,\" he said.\n\nHistoric day for an ETF launch\n\nBalchunas also posted a chart on X showing BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF as one of the top 25 day one performers in ETF history.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs from ARK 21Shares and Bitwise's also generated significant trading, registering $278 million and $122 million, respectively.\n\nPeter Smith, the CEO & co-founder of Blockchain.com, heralded the launch in a post on X, even as some analysts have wondered what the new, cheap funds could mean for crypto exchanges and the revenue they generate from trading fees.\n\n\"Perhaps the most interesting thing is the broad array of firms that have launched a product - the biggest tradfi players (Blackrock), the crypto native + tradfi JVs (Galaxy/Invesco) and then the truly crypto natives like Greyscale and Bitwise,\" he wrote. \"This is how crypto goes forward - a big, diverse tent.\""

The new ETFs are listed on the Nasdaq, NYSE, and CBOE exchanges.\n\nThey are widely expected to make it easier for individuals to invest in Bitcoin, the first and largest cryptocurrency, given that retail investors often lack the technical and custody skills to purchase cryptocurrencies on their own.\n\nBut what about institutional investors and large corporations?

Could corporate financial officers now consider Bitcoin a potential corporate treasury reserve asset, for instance?\n\nIn 2021, the SEC greenlighted Bitcoin futures ETFs backed by derivatives that traded on commodities exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, but these didn\u2019t attract mainstream investors.\n\nThus far, only a handful of large public corporations have substantially invested in Bitcoin: Tesla, Block (formerly Square) and most notably, MicroStrategy, which has a reported 174,500 Bitcoins in its corporate treasury that makes it by far the biggest public company that holds crypto.\n\nMore typically, corporate financial officers have favored short-dated US Treasuries, cash, commercial paper, and money market funds for their reserves\u2014not high-risk assets like crypto.\n\nCautious Corporates\n\nThere are good reasons why institutional investors and corporates may not be changing their stripes anytime soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is the problem of Bitcoin\u2019s ongoing volatility, as the Europe-based division head of a leading business consultancy, who was not authorized to speak, told Global Finance. \u201cSo, the ETFs will be more used as an investment vehicle for asset managers than by CFOs.\u201d Bitcoin\u2019s price gyrations \u201cmake investing a bit more dangerous for many companies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of corporates will not take the MicroStrategy approach,\u201d Andr\u00e9 Casterman, managing director of Casterman Advisory, says that CFOs will not move their treasury funds into crypto en masse soon.\n\nThere are other reasons beyond crypto\u2019s price volatility. Most large public companies aren\u2019t owned or controlled by disruptive, hard-charging individuals\u2014like the triad of corporate treasury pioneers: Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk, Block\u2019s Jack Dorsey and MicroStrategy\u2019s Michael Saylor, who can do as they like in this area. Pension fund managers, by comparison, answer to investment boards, while CFOs of publicly traded companies must be mindful of shareholders.\n\nAndr\u00e9 Casterman, managing director of Casterman Advisory, says that CFOs will not move their treasury funds into crypto en masse soon.\n\nThus, \u201cthe career risk for those in charge is just too great for them to dive in and allocate their treasury cash to Bitcoin instead of straight cash or USTs,\u201d recently posted James Lavish, co-managing partner at the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund.\n\nStill, companies like BlackRock and Fidelity do extensive due diligence before applying for an ETF, assessing security issues and gauging customer demand. In a sense, they have already vetted Bitcoin and bestowed their seal of approval upon it. At the least, they provide some assurance for corporate CFOs who may have been sitting on the fence about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe treasury assets diversification argument is complex, however, because there is a strong belief that public companies should focus on their core business operation, \u201csuggesting that investing in Bitcoin may not align with their core business objective,\u201d noted Jim Kyung-Soo Liew, associate professor of finance at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Carey Business School.\n\nLiew continued, \u201cconsidering the accessibility of Bitcoin through ETFs, it\u2019s evident that the career risk for CFOs has now substantially diminished.\u201d\n\nThere could also be a sort of \u2018virtuous cycle\u2019 process at play here, at least regarding volatility. The argument is that as more corporations and institutional investors invest in BTC, Bitcoin becomes less volatile because these groups tend to be long-term investors. This, in turn, brings in more institutional investors, and so on.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, in a competitive environment where peer companies are actively and aggressively venturing into Bitcoin, FOMO [fear of missing out] could kick in and exert significant pressure on corporate CFOs\u2019 decisions to include Bitcoin,\u201d said Liew.\n\nOthers agree that this week\u2019s events could spur large institutions to invest in cryptocurrency. \u201cA spot Bitcoin ETF could inspire some institutions who were on the fence to incorporate digital assets into their portfolios,\u201d Lim Wee Kian, CEO of DBS Digital Exchange, told Global Finance.\n\nHowever, Lim adds that an ETF alone is just one piece of the puzzle before cryptocurrencies achieve widespread adoption by corporates. \u201cEqually as important is the proliferation of institutional-grade platforms that offer investors peace of mind regarding how the ETF\u2019s underlying asset is held,\u201d said Lim.\n\nRegarding a potential corporate allocation of Bitcoin, \u201cThere are some models which suggest 4-6% portfolio ratio is optimal,\u201d the consulting firm executive (cited above) continued. \u201cPotentially, some CFOs will go that way. But to do so, they must first invest in skilled people who understand this market and the volatility. This is quite different from the bond, FX or equity markets.\u201d\n\nIn sum, the SEC\u2019s approval of 11 Bitcoin ETFs isn\u2019t likely to overturn the traditional financial and corporate communities any time soon. Still, it can become the basis for a new round of financial innovation. Or, as Casterman told Global Finance, at a minimum, \u201cit\u2019s a great opportunity for asset managers to create new products.\u201d"

As both BlackRock and Fidelity's products are new it's likely the majority of the trading volume is made up of inflows of capital.\n\nThat could be different for Grayscale's spot bitcoin ETF, which instead of being a new exchange-traded fund is a conversion of its flagship fund. Grayscale's ETF had about $1 billion in trading volume as of 11:10 a.m. EST but it's unclear how much of that could possibly be capital flowing out of the instrument.\n\nThe ARK 21Shares Bitcoin BTC -6.74% ETF had $148 million of trading volume. Some other new spot bitcoin ETFs that began trading, like those offered by Franklin Templeton and Valkyrie registered volumes below $10 million on Thursday morning, the data also showed.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs could bring in $100 billion\n\nMany market watchers have attempted to speculate how much capital will flow into the new instruments, which allows investors to wager on the price of bitcoin without having to own the digital currency. The new spot bitcoin ETFs could bring in as much as $50 billion to 100 billion in 2024, according to Standard Chartered Bank.\n\nAfter months of waiting, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs yesterday.

        "content": "Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, speaks during an interview on CNBC on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, February 27, 2023. Brendan McDermid | Reuters\n\nArk Invest President and COO Tom Staudt believes bitcoin is now a \"public good\" to which all investors should have access, as the company launches its first bitcoin exchange-traded fund. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday approved rule changes allowing the creation of bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., paving the way for Ark and many other issuers, including BlackRock's iShares and Fidelity, to launch their new offerings. The first funds will begin trading Thursday. Staudt told CNBC's \"Street Signs Asia\" on Thursday that the creation of a bitcoin ETF was aimed at removing \"any last possible friction or pain points\" that may have given investors reservations about entering the cryptocurrency asset class \u2014 including custody, gatekeeping, regulatory and cost concerns. The new ETF from Cathie Wood's Ark Invest and partner 21Shares will come to market with a fee of 0.21%, reportedly making it one of the cheapest offerings on the newly-created market, but will also waive fees for investors for the first six months.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF is one of six initially waiving fees, alongside the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund, the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF and the Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund. Only Bitwise's offering will be cheaper for investors, at 0.2% once fees are introduced. \"For most, we think this is going to be far cheaper than having access to directly trade crypto, when you think about the total costs between custody, the cost of trading and spreads,\" Staudt said. \"But what it's really about is removing any of the last barriers that may have kept people from looking at the space, and now that they can access it, they can access it at what we think is a very attractive price point, we think that it is going to increase the number of people.\" He added that the low price point reflects that Ark does not see the ETF as an instrument aimed at \"maximizing profit,\" and noted that the company's ETFs have had exposure to cryptocurrency since 2014. \"This is really nine years into a journey to make sure that we continue to provide the research and effectively, this has become a public good that we want to make sure all investors have access to.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nAs far as making the investment case for the new asset class, Staudt pointed to the U.S. regional banking crisis in March 2023 as an example of how bitcoin could perform as both a \"risk-on and a risk-off asset,\" and can be \"used for both inflation and in fears of deflation.\" \"Of course it has been far more talked about that it is the complement to gold, the digital gold store of value, and certainly that holds up,\" he said. \"This is a new asset class. We haven't had a new asset class for financial portfolio allocation in quite some time, and with a new asset class comes lower correlation to the other asset classes previously allocated to.\" Bitcoin was trading at around $47,300 on Thursday morning , according to Coin Metrics, and the SEC's decision has many analysts bullish about newly unlocked potential for massive gains.\n\nwatch now"

Fink's positive sentiment further adds to the growing chorus of influential figures recognizing Bitcoin's potential to play a protective role in an investment portfolio.\n\nAs the Bitcoin market continues to evolve, statements like these from key industry figures contribute to shaping a positive narrative around Bitcoin, potentially influencing broader market sentiments and paving the way for increased adoption.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Bitcoin ETFs have a key difference from their stock fund counterparts - CNBC",
        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pushed for bitcoin exchange-traded funds to have a key difference from major stock funds, and that decision's effect on how the funds trade will only become clear over time.\n\nThe bitcoin funds that launched Thursday are using a share redemption process that turns the underlying crypto into cash. Most ETFs primarily use an in-kind redemption process, where the underlying asset does not have to be actually sold.\n\nWhile the rules around share redemption do not directly affect the smaller trades that retail investors do in brokerage accounts, they come into play for the execution of larger trades made by institutions.\n\nThere is some concern that using the cash-only redemption model could make the plumbing of the ETFs less efficient.\n\n\"It could be that certain funds are capable of getting better execution prices than others. The other thing is that those trading costs, whether it be transaction costs or the market impact type costs that aren't necessarily quantifiable, those costs are now borne by investors,\" said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar.\n\nIn-kind redemptions are typically used by major equity funds and, as crypto asset manager Grayscale pointed out in a presentation to the SEC, commodities funds. Using cash-only redemption could result in ETFs that have weaker liquidity and wider bid-ask spreads, Grayscale argued.\n\nBut Steven McClurg, chief investment officer at Valkyrie, said the situation may be more analogous to fixed income ETFs, where cash redemption is more common because the authorized market participants working with the funds may be more comfortable with that process.\n\n\"In this situation, there's a lot of APs that don't have the ability to transact in bitcoin. If it was an in-kind model, then it would throw a lot of advantage toward the APs that do have that ability. \u2026 We want as many market makers and authorized participants in these products as possible, because that makes for better markets,\" McClurg said.\n\nFrom a regulatory perspective, the decision to only allow cash redemptions simplifies the chain of custody for bitcoin and removes broker-dealers from the process, said Jeremy Senderowicz, an attorney and shareholder at Vedder Price, a firm that specializes in ETFs.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement Wednesday that broker-dealers are still expected to follow best interest regulations with regard to crypto products, a potential sign that the SEC is wary of those firms becoming directly involved with these funds.\n\nThe good news for investors is that the cash-redemption process should not change the tax treatment of the funds, even though cash redemptions are more generally associated with mutual funds than ETFs. Many investors and financial advisors choose to use ETFs because the funds give them more control over when to create tax events.\n\n\"These things are taxed as grantor trusts. Consensus is that when an AP is redeemed for cash, the tax consequences only accrue to that AP. So it is not like cash redemptions on mutual funds and regular 40-Act ETFs where, to the extent that it's a cash transaction, taxable income stemming from fund transactions is passed through to all the shareholders,\" Senderowicz said.\n\n\n\nDon't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"

        "content": "For the first time ever, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded-funds, opening the door for easier access to investing in the largest cryptocurrency by market value and offering investors more protection, among other benefits detailed by SEC Chair Gary Gensler in his announcement on Wednesday.\n\n\"These products will be listed and traded on registered national securities exchanges. Such regulated exchanges are required to have rules designed to prevent fraud and manipulation, and we will monitor them closely to ensure that they are enforcing those rules. Furthermore, the Commission will fully investigate any fraud or manipulation in the securities markets, including schemes that use social media platforms\" he said.\n\nThere are about 11 ETFs that will likely begin trading, including one from Cathie Wood's ARK Invest.\n\n\"The democratization that we set out to provide our clients democratized access to innovation, both in the public markets, pure play innovation funds. And now with venture in the private markets, Bitcoin is an extension, democratization, access. We think it is going to be one of the most important assets in history,\" she said during an interview on the \"The Claman Countdown\" ahead of the SEC's announcement.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs & tickers\n\nARK/21Shares ARKB\n\nBitwise BITB\n\nBlackRock IBIT\n\nFidelity FBTC\n\nFranklin Templeton EZBC\n\nGrayscale GBTC\n\nInvesco/Galaxy Digital BTCO\n\nValkyrie BRRR\n\nVanEck HODL\n\nWisdomTree BTCW\n\nBetter price tracking\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF will allow investors to efficiently track the price of Bitcoin, in which volatility and swings are not uncommon. Bitcoin is currently trading around $48,000, which is off the 52-week low of $17,474 hit last January but still a far cry from the record high of $67,802.30 hit in November 2021, as tracked by Dow Jones Market Data Group.\n\nLIVE CRYPTO PRICES: FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nMore investment options\n\nPrior to an approved ETF, investors needed to open an account with a crypto exchange like Coinbase or a trading platform such as Robinhood. Now, you can buy the ETF directly through your brokerage account or in a traditional brokerage account. Some investors may still choose to use a Coinbase or Robinhood.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % COIN COINBASE GLOBAL INC. 233.67 -18.06 -7.17% HOOD ROBINHOOD MARKETS INC. 18.05 +0.89 +5.19%\n\nOpens Bitcoin up to more investors\n\nFor registered financial advisors and their clients, investing in Bitcoin will also be easier.\n\n\"Right now, you do have a lot of retail investors directly investing in Bitcoin. But \u2026 obviously, this opens up the field to some of those financial advisers. Who are taking orders from their retail clients, family offices, other institutions. So, it does open up access to a whole field of players in the investment world,\" Roxanna Islam, head of sector and industry research, at VettaFI told FOX Business.\n\nCompetitive fees\n\nBy approving a swath of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the SEC has opened the flood gates to competition.\n\n\"I think, first of all, investors are going to look at fees,\" Islam said. \"I think for a lot of mainstream investors, they will look towards BlackRock because that is a familiar name, but they aren't as big in the crypto world,\" Islam added.\n\nPrior to the SEC's approval, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink raised the cost factor of crypto.\n\n\"What we're trying to do with crypto is make it more democratized with all of crypto and making it much cheaper for investors,\" Fink said during an interview on \"The Claman Countdown\" in July.\n\nSEC CHAIR GENSLER'S STATEMENT ON SPOT BITCOIN ETFs\n\nAssets insured\n\nWhen Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX imploded, erasing about $1 billion in assets, investors were reminded of the high risks associated with crypto investing. Now, Bitcoin spot ETFs carry more protection if they are registered with the SEC.\n\n\"In a liquidation under the Securities Investor Protection Act, SIPC protects customers against the loss of their exchange-traded fund shares, provided that the ETF is registered with the SEC,\" Securities Investor Protection Corporation President and CEO Josephine Wang told FOX Business. \"The limit of protection per customer against the loss of missing securities and related cash is $500,000. Of the $500,000, up to $250,000 can be used to replace missing customer cash,\" she added.\n\nREAD SIPC FACT SHEET HERE\n\nBy comparison, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which protects bank depositors, does not insure crypto or digital assets.\n\nREAD FDIC FACT SHEET HERE"
