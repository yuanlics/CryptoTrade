        "content": "Shares of companies with exposure to cryptocurrencies surged this week as investors cheered a key ruling on one token as a win for the industry.\n\nCoinbase Global, Inc. gained 34% this week, its best performance for the period since mid-March, despite closing 1.6% lower Friday.\n\nOther crypto-linked stocks also had positive weekly performances. Robinhood Markets, Inc. rose 15% this week, its best in nearly a year, and Bakkt Holdings Inc. gained 30%. Bitcoin mining companies such as Marathon Digital Holdings, Hut 8 Mining Corp., Riot Platforms, Inc. and Cipher Mining Inc. also saw weekly gains, even as some sold off Friday.\n\nThursday\u2019s ruling that the Ripple Labs Inc. token is a security when sold to institutional investors \u2014 but not the general public \u2014 was the biggest contributor to gains. The decision added to optimism over Bitcoin ETF applications that lifted investor spirits and Bitcoin earlier in the week.\n\n\u201cThis is a positive read-through to COIN as it sets precedent that crypto token sales through exchanges, at least in the XRP case, did not violate securities laws,\u201d Needham analyst John Todaro wrote in a note, boosting his price target to $120 from $70 on the buy-rated stock. \u201cWe believe this outcome should moderately de-risk the regulatory pressure on the stock.\u201d\n\nOf course, the ruling was specific to Ripple and shouldn\u2019t be hastily applied across the industry, Benjamin Salisbury of Height Capital Markets said in a note.\n\n\u201cWe note that the ruling is specific to facts in this case alone and caution against applying this ruling to the Coinbase lawsuit broadly,\u201d Salisbury said. \u201cWe also expect the SEC to appeal the ruling, given the potential implications for securities laws.\u201d\n\nOutside of regulations, short covering may also be lifting crypto-linked stocks whose 2023 rallies have set up contrarian traders to be squeezed.\n\nIn the last month, short sellers bought back $407 million worth of Coinbase shares to exit their positions, according to data from S3 Partners LLC. This year, Coinbase shorts have paper losses of $2.9 billion, making it the seventh least-profitable short behind Tesla Inc., Nvidia Corp., Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., S3 said."

        "content": "If there's anyone who can spot the future trends in the world of technology, it's venture capitalist Tim Draper. Draper is a co-founder of the VC firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson and has made hundreds of early investments in cutting-edge companies like Tesla.\n\nNow, the 65-year-old VC legend is making another big call on the world's largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC 0.97%) -- namely that it's about to take off. Here's how high Draper thinks the price can go.\n\nDelayed, but a big pop is coming\n\nDraper is not just a billionaire investor -- he's also been a Bitcoin enthusiast from the early years, when the token was still gaining traction. In 2014, Draper purchased 29,656 Bitcoin tokens that had been seized from the Silk Road online marketplace by U.S. Marshals. At the time, the price of Bitcoin was only $632, so Draper has already made an absolute killing.\n\nBut Draper thinks Bitcoin is just getting started. When it traded at around $4,000, Draper predicted that Bitcoin would be at $250,000 by now. While the price of Bitcoin currently hovers around $31,200, Draper is sticking to his prediction. \"I guess we have to wait a little longer (maybe two years), but engineers are hard at work,\" he tweeted not long ago.\n\nSo what's the holdup? Well, in a recent interview with Bloomberg, Draper said he is surprised by how opposed agencies of the U.S. government such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have been toward the crypto industry.\n\nEarlier this year, the SEC sued Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, and then Coinbase, the large crypto exchange in the U.S. The SEC is adamant that many cryptocurrencies should be treated as securities and therefore regulated under the purview of the SEC although SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has acknowledged previously that Bitcoin is not a security.\n\n\"I thought that maybe they would be recognizing that they've gotta compete with the rest of the world,\" Draper told Bloomberg, adding that regulators are \"driving all the great entrepreneurs out.\"\n\nBut Draper believes that Bitcoin is here to stay for the long haul and that one day it will eventually become an everyday currency that will soon be more broadly accepted by retailers, which he thinks can reap many benefits from using the payments technology.\n\n\"I can't wait until I can raise a fund all in Bitcoin, invest it all in Bitcoin, have my portfolio companies paid in Bitcoin, and have taxes all paid in Bitcoin, and have the waterfall all fall into people's Bitcoin wallets,\" Draper said.\n\nWill Draper's prediction come true?\n\nObviously, Draper is not the first notable investor to predict that Bitcoin will rise significantly, but he certainly does have a tremendous track record of anticipating future trends. He's also clearly got skin in the game.\n\nI would agree with Draper that Bitcoin is here to stay, and I've said previously that it merits some exposure in one's portfolio, given that it does have a history of rising when the dollar drops and during difficult periods for the banking sector.\n\nHowever, I have no price prediction for the digital asset and am still unclear if everyone will be using it as a currency one day. Cryptocurrencies are hard to value as an asset, but given the continued adoption of Bitcoin in the mainstream financial system, I do envision a future with Bitcoin."

        "title": "Bitcoin dips over weekend, other top 10 cryptos mixed; US stock futures edge down - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Having slipped over the weekend, Bitcoin rose to trade at over US$30,300 on Monday morning in Asia. The price has now reverted to around the level posted last Thursday \u2014 prior to XRP issuer Ripple\u2019s favorable ruling in its lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The partial victory led to significant gains for a number of top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, with XRP still leading the gains. U.S. stock futures edged lower as investors await earnings reports from major banks.\n\nBitcoin falls back\n\nBitcoin edged up 0.05% over the last 24 hours to US$30,332.54 as of 06:30 a.m. in Hong Kong for a weekly gain of 0.65%, according to data from CryptoMarketCap.\n\nHowever, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency was trading at around US$31,300 early Saturday morning. Following that weekend high, the token\u2019s price reverted to roughly its pre-Ripple ruling level.\n\nIn a summary judgment Thursday, New York Southern District Court Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple\u2019s programmatic sales of the XRP token on public exchanges do not constitute securities. The regulator first sued the San Francisco-based financial technology firm on the grounds that XRP constitutes a security in 2020.\n\nThe ruling was deemed something of a partial victory for Ripple, however, as the court ruled that XRP sales to institutional investors did violate securities laws.\n\n\u201cThere will be further court proceedings on that part \u2026 It is also not yet known if the SEC will appeal to the ruling,\u201d said Caroline Bowler, CEO of Australia-based crypto exchange BTC Markets, in emailed comments. Therefore, there remains the \u201cpotential for more insecurity ahead for Ripple,\u201d Bowler added.\n\nNonetheless, Ripple Labs\u2019 XRP led the gainers Monday morning in Asia. It rose 5.58% to US$0.7577 for a weekly surge of 61.56%.\n\nMeanwhile, the SEC has added BlackRock\u2019s application for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) to its official docket. That decision means that the regulator will now review the proposal in a serious manner.\n\nStory continues\n\nBlackrock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager with over US$9 trillion in assets, filed the application a little less than a month ago. The move saw the token\u2019s value breach the US$31,000 resistance level earlier this month as multiple major asset managers followed suit with similar ETF proposals.\n\nEther also gained 0.20% to US$1,934.09, rising 3.81% in the past seven days.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were mixed. The day\u2019s biggest losses were logged by Dogecoin, which dipped 2.53% to US$0.07. However, the token still recorded gains of 6.89% for the week.\n\nCardano\u2019s ADA also fell 2.52% to US$0.3185, limiting the coin\u2019s weekly gain to 12.08%. Similarly, Binance\u2019s BNB lost 2.43% to US$244.95. It is nonetheless trading at 4.68% higher than a week ago.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization rose 0.16% in the past 24 hours to US$1.22 trillion, while trading volume fell 11.97% to US$24.91 billion.\n\nToken-gated access for the super-rich and The Flash via NFT\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the main Forkast 500 NFT index edged up 0.50% in the past 24 hours to 2,736.37 as of 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. However, the index is down 0.40% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Solana and Cardano NFT market indices also moved higher, while the Ethereum and Polygon indices dropped.\n\n\u201cNFTs continue to ride the wave of positive news and positive prices in crypto,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. \u201cHowever we\u2019re not seeing any noteworthy gains in projects and instead most of the big names are still down for the past 7 days.\u201d\n\nThat is despite some large CryptoPunk and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) sales in the past week. Those sales included BAYC #1734, which sold for $1.2m (600ETH), CryptoPunk #8531 for $1m (550 ETH), and CryptoPunk #9476 for $403k (217.5 ETH).\n\n\u201cBig sales sometimes trickle liquidity to other projects, but in this case, the seller may be pocketing their gains or investing in crypto, where opportunities seem brighter at the moment,\u201d Petscher said.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, the total NFT transaction volume dipped 10.93% to US$16.58 million, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nImmutableX\u2019s Gods Unchained Cards, the collection of NFTs used in Immutable\u2019s trading card game of the same name, topped the 24-hour transaction volume, despite edging down 0.43% to US$690,896.\n\nEthereum-based NFT staple BAYC placed second in Cryptoslam\u2019s collections ranking. Its total transaction volume rose 1.34% to US$660,415 in the past 24 hours. Bored Ape creator Yuga Labs announced last week that it will hold ApeFest \u2014 a celebratory event of its successful NFT collections \u2014 in Hong Kong in November.\n\nApeFest is going global.\n\nHong Kong.\n\nNov 3-5, 2023.https://t.co/Fxgb7RuVek pic.twitter.com/X2QVVd7Qxr \u2014 Bored Ape Yacht Club (@BoredApeYC) July 13, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, non-blockchain sectors are also displaying increased NFT activity. .\n\nIndosuez, the global wealth management subsidiary of major French bank Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, launched a private NFT membership club last week named Le Clu3. The club will cater to super-rich clients by offering token-gated access to secret sections of its website, among other otherwise off-limits experiences. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole had roughly US$2.712 trillion in assets under management in 2022.\n\nElsewhere, Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. \u2014 the American entertainment conglomerate with over US$30 billion in market capitalization \u2014 has announced that it will launch its upcoming superhero film \u201cThe Flash\u201d via NFT.

Digital Collectibles (@WarnerBrosNFT) July 14, 2023\n\nStock futures reflect positive investor sentiment\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures edged down by less than 0.1% as of 11:50 a.m. in Hong Kong after the three major U.S. indexes closed mixed in regular Friday trading.\n\nThe three indexes all rose by around 2% to 3% last week. Following the latest release of U.S. inflation data on July 12, which came in softer than expected, investors are hopeful that the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s extended round of interest rate hikes may soon draw to a close.\n\nHowever, Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at London-based brokerage firm FxPro, believes that recent positive investor sentiment may backfire.\n\n\u201cThe Fed has made sharp reversals before, but always after a spike in market volatility,\u201d Kuptsikevich said. \u201cSteadily rising stock prices are more likely to spur the central bank to tighten monetary policy further,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Fed is still looking to add more to its current interest rate of 5% to 5.25%. Christopher Waller, a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, said last week at an event hosted by New York University that the central bank will need to enact two more 25-basis-point rate increases this year to tame inflation.\n\n\u201cThe robust strength of the labor market and the solid overall performance of the U.S. economy gives us room to tighten policy further,\u201d Waller said during the speech.\n\n\u201cIf inflation does not continue to show progress and there are no suggestions of a significant slowdown in economic activity, then a second 25-basis-point hike should come sooner rather than later, but that decision is for the future,\u201d Waller continued.\n\nThe Federal Reserve meets on July 26 to discuss its next move on rates. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 96.1% chance the Fed will enact a 25-basis-point rate increase this month, up from 92.4% on Friday.\n\nLast week\u2019s earnings reports from major U.S. banks JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup added to the increasingly hopeful market sentiment. Investors now await reports from financial heavyweights including the Bank of America Corporation, Morgan Stanley & Co. and The Goldman Sachs Group. Earnings reports from Netflix, Tesla and United Airlines are also due Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, major stock indexes across Asia fell on Monday as China posted lower-than-expected economic growth of 6.3% for Q2. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Japan\u2019s Nikkei and South Korea\u2019s Kospi all posted losses as of 12:00 p.m. in Hong Kong.\n\n(Updates to add equity section)"

While it is an initial step in a lengthy regulatory journey, it signals the SEC\u2019s readiness to explore the idea of a spot Bitcoin ETF and assess its potential market effects.\n\nETFs are investment funds that typically follow specific indexes and are commonly traded on exchanges. In the realm of cryptocurrencies, a fund that mirrors the value of one or multiple digital tokens and comprises a variety of cryptocurrencies is known as a cryptocurrency ETF.\n\nOn Friday, July 14, the regulator announced that it is also in the process of reviewing applications for various funds, including Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, WisdomTree, VanEck and Invesco Galaxy.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s entry into the spot Bitcoin ETF race is significant due to its stature in the financial industry. Its filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF included an agreement for \u201csurveillance-sharing\u201d with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.\n\nRelated: Crypto will transcend international currencies \u2014 BlackRock CEO\n\nThe competition among companies vying to be the first to launch a Bitcoin ETF in the United States is seen by many as a positive development for the crypto industry.

        "content": "Cryptocurrency investors have been in a frenzy in recent weeks about the possible approval by the US financial regulator of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).\n\nSpot ETFs invest directly in underlying assets, typically stocks or bonds, at the current market price (spot price). They aim to replicate the performance of a specific index or asset class by holding a portfolio of the actual securities that make up the index.\n\nA wave of some of the world\u2019s largest asset managers, including BlackRock and Fidelity, have applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in last few weeks. However, the globally influential watchdog has said that all the recent filings have been inadequate.\n\nBut, like many others, I remain confident that a spot Bitcoin ETF is inevitable. The SEC is flexing its muscles, but it will be a matter of time. These multi trillion-dollar asset managers are, of course, amazingly-well connected. And there won\u2019t be just one company approved either, because this would imply that that regulator is a de facto \u2018kingmaker\u2019.\n\nIf I am right and we get a wave of approvals of ETFs, I am confident that crypto prices will skyrocket for four main reasons.\n\nFirst, a Bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly owning or trading the cryptocurrency. Such increased accessibility for both can lead to a larger pool of potential investors entering the market, driving up demand for Bitcoin.\n\nSecond, the introduction of a Bitcoin ETF will undoubtedly attract institutional investors who have strict regulatory requirements and risk management policies. They\u2019ll bring with them capital, expertise and clout.\n\nThird, ETFs are traded on established stock exchanges, providing liquidity and ease of trading. This liquidity will attract more traders and increase market efficiency, reducing price volatility. As such, increased liquidity and market efficiency can positively impact the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnd fourth, a Bitcoin ETF will generate significant mainstream attention and media coverage which will drive up demand and prices in the crypto market.\n\nSo, now we wait for the SEC approval. But with the influence and power of these financial titans, maybe it won\u2019t be for too long?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBy Nigel Green via CityAM\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Discover SCENE\n\nBlackRock's application to offer a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has been added to the official docket of the Securities and Exchange Commission as part of its proposed rule change process. The move, recorded late Thursday, advances the most closely-watched Bitcoin-related proposal to the SEC to date.\n\nThe application for the iShares Bitcoin Trust was filed nearly a month ago, prompting a new wave of optimism across the crypto market, and additional filings for spot Bitcoin ETFs from a number of other prominent players, including from firms like Invesco, Wisdom Tree, Bitwise, and Fidelity\u2014which saw its previous application rejected last year along with those from other contenders.\n\nWhen the SEC signaled last month that BlackRock's application was lacking, the company filed a revised application, adding a \"surveillance sharing\" clause that would involve the Coinbase crypto exchange monitoring and reporting possible illegal activity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSoon enough, Valkyrie updated its application with the same provision, as did Fidelity and ARK Invest.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF would track the value of Bitcoin without requiring the asset to be held directly. It would also be tradable on a traditional stock exchange.\n\nWhile a Bitcoin ETF based on Bitcoin futures launched to great fanfare earlier this year, a spot ETF\u2014which is tied to the current price of the cryptocurrency\u2014has been described as a \"holy grail\" for the industry. The SEC's continued resistance to approving one over the past several years has been described as a \"complete and utter disaster.\"\n\nWith BlackRock's application now on the SEC's official calendar, it will be published in the Federal Register and trigger a 21-day public comment period.\n\nMeanwhile, four other applications were docketed on Friday related to the Cboe BZX Exchange, which was the first entity to apply for a Bitcoin ETF in March 2021, They include the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust, VanEck Bitcoin Trust, and Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, which will also enter a three-week comment period.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Robert Kiyosaki, the author of several best-seller books, continues to display his support for bitcoin, gold, and silver above all other assets.\n\nIn his latest tweet on the matter, he praised the aforementioned three assets while warning that the rich will get richer in the wake of the US government\u2019s policies.\n\nSticking With BTC\n\nThe largest US stock market indexes registered some gains over the week, with the Dow jumping by over 3% and the S&P 500 by just shy of that percentage. The renowned author, businessman, and entrepreneur commented on the matter, as he believes these increases are only because of the removal of the US debt ceiling.\n\nRecall that the world\u2019s largest economy faced a major crisis until June when President Biden signed a bill that suspended the country\u2019s $31.4 trillion debt ceiling, thus avoiding the nation\u2019s first-ever default.\n\nKiyosaki, though, who recently predicted that BTC will tap $120,000 soon, believes the government\u2019s decision will only benefit the rich and harm America because the US national debt will increase, just like the stock market. As such, he doubled down on his support for what he referred to as \u201creal assets\u201d \u2013 bitcoin, silver, and gold.\n\nWHY is stock market taking off? Because \u201cDebt Ceiling\u201d removed. Means national debt to rise with stock market. Rich get richer as America gets poorer. Sad. Sticking with real money & real assets: Gold, Silver, Bitcoin. \u2014 Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) July 14, 2023\n\nBTC Vs. Gold Vs. Silver YTD\n\nAlthough Kiyosaki keeps praising the two precious metals as well as BTC, it\u2019s worth exploring their performance as of late, especially on a year-to-date basis.\n\nSilver entered the new year at $23,75 per ounce and jumped to over $26 at one point. However, it since retraced to $22 before climbing back to $24.9 to close on Friday, which gives it a modest 4.84% YTD increase.\n\nGold\u2019s performance has been rather identical as it started 2023 at $1,827 before it shot up to a yearly peak at $2,080 on May 4. However, it couldn\u2019t maintain its run and fell back down to $1,955 as of Friday\u2019s closing hours. As such, the yellow metal is up by 7% so far this year.\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, started the year on a positive note after the devastating 2022 bear market. It quickly surged from its January 1 price of $16,700 to over $20,000 and just this week tapped a 13-month peak at $31,850.\n\nDespite losing some ground and currently trading at $30,300, the cryptocurrency\u2019s YTD gains stand at just over 80%, making it the best-performing asset so far this year."

According to a tweet by on-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, the total fees collected on 14 July stood at $3.6 million, marking a 37.7% increase from the previous day.\n\n#Bitcoin fees dropped to their lowest since March, despite transaction activity rebounding pic.twitter.com/xT9VMYoXOP \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) July 14, 2023\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nInterestingly, the decline in fees came despite a sharp rebound in on-chain trading activity. As per the Glassnode chart below, transaction numbers witnessed a robust recovery in July after weeks of downtrend.\n\nIn fact, the transaction count last weekend reached its highest level since the BRC-20 euphoria of May. What could then possibly explain the dip in fees?\n\nBlock intervals dip\n\nThe period witnessing the surge in transaction count also saw a sharp uptick in the network hash rate. A growing hash rate is a positive development in the sense that it makes the network more decentralized and secured.\n\nHowever, a growing hash rate also reduces the rate at which new blocks are mined and added to the chain. As depicted below, the block interval significantly dipped as the hash rate soared. This meant that transactions could be processed quickly without people needing to bid up their fees to jump the line.\n\nAccording to Mempool data, the number of unconfirmed transactions in the queue at the time of writing was 259,652, a considerable decrease from the 465,000 seen in early May. A fee of $0.3 was being charged, ruling out prioritizing transactions.\n\nMiners\u2019 woes continue\n\nLow transaction fees over blockchain networks work in favor of users, especially when making low-value transactions. This bodes well for the widespread adoption of Bitcoin by retail users.\n\nOn the contrary, reduced fees adversely impacts miners\u2019 economics. Miners need to be incentivized to validate transactions and secure the Bitcoin network. They rely on these incentives to cover their hardware and electricity costs.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nBitcoin miners fought the punishing bear market of 2022 with tenacity, expecting to recoup their losses in 2023. However, after achieving yearly peaks in May, their earnings have significantly dried up."

        "content": "Bitcoin miners will face headwinds as the hash rate reaches new record highs ahead of the upcoming halving event next spring, with volatile electricity costs and competition among miners pushing up the cost of production, according to analysts at global financial giant JP Morgan.\n\nHash rate refers to the computational power used to mine a cryptocurrency. The halving event, which occurs roughly every four years, will reduce miners' rewards by half.\n\n\"The upcoming bitcoin halving event in April/May 2024 could be a stress test for Bitcoin miners,\" writes JP Morgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou and colleagues in the firm's latest Flows and Liquidity report, which the firm shared with Decrypt.\n\n\"[It] would reduce the issuance rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, implying a reduction in miners\u2019 revenue, effectively increasing Bitcoin\u2019s production cost at the same time,\" the report explains. \"As a result, while Bitcoin halving is seen as having a positive effect on the bitcoin price given the production cost acted historically as a floor, it poses a challenge for bitcoin miners.\"\n\nBerenberg Analysts: Bitcoin 'Could Rally' Near Next Year's Halving Event\n\nAccording to the analysis, and based on a global average cost of electricity of $0.05/kWh, it costs around $20,000 to mine a Bitcoin, which is currently worth around $30,000, per CoinGecko. But JP Morgan said the volatility of the hash rate points to the use of a variety of energy sources, meaning miners with access to lower-priced power have an advantage.\n\nIn fact, the company said, a one-cent increase in the cost per kilowatt hour translates to a $4,300 increase in the cost of Bitcoin production.\n\n\"Post halving this sensitivity would double to $8,600, thus increasing the vulnerability of higher-cost producers,\" the firm noted.\n\nThere has been some good news for miners, however.\n\nVanguard Now Owns $560 Million Worth of Bitcoin Mining Stocks\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Institutional interest in bitcoin mining has provided support to struggling miners, with investments in mining rigs from companies like Galaxy Digital and Grayscale Investments,\" it observed. Galaxy Digital recently acquired a major mining facility from Argo Blockchain, and Grayscale spun off an entity focused on Bitcoin mining hardware.\n\n\"Tether, the world largest stablecoin issuer, also plans an investment in a bitcoin mining site in El Salvador,\" according to the report.\n\nNonetheless, the price of Bitcoin and transaction fees will need to rise significantly to offset the lower block reward.\n\nJP Morgan also observed that \"the decline in hype surrounding cryptocurrencies poses an additional challenge for miners' revenues,\" including \"the decline in the hype around Ordinals.\"\n\nThe number of daily Ordinals inscriptions recently hit an all-time high, but Bitcoin fees did not sustain earlier highs along with them.\n\n\"Going forward, it seems unlikely that the Bitcoin hash rate will continue to rise at the same pace post the April/May 2024 halving event without any sustained rise in the Bitcoin price above its production cost or a large increase in transaction fees that could offset the reduction in issuance rewards,\" JP Morgan concluded."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) attempted to break away from its boring sideways price action on July 13, following Ripple\u2019s legal victory over the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, but the enthusiasm proved to be short-lived. Sellers pulled the price back into the range on July 14, indicating that they remain active at higher levels. However, a positive sign is that the bulls have kept Bitcoin\u2019s price above $30,000.\n\nMarket observers are expected to closely follow the review process for the various exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposals for a spot Bitcoin ETF, one of the most prominent being the proposal by BlackRock. Interestingly, out of 550 ETF applications by BlackRock, only one has been rejected, according to Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nEven as Bitcoin consolidates, waiting for its next catalyst, several altcoins are witnessing solid buying. This has pulled Bitcoin\u2019s market dominance below 50%, suggesting that the focus could be shifting to the altcoins in the near term.\n\nCould Bitcoin start a trending move in the short term, or will it remain stuck inside the range? What are the altcoins that are looking strong on the charts? Let\u2019s study the charts of the top-five cryptocurrencies that could be on traders' radar in the next few days.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin closed above $31,000 on July 13, but that proved to be a bull trap as the bears yanked the price back below the level on July 14. This shows that the bears are fiercely defending the zone between $31,000 and $32,400.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe price action of the past few days has formed a bearish divergence on the relative strength index (RSI). This indicates a weakening bullish momentum. The bears will try to build upon their advantage by pulling the price below the 20-day exponential moving average ($30,187). If they manage to do that, the BTC/USDT pair could descend to the 50-day simple moving average ($28,631).\n\nIf bulls want to prevent the decline, they will have to quickly push and sustain the price above $31,000. The pair could then climb to $32,400. A break and close above this level will clear the path for a potential run to $40,000 as there are no major resistances in between.\n\nBTC/USDT four-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe pair has dropped below the moving averages on the four-hour chart, indicating that demand dries up at higher levels. The bears will have to sink and sustain the price below $29,500 to start a deeper correction. The pair could then plummet to $27,500.\n\nAlternatively, the bulls will have to push and sustain the price above $31,000 to start an up-move toward $32,400. If the price turns down from $32,400 but rebounds off $31,000, it will suggest that the bulls have flipped the level into support. The pair may then start a rally to $40,000.\n\nUniswap price analysis\n\nUniswap (UNI) has been taking support at the 20-day EMA ($5.41) during pullbacks, indicating that the sentiment has turned positive and traders are buying the dips.\n\nUNI/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls will try to buy the current dip and push the price above the immediate resistance at $6.16. If they can pull it off, the UNI/USDT pair could rise to $6.50. This level may again act as a strong resistance, but if bulls do not give up much ground, the pair could reach $6.70.\n\nThe important support to watch on the downside is the 20-day EMA. A break and close below this level will suggest that the bears are back in the game. The pair may then fall to the 50-day SMA ($5) and later to the crucial support at $4.72.\n\nUNI/USDT four-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe correction on the four-hour chart has reached the 20-day EMA. This is the first important support to watch out for. If the price rebounds off this level, the pair could retest the overhead resistance at $6.17. Above this level, the pair may climb to the resistance line of the ascending channel.\n\nContrarily, if the price slips below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the short-term traders may be booking profits. That could pull the price down to the support line of the channel. If this level cracks, the pair may slide to $5.08.\n\nArbitrum price analysis\n\nArbitrum (ARB) broke and closed above the symmetrical triangle pattern on July 15, indicating that the bulls have overpowered the bears.\n\nARB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($1.16) has turned up and the RSI has reached near the overbought zone, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the upside. There is a minor resistance at $1.36, but if that level is crossed, the ARB/USDT pair may surge to $1.50. This level may again pose a strong challenge, but if bulls overcome it, the rally may extend to $1.70.\n\nThis positive view will invalidate in the near term if the price turns down and plummets below the support line of the triangle. That may trap several aggressive bulls, resulting in a sharp drop to $0.90.\n\nARB/USDT four-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls successfully held the retest of the breakout level from the symmetrical triangle, indicating that lower levels are attracting buyers. The bulls will try to build upon this strength by driving the price above $1.36. If they succeed, the pair may pick up momentum.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down from the current level or $1.36, the bulls will again try to drag the pair back into the triangle. If they do that, it will suggest that the recent breakout may have been a bull trap. The pair could then drop to the 50-day SMA and, subsequently, to the support line of the triangle.\n\nRelated: Buying the dip? Record 3.8% of the Bitcoin supply last moved at $30.2K\n\nAave price analysis\n\nAave (AAVE) broke and closed above the descending channel pattern on July 3. The bulls successfully held the retest of the breakout level on July 6 and again on July 10. This shows that the bulls flipped the resistance line into support.\n\nAAVE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe rising 20-day EMA ($72) and the RSI in the positive territory indicate that the bulls are in command. If the price turns up from the current level or bounces off the 20-day EMA, it will enhance the prospects of a rally above $84.50. The AAVE/USDT pair could then rally to $95.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls may be losing their grip. The bears will then again try to tug the price back into the descending channel.\n\nAAVE/USDT four-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bulls pushed the price above the overhead resistance of $84.50, but they could not sustain the breakout. The bears sold at higher levels and pulled the price back below the 20-day EMA.\n\nBoth moving averages have flattened out and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand.\n\nIf the price breaks below the 50-day SMA, the advantage may shift in favor of the bears. The pair could then slide to $68. The advantage will shift in favor of the bulls if they maintain the price above $84.50.\n\nMaker price analysis\n\nMaker (MKR) broke above the downtrend line on July 2 and successfully retested the level on July 14. The bounce off this support suggests strong demand at lower levels.\n\nMKR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($878) and the RSI in the positive zone signal that bulls are in control. Buyers are attempting to resume the up-move but may face stiff resistance near $1,100. If bulls clear this hurdle, the MKR/USDT pair may soar to $1,200.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down from $1,080, it will suggest that bears continue to sell on rallies. The pair could then slump to the 20-day EMA. A break below this level will suggest that the bears are trying a comeback.\n\nMKR/USDT four-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bulls have pushed the price above the resistance line, indicating that the short-term correction may be over. The price may dip to the resistance line, which is an important level to keep an eye on.\n\nA strong rebound off this level will suggest that the bulls have flipped the resistance line into support. That will improve the possibility of a break above $1,080.\n\nThis positive view could invalidate in the near term if the price plummets below the moving averages. That could sink the pair to $831.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
