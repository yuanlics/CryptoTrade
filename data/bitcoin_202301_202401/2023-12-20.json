        "title": "Bitcoin mining energy use doubled in 2023 as crypto prices rose - S&P Global",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency mining rigs use large amounts of energy to cool and operate.\n\nSource: South_agency/E+ via Getty Images.\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal energy consumption from bitcoin mining has grown 101% since Jan. 1 to reach 141.2 TWh as of Dec. 20, according to data from Digiconomist, a platform managed by Dutch economist and blockchain expert Alex de Vries.\n\nThe US is one of the largest bitcoin miners in the world, a separate analysis by the University of Cambridge estimated.\n\nThe rise in power demand reflects a rebound in bitcoin prices from a low of $16,611 on Jan. 1 to top $44,000 on Dec. 20. Observers attribute the rise in prices to the Federal Reserve signaling an end to rate increases and investors anticipating a bitcoin exchange-traded fund getting approval from US regulators in 2024, among other things.\n\n\"There's a very direct relationship between prices and electricity consumption,\" de Vries said in an interview. \"The more the value of the resource goes up, the more the miners are paid and the more they mine.\"\n\nAs bitcoin prices continue to move higher by the day, de Vries predicted, the industry's footprint will likely grow even more before the end of the year. But he stressed that the trajectory can change suddenly, if bitcoin's turbulent history is any indication.\n\nThe global crypto mining industry currently consumes as much electricity annually as Ukraine, Digiconomist estimated, and emits 78.7 million metric tons of CO 2 per year, as much as the nation of Oman.\n\nEnvironmental impacts are not limited to the energy the industry consumed from power plants burning fossil fuels. A paper de Vries published in late November in the journal Cell Reports Sustainability analyzed water usage from cooling power plants that produce electricity for bitcoin mining and water used to cool mining datacenters.\n\nAs mining continues to grow, the total US water use in 2023 could reach the equivalent of 27 billion gallons, the study estimated. That is about what Washington, DC, households use in a year, it said.\n\nLawmakers react\n\nBitcoin mining companies use powerful computers housed in sprawling datacenters to verify, process and record cryptocurrency transactions. A single bitcoin transaction using the \"proof-of-work\" process today requires 705 kWh of electricity, according to Digiconomist. By comparison, Ethereum uses 0.02 kWh after switching to a new approach in September 2022 known as \"proof of stake,\" cutting energy use 99%.\n\nNew York in 2022 imposed a two-year moratorium on bitcoin mining over concerns that the industry was using up too much of the state's renewable energy resources. Members of Congress have also voiced concerns over the industry's impact.\n\nA bill reintroduced by Senate Democrats in March called on the US Environmental Protection Agency to issue a rulemaking requiring cryptocurrency mining operations that use more than 5 MW of power annually and emit greenhouse gas emissions exceeding 25,000 metric tons to monitor and report such emissions. The bill never made it out of committee.\n\nThe same month, Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas) sponsored an opposite resolution declaring that \"energy development should be a key pillar to the growth of the United States economy, infrastructure, and national security, and Proof-of-Work mining can help develop advancements in all of these sectors.\"\n\nIndustry lobbyists weigh in\n\nBy August, the bitcoin mining industry had established an advocacy group in Washington, the Digital Energy Council, with a message that digital asset mining can help stabilize the electric grid. In October, another trade group, the Digital Power Network, lobbied Congress in support of Sessions' resolution.\n\n\"We met with nearly 40 members of Congress from both sides of the aisle, sharing tangible, real-world examples that underscore how the bitcoin mining industry is playing a pivotal role in advancing America's energy security in four significant ways: grid stability, national security, decarbonization and sustainability,\" Perianne Boring, CEO of the Chamber of Digital Commerce and organizer of the network's lobbying event, said in a release at the time.\n\nThe industry is also pointing to miners that invest in their own renewable energy sources to power datacenters, or that employ underutilized power sources that might otherwise go to waste. In Texas, the epicenter of US bitcoin mining, companies also take advantage of the state's demand response programs to help conserve energy during peak demand.\n\nRiot Platforms Inc., the largest bitcoin miner operating in Texas, collected $49.6 million in power curtailment credits from Texas during the third quarter, more than it made from mining, the company reported.\n\nTo date, however, no independent analysis has shown that the industry is getting greener or shrinking its carbon footprint, de Vries said.\n\nS&P Global Commodity Insights produces content for distribution on S&P Capital IQ Pro."

        "content": "On the surface, Bathhouse is a classic Brooklyn wellness hangout. The city\u2019s spa-ficionados make the trek to Williamsburg and pay upwards of $45 a day to soak in its pools, relax in its saunas, and socialize with other peak performers.\n\nBut beneath the wellness oasis lies a hidden operation: a dozen Bitcoin mining units are churning away 24/7 to power the spa\u2019s two heated pools.\n\nInside the 11,000-square-foot refurbished factory, Bathhouse began its pre-crypto days in 2019 with three thermal pools (one hot, one tepid, one cold), two saunas, a steam room, and two hammams\u2014heated marble stones for patrons to lay on. The permanently toasty environment translates to a whole lot of energy use.\n\n\u201cOur ConEd bill kind of makes us want to throw up,\u201d Bathhouse cofounder Travis Talmadge recently told Fortune.\n\nBathhouse began mining Bitcoin on its premises in 2021, using miners as \u201cfancy pool heaters\u201d to generate cryptocurrency in addition to heat. Miners now power its two heated pools using residual heat.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re basically in the heat-delivery business, or that\u2019s a big portion of what we do,\u201d Talmadge said. \u201cThe ability to pull heat off of mining Bitcoin made all the sense in the world\u2014like we get a rebate for the energy that we buy.\u201d\n\nFrom dingy to designer\n\nTalmadge met his cofounder, Jason Goodman, in 2014 thanks to a serendipitous Airbnb booking. Talmadge was vacationing at a property Goodman owned in Montauk, and the pair struck up a friendship over campfire hangouts on the beach.\n\nGoodman had been going to New York City bathhouses for post-gym recovery for years, and was mulling over starting one of his own. In 2016, Talmadge tagged along on one of his visits\u2014and became an instant convert. \u201cI get it now,\u201d he remembers saying.\n\nGoodman and Talmadge, who have backgrounds in real estate and in institutional brokerage, respectively, loved the communal wellness experience but were frustrated by the \u201cdingy\u201d quality of some bathhouses. They saw an opportunity to update the 5,000-year-old tradition for a modern crowd.\n\n\u201cNobody was doing it from a place of New York City\u2019s best hospitality standards, and from a place of modern design standards,\u201d Goodman said.\n\nDown the rabbit hole\n\nWhile considering various ways to \u201ctrim the fat\u201d of the business\u2014particularly its \u201cstaggering\u201d $20,000-per-month energy bill\u2014Goodman and Talmadge each developed an interest in cryptocurrency, which Goodman chased down several YouTube rabbit holes.\n\nIn mid-2021, he came across a video of a man in middle America who had figured out how to heat his pool by mining Bitcoin. He sent the video to Talmadge with no additional context. \u201cOh my God, this makes the most sense in the world,\u201d Talmadge remembers thinking.\n\nThey started running experiments with two miners made from off-the-shelf parts from Home Depot, PlumbingSupply.com, and DCX. In late 2021, they scaled up the operation to power the two heated pools in Bathhouse\u2019s Williamsburg location using 12 Bitcoin miners that generate about 1,200 terahashes per second.\n\nAt Bathhouse\u2019s location in the Flatiron District that\u2019s set to open in the new year, all four hot pools and three hammams will be heated by 14 bigger, better Bitcoin miners at a 2,600-terahash-per-second rate.\n\nBack to ASICs\n\nBathhouse uses off-the-shelf ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuit)\u2014essentially computers designed specifically for Bitcoin mining. \u201cThey have a huge problem\u2014they have to dump heat,\u201d Goodman said.\n\nAt Bathhouse, Goodman and Talmadge converted the miners for immersion cooling instead of air-cooling. \u201cWe strip the fans off, we put them in a special dielectric fluid,\u201d Talmadge explains. \u201cAnd so now, instead of that heat going into the air or being hot to touch on your computer, it\u2019s much more powerful than that. It goes and heats the oil around it, and then you pull that heat out eventually on a heat exchanger.\u201d\n\nThe heat exchanger on the tank has four ports: hot oil in, cold oil out, cold water in, and hot water out. The water from the \u201chot water out\u201d port runs in a loop from the heat exchangers on the mining tanks to the heat exchangers in the pool plumbing, recycling the energy used by the miners to heat the water in the pools.\n\nCourtesy of Bathhouse\n\nBull market\n\nGoodman and Talmadge say Bathhouse\u2019s energy bills have not changed much compared to the pre-crypto days.\n\n\u201cWe have to buy this energy anyway,\u201d Talmadge said. \u201cWhereas before, we got just heat out of it. Now we\u2019re getting heat, and we\u2019re getting assets.\u201d\n\nBathhouse does not have any plans to sell the Bitcoin it mines. Instead, proceeds are stored in self-custody as the property of the company.\n\n\u201cWe are not trying to recover our energy costs necessarily with Bitcoin,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cWe want to treasury the Bitcoin because we\u2019re long-term believers in Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nMoral compass\n\nIn June, Bathhouse posted an Instagram Reel explaining its mining process. Users flocked to the comment section, voicing their concerns about the environmental impact of mining cryptocurrency and asking Bathhouse for more transparency. Bitcoin is estimated to consume 127 terawatt-hours (TWh) of energy a year\u2014more than some countries, including Norway, according to the Rocky Mountain Institute.\n\n\u201cI think this is an important topic,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cWho decides which use of energy is moral, and which use of energy is not moral? Why is a pool heater a moral use of energy and a Bitcoin miner not?\u201d\n\nGoodman and Talmadge pointed to the massive amounts of energy used by internet servers, the stock market, and even mobile phones\u2014and reiterated that Bathhouse is buying the same amount of energy as it did before it began mining Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cI would argue that Bitcoin is a very moral use of energy,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cBecause having fair and equitable money is a very important thing for society.\u201d\n\nTo the moon\n\nGoodman and Talmadge hope to see more businesses mine cryptocurrency on their premises. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of use cases for this,\u201d Talmadge said. \u201cYou could heat all the domestic hot water in a building with Bitcoin miners. Hotels, anybody with big pools.\u201d\n\nFollowing the opening of its new 36,500-square-foot location in the Flatiron District, where a day pass will cost $70 on weekdays and $85 on weekends, Bathhouse has plans to expand to Chicago and other cities. And yes, they\u2019ll be bringing the Bitcoin miners with them.\n\n\u201cOur plan is to continue building great bathhouses, continue heating our pools by recycling heat from mining operations, continue to treasury that,\u201d said Goodman. \u201cTo go along for the ride.\u201d"

        "title": "SEC could make crypto history in new year with first spot bitcoin ETF approval - Fox Business",
        "content": "Big money management firms are growing increasingly confident that the Securities and Exchange Commission will make crypto history in early January by approving the first \"spot\" bitcoin exchange-traded fund, FOX Business has learned.\n\nSources close to these firms say recent guidance from SEC officials is that a green light will likely come by Jan. 10, 2024. This is the final deadline for the SEC to approve or deny an application from the first firm to ask for the SEC\u2019s blessing for a spot bitcoin ETF: Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Investment Management in partnership with 21Shares.\n\nAll told, about a dozen companies, including Wall Street asset-management titans like BlackRock and Fidelity, have applied for a spot bitcoin ETF, or one that is valued off the real-time price of the digital asset.\n\nVALKYRIE INVESTMENTS FIRST TO OFFER ETHER FUTURES THROUGH ETF\n\nPeople at these firms believe the SEC could approve several applications at once. An SEC spokesman had no comment.\n\nIf approval does come, as many expect, it will mark a major step toward the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency in the U.S., something that Wall Street\u2019s top cop, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, has been reluctant to endorse until recently when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a ruling that scaled back his authority in regulating crypto.\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF would give retail investors greater exposure to the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency at less cost than the already approved bitcoin ETF priced off the futures market. Moreover, investors can get exposure to bitcoin and avoid going to an unregulated exchange by purchasing an ETF through highly regulated money management firms while trading occurs on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq stock market.\n\nOne downside for investors includes an unusual demand from the SEC in the way the ETFs are structured. In meetings with the big money management firms, the SEC is insisting that applicants use cash to buy shares of the ETF, and cannot use the underlying asset, which in this case is bitcoin.\n\nRAMASWAMY WOOS PRO-CRYPTO VOTERS, SAYS HE\u2019LL BUILD NEW POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR DIGITAL ASSETS\n\nConventional ETFs allow so-called \"in-kind\" transactions \u2013 which means market makers would be allowed to exchange bitcoin for ETF shares. The \"cash create\" route means ETF issuers will have to exchange bitcoin for cash on every transaction \u2013 a longer and more complicated process that requires the issuers themselves to buy the bitcoin, not the broker-dealers.\n\nSecurities lawyers say another disadvantage of cash creation is that investors would be robbed of an important tax advantage; \"in kind\" purchases are not a taxable event, but selling Bitcoin for cash before the ETF purchase would be.\n\nSeveral spot bitcoin ETF applicants such as Grayscale are hesitant to give up the fight for in-kind creations. In a meeting with the SEC on Tuesday, Grayscale told the agency it believes offering both in-kind and cash creations and redemptions are in the best interest of investors because it supports \"a deeper, more robust primary market, resulting in a more efficient ETP market structure.\"\n\nCash creation essentially shifts the burden of trading bitcoin from professional trading firms to the authorized participants (APs) such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs,\" said Dave Weisberger, CoinRoutes co-CEO. \"This means less competition between issuers and performance will be based on which issuer has the better resources and trading strategy.\"\n\nWeisberger says the SEC is insisting on cash redemption over in-kind because the agency doesn\u2019t currently allow broker-dealers such as Robinhood and Fidelity to trade spot bitcoin directly.\n\nIt is not immediately clear why the agency continues to block brokers from trading spot bitcoin, but Weisberger believes it has a lot to do with the political tension around digital assets from members of Congress. One explanation from people meeting with the SEC is that the commission is worried about the use of bitcoin for money laundering, market manipulation and other illegal purposes.\n\nOne former SEC official blames it on Gensler\u2019s general dislike of digital assets, thus he\u2019s looking to put a \"drag\" on the new crypto product. Gensler still has not provided total clarity about bitcoin\u2019s actual status, whether it\u2019s a lightly regulated commodity or a security like a stock or bond that demands the commission\u2019s full regulatory attention. Ditto for the second-most popular crypto, ethereum. In the past, Gensler has said that most other digital coins are considered securities, though while SEC chair he\u2019s remained mum on the matter.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest money manager, BlackRock, with $9 trillion in assets under management, has made receiving SEC approval for its proposed bitcoin ETF a key corporate priority, FOX Business has learned. Larry Fink, BlackRock\u2019s founder and CEO, has referred to bitcoin as \"an international asset\" and a \"store of value\" rivaling the long-held status of gold.\n\nBitcoin, which started the year at just 16,000, has since surged back up over $40,000, spiking 65% in the past 3 months.\n\nBlackRock, which has more than 400 traditional ETFs on the market, has met with the SEC five times regarding its spot bitcoin ETF application, the most recent of which occurred on Tuesday. SEC staffers have held around 24 meetings with various ETF hopefuls, signaling to the industry that the agency is doubling down to get these ETFs to market in the new year.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nOf course, the SEC could deny all the applications, but industry officials are giving it low odds. The reason: In August, the D.C. Court of Appeals vacated the SEC\u2019s denial of crypto asset manager Grayscale\u2019s application to convert its GBTC Trust into a spot bitcoin ETF. The three-judge panel went on to call the SEC\u2019s actions \"arbitrary and capricious.\"\n\nThe ruling is seen as a significant precedent that money managers seeking the spot bitcoin ETF will rely on if the SEC rebuffs their applications."

        "title": "Unveiling the factors impacting bitcoin's price - Omaha World-Herald",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency has emerged as a promising investment channel for traders, entrepreneurs, and investors alike. However, volatility remains the hallmark of the crypto market, making it challenging for even seasoned investors to assess the price swings of digital currencies. The giant cryptocurrency Bitcoin is no exception here. Deciphering the value of Bitcoin poses its challenges, but experts propose that staying vigilant about factors influencing the digital currency's worth can yield insights. Let's delve into the intricacies of Bitcoin to better understand the question \"What is the price of Bitcoin?\" and assess its potential valuation.\n\nSupply and Demand\n\nThe fundamental economic principle of supply and demand forms the core of Bitcoin's price determination. With a limited supply of 21 million, Bitcoin can create a scarcity factor that will, in turn, influence its market price. When more investors flock to own this decentralized digital gold, the demand for Bitcoin soars. On the contrary, when the demand dwindles, the price also experiences a corresponding decline.\n\nThe scarcity of Bitcoin, despite its growing popularity as a digital asset, can affect the supply and demand dynamics of the currency. Investors, closely tracking these fluctuations, gauge market sentiment to make informed decisions. This makes the supply and demand of Bitcoin a delicate equilibrium that shapes its valuation.\n\nCost of Production\n\nBitcoin mining is the process through which new Bitcoins are created and transactions are verified. What is the price of Bitcoin? The cost of production includes expenses such as electricity, hardware, and maintenance. These expenses determine the minimum threshold at which miners are willing to sell their newly minted bitcoins. When the market price dips below this threshold, miners are likely to slow down, potentially constraining the supply to create an upward curve of Bitcoin price.\n\nDuring bullish market conditions, the price of Bitcoin surpasses the cost of production. In such a scenario, miners are incentivized to accelerate their activities to meet the overall supply. This intricate balance between production costs and market value can directly impact Bitcoin price.\n\nAvailability on Exchanges\n\nCrypto exchanges act as the marketplace for crypto buyers and sellers where the ease of trading impacts liquidity and price discovery. This is where Bitcoin price can be impacted based on its availability in various cryptocurrency exchanges. Popular platforms like CNN Money, Financial Times, Binance, and Investopedia have contributed significantly to the market dynamics of Bitcoin.\n\nWith the surging demands of Bitcoin, its availability on these exchanges becomes a crucial factor. Limited availability in such market conditions can trigger prices as buyers compete for the finite supply. On the other hand, more than adequate availability can lead to price stabilization or even corrections. Traders tracking exchange dynamics will scrutinize order books and liquidity levels, often leading them to ask, \"What is the price of Bitcoin at present, and what will it be in the coming months?\"\n\nCrypto exchanges also act as the gateway to the world of digital assets. Apart from providing liquidity and accessibility to Bitcoins, these platforms also act as trendsetters, introducing new assets and advanced trading features that impact market sentiment and influence investors' decisions. Inclusions, such as listing new tokens or integrating innovative technologies, can spike Bitcoin's price as it facilitates the trading of giant currencies on the platform.\n\nCompetition with other Cryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin might have dominated the crypto space for a while, but even this giant currency faces stiff competition from numerous altcoins. Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin vie for market share and investor attention. The competitive environment directly influences Bitcoin's price as investors try to allocate funds across different digital assets to minimize risks.\n\nRecent advancements in blockchain technology and the introduction of several new crypto projects can divert attention and funds away from Bitcoin. This can dwindle its market dominance, affecting Bitcoin's valuation.\n\nGovernance and Regulatory Policies\n\nThe regulatory landscape can significantly influence the price of Bitcoin. As there are no globally accepted regulations on crypto transactions, Government policies, legal frameworks, and country-specific regulatory decisions can impact the adoption and acceptance of Bitcoin. Clarity in regulatory frameworks provides a sense of security to investors and financial institutions, leading the cryptocurrency to thrive.\n\nSimilarly, uncertainty or restrictive regulations can decline Bitcoin acceptance, leading to increased volatility and price swings. The regulatory backdrop is a critical factor that directly or indirectly influences all other factors that determine the price of Bitcoin.\n\nSeveral factors determine Bitcoin's price while also impacting the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. Supply and demand dynamics, production costs, exchange availability, competition, governance, and regulatory framework form the basic analytical factors that have the potential to influence Bitcoin's price. As investors and crypto enthusiasts continue to invest in Bitcoin, closely examining all these factors can help them make informed decisions to minimize financial risks.\n\nInformation is intended for educational purposes only and is not to be used as investment advice.

        "content": "Despite recent hype surrounding Bitcoin and spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs_, JPMorgan believes that Ethereum will outperform Bitcoin in 2024.\n\nIn a Dec. 13 report, JPMorgan analysts wrote, \"We believe that next year Ethereum will reassert itself and recapture market share within the crypto ecosystem.\"\n\nThe analysts reason that the Ethereum EIP-4844 upgrade, also known as the Proto-Danksharding upgrade, is expected to take place during the first half of 2024 and is part of a multistep plan to make sharding more efficient on the Ethereum chain.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThough the process is complex, the idea is that it will allow shards to be analyzed in larger groups instead of a system that splits Ethereum into several shard chains. This upgrade will have a significant impact on Layer 2 solutions such as Polygon and Optimism. This is because it will allow these projects to have more access to network power, which will increase throughput and reduce transaction costs.\n\nJPMorgan believes that these upgrades will bring more investors to Ethereum and cause it to regain market share in the crypto sphere.\n\nJPMorgan is not saying that the price of Ethereum will appreciate. The analysts are \"cautious\" about crypto markets in 2024. They see Ethereum as one of the stronger tokens for 2024. While it may not go up in price, they still believe that it will perform better than other tokens, specifically Bitcoin.\n\nTrending: This brokerage offers custom rewards for users to switch \u2013 the biggest reward so far for 1 user is $19,977.48. Will yours beat it?\n\nDespite recent hype around spot Bitcoin ETF approvals and the upcoming Bitcoin halving, JPMorgan is still more bullish on ETH. The analysts believe that the spot Bitcoin ETFs are already priced in. Since approval seems imminent, they believe that markets have already priced in the impact this will have on Bitcoin. They cite the recent Bitcoin run-up as evidence for this.\n\nStory continues\n\nThey also think that the upcoming Bitcoin halving is already priced in. They looked at the ratio of Bitcoin's market price to production cost and saw that it decreased after the most recent halving in 2020. They expect a similar move will follow in 2024.\n\nOther topics discussed in the report revolved around their lack of confidence in decentralized finance (DeFi). They have not seen noticeable impacts of DeFi on the current financial system.\n\n\"The biggest applications of blockchain to traditional finance, i.e. overnight repo transactions via smart contracts in blockchain platforms hosted by companies such as Broadridge and JPMorgan, take place outside public blockchains,\" the analysts said. They also discussed interoperability and central bank digital currencies.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article JPMorgan Says Ethereum Will Outperform Bitcoin In 2024 originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2023 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Bitcoin BTC -5.73% broke through the $44,000 mark for the first time in more than a week on Wednesday, rising by 4% over the past 24 hours. Coinglass data shows the break-out caused over $33 million in BTC short liquidations in the past 24 hours.\n\nHowever, according to analysts, the largest digital asset by market cap could experience increased sell pressure because a super majority of circulating supply is now in profit.\n\n\"As the market rallies, a super-majority of investor coins have returned to being in-profit,\" Coinglass analysts said in the new report.\n\nCoins held 'in-loss'\n\nThe Coinglass analysis pointed to data that showed how the total volume of coins held \"in-loss\" has declined to around 1.9 million bitcoin, with most held by long-term holders who bought near the 2021 highs.\n\nThe data from Coinglass concurs with that from The Block's Data Dashboard which shows that the percentage of bitcoin circulating supply that is in profit is now over 88%. That's a high not seen since late November 2021.\n\n\"2023 started out with over 50% of bitcoin supply being underwater, this is one of the fastest recoveries in history, second to the rally in 2019,\" Coinglass said.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nSell pressure\n\nA recent CryptoQuant report also suggested sell pressure is increasing for the digital asset.\n\n\"In the short-term, there are some risks of a price correction given that short term bitcoin holders are experiencing high unrealized profit margins, which historically has preceded price corrections,\" the report said.\n\nHowever, the report highlighted longer-term bullish indicators for 2024.\n\n\"On-chain valuation and network metrics signal bitcoin remains well inside a bull market and may be targeting $54,000 in the medium term and $160,000 plus as this cycle price top,\" the CryptoQuant report added."

        "title": "Bitcoin's unexpected uptick to $38K: What's going on? - Richmond Times-Dispatch",
        "content": "Bitcoin has once again taken center stage, surprising many with its recent ascent to around $38,000. This rally has sparked discussions among investors and analysts alike, with many turning to insights from industry experts to demystify this phenomenon.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin's Journey\n\nTo fully appreciate what's going on, it's essential to consider Bitcoin's tumultuous journey over the past few seasons. Looking at a Bitcoin price chart can help you plot the twists and turns in this cryptocurrency\u2019s journey.\n\nIn November 2021, Bitcoin reached an all-time high of nearly $69,000, capturing global attention. This period was also marked by the meteoric rise of crypto millionaires who had amassed significant wealth through early investments in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Simultaneously, the NFT market was booming, further fueling the cryptocurrency hype. These developments painted a picture of a rapidly expanding digital economy with Bitcoin at its helm.\n\nThe Decline and Influencing Factors\n\nHowever, this peak was short-lived, as the cryptocurrency experienced a sharp 64% decline the following year. The causes of this decline were multifaceted, influenced by various crypto industry scandals and a series of bankruptcies. Most notable was the Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX scandal, which shook the crypto world to its core.\n\nThe fallout from this scandal was profound, contributing significantly to the 'crypto winter' of 2022, a period marked by plummeting prices and waning investor confidence. However, 2023 has marked a remarkable turnaround, with Bitcoin's value more than doubling, a trend that stands in stark contrast to the previous years' downturn. According to various well-respected publications like The Wall Street Journal, Binance, and CNN Money, this resurgence can be attributed to several factors, including renewed investor interest and confidence in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nTurnaround and Influence of Potential ETF Approval\n\nThe potential approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also played a major role in Bitcoin's uptick. As Michael Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd., mentioned in his interview with Bloomberg TV, a Bitcoin ETF could be a game-changer for the cryptocurrency market.\n\nNovogratz predicts that Bitcoin could reach its previous all-time highs within a year, spurred by the excitement and legitimacy that an ETF would bring to the market. The approval of a Bitcoin ETF is expected to open the floodgates for institutional investors, who have been largely cautious about entering the cryptocurrency market due to regulatory uncertainties. Novogratz notes an ETF would provide a regulated and relatively safer investment vehicle, making it easier for these institutional players to invest in Bitcoin. This could lead to a substantial influx of new capital into the market, further driving up Bitcoin's price.\n\nMarket Dynamics and Investor Psychology\n\nThe dramatic swings in Bitcoin's value can often be traced back to collective investor emotions\u2014optimism, fear, speculation, and reaction to global events. For instance, the initial surge in Bitcoin's price was fueled by a sense of excitement and the allure of being part of a groundbreaking financial revolution. Similarly, its subsequent declines often mirrored widespread investor anxiety over regulatory changes or negative news within the crypto space.\n\nAs regulatory bodies like the SEC start to provide more clarity, and if the SEC approves the first U.S. spot bitcoin ETF, the risk perception may lessen among a broader investor base. This shift can lead to more mainstream adoption and an increase in optimism could be a key driver behind the recent price surge.\n\n\"Prices are set on the margin, so that's all new money,\" Novogratz explained to Bloomberg, highlighting the potential shift in investor psychology that could happen if the government greenlights Bitcoin purchases through regulated avenues. This will be particularly impactful in 2024, given the uncertainty surrounding the upcoming election year.\n\nTechnological Advancements and Industry Trends\n\nBeyond regulatory changes and market psychology, technological advancements in the blockchain and cryptocurrency domains also play a critical role in Bitcoin's resurgence. These innovations are not only enhancing the functionality and security of Bitcoin transactions but are also broadening its use cases.\n\nFor instance, blockchain has significantly improved scalability, speed, and security. These enhancements have made Bitcoin transactions faster and more efficient, attracting more users and investors to the platform. Moreover, the growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contract capabilities has brought renewed attention to Bitcoin's potential beyond just a digital currency.\n\nInstitutional interest in Bitcoin has been steadily growing, too. More companies are adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a reserve asset, viewing it as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. This trend is not only a vote of confidence in Bitcoin's value proposition but also brings significant capital into the Bitcoin market, contributing to its price appreciation.\n\nFor those keen on monitoring Bitcoin's latest trends and price movements, a comprehensive Bitcoin price chart is available, providing real-time data and insights. Will the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies through vehicles like ETFs become a reality? How will the global economic and political climate influence the crypto market? The world is watching as the industry continues to evolve.\n\nInformation is intended for educational purposes only and is not to be used as investment advice.

        "content": "MicroStockHub / iStock.com\n\nFollowing last year\u2019s disastrous landscape for the crypto ecosystem \u2014 a year marred by scandals, collapses, losses and lawsuits \u2014 2023 fared better. While the industry is still reeling from these developments, some assets have been slowly gaining ground.\n\nLost Money on Crypto in 2023? This Trick Could Help You Pay 0% Capital Gains Tax\n\nFind: 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\n\nIn turn, many experts argue that 2024 is off to a good start, with some cryptos poised to significantly progress. As of Dec. 20, the global cryptocurrency market cap was $1.72 trillion, according to CoinGecko.\n\nBitcoin\n\nPrice as of Dec. 20: $44,130\n\nPast year: up 160.9%\n\nYear-to-date: up 166.46%\n\nPast 30 days: up 17.8%\n\nAll-time high: $68,789.63 on Nov. 10, 2021\n\nMany experts are very bullish on Bitcoin for 2024 due to a combination of factors that could provide a perfect storm situation for the asset.\n\nAs David Waugh, lead analyst at Coinbits, explained, one significant development is the expected approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) in January- which could result- according to analysts from Galaxy Research- in $14.4 billion of institutional inflows into Bitcoin in the first year, exerting significant upward pressure on its price.\n\nAnother factor is that by the end of this year, Congress could also pass comprehensive crypto legislation providing the industry with much-needed regulatory clarity, making Bitcoin more attractive to banks \u2013 allowing banks to work with Bitcoin companies to enhance the services they can offer consumers, he said.\n\nFinally, another key catalyst is the Bitcoin halving event slated for April, which occurs once every four years and has always been associated with a massive price increase in the months before and after the event, according to Ric Edelman, founder, Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals.\n\n\u201cThe impact of these developments on bitcoin\u2019s price are expected to be substantial, with many predicting future bitcoin prices of $100,000 to $1.5 million,\u201d said Edelman. \u201cI\u2019m expecting Bitcoin\u2019s price to reach $150,000 by Dec 2025.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum\n\nPrice as of Dec. 20: $2,255\n\nPast year: up 84.7%\n\nYear-to-date: up 87.9%\n\nPast 30 days: up 10.3%\n\nAll-time high: $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021\n\nEther underperformed Bitcoin in 2023 with a gain of \u201conly\u201d 80%, trading roughly in line with its peer group in the smart contract platforms crypto sector, said Zach Pandl, Grayscale\u2018s managing director of research.\n\nPandl added that there has been extensive debate about Ethereum\u2019s competitive landscape as 2023 comes to a close, and he expects this to continue into 2024.\n\n\u201cGrayscale Research remains optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s outlook despite better performance from some other Smart Contract Platform tokens in 2023 (such as SOL or AVAX), as Ethereum network will go through an upgrade in the first quarter, that could support is \u201cmodular\u201d scaling plan,\u201d he said. Another driver could be any progress on the regulatory approval on spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. market, which could support token valuation, as well, he added.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP\n\nPrice as of Dec. 20: $0.621\n\nPast year: up 78.2%\n\nYear-to-date: up 84.25%\n\nPast 30 days: 0.00%\n\nAll-time high: Jan. 4, 2018, at $3.84\n\nAs Aaron Rafferty\u2019s CEO of StandardDAO and co-founder of BattlePACs, while XRP has increased significantly, it still remains 81.78% below its all-time high.\n\n\u201cWe have seen a turbulent albeit positive year with an SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) win and many acquisitions out of Ripple including toward real world asset tokenization,\u201d he said. \u201cExpect strong price trends for this payment rail.\u201d\n\nChainlink\n\nPrice as of Dec. 20: $14.66\n\nPast year: up 142%\n\nYear-to-date: up 164.85%\n\nPast 30 days: down 3.3%\n\nAll-time high: May 9, 2021, at $52.88\n\nAccording to Rafferty, the year-to-date rise demonstrates robust growth potential, standing 74% below its peak.\n\n\u201cPast bull run gains were 1400%+ and typically run prior to other players,\u201d he said. \u201cLINK\u2019s expansion into enterprise solutions, including collaborations with major players like Google, SWIFT, and Oracle, provides a vital security layer between blockchains and real-world data.\u201d\n\nOther Assets and Trends\n\nLee Taylor, the founder of MonarchX, said that in addition to Chainlink, if you\u2019re looking for the unicorn altcoins of 2024, I think Solana, Avalanche and Algorand should be top performers.\n\n\u201cALGO, which features low costs, is particularly well-suited to content creators. While seeing a dip earlier this year, it is up a whopping 38% over the past month, and it should continue to see high growth into 2024,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, AVAX is in a similar position, up over 75% in the past month alone. It is likely that these unicorns are well-positioned to see 100% growth over the next year.\n\nBitcoin-related assets, which have been on a roll lately, are also something worth watching, according to several experts.\n\nFor instance, \u201cOrdinals\u201d -NFTs on Bitcoin- or, as Decrypt explained, \u201cdigital assets inscribed on a satoshi, the lowest denomination of a Bitcoin,\u201d have garnered a lot of interest lately.\n\nNow, whether they have staying power remains to be seen, according to Grayscale\u2019s Pandl.\n\nAccording to Austin Alexander, co-founder of LayerTwo Labs, building on Bitcoin-related assets and networks is a big trend in the coming year.\n\n\u201cThere are many people who had never touched Bitcoin \u2013 they\u2019re altcoiners \u2013 who are now getting into Bitcoin because of Ordinals and other related assets,\u201d he said. \u201cBitcoin has the most liquidity of any decentralized network, and it\u2019s also the most secure, so this all makes BTC more desirable. Bitcoin\u2019s network effects are powerful, and I think we\u2019ll see the broader Bitcoin ecosystem flourish in the year ahead.\u201d\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Why Bitcoin, Ethereum and 2 More Cryptos Are Poised To Boom in 2024"

The filing on Wednesday lists Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht as a defendant, two claimants and the U.S. government as a plaintiff.\n\nThe U.S. government had already been in control of the crypto after it was handed over by a so-called \"Individual X\" who hacked into Silk Road and gained control of its funds, according to the original complaint.\n\nIn 2020, the U.S. Justice Department seized and began seeking the official forfeiture of the crypto, which at the time was valued at over $1 billion. A few days earlier, 69,369 bitcoins were moved out of a wallet address, marking the first such activity for the collected holdings since 2015, according to previous reporting by The Block.\n\nMovements of the funds are closely tracked, as market participants frequently speculate about the possible impact any large sale by the U.S. government could have on bitcoin's price.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nBehind bars\n\nRoss Ulbricht, who is serving a life sentence in jail, founded the Silk Road and operated it from 2011 to 2013.

The \u201cBases for the Reconstruction of the Argentine Economy\u201d decree, passed on Dec. 20, did not specifically mention crypto but included provisions that debtors had the choice to pay in currencies not recognized as legal tender in Argentina.\n\n\u201cWe ratify and confirm that in Argentina contracts can be settled in Bitcoin,\u201d said Mondino. \u201cAnd also any other crypto.\u201d\n\nY tambi\u00e9n cualquier otra cripto y/o especie como kilos de novillo o litros de leche.\n\n\n\nArt 766. - Obligaci\u00f3n del deudor.

        "title": "Bitcoin Surged in 2023. There's 1 Thing Leading Investor Optimism - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC) skyrocketed in 2023, climbing an astonishing 158% as of the time of this writing. To put those gains in better context, the S&P 500 rose nearly 23% for the year.\n\nCryptocurrencies are often more volatile than the stock market, but why was so much optimism directed toward Bitcoin? Because investors believe the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may be close to approving a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nDoing so would open Bitcoin investing to many more people and could, in turn, drive the value of Bitcoin even higher.\n\nInvestors are anticipating a Bitcoin ETF approval\n\nRight now, if you want to invest in Bitcoin, you essentially have to own the cryptocurrency. The problem with this, for some investors, is that you either need to own and store the digital tokens yourself or entrust them to be held by third parties.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF would allow investors to track the price of Bitcoin as it moves, with the ETF directly invested in Bitcoin. This means investors would own shares of Bitcoin assets in their brokerage account, with the ETF directly holding the Bitcoin assets.\n\nThere are a few key benefits of spot Bitcoin ETF:\n\nOur top crypto play isn't a token - Here\u2019s why We\u2019ve found one company that\u2019s positioned itself perfectly as a long-term picks-and-shovels solution for the broader crypto market \u2014 Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and all the others. In fact, you've probably used this company's technology in the past few days, even if you've never had an account or even heard of the company before. That's how prevalent it's become. Sign up today for Stock Advisor and get access to our exclusive report where you can get the full scoop on this company and its upside as a long-term investment. Learn more and get started today with a special new member discount. Get started\n\nCasual investors would have more access to Bitcoin investing.\n\nBuying an ETF in your brokerage account is much easier than owning and storing Bitcoin.\n\nThe ETF shares can be easily liquidated, making it easy to sell.\n\nETF tax rules are already in place, unlike confusing tax rules for crypto.\n\nIt gives investors a safer way to be exposed to cryptocurrencies.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF could bring more stability to Bitcoin price movements.\n\nReuters estimates there would be a lot of demand for a Bitcoin ETF, creating $3 billion worth of investment demand in just the first few days. If that happens, the price of Bitcoin could climb higher and add even more gains to Bitcoin's recent rise.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF approval may happen soon\n\nMore than a dozen firms have applied for the Bitcoin ETF, and Reuters reporting shows that the SEC may approve the ETF sometime in early January.\n\nIf it happens, then you may be able to invest in Bitcoin through your brokerage account soon. If you're considering buying it when it becomes available, ensure you're prepared for any potential volatility the ETF could experience.\n\nWhile the past year has been good for Bitcoin's price, there's no guarantee that it will continue trending upward. And any negative news involving cryptocurrencies or Bitcoin could send its price tumbling. For example, Bitcoin's price dropped by 64% in 2022 amid a pullback among investors from the crypto market.\n\nThe crypto market has experienced a lot of ups and downs recently, with the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX and the SEC bringing charges against another major exchange, Binance.\n\nAnd there is still inherent risk with digital currencies. For example, if a spot Bitcoin ETF is approved, the investment firms will own the digital currency and have to store it somewhere. Cryptocurrency theft among cybercriminals is already big business, and it could become even more lucrative if large brokerages begin buying substantial sums of Bitcoin.\n\nThat doesn't mean a Bitcoin ETF won't be worth investing in, but you need to be aware that cryptocurrency investing, even through an ETF, is likely to be more volatile than investing in the stock market."

        "title": "Understanding bitcoin's unique journey through 2023's crypto landscape - Tulsa World",
        "content": "Bitcoin has navigated a captivating journey, from its foundational principles of limited supply and mining dynamics to its resilience in the face of global challenges. By venturing through the highs and lows of the price of Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency\u2019s market trajectory, we can unravel the complexities of its 2023 performance and peer into the future of this revolutionary digital asset.\n\nLimited Supply and Mining Dynamics\n\nBitcoin's uniqueness lies in its finite supply. With a cap of 21 million, over 19 million are currently in circulation, leaving less than 2 million to be mined. This scarcity is fundamental to Bitcoin's algorithm, potentially countering inflation and preserving its value. The creation of a new Bitcoin involves miners using specialized software to validate transaction blocks on the blockchain. Approximately 900 Bitcoins are mined daily, with the protocol automatically halving the issuance after every 210,000 blocks. The most recent halving occurred in May 2020, supporting the cryptocurrency's value and helping offset inflation.\n\nBitcoin's Resilience Amidst Challenges\n\nCryptocurrency faced a pivotal test during the COVID-19 pandemic. While traditional markets experienced turbulence, Bitcoin showcased its resilience. Starting 2020 at $6,950.56, a March selloff briefly dropped to $4,841.67. However, a rapid recovery followed, and by the year's end, Bitcoin soared to $29,402.64, a remarkable 323 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase.\n\n2021: Achieving New Heights\n\nIn 2021, Bitcoin achieved unprecedented milestones, reaching an all-time high of $68,649.05 in November. This surge, attributed to risk-on investor sentiment and Tesla's significant Bitcoin investment, marked a 98.82 percent increase from January. Despite a slight dip to $47,897.16 by year-end, Bitcoin demonstrated a commendable 62 percent YoY increase. Tesla's $1.5 billion Bitcoin investment and potential plans to accept Bitcoin for vehicle purchases significantly contributed to the 2021 rally. Despite subsequent scrutiny, the announcement of due diligence on renewable energy usage hinted at continued support. Increased money printing amid the pandemic also drove investors to diversify, benefitting Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin in 2023: Navigating Volatility\n\nDespite Bitcoin's notoriety and all-time highs, 2022 brought volatility. Prices dipped below $20,000 in Q2 but rebounded to nearly $24,000 in mid-January 2023. A subsequent drop to around $20,200 was followed by a rise to $28,211, showcasing Bitcoin's resilience in the face of market uncertainties. In Q2, despite SEC lawsuits against major platforms, the price of Bitcoin stabilized above $25,000, buoyed by BlackRock's filing for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. Surpassing $30,000 in June and reaching $31,500 in July, Bitcoin demonstrated its strength even amid regulatory challenges.\n\nLooking Ahead: Bitcoin's Future\n\nAs of November 15, 2023, Bitcoin is trading at $37,885 BTC, benefiting from increased institutional investment and potential SEC approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024. Despite fluctuations, Bitcoin's performance, sustained growth, and future potential remain significant.\n\nUnderstanding Blockchain Technology & Increasing Awareness\n\nA blockchain serves as a decentralized public ledger for all cryptocurrency transactions. Constantly growing, completed blocks are added chronologically, making blockchain integral to various industries, including banking, cybersecurity, and supply chain management. As educational resources expand, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, once considered sophisticated, could become more accessible. The potential benefits, such as decentralization, financial inclusion, and privacy, are now understood by a broader audience.\n\nA deeper understanding of cryptocurrencies is debunking prevalent myths and misconceptions, offering a more realistic understanding of these digital assets and what they represent. Trust in new technologies, like cryptocurrencies, heavily relies on consumer awareness. Trust levels increase as people gain more knowledge about these digital assets and their operations, encouraging future adoption. Policymakers and regulators, becoming more informed, may develop fairer legislation as well. A clearer regulatory environment can facilitate the acceptance of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAwareness extends beyond individuals to institutions like banks and companies, which are gaining knowledge about cryptocurrencies. Growing public knowledge may be leading to increased popularity for cryptocurrencies along with technological advancements in the cryptocurrency field.\n\nPurchasing Bitcoin: A User's Guide\n\nBitcoin can be acquired through crypto exchanges like Coinbase Global, CoinSmart Financial, BlockFi, Binance, and Gemini. Users can store their Bitcoin in digital wallets, ensuring secure transactions. Cryptocurrencies offer an alternative to traditional banking, attracting those seeking decentralized digital options. Privacy, quick transactions, and fewer fees make cryptocurrencies appealing. Recognizing the trend, some banks are increasingly investing in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\n\nBitcoin's Future: Volatility and Opportunity\n\nWhile Bitcoin has seen a resurgence in 2023, its inherent volatility remains notable, according to Bloomberg, Forbes, Binance, and Yahoo Finance. Given its historical profitability, investors open to risk may find opportunities in the cryptocurrency space. However, those seeking more stability might explore alternative investment avenues.\n\nBitcoin's journey from its humble beginnings to present-day highs showcases its resilience, adaptability, and potential for the future. Understanding its historical context, technological underpinnings, and the dynamics influencing its value positions investors to navigate the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies.\n\nInformation is intended for educational purposes only and is not to be used as investment advice. As with all investments, there is risk and the past performance of a particular asset class does not guarantee any future performance.\n\nLee Enterprises newsroom and editorial were not involved in the creation of this content."

        "title": "Ethereum loses its shine as Bitcoin dominates, Solana climbs - Fortune",
        "content": "The rising crypto tide of 2023 has lifted all boats, but some of those vessels are floating higher than others. Bitcoin, riding a wave of ETF optimism, is worth far more than all of the other digital assets combined and is up a handsome 132% on the year. Ethereum rival Solana appears to have shaken off its Sam Bankman-Fried association once and for all and this week eclipsed XRP to become the fifth-biggest token in the market while climbing over 400% in 2023. And Ethereum? It\u2019s up a relatively modest 66%.\n\nPrice movements are hardly the only way to judge a currency of course. Meme coins like Doge or BONK or whatever regularly pop up by crazy amounts on the heels of social media hype but still lack any logical value proposition. Still, price reflects sentiment\u2014vibes if you prefer\u2014and right now the vibe around Ethereum feels decidedly stale.\n\nAs we embark on what looks like a new crypto bull market, Ethereum is facing familiar problems of absurdly high gas fees that make simple transactions unviable. Meanwhile, its vaunted layer-2 solutions do make the blockchain affordable but also introduce an unwelcome layer of complexity for casual crypto users. It\u2019s the same old story and there are no signs it\u2019s going to change anytime soon.\n\nMessari founder and crypto wiseman Ryan Selkis makes this case in his annual industry prognosis, writing that Ethereum is losing some of its luster:\n\n\u201cETH is straddled. BTC outperforms ETH as digital money thanks to institutional allocators\u2019 interest in the digital gold \u2018pure play\u2019 while broad availability of Ethereum substitutes (L0s, L1s, L2s) will likely lead to those substitutes\u2019 outperformance as they sop up onchain volumes relative to the Ethereum main chain. I don\u2019t see a scenario where ETH outperforms bitcoin AND its up-and-coming, higher-beta peers.\u201d\n\nSelkis, however, also points out that Ethereum losing a step was likely inevitable as competition increased in the smart contract industry that it pioneered:\n\n\u201cIf anything, being bearish on ETH relative to the field is not an indictment of Ethereum, but rather a clear-eyed realization that ETH as an asset has been incredibly dominant so far, and has set the bar impossibly high to maintain over a 60% market share in its network token peer group. When I think of Ethereum vs. Solana, I think of Visa vs. Mastercard, not Google vs. Bing in terms of relative strength.\u201d\n\nThat sounds about right. Ethereum has many strengths, including its inclusive developer ecosystem and the pedigree of integrity that its creator Vitalik Buterin bequeathed, but there was no way it was going to remain the only game in town. And for now, its role as the second-most-important blockchain remains unchallenged but, if the blockchain doesn\u2019t increase its vibe game in 2024, that could change.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nCrypto scammers are using a flaw in Twitter to create tweets containing URLs that look like they come from Binance, Ethereum, and other real sites.

        "content": "The launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States could cause a shortage of \u201cregulated\u201d Bitcoin (BTC) and hurt one popular trading strategy, according to Coinbase researchers.\n\nThere are less than three weeks left until a potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, with many believing trading could begin not long after. However, Coinbase\u2019s head of institutional research, David Duong, and senior sales trader, Greg Sutton, said two key risks could appear once they begin trading.\n\nIn a Dec. 19 podcast, Duong and Sutton said the launch could cause an issue for institutions sourcing BTC, referring to issuers needing to buy enough Bitcoin to hold in their ETFs.\n\n\u201cYou need to buy Bitcoin from certain regulated places, what if demand is so great that these guys are unable to acquire the Bitcoin they need?\u201d\n\nCrypto venture firm Bitwise predicted that a spot Bitcoin ETF would be the most successful launch of an ETF product of all time.\n\nWhile he admitted that this is a good problem to have when compared to low inflows, Duong said the sourcing risk was one worth keeping in mind moving forward.\n\nSutton said a second risk concerns one of the more popular institutional trading strategies, known as the \u201cbasis trade\u201d \u2014 which refers to taking advantage of the difference between the spot price of Bitcoin and the price of BTC futures contracts.\n\nDue to the massive uptick in volume on both spot Bitcoin and futures contracts, the potential profit on the basis trade has surged as high as 20% in the last fortnight, according to data from Velo.\n\nHowever, as institutional investors gain increasingly direct exposure to Bitcoin \u2014 by way of a spot ETF product \u2014 the basis will narrow, causing there to be far less profitability in the trade.\n\nRelated: Spot Bitcoin ETF \u2018nailed on\u2019 for 2024: K33 report\n\nThere are currently 13 applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF pending with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). There is a wide consensus that one or all of these products could be approved by as early as Jan. 10, with Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart pinning the chance of an approval at 90%.\n\nAccording to a Dec. 21 X post from Seyffart, crypto asset manager Grayscale met with the SEC once more, in a bid to to push for in-kind redemptions instead of cash creation.\n\nAn in-kind redemption model is typically seen as more efficient for ETF issuers, as it avoids bid/ask spreads and broker commissions that come from selling the asset to raise cash for issuing shares.\n\nMagazine: DeFi\u2019s billion-dollar secret: The insiders responsible for hacks"

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Solana, and Near Protocol Jumped on Wednesday - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The crypto market continued its bullish run on Wednesday with most of the major cryptocurrencies moving higher. There wasn't any major news about the industry overall, but small tidbits are giving investors enough reason to buy.\n\nBitcoin (BTC -6.26%) is up 3.2% over the last 24 hours as of 4 p.m. ET, Solana (SOL 6.63%) has jumped 10%, and Near Protocol (NEAR 7.46%) is up a whopping 18.6%.\n\nThe crypto industry takes small steps forward\n\nLast night it was announced that Blackrock, Nasdaq, and the Securities and Exchange Commission met yesterday for a second time to discuss rule changes to list a Bitcoin exhcnage-traded fund (ETF). The possibility of an ETF coming to market has been speculation all year and these appear to be at least small steps toward making that a reality.\n\nAn ETF could bring new money into the crypto industry by making it more accessible. It's still relatively difficult to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, so a low-cost exchange-traded fund would allow investors to get access without having crypto wallets or working with centralized crypto exchanges.\n\nSolana's rise continues, helped by news that it's now home to more decentralized trading volume than Ethereum. Solana's low cost and fast speed have made it a go-to blockchain for developers and that's helping push the token higher.\n\nNear Protocol is seeing an inflow of investor interest today as the blockchain attracts more developers and collaborations, opening up potential use cases.\n\nInvestors and utility\n\nThe two drivers of cryptocurrency right now are the flow of funds into the industry and the utility being built on the blockchain. All three of these cryptocurrencies are benefiting from that.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF could bring in more investors with a low-cost financial instrument and that could pave the way to more cryptocurrencies getting ETFs. And the SEC ruling positively, in this case, could lead to a thawing for crypto regulation in general.\n\nI think the long-term driver of the industry will be a growing number of use cases for the blockchain. From financial instruments to logistics uses, companies big and small are testing how they can use the blockchain. I think that will open up more use cases and companies built using this technology.\n\nIt's less clear how that will benefit specific tokens. Solana, for example, is so low-cost that even a large rise in transactions won't increase the fees, and tokens like the stablecoin USD Coin can be used as the medium of transaction.\n\nSpeculation is still rampant in crypto and that's driving a lot of the increase in value short-term. But there are improvements in the underlying technology and utility, which investors shouldn't overlook. And as long as there's an inflow of funds and an increase in innovation the market can keep moving higher."
