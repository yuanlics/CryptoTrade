        "title": "The bitcoin bounce: what comes next? - The Associated Press",
        "content": "Markets this year are roiling, uncertainty abounds and the U.S. government has had to step in to rescue two large American banks in recent days. So why is bitcoin, considered among the riskiest bets of them all, rising so fast?\n\nJust months ago, all forms of cryptocurrency appeared to be going up in flames, with bitcoin plunging from almost $50,000 at the start of 2022, to less than $17,000 when 2023 rolled around.\n\nBitcoin has since soared more than 60% and it climbed another 8% Friday above $27,000, all in an era of mass layoffs in the tech sector and widespread anxiety about stability in the U.S. banking sector.\n\nSo what happened?\n\nThe pandemic was an era of massive growth for both technology companies and crypto. That surge began to wane in late 2021 as people began to travel, go out to restaurants or catch a show. They spent much less time in front of screens and at the same time, the government stimulus checks that allowed people some financial cushion began to run out. Crypto began to fall in tandem with technology. On top of that, in March 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve began an aggressive string of rate hikes, its most powerful weapon to fight inflation, which had begun to rise rapidly.\n\nThat put bitcoin prices in freefall. Higher interest rates mean that safe assets like Treasurys become more attractive to investors because their yields have increased, dulling the shine of high-growth companies and other assets that carry more risk. That includes bitcoin.\n\nYet economic data earlier this year seemed to suggest that inflation had peaked, raising the chance that the Fed would ease off on rate hikes, and that was the start of bitcoin\u2019s bounce.\n\nHow did the recent bank collapses play into all of this?\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank actually fueled investments in bitcoin. In the eyes of Wall Street, a shaky financial system lowered the odds even further that the Fed could continue raising rates, as had been the prevailing expectation as recently as the start of last week, before Silicon Valley Bank blew up.\n\n\u201cAs the economy heads towards a recession, the cryptoverse could look more attractive than equities,\u201d wrote Edward Moya of Oanda in a research report. \u201cIt appears the downside risks are greater for the S&P 500 than they are for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nIf an investor on Jan. 1 put $100 into bitcoin and $100 in an S&P 500 index fund, the bitcoin investment would have returned $60, compared with a $2 return on the S&P bet.\n\nSo will bitcoin keep rising?\n\nAll eyes now turn to the Federal Reserve, which meets next week and will make a decision on what to do about its benchmark interest rate.\n\nWhat the Fed does may not matter at all as far as bitcoin investors are concerned.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde when it comes to how it reacts to Fed rate expectations,\u201d Moya said. \u201cFor most of last year, higher Treasury yields alongside rising Fed rate hike expectations spelled trouble for Bitcoin. Fed rate cut bets are good news for cryptos, but a severe recession should prove troubling for all risky assets, including bitcoin.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin Mining Is Set to Turn Greener \u2013 Global X ETFs - Global X",
        "content": "The Bitcoin network\u2019s security is derived from a process called Proof-of-Work (PoW) which is powered by advanced hardware and large amounts of electricity. In PoW mining, miners aggregate transactional data over a specific period and attempt to summarize this data into an encrypted output that is accepted by the rest of the network. This process is computationally-intensive and requires a significant amount of energy. Successful miners are compensated by the network with newly-created bitcoin. PoW mining\u2019s energy requirement is not arbitrary, however. By requiring miners to expend resources to update the state of the shared ledger, tampering with historical data becomes extremely cost-prohibitive.\n\nToday, the global bitcoin mining industry consumes the same amount of electricity as a small country such as The Netherlands.1 While the total electricity consumption is high, it does not tell the whole story. It is also essential to consider the significant advancements the mining industry has made in improving the energy efficiency of their operations, as well as the forces catalyzing the mining industry to adopt greater amounts of sustainably-sourced electricity into the mining process.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nBitcoin miners compete to maximize their share of a fixed amount of mineable Bitcoin. Miners are incentivized to utilize efficient hardware and consume inexpensive energy to optimize profit margins.\n\nAdvances in the efficiency of mining hardware have been impressive, but the pace of improvements is slowing. Utilizing the cheapest energy sources is becoming increasingly important to reduce operational costs.\n\nRenewable energy sources such as solar and wind are becoming increasingly cost-competitive. Adopting these energy sources into the mining process is a trend that is likely to accelerate in the mining industry, which may support a decrease in the Bitcoin network\u2019s carbon footprint.\n\nMiners Power ASICs to Earn a Share of Bitcoin Rewards\n\nApplication-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are specialized hardware units used in the computationally-intensive process of bitcoin mining. These machines are tasked with \u201csolving\u201d a block of data and adding it to the blockchain. ASICs do this by aggregating transactional data across the network and pushing it through an encryption algorithm in search of an arbitrary output. This iterative process requires ASICs to make billions of guesses per second until the correct output is found.\n\nEach individual computation made by an ASIC is referred to as a hash, and the number of hashes an ASIC produces per second is referred to as the hashrate. A single hash can be thought of as a lottery ticket to solving a block and earning a bitcoin reward. A miner\u2019s share of the network\u2019s aggregate hashrate\u2014the amount of computing power generated by all ASICs on the network\u2014represents the bitcoin rewards the miner can expect to earn over a given time period.\n\nHigh Competition Requires Miners to Seek Operational Efficiencies\n\nBitcoin mining is highly competitive. As the network\u2019s aggregate hashrate increases, mining operations that do not proportionally scale their hashrate become diluted and experience a decrease in expected bitcoin rewards. To remain competitive, miners are forced to continually increase their hashrate, resulting in an arms race for the most powerful and efficient ASICs. The first chart below shows how the hashrate securing the network has increased over time, while the second chart demonstrates how increasing competition has led to a decrease in the average income per hash.\n\nTo maintain profit margins in the face of these competitive forces, miners can either utilize more efficient mining hardware that maximizes hashrate per unit of energy consumed, or they can power their mining devices with the cheapest energy available.\n\nThe Importance of Energy Efficiency Grows as Hardware Advances Slow\n\nThe early days of industrial-scale bitcoin mining were defined by miners competing to maximize energy efficient hashrate by using the latest-generation ASICs. Rapid advancements in semiconductor technology fueled this competition as ASICs saw exponential improvements in hashrate efficiency in a matter of years. Compared to their 2014 counterparts, today\u2019s ASICs are roughly 36x more energy efficient as measured by Joules of energy consumed to produce 1 gigahash (1 billion hashes) of computing power.2 However, the efficiency gains in ASIC technology are becoming increasingly marginal, as illustrated in the chart below.\n\nIn the face of slowing ASIC advancements, the dominance of hardware as the main determinant of a miner\u2019s profitability will likely diminish. In its place, cost-competitive energy will likely become an increasingly important input.\n\nEconomic Alignments Incentivize Miners to Adopt Renewable Energy\n\nMiners are incentivized to operate in locations with the cheapest and most accessible energy available. Expanding operations in places suitable for solar and wind farms is a compelling option. While these energy sources currently have reliability limitations, solar and wind energy have become more affordable than fossil fuel sources, as illustrated in the chart below.\n\nThe bitcoin mining industry is taking note of the cost benefits of renewable energy. Recently, a number of industry-leading miners began a transition of their operations away from fossil fuel sources of energy. Among these, Marathon Digital relocated operations from a coal-powered mining facility in Montana to more sustainable facilities including a wind-powered facility in King Mountain, Texas in Q3 2022.3 The Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC), a global forum of mining companies that represents 48.4% of the worldwide bitcoin mining network, estimated that in Q4 2022, renewable energy sources accounted for 58.9% of the electricity used to mine bitcoin, a significant improvement compared to 36.8% estimated in Q1 2021.4\n\nHalvings Could be Another Catalyst for Renewable Energy Adoption\n\nIn addition to competition, bitcoin halvings could also accelerate green energy adoption among miners. Halvings happen every 210,000 blocks, approximately every four years.5 As the name suggests, halvings reduce bitcoin block rewards by 50%, which lowers revenues earned by bitcoin miners by almost the same amount if there is no change in the price of bitcoin. Expected in 2024, the next halving will reduce block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC issued per block.6 With competition and halvings pressuring miners to seek out efficiency gains wherever possible, bitcoin miners are discovering that environmentally sustainable practices may be the next frontier to explore.\n\nRelated ETFs\n\nBKCH \u2013 Global X Blockchain ETF\n\nClick the fund name above to view current holdings.

        "title": "Bitcoin hits nine-month high as traders shift away from banks - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\n\nBitcoin hit its highest level in nine months on Friday as crypto traders shifted funds away from banks and warmed to rapidly shifting interest rate expectations.\n\nThe dollar-denominated price of the original and biggest crypto coin has surged more than 30 per cent this week to more than $27,000, its highest point since the onset of the crisis of confidence that engulfed the market last summer. The second-largest token, ether, has risen a fifth in the same period.\n\nBuyers have emerged after a week of acute turbulence for the world\u2019s banking industry on both sides of the Atlantic as investors fret over the valuations of smaller banks\u2019 bond portfolios and business models.\n\nThe US government and large banks stepped in to steady the system while the Swiss central bank provided a $54bn emergency backstop for lender Credit Suisse. The uncertainty has prompted speculation that the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank will pause their plans to raise interest rates aggressively to curb lingering inflation.\n\nFor the past 18 months the price of bitcoin, once touted as a hedge against inflation, has often been correlated with traditional stock indices such as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite, and sensitive to traders\u2019 expectations on interest rates.\n\nTraders point out that when investors have fears over crypto prices, they move funds into bank deposits and stablecoins. When there are concerns over banks, they rapidly move to purchasing tokens.\n\n\u201cFears over the stability of the banking system, along with declining real interest rates, creates a good environment for bitcoin to rebound because it is seen by some investors as a hedge against systemic risks,\u201d said Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at London broker Marex.\n\nThe market recovery has also been bolstered after reassurances from US authorities that deposits at the failed Silicon Valley Bank would be protected.\n\nCircle, operator of the crypto market\u2019s second largest stablecoin USDC, admitted it had $3.3bn trapped at SVB, triggering a temporary decline in the value of the stablecoin to 88 cents.\n\nStablecoins act as a conduit between crypto and sovereign money and are supposed to maintain their value one-for-one against the dollar at all times.\n\nDespite a short-term recovery for digital assets, turbulence in the banking sector casts doubt over the crypto industry\u2019s long-term footprint in the US.\n\nTogether with Silvergate and Signature, SVB was one of a tripartite of crypto-friendly banks that met their demise in recent days. Their failures have sparked fears among industry supporters that the US is de-banking the crypto industry.\n\nRepublican congressman Tom Emmer on Wednesday wrote a letter to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, arguing that the regulator was purposely seeking to limit the banking industry\u2019s exposure to crypto markets.\n\n\u201cA lot of people already understand the industry is rotating away from the United States, so in many ways, America\u2019s crypto clampdown has been priced in by the market,\u201d Solot said."

        "title": "Bitcoin enjoys 32% rally in banking crisis wake - InvestmentNews",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency fans believe it\u2019s more than just a coincidence that bitcoin has been rallying in the wake of the recent troubles hitting traditional banking institutions.\n\nWhile a string of regional banks have seen their stock prices decline over the past week by as much as 70%, the price of bitcoin has jumped by nearly 32%.\n\nFor the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, the timing couldn\u2019t be better for rolling out its expanded certification for blockchain and digital assets.\n\nTwo years after launching the initial certification, DACFP is keeping up with the times by tailoring the education and credentials to areas of emerging interest.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve discovered about half the people taking the course are not financial advisors,\u201d said DACFP founder Ric Edelman.\n\nAccording to Edelman, the thousands of people who have taken the virtual courses and earned the certification can be separated into four categories: financial advisors, non-advisor professionals working in the financial services industry, people working in the cryptocurrency industry, and a general category of investors and students.\n\nWith that in mind, Edelman said the certification is being expanded to four separate tracks customized for each category.\n\n\u201cIt was a big surprise to me, because we created the course for advisors and it\u2019s aimed at practice management issues and estate planning, and regulation and compliance.\u201d\n\nWhile the expanded market wasn\u2019t something Edelman had anticipated, he was expecting to make regular revisions to the virtual certification program to keep pace with the fast-changing crypto space.\n\n\u201cCrypto is evolving so rapidly the course was getting out of date and we had to update it,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo years ago, NFTs hadn\u2019t been invented yet, the metaverse was unheard of, and the FTX debacle hadn\u2019t occurred.\u201d\n\nChris Baker, director of business development at Fidelity Digital Assets, is seeing increasing demand among advisors for education around crypto even if those advisors are not ready to allocate clients in that direction yet.\n\n\u201cWhile some advisors remain skeptical of the digital assets space, many continue down the path of educating their teams and finding platforms that suit their clients\u2019 demand,\u201d Baker said. \u201cAdvisors recognize that the client demand for exposure to digital assets is not going away despite price fluctuation, yet many are surprised that it\u2019s not just their younger clients, but clients across the generational spectrum that are seeking exposure to digital assets.\u201d\n\nEdelman said that the certification changes weren\u2019t pegged to the unfolding issues facing the banking industry, but that he expects the crypto space to benefit from the high-profile failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, among the string of challenges facing traditional banks.\n\nHe cited the ongoing banking crisis among the reasons for the rally in the price of bitcoin, which is up 50% so far this year, including a 32% spike over the past week.\n\n\u201cIt is shocking to people that you can suddenly wake up and find that your bank account is gone, your deposits are frozen or completely gone,\u201d Edelman said. \u201cPeople are starting to ask the question if bitcoin is now safer than banking. This tech represents the newest form of money on a global scale. You could argue that that attitude is a little whacky, but it is nonetheless contributing to the price of bitcoin over the past week.\u201d\n\nTyrone Ross, co-founder and chief executive of Turnqey Labs, also believes the rally in digital assets is linked to the unfolding banking crisis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mainly because folks are looking at what is happening with the banks,\u201d he said. \u201cBased on conversations I\u2019ve had, people are realizing what all of us have been proselytizing about money being stuck in banks, real-time payment systems, and needing a third party for basic transfers of money. People are starting to wake up and realize what we\u2019ve been banging the table about.\u201d\n\nBeyond the events of the past week, Edelman said cryptocurrency is riding a longer-term trend that includes \u201ca massive amount of development in the technology because businesses are discovering it more advantageous than ever to integrate blockchain into business practices.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd governments around the globe are advancing their efforts of adoption around the technology,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s an arms race around the world to embrace crypto because governments recognize this technology creates a lot of high-paying green jobs.\u201d\n\nJack Neureuter, research analyst at Fidelity Digital Assets, attributed the strength of bitcoin to a \u201cnarrative shift in recent months regarding the reason why institutional investors are looking at bitcoin and digital assets as an investment to potentially include in their portfolio.\n\n\u201cLast year, the elevated levels of correlation between equity markets, particularly growth and technology, and crypto was clear and drove institutional investors to view bitcoin and other digital assets as high-risk, technology-like investments,\u201d Neureuter added. \u201cYear-to-date, we\u2019ve observed a breakdown in this correlation and notable positive price action in alternative store-of-value assets, like gold, alongside strong relative performance for bitcoin versus other digital assets.\u201d"

In comparison, Nubank \u2014 trading as NU \u2014 has risen only 26%.

Source: TradingView\n\nNevertheless, Buffett's investment has fared better than COIN over the past 12 months.\n\nAs of March 17, NU is down 38% year-over-year compared with COIN\u2019s 61.76%, nearly equal to Bitcoin\u2019s 37% losses in the same period.\n\nWarren Buffett sticks by his neobank investment\n\nBuffett\u2019s investment firm, Berkshire Hathaway, purchased $1.5 billion worth of class-A Nubank stock in two separate rounds in July 2021 and February 2022.\n\nThe news came as a surprise to many, as Buffett is a well-known cryptocurrency critic and Nubank offers crypto trading services via its Nucripto wing. In May 2022, the bank said that it would allocate 1% of its net assets to Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThis move reinforces the company\u2019s conviction in Bitcoin\u2019s current and future potential in disrupting financial services in the region,\u201d Nubank said at the time.\n\nBut despite Nubank\u2019s crypto exposure and NU\u2019s price decline, Buffett has not sold a single share, according to Berkshire\u2019s latest annual earnings report.\n\nThe decision to keep holding NU through a rough market likely coincides with Nubank\u2019s growth in the Latin American banking sector.\n\nNu Holdings, the parent company of Nubank, reported a solid 2022 with 140% year-on-year growth in revenue and a 38% year-over-year rise in active customers.\n\nCathie Wood doubles down on COIN in 2023\n\nThe same cannot be said about Coinbase\u2019s earnings in 2022 with its 57% drop in year-over-year revenue.\n\nRelated: Crypto acted as safe haven amid SVB and Signature bank run: Cathie Wood\n\nBut ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood appears unfazed and is continuing to buy COIN shares via her ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) and ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) in 2023. The COIN buys, in particular, account for roughly 30% of all the stock purchased so far this year.\n\nCOIN weight across ARK ETFs portfolios. Source: Ark Invest\n\nAs a result, Coinbase has become Wood\u2019s fifth-largest holding on record, worth nearly $670 million at the time of writing.\n\nHolding Bitcoin a better strategy?\n\nComparing Bitcoin\u2019s price performance with the market debut of Coinbase and Nu Holdings reaffirms that BTC not only regularly outperforms stocks in general but also crypto-exposure stocks \u2014 although exceptions have been seen, such as with the Bitcoin mining stock boom in 2021.\n\nBut overall, holding Bitcoin is proving to be a better strategy year-over-year, and likely with more upside potential, than traditional stocks.\n\nNotably, NU has dropped by more than 50% since its market debut in December 2021. Since then, BTC has fared better with a 44% decline in the same period.\n\nNU\u2019s returns since market debut vs. BTC.

        "title": "Bitcoin's Price Movement is 'Highly Predictable' on Set Days, Study Finds - Blockworks",
        "content": "Digital assets have been found to move in cyclical patterns based on volatility, leading to larger outsized returns.\n\nAn exhaustive study conducted by researchers at risk management and trading platform The Risk Protocol (TRP) found bellwether bitcoin volatility differed significantly depending on the time of day.\n\nMeasuring in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), TRP said hours two and 15 through 18 were found to be the most volatile, the study, titled \u201cThe Nature of the Beast,\u201d indicated.\n\nPut differently, by analyzing the average absolute return and absolute return standard deviation, it was revealed that crypto tends to move most during the 9 am start of the day across Asia and the US.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the volatility pattern in the US financial markets, it is typically U shaped, in the sense that it is higher at market opening and closing and lower in the middle,\u201d TRP CEO Karamvir Gosal told Blockworks.\n\nGosal added: \u201cIf traders are building a large position in crypto or trying to unwind one, they want to do so in periods of low volatility.\u201d\n\nVolatility can be described as the degree of variation of a financial instrument\u2019s price over time, and can manifest in either positive or negative moves.\n\nIt is often measured by the standard deviation of an asset\u2019s returns over a certain period. In other words, the higher the volatility, the more the price of the asset fluctuates, which implies a greater risk for investors.\n\nVolatility across Asia typically lasts for between five and six hours before dropping to its lowest point as parts of Europe approached late evening, the study found. Volatility then begins to pick up once again during US working hours, peaking by about 2 pm.\n\nWith people in the US starting a new trading day, \u201cwe would typically expect more trading activity during these hours,\u201d TRP said.\n\nLarge levels of exchange trading volumes have been witnessed occurring during those times, which is consistent with the analysis, researchers said.\n\nEthereum, too, was also shown to have the same volatility patterns as bitcoin, which makes sense given their close correlation during major market moves.\n\n\u201cFindings are not too surprising given the regular working hours around the world,\u201d TRP said. The study also found that, of the 50 digital assets it analyzed, Friday, offered up significantly higher volatility than other days.\n\nTo test the statistical significance of the results, the researchers conducted a mean difference test between Tuesday and other days and found the weekend offered the lowest levels of significant price changes.\n\nThe results are likely correlated to crypto\u2019s round-the-clock trading times compared to traditional markets, meaning more people are likely to trade during days when they are at work taking a break during the weekend, they said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Earlier Thursday, bitcoin briefly touched $25,000, which has been a key level watched by chart analysts.\n\nGlobal markets were further rocked this week after Credit Suisse revealed \"material weaknesses\" in its finances and the Saudi National Bank said it wouldn't invest additional capital to shore up the beleaguered Swiss lender.

        "content": "HODL is such a popular trading strategy in the crypto community that it has transcended into a meme.\n\nHODLers are flexing their muscles as they refuse to sell even if they are in profits.\n\nAdd to that the halving and we have the recipe for bitcoin rocket fuel.\n\nMany bitcoin traders laugh at the idea of HODL (holding on for dear life). They think that it is not a sound trading or investing strategy. If you buy and hold on the way down, it\u2019s very likely that you\u2019ll use the same approach on the way up. The rigidity of this method makes it difficult for many investors to lock in gains.\n\nNevertheless, the strategy is so popular that it has become a meme.\n\nHODL\u2019s acceptance appears to be bordering obsession. A new report reveals that millions of BTCs have not moved in a year.\n\nHolders Refuse To Sell Even If They Are In Deep Profits\n\nThe S&P 500 is up nearly 27% year-to-date. If the index closes the year with gains around that number, then many investors would consider 2019 as a good year.\n\nBitcoin holders are also having a great year. The top cryptocurrency is by over 95% year-to-date. The numbers align. According to The Block, 61% of bitcoin holders are sitting in profits .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven with gains that are over 250% higher than the S&P 500, there\u2019s a sense that bitcoin investors are far from satisfied. Many expect mind-numbing and jaw-dropping performance from the dominant cryptocurrency.\n\nI say this because BitInfoCharts show that 11.58 million BTCs have not moved in over a year.\n\nIn other words, 64% of the over 18.04 million bitcoin in circulation are not moving. This means that only 6.46 million BTCs are being used for speculation or payment settlement. At bitcoin\u2019s current price of $7,260, only $48.99 billion worth of BTCs have been changing hands over the last year.\n\nThis has tremendous bullish implications for the number one cryptocurrency.\n\nHODL Is Creating Immense Value For Bitcoin\n\nHaters like Peter Schiff always claim that bitcoin has no intrinsic value. They say that unlike gold which can be used for electronics, bitcoin doesn\u2019t have any utility. More importantly, it is not backed by anything that can prove its value.\n\nWell, bitcoin\u2019s value comes from its scarcity. There will only be 21 million BTCs in existence. On top of that, around 4 million BTCs are lost . The scarcity is real.\n\nWe spoke to Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics and asked whether 11.58 million being HODLed has long-term bull bullish implications. He told CCN,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes\n\nThe analyst then referred us to one of his recent tweets.\n\nTrader Max echoes Mati Greenspan\u2019s sentiments. The trader told CCN,\n\nThere are too many variables at play but scarcity is a good price driver.\n\nThe good news for HODLers is that bitcoin is about to get more scarce in the coming months.\n\nHalving Very Likely To Make Bitcoin More Valuable\n\nIf analysts believe that scarcity drives the price of bitcoin, then it would be fair to assume that the top cryptocurrency\u2019s value would soar in the coming months. In about six months, bitcoin block rewards will be reduced by half from 12.5 BTC down to 6.25 BTC. This means that there will only be around 900 BTCs issued to miners on a daily basis.\n\nThe dramatic drop in supply due to the halving would alleviate selling pressure at the very least. The reduction in selling is likely to drive prices higher. That might be more than enough to trigger a massive buying frenzy.\n\nTherefore, HODL and halving are two of bitcoin\u2019s strongest narratives.\n\nDisclaimer: The above should not be considered trading advice from CCN.

        "content": "Bitcoin rose in Friday morning trading in Asia to near the US$25,000 mark. Ether and the rest of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also gained as global equity markets stabilized following moves by authorities in the U.S. and Europe to backstop banks with cash after a series of failures in the industry this past week threatened to spread. BNB led the crypto winners as a U.S. court overruled government objections and approved the Binance US$1 billion deal to buy bankrupt crypto lender Voyager.\n\nSee related article: US, Germany shut ChipMixer for alleged ties to US$3 bln crypto laundering\n\nFast facts\n\nBitcoin rose 2.75% in the past 24 hours to US$24,973 at 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency jumped 24% over the past seven days, the largest gain among the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Some commentators argue Bitcoin acted as a safe haven for investors as bank failures shook global equity markets this week.\n\nEther edged up 1.32% to trade at US$1,668, a gain of 17% for the past seven days.\n\nBNB, the native token of the Binance crypto exchange, led the winners on Friday with a 7.56% jump to US$327.98. A U.S. court judge on Wednesday rejected the government\u2019s appeal to block a US$1 billion offer by Binance U.S. to buy the assets of the failed Voyager platform. The token added 19.51% for the seven-day-period.\n\nPolygon\u2019s Matic token climbed 2.88% to US$1.14, logging a weekly gain of 14.04%. Salesforce, one of the world\u2019s biggest enterprise software firms with a market cap of more than US$150 billion, has entered a partnership with Polygon blockchain to help its clients build non-fungible token-related (NFT) programs, according to a tweet by Polygon Labs on Thursday. Saleforce previously launched a suite of customer relationship management tools for Web3 developers.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization rose 1.91% in the past 24 hours to US$1.08 trillion. Total trading volume over the last 24 hours fell 25.30% to US$61.92 billion.\n\nU.S. equities closed higher in a relief rally on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved up 1.17%, the S&P 500 rose 1.76%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 2.48%.\n\nThe gains in equities came after Credit Suisse on Thursday said it would borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs (US$54 billion) from the Swiss National Bank to shore up liquidity. On the U.S. side, 11 U.S. financial institutions injected US$30 billion into First Republic Bank on Thursday after the bank\u2019s share price fell sharply on fears of a bank run.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Congress on Thursday that the U.S. \u201cbanking system remains sound\u201d, and \u201cthe Federal Reserve is providing additional support to the banking system with a new lending facility.\u201d\n\nOn the inflation front, the U.S. Department of Labor on Thursday reported a drop in unemployment benefit claims in the week ending March 11 that was more than expected, indicating a strong labor market that supports the view the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again this month.\n\nU.S. interest rates are between 4.5% to 4.75%, the highest since October 2007. Analysts at the CME Group expect a 79.7% chance the Fed will raise rates by 25 basis points this month. The chance of no rate increase is at 20.3%, down from 45.4% on Thursday.\n\nThe U.S. consumer price index (CPI) rose 6% on year in February, a deceleration from 6.4% in January, but still well above the Fed\u2019s goal to keep annual inflation below 2%.\n\nU.S. stock futures traded flat to lower as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures off 0.14%. The S&P 500 futures dipping 0.11%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index treaded water with a dip of 0.03%.\n\nSee related article: Ripple executives say XRP lawsuit ruling will have little impact on global business operations"

        "content": "The number of Bitcoin transactions waiting to be confirmed by the network reached its highest point since Terra imploded last week \u2014 a sign of renewed interest in the premiere blockchain.\n\nOn the afternoon of Mar. 9, nearly 81,000 transactions briefly sat in Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cmempool\u201d \u2014 a data structure that stores valid transactions yet to be added to the blockchain.\n\nThat was just 1,000 shy of last year\u2019s peak on May 13, as algorithmic stablecoin UST was crashing to zero, and 66% more than the 48,000 sitting unconfirmed in mid-November following FTX\u2019s sudden implosion.\n\nMempool spikes like these can occur when there is a surge in network usage, although a sudden drop in mining power can have the same effect.\n\nOnly so much transactional data can fit into each Bitcoin block (averaging to around 2,000 transactions). When there\u2019s an excess, users must wait for their transactions to flow through the mempool.\n\nUsers can incentivize miners to process their transactions first with higher fees. So when the mempool really fills up, miners may opt to only process transactions with more bitcoin attached \u2014 or even set a minimum fee \u2014 leaving those with smaller fees to wait.\n\nWhen this happens, the mempool is often left with a large amount of unconfirmed, low-fee transactions. So, higher fees are considered one of the primary causes of mempool surges; fees rise along with demand for blockspace.\n\nUnconfirmed transaction count hit record highs beyond 256,000 in Dec. 2017, when BTC hit $20,000 for the first time (source)\n\nOftentimes, mempools spike when service providers consolidate transactions that have occurred off-chain all at once, Bitcoin developer Rene Pickhardt told Blockworks.\n\nThese consolidations would be somewhat easy to spot in the mempool \u2014 lots of transactions added all at once with rather small fees.\n\nBitcoin transaction fees still low compared to the bull run\n\nBut why did the Bitcoin mempool spike last week?\n\nHo Chan Chung, head of marketing at analysis platform CryptoQuant, pointed Blockworks to a jump in trading volumes across spot and perpetuals markets for both bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) as USDC fell below $0.90 on Mar. 11.\n\nThe mempool could have reflected those transactions attempting to be settled on-chain.\n\nBut unconfirmed transactions peaked about 30 hours before top-two stablecoin USDC depegged from the US dollar, an event which spilled over to a number of other stablecoins, including DAI.\n\nThe number of unconfirmed transactions also quickly subsided, before USDC briefly sank to all-time lows.\n\nUnconfirmed transactions built up and then subsided\u2026 before building up again over the past few days\n\nIf the surge were related, it would mean a large number of stablecoin holders all traded their tokens for bitcoin in the lead up to Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s failure on Mar. 10, anticipating negative impacts on the wider crypto ecosystem. Service providers would\u2019ve then had to consolidate those transactions on-chain, perhaps all at once.\n\nIt\u2019s hypothetically possible. (Ethereum also saw a slight rise in unconfirmed transactions around the depeg, during the event, rather than in the days leading up to it). But pseudonymous Bitcoin developer 0xB10C wasn\u2019t convinced.\n\n\u201cGenerally, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s related to the depeg if that was 30 hours later,\u201d they told Blockworks. \u201cIt seems like someone broadcast many blocks of transactions around that time at a lowish fee rate of 2 sat/vB.\u201d\n\nThose might have been consolidations, and \u201ccombined with the normal intraday activity and some larger Ordinal inscription transactions that are frequent currently, this did probably caused feerate estimators in wallets to suggest a higher fee rate,\u201d 0xB10C said.\n\nRight now, Bitcoin users can get a transaction processed in around 29 minutes for 22 sat/vB ($0.825), according to mempool.space. Those in a hurry can pay around 48 sat/vB ($1.78) to have miners add their transactions in the next block (processed in 10 minutes) \u2014 far less than the average during the heat of the last bull market, when it hit more than $60 per transaction.\n\nLoading Tweet.. A similar occurrence happened earlier, on Mar. 8, which kickstarted the mempool surge\n\n(NB: There is no global \u201cBitcoin mempool.\u201d Every node has their own mempool with their own data set, although they can be quite similar, 0xB10C said.)\n\nHow much Bitcoin mempool is too much mempool?\n\nColin Harper, head of research and content at Bitcoin mining pool Luxor, agreed that Ordinal inscriptions are a significant driver of transaction fees right now.\n\n\u201cBitcoin price volatility typically increases transaction volume and I believe we\u2019re seeing that now as well, but if it weren\u2019t for inscriptions taking up so much for blockspace, fees would be lower than they are right now,\u201d Harper said.\n\nThere are currently about 52,600 unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions. Mempool weight (the size of the data contained in the mempool) is around 222 vMB. Bitcoin Core\u2019s default maximum mempool limit is 300MB.\n\nAll this begs the question: At what point does this become a problem?\n\n\u201cOnce the mempool data structure (transactions and a bit of overhead per transactions) reaches 300 MB of system memory, low feerate transactions aren\u2019t accepted anymore and some might also be dropped,\u201d 0xB10C said.\n\nOrdinals have been popular, but they still contribute a minute portion of Bitcoin mining revenue\n\nNot all node operators use the 300MB default, though. Some set higher limits to avoid dropping low feerate transactions. With this in mind, it\u2019s not exactly true that the Bitcoin network is \u201ccongested\u201d when the mempool fills up \u2014 transactions will still be processed, it\u2019s just that they may be more expensive.\n\nThat\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, either, according to Jeff Yew, founder of digital asset manager Monochrome.\n\n\u201cLike the layered banking settlement and payments infrastructure, the increased demand and ultimately cost for base-layer bitcoin settlements is a good thing,\u201d Yew said.\n\n\u201cIt further strengthens the security of the network, while encouraging the development and use of second-layer solutions, such as the Lightning Network, for day-to-day payments.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "How Bitcoin and other magic internet money loans endanger your financial health - Salon",
        "content": "The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) last week raises serious issues far more significant than the obvious ones cited by the financial press and a broad range of Washington politicians.\n\nChief among these are bank loans against dubious assets. That's not getting much if any attention in the news or from Washington and is likely to soon be swept under the rug, allowing needlessly risky banking practices to continue.\n\nBefore its collapse last week, SVB made loans against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe question: why is any bank anywhere allowed to accept crypto as collateral for loans?\n\nBitcoin and its imitators are not money. They are not currency. They're hardly used to buy and sell, an unsurprising fact given that by design the Bitcoin system can process only seven transactions per second compared to many thousands of transactions per second for credit cards.\n\nIndeed, except for laundering proceeds from drug trafficking as well as hiding assets from creditors, estranged spouses, and the tax police, cryptocurrencies have no use.\n\nHigh-tech Ponzi Scheme\n\nCryptocurrencies and their cousins, Non-Fungible Tokens or NFTs\u2014are just a high-tech Ponzi scheme. Instead of Charlie Ponzi or Bernie Madoff personally running the con, the crypto scam relies on decentralized computer blockchain and \"mining\" of mathematical solutions.\n\nBitcoin's supposed inventor, who went by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, has never been identified. He or she has since vanished, leaving holders with a digital string worth only as much as the next fool, or crook, will pay for this imaginary asset.\n\nEarly participants in Ponzi schemes profit mightily if they cash out while the gullible souls who get sucked in later wipe out. That is what happened to SVB, America's 16th largest bank, which was big on crypto loans.\n\nMany Bitcoin \"investors\" have already been wiped out as the \"market cap\" of Bitcoin plummeted from nearly $1.3 trillion in 2021 to about $389 billion on Friday, down almost 70%.\n\nWhy do banking regulators allow our federally insured and regulated banks to make loans using magic internet money as collateral? That's a crazy policy, no different than allowing banks to accept buckets of ice cubes in winter as collateral, even though they melt come spring and evaporate in summer\n\nSilicon Valley Bank is just one of many federally insured financial institutions that accept crypto currency as collateral for loans. Some banks will loan you 90% of the seemingly value of your crypto, though 50% loan-to-value is more common and that appears to be the standard at SVB based on its web pages.\n\nZero Interest Crypto Loans\n\nAll sorts of financial news outlets offer advice on borrowing against crypto. These include NerdWallet, and the increasingly na\u00efve and unreliable Forbes. People with crypto can even borrow at zero interest. Gadzooks!\n\nFor a sober look at the big risks of crypto loans read Investopedia's essay.\n\nIn the wake of the second largest bank failure in history, you should be deeply concerned that for more than four decades we have failed miserably at regulating banks. That history contrasts with the period from 1935 until voters abandoned the moderating and successful New Deal banking rules in favor of Reaganomics.\n\nWe took a wrong turn when the prudent New Deal banking regulations in effect from 1935 were killed by Reaganomics, which re-regulated banks to reduce regulations and increase the risk of financial institutions failing. (There is no such thing as deregulation, only new regulation, which in our time on terms typically means regulations favoring corporations, including banks, over customers, financial prudence, and public safety.)\n\nCongress's Role\n\nWhat we need now are Congressional hearings to examine the reasons that cryptocurrencies can be collateral for bank loans.\n\nContact the White House in writing via the hypertext link or call 202-456-1111 to demand a ban on crypto as loan collateral. Call 202-456-1111.\n\nEven if you don't own Bitcoin or its growing list of alternatives this story matters to you for multiple reasons.\n\nYour money is only insured up to $250,000. Any money above that isn't insured. That means if you're a trustee of a nonprofit, for example, and it's got $1 million in the bank you or the organization you help lead is at risk of being wiped out in a bank failure.\n\nThe federal government is covering all deposits for SVB and at Signature Bank in New York, which failed Sunday. But that doesn't mean it always will. During an earlier banking crisis nonprofits with more than the guarantee then in effect of $100,000 lost their deposits above that sum, which got very little news coverage at the time.\n\nIf people want to buy crypto, they should be free to do so. But they should not be allowed to put our bank deposits and investments at risk by using these digital tokens as collateral for loans. After all, it's your, and my bank deposits, along with those of businesses, nonprofits, and our governments that the banks use to make loans, so it's not like we don't have a deep interest in blocking crypto of any kind as collateral for loans."

        "content": "Crypto donations worth hundreds of millions of dollars have supported Ukrainian war efforts.\n\nThe decentralized nature of crypto allows digital currencies to be traded quickly, making them a useful tool for getting money into conflict zones.\n\nGiven the potential benefits and risks associated with crypto, public and private organizations across sectors are considering new regulations.\n\nDigital tools have significantly influenced the war in Ukraine. The conflict is one of the most well-documented military campaigns in history and marks the first major cyberwar between two countries. Crypto has also played a prominent role in the war.\n\nToday, as the conflict enters its second year, over $212 million worth of crypto has been donated to pro-Ukrainian war efforts, according to Elliptic, a blockchain analytics firm. This includes roughly $80 million worth of crypto going directly to the Ukrainian government.\n\n\u201c The people of Ukraine are grateful for the support and donations from the global crypto community as we protect our freedom. \u201d \u2014 Ukrainian government on Twitter, May 2022\n\nThe decentralized nature of crypto allows digital currencies to be traded quickly, making them a useful tool for getting money into conflict and disaster zones.\n\n\u201cAn important benefit of these emerging technologies is the ability to mobilize, organize and deliver very quickly,\u201d said Brynly Llyr, Head of Blockchain and Digital Assets at the World Economic Forum. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this play out in real time in Ukraine where you saw millions of aid delivered in a day.\u201d\n\nChainalysis, another major blockchain analysis firm, reported that in the first month of the war, the Ukrainian government received more than $56 million in crypto donations. Most of the donations, Chainalysis found, have been made in bitcoin and ethereum.\n\nLoading...\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are unique digital assets generally created in a blockchain, have also been used to support the war efforts. For example, Ukraine DAO\u2014a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) set up to harness \u201cthe power of Web3 tech and community to defend Ukraine,\u201d according to the online collective\u2014auctioned off a Ukrainian flag NFT for $6.75 million.\n\n\u201cAlthough such donations pale in comparison to fiat donations, they demonstrate the philanthropy of cryptocurrency enthusiasts across the globe and Ukraine\u2019s willingness to accept a wide variety of digital assets,\u201d Chainalysis noted in a recent report.\n\nCrypto is also being used to support Russia, albeit to a lesser degree. Chainalysis reported that roughly 100 pro-Russian groups have raised around $5.4 million worth of crypto over the past year. Meanwhile, Elliptic found that total pro-Ukrainian crypto fundraising since the war began tops pro-Russian funding by 44 to one.\n\nIn recent years, the use of cryptocurrencies has increased in economies around the world. The adoption has varied across industries ranging from gaming to banking and has been fueled by economic trends like inflation.\n\n\u201cYou clearly see that economies with a weak national currency and a currency that might have a lot of inflation, those ones are typically the first ones to jump into crypto and see it as another good way to pay each other and to store value,\u201d Michael Gronager, the CEO of Chainalysis, said in an interview during the World Economic Forum\u2019s Annual Meeting 2023 in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nIn 2022, Ukraine ranked third in Chainalysis\u2019 Global Crypto Adoption Index; Russia ranked ninth. Both countries, which experienced significant inflation and economic distribution because of the war, saw increases in crypto transfers immediately following the invasion, Chainalysis found.\n\n\u201c The war has affected virtually all aspects of life in the two countries, and cryptocurrency is no exception. \u201d \u2014 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report 2022, Chainalysis\n\nMoreover, there has been widespread concern about Russian efforts to use crypto to raise funds and evade international sanctions. Elliptic reported that over 10% of pro-Russian crypto donations come from illicit sources like sanctioned entities or cybercrime activities.\n\nYet experts also note that the scale of sanctions evasion through crypto remains limited\u2014and continue to urge robust monitoring of illicit crypto efforts. \u201cOur research showed that cryptocurrency markets likely aren\u2019t liquid enough to support mass scale, systematic sanctions evasion,\u201d Chainalysis stated in a report.\n\nIn 2022, Ukraine ranked third in Chainalysis\u2019 Global Crypto Adoption Index; Russia ranked ninth. Image: REUTERS/Viacheslav Ratynskyi\n\nGiven the potential benefits and risks associated with crypto\u2014including sanctions evasion, cybercrimes and market volatility\u2014public and private organizations across sectors are considering new regulations.\n\nThe European Union, for example, is advancing a law known as the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), which would create a new regulatory regime to improve crypto financial tracking systems and legal compliance. The International Monetary Fund also recently released a 9-point guide on the handling of crypto assets for member countries. The guidelines are far from agreed upon, according to experts, but aim to provide an initial policy framework for governments.\n\nIn January, the World Economic Forum unveiled a DAO Toolkit that outlines how law-makers and entrepreneurs can engage with the growing DAO ecosystem. The toolkit outlines recommendations on DAO voting processes, governance procedures and legal frameworks.\n\n\u201cAlthough DAOs today manage billions of dollars\u2019 worth of assets, engage millions of contributors and operate across industries as diverse as finance and philanthropy, basic questions regarding operations, governance, law and policy are only just beginning to be addressed by policy-makers, regulators and entrepreneurs,\u201d the report notes."

        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rose 36.06% in the week from March 10 to March 17, to trade at US$26,795 at 7:00 p.m. on Friday in Hong Kong. Ether rose 26.67% in the same period to US$1,750.\n\nHowever, equity markets had a turbulent (understatement) week due to fears that cracks were appearing in the U.S. banking system.\n\nIt started the week prior when Silvergate Bank went into voluntary liquidation after a bank run and its shares plunged. Regulators then quickly shut down Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, two major lenders to the technology and crypto industries, to avoid panic and the risk of a systemic bank failure.\n\nIt was serious enough that U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen contacted the White House on the weekend of March 11 to get approval from President Joe Biden to initiate the takeovers. Treasury then put out a joint statement with fellow heavyweights, the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, assuring they would provide a backstop for U.S. banks.\n\nBiden repeated the same message during the week as traders drove down the shares of other U.S. regional banks. The focus shifted to Europe when global investment bank Credit Suisse started to wobble, prompting a US$54 billion lifeline from the Swiss National Bank. On the U.S. side, 11 financial institutions had to step up to inject US$30 billion into First Republic Bank after its share price tanked.\n\nWrong focus?\n\nDespite the spreading woes in the banking industry, Bitcoin remained resilient and only briefly fell to US$19,654 on March 10, before reclaiming the US$20,000 level the next day and then moving higher through the week.\n\n\u201cWhile the U.S. banking system was seizing up in response to bank runs threatening regional banks, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto networks didn\u2019t skip a beat,\u201d tweeted Cathie Wood, the founder and chief executive officer of investment management giant Ark Invest.\n\nAmid recent regulatory crackdowns on crypto platforms, Wood seemingly could not resist driving home the point:\n\n\u201cInstead of blocking decentralized, transparent, auditable and well-functioning financial platforms with no central points of failure, regulators should have been focused on the centralized and opaque points of failure looming in the traditional banking system.\u201d\n\nDented\n\nJames Wo, the founder and chief executive officer of crypto investment firm DFG, shares Wood\u2019s sentiment.\n\n\u201cThe market\u2019s confidence in traditional finance was dented, leading to a shift of funds to the crypto market,\u201d wrote Wo, in a LinkedIn response. Bitcoin \u201chas shown its superior risk and inflation resistance as an alternative asset, and will be further recognized by the mainstream,\u201d he said.\n\nBitcoin then rose above the US$26,000 mark on Tuesday after the release of the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI), which indicated a drop in the annual inflation rate to 6% in February.\n\nHowever, Jamie Douglas Coutts, senior market structure analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said Bitcoin\u2019s rally was really driven by the earthquake in U.S. banking, not the CPI reading.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has been strongly bid since last Friday when it became clear the U.S. banking system was in trouble. The real story is the 25% rally from then. The spike to US$26,000 on the CPI print is noise, because the number came in line with expectations and it quickly fell back below US$25,000 \u2013 a level which I believe is critically important from a technical perspective,\u201d wrote Coutts to Forkast.\n\nHedging\n\nSlava Demchuk, the co-founder of AMLBot, a developer of crypto anti-money laundering software, attributed Bitcoin\u2019s rally to hedging by investors.\n\n\u201c[Bitcoin\u2019s rally] is not necessarily due to a widespread recognition of the non-custodial potential of digital assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, but as a means to safeguard against traditional financial systems,\u201d wrote Demchuk.\n\nBonnie Cheung, head of strategy at Sending Labs, a software firm building Web3 communication protocols, said that the global government interventions will help Bitcoin reach new highs.\n\n\u201cThe rapid move by the Swiss government to support Credit Suisse has certainly given the market an olive branch to hold onto for the coming weeks. This, together with the action by the US government, has now set a precedent,\u201d said Cheung.\n\n\u201cThe expectation is that governments will not hesitate to swoop in should any major banking crisis start to unfold in the next few weeks. This will further ignite the bullish sentiment and build the narrative to push Bitcoin to test new highs,\u201d wrote Cheung.\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.14 trillion on Friday at 7:00 p.m. in Hong Kong, up 23% from US$923 billion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin\u2019s US$520 billion market cap accounted for 45.2% of the market, while Ether\u2019s US$215 billion accounted for 18.7%.\n\nSee related article: Banks are bringing systemic risks to crypto, says Circle\u2019s Disparte\n\nBiggest gainers: CFX, STX rise over 100%\n\nCFX, the utility token of Conflux Network, China\u2019s only public blockchain, was this week\u2019s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap. CFX rose 105.99% during the week to trade at US$0.317.\n\nThe token started gaining momentum after Conflux announced that KuCoin Ventures invested US$10 million in the protocol. Conflux also introduced CNHC, a CNH stablecoin for cross-border payments.\n\nSTX, the native token of Stacks, Bitcoin\u2019s smart contract layer, was the week\u2019s second-biggest gainer, up 100.13% to US$1.09.\n\nThe token has seen increased interest after its upcoming hard fork, Stacks 2.1., was announced for March 20. The upgrade aims to create a stronger interconnection between Stacks and Bitcoin by introducing decentralized mining pools, improved bridges and enable compatibility between Stacks-native assets \u2013 like Ordinals \u2013 and Bitcoin wallets.\n\nNext week: Bitcoin to US$28,000?\n\n\u201cRight now, systemic risk is front and center in the minds of investors,\u201d wrote Coutts. \u201cWhilst this banking crisis seemed to have started in the U.S. the situation in Europe with Deutsche and Credit Suisse has been a slow-moving train crash for years,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cShort term is not my forte but if we finish with a weekly close above the $25,000 then I would have to adjust my model regime to bullish as that would signal we have completed a bottoming process which started in mid-2022 and a new bull cycle is underway,\u201d added Coutts.\n\nDFG\u2019s Wo said macroeconomic trends in the U.S., upcoming interest rate hikes, and the global banking woes will remain the main determinants of traditional and crypto markets in the coming weeks.\n\nKadan Stadelmann, chief technical officer of blockchain infrastructure development firm Komodo, said the fragile economic landscape in the U.S. is currently the main driver of Bitcoin prices.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Reserve embarked upon a many-trillion dollar quantitative easing program, cut the minimum bank reserves from 10% to 0% on March 26, 2020, and led us into the current bout with inflation, which has led people to seek alternative ways to preserve wealth. Bitcoin has become a prominent option,\u201c wrote Stadelmann.\n\n\u201cBitcoin won\u2019t see any resistance until the US$30,000 level for now. If a systemically important bank such as Credit Suisse collapses, it could bring the market down to US$9,000-13,000,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, when markets collapsed, Bitcoin was among the first commodities to rebound. Bitcoin is still well off its all-time highs and could quickly double to retake its old highs, especially if the Fed reverses course and embarks upon another quantitative easing program,\u201d said Stadelmann.\n\nMayank Shekhar, co-founder and chief technology officer of play-to-earn game One World Nation, said Bitcoin is being increasingly perceived as a store of value and he expects it to trade between US$24,000-27,000 next week in the run up to the Fed meeting on interest rates on March 21 and 22.\n\nAziz Kenjaev, head of partnerships at decentralized crypto exchange GammaX Exchange, expects the crypto market to cool before the Fed\u2019s interest rate decision.\n\n\u201cThe Fed is expected to raise rates by 25 basis points, any number above this projection will act as a strong bearish sentiment for the U.S. dollar, and a strong bullish sentiment for Bitcoin. In this regard, I\u2019m expecting Bitcoin to reach US$28,100 next week.\u201d\n\n(Updates to trim repetition, add sub-heads.)"

        "content": "To get a roundup of TechCrunch\u2019s biggest and most important crypto stories delivered to your inbox every Thursday at 12 p.m. PT, subscribe here.\n\nWelcome back to Chain Reaction.\n\nIt\u2019s been an insanely busy and chaotic past seven days. Unless you live under a rock, you probably know what I\u2019m talking about. But for those who don\u2019t (or just want a recap), let\u2019s get into it.\n\nLast week, a few massive U.S. banks made headlines. Signature Bank, a crypto-friendly New York regional bank, was closed by regulators due to systemic risk that could threaten the U.S. banking system. This closure came just days after Silicon Valley Bank crashed and Silvergate Capital wound down its operations.\n\nSignature, known as one of the largest crypto lenders, was the second casualty from the ongoing banking crisis in the U.S., but regulators said that its customers will be made whole, meaning the government is stepping in to protect the economy from further damage.\n\nFor reference, Signature Bank had 40 branches across New York, California, Connecticut, North Carolina and Nevada. As of December 31, 2022, the bank had $110.4 billion in total assets and total deposits of $82.6 billion. Around 30% of the bank\u2019s deposits came from the crypto industry.\n\nGoing forward, the crypto industry needs to watch closely for deposit flight from regional banks over the next week, Tegan Kline, chief business officer and co-founder of Edge & Node, said. \u201cIf it gets worse, the regulators have a tremendous problem on their hands. Many regional banks may have to close.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of all the banking chaos, bitcoin and ether, the biggest cryptocurrencies by market cap, had a seven-day increase of about 15% and 8%, respectively, at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data. The global market cap for all cryptocurrencies also increased 8.3% during the same time period to about $1.1 trillion, slightly down from a weekly high of $1.14 trillion on Tuesday, the data showed.\n\nThe overall market turmoil has seemingly created a bullish sentiment in the crypto economy, however, as traders responded positively to the news and the overall market cap rose on the week.\n\nThis week in web3\n\nChaos in US banks could push crypto industry toward decentralization (TC+)\n\nThe crypto industry lost a number of banking on- and off-ramps due to recent collapses in the U.S. banking industry, signaling that there may be a shift in the space toward decentralization and a need for regulation going forward. With these banks\u2019 closure, it will become difficult for cryptocurrency businesses to move money between entities and access banking services, Mina Tadrus, CEO of quant investment management firm Tadrus Capital LLC and general partner of Tadrus Capital Fund, said. \u201cFurthermore, such closures could mean reduced trust from investors who may no longer be aware of the necessary safeguards involved in their bank transactions.\u201d\n\nSVB\u2019s mess could become stablecoins\u2019 problem (TC+)\n\nAfter USDC depegged from $1 last week, many in the crypto industry are questioning whether Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s collapse will have bigger implications on the stablecoin ecosystem. If anything, this latest market event \u201cwill trigger more interest in the stablecoin sector among global regulators,\u201d said Lucas Kiely, chief investment officer of digital wealth platform Yield App. \u201cThis can only be a good thing for the industry, which needs much clearer guidelines for more institutions to enter.\u201d\n\nMeta winds down support for NFTs on Instagram and Facebook\n\nLooks like Meta is NGMI, as some might put it. Meta\u2019s head of commerce and financial technologies, Stephane Kasriel, posted on Twitter that the company will sunset its NFT and digital collectibles features on Instagram and Facebook. This short-lived product only began testing with select Instagram creators last May, plus some Facebook users in June. By July, Meta expanded NFT support on Instagram for creators in 100 countries. Less than a year later, Meta is moving on from NFTs\u2026RIP.\n\nHackers steal around $200 million from crypto lender Euler Finance\n\nEuler Finance, a non-custodial DeFi protocol, was exploited of about $197 million in crypto on Monday. While this sounds like a lot of money \u2014 and it is \u2014 it\u2019s only the 26th largest crypto theft ever, according to the Rekt Database, which tracks DeFi scams, hacks and exploits. Since then, the team behind the protocol has launched a $1 million reward for information leading to the attacker\u2019s arrest and return of the funds.\n\nIndia probing \u2018several\u2019 crypto cases for money laundering, seizes over $115 million\n\nIndia\u2019s Enforcement Directorate is investigating \u201cseveral\u201d crypto cases for money-laundering schemes and has seized $115.5 million to date in such crimes, the Ministry of Finance said, the latest in a series of crackdown by the authorities on the nascent space. The disclosure comes at a time when India is pushing ahead with rules to better scrutinize the activities of cryptocurrency firms, even as until now New Delhi has resisted formulating a blanket law to regulate the virtual digital assets.\n\nThe latest pod\n\nFor last week\u2019s episode, Jacquelyn interviewed Jack Mallers, the founder and CEO of Strike, a bitcoin-based payment network and financial app that is trying to grow cross-border payments and remittance markets. Last year, Mallers\u2019 company raised $80 million in a Series B round to grow into that space and also has partnered with major companies like Visa, Clover and Fiserv.\n\nMallers is also the CEO of Zap, a bitcoin investment and payments company that transacts on the Lightning Network, which is a second layer on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain that allows for off-chain transactions between parties.\n\nWe discussed Mallers\u2019 backstory, how he got into the Bitcoin scene in his late teenage years, whether the lightning network could be better than the payment networks that exist today and how big players could get into the space.

        "title": "Silicon Valley Bank collapse: Crypto advocates call out 'opaque' financial system - Euronews",
        "content": "The Silicon Valley Bank collapse shows cryptocurrency and blockchain are superior technology for running the financial system, say crypto advocates.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), the biggest bank failure in the US since the 2008 global recession, set off panic around the world as governments tried to assess its impact on tech start-ups, other financial institutions and even pension funds.\n\nBut crypto executives and investors - who have endured an extremely volatile market over the past year - seized on the moment to say \u201cI told you so\u201d.\n\n\u201cA lot of us believe that cryptocurrency and blockchain are superior technology for running the financial system,\u201d said Brad Nickel, who hosts the crypto podcast Mission: DeFi.\n\n\u201cSilicon Valley Bank, FTX, the mortgage crisis of 2008, [they all become] an opportunity to point out that our financial system that we all everywhere in the world rely upon is opaque and centrally controlled by human beings,\u201d he told Euronews Next.\n\n\u201cRegulators, investors, and banks could have seen how badly things were being run. The same is true of Silicon Valley Bank. We had no insights into what their financial situation was except for what they reported\u201d.\n\nBlockchain transactions are more transparent\n\nBitcoin, the world\u2019s first decentralised currency, \u201cwas designed precisely because of bank collapses in 2008,\u201d said Joe Donnelly, head of marketing at NiceHash, the leading cryptocurrency platform for mining.\n\n\u201cThe SVB collapse highlights how Bitcoin is important to the economy; it provides an alternative to the banking system where you don't have to rely on someone else doing things that you're not necessarily even aware of,\u201d he told Euronews Next.\n\nWhen politicians and regulators speak against crypto, they \u201ceither don't understand how the system functions and the power and transparency it gives [them] to catch scammers before they do something wrong or, they're being disingenuous because they're concerned about the loss of control in the financial sector for governments,\u201d Nickel added.\n\nThe counter-crypto defence\n\nDespite the growing list of crypto supporters jumping to scold and shame financiers, critics of the crypto space have not hesitated to point out how a crypto-centric version of Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s failure would have been much worse.\n\nIn the coming days, the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) will refund SVB\u2019s depositors up to $250,000 (\u20ac206,000) while overseeing a process to recover the lost funds. The US government has also stepped in to prevent more bank runs.\n\nBitcoin and altcoin advocates, on the other hand, would have no saviour to come and support them if the crypto system collapses.\n\n\u201cWe've never had to have a bailout. We've never had to have the government come in and save people because the system worked the way it was supposed to,\u201d Nickel said.\n\nIf a protocol is failing, if developers are doing something wrong, \u201cthe system knows, the people know, they can all see it and can be alerted,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cSo, when you invest money, you're investing in something that is completely clear to be seen. And you can find out beforehand if something is going wrong,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cRegulators don't have that power now\u201d.\n\nTwo banks with strong crypto-focused failed. Why?\n\nIt also didn't take long for crypto critics to point fingers at the many crypto-friendly venture capital funds Silicon Valley Bank had. Likewise, Silvergate Capital and Signature - two other American banks that also failed last week - also had a strong strong crypto focus.\n\nNickel and Downie concur that the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX and trading house Alameda Research in November 2022 could have played a role in the failure of these crypto-focused banks.\n\n\"I think probably this was the fallout from all the FTX\u2026 there was so much money involved in it,\" said Downie.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The impacts from that were certainly being felt. You had a lot of start-ups in the crypto space who had their deposits in Silvergate, a lot of investors,\" Nickel added.\n\nThe FTX crash exposed an $8 billion hole (\u20ac7.5 billion) in its accounts, and more than a million people were reportedly affected by the collapse.\n\nBut the collapse was not crypto\u2019s fault, Nickel is quick to clarify.\n\nFTX bought and sold cryptocurrencies, but the problem was their financial backing: their bank accounts were opaque.\n\n\"A lot of people trusted what they were doing and trusted that they had the funds that they were supposed to have\u2026 but what they did, did not happen in the open, transparently for the world to see,\" he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere is another caveat that is important to understand: Silvergate Bank ran a traditional finance system trying to deal with a different financial model that does \"not necessarily share the same nature and behaviour\".\n\nBecause of the very volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, \u201cpeople in this space are more likely to move money more rapidly than would happen in the traditional banking sector; because we're so used to being able to move our money,\u201d says Nickel.\n\nAnd the banks are not used to these rapid fluctuations, so they panic, they fall, and then ultimately also hurt crypto.\n\n\"Despite the fact that cryptocurrencies are not centralised, they are still conditioned by the market\u2026 And initially, they went down because people still panic,\" said Downie. \"But then they've bounced back quite strong\".\n\nWas Signature Bank seized to send a message about crypto?\n\nThere is another possible rationale behind the collapse of crypto-friendly banks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn Tuesday, Barney Frank, a former member of the US Congress who was on Signature\u2019s board said the regulatory takeover of the New York-based bank was intended to send a message to other US banks to stay away from the cryptocurrency business.\n\nHe said that despite a wave of withdrawals, the bank\u2019s situation was under control before regulators swooped in.\n\n\"This was just a way to tell people, \u2018We don\u2019t want you dealing with crypto,\u2019\u201d Frank said in an interview with the Associated Press.\n\nNickel says he is not a big believer in conspiracy theories, \"but when somebody like Barney Frank says something like that, I start to pay attention. And that, to me, is very concerning\"."

        "title": "BTC is not Bitcoin: Why that matters to the SEC - CoinGeek",
        "content": "SEC Chair Gary Gensler recently reiterated the SEC\u2019s longstanding position that as far as they are concerned, Bitcoin is not a security, while most other digital assets are. Gensler didn\u2019t say that BTC or BCH aren\u2019t securities: he said that Bitcoin is not a security, specifically thanks to the unique circumstances of its creation and issuance.\n\nWhich of course begs the question: what is that original Bitcoin? And where does Gensler\u2019s assessment leave the many forks that have branched off the original since its creation? Most importantly, why does any of this matter, legally or otherwise?\n\nThe term Bitcoin refers to a networking and database protocol described and published under the Satoshi Nakamoto pseudonym in 2008. The system which adheres to that description is Bitcoin: any system which does not, is not.\n\nAs Gensler acknowledged to NY Mag, Bitcoin is viewed differently from other digital asset networks because of its unique origin story. Satoshi Nakamoto issued all 21 million Bitcoin in January 2009, and specified a fixed algorithmic system that governs the circumstances under which coins are released ie Proof-of-Work mining by nodes. No coins were pre-mined and Satoshi, the issuer, has no input in the release of these coins beyond the initial design of the system. As soon as the entire issuance was complete Satoshi was only as able to get Bitcoin the same way anyone else was: by getting in line and mining.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the protocol underpinning Bitcoin was always designed to be fixed and not subject to revision (\u201cThe nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime,\u201d wrote Satoshi Nakamoto in June 2010).\n\nThese circumstances matter because of how securities are defined: whether or not a digital asset offering amounts to a security is governed by the Howey test. Under Howey, an offering will be a security if:\n\nThere is an investment of money\n\nThe investment is made into a common enterprise\n\nThe investment is made with the reasonable expectation of profits\n\nThat expectation of profits is reliant on the efforts of others\n\nThe lack of any pre-mine by Satoshi is important, because the courts have interpreted pre-mining as a signal to investors that the issuer \u2018is motivated to work tirelessly to improve the value of its blockchain\u2019 for itself and purchasers (see SEC v LBRY). In other words, it is taken as a sign that investment was made with a reasonable expectation of profits reliant on the efforts of the issuer. The algorithmic process governing the release of coins without input from the original issue matters because under those circumstances, it can\u2019t be said that there is any common enterprise capable of investment: the nodes of the network are acting competitively.\n\nThat the protocol is fixed also matters: constant revisions to the protocol require centralized control that is exercised by some defined group. Absent centralization of that kind, it\u2019s very difficult to argue that any sort of investment in Bitcoin was done with the expectation of profits reliant on the efforts of others. Add that control in, and not only is a given asset offering highly likely to amount to a security, but the developers are also likely to be acting as fiduciaries toward those using their blockchains: see recent commentary from the U.K. Court of Appeal in Tulip Trading v Van der Laan and Ors or Angela Walch\u2019s much-cited paper, \u201cIn Code(rs) We Trust: Software Developers as Fiduciaries in Public Blockchains\u201d.\n\nSo, when Gensler says that Bitcoin is not a security or refers to its unique history, this is what he is referring to. This was the legal character of Bitcoin as it existed in 2009 and continues to exist in 2023 as Bitcoin SV.\n\nWhere does that leave BTC, BCH and similar knock-offs?\n\nThe term Bitcoin can only refer to a system that adheres to the white paper. Any deviation from the protocol described by Satoshi Nakamoto in that document is no longer Bitcoin, because the original Bitcoin protocol was designed to be fixed and not subject to revision. The fixed nature of the protocol is a key pillar in Bitcoin\u2019s ability to serve as peer to peer electronic cash and its ability to serve the needs of businesses: a protocol that is fixed can be embraced and relied upon by businesses and builders indefinitely, without the threat of regular changes to the fundamental protocol threatening to break all that relies on it. To illustrate, consider the TCP/IP protocol governing the internet: that protocol has remained fixed since inception, which has enabled the development and flourishing of the application level above it. If the underlying TCP/IP protocol were subject to constant revision, then the applications build atop it would need to be modified or even discarded each time. If that were the case, the world would not have been able to rely on, for example, email as the indispensable communications platform that it has remained for decades. The same can be said for Bitcoin: a fixed and unchanging underlying protocol is required if Bitcoin and all of its capabilities are to be relied on in business and everyday life.\n\nDespite all this, Satoshi\u2019s decision to hand off development to others in 2010 has led to attempts to change the underlying protocol of Bitcoin. This occurred despite the fact that Nakamoto remains the steward of the protocol and the issuer of all Bitcoin in existence. These changes have resulted in a number of \u2018forks\u2019 away from the original protocol, and though such forks have attempted to retain (illegally, it turns out) the Bitcoin name, they are not Bitcoin.\n\nChief among these offshoots is BTC, or Bitcoin Core. This offshoot was created by the core of developers who seized control of Bitcoin following Satoshi\u2019s exit and implemented a number of centrally-planned changes to the protocol which break from the Bitcoin defined in the white paper.\n\nThe most radical of these early changes was the SegWit update in 2017, which took the extraordinary step of removing digital signatures from Bitcoin transactions and putting them in a separate data structure in order to (ostensibly) help Bitcoin scale alongside an ever-growing number of transactions without increasing the cap on block size. In reality, this didn\u2019t help scaling at all (the so-called \u2018problem\u2019 of scaling is little more than a myth, as demonstrated by the original vision for Bitcoin which scales perfectly without any hard cap on block size) and only served the developers in charge, as it pushed users of the network off-chain and towards Lightning Network, a second-layer commercial solution owned by those very same devs.\n\nThe change was a radical departure from Bitcoin: the white paper makes clear both that signatures are an inextricable part of the system and that Bitcoin was always meant to scale on-chain via a fixed protocol. To move data off-chain in an effort to scale is to somewhat defeat the purpose of Bitcoin, which is to create a system of secure peer to peer electronic cash that is public. Moving that data onto a layer 2 network is a solution to a problem entirely of the devs own making (the imposition of an arbitrary block size) with the added benefit (to some) of obscuring the authors of transactions made with Bitcoin.\n\nEach significant departure from that protocol has two related effects: the chain \u2018forks\u2019 so that newly changed protocol splits from the original Bitcoin protocol, and there is created a new coin issuance based on the new protocol whereby the new coins are \u2018airdropped\u2019 to holders of the original. So, for example, when the SegWit update created a fork and split off from Bitcoin, every Bitcoin holder was airdropped the new, covertly issued BTC coin. Attorney and tech commentator Zeming Gao put it best in his recent article, \u201cEven BTC is a security according to the Howey test\u201d:\n\n\u201cEvery time when the actual underlying blockchain changes the base protocol that not only affects transactions but also affects the automated unilateral contract originally offered by Satoshi, the coin is no longer the original coin. From that point on, any coin that continues on the changed blockchain is materially a new coin offered under a new contract. Further, the continuous issuance of new tokens to miners is also under a new mining contract different from the original unilateral contract offered to miners by Satoshi. This makes the reissued tokens and new tokens both a security, collectively or separately, even though the original bitcoin was a nonsecurity. It does not matter what name or ticker it carries, nor what the market price it receives. This is because the market is not the factfinder for this matter; it simply votes according to whatever information it was fed, and in this case they were fed deceptive information.\u201d\n\nThe most important implication here is that just as these changes fork away from the original definition of Bitcoin, so to do they fork away from the original, SEC-compliant issuance. In other words, none of the factors which ensured that Bitcoin is not a security apply to the forks. The consequence is that these subsequent issuances amount to illegal, unregistered securities offerings. Which means that at any point, these systems are liable to be hit with an SEC enforcement action the likes of which killed LBRY and XRP.\n\nThere\u2019s another giant reason this should matter to anyone holding one of these forks: the taxman. BSV is the continuation of the original protocol, but the likes of BCH and BTC are forks. Each time a chain undergoes a hard fork in response to some network change, the forked coin is airdropped to all of the holders of the original. This airdrop is considered income by the IRS and is therefore taxable as such. This position was confirmed explicitly by the IRS in 2014 via Notice 2014-21. Which means holders of Bitcoin at the time it was forked into BTC (August 2017) and BCH (November 2018) owe income tax on the airdropped coins entailed by the fork:\n\n\u201cA hard fork occurs when a cryptocurrency undergoes a protocol change resulting in a permanent diversion from the legacy distributed ledger. This may result in the creation of a new cryptocurrency on a new distributed ledger in addition to the legacy cryptocurrency on the legacy distributed ledger. If your cryptocurrency went through a hard fork, but you did not receive any new cryptocurrency, whether through an airdrop (a distribution of cryptocurrency to multiple taxpayers\u2019 distributed ledger addresses) or some other kind of transfer, you don\u2019t have taxable income.\u201d\n\nEven ignoring the concerns of the SEC and IRS, those responsible for these drastic departures from the Bitcoin protocol and the continued misuse of the Bitcoin name are discovering that their actions have profound legal consequences. A number of individuals and entities who have been using the Bitcoin name to market these unrelated products have been hit with passing off claims in the U.K. potentially worth billions: those being sued include the individual developers of BTC but also those members of the broader ecosystem who enable the misuse of the Bitcoin name: companies like Coinbase and Kraken, who continually promote BTC as Bitcoin despite the fact that BTC bears little to no resemblance to the system described in the white paper. The developers are also discovering that their exercise of centralized control over their knock-off protocols have enormous legal consequences: they may well be proven to owe fiduciary duties to those who use their networks which would compel them to, among other things, return access to stolen digital assets to their rightful owners.\n\nIt must have seemed no big deal to hijack the original Bitcoin and transform it into something else entirely, but as Gensler and the deluge of lawsuits these hijackers are now facing demonstrate, such actions have severe legal consequences.\n\nWatch: The Future World with Blockchain\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "title": "Analyst: This is what can be expected from Bitcoin price before the next halving in April 2023 - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price has historically breached the macro downtrend between 365 to 397 days before a halving.\n\nThe next Bitcoin halving is scheduled for April 2023, which stands to be within the expected range of the breakout.\n\nOn the micro-scale, BTC is performing exceptionally, reinforcing Bitcoin season.\n\nBitcoin is still the flagbearer of the crypto industry, and a lot is expected out of the biggest cryptocurrency in the world. While BTC has not been able to deliver per the expectation for a while now, things might be changing soon if this setup plays out.\n\nBitcoin in the macro timeframe\n\nBitcoin price dropped from its all-time high of $67,500 in 2022 to trade at $27,000 at the time of writing. Many analyses tried to pin this drawdown on macroeconomic events as well as internal crypto company failures. However, per crypto analyst and trader Rekt Capital, these events actually structured the repeat of a pattern.\n\nSince the halving of 2016, Bitcoin price has been following this pattern which has played out successfully twice in a row now. According to Rekt Capital, BTC moved to form lows per a macro downtrend which the biggest cryptocurrency in the world broke out of close to a year before the halving.\n\nIn 2015 this happened 366 days before the halving, and a similar occurrence took place in 2019 395 days before the halving. Should this setup play out again, Bitcoin would successfully repeat this pattern for the third time as the next halving of April 2023 stands only 397 days away.\n\nBitcoin breakout before halving\n\nIf the monthly candlestick close of Bitcoin is above the downtrend line, the macro downtrend would be invalidated. Breaking out of the same would potentially support a price rise in the long run. This is because the breakout before the previous halving noted BTC increasing by more than 183%. Although a similar rise cannot be expected this time around, the crypto asset would at least keep above $25,000.\n\nBitcoin season once again\n\nBitcoin price on the micro-scale has been performing pretty well, considering the nearly 35% rise observed by the cryptocurrency in the last seven days. Trading at $27,700, BTC rose from almost falling below $19,000.\n\nBut the rise in Bitcoin price was not met with similar enthusiasm in the case of altcoins, as only some of them managed to mark significant rises. Most of the top 50 altcoins over the last 90 days had lesser increases than BTC.\n\nBitcoin season\n\nConsequently, the market regressed to the Bitcoin season. For the altcoin season to arrive again, 75% of the top 50 altcoins must perform better than Bitcoin, which seems far away for now."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin Miner Stocks Soared This Week - Nasdaq",
        "content": "What happened\n\nCryptocurrencies soared this week. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) led the way, with a 22.2% price gain from the stock market's closing bell last Friday to the same time this Thursday.\n\nOver the same period, that price surge powered an even stronger updraft under the stocks of leading Bitcoin mining specialists:\n\nSo what\n\nBitcoin and friends saw a couple of distinct jumps in the last week.\n\nFirst, several banks with close ties to the crypto sector were shut down by Californian regulators late last week; this was followed by a federal promise to allow customers to access any funds they had deposited in the failing banks. The Federal Reserve's guarantee of billions of dollars that help power the trading systems behind Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies resulted in a price surge over the weekend.\n\nThen, traders put their thinking caps on and started pondering what the bank closures might mean for the American economy at large. By Tuesday morning, many investors agreed that the Federal Reserve's inflation-fighting interest rate hikes had gone too far. Therefore, what at first looked like a threat to the entire crypto market should actually inspire the central bank to lighten up its anti-inflation measures, and let banks breathe more freely with lower interest rates on federal funds. That's seen as a positive development for Bitcoin, ahead of next week's scheduled rate-setting conference.\n\nAnd as Bitcoin goes, so do the miners -- though their stock-price moves tend to amplify whatever the cryptocurrency's chart is doing. These miners are not just holding a bunch of Bitcoin on their balance sheets; they also strive to make and buy more of the digital currency over time. This strategy adds to their value when Bitcoin prices are rising, but also increases the risk involved in running their businesses.\n\nBitcoin mining rigs are not cheap, and they draw an incredible amount of electric power. Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA), Hut 8 Mining (NASDAQ: HUT), and Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT) run their business operations with bottom-line margins deep in red-ink territory, keeping the lights on by taking on debt and selling more stock on the open market.\n\nSo these companies rely on Bitcoin gaining value in the long run, while also building out their crypto-mining rigs as fast as they dare. But a few management missteps or a too-harsh crypto winter could puncture the whole business model, leaving shareholders penniless.\n\nThat combination of long-term financial gains above and beyond Bitcoin's price development, plus the constant threat of financial collapse, adds up to massive volatility. So the miners outperformed Bitcoin in this week's surge, and they're doing great in 2023 overall. Bitcoin's price is up 51% year to date, while all three of the miners above more than doubled in value.\n\nNow what\n\nThe pricing trends play out on longer time scales, too. For example, Bitcoin is down by 36% in 52 weeks, but the Bitcoin miners have taken haircuts ranging from 57% to 69% over the same span. On a chart of the last year, the deep price drops and giant leaps of recent weeks are just another little divot in the larger trend line:\n\nIt's always fun to see your stocks and cryptocurrencies do well, but you also need to keep those inflated risks in mind. It may sound strange, but buying Bitcoin directly is a much safer and more conservative option than investing in any of the miner stocks.

        "content": "Crypto investors should know by now that it doesn\u2019t take much to topple a distressed multi-billion-dollar firm. On March 10, California regulators officially shut down Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) 48 hours after the company disclosed it was in financial distress. As Cointelegraph reported at the time, SVB is the first Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured bank to fail in 2023. That crucial detail prompted federal regulators in the United States to step up and backstop SVB depositors before a bank run could ensue. Although government protections weren\u2019t enough to stem a massive drop in bank stocks once markets reopened on Monday, Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market soared. Did FDIC bail out Bitcoin? Only time will tell.\n\nThe SVB fiasco triggered a short but intense period of fear and trepidation in crypto markets as Circle\u2019s USD Coin (USDC) depegged. The only thing Circle did wrong was holding a portion of its deposits at SVB when it collapsed.\n\nThis week\u2019s Crypto Biz tries to make sense of SVB\u2019s failure and how it affected crypto markets.\n\nSilicon Valley Bank shut down by California regulator\n\nOn March 10, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation shut down Silicon Valley Bank and appointed FDIC as the receiver to protect insured deposits. The news triggered a fire sale in crypto and financial markets as SVB was a top-20 U.S. bank by total assets. So, what compelled regulators to close the bank? Earlier in the week, SVB released its mid-quarter financial update, which disclosed a $1.8 billion loss tied to securities sales and the need to raise $2.25 billion to shore up operations. SVB was a trusted partner of many crypto-focused venture capital firms, but its demise was ultimately tied to duration risk, not crypto industry exposure. Washington put out the SVB fire quickly by announcing that all depositors, and not just accounts worth up to $250,000, would be protected. President Joe Biden later confirmed that shoring up depositors would not cost the taxpayer anything.\n\nCustomers lining up outside of Silicon Valley Bank at its Menlo Park, CA branch. pic.twitter.com/SDNrSUC1C0 \u2014 Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) March 10, 2023\n\nCircle \u2018able to access\u2019 $3.3B of USDC reserves at Silicon Valley Bank, CEO says\n\nOne of the companies caught in the crosshairs of SVB was stablecoin issuer Circle, which had $3.3 billion in reserves tied up at the failed bank. USDC lost stablecoin market share \u2014 and its peg to the U.S. dollar \u2014 once SVB collapsed because it wasn\u2019t clear if and when Circle could access its funds. At its lowest point, USDC fell to around $0.87. The stablecoin has since returned to par with the dollar, with Circle confirming it could access reserves held at SVB. Circle lost significant market share over the past week due to ongoing USDC redemptions. USDC\u2019s market cap currently stands at $38.4 billion, less than half of rival Tether, whose USDT is valued at nearly $73.6 billion.\n\nBreaking: Signature Bank closed by New York regulators, citing \u2018systemic risk\u2019\n\nSVB wasn\u2019t the only crypto-friendly bank collapse this week. On March 12, the Manhattan-based Signature Bank was officially shuttered by the New York Department of Financial Services, allegedly to protect the U.S. economy and strengthen the public\u2019s confidence in the banking system. \u201cThe actions that we took today were designed to limit the consequences of the depositor outflows from Silicon Valley and from Signature and to reduce any spillover effects,\u201d a Treasury official reportedly said. Like SVB depositors, all accountholders at Signature will be made whole without affecting taxpayers. Signature Bank had nearly $89 billion in deposits as of Dec. 31, 2022.\n\n@federalreserve @USTreasury @FDICgov issue statement on actions to protect the U.S. economy by strengthening public confidence in our banking system, ensuring depositors' savings remain safe: https://t.co/YISeTdFPrO \u2014 Federal Reserve (@federalreserve) March 12, 2023\n\nSouth Korea launches \u2018Metaverse Fund\u2019 to expedite domestic initiatives\n\n\u201cMetaverse\u201d is still a vague and underdeveloped concept, but South Korea is taking it very seriously. Seoul\u2019s Ministry of Science and ICT announced it would allocate 24 billion won ($18.1 million) toward metaverse development as part of a bigger pot worth 40 billion won ($30.2 million). The newly launched Metaverse Fund is said to support mergers and acquisitions of various metaverse-related companies \u2014 a move that could give the country an upper hand in the still-evolving sector. The metaverse arms race continues. As Cointelegraph reported earlier this month, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta won court approval to continue its metaverse acquisition plans.\n\nCrypto Biz is your weekly pulse of the business behind blockchain and crypto, delivered directly to your inbox every Thursday."

To illustrate, Bitcoin crashed from as high as $69,000 registered in November 2021, dropping below $20,000 in November 2022.\n\nThe crypto meltdown was made worse by the collapse of UST, an algorithmic stablecoin by Terra, the crash of several centralized finance projects like Voyager Digital and BlockFi, and the spectacular fall of FTX, the Sam Bankman-Fried exchange in November.\n\nThe bankruptcy and failure of some of these platforms dented user confidence, forcing a capital flight to safe havens beyond the crypto markets to gold and the USD.\n\nAt some point in 2022, for example, DXY data, an index that tracks the USD, showed that the greenback strengthened by over 20%.\n\nDuring that time, BTC more than halved, demonstrating the relationship between the USD and Bitcoin.\n\nThe DXY measures the strength of the USD against a basket of other currencies, including the Japanese Yen, Euro, Chinese Yuan, and others. The index will rise if the USD is strong and dip if it falls relative to these currencies.\n\nThe Tide Is Changing\n\nAs of mid-March 2023, Kaiko observes that rallying Bitcoin and crypto prices seems to coincide with the relative strengthening of the USD; and is shifting. When BTC prices rose from $19,700 last week to $26,300, the USD added 3% from late February 2023. The USD holds firm despite questions being raised concerning the monetary policy approach adopted by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThere have been more questions about the effectiveness and the speed of rate hikes in the past few months. Although inflation is lower, it is not at ideal levels.\n\nThe Fed aims to eventually reduce inflation to around the 2% benchmark level. While critics descend on the Fed, the USD is steady, syncing with Bitcoin, that\u2019s relatively higher.\n\nFeature Image From Canva, Chart From TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "How to Create a Bitcoin Ordinal - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Ordinals are akin to Bitcoin NFTs. In this guide, we\u2019ll show you how to inscribe one to the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nOver the last few months, Ordinals (Bitcoin NFTs) have gone from a niche interest among a small group of Bitcoiners to a fast-growing technology that\u2019s captured the attention of collectors, traders, developers, and creators across crypto ecosystems. Usage has hockey-sticked during winter 2022-2023, culminating in Yuga Labs\u2019 March 2023 \u201cTwelvefold\u201d Ordinals auction that netted 735 BTC ($16.5 million at the time of auction). That event included participation from top ETH collectors, many of whom are spinning up full Bitcoin nodes for the first time in their lives.\n\nWhether Ordinals mature into a small, differentiated corner of the NFT world, or a deca-billion-dollar asset class sparking a new renaissance in Bitcoin development and adoption, remains to be seen \u2014 but Ordinals are here to stay.\n\nWhat Are Ordinals?\n\nThe quick answer is that Ordinals are Bitcoin NFTs. The longer answer is that when people commonly refer to Ordinals, they are actually referring to a unique combination of the following:\n\nAn inscription : Fully on-chain data (e.g., an image or text) plus associated metadata shoved into Bitcoin blocks through \u201cinscribing.\u201d\n\nAn ordinal : A single satoshi (the smallest unit of Bitcoin), which is unique and non-fungible, enabled by a novel convention called Ordinal Theory , implemented in a piece of open-source software called Ord (released by creator Casey Rodarmor in December 2022).\n\nAn \u201cOrdinal,\u201d or Bitcoin NFT, is created at the end of a process that starts with putting data on-chain (inscription) and ends with mapping the data to a non-fungible satoshi using Ordinal Theory.\n\nThe main difference between Ordinals and NFTs on other chains is that content data (inscriptions) on Ordinals are always stored on Bitcoin; NFTs on other chains are mostly pointers to actual data that live off-chain (e.g., on Arweave, IPFS). The main similarity is that both are viewable, collectable, tradeable, and creatable. This guide will specifically explore how to create them.\n\nWhile anyone can create an Ordinal on their own, the process is onerous for casual users because it requires the following:\n\nDownloading and syncing a full node\n\nDownloading the ord wallet\n\nExecuting commands via command line\n\nInstead, we\u2019ll focus on how to inscribe Ordinals quickly using existing services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Get an Ordinals-Compatible Wallet (Or Two)\n\nPopular Ordinals-compatible wallets include graphical user interface (GUI) wallets like Sparrow (instructions here) or web wallets like Unisat, Oyl, or Xverse (requires STX). For this guide, we\u2019ll assume you\u2019re using Sparrow.\n\nTip: Think twice before using a custodial wallet where you have to trust a third party with your keys. As Bitcoiners say: not your keys, not your coins.\n\nStep 2: Get Some BTC\n\nYou\u2019ll need BTC to pay fees to the inscription service you use. You can pay the fee from any wallet with BTC in it. Inscription costs vary based on fee markets and data size, but for a typical JPG (and if you\u2019re not in a rush), budgeting around $50 per inscription should be more than enough.\n\nTip: To be safe, don\u2019t send the BTC to an address where you plan to receive your Ordinal. Maintaining a separate address will prevent you from accidentally sending your Ordinal out. For instance, in this example, it\u2019s OK to pay the inscription fee from any Bitcoin wallet (e.g., Ledger Live, Blue Wallet, Coinbase), but you should make sure to receive the inscription only to the receiving address generated in Sparrow.\n\nStep 3: Pick an Inscription Service\n\nInscription services are run by third parties and enable you to inscribe and receive your Ordinal via a friendly-to-use interface (for a fee). Popular inscription services as of this writing include:\n\nThe next steps assume you\u2019re using Ordinalsbot to inscribe, but other inscription services work similarly.\n\nStep 4: Upload Your Content\n\nChoose which file type you want to inscribe and drag and drop your desired data \u2014 such as an image, video, or music \u2014 into the upload box.\n\nStep 5: Input the Receive Address for Your Ordinal\n\nIn the \u201cReceive BTC Address\u201d field on the inscription site, input the receive address you want the Ordinal sent to.\n\nIn a correctly configured Sparrow wallet, click \u201cGet Next Address\u201d to generate a new receive address for the Ordinal you are inscribing. Make sure to use a fresh address for each Ordinal. Do not send multiple Ordinals to the same address. Label the address with something you\u2019ll recognize as belonging to the inscription you\u2019re about to do.\n\nImportant: Outside of Ordinals-native wallets, do not send or receive Ordinals in your normal Bitcoin wallet or exchange account. Your Ordinals may be lost forever if you do this. Until wallets explicitly supporting Ordinals launch, the safest way to receive Ordinals is via your correctly configured Sparrow (GUI) or Ord (command line) wallet.\n\nStep 6: Pay Fees\n\nYou\u2019ll need to pay a network fee (to Bitcoin miners) and a service fee (to the inscription service). If the service allows you to set a custom fee, like Ordinalsbot does, input your desired fee; higher is generally faster and lower is slower.\n\nTip: If you go too low on the network fee, your inscription might take a long time or not be included at all.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve selected the network fee, pay the invoice by scanning the QR code or copying the receive address into the wallet you\u2019re sending BTC from. Make sure to pay the correct amount.\n\nStep 7: Wait for the Inscription to Complete\n\nOn Ordinalsbot, you can check the status of your inscription by looking up your order ID:\n\nStep 8: Confirm Receipt of Your Ordinal\n\nDepending on network congestion, your fee payment, and the inscription service, your new, shiny Ordinal should show up at some point at the receive address you inputted in Step 5. Here\u2019s what that looks like in Sparrow:\n\nStep 9: Validate and Look Up Your Ordinal/Inscription\n\nTo look up your Ordinal / inscription, copy the transaction output associated with the Ordinal you just received:\n\nPaste it into the search bar at Ordinals.com or another Ordinals-compatible explorer:\n\nStep 10: You\u2019re Done\n\nCongratulations on inscribing your Ordinal!\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nHere are some links to get started:"

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin posted impressive gains of over 6% in the past 24 hours, reaching a high of $26,350 on Friday morning, per data from CoinGecko.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price surge came alongside a wider uplift in the cryptocurrency market, which saw the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies rise over 4% in the past day, to $1.17 trillion. It follows a rise in U.S. and Asian stock markets after major lenders in J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and others agreed to inject $30 billion to save U.S.-based First Republic Bank from insolvency, promoting risk-on sentiments.\n\nEarlier this week, U.S. inflation data for February came along the lines of market expectations, showing signs of slowing down. The CME FedWatch tool shows that traders have put an 84.1% chance that the Fed will raise rates by 25 bps, while the rest predict that Fed could also maintain the current rate.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe dollar's yield is declining as the Fed potentially moves away from quantitative tightening, prompting renewed interest in risk-on assets like stocks and crypto from investors.\n\nEntering a regime of \u201cQE light\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, the European Central Bank also raised its benchmark interest rate by 50 base points (bps), putting further pressure on DXY with a relatively higher-yielding euro than the dollar.\n\n\"Bitcoin is reacting to the increase in the Fed's balance sheet and the form of \"quantitative easing (QE) light\" taken in response to Silicon Valley Bank,\" Nathan Batchelor, managing partner at Biyond Trader, told Decrypt. He added that, \"Technically Bitcoin is wildly bullish above $25,000 and looks to be targeting $28,000 at a minimum.\"\n\nAnother factor influencing Bitcoin's price is the risk of a global banking crisis. Banks worldwide in Europe and the U.S. are facing a potential insolvency crisis. While the state governments and other larger institutions like J.P. Morgan have backstopped the fallout for now, uncertainty around a banking failure is helping to build positive sentiment around decentralized alternatives such as Bitcoin."

        "title": "Ordinal Punks: All You Need to Know About the Bitcoin NFT Collection - NFTevening.com",
        "content": "In recent times, the world has witnessed a surge in the popularity of NFTs and the new possibilities they bring. While Ethereum has traditionally been the go-to platform for NFTs, the rise of Bitcoin NFTs has created a buzz in the NFT and crypto community. One unique digital collection created using the Bitcoin blockchain is the Ordinal Punks. The collection comprises 100 unique profile pictures (PFPs) that are minted within the first 650 inscriptions and fully on-chain on the Bitcoin blockchain. While they have become highly sought-after digital assets in the NFT space, there is some debate as to whether Ordinal Punks are true NFTs or not.\n\nIn this guide, we will explain everything you might want to know about Ordinal Punks, Bitcoin NFTs, and the controversy surrounding the collection.\n\nWhat are Bitcoin NFTs?\n\nFirstly, let\u2019s take a look at what Bitcoin NFTs actually are. In essence, Bitcoin NFTs are unique digital assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. Like other blockchain networks, the Bitcoin blockchain is a secure and decentralized network that records transactions. Casey Rodarmor, a software engineer, added the Ordinals protocol to the Bitcoin blockchain. Markedly, this protocol allows users and developers to add Ordinals to each of the 100,000,000 units that make up one Bitcoin. \u2018Sats\u2019 or \u2018satoshis\u2019 is the common term for these units. Moreover, this data can include smart contracts, which enable the creation of NFTs on the blockchain. Essentially, the Ordinals protocol provides a way for creators to build NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nWhat are Ordinal Punks NFTs?\n\nBasically, Ordinal Punks are a collection of Bitcoin NFTs. Notably, this collection pays tribute to CryptoPunks, an NFT collection on the Ethereum blockchain. Each Ordinal Punk NFT is a one-of-a-kind digital artwork. The collection comprises 100 unique PFPs (profile pictures) that are minted within the first 650 inscriptions and fully on-chain on the Bitcoin blockchain. But, what exactly is an inscription? Essentially, inscriptions are digital artifacts, like an image or text, created on the protocol.\n\nHow Were Ordinal Punks Created?\n\nOrdinal Punks are a unique digital collection created using the Ordinals protocol. The collection is made within the first 650 inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain and was createed by the pseudonymous Web3 creator FlowStay. Additionally, each NFT is generated through an algorithmic process. This process uses a series of factors and results in a unique combination of colors, shapes, and patterns. Furthermore, the use of Bitcoin Ordinals provides each NFT with a permanent, verifiable identity on the Bitcoin blockchain, making it easily traceable and authenticated. Bitcoin\u2019s Segregated Witness, commonly known as SegWit, and Taproot upgrade made it possible to store NFT data on-chain. Significantly, this allows unlimited transaction sizes. To buy, sell, or trade an Ordinal Punk, users need to run a full node on the Bitcoin blockchain. This means that in order to do this, you\u2019d need to be crypto-savvy!\n\nHow Much are Ordinal Punks Worth?\n\nOrdinal Punks NFTs have become highly sought-after digital assets in the NFT space. They are priced roughly around $100,000, but one NFT, Punk 94, sold for a huge $214,000 or 9.5 BTC. Surprisingly, one NFT collector traded an original CryptoPunk for an Ordinal Punk, causing a stir in the NFT space. As CryptoPunks are often referred to as the first project in NFT history, many questioned whether the swap was a wise decision, even though the value of both projects was roughly the same at the time of the swap.\n\nHow are Ordinal Punks Valued?\n\nOrdinal Punks are valued based on various factors such as their rarity, uniqueness, historical significance, and demand from collectors. The market determines the price of an Ordinal Punk NFT, with some selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Additionally, the fact that Ordinal Punks are created using Bitcoin blockchain technology and have a permanent, verifiable identity also adds to their value. The value of an Ordinal Punk will likely fluctuate over time, based on market demand and other factors.\n\nSo, are Ordinal Punks NFTs or Not?\n\nCasey Rodarmor, the creator of Ordinals, said this in a blog post. \u201cInscriptions are digital artifacts, and digital artifacts are NFTs, but not all NFTs are digital artifacts. Digital artifacts are NFTs held to a higher standard, closer to their ideal.\u201d\n\nNFT enthusiasts, however, have a different opinion. Some argue that Ordinal Punks are not true NFTs because they lack programmability, which limits their potential uses. Trading the collection is also complex. Due to Bitcoin NFTs being still in its early stages, there is no infrastructure or marketplaces available to support it. Instead, users purchase the digital artifacts peer-to-peer over the counter via the Ordinal Punks Discord.\n\nThe Community Reacts\n\nGenerally, the concept of Bitcoin NFTs has caused a stir within the Web3 community. Bitcoin maximalists often reject the idea of using Bitcoin for anything other than financial transactions, such as creating NFTs. They believe that NFTs and other non-financial use cases of Bitcoin are not valuable and distract from Bitcoin\u2019s main purpose as a decentralized currency. However, some members of the Bitcoin community see the emergence of Bitcoin-based NFTs as a positive development. In contrast, they believe Bitcoin NFTs can bring more attention, use cases, and drive further development on the Bitcoin blockchain. The popularity of the Ordinal Protocol and the high prices of Ordinal Punk NFTs have sparked a debate within the Bitcoin community about the value of Bitcoin NFTs and their potential for the future of the blockchain.\n\nThe future of Ordinal Punks\n\nIt is difficult to predict the exact future of the NFT collection. This is because it is dependent on various factors, including the overall demand for NFTs and the adoption of the Ordinal Protocol. However, some enthusiasts believe that Ordinal Punks could become highly valuable digital assets. This is due to their scarcity and unique identity on the Bitcoin blockchain. Additionally, as more people become interested in NFTs and the underlying blockchain technology, it is possible that the demand for Ordinal Punks will increase. Overall, the future of the project will likely be shaped by the ongoing evolution of the NFT space and the broader adoption of blockchain technology."

        "title": "This Bitcoin Wyckoff Schematic Says Massive Price Mark Up Comes Next - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Bitcoin price is trading at resistance currently, and it could be the last stop before massive price mark up, according to a Wyckoff accumulation schematic\n\nTake a look at the shocking comparison to the schematic below and learn more about the mechanics behind \u201cWyckoff logic.\u201d Plus, find out what might happen next if the schematic is accurate.\n\nBitcoin Price Action Mimics 9 Months Of Wyckoff Accumulation\n\nThe top cryptocurrency by market cap went from being pronounced dead following the FTX collapse, to suddenly showing signs of coming back to life.\n\nBitcoin price is up more than 60% from 2022 lows and around 50% year-to-date. It has outperformed the stock market, gold, and just about every other asset class in 2023.\n\nThe price increase might only be the beginning according to a Wyckoff accumulation schematic, which closely mimics the price action in Bitcoin since June of last year.\n\nA nearly 50% plunge per coin in June 2022 brought BTC to a potential \u201cselling climax.\u201d The support level held for some time, but ultimately was swept in what is referred to in Wyckoff theory as a \u201cspring.\u201d\n\nAfter the spring, the asset being accumulated should rise to resistance, and BTCUSD is doing just that. What happens next will confirm or invalidate the conditions of the schematic.\n\nIs Bitcoin about to jump the creek? | BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nWhat Happens After Crypto \u201cJumps The Creek?\u201d\n\nIf Bitcoin price continues to follow the schematic, what comes next? According to Wyckoff theory, there are four phases in a market cycle: accumulation, mark up, distribution, and mark down.\n\nMark up comes after an extended accumulation phase, which could lead to BTCUSD increasing dramatically over a short period of time. But it has to \u201cjump the creek\u201d first after pushing through the current resistance level.\n\nWyckoff logic focuses on what \u201cthe Composite man\u201d is doing behind the scenes. The Composite man is a representation of smart money and whales who control the underlying dynamics driving market uptrends and downtrends.\n\nThe Composite man is especially deft at cloaking their movements and taking advantage of extremes in supply or demand. For example, smart money carefully accumulates assets at the lowest prices and distributes them on the market at the highest profits.\n\nBitcoin price will have spent nine full months in accumulation, if mark up follows. Considering the length of time that BTC has been in an accumulation phase, the mark up phase that follows could be massive. The last time BTCUSD spent this long in an accumulation range, was 2015. Bitcoin rallied from $160 per coin, to $20,000 when it was all said and done. The cryptocurrency became a household name.\n\nThis time around, Bitcoin\u2019s current low was $16,000. A similar move would take the top cryptocurrency by market cap to nearly $200,000 per BTC. Such results aren\u2019t likely again due to the law of diminishing returns, but a sizable move is possible nonetheless.\n\nAccording to this Wyckoff schematic, #Bitcoin is about ready to \"jump the creek\" after nearly nine months of accumulation. $BTCUSD pic.twitter.com/sR0mSWoums \u2014 Tony \"The Bull\" (@tonythebullBTC) March 16, 2023\n\nFollow @TonyTheBullBTC on Twitter or join the TonyTradesBTC Telegram for exclusive daily market insights and technical analysis education.

        "title": "What are Bitcoin Ordinals? Digital Artifacts: Explained - Ledger",
        "content": "What are Bitcoin Ordinals? Digital Artifacts: Explained\n\nBy Linda Orenes-Lerma\n\nRead 6 min Medium\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS: \u2014 Bitcoin Ordinals are not NFTs, but they have some similar qualities. For example, the value of each Ordinal is completely unique.\n\n\n\n\u2014 The information for Ordinals is stored completely on-chain, with some calling them \u201cDigital Artifacts\u201d.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Ordinals are often compared to NFTs, but there are critical differences: Ordinals do not use smart contracts and are not programmable.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals have become a major Web3 contender, spreading excitement, debate, and even some confusion across the crypto-sphere. Ordinals introduce novel options for the Bitcoin network that are not yet fully explored, such as including images and text in transactions.\n\nYou might think that Bitcoin Ordinals sound a lot like NFTs, and you wouldn\u2019t be the first. While they do have some similarities, Ordinals don\u2019t use smart contracts. While blockchain apps on most blockchain networks use smart contracts to implement a wide range of future behaviors, Ordinals work a little differently.\n\nLike an NFT, they can store data, but conversely, they cannot execute any actions using smart contracts. And technically, ordinals aren\u2019t even tokens. So what are they exactly?\n\nWhat Are Bitcoin Ordinals?\n\nBitcoin Ordinals are much like the Bitcoin blockchain\u2019s version of NFTs. Like NFTs, their value is dependent on the information they include rather than as tokens themselves. They may contain an image or some text, or perhaps they are created to act as tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin ordinals are not exactly NFTs, as they are literal pieces of Bitcoin inscribed with rich data instead. To explain, an ordinal is always worth one Satoshi, a 1/100,000,000th of a Bitcoin (the smallest denomination possible). Being such a small fraction of a Bitcoin, a Satoshi isn\u2019t worth much: its true value mainly depends on the contents of its inscription.\n\nThink of an artist creating a piece of art on a dollar bill. While the bill itself is only worth a dollar, the art on it could potentially be priceless. This is essentially what a Bitcoin ordinal is: a Satoshi with its own unique value. But there\u2019s a bit more to it than that. Let\u2019s dive into the history to understand why.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals Protocol: The History of Ordinals\n\nWhile attaching data to Bitcoin has always been possible through technical loopholes, the amount of data you could attach was limited. In 2021, Bitcoin underwent an upgrade named Taproot. The Taproot upgrade brought higher levels of privacy, security, and scalability to the Bitcoin network. But most importantly, it allowed transactions to contain up to 4Mbs of data, opening up the possibility to support images.\n\nUsing this capability, together with his own fascination with the denominations of Bitcoin, Casey Rodarmor launched the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol in January 2023. The new Ordinals protocol made it much easier for Bitcoin node operators to link data with each of these pieces of Bitcoin, thus creating Ordinals.\n\nIn doing so, he opened up a whole new world for Bitcoin users. Bitcoin Ordinals were an instant hit, with their popularity extending into the present. Today, innovators are still building on and around the original protocol, introducing assets such as the BRC-20 token and Bitcoin Stamps.\n\nHow do Bitcoin Ordinals Work? Rarity Explained\n\nThe Ordinals protocol makes use of something that already existed on the Bitcoin network: a sequential order of satoshis. To explain, each Satoshi has an assigned ordinal number between 0 and 2,100,000,000,000,000, based on the time it was mined. This numbering system means some satoshis are rarer than others.\n\nTo clarify, the Bitcoin network operates on a series of frequent events that can lead to rare occurrences, thus the sats mined during these significant periods can be deemed collectible. Sats mined in the first block( by Satoshi Nakamoto himself ) are just one instance of a rare occurrence.\n\nSince ordinals are inscribed directly on sats, they have an in-built rarity system. To learn more about other occurrences that create rare Sats, make sure you check out Rodarmor\u2019s documentation here.\n\nMost Famous Bitcoin Ordinals So Far\n\nTo understand how the Ordinals ecosystem is developing, let\u2019s take a look at a few of the collections that have emerged so far.\n\nTwelveFold By Yuga Labs\n\nBy far the most famous Bitcoin Ordinal collection so far has to be \u2018TwelveFold\u2019 by Yuga Labs. The limited collection features 300 pieces of generative art, combining both 3D graphics and hand-drawn features.\n\nThe idea behind the collection is to \u201cExplore the relationship between time, mathematics, and the blockchain\u201d, according to the Yuga Labs creative director. To explain, 144 blocks of Bitcoin are mined a day, which could also be interpreted as 12\u00d712. Each piece in the Yuga Labs collection is a 12\u00d712 grid, naming the collection \u2018TwelveFold\u2019, referencing that fact.\n\nThe auction spanned for 24 hours, starting on March 6th, 2023. Of the 300-strong collection, 288 ordinals were available to bid on \u2013 and they were popular indeed. This single auction racked up a total of 3,246 bids, with the successful bidders spending between $50,000 to just over $150k for a single piece.\n\nOrdinal Punks\n\nOrdinal Punks are a collection of 100 Bitcoin Ordinals paying tribute to the popular Ethereum NFT collection CryptoPunks. Ordinal Punks are using an open-source algorithm to generate the pfp which is 192\u00d7192 pixels. However, it\u2019s important to note that this collection is not the most easy to buy and sell, as bids and asks are handled on a Google Sheet by the project\u2019s creator, acting as an escrow manager. All transactions are monitored and tracked via Discord.\n\nTaproot Wizards\n\nTaproot Wizards is an Ordinal collection created by independent Web3 developer Udi Wertheimer, and securely stored on the Bitcoin network. Starting from Inscription 652, each wizard in this collection is a unique NFT that has been hand-drawn by Udi himself. This special collection harnesses the immutability of the Bitcoin blockchain to securely store these one-of-a-kind digital artifacts.\n\nAll sales are handled through Taproot Wizards Discord.\n\nOrdinal Loops\n\nOrdinal Loops offering comes in the form of Object 0, an NFT that rotates and has a mathematical torus design. It\u2019s one of seven similar animations and is part of the first series from the Ordinal Loops team. The current narrative chapter, \u201cDo Not Fiat,\u201d features Bitcoin ASCII fighting an army consisting of five main government currencies endlessly.\n\nTimeChain Collectibles\n\nTimechain Collectibles presents the Series 1 Timepieces, a highly limited collection of 21 Ordinals. They depict many different kinds of timepieces, including pocket watches, wristwatches, cyberpunk alarm clocks, and more. The collection launched on January 30th, 2023 and each piece carries its own consecutive Inscription number from 356 to 377. Inscription 364 sold for an impressive 3.08 BTC/43.59 ETH ($67000) in Jan 2023, showing how desirable these collectibles are! You can find TimeChain Collectibles auctions via the project\u2019s Discord.\n\nNodeMonkes\n\nNodeMonkes is the first collection of 10k inscriptions using the ordinals protocol. Featuring pixel art of web3\u2019s favorite animal, NodeMonkes is currently one of the most popular Ordinals projects. Much like traditional 10k NFT collections, this Bitcoin ordinals project uses a range of traits. Each NodeMonke features a different selection of the available traits, adding to the built-in rarity system offered by sats. This sets it apart from other ordinals, which tend to have smaller collections and less variety in traits.\n\nWhile it originally launched as a free mint, a single NodeMonke will set you back 0.7BTC (at the time of writing). Since its launch in November 2023, the project has been well received, with many buyers believing it\u2019s \u201cup-only\u201d from here. Only time will tell if that\u2019s accurate, but for now, NodeMonkes is a project to watch.\n\nHow to Buy and Sell Bitcoin Ordinals\n\nBitcoin Ordinals are innovative assets only created in 2023, thus there isn\u2019t a huge ecosystem that supports them currently. As such, the first Ordinals traders relied mainly on over-the-counter trades using new and un-battle-tested platforms.\n\nAvoid OTC Trades If You Can\n\nDiscord is popular for brokering over-the-counter (OTC) deals, with the official Ordinals Discord server offering a lot of users their first taste of the asset class. However, since a lot of these trades can be tricky to understand, buying Bitcoin Ordinals this way is not recommended. If you decide to engage in an OTC trade for a Bitcoin ordinal anyway, do so with caution as you could be walking into a trap.\n\nA much safer way of buying and selling ordinals is using a trusted marketplace.\n\nUse Bitcoin Ordinal Marketplaces\n\nCurrently, there aren\u2019t a huge number of choices when it comes to Bitcoin Ordinals marketplaces. However, that\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t any at all. Today, there are a few main places to buy ordinals. And as time goes by, more and more of these platforms support familiar means of connecting your wallet and buying assets.\n\nGenerative.xyz\n\nGenerative.xyz is a marketplace specifically for buying and selling Bitcoin Ordinals. It calls itself the \u201cArt Blocks of Bitcoin Ordinals\u201d, offering a platform primarily for generative art on the Bitcoin network. As the first marketplace of its kind, it has attracted some of the biggest artists in web3 today, including Twin Flames artist and Photographer Justin Aversano.\n\nGenerative.xyz also allows you to inscribe and store ordinals in its platform-specific wallet which is compatible with MetaMask. However, using this combination of wallets comes with a risk: revealing your private keys via your internet connection. That\u2019s because software wallets store private keys on their host device, meaning they are vulnerable to online threats.\n\nMagic Eden\n\nMagic Eden, a popular NFT marketplace, has also launched support for Bitcoin Ordinals. To manage them via Magic Eden, you must set up a wallet specifically for managing these types of assets. Magic Eden currently supports Xverse, Leather (Hiro), Unisat, and OKX. From there, you have access to a trusted platform with a simple interface. Buying a Bitcoin Ordinal using Magic Eden is just as simple as buying an NFT.\n\nWallets for Bitcoin Ordinals\n\nTo manage ordinals, you will need a wallet that supports these types of assets. Thus you need a bitcoin wallet.\n\nAlthough they are Bitcoin assets, you wouldn\u2019t want to mix your main BTC holdings with your Ordinals. This is due to how the Bitcoin network functions. Any time you receive BTC, it\u2019s actually in the form of an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO). While the whole explanation is a little more complicated, think of your UTXOs like unspent change. Each time you spend on the Bitcoin network you pay with an entire UTXO and receive the rest of your balance \u201cback\u201d via another UTXO. Accordingly, that\u2019s also where you\u2019ll find the data for Bitcoin Ordinals; in that pile of unspent change.\n\nDue to this fact, sending Bitcoin from a wallet that holds ordinals will risk sending your Ordinal instead, thus you\u2019ll need to have separate accounts for each asset type. The other thing you\u2019ll need to bear in mind is its Taproot support. To manage ordinals, your wallet must be taproot compatible.\n\nSo, with that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at some of the most popular Bitcoin Ordinals wallets.\n\nLeather (Hiro) Wallet\n\nLeather, formerly known as Hiro, is a software wallet for Bitcoin and alternative assets like Ordinals, BRC-20 tokens, and Stamps. Like all software wallets, Leather comes with the risk of revealing your private keys via your internet connection. Luckily, if you plan to use Leather to manage your ordinals, you can use it in tandem with your Ledger device to keep your assets safe.\n\nPhantom Wallet\n\nPhantom wallet is a cross-chain software wallet that also allows you to secure, manage and interact with bitcoin ordinals. Although it started as a Solana wallet, it now supports countless networks, including the Bitcoin network. Managing Ordinals with Phantom is as easy as any other NFT or alternative asset. It also supports BRC-20 tokens.\n\nAnd of course, you can connect a Ledger Bitcoin account to Phantom to interact with Bitcoin Ordinals securely.\n\nSparrow Wallet\n\nSparrow is a software wallet for Bitcoin, not specifically for Bitcoin ordinals. That means you will need to change the settings specifically to unlock this functionality. If you\u2019re a beginner, you may want to avoid this method and go for something easier. However, you can use sparrow with Ledger devices to keep your assets safe.\n\nHow To Secure Your Ordinals: Use Your Ledger\n\nWhichever wallet you\u2019re using, you should always generate a new address when receiving an ordinal. You can label your separate addresses in most wallets that support them and this will stop you from sending your Ordinal accidentally.\n\nThe other most important piece of advice is: protect your ordinals with a hardware wallet! Using any of the mentioned software wallets that support Bitcoin Ordinals alone will not keep your assets safe. Software wallets cannot keep your keys away from the internet, meaning they are not very secure. To ensure your security, connect your Leather, Sparrow, or Phantom wallet to a Ledger device. That way, you can guarantee your private keys\u2014and thus your assets\u2014are protected from online threats such as malware or spyware.\n\nTo secure your Ordinals using a Ledger device, you will need to follow these steps\n\nMake sure your device is up to date with the latest firmware If you haven\u2019t already, install the Bitcoin app on your Ledger device via Ledger Live Open the app and create a new Bitcoin account, selecting Taproot as its type Your wallet will create a new Bitcoin Taproot account with a new address Now your account is ready to receive Ordinals\n\nOnce you have this account set up you can actually send Ordinals to it directly using the Ord wallet. This might get a little technical but if you understand the risk it entails, follow this tutorial.\n\nAs mentioned, a better option is connecting the new account to one of the previously mentioned wallets that support Bitcoin Ordinals. Once you\u2019ve connected your new account to the software wallet\u2019s interface, you\u2019ll be able to interact with Bitcoin Ordinals easily. And of course, your Ledger device will keep your keys safe at the same time.\n\nHow to Inscribe a Bitcoin Ordinal\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in inscribing your very own ordinal, your first option will have you running a Bitcoin node and syncing it to the Bitcoin blockchain before you even think about touching an ordinal. This process can get pretty technical. But the good news is that there\u2019s a less complicated alternative: using a service instead. Today there are a few easy ways to inscribe ordinals but some of the most popular platforms include:\n\nGamma\n\nGamma is a no-code tool that allows users to inscribe an ordinal in minutes; and without having to download or run a fully synced Bitcoin node. The tool also offers affordable and customizable transaction fees, a great feature for creators. The platform is easy to navigate and use, offering a great option for beginners. However, it\u2019s important to note you will have to pay a service fee on top of the BTC transaction fee.\n\nMagic Eden\n\nMagic Eden launched its Bitcoin Ordinals inscription service in April 2023. From that moment on, any Magic Eden user could easily create Bitcoin Ordinals directly within the platform. You can inscribe images or files onto sats to create unique ordinals. Alternatively, you can create fungible BRC-20 tokens with a fixed supply or even web3 domains. With the marketplace\u2019s previous experience with NFTs, Magic Eden\u2019s inscription tool successfully offers plenty of options paired with an easy-to-use interface.\n\nOrdinals Bot\n\nOrdinals bot is another no-code tool that allows you to inscribe all sorts of Ordinals with ease. You can create inscriptions with images or text. It also offers options for creating BRC-20 tokens\n\nor TAP tokens. You can even easily create Bitcoin domains and .bitmap districts too. Ordinals bot has a huge selection of options for you and also offers them via a simple interface.\n\nThe Future of Bitcoin Ordinals Inscriptions\n\nBitcoin Ordinals gained in popularity quickly, with 100,000 inscriptions in the protocol\u2019s first four days. Since the Bitcoin network is slower and stores all information on-chain, Ordinals could stand to become just as important to web3 as NFTs. Put simply, they are collector\u2019s items on the world\u2019s largest blockchain. As a result, securing them is just as important as our other digital assets.\n\nAs any enthusiast should know, it\u2019s risky to use software wallets and new and untested crypto platforms. To ensure your crypto is safe, your only option is to keep your keys offline and understand transactions before you sign them. This is where Ledger Devices come in. While the ordinal ecosystem is still growing, engaging in it comes with risks. If you decide to do so, make sure to secure your private keys with a hardware wallet, such as that Ledger offers. Ledger Devices offer unparalleled security of your digital assets, and when securing digital artifacts such as Bitcoin Ordinals, it\u2019s imperative to keep your keys safe and offline.\n\nKnowledge is Power."

        "content": "BTC traded momentarily above $26,000 on 14 March.\n\nOn-chain data indicated positive sentiment.\n\nDuring the intraday trading session on 14 March, Bitcoin [BTC] momentarily traded at a staggering high of $26,500 for the first time since August 2022. The rally in price was due to the positive sentiment that lingered in the market as many expect potential US interest rate cuts.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nAfter trading below the $20,000 price mark last weekend following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVIB), BTC regained its momentum and rallied after Federal Regulators confirmed that they would make SVIB depositors whole.\n\nBTC has since clinched important milestones on-chain. Per data from on-chain data provider Santiment, during the trading session on 14 March, BTC whales made the highest count of transactions exceeding $1 million since November 2022.\n\nAn increase in whale transactions is a great indicator of bullish sentiments in the market. If momentum is sustained, further price growth is guaranteed.\n\n? #Bitcoin is continuing its amazing recovery, shooting all the way above $26.5k alongside #bullish #Fed news of potential US interest rate cuts.

Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nFurther, for the first time since SVIB\u2019s collapse, BTC funding rates have turned positive. When an asset\u2019s funding rates are positive, it indicates that the demand to go long (buy) is high. This can be seen as a bullish signal, suggesting that traders are willing to pay a premium to maintain their long positions.\n\nAt press time, BTC\u2019s weighted sentiment was a positive 5.958. If BTC sustains this level, prices could increase further."

        "content": "Without any doubt, Bitcoin has been having an incredible run over the years, paving the way for thousands of altcoins. However, bear cycles and crypto regulations continue to impede these cryptos, causing many to lose trust in the market.\n\nHowever, in today\u2019s article, we\u2019ll discuss Bitcoin\u2019s price prediction as well as five new cryptos that will provide more gains than BTC in 2023. These cryptos include Love Hate Inu, Fight Out, C+Charge, Metropoly, and RobotEra. Have an insightful read.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nBitcoin suffered a price hit, dropping from $26,514 to $19,628. As events unfold, Binance released its $1 billion emergency fund to help provide buying pressure on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, and other tokens.\n\nAs a result, Bitcoin recovered quickly to the upside, gaining over 20% within seven days as it rallied from $19,600 to $24,600, thanks to Binance\u2019s quick response. The coast is now clear for Bitcoin to rally to the $30,000 price, which will provide at least 25% gains to investors.\n\nThe next Bitcoin price level is eagerly anticipated as many investors seek to record more gains in their portfolios. This anticipated price level aligns with an expert prediction on Bitcoin from 2023 to 2030.\n\nYEAR EXPECTED PRICE 2023 $32,000 2024 $50,000 2025 $68,000 2030 $100,000\n\nAltcoins Ready to Provide 50X Gains in the Market\n\nIndeed, Bitcoin is still considered a top crypto in the market. However, here are 5 new altcoins in the market that are catching investors\u2019 attention and can pull more massive gains than Bitcoin.\n\n1. Love Hate Inu (LHINU): A Decentralized Platform Providing Vote-To-Earn Capabilities\n\nLove Hate Inu is the first Vote-To-Earn (V2E) platform that allows users to share their opinions on different issues through voting. When you vote on this issue, you earn crypto rewards. This voting process provides complete anonymity, so you make your statement known without fear.\n\nLove Hate Inu focuses on its enthusiastic community. As it grows in the future, users can create polls and vote on them in its V2E ecosystem. LHINU, its native token, provides users with voting power. So, you must own and stake LHINU to participate in this voting platform.\n\nLove Hate Inu recently began its presale and has attracted global investors. It has raised over $700,000 with a few more stages to go. This crypto is set to become the next Dogecoin and will provide incredible bullish gains when listed in the market.\n\n>>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now<<<\n\n2. Fight Out (FGHT): A Web 3.0 Fitness Platform That Incentivizes Workout Routines\n\nFight Out is a new Move-To-Earn platform that provides intensive and beneficial workout routines and rewards users when they accomplish their goals.

This payment system is built on blockchain technology. Users can use it to pay for charges at designated charging stations while earning carbon credits.\n\nIts native token, CCHG, is used in peer-to-peer payment, which is speedy and cost-effective. CCHG tokens are deflationary as they are removed from circulation once transacted. It thus reduces supply and increases demand for available tokens.\n\nThe presale event is hot on its heels, and investors are keenly interested in this token. It has raised over $2.4 million in capital, and exchange listings are underway in a few weeks, which will provide further price pumps.\n\n>>>Buy C+Charge Now<<<\n\n4. Metropoly (METRO): World\u2019s First Fractional Investment Platform\n\nMetropoly is the world\u2019s first decentralized platform that makes fractional investment in real estate possible. For as little as $100, you can become a property owner and receive rental income for others to use. It reduces the entry barrier, allowing interested users to have a share in the real estate market.\n\nMetropoly utilizes NFTs and blockchain technology to fractionalize real estate assets. Thus, users can go to Metropoly\u2019s NFT marketplace and purchase real estate NFTs using its native token, METRO. You can also buy and manage several NFT assets, earning you more returns on income.\n\nThousands of investors are interested in this real estate platform. Considering its presale event is beneficial, you can scoop a few METRO tokens before it fully launches its product.\n\n>>>Buy Metropoly Now<<<\n\n5. RobotEra (TARO): A Unique Metaverse Crypto with Numerous Play-to-earn Capabilities\n\nRobotEra is a unique metaverse crypto that invites its users to participate in rebuilding and developing a virtual world as far as their imagination takes them.

You also have a chance to participate in its presale, which has raised over $1 million and will provide exponential gains in the market.\n\n>>>Buy RobotEra Now<<<\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin is still a market mover and will continue to dominate despite market setbacks and regulations.

        "title": "Why everyone should read 'The Bitcoin Letters' by Bryan Daugherty - CoinGeek",
        "content": "Instead of arguing on social media, we should spend more time educating people on BSV\u2019s cost benefits, efficiencies and potential for economic development. We hear that cry often, but how many people actually work 24/7 to do it? One person who does is Bryan Daugherty, co-founder and Chairman of Smartledger.\n\nIn what he calls a \u201ctransparent attempt at lobbying,\u201d Daugherty has published \u201cThe Bitcoin Letters.\u201d It explains in detail why scalable Bitcoin is the best way to process and secure the world\u2019s information, as our lives and livelihoods are transformed ever-increasingly by data\u2014and all the implications this brings.\n\nDaugherty has also included the three letters that give the book its title: open letters to Elon Musk, New York Governor Kathy Hochul, and SEC Chair Gary Gensler. The letters not only outline BSV\u2019s case but also seek to clear up confusion about different blockchain networks claiming the \u201cBitcoin\u201d title and various misconceptions about the technology in general.\n\nAs part of his outreach efforts Daugherty has also written to and arranged in-person meetings with elected officials and policymakers, regulators and businesspeople. Many will be curious to know what the response has been. Are there reasons to be optimistic that education can still beat misinformation campaigns? Has knowledge and understanding of blockchain grown since Bitcoin first appeared in 2008, and how have more recent circumstances changed the way it\u2019s perceived?\n\nDaugherty spoke to CoinGeek in the interview below, shedding a lot of useful light on what other BSV proponents should expect away from the social media ring and out in the real world\u2014the place where real decisions get made and real money is spent.\n\nHaving spent large amount of his own personal resources in time, money and effort to spread the word, Daugherty wants others to know what discussions are occurring behind the scenes. Most of it remains unknown and it\u2019s not always what you\u2019d expect.\n\n\u201cThe Bitcoin Letters\u201d is available in paperback and Kindle from Amazon, and in ebook form from ImmutableBooks (who will sell it to you for BSV). An audiobook version is coming soon.\n\nRead the interview below to find out all the whats, whys and hows of Bitcoin lobbying (and BSV itself)\u2014as well as a better understanding of how those outside the industry actually perceive BSV.\n\nInterview with Bryan Daugherty, author of \u201cThe Bitcoin Letters\u201d\n\nWhat made you decide to write the book?\n\nMy intention in writing \u201cThe Bitcoin Letters\u201d was to tackle the misconceptions and misinformation surrounding Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. I aimed to provide clarity and insight into the true nature of Bitcoin and blockchain technology, which includes understanding the various competing versions of the protocol such as BTC, BCH, and BSV.\n\nWith this book, I sought to offer new perspectives that can help policymakers, regulators, and technology innovators gain a better understanding of the true purpose and potential of this groundbreaking technology.\n\nHow and where will it be available?\n\nThe Bitcoin Letters is available in both print and digital versions on Amazon, as well as through Immutable Books. Immutable Books offers a SmartLedger Proof-of-Concept that enables readers to pay for the book per page, chapter, or in its entirety using micro-transactions. This innovative distribution model showcases the potential for blockchain technology to improve existing pay-per-consumption models like that of Amazon. By leveraging the efficiency and security of blockchain, this new model can enhance the reading experience for customers while also benefiting authors and publishers.\n\nYou\u2019ve been pretty busy meeting with elected officials, regulators, and business leaders to talk about the benefits of an efficient, scalable blockchain network. Broadly speaking, what kind of reception did you get?\n\nIn my meetings with elected officials, regulators, and business leaders, I have been pleased to receive an overwhelmingly positive reception. I believe this is partly because many of the perspectives I share on topics related to blockchain are not commonly heard. There has been a heavy focus on the \u201ccrypto casino,\u201d and a significant amount of money has been spent on crypto lobbying, which has had an impact on the perceptions of some people.\n\nAs evidence of this, recent reports show a sharp increase in crypto lobbying expenditure over the last six years. For example, in 2022, Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) spent $3.30 million on lobbying, making it the highest spender in the crypto lobbying expenditure category. This was followed by Blockchain Association with $1.9 million and Robinhood with $1.84 million. The spending by Coinbase alone increased by 4137% in the last six years, from $80,000 in 2017 to $3.39 million in 2022. Additionally, close to half of the total lobbying spending by crypto companies came in 2022 itself, which was $25.57 million out of the last six years\u2019 total of $50.75 million.\n\nDespite the heavy crypto lobbying, I remain optimistic about the positive reception I have received in my meetings. My goal is to continue to spread awareness about the benefits of an efficient, scalable blockchain network, and to provide insights that can help people better understand the true potential of blockchain technology.\n\nWhat\u2019s their level of understanding?\n\nIn my experience, policymakers are still in the process of acquiring knowledge and resources in the realm of distributed ledger technology. Most of them have a one-dimensional understanding of Bitcoin and other digital currency assets, and I spend a great deal of time clarifying the distinction between blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. This is particularly important as policymakers begin to seek input from experts and solicit committee testimony. By helping to separate the conflation of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, I aim to provide policymakers with a more nuanced understanding of this emerging technology and its potential implications.\n\nIt is essential to provide policymakers with a more nuanced understanding of this emerging technology, particularly as it relates to national information security, national economic security, national energy security, and gaining a competitive advantage through innovation. By highlighting these critical aspects, I aim to help policymakers recognize the potential implications of blockchain technology and its impact on various industries. Through greater awareness and understanding, policymakers can make informed decisions and enact policies that promote the responsible adoption and integration of blockchain technology in society.\n\nWere any of them surprised to hear what you had to say, and did you change any minds?\n\nDuring my meetings with policymakers, blockchain and DLT experts, and industry leaders, I believe that all parties were surprised by some of the insights I shared. I myself was surprised by some of the reactions I received, as many officials were open to hearing new perspectives and gaining a deeper understanding of the utility side of blockchain technology.\n\nI have also received feedback from individuals who have read portions of my book and engaged with my ideas. Some of them have shared that my perspectives have changed their understanding of Bitcoin and its potential implications.\n\nWhile it is difficult to determine whether I have changed anyone\u2019s mind entirely, I believe that my efforts to provide a more nuanced understanding of blockchain technology have been well-received. As policymakers and industry leaders continue to learn more about this emerging technology, I am hopeful that we can work together to build a more efficient and sustainable blockchain network that benefits society as a whole.\n\nDo you feel like they truly understand what blockchain is for, or are interested in learning?\n\nBased on my interactions with policymakers, I believe that they recognize the potential of blockchain technology and its potential impact on various industries. While some may have a limited understanding of the technical aspects of blockchain, they are earnestly interested in learning more about its potential applications and implications.\n\nIn my experience, policymakers are receptive to new perspectives and are open to hearing from experts in the field. They seek ways to leverage its potential to drive innovation and improve efficiency.\n\nIt is important to note that the media also plays a significant influence in the discussion surrounding blockchain technology. Policymakers often take cues from media coverage to shape their understanding of the technology.\n\nSince the collapse of FTX, I have noticed a shift in the media\u2019s approach to reporting on blockchain technology. In my conversations with reporters, I have observed a greater willingness to understand the technology and report more accurate and insightful information about it. This is a positive development, as accurate reporting is crucial to help policymakers make informed decisions about the potential applications and implications of blockchain technology.\n\nOverall, I am optimistic about the level of interest and willingness to learn about true blockchain technology among policymakers and believe that this bodes well for the future of the technology.\n\nWhat issues seem to most concern elected representatives and regulators?\n\nElected representatives and their staff can have varying degrees of exposure and experiences depending on their affiliation and beliefs. In the United States, for example, the DNC tends to prioritize consumer protection and regulation of financial markets. Consequently, they have greater concerns over potential fraud, money laundering, and other illicit activities in the cryptocurrency space. Additionally, the DNC has shown concern for the environmental impact of digital currencies and blockchain technology.\n\nIn contrast, the GOP tends to be more supportive of the free market and innovation. As a result, they are more likely to support cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. However, the GOP also shows concern for national security, specifically the risk of cyberattacks and terrorist financing, which has led to greater scrutiny and regulation of digital assets.\n\nIt is important to note that these party differences are not absolute, and there is still a great deal of nuance and complexity in their respective positions. Ultimately, understanding these differences can provide insight into how policymakers may approach issues related to blockchain technology and digital assets.\n\nDid you encounter any resistance?\n\nI am pretty thankful that almost all of the representatives and agencies I have met with to date, (70+) have been extremely receptive to my perspective. I can recall only one instance where the staffer was unreceptive and did not welcome new perspectives. Despite this, we still had a very productive conversation about the historical events surrounding the development of Bitcoin, including the identity of its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nHas there been any response from the people you addressed them to?\n\nWe have received responses from the individuals and agencies we had meetings with and are actively collaborating with various House and Senate offices, as well as Federal and State Agencies. Our objective is to serve as a valuable resource and demonstrate how this technology can be harnessed to benefit not only the country as a whole, but also the representative states and towns of these offices. Through these collaborations, we aim to build constructive relationships and facilitate the responsible and effective implementation of blockchain technology.\n\nIn your opinion, do any business/political circumstances need to change for BSV to become more widely accepted as the \u201cuniversal ledger of truth\u201d?\n\nIn my view, the factors affecting the adoption of BSV as the universal ledger of truth are constantly evolving, and it\u2019s essential to remain flexible as events unfold. The timeline of events post-FTX has led to increased awareness among policymakers, regulators, and consumers about the real motivations behind the \u201ccryptocasino.\u201d\n\nThere are numerous developers and entrepreneurs who are dedicated to building innovative applications and services. Their efforts, combined with continued education, collaboration, and innovation, give me confidence that BSV will ultimately gain widespread acceptance and adoption as a transformative technology. This is a goal that I am dedicated to making progress on every day.\n\nHas the recent situation with multiple bank failures/bailouts increased the urgency for a more transparent, accountable system?\n\nI think the recent failure of Silicon Valley Bank has caused some significant concern, not only for digital currencies but for the financial industry as a whole. It has highlighted the need for a more transparent and accountable system. BSV has the potential to provide the infrastructure to empower better security, transparency, and accountability. Although I have not had any direct conversations on this specific use case, I anticipate that it will become a topic of discussion in the future.\n\nWatch: SmartLedger team on CoinGeek Weekly Livestream with Kurt Wuckert Jr.\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "title": "Bitcoin doesn't fix this - CoinGeek",
        "content": "As we watch the Federal Reserve, FDIC and other agencies reassure the world that \u201ceverything is fine,\u201d we also have to deal with the nauseating cacophony of small blockers pretending to be excited about global collapse because \u201cBitcoin fixes this.\u201d\n\nAs a Bitcoiner, I don\u2019t think it does, and here\u2019s why!\n\nWhat is fractional reserve banking?\n\nBanks keep only a fraction of the funds deposited by their customers on reserve, while lending out the rest to borrowers. In other words, banks are allowed to lend out a portion of the money that they receive from depositors, rather than holding onto all of it. This is great when faith in the institution is strong, but when the economy (or in some cases, the news) makes people feel uneasy, this can change rapidly.\n\nThe idea behind fractional reserve banking is that it allows banks to earn a profit by charging interest on loans, while also providing a convenient service to customers by allowing them to easily access their funds with friendly tellers and a mix of payment tools. However, it also creates a potential problem known as a \u201crun on the bank,\u201d where depositors all try to withdraw their funds at the same time, leaving the bank unable to fulfill all of the withdrawal requests.\n\nTo prevent this from happening, governments typically require banks to hold a certain percentage of their deposits in reserve, and there are vehicles like the FDIC that guarantee deposits with a federally backed insurance system.\n\nGreat! R-r-r-right?\n\nWell, not always.\n\nWhy do bank runs happen?\n\nA bank run is like a game of musical chairs, but with money. As soon as the music stops, everyone rushes to grab a chair (or their money), leaving a few unlucky folks standing without a seat (or their savings). It\u2019s like the world\u2019s least-fun game show, where the prize is just getting your own money back.\n\nThe problem is the spillover effects of such behavior can lead to what the media called \u201ccontagion\u201d where increasingly larger banks have runs as people get more and more spooked\u2014potentially leading to a full-blown financial crisis.\n\nWhen banks like Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse fail, there is a sudden and significant loss of confidence in the financial system, and in this case, it might lead to a widespread panic and a rush to sell off larger and more systemic assets, including stocks, bonds, and real estate. Coupled with the rapid increase in interest rates, rising cost of living and other macroeconomic concerns, the world economy is looking like an increasingly shaky prospect.\n\nSo, Bitcoin fixes this?\n\nThe phrase \u201cBitcoin fixes this\u201d is often used by proponents of Bitcoin (most typically BTC) to suggest that the use of Bitcoin can help address certain issues in the current financial system, such as inflation, government corruption, or centralized control of money. But this is mostly nonsense.\n\nThis ignores what banks and Bitcoin actually do! Lending is an important economic function, and it is entered into with known risks. If lending occurred in an \u201call Bitcoin\u201d economy, the same risks would still exist because loans inherently have risk.\n\nFor small blockers, they seem to mean that holding Bitcoin should accrue value forever, and therefore someone who has Bitcoin would have no need for a loan ever again. But if their coins aren\u2019t meant to be spent, how can someone ever buy anything? Or maybe they just mean everyone can audit everything forever. Who knows?\n\nBitcoin doesn\u2019t fix this\n\nIn reality, Bitcoin was designed to solve problems of payment friction and data integrity.\n\nThere might be some tangential use cases where the use of Bitcoin can help the audit trail or public attestation of reserves, but the world can\u2019t function with low velocity money and everyone banking with a full reserve institution.\n\nWe need some debt, we need risk, we need credit systems and we need highly liquid digital cash that can be used by billions of people on earth. Right now, no blockchain is capable of that scale as currently implemented, and most don\u2019t even think it is worth it to try.\n\nAn attitude of separatism and seclusion will work for some people in a crisis, but by design, it can\u2019t work for too many people at once. And if the world truly falls into chaos, it might be wiser to have guns, ammo, water filtration and precious metals for the doomsday portfolio.\n\nAnd while everyone\u2019s hoarding apocalypse assets while praying for collapse, I still think it is both wise and moral to focus on reducing global payment friction and building a base layer that can manage tokens, contracts, titles and other data in a way that stops the economy from collapsing at all.\n\nWouldn\u2019t that be better?\n\nThat\u2019s something Bitcoin could fix, if we could just work together.\n\nWatch Kurt Wuckert Jr. on CoinGeek Conversations: Bitcoin needs more salespeople\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

And we want as many industry-leading software providers as possible.\n\nCasino Bonuses and Promotions:\n\nBonuses are another critical factor in ranking the best crypto casinos.\n\nWe want to see large welcome bonuses that can be used to play slots, as well as ongoing promotions that will keep players coming back for more.\n\nWe want bonus money but also crypto slots free spins, reload bonuses, and fair wagering requirements across the board so you can get your hands on the bonus money you won playing crypto casino slots.\n\nPayment Options and Payout Times:\n\nWe\u2019re after online Bitcoin casinos here, so much is clear. But we also want payment variety, meaning online casinos that support altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin Cash, or Dogecoin.\n\nPayout times should be measured in minutes if possible, and the fees should be as close to 0. If fiat currency is supported in addition to crypto payments, that\u2019s great as well\n\nMobile Optimization and Customer Support:\n\nThe best online casinos will be fully optimized for mobile play, meaning you can access all your favorite slots and casino games from all mobile devices, including your smartphone or tablet.\n\nAnd finally, we want to see excellent customer support so you can get help when you need it. Live chat support is a must, and we also want to see email and phone support for players who need it.\n\nGuide to Playing Bitcoin Slot Machine Games\n\nCan I Play Free Bitcoin Slots?\n\nYes, free Bitcoin slots are readily available at all crypto slots sites we recommend. We always say you should play Bitcoin slot machines in free mode before putting real money on the line.\n\nThis way, you can get a feel for the game and decide if it\u2019s something you want to spend your money on. Most of the time, you\u2019ll find that the free versions are just as good as the real money games, if not better!\n\nDo Bitcoin Slot Machines Have a Higher RTP Than Traditional Online Slots Games?\n\nThe short answer is no. The RTP (return to player) of a Bitcoin slot machine is usually the same as a regular slot machine.\n\nThe RTP is a mathematical formula used by casinos to determine how much they can expect to earn from a slot game over time. It\u2019s important to remember that the RTP is a long-term average, so you might experience some variation in your results.\n\nCan I Win Bitcoin Playing Slots?\n\nYes, you can! People have won (and continue to win) large sums of Bitcoin by playing slot games.\n\nOf course, luck plays a big role in winning any kind of casino game, but there are some things you can do to increase your chances of success.\n\nFor one, make sure you\u2019re playing at a reputable casino with a good selection of high-quality games.\n\nAnother thing you can do is take advantage of casino bonuses and promotions. Many casinos offer deposit bonuses, which give you extra money to play with when you make a deposit.\n\nYou can also look for special promotions that allow you to win big prizes or even jackpots. These are usually offered by progressive slots, with a growing jackpot that gets bigger the more people play.\n\nSo keep your eyes peeled for these opportunities, and you could be the next big winner!\n\nWhat Are the Best Bitcoin Slots To Play?\n\nThere are so many great Bitcoin slots out there that it\u2019s hard to choose just a few. However, some of our favorites include\n\nMaster of Starz at Bitstarz\n\n777 Deluxe at Ignition\n\nRags to Witches at Super Slots\n\nThese are just a few of the many great Bitcoin slots available today. So take your pick and start playing!\n\nWhat Are the Best Crypto Slots Sites?\n\nAfter a lengthy review process, we can say that the following 5 platforms are the best crypto slots sites right now:\n\nBitstarz is the best crypto slots site overall because it offers the most impressive catalog of slot games combined with up to 5 BTC in welcome bonus money and 180 free spins.\n\nBC Game excels in terms of variety of Bitcoin slots; Ignition is where it\u2019s at for higher-RTP online slots, while Red Dog hosts a fantastic selection of RTG crypto slots.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re a bonus hunter, Super Slots is one of the best crypto slot sites.\n\nAre Bitcoin Slots Than Traditional Slots?\n\nYes, we think so! Bitcoin casinos offer more anonymity than regular casino sites. This is because you don\u2019t need to provide personal information when signing up for an account at the casino. All you need is a valid email address.\n\nAdditionally, crypto casinos usually have lower fees than traditional casinos online. This is because Bitcoin transactions have lower fees than credit card or e-wallet transactions.\n\nLastly, Bitcoin casinos offer faster withdrawals than traditional online casinos. This is because there are no third-party processors involved in processing Bitcoin transactions.\n\nSo if you\u2019re looking for a more anonymous, efficient, and cost-effective gambling experience, we recommend checking out crypto slots.\n\nAre Bitcoin Slots Safe?\n\nYes, Bitcoin slots hosted at crypto casinos recommended in this guide are safe and often provably fair.\n\nProvably fair games utilize a system that allows players to verify the fairness of each game round. This means that you can be sure that the results of each spin or roll are completely random and unbiased.\n\nAlso, every crypto casino we recommend is licensed and SSL encrypted, meaning your personal and financial information is always safe and secure.\n\nIf you want a safe and fair gambling experience, we recommend checking out Bitstarz, the No. 1 Bitcoin casino in the world.\n\nComparing the Top 5 Bitcoin Slots Sites\n\nBitstarz (Master Of Starz): The best online casino to play slots using crypto, bar none.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has achieved a significant milestone in its history by running non-stop for a decade without any downtime, paving the way for a new era of decentralized finance.\n\nIn particular, data retrieved from BitcoinUptime, shared by Reddit user Tasigur1 on March 17, indicates that Bitcoin has run continuously, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for the last 10 years with no issues at all. The period translates to 3,650 days of operating without disruption.\n\n\n\nBitcoin\u2019s historical uptime as retrieved on March 17. Source: BitcoinUptime\n\nSince the cryptocurrency\u2019s inception in 2009, the network has suffered two major downtimes. One notable incident occurred in 2010 when a block contained a transaction that created an astronomical number of Bitcoins due to an overflow in the code. However, the community quickly discovered and fixed the issue, ensuring the integrity of the Bitcoin network. Interestingly, Bitcoin\u2019s uptime stood at 99.908% in 2010.\n\nAnother issue arose in 2013 when a block with more transaction inputs than previously seen was mined and broadcasted, causing a fork in the blockchain.\n\nSimilarly, the community quickly detected and resolved the issue, preventing any significant damage to the network. The incident resulted in a Bitcoin uptime of 99.932% for 2013.\n\nImplication of Bitcoin\u2019s 10 year uptime\n\nThe fact that Bitcoin has been running without downtime for ten years is a testament to the resilience and reliability of its underlying blockchain technology. Notably, the decentralized nature makes it extremely difficult for anyone to take down the network or compromise its security.\n\nThe uptime status further validates Bitcoin\u2019s founding ideologies of solving the traditional finance sector\u2019s shortcomings. The 24/7 availability means that it is always accessible to users, regardless of their location. This has made it an attractive option for people who want to make transactions outside of regular banking hours or live in countries where traditional banking services are not readily available.\n\nAdditionally, the milestone coincides with a period in which the United States banking sector is facing a crisis following the high profile collapse of three lenders within days.\n\nRenewed interest in Bitcoin\n\nIndeed, Bitcoin\u2019s ten-year milestone comes when the cryptocurrency is experiencing renewed interest from investors and traders.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has been steadily climbing in recent days, reaching new multi-month highs. By press time, the maiden cryptocurrency was trading at $26,877 with 24-hour gains of over 7%. On the weekly chart, BTC is up 35%.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart.

This is not necessarily large in relative scale. However, observing net exchange withdrawals, especially within the current hostile regulatory environment, does speak to a degree of investor confidence that is worth noting.\u201d\n\nBTC and ETH exchange net position change. Source: Glassnode\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin has put some breaks on its recent progress, gaining only 0.17% on the day and at press time trading at the price of $24,674, as it began to consolidate the weekly increases of 13.64% and of 13.14% on its monthly chart.\n\nBitcoin 7-day price chart.
