        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Exchange traded funds myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nInvestors piled money into bitcoin futures ETFs in 2022, even though the price of the cryptocurrency plunged 65 per cent.\n\nInvestors ploughed $241mn into the six US bitcoin futures ETFs during the first 11 months of 2022, according to data from Morningstar Direct. And most of that money \u2014 $198mn \u2014 was added after June, which bitcoin payment service provider Bitpay marks as the start of a crypto \u201cdeep freeze\u201d.\n\nProShares in October 2021 launched the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, the first bitcoin futures ETF. It amassed $1.2bn in assets within two days.\n\nBut its assets tumbled to $549mn by year-end, largely because of market depreciation. Sales of the ETF have held steady throughout the crypto winter, as the ETF collected monthly net inflows for all but three of the first 11 months of 2022, according to Morningstar data.\n\nThis article was previously published by Ignites, a title owned by the FT Group.\n\nInvestors piled $259mn into the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF during the year ended November 30, the database shows.\n\n\u201cA futures-based ETF is a very robust, \u2018belt and suspenders\u2019 solution for people who are looking for exposure,\u201d said Simeon Hyman, global investment strategist at ProShares. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten big reminders of the challenges with the spot market and exchanges, which are not mature yet.\u201d\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has not approved any ETFs that invest in spot bitcoin, citing concerns around fraud and manipulation. But the regulator has granted approval for ETFs that invest in bitcoin futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, arguing that futures are safer for investors.\n\nCombining the regulated futures market with an ETF wrapper resolves many of the issues with the spot bitcoin market, said Hyman.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one thing that it doesn\u2019t change,\u201d he added. \u201cBitcoin is going to be a volatile thing.\u201d\n\nETFs that invest in companies that benefit from the growth of bitcoin have also recorded net inflows so far this year, but have faltered in the second half.\n\nThose products include the $415mn Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF, $119mn First Trust Indxx Innovative Transaction & Process ETF and $99mn Siren Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF, which each invest in companies involved in the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem, prospectuses show.\n\nInvestors piled a combined $100mn into the 16 bitcoin-related ETFs during the year ended November 30, Morningstar data shows. But nearly all of that money \u2014 $92mn \u2014 went into the Global X Blockchain ETF. Six of the ETFs recorded net outflows over the period.\n\nInvestors holding on to these ETFs might be doing so in hopes that the crypto market would soon recover, analysts said.\n\nAfter soaring to record highs in 2021, digital assets have taken a considerable hit this year, driven down by plummeting cryptocurrency prices and the dramatic collapse of FTX, one of the largest crypto exchanges.\n\nThe price of bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, tumbled from a high of $68,990 on November 8 2021 to $16,548 on December 31, according to Yahoo Finance.\n\nEthereum has not fared much better despite a successful and highly anticipated update that occurred in September, known as the \u201cmerge\u201d, through which its network upgraded from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake system. Still, the price of ether \u2014 Ethereum\u2019s native coin \u2014 fell from $4,294 on November 21 2021 to $1,197 on December 31, Yahoo Finance data shows.\n\nCrypto\u2019s woes were exacerbated in November when FTX abruptly filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\n\u201cA lot of crypto investors are the \u2018buy the dip\u2019 sort of crowd that we\u2019ve seen really take shape in the last couple of years,\u201d said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar. \u201cIt almost seems like, to some market segments, it\u2019s more of like a religion than an investment at this point.\u201d\n\nFlows into Bitcoin futures ETFs could also be attributed to \u201cinvestor loss aversion\u201d, said Matt Apkarian, associate director of product development at Cerulli Associates.\n\n\u201cA biased investor might say, \u2018I want to hold on to this until it gets back to the price I bought it at [and] I don\u2019t want to sell it at a loss because it\u2019s not a loss until I sell\u2019,\u201d said Apkarian.\n\nBitcoin futures ETFs were \u201cisolated\u201d from the crypto winter and FTX collapse because they are separate from the underlying securities, said Vinod Jain, strategic adviser at Aite Novarica. \u201cYou\u2019re not buying the actual assets,\u201d he added.\n\nThe crypto winter and FTX collapse were unlikely to impact the views of people who back cryptocurrency, said Apkarian.\n\n\u201cThis is just a bump in the road, which in some ways is probably speeding up the inevitable regulation that needs to occur around it,\u201d he added.\n\n*Ignites is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

        "content": "Bitcoin is up more than 4% to start 2023, and the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency space is on the mend to start the new year, but plenty of work remains to regain previous highs.\n\nAfter bitcoin, the largest digital asset, shed roughly two-thirds of its value in 2022 and some other cryptocurrencies performed even worse, some crypto enthusiasts believe that things can\u2019t get much worse in 2023. Naysayers see things differently, and while that debate will be settled as 2023 unfolds, bitcoin volumes are recently muted, and some smaller investors have departed the market.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency spot trading volumes remain similarly muted after slumping about 48% in December versus the previous month to $544 billion, their lowest level since December 2019, CryptoCompare data showed,\u201d reported Reuters. \u201cWhile lower trading volumes are common around the turn of the year, the crypto market apathy has been exacerbated by a \u2018general exodus\u2019 of active retail investors, according to Arcane Research.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks, buyers stepped into the bitcoin market at prices ranging from $16,000 to $17,000 \u2014 it\u2019s slightly above the latter as of late Monday \u2014 indicating that\u2019s a credible support range. Additionally, there are signs that volatility is waning, which has often given way to large moves over bitcoin\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, funding rates for perpetual bitcoin futures have been positive since Dec. 19, according to Coinglass data, meaning traders are betting on prices to rise and will pay to keep their long positions open,\u201d according to Reuters.\n\nStill, crypto bears argue that the FTX contagion is at play and crypto bank Silvergate Bank (NYSE:SI) recently announced layoffs, which is viewed as a negative, albeit a short-term one for the space. There\u2019s also a sense that macroeconomic issues, including inflation, rising interest rates, and the specter of recession, among others, could crimp crypto\u2019s comeback efforts.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, cryptocurrencies remain at the mercy of macroeconomic headwinds as worries whirl around a slowing global economy,\u201d noted Reuters. \u201cEconomic uncertainty could send investors running for the safety of the U.S. dollar , which tends to be inversely correlated to bitcoin, said Dalvir Mandara, quantitative researcher at MacroHive.\u201d\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel .\n\nThe opinions and forecasts expressed herein are solely those of Tom Lydon, and may not actually come to pass.

        "content": "The sight of a forlorn and dishevelled Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, being led away in handcuffs in the Bahamas last month aptly embodied the current plight of an entire industry. After numerous scandals and trillions of dollars wiped off its value in 2022, crypto finds itself on its knees with the vultures circling. Systemic change now seems unavoidable, and the industry can either take the bull by the horns or be forced to by the red-tape mafia waiting in the wings.\n\nCryptocurrency mining rigs at a facility in Quebec, Canada. (Photo by James MacDonald/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nA good place to start would be the industry\u2019s outsized environmental footprint, which currently exceeds that of many countries. Yet some within the industry are rising to the challenge. In September 2022, Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency platform (\u2018ether\u2019 is second only to Bitcoin), almost nullified its power demand through an event called the Merge. By replacing the blockchain\u2019s \u201cproof-of-work\u201d (PoW) mining mechanism with an alternative coined \u201cproof-of-stake\u201d (PoS), Ethereum cut its electricity consumption by 99.84% \u2013 a reduction equivalent to the annual power requirements of Ireland or Austria.\n\nAlthough energy consumption is just one part of crypto\u2019s environmental problems, and it would be premature to declare the Merge an outright victory, the move does offer cryptocurrencies everywhere a possible path towards environmental sustainability. Whether they choose to follow it is another matter.\n\nAlthough estimates of the total environmental footprint of all crypto assets vary, it is thought that the electricity demand of Bitcoin alone exceeded 13GW, with an associated carbon footprint of more than 65 million tonnes of CO2 (MtCO2), in 2021. That demand is just over half that of all global data centres combined and represents nearly 0.5% of global electricity consumption. The associated carbon footprint is bigger than the global CO2 reduction created by all electric vehicles. On top of that, other cryptocurrencies were estimated \u2013 prior to the Merge \u2013 to add another 50% to Bitcoin\u2019s energy demand.\n\nOne recent study indicated that Bitcoin has a greater climate impact than gold mining. The research from the University of New Mexico judged the climate cost of various commodities in relation to their overall market capitalisation. The results found that the climate damage from producing Bitcoin has averaged 35% of its market value over the past five years, peaking at 82% in 2020. That is comparable to 33% for beef production or 46% for natural gas extraction.\n\n\u201cSince Ethereum\u2019s Merge, I would hazard an educated guess that Bitcoin now represents 90% of crypto\u2019s environmental footprint,\u201d says Alex de Vries, a digital currencies researcher at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\n\nHow well do you really know your competitors?

Crypto also has an issue with electronic waste. The hardware used to mine the various cryptocurrencies regularly becomes obsolete. In fact, the annual electronic waste of Bitcoin is equivalent to that of the Netherlands. \u201cAnd that is just Bitcoin,\u201d says Carmine Russo, formerly a visiting researcher at the Centre for Climate Finance & Investment at Imperial College Business School, UK, and now a PhD researcher at the University of Naples Federico II, Italy. \u201cBut consider that there are more than 20,000 cryptocurrencies out there!\u201d\n\nShifting to green crypto\n\nAs crypto\u2019s climate impact has become ever more apparent, regulators have begun sharpening their knives. In some places, the bloodletting has already started. In spring 2021, the Chinese government cited environmental concerns as it introduced a countrywide ban on crypto mining \u2013 effectively evicting most of Bitcoin\u2019s global mining network.\n\nIn March 2022, the European Parliament toyed with a similar ban but settled instead on additional environmental disclosures for crypto asset service providers from 2024. However, the European Central Bank wrote in a July report that it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that European authorities would not pursue crypto mining further \u2013 and potentially ban it outright.\n\nIn the US, the state of New York is poised to introduce new legislation banning cryptocurrency miners from receiving behind-the-meter power from fossil fuel plants. However, mine operators that have already filed paperwork for new or renewal permits are exempt, including the controversial Greenidge Generating Station on the western shore of Seneca Lake. Additionally, a report from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy released in September 2022 recommended promoting \u201cenvironmentally responsible crypto-asset technologies\u201d. Legislation to \u201climit or eliminate\u201d energy-intensive cryptocurrency mining should be introduced if other measures prove ineffective, it added.\n\nChange is also coming from within. In 2021, a coalition of around 200 cryptocurrencies teamed up with think tank RMI to create the Crypto Climate Accord. The signatories agreed to reduce the carbon emissions from their electricity consumption to net zero by 2030, partly using carbon offsets but also by switching all blockchain technology to renewable energy sources by 2025 and using energy tracking tools such as so-called green hashtags.\n\nArguably the largest shot in the arm for the green crypto agenda, however, has come from Ethereum\u2019s Merge \u2013 a small change in the software that effectively replaces the energy-intensive mining process altogether. Blockchains, the technology underlying cryptocurrency, are literal chains of blocks of data; updates to the network are processed within those blocks, which are then added to the end of the chain. No single party is in charge of that process; instead, anyone can proffer their computer hardware to assist in the block-creation process, with a reward offered for every created block. The difference between Bitcoin\u2019s PoW and Ethereum\u2019s PoS relates to how new blocks are added to the blockchain.\n\nWith PoW, the block-creation process is purposely made computationally challenging. New blocks are added to the blockchain only when a \u201cminer\u201d obtains a valid PoW, which can be achieved only through an iterative process of trial and error that is \u201cbest described as a numeric guessing game\u201d, says de Vries. A correct guess completes a block, allowing the winner to add it to the blockchain and claim the reward. The more guesses the miner can generate, the greater their chance of winning. The process repeats indefinitely after every newly created block. \u201cBefore the Merge, the Ethereum network generated around 900 billion of these guesses every second of the day, non-stop,\u201d says de Vries.\n\nWith PoS, however, the network does not incentivise participants, or \u201cminters\u201d, to compete on computational power to create new blocks. Instead, the block selection process is primarily based on wealth. Minters must buy some of the native currency from a cryptocurrency platform, which is then used as collateral in the \u201cstaking\u201d process \u2013 a minimum of 32 units of Ether, in Ethereum\u2019s case. The software then randomly chooses a \u201cstaker\u201d to create the next block for the blockchain. The larger the amount staked, the greater the chance of being chosen. While minters still need a device with sufficient storage capacity and an active internet connection, the computational power of the device is irrelevant. This negates the need for vast mining networks of electricity-gorging computers. \u201cA laptop will suffice,\u201d says Russo.\n\nEthereum\u2019s transition to PoS has reduced its power demand by between 99.84% and 99.9996%, according to a range of estimates, setting a benchmark for decarbonising the world\u2019s remaining PoW-reliant cryptocurrencies. \u201cThis is the solution to getting rid of the majority of crypto\u2019s energy consumption,\u201d says de Vries. \u201cIt solves almost the entirety of the industry's environmental impact.\u201d\n\nIndirectly, it goes a long way to solving crypto\u2019s e-waste problem, explains Russo. \u201cBecause the participants aren\u2019t competing on computational power, they just need a laptop to confirm a transaction, rather than huge amounts of computer hardware that regularly needs replacing when it becomes obsolete.\u201d\n\nNo panacea\n\nHowever, despite the evident promise of the Merge, the purported 99% reduction of Ethereum\u2019s power demand does not quite tell the whole story. The \u2018ASICS\u2019 devices that used to mine PoW Ethereum can still be used to mine the cryptocurrencies Ethereum Classic and EthereumPoW \u2013 a spinoff that maintains the PoW mechanism. Indeed, days after the Merge, the pair had absorbed a quarter of Ethereum\u2019s hashrate (the marker of its mining activity) \u2013 and it was still around a fifth a month later.\n\nFurthermore, the GPUs (a type of computer hardware) formerly used to mine Ethereum can be repurposed to mine other cryptocurrencies, thereby negating some of the Merge\u2019s saved power consumption. However, that would likely come at a cost to miners. For instance, miners on Ethereum Classic can only earn around $0.5m a day compared with the $22.1m they could make from mining Ethereum \u2013 in turn reducing the power expenses they can afford. \u201cI\u2019m mining at a loss,\u201d TheCrowbill, an Ethereum Classic miner, told The Defiant on 27 September. \u201cProbably will remain that way for some time.\u201d\n\n[Keep up with Energy Monitor: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter]\n\nSimilarly, many of the GPUs may have been repurposed to focus on other energy-intensive activities such as cloud computing, AI and gaming. There is also a suspicion that Bitcoin miners have pounced on the data centre space that has become available as result of the Merge. Between 250,000 and 500,000 Bitcoin mining devices are thought to remain unused for a lack of data centre rack space.\n\nFinally, although the Merge makes Ethereum one of most energy-efficient cryptocurrencies, it still remains less efficient than more centralised alternatives. The underlying blockchain technology replicates data and processes over thousands of participating devices, resulting in more data redundancy and higher associated energy costs from maintaining multiple copies. For example, for the roughly 1.1 million transactions a day that Ethereum processes since the Merge, the average electricity consumed per transaction ranges from 0.8 to 14.7 watt-hours (Wh). A Mastercard transaction, by contrast, consumes just 0.7Wh on average.\n\nConverting Bitcoin\u2019s sceptics\n\nNonetheless, many of these issues would be redundant if all cryptocurrencies switched from PoW to PoS. So, unlike many industries, crypto\u2019s path to decarbonisation appears relatively simple. The very sizeable snag, however, is that the Bitcoin community \u2013 the source of the lion\u2019s share of remaining emissions \u2013 has shown little willingness to make the move.\n\nThe Change the Code campaign launched by Greenpeace in 2022 aimed to convince Bitcoin to ditch PoW, but it was met with outright hostility by much of the community. They see the software\u2019s immutability as one of its foundational strengths and the source of its enduring value, and due to the network\u2019s decentralised structure, it is hard to imagine convincing the entire community to make the jump.\n\n\u201cThe solution is there, but now you need to get this really stubborn community to think about adopting it,\u201d says de Vries. \u201cThat is the hard part, especially since there is nobody in charge who can enforce the decision.\u201d\n\nIt is made even more difficult by the fact that many in that community are notoriously unconcerned by climate change. \u201cA lot of the loudest influencers in the Bitcoin community are climate change deniers, who often make statements like, \u2018we breathe out carbon, so how can it be so bad?\u2019\u201d adds de Vries.\n\nEthereum has, however, proven that it is possible to convince a disparate, doubting community to shift to PoS, without any resulting increase in much-dreaded centralisation. The apparent success of the Merge may convert a fair few of Bitcoin\u2019s doubters. \u201cYou don\u2019t necessarily need to convince the entire Bitcoin community,\u201d notes de Vries. \u201cYou just need a critical mass.\"\n\nA transition to PoS by Bitcoin would likely result in more climate benefits than the Merge, as unlike the GPUs formerly used to mine Ethereum, Bitcoin\u2019s ASIC-based devices cannot easily be repurposed.\n\nNet-zero crypto\n\nThe possibility of crypto ever reaching net-zero emissions is inextricably wedded to Bitcoin\u2019s adoption of PoS or a similarly energy-efficient mining mechanism \u2013 and if and when that will happen depends on who you ask. Much will depend on the direction of the price of Bitcoin going forward. \u201cIf the price goes up again consistently, I don\u2019t see the community considering a change in the software,\u201d says de Vries. \u201cBut if it keeps going down, they will have a serious [financial] concern on their hands and will be much more willing to contemplate changes.\u201d\n\nIf governments were to slam a range of adverse regulations on Bitcoin for continuing to use PoW, de Vries also believes much of the community would soon change its tune. \u201cIn the end, money talks,\u201d he says.\n\nConsidering the Merge reduced Ethereum\u2019s power consumption by 99%, Russo believes that if all the other cryptocurrencies followed suit, the industry could reach net zero \u201cin a few years\u201d. He points out that it took Ethereum five years to complete the transition. \u201cSo let's say that on average, we need ten years to do this with other cryptocurrencies,\u201d he says. \u201cI think in 15 years, if crypto still exists, it will be a much more sustainable environment.\u201d\n\nUltimately, for Bitcoin, the writing is on the wall \u2013 or, more accurately, in the source code. Around 19 million of the planned 21 million Bitcoins have already been created. And when that quota is filled, there will be no incentive for mining left. That will be great news for the environment; the only downside is that is not forecast to happen until 2140. \u201cFor humanity\u2019s sake, let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t come down to that,\u201d says de Vries."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) hash rate surged 17% to an all-time high of 361.28EH/s on Jan. 6 from around 233 EH/s recorded on the same day \u2014 the second biggest one-day increase in the past year.\n\nIt has since retraced to 269.56 EH/s, as of press time.\n\nOver the past week, data shows that Foundry USA contributed 29.08% of the total hashrate, followed by Antpool\u2019s 20.38% and F2Pool with 16.12%.\n\nMacroMicro also suggested that the average cost of mining BTC was greater than the asset\u2019s spot price. According to the data, BTC\u2019s average mining cost as of Jan. 7 was $19,230.\n\nSince BTC\u2019s hash rate Christmas decline, the network has added 50th/s. During the festive period, the hash rate plunged by around 40% amid poor weather conditions that forced major miners to shut operations.\n\nMeanwhile, BTC\u2019s hash rate uptick is expected to lead to a 7% to 10% increase in mining difficulty.\n\nBTC\u2019s mining difficulty is currently at 34.09T. The estimated increase will see the mining difficulty rise to between 36.6T and 37.7T, according to bitrawr."

        "title": "\u2018A fraud and a bubble are two different things\u2019: Crypto is shocking to a financial historian who literally wrote the book on financial bubbles - Fortune",
        "content": "The crypto space has lost more than $2 trillion in value over the past year. But for crypto loyalists, this is just another Crypto Winter. Remember 2018\u2014when Bitcoin prices dropped 80%, and the media called it \u201cdead\u201d over 90 times? Don\u2019t worry, they say. The Fed is raising interest rates and inflation and recession fears are making investors skittish, so they\u2019re simply pulling back.\n\nThe meltdown of the world\u2019s second-largest crypto exchange, FTX, the blowup of Luna and its sister algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD, and the collapse of high-profile crypto lenders like Celsius and BlockFi, are merely bumps in the road, crypto proponents argue. But William Quinn, a senior lecturer at Queens\u2019 University Belfast whose research focuses on financial bubbles, isn\u2019t so sure.\n\nQuinn believes the cryptocurrency fervor of the past decade is either a \u201cstupider bubble than any previous bubble\u201d in financial history, or \u201ca smarter Ponzi than any previous Ponzi\u201d\u2014or a third option.\n\n\u201cSo we have two possibilities,\u201d he wrote in an article on journalist David Gerard\u2019s website last week. \u201cAnd the truth is probably somewhere in the middle.\u201d\n\nQuinn, who wrote the book Boom and Bust: A Global History of Financial Bubbles in 2020, said that the cryptocurrency \u201cbubble\u201d doesn\u2019t look like financial bubbles of the past.\n\nThe so-called \u201cTulip Mania\u201d of the 17th century Dutch Golden Age was more of a \u201cpopular narrative\u201d than a true financial bubble of modern scale, he said, arguing that it \u201cmade far too much sense to be compared to the crypto bubble.\u201d And the dotcom bubble that began in the late \u201990s is nothing but a \u201cvery flattering comparison\u201d to crypto, according to the historian.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that crypto and blockchain, unlike the internet, are simply not very useful,\u201d he argued.\n\nFor Quinn, there may not be a financial bubble in history that is worth comparing to the cryptocurrency mania of the past decade\u2014this could be something else entirely.\n\nWhat makes the crypto bubble unique\n\nQuinn writes that cryptocurrencies have three defining features that make them unique from past financial bubbles.\n\nFirst, they have \u201cno use-value\u201d unless others are willing to accept them. Second, they don\u2019t create cash flows. And third, some have mining costs that can only be paid in fiat, or government-issued, currencies. For example, Bitcoin miners typically buy electrical equipment, mining computers, and real estate with U.S. dollars.\n\n\u201cNot all major cryptocurrencies are exactly like this, but most are close,\u201d Quinn wrote. \u201cThese are uniquely terrible characteristics for an investment.\u201d\n\nQuinn argued that these three unique characteristics mean the real question could be whether to classify crypto as a \u201cfraud\u201d or a \u201cbubble.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery previous bubble I\u2019ve encountered has involved either a commodity, a collectible, or an asset with associated cash flows\u2026[b]ecause historically, producing a financial asset with no associated cash flows and marketing it as an investment would have been considered fraud,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd a fraud and a bubble are two different things.\u201d\n\nQuinn is careful not to portray all cryptocurrencies in the same light. He writes that some, like Bitcoin, shouldn\u2019t be considered frauds because they don\u2019t have a main \u201cperpetrator.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin was created as a sincere\u2014if somewhat unhinged\u2014political project, and operates independently of its creator. It\u2019s a bad investment in the same way that a fraud is a bad investment, but it\u2019s not a fraud,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBlockchain\u2019s proponents\n\nOf course, for every crypto skeptic, there\u2019s a supporter ready to counter their argument. Even some of Wall Street\u2019s most respected investors have become crypto bulls. The billionaire hedge funder Bill Miller said in January of 2022 that he has 50% of his net worth in Bitcoin. In May, he called the cryptocurrency \u201cinsurance\u201d against financial disasters on the Richer, Wiser, Happier podcast.\n\nAnd the financial services industry has also leaned into blockchain technology in recent years. Visa\u2019s current president, Ryan McInerney, who is set to become CEO in February, told Fortune\u2019s Alan Murray in November that there may be \u201cnew use cases\u201d for the blockchain in payments systems.\n\n\u201cWe do a lot of work on different opportunities using the blockchain,\u201d he said. We think it\u2019s possible [it will be part of the future payment system], but we are in the very, very early innings. It\u2019s yet to be seen.\u201d\n\nCarmelle Cadet, CEO of the fintech startup Emtech, told Fortune\u2019s Sheryl Estrada in October that blockchain tech is the future and CFOs will likely adopt it in the coming years because it allows companies to account for assets and their ownership via a secure, decentralized ledger.\n\nAn improvement on past Ponzis?\n\nStill, Quinn argues that most cryptocurrencies could be viewed as a form of \u201cimprovement on the traditional Ponzi scheme,\u201d and he isn\u2019t the only one with that perspective. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon made a similar claim in September of last year, calling cryptocurrencies \u201cdecentralized Ponzi schemes\u201d in testimony to the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services.\n\n\u201cThe notion that it\u2019s good for anybody is unbelievable,\u201d he said, arguing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are \u201cdangerous.\u201d\n\nAnd NYU professor emeritus Nouriel Roubini has repeatedly slammed cryptocurrencies for years, even calling them \u201cPonzi scams\u201d and a form of \u201ccorrupt gambling\u201d in recent interviews.\n\nCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin work the same way as Ponzi schemes, according to critics like Roubini and Quinn, with new investors paying out early investors because no actual cash flows are being produced."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) community members took to social media in response to the claims of Peter Zeihan, a recent guest on the Joe Rogan Experience (JRE) podcast.\n\nIn a recent JRE episode, Zeihan, an American geopolitical analyst and author, claimed that crypto was always a \u201chot dumpster fire\u201d and that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. The analyst claimed that the number one digital asset by market capitalization is now being priced \u201cmore appropriately.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Zeihan argued that Bitcoin, which is trading at around $17,000 at the time of writing, will go down by $17,000 more, saying that its appropriate price is within the negatives. He added:\n\n\u201cThe craziest thing about Bitcoin is that there will never be more than X number of units of Bitcoin. By default, it means it can\u2019t be used for trade.\u201d\n\nZeihan also argued that the \u201cwhole idea of economic activity is that there\u2019s expansion, which means you need more currency to lubricate and manage that expansion.\u201d The analyst argued that if a currency\u2019s supply is locked, there will be monetary inflation and this could \u201cdestroy an economic model.\u201d\n\nBecause of Zeihan\u2019s comments, Bitcoiners almost immediately offered their responses and provided counterarguments to Zeihan\u2019s claims. Some community members instantly pointed out that the analyst has not read and understood the Bitcoin white paper.\n\nBitcoiner highlighting the tell of not reading the BTC whitepaper. Source: Twitter\n\nSwan Bitcoin executive Alex Stanczyk also criticized the JRE guest and said his comments were ignorant. \u201cAlmost every single thing this \u2018expert\u2019 said in this short span of time is complete nonsense,\u201d Stanczyk wrote.\n\nJeff Ross, the founder of the Vailshire Capital Management hedge fund, also pointed out the flaws in Zeihan's arguments. He tweeted:\n\nThree critical errors in @PeterZeihan's logic that I see:\n\n1. To be valid, money must be created and controlled by a central authority. \u274c\n\n2. Scarce money limits human productivity and economic expansion. \u274c\n\n3. #Bitcoin and #crypto are interchangeable. \u274c\n\n\n\ncc: @joerogan https://t.co/gA5szpZe7L \u2014 Dr. Jeff Ross (@VailshireCap) January 8, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, one community member proudly defended Bitcoin and argued that some of its characteristics give it intrinsic value. They include scarcity, deflation, divisibility into smaller amounts called satoshis and decentralization.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin mining stocks surge with broader market as traders see less aggressive Fed\n\nWhile Rogan didn\u2019t argue with Zeihan\u2019s claims in the episode, the popular podcaster has previously voiced positive sentiments toward Bitcoin. On May 4, 2022, Rogan said that BTC is similar to the early internet and that the government did not see it coming. The podcaster also highlighted that it is a \u201cviable form of currency\u201d and can be used to purchase things."

        "title": "The Top 7 Cryptos to Buy Before the Next Bitcoin Halving - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "As we head into a new year, 2023 is set to be the best time to look for cryptos to buy. The turbulence last year due to rate hikes and the selloff of cyclical assets such as cryptos might make it look all doom and gloom. But the bottom has historically been the best time to buy.\n\nOf course, it is difficult to predict the actual bottom, but many projects now sit well below pre-pandemic prices, with little downside risk. Moreover, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) will halve its mining rewards sometime in Q1 2024. As most cryptos correlate with BTC, this halving will likely start another crypto bull run next year, continuing the historical trend.\n\nTherefore, let\u2019s\u2019 dive into the following seven cryptos to buy, as they can benefit heavily from Bitcoin\u2019s halving. I highly recommend doing your own research into these tokens, as many of them are small-cap projects.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD)\n\nUp trend Technical graph of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) in futuristic concept, BITI ETF is a Bitcoin short fund for investors betting against Bitcoin.\n\nSource: Sittipong Phokawattana / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnsurprisingly, Bitcoin will be the biggest beneficiary of the halving. The standard deviation of BTC is lower than almost every other cryptocurrency, excluding stablecoins. Thus, if you are looking for the safest cryptos to buy, Bitcoin should always be your go-to project due to its evergreen status.\n\nI\u2019d even say it is the only crypto project worth dollar-cost averaging into, as positive returns are very likely if you choose to hold for many years. It is a tried and tested asset with a solid reputation and won\u2019t disappoint in the long run. I cannot say the same for any other asset in this article.\n\nIn the current environment, BTC is by far your best bet. There are no guarantees that the crypto market is at a bottom, and Standard Chartered analysts forecast Bitcoin could go as low as $5,000 this year. The scarier part of this scenario is that more cyclical altcoins will be hit much harder.\n\nStory continues\n\nConversely, the economy remains healthy, with the recent jobs report indicating a robust labor market. If the Fed does a U-turn in late 2023 or early 2024 and the Bitcoin halving occurs within the expected time, BTC is likely to surge. Thus, it remains the best among the cryptos to buy.\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD)\n\nCrypto currency etherium. ethereum coin on exchange charts. e-currency Ethereum. Ethereum price predictions\n\nSource: viktoryabov / Shutterstock.com\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD) is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and should be your second option if you are looking for safer cryptos to buy. Although ETH is more volatile than BTC, it is an established project that has survived multiple crypto market cycles and outperformed Bitcoin of late.\n\nThe project is at the forefront of Web3 and blockchain development, leading the development of smart contract-based applications such as non-fungible tokens. A significant number of NFTs and Web3 projects are also being developed on the Ethereum blockchain. However, the most considerable advantage of Ethereum is that thousands of crypto projects rely on the blockchain and need ETH for gas fees. There are 744,000 ERC20 tokens on the network, generating significant demand for Ethereum.\n\nFurthermore, the network\u2019s switch to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus reduced ETH issuance by 88%. In the next crypto market rally, increased ETH demand and reduced issuance will likely make Ethereum trade at a much higher valuation.\n\nSticking with Bitcoin and Ethereum will give you a balanced risk-reward ratio. Thus, I recommend you venture into other cryptos only if you seek outsized returns with little regard for risk.\n\nLitecoin (LTC-USD)\n\nSilver Litecoin coin facing forward on a pile of litecoins\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMuch like Bitcoin, Litecoin (LTC-USD) is a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain that undergoes a halving event. The next halving event for Litecoin will occur in August this year and cut mining rewards to 6.25 LTC from 12.5. That should significantly increase the value of this cryptocurrency, as it is among the most popular blockchains for miners after Ethereum shifted to a PoS consensus.\n\nFurthermore, while many thought of Litecoin as an old and irrelevant project, its recent MimbleWimble upgrade added much-needed utility and is bringing it back to relevancy. Litecoin users can now transact with the same degree of anonymity that many privacy coins such as Monero (XMR-USD) promise, but with Litecoin\u2019s block time of just 2.5 minutes.\n\nI believe LTC is at compelling levels and is bottoming out. It has gained 61%-plus from its trough last year, and I expect these gains to accelerate as it gets closer to halving. Next year, Bitcoin\u2019s halving will be the icing on the cake for this project.\n\nStorj (STORJ-USD)\n\nStorj Logo\n\nSource: storj.io\n\nI\u2019ve discussed Filecoin (FIL-USD) a considerable amount of times in my recent articles, and Storj (STORJ-USD) is similar to that project. The main difference between the two is that Storj maintains a central authority, while Filecoin is peer-to-peer. I believe both will be significant beneficiaries of the burgeoning cloud computing and storage industry, especially once decentralized storage becomes more mainstream.\n\nBlockchain storage is also cheaper than centralized counterparts that run data servers and has no censorship. On top of that, since the blockchain isn\u2019t a single server, the uptime and resiliency of these cloud storage platforms are remarkably high. These factors combined will make blockchain cloud storage projects highly-compelling to end users in the long-run.\n\nOf course, I only recommend small caps like Storj if your risk profile is aggressive. Sticking with more established projects such as Filecoin is a much better idea for long-term investing.\n\nTerareum (TERA-USD)\n\nAn image of a miner with a pickaxe mining digital coins, computer code and various numbers are overlaid on the image\n\nSource: Yev_1234 / Shutterstock\n\nTerareum (TERA-USD) is a centralized crypto exchange, and TERA is the native token of the project. Although the token has taken a hit from the selloff last year due to its small market capitalization and the effects of the current crypto winter affecting all altcoins in addition to Bitcoin and Ethereum, Terareum is highly likely to deliver disproportionately high returns due to its leading utility that has successfully launched on December last year. The Terareum exchange, also known as \u201cTERAREUM,\u201d offers lots of features under one roof, including debit cards, spot trading, and utilities such as Margin, Futures, and Staking capabilities. I recommend further researching the project on its website due to its complexity.\n\nIn addition, Terareum also has a cryptocurrency launchpad called Terapool. The launchpad raises liquidity for other crypto projects with much lower interest rates. Thus, the demand for this token will likely increase in the next cycle, due to new crypto projects and higher user influx into the Terareum exchange. The release in Quarter 3 of 2023 of an indigenous Layer 1 \u2013 Terareum Blockchain based on the PoS concept could also compel large institutional investors.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s also Terapay which enables users to utilize fiat and crypto transactions as a mode of payment for goods using a single platform at many vendors and merchants for online costs. The payment gateway is adopted worldwide and could become a game-changer in the cryptocurrency & Web3 space.\n\nKalima.io (KLX-USD)\n\nBitcoin mining operation. Bitcoin mining farm. GREE stock.\n\nSource: Michal Bednarek / Shutterstock\n\nKalima (KLX-USD) piqued my interest because of the functionality the project aims to provide. On its website, it states that Kalima is a Layer 1 blockchain for enterprises and IoT (Internet of Things). This is a network of blockchains offering quick transactions and limitless scalability.\n\nKalima\u2019s full client nodes can be embedded not only on small IoT devices but also on supercomputers. This includes mobile and web clients, allowing for transactions to be managed with a latency of less than one second. Kalima smart contracts can also be executed on the client side, opening a new world of edge-computing and blockchain technology possibilities.\n\nIts token, KLX, secures the whole Kalima network, enabling the payment of transaction fees, staking, data governance, the acquisition of nodes for PrivaChains, and numerous essential other Kalima Network key functionalities. The Kalima Blockchain allows developers to have complete control of their dApps using standard languages and tools, their governance and business models. Project developers have implemented these features successfully, and I anticipate significant growth for its KLX token.\n\nFinally, Enedis (OTCMKTS:ECIFY), ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT), Tenneco, and Spie are using Kalima\u2019s technology. That\u2019s quite a big plus when it comes to crypto, as only a few projects offer real-world utility. KLX will be listed on the 2nd of February on Bitmart.\n\nLoopring (LRC-USD)\n\nLoopring LRC token symbol of the DeFi system shining in the rays of light.\n\nSource: Vladimir Kazakov / Shutterstock.com\n\nLoopring (LRC-USD) is among the most cyclical cryptos to buy. The primary purpose of this project is to supplement the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s scalability through zkRollups. Of course, this means that the project\u2019s objective becomes redundant when the Ethereum blockchain receives less traffic. Likewise, the opposite is true when the Ethereum network is congested during a crypto bull cycle.\n\nTherefore, buying LRC at the trough before Bitcoin\u2019s halving is an excellent idea. When the Ethereum blockchain becomes congested again, Loopring will offer disproportionately higher returns than the rest of the market.\n\nOn Low-Capitalization and Low-Volume Cryptocurrencies: InvestorPlace does not regularly publish commentary about cryptocurrencies that have a market capitalization of less than $100 million or trade with a volume less than $100,000 each day. That\u2019s because these \u201cpenny cryptos\u201d are frequently the playground for scam artists and market manipulators.

        "title": "2 Charts That Show Why I'm Buying Bitcoin Now - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "In cyclical fashion, we find ourselves yet again in the midst of a crypto winter. And as they have in previous crypto winters, critics and naysayers contend that Bitcoin (BTC 2.44%) is dead, that it can't rise again, that it's a Ponzi scheme heading to zero, and that it will never recover.\n\nAll of these jabs at Bitcoin have been occurring since it was created in 2009, and yet all it has done since is go on a historical run and become the best-performing asset in history. Bitcoin forces us to think about what money actually is and how it should function. Should money be inflated at the desire of any government or central authority? Is money just an idea, or should it be backed by tangible assets? What makes one form of currency better than another?\n\nBitcoin has been touted by some as a near-perfect form of currency. Even with its volatility, which is viewed as a characteristic of new assets that eventually wanes, there is reason to believe that Bitcoin will once again rise from the ashes and reward investors who are patient and hold for the long haul.\n\nOne of Bitcoin's key features as sound money is its inherent scarcity. Ingrained in its code is a hard limit: There will only ever be a maximum of 21 million bitcoins in circulation. The only way this could be changed is if 51% of nodes running the Bitcoin network were in agreement, and I don't think that would ever happen. It's one of the crucial aspects that make Bitcoin, Bitcoin.\n\nThat limited-supply argument helped propel Bitcoin's price during the last 14 years. Since 2009, demand for Bitcoin has only increased, and it will likely continue as it remains resilient, proves to be a viable store of value, and people around the world look for more sound forms of currency.\n\nTo better showcase the dynamics behind Bitcoin's supply and demand, consider the two charts below.\n\nChart No. 1: Rising demand\n\nThere are a handful of metrics that could be used to display the growth in Bitcoin's demand. You might see charts showing the number of active addresses (wallets that send or receive Bitcoin during a specified period), transaction volume, or some other statistic trying to capture a glimpse of activity on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nHowever, while I believe Bitcoin could eventually become a viable form of currency for everyday transactions, most investors who favor it today are drawn to it as a store of value. So to capture its increased demand as a store of value, below is a chart of all Bitcoin addresses that currently hold at least 0.01 bitcoins -- and it's currently sitting at an all-time high.\n\nYou will notice that the chart is displayed on a logarithmic scale. If it were plotted on a linear scale, the line would show a continuous ascension from left to right. Unlike the linear charts that you may be more used to viewing, logarithmic ones are better suited to displaying wide ranges of values or when one wishes to describe the rate at which something grows.\n\nAs you can see, the number of addresses holding at least 0.01 Bitcoins increased the most early on in the token's history but since then, it has continued to rise even in the midst of the current crypto winter. At more than 11 million today, this metric has risen by 70% in the last five years and is up 3,000% since 2013. Talk about demand.\n\nChart No. 2: Outstanding supply\n\nNow let's look at supply. The chart below shows Bitcoin's shrinking supply-side growth. With only 21 million bitcoins set to ever be created, there can only be so many to meet the appetite of increased demand -- especially considering that around 91% of all Bitcoins have already been mined.\n\nAgain, this graph is plotted on a logarithmic scale because it is more sensitive for displaying the rate of change. Notice the difference in slope compared to the other chart? That's because the rate at which new bitcoins enter circulation is decreasing and will only continue to slow. Rather than being inflationary, Bitcoin is considered a deflationary asset -- a great quality for a store of value to possess. Deflationary assets increase an individual's purchasing power over time rather than decreasing it. This is the exact opposite of just about every government-issued currency.\n\nThere are around 19.25 million Bitcoin in circulation today, leaving only 1.75 million more to enter the supply until around the year 2140, when the last Bitcoin will be mined. Given that near-zero coin inflation, Bitcoin could benefit from increased demand and limited supply well into the future. Thanks to increased demand, Bitcoin's price has skyrocketed over the last decade, and I believe it will climb again as it becomes more scarce. That's why I'm a Bitcoin buyer right now."

        "title": "How to Give Cryptocurrency as a Gift - NerdWallet",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency is becoming a popular gift, serving as a way to get a friend or family member acquainted with the crypto space. If the gift is under a certain amount \u2014 $16,000 in 2022 and $17,000 in 2023 \u2014 it's also tax-free.\n\nKeep in mind that cryptocurrency is a relatively risky investment, and prices tend to be volatile. Therefore, high-risk investments such as crypto should make up a small part of your overall portfolio; the same deliberation goes for financial gifts. It's also probably best to gift well-known currencies unless your recipient is already familiar with crypto.\n\nThere are several ways to gift digital coins and tokens, including many simple and low-cost options.\n\nAdvertisement Charles Schwab Interactive Brokers IBKR Lite Webull NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

If you don't already have crypto to give, you can purchase it through a crypto exchange.\n\nYour recipient will also need to have an account to receive the funds. They can give you their wallet address, which may look like a QR code \u2014 a barcode you can scan with your smartphone's camera \u2014 or a long string of numbers and letters to enter when you use the \"Send\" feature on your exchange of choice. Select the currency and the amount you'd like to transfer.\n\n\u00bb Looking for an exchange? Here are our top picks\n\nUse a peer-to-peer money transfer app\n\nDifficulty: Easy.\n\nCost: Medium.\n\nYou'll have to go through a few extra identity verification steps on the app and have a linked payment method to send crypto this way. You can also use these two apps to send crypto to an external crypto wallet if your recipient already has one. Fees vary but are generally higher than crypto exchange or wallet transfers.\n\nPrint a paper wallet\n\nDifficulty: Easy.\n\nCost: Low.\n\nPaper wallets are a simple way to gift crypto, as they're meant for one-time use and can be transferred by handing the paper to someone. This method is best for smaller amounts of crypto, as it's not the most secure way to transfer funds. Paper wallets show the location of the crypto on the blockchain, so anyone with the paper can access it, and paper wallets can be easily destroyed.\n\nA free paper wallet generator, available on platforms such as BitAddress.org and WalletGenerator.net, can help you generate a printable document with a unique public and private key combination. The document will have QR codes that link to these addresses for easy transfer. If your crypto exchange has a mobile app, you can scan that QR code, then follow the steps on the app to send an amount of your choice to the paper wallet address.\n\nPaper wallets can be gifted with a card for a special occasion and are a more tangible form of digital currency. Once received, the funds can be transferred to a software or hardware wallet by scanning the same QR code, or the paper can be stored safely.\n\nUse a crypto gifting service\n\nDifficulty: Easy.\n\nCost: Low to medium.\n\nGifting services explicitly made for cryptocurrency can elevate the sentimental value of a crypto transfer. Options include the Robinhood Crypto Gifting Program or a service such as EarlyBird Crypto, which helps families gift crypto to children through a UGMA custodial account, a tax-advantaged account designed for giving cash or securities to minors.\n\nThe Robinhood Crypto Gifting Program, accessible through the Robinhood app, allows you to send funds commission-free via a link with a tracking feature. In addition, if your gift isn't accepted within 14 days, you won't be charged.\n\nEarlyBird lets you create a video message to accompany each gift and add a kid's milestone moments to the platform to look back on. The service also includes a financial literacy newsletter.\n\nCreate a software wallet\n\nDifficulty: Medium.\n\nCost: Low.\n\nThis method may take a little more effort, as you'll have to install software to create a wallet to transfer. To give a software wallet, first download a mobile or desktop wallet, such as one of these top wallet options, and follow the steps to set up an account.\n\nThe most critical step is copying down the seed or recovery phrase the wallet generates. This will look like a set of 12 or 24 random words, which are essential to recover your wallet funds or transfer them to someone else. The seed phrase must be gifted with the rest of the wallet information.\n\nOnce the seed phrase is ready, you can send your desired amount of crypto to the wallet address you created. Many software wallets have features that let you purchase crypto directly from the wallet or send it from another wallet or exchange.\n\nThe seed phrase is all your recipient needs to recover the funds in the wallet. You can write down instructions to download the same software wallet you created, and once they enter the seed phrase, they'll have access to the funds from their device.\n\nPurchase a hardware wallet\n\nDifficulty: High.\n\nCost: Medium to high.\n\nHardware wallets can be a bit more complicated to use, but they make for a great gift as they're physical devices that can be wrapped. Hardware wallets can also be a more secure storage method, as they're not accessible online.\n\n\u00bb Looking for a hardware wallet? Here are our top picks\n\nTo gift a hardware wallet, you'll need to purchase a device from a hardware wallet company; some are available at stores like Best Buy and Walmart. Once it arrives, you'll need to follow the included instructions to set it up and download the accompanying software.\n\nJust like with a software wallet, it's essential that you write down your 12- or 24-word seed phrase and keep it in a safe place.\n\nTo add crypto to a hardware wallet, you can connect your device to your computer or phone. Some devices plug into your computer with a USB cord; others connect wirelessly via QR code or WiFi. Most accompanying wallet software has tools to purchase crypto directly, or you can send crypto to the wallet address from another wallet or exchange.\n\nOnce funds have been added to the wallet, you can wrap it and gift it, along with the seed phrase information. To elevate the gift, some wallet companies have steel cards available for purchase that can be engraved with a seed phrase.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip Some hardware wallets are electronic devices that look like flash drives; others are card-shaped and are sometimes marketed as cryptocurrency gift cards. Make sure you purchase a cryptocurrency \"gift card\" from a reputable, verified provider that's been well-reviewed, as some \"Bitcoin gift card\" providers may be scams.\n\nHow are crypto gifts taxed?\n\nCryptocurrency gifts are taxed similarly to other monetary gifts and work most similarly to gifting a stock or bond. However, there's no gift tax for giving or receiving crypto under a certain amount.\n\nThe amount that qualifies for a gift-tax exemption is adjusted every year for inflation: For gifts made in 2022, it was $16,000, and for 2023, it will be $17,000. Any gift under that amount is not taxable until the recipient sells the asset.\n\nIf you're gifting crypto over the exemption amount, you'll need to file a gift tax return or Form 709. This includes smaller gifts that add to the total amount ($16,000 in 2022). Crypto is a reasonably new asset that can fluctuate a lot in value, so it's necessary to document your gift properly, especially if it's significant. This should include a letter to the recipient specifying the gift parties, amounts and purpose.\n\n\"It's especially important, with crypto, to ensure you record the right value of the asset,\" Jordan Bass, a tax lawyer and founder of Taxing Cryptocurrency (a tax service that helps clients with crypto accounting). \"Make sure it's understood that it's a gift, not a loan or a payment for services.\"\n\nBass has seen clients gift large amounts of crypto to help pay their parents' mortgages or help them retire. In situations like this, or if a child is gifted crypto that will be held for a long time and possibly increase in value, having a proper record of the original gift can help ensure that there aren't significant tax consequences in the future.\n\nTrack your finances all in one place Get started by signing up and linking an account.

        "title": "Bitcoin surpasses $17K for first time since early December - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Crypto\u2019s benchmark cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has pushed past $17,000 for the first time in 2023 after being range bound for several weeks between $16,380 and $16,975.\n\nBitcoin has now been on a positive trend since the start of January when it opened the year at $16,482. Bitcoin is up 3.72% over the last seven days and 2.33% in the previous 24 hours, according to CryptoSlate data.\n\nWhy is Bitcoin pumping?\n\nWith a lack of significant on-chain developments within the Bitcoin ecosystem, the rally appears unlinked to any news related to the network. Further, noteworthy developments within the crypto space at large to which Bitcoin could react have been scarce.\n\nHowever, as the dust begins to settle on the FTX news cycle, the use case for Bitcoin in self-custody is stronger than ever. A global financial crisis is looming with continually steep inflation, no end in sight for the war in Ukraine, and growing tensions between China and the West. In addition, the concern over which asset class will act as the best store of value in 2023 may be strengthening investors\u2019 resolve in Bitcoin.\n\nWhile Bitcoin acted as a risk-on asset throughout the majority of 2022, eyes now move to whether Bitcoin will repeat its strong performance when the Ukraine war started as we move further into 2023.\n\nThe next Bitcoin halving event is roughly 18 months away, so historical metrics suggest the bull market is not yet around the corner. However, plenty of investors have fled crypto after the tumultuous events of 2022. The collapse of major exchanges, projects, hedge funds, and lending platforms shook out plenty of investors while removing bad actors from the space.\n\nForbes recently discussed potential Bitcoin price predictions for 2023 with Alistair Milne, founder of Altana Digital Currency Fund, suggesting it could reach as high as $300,000 by 2024. Others had more conservative estimates predicting prices between $30,000 and $50,000, such as the Professor of Finance at Sussex University, Carol Alexander.\n\nEric Wall, the CIO of Arcane Assets, also stated the bottom is in for Bitcoin, and it will now race toward a $30,000 price target in 2023.\n\nPotential bear trap\n\nThe biggest elephant in the room, however, is the fate of Digital Currency Group and, therefore, Genesis and the Grayscale Trust. A recent CryptoSlate market report showcased the predicament facing DCG and the potential havoc it could wreak on the crypto industry should it be forced to liquidate assets to avoid bankruptcy.\n\nCryptoSlate is keeping a keen eye on developments at DCG as there have been no further updates following the Winklevoss Twin\u2018s ultimatum regarding Genesis Earn funds. The Winklevoss brothers set a deadline of Jan. 8 for DCG to respond to an open letter, a date which has now passed without a word.\n\nThe Forbes article mentioned above also highlighted several traditional finance companies that predicted Bitcoin would fall below $10,000 this year. Most notably, Eric Robertsen, the Global Head of Research for Standard Chartered, called for $5,000 as \u201ccrypto firms and exchanges find themselves with insufficient liquidity, leading to further bankruptcies and a collapse in investor confidence in digital assets.\u201d\n\nYet, as the chart below indicates, the overall crypto market cap has been rallying since 2023. Over the past nine days, over $50 billion has been injected into the crypto markets. As we welcomed in the new year, the total market cap was $795 billion but has since hit $859 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe global crypto market cap with Bitcoin removed stood at $477 billion on Jan. 1. It has steadily grown to $525 billion, an increase of $58 billion. Thus, while Bitcoin is performing well in 2023, the broader crypto market is outperforming the flagship crypto network. Only $18 billion has been injected into Bitcoin, a mere 4.7% increase in market cap compared to the rest of the total market (minus Bitcoin), which rose by 10%.\n\nNothing has changed regarding Bitcoin\u2019s fundamentals, and 2023 is set to be a year where either the FIAT system solves the inflation problem, or the events of 2008 come back to bite central banks harder than ever.\n\nThe FIAT problem\n\nA world where the FIAT system is on its last legs is a world where Bitcoin has the potential to reign supreme. Time will tell whether the U.S. Federal Reserve, Bank of England, European Central Bank, and Bank of Japan can regain economic control.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has remained flat before starting to rise in value, the Dollar has been downward since late September. The chart below shows the peak strength of the Dollar being reached on Sept. 22, 2022. Since then, it has fallen over 10%, roughly the same decline seen on the Bitcoin chart for the same period.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s volatility has been at some of the lowest levels in its history between November and January, moving around 12% in both directions during the period.\n\nToday\u2019s price action in Bitcoin mirrors the Dollar\u2019s poor performance over the last 24 hours. Since Jan. 6, the DXY has declined by 2.49%, while Bitcoin has risen by 2.9%. Of course, neither of these moves is unprecedented. However, should the DXY continue to fall throughout 2023, it could give Bitcoin the strength it needs to return to levels last seen before the bad actors caused a market-wide sell-off during 2022.\n\nBitcoin is clearly positioning itself as a flight from FIAT in a world where global currencies are potentially in serious jeopardy. Of course, there are multiple moving parts, some historically correlated and some not, but 2023 is undoubtedly set to be an interesting experiment in how Bitcoin performs amid further global economic uncertainty."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s daily trading session closed above $17,000 for the first time in almost a month on Sunday, following a favorable showing in US equities to close out last week.\n\nThe crypto, which is currently changing hands for around $17,200 per bitcoin, has been met by a modest amount of daily trading volume on major exchanges, and an uptick in volatility \u2014 which has been at historic lows. [indicating the relief rally could be short-lived.]\n\nMost cryptos in the top 20 have followed suit, with cardano and solana the largest gainers \u2014 rising more than 19% and 20% respectively over the past 24 hours. Solana saw a return of speculators last week chasing the latest dog-inspired meme coin, BONK.\n\nBitcoin is now trading at levels not seen since Dec. 13 where it jumped 3.5% on the day to reach a peak of $18,373 a day later. The crypto succumbed to a large sell-off on Dec. 15, courtesy of the current bear market climate and sell-side pressure.\n\n\u201cOver the course of last week, we saw increased passive liquidity \u2014 as displayed by deeper order books and tightening bid/ask spreads mid-week,\u201d Kurt Grumelart, special projects lead at trading firm Zerocap told Blockworks.\n\nGrumelart said the outperformance in various subsectors of the crypto market was helping to drive key narratives and prop up prices. Those include liquid staking derivatives, which have experienced \u201csubstantial rallies\u201d in anticipation of a first-quarter launch of Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade that will enable withdrawals of staked ether.\n\nDeFi-related assets exhibited marginal growth alongside a jump in the industry\u2019s overall market capitalization, which grew 3.3% on Sunday to $885 billion.\n\nSitting within the top 10 of Messari\u2019s DeFi assets category, Curve (CRV) and Maker (MKR) have witnessed growth over a 24-hour period, up 15.7% and 9% respectively. A general shift away from centralized entities to decentralized ones, following the blowout of FTX, are helping to drive up value in the sector, Clearpool CEO Rob Alcorn told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cAn entire generation of crypto products and protocols will be defined by their ability to survive last year\u2019s stress tests and re-emerge as critical pieces of market infrastructure to lead a more compliant industry into the next bull market,\u201d Alcorn said.\n\nUS equities and the broader markets rally ahead of bitcoin\n\nBuoyed by speculation of easing interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve, traders looked to signs of cooling wage growth and a contraction in services activity as a primary motivator.\n\nAnticipation is now building over a tapering of the Fed\u2019s future rate hikes from 50 basis points to around 25 basis points to be declared at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting by month\u2019s end.\n\nUS equities had their best daily showing in more than a month on Friday with the S&P500 rising 2.3% to 3,895 while the Dow Jones Industrial was up 2.1% to 33,630. That represented the largest daily gains for US equities since Nov. 30 \u2014 37 days ago.\n\nSo far, Asian shares have reacted positively to the favorable US moves, with Australia\u2019s ASX index rising 0.6% to 7,153, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index also up 0.6% to 25,973, and in Europe the German DAX opening up 0.3% in the first hour of Monday trading.\n\nCoupled with better-than-expected nonfarm payroll figures (NPF), which measures the US labor force minus farmers and some other sectors, the macro environment has led to an increased bid in risk assets like crypto, Grumelart said.\n\n\u201cConsidering these drivers, the digital asset space is positioned to capitalize on a more favorable start to the year from a macro front,\u201d he said. Though considerable challenges to the market, including the conclusion to the FTX debacle, will likely suppress prices in the short term.\n\nStill hanging over the market, Damocles\u2019 sword-style, however, is the ongoing uncertainty over Digital Currency Group, and its subsidiaries, Genesis and Grayscale.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

However, the global Bitcoin ATM network, which used to add thousands of machines each month in 2021, recorded a net addition of just 94 Bitcoin ATMs over the past six months since July 2022.\n\nA year-long bear market in 2022 \u2014 accompanied by geopolitical tensions and global inflation \u2014 hindered various initiatives aiding the growth of the entire crypto ecosystem.

        "content": "Cryptocurrency has been on a wild ride lately from soaring highs to crushing lows to the recent implosion of FTX, the world\u2019s third-largest crypto currency exchange. But one thing that hasn\u2019t changed? If you trade, sell, exchange, or get rid of cryptocurrency for a gain, you\u2019ll owe taxes on it.\n\nThat\u2019s because, tax-wise, the IRS doesn\u2019t treat cryptocurrency like cash, but as property. Similar to stocks, the value of cryptocurrency can increase or decrease over time.\n\n\u201cWith cash, if you have a $10 bill at the beginning of the year, barring slight changes for inflation or cost of living, it will still be worth $10 at the end of the year,\" said Helena Swyter, a certified public accountant and owner of Sweeter CPA in Chicago. \"But if you purchased $10 worth of cryptocurrency, it could be worth a lot more or a lot less than that in a year.\u201d\n\nThose fluctuations become gains or losses once you sell or exchange the cryptocurrency, at which point they can be taxable, and the IRS is going to want to know about them on Form 1040, your federal income tax return form.\n\nNew this year is the addition of a specific digital assets section on the 1040 form, named broadly enough to include not just cryptocurrency, but also non-fungible tokens. In this section is a question that asks: \u201cAt any time during 2022, did you receive (as a reward, award, or payment for property or services); or sell, exchange, gift, or otherwise dispose of a digital asset (or a financial interest in a digital asset)?\u201d\n\nCredit: Getty Images (Westend61 via Getty Images)\n\nHow to track crypto transactions\n\nBecause you have to report your cryptocurrency gains and losses to the IRS, you need a good system to keep track of them. First, check with the brokerage or exchange you use to buy or sell cryptocurrency to see if it has tracking capabilities you can use or access, Swyter said. If not, use an app, tax reporting software, or a spreadsheet to track the information on your own, she said.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to track:\n\nHow much in dollars you spent to buy the cryptocurrency\n\nThe date you bought or received the cryptocurrency\n\nThe date you sold or exchanged the cryptocurrency\n\nHow much the coins were worth in dollars on the date you sold them\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you sell cryptocurrency coins for less than what you paid for them, that\u2019s a loss. You don\u2019t pay taxes on the losses. You can offset cryptocurrency capital gains with losses of up to $3,000, according to the IRS. If you have more than that amount in losses, you can carry it forward to future years.\n\n\u201cBut if you later sold cryptocurrency for more than its purchase price, that\u2019s a taxable gain,\u201d Swyter said. \u201cThis gain is taxed at short- or long-term capital gains rates, depending on how long you owned it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to know the dates you bought and sold your cryptocurrency. Some cryptocurrency exchanges will send you a 1099-B or a 1099-K form near the end of January. The 1099-B shows your gains or losses from selling cryptocurrency, while the 1099-K shows your proceeds. A 1099-B is more useful for figuring out how much you owe for taxes, but not every exchange sends these out. If they do, they may only send to certain people who made many or larger transactions. So it\u2019s a good idea to keep your own records.\n\nNFT non fungible token. Credit: Getty Images (Adrian Vidal via Getty Images)\n\nHow to report crypto gains and losses\n\nTo figure out a loss or gain, look at how much you paid for the cryptocurrency \u2014 including fees \u2014 and subtract it from the selling price. If the number is negative, that\u2019s a loss. If it\u2019s positive, that\u2019s a profit.\n\nIf you owned the cryptocurrency for one year or less before you sold or exchanged it, it\u2019s taxed as a short-term gain or loss, which is taxed at the ordinary income tax rate. If you held it for a year or more before you sold or exchanged it, it\u2019s calculated as a long-term capital gain or loss.\n\nThose are taxed at the more favorable long-term capital gains tax rate, based on your tax bracket.\n\nMany people\u2019s experiences with cryptocurrency is through coins they\u2019ve bought that are held in a brokerage account, Swyter said. But if you received other types of income in cryptocurrency, you need to report those, too.\n\n\u201cIf you earned interest from a cryptocurrency bank that needs to be converted to U.S. dollars when you receive it, report it the same way you would from a traditional bank,\u201d Swyter said. The same goes if someone paid you for a service in cryptocurrency, she added.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve calculated your gains and losses \u2014 and determined whether they were short- or long-term capital gains \u2014 you\u2019re ready to fill out the required tax forms.\n\nIf you\u2019re reporting both short-and long-term gains and losses, fill out tax Form 8949. After that, you should also fill out and file a regular income tax form, Form 1040 (Schedule D), which includes a space to summarize your transactions from Form 8949. If you\u2019ve done a good job with your record keeping, your work should be done.\n\nKate Rockwood is a freelance writer and editor.\n\nClick here for the latest economic news and economic indicators to help you in your investing decisions\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or Android\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube."

        "title": "Belgian MP receives Bitcoin salary for a year: Here's what he learned - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "At the end of January 2022, member of the Belgian parliament Christophe De Beukelaer became the first European politician to convert his salary to Bitcoin (BTC). Celebrating the anniversary of this experiment, Cointelegraph reached out to a lawmaker to know more about his experience.\n\nBack in 2022, Beukelaer, who represents Humanist Democratic Centre (CDH) party, cited the example of New York City Mayor Eric Adams and how American politicians are working to make their native states or cities Bitcoin hubs to justify his decision. The Brussels MP\u2019s monthly salary of 5,500 euros ($6,140) was to be converted to Bitcoin using the Bit4You crypto trading platform.\n\nRelated: Belgium says BTC, ETH and other decentralized coins are not securities\n\n\u201cI did this political act of paying in Bitcoin to defend political ideas,\u201d shared Beukelaer, citing four ones: defending financial freedom and economic opportunity and combating financial illiteracy and growth model. The last one is perhaps the most interesting, as the lawmaker, who called himself a \u201cpragmatic environmentalist,\u201d sees a clear link between Bitcoin and the environmental clause:\n\n\u201cWhat does the central bank do when it prints money as it has done in recent years? It gives the illusion of infinite resources and thus encourages all economic actors to produce and consume more and more.\u201d\n\nBeukelaer considered his experiment successful in both putting Belgium on the global crypto map and encouraging local officials to educate themselves on digital assets:\n\n\u201cA lot of politicians said to themselves: \u2018De Beukelaer is not an anarchist. If he is interested in Bitcoin, there must be something interesting behind it.\u2019\u201d\n\nWas it comfortable in practical terms? The positive answer is hardly imaginable, given the BTC\u2019s decline from almost $38,000 in January 2022 to $17,246 at the time of publication in January 2023, but the MP didn\u2019t regard his experiment as an economic strategy from the very beginning:\n\n\u201cIt was a political act and not a financial gesture. Like those who grow mustaches in November to fight prostate cancer. I put this salary in Bitcoin on a cold wallet every month and I haven't touched it. My goal was not to live in crypto.\u201d\n\nWhile the first major step to pan-European regulation is undertaken, Beukelaer highlighted the reservations of the Markets in Crypto-assets legislation: The excessive constraints imposed on the personal holding of crypto or the way stablecoins are considered.\n\nEurope is heading toward hard times, the politician believes, citing the crises in energy supply and climate, and the rise of authoritarian leaders. It is in that regard how Western countries will gradually understand the usefulness of crypto."

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst is warning of an elephant in the room that could trigger another sell-off event for king crypto Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIn a new strategy session, Nicholas Merten, the host of DataDash, tells his 512,000 YouTube subscribers that dormant sell-side pressure from the Mt. Gox debacle may rear its head and cause another leg down for the top crypto asset by market cap.\n\n\u201cThere is a question we need to ask, as to whether or not the Mt. Gox trust is going to [cause the price of BTC to dip], or more specifically, what\u2019s more relevant is whether or not the long-awaited unloading of this Bitcoin back to its original holders is going to happen due to pressure from those holders to be able to finally get access to that Bitcoin.\n\nThe second question is whether or not the sell-off from that is going to be the bottom, because as we saw during that last bull market, the [Mt. Gox\u2019s BTC] holdings not even dropped in half. It dropped from around 200,000 to 137,000 [BTC]. If we see this kind of sell pressure or in this case unloading of Bitcoin into the supply in the open market, what is that going to mean for price?\u201d\n\nMt. Gox is a defunct crypto exchange that was based in Japan. It went bankrupt in 2014 after being hacked. In July 2022, it was announced that it will be repaying former customers as part of its bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nMerten says that the payment of BTC to Mt. Gox\u2019s former clients could be an immense source of sell-side liquidity.\n\n\u201cI think it is going to mean a brutal amount of sell-side pressure. People who have had Bitcoin since back when it was double, triple digits, just a couple dozen dollars, or a couple hundred bucks, and they\u2019re going to want to start to take profit because they feel that Bitcoin as an asset is done for.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is changing hands for $17,195 at time of writing.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Bitcoin fundamentals remain unchanged despite the significant events in 2022 - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The year 2022 marked the start of a new crypto winter, with major crypto companies collapsing and digital currency prices plummeting, including Bitcoin.\n\nIn addition, interest rate increases and general economic negativity are causing investors to worry.\n\nThe fundamentals of Bitcoin remain strong despite all of these. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the Bitcoin metrics for the year 2022:\n\nBitcoin Circulating Supply\n\nThe circulating supply of Bitcoin currently stands at 19,257,175 \u2013 91.7% of the capped maximum supply of 21 million coins. Now, there are 1,742,825 left to be mined before the limit of 21 million bitcoins is reached.\n\nAn average of one bitcoin block is created every 10 minutes, so Bitcoin\u2019s supply is increasing approximately every 10 minutes.\n\nHowever, despite a severe market downturn, including miner capitulation and forced liquidation, defi platform hacks, Bitcoin has largely maintained consistent 10-minute block times IN 2022.\n\nBitcoin miner\u2019s block reward\n\nTwo components constitute bitcoin block rewards: newly created coins and transaction fees. When they successfully validate blocks on the network, the reward is given to miners.\n\nThe number of newly generated coins is regulated by a halving event that occurs roughly every four years. The Bitcoin halving event reduces the supply of new bitcoins by half and aims to ensure that all 21 million bitcoins have been mined.\n\nDespite moving all their BTC to different addresses, the newly generated Bitcoin currently stands at 900/day this halving, and the reward for each block is $6.3 BTC.\n\nWhile block rewards are stable and predictable, transaction fees can fluctuate depending on multiple factors, such as network activity and transaction size.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Average Transaction Fee was $0.834 on Dec.31, a decrease from last year\u2019s high of 2.829 \u2013 a change of 70.5%.\n\nThis fall is primarily due to increasing network difficulty, heavy computational demand, and poor market performance.\n\nBlock height\n\nThe block height stood at 573.296k as of December 31. The blocks created per day remained constant despite the miner\u2019s revenue touching new lows.\n\nEvery blockchain consists of a series of sequential blocks, with the first block referred to as the genesis block. The genesis block is considered to be in block height zero. As a general rule, the blockchain\u2019s total height equals the height of the most recent block.\n\nAs the block height continues, Bitcoin still has more than 99% uptime, currently sitting at 99.987%.\n\nBitcoin mining difficulty\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Bitcoin mining difficulty stood at 35.36 trillion, up from 24.27 trillion one year back.\n\nThis figure represents the amount of computing power applied to mining this particular cryptocurrency every 14 days based on the amount of hashing power competing for rewards on the network.\n\nA greater mining difficulty indicates that more miners are trying to obtain this cryptocurrency. Hashing refers to the amount of processing power that PCs use to build the blockchain: the more blocks of verified transactions are processed, the more bitcoin is mined. Despite a volatile market and a blizzard last month, mining difficulty adjusted every 2016 block."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price has initiated a rally after finding solid support at around $16.5K and breaking the 50-day moving average. However, the bullish momentum has weakened as the price faces a critical resistance level.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nAfter a short-term consolidation at the $16.5K support level, the price has finally started an uptrend and surpassed the 50-day moving average, which was serving as substantial resistance during the last few months.\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps safe to say that this latest rally was somewhat expected as the moving average was surpassed. however, the positive momentum seems to be on a pause, and the price now faces the 100 DMA that\u2019s located at around $17.9K as the next important target.\n\nIf Bitcoin moves beyond the aforementioned level, a move toward the multi-month descending wedge\u2019s upper trendline becomes more likely.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nIn the 4-hour timeframe, a double-bottom reversal pattern can be seen at the $16.5K level. After breaking the neckline, the price has been forming higher highs and higher lows and reached the Fibonacci retracement level of 0.5. The region between the 0.5-0.618 Fibonacci levels is regarded as a significant resistance zone in the correction stages of the market. In light of this, the cryptocurrency is currently facing a vital resistance zone and is attempting to surpass it.\n\nYet, the bullish momentum is not very promising. A rejection followed by a short-term consolidation stage between the $16.5K support and the $17.5K resistance level could be a possible outcome.\n\nOnchain Analysis\n\nThe Exchange Reserve metric represents the total number of coins held in exchanges. A considerable surge in the metric typically indicates higher selling pressure and has been indicative of a trend reversal overall.\n\nAs the chart depicts, a slight recovery can be observed right before each substantial price crash during the recent significant bearish market stage from the $69K all-time high to the $15K low. This might signify people are sending their Bitcoins to exchanges to distribute.\n\nThe metric is recovering slightly after the price broke a vital resistance region and started increasing. The big players might consider this recent rally a selling opportunity to realize their profits before further crashes. If so, the market could potentially face another bearish leg in the mid-term."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nShares in the troubled Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) surged on Monday, narrowing its discount from Bitcoin.\n\nThe price for the OTC-traded security jumped 11.56% yesterday, to $9.65. This brought the trust\u2019s discount against the net asset value (NAV) of its Bitcoin holdings to 38.55%, the smallest gap since mid-November.\n\nGBTC is a publicly-listed financial vehicle that gives investors exposure to Bitcoin without needing to buy and hold the asset physically. The trust had historically traded at a premium to Bitcoin but has, since late February 2022, been stuck at a hefty discount.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe uptick in its price comes despite a myriad of problems facing both the investment firm behind the trust and its parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG).\n\nGrayscale\u2019s discount woes\n\nGrayscale is the largest holder of Bitcoin in the world after the cryptocurrency\u2019s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nIt owns 643,572 Bitcoin, according to treasuries listings, the equivalent of $11.1 billion.\n\nThe GBTC discount emerged due to market volatility and shareholders' inability to redeem their shares.\n\nGrayscale has looked to convert the trust into a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), a structure that its CEO Michael Sonnenshein argues would provide better protection for investors.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut like every other entity which has applied to launch a Bitcoin ETF in the U.S., the company has been shot down by regulators. Last June, Grayscale filed a lawsuit against the SEC after it again rejected the firm's spot Bitcoin ETF application.\n\nCompetition from crypto ETFs in other countries such as Canada, as well as U.S.-traded Bitcoin futures ETFs, may also, therefore, be contributing to the discount.\n\nGrayscale under fire from investors\n\nBecause Grayscale does not offer a way to redeem their shares, GBTC holders have begun to put pressure on the firm to change their rules and introduce some form of liquidity.\n\nOn one front, the trust is facing a lawsuit accusing it of \u201cpotential mismanagement and conflicts of interest,\u201d filed by New York hedge fund Fir Tree Capital Management.\n\nOn another, rival investment firm Valkyrie has put forward a proposal to become the new sponsor and manager of GBTC. The idea is that GBTC shareholders could vote for a change of management, though there are some doubts over whether this would even be possible.\n\nMeanwhile, Grayscale\u2019s parent company DCG has become embroiled in a public spat with Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss. In a letter to DCG founder Barry Silbert sent last week, he set a deadline of January 8 to \u201cpublicly commit to working together\u201d to solve the problem of the $900 million that Genesis, another DCG portfolio company, owes Gemini Earn.\n\nIn the letter, he also accused DGC of borrowing almost $1.7 billion from Genesis, its own subsidiary.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSilbert denied this on Twitter, adding that DCG had never missed an interest payment to Genesis."

The main reason for the rebound in MicroStrategy's share price is also obviously because of the \"post-Santa rally\" that emerged in the crypto market in early 2023.\n\nAt the same time, MSTR falls and rises harder than Bitcoin itself, and on top of that experiences all the negative factors of traditional finance and the current monetary policy of the U.S. Federal Reserve. Add to that the fact that some cryptocurrency has been purchased on loan, and each increase in the Fed's rate makes the cost of that loan more expensive."

        "title": "5 signs that an altcoin bull run could be underway - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "While 2022 ended on a grim note with macro headwinds providing little hope of a revival in 2023, the start of a new year has surprised bears with a surge in Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and altcoin prices. The period of sparse volatility in the crypto market appears to be ending with a breakout to the upside.\n\nThe increase has been particularly striking in some altcoins such as Lido (LIDO), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). The primary factors promoting the spike in these coins are the upcoming Ethereum Shanghai update (for LIDO) and the negative funding rate in the futures market, especially for SOL. The negative rates implies that most traders are holding short positions, giving an opportunity for whale buyers to run their stop losses. Funding rates for some other tokens remain exposed to a short squeeze.\n\nMoreover, the new year has also seen the re-emergence of the degen gambling that had taken a back seat after the collapse of FTX in November. A memecoin price surge is evidence of the residual degen spirit. Technically, the total market capitalization of altcoins has surpassed a key technical resistance level as bullish momentum builds.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the bull run is questionable due to the broader trend remaining bearish, the fledgling uptrend could still bring some pain for late sellers. The five primary factors influencing altcoin prices are:\n\nJob market data revives the hope of a soft landing\n\nDefying Dow Jones estimates for an additional 200,000 nonfarm payrolls added in December and market expectations of a slowdown, the labor market report showed tha230,000 were added, a 0.2% increase in employment.\n\nA strong jobs market goes against the prevalent recession claims and acts as a catalyst for a risk-on rally. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading for December coming out on Jan. 12 will be instrumental in either building on the newfound bullish sentiment or returning to negative sentiments.\n\nIf inflation continued its downtrend, with December\u2019s CPI print below 7.7%, then the market's confidence in a soft landing could increase. However, if inflation rose in December, then the chances of a higher rate hike in the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting toward the end of January increase, risking a steep correction.\n\nTraders hunt for perpetual swaps with negative funding rates\n\nAs the spot trading volume and liquidity on cryptocurrency exchanges dried up toward the year-end, especially during the holiday season, futures markets gained more influence in moving the prices. A contrarian price reaction against a crowded trade position is highly likely.\n\nSolana's latest surge in prices is clear evidence of short-squeeze driving prices. Over the weekend, $200 million in SOL shorts were liquidated as its price surged over 27% from the Jan. 6 low of $13. According to independent market analyst Alex Kruger, \u201cSOL still has room to go but the outperformance phase is mostly behind.\u201d\n\nFunding rate for SOL perpetual swaps. Source: Coinglass\n\nWhile Solana\u2019s pump might be close to over, the majority of traders are still net short on numerous altcoins like Apecoin (APE), Tron (TRX), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Gala Games (GALA). This provides an opportunity for buyers to push the price up and hunt the stop-loss liquidity of perpetual swap sellers.\n\nFunding rate for altcoins across crypto exchanges. Source: Coinglass\n\nMeme coins pump, then dump\n\nIn the first week of January, a Solana-based memecoin named BONK experienced a whopping 25x surge. The rise symbolized the degenerate gambling spirit that was prevalent during the 2021 to 2022 bull run. Bear markets, on the other hand, tend to promote caution among traders.\n\nDespite BONK\u2019s eventual price collapse, the successful pump-and-dump playout of meme coins like it suggest that some traders are still indulging in high-risk plays.\n\nBONK price chart. Source: CoinGecko\n\nPositive technical breakout\n\nThe altcoin market capitalization broke above the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $465 billion. Buyers will likely target the 100-day EMA at $563 billion \u2014 an expected average 20% gain across the tokens. Technical traders would look to tap these key levels before reversal begins.\n\nThe relative strength indicator (RSI) for altcoin market capitalization also moved into bullish territory, increasing above the 60-point resistance. Furthermore, if buyers build support above the 50-day EMA with positive volumes, the short-term uptrend could extend toward the end of Q1 2023.\n\nTotal altcoin market capitalization (excluding Bitcoin). Source: TradingView\n\nHistorical trends and positive sentiment spike\n\nThe sustainability of the bullish altcoin run is questionable, especially since the underlying trend remains bearish. It\u2019s difficult to identify the fundamental catalyst supporting this bull run, and Bitcoin\u2019s price trades below its resistance of between $18,200 and $19,000. Thus, the uptrend will likely fade as buyers get exhausted.\n\nIf we look at previous crypto cycles, altcoins outperformed Bitcoin in a bull run, and the following cooldown period saw a cross-over with Bitcoin leading the crypto market gains.\n\nThe recent parabolic run of 2021 played out similarly, with altcoins outperforming Bitcoin. However, the correction period hasn\u2019t seen a wipeout of the altcoin market relative to Bitcoin.\n\nBoth altcoin market capitalization and Bitcoin\u2019s price have lost 75% of their value from the peak, as opposed to altcoin losses surpassing Bitcoin.\n\nAltcoins outperform Bitcoin during bull markets. Source: TradingView\n\nAn exception to the above rule can be due to Ether\u2019s increasing dominance in the market. Ethereum has maintained its market dominance of around 20% with technical breakthroughs such as the shift to an energy-friendly proof-of-stake mechanism and reduced inflation supporting its price strongly despite the negative trend. Still, a deeper correction in the broader altcoin market capitalization cannot be ruled out.\n\nBitcoin (orange) and Ethereum (blue) dominance over the crypto market. Source: TradingView\n\nLately, social media circles have witnessed a revival of positive sentiment. Santiment data shows that the social media mentions of keywords like \u201cbuy the dip\u201d and \u201cbottom\u201d spiked on platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Telegram. Usually, a positive sentiment spike is a top indicator suggesting a reversal of the bullish price trend.\n\nSocial media volume for \u201cbuy the dip\u201d and \u201cbottom\u201d key words. Source: Santiment\n\nOne of the first hurdles will be supporting the price after a wipeout of short orders. Being two of the first tokens to surge, Solana and Cardano could provide clues that point toward the end of the uptrend.\n\nIf the price of SOL breaks below support at $14.33 with a simultaneous drop below $0.30 for ADA, it could be a warning sign of the bull\u2019s exhaustion.\n\nAt the same time, tokens like LIDO that benefit from the liquid staking derivative narrative could continue to rise until Ethereum core developers implement the Shanghai upgrade. Macro market movers such as the CPI print and Bitcoin\u2019s price action will also play a crucial role in sustaining an altcoin bull run.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Why Riot Platforms Is Absolutely Skyrocketing Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nAmid a sea of green in most cryptocurrencies and crypto-adjacent stocks today, it's hard to find any asset that's not seeing significant gains. However, among the biggest winners in today's session is crypto miner Riot Platforms (RIOT -1.36%). As of 2:45 p.m. ET, RIOT stock has rocketed 15.4%, among the leaders in the tech-heavy Nasdaq.\n\nThis move appears to be driven by a number of key factors. The price of Bitcoin (BTC 2.49%) has continued to move higher, appreciating 2.3% over the past 24 hours. For Bitcoin miners such as Riot, this is a key fundamental metric, which is typically the directional driver for price movements on a given day.\n\nAdditionally, a relatively strong operational update provided by Riot last week has provided investors with reason to take a risk-on position with this company. Riot reported 55% year-over-year growth in terms of total Bitcoin production, as well as some nominal Bitcoin sales to fund operations.\n\nFinally, the company's corporate rebranding (from Riot Blockchain to Riot Platforms) has intrigued some investors. That's because within the rebranding press release, Riot noted its strategic shift to focusing on various vertical opportunities to support growth over the long term, in areas such as electrical equipment manufacturing and data center facilities.\n\nSo what\n\nRiot's fundamentals, which looked sharp for most of 2021 as Bitcoin prices remained elevated, have begun to deteriorate. The company is seeing quarterly losses swell, and while Riot has put up $0.11 of earnings per share for the trailing 12 months, it's likely that we'll see a negative number in that spot after the company's upcoming earnings report.\n\nAccordingly, this is a stock that's seen outsized interest from short sellers, and for good reason. While some retail investors may be looking for a beaten-down short squeeze to go after to play this rally, it remains to be seen how sustainable today's move in RIOT stock will be a week or two from now.\n\nNow what\n\nAs a Bitcoin miner, Riot's ability to produce consistent profitability really depends on whether the price of Bitcoin can stabilize, and preferably rise, to previous levels. At around $17,000 apiece, the long-term profitability of Bitcoin mining remains in serious question. Thus, this is a highly risky bet for those with a less-than-stellar outlook for the world's largest cryptocurrency.\n\nThat said, in many ways, Riot represents a very high-beta vehicle for investors to play a bullish stance on crypto. Given the outsized impact rising Bitcoin prices has on Riot's income statement, should we see a rally materialize, this is a stock that could actually outperform the crypto itself.\n\nGiven the inherent volatility of Bitcoin (which I think is enough for most investors), Riot is a company that doesn't entice me here. That said, it's easy to see why so many investors are enticed by this beaten-down name right now."

What does this mean? It means that they aren\u2019t authorized to manage member funds. Therefore, this software has established a partnership with licensed and regulated brokers.\n\nAt this juncture, brokers act as financial entities. In this way, those who are collaborating on the platform can receive deposits made by users and facilitate their commercial activities.

However, it has not been possible to verify these figures.\n\nBitcoin Buyer has direct cooperation with regulated and licensed online brokers. These brokers have all the tools at their disposal to protect users from any scams while offering fast trades. Despite this, it is crucial to note that any business carries its risks. Therefore, it is advisable not to invest more money than you are willing to lose. Such a recommendation is vital for cryptocurrency trading due to the constant volatility that hovers in these markets.\n\nBy all signals, Bitcoin Buyer appears to be totally legitimate. However, you should be aware that this trading software does not remove the risks involved in cryptocurrency trading at all.\n\nBitcoin Buyer App\n\nA significant disadvantage for traders who tend to trade through mobile platforms is that there is no Bitcoin Buyer mobile application.

        "title": "Poilievre opts into 241.8% inflation | Canada's National Observer: Climate News - Canada's National Observer",
        "content": "Conservative Opposition Leader Pierre Poilievre has not been content just to blame the Trudeau government for allowing inflation to rise to levels not seen in Canada since the 1980s. He also offered Canadians a prescription for coping with inflation until he is elected prime minister by using Bitcoin and other digital tokens known as cryptocurrencies. As early as September 2021, then-finance critic Poilievre touted \u201cdigital currencies \u2026 giving people an opportunity to protect themselves against inflation.\u201d Six months later, as a Conservative Party of Canada leadership candidate, he doubled down. At a campaign event at a restaurant, Poilievre bought a shawarma with Bitcoin and extolled \u201cthe freedom to use other money, such as Bitcoin\u2026 Choice and competition can give Canadians better money and \u2026 let Canadians opt out of inflation with the ability to opt into cryptocurrencies.\u201d Unfortunately for Poilievre, Bitcoin and other crypto tokens have crashed in value over the past year. National Observer columnist Max Fawcett noted that Bitcoin users experienced price rises verging on hyperinflation after Poilievre\u2019s call to \u201copt out of inflation with \u2026 crypto.\u201d To buy the same shawarma today, Poilievre would fork over more than double his March Bitcoin payment. The number of Bitcoins needed to pay for groceries, fuel, rent and all the other items in Statistics Canada\u2019s Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 241.8 per cent from November 2021 to November 2022. And 13.3 per cent inflation over just one month for Bitcoin users was higher than the 6.8 per cent annual inflation rate of prices in Canadian dollars, a currency Poilievre has dismissed as \u201cinferior,\u201d \u201cincreasingly worthless\u201d and \u201cruined.\u201d Poilievre\u2019s cure for inflation turned out worse than the disease. How did he go so far wrong? Poilievre fell under the spell of online crypto gurus promoting Bitcoin as a superior alternative to Milton Friedman\u2019s work seeking a monetary framework to guarantee price stability.\n\nIn a 2014 interview, Poilievre revealed that his political philosophy was formed as a teenager when he read Friedman\u2019s Capitalism and Freedom. There is no surprise that a future Conservative Party leader would cite the conservative thinker as an influencer. Poilievre\u2019s intellectual journey has since taken him from Friedman to Bitcoin evangelists such as Robert Breedlove and Saifedean Ammous. According to Ammous, Bitcoin can ensure price stability because annual supply growth is limited by design to less than two per cent, thereby providing a psychological anchor. How could prices measured in Bitcoins rise 241.8 per cent over the past year when their supply grew less than two per cent? The problem is that while the supply of Bitcoins is stable and predictable, the demand is not. Fighting wildfires \u2014 and misinformation Poilievre has lectured the House of Commons on \u201cwhat is money?\u201d but has not read Friedman carefully enough to know that neither Bitcoin nor any other crypto token fits the three-pronged definition of money used by almost all monetary policy analysts. Very few buyers and sellers use Bitcoin as a medium of exchange to complete transactions. Nor is Bitcoin a unit of account for keeping track of relative values in Canada\u2019s economy. Retail prices and salaries in help wanted ads are rarely posted in Bitcoin. No one talks about his or her annual income or property value in numbers of Bitcoins. Some owners believe that Bitcoin is still a good long-term investment. But, 2022 was not the first year when Bitcoin plunged in value. It is too volatile to be a reliable store of value for preserving wealth and buying power over time."

        "content": "The HODL strategy is a long-term investment approach that involves holding onto Bitcoin for an extended period of time rather than selling it. The term \u201cHODL\u201d is a play on the word \u201chold\u201d and was coined by a drunken Bitcoiner who misspelled \u201chold\u201d as \u201chodl\u201d in a forum post titled \u201cI AM HODLING.\u201d Advocates of the HODL strategy\u2014HODLERs\u2014argue that Bitcoin has the potential to significantly increase in value over time and that holding onto it for the long term is the best way to maximize returns.\n\nBSVSearch.com conducted a poll on Twitter asking people what stops them from using and spending BSVs. Of the participants, 35% said they are waiting for the exchange rate of BSV to reach a more favorable level before spending, while 45% said there are not enough merchants and businesses accepting BSVs. Entrepreneurs, business owners, retailers, wholesalers, and developers are therefore encouraged to accept BSVs in exchange for goods and services to allow BSV users around the world to do business with them. The remaining 20% of poll participants said they just want to HODL their BSVs.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the idea of HODLing and argue why it is important for everyone, especially HODLERs, to use BSVs in order to help the BSV economy grow and increase the value of their BSVs.\n\nThe HODL strategy assumes that the value of Bitcoin will increase over time. However, there is no guarantee that this will happen. As we have learned in a previous article, if the demand for Bitcoin does not increase, the price could go down.\n\nThere is renewed hope for Bitcoin with the restoration of its original protocol on BitcoinSV (BSV). This was made possible by the persistent insistence of Craig Wright, who claimed that the original protocol had everything needed for Bitcoin to be used as a global cash system. As it turns out, Wright, who is known to be the inventor of Bitcoin under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, was right. BSV can now process 100,000 transactions per second with low fees anywhere in the world instantly. The low fees also allow for small transactions under $5 to be made with minimal transaction costs. Many people in developing countries, where average daily earnings and transactions are less than $5, have never had access to an electronic payment system. With BSV, they can now enjoy the privilege of digital money that people in more developed countries have had for decades.\n\nMany of us understand the potential impact that Bitcoin can have on the world due to its ability to reduce transaction costs and facilitate the efficient transfer of value and data across the globe at the speed of the Internet. That\u2019s why many of us have been earning satoshis or buying BSV. It\u2019s an investment in our future that rewards us for recognizing the potential of BSV to transform the world. However, this transformation won\u2019t happen if we, as individuals, do not participate in the BSV economy and only HODL. It\u2019s important to remember that regardless of how many satoshis or BSV you have, none of them will be worth anything if BSV fails to be adopted and used globally.\n\nWe cannot simply stand by and watch Craig Wright fight the enemies of the real Bitcoin in costly, time-consuming, and emotional court cases. We cannot continue to be passive spectators while Calvin Ayre, nChain, and the Bitcoin Association work to educate businesses and governments on how Bitcoin can help them reduce costs and become more productive and efficient. We cannot simply hope that some team in the near future will create a \u201ckiller app\u201d or the next \u201cunicorn\u201d to catalyze the massive migration towards using BSV.\n\nIf you want the value of the BSVs you hold to rise in the future, understand that this can only happen if the BSV economy grows. It only grows if everyday people like you and I contribute to this economy by actually using, spending, and receiving BSVs. The best way to do this is to buy BSVs and spend it on things you usually would have paid for in fiat. So instead of paying fiat currency directly for a product or a service, you buy BSVs and use that BSV to pay for that product or service. You are not worse off, but you have now injected value into the BSV economy. Little transactions like this, multiplied by many individuals around the world, will lead to sustained growth that creates an environment where massive surges of BSV adoption can happen. The impact of millions of transactions\u2014no matter how small\u2014will eventually add to a gargantuan expansion of the BSV global economy. It all begins with you.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nMarquez Comelab has launched BSVSearch.com, an exciting initiative that connects businesses accepting BSVs with consumers around the world. It\u2019s a place where individuals and businesses can also sell goods and services priced in BSVs, expanding the choices for BSV shoppers and driving growth for the BSV economy.\n\nWatch: The BSV Global Blockchain Convention presentation, Domineum: Better Government & Enterprise Applications with BSV\n\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "title": "Faketoshi Series (Hal Finney): The men who are not Satoshi\u2014Part 3 - CoinGeek",
        "content": "Who is Satoshi Nakamoto? The pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin was a mystery to the computer science and cryptography world for many years. While Dr. Craig Wright was doxed as Bitcoin\u2019s creator by Wired and Gizmodo in 2015, the politics of Bitcoin have muddied the waters and made a rational discussion of the facts very difficult to have with a mainstream audience. Since then, the term \u201cFaketoshi\u201d has become ubiquitous with anyone who makes personal claims about the muddied history of Bitcoin and Satoshi Nakamoto. This is largely because of the perverse incentives of wealth that have been created in the gray areas where the truth hasn\u2019t shined a light, and this article aims to clarify what it means to be a Faketoshi in 2023.\n\nThe small blocker BTC crowd holds a deeply political view about the nature of the Bitcoin protocol and its governance, and therefore gives a lot of weight to candidates who agree principally with their view of permanently small blocks, UASF governance (User Activated Soft Fork), and an ethos of \u201ccode-is-law\u201d from the cypherpunk community. While some candidates, like Dave Kleiman, have been proven in court not to have helped create Bitcoin, a great deal of populist candidates still get brought up regularly.\n\nWe previously discussed why Nick Szabo and Adam Back\u2019s reputations as maybe being Satoshi fall apart, and how they have benefited tremendously from the ambiguity that they maintain on the subject.\n\nIn this article, we will see the exact opposite from Hal Finney: a man who has exponentially more right than Szabo or Back to take credit for early contributions to Bitcoin, yet benefited from it substantially less because of his humility and a terrible misfortune.\n\nEveryone\u2019s favorite\n\nHal Finney seems, by all accounts, to have been a very nice, kind, hard-working person. He was a universally well-liked member of the Bitcoin community from week one, and he fit the profile of what the earliest bitcoiners assumed Satoshi Nakamoto should have looked like. In fact, the more a good man reads about Hal Finney, the more a good man should be inspired to be a good man too!\n\nHe was a politically minded, but non-combative libertarian, a cypherpunk activist, member of various cryptography and cypherpunk forums and mailing lists, and he was an avid coder with big opinions about digital cash and cryptography. He was also probably the second miner on the network\u2014joining at some point in the block height between 70-80 and announcing it on twitter with the first Bitcoin tweet in history.\n\nRunning bitcoin \u2014 halfin (@halfin) January 11, 2009\n\nHal even worked in commercial applications of public key cryptography at PGP Corporation, and he may have been the first person to ever implement a proof of work system in his \u201cReusabal Proofs of Work\u201d or \u201cRPOW\u201d application noting its potential usefulness in digital cash or in fighting against email SPAM.\n\nBut Hal wasn\u2019t Satoshi\n\nWhile Finney was absolutely involved in the earliest public days of bitcoin and deserves credit for being a great believer in the system and a confidant to Satoshi, a little bit of digging makes it pretty clear that he could not have been Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin.\n\nWindows, Mac, Linux.\n\nWe know Satoshi Nakamoto was a Windows user. A borderline exclusive Windows user, which is a major point that made Nakamoto stand out as an anomaly in the coding world where Mac and Linux systems are more common.\n\nFor example, Nakamoto asked Laszlo Hanyecz to code up Bitcoin on MacOS because he didn\u2019t even have a Mac to work on.\n\nAccording to Hanyecz, \u201cBitcoin originally didn\u2019t work on Mac. So I ported it to that. Satoshi actually asked me to do the releases for MacOS. I would do the build because he didn\u2019t have a Macintosh. He didn\u2019t know how to build it for Mac. So I was doing that and it was actually my binaries that were being posted.\u201d\n\nHowever, we know Hal Finney was a Mac user, as he tweeted about it, explained how to use PGP work-arounds on Mac systems and was comfortable speaking about working in Mac environments.\n\nGoing to Google calendar page causes an infinite loop of redirects for both my wife's and my Macs. Google status page says AOK? \u2014 halfin (@halfin) June 9, 2010\n\nBitcoin isn\u2019t crypto\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto was also heavily presumed not to be a professional coder or cryptographer. Notably, Nakamoto used elliptic curve secp256k1 which is a very particularly uncommon curve. Most professional cryptographers would have chosen a curve that confirmed to NIST standards. When asked about it by Hanyecz, Nakamoto was said to say, \u201cI had a bunch of people look at it, and they told me this was good,\u201d according to a 2020 interview with Cointelegraph. This is a very bizarre way to pick an elliptical curve to secure the system if one understood cryptography.\n\nGavin Andresen, Bitcoin\u2019s second lead maintainer, once called Nakamoto\u2019s use of SSL \u201ckind of naive\u201d and also criticized his lack of documentation for things like Schnorr or Lamport signatures, which would have been standard practice for a cryptographer even if they weren\u2019t used.\n\nAndresen also pointed out the amateurity of Nakamoto\u2019s quote on the topic of cryptography in Bitcoin.\n\nAndresen closed saying, \u201cBut key blinding and group signatures are concepts from Crypto 101\u2026 Satoshi was a brilliant programmer, but he didn\u2019t have a deep understanding of all the cutting edge crypto research that\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nPeter Todd also mentions Satoshi\u2019s lack of cryptography chops on Reddit saying, \u201cHe made many design decisions that suggest he wasn\u2019t a \u2018professional\u2019 cryptographer\u2026 the fact that the defender in the Bitcoin system only has a linear advantage over the attacker, rather than an exponential one, really runs contrary to how cryptographic systems are designed, yet in the case of Bitcoin social and economic factors make such a system work anyway; that\u2019s the kind of idea that often takes an outsider with a fresh perspective\u2026\u201d\n\nBut rather than being some kind of amateur, naive outsider to crypto, Hal Finney was a highly credentialled cryptographer at the cutting edge of crypto technology. In fact, he was hired by the legendary Phil Zimmerman at PGP and Finney coded up the benchmark PGP 2.0 implementation, which is widely regarded as the first great implementation of the technology in the world, and he stayed at the head of the field until retirement.\n\nHe was a leading expert in cryptography such that he was cited by other cryptographers in their white papers about cryptography. Daniel Bleichenbacher of Bell Labs cited Finney specifically for his expertise on SSL in his 1998 white paper, \u201cChosen Ciphertext Attacks Against Protocols Based on the RSA Encryption Standard PKCS #1,\u201d while folks like Andresen criticized the amateurish nature of Nakamoto\u2019s use of SSL.\n\nFinney notably won challenges to break Netscape\u2019s SSL encryption \u201cin short order,\u201d as he put it. So, Finney was at the forefront of his field in cryptography throughout the Bitcoin years when Satoshi Nakamoto was making amateurish decisions and statements about the use of cryptography and SSL implementations. This doesn\u2019t make sense if Finney was Nakamoto.\n\nFurthermore, Hal had disagreements with Nakamoto\u2019s implementation security on more than one occasion, and (with a nod to his crypto sensibilities) disliked the privacy model of bitcoin as Satoshi envisioned it.\n\nLooking at ways to add more anonymity to bitcoin \u2014 halfin (@halfin) January 21, 2009\n\nCoding abilities and style\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto had a unique coding style with peculiar grammar in the C++ language, which is a powerful, object-oriented language built as an extension of the \u201cC\u201d programming language. C uses similar rules, but is ultimately a more rigid language used for system applications and low-level programming applications.\n\nBy contrast, Finney was a C programmer with limited experience in C++, and his contributions to bitcoin were heavily weighted to code and security auditing of what Nakamoto had created. In Finney\u2019s own words to journalist Andy Greenberg, he explains the difference in their coding styles.\n\nSecurity\n\nIn a security audit, a coder is not supposed to audit their own work. Their own edits should have already been done before handing over for an audit, and this is what Nakamoto did with Finney: he handed over the code for a third party audit. Finney and Nakamoto were both experts in security practices, so they would not have skipped this or faked it. And we are blessed that their private emails have been made public by Finney\u2019s wife and son, Fran and Jason Finney.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that Ray \u201cBear\u201d Dillinger was also involved to some degree in these audits and early feedback sessions, and the three of them communicated together, which is a tough charade to manage both in written word and in code syntax. If we are to believe that Finney was pretending to be Nakamoto while also being himself in this complex process, we are asking a lot of the man!\n\nAccording to Dillinger, \u201cHal and I were essentially giving it a last-minute looking over to see if we thought there was any way to attack it\u201d in November 2008. The code is still available on BitcoinTalk.\n\nIn this era of Bitcoin, the pre-release and version 0.1 was replaced by new versions very quickly because of Finney\u2019s expert reporting and debugging.\n\nAn example from Finney to Nakamoto:\n\nAnd Nakamoto\u2019s response:\n\nThe above conversation went back and forth working out several bugs that was crashing Bitcoin and led to versions 0.1.2 and 0.1.3 in order to get it running as expected. Again, this is peculiar behavior to simulate in private emails, if we are assuming it was a ruse put on by Finney.\n\nIt is also crucial to reiterate the danger of not having a third party audit of financial code, so it is unlikely that Finney could be Nakamoto and juggled the task of a complex charade while also successfully completing the audit and releasing the code.\n\nWorldview differences\n\nSimilarly in the evidence published against Szabo, Finney has fundamental disagreements with Nakamoto on the implementation, purpose and use of Bitcoin. Finney also seemed to think Nakamoto and his invention were cavalier, insecure and generally flawed on both technical and philosophical points.\n\nNotably, Finney did not like the concept of competitive mining, excessive emissions of the mining process or a number of things about the competitive game theory of the system. In fact, he seems to have wanted miners to be altruistic for social value\u2014at least in theory.\n\nSatoshi\u2019s response is curiously obtuse. Is he saying the libertarian viewpoint is in harmoney with Finney\u2019s thoughts? In my opinion, this is a contrasting retort. Libertarians are fiercely competitive, so it can perhaps be assumed that Nakamoto is saying that competition is the attractive part. That is what I have always assumed on this point.\n\nThis is reinforced by Nakamoto\u2019s advocacy for Bitcoin to move into server farms with specialized hardware. He clearly saw the need for industrialization of nodes and hashing, which would infer that the \u201clibertarian\u201d comment meant the opposite of \u201chome compute\u2026 volunteer\u2026 for good causes.\u201d\n\nFinney also clearly worried about the environmental impact of mining at scale which shows Finney was concerned about \u201cproblems\u201d created by industrialization.\n\nThinking about how to reduce CO2 emissions from a widespread Bitcoin implementation \u2014 halfin (@halfin) January 27, 2009\n\nThis is in deep contrast to the view of Nakamoto who predicted and advocated for large scale specialization and industrialization!\n\nAccording to Dillinger, Finney also introduced the concept of a block size limit. Being primarily concerned with security over usability, Finney saw the risks of a DoS attack on Bitcoin unless there was a consensus level throttle.\n\nThis is in contrast to Nakamoto\u2019s position on node consolidation and his view that Bitcoin was meant to scale past Visa \u201cwith existing hardware\u201d in his early communications with Mike Hearn. This would require massive block size!\n\nHe also believed that Bitcoin\u2019s purpose was to process as many transactions as possible with nodes competing to be the best at processing the most transactions as efficiently as possible.\n\nLastly, Nakamoto AGAIN predicted GPU cards and specialization explaining that Bitcoin is only vulnerable \u201cwhen it\u2019s small.\u201d\n\nConclusion\n\nHal Finney deserves an incredible amount of gratitude and credit for his contributions to bitcoin, but it\u2019s clear that he was not Satoshi Nakamoto. He disagreed with major parts of the design and the implementation. He also wasn\u2019t prone to sock puppetry or any of the qualities one might expect from someone trying to play both sides an identity con. Lastly, he vehemently denied that he was bitcoin\u2019s creator multiple times in his life, and based on his general sincerity, I believe him.\n\nTo believe that Hal Finney was Satoshi Nakamoto is to believe that the details in his heartfelt farewell note to the Bitcoin community were a lie. I don\u2019t believe Hal Finney was a liar or had a dishonest bone in his body, and it would be a disservice to his legacy to conclude otherwise.\n\nHal was proud to receive 10 bitcoins from Satoshi Nakamoto. His son Jason shared a screenshot with Andy Greenberg showing them in his wallet.\n\nAnd he was proud to \u201cthe first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin.\u201d\n\nIn his farewell, he continued with pride, \u201cI mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.\u201d\n\nAnd Hal Finney closed with: \u201cI\u2019m comfortable with my legacy.\u201d\n\nAnd what a legacy!\n\nHal Finney was a seasoned distance runner, and a happily married father of two. The neuro-muscular disease ALS slowly changed Finney from a man of incredible strength, and it reduced him to complete paralysis before his untimely death.\n\nThrough it all, he remained upbeat, optimistic and dedicated to his family and his work. He cared about his children and the legacy that he would leave as a security innovator, free thinker, contributor to Bitcoin and a friend to Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nIn his last days and for some time after his death in 2014, criminal extortionists made the life of the Finneys unpleasant with threats and cyber attacks against their family\u2014an awful consequence of the culture of Bitcoin becoming so deeply toxic, so let us remember to defend the weak and to always be good to each other.\n\nIf you would like to donate to research to find a cure for ALS, the disease that took Hal\u2019s life, watch the video.\n\nWatch: Fran Finney for the 2023 Running Bitcoin Challenge\n\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "content": "It\u2019s January 9, and those familiar with Bitcoin history know that it was on this day 14 years ago in 2009 that the first version of the Bitcoin protocol was released and the Bitcoin blockchain truly began.\n\n\ud83d\udc09\ud83d\udd25 Forged from the depths of Satoshi's mind, and written in stone for eternity, on this day in 2009 the first version of the #Bitcoin protocol was released and the Bitcoin blockchain truly began. Happy Birthday, Bitcoin! \ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13 Read more: https://t.co/ZiGQ0h4rbF\u2026 pic.twitter.com/kMQzITs7Lz \u2014 CoinGeek (@RealCoinGeek) January 9, 2023\n\nWhat was the world\u2019s first peer-to-peer electronic cash system has radically changed over the years, but it lives on today as Bitcoin SV (BSV). Let\u2019s take a quick walk down memory lane to recap the main events.\n\nThe nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime. \u2013 Satoshi Nakamoto\n\nWasn\u2019t the Genesis Block constructed on January 3?\n\nYes, it was. Many refer to this as Bitcoin\u2019s birthday as a result, but because of how the Genesis Block was hardcoded into the Bitcoin software (not mined) in the usual way, it\u2019s more accurate to say Bitcoin\u2019s birthday is January 9.\n\nThe first Bitcoin transaction, between Dr. Craig Wright and Hal Finney, would come later on January 12.\n\nBitcoin was not a cypherpunk project\n\nIn his early communications, Nakamoto was clear that nodes would eventually end up in data centers. He said in no uncertain terms that users running nodes at home was not the intended configuration at scale. He also told Mike Hearn it never hit a scaling ceiling and announced it on the cryptography mailing list rather than any of the many cypherpunk forums or mailing lists online at that time.\n\nBy looking back at these facts, we can ascertain that Nakamoto never intended Bitcoin to be a tool for criminals or a \u2018decentralized\u2019 system in the way that word is misunderstood today.\n\nWho released Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin was released by a pseudonymous computer programmer called Satoshi Nakamoto. Due to public doxxing and a litany of evidence across various court cases, we now know that Satoshi Nakamoto was Australian polymath Dr. Craig Wright. While many deny this, the evidence is undeniable to anyone with an open mind.\n\nDid Dr. Wright create Bitcoin by himself? He credits his late friend, David Kleiman, and others, such as Hal Finney and Wei Dai, as having contributed in various ways, but he maintains that the system design was his and his alone. His Theory of Bitcoin series on YouTube explains the system in great detail, showcasing his knowledge of the system he created.\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nBy listening to Dr. Wright, we can learn his intentions for Bitcoin and how it went so horribly wrong in the years that followed.\n\nBitcoin got hijacked, but it\u2019s back for good this time\n\nWhile today is its 14th birthday, the original Bitcoin almost didn\u2019t survive. Due to the misguided ignorance and deliberate maliciousness of BTC core developers, who deliberately kept the 1MB block size that was always supposed to be temporary, Bitcoin was changed into something it was never supposed to be, and core features and capabilities were stripped out.\n\nThankfully, Bitcoin is alive and well today as Bitcoin SV \u2013 Dr. Wright\u2019s original design was restored. With the ability to process 100,000 transactions per second and an abundance of apps fueling micropayments on the blockchain, the original cash system he released is thriving. nChain and other companies are working on scaling Bitcoin to millions of transactions per second, and its capabilities are finally becoming more widely understood.\n\nClearly, Bitcoin\u2019s toughest years are behind it, and its future looks brighter than ever. As we celebrate its 14th birthday, let\u2019s reflect on how far it has come while realizing how far it still has to go.\n\nThanks for giving us the world\u2019s first scalable peer-to-peer electronic cash system, Dr. Wright, and happy 14th birthday, Bitcoin!\n\nWatch: How Bitcoin works as the base layer for other blockchains\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "title": "sCrypt's Xiaohui Liu is 'super excited' about Bitcoin in 2023 - CoinGeek",
        "content": "sCrypt had a big year in 2022, and founder Xiaohui Liu expects even bigger things this 2023. The tools he and his team have created for developers invite thousands of newcomers to try out Bitcoin and could eventually see Bitcoin SV (BSV) becoming like Amazon Web Services (AWS) for blockchain apps. He says his goal is to see developers bring ideas from concept to working applications in just a few months\u2014or even weeks.\n\nHe said BSV has probably benefitted from the declining interest in other chains that happened \u201call of a sudden, out of nowhere.\u201d The digital asset market remains in a big downturn, while individual companies and blockchains have suffered numerous glitches and scandals.\n\n\u201cFor Bitcoin to succeed, we don\u2019t have to do anything. We just have to survive long enough, and all the other blockchains, they just kind of implode, without us doing anything.\u201d\n\nJust build, show people what we can do\n\nXiaohui divides his highlights for 2022 into sections. There was the period leading up to the Global Blockchain Convention in Dubai, his first Bitcoin conference in years, and a chance to reconnect with many people he hadn\u2019t seen in years.\n\nIn Dubai, Xiaohui introduced the sCrypt Transpiler (to a standing ovation). The Transpiler is a tool that converts Solidity contracts written for Ethereum into Bitcoin-compatible sCrypt code, allowing developers to port any application they wrote for Ethereum to the BSV blockchain. He also demonstrated that BSV has the capability to run entirely other blockchain networks on its own chain. There\u2019s been an amount of interest in BSV from other blockchain developers interested in migrating their applications.\n\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nDevelopers and users just want something that works, Xiaohui says, and as long as they\u2019re not idealogues in favor of one network over another, just showing what Bitcoin can do is good enough for them.\n\nPost-Dubai, the highlight was realizing that Bitcoin can also run Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), providing cryptographic proof that data exists without revealing it. This is significant as it allows users to prove they own pieces of potentially private or sensitive information (like IDs, confidential or proprietary data) and use it without uploading the data itself to public blockchain records.\n\nIt\u2019s like the difference between chess, where all players can see all the moves, and games like poker and Battleship, where the game only works if some existent information is hidden from the other player. You can\u2019t put this hidden information on the public blockchain, but you still need some way to prove it\u2019s true.\n\nXiaohui says ZKPs are \u201clike a mathematical magical box.\u201d It\u2019s a fairly new concept, and running it on a blockchain network is difficult since it involves heavy computation work. But BSV can do it, and to Xiaohui that opens up a new universe of potential applications, even allowing Bitcoin to provide Amazon Web Services-level support for blockchain apps.\n\nThis way, if a developer wants to build an on-chain game, all they need to do is write the game logic itself. All the blockchain interactions, like wallet interactions and transaction broadcasting, can happen with sCrypt\u2019s toolkits and APIs. The goal is to make this as simple as creating any \u201cWeb 2.0\u201d application, the kind that dominates the internet today.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very bullish on games for Bitcoin,\u201d he says, since they\u2019re a medium that attracts a lot of attention from the outside world. Also, people should need to see that games can be trusted before sending their life savings to some blockchain DeFi platform.\n\nsCrypt in 2022 also co-organized the Zero-Knowledge Hackathon, which encouraged developers to try something new and build working prototypes for a $45,000 prize pool. Xiaohui was impressed by the level of interest and hopes that the Hackathon can become an annual event.\n\nOne other highlight towards the end of 2022 was when sCrypt launched scryptTS, a tool that lets developers write contract code in the more familiar TypeScript language (which adds types to JavaScript). scryptTS integrates TypeScript/Javascript libraries seamlessly, making for easier creation and debugging. Xiaohui hopes this brings in even more newcomers than sCrypt\u2019s Transpiler for Solidity.\n\nIn 2023, developing Bitcoin contracts will get easier\n\nXiaohui is optimistic about 2023 because he says it will mark Bitcoin\u2019s transition from mostly technical and theoretical discussions about what\u2019s possible to see the first usable applications appear.\n\nOne of the most depressing issues in Bitcoin until now has been the \u201cso how do I do it?\u201d question, he says. You can produce nuclear energy by applying Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity, but there are still some large gaps between knowing that formula and building a working power plant. Providing building tools for BSV apps allows developers to come over and experiment without having to learn years of detail first.\n\nXiaohui\u2019s biggest wish for 2023 is what you\u2019d expect from a developer, and that\u2019s to focus more on the tech, more people tinkering, building, and less focus on things like ideological controversies and court cases.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m saying I\u2019m super excited about 2023.

        "content": "Bitcoin pushes past $17,000. A week ahead focus is on Fed, digital currency group, Solana, Tron\n\nBitcoin conclusively pushed past $17,000 today, after witnessing a consistent decline in its volatility over the past eight weeks. BTC price recently climbed above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 200-day EMA. But there is still room for Bitcoin to fall, and the end of the current bear market won\u2019t be expected until the price surpasses the realized price, which is presently at $19.7K. Until then, the negative trend is expected to continue. As things stand, the Bitcoin (BTC) price is currently being traded at $17,240.59. This represents an increase of 1.73% on the day, in contrast to a gain of 3.62% during the week as per the cryptocurrency market tracker CoinMarketCap.\n\nAnalysts were quick to point out that price charts are still tilting bearish, although Coinbase Institutional\u2019s David Duong wrote in a report that a successful push past the $17,100 mark might put bitcoin on track toward the next technical level around $17,800. According to FundStrat\u2019s Sean Farrell, blockchain data suggests there are plenty of ready buyers with \u201cappetite to buy BTC at the very specific level of $16,00-$17,200.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis paints an incredible picture of a strong buy wall at current market prices and suggests a strong bottom is forming,\u201d Farrell wrote in a report.\n\nIn the week ahead, bitcoin traders will be monitoring a key report on U.S. inflation \u2013 also theoretically an input to the Federal Reserve\u2019s calculations. The central bank\u2019s monetary tightening last week was a big factor in bitcoin\u2019s 64% price decline last year, the worst annual performance in four years.\n\nThe largest asset by market capitalization has been trading in an increasingly narrow trading range since the FTX saga in November 2022. Contrary to popular belief, Bitcoin price could continue its climb against the USD.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nBefore you decide whether Bitcoin is a good investment or not, you should know that all Bitcoin price predictions are speculative. That said, these predictions are educated guesses because they are based on a mix of fundamental and technical analysis.\n\nDespite Bitcoin\u2019s shortcomings, analysts agree that during 2023 this crypto will still experience value growth, predicting its maximum value of $30,121 by the end of next year. However, it is more long-term that analysts expect Bitcoin to do well. For instance, analysts expect Bitcoin to trade at $200k or more in 2025.\n\nSo, Is Bitcoin a good investment?\n\nWhen you study the past performance of a cryptocurrency, you familiarize yourself with how it moves. Some are more volatile than others, and some increase or decrease in a certain way. Technical analysis will enable you to make better Bitcoin price predictions.\n\nBitcoin being the first-ever successful cryptocurrency, gained traction faster than the rest. This has seen it gain traction, especially at institutional levels. This means it could gain value over time.\n\nAt its core, the value of bitcoin is determined by its inherent scarcity. Like Gold, it is a limited resource: only a finite supply of bitcoin can be mined and traded on the market, which means that its price will likely continue to rise as demand grows. This has made it extremely attractive to investors eager to get in on the increasingly lucrative cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s unique combination of scarcity and utility will keep investors coming back for more. And as long as that demand continues to grow, so will the profits generated by trading this increasingly valuable commodity.\n\nBitcoin can be used for everyday payments. This is done peer-to-peer, so the payment cannot be controlled by any government. Thanks to its scarcity, Bitcoin could become a store of value, just like Gold. Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature makes it perfect as a store-of-value cryptocurrency.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

Since Bitcoin has been trading above the 200-moving average, it is generally thought that the cryptocurrency is now moving in bullish momentum.\n\nWhile BTC is currently inside an overbought region and has an RSI value of 72.39, we can anticipate a retracement of its recent gains in the near future. If BTC is unable to overcome the weak high it has reached right now, it is likely to revert to its previous order block, which is currently located between $16,957.78 and $16918.63. Another bearish scenario is between $16,771.05 and $16,708.11, which would occur if the bears applied more pressure and forced Bitcoin to move downward.\n\nIf Bitcoin bulls and buyers can pull up the price and the current bullish trend keeps on continuing, we can expect Bitcoin to reach $17,760.\n\nBitcoin is currently valued at $17,200 on CoinMarketCap, with a positive 1.45% 24-hour change in price. The trading volume of Bitcoin currently stands at $13,620,812,969, an increase of 79.18% over the previous day.\n\nA futures trader named Satoshi Flipper noted in a tweet that if the CPI report is less than 7%, which indicates that inflation is declining more quickly than expected, the market may gain momentum and hit multi-month highs above $19,000.\n\n<embed> https://twitter.com/SatoshiFlipper/status/1611483333023727616?s=20&t=Q_bQkm6Dp8cDdjPBVu_QCA </embed>\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

The deaths occurred under suspicious circumstances, and some of these billionaires had even raised alarms about being in danger.\n\n4 crypto billionaires dead in the span of a month. Just before, and during the FTX collapse.\n\n\n\nToo strange\n\n\n\nsound ... pic.twitter.com/ubtpweiJcw \u2014 Wall Street Silver (@WallStreetSilv) January 9, 2023\n\nThe spiral started toward the end of October 2022 when Nikolai Mushegian, co-founder of MakerDAO, was found dead on a Puerto Rican beach just hours after tweeting that intelligence agencies were after him. The next billionaire to perish was broker Javier Biosca, who was found dead on Nov. 22 in Estepona, Spain. At the time, Biosca was being investigated for the biggest cryptocurrency fraud in Spain.\n\nOn Nov. 23, Amber Group co-founder Tiantian Kullander died mysteriously in his sleep. Just two days later, Russian crypto billionaire Vyacheslav Taran died in a helicopter crash.\n\nApart from these four suspicious deaths, another death made headlines on Dec. 30 when Park Mo, vice president of Vidente \u2014 the largest shareholder of South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb \u2014 was found dead in front of his house in the early morning.\n\nRelated: Logan Paul backflips on defamation lawsuit against Coffeezilla, apologizes\n\nThe four crypto billionaire deaths within a month gave fuel to several conspiracy theories among the crypto community. One user associated the string of deaths with a mafia-style hit job and said that the \u201ccrypto world is taking a page from the mafia handbook.\u201d\n\nAnother user associated the death spiral with the \u201ccentral banking hierarchy,\u201d sarcastically saying, \u201cI would definitely not put money on it being connected to the central banking hierarchy. There is no way. They are very trustworthy. 100% no chance.\u201d\n\nOne user questioned the information sources but acknowledged that seeing four deaths in less than a month is suspicious. On the other hand, several Redditors speculated that they may not have actually died at all, with one writing, \u201cI wonder how many of these are people faking their own deaths.\u201d Another speculated that the billionaires might be living under fake names and are using their \u201cdeaths\u201d to start a new chapter of their life.\n\nThe deaths may be a cause of concern, but the crypto ecosystem is also known for its fascination with conspiracy theories. A similar saga erupted in May 2020 when the CEO of defunct crypto exchange QuadrigaCX mysteriously died during a visit to India."

        "content": "Bitcoin is one of the most profitable investments in today\u2019s economy, and its value continues to skyrocket! With our comprehensive guide on how to mine Bitcoin in 2023, you can get ahead of the cryptocurrency trend and start earning a passive income TODAY!\n\nBitcoin.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin mining?\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to mine Bitcoin in 2023 for a profit, you should know a few things. First, Bitcoin mining is becoming increasingly tricky as more-and-more miners compete for rewards. Second, the costs of mining equipment and electricity are rising. Finally, there is no guarantee that you will be able to recoup your investment. Still interested?\n\nHere\u2019s how to get started:\n\n1. Choose your mining hardware carefully. The type of equipment you choose will significantly impact your profitability. You\u2019ll need to balance cost against processing power to make a profit.\n\n2. Find a reliable electricity supply: Electricity costs can make or break your mining operation, so make sure you find a good deal before signing on the dotted line.\n\n3. Set up a well-organized system for managing equipment and keeping track of profits and losses. This will help you stay organized and avoid making costly mistakes.\n\nBitcoin mining is creating new Bitcoin by verifying transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. Miners are rewarded with Bitcoin for their efforts, and mining helps secure the Bitcoin network.\n\nIn 2023, miners will still be able to profit from Bitcoin mining if they have access to cheap electricity and efficient ASIC miners. However, difficulty levels will continue to increase, making it more difficult to turn a profit. Those who can mine profitably in 2023 will have invested in efficient equipment and have access to cheap electricity.\n\nRead also: African Bitcoin miner, Gridless raises $2m seed in round led by Jack Dorsey\u2019s Block\n\nThe current state of Bitcoin mining\n\nBitcoin mining is currently in a transitional phase. In the early days of Bitcoin, mining was performed with basic computer processors. However, as the Bitcoin network grew and became more competitive, miners began to use specialized equipment designed specifically for mining.\n\nToday, two main types of equipment are used for Bitcoin mining: ASICs and FPGAs. ASICs are purpose-built chips that offer tremendous performance gains over CPUs and GPUs. FPGAs are similar to ASICs, but they can be reconfigured to perform different tasks.\n\nBoth ASICs and FPGAs have their benefits and drawbacks. ASICs are very efficient at mining Bitcoin, but they come at a high up-front cost. FPGAs are less expensive than ASICs, but they\u2019re not as efficient. The current state of Bitcoin mining is highly competitive. You\u2019ll need to invest in the best equipment available to be profitable.\n\nHow to mine Bitcoin in 2023\n\nBitcoin mining is a process of verifying and adding transaction records to the public ledger, known as the blockchain. Bitcoin miners are rewarded with BTC for verifying and validating transactions. To be profitable, miners must have access to cheap electricity and efficient mining hardware.\n\nIn 2023, profitability will largely depend on the price of Bitcoin. If the price of BTC increases, more miners will enter the market in an attempt to earn a profit.\n\nThis will lead to increased competition and lower profits for individual miners. However, if BTC prices decrease, fewer miners will be willing to continue mining at a loss. This could lead to higher profits for those who can continue mining at a profit.\n\nRead also: Want to invest in crypto this January? Here are 3 coins to consider\n\nConclusion\n\nAs you can see, there are many ways to mine Bitcoin in 2023. Some of these methods may be more profitable than others, but all of them can be done if you are willing to do the work.\n\nIf you want to make a profit from Bitcoin mining, then you need to find the most efficient way to do it. With some research and effort, you should be able to find a method that works for you and that will allow you to make a profit in 2023."

The former Atlantic Power plant ceased generating in 2017 until acquired by Validus.\n\nSee: Bitcoin 'Power to Data' project unveiled at idle North Bay power plant\n\nNow Hut 8 accuses Validus of \u201cbreaches of certain obligations\u201d under the terms of that energy contract. The two companies have exchanged notices of default.\n\nRead the news release here.\n\nTwo months ago, Hut 8 disclosed it was issuing a notice of event of default to Validus, claiming Validus \u201cfailed to achieve certain key operational milestones\u201d under the terms of the power agreement.\n\nThese bitcoin data centres consume huge amounts of electricity to run and cool banks of high-powered computers. In the last year, cryptocurrencies like Hut 8 have grumbled about fluctuating power prices that have cut into bitcoin production.\n\nIn Hut 8\u2019s third-quarter financial results posted in early November, the company claimed that Validus \u201cdemanded that the company (Hut 8) make payments for delivery of energy that are higher than those negotiated under the terms of the PPA,\u201d and accused Validus of failing \u201cto meet its contractual obligations under the PPA.\u201d\n\nHut 8 said Validus has stopped supplying power to the North Bay facility and delivered a notice of event of default of their own, alleging that Hut 8 failed to make certain payments related to the delivery of energy, an allegation Hut 8 said it categorically denies.\n\nHut 8 said it\u2019s going the mediation route with Validus to reach a resolution.\n\nThere was no response from Hut 8 if the facility is completely shuttered or remains in an idled but maintained state.\n\nThe company also hasn\u2019t responded to how many jobs are impacted. During a groundbreaking ceremony in October 2021, company officials said there could be as many as 30 high-skilled technicians employed.\n\nIn a recent online interview with Compass Mining, Sue Ennis, Hut\u2019s vice-president of corporate development, said they \u201cultimately plan\u201d on reaching a resolution with Validus. \u201cWe hope to have a positive outcome.\u201d\n\nBut at the same time, Hut 8 has indicated its backup plan is to secure an alternative power supplier, likely through the merger and acquisition path.\n\nIn an email response, Jesse Nickel, Validus\u2019 vice president of business development, said both parties are \u201cactively engaged and collectively pursuing a resolution.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are quite hopeful we will reach a mutually successful outcome, either at mediation or prior to. Hut has a strong vision and deep industry expertise and they\u2019re a great partner to Validus Power. We are optimistic and anticipating back to business as usual in due course.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Validus maintains big cryptomining plans for its own.\n\nThe company has two data centres under development in Kingston and Iroquois Falls, the latter involving the use of a 120-megawatt natural gas-fired generating facility not far from the planned data site. Validus previously announced it was building a data centre in Kapuskasing, supplied by a local power plant."

The sector was dealt a fresh blow in November when Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s exchange FTX imploded amid allegations of fraud and misuse of customer funds.\n\nBitcoin, the most valuable crypto currency, plunged more than 54 per cent across the year and is currently trading at \u00a314,168 $ (17,249) \u2013 down from over \u00a330,000 at the beginning of the year and 75 per cent down from an all-time high in 2021.\n\nNew blockchain data analysed by CoinJournal has now revealed the amount of crypto millionaires \u2013 those with over $1m (\u00a3820k) worth of value in their wallets \u2013 fell by around 73 per cent from 90,000 to 24,000 in the period.\n\nThe data points to the scale of the carnage wreaked on retail investors with cash tied up in crypto. Analysts at CoinJournal said millionaires had \u201cdropped like flies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe on-chain data sums up what is glaringly obvious from looking at a Bitcoin price chart \u2013 that the party is over and investors are no longer dreaming of retirement off their Bitcoin holdings, in the near future at least,\u201d said CoinJournal analyst Dan Ashmore.\n\n\u201cNearly three-quarters of Bitcoin millionaires losing that status is perhaps the best piece of data of all to summarise how ugly 2022 was for investors.\u201d\n\nThe statistics came as separate data from the firm revealed that scams had surged in the past 12 months as fraudsters picked off investors amid the downturn.\n\nThe number of breaches and hacks jumped over 27 per cent to 120 \u2013 up from 94 the previous, year according to on-chain data analysed by CoinJournal. Total value of the scams came in at \u00a31.87bn, down from \u00a34.37bn the year before due to the sharp slide in the market/\n\nSo-called \u2018bridges\u2019 between blockchain were the target of some of the years\u2019 most costly, with Wormhole suffering a $320m attack in February, while the Ronin Network was drained of over $600m.\n\nCrypto investors may not see respite in the year ahead\n\nWrites Charlie Conchie\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to think of the implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s exchange FTX as the defining moment in the crypto market last year. The sheer scale of the 30-year-old former billionaire\u2019s fall from grace and the subsequent revelations of corporate mismanagement will mark it out as one of the greatest business scandals in history.\n\nBut the eye-catching collapse can almost shroud the fact that investors had already seen billions of dollars wiped from their wealth in the 10 months prior, as soaring inflation and sharp rate hikes plunged the market into a deep \u2018crypto winter\u2019.\n\nAnd investors could now face grimmer times ahead, with analysts bandying round gloomy predictions that could point to extreme pain to come.\n\nIn a research note last month, analysts at Standard Chartered said flagship currency bitcoin could tumble as low as $5,000 next year as investors flee digital assets to take shelter in Gold.\n\nVeteran investor Mark Mobius, who was not far off the mark with his 2022 predictions, predicted the flagship currency would fall to $10,000, in comments shared with CNBC.\n\nThe predictions will not make pleasant reading for speculative investors who, just over a year ago, may have had half an eye on crypto-funded retirement. Recessions around the world look lengthy and likely this year and sadly, many investors may be left lamenting their hopeful decision to hold.\n\nTraders may be forgiven for seeking some comfort in the predictions of former bitcoin billionaire Tim Draper, who says bitcoin will rally `1,400 per cent to reach $250,000. Dare to dream."

There wasn\u2019t a hiccup in the Bitcoin market.\u201d\n\nWhat about volatility?\n\nFurther comparing Bitcoin to the traditional markets, the famed investor touched upon the long-criticized volatility of the maiden crypto asset, stressing that \u201cthe market is up 70% and Bitcoin is up 190%. (\u2026) In the past month or so, it has been less volatile than the market.\u201d\n\nA well-known Bitcoin bull, Miller has earlier expressed his surprise at the \u201cremarkable\u201d performance of the largest digital asset by market capitalization in spite of the recent troublesome events, like the FTX implosion and the arrest of its founder Sam Bankman-Fried, that have shaken the crypto sector, as Finbold reported.\n\nA respected investment expert with a portfolio that consistently beat the S&P 500 Index from 1991 to 2005, Miller has also recently disclosed shares in crypto investment firm Silvergate Capital (which recently sank 40%) and crypto trading platform Coinbase.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin was at press time trading at the price of $17,273.91, up 0.01% on the day, as well as recording an increase of 3.16% over the week, adding up to the 0.67% gain on its monthly chart.\n\nBitcoin 7-day price chart.

        "content": "One of the world\u2019s largest asset managers, BlackRock, recently broke the news that it will add Bitcoin as an eligible investment in its funds.\n\nThe investment will be eligible on Global Allocation Fund, the fund invests globally in equities, debt securities and short-term instruments of both public and private issuers, without limitation.\n\nThe news was also leaked through the discovery of the company\u2019s deposit of 15 billion in Bitcoin futures registered with the CFTC.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s investment in Bitcoin\n\nBlackRock executives state:\n\n\u201cThe Fund may invest in cash-settled bitcoin futures that are traded on commodity exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\u201d\n\nThis $15 billion investment fund will be dedicated to investing in tokens, securities and debt obligations and will be able to allocate part of its funds to cash-settled Bitcoin futures traded through exchanges registered with the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nWhat does the integration of Bitcoin into this investment fund mean?\n\nSuch a globally important fund could accelerate Bitcoin\u2019s institutional entry into the global market.\n\nThe exposure that BlackRock\u2019s Global Allocation Fund will give the currency will make it even more visible, which would result in more optimism for the future of the oldest cryptocurrency.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s bet on Bitcoin is not a new one; rather, as early as last year, the firm added Bitcoin futures to the derivative products in which some funds could invest.\n\nIn the second half of the year, BlackRock opened the door to direct investments in Bitcoin, allowing its investors to invest and gain exposure to the cryptocurrency in the spot market through a private cryptocurrency investment fund.\n\nThe growing demand from BlackRock\u2019s cryptocurrency investors has prompted the asset manager to once again take a big step into the world of blockchain.\n\nThus arriving to launch new services, through large investments in Bitcoin custody and trading.\n\nLarry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, during an interview with CNBC in 2021, revealed:\n\n\u201cI think there is a very important role for a digitized currency (Bitcoin), and I think it will help consumers around the world.\u201d\n\nHis vision with respect to Bitcoin\u2019s future is undoubtedly very optimistic.\n\nBlackRock and the rescue of Core Scientific\n\nFollowing the various crises crypto exchange platforms have experienced, Bitcoin miners have also been in trouble.\n\nFor instance, Core Scientific Inc. ended up in bankruptcy. Nevertheless, the miners will continue to work and be operational, thanks to BlackRock.\n\nIn fact, the asset manager said it has lent $17 million to the US trading company, allowing it not to go completely bankrupt.\n\nClearly, the reason for the loan stems from the fact that the BlackRock asset manager holds funds and accounts tied to Core Scientific Inc. or related subsidiaries.\n\nCertain sources explain that BlackRock also holds $37.9 million in secured convertible bonds of Core Scientific Inc.\n\nThe first bankruptcy risks came in late October, after the Texas-registered company defaulted on its loan payments and causing its shares to fall nearly 80%.\n\nBy November the situation was critical once again, in fact it declared that it might run out of funds by the end of 2022.\n\nOn 21 December, Core Scientific, no less than one of the largest miners by computing power, filed for bankruptcy (Chapter 11), crushed by high energy costs and low Bitcoin (BTC) prices.\n\nIn short, BlackRock\u2019s connection to Bitcoin is increasingly solid; the future of Bitcoin is also in the hands of investment tycoons like Larry Fink and his firm."

        "content": "Crypto news: large hedge fund company Grayscale\u2019s leading indirect investment in BTC flies on the stock market but this reduces the discount on Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.\n\nGrayscale is grappling with some legal issues regarding some funds and loans, all solvable but the judiciary has its own timeframe and what\u2019s holding sway in the meantime is the market performance of its flagship financial instrument.\n\nFrom November to today despite some puzzlement the discount for the Bitcoin product has been at its lowest peak.\n\nShares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) flew to an incredible +12% Monday and significantly reduced the discount on Bitcoin.\n\nThe stock touched $9.65 and this caused the trust\u2019s discount to the NAV of BTC holdings to go to 38.55% recording the lowest differential in two months.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s instrument gives investors an opportunity to have one foot in Bitcoin without having to buy it directly.\n\nThe situation had not experienced this upward swing since early February last year, and the trend net of the legal events seems to be continuing.\n\nThe latest news on Grayscale Bitcoin Trust\n\nDigital Currency Group (DCG), the parent company of Grayscale, together with the trust, are the largest Bitcoin holders in the world after creator Satoshi Nakamoto and just above iconic giants such as Elon Musk, the amount is 643,572 units worth $11.1 billion according to the current value of the digital gold.\n\nMarket volatility and the technical inability of investors to get back liquidity drove up the discount but Grayscale attempted to change the product by turning it into a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to CEO Michael Sonnenshein, this would give more security to investors but the technical timeframe of the regulators was long and they eventually responded in spades.\n\nAlso in this regard last summer, Grayscale filed a complaint against the US Securities and Exchange Commission following yet another negative response for the company\u2019s submission of a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThose who own GBTC not being able to return capital as it is not provided by the instrument have pushed the company toward introducing a form of liquidity.\n\nIt is recent news that Fir Tree Capital Management, a Big Apple hedge fund is also in cahoots with Grayscale for \u201cpotential mismanagement and conflicts of interest\u201d while Valkyrie throws an assist to GBTC wanting to enter management by proposing that shareholders may vote to switch from Grayscale to Valkirie itself.\n\nIn the meantime, DCG upsets Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss, who turns to Barry Silbert and demands that he \u201cpublicly commit to working together\u201d to settle $900 million that Genesis subsidiary of DCG owes Gemini Earn.\n\nAmong the allegations he also reports that DCG is allegedly guilty of borrowing $1.7 billion from Genesis (parent to subsidiary), however, this was immediately denied via Twitter by Silbert."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price has taken a hit since it hit its all-time high back in 2021, and as a result, the number of bitcoin millionaires has dwindled dramatically since then. These addresses holding more than $1 million in BTC peaked in November 2021 and have been on a steady decline since then.\n\nBitcoin Millionaires Suffer Losses\n\nBack in November 2021, when the bitcoin bull market was in full bloom, the number of BTC millionaires had crossed 100,000 wallets. At its highest point, there were 108,886 wallets with more than $1 million worth of BTC in their balances, but according to data from BitInfoCharts, this number has dropped below 25,000.\n\nAt a current count of 24,533 millionaire wallets, more than 77% of bitcoin investors with the millionaire status have been wiped out in a little over a year. The majority of the losses came in the first half of 2022 and by June 2022, there were only a little over 26,000 BTC wallets with more than $1 million in their balances.\n\nWallets holding at least $10 million worth of BTC also took a hit during this time. It was sitting at only 3,852 at the time of this writing. However, smaller investors have been on the rise. According to a report from Glassnode, the number of BTC addresses holding higher than 0.1 and 1 BTC reached new all-time highs on Tuesday, January 10.\n\nThis marked accumulation from these smaller addresses shows that investors are not deterred by the decline in prices. But rather, are taking advantage of the low prices to increase their holdings.\n\nBTC price holding steady above $17,000 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nBTC Profitability Declines As Well\n\nThe drop in the number of bitcoin millionaires is also in line with the decline in the profitability of the digital asset. Bitcoin started the year 2022 with only about a quarter of its investor seeing losses, but by January 2023, it has dropped drastically, and now only 51% of BTC investors are in profit.\n\nIts large holder concentration has also dropped during this time. Only 10% of wallets are now classified as large holders, indicating a redistribution of BTC from whales to smaller holders. It also points to more decentralization with supply being more adequately distributed for market participants.\n\nAs for bitcoin\u2019s price, it is still trading well below its all-time high price despite its recent recovery above $17,000. Data from Messari shows that the price of the digital asset is currently down more than 74% from its November 2021 high.\n\nBTC is changing hands at $17,320 at the time of this writing. It is up 3.7% in the last week with a 24-hour trading volume of $16.2 billion."
