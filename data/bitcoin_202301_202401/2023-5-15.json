        "title": "Will Bitcoin Go Up or Down? Illinois Tech Professor Mines Data for Answers - IIT Today",
        "content": "Buy, sell, or hold? Since its launch in 2009 as the first cryptocurrency, the value of bitcoin has been a financial roller coaster ride with lofty peaks and precipitous drops. Given this history of volatility, is there any way that investors with bitcoin in their portfolios\u2014or those who are considering adding it\u2014can anticipate where this crypto is headed next?\n\nAssociate Professor of Finance Sang Baum Kang at Illinois Institute of Technology\u2019s Stuart School of Business is co-author of a paper published in The Journal of Alternative Investments that provides new empirical evidence about bitcoin returns to guide investment professionals, economists, and academic researchers.\n\n\u201cWhat Information Variables Predict Bitcoin Returns? A Dimension-Reduction Approach\u201d details research conducted by Kang and two of his former doctoral students\u2014Yao Xie (M.S. Finance \u201915, Ph.D. MSC \u201921), an associate quantitative analyst at Morningstar Inc., and Jialin Zhao (Stuart Ph.D. MSC \u201917), associate professor of quantitative management at St. Mary\u2019s University in San Antonio.\n\nAccording to Kang, Xie, and Zhao, bitcoin has straddled three different economic roles over time: as a type of currency, due to its use as a medium of payment; as a speculative security; and as a safe-haven commodity because of its scarcity and mining cost.\n\n\u201cIn academia, there is a research methodology called the asset return predictability study,\u201d says Kang. \u201cAn underlying principle is that variables predicting the future movement of an asset price may be important in the economic system. So understanding what those variables are is important not only to traders who want to take a position in bitcoin, but also to economists who want to understand the nature of bitcoin.\u201d\n\nUtilizing cutting-edge predictive analytics techniques and dimension-reduction models with a dataset covering January 2011 to January 2020, the research team focused on a comprehensive set of 25 information variables under five categories\u2014macroeconomics, blockchain technology, other assets, stress level, and investor sentiment\u2014to identify factors that impact bitcoin returns.\n\n\u201cWe find that blockchain technology, investor sentiment, and stress level have predictive power for bitcoin returns,\u201d Kang says. \u201cSimilar to traditional assets, bitcoin shows higher return predictability with longer return horizons. These findings support the dual nature of bitcoin as a technical artifact and speculative asset.\u201d\n\nMajor results of the research include:\n\n\u2022 The difficulty of mining bitcoin positively predicts returns, which supports the theory that as blockchain technology requirements increase, the supply of bitcoin is reduced, which in turn increases the return on bitcoin.\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin returns are positively driven by investor sentiment\u2014that is, the general attitude about bitcoin and the market. When investor sentiment goes up, so does bitcoin, indicating the speculative nature of bitcoin as an asset.\n\n\u2022 Future bitcoin returns decrease when there is an increased stress level, or financial turmoil in the economy, which points to the risks associated with holding bitcoin as an asset.\n\nIn addition, the research demonstrates that macroeconomic variables\u2014such as measures of business conditions, monetary policy, and inflation\u2014and returns on commodities, securities, and other assets do not predict bitcoin returns well.\n\n\u201cBitcoin returns are largely detached from economic fundamentals,\u201d Kang says. \u201cFrom this finding, we caution against using bitcoin as a diversifier or safe-haven asset within an investment portfolio.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Associate Professor of Finance Sang Baum \u201cSolomon\u201d Kang"

        "title": "Ethereum vs. Bitcoin: Which Crypto Is Better? - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies, also known as digital currencies, have been all the rage over the last couple of years. Coins like bitcoin have skyrocketed in recent years, and financial institutions are starting to get on board. Two of the largest and most popular coins are ethereum and bitcoin. This article explores and compares both currencies and will help you understand the pros and cons of each so you can determine which one might be right for you.\n\nRead: Looking To Diversify In A Bear Market? Consider These 6 Alternative Investments\n\nAbout Cryptocurrencies\n\nA cryptocurrency is a secure, virtual currency that is nearly impossible to counterfeit. These digital coins are assets that exist on distributed networks. The networks\u2019 decentralized nature means that governments and other central authorities can\u2019t control them.\n\nBlockchain technology, which is a technology based on a distributed ledger database, underpins cryptocurrencies. Cryptography and encryption techniques secure the network and prevent tampering. Every transaction is stored as a separate block on the chain, and those records are guaranteed to be accurate and immutable.\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin\n\nEthereum and bitcoin are arguably the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market today. They certainly are the largest by market cap. Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is over $363 billion, while ethereum\u2019s market cap is around $161 billion.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, launched in 2009 by a crypto architect known pseudonymously as Satoshi Nakamoto. The idea for this digital currency was simple yet revolutionary. It promised an alternative to traditional currency, called fiat currency, via a decentralized and transparent financial system accessible to all.\n\nBitcoin works on a blockchain network. Transactions happen between bitcoin wallets using private keys, which provide mathematical proof of their authenticity. Cryptography ensures both the integrity and the chronological order of transactions, and a distributed consensus system confirms pending transactions.\n\nBitcoin has capped the number of coins that can be minted at 21 million. Once that number has been reached, the coins can still be traded but no more can be introduced.\n\nThe following stats from CoinMarketCap are current as of Sept. 27:\n\nBitcoin Quick Stats Price $18,973.12 Market cap $363.56 billion Market dominance 39.17%\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum\u2019s white paper was released in 2013, and the project officially launched in 2015. Ethereum is an open-source, community-driven project and has seen quite a bit of evolution since its inception.\n\nLike Bitcoin, Ethereum is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network that snubs censorship and surveillance. The focus of the project is to enable access to financial services and commerce for everyone. It does this by allowing for the development of other cryptos as well as the execution of smart contracts on its platform, CoinMarketCap explained.\n\nIBM describes smart contracts as programs stored on a blockchain that run automatically when predetermined conditions are met. These functionalities make Ethereum a more versatile platform than Bitcoin.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum allows for an unlimited number of tokens.\n\nGood To Know The main difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin is the fact that Ethereum is programmable. That feature broadens the scope of Ethereum, making it more than just a digital currency. It makes Ethereum a marketplace for financial services, games and apps.\n\nEthereum Quick Stats Price $1,316.21 Market cap $161.30 billion Market dominance 17.39%\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum: Pros and Cons\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are both blockchains, but they serve different purposes, each with its own benefits and drawbacks.\n\nPros and Cons of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin has a narrow purpose: provide an alternative to fiat currency and a system for processing transactions.\n\nPros\n\nBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency on the market.\n\nThe coin has the best brand recognition and most liquidity, which has made it the most widely accepted cryptocurrency.\n\nThere\u2019s still huge potential growth for bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin uses blockchain technology designed to protect against fraud or identity theft.\n\nIts value is based on supply and demand, not political interference.\n\nBitcoin has a faster transaction speed than fiat currency.\n\nThe 21 million cap on bitcoins could drive prices higher by making the coin more scarce.\n\nCons\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price is highly volatile.\n\nBitcoin has limited functionality.\n\nBitcoin uses an extreme amount of energy, which is bad for climate change.\n\nBitcoin doesn\u2019t provide 100% anonymity.\n\nPros and Cons of Ethereum\n\nWhereas the purpose of the Bitcoin blockchain is to process transactions and store value, Ethereum is a platform that also supports the development of other projects.\n\nPros\n\nEthereum leverages blockchain technology for its decentralized, transparent system.\n\nThe technology enables functionality beyond digital currency, such as decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nThe developer community is one of the largest.\n\nThe Ethereum platform processes transactions faster than Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum recently completed an upgrade that reduced its carbon footprint 99.95%.\n\nCons\n\nThe coin is not bitcoin, which is the most popular cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nbitcoin, which is the most popular cryptocurrency in the world. The transaction fees are potentially higher than on the Bitcoin platform.\n\nEthereum is slow compared to alternative platforms, referred to as \u201cEthereum killers,\u201d like Solana, although the recent upgrade could improve Ethereum\u2019s speed exponentially.\n\nUnlimited supply could dampen demand for ethereum tokens.\n\nKnow the Risks of Investing In Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nAll cryptocurrency investments are speculative. The more aware you are of the risks, the better you can mitigate them if you decide to invest.\n\nHype and FOMO Risks\n\nThe fear of missing out is a powerful driver for people to buy cryptocurrencies. With bitcoin\u2019s explosion in value over the past few years, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in the hype. No one wants to lose out on the chance of getting rich from cryptocurrency, especially when it has already made many people extremely rich.\n\nHowever, regulators continue to warn the public that you could lose all your money in crypto. For example, bitcoin\u2019s price has dropped about 60% since the beginning of the year, and ethereum is down significantly, too.\n\nSecurity Risks\n\nBecause cryptocurrencies are digital assets, they\u2019re potentially vulnerable to hackers. The first month of 2022 saw several notable hacks. Hackers stole $80 million worth of crypto from Quibit, a decentralized platform. And the Crypto.com exchange reported the theft of about $35 million in cryptocurrency, most of which was ethereum and bitcoin.\n\nAnalysts also warn that quantum computers could hack crypto wallets, even though the technology isn\u2019t mainstream yet.\n\nTax Risks\n\nThe IRS wants to know about gains from crypto investments you\u2019ve sold. There\u2019s a tax question on Form 1040 specifically regarding cryptocurrencies. Failing to disclose this information could lead to stiff penalties or possible criminal investigation.\n\nRegulatory Risks\n\nGovernment-imposed regulations could make cryptocurrency safer and more secure, but they might also affect your access, the ways you use it and how it\u2019s taxed.\n\nWhich Investment Is Right for You?\n\nBoth bitcoin and ethereum have increased in value by staggering percentages since their release. But they\u2019re still experimental, and with innovation comes problems that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau warns haven\u2019t been resolved. For example, the decentralized nature of blockchains means there\u2019s no one to turn to if things go wrong. In addition, transactions can be much more expensive on a blockchain than through a bank or debit or credit card.\n\nIf you decide that investing in a blockchain is the way to go, it makes sense to consider the top two. Determining which one\u2019s right for you depends on your needs and goals.\n\nBitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency and has the most support commercially. If you\u2019re looking for a cryptocurrency alternative to fiat currency, bitcoin seems to be a good choice, as long as you\u2019re prepared to weather the volatility.\n\nTechnically speaking, Ethereum is more than a cryptocurrency. The Ethereum network acts as a marketplace for users to buy and sell goods and decentralized applications. If you\u2019re interested in more than a cryptocurrency, ethereum might be a good choice for you.\n\nDaria Uhlig contributed to the reporting for this article.\n\nData is accurate as of Sept. 27 2022, and subject to change.\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Ethereum vs. Bitcoin: Which Crypto Is Better?\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Longtime trader and billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones told CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d that he\u2019s sticking with bitcoin despite the regulatory pressures in the United States.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning, I\u2019ve always said that I want to have a small allocation [of bitcoin],\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only thing that humans can\u2019t adjust the supply [of].\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sticking with it. I\u2019m always going to stick with it,\u201d he added.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) came up as a hedge against inflation in Jones\u2019 conversation with Aaron Ross Sorkin. The two were previously discussing how quantitative easing and flat interest rates lasted all the way through 2021. Jones said this policy contributed somewhat to the banking failures in 2023.\n\n\u201cAnyone that was listening to our Fed at that point in time was probably doing exactly what these banks did \u2014 extending maturities \u2014 because they were being told that inflation didn\u2019t exist, and when it finally did come, it was transitory and rates were going to be low forever.\u201d\n\nOf course, inflation wasn\u2019t transitory with the CPI reaching a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022. Bitcoin\u2019s price sank as low as $18,999.95 on July 13, 2022, the day the June CPI report was released.\n\nNotably, Jones said the strategy of buying bitcoin and gold as an inflation hedge \u201cmay be over\u201d if prices begin to moderate.\n\nAdditionally, bitcoin isn\u2019t without its risks, according to Jones. He cited the US regulatory regime as a major thorn in the side of the world\u2019s first digital currency.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has a real problem because in the United States you have the entire regulatory apparatus against it,\u201d Jones said.\n\nCNBC\u2019s interview with Jones made news because he said there\u2019s a \u201cgood chance\u201d that the US could be on the verge of a recession by the third quarter based on \u201crecent financial episodes.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ordinals turned Bitcoin into a worse version of Ethereum: Can we fix it? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The launch of BRC-20 tokens and Ordinals NFTs on Bitcoin has transformed the No. 1 blockchain overnight into a clunkier version of Ethereum.\n\nThe core developers and miners who signed off on the network\u2019s Taproot upgrade in November 2021 never envisaged this would be the result. Bitcoin now suffers from many of the same problems that have bedeviled Ethereum for years, including scammy memecoins and shitcoins, NFTs of monkey pictures hogging block space and skyrocketing transaction fees.\n\n\n\nThe network is even having to deal with incidences of miner extractable value (MEV), whereby miners profit by reordering pending transactions.\n\nMati Greenspan\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of upset at myself for not realizing,\u201d says Quantum Economics founder Mati Greenspan, a Bitcoiner since 2013.\n\n\u201cIt took these guys starting to hype up JPEGs on Bitcoin until I was like: \u2018Oh shit, what did we just do?\u2019\u201d He laughs ruefully.\n\nSome Bitcoiners on Bitcointalk and Twitter refer to the impact of Ordinal NFTs and BRC-20 tokens as an attack on Bitcoin, an exploit of Taproot, or simply as spam clogging up the network.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s sparked a fierce debate over whether unexpected outcomes are precisely the sort of outcomes you should expect from a permissionless protocol, or whether something needs to be done to get rid of them.\n\n\n\nWhy are Bitcoin fees so high?\n\nBRC-20 tokens were only launched by anonymous developer Domo back on March 8. They use Ordinal inscriptions of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data to deploy token contracts, mint tokens and transfer tokens. Some argue this is horribly inefficient and costs four times as much in transaction fees as if they just used binary.\n\n\n\nAlongside the inefficiencies, there\u2019s also a gold rush for minting memecoins. Someone will deploy a contract with a ticker for a new token and a max supply, and then traders rush in to mint as many as possible in the series, on a \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d basis, at whatever fee rate gets them priority. These tokens have already surpassed $1 billion in market cap \u2014 even though Domo argues they will be worthless.\n\n\n\nBut they are here to stay \u2014 at least in the short term \u2014 with major wallets already adding support for BRC-20 tokens. And newer developments, such as the launch of a Uniswap fork that amassed $500,000 in trading of \u201csmart BRC-20\u201d tokens (SBRC-20) in just a few days, suggest that the building of a permissionless new ecosystem on Bitcoin is set to continue.\n\nFees too high to bank the unbanked\n\nGreenspan points out that while the flurry of interest has seen Bitcoin transactions hit an all-time high, the number of unique addresses plummeted, meaning fewer people are accessing the network. And while transaction fee revenue has overtaken the block reward \u2014 seen by many as the only way to ensure Bitcoin\u2019s security after another couple of halvings \u2014 it comes with a lot of issues.\n\n\u201cI spoke to one miner yesterday who said his revenue has doubled, which is nice, especially ahead of the halving, so it\u2019s good for miners, but it\u2019s terrible for the countries of Nigeria and El Salvador, for example, where, suddenly, the average cost to send a transaction is $30,\u201d he says. \u201cThe dream of financial inclusion on Bitcoin has been temporarily postponed.\u201d\n\nRead also: What it\u2019s actually like to use Bitcoin in El Salvador\n\nInterestingly, this isn\u2019t the first time someone has put a token or NFTs onto Bitcoin. Counterparty led the way with NFTs on Bitcoin, with Spells of Genesis and Rare Pepes in 2015 and 2016. And stablecoin Tether also launched a token on Bitcoin back in 2014 via the Mastercoin protocol (which later became Omni).\n\nJoseph Hall tries using Bitcoin to get by in El Salvador for Magazine.\n\nBan the spam, say Bitcoin maxis\n\nOn Bitcointalk, there is much discussion of fighting off the \u201cattack on Bitcoin,\u201d with some claiming it\u2019s the work of malicious Bitcoin SV devs. Users are talking about a soft fork to \u201cenforce strict Taproot validation script size,\u201d ways the protocol can filter out what they see as \u201cspam\u201d or even a hard fork to reverse Taproot.\n\nBitcoin developer Luke Dashjr stated that \u201caction should have been taken months ago. Spam filtration has been a standard part of Bitcoin Core since Day 1. It\u2019s a mistake that the existing filters weren\u2019t extended to Taproot transactions [\u2026] since this is a bugfix, it doesn\u2019t really even need to wait for a major release.\u201d\n\nIf Ethereum devs ever did anything remotely close to the below email, there would be absolute hysterics. People say ETH devs are too centralized with too much power. Look in the mirror. https://t.co/yBVNk2kixW \u2014 Hal Press (@NorthRockLP) May 9, 2023\n\nGlassnode\u2019s lead on-chain analyst, Checkmate, tells Magazine that he believes this sort of censorship is against the entire ethos of Bitcoin and notes there are already optional mempool rules enabling node operators to filter ordinals if they choose.\n\nCheckmate\u2019s Twitter profile pic.\n\n\u201cFrom my view, any attempt to ban or censor these transactions is far more of an attack on Bitcoin than leaving them be. They are within consensus rules, and when a loud minority of individuals want to change the rules to stop something they don\u2019t like, that is the real attack.\u201d\n\nBut podcaster Chris Blec made the case on Twitter that limiting transaction types to ensure the health of the network wasn\u2019t censorship.\n\n\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t depend on the content of the message or the sender of the message, then it\u2019s not censorship,\u201d he said.\n\nHass McCook, a former member of the Bitcoin Mining Council and a Bitcoin true believer, is no fan of Ordinals but thinks trying to get rid of them is a step too far, saying:\n\n\n\n\u201cThe only thing more important than Bitcoin is freedom. My general take is I personally don\u2019t like it and don\u2019t see value in it. But I don\u2019t want to censor it. I think that could go down a very dark path.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the protocol allows for something and somebody is happy to pay to do that thing, then it is what it is.\u201d\n\nI haven't heard one coherent argument yet as to how limiting spam on Bitcoin (including that which enables ordinals) equates to \"censorship\".\n\n\n\nIf there is one, please provide it here. \u2014 Chris Blec (@ChrisBlec) May 9, 2023\n\nImpossible to ban Ordinals anyway\n\nAndrew Poelstra, director of research for Blockstream, is one of the inventors of Taproot. He doesn\u2019t like the upgrade\u2019s \u201ctoxic\u201d offspring either but doesn\u2019t see any practical way to stop them.\n\n\u201cAs near as I can tell, there is no sensible way to prevent people from storing arbitrary data in witnesses without incentivizing even worse behavior and/or breaking legitimate use cases,\u201d he wrote.\n\nRead also: Is Bitcoin a religion? If not, it soon could be\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be possible just to ban \u2018useless data,\u2019\u201d he said, noting that people could just hide useless data like NFTs inside of useful data like \u201cdummy signatures or public keys.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDoing so would incur a 2x cost to them, but if 2x is enough to incentivize storage, then there\u2019s no need to have this discussion because they will be forced to stop due to fee market competition anyway.\u201d\n\nBitcoin transaction fees are back down to $5. I'm so glad that Ordinals fad is finally over. pic.twitter.com/8gl4kwcXTC \u2014 Mati Greenspan (@MatiGreenspan) May 14, 2023\n\nIgnore them, and they\u2019ll go away\n\nThe best-case scenario \u2014 and the most likely, according to interviewees for this piece \u2014 is that interest in the tokens and NFTs will die down as the memecoin fad plays out.\n\n\u201cNetwork congestion on Bitcoin is not a new thing, right?\u201d says Greenspan. \u201cIt usually comes with hype. But also it leaves when the hype is over.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s most likely to happen is people are gonna run out of money.\u201d\n\nBut if Ordinals continue to have an outsized impact on the network, there\u2019s always the nuclear option of forking Bitcoin to modify or remove Taproot. Blec and many others have raised the possibility, though it seems mostly hypothetical at this stage.\n\nIf enough Bitcoin ecosystem participants (users, node operators, miners) reach a consensus that Bitcoin should be forked in a way that reduces spammy txs, that's not censorship.\n\n\n\nYou can still mine & use the current fork and mint your dumb jpgs there. \u2014 Chris Blec (@ChrisBlec) May 9, 2023\n\nFork Bitcoin to get rid of Ordinals\n\nGreenspan says, while it\u2019s always possible to implement a hard fork, \u201cit\u2019ll split the network. And nobody wants that.\u201d\n\nMcCook says the market chose Bitcoin, rather than Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin SV during the scaling wars in 2017, and he predicts the current version would win over a fork with Taproot.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d take the Ordinals one. So, even though I don\u2019t find any value in Ordinals, maybe I need to inscribe something in the future that I need to have absolute censorship resistance,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThis could potentially have pretty powerful implications. Let\u2019s say Julian Assange decided to do his WikiLeaks info dump as an inscription, this is a very useful thing.\u201d\n\nGreenspan also believes the benefits of using Bitcoin to store data have only just begun to be explored.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople are now aware that Bitcoin has the ability to store files. And I\u2019m excited to see what, you know, forward-thinking developers will do with this new tool. More than just creating memes.\u201d\n\nMake the tokens better\n\nWhen he released BRC-20, Domo added, \u201cI believe there are almost certainly better design choices and optimization improvements to be made.\u201d\n\nPlenty of people agree. One of the easiest improvements would be to use binary rather than the JSON format, which developer John W. Ratcliff argues is \u201cone of the most inefficient data formats anyone could use.\u201d He believes this would reduce BRC-20 tokens from 89 bytes to 19.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis means that they are paying over four times as much in fees to commit these BRC-20 tokens than necessary,\u201d he said.\n\nHashrate Index researcher Colin Harper says that using binary code \u201ccould reduce bandwidth by as much as 80%.\u201d However, this wouldn\u2019t entirely solve the problem, as Bitcoin influencer Udi Wertheimer points out, given the spike in fees is due to token minting degens bidding up fees to get their transaction prioritized into order to mint or snatch up low serial number tokens before the supply runs out.\n\nThere\u2019s also another way to issue assets on Bitcoin called Taro, which Domo says is \u201ca better solution. Taproot Asset Representation Overlay is a proposed protocol that will allow people to issue digital assets on Bitcoin that can be transferred to Lightning for fast and cheap transactions.\n\n\n\nRead also: Attack of the zkEVMs! Crypto\u2019s 10x moment\n\nBuild a virtual machine on top of Bitcoin\n\nA much more radical and experimental approach is being taken by Trustless Computer, which is behind a Uniswap v2 fork called Trustless Market that enabled $500,000 worth of swaps in its first three days.\n\nThe project\u2019s documentation states it\u2019s working toward a Turing-complete virtual machine called BVM built on top of Bitcoin to enable a DeFi ecosystem.\n\n\n\nCore team member @punk3700 tells Magazine it \u201cis not a layer 2, it\u2019s a \u2018protocol within layer 1\u2019\u201d that works like Ordinals but uses SBRC-20s.\n\n\n\nInstead of writing \u201ctext files to Bitcoin, Trustless Computer writes smart contract transactions to Bitcoin. Raw files vs. programs/logic/apps.\u201d He claims this cuts down the bandwidth required for the tokens by 80%\u201390%.\n\nStick-figuring out how a Bitcoin Virtual Machine would work.\n\n\u201cI think the BRC-20 in their current form (using text files) are a flash in the pan,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t use paper and pen to build an alternative scalable financial instrument.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur SBRC-20 implementation is different. We use smart contracts, the same ERC-20 smart contract on Ethereum. It works exactly as programmed.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOrdinals is v0.1 of what is possible on Bitcoin. Trustless Computer shows that you can build a full DApp ecosystem on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHe expects that we\u2019ll see MakerDAO, Aave, Compound and other smart contracts deployed soon, which, if it works as he claims it will, would be a huge change for Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nWhile the project has recieved coverage in other major crypto news outlets, Magazine hasn\u2019t verified their tech works as promised, and the extent to which you can integrate smart contracts with Bitcoin is debatable, so tread carefully.\n\nCan we scale Bitcoin with ZK-rollups?\n\nThe influx of NFTs and token minting on Bitcoin has shown the blockchain remains unable to scale to deal with increased demand, meaning the more popular it gets, the worse it works.\n\n\n\nThe Lightning Network is usually touted as the solution, but Nostr creator Fiatjaf noted it has been unable to cope with the recent fee spike. \u201cChannels are too fragile, it costs a lot to open a channel under a high fee environment, to run a routing node and so on,\u201d he wrote, stating that users instead had to rely on the centralized Lightning providers.\n\nGreenspan believes that gradual progress toward scaling is the only safe solution to ensure Bitcoin remains bulletproof.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen Segway; we\u2019ve seen Taproot. I mean, these are, these are good progressions and steady scaling. Which is what\u2019s best usually for a decentralized network of this size. You don\u2019t want to rush things because you might break them. As we\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\n\n\nRead Also: Reformed \u2018altcoin slayer\u2019 Eric Wall on shitposting and scaling Ethereum\n\n\n\nVarious parties, including StarkWare and blockchain researcher Eric Wall, have been investigating scaling Bitcoin using zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups, which is Ethereum\u2019s plan to solve its very similar challenges.\n\n\n\nBut ironically, while the surge in demand caused by Ordinals has shown that further scaling is required, it\u2019s also made it much less likely the community would agree to a new hard fork to enable ZK-rollups. After all, they voted for Taproot and look what happened?\n\n\u201cI doubt that will ever happen,\u201d says Checkmate.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am also skeptical of even a soft fork since the unintended consequences of the witness discount have woken everyone up to the risks of change.\u201d"

        "content": "A standing committee comprised of various governmental ministries and the central bank of Saudi Arabia has warned that trading of \u2018unauthorized\u2019 cryptocurrencies like bitcoin is illegal in the country.\n\nIn a statement published by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) \u2013 the sovereign Arab state\u2019s deface central bank \u2013 on Sunday, a governmental committee declared it was against trading of cryptocurrencies. The reasons, it claimed, were due to \u201ctheir negative consequences and high risk on traders\u201d since they are beyond the purview of governmental supervision.\n\nFormed by a supreme decree, the standing committee was devised as a watchdog to specifically look into \u2018unauthorized securities activities in the foreign exchange market\u2019. It includes Saudi Arabia\u2019s Capital Market Authority (CMA), the Interior, Media, Commerce & Investment ministries as well as the SAMA. Pointedly, the supreme decree has tasked the committee to inform relevant authorities by reporting any trading or investments in forex and cryptocurrency trading as well as reducing their marketing activities to keep them from investors.\n\nIn a statement, the committee said:\n\n\u201cThe committee assured that virtual currency including, for example but not limited to, the Bitcoins are illegal in the kingdom and no parties or individuals are licensed for such practices. \u201c\n\nWithout indicating any penalties or fines for cryptocurrency trading, the committee insisted on warning \u201call citizens and residents\u201d against what is deemed an \u2018illegal\u2019 activity.\n\nAt the time of publishing, BitOasis \u2013 the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)\u2019s first bitcoin exchange \u2013 continues to list Saudi Arabia among its supported countries following its initial launch nearly two years ago. The exchange operator notably suspended fiat withdrawals citing an \u2018issue\u2019 with its banking partner in May. The exchange has changed tact ever since and has today announced the resumption of international fiat withdrawals.\n\nA representative for BitOasis did not return a request for comment at press time.\n\nCuriously, the SAMA is working on its own custom cryptocurrency for blockchain-powered cross-border transactions with the UAE\u2019s central bank. Saudi Arabia\u2019s central bank is also using Ripple\u2019s blockchain software xCurrent \u2013 which doesn\u2019t use XRP \u2013 to plug regional banks on RippleNet, an enterprise blockchain network for instant payments.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock."

        "content": "Bitcoin mining is big business these days. Major operations run racks of rigs and even their own power plants to solve blocks \u2014 but you can spin the wheel and hope for a BTC payoff for less than the cost of a midrange smartphone or gaming console.\n\nIt just takes ordering a few parts, which together come in just under $400.\n\nThat includes the single-board computer \u201cRaspberry Pi Zero W 2,\u201d a heatsink case and a USB-based bitcoin miner built on Antminer\u2019s BM1397 ASIC chip promising up to 350 gigahashes per second (GH/s).\n\nThat\u2019s the same chip used in Bitmain\u2019s famous Antminer S17 and S17 Pro.\n\nRaspberry Pi Zero 2 W: $22\n\nBitcoin USB stick miner: $325\n\nHeatsink case: $19\n\nAttaching a heatsink helps absorb and disperse the heat generated by the components ensuring the entire thing doesn\u2019t pop. It would be especially helpful if actually planning to mine bitcoin from your pocket.\n\nMining bitcoin with tiny devices is known as \u201clotto mining,\u201d on account of how little chance one has of successfully mining Bitcoin blocks with micro setups at home.\n\nAt 350 GH/s hash rate, solo miners would need to run for an average of up to 21,400 years to strike it big. Bitcoin block rewards are expected to run out by around 2140, due to the network\u2019s \u201chalving\u201d events every four years, which slash issuance.\n\nFor scale, Marathon Digital \u2014 one of the world\u2019s largest publicly-listed bitcoin miners \u2014 generated 2,195 BTC ($60 million) in the year\u2019s first quarter, averaging around 24 BTC ($656,300) per day.\n\nFirms like Marathon run tens of thousands of ASICs at once, which dramatically increases their chances of solving blocks. Solo miners \u2014 like those running singular Raspberry Pis \u2014 can boost their odds by joining mining pools.\n\nWhenever the pool wins, so do all those contributing hashpower. Major mining pools Foundry, AntPool and F2Pool currently mine more than 70% of all Bitcoin blocks, with participants sharing their hashpower for a cut of the pool\u2019s block rewards.\n\nSolo mining can actually work \u2013 but it\u2019s rare\n\nHere\u2019s some inspiration for those feeling lucky: Two solo Bitcoin miners separately mined their own Bitcoin blocks within two days of each other last year, using only a small number of mining chips.\n\nThe miners used solo mining software Solo CK Pool, which unlike standard pools, serves as something of a web proxy for bitcoin miners. Successful miners recoup 98% of all rewards, with 2% going to the administrator for hardware upkeep, code iterations and the like.\n\nThe chances of actually winning a Bitcoin block reward from a single rig is about one in 1.1 billion, according to one estimate. Hence the comparison to a lotto draw. SoloCK miners have snagged six blocks over the past six months and 257 over the past eight years.\n\nFraming participation in Bitcoin consensus \u2014 in support of a potently censorship-resistant money network \u2014 as mere lottery may be a little gauche.\n\nStill, tiny miners like these serve as a perfect entry point for tinkering with blockchain technology in its purest form. You might as well be rewarded with an (almost) never-ending lottery ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The US could be headed towards a recession, a potentially unprecedented test for the crypto industry.\n\nOutside of the two-month recession around the Covid pandemic, crypto has never experienced any legitimate economic downturn. The mortgage-fueled \u201cGreat Recession\u201d from 2007 to 2009 preceded Satoshi Nakomoto launching the Bitcoin network, long before NFTs and Web3.\n\nPredictive models from the New York Federal Reserve point to a 68% likelihood of a recession hitting within the next year, a daunting 30% leap from predictions just five months earlier.\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry\u2019s reaction would largely depend on the root cause, duration and severity, according to Rich Rosenblum, CEO of market maker GSR.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a recession driven by a worsening of the banking crisis, it could end up a boon, as crypto is increasingly being seen as a viable alternative to legacy financial systems,\u201d he said. Rosenblum warned that projects would need to focus more on public sales over private deals, as institutional demand may dry up.\n\nIf a recession stems from persistent global economic weakness, survival could be challenging for crypto companies, especially those dependent on speculative inflows.\n\nTokens with real-world impact outside of the industry are likely to be more resilient, Rosenblum said.\n\nRecessions are getting shorter\n\nThe good news: The average length of a recession has declined over the centuries.\n\nGranted, the most recent US recession (which went for 18 months) was the longest since the Great Depression \u2014 almost 100 years ago, but:\n\nFrom 1854 to 1919, a typical recession lasted 21 quarters, or a bit more than five years, data from the National Bureau of Economic Research shows.\n\nBetween 1919 and 1945, that average fell to 18 quarters, or four and a half years.\n\nModern day recessions are estimated to span 10 quarters, just two and a half years.\n\nStill, some allocators \u2014 like Akshat Vaidya, head of investments at Maelstrom, the debut fund of the family office of BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes \u2014 aren\u2019t confident that crypto could make it through unscathed.\n\nVaidya told Blockworks he expects crypto to move just like it did during the 2020 Covid crash, \u201cimplode along with the rest of the world come recession, as liquidity vanishes in the cascade of margin calls.\u201d\n\nThat could still lead to a positive outcome over the long term. After all, bitcoin skyrocketed more than 900% in the quarters following the 2020 recession, jumping from below $7,000 to as high as $69,000.\n\n\u201cNot only will high-quality projects survive, but they will thrive in the easy money policies that follow,\u201d he said, adding that investors focused on quality could see an opportunity to be \u201cgreedy when others are fearful.\u201d\n\nBitcoin halvings help crypto practice for recession\n\nSubstantial monetary stimulus worldwide during the pandemic renewed one of Bitcoin\u2019s primary value propositions: Hedging against inflation and currency devaluation.\n\nWith this in mind, one optimistic take is that bitcoin \u2014 which generally leads crypto markets \u2014 has historically operated in four-year cycles, on account of its halvings.\n\nPast performance around halvings may not strictly indicate future results, but predictable changes to bitcoin\u2019s issuance could help crypto investors plan to weather the storm.\n\n\u201cWith each halving event where the new supply of bitcoin is reduced by half; every halving event to date has preceded a significant increase in the bitcoin price as well as a correction to follow,\u201d Jesse Shrader, CEO at Lightining-focused startup Amboss Technologies, said.\n\nOn the other hand, government stimulus has shielded parts of more traditional industries, including leading up to and throughout the pandemic recession.\n\nWhile stimulus has made the business environment seem more stable, it\u2019s not clear whether the broader economy could withstand dramatic shocks without intervention.\n\nFor startups battling a prolonged recession, profit margins and cash flow remain critical, according to Terrence Yang, managing director at bitcoin financial services firm Swan Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cCan you survive several months or even years of a recession? Now is a good time to evaluate whether you are credibly solving a big, urgent problem with a uniquely valuable solution,\u201d Yang said, adding that\u2019s something few cryptocurrencies have done.\n\nFor investors, Yang said bitcoin\u2019s fundamentals in the long-term remain unchanged, especially over horizons for longer than five years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Now, they can skip this step with a new system that lets them open an account for free and begin working with the company\u2019s payments technology right away.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make sure that our offer covers all possible projects and caters to developers of any size, from individuals and small teams, to large businesses and enterprises,\u201d the announcement adds. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve come up with a tiered offering with diverse transaction and volume allowances and project count limits, each with its own pricing.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a completely free option, the company noted, as part of its \u201cvision of expanding global monetary freedom.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to PYMNTS\u2019 Karen Webster last year, Zebedee Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer Andre Neves said bitcoin is the perfect currency to provide standardization when it comes to transferring value.\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t have to be something as complicated as a video game or metaverse. \u201cWe\u2019re in a virtual world and we can talk and chat and stream 8K video quality, but we\u2019re unable to transact value in this conversation,\u201d Neves said.\n\nOn a worldwide scale, one of the key reasons for this is that each jurisdiction has its own currency and its own laws, Neves told Webster.\n\n\u201cSo standardizing a money for the world and for the virtual world, is really important \u2014 you really need that medium of exchange with the ability to move value without needing to have some foray into foreign exchange.\u201d\n\nAs a digitally native currency bitcoin \u201cprovides that capability regardless of any geographical or real-world constraint,\u201d Neves said.\n\n\u201cSo regardless of where in the world you find yourself and where I find myself, we\u2019re able to transact with the same sort of monetary standard. Powering virtual worlds and real worlds with the same money is a very powerful thing. And I think we\u2019re just scratching the surface of what it means.\u201d"

        "content": "Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange Gatecoin\u2019s marketing chief has stated that bitcoin price, despite these boom times, is \u201cundervalued.\u201d\n\nIn a televised interview with Bloomberg today, Gatecoin\u2019s marketing chief and head of business development for Asia Pacific Thomas Glucksmann was led onto the subject of bitcoin\u2019s \u201cfair value\u201d, at a time when prices are nearing $10,000 \u2013 a remarkable 10x gain since the turn of the year. The bitcoin executive professed the market remains relatively \u201cillogical\u201d compared to traditional financial assets where price predictions are analyzed over usual valuation metrics.\n\nAsked if it was \u201cimpossible\u201d to determine bitcoin\u2019s fair value, Glucksmann acknowledged and replied:\n\nI would still argue that it is highly, highly undervalued. If you look at the long-term potential of the technology in the next 10, 20, 30 years, $10,000 is cheap in my opinion.\n\nWhile bitcoin is now seen in the mainstream as a store of value among retail investors, it remains a peer-to-peer decentralized electronic cryptocurrency, a fact Glucksmann is keen to point out even if or when the cryptocurrency is valued at a million dollars. \u201cBitcoin is divisible up to 8 decimal places,\u201d the Gatecoin executive told the interviewer, referring to the smallest fraction of a Bitcoin, also known as Satoshis (0.00000001 BTC \u2013 a hundredth of a millionth BTC).\n\nHe stated:\n\nEven if one bitcoin is worth a $1,000,000, you could still have $1 USD worth of bitcoin which you could still transact peer-to-peer. It\u2019s important to look at bitcoin in that way with that longer-term view.\n\nAt press time, data from CoinmarketCap reveals bitcoin price trading at $9,927 and topping $165 billion in the total market value of all 16.7 million mined bitcoins.\n\nGatecoin, which lays claim to being the world\u2019s first exchange to list Ethereum\u2019s ether tokens in mid-2015, suffered major operational disruption in recent months after Hong Kong banks abruptly froze its accounts, forcing the exchange to suspend HKD and USD deposits from customers at a time when the exchange had \u2018tripled\u2019 its customer base following bitcoin\u2019s price gains. The exchange found respite with new banking partners in Europe and is scheduled to resume bank transfers in December.\n\nThe exchange also added support for Litecoin this month, enabling users to buy and sell the alternative cryptocurrency with bitcoin, ether and the Euro. In his remarks today, Glucksmann underlined Litecoin as an \u201cunderrated cryptocurrency\u201d that shares many similarities with bitcoin without suffering the same \u201cscaling issues\u201d that has often plagued its development and community.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock."

        "title": "The promise of crypto has not lived up to its initial excitement - The Economist",
        "content": "\u201cT wo years ago everyone wanted to be us. Now everyone hates us,\u201d laments a 24-year-old crypto founder at a gathering in New York. After once seeming as if it might threaten to remake the entire financial system, crypto has gone through a spectacular decline. The market value of all cryptocurrencies ballooned from $250bn at the start of 2020 to $3trn by late 2021. But it has since fallen back to just $1.3trn. Even more important, public trust in crypto has hit rock bottom after a string of high-profile swindles and crashes, notably the downfall of FTX , a popular cryptocurrency exchange, in November 2022.\n\nListen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android Your browser does not support the <audio> element.\n\nYet in Dubai, crypto talk remains boisterous. The emirate has opened its doors to the industry by creating a regulatory body dedicated to crypto that has created \u201cmuch needed clarity\u201d, argues Alex Chehade, the local boss of Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange. Binance and other exchanges such as Crypto.com and Bybit set up shop in Dubai in 2022. Big questions still hang over the industry. At one meeting in Dubai this correspondent met an indignant response when he asked if crypto would ever find its \u201ckiller app\u201d. \u201cWe already have it,\u201d snapped a developer.\n\nAttitudes to crypto have polarised. To some, its promise of revolutionising finance has been shattered. It was meant to sidestep a stodgy rent-seeking financial system that was expensive, inaccessible to many and possibly untrustworthy. Yet the financial system is not static: it is actively adopting new technology. And regulators are belatedly acting. Singapore, once a leading crypto hub, asked Binance to pause operations as of December 2022. It had issued just ten licences out of some 600 recent applications to set up crypto businesses. As many as 25 out of 45 countries looked at by the Atlantic Council, a think-tank, have imposed partial or complete bans on crypto.\n\nPockets of hope remain. The price of bitcoin is up almost 70% this year, including a surge after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. There is some evidence to suggest that cryptocurrencies win more adherents in weak countries that are afflicted by high inflation or currency depreciation, such as Argentina and Nigeria. That points to a deeper truth, which is that the strongest arguments for using crypto have always been where the alternatives are worse.\n\nIn 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto said in his bitcoin pitch that \u201cWhat is needed is an electronic payment system\u2026allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.\u201d Crypto transactions promised more efficiency and the avoidance of irksome control by governments. Yet neither benefit has really come about. Transactions still have to be verified by computers that maintain a copy of the associated blockchain, one reason why Coinbase, a listed American crypto-exchange, charges a 1% fee for payments. Add the expense of moving money in and out of crypto and overall costs are quite high. Why pay fees to transact on the Ethereum blockchain when India\u2019s UPI or Brazil\u2019s Pix is cheaper? It is not easy to avoid government oversight, either. To move from traditional currency into crypto, consumers must use on-ramps, which tend to be centralised platforms like Coinbase or Binance. The same holds for stablecoins that are pegged to the dollar. They must be trusted\u2014exactly what crypto claimed not to need. Decentralised platforms like Uniswap exist, but they are hard to use and bring other risks, such as losing the private key, a password that can never be recovered. Mining bitcoin also brings huge environmental costs.\n\nA sudden love of regulation\n\nCrypto advocates now claim to want regulation to reduce uncertainty and regain consumer trust. But regulators often go a lot further than many had expected. The Reserve Bank of India\u2019s governor, Shaktikanta Das, has said crypto has \u201cno inherent value\u201d and he may ban most of it. On January 5th American regulators (including the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) declared that crypto-assets on decentralised networks were \u201chighly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.\u201d The government also seized Signature Bank, which was a prominent bank for the crypto industry, after it collapsed.\n\nAs regulation comes for crypto, it will make transactions more expensive. Mr Poon of Hong Kong Polytechnic University says much of the cost of financial transactions comes from complying with regulations like know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering laws. Yet friendlier regulation could help the industry. Binance and other crypto firms are in Dubai precisely because of the regulatory cover it provides. The question then is: if crypto faces the same regulation as fintech firms, does it offer anything uniquely valuable?\n\nThere are places where crypto may still be useful. Kim Grauer, head of research at Chainalysis, which researches data from blockchains, finds hotspots of crypto adoption \u201cin places that suffer from currency depreciation\u2026or severe inflation.\u201d Crypto can act as a hedge. \u201cBitcoin in Lebanese currency is up something like 6,000%,\u201d notes Mr Chehade of Binance. Governments can also raise demand. Ms Grauer says Nigerian capital controls and Argentinian restrictions on holding dollars offer reasons for people to move funds into stablecoins and bitcoin. Their governments might detect a risk to financial stability. Their citizens see an alternative to incompetent or corrupt officials.\n\nAnother commonly cited case is cross-border payments, particularly for illiquid currency pairs. \u201cGlobalisation today has been capped at $10,000,\u201d says Navin Gupta, a banker who is now at Ripple, a crypto firm that does international payments. Cross-border fees take a greater share of value for smaller payments because of high fixed fees, which deter some transactions entirely. Ripple\u2019s network allows cryptocurrencies to intermediate trades between traditional currencies, reducing costs. The firm, worth $15bn at the start of 2022, has processed some $30bn through its cross-border service in five years.\n\nBy comparison Wise (formerly TransferWise), a cross-border fintech, processed $33bn in the first quarter of 2023 alone. It reduces costs by doing parallel domestic transfers in place of two cross-border ones. A study by the World Bank finds that cross-border remittance costs have fallen from 7% a decade ago to 5%. And if consumers are savvy enough to use the best option (often a new-age fintech)? Transfer costs may then fall to just 3%.\n\nIn 2015 Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum and crypto\u2019s philosopher king, wrote a blog post conceding that crypto had not yet found a \u201ckiller app\u201d. Mr Buterin\u2019s post went beyond the payments and finance parts of crypto. Yet his point still rings true. Crypto will not remake the global financial system because it has proved neither efficient nor immune to regulation. Instead, a stronger candidate for digital change may be central banks.\u25a0"

        "content": "Bitcoin crushed by US dollar urfinguss\n\nMore investors backed bitcoin than the dollar as the preferred investment during a default, a Bloomberg survey found.\n\nBut gold was the top choice, due to its history as a safe haven asset and recent price gains.\n\nTreasurys were the second choice, as most expect the US would still meet its debt obligations eventually.\n\nIn the case of a US default, retail investors favor bitcoin over the dollar, underlining the token's appeal as a safe haven asset.\n\nThat's according to Bloomberg's most recent Markets Live Pulse survey, which asked investors what they would buy if the US hit its debt ceiling.\n\nTo be sure, gold led the list of responses, with 51.7% of professional investors and 45.7% of retail investors preferring bullion.\n\nIn second place came Treasurys, drawing 14% of professionals and 15.1% of retail investors. Bitcoin followed with 7.8% and 11.3%, respectively \u2014 versus the dollar's 7.8% and 10.2%.\n\nA default could arrive as soon as June 1, if lawmakers fail to lift the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling before the government runs out of money.\n\nBloomberg's MLIV survey also found that 41% expect greenback would weaken in a default, which could also accelerate de-dollarization trends.\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin rallied in an earlier period of stress this year, namely the banking crisis sparked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.\n\nPreviously, Standard Chartered told Insider that this is largely due to bitcoin's decentralized mechanism, and estimated that a default could push the cryptocurrency up by about $20,000.\n\nOther analysts told Insider that they expect gold would likely climb in a default as well. A weakening dollar could further propel the metal. Continued purchases of gold by central banks and a loosening of global monetary policy could also help support it.\n\nAs for Treasurys, UBS has previously predicted bonds would rally if the debt ceiling doesn't get resolved, as this would most likely lead to economic contraction and investors would still see US debt as a relatively safe haven.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

        "content": "So, is Bitcoin dead? If you\u2019re a cryptocurrency enthusiast, then you\u2019ve probably heard of Bitcoin. It\u2019s the digital asset that started it all, and it\u2019s been around since 2009. But lately, there\u2019s been talk about the decline of Bitcoin\u2019s value and its potential demise.\n\nShould you still invest in it? Will it ever fully recover?\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll explore the current state of Bitcoin and the crypto industry to answer these questions and more.\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nIs Bitcoin Actually Dead?\n\nThe short answer is no; Bitcoin is not dead. While it\u2019s true that the price of Bitcoin has decreased significantly since its all-time high in November 2021, it\u2019s important to remember that Bitcoin has been through bear markets before. Bitcoin has experienced several major price drops throughout its history, but it has always managed to recover.\n\nPeople might be quick to declare Bitcoin dead because they\u2019re comparing its performance to that of other major cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin is still the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, other digital assets, such as Ethereum, have been outperforming Bitcoin in recent years. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that Bitcoin is no longer a valuable asset class.\n\nShould you Still Invest in BTC?\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nThe decision to invest in Bitcoin ultimately depends on your own financial goals and risk tolerance. While the price of Bitcoin may be volatile, it can also be a valuable long-term investment. Some major companies, such as Tesla and Square, have invested billions of dollars in Bitcoin as part of their balance sheets.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the interest rate on traditional investments such as savings accounts and bonds is currently very low. This means that investing in Bitcoin or other crypto assets could potentially yield a higher return on investment. Of course, it\u2019s important to do your research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.\n\nReasons for the Decline in Bitcoin\u2019s Price\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to the decline in Bitcoin\u2019s price. One major factor is the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX, which caused a significant drop in the price of Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies.\n\nAdditionally, there have been concerns about the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, which requires a significant amount of computing power and energy.\n\nAnother factor contributing to the decline in Bitcoin\u2019s price is increased regulation in the United States and other countries. Governments worldwide are looking closer at digital currencies and how they fit into existing financial systems.\n\nWhile increased regulation can provide more stability for the crypto market in the long term, it can also create short-term uncertainty.\n\nWill BTC ever fully recover?\n\nWhile it\u2019s impossible to predict the future with certainty, Bitcoin will likely fully recover from its recent price decline. Many experts believe that Bitcoin is still in the early stages of adoption and that its value will continue to increase over time.\n\nOne reason for this is the growing interest in digital currencies among institutional investors. More and more companies are starting to view Bitcoin and other crypto assets as legitimate investment opportunities.\n\nAdditionally, the stock markets have been performing well in recent years, which could lead to more people investing in Bitcoin as a way to diversify their portfolios.\n\nConclusion: The Future of Bitcoin and the Crypto Industry\n\nSource: Reddit\n\nIn conclusion, while Bitcoin has experienced a significant decline in price in recent months, it\u2019s not dead. It\u2019s important to remember that Bitcoin has been through bear markets before and has always managed to recover. Whether or not you should invest in Bitcoin ultimately depends on your own financial goals and risk tolerance. However, Bitcoin will likely remain a valuable asset class in the long term.\n\nAs for the future of the crypto industry as a whole, it\u2019s clear that digital currencies are here to stay. While there may be short-term volatility and uncertainty, the potential for growth and innovation in this space is enormous.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a seasoned investor or just getting started, it\u2019s worth keeping an eye on the crypto market and staying informed about the latest developments.\n\nWho knows? You might find your next big investment opportunity."

Bitcoin has retreated almost 12% from a 10-month high reached last month.\n\n\"Bitcoin is a bubble. It has no inherent value and is terribly overpriced,\" Hanke, a former economic adviser to President Ronald Reagan, said in a tweet on Sunday. It's not the first time the economist has slammed the cryptocurrency - in March, he said it is a highly speculative asset, adding that \"buying bitcoin is a fool's game.\"\n\nA bubble exists when investors perceive the current price of an asset to be much more than what it should be, based on its long-term, underlying qualities. It's typically marked by a rapid escalation of an asset's price to such highs that it becomes unsustainable, causing it to collapse in value.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin has slumped to around $27,380 from a peak of more than $31,000 reached in mid-April. It rallied 88% through the first 3 1/2 months of the year amid optimism that an end was in sight to the Federal Reserve's interest-rate increases.\n\nThe token's weak performance in recent weeks came as senior cryptocurrency execs warned about regulatory stasis in the US. The Securities and Exchange Commission and other watchdogs have cracked down on major crypto exchanges including Binance and Kraken.\n\nThe collapse of crypto-friendly lenders Signature and Silvergate Capital amid the still-unresolved banking turmoil has also undermined investor sentiment in the digital-asset sector."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price broke below its 55-day resistance at $27,000 on May 12, down 12.3% in 30 days. But more importantly, it decoupled from the S&P 500 Index, which is basically flat from 30 days ago and 15% below its all-time high.\n\nBitcoin price in USD (right) vs. S&P 500 futures (left), 12-hour. Source: TradingView\n\nAs the chart indicates, for some reason, Bitcoin (BTC) investors believe that the favorable macroeconomic trends for risk markets were overshadowed by the increasing risk perception of the cryptocurrency sector.\n\nFinancial crisis could fuel Bitcoin\u2019s price increase\n\nFor starters, there\u2019s the impending United States government debt ceiling crisis, which, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, could cause an \u201ceconomic and financial catastrophe.\" The increased risk of default should, in theory, be beneficial for scarce assets, as investors seek shelter from a weaker U.S. dollar.\n\nThe $5.6 trillion commercial real estate market in the U.S. is subject to additional risks due to high interest rates and troubled regional banks. Guggenheim Partners chief investment officer Anne Walsh stated, \u201cWe\u2019re likely going into a real estate recession, but not across the entire real estate market.\"\n\nThere is also positive news on the cryptocurrency regulatory front, as the industry gathers additional support against the regulatory efforts of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed an amicus brief on May 9, defending the Coinbase exchange and accusing the SEC of deliberately creating a precarious and uncertain landscape.\n\nFurther fueling investors\u2019 hope is the Bitcoin halving expected for April\u2013May 2024, when the miners\u2019 incentive per block will be reduced from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Addresses holding 1 BTC or more reached one million on May 13, according to the Glassnode analytics firm. In total, a whopping 190,000 \u201cwhole-coiners\u201d have been added since February 2022.\n\nDespite the recent Bitcoin price weakness, there are enough drivers and potential triggers to sustain a considerable bull run in the upcoming months. Professional traders are aware of the liquidation risks associated with futures contracts, so their preferred investment strategies include options instruments.\n\nHow to apply the risk reversal strategy in Bitcoin\n\nOptions trading presents opportunities for investors to profit from increased volatility or obtain protection from sharp price drops, and these complex investment strategies, involving more than one instrument, are known as \u201coption structures.\"\n\nTraders can use the \u201crisk reversal\u201d option strategy to hedge losses from unexpected price swings. The investor benefits from being long on the call option but pays for those by selling the put. Basically, this setup eliminates the risk of the stock trading sideways and comes with limited risk if the asset trades down.\n\nProfit and loss estimate. Source: Deribit Position Builder\n\nThe above trade focuses exclusively on June 30 options, but investors will find similar patterns using different maturities. Bitcoin was trading at $27,438 when the pricing took place.\n\nFirst, the trader needs to buy protection from a downside move by buying 2.3 BTC puts (sell) $22,000 options contracts. Then, the trader will sell 2.0 BTC put (sell) $25,000 options contracts to net the returns above this level. Finally, the trader should buy 3.2 call (buy) $34,000 options contracts for positive price exposure.\n\nInvestors are protected down to $25,000\n\nThat options structure results in neither a gain nor a loss between $25,000 (down 9%) and $34,000 (up 24%). Thus, the investor is betting that Bitcoin\u2019s price on June 30 at 8:00 am UTC will be above that range while gaining access to unlimited profits and a maximum 0.275 BTC negative return.\n\nIf the Bitcoin price rallies toward $37,250 (up 36%), this investment results in a 0.275 BTC gain. Moreover, after a 42% rally to $39,000 within 45 days, net returns are 0.41 BTC. In essence, unlimited gains with a capped loss.\n\nEven though there is no initial cost associated with this options structure, the exchange will require a 0.275 BTC margin deposit to cover the negative exposure.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

River did not disclose a valuation. It last raised capital in March 2021, when it secured $12 million in a round led by Goldcrest.\n\nHeadquartered in Columbus, Ohio, River offers a range of Bitcoin-related services, including a brokerage with zero-fee recurring orders, custody, mining and a wallet that supports on-chain and Lightning Network transactions.

        "content": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 The European Union\u2019s sweeping set of beefed-up cryptocurrency rules got final approval from member states Tuesday, giving the 27-nation bloc a global lead in regulating the freewheeling sector.\n\nThe European Council adopted the package of rules \u2014 known as Markets in Crypto Assets, or MiCA \u2014 in the final step of the bloc\u2019s legislative process. European Parliament lawmakers endorsed the rules in April, and they\u2019re expected to start taking effect in phases starting in July 2024.\n\nThe tighter European scrutiny follows a spate of high profile crypto scandals including the collapse of trading firm FTX and the implosion of the TerraUSD stablecoin.\n\nThe rules are aimed at improving transparency and combating money laundering and will cover stablecoins \u2014 which are usually tied to a hard currency or a commodity like gold that make them less volatile than normal cryptocurrencies.\n\nOther digital tokens as well as bitcoin-related services such as trading platforms and digital wallets are also subject to the rules, but not bitcoin itself.\n\n\u201cRecent events have confirmed the urgent need for imposing rules which will better protect Europeans who have invested in these assets, and prevent the misuse of crypto industry for the purposes of money laundering and financing of terrorism,\u201d said Swedish Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the European Council.\n\nUnder MiCA, which has been in the works since 2020, crypto companies will need approval to operate in the EU and be held liable if they lose investors\u2019 assets. Authorities will compile a public list of \u201cnoncompliant\u201d companies.\n\nANALYSIS: Crypto companies\u2019 ties to sports raise ethical questions\n\nThe rules, aimed at maintaining financial stability, include provisions to combat market manipulation and insider dealing. Companies issuing or trading crypto assets will have to disclose information on the risks, costs and charges that consumers face.\n\nMajor crypto companies will have to reveal how much energy they use. The massive amount of energy used in bitcoin mining to create new coins has stoked concern about crypto\u2019s carbon footbprint.\n\nThe U.S. has made little progress in stepping up oversight of cryptocurrencies and digital assets, while the U.K. is considering feedback on proposed crypto regulations that it outlined last year.\n\nSome European countries, like Germany, already have basic crypto regulations."

The explosive growth came two months after the Bitcoin token fungibility protocol was created and was fueled by the growth of tokens like Ordi (ORDI), Nals (NALS), VMPX (VMPX), Pepecoin (PEPE) and Meme (MEME).\n\nWhile the new development proved exciting for many, it came with a new set of problems for the network. On May 10, CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler expressed that increased fees and a backlog of transactions have besieged the Bitcoin network because of the new token standard.\n\nMagazine: $3.4B of Bitcoin in a popcorn tin: The Silk Road hacker\u2019s story"

        "content": "The rise of fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain has brought about the introduction of the BRC-20 token standard, which is specifically designed for use with Bitcoin. Due to their interchangeability and equal worth, fungible tokens have significantly increased in popularity in the world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe emergence of fungible token standards like BRC-20 plays a vital role in the advancement of the Bitcoin blockchain. These standards open up avenues for tokenization and the creation of digital assets, expanding the range of possibilities beyond Bitcoin's role as a digital currency.\n\nBRC-20 token standard, explained\n\nThe BRC-20 token standard is an experimental fungible token standard designed specifically for the Bitcoin blockchain. But who created the BRC-20 token standard? The BRC-20 token standard was created in early March 2023 by Domo, an enigmatic blockchain analyst. The standard supports the creation and transfer of fungible tokens via the ordinals protocol. Ordi, Vmpx and Pepe are examples of popular tokens on the BRC-20 token list.\n\nThat said, the BRC-20 token standard diverges significantly from its ERC-20 counterpart by foregoing reliance on smart contracts and making use of ordinal inscriptions instead. Bitcoin ordinal inscriptions have been supported on the Bitcoin network since Jan. 21, 2023, when software engineer Casey Rodarmor implemented the protocol.\n\nThe upgrade allowed Bitcoin (BTC) users to inscribe data such as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) \u2014 which is basically code, images and text \u2014 onto satoshi tokens (ordinals). One satoshi is a fraction of one Bitcoin, and 100 million satoshis make up 1 BTC.\n\nIn contrast to token standards such as ERC-20, TRC-20 and BEP-20, where smart contracts govern crucial processes, the BRC-20 standard operates under a distinct modus operandi.\n\nIt allows JSON inscriptions to be used to program satoshis. The satoshis with the inscriptions are referred to as ordinals, which are nonfungible in nature and share similarities with nonfungible tokens (NFTs). Being nonfungible means that each orindal is unique and has distinct attributes. When it comes to programming, smart contracts are more versatile when compared to ordinals. Ordinals are limited to token minting and transfers whereas smart contracts have more use cases.\n\nAmong the key features of BRC-20 tokens is that they are fungible. This means that they are interchangeable and have equal value.\n\nWhat are the pros and cons of the BRC-20 token standard\n\nPros of the BRC-20 token standard\n\nThe BRC-20 token standard has numerous pros that have helped to propel its rise to prominence. The following is an outline of some of them.\n\nCompatibility with the Bitcoin network\n\nCompatibility stands as a defining advantage of the BRC-20 standard, as it enables Bitcoin ordinals and BRC-20 tokens to integrate seamlessly with the Bitcoin blockchain. This allows the framework to flourish due to its capitalization on the network\u2019s robustness and widespread acceptance.\n\nThis factor also allows the standard to make use of the network\u2019s existing infrastructure, such as its wallets and the exchanges that support the network, hence the rapid acceptance within the Bitcoin community.\n\nSimplicity\n\nThe BRC-20 token standard utilizes a simplified tokenization mechanism that makes it easy to use. This is unlike other token standards that rely on intricate smart contracts. It sidesteps smart contracts, which can sometimes be complex to configure. This allows users to mint and transfer BRC-20 tokens without requiring specialized technical expertise.\n\nSecurity\n\nThe BRC-20 token standard boasts exceptional security, owing to the inherent robustness of the Bitcoin blockchain, which has proven to be one of the most secure chains in the industry. Its decentralized nature, algorithmic technologies and proof-of-work consensus mechanism help fortify the system\u2019s overall security.\n\nBy utilizing the Bitcoin blockchain, the BRC-20 standard is able to capitalize on these security mechanisms to safeguard its integrity.\n\nGrowth potential\n\nAs more projects embrace the BRC-20 standard, innovation and novel use cases are bound to arise. This factor, coupled with the vast and diverse network user base, is bound to attract the attention of developers, investors and users, fostering the expansion and maturation of the BRC-20 token standard over time.\n\nCons of the BRC-20 standard\n\nWhile the BRC-20 token standard undoubtedly has numerous advantages, it is prudent to recognize that, like any other technological solution, it also has some inherent limitations. The following is an outline of some of them:\n\nNo smart contract functionality\n\nUnlike other token standards, such as the Ethereum network\u2019s ERC-20 standard, the BRC-20 standard lacks support for smart contracts. These blockchain-based snippets of code broaden the spectrum of capabilities on chains that support them.\n\nThis is because they can be configured to enhance aspects such as automation, transparency, security and asset management. As such, the absence of smart contract support in the BRC-20 standard may limit its capabilities in coming areas.\n\nDependency on the Bitcoin blockchain\n\nThe BRC-20 standard is dependent on the Bitcoin blockchain, and this subjects it to the network's intrinsic constraints. The limitations include low scalability and slow transaction speeds. These problems are set to become more prominent as BRC-20 blockchain utility increases and congestion worsens.\n\nNotably, network congestion has gotten worse since the launch of the standard, which led to an avalanche of Bitcoin ordinals. Millions of ordinal inscriptions have been created in the last couple of months, and the number continues to grow.\n\nThe development has caused transaction processing times on the Bitcoin blockchain to increase and network fees to skyrocket. Consequently, the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of BRC-20 token transfers is likely to be negatively impacted as the problem persists.\n\nLimited interoperability\n\nThe BRC-20 token standard was specifically tailored to function within the Bitcoin blockchain ecosystem. This aspect leads to interoperability challenges, particularly for users who wish to utilize alternative blockchain systems. This limitation arises due to the absence of the feature on the BTC network.\n\nInteroperability between chains is important because it facilitates seamless token transfers within the crypto ecosystem across disparate blockchain networks. This allows users to use cheaper, more efficient networks when this is convenient.\n\nLimited utility\n\nPrimarily designed for the tokenization of fungible assets, the BRC-20 standard is unsuitable for the tokenization of nonfungible assets or the implementation of complex token features such as tokenized ownership rights or conditional transfers.\n\nAs such, projects that necessitate more specialized tokenization functionalities that go beyond the BRC-20 standard\u2019s capabilities are likely to seek more feature-rich token standards.\n\nRelatively smaller developer community\n\nCompared to more popular token standards like ERC-20, the BRC-20 standard has a smaller cohort of developers. The limited size of the developer community has the potential to constrain the pace of its technological progress.\n\nHow to buy BRC-20 tokens\n\nTo buy BRC-20 tokens, it is imperative to have a Bitcoin Taproot-enabled wallet such as UniSat Wallet or Ordinals Wallet. When buying the coins via a marketplace that supports BRC-20 tokens, the wallet should be connected to the platform and ideally have funds in the form of BTC to pay transaction fees.\n\nBefore buying, it is important to compare the price of BRC-20 tokens with rates in the wider market. If the price is good, one should proceed to verify whether the seller is genuine.\n\nThis can be done by cross-verifying the wallet address balance with the balance reflected on the Unisat.io website. This is to make sure that the wallet balance is exactly the same as that of the seller. This helps to avoid scams. It is deemed safe to make the purchase once these crucial details have been confirmed.\n\nWhat\u2019s the future of the BRC-20 token standard\n\nThe ceaseless evolution of the blockchain technology industry as well as its burgeoning community and expanding user base are elements that could increase the utility of the BRC-20 token standard.\n\nAs with any technology that is open to evolution, the future of BRC-20 tokens is susceptible to the ebbs and flows of the blockchain industry and token-economy dynamics. Nonetheless, buoyed by the current frenzy, the use of the BRC-20 standard is likely to grow in the medium term.\n\nThat said, BRC-20 tokens, in their current state, have yet to establish a track record akin to that of their counterparts supported by protocols such as the ERC-20 token standard.\n\nBecause the BRC-20 standard is still in the experimental phase, BRC-20 tokens are presently not considered ripe for investment. While these tokens hold promise and demonstrate potential within the realm of blockchain-based digital assets, their evolving status necessitates a discerning approach.\n\nWritten by Elizabeth Gail"

        "title": "Are ZK-proofs the answer to Bitcoin's Ordinal and BRC-20 problem? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Bitcoin network has recently faced a litmus test due to the increased demands of Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens being inscribed onto the blockchain.\n\nThe resulting increase in fees and transaction congestion has frustrated the wider Bitcoin (BTC) community, considering some BRC-20 tokens involve memecoins that have attracted billions of dollars of capital in recent weeks.\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem has benefitted from the development of scaling solutions, which have brought massive improvements in network capacity and processing ability. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs), in particular, have grabbed headlines over the past few months, with several projects adopting the scaling technology.\n\nCointelegraph spoke exclusively to Eli Ben-Sasson, the co-founder of Ethereum-focused StarkWare and the pioneer of zero-knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge (zk-STARKS), to explore whether the technology could be the answer to Bitcoin\u2019s latest challenge.\n\nZK-proofs are cryptographic protocols that allow a party to prove a statement or data is true without revealing any information. The technology assures privacy and security while adding capacity to blockchains by reducing the computational load needed to verify transactions and other data stored on-chain.\n\nRelated: zk-STARKs vs. zk-SNARKs explained\n\nThe renowned mathematician and cryptographer credits Bitcoin for starting his journey of exploration around the promise of validity, cryptographic and zero-knowledge proofs to improve blockchain technology. Highlighting the \u201cdeeply entwined\u201d nature of the scaling solutions and blockchains, Ben-Sasson summed up the potential for ZK-proofs to benefit the Bitcoin network:\n\n\u201cValidity proofs and STARKs allow you in a very efficient way to use the integrity of math to extend the orbit of integrity that a blockchain covers to invite anyone to participate and add more capacity to the network.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s blockchain will continue to act as an inner circle of integrity, while ZK-proofs extend the origin of integrity and bring in more capacity, creating what Ben-Sasson described as a \u201cpositive flywheel\u201d effect:\n\n\u201cThe more capacity you bring, the more social functions can be used; even if it\u2019s money, you can do micropayments, or you can add new things if you allow smart contracts. And then there\u2019s more trust in the system, and it adds more value.\u201d\n\nBen-Sasson reiterated his belief that the Bitcoin network could see greater integrity and efficiency from the mathematical benefits of validity proofs. He added that Bitcoin developers Greg Maxwell, Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn had been early proponents of zk-STARK transparent proofs of validity and privacy, which do not require trusted setup and remain quantum secure.\n\nRelated: Ordinals and BRC-20 will disappear in a matter of months, says JAN3 CEO\n\nThe potential for Bitcoin \u2014 which first and foremost acts as decentralized hard money \u2014 to allow more general forms of computation and social functions remains a discussion point in its community. For Ben-Sasson, the potential of incorporating ZK-proofs is being driven by the market demand for extra functionality on top of Bitcoin by BRC-20 tokens:\n\n\u201cFor it [BRC-20] to really have the level of integrity that is offered by Bitcoin, there must be a hard fork that allows these things to be verified and validated and have the integrity of Bitcoin. And that\u2019s a huge decision and a huge debate point.\u201d\n\nAs reported by Cointelegraph, the ZeroSync Association is a newly formed startup developing ZK-proof powered tools that allow users to validate the state of the Bitcoin network without downloading the blockchain or trusting a third party for verification.\n\nZeroSync\u2019s validity proof allows users to instantly verify Bitcoin\u2019s chain state, removing the need to download over 500 gigabytes of blockchain data currently required to sync a Bitcoin node.\n\nZeroSync co-founder Robin Linus told Cointelegraph that its chain state proof does not solve network congestion directly but would remove the need for users to download inscriptions that have been clogging up the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nHowever, ZK-proofs still hold promise in helping remedy current network congestion. Linus said ZeroSync has also developed a Bitcoin client-side validation protocol dubbed zkCoins, which allows the processing of up to 100 token transactions per second:\n\n\u201cIt uses inscriptions, but the on-chain footprint is much lower than BRC-20, and it does not bloat the UTXO set.\u201d\n\nLinus added that a zero-knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) verifier on Bitcoin\u2019s main layer could enable an entire spectrum of scaling solutions, including ZK-rollups, trustless bridges to sidechains, and the potential to peg BTC onto zkCoins to enhance privacy and increase throughput:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic to see that validity proofs are gaining more traction in the Bitcoin community now. People have already started discussing a new opcode on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.\u201d\n\nLinus also noted that other Bitcoin layer-2 scaling solutions such as the Lightning Network, Fedimint and Cashu \u2014 privacy-preserving custodians based on Chaumian eCash \u2014 have seen increased interest following network congestion driven by Ordinals and BRC-20 minting.\n\nMagazine: ZK-rollups are \u2018the endgame\u2019 for scaling blockchains: Polygon Miden founder"

        "content": "Major cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) could become a top three asset in the event of a theoretical debt default in the United States, according to a new survey.\n\nAs U.S. President Joe Biden prepares to meet with Congress on May 16 to discuss the U.S. debt ceiling, investors are seeking hedges to protect their savings in the event of default.\n\nGold, U.S. Treasurys and Bitcoin would be the top three assets should the U.S. fail to raise its debt ceiling and default on its debt, data from Bloomberg\u2019s latest Markets Live Pulse survey suggests. The survey was conducted from May 8\u201312, involving a total of 637 respondents, including professional and retail investors.\n\nMore than 50% of finance professionals will buy gold if the U.S. government fails to avoid a debt default. U.S. Treasurys would be second, with Bitcoin the third most popular alternative for retail investors.\n\nData from Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse survey. Source: Bloomberg\n\nThis makes Bitcoin a more popular choice than the U.S. dollar, the Japanese yen or the Swiss franc. According to the survey\u2019s data, about 8% of professional investor respondents and 11% of retail investor respondents said they are more willing to buy Bitcoin.\n\nRelated: Circle reportedly adjusts USDC reserves to avoid US default risk\n\nThe poll comes as markets grow increasingly nervous about the U.S. debt ceiling. In early May, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that the U.S. risks a catastrophic default as soon as June 1 if the debt limit isn\u2019t suspended or raised. President Biden subsequently declared that the \u201cwhole world\u201d would be in trouble if the U.S. defaulted on its debt.\n\nAccording to the Bloomberg survey, nearly 60% of respondents said the risks are bigger this time than in 2011. Forty-one percent of respondents also believe that a default directly threatens the U.S. dollar as the primary global reserve currency.\n\nMagazine: Hall of Flame: William Clemente III tips Bitcoin will hit six figures toward end of 2024"

Yuck.)\n\n2/ Satoshi helped facilitate the Bitcoin JPEG sale.\n\nSome Bitcoin users have been upset with the rise of Ordinals (AKA Bitcoin NFTs) and have claimed that it wasn\u2019t part of Satoshi\u2019s vision\u2026\n\nWell, looks like that might be wrong.\n\nSatoshi actually helped broker the first JPEG deal using Bitcoin. Oh, how the tables have turned\u2026\n\nSecurity compliance is a long and expensive process. And let\u2019s be honest, it\u2019s not a very exciting activity.\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve partnered with Vanta \u2013 They help accelerate business growth by automating this process.\n\nIt\u2019s time to say goodbye to the countless spreadsheets and email threads \ud83d\udc4b And hello to Vanta\u2019s market-leading platform.\n\nIt allows you to automate up to 90% of compliance for SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA, and more.\n\nThe best part?

I came across this interesting chart over the weekend on Twitter.\n\nIt compares the weekly NFT volume leaderboard from 2018 to 2023\u2026\n\nThe top takeaways:\n\nNone of the projects from 2018 are in the leaderboard now\n\nIn fact, most of the projects from 2018 are dead (R.I.P)\n\nEven though it\u2019s an NFT \u201cbear market\u201d right now, the weekly volume is still 30-40x more now than in 2018\n\nIt\u2019ll be interesting to see what the 2028 leaderboard looks like\u2026 \ud83d\udc40\n\nMILK & COOKIES \ud83c\udf6a\n\nToday NFTfi launched a brand-new phase in their popular loyalty program.

Photo: PA/Alamy (MauriceNorbert)\n\nA new technology upgrade has allowed memecoins, such as Pepe Coin (PEPECOIN-USD), to be deployed on the Bitcoin blockchain for the first time, causing congestion issues and driving BTC transaction fees to a two-year high.\n\nThe upgrade enabled the creation of Ordinals, which are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin blockchain, while the BRC-20 standard facilitates the trading of memecoins.\n\nSome 14,300 BRC-20 tokens have been launched, amassing a total market capitalisation exceeding $1bn (\u00a3800m).

The technical breakdown of BTC and ETH adds to the market\u2019s worries,\u201d Mikkel Morch, chairman at the cryptocurrency hedge fund ARK36, said on Friday.\n\n\u201cDespite the challenges, there are potential catalysts for a recovery. The U.S. debt ceiling and regional banking concerns could drive interest in cryptocurrencies like BTC,\u201d Morch added.\n\nConcerns over the Bitcoin network\u2019s congestion persist, as there are currently 225,869 transactions waiting to be validated in the mempool. Meanwhile, the network surpassed 6.8 million Ordinals inscriptions, according to data from Dune Analytics, increasing block space demand on the world\u2019s first blockchain network.\n\nEther, world\u2019s second-biggest cryptocurrency, gained 1.27% to US$1,829, but lost 1.18% on the week.\n\nLitecoin was the biggest gainer of the day, rising 7.65% in 24 hours to US$87.26, bringing its weekly gains to 7.21%.

Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 strengthened 0.81% to close Monday at its highest since November 2021, driven by hopes for positive Japanese earnings reports and export-fueled buying on the back of a weak yen.\n\nInvestors are now looking forward to a raft of economic releases from China including industrial production, retail sales, and fixed asset investment data for April, after the world\u2019s second largest economy showed signs of slowing following an initial recovery from pandemic-led disruptions.\n\nThe Philippine central bank may leave its key interest rate unchanged at its policy meeting this week, Governor Felipe Medalla reportedly said, after the Southeast Asian nation raised interest rates by 425 basis points since May 2022, in one of the most aggressive tightening cycles.\n\nU.S. stock futures strengthened as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong.

        "content": "The heavily shorted U.S. dollar surged against the basket of fiat currencies last week, putting pressure on risk assets, including bitcoin (BTC). The leading cryptocurrency, however, held on to key support in a positive sign for the market.\n\nThe dollar index, which gauges the greenback's performance against fiat currencies, rose by over 1.3%, registering the biggest single-week percentage gain since February, data from charting platform TradingView show.\n\nBitcoin fell by 5.8%, living up to its reputation of being negatively correlated to the greenback. However, sellers failed to establish a foothold under the 200-week simple moving average, a widely-tracked technical line that capped the upside in February.\n\n\"By defending this key average, the bulls have convinced the market of the sustainability of the long-term bullish trend,\" Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at the FX Pro, said in an email.\n\nPer Kuptsikevich, the cryptocurrency must top $28,500 to bring in cautious buyers waiting on the sidelines for stronger evidence of an end of the price pullback. At press time, bitcoin changed hands near $27,400, up 1.4% on the day, having hit a high above $31,000 last month.\n\nSome observers expect the dollar to continue moving higher, keeping gains in cryptocurrencies under check.\n\n\" I think the dollar is due for a bounce as markets take back some FED easing implied in the futures curve. My fundamental FX framework: currencies are driven by real growth differentials and political considerations over longer cycles, but in the short term, it\u2019s all about playing relative central bank policy (changes in nominal rates). Depending on how violent the dollar upswing gets, it could cause some short-term damage to assets like commodities and crypto,\" Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets, derivatives engine at Marex, said in an email.\n\nAnalysts at Swissblock Insights voiced a similar opinion in a note to subscribers on Friday.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The DXY could hit anywhere from 104 to 107 considering it crossed over the 102 level since mid-March,\" analysts said, adding that renewed dollar strength could continue to pressure BTC as its ties to TradFi are strengthening.\n\nSwissblock Insights expects dollar index to resume downtrend after a brief bounce.\n\nPer Swissblock Technologies, the impending dollar bounce will likely pave the way for a deeper decline that would bode well for cryptocurrencies.\n\n\"This month-long structure will eventually break, and both assets will experience price discovery \u2013 bitcoin to the upside, and DXY to the downside,\" Swissblock Insights said.\n\nSolot expects a pullback in bitcoin to be short-lived, offering a \"a great entry point to position\" for investors.\n\nWallets known to hold coins for at least six months have accumulated coins during the recent bout of weakness, hinting at confidence in the cryptocurrency's long-term prospects."

        "title": "Bitcoin history shows first financial transaction was almost an NFT - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Sometimes the most noteworthy thing in non-fungible tokens isn\u2019t an NFT. A nugget of blockchain history was unearthed this weekend when internet sleuths uncovered the first documented financial transaction on the world\u2019s first blockchain. In January 2010, a user named Sabunir decided to try Bitcoin, and as a test, sold a digital picture for US$1 in Bitcoin.\n\nWas this the world\u2019s first NFT sale? No, but it is a perfect example of the use case of NFTs; preserving the provenance and ownership history of literally anything digital (not just a jpeg).\n\nThis 500 BTC jpeg sale would be worth about US$13.7 million today. Had the image been tokenized as an NFT, it would have gone down as the most significant NFT in history. If the image is recovered in the future, it would hold no value. But if it started as an NFT, the world would know exactly which copy was the original, and one lucky person would have generational wealth from it.\n\nIn the past 30 days, Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20s have turned the OG blockchain into the blockchain with the second-highest sales volume in the world. Bitcoin NFTs are just getting started and in the long run, I expect Bitcoin to compete head-to-head with Ethereum\u2019s all-time sales. It may actually exceed them too.\n\nOrdinals\n\nMythos Chain is also doing big numbers, as people are beginning to take notice of the gaming blockchain and their impressive products. I\u2019m a gamer and didn\u2019t know until recently that they have the world\u2019s largest CS:GO skins secondary market along with new hit NFL Rivals, Blankos Block Party and more on the horizon.\n\nFun fact: There is a gaming blockchain doing the 3rd most NFT volume this week.\n\n\n\nMore than Solana, Polygon, Immutable and co.\n\n\n\nFun thing is, all the volume is in CSGO skin sales which are recorded on the blockchain.\n\n\n\nSadly it's not through web3 games (yet) pic.twitter.com/udDeU7clT9 \u2014 apix\ud83c\udfae (@apixtwts) May 13, 2023\n\nAt the time of this writing, three of the top 10 collections in 24 hours are all gaming NFTs, and the biggest game makers like Square Enix, Ubisoft, Konomi and Atari are only just now beginning to touch NFTs.\n\nStory continues\n\nLots are going on outside of the NFT markets. NFT communities and those who build them are preparing to descend on the second annual VeeCon conference this week, as Gary Vaynerchuck again shows the world the pinnacle of Web3. Those who believe NFTs can function as access passes, art, and collectibles all in one are in for a treat when, what I call the State of the NFTs, kicks off at Lucas Oil Stadium on May 18. CryptoSlam will be there shaking hands and filling our brains with all of the latest happenings in NFTs. It\u2019s going to be a special time and we\u2019re hoping to get to meet some of you there!\n\nI\u2019m expecting markets to be slow while many are off networking, but we also know that degens are going to degen. Keep your eyes on cryptoslam.io, the Forkast 500 NFT Index, and our ETH, Solana, Polygon, and Cardano composites to see how the market is affected when many in the space take a break from trading."

        "content": "The process of recovering stolen Bitcoin (BTC) from cryptocurrency scams is difficult and complex. The prevalence of cryptocurrencies has led to an increase in scams and other fraudulent practices that prey on the gullible. Numerous people have suffered significant financial losses as a result of falling for different crypto scams, such as phishing, rug pulls and hacker attacks.\n\nAlthough cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized and pseudonymous structure have some benefits, they also create major obstacles for recovering stolen funds. This article will delve into the various methods and potential avenues for recovering stolen Bitcoin and explore the important factors to consider in the process.\n\nUnderstanding the landscape of DeFi scams\n\nAs already noted, there are many different types of decentralized finance (DeFi) scams, including phishing scams, rug pulls and social media scams. To trick and take advantage of gullible people, scammers use strategies such as impersonation, bogus websites and misleading investment possibilities.\n\nThese frauds have an enormous effect, leading to monetary losses, compromising personal data and diminishing confidence in the cryptocurrency sector. To avoid being a victim of fraud, it is crucial to be aware of these frauds and comprehend their strategies.\n\nRelated: DeFi Scams 101: How to avoid the most common cryptocurrency frauds\n\nThe challenges of recovering stolen Bitcoin\n\nDue to the intrinsic properties of blockchain transactions, recovering stolen Bitcoin presents a number of difficulties. These transactions\u2019 pseudonymity and anonymity make it challenging to track the flow of money and pin down the offenders.\n\nFurthermore, jurisdictional issues and the decentralized nature of blockchain technology make the recovery process more challenging. Additionally, recovering the stolen Bitcoin is extremely difficult due to the technical challenges of locating and identifying stolen money. However, the avenues discussed below may help recover stolen BTC.\n\nLegal avenues for recovery\n\nVictims of Bitcoin theft can report the occurrence to law enforcement organizations that focus on cybercrime. The likelihood of recovery is increased by collaborating closely with specialized task forces and specific cybercrime teams. Coordination across several jurisdictions is made possible by international collaboration and the presence of legislative frameworks, which speed up the recovery process.\n\nBlockchain analytics and investigation techniques\n\nBlockchain analysis is essential for retrieving Bitcoin that has been stolen. These methods and technologies aid in tracing the movement of money, locating addresses connected to the fraud, and spotting erroneous transactions.\n\nCollaborating with cybersecurity companies experienced in blockchain investigation and forensic professionals improves the chances of finding and retrieving the stolen BTC. Untangling the complications of stolen Bitcoin and maybe recovering the funds for victims is made possible by combining technological know-how and investigation techniques.\n\nThe role of exchanges and service providers\n\nThe recovery of stolen Bitcoin depends heavily on exchanges and service providers. Authorities might start the recovery process by freezing the funds linked to the scam and working with reliable exchanges. To stop unauthorized transactions and improve user protection, exchanges must put more stringent security measures in place, including multi-factor authentication and strong Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements.\n\nSeeking restitution through civil litigation\n\nCryptocurrency scam victims may pursue compensation through civil litigation. To successfully navigate the legal process, it is crucial to work with legal professionals with experience in situations involving cryptocurrencies. It\u2019s crucial to keep in mind that civil action can be difficult and drawn out, and there might be difficulties in identifying and locating the con artists or recovering the stolen funds. Depending on the jurisdiction and applicable legislation, legal remedies may vary.\n\nRelated: How to mitigate the security risks associated with crypto payments\n\nPrevention and education\n\nPrevention is the key to thwarting cryptocurrency fraud. People and organizations can better defend themselves from falling for such scams by increasing awareness and education about the hazards and typical fraudster tactics. Being a target of cryptocurrency scams can be greatly decreased by putting into use best practices for protecting Bitcoin holdings, such as using hardware wallets, updating software and exercising caution when doing online transactions."

However, BTC and other cryptocurrencies bounced sharply higher under the reasoning that blockchain-derived assets provide an alternative to the fiat currency system, which appears to be fracturing. Nevertheless, investors must beware of the logical fallacy at play. I am neutral on Bitcoin and other cryptos.\n\nTo be clear, Bitcoin certainly earned its place as a legitimate arena for speculation. Unfortunately, market participants can end up getting burned associating BTC as a viable alternative to the U.S. dollar. Instead, cryptos can help boost one\u2019s portfolio in a short timeframe, assuming entry at the right price. Such volatility and unpredictability make BTC perfect for gamblers but not ideal as a \u201csovereign\u201d currency.\n\nThe Blockchain Does Provide an Alternative\n\nIn all fairness, the blockchain certainly provides an alternative to the fiat currency system. As TipRanks contributor Reuben Jackson pointed out, while some crypto projects tied to centralized business mechanisms suffered collapses, truly decentralized networks avoided the pain.\n\nEssentially, poor (human) management can create vulnerabilities, eventually leading to insolvency. On the other hand, decentralized networks require public consensus, preventing (in theory) the materialization of incompetence. Put another way, the existence of smart individuals can prevent imprudent decisions from moving forward.\n\nHowever, such a protocol begs the basic question: what prevents incompetent or immoral individuals from forming a majority consensus?\n\nIt\u2019s an uncomfortable notion for Americans, in particular, because the U.S. education system teaches that \u201cevery vote counts.\u201d While technically true, not every voter should vote, and that\u2019s because moral equivalency does not exist for every forwarded idea. Otherwise, societies can quickly break down as vile ideologies that tickle the reptilian part of the human brain gain scale.\n\nRegarding the fiat currency system, Americans entrust financial experts to best guide monetary policy. It\u2019s not perfect. However, the blockchain alternative \u2013 to have every decision be the result of public consensus \u2013 would amount to pure madness.\n\nSo yes, Bitcoin and cryptos represent an alternative to fiat currencies. However, being an alternative alone does not make it a better solution.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Volatility Hurts Its Viability\n\nAnother reason to be careful when considering Bitcoin as an alternative to fiat-currency-based systems centers on its volatility. Given that BTC and other cryptos can accelerate (or decelerate) sharply and randomly, the possibility of life-changing returns attracts speculators. At the same time, this volatility negates Bitcoin\u2019s ability to mostly be anything other than digitalized gambling.\n\nEven more telling, intense volatility is exactly what sparked concerns with publicly-traded securities of regional banks lately. As TipRanks reporter Shrilekha Pethe pointed out, this financial subsegment incurred crypto-like volatility. Well, if volatility is such a universally desired characteristic, bank stocks should rise, not fade like they\u2019re currently doing.\n\nAs well, if Bitcoin genuinely represented an alternative to the traditional banking system, BTC should be rising amid the latest chaotic incidents in the sector. However, that\u2019s not what traders are seeing at the moment. In the trailing one-month period through May 12, the iShares US Regional Banks ETF (NYSEARCA:IAT) lost 15.5% of its market value. During the same period, BTC declined by about 8.9%.\n\nOf course, as stated earlier, the price of Bitcoin and many other cryptos jumped from early March to mid-April. Since then, the narrative has been cloudy. However, if the blockchain offered a true alternative, BTC should be rising even more as chaos in the banks accelerates.\n\nFiat Headwinds Also Impact Cryptos\n\nPerhaps the biggest fallacy associated with overenthusiasm for Bitcoin is the concept that troubles for the traditional fiat-based system spell automatic upside for cryptos. In reality, both entities bat for the same team.\n\nTo extend the baseball analogy, BTC is the batter on deck, with the game at the bottom of the ninth and two outs on the board. While Bitcoin might have a rivalry with the fiat-based system that\u2019s currently at bat, it wouldn\u2019t make sense for blockchain proponents to wish ill on the fiat system. Obviously, if the batter strikes out, the game is over.\n\nSimilarly, investors shouldn\u2019t assume that banking sector woes translate to good tidings for Bitcoin. Look, if people start losing their jobs and the economy slips into a deep recession, BTC\u2019s valuation will likely fall due to a lack of market participants.\n\nThe Takeaway: Bitcoin Does Well In Its Lane\n\nFundamentally, Bitcoin does very well in its lane. As a highly-mobile asset, very few assets come close to BTC for sheer excitement and the possibility of quick life-changing returns. At the same time, the characteristics that traders love about Bitcoin make it inappropriate as a viable alternative to the fiat monetary system. Therefore, it\u2019s better to approach BTC with a clear head and common sense rather than cute internet stories.\n\nDisclosure"

        "title": "Zhong's heist of 50000 Bitcoin gives way to new 'industrial' era in crypto crime - DLNews",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence and quantum computing are poised to accelerate cryptocurrency crime\n\nSurging number of hacks poses existential challenge to DeFi\n\n\n\nJudging by the numbers, James Zhong seems like a master crypto criminal. The 50,000 Bitcoin he stole 11 years ago from Silk Road, the dark web contraband emporium, was worth $3.4 billion by 2021. After pleading guilty in 2022, he received a 366-day prison sentence last month.\n\nYet Zhong\u2019s case is actually rather quaint when you consider his masterstroke: The 32-year-old Florida man filched Bitcoin from Silk Road by simply double-clicking on a withdrawal button. He was not so much ingenious as simply ingenuous.\n\nBad Actors\n\nThese days, Zhong would be utterly outmatched by a new generation of bad actors with far more nefarious objectives in mind, said Eric Jardine, a cybercrimes expert at Chainalysis.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a movement from your idiosyncratic individuals to larger-scale, more industrial-type operations, many of which are really traced back to state sponsorship or state cover,\u201d Jardine told DL News.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nNOW READ: Europe\u2019s rules for crypto wallets nears final showdown\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group, which US officials say is involved in financing the rogue state\u2019s nuclear missile programme, is one of those operations. Russia harbours other crypto crime rings, experts say.\n\nThese groups, along with organised crime networks, routinely plunder crypto protocols for wealth, and use them to launder proceeds from ransomware attacks that target hospitals, schools, and other public bodies.\n\nMeanwhile, lone wolves with greater expertise than Zhong prey on blockchain bridges and other vulnerable projects. The Euler bridge hack was a recent case. Even code-audited ventures such as Merlin aren\u2019t secure. The exchange lost $1.82 million after developers exploited a backdoor in the code despite having the integrity of its code evaluated by experts.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u2018There\u2019s been a movement from your idiosyncratic individuals to larger-scale, more industrial-type operations.\u2019 \u2014 Eric Jardine\n\nAs a result, the decentralised finance community is confronting questions that are becoming existential: How can crypto projects defend themselves against these foes? If billions of dollars\u2019 worth of tokens are routinely stolen, how can people trust DeFi? And law enforcement crackdowns and headlines are poised to further tarnish the DeFi brand.\n\nLucrative target\n\nBecause more attacks are coming, Jardine said, especially on blockchain bridges. They are supposed to expand the scope of the DeFi ecosystem by connecting networks together. So securing them is vital.\n\n\u201dYou have a really lucrative target, and you\u2019re probably going to be seeing a lot of targeting in the future, just on the basis that there\u2019s a lot to steal,\u201d the analyst said. \u201cThere\u2019s a chance that they\u201d \u2013 the bridges \u2013 \u201care more vulnerable than other sectors of the crypto economy, like centralised exchanges.\u201d\n\nStill, there is hope. Last September, Chainalysis helped recoup $30 million worth of tokens stolen from Axie Infinity, the blockchain gaming giant.\n\nMore than $600 million had been plundered from the Ronin Network, a sidechain built for Axie Infinity. Chainalysis traced stolen funds to offramps and liaised with law enforcement and industry authorities to quickly freeze funds.\n\nNOW READ: Fund managers still lured to crypto \u2018because of the returns\u2019\n\nIn the old days, Jardine said, hackers had more anonymity. Now the blockchain provides a permanent record of activities, making it much easier to trace assets. The former mode of crypto theft \u2013 hack some wallets, steal some funds and live large because you think no-one\u2019s ever going to catch you \u2013 is bound to be less productive these days, he said.\n\nAnd ideally, the funds wouldn\u2019t be taken in the first place. The latest defence is \u2014 what else? \u2014 AI. Protocols can deploy artificial intelligence programs that analyse source code cheaply and comprehensively far quicker than a human could. While this approach has only begun to be tested, it could provide a way forward for embattled cybersecurity devs.\n\nSecurity vulnerabilities\n\n\u201cYou run a smart contract through something like ChatGPT and try to see what it flags as potential security vulnerabilities,\u201d Jardine said. \u201cYou start to peel off the things that are vulnerable and keep the core, or revise the core so that it prevents exploitation and emulation.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s quantum computing. Researchers have long sought to harness subatomic particles to exponentially increase computing speeds, and as they move closer to workable solutions fears have mounted the new technology will tear conventional encryption to shreds.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s just a matter of time before all this gets a lot worse.\u2019 \u2014 Meera Sarma\n\nMeera Sarma, the CEO and founder of the cybersecurity firm Cystel, says industry leaders may be underestimating how rapidly quantum hacking will hit DeFi projects. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of time before all this gets a lot worse,\u201d she told DL News.\n\nThere are companies trying to work out how to defend against quantum hacking, she says. It\u2019s already possible to buy a two-qubit quantum computer, perhaps for as little as $5000. A two-qubit (quantum bit) computer is the equivalent of running four computers at once, Sarma said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how well it will work,\u201d she warned. \u201cEight- to 12-qubit is when it starts to pose a real threat.\u201d\n\nNOW READ: A wallet likely linked to Do Kwon moves $7m while crypto king in jail\n\nJardine acknowledges that quantum hacking is \u201ca massive break in terms of speed of computation, and you have to accommodate that.\u201d But he argued that a lot depends on who has the technology first, and that it will probably be \u201cthe good guys\u201d rather than a James Zhong type of character who grabs a quantum computer off the shelf.\n\nAs for the hackers themselves, Sarma said, they have similar motivations to Zhong \u2014 not just greed, but a desire to impress peers. The difference is that professional hackers want to keep their heads down.\n\nLavish spending\n\nThat\u2019s a far cry from what Zhong did.\n\nHe was a hapless nerd who morphed into an outlaw and spent lavishly on real estate and gold bars and rocked up at yachts and Miami nightclubs with glamorous women on either arm, according to the case made by federal prosecutors.\n\nHe didn\u2019t even bother to launder his loot. When police raided his home in 2021, they found a hard drive that contained thousands of Bitcoin stashed in a Cheetos Popcorn tin. And he showed off his high life in loads of social media images.\n\n\u201cHe put his head above the parapet, which is quite unusual,\u201d Sarma said. \u201cNormally what happens is that attackers are very, very subtle about the money they make. They often invest it in properties, often convert it into white money, if you will.\u201d\n\nWith the Zhong case now closed, a far more serious phase un crypto crime has begun.\n\nDo you have a tip about crypto crime or another story?

        "title": "The NSA Has Been Tracking Bitcoin Users, Snowden Papers Reveals - CCN.com",
        "content": "Not to be mistaken for another Jason Bourne thriller, the Edward Snowden papers show a US government/bitcoin connection. The Intercept is reporting classified documents leaked by Snowden prove that the US National Security Agency (NSA) in fact was keeping tabs on bitcoin users globally, as evidenced by a report that\u2019s surfaced from March 2013. The timing is curious, with the ink barely dry on an executive order signed by President Trump to ban Americans from transacting with Venezuela\u2019s Petro coin.\n\nIn true spy agency style, the report is filled with code names and numbers as well as the cataloging and cross-referencing of data that ultimately helped them to \u201ctrack down the senders and receivers of bitcoins,\u201d top secret excerpts reveal. The NSA called its bitcoin spying project Oakstar, and the initial focus of the mission was counterterrorism-focused.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t appear that the NSA was randomly targeting people. They at least appear to have been monitoring groups that were using the level of anonymity allowed by bitcoin transactions for clandestine purposes, such as money laundering activities. If you\u2019ve ever wondered what a top-secret NSA entry looks like, here\u2019s a glimpse:\n\n\u201c[NSA agent] is hoping to use the access for their mission of looking at organized crime and cyber targets that utilize online e-currency services to move and launder money. These illicit finance networks provide user access to international monetary systems while providing a high degree of anoymity.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how it went down. The NSA was seemingly able to use the sophisticated tools available to the US spy agency to collect and analyze internet data, capabilities that were bolstered by let\u2019s call it a super software program that protected the identity of users.\n\nBitcoin was one of three areas of activity that were being watched, in addition to Liberty Reserve, which has since been shuttered amid money laundering with cryptocurrencies, and one other. Even though bitcoin isn\u2019t the most anonymous cryptocurrency out there, it was the \u201cNo. 1 priority\u201d of the NSA.\n\nNetwork Access\n\nWhile the blockchain is a public ledger, the NSA didn\u2019t stop there. They apparently gained access to user computer systems, collecting information such as passwords, user sessions and a media access control address. They also seem to have captured personal info such as billing details and IP addresses. The agency was set on uncovering the connection between what they called \u201cbitcoin targets\u201d and the data they had.\n\nAs for the timing of the reveal, it could just be a coincidence. But regardless, the more that the government tries to get its grips on the blockchain movement, the more it seems to only embolden the cryptocurrency community to distance themselves further from the centralized financial system.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock."

        "content": "Keep an Eye on These Coins\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has had a middling week in terms of prices, with most tokens' values remaining flat. The market is gearing up for some big regulatory changes, especially in the U.S. A handful of tokens dominated the market in the latest week.\n\nWe examine Kava (KAVA), Bitcoin SV (BSV), Lido DAO (LDO), Rocket Pool (RPL), and Litecoin (LTC). In selecting these assets, we have considered several factors, including positive technical developments, significant news events, and noticeable changes in price.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways Kava (KAVA) jumped 48%, possibly because of the impending Kava 13 mainnet upgrade.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin SV (BSV) has risen by more than 17%, perhaps because users are switching to BSV from Bitcoin of congested trading for the latter as a result of Ordinals.\n\nLido DAO (LDO)'s price increased more than 13% as Lido DAO has posted a spike in transaction volume.\n\nRocket Pool (RPL) is up by about 11%, possibly because of the advance in ETH staking after the Shapella upgrade.\n\nLitecoin (LTC) is up by more than 10% ahead of the upcoming LTC halving.\n\n\n\nKava (KAVA)\n\nThe Kava (KAVA) project's token was one of the week\u2019s biggest gainers, with the 48% increase likely tied to the upcoming Kava 13 mainnet upgrade. The upgrade, postponed to Wednesday, will bring several improvements to the Kava network, including better performance for stakeholders and an improved capacity to send assets between Cosmos and Ethereum networks.\n\nKava is a decentralized finance, or DeFi, lending platform that describes itself as combining \"the speed and interoperability of Cosmos with the developer power of Ethereum.\u201d KAVA is trading at around $1.01, having been priced at 69 cents last week (see chart below).\n\nKAVA Price: TradingView\n\nBitcoin SV (BSV)\n\nBitcoin SV (BSV), a spinoff of Bitcoin, experienced a price increase of more than 17% in the week. There haven't been any specific developments to account for this, but one might be linked to Bitcoin Ordinals.\n\nThe Bitcoin network has become congested due to the popularity of Ordinals, a protocol that enables digital assets to be inscribed onto a satoshi. Some users may be switching to the spinoff, Bitcoin SV, as a consequence of this congestion and also because this network offers low transaction fees. BSV is changing hands at about $35.88, having traded at $30.50 last week (see chart below).\n\nBSV Price: TradingView\n\nLido DAO (LDO)\n\nLido DAO (LDO) is a project focused on ETH staking. The token's price gained by 13% after the project experienced a large increase in transaction volume.\n\nLido recorded a notable increase in activity in the first week of May, regularly receiving greater than $50 million in daily transactions during that time. LDO is priced at about $2.10, having been valued at $1.72 last week (see chart below).\n\nLDO Price: TradingView\n\nRocket Pool (RPL)\n\nRocket Pool, another project working on ETH staking, also posted a price increase. The RPL token was up by more than 11% following Ethereum\u2019s recent so-called Shapella upgrade.\n\nThis network upgrade allows ETH stakers to unstake their ETH, which is a major move that originally drew many individuals to staking. RPL is trading at around $52.75, having started last week at $47.60 (see chart below).\n\nRPL Price: TradingView\n\nLitecoin (LTC)\n\nLitecoin (LTC) had a price increase of more than 10%, with the Aug. 4 LTC halving being the most likely reason for the rise.\n\nHalving is a mechanism built in to certain blockchain protocols, including Litecoin's, and it halves block rewards. The Litecoin mechanism splits rewards every four years. This lowers the rate at which Litecoins are generated. Current Litecoin block reward is 12.5 LTC; after the halving, the block reward will be 6.25 LTC. As such, halved cryptocurrencies will become \u201crarer\u201d and this usually leads to an increase in price, as has been the case with Bitcoin halvings.\n\nLTC is now priced at $87.43, having been around $82.10 last week (see chart below).\n\n\n\nLTC Price: TradingView\n\nAs of the date this article was written, the author does not own any of the assets discussed here.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

The surge came as transaction fees on both the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks saw 3-month highs last week.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nThe number of active addresses that have sent or received funds on the Bitcoin network, meanwhile, has fallen to the lowest level since July 2021.\n\nSolana use rose amid Ethereum finality issues\n\n\"The increase seemed to start earlier in May when fees started rising on Ethereum and had people looking for other places to transact, but that second rally could also be tied to the Ethereum finality issues,\" The Block research analyst Rebecca Stevens said, noting that a similar rise in new addresses was occurring across Ethereum-scaling platforms such as Polygon.\n\n\"Solana has faced a lot of pushback over its outages, so the recent Ethereum network troubles could be putting things in perspective,\" she added, referring to two incidents last week that saw Ethereum's beacon chain briefly stop finalizing blocks.\n\nSolana's native SOL token, which saw dramatic declines last year amid the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange, has staged a recovery since, rising 109% year-to-date. While it fell 0.9% on Tuesday to $20.78, it's up 0.6% this week, according to data from TradingView."

        "content": "While the cryptocurrency industry has become a hot issue among regulators, American billionaire and hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones has said that he was going to hold on to the Bitcoin (BTC) he had purchased earlier because of the features that make it stand out from all the other assets in his portfolio.\n\nIndeed, Jones praised the finite supply of Bitcoin as its pivotal characteristic that made him decide to hold on to it for longer than any other asset, as the hedge fund billionaire explained in an interview at CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box published on May 15.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never sat on a horse that long. (\u2026) From the beginning, I always said I wanted to have a small allocation to it because it\u2019s a great tale of it, it\u2019s the only thing that humans can\u2019t adjust the supply in, so I\u2019m sticking with it. I\u2019m gonna always stick with it. It\u2019s just a small diversification in my portfolio.\u201d\n\nNotably, back in October 2022, Jones had expressed his belief that crypto assets would have a much higher value at some point in the future, especially at a time when there is too much money, thanks to their scarcity, and that this value would be far more than it was at the time.\n\nAsked by the host whether he would buy more Bitcoin, Jones said that cryptocurrencies have \u201cdone so well recently because of the fact that we have had these great risk premiums,\u201d but he did wonder \u201cwhether they may not be boring in the future.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s problem\n\nAs for Bitcoin in particular, he believes that it \u201chas a real problem because in the United States, you have the entire regulatory apparatus against it, so it\u2019s just kinda yesterday\u2019s news, and if inflation\u2019s truly done a bit, if that story\u2019s been played, then you have to wonder.\u201d In his words:\n\n\u201cWe were buying gold and Bitcoin for the inflation hedges \u2013 that game may be over. Six months ago, before AI, before the possible productivity boost that will go with it, I would\u2019ve said a completely different story with regard to the inflationary future and with regard to all the inflation hedges.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin was at press time trading at the price of $27,204, down 0.72% in the last 24 hours, as well as 1.40% across the previous seven days, adding up to the losses of 10.43% on its monthly chart, according to the latest information retrieved by Finbold on May 16.\n\nWatch the entire video below:"

        "content": "The leading cryptocurrency-Bitcoin is showing signs of bullish momentum this year, overcoming a significant decline in price during 2022. Finally, the buyers seem to be breaking free from the grasp of the sellers.\n\nWhile Bitcoin faced resistance at the $30,000 level, the market sentiment is optimistic. According to analysis of various factors, such as price structure and technical indicators, there is a likelihood of increased buying activity in the near future. This trend could lead Bitcoin to achieve new heights and perhaps reach its previous all-time high.\n\nA well-known crypto analyst, Credible, recently shared an exciting prediction with his vast Twitter following of 340.5K followers. He emphasized that the price of Bitcoin is poised to soar toward its record-breaking high of $69,000.\n\nWhile gaps are often filled- especially in choppy, corrective environments- when market conditions shift and we begin trending, gaps are often left behind until the impulse completes. If we are as bullish as I think we are, the gap at 20k may not be filled anytime soon. $BTC pic.twitter.com/w6NA1yaKQJ \u2014 CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) March 18, 2023\n\nExpressing concern, Credible has brought attention to a significant $20,000 gap, noticing that he does not anticipate it being closed in the near future. With a compelling thesis, he has caught the attention of many by highlighting the potential for BTC to reach $70K, boldly stating that the gap is unlikely to be filled.\n\nWhen asked about the order of milestones, \u201c$20,000 or $70,000+,\u201d Credible confidently states, \u201c$70,000+.\u201d This indicates his strong belief in Bitcoin reaching the ATH mark. However, amidst the ongoing market turbulence, buyers are facing consistent rejections at $30K, leading some investors to question Credible\u2019s words and hesitate to fully rely on them.\n\nCredible made it clear that buyers could find themselves in a challenging situation if Bitcoin\u2019s price goes on a sustained bull run without proper consolidation. This unexpected twist aligns perfectly with the unpredictable nature of Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cToo convenient and easy to let everyone who got rinsed over the past 6 months reload their positions and happily ride to new ATH in time with the halving.\u201d\n\nDespite already experiencing an impressive 60% gain from its 2023 low, Bitcoin\u2019s price still offers investors a significant opportunity to embark on a bullish journey with BTC. There is substantial room for growth, as current projections indicate the potential for over 150% growth from the current price level to reach the ATH region.\n\nAccording to Credible\u2019s tweet, \u201cover 70% of all $BTC in existence concentrated in wallets that didn\u2019t puke at the 3AC or FTX collapses.\u201d These holders have a historical track record of not selling substantial amounts until all-time highs are reached. This promising sign hints majority of BTC remains in strong hands.\n\nThe zig-zag price momentum is gearing up to come to a halt, with the potential for bulls to break through the $30K resistance level. An encouraging indication is that the current price is sitting comfortably above the 200-week simple moving average, signaling a strong bullish sentiment.\n\nAlthough, the Bitcoin predictions of Credible are correct to some extent, but the price rally of $40,000 points in just 7 months makes things a bit tricky."

        "content": "As Bitcoin Pizza Day approaches, the Bitcoin community finds itself embroiled in a spirited discussion surrounding one of the earliest Bitcoin transactions, speculating whether it involved the purchase of a mere JPEG.\n\nThis Twitter Space was FIRE\n\n\n\nWe discovered that:\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd25 the first purchase EVER with bitcoin was buying a JPEG for 500 BTC in Feb 2010\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd25 it pre-dates the the famous 10,000 BTC pizza\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd25 satoshi himself helped facilitate the JPEG sale\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd25 laser-eye cult in absolute SHAMBLES pic.twitter.com/b6ESOkbf0i \u2014 Udi Wertheimer (@udiWertheimer) May 14, 2023\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day, commemorated on May 22, marks the historic moment when Bitcoin (BTC) was first utilized for a commercial transaction. However, the Twitterverse is currently abuzz with a screenshot from a Bitcoin forum, fueling speculation and curiosity among enthusiasts.\n\nThe screenshot in question reveals an intriguing proposal made by a user named Sabunir back in January 2010. Eager to experiment with Bitcoin transactions, Sabunir expressed his willingness to sell a desktop wallpaper for a staggering 500 BTC, valued at approximately $5 at the time.\n\nIn his post, Sabunir provided explicit instructions for interested buyers, stating that upon sending the coins, they should send him a Private Message specifying the time of the transaction. In response, Sabunir promised to reply with a link to the coveted image, which he described as his own creation with a resolution of 1280\u00d7960, perfect for desktop backgrounds.\n\nAdding an unexpected twist to the tale, none other than Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic creator of Bitcoin, chimed in on the forum to facilitate the trade. This revelation has only deepened the intrigue surrounding the transaction\u2019s true nature and purpose.\n\nDespite Sabunir\u2019s initial enthusiasm, his offer failed to garner substantial interest after a month had passed. On February 9, 2010, a forum user by the name of SmokeTooMuch bluntly expressed disinterest in spending money on the wallpaper, causing Sabunir to question the viability of future attempts.\n\nHowever, on February 24, 2010, Sabunir\u2019s Bitcoin wallet received not one, but two transactions: one for 100 BTC and another for the astonishing sum of 500 BTC.\n\nThis turn of events has ignited a lively debate within the community. Some argue that these transactions could signify the sale of the aforementioned JPEG, potentially predating the infamous Bitcoin transaction involving 10,000 BTC exchanged for two pizzas.\n\nNevertheless, dissenting voices suggest that these transactions might have been donations rather than purchases. Adding fuel to the fire, a Twitter user claims that the initial transaction of 100 BTC was received a mere seven minutes prior to the request for donations.\n\nAmidst the fervent discussion and speculation, it appears that only Sabunir holds the key to clarifying the nature of this widely debated Bitcoin transaction. Until then, the Bitcoin community eagerly awaits his input, hoping to unravel this intriguing mystery.\n\nIn other Bitcoin-related news, it is worth noting that over 6.8 million Bitcoin Ordinals Inscriptions have been minted to date, as reported by a Dune dashboard. This innovative technology allows for the inscription of various data formats, including text, audio, and video, onto Satoshis, the smallest unit of BTC. This groundbreaking approach adds a unique and personalized touch to individual Satoshis."

        "content": "Bitcoin is on the rise, according to experts\n\nBitcoin experts have claimed cryptocurrency investors will only need to spend around \u00a3215 to become a millionaire by 2033. Analysts are sharing their thoughts on the potential value of Bitcoin within a decade\u2019s time and why they think people need to start investing now to make millions. Bitcoin is considered the largest crypto by market cap and was the first popularised version of cryptocurrency. Even with most currencies on the decline, Bitcoin started the year with a price of $17,000 (\u00a313,596.60) and is currently trading at around $27,000 (\u00a321,594.60). In light of this, crypto traders are breaking down why they believe investors should put their money into the cryptocurrency now to reap the benefits later. READ MORE: ISA alert as 'early bird' savers can avoid brutal 'tax trap'\n\nCrypto has been on the decline but Bitcoin has rallied\n\nBitcoin will be lucrative in a decade's time\n\nIt occurs around every four years and reduced the number of Bitcoins which are generated through mining by half. The last time this happened was in 2020 and many experts believe it will cause the price to surge. Mr Fares cited that the next halvings are expected to take place in 2025, 2029, and 2033. According to the entrepreneur, taking into account 2025 and 2029 are bullish years, prices are expected to range from $10million (\u00a37.9million) to $100million (\u00a379million) per Bitcoin.\n\nCrypto investors could become millionaires\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Anyone can do it, and there is no excuse for not buying this amount at today\u2019s prices even if some consider it \u2018too late\u2019 to buy into Bitcoin.\u201d However, it should be noted that halving is not the only external factor that impacts Bitcoin\u2019s value.

        "title": "5 Ways to Cash Out Your Bitcoin (BTC) - Bitcoin Australia",
        "content": "So you\u2019ve navigated the crypto market and are now holding a handsome amount of Bitcoin in your digital wallet. But how do you convert that digital currency into tangible cash in your bank account? Wondering how to cash out of Bitcoin? Here\u2019s a detailed guide on five ways you can cash out your Bitcoin.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\n1. Bitcoin ATMs\n\nBitcoin ATMs are physical machines where you can sell Bitcoin and withdraw cash. Much like a traditional ATM, a Bitcoin ATM allows you to cash out Bitcoin directly to your bank account or sometimes even to the same bank account linked with the ATM.\n\nFees and Security Considerations When Using a Bitcoin ATM\n\nBear in mind that Bitcoin ATMs come with transaction fees, which are typically higher than those associated with regular ATMs.\n\nPros and Cons of Bitcoin ATMs\n\nPros Cons Easy to use and beginner-friendly. High transaction fees. Immediate transaction. Lower security than online wallets. Anonymity if no KYC is required. Limited availability. Fiat to crypto conversion. Often have buy/sell limits.\n\n2. Bitcoin Debit Cards\n\nA Bitcoin debit card links directly to your crypto wallet, allowing you to spend your Bitcoin at traditional points of sale. When you\u2019re ready to sell Bitcoin, simply swipe your crypto debit card or scan the QR code, and the equivalent dollar value is deducted from your Bitcoin balance.\n\nFees and Security Considerations When Using a Bitcoin Debit Card\n\nUsing a crypto debit card incurs various fees, including transaction fees, withdrawal fees, and even an exchange rate when converting Bitcoin to fiat currency.\n\nPros and Cons of Bitcoin Debit Cards\n\nPros Cons Allows spending Bitcoin like fiat money. Conversion fees may apply. Wide acceptance where regular cards are used. Dependent on card issuer policies. May come with cashback or reward programs. Not fully anonymous. Simplifies crypto to fiat conversion. Could be considered a taxable event.\n\n3. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Exchange\n\nPeer-to-peer exchanges enable you to sell Bitcoin directly to other users. This form of peer to peer selling can be beneficial, especially when you\u2019re trying to sell crypto at a specific price.\n\nFees and Security Considerations When Exchanging on a P2P Marketplace\n\nAs with all transactions, selling Bitcoin on a peer-to-peer exchange incurs a fee. Always ensure the platform you choose has robust security measures.\n\nPros and Cons of Peer-to-Peer Exchanges\n\nPros Cons Allows direct trading between parties. Can be susceptible to scams. More privacy and anonymity. Transactions can take time to complete. Can support many payment methods. Less regulatory oversight. Might bypass some governmental restrictions. Lack of advanced trading tools.\n\n4. Cryptocurrency Exchange like Bitcoin.com.au\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges like Bitcoin.com.au are platforms where you can sell Bitcoin and transfer the proceeds directly to your bank account. These crypto exchanges make cashing out Bitcoin a breeze.\n\nFees and Security Considerations When Selling on a Cryptocurrency Exchange\n\nWhen you sell Bitcoin through a centralised Bitcoin exchange, you\u2019ll incur transaction fees. It\u2019s also crucial to consider the tax implications of selling Bitcoin.\n\nPros and Cons of Cryptocurrency Exchange\n\nPros Cons Wide selection of cryptocurrencies. Vulnerable to hacking. Advanced trading tools and features. May require KYC/AML procedures. Typically high liquidity. May be subject to governmental oversight and regulations. User-friendly for various skill levels. Fees can vary and may be high.\n\n5. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Trading\n\nOver-the-Counter (OTC) trading involves a broker exchange, where you can sell Bitcoin directly to a third party broker. This method is typically used for large Bitcoin transactions and can help mitigate the impact of large sales on the Bitcoin price.\n\nFees and Security Considerations When Selling Bitcoin Through Over-the-Counter Trading\n\nWhile OTC trading might avoid price slippage, it still incurs fees. These trades are typically handled by third-party broker exchanges and must comply with anti-money laundering laws.\n\nPros and Cons of OTC Trading\n\nPros Cons Suitable for large transactions. Not suitable for small investors. Doesn\u2019t influence market prices. Requires trust between parties. Provides more privacy. Can lack transparency. Might offer better rates for large volumes. Less regulated than exchanges.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency, designed to allow financial transactions without the need for a centralised authority. It\u2019s a form of digital currency that can replace traditional currencies, allowing users to trade directly with each other, \u201cpeer to peer.\u201d\n\nWhat Must I Consider Before Cashing Out my Bitcoin?\n\nExchange Fees:\n\nConsider the transactional costs and the fees of transferring the funds to your bank account. These can eat into your profits, especially for smaller transactions.\n\nTax Implications:\n\nSelling Bitcoin might lead to capital gains tax, depending on your jurisdiction. Always seek advice from a tax professional for clarity on this aspect.\n\nMarket Conditions:\n\nThe value of Bitcoin is volatile, so it can be prudent to wait for favourable market conditions before selling your Bitcoin.\n\nSpeed:\n\nThe time it takes to cash out Bitcoin varies based on the method you choose. If you need to access funds quickly, you\u2019ll need to choose a faster cash-out method.\n\nThere you have it! Five ways to cash out your Bitcoin, along with essential considerations to keep in mind. Always remember, investing in Bitcoin, or any cryptocurrency, should be done carefully, considering your financial situation and risk appetite. Happy crypto trading!"

        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum face challenges, Liechtenstein embraces BTC, and Tether reports huge profit - CityAM - City A.M.",
        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum face challenges, Liechtenstein embraces BTC, and Tether reports huge profit\n\nData from CryptoCompare shows that the price of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) started the week on a downward trend, moving from around $28,000 to a low of roughly $26,500, before it started to recover. BTC is now changing hands at $27,400.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Ether, the second-largest digital currency by market capitalization, moved in a similar way with a downward movement from $1,850 to less than $1,750, before a recovery started to take it to the $1,830 mark.\n\nHeadlines in the cryptocurrency space this week varied, with some of the most significant surrounding congestion on the Bitcoin blockchain and glitches on the Ethereum network. Bitcoin\u2019s congestion, partly driven by the growing popularity of its non-fungible tokens (NFTs) Ordinals, saw leading exchange Binance briefly halt BTC withdrawals before adjusting withdrawal fees.\n\nWe've temporarily closed #BTC withdrawals due to the large volume of pending transactions.\n\n\n\nOur team is currently working on a fix and will reopen $BTC withdrawals as soon as possible.\n\n\n\nRest assured, funds are SAFU. May 8, 2023\n\nThe exchange revealed at the time it will keep on monitoring on-chain activity and \u201cadjust accordingly if needed.\u201d It also added it\u2019s working on enabling BTC Lightning Network withdrawals, which would alleviate such situations in the future.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s congestion comes at a time when liquidity has seemingly started dropping. According to CCData\u2019s Order Book data, Bitcoin\u2019s capacity to accommodate sizable orders without substantial price fluctuations has diminished since 2023.\n\nPer the data, the amount of BTC needed to change the price by 1% dropped from 1,400 ($23 million) in January to 462 ($13 million) in April.\n\nWhile Bitcoin suffered from congestion, an unexpected disruption occurred on Ethereum that saw the network become temporarily unable to fully authenticate transactions. The hiccup only lasted 25 minutes and while blocks were being proposed, they were not being finalized.\n\nParticipants using the blockchain noticed that their transactions were seemingly processing as usual, but during the 25-minute stretch of irregularity, these transactions were susceptible to being altered because of the malfunction.\n\nLiechtenstein to accept Bitcoin for state services\n\nLiechtenstein\u2019s Prime Minister and Finance Minister Daniel Risc has revealed that the country will soon allow Bitcoin payments for state services, which will be instantly converted to Swiss francs, its official currency.\n\nHe also expressed interest in investing some of the state\u2019s reserves, which amount to 2.23 billion francs (about $2.51 billion), in cryptoassets in the future. The country, which has no debt, saves three times its annual budget of 900 million francs (around $1 billion) and invests it in securities.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) National Security Division is said to be investigating cryptocurrency exchange Binance for allegedly allowing Russians to use its platform in violation of US sanctions.\n\nThe company and its executives have not been accused of anything related to the investigation, which is part of a national security probe and a criminal division investigation. Binance restricted its services in Russia after sanctions were imposed on the country in April 2022.\n\nHowever, according to a company executive, the exchange continued operations, blocking only certain areas of Ukraine no longer under government control and servicing non-sanctioned individuals.\n\nThe investigation comes at a time in which Binance has seen its spot trading volume suffer a 48% fall last month, marking the second consecutive month of declines for the cryptocurrency trading platform.\n\nAccording to CCData\u2019s latest Exchange Review report, Binance\u2019s trading volume dropped to $287 billion last month, recording its second-lowest monthly trading volume since 2021\n\nOver the week two of the world\u2019s top market-making firms, Jane Street Group and Jump Crypto, have also chosen to scale down their cryptocurrency trading operations in the United States as regulators crack down on the industry.\n\nJane Street has been in the crypto market since 2017 while Jump Crypto, the crypto division of Jump Trading, is shrinking its US presence while growing its operations abroad. Both firms still operate as market makers on a smaller scale, and haven\u2019t completely stopped their crypto activities.\n\nNotably, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a formidable force in American corporate advocacy, has taken up arms for digital asset industry players who have been vocally critical of U.S. regulatory approaches.\n\nThe Chamber has thrown its considerable weight behind the legal challenge brought against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Coinbase, which came as Coinbase asks the SEC to clarify its rules for the industry.\n\nTether reports $1.5 billion profit\n\nLeading stablecoin issuer Tether has recently disclosed a Q1 net profit of $1.5 billion, a figure that more than doubles its 2022 performance from the same period. As of May 9, the company\u2019s consolidated total assets were approximately $81.8 billion, while its consolidated liabilities amounted to $79.4 billion.\n\nIn a groundbreaking step, Tether, the entity responsible for USDT, has expanded its reserves report to include new categories. This marks the first instance of the company openly declaring its investment in bitcoin, physical gold, overnight repo, and corporate bonds.\n\nThe disclosed holdings include $1.5 billion in bitcoin and a substantial $3.3 billion in precious metals, which are likely being used to back Tether\u2019s gold-backed cryptocurrency, Tether Gold (XAUT).\n\nWhile Tether is reporting significant profits, crypto exchange Bittrex filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the District of Delaware. The exchange estimated it had more than 100,000 creditors, between $500 million and $1 billion in assets, and between $500 million and $1 billion in liabilities.\n\nFrancisco Memoria is a content creator at CryptoCompare who\u2019s in love with technology and focuses on helping people see the value digital currencies have.

        "title": "Crypto market\u2019s focus remains on Memecoins as Bitcoin stabilizes around $27,000 - Nairametrics",
        "content": "Article Summary\n\nBitcoin and major altcoins remain rangebound as the market focuses on meme-coins, leading to soaring transaction fees on the Bitcoin blockchain and causing Binance to halt withdrawals twice.\n\nMilady (LADYS), a meme-coin, surged by over 5,250% within 24 hours and has a total diluted market capitalization of over $140 million, despite having \u201cno intrinsic value or expectation of financial return.\u201d\n\nBitcoin spot volumes are down 24% over the past week, and open interest surged by 5.3%, reaching a new 1-month high with below-neutral funding rates indicating that pessimists were the key aggressor.\n\nBitcoin remains rangebound and has now traded in the $27,000 mark for three consecutive Tuesdays. Bitcoin\u2019s prolonged directionless pattern has impacted most major altcoins as well, whose pattern reflects that of BTC. As conditions remain stable, the market has re-rotated its focus to memecoins, which has often tended to be a negative market impulse, suggesting an over-eager risk appetite.\n\nThe Wednesday FOMC press conference last week delivered in line with expectations, as the Target Rate was hiked by 25bps. Jerome Powell also indicated that interest rates were at appropriately restrictive levels. Nonetheless, he also added that further interest rate decisions would be data-driven.\n\nNon-farm payrolls (NFP) surprised to the upside last week, leading the market to price in an 18% chance of a further hike in the next FOMC press conference. All eyes are now focused on Wednesday\u2019s CPI release, which is expected to be a potential volatility catalyst. If the CPI were to surprise to the upside, it could lead the market to reprice hiking expectations for the June 14 FOMC press conference.\n\nWhat You Should Know\n\nOver the past week, particularly over the weekend, Bitcoin on-chain fees surged, causing Binance to halt withdrawals twice. The withdrawal halt also coincides with an apparent arbitrage erupting on Binance US, with Binance US trading at a 3-5% premium above the rest of the market.\n\nThis premium may be caused by market makers leaving the exchange and potential fiat-rail problems disincentivizing traders to take advantage of the ongoing arbitrage opportunity.\n\nThroughout the past week, transaction fees on the Bitcoin blockchain have skyrocketed as the mempool has experienced proper congestion. The congestion originates from the rising popularity of BRC-20, a token standard built on Bitcoin, allowing participants to create and send tokens via the Ordinals protocol.\n\nOrdinals has gradually amassed popularity this year, initially as a means to produce NFT-like assets enabled by the Taproot soft fork in 2021 and Segwit in 2017. Up until now, Ordinals have had a negligible impact on the market, but as of today, the market capitalization of BRC-20 tokens now stands at over $500 million.\n\nOrdinals have clogged the Bitcoin network, leading fees to soar. Over the weekend, at least one Bitcoin block saw fees surpass the block subsidy, and on Sunday, transaction fees represented 32% of the miner revenues, a level not seen since December 2017.\n\nAmidst the soaring fees, Binance disabled BTC withdrawals for two 2-hour periods and reshuffled wallet balances, leading to growing fear in the market.\n\nThe rally in the market comes as investors now turn their focus on meme coins. Asides from Pepecoin, another memecoin has gone viral, getting a boost from no other than Elon Musk, the self-proclaimed Dogecoin chief.\n\nOn May 11, Milady (LADYS), the self-organized memecoin of the namesake anime avatar nonfungible tokens (NFT) collection, surged by over 5,250% within 24 hours to trade at a $0.0000001528.\n\nThe day prior, American business magnate Elon Musk tweeted a meme using the imagery of a Milady NFT, sending the average Ether sale price of the collection soaring. According to token developers, LADYS has \u201cno association\u201d with Milady creator Charlotte Fang or Milady Maker.\n\nThe token \u201cis simply paying homage to an NFT collection we all love and recognize. LADYS is a meme coin with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. There is no formal team or roadmap. The coin is completely useless and for entertainment purposes only.\u201d\n\nHowever, investors have found LADYS to encompass more than just meme value. At the time of publication, the total diluted market capitalization of the token surged past $140 million with a 24-hour trading volume of $230 million.\n\nAccording to the token\u2019s website, the total supply of LADYS is 888 trillion. The website further explains, \u201c94% of the tokens were sent to the liquidity pool (LP). LP tokens were burnt, and the contract is renounced.\u201d\n\nThe open interest held by active market participants on CME fell to a 14-month low on May 2 at 22,132 BTC, with active market participants representing 35% of the total open interest on CME.\n\nThe active market participant contribution has increased since, currently representing 38% of the open interest. Still, the open interest and active market participation rate reign low as institutional activity remains slow in BTC.\n\nThe market as a whole has been heavily rangebound throughout the past month, with Large Caps still outperforming the other indices and BTC on the backdrop of Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade outperformance.\n\nBitcoin spot volumes are down 24% over the past week. This trend is historically consistent with a period of price consolidation following large price movements, as we had in March. Currently, many market participants are likely in a wait-and-see phase.\n\nOpen interest surged by 5.3% last week, climbing above 280k BTC, reaching a new 1-month high. As highlighted earlier, the growth in open interest was accompanied by below-neutral funding rates, indicating that pessimists were the key aggressor.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Bitcoin price has ranged for nearly 2 months. The price has been quite volatile within the range, but there has been no material price action. Smaller price movements have led to lower realized volatility.\n\nThe market expectations tend to be backward-looking, leading implied volatility to fall as well. In sum, the market currently is in a directionless slumber state waiting for the next spark to lead the way.\n\nFunding rates have also fallen amidst BTC\u2019s push below $28k, suggesting cautious positioning with BTC fluctuating at range lows. Amidst last week\u2019s surge in open interest, perp prices lagged behind the spot, indicating that the primary force behind the rally above $26,000, is a result of growth in leverage originating from shorts."

Source: Finbold\n\nMeanwhile, a recognized pseudonymous crypto analyst El_crypto_prof, also known as Moustache, revealed that Bitcoin\u2019s price action followed a trend of higher highs and higher lows that often led to a parabolic rally, implying it could achieve a new all-time high (ATH) before 2025.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
