        "title": "Fort Worth was the first city to adopt bitcoin mining to attract attention. Was it worth it? - Fort Worth Report",
        "content": "A year ago, Fort Worth Mayor Mattie Parker joked the city was now \u201ccowtown and cryptocurrency\u201d after plugging in donated bitcoin mining machines. That news generated millions of web impressions across the world, a nominal amount of money and attracted a blockchain summit to the city.\n\nSince the peak of the industry\u2019s hype in 2021 and the city\u2019s adoption of the machine, the cryptocurrency market lost more than $2 trillion in 2022. Startups, job postings and venture capital fundraising around the crypto industry have also dropped.\n\nFort Worth city officials are leaving the machine donated by the Texas Blockchain Council running, despite the hype around the industry slowing down. The city will not disclose the amount of money it takes to keep the machine running.\n\n\n\nFort Worth first adopted two bitcoin machines in April 2022, becoming the first city to mine bitcoin. Quinn PR crafted a media campaign to promote Fort Worth\u2019s tech-friendly leadership. The media attention generated more than 752 million web impressions in six months, according to the city. Headlines in national news outlets, such as USA Today, read: \u201cFort Worth, Texas becomes first in the US to mine bitcoin: \u2018Where the future begins.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn interviews with major TV news outlets, Parker said the pilot project was about making the city at the forefront of tech and innovation.\n\nWhat\u2019s bitcoin? What\u2019s mining? Bitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency, a digital currency that is not backed by an establishment such as a bank. To make sure each bitcoin transaction is verified, machines in a network compete to solve a complicated math problem. If the machine solves it first, it becomes the official record of the transaction. A bitcoin is given in exchange as an award to the first miner that solves the math problem. This process is called mining.\n\n\u201cWe want to be at the forefront of this industry, and understand that cryptocurrency is synonymous with innovation right now across the United States, really across the world,\u201d Parker said in an interview on CNBC when the project was announced.\n\nCritics of the crypto industry cite concerns about the machine\u2019s energy consumption in a state with a fragile power grid. The Texas Blockchain Council, the industry association that donated the three machines, and city officials maintained the machines take up the same amount of energy as a vacuum cleaner.\n\nTwo months later, the city traded the machine for a more energy-efficient machine. Carlo Capua, chief of strategy and innovation at the City of Fort Worth, recommended keeping the machines going at a city council meeting last November. The miner running in the city\u2019s server room has generated nearly $2,000 after electricity costs since being plugged in, Capua said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe goal wasn\u2019t to make money, that wasn\u2019t the primary objective,\u201d Capua said. \u201cIt was for people to know about the city, know that Fort Worth is a dynamic, forward-thinking city and doing innovative things that no other cities have done. So in that sense, it\u2019s been very successful.\u201d\n\nThe mining machine is profitable every month, Capua said, but he declined to provide the total energy cost since it was plugged in. The machine, a Bitmain S19 J Pro, takes 2,950 watts to operate. The city runs the machine 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur rate with our energy provider is confidential, so I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t share the total electricity cost as it would be easy for someone to reverse engineer our rate,\u201d Capua wrote in an email.\n\nOne tangible result of the pilot program is the Texas Blockchain Council moving its Texas Blockchain Summit from Austin to the Fort Worth Convention Center in November. Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, said the council decided to move the summit because of the city\u2019s friendliness to the industry. He expects more than 1,000 attendees at the summit, which occurs Nov. 15-17.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really excited about that and excited for what that means for the city and for the leap of faith that Mayor Parker took when she decided to do this initiative,\u201d Bratcher said.\n\nA tumultuous year for the crypto industry\n\nFort Worth\u2019s mayor wasn\u2019t alone in following the crypto hype, Tonantzin Carmona, a David Rubenstein Fellow at Brookings Metro, said.\n\nNew York City\u2019s Mayor Eric Adams announced his first paycheck would be converted to bitcoin and ethereum in 2022. Austin business leaders and officials also tried to draft resolutions to make the city a hub for cryptocurrencies and blockchain. In Miami, the mayor endorsed a city-branded coin, only for it to drop 95% in price.\n\nMayors and local leaders are under pressure to innovate, create new economies and bolster existing ones, Carmona said, and it makes sense to look to technology and innovation as potential ways to spur economic growth. But leaders need to do their due diligence to weigh the pros and cons of the industry.\n\n\u201cAssessing, one, is it even right for our economy?\u201d Carmona said. \u201cDo we have a strategy around this? Do we have an existing infrastructure or ecosystem of other types of \u2026 industry that can help support this new industry or technology that we\u2019re trying to bring to our local economy?\u201d\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry had a tumultuous year. Toward the end of 2022, the crash of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s crypto exchange, FTX, sent crypto values spiraling.\n\nAn analysis by Brookings Metro found job postings with crypto skills dropped since the peak in early 2022, including in the Dallas and Fort Worth area. Crypto startup growth also fell. Carmona, the author of the study, said most of the crypto jobs happened in places that were already tech hubs.\n\nThe city purposely took a more cautious approach to crypto than Miami\u2019s \u201cfull-throttle\u201d approach, Capua said. The city does not endorse the crypto industry \u2013 or any industry, Capua also said. He doubts cryptocurrency will ever replace the dollar, but he still thinks the pilot project was worth the time.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think the smart way to \u2026 investigate innovative technology is to do it in small steps,\u201d Capua said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nThe mining machine, Capua said, continues to keep the city relevant. He gives anecdotes of visitors traveling to City Hall asking about the machine. He still mentions the machine when talking to people about innovative things the city is doing, and still gets requests for updates.\n\n\n\nCarmona, however, remains skeptical about the impact of the pilot project and the accomplishment aside from literal attention. She said cities need to think about whether industries are speculative or have well-documented productive activity and potential.\n\n\n\n\u201cCryptocurrencies, when you invest in them, aren\u2019t tied to a company\u2019s revenue profit, a company\u2019s growth,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just based on whether people believe that it\u2019s going to rise in value or not.\u201d\n\nMattie Parker was unavailable for an interview at the time of publication, but said in a statement that local leaders have to embrace out-of-the-box ideas in the community to fuel innovation. Parker wrote that the city is continuing to build on the mindset of expanding what\u2019s possible in the city with the Techstars Physical Health Fort Worth Accelerator, Texas A&M-Fort Worth\u2019s Research and Innovation Building and Alliance\u2019s Mobility innovation zone.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing Fort Worth transform into a hub for technology, and it\u2019s not just because of the pioneering spirit of our entrepreneurs, but also because City Hall has a vested interest in helping them be successful,\u201d Parker wrote. \u201cThis program is just one example of how we\u2019re looking to expand the conversation about what is possible in Fort Worth.\u201d\n\nThose involved in the crypto industry, like Bratcher, say the crypto market has ups and downs like the oil and gas market. The industry is still recovering, but Bratcher believes crypto is on the upswing.\n\n\u201cJust like there have been tumultuous times in other innovative technologies throughout history, the amount of economic growth that this industry is going to inject will be far greater than \u2026 some of the challenges that we experienced this year moving forward,\u201d Bratcher said.\n\nThe mining machine will continue to run until the machine becomes obsolete or the City Council votes to stop the machine, Capua said. He\u2019s shifting gears to other projects, like efforts to attract businesses from outside the U.S. like Japan to establish business in Fort Worth. He\u2019ll be working with cities such as Dallas and Arlington to figure out transportation solutions as the World Cup in Arlington approaches in 2026. He also said there are a couple of development projects he can\u2019t talk about yet.\n\n\n\nThe city created Capua\u2019s position last year, and he said there are a lot of possibilities beyond adopting new technology.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new position,\u201d Capua said. \u201cSo to be quite honest, a lot of it, I\u2019m looking for opportunities, where we haven\u2019t really spent a lot of time.\u201d\n\n\n\nSeth Bodine is a business and economic development reporter for the Fort Worth Report.

        "title": "Cryptocurrencies fall to open August, bitcoin dips under $29,000 - CNBC",
        "content": "The crypto market came under pressure as the new month kicked off, with investors weighing the risks of the latest DeFi hack and another federal court decision on when to treat crypto assets as securities.\n\nOn Tuesday, bitcoin was little changed at $29,271.90, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier in the day it briefly fell to about $28,800. It ended July down 3.93%.\n\nEther , which has joined bitcoin in recent months as a sort of large cap, blue-chip trade in crypto, also cut its Tuesday losses and was last down by 0.5% at $1,850.17, after finishing July lower by 3.35%. It was under extra pressure due to a recent exploit in DeFi giant Curve, however.\n\n\"Ethereum is sort of the king of DeFi and Curve is viewed as one of the most important liquidity providers in DeFi,\" said Josh Gilbert, an analyst at investment firm eToro. \"[Ethereum] is a massive project so it's not going to come under as much pressure as smaller alts but that Curve issue is ultimately the reason we're seeing weakness in Ethereum right now.\"\n\nAltcoins fell after a federal judge said some crypto assets are securities regardless of the context in which they are sold. This opinion contradicted an earlier ruling from the same district court that said Ripple's XRP may not be categorized as a security in all circumstances. XRP was last down 1.5%, having also recovered earlier losses.\n\nOther tokens named in the recent SEC lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase as potential securities inched closer to unchanged after being under pressure earlier, including those tied to the Solana and Cardano networks, which at one point fell more than 2%.\n\nDeFi giant hacked\n\nOther smaller coins, specifically in the DeFi segment of the market, recovered losses, too. CRV, the native token of Curve Finance, a stablecoin-focused decentralized exchange, was up 8% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. Aave cut its 9% loss in the same period and was little changed, while the tokens tied to Compound and the Synthetix network were down 5% and 4%, respectively.\n\nCurve, a stablecoin exchange built on Ethereum, was exploited Sunday due to a bug in the smart contract programming language called Vyper. The hacker targeted three liquidity pools for tokens paired with ether and CRV as well as several ERC-20 tokens issued on Alchemix (alETH), Metronome Synth (smETH) and JPEG'd (pETH). It drained as much as $100 million worth of cryptocurrency from the platform, including $20 million of CRV and a version of ether, according to CryptoQuant.\n\n\"We've unfortunately had this scenario in crypto a few times over the past 12 to 18 months. Whenever investors hear the word hack ... it puts the whole crypto market on the backfoot and that's what's happening here,\" Gilbert said.\n\nBitcoin volumes have also dropped significantly from their recent highs, despite the price of bitcoin proving so resilient this year. It traded in a tight range throughout July, neither breaking above a key level of $31,500 nor below $25,200, and has soared 76% in 2023.\n\n\"We had a lot of buzz recently around the Blackrock ETF but that can only drive bitcoin for so long and for so far. We got plenty of optimism with it but that initial optimism is fading slightly,\" Gilbert said. \"When bitcoin heads south so do most altcoins ... and they're selling off a little bit further given what we're seeing with Curve.\""

        "content": "MicroStrategy Inc., the enterprise-software maker that is the largest publicly-traded holder of Bitcoin, returned to profitability in the second quarter after having to take a large writedown a year earlier because of a plunge in the value of the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe Tysons Corner, Virginia-based company had net income of $22.2 million, or $1.54 a share, compared with a loss of more than $1 billion, or $94 a share, in the year-ago period.\n\nThe company, controlled by Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue estimates, with sales dropping 1.4% to $120.4 million. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected $123.2 million. The firm recorded digital-asset impairment losses of $24.1 million.\n\nMicroStrategy acquired about $361.4 million in Bitcoin during the second quarter, the company\u2019s largest purchase since prices peaked in late 2021. That brought MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin purchases to around $4.53 billion. The company bought 467 more tokens since June 30, according to a statement Tuesday. As of July 31, the company held 152,800 Bitcoin.\n\nIn a filing Tuesday, MicroStrategy said it may raise as much as $750 million via share sales and use the proceeds for general corporate purposes \u2014 including Bitcoin purchases and working capital \u2014 as well as the repurchase of debt.\n\nSaylor began buying Bitcoin in 2020, citing the need to reduce the company\u2019s holdings of cash because of the perceived eroding threat of inflation. The shift came as revenue from the software business stagnated. Saylor gave up his chief executive officer title a year ago, saying he would focus on the Bitcoin aspect of the company\u2019s dual strategy.\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s operations are still unprofitable, having booked a quarterly operating loss of $26.7 million in the quarter. The company has over $700 million in deferred tax benefits from prior writedowns of its Bitcoin holdings. Now that Bitcoin has recovered in value, the company has removed a valuation allowance against the tax assets.\n\nPhong Le, who took over as CEO when Saylor shifted to executive chairman, said on a conference call Tuesday that the company\u2019s chief revenue officer resigned and he has assumed those responsibilities.\n\nBitcoin closed the second quarter up 7% to $30,390, building on a first-quarter surged of almost 72%. In last year\u2019s second quarter, the largest digital currency by market value had tumbled 59% to $18,731.\n\nBitcoin rose as much as 2.8% on Wednesday and was trading at $29,715 as of 11:30 a.m. in Singapore.\n\nShares of MicroStrategy, which serve as a Bitcoin proxy for many equity investors, was little changed at around $434 after the close of regular trading. They\u2019ve more than tripled this year, after tumbling 74% in 2022. The stock soared as high as $1,315 in February 2021."

        "title": "Bitcoin is a boon to ESG: KPMG - Blockworks",
        "content": "Professional services firm KPMG is out with a new report that strikes a surprisingly friendly tone toward bitcoin and its impact on the environment.\n\nThe Big Four accounting firm\u2019s ultimate conclusion was that Bitcoin \u201cappears to provide a number of benefits across an ESG framework\u201d through stabilizing energy grids, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and providing sustainable heat for commercial and residential properties.\n\nESG, or environmental, social and governance, is a metric that defines how companies and their activities impact the world. Some investors may look at corporations\u2019 ESG scores to screen out stocks that don\u2019t meet their standards of social responsibility.\n\nThe report\u2019s authors point out that despite the network using a considerable amount of energy, Bitcoin doesn\u2019t expel direct carbon emissions. It does, however, run on electricity, the cost of which is always at the top of mind for individuals or companies mining bitcoin (BTC), KPMG claimed in the report.\n\nTherefore, miners are \u201cconstantly searching for the lowest cost sources of electricity, which is often tied to under-utilized hydro, wind or solar,\u201d KPMG wrote.\n\nThis statement bears out among even the biggest mining companies.\n\nBlockworks reported in July that Bitfarms is using hydroelectric power from dams to juice its rigs in Paraguay. Likewise, Back in 2021, Blockstream partnered with Jack Dorsey\u2019s Square to build a solar-powered bitcoin mine in Texas.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin\u2019s critics don\u2019t often focus on the sources of energy miners use. Usually, they\u2019re focused on the amount of energy used.\n\nThat was the rationale behind the proposal from the administration of US President Joe Biden to levy a 30% tax on electricity used up by bitcoin miners. The White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisors argued that the tax would encourage \u201cfirms to start taking better account of the harms they impose on society\u201d and the environment.\n\nKPMG pushed back on that view, citing a Harvard Business Review article that said Bitcoin accounts for roughly 0.55% of the world\u2019s electricity consumption \u2014 similar in scope to how much energy tumble-style laundry dryers use.\n\nRead more: Latest use for bitcoin mining rig heat: Laundry\n\nThe Bitcoin Mining Council, an industry group, claimed in a 2022 fourth-quarter report that Bitcoin\u2019s global share is just 0.17% of the world\u2019s energy production.\n\nThe KPMG report also delved into the nuances of energy grid function, particularly with renewable energy sources like solar and wind.\n\nThe issue with solar energy, the reported contends, is that it\u2019s only available during the day, and wind is variable.\n\n\u201cRenewable energy facilities are incentivized to produce at their maximum capacity to deliver electricity in a manner consistent with their contractual agreements,\u201d the report says. \u201cThis can leave utilities with an excess supply of electricity, which if coupled with a supply and demand mismatch, can lead to low, and even negative, electricity prices.\u201d\n\nBitcoin miners can set up anywhere and often have the luxury to locate near renewable energy sources. Additionally, they can adjust their power consumption during times of excess supply and/or low market demand.\n\nBitcoin miners can actually \u201cprovide additional incentive to the buildout of renewable energy capacity,\u201d the report\u2019s authors argued.\n\nKPMG\u2019s report also highlighted the ways in which Bitcoin mining could improve sustainability and limit pollution.\n\nFor instance, it mentioned how mining rigs generate a significant heat byproduct while they\u2019re running.\n\nIn June, Blockworks reported on a Brooklyn spa that used miners to warm up their pools, a phenomenon that got plenty of social media buzz at the time.\n\nBeyond Bitcoin\u2019s ability to power hot tubs, KPMG claims there\u2019s a real possibility for Bitcoin to limit the amount of methane pollution, a greenhouse gas that is more than 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide.\n\nA way to limit methane\u2019s damage potential is through a process called gas flaring, which entails burning the gas before it can go directly into the atmosphere. KPMG once again cited the Harvard Business Review article, which claimed there is enough flared natural gas in the US and Canada alone to power the entire Bitcoin network.\n\nMarathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel told Blockworks in May that the government should be doing more to tackle methane emissions and that bitcoin mining companies are the \u201cperfect\u201d partner in that fight.\n\n\u201cGive people incentives to convert methane gas into something less volatile,\u201d Thiel said. \u201c[Bitcoin miners] can set up operations at landfills where they can\u2019t sell the electricity, where they can\u2019t convert it into natural gas, and take that methane that\u2019s seeping out into the atmosphere and convert it to carbon dioxide.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nKPMG reports Bitcoin is better for the environment than gold and tourism\n\nBitcoin miners prefer renewable energy\n\nWhat was Elon Musk thinking?\n\nA report released by KMPG, one of the world\u2019s main services network adjacent to the likes of PWC, highlights the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining. The study uses data from Harvard Business Review, showing that Bitcoin mining has a minuscule environmental impact compared with the fashion and gold mining industries.\n\nBitcoin Mining Is Not The Worst For The Environment\n\nSome may remember Elon Musk removing Bitcoin as a payment option from his flagship company Tesla. At the time, he claimed that Bitcoin mining was incredibly bad for the environment, adding, \u201cWe are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.\u201d\n\nThis came at a time when Tesla offloaded most of its Bitcoin deposits, which led the flagship cryptocurrency to take a dive in price.\n\nHowever, KPMG\u2019s report shows that Bitcoin mining has far fewer consequences on the environment compared to other industries, such as fashion, gold mining, and, most certainly, automobile manufacturing.\n\n\u201cBitcoin mining industry has become extremely competitive. Under this competitive landscape, miners are incentivized to streamline their operations and carefully manage production costs.\n\nAs electricity is the largest ongoing input cost affecting operations, miners are constantly searching for the lowest cost sources of electricity, which is often tied to underutilized hydro, wind, or solar,\u201d according to KMPG\u2019s report.\n\nAccording to an article by the World Economic Forum, \u201cCrypto mining can be a catalyst or market driver for new renewable energy projects.\u201d The article also claims that \u201cIt is this symbiosis of crypto computer farms and remote green energy projects which offers the potential for mutual benefits \u2014 and it may not stop with rural projects.\u201d\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin Mining?\n\nKMPG\u2019s report states that \u201cBitcoin uses a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which is the process of adding transactions to the blockchain by being the first to solve a mathematical problem via computation. This math problem involves repeatedly hashing a block of transactions until a specific output is achieved.\n\nHashing is the process of taking any string of text as an input and converting it to a fixed-length alphanumeric output.\n\nGiven that this is a one-way function, it means that the same input will always result in the same output, but the input cannot be determined with the output alone. Solving this math problem is essentially trying to find a needle in a haystack.\n\nMiners who solve the puzzle first are awarded freshly minted Bitcoin (currently 6.25 Bitcoin per block) as well as any transaction fees which currently account for about 2-3% of miner revenue\u201d\n\nIn a nutshell, Bitcoin miners use their computing power to solve mathematical problems in order to gain Bitcoin blocks on the chain as a reward."

        "title": "Bitcoin Ordinals profitability falls in July, but total inscriptions pile on - Forkast News",
        "content": "The profitability of Ordinals inscriptions, an iteration of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin network, declined throughout July, Forkast Labs data show.\n\nMonthly NFT services revenue, or the sum of marketplace fees and creator royalties on the Bitcoin network, fell to US$1.22 million in July from US$3.13 million in June, suggesting lower profitability for Ordinals sales on the Bitcoin network.\n\nOrdinals is an iteration of NFTs on Bitcoin, the world\u2019s first and largest blockchain network by market capitalization. Bitcoin had a market capitalization of US$562 billion as of Tuesday, dominating 48.2% of the total cryptocurrency market.\n\nDespite lower profitability, Ordinals broke a daily inscriptions record on July 30 with 422,164, after reaching 20 million total inscriptions on July 28, showing the market\u2019s continued support and interest in Bitcoin-native NFTs, according to data from Dune Analytics. The network exceeded 21 million total inscriptions on Tuesday.\n\nTotal Ordinals-related transactions increased to 93,164 in July from 68,263 in June, CryptoSlam data showed. The number of monthly active Ordinals owners dropped to 81,171 in July from 118,122 in June.\n\nKadan Stadelmann, chief technical officer of blockchain infrastructure firm Komodo, said that the oversaturation of Ordinals is among the main factors contributing to the declining profitability of Bitcoin NFTs.\n\n\u201cWith an influx of new projects and artists entering the space, buyers now face a plethora of options, diluting the value and appeal of individual pieces,\u201d Stadelmann told Forkast.\n\nTom Tirman, the chief executive officer of NFT rental platform IQ Protocol, suggested that the persistent creation of Ordinals could be a strategic move by investors who \u2014 having missed out on prior opportunities \u2014 are aiming to position themselves advantageously for the anticipated future expansions of Bitcoin NFTs.\n\nTirman said that the introduction of Ordinals came with an \u201cunsustainable hype that has largely cooled off,\u201d and that its recovery is a matter of time.\n\n\u201cAs we often see in other vital innovations recorded in the industry in the past, Ordinals are bound to regain their momentum after a remarkable use case is tagged with them,\u201d he said.\n\nProfits from secondary market sales have also been declining. The average sale price for Ordinals fell to US$214.03 in July from US$900 in June and US$1,178 in May, according to CryptoSlam data. At its peak in March, Ordinals traded at an average value of US$9,357.\n\nAccording to Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs, the weaker Ordinals price reflects lower NFT sales volume, as declining interest from buyers pushes sellers to lower prices.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s too much potential on the crypto side of things for traders to want to trade NFTs or Ordinals right now, and there\u2019s also a bit of a liquidity issue. Simply put, traders are out of money. Bitcoin and crypto in general running will fix both of these issues,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nNot just Bitcoin\n\nAlthough key performance indicators for Ordinals tumbled in July, the Bitcoin network maintained its position as the month\u2019s second most active blockchain in the world for NFTs ranked by sales volume with over US$64.9 million, trailing Ethereum\u2019s US$273.9 million, CryptoSlam data shows.\n\n\u201cThe decline in total revenue for NFT services on the Bitcoin network after May does not necessarily signify a lack of interest in Ordinal inscriptions specifically,\u201d Anndy Lian, author of NFT: From Zero to Hero, told Forkast. \u201cInstead, it points to a broader trend in the NFT market as a whole. The decrease in revenue is likely indicative of a general downturn in the NFT market, affecting all types of NFT services and not just Ordinal inscriptions.\u201d\n\nDavid Atterman, the chief executive officer of crypto-based engagement platform Most.Fan, agreed with Liann, attributing the falling profitability of Ordinals to the poor performance of the overall NFT market.\n\n\u201cProjects that do not carry utility for new users and that do not focus on mass adoption, quickly lose their significance and are unlikely to recover at the next bull run,\u201d said Atterman.\n\nAccording to Petscher, the next NFT bull run will follow the cryptocurrency market.\n\n\u201cWe also need to see some type of innovation happen in NFTs to bring back traders who have realized that currently, there\u2019s not much substance that\u2019s worth investing in,\u201d he said.\n\nStandard Chartered, a British multinational bank, said in a July research report that Bitcoin prices will top US$120,000 in 2024, fueled by Bitcoin\u2019s halving event set to occur in April 2024. The halving will reduce Bitcoin\u2019s current supply inflow of 6.25 BTC every 10 minutes to 3.125 BTC. Each halving cycle to date has resulted in a new price record for Bitcoin.\n\nSee related article: Cardano \u2018ghost chain\u2019 outperforms top blockchains in NFT market"

        "content": "Bitcoin has erased early gains seen after MicroStrategy's announcement to boost its coin stash and Fitch's downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating.\n\nRisk assets, including bitcoin, took a beating after S&P downgraded U.S. in August 2011.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) reversed early Asian session gains as the dollar index and the Treasury yield recouped losses seen after Fitch downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit rating from the top score.\n\nAt 04:25 UTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value changed hands at $29,600, down from the high of $30,032 registered at 01:30 UTC, per CoinDesk data.\n\nThe pullback reversed almost entire gains seen after bitcoin holder MicroStrategy announced plans to raise funds to boost its coin stash and the rating agency Fitch downgraded its credit rating for the U.S. government, from AAA to AA+, citing repeated brinkmanship over the debt ceiling.\n\nThe dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, fell from 102.14 to 101.95 in a knee-jerk reaction to the ratings downgrade, only to bounce back to 102.25 at press time. The 10-year Treasury yield chalked out a similar drop and pop to hover above 4%. Bitcoin tends to move in the opposite direction of the greenback and bond yields.\n\nTwo of the so-called big three rating agencies have now placed the default rating at AA+. Moody's still has a top rating of AAA.\n\nThe S&P downgraded the U.S. to AA+ on Aug. 5, 2011, following which the dollar index and Treasury yields initially declined but quickly bounced back. Stocks tumbled, with bitcoin falling over 38% in the same month, data from TradingView show. The only major asset to rally alongside DXY was gold, which gained over 10%.\n\nThe dollar index and Treasury yields rose after the S&P downgraded U.S. on Aug. 5, 2011.\n\nIf history is a guide, the dollar index looks set to rise further, bringing more pain to bitcoin and stocks, although impending buying pressure from MicroStrategy might support the cryptocurrency's price.\n\nRead More: Bitcoin Whale Michael Saylor Might Buy a Lot More BTC\n\nStory continues\n\nAs of writing, futures tied to the S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark equity index pointed to a negative open with a 0.5% drop. As Asia began its business day, bitcoin jumped past $30,000 after software developer and bitcoin whale MicroStrategy submitted a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to sell up to $750 million in stock with the intent of using the capital to purchase more BTC.\n\nMajor U.S. equity indexes \u2013 Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 \u2013 fell 0.4% and 0.3%, on Tuesday.\n\nIn a note to CoinDesk, Mark Connors, the head of research at Canadian digital asset manager 3iQ, wrote that the recent \"shift in market sentiment was NOT limited to digital assets, as equities took a breather.\"\n\n\"Our bellwether cross asset correlation metric hit a 20Y high as bonds and equities sold off,\" Connors wrote. \"Looking forward, we will monitor for any sharp reversal from this historically high correlation - as that has often signaled a risk reversal.\"\n\nETH, CRV track BTC lower\n\nThe CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, pulled back from $1,290 to $1,279, but was still up 2% on a 24-hour basis.\n\nEther, the native token of Ethereum, fell 0.5% from early Asian session highs to $1,860 taking cues from bitcoin's negative turnaround. Per one analyst, ether is overvalued and could slide further. Options market is seeing price weakness over the next six months.\n\nCurve's CRV token pulled back 5% to 58 cents. The cryptocurrency rose more than 20% to over 62 cents on Tuesday, likely on the back of a short squeeze. The increase came after Sun purchased more than $2 million worth of the token and pledged additional assistance through a liquidity pool on the Tron network. Curve fell victim to an exploit late Sunday, triggering a sell-off in CRV that got the market worried about potential liquidation of Curve founder's large borrowed position.\n\n\"Clearly, there are fears over a liquidation cascade happening within the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem, Richard Mico, the U.S. CEO of payment-and-compliance infrastructure provider BanxaI, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. \"I don\u2019t know how likely such a cascade is, but the market seems jittery as a result of these metastasizing issues. What\u2019s ironic is that DeFi had held up so well during the blowups of 2022, and yet it\u2019s an exploit more recently that might be the trigger for a DeFi blowup itself now.\"\n\nMico added that a judge's ruling against stablecoin issuer Terraform Labs' motion to dismiss a lawsuit against the SEC might \"be adding to the relatively soft sentiment in the market,\" but he noted that investors were buying up bitcoin's recent \"dips below $29,000...pretty quickly,\" a sign that buyers are accumulating in expectation of the SEC approving one of the recent spot BTC ETF applications.\n\nSee more: Get professional-grade crypto data and news at CoinDeskMarkets.com\n\nUPDATE (August 1, 2023, 23:43 UTC): Changes headline and opening paragraphs to reflect MicroStrategy filing and bitcoin price increase.\n\nUPDATE (August 2, 2023, 1:24 UTC): Reflects latest price increases for bitcoin and altcoins."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether fall as market digests Curve hack - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether prices fell in early Tuesday afternoon trading in Asia, with Bitcoin losing support at US$29,000, amid concern about the hack of the popular decentralized finance platform Curve Finance over the weekend that saw an estimated US$41 million stolen and raised concerns about a DeFi contagion. The hack has been linked to a flaw in a programming language. These concerns increased as reports surfaced on Tuesday of an attack on the LeetSwap exchange running on Coinbase. Solana and Matic led the top 10 losers mid Tuesday. Litecoin also gave up gains ahead of its halving event on Wednesday.\n\nBitcoin, Ether hold steady\n\nBitcoin fell 1.8% in the last 24 hours to US$28,872 as of 12:50 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency fell under the US$30,000 support floor in the latter weeks of July and has fluctuated around US$29,000 since then, unable to find buying support for a breakout in the so-called summer doldrums when trading in many capital markets slows.\n\nHowever, drama came over the weekend when decentralized stablecoin exchange Curve Finance reported a security issue in older versions of Vyper, the programming language used for smart contracts.\n\nAccording to data from smart contract auditing firm BlockSec, hackers drained an estimated US$41 million in cryptocurrencies from the platform as a result of the malfunction, raising concerns about possible problems at other DeFi platforms.\n\nCurve Finance is the third largest decentralized financial exchange (DEX) by 7-day trading volume, according to DeFi data tracker DefiLlama.\n\nBitcoin and Ether lost ground as CoinDesk reported that LeetSwap said its working with on-chain security experts to recover 340 Ether after PeckShield tweeted the exchange on Coinbase\u2019s Layer 2 blockchain had been attacked.\n\nIn earlier comments related to the Curve hack, Justin d\u2019Anethan at Hong Kong-based crypto market maker Keyrock said Bitcoin had held up well considering.\n\n\u201cIndeed, after the Vyper hacks that affected a number of pools in Curve and pushed prices of CRV, CVX and FXS along with other yield protocols down, BTC and ETH held steady,\u201d he said before reports of the LeetSwap exploit.\n\nLackluster trading and caution is seen elsewhere in crypto asset investment products, which saw minor outflows of US$21 million last week, 93% of which were from long-Bitcoin investment products, according to an emailed report from European alternative asset manager CoinShares.\n\n\u201cThis suggests investors have been taking profits in recent weeks, with the sentiment for the asset overall remaining supportive,\u201d the CoinShares report said.\n\nNigel Green, the CEO and founder of the deVere investment advisory group, said summer typically ushers in reduced market activity, which in turn can create price inefficiencies and increased volatility.\n\n\u201cWhen used effectively and efficiently, volatility can be an extremely powerful investment tool as you can enhance your portfolios with high quality assets at lower entry points,\u201d Green said in email comments.\n\n\u201cNot only does Bitcoin remain one of the best performing asset classes of the decade, I believe its performance will further strengthen. Both institutional and retail investors are increasingly seeing the value of a digital, global, borderless and tamper-proof currency and store of value.\n\n\u201cThis trend will increase as adoption picks up further and as confidence grows again in the global economy.\u201d\n\nEther, the second largest crypto token by market cap, fell 2.10% to US$1,825 early Tuesday afternoon after trading flat in the morning.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies fell Tuesday morning. Solana led the losers, dipping 4.6% to US$23.31, while Matic was close behind with a drop of 4.1% to US$0.67.\n\nLitecoin fell 3.5% to US$89.83, barely holding a gain of 1% for the last week ahead of its halving event on Wednesday.\n\nThe halving is expected to cut the mining reward for each successfully minted Litecoin block from 12.50 LTC to 6.25 LTC, increasing its scarcity and potentially triggering a rise in the token\u2019s price. Litecoin is up about 31% year to date.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization fell 1.8% in the past 24 hours to US$1.16 trillion, while trading volume rose 17.6% to US$30.83 billion.\n\nNFT 500 ends July in red\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index fell 1.19% in the past 24 hours to 2,516.20 as of 7:45 a.m. in Hong Kong, resulting in a drop of 5.37% for the week and 10.70% for the month.\n\nForkast\u2019s Ethereum, Solana and Cardano NFT market indexes all logged losses, while the index measuring the performance of Polygon\u2019s NFT market edged up a slight 0.18%.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume fell 2.93% in the past 24 hours to US$17.65 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volume on Ethereum, the largest NFT network, declined 10.17% to US$11.68 million.\n\nTrading volumes on Polygon jumped 87.67% to US$1.14 million to take second spot in Cryptoslam\u2019s rankings. Solana and BNB networks also saw increases in NFT volumes.\n\nNFT trading volume on the Bitcoin network dropped 20.08% to US$479,775. \u201cAn ecosystem that many, myself included, had predicted to one day flip Ethereum is showing its limitations,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs.\n\n\u201cWith no avenues right now for utility, traders are finding few reasons to collect these assets that promise nothing more than small jpegs to collect. We\u2019ll need to see some innovation or more premium art on Bitcoin if we want to see its ecosystem turn around.\u201d\n\nBy NFT collections, Ethereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) saw the largest 24-hour trading volume, gaining 26.26% to US$1.12 million. DMarket and Gods Unchained Cards, which are both in-game NFT items, ranked second and third.\n\nU.S. equities finish July strong\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures gained as of 10:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, after the three major U.S. stock indexes ended July with strong gains of between 3% to 4%.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes rose on Tuesday morning, with the exception of China\u2019s Shanghai Composite after manufacturing data missed expectations. Private research firm Caixin Insight Group\u2019s China General Manufacturing PMI for July released Tuesday dropped for the first time since April, missing market estimates and hitting its lowest point in six months.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s economic recovery in the first quarter exceeded expectations, but the momentum weakened in the second,\u201d wrote Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin. \u201cAlthough the data for industrial production and investment in June showed some signs of recovery, macroeconomic growth remained sluggish, and considerable downward pressure on the economy persisted.\u201d\n\nZhe added: \u201cguaranteeing employment, stabilizing expectations and increasing household income\u201d should remain the top priorities of Chinese policymakers.\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 gained as the country\u2019s unemployment rate edged lower in June as forecasted, marking the country\u2019s lowest jobless rate since January.\n\nIn the U.S., second quarter earnings season continues with reports from Apple, Amazon, Pfizer and others through the week, plus more economic indicators. The S&P Global\u2019s U.S. manufacturing purchasing manager\u2019s index (PMI) will be out Tuesday and the July employment report on Friday.\n\nOn interest rates, the Federal Reserve next meets on Sept. 19 and 20 after raising a quarter of a point in July. Rates are now between 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest since January 2001.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell last week reiterated the bank takes a data-driven approach to decide interest rate policy and Fed economists said the likelihood of a recession in the U.S. has diminished, indicating to some analysts the Fed may leave rates unchanged next month.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 82.5% chance the Fed will keep rates as is in September, and a 17.5% chance for another 25-basis-point increase.\n\n(Updates with equity section)"

Curve\u2019s CRV token dropped as a result, spelling potential trouble for founder Michael Egorov\u2019s $168 million lending position backed by CRV.

        "content": "Bitcoin mining involves the process of validating and recording transactions on the Bitcoin network. By digitally validating transactions in an attempt to prevent fraud and adding new blocks to the blockchain ledger, mining helps create new Bitcoins in a decentralized way.\n\nHistorically, it has been observed that bitcoin mining may remain profitable even during down markets for cryptocurrencies, while they habitually prosper when things are looking up. In a sense, by lending credence to cryptocurrency, bitcoin miners have assumed a defensive nature in the world of crypto.\n\nThere are obvious sectoral headwinds like high production costs and lower revenues per block mined that miners face during a downturn. However, in a year where the price of Bitcoin (BTC) has gone up 74.6% as of Aug 1, these overheads can be offset.\n\nThere is a bigger problem on the horizon though, with the scheduled April 2024 halving lurking around the corner. The halving is a planned reduction of Bitcoin emissions in each block and takes place every four years. This entails miners to deal with the sudden shock of revenues falling down by exactly half.\n\nHowever, because of its non-sudden nature, bitcoin miners have had a chance to prepare for the event. They have resorted to selling to improve their cashflows and sending large amounts of BTC to exchanges as a part of the de-risking strategy. For example, selling BTC one-year futures allows miners to lock in a selling price of $30,000 for the next year.\n\nSo, with a \u201ccrypto spring\u201d in the offing in 2023 and bitcoin miners already preparing their strategies for next year\u2019s halving, it would be prudent to watch a few bitcoin mining stocks that have done exceedingly well this year.\n\nHut 8 Mining Corp. HUT: This cryptocurrency mining company from North America provides computing power to the mining pools in exchange for digital assets. It is one of the world\u2019s largest crypto mining companies, and its shares have soared 318.8% year to date (as of Jul 31).\n\nStory continues\n\nHut 8\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 50%. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStronghold Digital Mining, Inc. SDIG: This is a crypto asset mining company that focuses on mining Bitcoin in the United States. Its shares have climbed 85.2% year to date (as of Jul 31).\n\nStronghold Digital Mining\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 92.7%. Stronghold Digital Mining currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nHIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. HIVE: This cryptocurrency mining company operates in Canada, Sweden and Iceland. It engages in the mining and sale of digital currencies. Its shares have surged 276.4% year to date (as of Jul 31).\n\nHIVE\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 78.1%.

As of July 30, the firm bought another 467 BTC, meaning its total Bitcoin balance is worth $4.5 billion at current prices.\n\nIn a separate filing to the SEC, also filed on Aug. 1, the company revealed that it is also planning to sell up to $750 million in stocks for the acquisition of Bitcoin and other general corporate purposes.\n\nRelated: MicroStrategy buys $347M worth of Bitcoin amid market thaw\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has continued to creep upwards over 2023, surging 79% since the start of the year. It is currently trading at $29,206.80, according to Google Finance.\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s share price has also witnessed a resurgence per Google Finance, starting at $145.02 per share on Jan. 3, and rising nearly 200% to $434.98 at the time of writing.\n\nIn July, analysts from New York-based investment firm Berenberg Capital posted a bullish outlook for MicroStrategy, noting that the upcoming Bitcoin halving rally could see its shares gain significantly in price.\n\nHall of Flame: Wolf Of All Streets worries about a world where Bitcoin hits $1M"

Money laundering accounts for 2-5% of global gross domestic product, according to United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime statistics cited in the report, but accounts for just 0.24% of Bitcoin transactions, per Elliptic. It also noted that laundered money was received in Bitcoin far less than in Ether (ETH), stablecoins or altcoins, and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) measures could be applied at the point of off-ramping the coin, even though there are no AML/KYC requirements for transacting with it.\n\nRelated: Metaverse \u2018explosion\u2019 will be driven by B2B, not retail consumers: KPMG partner\n\nPositive use cases were provided again, such as fundraising for Ukraine and electrification in rural Africa.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s governance is robust, the report said, as its rules cannot be changed without forking:\n\n\u201cThis results in a system that cannot be abused or misused by those in power or even individuals with ulterior motives due to its decentralization.\u201d\n\nThe 12-page report uses all secondary sources and familiar use cases.

        "title": "Bitcoin investor sentiment slumps to a new low, even as macro and equities show improvement - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin surpassed the $30,000 resistance on June 21, or 40 days ago, after a notable 19.5% gain in a week. Since then, it has been moving within a range filled with occasional moderate corrections, and as of Aug. 1, the Bitcoin (BTC) price was trading near $29,300. While these consolidation periods are common in traditional markets, they tend to make crypto investors quite anxious.\n\nAs Bitcoin\u2019s price repeatedly fails to break the $31,000 level, traders are becoming increasingly tense and their sentiment is worsening. This trend could reverse suddenly, regardless of any relevant news or macroeconomic factors that might support an upward move, and crypto traders' emotions can magnify positive and negative price swings, leading to euphoric and fear-led price action.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s low volatility sessions have traders worried\n\nThe increased anxiety among traders is partly due to Bitcoin\u2019s historical volatility, which used to be much higher than its current levels. Presently, the 33% annualized 50-day volatility is the lowest in six months, contrasting sharply with the 60% or higher volatility observed for 245 days throughout 2022. Despite the rationale for this shift, the recent period has been relatively calm for Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nTo put it in perspective, consider that auto and electric battery producer Tesla, a top 10 global asset and part of the S&P 500 index, currently experiences a 58% annualized volatility. In comparison, graphics chipmaker Nvidia has consistently demonstrated a 70% or higher volatility for most of 2021.\n\nWhile some analysts use volatility data to predict trends, it\u2019s essential to note that this indicator relies on absolute price changes, yielding the same outcome for both upward and downward price swings. Therefore, volatility only provides information about the magnitude of daily oscillations.\n\nHowever, apart from price changes, there are other metrics that can indicate investors\u2019 excitement or lack of interest in an asset, such as evaluating its market share or market dominance.\n\nBitcoin dominance shows declining interest relative to altcoins\n\nOn July 30, Bitcoin\u2019s market share of total crypto capitalization dropped to 49.5%, the lowest figure since June 16.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) dominance, percentage terms. Source: TradingView\n\nThis decline can be partially attributed to a favorable legal decision for Ripple Labs on July 13, which reduced regulatory risks for altcoins. Industry representatives believe this decision will benefit crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance in their lawsuits with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The diminishing dominance of Bitcoin marks a trend shift from the gains observed between December 2022 and June 2023, when it increased from 40.2% to 52%.\n\nLackluster network activity is another sign of negative investor sentiment\n\nBitcoin's one-year active supply, representing the sum of unique BTC transacted in the trailing 12 months, reached its lowest level since February 2016 at 6.0 million BTC as of July 26. This data, compared with the 6.2 million BTC activity three months prior, raises concerns, especially with the potential approval of spot exchange-traded funds in the United States.\n\nBitcoin 1-year active supply. Source: Coin Metrics\n\nThe decreasing number of Bitcoin moved on-chain might have been offset by the increased use of the Lightning Network as an alternative solution. However, this layer 2 solution currently holds a mere $138 million in total value locked and shows a nearly unmoving 16,382 nodes in the past 30 days.\n\nRelated: US banking advocacy group supports Sen. Warren\u2019s reintroduced crypto bill\n\nBitcoin options traders are losing confidence\n\nThe main \u201cfear and greed\u201d metric for Bitcoin options, the 25% delta skew, indicates that bulls are becoming less confident over time. Readings above 7% suggest traders anticipate a drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price, while periods of excitement typically yield a -7% skew.\n\nBitcoin 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nCurrently, the 30-day metric remains flat at 1%, indicating a balanced demand between call (buy) options and protective puts, signaling a neutral market. However, it does show a decreased appetite among bulls compared to the 2% to 14% discount on neutral-to-bearish put (sell) options between June 19 and July 29. This derivatives data strongly supports the notion that traders have become less confident since the $29,500 support level broke.\n\nAs investors\u2019 mood worsens and indicators point to increased tension, the Bitcoin price faces mounting pressure in the near term. Falling dominance, lackluster network activity and concerns in the options markets all contribute to the potential negative impact on the Bitcoin price. On a positive note, if traders remain cautious and anticipate further downward movement, the likelihood of excessive liquidations among leverage traders is reduced.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s Q2 earnings show net income of $22.2 million\n\nLast Year was a $1.2 billion deficit\n\nThe company plans to purchase additional Bitcoins after selling stocks\n\nThe business intelligence company of Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy, disclosed its intentions to generate roughly $750 million through the sale of stocks to increase the amount of Bitcoins in the portfolio, which currently stands at 152,800 BTC, or $4.53 billion.\n\nIn addition, the platform reported the company\u2019s net income of $22.2 million in the second quarter results report . This is a significant increase from the $1.1 billion loss recorded in the previous year.\n\nCCN reached out to MicroStrategy for commentary but did not receive a reply at the time of publishing.\n\nThe cryptocurrency saw a surge when MicroStrategy announced in a recent filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that the platform plans to expand its Bitcoin portfolio by adding more BTC coins.\n\nThe statement said :\n\n\u201cWe may offer and sell shares of our class A common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $750,000,000 from time to time through one or more of the Agents, acting as our sales agents.\u201d\n\nHuge Bitcoin Buyer Since 2020\n\nSaylor, the executive chairman of MicroStrategy, reiterated the company\u2019s excitement about accumulating Bitcoins earlier today on Twitter while providing an update on the platform\u2019s acquisition of the cryptocurrency.\n\nApril saw MicroStrategy purchase 1045 Bitcoins for a total estimated cost of $29.3 million, not long after revealing a massive acquisition of 6,500 Bitcoins.\n\nMicroStrategy added 12,333 Bitcoins to its second quarter, bringing its total holdings to $361.4 million from 12,800 in the first quarter. According to Chief Financial Officer Andrew Kang of the company:\n\n\u201cWe efficiently raised capital through our at-the-market equity program and used cash from operations to continue to increase bitcoins on our balance sheet. And we did so against the promising backdrop of increasing institutional interest, progress on accounting transparency, and ongoing regulatory clarity for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nSaylor started purchasing Bitcoin in 2020, claiming that the corporation needed to maintain less cash due to the inflation danger that was thought to be diminishing. A stagnation in software business revenue brought about the change.\n\nSaylor resigned as CEO a year ago, stating he would concentrate on the Bitcoin component of the business\u2019s two-pronged approach.\n\nNew CEO Takes Place\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s activities remain unprofitable, with an operating loss of $26.7 million for the quarter. Due to previous write-downs of its Bitcoin assets, the corporation has delayed tax savings totaling over $700 million. The corporation has eliminated a valuation allowance against the tax assets now that the value of Bitcoin has increased.\n\nOn a conference call on Tuesday, August 1, Phong Le, who became CEO after Saylor became executive chairman, announced that he had taken on the duties of the company\u2019s chief revenue officer, who had resigned. Some analysts claim that Saylor\u2019s investments will also pay off ahead of Bitcoin halving.\n\nBitcoin had a significant increase of 1.92% after MicroStartegy\u2019s disclosure. Before this, it was trading in the $28,000 region. With a market capitalization of $575,721,859,417 and a 24-hour trading volume of $19,688,414,825 at its current price of $29,434, Bitcoin continues to dominate the cryptocurrency industry."

Host Benjamin Pirus asked Sorout several questions, including one regarding Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) future and what scenario, if any, could lead to its extinction. Sorout suggested two different possibilities.\n\nAccording to the trader, \u201cIf somebody figured out a way to crack seed phrases, if they built a supercomputer,\u201d it could potentially lead to vulnerabilities in Bitcoin. \u201cThere have been some rumors in the past. People say, \u2018Oh, and they could build such a supercomputer that calculates at X amount of speed, then you could crack a seed phrase within a shorter period of time.\u2019\u201d\n\nTechnology has surged forward in recent years. The prevalence of artificial intelligence has become a talking point as people have begun using OpenAI\u2019s chatbot ChatGPT in various ways.

        "content": "Although Bitcoin (BTC) has been moving in a largely sideways pattern for the past several weeks, some observers have noted that there was a possibility that the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset could eventually reach the coveted price of $1 million, making everyone who held at least one wholecoin significantly rich(er).\n\nIndeed, some of the sector\u2019s most famous investors, including Michael Saylor\u2019s business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, which has purchased over 12,000 Bitcoin during the second quarter of 2023, are willing to bet that the maiden cryptocurrency will continue to grow its price, eventually culminating at $1 million, and Finbold has analyzed the factors that could lead to this result.\n\nContinued halvings\n\nOne factor that has continuously stood out for its major role in Bitcoin\u2019s price movements is its halving, i.e., the algorithmic event that cuts the previous reward for mining this Proof-of-Work (PoW) crypto in half, thus reducing the amount of BTC in circulation and increasing demand which, in turn, drives the price up. As it happens, Bitcoin has entered the final phase before its fourth halving earlier in May 2023.\n\nIndeed, the crypto community expects the next halving event for Bitcoin to take place in May 2024, and multiple crypto trading experts have voiced their opinion that the price of the maiden digital asset will surely skyrocket during that time, with pseudonymous analyst PlanB discussing several pricing models that could give it room to grow toward $1 million.\n\nIncreased institutional adoption\n\nFollowing the unexpected change in stance from Larry Fink, CEO of the world\u2019s largest asset manager BlackRock (NYSE: BLK), toward Bitcoin, doing a 360 from claiming that clients had \u201czero interest\u201d in crypto assets to openly embracing Bitcoin and becoming its enthusiastic supporter, the institutional interest in it has become more apparent.\n\nSpecifically, BlackRock\u2019s surprise application for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in June has encouraged multiple other companies to follow the asset manager\u2019s example, starting a chain of Bitcoin ETF filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and triggering a massive Bitcoin price increase, which billionaire Mike Novogratz identified as a turning point.\n\nWider acceptance as payment method\n\nAt the same time, as Bitcoin becomes a more accepted payment method around the world, with increasingly more e-commerce and brick-and-mortar businesses introducing the option to pay via crypto for their products and/or services, and more Bitcoin ATMs springing in all corners of the globe, the increased acceptance could also drive up the demand for the cryptocurrency.\n\nSpecifically, according to the statistics by the crypto ATM analytics platform Coin ATM Radar, there were 36,316 crypto ATMs and 236,756 other Bitcoin-to-cash and cash-to-Bitcoin service providers in 71 countries around the world, produced by 46 Bitcoin ATM manufacturers and installed by 515 Bitcoin machine operators, recording a continuous increase in installations.\n\nFavorable regulatory environment\n\nFurthermore, governments and regulators becoming more open and favorable towards Bitcoin, as evident in the example of the United Kindom\u2019s financial services minister, Andrew Griffith, rejecting the Treasury Committee\u2019s recommendation to regulate retail trading and investing in crypto as gambling, could also help drive up the price.\n\nAnother example of a crypto-friendly environment is Malta, an island country that has used cryptocurrencies for the longest time among all others, with several bills to make it the global leader in crypto regulation, and leading Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, to choose it over Japan, as it considered it more favorable than the East Asian country.\n\nEconomic situation\n\nFinally, amid a global economic crisis, many people could turn to Bitcoin as a safe haven asset, including Robert Kiyosaki, a renowned investor and author of the best-selling personal finance book \u2018Rich Dad Poor Dad,\u2019 who has recently strongly criticized the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) over the claims that the US economy was strong.\n\nAs more preferable assets to fiat money, particularly the US dollar, the finance educator has long advised his followers to buy gold, silver, and Bitcoin to survive the looming major financial depression and stock market crash, as well as predicting that the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization would hit $120,000 next year.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin was at press time changing hands at the price of $29,467, recording an increase of 1.76% on the day and gaining 0.88% across the previous week, whereas, on its monthly chart, it has witnessed a decline of 3.83%, according to the information retrieved on August 2.\n\nBitcoin 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAll things considered, when and if Bitcoin truly manages to reach the whopping price of $1 million is impossible to say but could depend on the above factors, either acting alone or coming together. Ultimately, the forces of supply and demand will be the ones to determine the actual price of the representative digital asset.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "MicroStrategy made largest Bitcoin purchase since 2021 in Q2 2023 amid slight revenue decrease - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "In its Aug. 1 financial results, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy said it acquired substantial Bitcoin during Q2 2023.\n\nAndrew Kang, Chief Financial Officer at MicroStrategy, said:\n\n\u201cThe addition in the second quarter of 12,333 bitcoins [is] the largest increase in a single quarter since Q2 2021. We efficiently raised capital\u2026 and used cash from operations to continue to increase bitcoins on our balance sheet.\u201d\n\nIn a separate presentation, the firm said that the 12,333 BTC it bought was purchased for $347 million at an average of $28,136 per Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, those numbers only represent the company\u2019s latest additions, not the total amount of Bitcoin it acquired. MicroStrategy said that, as of July 31, 2023, it had acquired 152,800 BTC for $4.53 billion or $29,672 per Bitcoin.\n\nDespite those high estimates, the company said that the carrying value (the original cost of the asset, less any depreciation, amortization or impairment costs) of its Bitcoin was just $2.3 billion. That number reflects cumulative impairment losses of $2.196 billion since MicroStrategy\u2019s first purchase and an average carrying amount per Bitcoin of $15,251.\n\nMicroStrategy noted elsewhere that Bitcoin and its own MSTR stock have outperformed numerous other indexes and assets. MSTR has gained 254% since it adopted its Bitcoin strategy in August 2020, while Bitcoin itself has gained 145% since that date.\n\nMicroStrategy otherwise reported total revenues of $120.4 million in Q2 2023, which represents a 1% decrease in revenue year-over-year.\n\nBitcoin in the bigger picture\n\nKang also positioned MicroStrategy\u2019s purchases within broader industry developments, such as increasing interest from institutional investors and regulatory clarity around Bitcoin.\n\nKang also said that MicroStrategy is seeing progress regarding Bitcoin accounting practices. In May, the company submitted a letter to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) expressing support for a fair value accounting for crypto assets. It said this would allow it to provide a \u201cmore relevant view\u201d of its Bitcoin holdings.\n\nIn its company profile, Microstrategy called Bitcoin a \u201cdependable store of value\u201d and described Bitcoin acquisition as one of its two main strategies alongside its enterprise software business.\n\nUPDATE: Aug. 2, 2023, 9AM \u2013 MicroStrategy announced the sale of up to $750 million of its Class A stock on Aug. 1 potentially to fund additional Bitcoin purchases.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) faces a \u201cbreakdown\u201d and distribution despite a new macroeconomic paradigm being around the corner.\n\nThat was one of the conclusions of quantitative Bitcoin and digital asset fund Capriole Investments, which, in its latest update, warned that Bitcoin was \u201cnot yet\u201d ready to flip bullish.\n\nCapriole: Bitcoin fundamentals say \u201cnot yet\u201d\n\nUnited States equities are booming, and the Federal Reserve may be at the end of its most stringent monetary tightening ever \u2014 but Bitcoin has failed to react.\n\nAs traders predict a return to levels closer to $25,000 or lower, Capriole believes that more time is necessary for the new macroeconomic reality to sink in.\n\n\u201cAt the same time that Bitcoin has been faltering, the S&P500 has had its longest winning streak in years and the Fed has essentially paused rate hikes at what is now the tightest monetary policy regime on record,\u201d founder Charles Edwards writes.\n\n\u201cIn essence we are at a macro pivot point and (all else equal) entering a new monitory policy regime which should be more favorable for Bitcoin over the coming years. This is a positive backdrop for Bitcoin. But today the technicals and fundamentals are telling us \u2018not yet.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile suggesting that the U.S. greenlighting a Bitcoin spot price exchange-traded fund could turn the situation around, Bitcoin remains pinned below resistance on both long and short timeframes, Edwards concludes.\n\n\u201cThe next support levels are $28K, $24K and low-$20Ks; with each offering significantly better relative opportunity,\u201d he continued.\n\nAs such, utilizing the Wyckoff method, \u201cdistribution\u201d currently characterizes BTC price action.\n\n\u201cLow Timeframe Technicals: Breakdown! Support at $30K failed and a new bearish trend has emerged,\u201d Edwards summarizes.\n\n\u201cThis is a low timeframe Wyckoff distribution. If the magnitude of the downswing matches the upswing, the target of this move is circa $25K.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBTC price taps 6-week lows\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, Capriole is far from the only market participant predicting BTC price conditions to get worse before they get better.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin loses $29K as traders flag key BTC price levels to watch next\n\nOn-chain monitoring resource Material Indicators this week argued that multiple lower levels remain \u201cpossible\u201d for Bitcoin after BTC/USD failed to rally on the back of last week\u2019s U.S. macro data.\n\nThis showed inflation slowing faster than predictions, notionally increasing the odds of a pivot in Fed policy sooner rather than later.\n\nIn his recent interview with Cointelegraph, meanwhile, Edwards himself stuck by a previous long-term forecast. Bitcoin, he suggested, would need up to a year before bullish momentum really began.\n\n\u201cThat thinking mostly remains today. Bitcoin has steadily grinded up about 30% since February,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe difference today is that the relative value opportunity is slightly less as a result, and we are now trading into major price resistance at $32,000, which represents the bottom of the 2021 bull market range and confluence with major weekly and monthly order blocks.\u201d\n\nBTC price action wicked to $28,574 after the Aug. 1 Wall Street open, marking its lowest level since mid-June, per data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView.\n\nBTC/USD 1-day chart.

These are defined by on-chain analytics firm Glassnode as entities hodling BTC for a maximum of 155 days.\n\n\u201cFully expect Bitcoin to test the short-term holder cost basis, which is $28.3K.

The post-merger mining potential of the two companies will reach 5.6 EH/s.\n\n\"We've been searching for the right partner to join us on our ambitious growth journey for some time and are confident that Hut 8 is the perfect fit,\" Michael Ho, the Co-Founder and CEO of US Bitcoin, said.\n\nThe company will utilize energy from a mix of zero-emission and renewable sources. The mining industry has recently been betting on environmentally friendlier solutions after strong criticism suggesting that it is responsible for excessive carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nWatch the recent FMLS22 panel on Forex and crypto trends in 2023.\n\nCrypto Miners Feel the Bitcoin Blues\n\nAlthough Bitcoin's price rebounded 40% from multi-month lows in January, the mining industry is far from the results and revenues realized in 2020 or 2021.\n\nFalling prices for BTC and other cryptocurrencies Cryptocurrencies By using cryptography, virtual currencies, known as cryptocurrencies, are nearly counterfeit-proof digital currencies that are built on blockchain technology.

These included the cryptocurrency platform Luno, which reduced its staff by 35%, and the exchange Gemini, which decided to cut its workforce for the third time in nine months.\n\nMining companies are managing to produce more coins than before, even though the difficulty of mining has increased. Still, this guarantees much lower revenues due to low profitability at current prices. Northern Data has increased its production by 315% compared to last year, but this has not translated into better financial results in dollar terms.\n\nIn challenging market conditions, only the strongest can survive. Hence the decision by Hut 8 and US Bitcoin to merge seems perfectly logical. The question is if cryptocurrencies continue to remain cheap in the long term, whether this will lead to further industry consolidation."

Discover SCENE\n\nThe team behind Ordinals said on Tuesday that it has created a nonprofit organization to support the development of its protocol for \"inscribing\" NFT-like assets to the Bitcoin blockchain\u2014right as the total topped 21 million inscriptions to date.\n\nLaunched by developer Casey Rodarmor earlier this year, Ordinals quickly established itself as a hotbed for innovation around crypto\u2019s oldest coin. The protocol lets people assign data to an individual satoshi\u2014equal to 1/100,000,000 of a whole Bitcoin\u2014whether that\u2019s art, profile pictures, or even playable games.\n\nThe California-based nonprofit, dubbed the Open Ordinals Institute, will back the protocol\u2019s development by funding its core group of developers, including the project\u2019s pseudonymous lead maintainer, Raph.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt's very great to scale this up and make a long-term effort,\u201d Raph told Decrypt. \u201cNonprofits [...] can accept donations and can allocate capital to people contributing in a very neutral way, without there being a profit incentive.\u201d\n\nThe shift toward a nonprofit structure will primarily have tax implications, Raph said. Pending approval from the IRS, Ordinals\u2019 development team\u2014which was funded privately by Rodarmor in the past\u2014will be able to accept tax-deductible donations. Previously, funds given to Rodarmor and Raph were classified for tax purposes as personal gifts.\n\nFour people are expected to serve on the Institute\u2019s board, Raph said: himself, Rodarmor, Hell Money podcast host Erin Redwing, and the pseudonymous Ordinals technical fellow known as Ordinally.\n\nRaph described the move as parallel to other crypto projects that have established foundations, but acknowledged that the initiative is still in its early days.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, it's very simple,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's the most minimal structure you can imagine.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlongside the change, the Ordinals team launched Ordinals.org, where members of the organization will post community updates and provide other resources related to the project\u2019s development.\n\nThe new direction for Ordinals\u2019 team comes after Rodarmor said he\u2019d be taking a step back in May, explaining he couldn\u2019t give Ordinals the attention it deserved. Still, Rodarmor has been active in the project\u2019s GitHub repository where features are refined and developed, making changes as recently as June 19.\n\nRodarmor declined to respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.\n\nOn Tuesday, the total number of Ordinals inscriptions topped 21 million, according to a Dune Analytics dashboard. It could be viewed as a noteworthy milestone, considering Bitcoin\u2019s total supply is forever capped at 21 million Bitcoin.\n\nThe fervor surrounding Ordinals inscriptions\u2014as well as Bitcoin transaction fees\u2014spiked in May as demand for BRC-20 tokens surged. The experimental class of tokens, built on top of Bitcoin using Ordinals, takes inspiration from Ethereum ERC-20 tokens.\n\nElevated Bitcoin transaction costs sparked some concerns, yet the higher fees ultimately delivered miners a significant windfall\u2014something that MicroStrategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has previously said could benefit Bitcoin in the long run.\n\nAs enthusiasm surrounding Ordinals grew, several crypto exchanges and NFT marketplaces rushed to support art-based inscriptions and BRC-20 tokens. But lately, there\u2019s been a palpable decline in activity and trading volume related to Ordinals inscriptions, Ordinally told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cMany people are talking about Ordinals being dead,\u201d said Ordinally. \u201cBut what I see from talking to people who are creating software companies and building in this space\u2014everybody\u2019s saying this is a very welcome period to just take a breath and start focusing again.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn June 2, nearly 22,000 transactions involving art-based inscriptions took place on marketplaces that support Ordinals, representing an all-time high, according to another Dune Analytics dashboard. Yesterday, that figure totaled less than 2,000.\n\nOrdinally said they were originally drawn to Bitcoin by the concept of digital scarcity and how something in a \u201cworld of digital noise and abundance\u201d could be finite. In terms of Ordinals, they said the project is an extension of Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity that lends itself to art and digital collectibles, with plenty of room to grow.\n\n\u201cI think digital artifacts built on the scarcity of Bitcoin block space will mature over time into something that is quite different than the NFT ecosystems you see today,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have made the few first steps, but there's so much more to be done.\u201d"

        "title": "What is Metcalfe's Law, and why does it matter? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Metcalfe\u2019s Law in crypto Metcalfe\u2019s Law is a fundamental principle used to comprehend the network effect of communication systems such as cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks. Metcalfe\u2019s Law was first used in the telecommunications industry, and has subsequently been applied to several social and technological networks. Metcalfe\u2019s Law was created by Robert Metcalfe, the co-inventor of Ethernet, and is used to assess the importance and influence of networks based on the number of connections between its users. According to the law, a network\u2019s value is directly inversely proportional to the square of its users or nodes: In the context of cryptocurrencies, Metcalfe\u2019s Law indicates that as a network\u2019s users or players expand in number, so do the network\u2019s value and utility. This is because, in a decentralized network, more users mean more potential for transactions, interactions, and network effects, which in turn can lead to greater adoption and value appreciation of the cryptocurrency. According to this law, the value of a cryptocurrency network increases not linearly with the number of users but quadratically. Moreover, the adoption and practical applications of a cryptocurrency network determine its worth. The more users who find value in using the cryptocurrency for various purposes, the more robust the network's growth potential is. Metcalfe's Law also suggests that the size of the network affects the native token's value. As more users utilize the token for transactions, investments, or other purposes, the demand for the token may increase, potentially leading to price appreciation.\n\nTypes of network effects in crypto Several types of network effects are observed in the crypto space, each contributing to the growth and value of a cryptocurrency network. Various types of network effects in crypto are explained below: The user adoption network effect, which occurs as more users join a cryptocurrency network, increases the network\u2019s value and utility, draws in more users, and is one of the main network effects. An example is Bitcoin (BTC), with its status cemented by its broad acceptance as the industry\u2019s preeminent cryptocurrency. The developer network effect, based on a vibrant development community, is another crucial aspect. A cryptocurrency project can benefit from ongoing technology developments, security upgrades and creative uses when it attracts many developers, increasing its appeal to consumers and investors. With a sizable developer community behind its extensive ecosystem of decentralized apps and smart contracts, Ethereum stands out in this regard. The security network effect emphasizes the significance of a large number of miners or validators participating in a network since security is of the utmost importance in the crypto realm. As more miners are added, PoW-based cryptocurrencies like BTC become more secure, preserving the integrity of the blockchain and the transactions that take place there. Interoperability and alliances also help create network effects. Partnerships with other initiatives, businesses, or organizations can increase cryptocurrency\u2019s utility, adoption and visibility. This has been a reality for Ripple\u2019s XRP (XRP) thanks to partnerships with financial institutions that have allowed it to be incorporated into cross-border payment solutions. Similarly, interoperability between blockchains helps cryptocurrencies gain additional users and ecosystem projects. An example is Polkadot, boasting over 150 projects built on its platform, providing a seamless communication bridge between diverse blockchains.\n\nWhy does Metcalfe\u2019s Law matter in crypto? Metcalfe\u2019s Law is an essential concept in the crypto space, as it highlights the significance of network adoption, decentralization, the network effect, market valuation, scalability, security and utility. Network adoption and value Metcalfe\u2019s Law, which highlights the significance of network adoption, is particularly relevant in the crypto realm. A cryptocurrency network\u2019s value increases nonlinearly as more people join it. This increase in value has the potential to draw more users, creating a beneficial feedback cycle. Decentralization Metcalfe\u2019s Law supports the idea that a larger, more widely dispersed network is more secure and resistant to attacks. This is true for decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The risk of single points of failure or control decreases as the network gets more decentralized due to the growth of nodes. Network effects Metcalfe\u2019s Law illustrates the importance of network effects. It motivates initiatives and groups to put their efforts into attracting sizable, engaged user populations. A cryptocurrency\u2019s utility increases with the number of users, increasing its appeal to new users and investors. Market valuation Investors and analysts can assess cryptocurrency projects more effectively by being aware of Metcalfe\u2019s Law. A network with more members is likely to have a higher intrinsic value, which might affect stock market sentiment and investment choices. Scalability and competition As networks get bigger, scalability becomes more important. The capacity of a blockchain may be strained by high transaction volumes and rising user activity. The performance and user experience of the network must be maintained; hence projects must take effective scaling solutions into account. Tokens and utility Metcalfe\u2019s Law highlights that the services, goods or advantages that Metcalfe\u2019s Law highlights that the services, goods or advantages that utility tokens offer to their user base determine the value of those tokens. The token increases in value as more users decide that utilizing it is worthwhile."

        "title": "Bitcoin, a \"duty of care\" and lex situs - Taylor Wessing",
        "content": "The Court of Appeal recently permitted the appeal of the High Court decision in Tulip Trading v Van der Laan and Ors [2022] EWHC 667 (Ch), on the basis the case advanced a serious issue to be tried. This allows the Court of Appeal to now consider the potential application of a duty of care in relation to bitcoin, which if applied would represent a significant development in this area. It also raises issues of jurisdiction and lex situs over assets that do not, by their nature, have an easily identifiable jurisdiction.\n\nWhat is the case about?\n\nTulip Trading Limited (Tulip) (a Seychelles company) stated that it suffered a loss of $4.5 billion in bitcoin following a hack on the computer of its owner and the stealing of private keys (knowledge of which confers practical control over the asset), which resulted in Tulip being unable to access the bitcoin. The UK nexus is provided by it being the long term residence of Dr Craig Wright, CEO and indirect owner of Tulip, and according to reports, an individual who has claimed, in the past, to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of bitcoin.\n\nTulip issued proceedings against the source code developers of the bitcoin (the Developers) alleging that the Developers had breached fiduciary and tortious duties owed to Tulip and seeking to force the Developers to implement a software patch to negate the alleged fraud/hack, which would result in the return of the \"stolen\" bitcoin to Tulip. The Developers are all resident outside the jurisdiction of England and Wales and Tulip obtained permission to serve proceedings upon them.\n\nTulip asserts that it owns (but has no control over) the bitcoin that was stolen in the hack. Tulip claims that the Developers should assist with the recovery of these assets, as it is within their power to do so. There is no submission or suggestion that the Developers had anything to do with the hack. The Developers assert that their assumption of the duties suggested by Tulip would be unworkable and unduly onerous.\n\nWhat happened in the High Court case?\n\nMrs Justice Falk in the High Court ruled in March 2020 that Tulip had no realistic prospect of proving that the Developers owed them any fiduciary or tortious duties, on the facts as presented. The following issues were discussed:\n\nImposition of fiduciary or tortious duties: Falk J noted that there is an arguable case that Tulip did own the bitcoin and that a hack occurred, but that this was not a strong enough link to impose fiduciary duties on the Developers.\n\nTortious duty: Falk J rejected the thought pattern that the Developers, in their role as developers of a network, should have created software to reverse a hack on the basis the creation of such software would not be intended to address a defect, but instead to impose changes on how the network was intended to work. Falk J considered the imposition of a duty in relation to failures to make changes to how the networks work would go beyond an extension of the current law in relation to tort. Falk J also noted that Tulip could have taken other steps (e.g. insurance of the cryptocurrency or the retention of multiple copies of the private key in multiple locations) to mitigate its own risk in relation to this.\n\nFalk J rejected the thought pattern that the Developers, in their role as developers of a network, should have created software to reverse a hack on the basis the creation of such software would not be intended to address a defect, but instead to impose changes on how the network was intended to work. Falk J considered the imposition of a duty in relation to failures to make changes to how the networks work would go beyond an extension of the current law in relation to tort. Falk J also noted that Tulip could have taken other steps (e.g. insurance of the cryptocurrency or the retention of multiple copies of the private key in multiple locations) to mitigate its own risk in relation to this. Fiduciary duty: Falk J noted the requirement of undivided loyalty in a fiduciary relationship and noted that the steps the Developers would have had to take would have to have been for Tulip's benefit only.\n\nAppropriate forum for trial: Falk J concluded that, given there was no realistic prospect of establishing that the Developers owed any tortious duty to Tulip, there was no serious issue to be tried on the merits of the case and, therefore, no need to consider the question of service of proceedings outside of the jurisdiction. In any event, Falk J was satisfied that, had this case proceeded to court, England would have been an appropriate forum. This is an interesting statement regarding jurisdiction over assets that, by design, do not have an easily identifiably jurisdiction.\n\nCourt of Appeal\n\nEarlier this year, in Tulip Trading v Van der Laan [2023] EWCA Civ 83, the Court of Appeal unanimously decided to allow Tulip's appeal of the High Court decision, reversing Mrs Justice Falk's earlier order indicating that, in the opinion of the Court of Appeal, there is a serious issue to be tried, and also accepting that the courts of England do have jurisdiction.\n\nThis was not a trial in itself (that is set for 2024), but an order to allow the appeal to go to trial. Lord Justice Birss notes that Mrs Justice Falk's rationale that the courts of England had jurisdiction relied on the reasoning (the summary of which is detailed in paragraph 7 of the judgment) which states that: [t]here was no dispute that the cryptocurrency in issue was property \u2026 there was a good arguable case that Tulip was resident in the jurisdiction (despite being a Seychelles incorporated company) and that the property was located [in England].\n\nTherefore, Birss LJ comments (in the same paragraph) that: \"[t]he property gateway 11 (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 6B) (Gateway 11) was satisfied. For similar reasons gateway 9(a) (damage within the jurisdiction) was satisfied (paragraphs 159-164). In terms of forum, the conclusion (paragraph 168) was that there was no other jurisdiction with which the dispute had a closer link than England, or was even arguably the proper forum.\" References to Gateway 11 are explained below.\n\nSitus \u2013 jurisdiction\n\nThe overwhelming majority of international legal systems have some concept of situs for cross-border disputes. The asset type often determines how to determine its situs, with the law having developed over time to address this point in relation to different types of asset that have come into commercial use. The determination of situs is a much easier task in relation to tangible property as the country in which the asset is located is easily identified and apparent to third parties. An artificial location may be allocated to intangible property; often the place in which control over the asset is exercised, but this is an uncertain area and often difficult to ascertain.\n\nWhat are the rules on situs for immovable property, movable property and shares?\n\nGateway 11, mentioned above, gives jurisdiction to English courts where assets are physically located in England and Wales. Beyond that, rules have evolved in relation to different types of asset as discussed below:\n\nImmovable real assets: there is likely to be no challenge to where that asset is located.\n\nthere is likely to be no challenge to where that asset is located. Movable property: as discussed in Dicey, Morris and Collins on the Conflict of Laws (16th ed), during the 19th Century the law moved on to determine that movable tangibles should be governed by the law of the jurisdiction of the owner's domicile. This also made sense as these types of transfer were common for inheritance or marriage, with land still being the primary valuable asset.\n\nas discussed in Dicey, Morris and Collins on the Conflict of Laws (16th ed), during the 19th Century the law moved on to determine that movable tangibles should be governed by the law of the jurisdiction of the owner's domicile. This also made sense as these types of transfer were common for inheritance or marriage, with land still being the primary valuable asset. Shares: A share could be regarded as being situated in the location of where the register of members is kept. There may however be multiple registers in multiple countries. Where registers are kept in different countries, a court may look at the place where such shares are effectively dealt with between the company and a shareholder \u2013 if there are competing claims to jurisdiction, a court will need to decide jurisdiction on rational grounds (R v Williams [1942 ] AC 541 (Privy Council, per Viscount Maugham)).\n\nCryptoassets and situs\n\nChallenging questions are posed when trying to determine the situs of a crypto-asset \u2013 a product that, by its inherent nature and design, exists everywhere and nowhere all at once. There are no straightforward answers, but options are available as we discuss below. One question that is particularly relevant in considering the question of situs, is what the proprietary status of cryptoassets is, given their novel characteristics which distinguish them from other assets. The UK Jurisdictional Taskforce considered those features and confirmed in their Legal Statement on Cryptoassets and Smart Contracts in 2019 (the 2019 Statement) that cryptoassets possess all of the characteristics of property set out in the relevant authorities and that cryptoassets are therefore to be treated, in principle, as property.\n\nWhat are the options?\n\nIn recent years, HMRC has commented that the situs of the crypto-asset should be the residency of the beneficial owner (as per its December 2019 guidance).\n\nThe Society of Trust and Estates Practitioners (STEP), a private body for practitioners, published a guidance note in September 2021, differing in approach from that of HMRC. STEP's view is that: \"its location should be linked to the location of the private key or of the person who has control of the private key (who may or may not be the beneficial owner)\".\n\nThe UK Jurisdictional Taskforce's confirmation that cryptoassets are a form of property under English law suggests that a crypto-asset must have a location assigned to it notwithstanding its inherent design to be locationless. This is a paradox that needs further understanding. The 2019 Statement suggests that the following factors might be relevant in determining whether English and Welsh law governs the proprietary aspects of dealings in cryptoassets (in no particular order):\n\nwhether any relevant off chain asset is located in England and Wales\n\nwhether there is any centralised control in England and Wales\n\nwhether a particular cryptoasset is controlled by a particular participant in England and Wales (for example due to a private key being stored here)\n\nwhether the law applicable to the relevant transfer (perhaps by reason of the parties' choice) is English law.\n\nWhat about an artificial situs?: A further option would be the imposition of an artificial situs on a crypto-asset by following the English law legal position on non cryptoassets.\n\nIn a similar way to a share, cryptoassets rely on a form of register to document transfers: it is not therefore inconceivable that a crypto-asset may be categorised as a registered asset as all transactions will be recorded on the relevant register or blockchain.\n\nTulip's argument centres on the fact the Developers are those who are responsible for the underlying source code for the commercial banking ledgers as set out in the bitcoin protocol/ledger. It is not a huge leap to put forward the possibility that the crypto-asset could, given the control the Developers have, be situated in the jurisdiction of the Developers. This goes against every previous form of asset class under English law, but that does not necessarily mean it is incorrect \u2013 crypto as a concept is unlike any asset class ever examined before and it may well be that common law will need to adapt to its unique characteristics. This does however raise the possibility that a foreign court may reject any ruling of an English court, on the analysis that the English courts did not have jurisdiction in the first place.\n\nIt remains to be seen if this will be addressed in the Court of Appeal case \u2013 if it is, the reasoning could move forward the current law on localisation of assets and may well be a welcome guide when considering this point in future cases \u2013 that being said, this appears to be an incredibly complicated issue and there are a number of pitfalls that need to be overcome both in this jurisdiction and internationally on this question.\n\nOwnership and remedies\n\nAside from the complicated situs arguments, the question of who owns the cryptocurrency needs to be resolved. Logically, it makes sense that the ownership would need to be the first point the Court of Appeal need to decide. If the Court of Appeal determines that Tulip are not the true owners, then it is unlikely that the English courts would have jurisdiction on the case.\n\nWho are the potential owners?\n\nTulip: Tulip has asserted it is the owner of the lost cryptocurrency, however this has not been definitively determined. It has not added any third parties to its claim and asserts that it is the legal owner, despite this never being proven in a court of law. Tulip's claim to ownership would need to be analysed by a court, applying legal and equitable principles in the context of crypto.\n\nTulip has asserted it is the owner of the lost cryptocurrency, however this has not been definitively determined. It has not added any third parties to its claim and asserts that it is the legal owner, despite this never being proven in a court of law. Tulip's claim to ownership would need to be analysed by a court, applying legal and equitable principles in the context of crypto. The person who has access to the private key: STEP's approach would result in the person who has access to the private key being the owner. This would not be Tulip. The hack, albeit \"illegally\", has removed its access to the private key. The private key may therefore now be in the possession of the hacker and that person could, therefore, be considered to be the owner.\n\nSTEP's approach would result in the person who has access to the private key being the owner. This would not be Tulip. The hack, albeit \"illegally\", has removed its access to the private key. The private key may therefore now be in the possession of the hacker and that person could, therefore, be considered to be the owner. A bona fide purchaser for value without notice: Mrs Justice Falk noted that there could be rival claims to ownership from a third party who has no prior knowledge of the hack. The hacked cryptocurrency could be in the possession of a bona fide third party purchaser for value without notice. If this is the case, that purchaser may well be fall into an equitable maxim and be referred to as \"Equity's Darling\". In such a case, the court would need to decide how to deal with this, as equitable rights bind the entire world, save Equity's Darling. Were a court to agree that the Developers owe fiduciary duties, and determine the true owner to be Equity's Darling, those fiduciary duties would be owed to Equity's Darling and not to Tulip.\n\nConcluding thought\n\nBy allowing the case to go before the Court of Appeal, it is possible that the Court of Appeal may find that developers owe a duty of care to their users in the crypto space, which would be a distinguishing development in tort law. Practically speaking (and for the everyday person who has crypto), it may also offer additional protections to the consumer, in a space that (currently) offers very little protection. That being said there is no guarantee of Tulip's success in the court case and Lord Justice Birss commented that any victory by Tulip would involve a significant development of the common law of fiduciary duties. This is a case to watch out for in 2024 not only to in relation to the law on fiduciary duties, but also in relation to the lex situs of cryptoassets and, therefore, the location of competent courts.\n\nFind out more\n\nTo discuss the issues raised in this article in more detail, please contact a member of our Banking and Finance team."

        "title": "Dogecoin vs Bitcoin: Key Differences and Similarities - NewsBTC",
        "content": "What is Dogecoin?\n\nDogecoin is an alternative coin \u2014 more commonly known as an Altcoin \u2014 that was established by co-founders Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus in 2013. It was initially created as a joke \u2014 based on the well-known \u201cDoge\u201d meme.\n\nEach coin has its own blockchain infrastructure and operating system. Dogecoin runs on the same blockchain infrastructure and uses similar proof-of-work operating systems \u2014 a mathematical security system used to verify transactions and approve task execution \u2014 as Litecoin and Ethereum, with small modifications.\n\nHow is Dogecoin different from Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin and dogecoin are extremely different cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin is a widely-used, reputable coin that acts as legal tender in many countries across the world, as well as in transnational markets and industries. Dogecoin lacks the legitimacy and global infrastructure to reach the heights of Bitcoin.\n\nThey also differ drastically in market share. With Bitcoin, there\u2019s a finite number of coins available, creating a limited supply. Dogecoin has an endless supply of tokens, meaning supply can never outpace demand, leaving it in a permanently deflationary state.\n\nBoth Dogecoin and Bitcoin also run on different blockchain networks \u2014 and different advancements in blockchain technologies are one of the determining factors of market fluctuations.\n\nBitcoin runs on its own blockchain network, whereas Dogecoin piggybacks off the Ethereum blockchain, but with its own slight changes to transaction tracking and payment recording.\n\nIs Dogecoin better than Bitcoin?\n\nDeciding which cryptocurrency is better will ultimately come down to what a user is looking for from their coin.\n\nIf users are looking for transaction speeds and lower fees, Dogecoin is superior due to the Ethereum-based blockchain, being designed specifically for rapid, seamless transactions.\n\nHowever, if it\u2019s accessibility, usability and value that users are looking for, Bitcoin outperforms Dogecoin because it\u2019s more widely-used and available \u2014 meaning users have more options when it comes to making and receiving payments.\n\nFrom an investment standpoint, Bitcoin stands head and shoulders above Dogecoin. While Dogecoin is struggling to reach 1 cent in value, Bitcoin fluctuates on average between 27-30 thousand dollars per coin.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s value is based on quantifiable aspects \u2014 like its widespread usage, user popularity and limited circulation \u2014 Dogecoin doesn\u2019t have too much room for growth given its endless supply and low user uptake.\n\nDogecoin vs Bitcoin price\n\nThe difference between the current and historical price fluctuations of the two coins couldn\u2019t be more different.\n\nAt the height of its reign, Dogecoin peaked at 74 cents, having opened on the market at 0.017 cents per coin \u2014 meaning its value went up by over 9000% during the cryptocurrency boom.\n\nIn that same period, Bitcoin had a meteoric rise \u2014 peaking at over $61k and opening at $327 \u2014 growing at a percentage rate of over nine million percent from opening.\n\nBoth coins have historically reached dizzying heights \u2014 allowing those traders who were hot on the trends to see staggering profits.\n\nHowever, the popularity, accessibility and user uptake of Bitcoin means it\u2019s the more valuable coin by a wide margin.\n\nDogecoin mining vs Bitcoin mining\n\n\u201cCrypto mining\u201d is a common way for users to get hold of valuable coins.\n\nThe process of mining involves using powerful computers and high-speed internet connectivity to automatically solve a series of complex puzzles and algorithms to validate transactions and secure small portions of coins.\n\nWith enough portions, miners begin to accrue enough value to make the long process of mining worthwhile.\n\nDespite the popularity of Bitcoin, it\u2019s much more time-consuming to mine than its Dogecoin counterpart.\n\nBitcoin miners typically take around ten minutes to approve transaction blocks, whereas Dogecoin miners can approve them ten times faster, with a block every minute. Because Dogecoin runs on an adaptation of the Ethereum blockchain \u2014 which can be mined at a rate of 13 million blocks for every 700,000 Bitcoin blocks \u2014 it\u2019s significantly easier to mine.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nCan Dogecoin grow like Bitcoin?\n\nIt\u2019s extremely unlikely that Dogecoin will ever reach the value of Bitcoin for three key reasons.\n\nThe primary reason is popularity. Because of Bitcoin\u2019s widespread usage and popularity, it\u2019s infinitely more sought-after than Dogecoin.\n\nSecondly, the circulation of Dogecoins doesn\u2019t allow it to grow in the same way Bitcoin did. There is an unlimited number of Dogecoins, meaning the number will always be higher than demand. There is only a finite number of Bitcoins in circulation \u2014 meaning that demand will likely always outstrip supply, increasing its value.\n\nComparatively speaking, Dogecoin is an inflationary coin and Bitcoin is a deflationary coin, meaning Dogecoin can never grow in the same way.\n\nLastly, many reputable investors believe that the primary \u201ccrypto booms\u201d are over. Only the longstanding, widely used coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum will see substantial gains whereas meme tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu will never see these highs again in the eyes of many reputable traders.\n\nIs Dogecoin still a good investment?\n\nDespite it being a meme coin that is taken less seriously than other big players, many investors still hold Dogecoin in their portfolios.\n\nBecause you can buy a significant number of Dogecoins for incredibly low prices, even minor fluctuations can land quick profits.\n\nHowever, the risk of another cryptocurrency crash \u2014 and the volatile nature of crypto in general \u2014 means that most investors will only hold a small percentage of the coin in their portfolio to mitigate against risks like the crypto crash of 2018.\n\nWhat is the disadvantage of Dogecoin?\n\nDespite it being a well-known cryptocurrency, Dogecoin has its disadvantages \u2014 both as a cryptocurrency and an investment.\n\nSome of the disadvantages to consider when investing in Dogecoin include:\n\nLack of utility \u2014 Despite being the tenth-highest cryptocurrency in terms of value, it has almost no real-world utility. Because its value is entirely based on speculation and hype derived almost entirely from its meme background, Dogecoin is inherently unstable. It also lacks the real-world use and user uptake of larger, more practical coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n\u2014 Despite being the tenth-highest cryptocurrency in terms of value, it has almost no real-world utility. Because its value is entirely based on speculation and hype derived almost entirely from its meme background, Dogecoin is inherently unstable. It also lacks the real-world use and user uptake of larger, more practical coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. No supply cap \u2013 Because the supply of Dogecoin is endless, it can never outpace demand \u2014 ultimately limiting its potential for growth.\n\n\u2013 Because the supply of Dogecoin is endless, it can never outpace demand \u2014 ultimately limiting its potential for growth. Little supporting metrics \u2014 It historically has not been a big grower. Despite booming significantly during the crypto boom of 2017, it never exceeded a value of more than 61 cents per coin \u2014 making it an incredibly low-value asset, even at the height of its power.\n\nIs Dogecoin a good long-term investment?\n\nUnfortunately, without a significant shift in either how it functions as a cryptocurrency, market shifts or investor interest, it\u2019s unlikely investors will see long-term gains on the asset.\n\nLike all cryptocurrencies, it can act as a strong diversifier for short-term gains \u2014 given the volatile nature of the crypto market. However, its potential for long-term gains compared to established coins and tokens like Ethereum, Bitcoin and Solana, is slim.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin and other top crypto tokens were trading higher on Wednesday after Fitch's action. The global rating agency downgraded the US long-term ratings to AA+ from AAA. This downgrade comes at a time when companies are reporting relatively positive earnings.\n\n\n\nBitcoin was back in action on Wednesday as the largest crypto token gained as much as 3 per cent to regain the 29,000-mark. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, was trading higher as it gained more than 2 per cent and it climbed above the $1,850-levels. Altcoins were trading mostly up.\n\n\n\nBitcoin has surged above $29,000 in the past 24 hours . This rise could be attributed to MicroStrategy's decision to sell $750 million in stocks and utilize the funds to acquire more bitcoin. Another potential factor could be the recent downgrade of the US dollar by Fitch, indicating concerns about debt and fiscal deterioration, said Edul Patel, co-founder and CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"Interestingly, this situation stands in stark contrast to the reaction seen in 2012 when companies reacted nervously to S&P's downgrade of US debt. Investors are now eagerly anticipating the Litecoin hardening event. Meanwhile, Ethereum has been trading within a range of $1,800 to $1,900 for the past week and is currently trading around $1,867,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring the US dollar pegged Tether, all top crypto tokens were trading higher on Wednesday. Polygon surged about 4 per cent while Litecoin and BNB gained 3 per cent each. Cardano, XRP, Dogecoil and Polkadot were trading 2 per cent up each during the early day.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly higher, rising up to $1.19 trillion-mark as it jumped more than 2 per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes surged about 32 per cent to $39.93 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has reversed its bearish momentum after hitting a low of $28,500 overnight. It is currently trading near $30,000 which is an important resistance level to flip for bullish price action. BTC dominance has hit 50% again indicating that Bitcoin will lead the market in terms of volatility and movement in the near term.\n\n\n\nChart-BTC\n\n\n\nBTC is currently consolidating in the $28,500 - $31,500 range which will intersect a long-term support line at the bottom mid-month. Price is likely to revisit these lows to test as support. Its14-day RSI (at 46) indicates a neutral sentiment. If BTC breaches $30,400 after testing support, momentum will likely lead the asset to its $31,500 resistance.\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $28,800, $28,200\n\nResistance: $30,400, $31,500\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "title": "Why Is The Bitcoin And Crypto Market Up Today? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) saw a significant resurgence over the past few hours after hitting the lowest price since June 21 at $28,641 yesterday. At press time, BTC has experienced a 3.7% hike from its low. In fact, BTC even brushed past the $30,000 mark, indicating a substantial shift in market sentiment. So, the question begs.\n\nWhy Is Bitcoin Up Today?\n\n\u201cThe entire short build-up of the past couple days just got wiped,\u201d tweeted analyst Byzantine General. Data from Coinglass backs this claim and shows that BTC short positions amounting to $27.8 million were liquidated yesterday, followed by an additional $13.45 million today. This accounts for the most significant short liquidation since July 14, undeniably playing a significant role in the current price movement.\n\nBut perhaps the most influential reason for the sudden shift in market sentiment was MicroStrategy\u2019s recent announcement. The company stated that it will conduct stock sales worth $750 million. After the announcement, the Bitcoin community was abuzz with speculation that Michael Saylor might make additional, gigantic BTC purchases.\n\n\u201cAs with prior programs, we may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which include the purchase of Bitcoin as well as the repurchase or repayment of our outstanding debt,\u201d said Andrew Kang, MicroStrategy\u2019s CFO during a recent earnings call. While it remains unclear if the entire proceeds will be funneled into Bitcoin, the likelihood of a substantial chunk is certain. Directly after this announcement, Bitcoin surged by 1.6% within one hour.\n\nOn-chain analysis firm Santiment tweeted: \u201cBitcoin has breached back above $30k once again, with assistance from the many traders who capitulated during the past week of price declines. Volume is rising to kick off August, & this psychological resistance cross may shift sentiment positive.\u201d\n\nThe chart shared by the firm shows that yesterday trading volume picked up steam again, rising to the highest level since six weeks. Also, the lowest amount of profit / loss taking in 7 months indicates a capitulation event.\n\nAnalyst @52Skew added that the Bitcoin on the Binance spot market experienced a \u201creal spot demand\u201d which he wanted to see for a strong price reaction. \u201cNote the limit bid wall that pushed up price; typical with PvP conditions to force limit chasing. Marked notable liquidity on the orderbook,\u201d the analyst stated.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nHowever, he also cautioned that the 4-hour chart is so far looking like a classic Swing Failure Pattern (SFP) into a higher time-frame support / resistance. The Swing Failure Pattern, or SFP, is a type of reversal pattern where traders target stop-losses above a key swing low or below a key swing high to manipulate the price direction by generating enough liquidity.\n\nNevertheless, the market appears to be brimming with anticipation. As per @DaanCrypto: \u201cIf price starts ranging here I\u2019d look for another sweep of the lows and consolidation there. $28.5 & 29.5K are the areas of interest.\u201d Meanwhile, a break above the resistance zone at the monthly and weekly open between $29,236 and $29,300 would validate a bullish scenario where the price targets $30,000.\n\nAt press time, BTC wasn\u2019t able to reclaim the red resistance zone and was trading at $29,606.\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara /Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "When Was Bitcoin Created? Exploring the Origins of Cryptocurrency - Bitcoin Australia",
        "content": "Born from a desire to take control away from central banks and governments, Bitcoin\u2019s fascinating origins are a blend of technology, economics, and a dash of mystery. Whether you\u2019re looking to invest or just curious about what all the buzz is about, let\u2019s dive into the world of Bitcoin and explore how it all began!\n\nShort Summary\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a decentralised digital currency using blockchain technology.\n\nIts creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, envisioned it to give users more control over their finances than traditional financial systems.\n\nBitcoin has achieved major milestones and is now widely accepted but continues to face challenges such as environmental impact & price volatility that will determine its future.\n\nContents\n\nThe Birth of Bitcoin\n\nThink of the day Bitcoin was born as the beginning of a whole new world of money. Before 2009, you had to rely on physical cash or bank accounts for buying things or saving your allowance. Then came Bitcoin, a digital currency you can send over the internet, almost like sending an email, but with money! It\u2019s like having a special kind of online piggy bank that no one controls except you. Sounds cool, right? Let\u2019s find out how it all started and what went into creating this virtual currency.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto\u2019s Vision\n\nBehind Bitcoin\u2019s creation was a mysterious figure (or maybe even a group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi had a dream of a world where money wasn\u2019t controlled by banks or governments. Instead, people could send and receive money directly, without anyone else getting in the way or taking a piece of the pie. Satoshi wrote a paper explaining how it would work and shared it online. Imagine a community where everyone can trust each other without needing a middleman like a bank. That was Satoshi\u2019s vision, and it laid the groundwork for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Genesis Block\n\nOn January 3, 2009, Satoshi made the dream real by creating the very first block of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, known as the \u201cGenesis Block.\u201d This block is like the first page in a digital ledger that records every single Bitcoin transaction. Inside this Genesis Block, Satoshi left a hidden message: \u201cThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\u201d It\u2019s a bit like a secret note, hinting at the financial crisis and why Bitcoin was so important. This Genesis Block was the beginning of Bitcoin\u2019s public ledger, a chain of blocks that grew as more people started using this new kind of money. It\u2019s a trail of digital breadcrumbs that ensures everything is fair and above board. No one can cheat or mess with the records, and that\u2019s part of what makes Bitcoin so unique and exciting!\n\nUnderstanding Blockchain Technology\n\nYou know how in school, you often work on group projects where everyone can add their own ideas, but there\u2019s only one paper or presentation at the end? Blockchain technology is kind of like that, but for money and information. Imagine a shared online notebook that everyone can see and add to, but no one can erase or change what\u2019s already been written. This notebook keeps track of every Bitcoin transaction, and it\u2019s protected by some super-smart math and computer rules. Sounds intriguing, doesn\u2019t it? Let\u2019s dig into what makes this technology so special.\n\nDecentralised Ledger\n\nMost of us are used to having our money stored in a bank, right? The bank keeps track of everything, and we trust them to get it right. But in the world of Bitcoin, there\u2019s no one central bank or company in charge. Instead, the information is spread out across a network of computers all around the world. This is called a \u201cdecentralised ledger.\u201d It\u2019s like having the group project stored on everyone\u2019s computer, not just the teacher\u2019s. If one computer gets it wrong or tries to cheat, the others can catch it. This way, it\u2019s really hard for anyone to mess with the system.\n\nMining and Proof of Work\n\nNow, you might be wondering how new Bitcoins are made and how transactions get added to this shared notebook. That\u2019s where \u201cmining\u201d comes in. It\u2019s not about digging in the ground but solving complex mathematical puzzles using powerful computers. Think of it as a mega-challenging video game where the winners get rewarded with new Bitcoins. Miners, as they\u2019re called, confirm transactions and keep the network secure. It\u2019s like a competition to see who can finish the math homework first, and the winners get a golden star \u2013 or in this case, some shiny new Bitcoins!\n\nBut how do we make sure that these miners aren\u2019t cheating or taking shortcuts in their quest for Bitcoins? This is where \u201cProof of Work\u201d comes into play. It\u2019s a system that makes solving those math puzzles really hard and time-consuming, but easy to check once they\u2019re solved. Kind of like a teacher checking your answers in a math test. You\u2019ve got to show your work to prove you got it right! This Proof of Work ensures that miners are honest, and it keeps the whole Bitcoin system safe and reliable. It\u2019s the rulebook for the game, making sure everyone plays fair and square.\n\nEvolution of Bitcoin\u2019s Popularity\n\nRemember the first time you heard about Bitcoin? Maybe it was just a buzzword on the news, or perhaps a friend wouldn\u2019t stop talking about it. Either way, it\u2019s grown into something pretty huge! It\u2019s like that underground band that suddenly everyone knows about and loves. Starting from a small group of tech-savvy enthusiasts, Bitcoin has exploded in popularity, becoming a global phenomenon. Curious to know how this digital currency went from an obscure idea to a household name? Let\u2019s take a trip down memory lane!\n\nEarly Adoption and Growth\n\nIn the beginning, Bitcoin was like a secret club for computer geeks and people who really cared about privacy. It was created in 2009, but for the first couple of years, not many people knew or cared about it. Slowly, online stores started accepting Bitcoin, and some people began using it to buy stuff or even as an investment. It was like discovering a cool new hobby that only a few people knew about. Over time, more and more people started to see the value in this new kind of money, and its popularity began to grow.\n\nMajor Milestones\n\nAs Bitcoin\u2019s popularity grew, it reached some pretty exciting milestones. In 2010, someone bought two pizzas with Bitcoin, marking the first time it was used to buy something in the real world! Then, in late 2013, Bitcoin\u2019s price soared past $1,000 for the first time. More recently, big companies started accepting Bitcoin, and governments have begun to recognise it. It\u2019s even been traded on major stock exchanges through ETF products. Each of these milestones shows how Bitcoin has become more accepted and mainstream.\n\nChallenges and Criticisms\n\nYou know how even the coolest new video game or the latest blockbuster movie might have some flaws? Well, Bitcoin, despite being an exciting innovation, has its own set of challenges and criticisms. It\u2019s not all sunshine and rainbows in the world of digital currency. Just like when your favorite band releases a song that\u2019s not quite a hit, Bitcoin has faced some issues that have people talking and debating. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the bumps in the road that Bitcoin has come across, like its impact on the environment and the wild rollercoaster ride of its price.\n\nEnvironmental Impact\n\nBitcoin mining, that computer-powered puzzle-solving we talked about earlier, takes a whole lot of energy. In fact, it uses up more electricity than some entire countries! Picture all the gaming consoles in the world running non-stop, and you\u2019ll get an idea of how much power it takes. This has led to concerns about the impact on the environment, especially if the energy comes from sources that aren\u2019t so green. It\u2019s like leaving all the lights on in your house 24/7; it\u2019s not great for the planet. Some people are working on making Bitcoin more eco-friendly, but it\u2019s still a big issue that divides opinions.\n\nPrice Volatility\n\nHave you ever been on a rollercoaster that goes up and down so much it makes your head spin? That\u2019s what the price of Bitcoin can be like. One day it\u2019s skyrocketing, and the next day, it might drop dramatically. This wild ride makes it exciting for some but nerve-wracking for others. This price volatility makes it tricky for people to use Bitcoin like regular money or even as an investment. It\u2019s like trying to play a game with ever-changing rules, and not everyone\u2019s comfortable with that.\n\nThe Future of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin has had an incredible journey so far, full of highs, lows, twists, and turns, but what\u2019s going to happen in the future? Will it become the money of tomorrow, or is it just a trend that might fade away? The future of Bitcoin is like an unwritten book, filled with possibilities. Let\u2019s explore some of the chapters that might unfold, like how it could grow to handle more people and what governments might have to say about it.\n\nScalability Solutions\n\nRight now, Bitcoin can only handle a limited number of transactions at once. Imagine your favorite online game server crashing because too many players are trying to join. That\u2019s the challenge Bitcoin faces as it becomes more popular. But don\u2019t worry, some really smart people are working on solutions to make Bitcoin\u2019s system bigger and faster without losing what makes it special. This might include new technologies and updates that help it handle more transactions, like adding extra lanes to a highway. If they can crack this problem, it could be a game-changer for how we use money in the future.\n\nRegulatory Landscape\n\nGovernments and regulators around the globe are trying to figure out how Bitcoin fits into existing laws and what new rules might be needed. Some countries are welcoming Bitcoin with open arms, while others are more cautious. How governments decide to regulate (or not regulate) Bitcoin could have a big impact on how it grows, who uses it, and even what it\u2019s worth. This legal landscape is a bit like navigating a maze, and it\u2019s a crucial part of what the future might hold for this exciting digital currency.\n\nSummary\n\nSo there you have it, the story of Bitcoin, a virtual currency that started as a dream in the mind of a mysterious creator and grew into a global sensation. From its birth and the groundbreaking technology behind it, to its rise in popularity and the challenges it faces, Bitcoin has truly carved out a place in our modern world. Whether it\u2019s the excitement of mining, the debates over its environmental impact, or the curious future it holds, Bitcoin is more than just a buzzword. It\u2019s a glimpse into a future where money might work differently, a thrilling and sometimes puzzling ride that we all get to watch, and maybe even be a part of. Just like a gripping novel or a thrilling movie, Bitcoin\u2019s story isn\u2019t over, and who knows what the next chapter might hold?\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWho is the creator of Bitcoin?\n\nThe creator of Bitcoin is known as Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonym for a person or group that remains anonymous. In 2008, Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper, introducing the concept of blockchain technology, a decentralised and secure way to conduct peer-to-peer digital currency transactions. This innovation, free from third-party intervention, paved the way for the creation of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat is the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining?\n\nBitcoin mining\u2019s environmental impact is a significant concern due to its high energy consumption. The process requires substantial computational power, resulting in considerable carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming. The need for sustainable solutions to reduce the environmental footprint of Bitcoin mining is crucial for the long-term viability of cryptocurrencies. Efforts are underway to find eco-friendly alternatives that maintain the security features of Bitcoin while lowering power consumption.\n\nWhat is the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin?\n\nThe regulatory landscape for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is evolving as governments and regulators work to strike a balance between encouraging innovation and protecting consumers. Measures such as KYC (Know Your Customer) protocols, Anti-Money Laundering regulations, and specific crypto asset legislation are being implemented worldwide. These regulations are designed to control the use of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, ensuring customer safety while fostering the growth of this groundbreaking financial technology."

        "content": "With the price of Bitcoin (BTC) demonstrating a largely sideways movement trend over the last seven days, senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Mike McGlone has expressed concern over the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset underperforming.\n\nSpecifically, McGlone stated that Bitcoin seems alone under the radar of the United States regulatory crackdown, which means that it should be outperforming most risk assets, but it isn\u2019t, as he explained in a social media post shared on August 2.\n\nBitcoin acting out of order\n\nAccording to the analyst, \u201cin decline vs. the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index since the 2021 peak and April bounce, waning Bitcoin may presage rising headwinds for itself and the broad crypto market. \u201d Furthermore, he noted, if the asset \u201cfulfills what some consider the fastest-horse-in-the-race mantra, it seems logical Bitcoin should outperform in an everything bull market,\u201d but \u201cit\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nAs he further specified, Bloomberg\u2019s graphic indicates this might be taking place due to \u201cthe most aggressive liquidity pull from central banks in history\u201d and the Federal Reserve \u201ctightening in the third quarter despite the producer price index finished-goods gauge at minus 3.1% and dropping from 2022\u2019s 18.3% peak at its fastest pace since 1948.\u201d\n\nAccording to McGlone, Bitcoin could be sniffing out the above factors and responding to them. Moreover, he also stressed that both the Nasdaq and Bitcoin were up just over 20% on a one-year basis but that the maiden crypto asset\u2019s volatility was about two times higher.\n\nBitcoin/Nasdaq index vs. federal funds future. Source: Mike McGlone\n\nBitcoin versus other assets\n\nEarlier in May, McGlone shared his expectation that gold was likely to demonstrate dominance and continue to outperform Bitcoin in the following months when the precious metal sought to attain new highs, as highlighted by the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio at the time.\n\nIn June, he noted that Bitcoin was facing its first recession and a potential equity bear market in the US, as it trails the recent Nasdaq Index gains and was under the effect of federal funds futures that were \u201cshowing little potential for additional liquidity fuel,\u201d and that the approval of a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) would not shield it from the consequences.\n\nMore recently, the commodities expert voiced his opinion that the second half of 2023 could \u201cdefine the benchmark crypto as a high-beta version of the stock market, or for its potential to be digital gold in a world going that way,\u201d as Finbold reported on July 7.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nIn the meantime, Bitcoin was changing hands at the price of $29,486, which represents a 2.20% gain in the last 24 hours and an increase of 1.09% across the previous seven days, although it is recording a loss of 3.78% on its monthly chart, as the recent data indicates.\n\nBitcoin 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nMeanwhile, crypto trading expert Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe has stated there might be a case for Bitcoin declining to $12,000 or retesting at the lows, but that a similar situation had occurred in 2019 when indicators suggested that Bitcoin had to retest $3,000 and go to $2,000 when it was trending up.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
