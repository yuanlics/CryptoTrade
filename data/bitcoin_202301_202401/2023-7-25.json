        "content": "Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies receive a significant amount of attention from the press compared to other industries, and press is vital for the success of any political candidate. As a result, many politicians are taking strong stances on crypto policy, one way or the other, because it can boost their public profile. Senator JD Vance (R-Ohio), for example, won his first term in 2022, in part, by positioning himself as a pro-Bitcoin candidate. Moreover, in the 2022 New York Governor\u2019s race (the closest one in decades), both Kathy Hochul and Lee Zeldin were asked during their first public debate to share their views on Bitcoin and Bitcoin data centers \u2013 a topic never raised in previous election years. It\u2019s clear that, whatever the political viewpoint, Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly important election issue."

        "title": "3 Reasons Every Investor Should Own at Least a Little Bitcoin - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "In a financial and political landscape filled with uncertainties, one asset has emerged as a beacon of hope for investors seeking a truly decentralized and resilient asset: Bitcoin (BTC 0.43%). With its unique attributes and growing acceptance, the cryptocurrency is proving that it deserves a spot in every investor's portfolio.\n\nWhile the amount of exposure will vary by individual preferences, evidence is mounting that some sort of allocation of the world's most valuable cryptocurrency is not a luxury but becoming more of a necessity. Here are three reasons every investor should seriously consider owning some Bitcoin as part of a diversified portfolio.\n\n1. Economic sovereignty through decentralization\n\nOne of Bitcoin's most compelling features lies in its decentralization, free from any governmental policies or interference. Unlike traditional fiat currencies subject to inflation and manipulation by central banks, the digital coin operates independently across thousands of nodes spread out around the globe.\n\nUnlike other cryptocurrencies and especially fiat currencies, there is no single entity with control of the network. This means that Bitcoin's sound monetary policy is virtually impossible to change and provides investors with confidence that it will continue to run just as it has since it was created in 2009.\n\nInvestors who hold it can preserve value outside of the existing financial system, which has its strings pulled by governments. Bailing out banks, providing stimulus checks to citizens, and financing ever-growing debt provide benefits in the short term. But these policies are enacted without the consent of individuals, ultimately eroding the purchasing power of their hard-earned money. Bitcoin provides an alternative.\n\n2. Inherent scarcity and diminishing supply growth\n\nBesides decentralization, Bitcoin has another compelling aspect that sets it apart from traditional fiat currencies: its scarcity and the diminishing rate of supply growth. Unlike fiat currencies, which face constant inflationary pressures and have an unlimited supply, Bitcoin's supply is strictly limited to 21 million coins.\n\nFurthermore, the mechanism of halvings, a process hardwired into its code, ensures that fewer and fewer bitcoins enter circulation approximately every four years.\n\nToday, Bitcoin's supply growth rate stands at roughly 1.75%. And come April 2024, the next halving event will slash this rate to less than 1%; about four years after that, it will be cut in half again. This process will continue until 2140, when the last bitcoin is mined.\n\nThe remarkable aspect of this is the certainty and transparency surrounding this process, as Bitcoin's open-source code allows anyone to peer into its inner workings and functionality. In stark contrast, fiat currencies lack this level of certainty or transparency, leaving people vulnerable to the unpredictable consequences of inflation and weak monetary policy.\n\nAs the antithesis to fiat currencies, Bitcoin brings a sense of stability and predictability. Investors and users can rest assured that the supply will never exceed the predetermined limit of 21 million, and the scheduled halving events ensure a gradual reduction in its supply growth rate.\n\n3. Growing institutional adoption and recognition\n\nIt might seem like the chance to capitalize on Bitcoin has passed, considering its appreciation of more than 12,000% in the past 10 years, but in fact there might not be a better time.\n\nBitcoin's unique characteristics are slowly becoming recognized by people around the world, and more recently by large institutional players. While its initial rise was attributed to common retail investors, the entrance of institutional participants is further legitimizing the asset and could add unprecedented demand to the limited supply.\n\nLeading companies like Tesla and MicroStrategy pioneered the concept of holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets in 2021. But today, this trend has evolved even further as industry leaders such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco are exploring the introduction of the crypto to the stock market.\n\nThese firms plan to introduce spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, hoping to provide a product that can be traded on the stock market. That will help democratize access and enable millions of people to add itBitcoin to 401(k) plans, pension funds, and other traditional investment portfolios, potentially creating unprecedented demand for the scarce supply.\n\nThe opportunity at hand\n\nDespite showing signs of diminishing volatility, Bitcoin remains one of the more volatile assets available today, and this should be accounted for by investors based on their risk tolerance. Although this can be helpful in bull markets as its price grows exponentially, in bear markets it could prove to be problematic for those looking to control risk.\n\nHowever, aside from its volatility, Bitcoin's unique qualities could be beneficial to those with more appetite for risk. As recognition of these qualities continues to grow and deep-pocketed institutions pile in, a potentially lucrative opportunity presents itself. In doing so, investors can reclaim their economic sovereignty and benefit from evolving dynamics around supply and demand."

        "title": "Bitcoin Maximalist: Why Bitcoin Is Not the Next AOL| White Coat Investor - The White Coat Investor",
        "content": "By Anonymous Guest Writer\n\nLike most people who first discover Bitcoin, I learned about it as its rapidly inflating price was making the news. This was in 2017, and I was wrapping up my Neurology residency. The news proclaimed that \u201cblockchain technology\u201d would one day change the world but that Bitcoin itself was only part of that broader technology and not the technology itself. I assumed they were correct. I assumed that the bubble would eventually burst since Bitcoin was being portrayed in the news as the next \u201cTulip Mania.\u201d\n\nSure enough, Bitcoin began a long decline in late 2017 in what has been called \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d Bitcoin started around $1,000 in 2017 and hit a peak of $20,000 in December of that year. By February 2018, Bitcoin\u2019s price had tumbled to around $8,500.\n\nAfter the bubble popped, I gave Bitcoin no more thought for the next several years and assumed it would continue an inexorable decline toward $0. This is because I hadn\u2019t done the work to learn about it. I assumed what I was told\u2014that it was a bubble\u2014was correct without giving it any more thought.\n\nI next heard about Bitcoin again in late 2020 when all assets were on a stimulus-induced sugar high following the rapid COVID crash and the resulting trillions of dollars pumped into the money supply. To my surprise, Bitcoin had not died off, and it was actually rapidly approaching its prior all-time high.\n\nThis is when I first invested in Bitcoin.\n\nI did not understand it yet, but speculation was plentiful at that time, including the birth of \u201cmeme stocks.\u201d Investing in Bitcoin seemed like an easy way to make some money, given how all risk assets were booming with no end in sight. White coat investors don\u2019t allocate high percentages of their income to these sorts of things, but I figured 5% or less as \u201cplay money\u201d couldn\u2019t hurt and was within reason. The rest of my portfolio was still all US and international market cap-weighted ETFs.\n\nI now view my Bitcoin investment as much more than \u201cplay money\u201d or mere speculation. I view it as a hedge against the fiat monetary system and a truly unique asset. I only developed this view gradually after a couple of years of careful analysis and thought.\n\nDr. Jim Dahle has argued that he is more or less neutral on crypto as an asset class, and he thinks we as high-income professionals do not need crypto in our portfolios. He also stated that even if crypto does thrive, Bitcoin is akin to AOL, and it will not be the winner when all is said and done. This guest post will hopefully provide you with some insight into my journey down the crypto rabbit hole and why I now view Bitcoin as NOT the next AOL but rather as the prime crypto asset with a chance to provide every individual with property rights and power over oppression from governments.\n\nThis is the story of why Bitcoin is now a core holding in my portfolio\u2014and why I think Bitcoin also belongs in your portfolio.\n\nDown the Rabbit Hole\n\nOnce I invested in Bitcoin, I quickly learned more and more about it, and I went fully down the crypto rabbit hole. It all seemed easy enough to pick up. Bitcoin was \u201cdigital gold\u201d to be used as a store of value. All the rest were \u201caltcoins.\u201d Ethereum was \u201cdigital oil\u201d to be used in the daily grind of processing smart contracts via its \u201cEthereum Virtual Machine\u201d on the blockchain. And there were a host of other smaller cryptocurrencies\u2014Solana, Polkadot, Cardano, Avalanche\u2014that were the so-called Layer 1 protocols\u2014which were faster, cheaper alternatives vying for Ethereum\u2019s coveted No. 2 spot for total market cap in crypto. This was in addition to stablecoins like USDC, BUSD, and Tether (among others).\n\nI figured that even though no ETF existed for cryptocurrencies, I would dollar-cost-average into some of them each month to create a roughly market-weighted collection. I could then be a part of a technology that seemed poised to have a bright future before \u201cinstitutional investors\u201d would pour their money into them and drive their prices soaring. My investment at this time was fully geared toward speculation.\n\nMore information here:\n\nWhat\u2019s the Future of Cryptocurrency? These Fanatics Say It\u2019s Pretty Darn Bright\n\nBitcoin ETFs: What You Need to Know and Should You Invest?\n\nAltcoins, the Role of Venture Capitalists in Crypto, and \u2018Sh*tcoin Casinos'\n\nSpend any time on \u201ccrypto Twitter\u201d or Reddit, and you\u2019ll quickly run into the term \u201ctoxic Bitcoin maximalist.\u201d This term refers to anyone who feels that Bitcoin is the only worthwhile cryptocurrency and that all others are scams\u2014not \u201caltcoins\u201d but \u201csh*tcoins.\u201d I didn\u2019t understand this viewpoint at first. Surely, I thought, diversification made the most sense and that it was the most reasonable approach.\n\nAs I delved deeper into crypto, however, I began to see their point. I learned that pretty much every altcoin has a marketing team and a \u201cfoundation\u201d that, in effect, acts like the board of a company and ultimately drives the direction of the development of the altcoin. Prior to \u201cgoing public\u201d and releasing their tokens for sale to the public, all of these altcoins already had made substantial numbers of the tokens available to venture capitalist insiders. See the figure below for percentages of insider allocations by various popular altcoins (it\u2019s 0% for Bitcoin).\n\nAfter everyone on the inside has their share of cheap coins, they then release the coins to the public, publicize them aggressively to pump up their price, and use retail investors as exit liquidity while the price often dumps.\n\nThese altcoins are all securities, and their founders and financial backers are selling these securities to the public without due disclosures. They all pass what\u2019s known as the Howey Test used by the SEC to determine whether a transaction qualifies as a security. To pass the Howey Test, a transaction must involve: 1) an investment of money, 2) in a common enterprise, 3) for a reasonable expectation of profit, 4) and derived from the effort of others. Every altcoin is a security. The exception is possibly stablecoins which do not stand a reasonable expectation of profit, as they are expected to remain pegged 1:1 to the currency which they are designed to track.\n\nIn effect, every single altcoin on the market, with the exception of stablecoins, is a security. The good ones are essentially fledgling companies with no products of real utility that are committing securities fraud. The bad ones are Ponzi schemes committing security fraud. We saw this play out when the Luna altcoin famously imploded over almost 24 hours, evaporating almost $40 billion of wealth overnight. Before Luna, there have been countless rug pulls after rug pulls. Even several crypto \u201ccustodians\u201d and exchanges such as Celsius, Voyager, BlockFi, and FTX\u2014all funded by venture capital\u2014went under due to a combination of abysmal risk management and outright fraud. As I write this, Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world, has just been sued by the US government for fraudulently trading against its users for profit. The world of venture capital and altcoin is a cesspool.\n\nBitcoin maximalists call the companies that sell altcoins \u201csh*tcoin casinos,\u201d and after following this industry for the last couple of years, boy do I ever agree with this sentiment. You might get lucky by buying these altcoins on their way up and make a huge gain, but more likely, you\u2019ll only ever hear about them after a pump and you'd end up riding the losses down.\n\nThe odds are forever stacked in favor of the founders and against you and me. I personally made tens of thousands on altcoins, and as crypto crashed, I lost those tens of thousands. More and more, I began to view Bitcoin as the prime crypto asset and focused most of my attention on learning why Bitcoin maximalists think it\u2019s so darn special. I eventually paused my investments in non-Bitcoin crypto in 2022, and in early 2023, I made the decision to close all of my non-Bitcoin positions and focus only on investing in Bitcoin as a crypto asset. More on this below.\n\nMore information here:\n\n13 Lessons to Learn from Sam Bankman-Fried and the FTX Meltdown\n\nBitcoin Is Unique from Crypto\n\nBitcoin separates itself from all the altcoins not just because it \u201ccame first\u201d and because it's the most well-known cryptocurrency. It stands out for many reasons. Its founder(s) are not known, only existing by a pseudonym known as Satoshi Nakamoto, whose identity was never discovered and who seemed to completely disappear early in the life of the project. No Bitcoins were ever dropped out of the air or \u201cpre-mined\u201d to the founders or any insiders for their benefit. Even Satoshi Nakamoto himself had to use electricity and his own CPU to mine the first Bitcoins. Anyone who knew about Bitcoin could do the same.\n\nThis is in direct contrast to other cryptos that allocate ample control and wealth to their founders and venture capital-backed investors before making it available to the public. Bitcoin has no CEO. Bitcoin has no marketing department. Bitcoin is not a security. Anyone with electricity and an ASIC machine can mine Bitcoin, just as anyone with electricity and heavy machinery can pull oil out of the ground or dig gold out of the earth. Bitcoin is a digital commodity\u2014the first ever and only digital commodity. It\u2019s the only cryptocurrency viewed by Gary Gensler and the SEC as a commodity, and he has made this point numerous times publicly. He\u2019s also made the inverse point\u2014that all other cryptocurrencies are securities\u2014many times.\n\nBitcoin as a Store of Value\n\nWhat really made me realize the importance of a good store of value was when I started listening to interviews with Michael Saylor\u2014who is, in essence, a Bitcoin maximalist who famously has placed his company, MicroStrategy, on the \u201cBitcoin Standard\u201d by converting all of its treasury to Bitcoin.\n\nLet\u2019s say you have $1 million and you want to pass it down so that 100 years from now, your great-great-grandchildren can receive it and have the same buying power that it has today. What do you do? You certainly wouldn\u2019t keep it in cash. In the past 100 years, $1 million would have become around $40,000.\n\nYou could buy real estate, but then you\u2019d have to keep up with maintenance costs while also paying property taxes. You could rent out the house, but you\u2019d have to have a competent property manager and you\u2019d be at the whim of the local real estate market. What if the house is in the next Detroit? And what if you live in the developing world and your chances of buying a house in the US are akin to the average American\u2019s ability to buy a professional sports team as a store of value?\n\nYou could buy a basket of stocks. We take this for granted in the US, but there are 2 billion individuals across the world who are unbanked and who have no hope to partake in the returns that equities have to offer. Moreover, when times have gotten tough for countries or when governments have taken a hard turn, entire stock markets have been shut down and all the wealth \u201cstored\u201d in them evaporated overnight.\n\nNext up is gold. Gold has been the most enduring store of value in human history. Why? Because it\u2019s \u201chard money.\u201d If your civilization uses seashells as a store of value because they take time and energy to collect but a technology is developed that allows for the extraction of unlimited amounts of seashells from the ocean, seashells will become valueless. Even for other metals such as copper and nickel, if their price goes up sufficiently, people will become incentivized to increase their production such that those who use these metals as a store of value will soon find themselves without any value left at all.\n\nGold, however, is remarkably hard to mine, and despite wild fluctuations in its price, its total supply increases relatively slowly each year. According to the CME group, from 1965 until 2020, the annual growth in the percentage of gold has been remarkably consistent between 1.1% to a max of 2.1% per year. Even with a meager 1.5% inflation rate, $1 million would be whittled down to only $220,000 over 100 years. And although gold has been the best store of value we\u2019ve had as a society, it has its flaws. In a digital world, how can you transmit gold across the world to pay for a good or service? How do you easily divide it as needed to pay for small amounts of goods? And if war does break out, lugging around a large suitcase of gold certainly would not be inconspicuous.\n\nWith every area of weakness that gold has, Bitcoin shines. It is highly portable\u2014all you must do is remember 12 words and you can take a lifetime\u2019s worth of wealth anywhere in the world. It\u2019s highly divisible\u2014the smallest unit of Bitcoin, one Satoshi, is currently only 2 cents. It cannot be counterfeited. A bar of gold could be filled with various metals plated with gold making it hard to verify its authenticity quickly, but Bitcoin can be verified by your own node in your own home within seconds. It\u2019s incredibly scarce\u2014its current inflation rate is 1.8%, and this will be cut in half every four years. Ninety percent of the supply has already been mined. This means that the cumulative rate of inflation over the next 120 years will be 10%, or 0.08% per year over this period.\n\nThis next point is a very important one. History has shown that, over time, value flows from weak stores of value to strong ones. This is why societies no longer use seashells, glass beads, copper, nickel, or other similar metals as stores of value. Bitcoin has the best technical characteristics of any store of value that has existed in the history of man, and it\u2019s readily available to anyone with an internet connection and a smartphone\u2014in any amount from a fraction of a penny to billions of dollars. Billions of dollars can be transacted within minutes across the world with absolute finality in a non-censorable way with no need for trusted intermediaries. This is absolutely unprecedented in human history. There is no other technology that has done this. As time goes on, how much of the purported $400 trillion of global wealth will flow into it?\n\nBitcoin as a Weapon Against Tyranny: Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake\n\nEven more importantly than any of the above, Bitcoin, unlike any altcoin, is truly decentralized. This is its greatest strength. In early 2022, the government of Canada halted bank transactions that were sent to support participants in demonstrations against COVID mandates. The banks did not put up a fight. They had to comply. A democratic government took an autocratic turn, and the current banking system was absolutely inept and unwilling to fight for its customers.\n\nBitcoin transactions to the protestors, however, could not be stopped. Bitcoin has no CEO or board to \u201cgo to\u201d to reverse a transaction or freeze an account. It is truly permissionless and uncensorable. Contrast this with Ethereum whose \u201cTornado Cash\u201d app was effectively shut down by the US government. There are also several instances of the USDC stablecoin, which runs on Ethereum and several other Layer 1 chains, holding certain transactions from going through. This can happen because most protocols besides Bitcoin are \u201cDINO\u201d\u2014decentralized in name only.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons people call Bitcoin \u201coutdated technology\u201d and argue it will be replaced by a cheaper, more energy-efficient crypto is that Bitcoin uses what's known as Proof of Work (POW). Most other cryptos, including Ethereum, use Proof of Stake (POS). In brief, POW requires \u201cminers\u201d to make guesses via a specific algorithm (SHA-256) that requires brute force to guess a specific number. Once guessed, it can be readily verified by any \u201cnode\u201d within seconds. The computers that mine Bitcoin are making these guesses to the tune of about 350 quintillion guesses per second. As more miners exist to make guesses, the Bitcoin algorithm automatically adjusts to become harder. This is what guarantees that Bitcoin cannot inflate any more than it is programmed to do\u2014the more people mine it, the harder it gets to mine. All of these machines require electricity. In today's world, with people's concern about electricity use and global warming, it's clear to see why some attack Bitcoin due to its electricity usage.\n\nMost other cryptos use POS to be more energy efficient. This uses a \u201cstaked\u201d or locked amount of crypto and much lower computational power\u2014thus, much less electricity. \u201cBad actors\u201d would lose their staked crypto, thus incentivizing good behavior by the transaction validators. Unfortunately, POS's fatal flaw is that those with larger amounts of crypto will see power accrue to them disproportionately over time, similar to what happens in systems with fiat currencies. In our economy, those with more starting capital make a profit much more easily on their capital over time, and the effects can be monumental over generations and contribute to income inequality and oligarchies.\n\nSimilarly, those with more Ethereum to start with (insiders and the Ethereum Foundation) will only gain more Ethereum and more power over the network in the long run. In contrast to this, Bitcoin's POW mechanism ensures that regardless of how much Bitcoin you may have, you do not get more control over the network. Anyone can stand to mine just as much Bitcoin as anyone else if they \u201cdo the work.\u201d\n\nIt's this essential feature of POW that makes it absolutely necessary to have a truly decentralized cryptocurrency over time. Without proof of work, anyone\u2019s control or power in the system can be changed at the click of a button by the foundation of an altcoin\u2014a crucial hindrance to wide trust and adoption. It\u2019s just numbers on a screen with every crypto besides Bitcoin. Once you understand this, you see that Bitcoin's \u201cbug\u201d of relying on \u201coutdated\u201d POW is its shining feature. And in the POW world of crypto, Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate is 1 million times higher than the two next largest POW cryptos (Dogecoin and Litecoin).\n\nBitcoin is the 800-pound gorilla of truly decentralized cryptocurrencies, and the next two largest are the 0.0008-pound fleas on its back.\n\nMore information here:\n\nTop 7 Uses for Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin Stands Alone: Why Bitcoin Belongs in Your Portfolio\n\nNow, you may be telling yourself that all of the above is well and good, but why the heck should you care about it and why should you have Bitcoin in your portfolio? I recently decided to sell my other cryptos and go 100% Bitcoin for my portfolio\u2019s 10% crypto allocation. I chose this percentage because I believe a reasonable price target will be at least $250,000 per Bitcoin if it becomes a global store of value protocol (more on this below), and this would represent a nice boost to my overall returns without risking too much capital.\n\nI could retire just fine without this 10%, but I would get a meaningful boost in spending power if this 10% of my portfolio does a 10x. Even so, we, as physicians, would be just fine from an investment return standpoint never investing in Bitcoin. We could settle for market average returns. We don\u2019t need home runs. However, as I tried to argue above, Bitcoin is not some hot stock. Its unique properties of decentralization and uncensorability make it a special asset to hold.\n\nConsider this quote from Vladimir Lenin: \u201cThere are centuries when nothing happens, and there are weeks when centuries happen.\u201d We all saw this play out firsthand in early 2020 when mask mandates were rapidly rolled out (and were welcomed by most), trillions of dollars were printed, and our day-to-day lives were completely upended. We saw it again when the relative post-Cold War peace between global powers abruptly ended as Russia started its treacherous campaign into Ukraine in early 2022.\n\nThe events of these last few years are not without consequence. Consider (figures below) the total US dollar money supply (M2), the total assets held by the federal reserve, and the total US public debt. It\u2019s not a surprise to most people that the US has a tremendous debt of $31 trillion and an extra $60 trillion in unfunded Social Security and Medicare liabilities. How does the US pay off its bill? It can either raise taxes or continue to borrow and balloon the deficit further.\n\nThis is not a new problem. Since the time of the Roman Empire, largess in spending has led to hard decisions about how to reign in the deficit, and time and time again, it\u2019s proven more politically expedient to debase the currency and cause a \u201csoft default\u201d over time rather than raise taxes. As for the Romans, they debased their currency by diluting their coins with cheaper metals. As for the US, Richard Nixon took the US off the gold standard and the US unofficially defaulted on its debt in 1971 with the ability to print more money as needed. We thankfully have remained the world\u2019s global reserve currency despite this.\n\nUnfortunately, the US government recently decided to weaponize the US dollar against Russia. This served our strategic interests in the short term, but undoubtedly in the long term, it will make all countries that store their wealth in the dollar question if their wealth, too, can be frozen as a political weapon. Ultimately, all fiat currencies have suffered the same fate in the end.\n\nI highly recommend \u201cBig Debt Crises\u201d and \u201cPrinciples for Dealing with the Changing World Order\u201d by Ray Dalio for much more comprehensive information and background about what governments have historically done during these times. In short, if hyperinflation hits the US, it might be hard and it may be fast. Capital controls would likely be quickly enacted, and bank accounts and brokerages would possibly be frozen. Just as COVID mandates were not seen as overt intrusions by the government by most citizens\u2014especially at the time\u2014most will likely welcome these \u201cnecessary measures.\u201d It would then become glaringly obvious that all of our portfolios were just numbers on a screen.\n\nJ.P. Morgan said before Congress in 1912, \u201cGold is money. Everything else is credit.\u201d Governments began to seize gold from the populace at large around World War I in the case of Britain and in 1933 in the US with Executive Order 6102, making gold illegal to hold for 41 years and stripping the individual of power while giving vast amounts of it to the government. Consider also that in the not-so-distant future, global governments, including the US, will be rolling out Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) which will give governments and central banks unprecedented oversight into how we spend our money and what we are allowed to do with that money. Central bankers want to boost the economy? In the next recession, they could program your money to either be spent on goods or sit idly in your checking account, losing x% per year as a penalty for not spending, while simultaneously being programmed such that it can\u2019t be sent to any brokerage. Buy too much carbon-positive beef this month? Your CBDC is turned off from buying more beef until next month.\n\nI know all of the above must make it seem like I\u2019m a raving Orwellian who sits in his basement clutching a shotgun waiting for the world to end. I promise I\u2019m not! However, I am a realist and a student of history. As Jim has said many times to all white coat investors, the real risk to a portfolio is not volatility but rather it\u2019s inflation, deflation, confiscation, and devastation. Holding Bitcoin won\u2019t stop a bomb from dropping on my head, and stocks and real estate do well enough dealing with inflation over the long run. Holding Bitcoin does, however, provide me with true protection against confiscation in a way that stocks, bonds, and real estate do not. No one can take away my Bitcoin or dictate how I spend it. No one government can place capital controls on it. This property makes Bitcoin an invaluable part of any portfolio, even that of a white coat investor.\n\nI invest 90% in stocks hoping for the best. I invest 10% in Bitcoin prepared for the worst.\n\nIn summary, Bitcoin is wonderfully unique. It\u2019s a truly decentralized protocol that, unlike all other cryptocurrencies, is not a company or run by any organization or group.\n\nBitcoin has no competition; any cryptocurrency that appears to compete with it crumbles away under any real analysis. Bitcoin is insurance. Bitcoin protects against currency debasement by providing an exit ramp from fiat currency if a global fiat debt crisis occurs. Like any insurance, it\u2019s best bought before you need it. Bitcoin is freedom money\u2014the separation of money and state. You don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission to spend it, and no one\u2014not even the almighty government\u2014can stop you from spending it when and how you like. Bitcoin is digital scarcity. No matter how valuable it becomes, it is programmed to only be produced in diminishing amounts each year; this is codified and cannot be changed in response to price or political pressure. Bitcoin is digital property. It gives every human on earth who has a smartphone and internet access to property that cannot be confiscated under coercion.\n\n\n\nBitcoin is not the next AOL. It\u2019s a protocol growing stronger by the day with no competition, and it's already too big to be stopped. Bitcoin is the next TCP/IP upon which AOL and the internet were built, but for money. Bitcoin may well stand to be the future base layer protocol of the global monetary system.\n\nMore information here:\n\nWhy I\u2019m Still Buying Crypto\n\nAppendix: Answers to Common Criticisms of Bitcoin\n\n#1 Bitcoin Is Too Volatile to Hold\n\nThe least volatile asset to hold is the US dollar. It\u2019s lost 88% of its purchasing power since 1971. For those who understand what they own and only allocate a responsible portion of their portfolio to it, it can be a wonderful complement to other assets in a portfolio. What I look at to value Bitcoin\u2019s success is not its price. Instead, it's 1) the growth of the number of users in the network, 2) the growth of its security (ie., its hash rate), and 3) the growth of conviction of the users of the network.\n\n1) The number of Bitcoin addresses with a non-zero balance has been steadily growing since its inception according to @IntoTheBlock.\n\n2) Despite fluctuations in its price (black line in the chart below, via Blockchain.com), Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate (blue line) has been up and to the right since its inception. The only hiccup was in 2021 when China banned Bitcoin mining, but it quickly recovered as miners relocated, demonstrating the resilience of the network.\n\n3) Despite all of its price fluctuations, most of those who own Bitcoin understand it and know what they own\u2014and they aren\u2019t selling. Fifty percent of Bitcoin has not moved in more than two years, an all-time high. This only serves to increase its scarcity.\n\n#2 You Can\u2019t Actually Spend It\n\nApproximately 15,000 businesses worldwide accept Bitcoin. Additionally, companies such as Strike exist that can convert Bitcoin to local currency, instantly allowing you to spend Bitcoin even where it\u2019s not directly accepted.\n\n#3 It Takes Too Long for Transactions to Settle\n\nThe Bitcoin block time is approximately every 10 minutes. However, the Lightning Network, which has been rapidly increasing in the number of transactions in the last couple of years, can settle transactions on top of the base Bitcoin network in seconds with finality.\n\n#4 Bitcoin Can Only Handle a Limited Number of Transactions Per Second\n\nThis is a common argument made by the other so-called Layer 1 cryptocurrencies. There is a commonly cited \u201cTrilemma\u201d in cryptocurrency: speed, security, and scalability. You can only have two out of the three on the base layer. Bitcoin has opted for speed and security. However, this is not a real problem as Layer 2 solutions, like the Lightning Network, enable exponentially more transactions than the base layer allows, vastly increasing scalability and eliminating this problem.\n\n#5 Bitcoin Is a Ponzi Scheme; It\u2019s Not \u2018Worth' Anything; There\u2019s No Way to Know How Much Bitcoin Will Go Up or Down in Price\n\nI hope I've proven how much value Bitcoin uniquely provides as an asset. If more and more people wish to save some of their wealth using Bitcoin due to its superior attributes as a store of value, this will drive up its price.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that Bitcoin is a better store of value than gold, and over time, its market cap comes to equal that of gold, which is currently around $13 trillion. This would make each Bitcoin worth $620,000 (13 trillion divided by 21 million, which is Bitcoin\u2019s fixed cap). Consider that the total sum of all of the stores of value in the world is approximately $550 trillion at a minimum ($325 trillion in global real estate; $115 trillion in global bonds; $100 trillion in global stock; $10 trillion in gold; $10 trillion in antiques, cars, collectibles, art, etc.). Let\u2019s assume 75% of these are necessities, and only 25% is true excess storage of wealth.\n\nAs we discussed, Bitcoin is a superior store of value to all of these. Bonds provide minimal returns above inflation. Real estate has property taxes and maintenance costs. Gold is difficult to store and to move around in large amounts, and it's hard to quickly verify its authenticity. Over time, value flows from weak stores of value to the strongest. If this 25% eventually (over the next several decades) makes its way into Bitcoin, it would place each Bitcoin at $5.5 million. So, are you still scared to buy Bitcoin at $20,000-$70,000? Also, consider that the price of any asset is determined at the margins. A bottle of water may cost $1-$3 dollars in normal times. But if it\u2019s the only bottle of water in a desert with 100 millionaires on it, its price suddenly becomes the net worth of the richest millionaire who wants it. Similarly, if there is a shock to the legacy fiat systems, the price of Bitcoin may rapidly inflate as the ultra-wealthy scramble for the exits.\n\n#6 But Bitcoin Doesn\u2019t Have Any Smart Contracts\n\nThis is true for now. But consider this. Smart contracts are useful when you want the blockchain to automatically execute a function under a set condition. However, you could also just use a regular company to do this. For instance, if I want to have a smart contract that will pay me 5% interest if I loan out my \u201csh*tcoin\u201d to someone else, there is something known as a bank that can facilitate this process. Now, the blockchain does remove the middleman and automates the process, which provides some value. However, if you\u2019re talking about billions and billions of dollars at stake between large players, the security and immutability of the base settlement layer becomes of utmost importance. The only chain that is not reversible and under the control of any foundation is Bitcoin. It\u2019s the only cryptocurrency that\u2019s not a de facto company. A company that can be controlled is no better than a bank or any other company. Therefore, any smart contract network that will gain wide adoption by the \u201cbig players\u201d will have to be built on top of the Bitcoin network if they are to be trusted for transactions of consequence.\n\n#7 If It\u2019s Such a Great Store of Value, Why Has Bitcoin Not Been an Inflation Hedge?\n\nBitcoin has had booms and busts due to excessive leverage, speculation, and greed. But all of that aside, it\u2019s been the best-performing asset on the planet since its inception, and it keeps hitting higher lows. If you can stomach its early volatile phase, it stands to provide great future returns. If you wait to buy it once it\u2019s become more of a globally established store of value, the volatility will be diminished. But so will future returns.\n\nThere is a saying among Bitcoin maximalists: Don\u2019t wait to buy Bitcoin; buy Bitcoin and wait.\n\n#8 Isn\u2019t Bitcoin Supposed to Be Terrible for The Environment?\n\nThis is a common argument by the mainstream media. According to the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC)\u2014a global forum of mining companies that represents 48.4% of the worldwide Bitcoin mining network\u2014renewable energy sources accounted for 58.9% of the electricity used to mine Bitcoin in Q4 2022. That's a significant improvement compared to the 36.8% estimated in Q1 2021. What\u2019s more, Bitcoin actually incentivizes the use of renewable energy. If you develop a coal plant, you can burn more coal when needed to adjust to the demand on the energy grid. However, if you build solar panels or windmills, you have no use for that energy when the grid does not demand it, and you miss out on potential profits. If you can mine Bitcoin with the excess energy, you\u2019ve effectively found a way to generate income even when there is no demand for your source of renewable energy, thereby helping to subsidize the cost of the investment.\n\nThis can be a boon to the development of more renewable sources of energy and can help provide further stability to the power grid. There are even companies that harness flared methane from natural gas operations and help decrease how much harmful methane gets into the atmosphere. The topic of Bitcoin and energy is much more complicated than it would appear at first glance. Furthermore, consider that clothes dryers use more energy on a yearly basis than Bitcoin mining. Where is the outcry about this and why is there not a push to ban them? We can all hang out our clothes to dry, but this use of electricity to secure the best store of value ever created and a means to escape government oppression cannot be achieved without the use of sufficient energy to secure the Bitcoin network and make it resistant to attacks.\n\n[Founder's Note: I hate to add a lengthy note to an already lengthy post, but on a controversial topic such as crypto (and yes, Bitcoin is crypto even if the maximalists don't like the rest of the world saying so), it must be done. You need not assume that because you just read a lengthy, relatively positive article about Bitcoin on this website that I have somehow changed how I feel about it. I have not. I still think it is an optional asset class at best and not one that I have any plans to invest in. In fact, as time goes on and crypto still hasn't changed the world in a way meaningful to me, I lose more and more faith that it ever will. Unlike the author who admits he jumped in despite not understanding the investment mostly because the price was going up, I've known about Bitcoin from nearly the beginning, and I certainly understand the basics of how it works. Every couple of years, I look at it again to see if something has changed enough to make me want to own it. So far, no, and the arguments in this post are neither new nor convincing to me. I'm still content to stand on the sidelines and see what happens. I don't need to invest in everything I find interesting.\n\nThe author stated he would convince us that Bitcoin is essential to protecting our property rights. He wrote that it would prevent our oppression by the government and that it should be in all of our portfolios. I would argue he has failed to do so. He contends that Bitcoin is the best store of value ever invented, yet as much as 25% of it has completely disappeared as its owners have lost their keys. Not to mention the fact that its wild volatility makes stocks and precious metals look tame in comparison. The author feels that Bitcoin cannot be confiscated. Yet the very presence of the blockchain makes it relatively easy to track down criminals who have transacted with it, and the IRS now requires crypto traders to report that activity on their tax returns. When you're threatened with jail or have a gun held to your head, you'll find those Bitcoin keys pretty quickly.\n\nAt the end of his post, the author addresses my primary criticisms of Bitcoin. Although the Lightning Network and similar improvements have made strides in addressing a couple of them, the rest still stand. It is ridiculously volatile. I still can't spend it anywhere I'm interested in spending money (and would generate capital gains every time in order to do so). It has no underlying value, uses massive amounts of electricity, doesn't offer smart contracts, and doesn't seem to be particularly good during inflationary times. If it never gets better than this, I just don't see it changing the world. But my faith in humanity and technology is such that I still hold out hope that these problems can be addressed by a modified Bitcoin or, more likely in my opinion, an entirely new cryptocurrency as Bitcoin goes the way of AOL.\n\nI truly am fascinated to see how the world might change as a result of Bitcoin and similar technology. But after 15 years, I'm no longer holding my breath. Bitcoin is a speculative instrument, and I don't put those in my portfolio. If you choose to, limit it to a single-digit percentage.]\n\nWhat do you think? Do you have Bitcoin in your portfolio? If not, would you consider adding it? What other arguments for and against Bitcoin can you make? Comment below!\n\n[Editor's Note: The author is a neurologist practicing in the Mid-Atlantic who is five years out of training.

        "content": "On July 24, Bitcoin experienced a flash crash, plummeting to $29,000 in a movement now attributed to significant Bitcoin holders potentially liquidating their positions.\n\nAmid the crash and market uncertainty, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) three major trading metrics continue to project a bullish outlook, signifying that professional traders have not reduced their leverage longs through the use of margin and derivatives.\n\nAnalytics firm Glassnode reported a surge in whales\u2019 inflows to exchanges, reaching their highest level in over three years at 41% of the total BTC inflows. This forceful sell-off from whales alarmed investors, especially in the absence of any significant negative events impacting Bitcoin in the past month.\n\nNotably, a major concern stems from the ongoing court cases by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission against leading exchanges Binance and Coinbase. Still, there hasn\u2019t been any major advancement in those cases, which will likely take years to settle.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price crash might have been related to the U.S. dollar reversion\n\nDespite historical volatility, Bitcoin\u2019s crash became more pronounced following 33 consecutive days of trading within a tight 5.7% daily range. The movement is even more noteworthy given the S&P 500 gaining 0.4%, crude oil rising by 2.4% and the MSCI China stock market index surging by 2.2%.\n\nHowever, it is essential to consider that the world\u2019s largest global reserve asset, gold, experienced a dip of 0.5% on July 24. Furthermore, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) reversed its two-month-long trend of devaluation against competing fiat currencies, climbing from 99.7 to 101.4 between July 18 and July 24.\n\nU.S. Dollar Index (DXY). Source: TradingView\n\nThe DXY measures the strength of the U.S. dollar against a basket of foreign currencies, including the British pound, the euro, the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc and others. If investors believe that the Federal Reserve will manage a soft landing successfully, it makes sense to reduce exposure to gold and Bitcoin while increasing positions in the stock market. Lower odds of a recession can positively impact corporate earnings.\n\nMargin and derivatives markets show resolute professional traders\n\nTo understand whether Bitcoin\u2019s price movement down to $29,000 has successfully ruptured the market structure, one should analyze margin and derivatives markets. Margin trading allows investors to leverage their positions by borrowing stablecoins and using the proceeds to buy more cryptocurrency.\n\nOKX stablecoin/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nThe margin lending of OKX traders based on the stablecoin/BTC ratio rose between July 22 and July 24, suggesting that professional traders added leveraged long positions despite the recent price crash.\n\nTraders should corroborate this data with derivatives to ensure its marketwide impact. In healthy markets, BTC futures contracts typically trade at a 5 to 10% annualized premium, known as contango, which is not exclusive to crypto.\n\nBitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nNotice how the indicator sustained a healthy 5.7% average annualized premium, slightly lower than two days prior but still within the neutral range. This data confirms the resilience of margin markets, but to gauge market sentiment further, it\u2019s also helpful to look at the options markets.\n\nThe 25% delta skew can reveal when arbitrage desks and market makers charge higher prices for protection against upside or downside movements. In short, a skew metric rising above 7% suggests traders anticipate a drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price, while periods of excitement generally yield a -7% skew.\n\nBitcoin 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe 25% delta skew remained negative, indicating that bullish call options were trading at a premium compared to protective puts. This further supports the thesis that professional traders remain unfazed by the flash crash, with no evidence indicating pessimism among whales and market makers.\n\nThe path to $30,000 and above shows the least resistance\n\nIrrespective of the rationale behind the price move on July 24, Bitcoin bears could not dampen investor optimism, resulting in higher odds of a recovery above $30,000 in the short term. Notably, the mere appreciation of the U.S. dollar does not impact Bitcoin\u2019s predictable monetary policy, censorship resistance and autonomous nature as a means of payment.\n\nOn the brighter side, there are some positive triggers on the horizon, including the possible approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund and gaining regulatory clarity. Proof of this comes from a U.S. bill introduced on July 20 that seeks to establish a clear process for determining the classification of digital assets as commodities or securities. If the bill becomes law, it would give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission authority over digital commodities.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Sometimes an idea, stated simply and dramatically, takes hold of the collective imagination and persists. That is why Bitcoin has been associated with consuming more energy than a \u201csmall country,\u201d according to the Harvard Business Review, or even \u201cmany countries\u201d, according to the New York Times. But five years have passed since this alarming analogy grabbed headlines, and the potency of individual Bitcoin mining machines \u2013 aka application-specific integrated circuit miners, or ASICs \u2013 has only improved dramatically, leading to greater network efficiency. And for Bitcoin miners, this may also lead to greater profitability."

        "content": "Crypto markets aren't reacting the same way they once did to macroeconomic events. Consider the two most recent U.S. central bank interest rate hikes in May and March. They resulted in relatively mild price moves of 1.13% and -2.87%. The reaction to recent inflation and GDP data was similarly tame, with BTC moving just -0.74% and 1.16% respectively. All told, crypto markets have likely priced in Wednesday\u2019s anticipated move. More interesting for traders is BTC\u2019s price declining below the lower range of its Bollinger Bands, indicating that its price could move higher \u2013 albeit just slightly. Bollinger Bands are a technical indicator that tracks an asset\u2019s 20-day moving average, and plots price levels two standard deviations above and below the average. As an asset\u2019s price is expected to stay within two standard deviations of its average, 95% of the time, a breach of the external bands is statistically significant. Traders may be eyeing an upside target of $30,000 level, above the current support of $29,000."

        "content": "In this article, we will share Nouriel Roubini's Bitcoin views and other predictions. If you want to see more of his predictions, check out 5 Nouriel Roubini Predictions.\n\nHe sounded like a madman when he stood at a packed International Monetary Fund conference in 2006 and predicted a global economic recession. But he was a prophet when he returned to the same conference in 2007. Welcome to the world of Nouriel Roubini, a renowned economist born in Istanbul to a Jewish family that has been the center of many economic events that have shaped the world over the past 20 years.\n\nRoubini studied economics in Italy against his parents' expectations, as they expected him to continue the family legacy in the rug dealing business. As the black sheep of the family, he would go against the grain, going on to obtain a Ph.D. in international economics at Harvard University. A stint at Yale University as an economist lecturer would pave the way for him to take up a teaching position at New York University, bringing him to the global capital of all financial matters.\n\nIn a field with dozens of people giving analysis and predictions, Roubini has always stood out owing to his unusual approach to analyzing and predicting the economy. His model is not like any other, as it relies on intuition to predict what is likely to happen. Amid the successes in predicting how the global economy is expected to fare, he has also attracted criticism owing to his relentless prediction of disasters.\n\nHe is often referred to as Wall Street's Doom economist owing to his track record in predicting some of the biggest catastrophes that have engulfed the global economy. He first shone to light in 2006 as he accurately predicted the collapse of the U.S. market that would eventually trigger one of the biggest and most consequential financial crises.\n\nIn 2019, at the height of Donald Trump's presidency, he predicted that an escalating US-China trade war would escalate into a cold war and a currency war. Nothing could be further from the truth as the two countries are entangled in a vicious supremacy war around emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, critical minerals, and semiconductors. Likewise, China is spearheading the creation of a new currency to counter the dollar's edge as a global reserve currency.\n\nStory continues\n\nRoubini is also on record predicting that the COVID-19 pandemic would trigger greater depression than the 1930s depression. The pandemic ended up triggering significant supply chain pressures leading to a four-decade high inflation rate in several countries. While the U.S. economy has recovered, the prospect of another recession on the horizon is high.\n\nNouriel Roubini on Bitcoin and Other Predictions\n\nSource: pixabay\n\nAt the height of the pandemic, the U.S. Federal Reserve embarked on an interest rate cut frenzy to stimulate the economy. Cutting interest rates to near zero triggered heightened inflation as growth stagnated. As inflation levels rose to 30-year highs, Roubini warned that the FED would struggle to do what it needs to try to lower inflation levels without triggering a recession. That was the case as inflation rose to about 9.2% representing 40-year highs.\n\nWhile the FED did embark on an aggressive monetary policy tightening to try and bring inflation below the recommended 2% levels, Roubini has warned that the economy could be heeded to a deep recession. After an aggressive interest rate hike to above the 5% level, the supply of money was reduced significantly, with businesses needing help to access cheap capital needed to accelerate economic activity. Roubini believes the economy is headed toward a deep recession with those thinking of a mild recession are delusional.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nRoubini's accurate foresight of major economic events has cemented his position as one of the world's most prominent and reliable economists. In this article, we will explore Roubini's predictions over the years and what he believes the future will be all about amid the cryptocurrency revolution. This list reviewed Roubini\u2019s major predictions and their impact on the global economy. We ranked them chronologically from when the predictions were made. Let's delve into some of his most notable predictions and their impact on the global financial landscape.\n\n10. The Financial Crisis: 2007-2009\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis is arguably one of the biggest economic events that propelled Roubini to prominence. Two years before the global economy plunged into recession, the economist had warned of a potential housing bubble, excessive leverage, and risky financial practices. While at first, he seemed like a prophet of doom, his predictions materialized, affirming his status as one of the ears worth listening to on economic matters.\n\nAs early as 2005, the economist had warned that the housing market was in a bubble due to the low-interest rate environment and lax lending standards fueled by speculative demand. It's his prediction that the housing burst would spill into the financial sector that affirmed his predictions as 2009 saw the implosion of many financial institutions, including the Lehman brothers\n\nHis prediction that the financial crisis would severely impact the real economy came true as consumers and businesses were forced to cut spending as the U.S. economy plunged into recession in 2009.\n\n9. European Debt Crisis: 2010-2013\n\nRoubini was one of the first economists to call out the European debt crisis spearheaded by Greece, which eventually had a ripple effect on the entire economic block. As early as 2010, the economist warned that the Eurozone was storing many problems by failing to tackle the debt crisis head-on. He also warned that Greece was insolvent and not in any position to repay its debt without massive restructuring or bailout.\n\nThe New York-based economists had also warned that the debt crisis would spill to other European nations, mostly affecting Portugal, Italy, Ireland, and Spain; he termed the countries as some that faced massive problems with debt, low growth, and weak competitiveness.\n\nThe warnings came true as Greece defaulted on its debt obligations prompting a massive bailout. Greece, Portugal, and Ireland were also bailed out as they faced unsustainable debt levels. The E.U. was forced to thrash out a series of packages to ensure that Greece was funded through 2014.\n\n8. Chinese Economy Bubble Burst: 2011-2013\n\nRoubini once again shot into the limelight in 2011 as he warned that the Chinese economy faced a probability of a hard landing. The warning came amid concerns that the economy was highly dependent on U.S. consumers. At the time, the global economy was running on two engines, the U.S., on one part, as the consumer, and China, on the other hand, as the chief producer.\n\nWith the U.S. facing a collapse of consumption and consumer confidence amid plunging housing, auto sales, and durable goods spending, Roubini warned that China's economy was in big trouble. China being structurally dependent on exports at the time was a big problem, according to Roubini, who feared its hard landing amid waning consumption in the U.S. would end up impacting the global markets.\n\nThe economists had warned that the economy would face a hard landing in 2013. However, that did not materialize. While the Chinese economy has faced a number of issues over the years, it has managed to maintain high growth rates and stay afloat.\n\n7. Emerging Market Currency Crisis: 2013-2014\n\nAs the U.S. economy returned from the 2009 financial crisis, the federal reserve embarked on tightening monetary policy that included hiking interest rates. In 2013, Roubini warned that increased quantitative tightening and tapering by the FED would trigger significant issues for emerging market economies.\n\nThe prediction did come true as the tapering caused emerging markets to face capital outflows and currency depreciation as the U.S. dollar strengthened against the major currencies starting in 2014. The strengthening of the dollar put downward pressure on the exchange rates of emerging markets, especially those with large current account deficits and low foreign exchange reserves.\n\nAmid massive capital outflows, emerging market economies ended up struggling with lower growth and higher inflation. The countries faced higher import costs amid reduced purchasing power on weakened currencies and a stronger dollar.\n\n6. Oil Price Collapse 2014-2015\n\nAmid increased U.S. shale oil production and OPEC members failing to initiate any production cuts, Roubini warned of an imminent collapse in oil prices in 2014. Due to technological advancements, innovation, and efficiency gains, the U.S. shale oil companies ramped up production, consequently putting pressure on prices.\n\nOPEC, on the other hand, failed to stabilize the oil market through production cuts. Roubini warned of the long-term impact of Saudi Arabia's failure to cut its production quota in 2014 despite the falling process.\n\nThe result was the oil market experiencing its biggest price decline in modern history as oil prices fell more than 50% due to a glut in supply. Oil prices fell from above $70 a barrel to lows of $30 a barrel level. According to Roubini, the price decline was fueled by a slowdown in demand from major oil-importing countries, including China and India.\n\nRoubini's prediction did come true as the collapse of oil prices had a negative impact on the global economy as growth fell amid higher inflation and financial instability. The collapse also triggered a debt crisis in major oil-exporting countries, including Russia, Venezuela, and Nigeria.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Nouriel Roubini Predictions.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "The Race to Bitcoin ETF: Here Are All the Dates to Watch Including BlackRock's - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nMany financial firms are preparing to provide Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nDespite being the last to file, one of the biggest names on the list, BlackRock, is planning to receive responses on par with others\n\nA BlackRock Bitcoin ETF might be the biggest ETF launch ever if the SEC authorizes it\n\nAnalysts think Bitcoin might rise to $180,000 before the anticipated halving in April 2024\n\nBlackrock, a well-known worldwide investment and management company, officially applied to the SEC in June of this year for permission to launch its own Bitcoin ETF, which the iShares Bitcoin Trust will administer. As it has done for years, the SEC rejected this first submission. BlackRock charged once more a month after renewing the application and taking SEC observations into account.\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t only Blackrock that was interested (again) in setting up such a fund. Many other financial institutions, previously denied by the SEC multiple times, reiterated their applications.\n\nKey dates in the fight for approval include deadlines for the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock\u2019s iShares coin Trust, Bitwise\u2019s Bitcoin ETF, Van Eck Bitcoin Trust, Wisdomtree BitcoinTrust, and many others, according to a tweet from renowned ETF analyst James Seyffart.\n\nThe second deadline for ARK 21Shares is set on August 13. This early deadline could provide ARK 21Shares with a competitive advantage.\n\nOn September 1, Bitwise has its first deadline.\n\nThe initial deadline of September 2 is shared by a sizable group of issuers, including the iShares Coin Trust by BlackRock and several others.\n\nThese issuers might face a collective judgment day due to being grouped together, which might affect the SEC\u2019s decision-making process.\n\nThe Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund\u2018s first deadline is set for September 4. To potentially learn from the results of the earlier deadlines puts Valkyrie significantly behind the remainder of the field.\n\nBlackRock At the Forefront Of the ETF Competition\n\nSince it would offer a more accessible and regulated way to invest in cryptocurrencies without dealing with the complexities of crypto wallets and exchanges, investors have been clamoring for an ETF linked to Bitcoin. BlackRock, one of the biggest names on the list, filed last but is expected to receive a response on par with those of other applicants who did so far earlier.\n\nSeyffart explained that although BlackRock\u2019s prospectus filing dates might be later, all others had already been rejected by the SEC in the 19b-4 process once or even more than once, so their timing may not be as late as it seems.\n\nWith this wave, BlackRock may be at the forefront of the ETF competition. A lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is one of the ways Grayscale\u2019s GBTC, a well-known Bitcoin investment product, is striving for ETF designation.\n\nThe judges\u2019 judgment is anticipated within the next two months. If GBTC prevails in its legal battle with the SEC, some cryptocurrency aficionados think that it might become the first Bitcoin ETF.\n\nSeyffart has cautioned that Grayscale might not be allowed to convert to an ETF even if it wins its legal battle.\n\nAfter Years of SEC Rejections, BlackRock\u2019s ETF May Change the BTC Landscape\n\nA financial tool, also known as an exchange-traded fund, tracks the performance of a specific index, industry, commodity, or asset. Trading them on conventional stock exchanges enables investors to obtain exposure to these assets.\n\nThese goods are widely available, particularly in the United States. The Security Exchange Commission and other regulators have been preventing a Bitcoin ETF for years, despite the existence of a thriving ETF industry. The coming months could see a change in this situation.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF was strongly desired in the cryptocurrency industry in 2018, but it was also one of the businesses pursuing its approval that failed the most.\n\nAfter prices reached their highest point ever in 2017 and entered a downturn phase in 2018, the narrative surrounding institutional participation gained popularity and an ETF\u2019s requirement. Even after major corporations like Tesla or MicroStrategy entered the market, it never happened.\n\nCan ETF Creation Be Denied Again?\n\nIn the opinion of Gabor Gurbacs, Advisor at VanEck and Tether, there are no good enough reasons for the SEC to reject the creation of a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nGurbacs has first-hand knowledge of this because global investment firm VanEck has an active spot Bitcoin ETF application.\n\n\u201cThe SEC cited concerns about potential market manipulation, custody issues, and the overall maturity of the underlying market,\u201d he said.\n\nThe direct ownership of an underlying asset, such as Bitcoin, is represented by a spot Bitcoin ETF. When you purchase a share of a spot ETF, the fund buys an equivalent asset quantity, giving you almost a one-to-one exposure (fees excluded), explained Gurbacs.\n\nThe acceptance of a local spot ETF in the US could affect the price of Bitcoin and how traditional investors view the asset, while also delivering a highly regulated investment product that allays any SEC worries.\n\nGurbacs also asserted that by giving people and institutions a well-known and generally regulated way to get exposure to Bitcoin, the ETF might increase the number of investors in the currency. It probably would increase liquidity and enhance price discovery. Second, it might promote institutional adoption, which might help stabilize the market and reduce price volatility.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s impossible to predict when a spot Bitcoin ETF would bear, the situation is a little different than it was in 2018. For instance, El Salvador legalized Bitcoin in 2021, and a number of businesses are already stockpiling it or using it for treasury or investment management.\n\nThis new trend includes BlackRock\u2019s interest, and the acceptance of its application might completely alter the way people play the Bitcoin game.\n\nFundstrat: The price of Bitcoin Could Jump to $180,000\n\nBefore the cryptocurrency\u2019s anticipated halving in April 2024, the price of Bitcoin may increase by 521% from present levels to $180,000, according to a Fundstrat report .\n\nAlthough the daily demand for Bitcoin is approximately $25 million, the daily mining incentives are also approximately $25 million, according to the financial research firm, this could alter with the prospective introduction of a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nAccording to the report, a Bitcoin ETF could increase daily demand for Bitcoin by an additional $100 million. The price of Bitcoin would need to climb significantly to reach an equilibrium between buyers and sellers given this increase and the April 2024 halving, which is scheduled to reduce daily mining earnings to $12 million."

At the same time, strong inflows from institutional investors are also driving the demand for Bitcoin,\u201d Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co, the parent company of 21Shares, an issuer of crypto exchange-traded products, wrote to Forkast.\n\n\u201cAccording to K33 Research, BTC-equivalent exposure of exchange-traded products listed worldwide increased by 25,202 BTC (US$757 million) to 196,824 BTC in four weeks to July 16, which is the second highest in monthly net inflow.\u201d\n\nOctober 2021 was the highest month for net inflows into Bitcoin ETPs, following the launch of ProShares\u2019 Bitcoin Strategy ETF.\n\nFor a second consecutive day, Dogecoin was the only token up in the top 10 to gain, rising 2.5% in the past 24 hours to US$0.0768.\n\nSolana\u2019s Sol token was the day\u2019s biggest loser, falling 5.97% in the past 24 hours to US$23.10, followed by the XRP token that lost 5.32% to US$0.6833.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours fell 0.38% to US$1.19 trillion while market volume increased 9.27% to US$25.15 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nForkast 500 NFT index falls to all-time low, Bitcoin, Ethereum NFT sales fall\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index slipped 0.68% to 2,656.79 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong and fell 2.59% during the week. The index declined to an all-time low of 2,652.17 points earlier today.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 24-hour non-fungible token sales fell 5.82% to US$666,101 with the network shrinking to be the sixth largest blockchain by 24-hour NFT sales volume, according to CryptoSlam.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales fell 11.21% to US$11.69 million, while sales for the largest Ethereum-native NFT collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, rose 17.68% to US$1.17 million even as Azuki sales declined 49.31% to US$547,373.\n\nOn Ethereum, CryptoPunks began to recover from last week\u2019s decline, rising 4.58% to US$633,772.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still an exceptionally slow time for NFTs, both with volume and sales. Global sales mirror what Ethereum\u2019s NFT sales were alone just a few months ago, during a time when NFTs were also considered slow. We just had no idea how much slower things could get,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs.\n\nAmong the Forkast Labs indexes, the Forkast CAR NFT Composite was the only one in the green for the day.\n\nAsian equities rise on Chinese Politburo pledge, U.S. stock futures strengthen ahead of Fed\u2019s interest rate meeting\n\nImage: elements.envato\n\nMost major Asian equities strengthened as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, except Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225. Yet, the Shenzhen Component, the Shanghai Composite and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index all posted gains, after China\u2019s Politburo pledged to boost the mainland\u2019s economic recovery, with a focus on boosting domestic demand and assisting the property market.\n\nMost U.S. stock futures strengthened during Tuesday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, except the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures. However, the S&P 500 futures index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures both strengthened.\n\nInvestors remained cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting on monetary policy later on Wednesday. The Fed is expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday to between 5.25% to 5.50%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. This will be the highest in 22 years, though the increase has been well signaled and priced in.\n\nThe European Central Bank is also expected to raise its rates on Thursday.

        "content": "Bitcoin fell on Tuesday morning in Asia along with most other leading cryptocurrencies as investors took a risk-averse approach on speculation the U.S. regulator will appeal a decision in the Ripple court case and the view the recent price gain on hopes for approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund got ahead of itself. The Federal Reserve also announces its interest rate decision on Wednesday and while a hike is priced in, for some investors it\u2019s another reason for caution. Gloom around China\u2019s economy didn\u2019t help. However, Dogecoin investors ignored these issues and the meme token gained after Twitter owner Elon Musk integrated its symbol into his Twitter bio on Monday as he rebrands the social media platform into \u201cX\u201d. Elsewhere, the Forkast 500 NFT index continued its slide and U.S. equity futures traded flat.\n\nLosing steam\n\nBitcoin fell 2.92% over the last 24 hours to US$29,182 as of 07:35 a.m. in Hong Kong for a weekly loss of 3.14%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency briefly traded below the US$29,000 mark on Monday evening for the first time in more than a month, or since June 21.\n\nEther dropped 1.98% to US$1,849 and moved down 3.25% for the week.\n\nWith the exception of Dogecoin, all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies logged losses, with Solana\u2019s SOL leading the decliners with a 5.31% drop to US$23.46. It has slumped 12.78% over the past seven days.\n\nThe price drops come as the bullish sentiment in the crypto market was offset by worries that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might file an appeal against the court ruling in the Ripple case, said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of APAC business development at Belgium-based crypto market-maker Keyrock.\n\n\u201cRumours about CZ and the Binance [exchange] team potentially inflating some of their volumes,\u201d added to the caution, said d\u2019Anethan. \u201cWith investors always looking forward, the potential risks need to be accounted for and priced in.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal on Monday reported Changpeng Zhao, chief executive officer of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange Binance, hinted in an internal message that Binance affiliates conducted \u201cwash trading\u201d years ago, a practice where investors trade assets with themselves or an associate to inflate trading volumes and influence prices.\n\nBinance in an email response to Forkast News questions on Tuesday morning said: \u201cBinance does not engage in or tolerate wash trading, which is a violation of our terms of use, nor has it ever done so.\u201d\n\nThe comments, which were attributed to a Binance spokesperson who wasn\u2019t identified, added: \u201cBinance has a dedicated Market Surveillance team that is responsible for reviewing surveillance related to potential abusive and/or manipulative behavior including wash trades and trade price manipulation. The Market Surveillance team utilizes surveillance models and a team of experienced surveillance professionals to detect and prevent market abuse.\u201d\n\nDogecoin, meantime, gained 3.54% to US$0.07447 and moved up 6.66% for the week.\n\nTwitter owner Elon Musk changed the blue bird logo of Twitter to X on Monday and switched his Twitter location to \u201c\ud835\udd4f\u00d0\u201d, with \u201c\u00d0\u201d also used as a symbol for Dogecoin, raising speculation the meme token will be integrated into the rebranded social media platform.\n\nAmid the current selling pressure on most tokens, Matteo Greco, research analyst at Canada-based digital asset investment firm Fineqia International, sees signs for longer-term optimism.\n\n\u201cDespite a cautious attitude of investors in the short term, especially due to the rate hike expectations at the forthcoming FOMC meeting, the analysed metrics concerning BTC and ETH suggest a period of accumulation, with investors that are buying digital assets and holding for a long period looking for a price increase in the long run,\u201d said Greco in email comments.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization fell 2.48% in the past 24 hours to US$1.17 trillion, while trading volume rose 40.26% to US$35.5 billion.\n\nForkast 500 drops, Bitcoin Ordinals hype fades\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.15% in the past 24 hours to 2,667.46 as of 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum, Solana and Polygon NFT market indexes also moved lower, while the Cardano index gained.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume fell 4.49% in the past 24 hours to US$17.16 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volumes on the Ethereum, Polygon and Bitcoin networks also fell, while Solana, BNB Chain and Cardano logged increases.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still an exceptionally slow time for NFTs, both with volume and sales,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs. \u201cGlobal sales mirror what Ethereum\u2019s NFT sales were alone just a few months ago, during a time when NFTs were also considered slow. We just had no idea how much slower things could get.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Ordinals, an NFT iteration on the Bitcoin blockchain, has seen an even bigger slowdown. Uncategorized Ordinals, whose trading volume totaled over US$100 million in March 2023, has seen only US$18.61 million so far in July.\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s ordinals ecosystem has suffered more than I was expecting, and that may be because trading BTC itself has taken priority,\u201d said Petscher. \u201cThe blockchain that was once being discussed as having potential to flip Ethereum\u2019s volume has now fallen to the 5th ranked blockchain by sales volume. This is where we see the chain\u2019s limitations and lack of smart contracts as hindering innovation, when innovation is really the only way to deliver value in this market.\u201d\n\nAmong all NFT collections, Ethereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club topped the 24-hour trading volume, rising 60.61% to US$1.44 million.\n\nElsewhere, over 8,000 Stan Lee-themed NFTs have been \u201cnear instantaneously\u201d sold after their launch on July 18, according to a Tuesday announcement by the U.S. entertainment firm Kartoon Studios Inc. The studio issued the NFTs based on Lee \u2013 the famed comic book writer and co-creator of Spiderman and other Marvel Comic superheroes \u2013 in a partnership with VeVe Digital Collectibles.\n\nWith each NFT priced at US$15, sales of the Stan Lee NFT collection totaled about US$120,000, and showed there is still demand for certain assets despite the overall slow NFT market, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. The floor price of the collection currently sits at US$53, more than three times higher than the listing price, according to the trading platform of VeVe Digital Collectibles.\n\nDow on a streak, China not so\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded flat to lower as of 11:10 a.m. in Hong Kong, after all three major U.S. indexes closed higher in regular Monday trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average logging its longest winning streak in six years.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes were mostly higher on Tuesday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng and South Korea\u2019s Kospi rose, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei moved lower.\n\nStock markets in Hong Kong and mainland China found some optimism in a Politburo meeting on Monday, which signaled more support for the country\u2019s troubled property market and to boost consumption. However, the meeting did not unveil any specific large-scale stimulus to counter the country\u2019s slow post-Covid economic recovery.\n\n\u201cAt present, the main challenge facing the investment markets in mainland China is lagging consumer confidence, primarily influenced by the slower recovery of the domestic real estate market,\u201d Jason Yu, head of multi asset management at asset manager Schroders, said in an emailed comment on Monday.\n\n\u201cGiven that real estate investment constitutes a significant portion of the overall wealth of mainland China households, their caution towards spending and investing more is understandable when the future of the housing market looks uncertain,\u201d said Yu.\n\nIn the U.S. the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday to between 5.25% to 5.50%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. This will be the highest in 22 years, though the increase has been well signaled and priced in.\n\nEarnings are also in focus this week, with Microsoft, Alphabet and General Electric set to release second quarter results on Tuesday.\n\nOn the economic data front, the U.S. Composite Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to 52.0 in July, the lowest level in five months, according to a Monday report by S&P Global. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in business activities, while a reading below 50 a contraction.\n\nThe slowing in U.S. business activities in July could be seen as a positive by the Federal Reserve in its drive to curb inflation, Reuters reported on Tuesday.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "title": "One investor bets bitcoin's bull market has begun - Axios",
        "content": "Tone Vays is a bitcoin investor and entrepreneur who believes the next bull market for the original cryptocurrency has already begun. Why it matters: When bitcoin goes up, the whole market goes up \u2014 and a speculative frenzy in more volatile assets will likely get going along the way. Vays is not at all into any of that, but it's inevitable.\n\nContext: Besides trading and investing, Vays runs events for investors: Unconfiscatable and The Financial Summit.\n\nHis take focuses exclusively on bitcoin. While he's the first to admit other assets have fueled some of BTC's stratospheric highs, he's unconvinced that they have fundamentally added value.\n\nZoom in: What they have mostly added, he believes, is volatility and noise.\n\nIn other words, without assets like ether (ETH) and dogecoin (DOGE), bitcoin would never have seen $60,000, but it might not have had any 80% drops, either.\n\nFlashback: In early 2018, I actually saw Vays tape an interview on Cheddar where he called a bottom for bitcoin at around $3,000. The bottom of that market was about $3,200 that December.\n\nVays said he turned bearish in January 2018 when bitcoin failed to recover adequately following its December all-time high. That's when he knew the bull was over.\n\nHe said that a correction ends when the last holders who aren't fully committed sell off. This either happens through a hard fast fall or from a long dull period of anemic growth.\n\nWhat they're saying: \"The current correction that we're dealing with is more of a correction through time. People are getting very frustrated even though it's at $30,000,\" Vays said.\n\nFrustrated former investors don't return to a market until it's almost too late. He expects them all to return when and if bitcoin hits $50,000 again.\n\nBe smart: Vays looks at markets in two ways: fundamentally and technically. He only trades assets he believes in fundamentally. That is, they have real value in the world.\n\nFundamentally, he only trades bitcoin because it's the only asset he believes in.\n\nBut he makes day-to-day trading decisions using technical analysis (by watching what charts show about likely trends by traders). That analysis removes the emotions in trading.\n\n\"I don't believe in a diversified portfolio in the crypto space,\" he said.\n\nHe learned his lesson as a stock trader earlier in his career. Sometimes he'd try to trade penny stocks. \"I always got my face ripped off because they are easily manipulated,\" he said.\n\nToday, he sees other coins and tokens just as he saw penny stocks then.\n\nWhy he's bullish: His favorite metric is bitcoin wallets with 1 BTC or more. That number just broke one million.\n\n\"As that metric grows, it takes bitcoin off the market,\" Vays said, so it is held by \"people who aren't going to be scared and sell it.\"\n\nBitcoin on Lightning is also growing, which is bitcoin used for transacting rather than trading.\n\nFurther, he believes the politicization of money is a long-term bullish force. For example, he sees the demoniztion of cash and the politicization of the SWIFT network as factors that will drive more people around the world to bitcoin.\n\nAnd, also: El Salvador making bitcoin legal tender is a strong sign to Vays.\n\nHaving visited El Salvador, he saw the bitcoin economy there in one particular way: Any Uber driver in El Salvador, he said, will be happy to take a tip in bitcoin.\n\nIn the U.S., a driver might not even know what you're talking about, but it's never any trouble to tip in bitcoin there.\n\nVays expects other nations in the region will follow El Salvador's example if bitcoin's rise becomes decisive. The International Monetary Fund discourages such moves.\n\nHe's heading back to the country next year.\n\nWhat we're watching: Market conditions change all the time. If bitcoin price fell below $25,000 and stayed there for seven to 10 days, Vays said that would shake his faith in a long-term bull trajectory."

Um 2009, the Genesis block and every 210,000 blocks, we have a halving and so the miners who were mining back in 2009 were receiving 50 Bitcoin for every block they successfully mined and that reduced to 12.5 in 2012 in 2016, that became 6.25. And, and we're going now to in 2024 the rewards will be half to 3.125 Bitcoin. And that means that, you know, miners who are mining. now, when that date comes, if the Bitcoin price remains as it is at the moment, we potentially see, you know, their, their rewards halved and effectively, you know, that means that, you know, that your costs have doubled effectively overnight. And so my article looked at um the ways that these mining companies and I analyzed the big North American public miners, but this will apply to all miners, this apply to all migrants globally. What the things that they would be doing. I'd be expecting to do between now and the haring itself and I came up with three or four different points. So, uh I, you know, I have to ask this because we've known about the having since literally the day the white paper was released, we've always known this was coming. Um But people seem to think that this is going to be some sort of bullish event uh as if nobody has ever heard of it or that the retail public hasn't heard of it. I it seems like this, this is, this happens every so often we hear about, oh, well, if you just look at a chart of Bitcoin, the price of Bitcoin and it has and therefore the having is what causes the price to go up this much. But, but there are other factors, right? There's a network effect of people adopting or, or, or people trading Bitcoin at least. Um Is this really go is this correlation uh is this a spurious correlation with price? Um or is this uh an actual, you know, is it causation because it just seems so, you know, obvious II I personally believe that, you know, miners will be looking back at the previous cycles to determine what's happened. And we have seen some, you know, some consistency with the actual um with the haring itself. One thing that has been clear, the Bitcoin home price hasn't always increased overnight in line with the halving has been reduced. So, you know, one of my key points that miners should be looking at now is making sure they have enough financial runway to get them through at least four or five months after the halving. And usually by that time, the Bitcoin price has, has sort of like started to, to, to, to move. But as you, as you quite rightly allude to, there are so many other factors that can affect the Bitcoin price and we've seen that happen even in the last few years. Um with regards to, you know, um, macroeconomic factors, the war in Ukraine and, you know, so many things can affect Bitcoin. Um, but it does seem to have that resilience. Um, and even though there are many factors trying to bring it down and you've, you've talked through various of these on your, on your channel before, with, with the likes of FTX and Celsius. Um, Bitcoin just seemed to bounce back. It seems to be, you know, strong enough to take, to take those challenges on. Um But from my perspective, I'd be expecting Bitcoin miners to making sure now that they have, you know, the, the sort of the, the most efficient mining machines in preparation for that halving because you want the most efficient machines that use the least energy um knowing full well that you're going to get half the rewards. Um The second key point is really, you know, the energy cost. Um We've seen energy prices come down since 2022 and we've seen a number of miners who've been able to lock into fixed price contracts and that's going to enable them to um to, to, you know, help manage the situation. Um The cash runway is, is absolutely essential. These miners need cash to, to, to, to, to pay for their electricity, to pay for their staff's wages, to pay for their GN A costs. So that's important as well. We're seeing a number of miners starting to diversify into high performance computing um artificial intelligence um hosting other mining companies. And the, the first two we've seen the likes of and hive digital um move to that area and Irish Energy um an Australian miner with um uh currently based in the U. They're also considering using some of their capacity at the children's site um to use it for data centers. My only concern with, with, with that di diversification is it, it sounds great at the moment and we're hearing artificial intelligence mention never the sentence. I just want to make sure the revenues actually follow those, those discussions and what they're implementing there. Uh These are Bitcoin mining companies and you know, whatever they do as a sideline, there'll always be Bitcoin mining companies at the moment. Um You know, I spoke to some of the CEO S and you know, their, their expectation of revenues. Uh you know, this will not really impact significantly on what they're doing um from a Bitcoin my perspective, but it will bring some supplementary revenues and some reasonable margins potentially. So, you know, it is something for consideration because we don't know how long Bitcoin price will stay at at this level. I can't predict the Bitcoin price in April next year. You can't predict the Bitcoin price. I can't predict the Bitcoin price tomorrow. So, you know, that's I wanna touch on that, that way. I never want to hear anybody ask me. They're like, well, you know, anything about me I'm like, just leave me alone. I absolutely stop. Please making a mental note to ask Lawrence that. Now every day I'll ask you about the Canadian dollar if you keep that up. Uh, Anthony, I want to touch on that diversification piece a little bit more. It sounds like the mining industry is really solving a lot of the challenges, but it's becoming increasingly more difficult to di, to mine and hence the diversification. Do you see a lot of the miners um that are operating now, you know, diversifying completely into a different business as time goes on as mining becomes more difficult. What are you hearing from the CEO S that you're speaking to the, the, the two, the two companies that are sort of really looking to move into that space significantly. And, and the two I mentioned that were eight and I digital bear in mind, these two companies had a serious amount of GP US when they were mining Ethereum before we had the fork um last September. So all those fantastic revenues, they were mining Ethereum with their GP US stopped overnight and they've then been looking for the next thing to do with those GP US. Now, the GP US that they have, you know, I think they're high end GP U. So they've got plenty of alternative uses. I mean, a Bitcoin miner and a machine can only do one thing, it can mine Bitcoin and that's it. But the GP us have got other uses and I think they're looking to sort of like move there. Will other miners um move into that space? I, I don't think so at the moment, I think um you know, the, the the big mine companies, the Marathon digitals, the riot platforms, um we will continue to grow clean spot, add them to that, that top tier group of miners um that they'll grow their hash rates um in a sensible way. Um buying the most efficient miners on the market. And those three companies I've just mentioned, they've been buying miners this year and last year in redness for this army and they've got serious hash rate ready. So, diversification, not in, not in terms of other revenues but diversification in terms of looking to Bitcoin mine in other areas of the world and marathon digital are already up and running in the UAE. So, but, but to that point, I mean, you know, would we see, for instance, like coin, you know, you said that they can only mine Bitcoin essentially, but there are all these offshoots of Bitcoin that essentially run the same way. Uh Would we see as the price of, of mining Bitcoin goes up this idea that, well, you know what we're to set up, we anyway, we can mine BS V, we can mine uh Bitcoin cash, we can mine light coin. You know, we can kind of go to these other, these other coins that sort of use the same, use the same technology essentially. Uh, and it's costing us a lot more now to deal with, uh, to deal with, uh, mining Bitcoin. Why don't we just switch to that? I mean, like who's gonna, and also who's gonna suffer? Who do you see suffering the most, uh, with, with, with the, having the, the, the ones that suffer the most will be the ones that haven't prepared. So they haven't got, you know, they've got machines that are going to require a lot of power. Um So not the most efficient machines on the market. And, you know, you need to the machine price at the moment are actually quite low. Go back 18 months ago, people were paying seven or eight times the current price of what they're paying now for machines and a lot of these mining companies did buy at seven or eight times the price and they haven't got the cash revenues now to really start looking to change though. You know, the older machines for new machines, you know, there's not many levers available to mining companies that they can sell Bitcoin and, and most of them are selling Bitcoin every month. Now. Gone are the days where we're huddling everything. Um There's debt but debt's becoming far more trickier and 2022 was the year of debt. And we saw quite a number of miners, some went into chapter 11 and some nearly went into chapter 11. So debt really is off the table for most of the miners. And the other option is to is to dilute the company. So you know, to sell more shares and you know, 2023 will be the year of dilution for most of these companies you want to name names. Um Well, II I can tell you now that Cleans Spark Marathon, digital riot platforms are all selling shares and cleans. Spark will, will, will, you know, will tell shareholders are selling shares, they want to grow their hash rate. You know, they've grown exponentially in 2022. They were the only miner to achieve their growth target in that year. They've got a growth target, which, which was about six hash in January this year, it's going to be 16 extra hash by the end of the year. That's phenomenal growth, but that requires phenomenal investment and you can't tap into the debt markets at the moment because the interest rates with the macroeconomic climate and also the climate around what's happened in the debt cycles in the mining industry where we've seen a lot of defaults on loans. We've seen a lot of repossession of loans. We've seen a lot of um uh issues of debt fall fall on their face because they've not really looked into this too seriously and looked at the how the price of Bitcoin not only affects, you know, Bitcoin itself, but it affects the actual machinery. So when Bitcoin price comes down. The cost of these machines, the value of these machines come down as well. And that wasn't anticipated by some of these lenders. And so, you know, they've also fallen foul of what, what they tried to succeed in. Um But, you know, um II I think I cover 15 or 16 in the biggest miners and I would say categorically that 90% of those are diluting, you know, regularly. Now, they've all got these at the market offerings which enables them and they're approved by the shareholders. So the shares have to approve the at the market offering, they can sell shares effectively on a daily basis. And you don't know how many shares they've sold until the quarterly earnings report comes out. And that's generally five months after. So in the next two or three weeks, we're going to see earnings reports from all these miners we've discussed and we'll see exactly how many shares and, um, you know, just, you know, looking for it highlighted what they, um, you know, what they've done the first five months of the year, they sold 41 million shares in the first five months of 2023 to help fund their growth."

Credit: James MacDonald/Bloomberg via Getty Images.\n\nAmerican Express, BlackRock, Citigroup, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Mastercard, Vanguard and Visa have collectively invested $1.5bn in Bitcoin mining, according to new research from Greenpeace USA. These investments contradict the companies\u2019 climate commitments, alleges the NGO.\n\nBitcoin mining consumes vast amounts of energy, equivalent to the annual energy consumption of nations like Colombia and the Czech Republic. Most of this energy derives from fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas, says Greenpeace USA.\n\nEach of the nine companies flagged by the NGO have made climate commitments or set ESG targets. Some have publicly criticised Bitcoin's environmental impact, despite continuing to invest in and expand their Bitcoin portfolios, Greenpeace USA says.\n\nIts report, Investing in Bitcoin\u2019s Climate Pollution: Big Finance is Betting on Dirty Bitcoin, ranks asset manager BlackRock and bank JP Morgan Chase as the worst offenders. Despite their sustainability commitments to reduce carbon emissions, both have invested heavily in mining companies and Bitcoin investment products.\n\n\"There is no CEO of Bitcoin. But JPMorgan Chase, BlackRock, and all of the companies we investigated have the power and resources to push for a change to the code that would eliminate nearly 100% of Bitcoin\u2019s energy use,\u201d said Joshua Archer, Greenpeace USA\u2019s Bitcoin Project Lead, in a press statement.\n\n\u201cThis is a rare opportunity to eliminate a massive amount of fossil fuel use without needing to replace it with another energy source. But instead of calling for this common sense change and leading us toward a green future, financial institutions are making a risky gamble on Bitcoin at the expense of climate and communities. By investing in mining companies, creating new avenues for Bitcoin transactions, and building new services to bring Bitcoin to a broader clientele, they are operating in contradiction with their own climate pledges. We invite them and other stakeholders to the table to plot a future for Bitcoin that\u2019s compatible with a just, habitable planet for all.\"\n\nHow well do you really know your competitors?

Visa, Mastercard, BlackRock, and CitiGroup were willing to engage in conversations about Bitcoin pollution, but to date these discussions have yielded \"limited results\". Fidelity, Vanguard, JPMorgan Chase, American Express and Goldman Sachs \"ignored or refused\" Greenpeace USA's efforts to engage them on this issue, the NGO reports.\n\nHowever, the Greenpeace report has been challenged by at least one Bitcoin ESG analyst. CH4 Capital co-founder Daniel Batten has written a rebuttal arguing that \"the report recycles many already widely-debunked claims about Bitcoin, uses unsubstantiated fear about 'what might happen'[...] and repeatedly avoids important contextualising information\".\n\nBatten says many industries apart from Bitcoin use more energy than entire countries. More than half of Bitcoin mining globally in 2023 came from sustainable energy sources. There is a growing weight of evidence \"from those most qualified to make the assessment\" to suggest that Bitcoin mining helps build out the renewable grid. In addition, it can help mitigate the venting or flaring of methane."

Analysts say a possible extended legal fight between the U.S. regulator and Ripple Labs as well as comments from the Federal Reserve on the interest rate outlook expected later today is breeding caution. Ether also treaded water, while other leading tokens were a mixed picture. Dogecoin led the winners again on speculation it may be integrated into Twitter as the social media app gets revamped into a more general-purpose platform. Elsewhere, the Forkast 500 NFT index dipped and U.S. equity futures traded mixed after Wall Street closed higher on Tuesday.\n\nBitcoin lacking catalysts\n\nBitcoin inched 0.14% higher over the last 24 hours to US$29,222 as of 07:35 a.m. in Hong Kong, but lost 2.07% for the week, according to data from CoinMarketCap. After briefly falling to a monthly low of US$28,890 on Monday, the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency has seemingly found support around US$29,000.\n\n\u201cSeveral factors are currently affecting Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, including concerns about the Ripple case resumption and investors\u2019 speculation on Bitcoin investment funds,\u201d Rania Gule, an analyst at Cyprus-headquartered multi-asset broker XS Group, said in an emailed comment.\n\nThe market is keeping a close eye on the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate decision, while negative headlines about Binance, the world\u2019s largest digital currency exchange, contributed to price declines across crypto, Gule added.\n\n\u201cThe main trendline support currently stands at $26,800, and as long as Bitcoin remains above it, the trend is expected to be bullish,\u201d said Gule.\n\nWilliam Cai, co-founder and managing partner at New York-based asset manager Wilshire Phoenix, said Bitcoin has been trading within a tight US$25,000 to US$30,000 range and is in search of a story and \u201ca major Fed rate or language surprise this week could provide the impetus needed to break out.\u201d\n\nReflecting the current lacklustre trend, CoinMarketCap\u2019s fear and greed index, a measure of market buy and sell sentiment, fell further into neutral territory on Wednesday with a reading of 52.\n\nThe caution was reflected in digital asset investment products that saw net outflows of US$6.5 million in the week ending July 21, following four prior weeks of consecutive inflows that totaled US$742 million, according to a Monday report from European cryptocurrency investment firm CoinShares.\n\nTrading volumes in such investment products last week fell to US$1.2 billion, below the yearly average and down from US$2.4 billion the prior week, according to CoinShares. By regions, the U.S. and Canada saw 97% of the total outflows of US$21.7 million.\n\nBitcoin-backed investment products were the primary focus which saw US$13 million of outflows last week, while Ether-backed products logged an inflow of US$6.6 million, suggesting sentiment is improving around the second largest cryptocurrency.\n\nEther edged up 0.41% to US$1,857 in early trading in Asia on Wednesday, but remained 2.17% lower for the week.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed, with Dogecoin, XRP, and Tron\u2019s TRX logging gains, while the rest declined. Polygon\u2019s Matic led the losers, falling 2.84% to US$0.7081 and down 4.12% for the week.\n\nDogecoin again headed the winners list on optimism it could become a feature in Twitter\u2019s rebranding to X.com, which will include functions such as \u201cpayments/banking,\u201d according to Twitter Chief Executive Officer Linda Yaccarino on Monday.\n\n\u201cDogecoin rallied recently as speculation increased that the meme coin could be used as a payment mechanism for the rebranded Twitter platform,\u201d said Markus Thielen, head of crypto research & strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, in an emailed comment.\n\n\u201cAs crypto is entering the summer lull that we initially expected for August, DOGE might be the summer\u2019s highflyer as other crypto themes are taking a backseat.\u201d\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization edged up 0.22% in the past 24 hours to US$1.17 trillion, while trading volume fell 27.41% to US$25.68 billion.\n\nForkast 500 dips, Axie Infinity developer to make NFT game with CyberKongz\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market.

Really, they\u2019re massively overpriced even after declining over the year,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nYuga Labs, the developer of BAYC and MAYC, launched \u201cMade by Apes\u201d on Tuesday \u2013 a platform that grants BAYC and MAYC holders unique on-chain licences for their own products or services featuring the ape-themed NFTs.\n\nBAYC holders have already been building businesses around their collections, including fast food, clothing, and beverage operations, and more brands are using BAYC in promotions.\n\n\u201cDuring this bear market we are seeing actual utility begin to get fleshed out like with Yuga Labs\u2019 new fully on-chain IP licensing platform,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nElsewhere, Sky Mavis, the Vietnam-based developer behind play-to-earn NFT game Axie Infinity, announced a partnership with NFT project CyberKongz on Tuesday, where the two will jointly develop an NFT game based on CyberKongz\u2019s incoming Genkai NFT collection.\n\nU.S. equity futures stall ahead of Fed move\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell|Image: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded mixed as of 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday in Hong Kong, with Dow Jones and Nasdaq futures inching lower, while S&P 500 futures edged up.\n\nAll three major U.S. indexes closed higher in regular Tuesday trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average logging gains for the 12th consecutive day, extending its longest winning streak in six years.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes fell on Wednesday ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate announcement later today. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei all logged losses.\n\nAlthough a China Politburo meeting on Monday pledged policies to support the country\u2019s ailing property market and revive domestic consumption, China\u2019s stock market requires imminent and actionable measures from the government, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday citing a note by U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe U.S. Fed announces its interest rate decision on Wednesday with analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predicting a 98.9% chance for a 25-basis-point rate hike this month.\n\nWith a rise in rates mostly priced into markets, the focus of attention will be comments by Fed chair Jerome Powell on how the central bank views inflation trends, offering some pointers on future monetary policies.\n\nThe current Fed under Powell has raised rates 10 times since March 2022 to tackle inflation that was running at 40-year highs last year. The annual inflation rate has since fallen to 3% in June from more than 9% last year.\n\nHowever, with inflation still above the Fed\u2019s target of 2%, economists forecast more potential hikes this year based on recent comments by Powell.\n\nOn the economic data front, the U.S. consumer confidence index hit a two-year high in July, according to the U.S. think tank Conference Board on Tuesday, \u201clikely reflecting lower inflation and a tight labor market.\u201d\n\nThe consumer confidence index, together with data on inflation, the housing market and retail sales, contributed to the optimism that the U.S. economy could avoid a recession in 2023, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\n\n(Updates with equity section, adds fear and greed index in first section.)"

        "title": "'Elegant and ass-backward': Jameson Lopp's first impression of Bitcoin - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Jameson Lopp has been on the front lines of the battle between technologists and those who want to preserve Bitcoin as it is since the scaling debates of 2015\u20132017.\n\nThe topic arouses such passion that many suspect it was a disgruntled Bitcoiner opponent who called down an armed SWAT team to his home, leading him to famously go underground.\n\nLopp blamed the 2017 incident on the \u201csame old same old: Bitcoin philosophy and scaling debate arguments. A few of the more extreme cases think I\u2019m some kind of manipulative monster.\u201d\n\nDear anonymous coward who just sent dozens of cops w/ rifles to my house w/a false hostage situation report: I am not so easily intimidated. \u2014 Jameson Lopp (@lopp) October 16, 2017\n\nLopp, who is currently the chief technology officer for decentralized wallet service Casa, is an advocate for cautious progress who commands respect among the Bitcoin community.\n\nSpeaking from an undisclosed location, Lopp says he worries the backlash against Ordinals NFTs might result in lower support for much-needed future upgrades. Ordinals were largely an unexpected result of the 2021 Taproot soft fork.\n\n\u201cThe problem that I see is that there\u2019s a lot of ossification proponents out there. And they\u2019re pointing at Ordinals and inscriptions and saying, \u2018You see, this is what happens when you change the protocol. It gets abused and used in ways that were not intended,\u2019\u201d he says.\n\nBut Lopp says the alternative is every bit as risky. He has carefully considered the problem of Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cossification\u201d \u2014 where the network becomes so big \u201cit kind of gets crushed under its own weight and unable to change itself.\u201d\n\nJameson Lopp enjoys a beer bought with Bitcoin. (Twitter)\n\nLopp uses email as an example of an internet protocol that ossified in the 1990s, leaving it with little ability to deal with the massive volumes of spam that subsequently arose.\n\nInstead, corporations constructed expensive centralized reputation services on top to sort out spam from legit emails, and today, large numbers of emails that don\u2019t comply with the arcane rules of the systems simply disappear into a black hole. And users are still deluged with spam.\n\n\u201cAs of today, something like 90% of all email users are captured by five corporations. So, I think we have to ask ourselves: Is that the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin that we want to see? And if not, then what do we need to do to prevent that?\u201d\n\nFor Lopp, scaling Bitcoin \u2014 something he\u2019s been agitating for, for years \u2014 remains the big challenge as the Lightning Network is \u201cnot going to fix everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you talk to any of the developers, who\u2019re pretty deep into the protocol, you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find any of them who think that we should ossify the protocol now. There\u2019s so much work to be done.\u201d\n\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know how much time we have left to do that.\u201d\n\nHistorically, Lopp\u2019s company Casa has been solely focused on Bitcoin, but last month, it outraged puritans on social media by adding Ethereum to its multisignature self-custody solutions. It highlights the fact Bitcoin has a fast-growing challenger snapping at its heels if it lets up the pace.\n\nYou can take the Bitcoiner out of the south, but\u2026 (Twitter)\n\nWho is Jameson Lopp?\n\nLopp grew up in a \u201cfairly typical Southern American conservative household\u201d in North Carolina, where his father\u2019s side of the family has lived since the 1700s. It was clear from early on that he was super bright, and his parents pushed him hard to achieve great things at school.\n\n\n\n\u201cI read probably several grades above my reading level, and I read all the time. I had a special exemption at the library to check out more books than you are normally allowed to just because I was going through such a high volume of them.\u201d\n\nPlaced into high-level courses, he often wound up sitting on his own doing separate assignments from the rest of the class, something of a \u201csocial outcast.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the social side, I would just get even more awkwardness and sort of abuse because I would sometimes use vocabulary that nobody else was using, and they were like, you know, \u2018Who is this alien guy?\u2019\u201d\n\nLopp ended up joining Mensa in 2010, mainly to see if he could pass the test requiring an IQ in the top 2%. Naturally, he set up a Mensa Bitcoin special interest group, though he says super-smart people don\u2019t necessarily get Bitcoin any faster than anyone else and points to the dismissive reaction to Satoshi\u2019s original announcement about Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThe people who were responding to that email were not stupid. They were incredibly intelligent people. But if you\u2019re intelligent enough, you can always find reasons why something won\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nJack Dorsey is slowly transitioning into 2017 Jameson Lopp. pic.twitter.com/WpHRGq8kAm \u2014 Brad Mills \ud83d\udd11\u26a1\ufe0f (@bradmillscan) June 4, 2021\n\nComing of age\n\nAfter school, Lopp headed to study computer science at the \u201cvery liberal\u201d University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Brought up to be a very conservative Republican, he says university \u201cswung my perspective a little bit more outside of the sort of family and household standards that I had been used to.\u201d He ended up voting for Obama in 2008, Libertarian in the following election, and now believes he can have more impact building decentralized financial infrastructure than voting.\n\n\u201cThese days, I view politics at a very arm\u2019s length amused perspective.\u201d\n\nHe worked in email marketing for years in one of the tech areas near Raleigh, moving up from working on the web app to large-scale data analysis. Like most people in tech, he read about Bitcoin a few times and dismissed it as \u201cnerd money that was going to end badly\u201d before finally reading the white paper in 2012.\n\n\u201cI was just blown away,\u201d he says, noting that Satoshi approached the double-spending and Byzantine generals problem from the exact opposite direction of the \u201cperformance and efficiency\u201d mindset Lopp had been taught.\n\n\u201cWhen I read the white paper and I saw the solution to the problem, I was amazed because it was both elegant and ass-backward,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe solution was to make everything really, really expensive in terms of resource usage. I was like, wow, I never in a million years would have thought to try that because it just goes against our nature as computer scientists.\u201d\n\nSupplied image of Jameson Lopp.\n\nBitcoiners back then were primarily libertarians, cypherpunks and crypto-anarchists, and the chance to find an alternate way forward was part of the appeal.\n\n\u201cWe can build alternative power structures, alternative systems that don\u2019t rely upon any of the existing infrastructure. And basically, we can create our own rules for how these systems should operate.\u201d\n\nLopp forks Bitcoin Core\n\nWithin two years, Lopp had created a fork of Bitcoin Core called Statoshi to \u201cbring more transparency and understanding to the internal operations of a Bitcoin node.\u201d He applied for a grant from the Bitcoin Foundation to work full time on the project but never heard back. Five years later, he discovered he\u2019d been successful, but the foundation fell apart before he received any money.\n\nLopp also applied to work at Coinbase in 2015 and \u201cnever even got an interview,\u201d but his work on Statoshi did land him a gig running the nodes for institutional custody and infrastructure provider BitGo. He also began to nurture his public profile, ramping up his research and writing \u2014 he\u2019s written for CoinDesk, Cointelegraph and Forbes \u2014 tweeting more often, organizing Meetups and presenting at events. He\u2019s now a regular at conferences around the world, but it wasn\u2019t easy to start.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely an introvert, though you wouldn\u2019t know it because I do all of these public speaking events. But that took a lot of practice to do.\u201d\n\nLopp was happy to lob the occasion grenade during the scaling debates. (Twitter)\n\nLopp says the block size wars (2015\u20132017) was the period when he started to become really well-known in Bitcoiner circles. Initially, he was on the big blocks side, writing an article in 2015 calling for an increase in the 1MB size of blocks to increase capacity and suggesting blocks may one day hit 10GB. He also supported the Bitcoin XT fork of Bitcoin Core, which ended up part of Bitcoin Cash.\n\n\u201cThat was really a result of what I had been doing as an engineer for the past decade,\u201d he says, adding that he\u2019d spend much of each year prepping for the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales because \u201cif you couldn\u2019t handle that, then it would be a bad user experience, you would lose customers, you would lose money, and the business would not grow as quickly.\u201d He didn\u2019t want Bitcoin to lose potential users through a bad experience with the slow, expensive blockchain.\n\nHowever, his perspective started to change when he realized the impact bigger blocks would have on his own work at BitGo, writing services that talked to the nodes.\n\n\u201cI started to see the opposite side of the argument,\u201d he explains. \u201cEven with these \u2018tiny\u2019 1MB blocks, it was quite challenging for me to write services that could ingest all of this blockchain data at a very fast pace.\u201d\n\nIt took weeks sometimes to get a new indexing service up and running from scratch, and doubling or tripling the block size would require exponentially more resources \u201cto the point where only the largest enterprises who had a lot of money to throw at this problem would even be able to run the nodes and the services on top of them.\u201d\n\nSo, while Lopp ended up strongly supporting SegWit as a practical solution and thinks Bitcoin is superior to any other cryptocurrency as \u201csound money,\u201d he also sees room for experimentation on other protocols, and on Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cA lot of people get very ideological and, in some cases, puritanical about this stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cBitcoin is not a kitchen sink type of protocol there. There\u2019s a lot of things that you can\u2019t do on Bitcoin that you can do with other protocols.\u201d\n\nSu Casa, mi Casa\n\nLopp joined the decentralized Bitcoin self-custody service Casa in 2018 and was soon promoted to chief technology officer. He also has the title of co-founder. Casa is an alternative to centralized custodians and offers a range of multisignature wallet plans that enable users to avoid losing their funds in security incidents and to recover lost or stolen keys.\n\nCasa began support for Ethereum last month and claims it\u2019s the first company to enable self-custody of both Bitcoin and Ether with up to five keys for distributed security. ERC-20 and NFT support is in the works.\n\n\u201cObviously, there were a few clients who fell into the sort of extreme Bitcoin-only camp who went their own way,\u201d says Lopp, adding that this was expected. \u201cReally, it\u2019s this loud, tiny minority that can seem a lot bigger than they are if you\u2019re on social media. But in reality, I would say most of our clients and most Bitcoiners, in general, are pretty moderate and kind of apathetic about all of the drama.\u201d\n\nHe says the decision resulted from user demand because many existing clients \u201cdo have more diverse portfolios, and they want to have that same level of security for assets other than Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nCasa Co-founder and CTO, Jameson @lopp, explains how Casa multi-key vaults provide the highest level of security for everyday savers. pic.twitter.com/2CnWWLyUwZ \u2014 Casa (@CasaHODL) July 3, 2023\n\nThe loud, tiny minority goes SWATing\n\nThe famous SWATing incident happened after his views began to evolve. A 911 caller claimed to be holed up at Lopp\u2019s house with hostages, having already shot someone.\n\n\u201cBy my voice, you can tell I\u2019m not in a mental health state right now. I\u2019m on drugs. I\u2019m all over the place. I don\u2019t know what to do. [\u2026] If I don\u2019t get $60,000, I\u2019m going to blow the whole fucking block up.\u201d\n\nHeavily armed cops arrived at his home, guns drawn. Lopp wasn\u2019t home at the time and arrived to find his neighborhood shut down and crawling with dozens of patrol units, a SWAT team, a mobile command post, a fire truck and a paramedic. He had a conversation with a cop to find out what happened, not realizing he was the suspect.\n\nLopp recounts a chat with a cop on his blog. (Cypherpunk Cogitations)\n\n\n\nFollowing the incident, Lopp tweeted a video of himself firing off an AR-15 rifle as a warning to anyone trying to find him.\n\nBitcoin security pro tip: protect your software with hardware. pic.twitter.com/R4KeRGRcTP \u2014 Jameson Lopp (@lopp) October 26, 2017\n\nThe incident also inspired Lopp\u2019s radical privacy experiment to live off the grid and off the radar of the authorities. Apart from standard stuff like using VPNs, private mailboxes and using fake names, it also involved setting up a bunch of limited liability companies to apply for bank accounts and credit cards one step removed. He mainly spent cash, used burner phone numbers and even bought \u201cthe crappiest, cheapest hole in the wall I could find that has a physical mailbox\u201d as a physical address to get a driver\u2019s license.\n\n\u201cI determined that the amount of effort and especially money that is required to do it is going to price almost everybody out of doing this,\u201d he says, adding the fact that you have to lie to everyone was also likely to deter people from trying it.\n\n\u201cEveryone in my physical proximity, my neighbors, they only know my pseudonym. And you know, I have my backstory, and I literally had to create this whole alternate persona, but not so different, it would be difficult for me to make it believable. So, like, I\u2019m still a software engineer who knows a lot about security.\u201d\n\nLopp maintains a GitHub list of \u201cknown physical Bitcoin attacks,\u201d which spans from Hal Finney getting SWATed in December 2014 to a couple in Queens, New York who were mugged in mid-July by assailants disguised as FBI agents who stole their car, $40,000 in cash and their crypto.\n\nThe No. 1 lesson to take from the list is that the fewer people who know they can rob you of your crypto by threatening you with a $5 wrench, the better. So it\u2019s interesting to learn that prior to his SWATing, Lopp used to drive around in a flashy Lotus Elise with a BITCOIN license plate, basically inviting attacks.\n\nAlthough many people thought it was a Lamborghini, Lopp says that \u201cit was actually a salvage title car that I got for $20,000.\u201d He eventually sold it, but he has the BITCOIN license plate hanging on the wall behind him during our interview as a memento. These days, Lopp drives \u201cextremely common vehicles that are mass-produced by the millions.\u201d\n\nThe Bitcoin number plate has been retired. (Twitter)\n\nFuture progress for Bitcoin\n\nPushing for progress on Bitcoin while not destroying all of the things Bitcoiners hold dear has always been a thorny problem. Roger \u201cBitcoin Jesus\u201d Ver couldn\u2019t solve it and went off with the Bitcoin Cash camp, who then split off with Craig \u201cNo, I really am Satoshi\u201d Wright heading up Bitcoin SV.\n\nThere are also Bitcoiners trying to change it from within, like Eric Wall and Udi Wertheimer, who have embraced Ordinals. Wall is also investigating scaling Bitcoin using the same zero-knowledge proof technology being used to scale Ethereum via Starknet.\n\nLopp says he\u2019s focused on a variety of improvements that can be made to \u201clet people start building more outside of the base protocol.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to go through the same onerous process to develop on a second layer, you don\u2019t have to make these sweeping consensus changes that are really risky,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons why I want to see a lot more second layers other than just Lightning. I want to see more sidechains, drive chains, rollups, so on and so forth. Because I think that that is going to enable more innovation, more experimentation.\u201d"

        "content": "In the latest episode of Macro Markets, Cointelegraph analyst Marcel Pechman discusses the United States Federal Reserve\u2019s delicate balancing act of curbing inflation without causing a recession and sheds light on the potential implications for the cryptocurrency market.\n\nIn the crypto world, the anticipation of rising interest rates could have a short-term negative impact. This may lead to a loss of confidence in the U.S. dollar, potentially resulting in a downturn for the crypto market. Nevertheless, Pechman remains optimistic about the potential of Bitcoin (BTC), highlighting its hard-locked monetary policies as a key factor in maintaining value during times of economic uncertainty.\n\nThe much-awaited approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund takes center stage, as it could be a game-changer for the crypto market, potentially paving the way for a bullish run with a target of $200,000.\n\nShifting the focus to the bond market and insights from JPMorgan\u2019s chief investment officer for fixed income. His contrarian strategy of buying debt instruments during inflation spikes to secure higher yields proves prudent. The softening of inflation, as anticipated, validates his timing and experience in bond trading.\n\nHowever, Pechman raises an important point for crypto enthusiasts to consider: if the Federal Reserve reduces interest rates after a series of hikes in 2023, it may initially have negative implications for cryptocurrencies. As investors lose confidence in the U.S. dollar, the crypto market could experience short-term turbulence.\n\nWhile the soft landing scenario remains a critical focus for investors as the Fed\u2019s decisions unfold, crypto investors should remain vigilant and consider the long-term resilience of Bitcoin amid evolving economic dynamics.\n\nCheck out the full show on Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel, and make sure to like and subscribe for exclusive content from leading crypto analysts and experts."

        "title": "Bitcoin Exchange Balances Reach Lows Last Seen in 2018 \u2014 What Does This Mean for BTC Price? - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nAn estimated 11% of Bitcoin\u2019s total circulating supply currently sits on exchanges.\n\nBTC held on exchanges continues to decline.\n\nTrend of Bitcoin withdrawals could have upside for BTC price.\n\nThe amount of Bitcoin being held on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges has reached lows not seen since 2018, but the metric could be a bullish sign for the future value of BTC.\n\nBitfinex released its latest Alpha report, which delves into the most prominent insights from the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem. A prominent takeaway from the report focuses on dwindling levels of Bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply held on exchanges.\n\nAccording to the analysts, exchange balances have dropped by 32% from peaks in March 2020, down from 3.1 million BTC to 2.1 million. The report notes that just 11 percent of the circulating supply of Bitcoin remains on exchanges, which is down by 17% from March 2020.\n\nWhile the exact reasons for the trend remain a point of discussion, the report suggests that the propensity of Bitcoin users to hold their coins off exchanges could also have a positive effect on the value of the cryptocurrency in the medium term future.\n\nPlotting the Supply\n\nThe number of Bitcoin held on major exchanges has been on a continuous decline since July 21, 2021, when it reached a peak of 1,675,582 BTC. The price of Bitcoin was $34,680 on that date and started moving to the upside, ultimately reaching $65,500 on November 8 of the same\n\nWith the bear market starting after, the prices have been decreasing dramatically, but BTC accumulation continued throughout the bear market, ultimately decreasing to the levels last seen in 2018.\n\nThe first major dip was from November 21, 2022, when it was 1,35M to 1,22M on December 5 of the same year. Consequently, this is the time Bitcoin\u2019s price began to rise and made an increase from $17,088 on December 5 to $30,314 in mid-April 2023.\n\nSupply on exchanges rose in this period as well and the mid-April high could have marked the completion of a corrective structure. But supply held on exchanges started falling back down again in a sharp manner and made it back down to the pre-recovery levels on June 19.\n\nSince June 19, the number of Bitcoin held in major exchanges has been on the rise again, which correlates with the end of the price increase of Bitcoin. Can this be an early sign of the coming sellers\u2019 pressure?\n\nHow to Interpret BTC Supply On Exchanges\n\nFirst and foremost, as with every metric and technical indicator, BTC supply on exchanges should be interpreted relatively \u2013 meaning taking into account recent valuations.\n\nHowever, the consensus is that if this metric is on the rise it could mean that investors are sending BTC to exchanges from their private wallets in order to make a sale.\n\nAlternatively, if the number of Bitcoin is diminishing from exchange wallets, it usually means that investors are withdrawing the asset to their private wallets in order to hold for the long term, in other words, are accumulating.\n\nAs said above it should be viewed relatively because there can be numerous reasons why holds might want to deposit or withdraw Bitcoin from exchanges. Also, there are other players in the market that can cause the price change other than investors \u2013 miners, funds, and even exchanges.\n\nOther Evidence of Accumulation?\n\nAside from the discussed metric other on-chain charts can be cross-referenced to support the accumulation assumptions.\n\nOne of them is Exchange Inflow Coin Days Destroyed (CDD), which indicates whether or not long-term holders are moving their coins for a possible sell. If the values are high, then an incoming selling pressure is possible, but if the value is low, then it could indicate that long-term holders are still accumulating, or at least sitting tight.\n\nThe chart above shows that the values are small, meaning that long-term holders are still sitting on the sidelines.\n\nAnother way of looking at the possibility of long-term investors accumulating is by looking into whale activity.\n\nThe exchange whale ratio has been on the rise since June 25, meaning that they are using the exchanges more than usual. It\u2019s important to note that true whales don\u2019t use exchanges but more often OTC services to mitigate the risk of slippage and impact the price when accumulating.\n\nBe it as it may, this metric shows us that even so, the interest is high at the moment, and large transactions have been seen as this metric is calculated as the relative size of the top 10 inflow transactions to total inflows.\n\nAccumulate Rather than Trade\n\nThe analysts concede that the decline of BTC on exchanges could be attributed to the usage of alternatives like decentralized exchanges and funds not covered by its data, but note that available metrics indicate widespread moves to withdraw Bitcoin from exchanges.\n\n\u201cThis is also a testament of how longer-term holders are moving coins to cold storage. We see this as a positive for the price as more investors indicate the desire to accumulate rather than trade.\u201d\n\nThe report also notes that derivatives market participation is increasing, which historically precedes price increases as spot prices decrease.\n\nCryptocurrency-backed investment funds saw a net inflow of $137 million in the third week of July, with 99% of these funds moving to Bitcoin-backed funds. This could also be driven by the fanfare surrounding renewed applications for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds headlined by the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\nThe analysts added that crypto funds have seen four consecutive weeks of gross inflows, with $742 million of investments over the last month.\n\nShorters Underscore Bitcoin\u2019s Dominance\n\nThe report also indicates that Bitcoin\u2019s dominance has been driven by outflows from Bitcoin shorting funds, which rise in value as the market price of BTC drops.\n\n\u201cThese funds experienced $3.2 million in outflows for the week, reinforcing the bullish sentiment for the BTC price among investors, which has now been in a tight range for months,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nThe report said that the data could be used as a \u201cproxy for institutional investor bias\u201d that will see the price of BTC break out of its current range to the upside. Analysts added that these factors paint a picture of Bitcoin\u2019s dominance in the market, despite alt coins growing in market capitalization:\n\n\u201cThe sustained inflows into Bitcoin-backed funds indicate a strong investor confidence in the asset, despite the volatility inherent in the crypto market.\u201d\n\nAddressing the Whale in the Room\n\nThe activity of Bitcoin whales, users that hold major sums of the cryptocurrency, also revealed some interesting on-chain events in recent weeks.\n\nBlockchain data showing a period of increased inflows of BTC onto exchanges was linked to the distribution of 9,852 BTC seized from Silk Road by the United States Justice Department.\n\n\n\nThe institution moved a total of 9,825 BTC to exchanges on July 12, as it began its distribution strategy involving multiple wallets offloading BTC to different exchanges.\n\nChart analysis provided by Nikola Lazic"

        "title": "The Investigation of Larry and Gary Harmon and the Helix Mixer - Chainalysis Blog",
        "content": "Within the span of a few years, two brothers from Ohio were imprisoned for cryptocurrency-related crimes. The first, Larry Dean Harmon, was arrested and charged for a money laundering conspiracy arising from his operation of Helix, a cryptocurrency mixing service operating on the dark web. Shortly after Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations (IRS-CI) seized Larry\u2019s Bitcoin wallets, his younger brother, Gary James Harmon, used Larry\u2019s passwords to steal a portion of the Bitcoin back from the seized wallets. In April 2023, Gary was sentenced to four years in prison for his theft from the government.\n\nWe\u2019re proud to share that Chainalysis tools helped in the investigation of these cases. Below, we\u2019ll describe the Harmon brothers\u2019 criminal activities and how blockchain analysis helped authorities recover some of the stolen funds.\n\nLarry Harmon\u2019s money-laundering operations\n\nAs the founder and primary operator of Helix, Larry Harmon was involved in the cryptocurrency ecosystem for several years. He was also the CEO of Coin Ninja, where Gary was employed, and founded DropBit, the company\u2019s mobile Bitcoin wallet.\n\nHelix was a Bitcoin mixer, and was often used to hide proceeds from drug trafficking and other activities on the dark web. Between 2014 and 2017, Helix processed more than 350,000 Bitcoin (worth approximately $300 million at the time) on behalf of users. Larry regularly promoted Helix to darknet market users and partnered with AlphaBay, Evolution, Agora Market, Nucleus, Dream Market, and other darknet markets to grow Helix\u2019s customer base. Larry also ran Grams, a darknet search engine linked to Helix. In Chainalysis Reactor, we can see the relationship between Helix and these darknet markets:\n\nThese activities quickly attracted the attention of IRS-CI and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). In the early stages of the investigation, an undercover FBI agent transferred Bitcoin from an AlphaBay wallet to Helix and confirmed that using the mixer reduced direct traceability to AlphaBay. Then, law enforcement used Chainalysis to identify 16 Bitcoin wallets which contained nearly 5,000 Bitcoin worth of proceeds from Helix\u2019s operation. When law enforcement searched Larry\u2019s residences in Ohio and Belize, they recovered multiple cryptocurrency storage devices linked to these wallets, and also found an accounting spreadsheet in his Google Drive that indicated ownership of more than $56 million worth of Bitcoin and other assets.\n\nLarry was charged in February 2020 and pled guilty in 2021 to money laundering conspiracy. He also admitted to partnering with darknet market vendors to provide Bitcoin laundering services. Shortly after, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) ordered Larry to pay a $60 million civil penalty \u2014 the first of its kind for Bitcoin mixing activities. He forfeited 4,400 Bitcoin and IRS-CI took custody of his wallets.\n\nGary follows Larry\u2019s footsteps\n\nAfter Larry\u2019s arrest in 2020, Gary was laid off from Coin Ninja and struggled financially. Sensing an opportunity to acquire funds from his brother\u2019s 16 wallets in custody, Gary used Larry\u2019s passwords to access several of them and transferred 712 Bitcoin (worth more than $5 million at the time) to eight new wallets. We can see those transactions below in Reactor.\n\nOnce complete, Gary deposited 68 Bitcoin as collateral for a $1.2 million loan from BlockFi, which he used to purchase a luxury condo in Cleveland, Ohio, and spent at strip clubs and on private jets. The below image shows Gary in a bathtub with cash at a nightclub, which investigators recovered on his phone. Additionally, text messages on the phone suggest he made extravagant purchases around the same time.\n\nIn July 2021, Gary was arrested and federal agents searched his Ohio residence. They found wallets which contained approximately $6,000 in Bitcoin at the time. In addition to his four-year prison sentence, Gary was ordered to surrender $20 million in virtual currencies and other property. He pled guilty to wire fraud and obstruction of justice.\n\nTracking criminals on the blockchain\n\nAlthough criminals like the Harmon brothers continue to launder money using blockchain technology, law enforcement is able to use tools like Chainalysis Reactor and Storyline, and employ other sophisticated strategies to track and recover stolen funds.\n\nIn 2022, IRS-CI announced that it had seized $7 billion worth of digital assets in the previous year. This included a record $3.6 billion from two individuals accused of laundering funds stolen from the 2016 Bitfinex hack, and $3.36 billion recovered from a theft of Bitcoin from darknet market Silk Road. These numbers suggest a crucial difference between investigations involving fiat versus those with cryptocurrency; on the blockchain, everything is immutable and transparent, ensuring that law enforcement will always have trails to follow.\n\nThe 2023 Crypto Crime Report Available now!

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether edge up after Fed raises interest rates as expected; Solana leads winners - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin gained Thursday morning in Asia, but not enough to break through resistance at US$29,500 after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by the expected quarter point. The bank left the door open for another increase in September. Ether moved higher with most top 10 cryptocurrencies. Solana led the winners as its trading volume more than doubled in the past 24 hours. Dogecoin led the losers as the meme token lost some steam after gaining over 11% for the week. The Forkast 500 NFT index traded flat and U.S. equity futures were mixed, reflecting the same performance on Wall Street on Wednesday.\n\nTop cryptos gain\n\nBitcoin rose 0.90% in the last 24 hours to US$29,459 as of 07:15 a.m. in Hong Kong, but was still down 1.37% for the week, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency briefly breached US$29,600 early Thursday morning.\n\nEther moved up 0.88% to US$1,874, but remained 0.68% lower for the seven-day period.\n\nThe marginal gains followed the Fed\u2019s decision to raise benchmark lending rates in the U.S. to between 5.25% and 5.50%, the highest in 22 years, to slow inflation. In a press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said another rate hike in September is possible, but said decisions will be determined by the data at the time.\n\n\u201cAn interesting time for crypto markets although you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell when looking at the price action. With macro markets timidly risk-on, BTC and ETH rose slightly to recoup levels lost earlier this week,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of APAC business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock.\n\nWith the exception of Dogecoin, all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded higher in the past 24 hours.\n\nSolana\u2019s SOL led the winners, jumping 9.51% to US$25.35, but still sitting on a 3.80% loss for the full week. The token\u2019s 24-hour trading volume surged more than 100% to over US$682 million, surpassing that of Ether and indicating investors are betting on a strong rebound.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cSOL\u2019s price increased by about 49% in the past month, primarily driven by the stable development and progress of Solana\u2019s blockchain and ecosystem, with steady growth in user base and restoration of reputation,\u201d said Greta Yuan, head of research at Hong Kong-based digital asset exchange VDX.\n\nDogecoin lost ground after being the darling of the week as the rebranding of Twitter raised speculation it could be part of a payments system on the social media network. It fell 3.52% to US$0.0784, though is still holding a weekly gain of 11.82%.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization gained 0.85% in the past 24 hours to US$1.19 trillion, while trading volume rose 20.51% to US$30.91 billion.\n\nElsewhere, Worldcoin, a cryptocurrency and digital identity project founded by OpenAI chief executive officer Sam Altman, issued its controversial WLD token on Monday and prices soared. The token dipped 1.49% to US$2.28 on Thursday, but is up 36.30% since the launch.\n\n\u201cOpenAI co-founder Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin project might just be one of the most ambitious cryptocurrency projects in recent years,\u201d Louis Schoeman, managing director at Dubai-based trading information platform Forex Suggest, said in emailed comments.\n\n\u201cThe project\u2019s core offering, its World ID, requires users to prove via an iris scan that they are human, and not an AI bot. Those who sign up will receive Worldcoin\u2019s cryptocurrency token WLD,\u201d said Schoeman.\n\n\u201cThis sort of digital ID will be necessary in the development of AI, in order to tell the difference between humans and AI bots online. It\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish fiction from reality, which is a particular concern in the financial and democratic systems. Worldcoin wants to defend people from AI misinformation and make it clear who and what to trust online,\u201d added Schoeman.\n\nIn emailed comments on Worldcoin, Michael Silberberg, head of investor relations at the U.S.-based crypto hedge fund AltTab Capital, said: \u201cThe value of a real non-transferable, and cryptographically secure identity is potent as it could reduce digital fraud, help bank the unbanked, and even reduce the number of times I have to convince robots I\u2019m not a robot a day.\u201d\n\nAccording to reports, the Worldcoin project signed up more than two million users during beta testing and is now expanding operations to 35 cities across 20 countries, but the US isn\u2019t yet one of them, said Schoeman.\n\n\u201cAltman made it clear the company didn\u2019t feel the US would make or break the project, but with North America said to account for around 18% of the total world crypto value received, breaking into the US market will be a major concern for Worldcoin,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA global digital ID enabling private identity verifications is undeniably revolutionary, however, it\u2019s certain to stir up controversy, with many already calling the exchange of biometric data for crypto tokens an outlandish bribe,\u201d said Schoeman.\n\nForkast 500 flat, Sotheby\u2019s NFT auction sells out\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index edged up a slight 0.57% in the past 24 hours to 2,651.39 as of 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. It\u2019s still down 2.22% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum, Solana, Polygon and Cardano NFT market indexes all logged losses.\n\nWhile the overall NFT market remains in the doldrums, auction house Sotheby\u2019s NFT art collections are attracting buyers of so-called generative art, or the process of algorithmically generating art forms.\n\nThemes and Variations, an NFT collection of 500 generative artworks by artist Vera Moln\u00e1r, was sold out within an hour in a Dutch auction on Wednesday for 631 ETH (US$1.2 million). It is the first collection in Sotheby\u2019s Gen Art Program, which aims to spotlight three generative artists each year.\n\nWith secondary markets included, the trading volume of Themes and Variations has totaled over US$2 million, according to data from CryptoSlam, making it the top NFT collection by that measure in the past 24 hours.\n\n\u201cIn the future we\u2019re going to look back at this time in NFTs as a very special time for generative art,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs. \u201cArt is still the best use case for NFTs, and it\u2019s exciting to see so many collectors appreciating it even in a market like this,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m expecting to see a rather steady stream of higher-end generative art from Sotheby\u2019s, whose new generative art platform is using the Art Blocks Engine to produce these on-chain works,\u201d added Petscher.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume dropped 5.16% in the past 24 hours to US$18.41 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volumes on the Ethereum, Polygon, Bitcoin and Cardano blockchains fell, while Solana, Mythos Chain and Immutable X saw an increase in trading.\n\n\u201cMythos Chain and ImmutableX are also up 47% and 69%, showing yet again that gaming NFTs (from Gods Unchained, CS:GO, TF2, DOTA 2) are another perfect use case for NFTs,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nElsewhere, social media platform Reddit launched the latest series of its NFT collectible avatars on early Thursday.\n\nEntitled \u201cRetro Reimagined\u201d, the collection features designs from both independent artists and NFT developers like Cool Cats. Unlike ordinary NFTs, Reddit\u2019s collectible avatars are purchased with fiat currencies through a Reddit platform at fixed prices, but can be transferred to a third-party crypto wallet as NFTs.\n\nU.S. equity futures rise\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded higher as of 12:10 p.m. on Thursday in Hong Kong, after the three major U.S. indexes closed mixed in regular trading the prior day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose on Wednesday to extend its longest winning streak in six years, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite logged losses.\n\nAs analysts expected, the Federal Reserve announced a 25-basis-point rate hike on Wednesday in its more than year-long quest to reduce the inflation rate. The benchmark rate is now in the range of 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest since January 2001.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes rose after the Fed\u2019s rate rise was in line with expectations. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei all logged gains.\n\nIn a press conference following the Fed announcement, the chair Jerome Powell said his agency will keep focused on economic data for future discussions on rate adjustments, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.\n\nThe Fed typically has eight monthly meetings a year to decide on interest rates, with the next two-day gathering scheduled for September 19-20.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation as well as the balance of risks,\u201d said Powell in his statement.\n\nHe said the Fed remains committed to bringing the annual inflation rate to its long-term goal of 2%. The annual inflation rate in June sat at 3.0%.\n\nOn the U.S. economic data front, investors have Thursday\u2019s report on gross domestic product (GDP) for the second quarter, and Friday\u2019s personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index for additional insights into the state of the economy and inflation.\n\nAmazon, MasterCard and McDonald\u2019s are also set to release their second-quarter earnings on Thursday.\n\n(Updates with comment on Solana in first section.)"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nThe week ending July 21 saw a withdrawal of $13 million from Bitcoin investment products.\n\nDuring the same week, short Bitcoin products had outflows of $5.5 million.\n\nInvestment instruments for Ether and XRP are booming as Bitcoin products experience a decline\n\nThere has been a discernible change in the crypto market where investors are becoming less interested in once-popular Bitcoin-related financial products and more fond of altcoins. The fact that there have been outflows for the first time since Blackrock applied to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF in June indicates that investor opinion has changed.\n\nJames Butterfill, the head of research at CoinShares, reported on July 24 that the $13 million in withdrawals from Bitcoin investment products for the week ending July 21 had reversed five weeks of inflows.\n\nDuring the week, there were outflows of $5.5 million from short Bitcoin products.\n\nBitcoin Fear and Greed Index is 50 ~ Neutral\n\nCurrent price: $29,178 pic.twitter.com/T1DMFpsX9p \u2014 Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index (@BitcoinFear) July 25, 2023\n\nIn comparison, investment instruments for Ether and XRP are booming as Bitcoin products experience this decline. These alternative cryptocurrencies, which have seen a combined inflow of $9.2 million over the last week, are establishing themselves as market leaders.\n\nLast week, Ether investing tools won the competition for best performers, bringing in $6.6 million. Following closely behind was an infusion of $2.6 million into XRP funds. Other alternative currencies, such Solana and Polygon, have also seen sizeable inflows of $1.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively.\n\nInvestor preferences have changed as a result of Ripple\u2019s partial victory over the US Securities and Exchange Commission on July 13. The court\u2019s crucial decision that XRP is not a security when sold to the general public on exchanges may increase investor trust.\n\nBTC\u2019s price is at $29,128, down 3.1% from the previous day.\n\nLosing Interest in ETFs For Altcoins?\n\nSince mid-June, a number of financial organizations have submitted Exchange Traded Fund applications for Bitcoin.\n\nSince the first U.S. Bitcoin exchange-traded fund application was made in 2013, Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have become a significant issue for the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nAs its underlying asset, a Bitcoin ETF monitors the value of Bitcoin. According to supporters of a Bitcoin ETF, a significant barrier to entry for newcomers to the cryptocurrency field is the intricacy of exchanges, digital wallets, and private keys. Without actually holding any Bitcoin themselves, these investors can gain exposure to the cryptocurrency through a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nBitcoin ETFs have appeared worldwide, particularly in Canada, Brazil, and Dubai, where they are regarded as significant deal. Additionally, the NYSE introduced the ProShares Bitcoin futures ETF.\n\nBitcoin: Still the Principal Player\n\nDespite this brief downturn, Bitcoin maintains its hegemony in the market for digital assets. It\u2019s $558 million in inflows in 2023 helped it reach a significant $25.0 billion in assets under management. As a result, it continues to own 67.4% of the market.\n\nSeveral financial institutions have been waiting in line to submit Exchange Traded Fund applications for Bitcoin spot with the SEC during the past month. Since mid-June, the following companies have entered the race: BlackRock, ARK Invest, Fidelity, Galaxy Digital, VanEck, Valkyrie Investments, NYDIG, SkyBridge, and WisdomTree. This shows that investors continue to believe in Bitcoin\u2019s potential.\n\nThe Bitcoin market\u2019s evolving terrain makes for an interesting sight. Altcoins are becoming increasingly popular among investors as Bitcoin investment products experience outflows. Despite suggesting a possibly more varied future, this pattern does not seriously challenge Bitcoin\u2019s market dominance.\n\nWhat Are Other Desirable Coins?\n\nInstead speaking about Bitcoin only, a well-known cryptocurrency analyst has forecasted brief price increases for a few altcoins, including those that compete with Ethereum (ETH), such as Polkadot (DOT), Cardano (ADA), and Avalanche (AVAX).\n\nCrypto trader Benjamin Cowen explains to his 784,000 YouTube subscribers in a new strategy session that cryptocurrencies in 2023 are likely to follow the same trend they did in 2018, when they dramatically increased before falling down to new lows.\n\nCowen predicts that the current cryptocurrency rise will be similar to those in the past and will probably come to an end once Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) dominance level returns to its previous level.\n\nThe Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) chart, which shows how much of the overall cryptocurrency market cap is owned by Bitcoin, is closely watched by traders. A greater BTC dominance level suggests that traders prefer the most popular digital asset over alternative currencies.\n\nAccording to Cowen, several cryptocurrencies, including Polkadot, Cardano, Avalanche, and Polygon, are currently honoring their 20-week simple moving average (SMA) as resistance."

        "content": "Bitcoin pizza has become a popular trend in recent years, with restaurants now accepting digital currency payments for delicious slices. These businesses recognize the potential benefits of using Bitcoin, such as the ability to accept payments from customers who prefer not to store their credit card information on their phones. With pizza and Bitcoin being a perfect combination, this article will explore the origin and significance of Bitcoin Pizza Day.\n\nBTC Pizza Day Origin\n\nLaszlo Hanyecz, a pioneer cryptocurrency user, paid 10,000 bitcoins ($267 million, as of today) for two pizzas on May 22, 2010. This transaction marked the first use of bitcoin in purchasing goods.\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day is observed globally on May 22. The day commemorates the first use of decentralized digital money to purchase a pizza in the real world.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/coingecko/status/1660460347265019905\n\nSignificance of Bitcoin Pizza Day\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day is celebrated essentially as a technological revolution and invention of alternative money. High inflation rates experienced in 2010, just after the global financial crisis, raised questions about the economic models and policies and the role of traditional fiat currency as a store of value. Bitcoin was a relief.\n\nBitcoin gained some real-world tangibility and gave crypto enthusiasts a realization of how it could represent the negotiated value traders in virtual deals.\n\nThe Bitcoin community has since expanded, with numerous new developments increasing Bitcoin use cases and transaction costs slashed. Many traders currently accept Bitcoin payments for goods and services.\n\nThe May 22 pizza transaction gave way for a tamper-proof, sensor-proof digital currency with no centralized issuer.\n\nHistory of Bitcoin Pizza Day\n\nOn May 18, 2010, a Florida programmer and early bitcoin miner named Laszlo Hanyecz said on Bitcointalk.org that he wished to buy pizza using bitcoin. He offered 10,000 BTC to anyone willing to take him up on his offer, to order, collect and deliver them to him. 19-year-old bitcoin user Jeremy Sturdivant took him up on his trade and offered $41 for those bitcoins, pricing BTC at less than half a cent per coin. He took up the offer, purchased the Pizzas from Papa Jones at $25, and delivered them. This transaction marked a historical event.\n\nBy May 2010, bitcoin boasted a small but growing economy, mostly trading peer-to-peer and on small exchanges. The use of bitcoin to purchase goods was unheard of.\n\nHanyecz acquired his bitcoins through mining on his laptop. Bitcoin mining on consumer-grade hardware was utterly sensible at the time. Bitcoin mining is a highly competitive industry, with extensive mining firms spending millions of dollars developing specialized hardware such as ASICs.\n\nBefore the first bitcoin halving in 2012, successful miners earned 50 BTC, meaning miners needed only 200 blocks to earn 10,000 BTC, a task not so tricky given there weren\u2019t many people competing to mine.\n\nThe following are key highlights of the history of Bitcoin Pizza Day:\n\n10,000 BTC was worth $41\n\nHanyecz traded his bitcoin for $41, putting the price per bitcoin at roughly $0.004.\n\nHanyecz waited four days to get a delivery\n\nHanyecz initially posted on the Bitcoin.org forums on Tuesday, May 18, but he got his order a while. Jercos completed the delivery the next day, the transaction at around 2:16 p.m. EST.\n\nHanyecz bought more than two Pizzas for bitcoin\n\nEnticed by the response and possibility of buying pizza using bitcoin, Hanyecz pushed the limit in June, announcing that the deal was \u2018an open offer,\u2019 but brought it to a close in August since he could not generate thousands of coins daily.\n\nJercos sold his bitcoin\n\nFive years after the trade, Sturdivant disposed of his bitcoin worth about $400. He supported the currency spending, noting that the 10,000 BTC he received quickly returned to the economy.\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day wasn\u2019t as popular\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day is currently widely known. However, it was non-existent before 2014 since awareness of Bitcoin was relatively low.\n\nHanyecz\u2019s story, partly popularised by a New York Times article, was boosted in 2014 by a blog and tweet from the @Bitcoin Twitter handle.\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day isn\u2019t the first \u201cbitcoin holiday\u201d\n\nIn 2011, the Bitcoin community was keen to mark the disappearance of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto after stepping down from his role as project lead. April 28, 2011, was dubbed \u201cSatoshi Disappear Day.\u201d\n\nPictures of the Real Bitcoin Pizzas\n\nHanyecz\u2019s penchant for photography led him to maintain well-kept records of what the pies looked like in 2010.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day is a global phenomenon. Bitcoin is now widely known worldwide, and its value is no longer that of a few cents on the dollar. Companies and businesses appreciate the value of crypto and offer services payable using crypto. This economic revolution continues to gain momentum as adoption and uses cases increase."

        "content": "\ufeff Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana and hundreds more are hot commodities in online trading, and it\u2019s possible for an investor to make a profit. But many people have experienced dramatic losses, some through bogus investment platforms touted by scammers as sure moneymakers.\n\n\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) warns consumers that \u201ccrypto investing comes with lots of risks, including scams.\u201d\n\nAARP Membership LIMITED TIME OFFER Flash Sale!

Even so, you can use crypto to buy goods and services, exchange it for U.S. dollars and other conventional currencies on digital markets, and even obtain it at specialized ATMs.\n\nBut unlike the value of government-backed money, that of virtual currencies is driven entirely by supply and demand. This can create wild swings that produce big gains for investors \u2014 or big losses. And crypto investments are subject to far less regulatory protection than traditional financial products like stocks, bonds and mutual funds. Meanwhile, those crypto ATMs are favored by criminals for their anonymity and general lack of oversight.\n\nCryptocurrency fraud has taken a quantum leap in recent years. The FTC says that in 2022, more than 53,000 people reported losing a total of more than $1.4 billion in crypto to scams."

Today, over 35% of global bitcoin mining happens in the United States , but a significant majority of system solutions are designed and/or manufactured in Asia leading to supply chain risks from geo-political and other factors. Additionally, mining operators are locating themselves close to energy sources in harsh environments, to utilize wasted or excess energy in variable demand-supply situations.\n\nThe Auradine team leveraged their proven expertise in semiconductor design, software engineering, and high-performance, telco-grade systems to develop the Teraflux\u2122 family. Teraflux\u2122 systems enable a secure global \u2018 Bitcoin 3.0 \u2019 blockchain that can provide stability to the mismatched demand and supply needs of the energy ecosystem, drive the growth of renewable infrastructure, and enable grid modernization.\n\nThe Teraflux\u2122 bitcoin miner family delivers several compelling benefits to the Bitcoin industry, including:\n\nUnrivaled speed and efficiency: world\u2019s fastest air-cooled system performance with hash rates up to 185 TH/s and up to 3x higher hashing density (TH/s per unit volume) immersion miners, delivering significant capex benefits.\n\nEnergyTune\u2122 innovation: patent pending technology that allows miners to dynamically adjust the energy consumption and bitcoin hash rate based on demand response needs of the electrical grids.\n\nSuperior uptime and TCO: designed to operate under harsh conditions at data center scale including ability to operate air-cooled miners up to 50\u00b0C ambient, boot-up in sub-zero temperatures, and maintain operations without reboots.\n\n\n\nFred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital Holdings, mentioned \u201cthe Teraflux\u2122 range enables us to rapidly drive improved demand response at a fleet level that is critical to our mining operations. Auradine\u2019s team experience in developing high performance systems with a focus on reliability and uptime along with the ability to source a US based supply was important in our decision to move forward with the Teraflux\u2122 products.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are excited to be launching Teraflux\u2122 as our first product line supporting Bitcoin being a responsible partner to the energy ecosystem, along with strong customer traction. Our focus continues to be on innovation, scalability, and sustainability. We are continuing work to drive the next generation of internet infrastructure across blockchain, AI, and privacy,\u201d said Rajiv Khemani, Co-Founder and CEO of Auradine.\n\nAuradine has developed a comprehensive partnership ecosystem for the Teraflux\u2122 range including open API\u2019s to enable simple and rapid deployability. This includes:\n\nFluxVision\u2122 as a comprehensive cloud-based solution with UI\u2019s for managing the miners at data center scale including UI\u2019s for EnergyTune and AutoTune.\n\nOpen API\u2019s for connecting into in-house or third-party miner management systems.\n\nIntegration with major fleet management software solutions from Foreman and Awesome Miner, a product from IntelliBreeze Software AB.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt has been a pleasure to have been working closely with Auradine\u2019s engineering team on a smooth integration using FluxVision API\u2019s to ensure a powerful offering for mining customers,\u201d Patrik Engstr\u00f6m, CEO of IntelliBreeze Software AB, indicated.\n\nIn May of this year, Auradine secured $81 million in Series A funding led by Celesta Capital and Mayfield. The funding has fueled Auradine's mission to power the future of web infrastructure and unlock the full potential of digitized assets.\n\nFor more information or to place an order for the Teraflux\u2122 range, please visit www.auradine.com or contact sales@auradine.com .\n\nAbout Auradine\n\nAuradine is a leader in web infrastructure solutions focused on blockchain, AI, and privacy.

Discover SCENE\n\nEven long-dormant Bitcoin whales can\u2019t sit still.\n\nA number of big investors holding millions of dollars in BTC moved their holdings last week after years of dormancy.\n\nOn July 20, two wallets from 2011, each holding 10 BTC (valued at $292,767 as of this writing), moved their holdings to new locations. The next day, a wallet holding 5 BTC ($146,383) budged after 12 years of inactivity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThen, around $30.3 million in \u201cdigital gold\u201d\u2014or 1,037 BTC\u2014moved after its owner put it in a new wallet for the first time since 2012. The price of the cryptocurrency was $4.92 per coin back then.\n\nA BTC whale that has been dormant for 11 years transferred all 1,037.42 $BTC($37.8M) to a new address\"bc1qtl\" an hour ago. The whale received 1,037.42 $BTC($5,107 at that time) on Apr 11, 2012, when the price was $4.92.https://t.co/k8ZmO5vc8X pic.twitter.com/xBaw2dQfY8 \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 22, 2023\n\nFinally, on July 24, a wallet from 2010 moved a hefty 50 BTC, or $1.4 million.\n\nBitcoin whales are investors who hoard huge amounts of Bitcoin (at least 1,000 BTC) and don\u2019t touch it for years, sitting on astronomical gains as a result.\n\nSuch investors have proven to be more successful than traders that buy and sell Bitcoin over a short period: the asset is extremely volatile in the short-term but over the past 10 years it has shot up from under $95 per coin to $29,203\u2014a 30,700% increase.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhales have certainly been on the move this year. Blockchain data firm Glassnode said in a Monday report that there has been a \u201cdramatic uptick over recent months,\u201d and noted that a number of whales have been moving holdings to exchanges\u2014usually the best way to cash out, or shift holdings to other digital assets.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear whether these whales are individuals or companies, but Dr. Kirill Kretov, a developer of tools for automated trading and blockchain analyst, previously told Decrypt that it was possible that these transactions represent commercial entities buying the Bitcoin from individuals."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAs the race for the White House heats up, Democratic candidate for U.S. president Robert Kennedy Jr, has come out as a proponent of Bitcoin, and says he has proven that commitment by buying 14 Bitcoin last May.\n\nIn a Wednesday Twitter Spaces interview with crypto investor and podcaster Scott Melker, Kennedy called Bitcoin the currency of freedom, and said he decided to become a crypto investor after he was chided by media outlets for promoting Bitcoin but didn\u2019t own any.\n\n\u201cI bought two Bitcoin for each of my seven children,\u201d Kennedy said, noting he made the move \"right after\" his appearance at the Bitcoin Conference in May. \u201cNow I\u2019m a Bitcoin owner, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll now find a different way to come at me, but no one can say I didn\u2019t put my money where my mouth is.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKennedy and Melker also discussed how banks can shut down customer bank accounts without warning, and suggested political pressure may be behind the closure of the bank account of Joseph Mercola, described by the New York Times as \"the most influential spreader of coronavirus misinformation online.\"\n\nChase bank has shut down our business bank accounts along with the accounts of my CEO and CFO, as well as their family members (including spouse and child). They've refused to provide any reason for doing so, the oldest account has been active for 18 years.\u2026 \u2014 Dr. Joseph Mercola (@mercola) July 25, 2023\n\n\"Here we have a powerful banking interest that that has received all kinds of federal government support and it's utterly dependent on its on its relationship with the Fed and the federal government and it is shutting down one of its customers for political speech,\" Kennedy said. \"I think that incident alone should be one that all of us should be terrified about, and and it makes the the move toward Bitcoin, all the more important.\"\n\nDuring the annual conference held in Miami, Florida, Kennedy said covid-19 restriction led him to Bitcoin, and he claimed to be the first presidential candidate to accept Bitcoin donations through the Lightning Network. But he also said that he didn't own any, and wasn't there to give investment advice.\n\nCurrently, the price of a Bitcoin is $29,330 per coin, according to CoinMarketCap. At the time of his speech at Bitcoin 2023, the price of a Bitcoin stood around $27,128. If Kennedy\u2019s claims are true, the Kennedy Bitcoin treasury would be worth around $400,000 today.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEarlier this month, a financial disclosure document obtained by CNBC showed Kennedy\u2019s Family held (at the time) between $100,000 and $250,000 worth of Bitcoin.\n\nHis conference address established his strong alignment with so-called digital gold.\n\n\u201cWhen I witnessed this cataclysm\u2014this devastating use of government repression\u2014I realized for the first time how free money is as important to freedom as free expression,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\nKennedy added that the many environmental claims about Bitcoin are unfounded.\n\n\u201cI believe that the environmental arguments against Bitcoin are a smokescreen to obscure the real motives for suppressing Bitcoin,\u201d he said, citing the massive cost of endless wars and environmentally destructive projects.\n\nWhile Kennedy is not expected to win the Democratic party's nomination\u2014online wagering sites put his odds at around 11 percent\u2014he has drawn the support of fervent crypto fans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy for the support I\u2019ve gotten from the Bitcoin community,\u201d Kennedy said."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe Bitcoin ETF race is on, and Wall Street behemoths like BlackRock and Fidelity are now battling for the title of first to offer a spot market product. But the winner will end up sharing that title with the partner that helps get it over the finish line.\n\nThat company could be Coinbase.\n\nWhen BlackRock announced it was stepping into the ring with its own spot Bitcoin ETF offering on June 15, it did so together with Coinbase. The $8.5 trillion asset manager designated the San Francisco-based crypto exchange as custodian for the fund\u2019s Bitcoin and later revised its filing to say Coinbase would also provide surveillance-sharing services, which allows the two to share information about trading, clearing activity, and customer identification to reduce the risks of market manipulation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"Coinbase will likely be the go-to exchange in this regard,\" Bob Ras, co-founder of the asset-tokenization firm Sologenic, told Decrypt. \"Clearly, the big players regard Coinbase as a legitimate and critically important institution here.\"\n\nBlackRock wasn\u2019t the only Bitcoin ETF hopeful to turn to Coinbase to help shepherd its application with the SEC along. All five of the spot ETF Bitcoin applicants working with the Chicago Board of Exchange\u2014Fidelity, VanEck, Ark Invest\u2019s 21Shares, Valkyrie, and Invesco\u2014submitted revised applications that named Coinbase their surveillance partner of choice.\n\nThis parade of partnerships comes not long after the Securities and Exchange Commission hit Coinbase with a lawsuit accusing it of operating an unregistered securities exchange and dealing in unregistered securities through its staking service Coinbase Earn. The company rejects the charges, but the lawsuit has left a dark cloud over its head.\n\nYet with BlackRock and others seemingly shrugging off the SEC's charges, the vote of confidence appears to be validating Coinbase's approach to doing business. Several industry insiders told Decrypt that it was at best unclear what impact the SEC\u2019s lawsuit would have on its recent deals, but expressed doubt that the allegations\u2014even if they\u2019re found to be credible\u2014would affect Coinbase\u2019s ability to help launch an ETF.\n\nJoshua Frank, CEO of The Tie, an information service company for digital assets, said that Coinbase took \"a lot of shit\" for exercising a more cautious way of conducting business than some of its peers in recent years. The ETF deals, he said, show that Coinbase's more deliberate approach is paying off.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI have 200 institutional clients, many in [traditional finance], who I speak to everyday, and every single institution I've ever spoken to is comfortable with Coinbase as a partner,\" Frank told Decrypt.\n\nThis confidence has also been good for Coinbase's stock value. On the heels of the BlackRock filing, Coinbase\u2019s stock began to steadily climb from $54 a share before surging ahead to $107 on July 13 after a federal judge ruled favorably against the SEC in its lawsuit against Ripple, finding that its XRP token was not a security except in certain transactions.\n\nThe stock last closed at about $98 a share at the time of writing, still above its place from when the SEC sued Coinbase on June 6.\n\nThis trust factor is also important at a time when more TradFi firms are showing an interest in wading deeper into crypto. Jeffrey Blockinger, the chief legal counsel at decentralized exchange Vertex Protocol, said that contacts in the world of traditional finance have expressed to him an interest in Bitcoin, but often have \"no interest\" in figuring out the technical side of handling their digital assets.\n\nThis is especially relevant given the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX last year. Authorities allege that the company founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, who now faces several criminal charges, mixed customer and corporate funds. The SEC alleged in a lawsuit filed on June 5 against Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world by volume, that it too may be commingling customer funds.\n\nFor its part, Coinbase has said that it works to keep the separation of client and corporate funds intact. In an earlier interview with Decrypt, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal endorsed regulations in crypto to formalize that boundary.\n\nBlockinger said it was unlikely that BlackRock, Fidelity, or the other TradFi giants with their large due diligence teams would be inking deals with Coinbase if they felt their clients\u2019 assets would be at risk. \"They have a lot to lose,\" Blockinger told Decrypt. \"I think that they've gotten themselves comfortable with this institution that they feel they can do business with.\u201d\n\nIt's worth noting, however, that BlackRock invested $24 million in FTX. And for all the enthusiasm felt towards Coinbase between the Ripple decision and ETF deals, the threat of the SEC still looms large in the shadow of the company's recent rally.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMuch of the lift behind Coinbase's stock came from the rally in Bitcoin's price that followed the ETF deals though it has cooled recently. In an analysis included in BlackRock\u2019s ETF filing, Nasdaq estimates that 56% of the $129 billion in U.S.-based Bitcoin trading took place on Coinbase, where Bitcoin to U.S. dollar transactions are its highest volume trading pair, according to CoinGecko.\n\nDespite the spike in optimism from Coinbase after the Ripple decision, analysts at Berenberg Capital Markets caution that the celebration may be premature, and that the SEC\u2019s case posed fundamental problems for it.\n\nUnlike Ripple, Coinbase is being sued for offering unregistered securities through its staking service, something Coinbase is refuting. However, Berenberg analysts caution that the service, which lets users earn interest from Coinbase by staking their tokens, may fall outside the parameters set by the Ripple ruling.\n\nIn a July 17 research note, the Berenberg analysts warn that if the SEC or state regulators succeed in curtailing Coinbase's staking activities, it has the capacity to cut deeply into the company\u2019s financial condition by hitting the trading volumes it relies on so much.\n\nFrank from The Tie offered a broader warning for the industry. Though he praised Coinbase for running a trustworthy business, Frank noted that the market\u2019s reliance on Coinbase to fulfill so many roles \u2014from crypto custodian to exchange\u2014 is an unhealthy place to be. Pointing to the meltdown that followed FTX's collapse, Frank said it would be healthier for the market to grow more players than rely so heavily on any single firm.\n\n\"I think at the end of the day, we need more Coinbases,\" Frank told Decrypt. \"We need more if we want institutions to come on and ramp up for crypto. One isn't sufficient.\""

This means that the demand for charging points that support Bitcoin should follow as well."

        "content": "Image: Shutterstock\n\nFlooring Hut, a well-known British carpet retailer, has boldly invested in Bitcoin and added it to its balance sheet. The company's CEO, Paul Brewster, sees significant potential for capital growth in Bitcoin, drawing inspiration from successful companies like Tesla and MicroStrategy, who have also ventured into crypto investments.The decision to choose Bitcoin as an investment over traditional bank accounts stems from the belief that crypto offers better returns, ultimately benefiting the company's valued customers. Brewster views Bitcoin as a distinct asset class similar to digital gold. While the company and its employees show interest in the broader crypto space, they have yet to make plans to include other cryptos in their balance sheet.The move to invest in Bitcoin is particularly noteworthy within the carpet industry, a sector historically known for its hesitance in adopting technological advancements. By embracing the Bitcoin standard, Flooring Hut stands out as an innovative player in a field that has been traditionally resistant to change.Amidst economic challenges and rising inflation rates in the UK, businesses are exploring alternative ways to preserve the value of their capital. Flooring Hut's proactive approach to financial management is commendable, showcasing its willingness to adapt to a challenging economic environment.Brewster emphasises the company's commitment to reinvesting potential Bitcoin returns into the business, aiming to provide more value to its customers and secure a competitive edge over rivals. The company is also exploring the integration of the Bitcoin Lightning Network as an additional payment option alongside existing methods such as MasterCard, Visa, and PayPal.As the adoption of Bitcoin as a form of payment continues to gain attention in the UK, Flooring Hut's decision is a forward-thinking move, offering both financial benefits and a competitive advantage in the ever-evolving retail landscape. With its investment in Bitcoin, Flooring Hut positions itself at the forefront of an emerging trend, showcasing its readiness to thrive in an evolving financial landscape."

        "content": "It\u2019s time for another myth-dashing. When somebody mentions the now-passe crypto industry, what is the first thing that comes to your mind? Was it Bitcoin? Well, if it was, you have nothing to be ashamed of. That is what most people will say. But would it surprise you that there isn\u2019t any basis for this word being used in conjunction with Bitcoin?\n\nThat\u2019s right. There is no crypto in Bitcoin.\n\nWhen people use the word crypto, they are just using the short form for cryptography, which is the use of tools and codes to create messages that can only be read by the intended recipient. They use this word synonymous with encryption, which is often (incorrectly) quoted as one of the reasons why Bitcoin is secure and immutable.\n\nSadly, this is far from reality, and the reasons for this would weave a rich tapestry of history.\n\nLet\u2019s first go over the main false reasons why the word encryption and crypto became associated with Bitcoin. First, the word encryption or cryptography doesn\u2019t appear anywhere in the Bitcoin white paper. \u201cCryptographic proofs\u201d are mentioned in the white paper, and the difference between these and cryptography is significant.\n\nCryptography, again, is the general use of codes to ensure that a message is only readable by the intended recipient. In other words, used to pass secret messages around on a public channel. This word is commonly used synonymously with encryption/decryption of messages. It is concerned with sending and receiving secret messages.\n\nCryptographic proof, however, is the act of using cryptographic primitive functions in order to generate irrefutable public proof that a specific sender sent a message. The message itself is public, and the identity of the sender of the message is verified.\n\nIn a way, one is the opposite of the other. While one concerns itself with keeping secret messages, the other concerns itself with the public attestation of messages.\n\nHowever, because the terms share the same root prefix of \u201ccrypto,\u201d the term, which may have initially been incorrectly used, somehow stuck. Rest assured, there is no encryption in Bitcoin. Nothing is encrypted, and there are no secrets. In fact, its security model depends on full transparency in all transactions1 rather than keeping secrets.\n\nThe white paper was first published on the cryptography mailing list.\n\nThis is another possible source of the mis-association because the original Bitcoin White Paper was put into this forum, where the participants included many forefront experts in the field of cryptography. The assumption was that Bitcoin must have been a continuation of previous attempts at electronic cash projects (such as David Chaum\u2019s ecash), which did use encryption as part of their system.\n\nPublic and Private keys are used\n\nAsymmetric public key cryptography is another possible reason. ECDSA, which stands for Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, uses the same mathematical primitives as ECC (elliptic curve cryptography) and, as such, also uses an asymmetric key pair of public and private keys. This is synonymous with other cryptography algorithms which use a public key to encrypt messages and a private key to decrypt them.\n\nHowever, these keys are not used to encrypt or decrypt anything. They are used to verify publicly that the signer of a transaction moving a coin is the correct person, as specified by the previous sender. In other words, if Alice sent a coin to Bob, then Bitcoin uses ECDSA to ensure that when Bob further signs and sends the coin to Charlie, that Bob is indeed the only one able to create this signature. This prevents someone else from spending Bob\u2019s coins, and it also ensures that whoever Bob sends the coins to can only be moved by that recipient.\n\nIndeed, locking coins to a specific public key to which the owner of the associated private key can be the sole controller is just one of the many ways a coin can be locked. It is certainly not mandatory. Coins can be locked to multiple keys, making it effectively a shared account, or even locked to something not key-related at all, instead locking the coins to a certain locking script2. All of these are fancy Bitcoin applications that have only recently begun to be explored3.\n\nSo, why, then, if there is no mention of crypto or encryption in the white paper, no use of cryptography, or encryption in the protocol, do many people believe that Bitcoin is secured by encryption? Or why is Bitcoin called a crypto-currency?\n\nWell, the term crypto-currency predates Bitcoin. In fact, as mentioned, previous attempts at electronic cash were called crypto-currencies, and they indeed featured encryption as a way to hide the amounts being sent as a form of privacy protection. This name just sort of stuck around because Bitcoin seemed like just \u2018another of the bunch.\u2019\n\nThe other, more nefarious reason is that many of the Bitcoin \u2018OGs\u2019 have a lot riding on Bitcoin and its price appreciation, and they realize that having Bitcoin associated with encryption and cryptography is a way to make it seem that it can be used to hide your transactions away from prying eyes or government scrutiny. After all, if newcomer \u2018whales\u2019 with heaps of illegitimate funds knew that every transaction that they ever make would be forever recorded and scrutable by authorities, they would very likely not be interested in using Bitcoin, instead preferring the tried and true method of shadow banks, money mules, and Rolex dealers. So there is an incentive for those who know better to keep tight-lipped if opening it means threatening price depreciation of your retirement slush fund. If you know any self-proclaimed OGs, ask them where the encryption is in Bitcoin and see what they say.\n\nBitcoin is a transparent system with a security model based on transparency. Because nodes (miners) are public, and they rely on their blocks being accepted by their competitors, keeping honest is the economic \u2018best move\u2019. When everything that you do needs to be confirmed by your peers, lest they reject your blocks, wasting your work, nodes tend to act honestly and according to the rules. Any and all rules can be enforced using this model. Importantly, this model does not rely on keeping any secrets at all.\n\nSo next time you talk to a Bitcoin supporter, who calls it \u2018crypto,\u2019 tell them there is no encryption or secrets at all in Bitcoin, and that is exactly what makes it work, where all other previous attempts at electronic cash failed.\n\nJerry Chan\n\nWall Street Technologist\n\nNOTES:\n\n[1] This is how miners can detect when another node is being dishonest and can vote to ignore their proof of work and reject their blocks. The threat of peer boycott of mining node blocks is what keeps all the mining nodes in line. Not social consensus or even developers.\n\n[2] Bitcoin contains an internal script language, a derivative of FORTH, which can be used to program custom locking scripts in order to program the spendability of coins.\n\n[3] Mostly by projects in BSV blockchain such as STAS and SCrypt\n\nCoinGeek Conversations with Owen Vaughan: Using modern advances in cryptography to enhance data privacy\n\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

In this article, we\u2019ll explore some tips on how to effectively explain about crypto to your loved ones and help them understand this exciting new world of digital assets.\n\nStart with the Basics\n\nBefore diving into technical jargon and complex concepts, begin by explaining the foundational principles. Define what a cryptocurrency is.

Here are some things to use to explain:\n\nUse Analogies\n\nAnalogies can be powerful tools for simplifying complex ideas. You can compare cryptocurrencies to concepts your family and friends are already familiar with. For instance, you can liken blockchain to a digital ledger, where all transactions are recorded in a transparent and immutable manner, similar to a shared Google Doc that everyone can see and verify.\n\nHighlight the Benefits\n\nYou can also mention advantages like fast and low-cost cross-border transactions, financial inclusion for the unbanked, and the potential for decentralized finance (DeFi) to provide financial services without intermediaries.\n\nAddress Concerns\n\nAcknowledging common concerns and misconceptions about cryptocurrencies is essential.

Mention how some businesses accept cryptocurrencies as payment, how individuals can send money globally without exorbitant fees, or how blockchain technology is being implemented in supply chain management.\n\nExplain the Role of Mining\n\nThe concept of mining can be baffling for newcomers. Offer a simplified explanation that mining involves computers solving complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. This process ensures the security and integrity of the network.\n\nDiscuss Different Cryptocurrencies\n\nIntroduce the idea that there are thousands of altcoins, each serving different purposes. Mention well-known ones like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple, and explain their unique characteristics, use cases, and strengths.\n\nEmphasize the Importance of Security\n\nEducate your family and friends about the significance of securing their cryptocurrency holdings.

        "title": "Crypto news: Bulgaria holds more Bitcoin than the United States - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Breaking News: Bulgaria turns out to hold a Bitcoin balance of more than 200,000, even surpassing the share held by the United States.\n\nThe Bulgarian government is playing its trump card to become one of the most economically established countries in the world, hoping that its $6 billion countervalue in cryptocurrency can multiply in the future.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the details of the news together.\n\nCrypto news: Bulgaria\u2019s balance of more than 200,000 Bitcoin\n\nThe latest crypto news talks about Bulgaria and the incredible discovery of a balance of more than 200,000 Bitcoin, with a countervalue of about $6.3 billion\n\nThe huge sum was acquired by the Balkan country through a cyber seizure that took place in May 2017.\n\nSpecifically,from an investigation called \u201cPRATKA/VIRUS,\u201d Bulgarian authorities were able to stop a criminal group organized in the infiltration of viruses into the country\u2019s customs computer systems.\n\nFrom the 28 arrests made there, a large amount of cash, computers, communications devices, tablets, and various equipment were confiscated, as well as a staggering 213,519 BTC, or about 1% of the currency\u2019s circulating supply\n\nThe criminal gang used cryptocurrency because of its anonymity component and the simplicity with which they could transfer value from one area of the continent to another, without incurring transportation risks.\n\nThe sum at the time was worth \u201conly\u201d $500 million but has now reached a significantly higher countervalue.\n\nIt is still unclear how Bulgarian law enforcement managed to seize the massive BTC stack, but some rumors in recent days claim that all the loot is still jealousy held by the country.\n\nIf that were the case, Bulgaria would rank hands down first as the state with the most Bitcoin in its possession, topping the US, which enjoys assets of 194,188 units of digital gold.\n\nIn this case too, the amount held by the US is the result of raids on cybercrimes: these include the cases of hacker James Zhong, the cyber heist of Bitfinex and the seizure of the Silk Road darknet marketplace.\n\nThe US government would have actually still been the world\u2019s leading entity in terms of Bitcoin holdings, were it not for the fact that in March 2023 it sold a part of it on Coinbase and through special institutional auctions.\n\nBulgaria\u2019s cryptographic future\n\nAfter the latest crypto news related to the discovery of Bulgaria\u2019s Bitcoin balances, we can go out on a limb and say that the Eastern European country may enjoy a rosy future in the coming years.\n\nIf the predictions of experts on the future price of Bitcoin turn out to be right, such as that of the consulting firm Fundstrat Global Advisors, which predicts a price of $200,000 by 2028, then Bulgaria may indeed have hit the jackpot.\n\nAt those figures, the country\u2019s cryptocurrency countervalue would amount to $42.6 billion, about half of Bulgaria\u2019s GDP according to 2021 figures, or three times the national debt according to 2019 figures.\n\nAt the moment, at current prices, the government would not be able to pay off even half of the liabilities it has on account.\n\nHence, the idea of Bulgarian heads of state preferring to hold the cryptocurrency in order to hopefully generate a condition of widespread wealth for the whole country rather than cover some patches today remains quite agreeable.\n\nThat said, the government should still look for less risky solutions in order to improve its economic fate, such as supporting the development of crypto- and blockchain-themed businesses, as is the case in Germany, Britain, Switzerland, and Portugal.\n\nThe future price of Bitcoin is very uncertain, and it may take longer than usual for the cryptocurrency to reach $200,000, hence it is always good to have an alternative plan that can exploit the potential of new technologies.\n\nThe Bitcoin standard and new decentralized infrastructures are spreading at a faster rate around the world than Bulgaria, with news reports of increasingly disruptive adoption, especially in less developed countries.\n\nHence, even with a fortune behind it, the Balkan country may be paying the price for lacking long-term foresight and taking a passive approach to technology development, losing out on several tens of billions of dollars in future profits."

        "title": "Google Bard predicts what will be Bitcoin price after 2024 halving - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Shortly after OpenAI launched its text-based artificial intelligence (AI) tool ChatGPT, the technology saw renewed interest, leading to the rise of other generative AI bots, particularly Google\u2019s Bard, which has already demonstrated its value in the cryptocurrency market analysis, including that of Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIndeed, as the price of Bitcoin continues to move sideways after losing the $30,000 level, Finbold sought Bard\u2019s input on the future of the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset after its halving in 2024, from a standpoint as of July 25.\n\nFactors playing a role\n\nAs it happens, Bard delivered a detailed reply, highlighting that \u201cthere are a number of factors that suggest that the price could reach new highs,\u201d including the upcoming halving event itself, increased global adoption of Bitcoin, and favorable regulatory frameworks around the world.\n\nBitcoin analysis. Source: Google Bard\n\nOn the other hand, Bard singled out the factors that could hamper Bitcoin\u2019s gains after the halving, particularly the possibility of a bear market following the halving, as well as the rise of competing crypto assets that could pose a threat to its dominance.\n\nBitcoin price prediction\n\nIn terms of specific numbers, Bard has listed Bitcoin price predictions from several different sources, including the stock-to-flow (S2F) model by crypto analyst PlanB, which has set the price of the maiden cryptocurrency at $100,000 by 2024.\n\nFurthermore, the second prediction, by British multinational bank Standard Chartered, projects Bitcoin to reach $120,000 by 2024, whereas India\u2019s oldest cryptocurrency exchange, ZebPay, is not as bullish, setting the price of the largest crypto by market capitalization at $40,000 by 2024.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin was at press time changing hands at the price of $29,125, which represents a decline of 2.33% in the last 24 hours, a 2.97% loss across the previous seven days, adding up to the 5.20% drop on its monthly chart, as per the latest information.\n\nBitcoin 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin is facing the strongest support at the price of $27,583, whereas its resistance rests on the $31,010 level. Whether it can truly reach one of the price thresholds predicted above will depend on the various listed factors playing together.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Although Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading sideways for the larger part of the previous week, zooming out on its chart demonstrates that the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset has been moving in a familiar pre-halving pattern, giving a general idea of when to expect the next all-time high (ATH).\n\nIndeed, Bitcoin is currently imitating the chart patterns from its previous pre-halving periods that preceded a massive bullish price rally for the maiden cryptocurrency, as observed by the pseudonymous crypto market analyst Stockmoney Lizards in a tweet shared on July 25.\n\nBitcoin pre-halving behavior analysis. Source: Stockmoney Lizards\n\nSpecifically, Bitcoin\u2019s behavior in 2023, including the recent price action, is reminiscent of the largest crypto asset\u2019s activities preceding the halving in 2016 and 2020, and the current trend suggests it will begin its stronger upward movement by the end of the pre-halving period, i.e., with the halving around May 2024.\n\nEarlier, the crypto trading expert pointed out that this could lead to a new record for Bitcoin, culminating with an ATH in 2025, somewhere in the areas of $110,000 and beyond, with its current price level acting as a base for this jump, as per the chart pattern analysis published in a tweet on July 25.\n\nBitcoin pre-halving and ATH chart. Source: Stockmoney Lizards\n\nInterestingly, the analyst\u2019s projections are in line with those shared by Google\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) tool, Bard, particularly those by the stock-to-flow (S2F) model by crypto expert PlanB and British multinational bank Standard Chartered, which have set the price of Bitcoin at $100,000 and $120,000 in 2024, respectively.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin was at press time changing hands at the price of $29,215, indicating a gain of 0.21% on the day, a 2.73% decline in the last week, and a drop of 3.90% over the previous month, according to the latest information retrieved on July 26.\n\nBitcoin 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAs Finbold reported in late May, Bitcoin has entered the final phase before its fourth halving, when the current reward for mining the proof-of-work (PoW) asset will cut in half \u2013 a major event that has historically demonstrated the power to move Bitcoin\u2019s price upward.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
