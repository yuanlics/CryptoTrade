        "title": "Theft of Bitcoin that topped $3 billion in value leads to one-year prison sentence for James Zhong: \u2018I always knew what I did was wrong\u2019 - Fortune",
        "content": "A Georgia man who stole more than 50,000 Bitcoin from the Silk Road drug-trafficking site before his cache hit $3.35 billion in value was ordered to serve a year and a day in prison.\n\nJames Zhong, 32, was sentenced Friday in New York federal court, where he pleaded guilty to wire fraud last year. At the time of the heist in 2012, the Bitcoin was worth $620,000. When authorities seized devices holding the stolen Bitcoin in November 2021, its value had exploded, making it the second-largest financial seizure in US history.\n\nBefore he was caught, Zhong spent $16 million of the proceeds on real estate investments, luxury hotels, nightclubs and Lamborghinis, prosecutors said. The value of the Bitcoin seized is now about $1.56 billion.\n\nUS District Judge Paul Gardephe cited the \u201chighly sophisticated nature of the crime\u201d and Zhong\u2019s active concealment of the stolen Bitcoin for nine years until agents raided his house. Zhong faced between 27 and 33 months in prison under advisory guidelines, but Gardephe said he was granting leniency because of the \u201ctruly unique circumstances\u201d in the case. Still, the judge said he also wanted to deter other criminals.\n\n\u201cWhile the victim in this case happened to be a criminal enterprise, the victim tomorrow could be a legitimate business,\u201d Gardephe said.\n\nProsecutors told the judge that Zhong should get prison because he covered up his theft for nearly a decade, moving the Bitcoin through so-called mixers that make it harder to trace transactions by jumbling tokens together. But they also said he should get less than two years in prison, citing his youth, his autism and his help in recovering the stolen crypto.\n\nSolace in Computer\n\nZhong\u2019s lawyers asked the judge to spare him a prison term, saying he came from a dysfunctional family and received no love from his divorced parents, who were Chinese immigrants. He was \u201cseverely bullied and victimized by his peers because he was different \u2014 he was extremely shy, overweight, and most significantly, suffered from undiagnosed autism spectrum disorder,\u201d Zhong\u2019s lawyers said in court papers. \u201cHaving no friends or family he could turn to, Jimmy found solace and friendship in the world of his computer.\u201d\n\nIn court, Zhong expressed \u201cshame and remorse,\u201d and told the judge, \u201cI always knew what I did was wrong.\u201d\n\nHe said he hid his crimes as Bitcoin soared in value.\n\n\u201cI think I buried my head in the sand,\u201d Zhong said. \u201cIt made me feel important and worth something.\u201d\n\nZhong said that while some college friends have stuck by him, the one who\u2019s been most supportive is his dog Chad, who is old and sick.\n\nIn their sentencing memo, Zhong\u2019s lawyers argued that while he had no right to the stolen Bitcoin, neither did Silk Road. They said the marketplace isn\u2019t a victim \u201cin the true sense of the word\u201d under the law, noting that Silk Road\u2019s imprisoned founder, Ross Ulbricht, contacted Zhong and asked him how he took the cryptocurrency. But he never asked for it back \u2014 and sent more.\n\nAfter pleading guilty, Zhong agreed to forfeit $42.7 million as well as additional Bitcoin and property.\n\nThe heist began after Zhong had stored some Bitcoin on Silk Road, the online black market. When he double-clicked the withdrawal button by mistake, he got back twice as much as he put in. Over several days, he deposited more tokens and quickly withdrew them, double-clicking each time. Exploiting that glitch led him to more than 50,000 Bitcoin, each worth about $12 at the time.\n\nFederal agents seized 50,491 Bitcoin from Zhong\u2019s lakefront home in Gainesville, Georgia, along with $661,900 in cash and gold and silver bars. Zhong stored the crypto on devices in a safe under floorboards and on a single-board computer stowed in a Cheetos popcorn tin in a closet. He later surrendered more than 1,000 additional Bitcoin.\n\nZhong attended the University of Georgia from 2008 to 2014, earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science and mining Bitcoin. He also drank excessively and used cocaine, according to a psychiatric examination report in his court file.\n\nHe converted some Bitcoin to $700,000 in cash, so he would have a \u201ccase full of money like in the movies,\u201d the report said. \u201cHe hoped the visual appeal of the cash would impress a female into having sexual relations with him,\u201d the report said. \u201cHe stated his plan did not work.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, Zhong reported a burglary at his home his Athens, Georgia, saying someone had stolen a silver brief case with $400,000 in cash.\n\nThe case is USA v. James Zhong, 22-cr-00606, US District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan)."

In other words, the Elon Musk-owned electric carmaker would have made an additional $500 million if it had waited until today to sell.\n\nAre Tesla\u2019s Bitcoin trades profitable?\n\nTesla infamously dumped nearly $936 million of its total Bitcoin holdings in Q2 2022, accounting for 75% of its remaining reserves, to secure $64 million in profit. At the time, Bitcoin was trading about 70% lower than its record high of $69,000 in November 2021.\n\nBTC/USD monthly price chart featuring Tesla\u2019s Bitcoin sales purchases and sales. Source: TradingView\n\nOriginally, Tesla purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin in February 2021 at an average price of $36,000. The company then sold BTC worth $272 million to boost its Q1 2021 accounting by $101 million.\n\nThe company has nevertheless held on to its remaining BTC as of Q4 2022 despite the price of Bitcoin sitting at bear-market lows of around $16,000 at the time. Today, Tesla holds 10,725 BTC worth around $330 million, almost 15% below the procurement value from February 2021.\n\nOverall, Tesla made roughly $165 million in profit from two separate Bitcoin sales. As of April 14, it sits atop an unrealized loss of around $56.6 million on its remaining BTC holdings, while its net profit to date sits at around $108 million.\n\nWill Tesla dump its remaining BTC holdings?\n\nInterestingly, Tesla\u2019s previous Bitcoin sales came from weaker free cash flows. For instance, the Q1 2021\u2019s BTC sale worth $272 million made up nearly 93% of Tesla\u2019s free cash flows in the same quarter.\n\nTesla free cash flows performance by quarter. Source: Statista\n\nSimilarly, Tesla\u2019s Bitcoin sales in Q2 2022 came as its free cash flows declined 73% versus the previous quarter. Both sales suggest that Musk relied on Bitcoin as a haven during Tesla\u2019s cash crunch phases.\n\nThe Tesla CEO explained at the time that the sale was made to \u201cprove liquidity of Bitcoin as an alternative to holding cash on a balance sheet.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Wall Street analysts estimate that Tesla\u2019s free cash flow in Q1 2023 could be nearly $2 billion, up 40% versus the previous quarter. This should reduce the chances of Tesla dumping any significant Bitcoin amount in the near term.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin in Senegal: Why is this African country using BTC?\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin moved higher in the US$30,000 band in Friday morning trading in Asia amid strong gains among the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies. Ethereum led the winners following the blockchain\u2019s Shanghai hard fork this week, jumping almost 10% and breaching the US$2,000 mark for the first time since August 2022. U.S. equities rallied overnight on softer readings in the U.S. producer price index (PPI) and jobless claims, adding to optimism the Federal Reserve could soon end its year-long cycle of raising interest rates to curb inflation.\n\nSee related article: Musk\u2019s Twitter partners with eToro to offer crypto and stocks to users\n\nFast facts\n\nBitcoin rose 2.54% to US$30,769 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong to post a weekly gain of 9.47%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The leading cryptocurrency has gained 83% so far this year as it seemed to rediscover a role as a hedge against inflation and recession and looks set to test US$31,000 as it moved within a couple of hundred dollars of that ceiling in later morning trading in Asia.\n\nBitcoin also found support after the London Stock Exchange Group plc. on Thursday said it had partnered with GFO-X \u2013 the UK\u2019s first regulated and centrally cleared trading venue for digital asset derivatives \u2013 to provide the country\u2019s first trading and clearing services for Bitcoin index derivatives, according to Reuters on Friday.\n\nEthereum jumped 9.97% to US$2,100, adding 11.66% for the week after the network\u2019s Shanghai upgrade, which allows investors to withdraw their staked Ether for the first time. Etheruem holders have so far withdrawn around 215,000 staked Ether, while another 961,000 withdrawals are pending, according to data from Token Unlocks, which accounts for about 6% of the total staked Ether.\n\nEarlier speculation that the Shanghai upgrade may lead to a flood of selling and depress the price of the token isn\u2019t panning out, Chen Zhuling, co-founder and CEO of crypto staking platform RockX, said in an interview on Thursday. Even if Ether are unstaked, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that people are going to sell them, because they could also use it for other DeFi investments, he said.\n\nDogecoin jumped 6.25% to US$0.0885 to hold a weekly gain of 2.79%, after multi asset trading platform eToro announced on Thursday a partnership with Elon Musk\u2019s Twitter to enable cryptocurrency and stock trading on the world\u2019s leading social media platform.\n\nCardano rose 4.54% to US$0.4264, moving up 11.00% for the week. Cardano Foundation launched the alpha phase of Aiken on Thursday, an open-source smart contract language and toolchain that aims to simplify smart contract developments on the Cardano blockchain, according to the company.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization rose 3.85% in the past 24 hours to US$1.28 trillion. The total trading volume over the last 24 hours edged down 0.05% to US$48.58 billion.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index added 0.82% to 4,017.62 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, moving up 0.32% for the week. The index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts on any given day. It is managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nU.S. equities closed higher on Thursday after economic data pointed to a slowdown in inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.14%, the S&P 500 moved up 1.33%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.99%.\n\nU.S. PPI in March rose but at a 2.7% pace, or lower than the expected 3% to mark the smallest increase since January 2021, according to Reuters on Thursday. U.S. weekly jobless claims also pointed to a slowing economy with the figure of 239,000, higher than analysts\u2019 expectation of 235,000, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nInvestor sentiment also got a lift from an unexpected surge in China exports in March, which jumped 14.8% from last year, well beyond the expectation of a 7% decrease, according to Reuters.\n\nU.S. interest rates are currently between 4.75% to 5%, the highest since June 2006, and analysts at the CME Group now see a 33.5% chance the Fed will not raise interest rates at its next meeting on May 3, while 66.5% predict a 25-basis-point rate hike, down from 70.4% on Thursday.\n\nU.S. stock futures traded mixed as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.09%. The S&P 500 futures gained 0.05%.

        "title": "Michael Saylor Buys Another $150 Million in Bitcoin: Is the Crypto a Screaming Buy? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The crypto markets had a rough 2022, and Bitcoin (BTC 0.02%) wasn't spared -- the cryptocurrency fell nearly 65% last year. But 2023 has become a comeback story, with Bitcoin up 83% since January.\n\nBitcoin mega-supporter and MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor recently revealed that his company bought 6,455 Bitcoin in late March, a transaction worth $150 million.\n\nShould investors follow Saylor's lead? One shouldn't base their investment decisions on someone else's, but there are some excellent reasons to consider adding Bitcoin to your portfolio today. Here is what you need to know.\n\nA hefty vote of confidence\n\nAlthough investors should make their own decisions, there's no denying the influence that well-known investors such as Warren Buffett can have on a stock's sentiment. Saylor is arguably the Buffett equivalent to Bitcoin investors, and his latest $150 million investment is a vote of confidence if anything.\n\nMicroStrategy now owns 138,955 total Bitcoin worth almost $4.2 billion. The company's average Bitcoin cost is $29,817, just a bit below where it trades today. In other words, you could argue that Saylor sees value in Bitcoin at its current price; a $4 billion investment would imply an expectation that the asset's value will increase over time.\n\nHowever, one shouldn't automatically mirror Saylor's sentiment on Bitcoin, just as one shouldn't blindly buy Coca-Cola stock just because Buffett owns it. Instead, look at it as a prompt to revisit your investment thesis.\n\nRevisiting Bitcoin's investment case\n\nThe overarching theme for Bitcoin is that it's a store of value, similar to gold or silver. Ideally, Bitcoin can protect investors from two critical problems of the fiat-based financial system. First, Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million coins, a hedge against inflation that continually devalues fiat currency as more is created. Second, it's decentralized, independent of central control like the U.S. financial system, which is dominated by the Federal Reserve.\n\nAdditionally, banks use a fractional reserve system, where they leverage their deposits to lend more money than they have. That's fine until too many people try to pull their money out of the banks at once. Bitcoin's scarcity and independence from any person or party controlling it have driven demand and fantastic investment returns. Bitcoin has easily outpaced the S&P 500 despite the coin's dramatic decline in 2022.\n\nSome might ask whether Bitcoin's volatility disqualifies it as a store of value, but Bitcoin doesn't seem any more volatile than silver and gold. You can see below that gold and silver have experienced similar declines from their highs, a reminder that asset prices fluctuate.\n\nYes, Bitcoin has been more volatile than gold, but it's a less-known commodity than a precious metal that has been sought after and valued for thousands of years. Perhaps Bitcoin will become less volatile as it ages -- it's a fair question, at the least.\n\nIs Bitcoin's comeback just beginning?\n\nFor now, markets seem to value Bitcoin as a riskier asset, which declines when investors flee to safety. Gold is near its all-time high, while Bitcoin is far from it. Bitcoin's early 2023 comeback could signal that the crypto winter, as some call it, is nearing its end.\n\nInvestors will only know for sure in hindsight, but it appears Bitcoin's long-term appeal is still intact, especially after the near-miss of another crisis in the modern banking system. Bitcoin will likely remain a volatile asset, but it could have more up days than down if the market's sentiment toward riskier assets turns positive."

        "title": "Bitcoin Halving 2024: Will it Trigger the Next Bull Run? - AlexaBlockchain",
        "content": "The Bitcoin halving is an event that takes place approximately every four years, reducing the rewards given to miners for verifying transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain. The upcoming Bitcoin halving, scheduled for late April 2024, is expected to create a scarcity effect that drives up demand and price, but the exact impact on the Bitcoin price remains uncertain.\n\nAccording to Mete Umut Elmas, Head of MENA Business Development at KuCoin, the halving could be the catalyst for the next Bitcoin price bull run. However, investors should always conduct their own research and consult with financial experts before making any investment decisions.\n\nSpeaking at the Istanbul Fintech Week 2023, Elmas shared his expertise and insights on the crypto market and blockchain industry trends. He highlighted the differences between the current bear market and the one that followed the ICO boom in 2017, stating that the current market cycles are natural and that the industry is finally getting an opportunity for consolidation and the development of practical, value-driven applications that will ultimately drive adoption.\n\nElmas also discussed how the current market conditions are leading to measures aimed at protecting users, promoting informed crypto and blockchain-based use cases, and driving increased institutional investment, which is expanding our understanding of the crypto economy as an alternative asset and fostering confidence in the market.\n\nBitcoin Halving\n\nBitcoin halving refers to the process in which the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks is reduced by half. This occurs approximately every four years and is programmed into the Bitcoin protocol as a way to control the supply of Bitcoin and prevent inflation.\n\nThe first Bitcoin halving occurred in 2012, when the block reward was reduced from 50 BTC to 25 BTC. The second halving occurred in 2016, when the block reward was reduced from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC. The most recent halving occurred in May 2020, when the block reward was reduced from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC.\n\nThe block reward for Bitcoin is set to decrease to 3.125 during the next halving event, which is expected to take place in April or May 2024.\n\nThe halving has a significant impact on the Bitcoin ecosystem as it reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins are created, leading to a lower supply of newly minted coins. This reduction in supply can lead to an increase in demand and potentially drive up the price of Bitcoin, although this is not guaranteed. It also makes mining less profitable for miners, who must now compete for a smaller reward.\n\nHistorical Timelines of Bitcoin halving and its impact on prices\n\nFirst Bitcoin Halving \u2013 November 28, 2012\n\nThe first Bitcoin halving occurred on November 28, 2012, when the block reward was reduced from 50 BTC to 25 BTC. At the time, the price of Bitcoin was around $12.35. After the halving, the price of Bitcoin experienced a steady increase and reached an all-time high of $1,242 in November 2013, over 100 times the pre-halving price.\n\nSecond Bitcoin Halving \u2013 July 9, 2016\n\nThe second Bitcoin halving occurred on July 9, 2016, when the block reward was reduced from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC. At the time, the price of Bitcoin was around $650. After the halving, the price of Bitcoin saw a gradual increase and reached an all-time high of $19,106 in December 2017.\n\nThird Bitcoin Halving \u2013 May 11, 2020\n\nThe most recent Bitcoin halving occurred on May 11, 2020, when the block reward was reduced from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC. At the time, the price of Bitcoin was around $8,500. After the halving, the price of Bitcoin initially saw a slight dip, but then experienced a steady increase and reached an all-time high of over $64,000 in April 2021.\n\nIt is important to note that while the halving has been associated with price increases in the past, it is not a guarantee that the price of Bitcoin will increase after each halving. The price of Bitcoin is influenced by many factors, including supply and demand, market sentiment, and regulatory developments.\n\nRead Also: Bitcoin Tops $23,000; Here\u2019s What Experts Say On The Possibility Of A Bullish Reversal Trend In 2023"

        "content": "Prosecutors have secured another prison term in connection with the infamous darknet marketplace Silk Road, though this time the person serving a sentence was convicted of stealing from the website.\n\nJames Zhong, 32, of Gainesville, Ga., stole over 50,000 bitcoin from the Ross Ulbricht-run marketplace by using nine accounts to create rapid transactions that tricked the illicit marketplace\u2019s withdrawal processing system. He pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud and was sentenced to one year and one day in prison.\n\nThe incidents occurred between 2011 and 2013, when bitcoin held far less value. The original cryptocurrency ended 2013 at less than $800 per coin, far less than its current market price of approximately $30,000. Authorities raided Zhong\u2019s home on Nov. 9, 2021, close to the time when bitcoin reached its highest ever value of nearly $69,000. Zhong became a multibillionaire due to the market appreciation.\n\nAt the time federal authorities took control of the bitcoin, both in the initial seizure and two voluntary forfeitures after Zhong\u2019s arrest, the tokens in total were worth $3.4 billion. They were still worth over $1.57 billion at the time of his sentencing.\n\nSilk Road's flaw\n\nIn one instance Zhong deposited 500 bitcoin into a wallet and within five seconds executed five withdrawals, exploiting a flaw in Silk Road\u2019s payment system that turned his initial deposit into 2,500 bitcoin, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nZhong also received over 50,000 in bitcoin cash following the 2017 hard fork split between bitcoin and bitcoin cash\u2019s blockchains.\n\nFederal law enforcement recovered the nearly 50,500 bitcoin from a single-board computer hidden under blankets in a Cheetos popcorn tin stored in a bathroom closet, according to a Justice Department release announcing Zhong\u2019s sentencing.\n\nIn addition to that bitcoin, law enforcement also seized nearly $662,000 in cash and 25 Casascius coins, physical metal coins created to represent bitcoin that also contained private keys to control actual bitcoin. Those physical representations held value totaling approximately 174 bitcoin.\n\nZhong\u2019s over 50,000 bitcoin, 25 Casascius coins, several physical metal bars, cash, and an investment in a real estate holding company are now property of the United States."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied over 10% between April 9 and April 14, marking the highest daily close in over 10 months. While some analysts may argue the move justifies a degree of decoupling from traditional markets, both the S&P 500 and gold are near their highest levels in over six months.\n\nBitcoin price breaks $30,000 despite macro headwinds\n\nBitcoin\u2019s gains and rally above $30,000 also happened while the U.S. Dollar Index (DYX), which measures the currency against a basket of foreign exchanges, reached its lowest level in 12 months.\n\nThe indicator fell to 100.8 on April 14 from 104.7 one month prior as investors priced in higher odds of further liquidity injections by the United States Federal Reserve.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price teases $30K breakdown ahead of US CPI, FOMC minutes\n\nThe latest Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy meeting minutes, released on April 12, made explicit reference to the anticipation of a \u201cmild recession\u201d later in 2023 due to the banking crisis. Even if inflation is no longer a primary concern, the monetary authority has little room to raise interest rates further without escalating an economic crisis.\n\nEven if inflation is no longer a primary concern, the monetary authority has little room to raise interest rates further without escalating an economic crisis.\n\nStrong macroeconomic data explains investors\u2019 bullishness\n\nWhile the global economy may deteriorate in the coming months, recent macroeconomic data has been mostly positive. For example, the European Union\u2019s statistics office reported that industrial production in the 20 member countries increased 1.5% month on month in February, whereas economists polled by Reuters expected a 1% increase.\n\nFurthermore, China\u2019s latest macroeconomic data showed an encouraging trend, with exports increasing 14.8% year on year in March, snapping a five-month decline and surprising economists who expected a 7% decline. As a result, China\u2019s trade balance for March was $89.2 billion, far exceeding the $39.2 billion market consensus.\n\nThe contrast between the current economic momentum and the forthcoming recession triggered by higher financing costs and a reduced appetite for risk among lenders causes Bitcoin investors to question the sustainability of the $30,000 support.\n\nLet\u2019s look at Bitcoin derivatives metrics to better understand how professional traders are positioned in the current market environment.\n\nBTC derivatives show no excessive leverage from longs\n\nMargin markets provide insight into how professional traders are positioned because they allow investors to borrow cryptocurrency to leverage their positions.\n\nOKX, for instance, provides a margin lending indicator based on the stablecoin/BTC ratio. Traders can increase exposure by borrowing stablecoins to buy Bitcoin. On the other hand, Bitcoin borrowers can only bet on the decline of a cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nOKX stablecoin/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nThe above chart shows that OKX traders\u2019 margin lending ratio decreased between April 9 and April 11. That is extremely healthy as it shows no leverage has been used to support Bitcoin\u2019s price gains, at least not using margin markets. Moreover, given the general bullishness of crypto traders, the current margin lending ratio of 15 is relatively neutral.\n\nThe long-to-short metric excludes externalities that might have solely impacted the margin markets. In addition, it gathers data from exchange clients\u2019 positions on the spot, perpetual and quarterly futures contracts, thus offering better information on how professional traders are positioned.\n\nThere are occasional methodological discrepancies between different exchanges, so readers should monitor changes instead of absolute figures.\n\nExchanges\u2019 top traders Bitcoin long-to-short ratio. Source: Coinglass\n\nInterestingly, despite Bitcoin breaking $30,000 for the first time in 10 months, pro traders have kept their leverage long positions unchanged, according to the long-to-short indicator.\n\nFor instance, the ratio for Huobi traders stood firm near 0.98 from April 9 until April 14. Meanwhile, at crypto exchange Binance, the long-to-short slightly increased, favoring longs, moving from 1.12 on April 9 to the current 1.14. Lastly, at crypto exchange OKX, the long-to-short ratio slightly declined, from 1.00 on April 9 to the current 0.91.\n\nRelated: Tesla selling Bitcoin last year turned out to be a $500M mistake\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin futures traders were not confident enough to add leveraged bullish positions. Thus, even if Bitcoin\u2019s price retests $29,000 in terms of derivatives, bulls should be unconcerned because there has been little demand from short-sellers and no excessive leverage from buyers.\n\nIn other words, Bitcoin\u2019s market structure is bullish, where BTC\u2019s price can quickly rally another 10% to $33,000, given sellers are currently reluctant to short it.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

The video explains how the U.S.\u2019s record-low unemployment rate could be hiding a bigger issue caused by inflation.\n\nPechman explains that the S&P 500 being only 13% below its all-time high has been driven by investors moving away from fixed income and why inflation is no longer a primary concern. Finally, there\u2019s the link between the banking crisis, a weaker U.S. dollar and Bitcoin\u2019s recent rally above $30,000.\n\nThe next segment of Macro Markets focuses on the bank\u2019s leverage ratio. There\u2019s a growing concern that financial institutions are lacking the capital to cover their risks, but that\u2019s not what the most recent data has shown. The culprit, in Pechman\u2019s view, is unrealized losses.

He spoke during a recent episode of the \"We Study Billionaires\" podcast.\n\nHere are Marks' 8 best quotes from the interview, lightly edited for length and clarity:\n\n1. \"The declining interest rates were responsible for the majority of all the money that's been made in the last 45 years.\" (Marks hailed the Federal Reserve's embrace of lower rates as a \"sea change\" for financial markets, as it made borrowing cheaper and debt financing easier.)\n\n2. \"The rates are high today to fight inflation. I don't think they're going to stay this high. But they're through coming down in any major way, and they're through being ultra-low.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \"I just think it's too good to be true to think we can have a credit card we never have to pay the balance on.\" (Marks was warning that continued growth in the US federal debt will likely have serious consequences down the line.)\n\n4. \"AI, just like passive investing and machine learning \u2014 even maybe to a greater extent \u2014 will knock out everybody who doesn't add value. It should be harder and harder and harder to run money and be paid highly for producing inferior. But hopefully there will still be a small group of people who can do something that the machine can't do.\"\n\n5. \"Can an AI-enabled computer sit down with CEOs and figure out which one is Steve Jobs? Can it sit down with five business plans and figure out which one is Amazon? I just don't think so. This is an art form.\"\n\n6. \"There are people who believe that when you have a bank crisis, like we did with Silicon Valley Bank and some of the others, that the weakness of the banks shows the strength of bitcoin. It's in many ways an anti-bank play. It does seem that there are good uses for some coins, and bitcoin seems to be the one in the lead so far.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. \"Humility is a really important thing, especially in the market, which humbles us all. Anybody who doesn't allow for humility, in a field where there's randomness and uncertainty, and qualitative and subjective things are important, is riding for a fall.\"\n\n8. \"People used to talk about the factory of the future, which would have one man and one dog, and it was the dog's job to keep the man from touching the equipment. It was the man's job to feed the dog. I would like to have the Fed keep its hands off the machinery most of the time.\""

        "content": "What Are Crypto Derivatives and How Do They Work?\n\nBy Gaurav Roy\n\nRead 8 min Medium\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS: \u2014 Crypto derivatives derive their value from the underlying asset. Traders use them to gain exposure to the price movement of an asset without actually owning it.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Derivatives are not exclusive to crypto; these types of assets are popular in traditional finance too.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Crypto derivatives come in two types, futures, and options. Traders use these for hedging and speculating.\n\nHave you ever heard of crypto derivatives and wondered what they are all about?\n\nWith the rise of cryptocurrencies, derivatives have emerged as a popular tool for traders to manage risk and speculate on the price movements of digital assets.\n\nBut with their complex nature and potential risks, it\u2019s important to understand the ins and outs of the crypto derivatives market before diving in.\n\nBut wait, Derivatives have been around for ages, right? Indeed, ancient civilizations used derivatives. For example, in Mesopotamia, clay tablets described futures contracts used for agricultural goods. Even in the 19th century, Chicago became a hub for derivatives trading. But now, there are even derivatives for cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn this article, Ledger takes a deep dive into the world of crypto derivatives, exploring what they are, how they work, and what you should know before getting involved. So buckle up and get ready to learn all about this rapidly evolving corner of the crypto world.\n\nWhat are Crypto Derivatives?\n\nCrypto derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from an underlying crypto asset. They are contracts between two parties that allow traders to speculate on the price movements of cryptocurrencies without actually owning the underlying asset. As such, the trader makes a profit or loss depending on whether the asset price goes up or down.\n\nToday, there are specialized cryptocurrency exchanges, as well as traditional financial exchanges offering crypto derivatives, but what\u2019s the point?\n\nWhy Trade Crypto Derivatives?\n\nCrypto derivatives are primarily used for speculation, hedging, and leverage.\n\nSpeculation\n\nThe speculation involves taking a position on the future price movements of crypto to make a profit. This allows traders to take advantage of the high volatility of the crypto market, as it can help them earn significant profits if they correctly predict the future price movements of the underlying asset. This way, traders can capitalize on market opportunities by going long or short.\n\nWhile spot trading also allows speculation \u2014 buying low and selling high \u2014 leverage is what makes derivatives attractive to traders.\n\nLeverage Trading\n\nLeverage trading is the ability to control a large amount of an asset with a relatively small amount. For example, a trader may only need to put down 10% of the total value of a futures contract. For instance, on the crypto exchange Binance, a trader can leverage up to 125 times the initial margin. But while leverage can amplify potential profits, it also drastically increases the risk of losses.\n\nHedging\n\nHedging is another reason for using crypto derivatives. It is a risk management strategy where a trader takes an opposite position to an existing one to offset potential losses. For example, a Bitcoin spot holder buys an asset and then holds it until the value (hopefully) increases. However, if they think the asset might decrease in value, they can take a short position on a Bitcoin futures contract, effectively hedging their position.\n\nTypes of Crypto Derivatives\n\nCrypto derivatives operate similarly to traditional derivatives, where a buyer and seller enter into a contract to sell an underlying asset, with the asset being sold at a predetermined time and price.\n\nDerivatives do not have any value. Instead, they derive their value from the underlying asset. For example, the value of a Bitcoin derivative is determined by the value of Bitcoin.\n\nSo, what kind of derivatives are available in the crypto market? The most commonly traded types of derivatives include futures, options, and perpetual contracts.\n\nWhat are Crypto Futures?\n\nCrypto futures are a type of derivative contract that allows two parties to agree on the price of a cryptocurrency at a fixed date in the future. Upon expiration of the contract, the buyer is obligated to receive and purchase the asset, while the seller is obligated to deliver and sell the asset.\n\nIn today\u2019s financial and crypto markets, physical delivery of the asset does not always occur with futures contracts. Instead, the profit or loss arising from the trade is typically settled in cash and credited or debited to the trader\u2019s account.\n\nWhen entering into a futures contract, traders can take a long or short position, indicating the direction they believe the asset\u2019s price will move.\n\nA long position is when a trader believes that the underlying asset\u2019s price (e.g., Bitcoin) will increase in the future. A short position, on the other hand, is when a trader believes that the underlying asset\u2019s price will decrease in the future.\n\nPerpetual Futures\n\nPerpetual futures are a type of futures contract without an expiration date. Instead, perpetual futures contracts remain open indefinitely until the trader closes the position. This means traders can hold a perpetual futures position for as long as they want, potentially profiting from long-term price movements in the underlying asset.\n\nThese futures contracts work by using a funding mechanism that helps keep the contract price in line with the spot price of the underlying asset. the difference between the perpetual futures price and the spot price of the underlying asset determines the funding rate\n\nFor example, if the price of the perpetual contract exceeds the index price, traders who have taken a \u201clong\u201d position typically pay the funding rate to compensate for the price difference. Conversely, if the perpetual futures contract price is lower than the index price, traders with a \u201cshort\u201d position pay the funding rate.\n\nWhat Are Crypto Options?\n\nCrypto options give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specific amount of a cryptocurrency at a predetermined price (known as the strike price) on or before a specified date.\n\nBut remember, there are several fees involved in trading options derivatives:\n\nOptions premium: The cost paid by the buyer for the right to trade at a set price.\n\nCommission: A fee charged by brokers per options trade, either flat or percentage-based.\n\nContract fees: Small fees charged by exchanges for each option\u2019s contract, paid by both parties.\n\nExercise fees: A fee charged by brokers if the option is exercised.\n\nMargin interest: Interest charged on borrowed funds used in options trading.\n\nBitcoin Options: Call and Put\n\nThere are two types of Bitcoin options: call options and put options.\n\nA call option gives the holder the right to buy crypto at a predetermined price, while a put option gives the holder the right to sell at a predetermined price.\n\nFor example, if a trader thinks that the Bitcoin price will rise in the future, they purchase a call option with a strike price of $100,000 that expires in three months. And if BTC exceeds $100,000 before expiry, the trader may use the option to buy at a lower price and possibly book a profit.\n\nIn both cases, the trader pays a premium to purchase the option, representing the option contract\u2019s price. However, if Bitcoin\u2019s price doesn\u2019t follow the trader\u2019s prediction, they can allow the option to expire, only losing the paid premium.\n\nWhat Is the Impact of Derivatives Trading?\n\nDerivatives, in general, are crucial in establishing a mature financial system. They enable market participants to manage risk, enhance liquidity, and enable price discovery, all of which are essential for market growth and development.\n\nLiquidity is a critical component of the crypto sector, much like any financial market. After all, without liquidity in a system, prices become more volatile.\n\nA lack of liquidity can result in wider bid-ask spreads, increased volatility, and higher transaction costs, making it difficult for traders to enter and exit positions at desirable prices. It can also deter institutions, which typically require a certain level of liquidity to put in large sums of money.\n\nIn contrast, high liquidity attracts more market participants, facilitates efficient and transparent market development, and reduces the likelihood of market manipulation.\n\nDerivatives also allow traders to hedge their risks and manage their portfolios more effectively, increasing market efficiency. Furthermore, limiting traders\u2019 losses allows them to make more rational trading decisions.\n\nFurthermore, derivatives trading can optimize price discovery by providing additional market data that informs price trends and market sentiment.\n\nBenefits and Risks of Trading Crypto Derivatives\n\nTrading derivatives come with its own pros and cons that traders must be aware of to effectively manage their trades.\n\nBenefits\n\nTraders can derive multiple benefits from trading crypto derivatives. For starters, it is cheaper than spot trading.\n\nMoreover, derivatives can help traders mitigate the risks of an underlying asset\u2019s price fluctuations. To explain, using derivatives for hedging helps traders limit losses in the event of an adverse price movement.\n\nDerivatives trading also enables leverage, allowing traders to control larger positions with a smaller amount of capital \u2014 hence magnifying the potential gains. Additionally, derivatives facilitate portfolio diversification, meaning traders can maximize their returns and manage risks more effectively. Trading derivatives across various assets can reduce individual market risks and achieve a more balanced portfolio.\n\nRisks\n\nCrypto derivatives carry several risks, including the risk of volatility. Derivatives trading involves speculating on the price movements of an underlying asset that can be volatile. Leverage trading magnifies this risk: You could potentially incur significant losses.\n\nAnother risk is the unclear legal status of derivatives trading in some jurisdictions. You wouldn\u2019t want your trading strategies to result in potential legal and compliance risks. In fact, it\u2019s illegal in certain countries. Accordingly, traders must check the laws and regulations of their country before engaging in derivatives trading.\n\nThere are also counterparty risks associated with over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trades, as traders may not benefit from the due diligence that comes with trading on regulated exchanges. For example, OTC trades expose traders to credit and default risks.\n\nBest Practices in Trading Crypto Derivatives\n\nIt is important to note that there is no guaranteed way to make money trading derivatives in the crypto market, and it can be a highly risky endeavor. However, there are some ways traders minimize risks and maximize their chances of success.\n\nCommon Tactics\n\nTrading derivatives can be highly complex, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach to success. That being said, traders may use common tactics when trading derivatives, depending on their market outlook and risk tolerance.\n\nFor example, in a bull market, traders may use option contracts to buy at a certain price (a \u201ccall\u201d option), allowing them to benefit from further upward price movements. Similarly, in a bear market, traders may use options contracts to sell at a certain price (a \u201cput\u201d option), providing a hedge against further price drops.\n\nOther tactics include using technical analysis to identify trends and price patterns and using leverage to amplify potential profits.\n\nManage Your Risk\n\nWhen trading crypto derivatives, it is important to manage your risk carefully. Crypto prices are volatile, and since crypto derivatives drive their value from underlying assets, they are subject to the same volatility. Furthermore, leverage trading only amplifies that risk. So, traders should only use it if they understand how it works and they are comfortable with the potential risks.\n\nTraders also manage their risk with specific tools such as stop-loss orders. To explain, this tool will automatically sell a position if it reaches a certain price, limiting potential losses. Additionally, traders often diversify their portfolios across different assets to avoid overexposure to any one position or asset.\n\nDYOR Before Trading Crypto Derivatives\n\nDYOR, or \u201cdo your own research,\u201d is crucial to successful trading in any market, including the crypto derivatives market. By conducting your own research and analysis, you can better understand the market, the assets you are trading, and the potential risks and rewards involved.\n\nMaking informed decisions in the crypto derivatives market involves research. Before you go ahead, make sure to read about the intricacies of crypto trading and how to segregate your assets, should you wish to partake.\n\nIf you\u2019re fully informed and ready to go, interacting with the DeFi scene is easy with the Ledger ecosystem. Ledger Live offers several crypto trading apps which allow you to buy, sell, lend and borrow in one single place. Then, this powerful app works together with your trusty Ledger device, allowing you to interact with the DeFi ecosystem, while staying protected from online threats.\n\nWith all of these pieces together, exploring the crypto market has never been so secure."

        "content": "15 years after the Bitcoin (BTC) white paper was published, \u2018What is mining in cryptocurrency?\u2019 is still the question on the tip of everyone\u2019s tongue. The birth of blockchain technology and the crypto market began with Bitcoin mining.\n\nInitially, Bitcoin miners could mine new coins with a laptop in their bedrooms. Today, professional mining operations are worth millions, with ASIC mining farms burning through a huge amount of energy to earn new Bitcoin payouts.\n\nCrypto mining isn\u2019t only about earning digital currency through block rewards; it also helps secure the blockchain network.\n\nDespite crypto mining being an iconic industry staple, the mining process remains complicated and inaccessible to most people. In this article, we\u2019ll break down cryptocurrency mining for beginners and unpack how it works.\n\nWhat Is Cryptocurrency Mining?\n\nCryptocurrency mining is the process by which new blocks are added to a blockchain and new coins are \u2018minted\u2019, or created. In the case of the Bitcoin network, miners receive new bitcoins in exchange for validating transactions on a decentralized public ledger.\n\nCrypto mining is a competitive game. Miners want to accumulate as many bitcoins as possible, so having large mining rigs with powerful mining hardware gives them a better chance of earning the right to create new blocks.\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nWhen you have thousands of individual miners and mining farms trying to create new blocks for a distributed ledger like the Bitcoin blockchain, there needs to be an algorithm that decides who \u2018wins.\u2019 We call this the Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism.\n\nWhat Is Proof-of-Work?\n\nIn a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, Bitcoin miners compete to create new blocks and earn mining rewards. In its simplest definition, powerful computers work to solve complex mathematical problems and validate Bitcoin transactions. The first miner to find the answer creates the new block and earns their mining rewards.\n\nDiving a bit deeper, every new block generates a target hash. The target hash is a 64-digit hexadecimal number. These digits are made up of not only numbers from 1-10 but also letters A-F. The first miner to guess a number lower or equal to the target hash gets to create the next block and earn the reward.\n\nSource: Union Journal\n\nWith trillions of possible solutions, the odds of guessing these numbers are extremely difficult. Miners with powerful mining equipment can make more \u2018guesses\u2019 faster, giving them a better chance of being the first to find the number.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is the classic example of a Proof-of-Work chain in action, there are plenty of other examples. These include altcoins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), and pre-merge Ethereum (ETH).\n\nBefore taking a closer look at the specifics of crypto mining, let\u2019s have a quick recap:\n\nCryptocurrency mining creates new blocks for a blockchain network and mints new coins to the circulating supply.\n\nMiners compete amongst themselves to solve complex equations, verify new transactions and earn mining rewards.\n\nHigher computing power increases the chance of being the first miner to solve an equation.\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Mining Work?\n\nWhen Satoshi Nakamoto first published the Bitcoin white paper, bitcoin mining was far more democratized than now. Anyone with a computer could start mining at home with a half-decent GPU (Graphics Processing Unit).\n\nBitcoin mining has since become a serious business, with ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) mining farms reaching explosive hash rates and boosting mining difficulty.\n\nIndividual miners struggle to compete with the larger players. To compete in the crypto mining monopoly, smaller miners often join forces to create mining pools, where each miner gets their fair share of new coins.\n\nMining Difficulty\n\nAs the name would suggest, mining difficulty refers to the complexity of the problem each miner is trying to solve. Remember the hexadecimal number that every miner tries to find that we mentioned earlier? The more miners competing to create new blocks, the more possible solutions there are that miners have to guess correctly.\n\nWhen mining difficulty is high, that generally means that market conditions are bullish for Bitcoin or whichever PoW cryptocurrency is being mined. Another way of looking at crypto mining demand is a network\u2019s hash rate.\n\nHash Rate\n\nA blockchain\u2019s hash rate is an indicator of its computational power. Put simply, a network\u2019s hash rate measures how many guesses all miners in the system make per second. To give you an idea, in Q1 2023, Bitcoin averaged a hash rate of roughly 310 million terahashes per second.\n\nSource: BitInfoCharts\n\nA hash rate can also refer to the computational power of individual mining units or groups of miners. Powerful ASIC miners with high hash rates have a better of solving the mining puzzle first, making them far more desirable than smaller CPUs.\n\nWhat Is the Bitcoin Halving?\n\nThe Bitcoin halving is an event that happens every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years. After each halving, the number of new bitcoins in each block reward is cut in half.\n\nWhen the Bitcoin blockchain first went live, each newly minted block paid out 50 bitcoins to miners. Since then, we\u2019ve witnessed three Bitcoin halvings, bringing the block rewards to 6.25 bitcoins per newly created block.\n\nSome miners anticipate that the last Bitcoin will be mined sometime around 2140. If this eventually comes to pass, miners will still earn rewards paid in BTC. However, these rewards will come from network transaction fees rather than newly minted block rewards.\n\nThe Bitcoin Halving is considered a significant event that historically marks the start of a new bull run. This is because when new emissions of BTC are cut in half, the selling pressure that miners generally provide evaporates. After every recorded halving, the price of Bitcoin has reacted positively.\n\nCrypto Mining Pros and Cons\n\nWhile crypto mining can be a good way to acquire new coins and help secure a blockchain network you want to support, many drawbacks remain.\n\nPros\n\nEarn Crypto Rewards\n\nThe main benefit that attracts people to crypto mining is simple. Crypto mining can be a profitable enterprise if managed correctly. Mining cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Dogecoin gives investors a revenue stream of their chosen cryptos.\n\nFor miners with a long-term outlook, this is a great way to accumulate new coins without buying them from a crypto exchange like Coinbase.\n\nSecure and Decentralize a Network\n\nOn top of earning rewards, miners also help to keep the blockchain safe from hacks and malicious actors. Moreover, running a mining operation also helps to decentralize and further distribute the blockchain, making it less reliant on central points of failure.\n\nThis aligns with the original vision of the Bitcoin network, which is to provide a distributed public ledger owned and operated by the people, for the people.\n\nCons\n\nSustainability Problems\n\nPerhaps the biggest issue facing Bitcoin and its mass adoption is its monstrous energy consumption. The Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism demands an enormous amount of power. For example, when Ethereum transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake mechanism, the network reduced its power consumption by 99%.\n\nSource: Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index\n\nAccording to the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index, the network consumes as much energy as the entire nation of Kazakhstan over a year and has a carbon footprint equivalent to that of Singapore.\n\nHigh Costs\n\nStarting a mining operation is a risky business. First, there\u2019s no guarantee that you\u2019ll be able to turn a consistent profit through crypto mining. Volatility in the crypto market presents a constant and significant risk to new miners trying to enter the mining business.\n\nNot to mention the expensive mining equipment and high electricity costs associated with crypto mining.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nDue to Bitcoin\u2019s immense energy consumption concerns, emerging blockchains are moving away from crypto mining and the Proof-of-Work algorithm. Top blockchain protocols like Ethereum, Cardano, and Avalanche all use a variety of a Proof-of-Stake mechanism, which is far more energy efficient.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nWith time, crypto mining outside the Bitcoin blockchain might cease as emerging networks opt for more sustainable alternatives.\n\nFAQs"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe Texas Bitcoin mining bill that the industry didn\u2019t think would make it out of committee did. Then it cleared the State Senate, too\u2014each time with the backing of unanimous votes.\n\nDespite the consternation from Bitcoin miners about the proposal that would cut into their earnings, Wednesday\u2019s vote to send SB-1751 to the Texas House of Representatives happened in a mostly empty room during the local and uncontested session.\n\nThat means, so far, things are proceeding as Marathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel thought they would.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn Texas, I\u2019m confident that while this bill will likely pass the State Senate, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to make it out of the House intact,\u201d he told Decrypt ahead of the vote.\n\nIf enacted, the legislation would curb benefits offered to Bitcoin miners in the state to reduce their power usage during times of high demand. In exchange for cutting their power usage to help the grid prioritize residential customers, Bitcoin miners have been among the commercial clients eligible to receive credits they can use toward their power bills.\n\nAnd so far, the state has had a chummy relationship with Bitcoin miners. Lee Bracher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council industry group, told Reuters that Bitcoin miners consume roughly 2,100 megawatts\u2014up 75% over the past year\u2014and amount to roughly 3.7% of the state\u2019s peak load.\n\nThiel said the company has been looking to diversify its operations and renewable power options, but added that \u201c1751 won\u2019t change our minds about Texas.\u201d\n\nMarathon, which trades on the Nasdaq under the MARA ticker, hosts the majority of its rigs\u201410 exahash of its total installed 14 EH\u2014in several Texas facilities. Those facilities were run by Compute North until the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September. Then in December, U.S. Bitcoin Corp. stepped in to replace Compute North at three of the facilities where Marathon hosts rigs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat means Thiel could soon be a customer of Toronto-based Bitcoin miner Hut 8.\n\nIn February the publicly traded miner, which trades on Nasdaq under the HUT ticker, announced plans to merge with U.S. Bitcoin. Last month Hut 8 CEO Jaime Leverton said during an earnings call that the Canadian competition authority had issued a letter of no action, meaning there\u2019s no regulatory hurdle to clear before the deal can close.\n\nLeverton told Decrypt earlier this month during an interview for the gm podcast that she\u2019s especially excited by the work that U.S. Bitcoin has done with artificial intelligence and machine learning to manage energy use and maintenance for individual rigs.\n\n\u201cWe haven't seen anything else quite like it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think there's a ton of potential as we get to the other side of this transaction, to really figure out how to scale and port some of that proprietary IP that they're working on to other applications outside of just Bitcoin mining.\u201d\n\nBut even if SB-1751 hasn\u2019t changed Thiel\u2019s mind on its growth in Texas, he said Marathon wants to keep diversifying its operations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also expanding in North Dakota\u2014we have a big site in North Dakota\u2014that\u2019s about 180 megawatts there that\u2019s coming online as we speak,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we still have lots of sites in Texas, and we\u2019ll continue to develop those sites.\u201d\n\nThe company has also started building out two $400 million mining facilities in the United Arab Emirates, a joint venture with FS Innovation in which Marathon has a 20% stake. The locations, which Thiel expects to go live before the end of this year, will have a combined 250-megawatt facility of capacity.\n\nThiel called the UAE venture Marathon\u2019s \u201ccoming out party,\u201d since it hasn\u2019t previously done its own site design and development. Marathon usually places its rigs in hosted sites, run by other companies. But that could continue to change as Marathon looks at ways to set up more small, low-maintenance sites.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe goal, he said, is to look for places where Marathon can set up very small Bitcoin mining operations \u201cat the edge,\u201d or at the source of where renewable energy can be generated.\n\n\u201cEconomically, that means you don\u2019t have to have a lot of people on the small sites,\u201d Thiel added. \u201cWe can essentially run a truck by every month or so to make sure everything\u2019s running fine.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin surpasses $30,000 mark as investors eye end of rate rises\n\nBitcoin is nearing a crucial technical milestone about a year away, which may potentially spark a sustained uptick in the cryptocurrency's worth.\n\nThe forthcoming \u2018halving\u2019 for Bitcoin is estimated to take place around April or May 2024, though the exact timing is yet to be determined.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\n\u2018Halvings\u2019 reduce the rate at which new coins are created and thus lower the available amount of new supply.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, one Bitcoin was valued at roughly $30,200, according to data from CoinGecko. The world's leading cryptocurrency has seen a remarkable increase of over 80 percent since the start of the year.\n\nIn the past few weeks, Bitcoin's price has been climbing, driven by an anticipation of the impending halving and the potential for a US Federal Reserve interest rate reduction. They might offset the impact of decelerating growth and constricting credit conditions due to the challenges in the banking sector.\n\nBitcoin has gained 2% over the last 24 hours.\n\nReasons behind rally and what the future holds\n\nSpeaking to Moneycontrol, leading industry experts weighed in on the reasons behind the price rise and shared their expectations for the future of Bitcoin.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nRuadhan O, the lead developer of Seasonal Tokens said, \"Bitcoin\u2019s rate of production was cut into half in 2020. Since then, they have gradually become scarcer.\"\n\nThere are four Seasonal Tokens --Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. They have been designed to increase price in a predictable sequence. For example, prices tend to go up in Spring, then Summer, Autumn, Winter, and Spring again.\n\nHe also mentioned that market fears in 2022 delayed the price adjustment. He believes the next major barrier is around $32,000, and if upward pressure continues, \"the price could quickly escalate from $32,000 to $35,000, as the bears are forced to cover their short positions.\"\n\nFurthermore, he anticipates that the entire crypto market is likely to move alongside Bitcoin.\n\nNischal Gaba, CMO of DefiEdge, acknowledged divided opinions on Bitcoin's recent surge, with some analysts believing it signals the end of the bear market.\n\nHowever, he also highlighted concerns about the dull trading volume, which some see as a sign that the current rally may be a fakeout.\n\nGaba emphasised the importance of closely observing BTC's movement in the next few weeks to determine the nature of the price change.\n\nStart of a bull run?\n\nBlake Harris, the Founding Principle of Blake Harris Law, pointed out that factors such as bank failures and government responses by printing more money have made Bitcoin more attractive.\n\n\"This does appear to be the start of another bull run,\" he said.\n\nHowever, he also cautioned that \"if the recession gets worse, we should expect Bitcoin to also drop.\" Harris believes the next resistance level could be around $70,000, but he expects altcoins to swing in the same direction as Bitcoin, albeit to a lesser extent.\n\nPavel Matveev, CEO and Co-Founder of Wirex, attributed BTC's move to $30,000 to its return as a non-correlated store of value and changes in centralised exchange BTC dynamics.\n\nHe predicts a slight retrace in BTC price in the short term and emphasises the ongoing economic and regulatory challenges that will continue to impact crypto prices.\n\nGabby Kusz, CEO of the Global Digital Asset & Cryptocurrency Association, believes Bitcoin's rally will continue, with the next resistance level at about $50,000.\n\nShe expects altcoins to tip upwards when Bitcoin is up, but to a lesser degree than in previous rallies.\n\n\"Given the underlying reason for a Bitcoin rally at this point, it\u2019s clear commodity classification, I would expect altcoins to tip upwards when Bitcoin is up but at a far less degree to which we have seen under previous Bitcoin rallies,\" she said.\n\nEric Chen, CEO and Co-founder of Injective Labs, and core contributor to Injective said the surge in the price of Bitcoin could potentially lead to increased interest and investment from both retail and institutional investors.\n\nChen, however, emphasised the importance of acknowledging the unpredictable nature of the crypto market and the likelihood of continued price fluctuations.\n\n\"In terms of what to expect next for digital assets, it's difficult to make concrete predictions. However, there are several trends and developments that could have an impact on the crypto market in the coming months and years. They include increased institutional adoption, regulatory developments, and innovation with new use cases for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology,\" Chen said."

        "content": "In the last ten years, the finance sector has seen the rise of digital currencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Big Eyes Coin (BIG). This development has had varying effects on the prices of traditional commodities like gold, silver, and other precious metals. It\u2019s evident that the surge in digital assets has influenced the prices of gold and silver and vice versa. In the current year, both the prices of gold and silver and cryptocurrencies have been on the rise, prompting speculation among financial market enthusiasts about a potential bull market.\n\nAnticipating the Big Release of Big Eyes Coin\n\nBig Eyes Coin is a new cryptocurrency project that has attracted a significant following. The project aims to create a platform for artists and collectors to trade and invest in digital art. Big Eyes Coin\u2019s community, known as the Cat Crew, is eagerly anticipating the bull run as gold and silver prices increase along with cryptocurrencies.\n\nWise investors who bought Big Eyes Coin during its early presale stages are celebrating the remarkable increase in its value over time. At stage 1 of the presale, each Big Eyes Coin was worth $0.0001, but as of stage 12, its value has risen to $0.00049, which represents a 390% increase. Investors who wait too long to invest in the token could miss out on opportunities as the price of the coin is set to increase with each presale stage. Therefore, it is crucial to invest early to maximize returns.\n\nMoreover, Big Eyes Coin is offering its bonus code BULLRUN250 for crypto fans and financial market enthusiasts who want to get an extra 250% on their next BIG purchase.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Soaring Price: Should You Consider Investing Now?\n\nBitcoin has a strong relationship with gold and silver, while its relationship with the stock market has weakened. Crypto analysts and financial market experts have observed this phenomenon as news of the banking crisis flooded the internet. BTC welcomed a new rally twice in the middle of March, and its price continues to climb.\n\nThis could be a good opportunity to invest in Bitcoin if investors are willing to hold onto BTC for several years. Token holders can also buy BTC in small sizes to avoid worrying about buying too high. However, investors must still remember that prices may continue to rise over time. As of the time of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at $28,480 and has seen a 1.44% increase in the last seven days.\n\nEthereum Breaks Through Resistance Level Barrier\n\nThe crypto market has seen a positive trend with Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, breaking the $1,900 resistance level for the first time in seven months. The cryptocurrency is currently trading above $1,910, which is an encouraging sign for Ethereum investors. ETH was last valued at this price on August 16th, 2022, during a crypto market downturn. This occurred as the United States Federal Reserve raised the Federal Funds rate in an attempt to combat inflation.\n\nIs a Bull Market Approaching? Consider Your Investment Opportunities Now\n\nThe bull market presents an exciting opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on the rising prices of crypto coins and positive market sentiment. This is the best time to invest in crypto as the upward trend is likely to continue. As the price of Ethereum continues to rise, it is expected to reach the next stop of $2,000. The upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, which aims to improve the network\u2019s scalability, security, and energy efficiency, is expected to make Ethereum even more appealing to investors and developers.\n\nLooking for the next crypto to enhance your portfolio?

        "content": "After struggling to hit $25,000 just one month ago, Bitcoin (BTC) has surged in value, breaking the $30k barrier and becoming one of the most profitable assets in the world once again.\n\nWhile the traditional banking market has remained turbulent, Bitcoin (BTC) has consistently increased in price, taking projects like Solana (SOL) and Collateral Network (COLT), which has already seen 40% returns, with it.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Hits $30k, But How High Will It Go?\n\nIn the past five days, Bitcoin (BTC) has increased in price by 7.58%, adding an extra $2,113.32 to its value with one Bitcoin (BTC) now selling for $30,014. This is the highest value Bitcoin (BTC) has reached since July 2022 and suggests that the crypto bear market is coming to an end.\n\nHaving increased in price by 34.47% in the last thirty days alone, market analysts are now asking how high Bitcoin (BTC) will go. Most believe that Bitcoin (BTC) could hit $32k before the end of April, though not all are as optimistic. Some experts have stated that Bitcoin (BTC) could have hit a new price barrier, which would limit returns for investors who get involved now.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nSolana (SOL) Up 20%, But Could It Be Too Late To Profit?\n\nSolana (SOL) experienced a turbulent month in March following a fork in the Solana (SOL) blockchain, which caused throughput to crash. This created security concerns among holders, though Solana (SOL) has since bounced back in line with Bitcoin (BTC) trends.\n\nOver the past 30 days, Solana (SOL) has increased in price by 20.26%, with a 15.31% price increase in the last five days alone. One Solana (SOL) token, at the time of writing, is worth $23.72, its highest price since February 2023. However, with Solana (SOL) relying on market trends, analysts believe it could be too late to make short-term profits on Solana (SOL), with many expecting the project to hit a price wall in April.\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) Offers Strong Returns Despite Market Trends\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) is a new DeFi project with great potential. Having already increased in value during its presale, analysts believe that Collateral Network (COLT) could offer a massive ROI of 35x for bullish investors.\n\nUnlike many DeFi projects, which increase in value based on the market, Collateral Network (COLT) looks to offer great returns with its unique utility. Collateral Network (COLT) looks to influence the crowdfunding market by allowing borrowers to unlock liquidity quickly from their valuable real-world assets. Jewellery, cars and fine art are a few examples of usable, physical assets.\n\nEach asset is brought on-chain in the form of a fractionalized NFT. Once on-chain, lenders can loan money in the form of NFT fractions instead of offering the full amount upfront. The borrower then repays the lenders to have their asset returned.

        "title": "With Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) Rallying How Does Their Growth Compare To New Deflationary Meme Coin ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Over the past few years, meme coins have taken the crypto industry by storm by offering ways for investors to generate huge profits from tokens that seem to have no intrinsic value.\n\nHowever, as we move into 2023, many meme tokens with exciting prospects and real-world utility are now providing limitless growth opportunities.\n\nOne of these meme tokens with an exciting prospect is DigiToads, a recent toad-featuring token revolutionizing the crypto industry with its deflationary, utility-rich, community-oriented features.\n\nCompared to major crypto projects like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), DigiToads (TOADS) has proven to be a high-growth token.\n\nIn this article, we are going to look at the new token, DigiToads (TOADS), as it compares to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nDigiToads (TOADS)\n\nDigiToads (TOADS) is a deflationary meme coin with a focus on real-world utility. DigiToads is a high-growth token. And holders of its native token, TOADS, will earn residual income through NFT staking and P2E gaming.\n\nThe DigiToads\u2019 P2E Gaming features an exciting web3 game that allows players to collect, nurture and battle other unique DigiToads.\n\nEach DigiToad has its own characteristics, giving players a wide range of options. Players will acquire these DigiToads by buying, trading, or winning them.\n\nPlayers will have the opportunity to make their DigiToads the strongest in the swamp arena. They can achieve this by using their TOADS tokens to purchase food and training equipment for their DigiToads.\n\nThese items will help their DigiToads learn new abilities, increase their size and strength, thereby helping the players compete better in battles against other players.\n\nAt the end of the DigiToads season, which lasts for one month, the platform allocates 50% of the funds raised from sales to the prize fund and distributes it among the top 25% of players. This provides the players with an opportunity to earn real money while enjoying the game.\n\nThe DigiToads ecosystem also incorporates NFT staking. This is a well-designed system that guarantees that the community is always rewarded.\n\nThe platform ensures that 2% of every TOADS transaction is put into the staking pool allowing users who stake their NFTs to get rewards depending on how much time their tokens are staked.\n\nDigiToads also plans to support the Amazon rainforest, home to many species of toads and frogs. The platform will donate 2.5% of the money raised from its sales to charities dedicated to replanting trees and preserving the rainforest.\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is a decentralized digital currency which one can use to purchase, sell, and exchange directly with other users without any intermediary.\n\nThe token\u2019s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, said that there is the need for \u201can electronic payment system based on crypto proof instead of trust.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is open-source; nobody owns or controls it, and everyone can participate. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate without any need for a central authority; managing transactions is carried out by the network.\n\nThrough its special properties, Bitcoin includes many exciting features not covered by previous payment systems.\n\nSince its launch, Bitcoin has risen dramatically in value. Although it once sold for under $10 per token, as of April 11, one BTC sells for about $30,000.\n\nBecause its supply is limited to only 21 million tokens, many crypto experts expect Bitcoin\u2019s price to keep rising, especially as more big investors begin to treat it as digital gold to hedge against market inflation and volatility.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum (ETH) is an open-source blockchain developed in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, who wanted a project that would deliver much more possibilities against Bitcoin\u2019s design for storing and transferring money.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s thinking was: if one can use blockchain technology to decentralize money, why can\u2019t we use the same blockchain to decentralize other things?\n\nEthereum introduced the decentralized app (DApp) system, enabling developers to create applications that expanded the use of blockchain to many uses.\n\nThe Ethereum network is the leading system for the nascent decentralized finance (DeFi). The system aids smart contracts in executing secure financial transactions. Smart contracts allow decentralized applications to run automatically on the blockchain when specific predetermined conditions are met.\n\nThe supply of ETH is infinite, and there are currently more than 121 million in circulation. The 2022 Ethereum \u201cMerge\u201d will dramatically slow the creation of new tokens and possibly make Ether deflationary.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe TOADS token is a high-growth asset that offers tremendous growth opportunities for investors to earn passive income through holding the tokens, NFT staking, and P2E gaming.\n\nDigiToads presale for the TOADS has just started, with over $1.2m raised so far. The token is currently selling at the price of $0.016.\n\nThis is an excellent opportunity for early investors to achieve higher returns on their investment as the presale will go through ten stages, with the token\u2019s price increasing at each stage.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "As we enter the second quarter of 2023, Bitcoin (BTC) has continued its impressive run, gaining over 80% year to date. This surge in value has sparked renewed optimism around the cryptocurrency, and as a result, the number of Bitcoin millionaires has doubled. Just halfway through April, over 50,000 new Bitcoin millionaires emerged.\n\nAccording to data compiled by Finbold, the number of Bitcoin millionaire addresses as of April 14 stood at 80,659, representing an increase of 52,575, or 187%, from the January 5 figure of 28,084 BTC millionaire holders.\n\nBitcoin millionaires. Source: BitInfoCharts.com\n\nAs per the data provided by BitInfoCharts.com, 74,912 different addresses have a Bitcoin balance valued at over $1 million. Additionally, 5,747 addresses hold BTC worth over $10 million.\n\nUsing the web archive tool Wayback Machine, on January 5, 2023, about 24,279 addresses owned Bitcoin, equivalent to at least $1 million, while 3,805 addresses accounted for BTC valued at over $10 million.\n\nBitcoin millionaires January 5, 2023. Source: BitInfoCharts.com\n\nBitcoin rally leads to new BTC millionaires\n\nThe recent surge in Bitcoin price and the emergence of new millionaires can be attributed to the crypto market overcoming the bearish conditions of 2022, which were marked by high inflation and incidents such as the FTX collapse.\n\nDespite the banking crisis that unfolded in March and the uncertainty surrounding Binance, Bitcoin has continued to climb, recently reaching a peak of $31,000.This solid upward trend suggests that the crypto market is continuing to gain momentum, despite the challenges it has faced in the past.\n\nAs investors seek to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on the potential of digital assets, Bitcoin remains a leading choice for those looking to ride the wave of this exciting and dynamic market.\n\nAs things stand, Bitcoin is trading at $30,710 and has gained 1.6% in the last 24 hours and a further 10% across the previous week, with a total market capitalization of $594 billion, as per the data retrieved by Finbold on April 14.\n\nBitcoin 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\n\n\nCrypto trading analyst Michael van de Poppe noted in a tweet on April 14 investors should brace themselves for some shallow corrections as it looks to test key resistance points at $31,700 \u2013 $32,000.\n\nMeanwhile, the crypto community predicted that Bitcoin\u2019s average price by the end of April would be $23,561 with 83% historical accuracy. On the other hand, the machine learning algorithms forecasted a higher price of $30,697, closer to its current price for the same date.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "$50k Bitcoin imminent? Multiple indicators point to possible sharp breakthrough - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "As the 2023 Bitcoin (BTC) rally continues, the cryptocurrency has recently achieved a 10-month high, surpassing $30,000, benefiting from generally positive market sentiment. Investors are now eagerly anticipating the next price target for Bitcoin, especially with the ongoing economic uncertainties.\n\nIn this line, in a tweet on April 15, Stockmoney Lizards, a pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst, said the current gains are part of a pre-halving rally that mirrors the 2020 surge of around 320% after reaching a bottom. During both periods, Bitcoin has also attained a Fibonacci retracement of 38.2%.\n\nLooking ahead, the analyst noted that Bitcoin hitting $49,000 remains a \u2018possible target for the next months\u2019 based on historical price movements.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIt is worth noting that the next Bitcoin halving is expected to occur in April or May 2024, when the block reward will fall to 3.125. The halving events are considered a bullish sentiment for Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s new resistance levels\n\nBitcoin\u2019s latest surge has partly emerged as the world economy is witnessing a decline in inflation, leading to expectations that central banks may soon shift their policies towards monetary easing. Therefore, crypto trading analyst Michael van de Poppe, in a tweet on April 14, suggested that Bitcoin looks strong overall but cautioned investors to expect \u201cshallow corrections in an upwards trend\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve marked $31.7-32K as important resistance point. However, $25K was the level everyone wanted to buy. This will probably shift to $28.5K, and then nobody buys. I\u2019d prefer to focus on $29.7K,\u201d he said.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView\n\nElsewhere, the Bitcoin rainbow chart indicates that BTC might have embarked on a new rally ahead of the halving event. According to the chart, as of April 15, BTC is currently in the \u2018Accumulate\u2019 zone after a period of consolidation in the \u2018Basically a Fire Sale\u2019 area.\n\nBitcoin rainbow chart. Source: Blockchaincenter\n\nInterestingly, this pattern resembles a previous trend in March 2020, days before the halving event. In March 2020, Bitcoin emerged from the \u2018Basically a Fire Sale\u2019 zone while trading below $6,000. This event marked a significant turning point for the cryptocurrency, triggering a price bottom that eventually led to a surge in value towards the 2021 bull run. Ultimately, this upward trend culminated in BTC reaching an all-time high of nearly $69,000.\n\nThe tool serves as a valuable resource for investors to track future price fluctuations of Bitcoin. It uses color bands that follow a logarithmic regression and assesses the historical price performance of Bitcoin, providing insight into the asset\u2019s long-term movements.\n\nThe latest Bitcoin gains come after the asset positively reacted to the banking crisis and the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hike, resulting in consolidation. At the same time, following the release of the non-farm payrolls report, which showed a decline in March, the market started to experience renewed bullish activity. Inflation data also indicated a drop in consumer prices in China, which helped to push Bitcoin above $30,000 once again.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBy press time, Bitcoin was trading at $30,446 with slight corrections of over 1% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, Bitcoin is up almost 9%.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s one-day technical analysis, as retrieved from TradingView, is dominated by bullish sentiments. A summary of the gauges is for \u2018buy\u2019 at 14, while \u2018moving averages\u2018 recommend \u2018strong buy\u2019 at 13.\n\nBitcoin technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nAt the moment, Bitcoin proponents believe the asset is at a pivotal phase in its adoption journey, especially with the U.S. dollar facing an onslaught over its status as the world reserve currency. Bitcoin\u2019s possibility to hit $50,000 will also rely on the broader economic trajectory and external factors like regulatory outlook.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "By Adedapo Adesanya\n\nTether Operations Limited (Tether), the technology company supporting the blockchain-enabled platform that powers the largest stablecoin by market capitalization (USD\u20ae), and the Swiss City of Lugano have announced the second inaugural Plan \u20bf Summer School programme to drive Bitcoin education.\n\nThe Plan \u20bf Summer School was founded to make blockchain education accessible and to shape a new generation of business owners, students, researchers, and more. It is co-organized with Franklin University Switzerland (FUS), Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera Italiana (USI), and the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI).\n\nLast year, Tether contributed its expertise and knowledge to this initiative by focusing on educating a new generation of students. The previous program gathered 86 students from 29 different countries, including Italy, Switzerland, Taiwan, Canada, Brazil, and Colombia, all of who brought with them a passion for learning about the future of the blockchain ecosystem and exploring new environments.\n\n\u201cA strong focus on education is a vital next step to mainstream adoption of blockchain and the long-term implication of blockchain technology,\u201d said Mr Paolo Ardoino, Tether\u2019s CTO.\n\n\u201cThe Plan \u20bf Summer School will allow participants to work with leading industry minds on developing peer-to-peer prototypes and deepening their understanding of the technology helping shape the next generation of founders, developers and creators.\u201d\n\nThe focus of this year\u2019s two-week Summer School program will be Bitcoin and Peer-to-Peer technologies and how they will unleash financial freedom and promote the freedom of speech. Course topics will focus on Bitcoin, the Lightning Network, stablecoins, peer-to-peer technologies, mining, blockchain analysis, regulation, self-custody, and more.\n\nStudents will be given the opportunity to choose one of the two-course tracks. The Satoshi track is designed for beginners with little to no experience in coding but with a general interest in the fundamentals of blockchain, and the Pear track is for intermediate to advanced students who are passionate about coding and interested in learning how to build on Peer-to-Peer technologies.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to welcome the Plan \u20bf Summer School once again, and we hope for the same turnout and attendance as the past year. Lugano will keep making its mark as a crypto and educational hub,\u201d said Michele Foletti, Mayor of the City of Lugano. \u201cWe hope to educate a new generation of potential employers alongside local academic universities in order to make Lugano a hub for the future.\u201d\n\nProminent industry leaders giving their time to guest lecture at the Plan \u20bf Summer School include Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Tether, Adam Back, the CEO of Blockstream, Giacomo Zucco, the CEO of Zuckbucks, Sanja Kon, the CEO of UTrust, Riccardo Masutti Cybersecurity and Privacy Consultant focused in Bitcoin and more.\n\nLuca Maria Gambardella, Pro-Rector for Innovation and Corporate Relations at the Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera Italiana (USI) stated that he wishes to \u201cpromote the Summer School with enthusiasm and commitment, which reinforces the collaboration on education initiated between the partners with the \u2018B4B \u2013 Blockchain for Business\u2019 course, and which attracts experts, students and professionals from all over the world to Lugano, strengthening the Lugano Citt\u00e0 Universitaria project as a place of study, meeting and comparison\u201d.\n\nEmanuele Carpanzano, SUPSI\u2019s Director of Research, Development and Knowledge Transfer, agreed, speaking on behalf of the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland, saying: \u201cWe are delighted to contribute to the realisation of this Summer School in Lugano, an educational proposal in line with the mission we share with our partners: to transmit knowledge and skills, as well as to network students and professionals with each other\u201d.\n\nKim Hildebrant and Dr. Branko Sain, respectively, President and Dean of Franklin University\u2019s Taylor Institute, also declared, \u201cLugano\u2019s Plan \u20bf is an ambitious project for an ambitious city. We immediately found a common understanding with the Mayor of Lugano and his team around the opportunity to run the first edition of the Summer School last year and the privilege of hosting it again next summer. At Franklin University Switzerland, we believe that any kind of progress, be it social, environmental, economic or technological, requires positive change. And change is fostered by education and by selfless and courageous leadership like that of our City and the three local universities\u201d."
