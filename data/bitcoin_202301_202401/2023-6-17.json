        "title": "Is Crypto Dead? - The Atlantic",
        "content": "Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed 13 charges against Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, accusing it of mishandling customer funds and a litany of other white-collar crimes. It also charged Coinbase, a public company and the biggest U.S. crypto business, with failing to register as a broker-dealer.\n\nThe government actions did not move the price of bitcoin much, nor did they crater Coinbase stock; traders and investors had been expecting the enforcement actions for months. And both firms vowed to fight the charges and remain operational. Binance \u201cshould not be the subject of an SEC enforcement action, let alone on an emergency basis,\u201d the firm said in a statement. \u201cWe are very confident in the way we run our business\u2014the same business we presented to the SEC in order for us to become a public company,\u201d Paul Grewal, Coinbase\u2019s chief legal officer, said in response.\n\nEven before the SEC announcements, crypto was in trouble. Dozens of firms had failed, millions of individual investors had plunged into the red or cashed out, and billions of dollars of institutional investment had moved on. Beset by long-standing problems of its own invention, the industry now faces not just a regulatory crisis but an existential one too: Is crypto down, or is it dead?\n\nIt is definitely down, written off by thousands of individual and institutional investors. The most obvious issue: scams. In the world of crypto, big firms are scams. Little firms are scams. Stable coins are scams; exchanges are scams; NFT schemes are scams; initial coin offerings are scams; tokens are scams. Firms run by self-proclaimed altruists are scams. Firms run by the shadiest dudes you can possibly imagine are scams. \u201cThere have been a lot of putatively decentralized Web3 companies that were really just three guys and a pair of servers in a pump-and-dump coin scheme,\u201d Will Wilkinson, the head of policy at TBD, a bitcoin-focused subsidiary of the fintech giant Block, told me. And even simple, legitimate crypto activity remains prone to fraud. Hackers purloined nearly $4 billion of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies last year alone, according to the research group Chainalysis.\n\nThe industry also has a complexity problem. Fourteen years since the advent of bitcoin, people still struggle to comprehend how the blockchain works, what Web3 is, and what tokens and coins and NFTs are. Many folks also struggle to figure out how to buy crypto assets and manage their investments. (Why do you need a weird series of letters and numbers to secure your bitcoin, again?)\n\n\u201cA mature market is one that shouldn\u2019t make you afraid to put your money in. You shouldn\u2019t be turning off a bunch of folks with greed and theft,\u201d Yesha Yadav, an expert in financial-market regulation at Vanderbilt University\u2019s law school, told me. \u201cEqually, it should be one in which folks feel comfortable in understanding the technicalities.\u201d\n\nWhat is the point of doing all of this, anyway? Boosters have for years described crypto as a revolutionary technology\u2014disempowering central banks, empowering private individuals, and perhaps even ushering in an era of world peace. But revolutionary for whom and in what way? That\u2019s hard to say. Most crypto users are just making speculative bets; most crypto firms are just making or facilitating speculative bets themselves. Crypto is a casino, for the most part, and one without the free drinks.\n\nThese digital assets are \u201cpretty much only good for illegal activities, like money laundering, narco-terrorism, and tax evasion,\u201d Dennis Kelleher, a co-founder of Better Markets, a nonprofit advocating for financial regulation, told me. \u201cIs there social or public interest in enabling a financial product like that?\u201d\n\nThen there are the volatility and the bubbles. Financial assets go up in price. They go down in price. This is their nature. But few things go up and down quite like crypto. NFTs came out of nowhere, sucked up billions of dollars, and collapsed. Initial coin offerings came out of nowhere, sucked up billions of dollars, and disappeared.\n\nEven bitcoin\u2014the most stalwart and liquid part of the industry\u2014still sees wild swings in price. Two years ago, the internet and the airwaves were awash with advertisements painting crypto as an investment for the brave, a down payment on the future. These ads targeted everyone, especially Black investors historically shunned by Main Street financial institutions. \u201cI want to ensure that communities like the one I come from are not left behind,\u201d LeBron James said, announcing a multiyear deal with Crypto.com. It was a pump-and-dump on a multibillion-dollar scale. \u201cDumb money\u201d got in to get smart money out. Black money got in to get white money out. The price of bitcoin quintupled. Then it crumbled.\n\nWealthy investors might be able to tolerate these kinds of losses. High-risk investors might be able to tolerate this kind of volatility. So too might crypto true believers, for whom HODL, or \u201cHold on for dear life,\u201d is a common refrain. But most people don\u2019t want to hold on for dear life.\n\nIf these were the only issues, the crypto winter might just be that\u2014a season. The price of bitcoin and ether would recover, as they already are. People would forget about the brazen frauds and the sweaty ads and the endless hacks. New businesses would start; new promises would be made; new money would flow in.\n\nBut for Uncle Sam. From the very beginning, many crypto businesses have been engaged in something called \u201cregulatory entrepreneurship.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cask forgiveness, not permission\u201d as a business model: Start-up founders create a company in probable violation of American law, argue that the law should not apply to them, grow \u201ctoo big to ban,\u201d lobby intensively, and hope for the best. It might sound delusional, but it\u2019s a common strategy in Silicon Valley, one that has worked out for Airbnb, Uber, Lyft, and DraftKings, among others.\n\nFor years, crypto companies argued that American financial regulations do not apply to them because, well, because. They pushed Congress to \u201cclarify\u201d the laws. And while Congress debated whether and how to do so, those firms allowed individual customers to buy, trade, and leverage their newfangled assets. Still, American financial companies abiding by American financial law largely avoided pouring money into or building products with crypto, because of the legal and regulatory risk. Goldman Sachs didn\u2019t start packaging ether into derivatives; Bank of America would not let you pay your mortgage in bitcoin.\n\nThis weird status quo protected the broader American financial system from the fraud and chaos of the crypto markets. But it left individual crypto investors exposed to that fraud and chaos. \u201cWhat makes my blood boil is the fact that actual people have been losing their shirts,\u201d Yadav told me, \u201cwhile we are over here stroking our chins about what exactly these asset classes represent.\u201d\n\nThe collapse in November of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s Bahamian crypto mega-exchange-slash-alleged-Ponzi-scheme, did not destabilize the financial system. But it did kill off the chances of Congress passing crypto-friendly legislation. And while Congress delayed, debated, and walked away, the SEC forged ahead, insisting that most crypto assets are securities, arguing that crypto companies have failed to register their businesses and structure them properly, and promising to force them into compliance. Coinbase and Binance are just the biggest and latest companies targeted; there have been dozens of enforcement actions in the past few years.\n\nCrypto firms complain that this is innovation-stifling \u201cregulation by enforcement\u201d: Congress needs to clarify the rules before the SEC can administer them. \u201cImagine if more than a century ago regulators had cut Ford and General Motors off from banking services because they considered automobiles too risky,\u201d Katie Haun, a prominent crypto investor, wrote in The Wall Street Journal in March. \u201cMajor U.S. policy decisions should be made by Congress and state legislatures, not by unelected officials.\u201d\n\nBut many financial experts argue that the SEC\u2019s authority is obvious. Most crypto assets are securities: \u201can investment of money in a common enterprise with profits to come solely from the efforts of others,\u201d as defined in a 1946 Supreme Court case. (Bitcoin, notably, is not a security: Nobody is profiting from the efforts of bitcoin\u2019s leadership, because bitcoin has no leaders.) \u201cThe SEC is trying to enforce the most basic investor protections we have,\u201d Kelleher told me. \u201cTruthfully, these are not aggressive cases. These aren\u2019t close calls.\u201d\n\nTo the crypto industry, they might be devastating, though. Many crypto firms do not have a business model that nets out if standard financial regulations apply\u2014that\u2019s the essence of regulatory entrepreneurship. Coinbase, the SEC alleges, is a jumble of conflicts of interest, one providing insufficient protections and disclosures to its customers and performing shoddy bookkeeping. Were it to restructure, it would likely be a smaller company with higher costs and narrower or even obliterated margins. (The company was profitable before the crypto collapse and is now operating in the red.) Binance is functionally a criminal enterprise, SEC Chair Gary Gensler argues\u2014\u201can extensive web of deception\u201d purposefully evading American law. (The SEC complaint includes a message that Binance\u2019s chief compliance officer sent to a colleague, making Gensler\u2019s case for him: \u201cWe are operating as a fking unlicensed securities exchange in the USA bro.\u201d)\n\nThe risks to those two firms mirror the risks to the crypto industry as a whole. \u201cIt seems like this is just the beginning,\u201d Edward Moya, a crypto analyst, wrote in a note to clients last week, adding that the \u201cregulatory hammer\u201d is swinging and predicting that traders would abandon positions, pull assets off exchanges, and dump speculative investments.\n\nDoes this mean crypto is dead? Yes and no. Crypto boosters\u2019 grandest vision\u2014of digital currencies changing everything, putting the Federal Reserve out of business, supplanting Wall Street and Main Street, and remaking the web as Web3\u2014does seem over. Crypto is a trillion-dollar global asset class. Crypto is also a fringe industry that is offshoring and shrinking and growing more fringe, not one innovating alongside and outcompeting Big Finance.\n\nBut bitcoin and the blockchain are going to stick around, the former a popular alternative investment and a preferred currency of criminals, the latter a curious general-use technology. \u201cThe potential is the same,\u201d Jerry Brito, the executive director of Coin Center, a crypto think tank and advocacy group, told me. Wilkinson, for his part, noted how helpful bitcoin had proved to be in getting money to people without access to strong and stable banking networks: human-rights activists in Ukraine, refugees fleeing climate disasters, families receiving remittances in Ghana and Kenya. Both said they believe the industry would benefit from having the scammy, scummy actors and cheap-and-easy money flushed out. \u201cSome of these projects are potentially revolutionary,\u201d Brito told me. \u201cBut I think a large portion of the ecosystem was completely cynical. That\u2019s not helpful.\u201d\n\nI am still not sure whether many crypto projects are useful, yet alone revolutionary. Surely some use cases are out there waiting to be discovered, but good luck to crypto companies trying to persuade Americans to adopt them going forward. A recent CNBC survey found that 8 percent of adults have a positive view of crypto. A recent Pew survey found that just 2 percent of adults familiar with crypto are \u201cextremely\u201d confident in its safety and reliability. The past two years of price crashes, Ponzi schemes, and stolen funds have not just soured the government on crypto. They have soured the public too."

One of the bill\u2019s main provisions is to fire Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler. The bill would remove Gensler from office and redistribute power between the SEC chair and commissioners. It would also add a sixth commissioner to the agency, disallow any party from holding a majority on the commission and create an executive director position. The SEC declined to comment on the matter.\n\nBlackRock applies for spot Bitcoin ETF \u2014 a US first if approved\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest investment company, has filed an application for a Bitcoin spot exchange traded fund (ETF). It would be the first crypto spot ETF in the United States, if it receives approval. According to the filing, Coinbase Custody Trust Company would be the custodian of the fund and Bank of New York Mellon would custody its fiat. The SEC has not approved a spot Bitcoin ETF so far despite numerous applicants. The world\u2019s first spot traded Bitcoin ETF was Canada\u2019s Purpose Bitcoin ETF, set up in early 2021.\n\nBinance CEO Changpeng Zhao denies rumors of selling Bitcoin to bolster BNB\n\nBinance CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao has refuted accusations that Binance has been secretly selling Bitcoin (BTC) to artificially stabilize the price of its BNB token. The rumors have come from several market commentators in the past days, accusing the exchange of intentionally manipulating the market to artificially inflate the value of BNB. CZ said that Binance had not sold any of its BTC or BNB, adding that the crypto exchange still held \u201ca bag\u201d of FTX Token \u2014 the native token of the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX.\n\nSEC\u2019s Gensler says BTC, ETH \u2018not securities\u2019 in a newly surfaced video\n\nA newly surfaced video from 2018 featuring Gary Gensler has made the rounds on social media, showing the now-chair of the U.S. securities regulator again stating that multiple cryptocurrencies are not securities. \u201cOver 70% of the crypto market is Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash. Why did I name those four? They\u2019re not securities,\u201d Gensler says in the video, which is understood to come from a 2018 event hosted by Bloomberg for institutional investors. At the time, Gensler was a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The video contrasts with his more recent actions as the chair of the SEC.\n\nBinance\u200b.US hires former SEC enforcement official amid lawsuit\n\nFormer SEC enforcement official George Canellos has reportedly been hired by Binance.US as part of the legal team defending the company against allegations of operating as an unregistered securities exchange. In response to the SEC\u2019s action on June 5, Binance.US announced the suspension of U.S. dollar deposits and the potential pausing of fiat withdrawals, citing \u201cextremely aggressive and intimidating tactics\u201d from regulators.

The price of USDT fell by 0.3% to around 0.997 as its weightage in the Curve 3pool increased to over 70% from the usual 33.1%.

        "content": "Bitcoin dipped on Monday morning in Asia after reclaiming the US$26,000 support level over the weekend. Ether also fell back, but held above US$1,700. XRP, Dogecoin and Litecoin were the only gainers among the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, while Tron\u2019s TRX led the losers. The U.S.-based crypto exchange Bakkt reportedly joined other trading platforms in delisting Polygon, Solana and Cardano after the U.S. regulator this month labelled them illegally issued financial securities. U.S. equity markets are closed Monday for a public holiday, but they could gain in the week ahead as economic data on Friday pointed to slowing inflation, while the first visit to China in almost five years by a top U.S. diplomat could be a positive for capital markets.\n\nBitcoin, Ether dip; XRP rises\n\nBitcoin fell 0.97% over the last 24 hours to US$26,308 at 07:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, but held onto a weekly gain of 1.58%, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency breached the US$26,000 level on Saturday to reach a seven-day high of US$26,769. The token had slumped to three-month lows at the end of last week.\n\nEther edged down 0.82% to US$1,716, logging a weekly loss of 2.18%.\n\nWith the exception of XRP, other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded lower in the past 24 hours. Polygon\u2019s Matic led the losers, slumping 3.22% to US$0.5971 and down 5.88% over the past seven days.\n\nNew York-based crypto exchange Bakkt has suspended trading of Polygon, Solana and Cardano tokens and plans to delist them, according to Fortune on Friday. Trading platforms such as Robinhood and eToro have also decided to delist multiple cryptocurrencies after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed lawsuits this month against Coinbase and Binance.US and named a long list of cryptocurrencies as securities that were issued and sold without SEC approval.\n\n\u201cBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were affected by increasingly changing sentiment toward crypto as traders could limit their risk-taking in the crypto market due to limited upside catalysts and particularly considering the legal risks in the US,\u201d said Wael Makarem, senior market strategist at trading platform Exness Group, in emailed comments.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe legal actions could scare away some investors from the market but could be relatively positive for Bitcoin\u2019s dominance against other cryptocurrencies. In this regard, Bitcoin has also been gaining ground against Ethereum,\u201d said Makarem.\n\nThe Bitcoin balance on crypto exchanges reached a three-month low of 2,281,978.198 tokens on Sunday, according to blockchain data tracker Glassnode, which reduced some selling pressure as investors normally move tokens to exchanges when they plan to sell.\n\nXRP logged gains for the past 24 hours, rising 1.01% to US$0.4859, but losing 6.34% for the week.\n\nFinTech firm Ripple Labs, whose crypto payment platform is powered by XRP, announced on Friday a partnership with Columbia\u2019s central bank to explore the use of blockchain technologies in the country\u2019s digital payment system.\n\nLast Friday, MakerDAO\u2019s stablecoin Dai replaced Binance USD (BUSD) as the third largest stablecoin by market cap. BUSD has seen its market cap falling over 10% in the past seven days, after the SEC issued charges against Binance on June 5, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap dipped 0.53% to US$1.07 trillion in the last 24 hours, while crypto trading volume fell 18.47% to US$19.69 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nEthereum NFT sales fall, Nike teases deal with Fortnite\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.16% to 2,878.56 in the 24 hours to 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index is down 4.80% for the seven days.\n\nNFT sales on Ethereum fell 20.61% in the past 24 hours to US$11.06 million, according to CryptoSlam data. Sales on the Bitcoin blockchain slid 44.71% to US$882,550.\n\n\u201cSales across Ethereum and Bitcoin continue to lose steam, and it\u2019s hard to say when this could turn around due to uncertainty with regulations and legal matters up in the air,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\nDespite the decline, Sotheby\u2019s NFT auction saw Ringers #879, an Ethereum-based NFT created by Canadian artist Dmitri Cherniak, sell for US$6.2 million on Friday, the second highest sale of a piece of generative art, or created using autonomous systems.\n\n\u201cSotheby\u2019s auction concluded and saw $10.9m in sales, over half of which was from the Ringers grail,\u201d said Petscher, \u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that the supposed buyer already a major NFT trader, so this auction didn\u2019t seem to draw attention from the traditional art world. Is it bullish still for NFT art? Yes, but there\u2019s still always concern that the NFT ecosystem is largely an echochamber.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, the U.S. sportswear giant Nike released a teaser on Saturday which appears to be an NFT collaboration with online video game Fortnite, which will be unveiled on June 20. .SWOOSH, Nike\u2019s Web 3.0 platform that issues NFT sneakers, also announced a partnership with sports video game publisher EA Sports earlier this month.\n\n\u201cA new innovation has reached Ethereum called ethscriptions, inspired by inscriptions on Bitcoin. This new process allows you to inscribe tiny images (under 96kb) on mostly any Ethereum transaction, thus allowing cheap on-chain image storage,\u201d said Petscher.\n\n\u201cThe innovation here is the ease of storing an image on-chain, which is typically avoided in standard contract storage due to the high cost. In just a few days nearly 200ETH of secondary volume has been transacted, most from a sold out 10k collection of Ethereum Punks.\u201d\n\nU.S. futures trade mixed\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures traded mixed as of 11:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 0.10%, the S&P 500 inched up 0.01%, while Nasdaq futures added 0.16%. The U.S. stock market is closed Monday for a public holiday and will open on Tuesday.\n\nThe three major U.S. stock indexes all closed lower on Friday but logged gains for the week, as investors sorted through mixed signals from economic data and comments from Federal Reserve officials on Friday.\n\nA survey by the University of Michigan on Friday showed consumers expect annual inflation of 3.3% over the next year, the lowest since March 2021, but still above the Federal Reserve\u2019s goal of annual inflation below 2%.\n\nFederal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller and Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Thomas Barkin said on Friday that more interest rate hikes might be required to fight inflation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing policy rates having some effects on parts of the economy. The labor market is still strong, but core-kind of inflation is just not moving and that\u2019s going to require probably some more tightening to try to get that going down,\u201d said Waller in his Friday speech.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will meet on July 26 to make its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5 and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 28.1% chance the Fed will keep rates unchanged in July, and a 71.9% chance for another 25-basis-point rate hike.\n\nMeanwhile in China, analysts expect the country\u2019s central bank to make a 10 basis-point cut to its one-year and five-year loan prime rates on Tuesday, lowering the rates to 3.55% and 4.20% as the country struggles with a slow post-Covid recovery, according to Reuters on Monday.\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"

Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nA Twitter user, citing data from on-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, said that Bitcoin\u2019s 30-day correlation coefficient with popular indices like Nasdaq and S&P 500 turned negative. In essence, this meant that when the price of BTC goes up, the price of the equities will fall and vice versa.\n\n? Look out folks, something's changing! Stocks and crypto are now mostly negatively correlated, meaning as one thrives, the other dives. Data from @intotheblock https://t.co/THDanxmnii pic.twitter.com/lXl7eHOhvt \u2014 Elite ?? (@eliteXBT) June 16, 2023\n\n\u201cDigital gold\u201d is finally here\n\nProponents of Bitcoin have long positioned it as the \u201csafe-haven asset,\u201d or an investment whose value is expected to be steady or even rise during economic downturns, similar to precious metals like Gold.\n\nTo be seen as an inflation hedge by investors, an asset must display significant decoupling from traditional markets. However, with the growing mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and other altcoins became more and more influenced by the geo-political and macroeconomic triggers that affect the mainstream market.\n\nBut this has started to change. The spate of banking collapses in March led investors to put their funds in the crypto market. Following this, the world\u2019s largest crypto by market cap, Bitcoin soared 52% until hitting its yearly peak in April, as per IntoTheBlock. On the other hand, equity indices were largely flat until that point.\n\nThe decoupling became even more pronounced in Q2 2023, as the crypto market in general and Bitcoin in particular entered a consolidation phase. The king coin fell even more as regulators in the United States became increasingly hostile.\n\nHowever, the tech stocks went the other way, resulting in a clear divergence in the growth trajectories of the two assets.\n\nIt\u2019s not only the equity markets with which BTC started to insulate itself. In recent months, the \u201cdigital gold\u201d has shown increased decoupling from its real-world counterpart, Gold [XAU] as well. Bitcoin grew faster in value than the precious metal since the banking crisis of March.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nVolatility starts to rise\n\nBTC exchanged hands at $26,561.18 at the time of writing. The coin gained nearly 4% in the last 24 hours, as per Santiment. Interestingly, after witnessing a protracted period of low volatility, BTC began to live up to its image of an unpredictable asset lately. The volatility increased following the recent legal actions on crypto behemoths by regulators."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA pricy Ethereum NFT from one of Web3\u2019s preeminent PFP collections has been permanently removed from circulation and symbolically tied to an Ordinals inscription, as a group of Bitcoiners celebrate the costly, eye-catching endeavor.\n\nCryptoPunk #8611 sold for around 55 Ethereum or $95,000 on Saturday, according to Etherescan. And hours later, the NFT was burned in a way that points to inscription 12,456,749, an NFT-like asset on Bitcoin that bears the same image as its predecessor.\n\nThe decision to effectively destroy CryptoPunk #8611 was a community-led effort conducted by Wolf Capital Developer Nathan Stein on Twitter and holders of Bitcoin Bandits, a Western-themed collection of Ordinals inscriptions, a spokesperson for the project told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe community rallied behind the idea like crazy,\u201d the Bitcoin Bandits spokesperson said, adding that around 150 people contributed to the cause.\n\nWhen a digital asset is burned, it\u2019s locked up for eternity in a digital wallet that nobody controls, and CryptoPunk #8611 has been put to rest in a well-known burn address that also contains $21 million worth of Ethereum.\n\n\u201cWhat a wild night,\u201d an account named Minh on Twitter told Decrypt, who also posted a video documenting the purchase and burning of CryptoPunk #8611. He described the move as \u201cchaotic, yet beautiful.\u201d\n\nOrdinals, a buzzy Bitcoin protocol that launched earlier this year, is used to create NFT-like assets on Bitcoin by \u201cinscribing\u201d data to individual satoshi, the smallest denomination of currency a Bitcoin can be broken down into. That data can include pictures, videos, or even plain text, which people have used to create BRC-20 tokens.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile NFTs could be considered a nascent industry or an emerging frontier for digital art, Ordinals inscriptions are much more new, leading to a wave of hype, bugs, and scams surrounding crypto\u2019s oldest coin.\n\nAs the community surrounding Ordinals continues to take shape, siphoning off pricy NFTs from the Ethereum space and pointing them in the direction of other assets on Bitcoin is becoming a more common move, referred to as teleburning.\n\nSo, if Saturday\u2019s CryptoPunk burn sounds somewhat familiar, that\u2019s because it\u2019s not the first time a pricy NFT has been burned by someone looking to symbolically shift an asset\u2019s underlying chain from Ethereum to Bitcoin.\n\nIn February, an NFT from the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection worth around $169,000 at the time was burned by Jason Williams, who told Decrypt not long after that, essentially, \u201cthrowing a Lamborghini into a trash compactor\u201d is kind of fun.\n\nNotably, Yuga Labs, creators of the Bored Ape Yacht Club, told Decrypt that the Ordinals inscription tied to Williams\u2019 BAYC NFT represents an illegitimate ape, explaining only tokens that come from the project's original smart contract are considered valid, granting holders commercial rights and access to events.\n\nHowever, unlike Williams\u2019 maneuver, CryptoPunk #8611 wasn\u2019t burned purely for entertainment, according to Stein.\n\nThe end goal is to create a series of Ordinals inscriptions that correspond to a slice of ownership in CryptoPunk #8611\u2014even though the underlying asset itself can no longer be owned by anyone on its original chain.\n\nThat collection of inscriptions will be created after the one that currently points to CryptoPunk #8611 is ceremonially sent to a digital wallet that belongs to Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, in what is effectively a one-way trip, Stein said in a tweet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPhase #2 1- Send money to escrow\n\n2- Escrow buys Punk for them\n\n3- Escrow burns & inscribes it on BTC\n\n4- Escrow sends the punk to Satoshis wallet Ok! Now we have burned Punk 2 times LMAO Whats next? \u2014 NatanStein (@natan_stein) June 16, 2023\n\nMembers of the Bitcoin Bandits community who pooled funds together to purchase CryptoPunk #8611 have also been entered into a contest related to a separate inscriptions project\u2014but that\u2019s beside the point, the spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cBandits did it more to show the way,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe Bandits Community thinks that CryptoPunks deserve better than ETH.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) plans by BlackRock appear to have sparked a rally in the \u201cOG\u201d institutional BTC investment vehicle.\n\nData from monitoring resource CoinGlass shows that on June 17, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) almost hit new 2023 highs.\n\nGBTC \u201cpremium\u201d heads below -37%\n\nBitcoin market sentiment showed a modest improvement late last week as news emerged that the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, had filed to launch a Bitcoin spot price exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nWhile still not allowed in the United States, a spot ETF from a stalwart entity such as BlackRock should have better chances of breaking the legal impasse, some say.\n\nIn the meantime, however, signs of optimism beyond sentiment are becoming clearer, with GBTC long trading at a major discount to BTC spot, which is on the way up.\n\nAccording to CoinGlass, that discount, or a negative \u201cpremium,\u201d used to characterize GBTC share prices, is currently at -36.6%.\n\nWhile still heavily discounted, GBTC thus trades closer to zero than at almost any time this year. On June 13, for example, the discount was closer to -44%.\n\nGBTC premium vs. asset holdings vs. BTC/USD chart (screenshot). Source: CoinGlass\n\n\u201cIf the Blackrock ETF does get approved, the real winner here is going to be $GBTC,\u201d Adam Cochran, a partner at venture capital firm Cinneamhain Ventures, wrote in part of Twitter commentary at the weekend.\n\n\u201cBecause Blackrock will show the path to conversion, and GBTC\u2019s 40%+ discount will resolve on top of industry growth.\u201d\n\nCochran said that he thought BlackRock\u2019s offering has \u201cgood odds\u201d of getting U.S. regulatory approval.\n\n\u201cVery different structure than other efforts by a behemoth who doesn\u2019t lose. \u201830 act redeemable trust w/ redemptions (unlike GBTC) + proposed rule change filing. They came to play,\u201d he added.\n\nARK yet to join latest buyers\n\nThe BlackRock move is already shrouded in controversy of its own, as market commentators spar over whether it is, in fact, an ETF at all.\n\nRelated: Why is the crypto market up today?\n\nSome argue that it will simply be a similar Trust to GBTC, while others, including Cochran, adopt a more nuanced view.\n\nOn the ETF vs Trust debate - plenty of ETFs have alt structures.\n\n\n\nThis is an ETF as a redeemable trust not like GBTC.\n\n\n\nThe Trust component is basically what let\u2019s them list shares that represent X amount of BTC since it\u2019s not processing units of BTC directly at a clearinghouse. \u2014 Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) June 16, 2023\n\n\u201cIT\u2019S OK TO CALL IT AN ETF GUYS,\u201d Cory Klippsten, CEO of Bitcoin financial services firm Swan, summarized.\n\n\u201cSecurities Act of 1933 filing under Form S-1, NOT Form N-1A (like 99% of stock ETFs). Will trade on exchange and be redeemable to the issuer. WAY better than GBTC. Now we\u2019ll wait to see if the SEC approves Blackrock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF.\u201d\n\nThat aside, investor interest in GBTC is rising as a result. Among the eager buyers is hedge fund North Rock Digital.\n\n\u201cWe have been accumulating more of the greyscale trusts consistently over the last several weeks,\u201d it announced post-BlackRock.\n\n\u201cRR seems massively skewed at current levels. 50% upside if Greyscale wins, which we expect, and minimal downside if they lose. This filing could be a catalyst to see them tighten to more rational levels.\u201d\n\nOne major holder yet to up exposure, meanwhile, is ARK Invest, which continues to hold around 5.37 million GBTC shares.\n\nData from Cathie\u2019s ARK \u2014 a dedicated tracking website for ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood \u2014 confirms those holdings gradually declining through 2023.\n\nARK Invest GBTC holdings chart (screenshot).

        "content": "Bitcoin prices rise despite traders taking short positions.\n\nBTC options expiry, bullish sentiment, and market volatility impact Bitcoin\u2019s performance.\n\nBitcoin has experienced notable volatility in recent times, driving many traders to hold short positions against the cryptocurrency. However, despite this, BTC\u2019s prices have started to rise again, potentially favoring bullish sentiment.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nBulls vs Bears\n\nAccording to CryptoQuant founder and analyst Kim Young Ju, the surge in BTC prices over the past few days has primarily been driven by direct purchases of Bitcoin through perpetual swaps, a type of derivative contract. Nevertheless, it appears that short positions taken by bears have not been liquidated at this point.\n\n#Bitcoin short squeeze hasn't happened. Most perpetual swap buying volume came from pure $BTC purchases, not forced short liquidations. More bullets for bulls.https://t.co/gkt9JiizM3 pic.twitter.com/xxYbi0DmvD \u2014 Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) June 16, 2023\n\nThis suggests that the current rise in Bitcoin\u2019s price may not have been substantial enough to trigger the closure of short positions, or that short sellers are still holding onto their positions despite the potential losses incurred.\n\nIf Bitcoin\u2019s price continues to climb, these lingering short positions may eventually get liquidated, resulting in a short squeeze scenario. A short squeeze occurs when the price of an asset sharply rises, forcing short sellers to cover their positions by buying back the asset. This buying pressure can amplify the price surge, triggering further short-covering and potentially significant price spikes.\n\nTraders \u201cPut\u201d their chips in one basket\n\nRecent data from GreeksLive highlights that approximately 25,000 BTC options are set to expire soon. The Put Call Ratio, standing at 0.73, indicates a higher number of bullish positions in the market.\n\nThe maximum pain point, at $26,000, represents the price level where option holders would face the most significant financial loss. The total notional value of these options amounts to $650 million, reflecting the underlying value of BTC options contracts.\n\nFurthermore, market data reveals that the withdrawal of market makers and reduced liquidity has heightened the risk of recent price fluctuations. However, this situation also presents a unique opportunity for investors.\n\nCurrently, buyers are benefitting from low implied volatilities (IVs) in various significant terms, offering favorable value for their investments. Notably, large whales and institutions are actively engaging in the purchase of options, demonstrating confidence in the market.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nIn terms of other aspects within the network, the data indicates that inscriptions are following the familiar boom-bust cycle often associated with crypto meme coins. This information can assist ordinal and NFT investors in better-predicting market cycles for inscriptions and ordinals in the long run."

        "title": "Bitcoin bulls look to re-establish control \u2014 Will BNB, LTC, OKB and QNT follow? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The bears lost an opportunity when they failed to sustain Bitcoin (BTC) below the $25,000 level this week. That may have attracted buying from the bulls who are attempting to start a recovery in Bitcoin and select altcoins.\n\nAdditionally, BlackRock\u2019s application to launch a Bitcoin spot price exchange-traded fund and the sustained strength in the United States equities markets may have helped improve crypto sentiment. Bitcoin is on track to finish the week with a minor gain of 2% and institutional buying in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust reduced its discount to Bitcoin spot from 44% on June 13 to 36.6%, according to CoinGlass data.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nAlthough Bitcoin and select altcoins are trying to start a relief rally, the overall trend remains bearish. Therefore, short-term traders who buy for a pullback should consider booking profits or tightening their stops when the price struggles to break above stiff resistance levels.\n\nThe strategy may be different for long-term investors who may use the dips to strong support levels to acquire the cryptocurrencies of their choice. It is prudent to adopt a staggered buying approach as a runaway rally is unlikely.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the top five cryptocurrencies that are trying to start a recovery in the short term.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin turned up sharply on June 15, trapping the aggressive bears who may have gone short on a break below $25,250. That may have caused a short squeeze in the near term, which propelled the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($26,403).\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears are trying to limit the relief rally at the 20-day EMA but a positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground. This suggests that the buyers are holding on to their positions in anticipation of a move higher.\n\nHowever, the bears are likely to have other plans as they will try to offer stiff resistance in the zone between the 20-day EMA and the resistance line of the descending channel. If the price turns down from this zone, the BTC/USDT pair may remain inside the channel for a while longer.\n\nBut if bulls drive the price above the channel, the pair will signal a potential trend change in the near term. The pair could then surge toward $31,000.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-EMA on the four-hour chart has turned up and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the positive area, indicating that bulls have the upper hand in the near term. There is a minor resistance at $26,850, but if that is crossed, the pair may reach the resistance line of the channel near $27,600. This level may prove to be a difficult hurdle for the bulls to cross, but if they manage to do that, the pair could rally to $28,500.\n\nThis positive view will invalidate in the short term if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-EMA. That could pull the price down to the 50-simple moving average and eventually to the strong support zone between $25,250 and $24,800. A break below this zone may intensify selling.\n\nBNB price analysis\n\nBNB (BNB) has been in the thick of things for the past few days, but a positive sign is that the bulls did not allow the price to break the $220 support. This indicates demands at lower levels.\n\nBNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe first resistance on the upside is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $252.50. If this level is scaled, the BNB/USDT pair may reach the 20-day EMA ($261). The bears will try to halt the recovery at this level. If they succeed, the pair may turn down toward $220.\n\nOn the contrary, if bulls propel the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could reach the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $272.50. This is a crucial level for the bears to defend because if it gives way, the pair may soar toward $305.\n\nBNB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the moving averages have completed a bullish crossover, and the RSI has risen into the positive zone. This indicates that buyers are attempting a comeback. The bulls will have to overcome the barrier at $252.50 to gain strength. The pair could then rally to $265.\n\nOn the downside, the first support is at the 20-EMA. If this level breaks down, the pair could slip to the uptrend line. A break and close below this level will indicate that the bulls have given up. The pair could then retest the critical support at $220.\n\nLitecoin price analysis\n\nLitecoin (LTC) plunged below the symmetrical triangle pattern on June 10, indicating that bears have the upper hand. The sellers pulled the price below the immediate support at $75 on June 14 but could not build upon this move.\n\nLTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe sharp recovery in the past few days has pushed the LTC/USDT pair back above $75. This shows strong buying at lower levels. The bulls will next try to push the price to the 20-day EMA ($82), which is an important level to keep an eye on. If buyers clear this hurdle, the pair may rise to the 50-day SMA ($86).\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level or the 20-day EMA and breaks below $70, it will signal the start of the downtrend. The first stop is likely to be $65 and then $60.\n\nLTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe strong recovery pushed the price above the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart, suggesting that the selling pressure is reducing. The moving averages are on the verge of completing a bullish crossover and the RSI has jumped into the positive territory, indicating that buyers are attempting a comeback.\n\nThere is a minor resistance at $80 but if bulls overcome this obstacle, the pair may accelerate to $85 and thereafter to $90. If bears want to prevent the up-move, they will have to quickly yank the price back below $75.\n\nRelated: Binance sends cease and desist notice to fraudulent Nigerian entity\n\nOKB price analysis\n\nOKB (OKB) broke below the symmetrical triangle pattern on June 10, signaling the start of a deeper correction. A minor positive for the bulls is that they successfully defended the support at $30.50, indicating demand at lower levels.\n\nOKB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe price has reached the 20-day EMA ($42.73), which is an important level to watch out for. If the price turns down from the current level, it will suggest that the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies. That could pose a serious threat to the $38.50 support. If this level gives way, the OKB/USDT pair may skid to $35 and eventually to $30.\n\nContrarily, if buyers thrust the price above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bears may be losing their grip. The pair could then rise to the support line, which is likely to act as a formidable resistance. Buyers will have to kick the price above $48 to gain the upper hand.\n\nOKB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe pair bounced off $38.50 with vigor but is facing resistance near $42.39. A minor positive in favor of the buyers is that the moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI is in the positive territory.\n\nIf buyers thrust the price above $42.39, the pair may pick up momentum and soar to $46 where the bears are again expected to mount a strong defense.\n\nAnother possibility is that the price turns down and tumbles below the 20-EMA. That may indicate a possible range-bound action between $38.50 and $42.39 for some time.\n\nQuant price analysis\n\nQuant (QNT) rebounded off the $95 level with strength on June 16, indicating aggressive buying at the support.\n\nQNT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nHowever, the bears have not yet given up and they are fiercely defending the downtrend line. Sellers will try to sink the price below $95 while the bulls will try to maintain the QNT/USDT pair above it.\n\nIf the price turns up from $95 once again, it will enhance the prospects of a rally above the downtrend line. If that happens, the pair may start a strong recovery that could catapult the price to $135.\n\nThis positive view could invalidate in the near term if the price continues lower and plummets below $95. The pair may then slip to $87 and subsequently to $80.\n\nQNT/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the pair quickly gave back a major portion of its gains, indicating that bears are active at higher levels. They pulled the price below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $103.90, which is a negative sign.\n\nBuyers will have to quickly drive the price back above the moving averages if they want to have another shot at the downtrend line. Alternatively, if the price sustains below the 50-SMA, the likelihood of a drop to $95 increases.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Is Ethereum (ETH) Proof of Stake Earning More Profitable Than Bitcoin (BTC) Mining? Collateral Network Up 28% - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "In the ever-evolving crypto market, Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) continue to dominate headlines. However, a new player, Collateral Network, is making waves with its upcoming COLT presale. This article delves into the recent developments of these three projects, shedding light on their potential profitability and growth.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum (ETH): A New Era of Tokenized Securities\n\nThe crypto giant, Ethereum, is on the news recently due to developments regarding tokenized security. This may give it an advantage over its competitor, Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been a hot topic in the crypto world. Known for its smart contract functionality, Ethereum has been instrumental in the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and the DeFi sector.\n\nRecently, Ethereum made headlines when a subsidiary of the Bank of China launched the first-ever tokenized security on the Ethereum blockchain. This marked a significant milestone for Ethereum, demonstrating its potential to revolutionize the financial sector.\n\nIn the past month, Ethereum developers have also been planning for the next hard fork, dubbed \u2018Dencun.\u2019 This upgrade is expected to bring about significant improvements to the Ethereum network, further solidifying its position in the crypto market.\n\nThe launch of the tokenized security and the upcoming hard fork align with the article\u2019s title, suggesting that Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Stake could indeed be more profitable than Bitcoin mining.\n\nBitcoin (BTC): Bracing for CPI Volatility\n\nThe largest crypto out there, Bitcoin, is facing news of mining that may affect the profitability of the coin.\n\nBitcoin, the pioneer of cryptocurrencies, has had its fair share of ups and downs. Despite facing its first monthly drop of 2023, Bitcoin remains a strong contender in the crypto market.\n\nRecent developments have seen Bitcoin traders bracing for Consumer Price Index (CPI) volatility. This comes as Bitcoin faces numerous resistance levels. However, this volatility never came, and despite record-low inflation, Bitcoin didn\u2019t budge.\n\nThese developments indicate that Bitcoin mining could face challenges in terms of profitability, especially when compared to Ethereum.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCollateral Network (COLT): A New Dawn in Crypto Lending\n\nCollateral Network, an Ethereum web3 peer-to-peer lending platform, is set to disrupt the lending industry. This innovative project allows users to unlock liquidity against physical assets on the blockchain, such as jewelry, watches, properties, vintage cars, and artwork.\n\nCollateral Network offers a wide range of benefits. For lenders, these include a weekly passive income, tangible assets as collateral, and security in case of loan default. For borrowers, Collateral Network offers fast turnaround, privacy, transparency, low cost, and borderless transactions.\n\nAdditionally, owners of the $COLT token will have access to our exclusive online auctions for distressed assets. These give investors the chance to buy properties below market value when a borrower defaults on a loan. Some of these auctions will also be in the metaverse.\n\nAnalysts predict a significant price surge for the COLT token. With an initial starting price of $0.001, the token will increase by 3500% during the presale, potentially reaching $0.35. Furthermore, the token will surge by 100x when it lists on major exchanges. Currently, the COLT token has increased its price up to $0.168.\n\nThese predictions, coupled with the platform\u2019s innovative approach to lending, suggest that Collateral Network could indeed be a game-changer in the crypto market.\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://presale.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"
