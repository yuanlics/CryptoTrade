        "title": "10 Factors That Are Influencing Bitcoin Value - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "10 factors that influence Bitcoin value are listed in this article, supply and demand is the primary factor.\n\nBitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency that has experienced significant volatility since its inception in 2009. The value of Bitcoin is influenced by several factors that can cause fluctuations in its price. Here are ten factors that influence Bitcoin value:\n\n1. Supply and Demand: Similar to other currencies and assets, the basic economic principle of supply and demand plays a crucial role in determining Bitcoin\u2019s price. The scarcity of Bitcoin, with a maximum supply of 21 million, and the increasing demand for it are factors that can influence its value.\n\n2. Institutional Adoption: As more institutions and companies adopt Bitcoin, its value can increase. The involvement of large corporations such as Tesla and MicroStrategy has already had a positive impact on Bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\n3. Regulatory Changes: Any changes in government regulations or policies that impact Bitcoin\u2019s use or acceptance can affect its value. News of potential regulation or crackdowns on cryptocurrencies can lead to a drop in their price.\n\n4. News and Market Sentiment: Bitcoin\u2019s value can also be influenced by market sentiment and the media\u2019s portrayal of it. Positive news, such as a major company accepting Bitcoin as payment, can increase its value, while negative news can decrease its value.\n\n5. Technological Advancements: Bitcoin is based on blockchain technology, and advancements in this field can impact its value. Improvements in the network\u2019s speed and efficiency can increase demand for Bitcoin, while technical problems can lead to a drop in its value.\n\n6. Integration with Other Technologies: Bitcoin\u2019s integration with other technologies, such as the Lightning Network, can increase its utility and value.\n\n7. Energy Consumption: The high energy consumption required for Bitcoin mining is a factor that can impact its value. News of increased regulation or pressure on Bitcoin miners to become more energy-efficient can lead to a drop in its value.\n\n8. Security Concerns: Any security concerns or hacking incidents involving Bitcoin can lead to a decrease in its value.\n\n9. Competition: The rise of other cryptocurrencies can also impact Bitcoin\u2019s value. If a new cryptocurrency gains popularity and acceptance, it can reduce demand for Bitcoin and decrease its value.\n\n10. Economic and Political Stability: Bitcoin\u2019s value can also be impacted by global economic and political instability. In times of economic uncertainty or political turmoil, Bitcoin may be viewed as a safe haven asset and see an increase in value. However, in times of stability, its value may decrease.\n\nOne of the primary reasons why cryptocurrency is influenced by external factors is because it is not yet widely adopted and integrated into the global financial system. It is still a relatively new and emerging asset class, and as such, its value can be more volatile and subject to market sentiment and news than established assets. Additionally, cryptocurrency is often subject to regulatory changes and policy decisions made by governments and financial institutions. News of potential regulatory action or crackdowns on cryptocurrencies can lead to a drop in their price.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "ONTARIO, CANADA, March 04, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Every day in the crypto sector is marked by the advent of innovation. A recent innovation that has taken the crypto sphere by storm is the \u2018Ordinals\u2019. Within months of its inception, this unique invention has managed to allure a plethora of investors.\n\nIn January 2023, a renowned software engineer, Casey Rodarmor revived the lost glory of Bitcoin when he deployed the Ordinals Protocol on the Bitcoin Network. With this protocol, users can now create Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the platform. In simple words, Ordinals can be called \u2018Bitcoin NFTs\u2019.\n\nOrdinal Dogecoin, the first-ever real memecoin on the Bitcoin blockchain, is pleased to announce to the oDOGE community that $oDOGE Emblem Vault has successfully acquired Ordinal Inscription #5768, the true first-ever DOGE on Bitcoin, in an OTC trade for the value of 10BTC in $oDOGE tokens, facilitated by a well-known Bitcoin OG and OTC intermediary.\n\nThe acquisition, which is the second-highest Ordinal sale to date, solidifies the $oDOGE token's place in Bitcoin blockchain and memecoin history and is expected to fuel its growth and popularity in the coming months, forever marking a new era of Bitcoin meme culture.\n\nOrdinal Inscription #5768, the first DOGE Ordinal EVER (as well as an extremely low mint Ordinal)\n\nOrdinal Inscription #5768 will be held forever at the Emblem Vault address with the $oDOGE Logo Ordinal.\n\nWhat does this mean for $oDOGE?\n\nWith the latest breakthrough, Ordinal Technology is expected to gain greater traction in the blockchain community, and $oDOGE is leading the way as a distinctive feature coin that is safe for mining, much like other well-known cryptocurrencies from JPEGs on Bitcoin and memecoin on Bitcoin Original. The blockchain compensates miners for their efforts by generating new Dogecoin each day.\n\nThe acquisition of the first ever DOGE ordinal for 10BTC by $oDOGE is a significant milestone in the development of the crypto sphere. It solidifies $oDOGE's place in Bitcoin and meme coin history, and the team behind the token is committed to continuing to innovate and provide new features that meet the needs of its growing community.\n\nA Quick Overview of oDOGE\n\nThe Ordinals Protocol, which was recently deployed on the Bitcoin Network, allows users to create non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the platform. With the Ordinals Protocol, the $oDOGE token combines conventional and smart contracts on Ethereum to unlock the power of Bitcoin and create a distinctive feature coin that is gaining popularity in the crypto sphere.\n\nThe $oDOGE token has been fully fractionalized, wrapped, and integrated as an ERC-721 or ERC-20 token, allowing dApps and DEXes on ETH Miannet to interact with the original $oDOGE.\n\nMoreover, Ordinal $oDOGE tokenomics is used to provide the token for tax and start liquidity. The token supply consists of 1,000,000,000,000,000 $oDOGand the users will pay a 0% tax while buying or selling $oDOGE.\n\nIn a quick recap of the first 5 days of oDOGE\u2019s launch, 50% of the supply has been burnt, and 15 ETH in BURNED LP. $oDOGE saw a total of $30 million+ daily volume, with the total number of $oDOGE holders reaching 1,020.\n\noDODE has been gaining huge support from Bitcoin OGs, Memecoin OGs, and several blockchain influencers, and the oDOGE community is growing every day. Furthermore, with upcoming partnerships and marketing plans in the pipeline, oDOGE is set to reach newer heights in the coming weeks.\n\nAbout the Project - Ordinal Dogecoin\n\nOrdinal Dogecoin is a newly designed original memecoin created by combining ordinal and smart contracts on Ethereum. The ordinal technology unlocked the true potential of the Bitcoin Network in the way of $oDOGE. The $oDOGE is gaining popularity because of its unique features and secure transaction. It is designed by combining ordinal and smart contracts on Ethereum, which is entirely facilitated on the Bitcoin Blockchain.\n\nFurthermore, potential investors and cryptocurrency enthusiasts interested in Ordinal Dogecoin can visit the project\u2019s official website or check out their social platforms for more details.\n\nWebsite | Twitter | Telegram | Medium | Uniswap | DEXTools Chart\n\n\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThe information provided in this release is not investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "title": "What Ordinal NFTs Mean for Bitcoin \u2013 BRINK \u2013 Conversations and Insights on Global Business - BRINK",
        "content": "Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images\n\nThe Bitcoin community is in turmoil. Ordinal NFTs \u2014 also referred to as \u201cDigital Artifacts\u201d and \u201cOrdinal inscriptions\u201d \u2014 surfaced on January 21, 2023, on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin maximalists are furious \u2014 they believe NFTs are spamming and attacking the Bitcoin network. Other Bitcoin enthusiasts argue that Ordinal NFTs make the Bitcoin network not only more fun but also can help generate more revenues for Bitcoin miners.\n\nBitcoin is now home to 100,000+ Ordinal NFTs, including a playable DOOM game clone, and JPEGS of \u201cTaproot Wizards,\u201d \u201cAstral Babes,\u201d and \u201cOrdinal Punks.\u201d\n\nHeated debate has primarily focused on whether Ordinal NFTs are a positive or negative development for the Bitcoin network. The answer depends on whether one believes Bitcoin should be purely a monetary system or serve multiple use cases.\n\nWhether one loves or hates them, the fact is that Ordinal NFTs exist and will continue to be minted on the Bitcoin network \u2014 in the absence of a soft or hard fork.\n\nGiven that Ordinal NFTs have arrived, what do they mean for Bitcoin? Here are my thoughts on three implications:\n\nBlockchain upgrades can bring significant, unintended consequences. Ordinal NFTs could pose a threat to Bitcoin as a medium of exchange and as a store of value. Bitcoin is decentralized in technology and decision-making \u2014 especially because Satoshi Nakamoto has disappeared.\n\nA Brief History of Bitcoin NFTs\n\nImmortalizing non-monetary data (e.g., JPEGs, video files, etc.) on the Bitcoin network is not new. In fact, the Genesis block \u2014 the very first Bitcoin block ever created by pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto included a message: \u201cThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\u201d\n\nBuying/selling immortalized data is also not new to Bitcoin. Counterparty NFTs are an example of Bitcoin-based NFTs that have existed since 2014.\n\nBut three technical features distinguish Ordinal NFTs from previously existing Bitcoin NFTs: 1) content size limit 2) content storage and security 3) cost to mint (i.e., create an NFT).\n\nTwo soft-fork upgrades enabled these net new technical features on the Bitcoin network.\n\nThe SegWit upgrade in 2017 increased the total data that a block could carry to 4MB and created a cheaper category of data The Taproot upgrade in 2021 which enabled the mechanism by which content attached to Ordinal NFTs gets published to the Bitcoin network.\n\nImplication 1: Blockchain upgrades can bring significant, unintended consequences\n\nWithout both Segwit and Taproot upgrades, it would not be possible to upload 4MB of content completely and relatively cheaply onto the Bitcoin network.\n\nYet, the motivations behind the Segwit and Taproot upgrades were far from seeking to enable anything akin to Ordinal NFTs.\n\nSome have dismissed Ordinal NFTs as \u201cnothing new, Bitcoin goes on\u201d since uploading non-monetary content to the Bitcoin network has always been possible \u2014 since the Genesis block.\n\nThese critics are missing the point. Bitcoin NFTs prior to Ordinal NFTs did not achieve mass popularity, at least partly because they were too expensive to mint, and only up to 80 bytes of content could be stored on the Bitcoin blockchain itself. This meant that NFT enthusiasts were incentivized to turn to other blockchains, such as Ethereum, where they faced less restrictive content size (compared to 80 bytes) and fee limitations when minting NFTs. This incentive no longer exists with Ordinal NFTs due to the three new technical features outlined above in Figure 1. Today, more content can be immortalized and secured per NFT on Bitcoin than on other blockchains, including Ethereum, for significantly reduced fees.\n\nImplication 2: Ordinal NFTs could pose a threat to Bitcoin as a medium of exchange and as a store of value\n\nBitcoin maximalists are furious about Ordinal NFTs because they believe that the sole purpose of Bitcoin should be to serve as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, as articulated in Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s whitepaper. Ordinal NFTs attack this vision as they take up block space that would otherwise be used for financial transactions, increase the bandwidth required to operate a full Bitcoin node, and drive up transaction fees for financial transactions on the Bitcoin network.\n\nOrdinal NFT proponents argue that the Bitcoin network can be used by anyone for anything, including funny JPEGs, so long as they can pay the associated transaction fees. After all, the Bitcoin protocol itself permits uploading non-financial content for a price.\n\nIf Ordinal NFTs gain and maintain popularity, they will compete with financial transactions for space on the Bitcoin network. Given the increased demand for block space, the transaction fees needed to transact on Bitcoin will increase. Transaction fees have generally increased since Ordinal NFTs were launched on January 21. Increased transaction fees harm some but benefit others. Those who rely on Bitcoin\u2019s historically low transaction fees \u2014 for example, those who send Bitcoin to send remittances \u2014 will be negatively impacted. Benefit will accrue to other stakeholders, including Bitcoin miners, whose revenues rely partly on transaction fees.\n\nAll else equal, increased transaction fees can threaten Bitcoin\u2019s viability as an everyday medium of monetary exchange in the shorter term. Some would argue that layer 2 solutions, such as the Lightning Network, already solve this potential threat to Bitcoin as a medium of exchange. Yet, layer 2 solutions offer less decentralization and security than the Bitcoin network.\n\nIn the longer term, Bitcoin as a store of monetary value may be at risk. Practically anyone can upload anything up to 4MB to the Bitcoin network for a price that many are willing to pay \u2014 this could run the whole gamut of funny videos, child pornography, confidential documents, how-to guides banned by governments, etc. In particular, if Bitcoin is associated with immortalizing illegal content in significant volumes, Bitcoin\u2019s perceived legitimacy as a legal monetary system will be put to the test.\n\nImplication 3: Bitcoin is decentralized in technology and decision-making \u2014 especially because Satoshi Nakamoto has disappeared\n\nExtreme emotions abound in the \u201cOrdinal NFTs, good or bad for Bitcoin?\u201d debate.\n\nYet, no one can unilaterally take any action.\n\nThe current conflict between Bitcoin maximalists and Ordinal NFT proponents \u2014 where arguments are vehement and actions are curtailed \u2014 reflects Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature, not only in technology but also in decision-making.\n\nThe decentralized nature of decision-making in the Bitcoin community is likely only possible due to the disappearance of Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThe debate about the legitimate use cases of the Bitcoin network has existed since the beginning. In 2009, Nakamoto explicitly indicated their belief that Bitcoin should be used for financial transactions and that financial and non-financial use cases should not mix on a blockchain network (see Figure 2).\n\nA counterfactual scenario to consider: If Nakamoto were still present today, their voice and reason would likely hold significant sway over the Bitcoin community, similar to how Vitalik Buterin\u2019s voice and reason hold weight in the Ethereum community.\n\nBitcoin As Money Is At Stake\n\nRelated Reading Is the Metaverse Dying Already? NFTs: 4 Insights to Capitalize on a Multibillion-Dollar Market How Will Web3 Impact the Future of Work? Purchasing the Metaverse \u2014 How Does It Work?\n\nBitcoin upgrades are highly technical. Translating these highly technical changes precisely and comprehensively into non-technical terms is often challenging. It is incumbent on technical and non-technical Bitcoin stakeholders to work together to think through not only the intended implications for blockchain operations but also the potentially inadvertent implications that often result from a complex web of incentive structures. Thinking through potential unintended consequences is particularly important in a decentralized system, where achieving majority consensus to do \u2014 and undo \u2014 actions is incredibly difficult.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Ordinal NFTs will seriously compete with financial transactions on the Bitcoin network. One thing is clear \u2014 resources to develop the Bitcoin network are limited. When competing priorities exist, no single priority can get full attention.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Metaverse Musings on Substack"

        "title": "Controversy Behind new Ordinal Bitcoin NFTs - Tekedia",
        "content": "Ordinal Bitcoin NFTs have two key features that distinguish them from others. Firstly, they are made up of on-chain data, meaning the actual image for the NFT is stored directly on the blockchain, rather than being linked to an external website like most NFTs on Ethereum.\n\nThis makes them unique and more secure, as the data cannot be lost or altered without affecting the blockchain itself. Eric Wall, a Swedish researcher and former Arcane Assets CIO, believes that storing fully on-chain NFTs is now seven times cheaper on Bitcoin compared to Ethereum.\n\nSecondly, NFTs are linked to individual satoshis, unlike Ethereum NFTs, which have their own token. This creates a connection between the NFT and the underlying asset, Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, it can be challenging to maintain this connection because Bitcoins are fungible, meaning each one is interchangeable and can only be differentiated through a complex transaction input-output system.\n\nTo solve this issue, Ordinals uses a shared numbering system that assigns every satoshi an ordinal number based on the order in which it was mined. This numbering system, along with other details, is used to maintain continuity for NFTs.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Bitcoin does not natively support these features, and NFT holders may accidentally spend their NFTs on transaction fees if they are not careful.\n\nThe world of crypto, DeFi, blockchain, NFTs etc is a very community-focused space. And with every new development, the community ferociously discusses their opinions of it.\n\nThe supporters of the project suggest that it will have an overall favourable impact on the Bitcoin ecosystem. They believe that the integration of NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain is a positive development that will bring more fees and use cases to the chain. This view is held by prominent Bitcoin influencer Dan Held, who argues that every transaction paying its fee is not spam and that the Bitcoin blockchain is open and accessible for anyone to build upon.\n\nSome individuals believe that incorporating NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain will negatively impact its financial and transactional use case. The CEO of Blockstream Adam Back, who is rumoured to be Satoshi Nakamoto, is a part of this group. He supports this argument and has suggested that Bitcoin users must \u201ceducate and encourage developers who care about bitcoin\u2019s use-case to either not do that, or do it in a prunable space-efficient e.g. time-stamp way.\u201d\n\nHe also took to Twitter to express his views on the project. He said that \u201c\u201dyou can\u2019t stop them\u201d well of course Bitcoin is designed to be censor resistant. doesn\u2019t stop us mildly commenting on the sheer waste and stupidity of an encoding, at least do something efficient. Otherwise it\u2019s another proof of the consumption of block-space thingy.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Casey Rodarmor responded to the criticism with the following arguments,\n\nI actually love the haters,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, they do more to drive people to find out about the project than anybody else. I don\u2019t know what they think when they have these massive audiences, and they go, \u2018This is an attack on Bitcoin\u2019\u2014it seems like you don\u2019t want to do that if you don\u2019t want people to use the thing.\n\nHe also added counterpoints that stated\n\n\u201cMy design goal, from the beginning, was to create something that would strike people as being Bitcoin native. That means it can\u2019t have a token, and it can\u2019t be a sidechain. One thing that people don\u2019t understand is that in order for Bitcoin to be secure, blocks must be full\u2014that is part of the Bitcoin security model,\u201d he said. \u201cIf blocks are not full, nobody has any reason to pay more than the minimum fee rate to have their transactions included. So, as a result, blocks must be full.\u201d\n\nThe hype surrounding the Ordinals NFT has driven the price of the Stacks cryptocurrency (STX) up nearly 200% as of February. Ordinal NFTs, which are similar to Ethereum and other smart contract-based NFTs, use the smallest unit of bitcoin, the satoshi, to encode digital art, profile pictures, videos, audios and images directly on the bitcoin blockchain.\n\n\u201cThe full potential of the Stacks network is beginning to be recognized which could drive the STX token rally even further,\u201d Thielen said.\n\nThe NFT craze has faded in recent months amid the bitcoin, ethereum, and crypto price crash that wiped off nearly $2 trillion from the combined crypto market. The merger of NFTs and the bitcoin network provides greater security, transparency, and traceability, opening up more use cases and rekindling interest around NFTs.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

        "content": "In a \u201cbase case\u201d scenario, Galaxy Digital\u2019s research unit has tipped the burgeoning Bitcoin nonfungible token (NFT) market to hit a $4.5 billion market cap by March 2025.\n\nBitcoin NFTs, or Ordinals, have attracted significant attention since the Ordinals protocol launched in late January, enabling users to inscribe data such as images, PDFs, video and audio onto individual satoshis \u2014 each representing 0.00000001 Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nNFT giants such as Yuga Labs have even jumped in on the hype. On Feb. 28, the $4 billion firm behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club announced a Bitcoin-based NFT project dubbed \u201cTwelveFold\u201d in a notable recognition of the Ordinals movement.\n\nIn a new report published on March 3, Galaxy researchers analyzed the potential growth of Bitcoin NFTs, making estimations \u201cconservatively based on the current size of Ethereum\u2019s NFT market\u201d and its growth rate over the past few years.\n\n\u201cWhile there are notable differences between inscriptions and NFTs, it\u2019s fair to say that a native on-chain ecosystem for NFTs has emerged on Bitcoin in a way that was never before possible, and its usage has been exploding.\u201d\n\nThe report provided three market cap predictions based on the firm\u2019s analysis, covering bear, base and bull case scenarios.\n\nLooking at Galaxy\u2019s baseline analysis, the report outlined that if Bitcoin NFTs can \u201cexpand to mainstream NFT culture like PFPs [Profile Pictures], memes and utility projects,\u201d the market capitalization should increase to $4.5 billion.\n\nThe researchers also noted that the projection of $4.5 billion is also based on the \u201crapid development in inscription awareness coupled with the marketplace/wallet infrastructure already out today.\u201d\n\nFantastic research piece by @intangiblecoins at @galaxyhq on the rise of Bitcoin Ordinals:\n\n\n\n- $4.5B base case market\n\n- Help with Bitcoin's fee market\n\n- Increase the design space for smart contracts\n\n\n\nRead more here \u2014 Dan Held (@danheld) March 3, 2023\n\nIn a bear case, in which Bitcoin NFTs don\u2019t creep into the mainstream NFT market and pry market share away from Ethereum, Galaxy estimated that Bitcoin NFTs can still reach a market cap of $1.5 billion based on the current level of interest and supporting infrastructure.\n\nRelated: Total crypto market cap takes a hit amid Silvergate Bank crisis\n\nOn the bullish side of things, Galaxy researchers estimate that the Bitcoin NFT market could reach around $10 billion if it provides strong competition to Ethereum NFTs while providing unique use cases.\n\nEstimated Bitcoin NFT market cap. Source: Galaxy Digital\n\nAt the time of the report, more than 250,000 Ordinals have hit the market. Highlighting the significance and utility of Bitcoin NFTs, the researchers noted that:\n\n\u201cThe addition of sizeable data storage with strong availability assurances opens up a variety of use cases, many of which are only beginning to be explored, including things like new types of decentralized software or Bitcoin scaling techniques. Even the NFT use case alone, though, has the potential to dramatically widen the scope of Bitcoin\u2019s cultural impact.\u201d"

        "content": "The year 2022 was nothing short of a catastrophic year for digital assets, with the crypto world caught up in the chaos of one of the industry\u2019s largest scams. One of the biggest crypto exchanges FTX was a two-week nightmare that experts and analysts predicted will damage and have a long-term effect on crypto users around the world. Albeit, as we just start the month of March, crypto investors may be able to breathe a sigh of relief. Because since January a few coins have been experiencing a bullish-like trend, which crypto enthusiasts hope will continue.\n\nAs crypto users want to invest in the market\u2019s more established digital assets, a \u2018big-eyed\u2019 feline is purring away and grabbing the attention of investors. Because of its enticing features and advantages for investors, Big Eyes Coin (BIG) is becoming more and more well-known.\n\nNonetheless, several well-known cryptocurrencies had a difficult 2022 as a result of the collapse of the FTX exchange. In this challenging time, new cryptocurrencies like Big Eyes Coin saw great improvements.\n\nMake BIG Returns with Big Eyes Coin Loot Boxes\n\nA meme coin project called Big Eyes Coin (BIG) seeks to bolster the crypto market by bringing wealth and more users. It is a cat meme coin that aims to become accepted on the Ethereum blockchain and offer more benefits to its community. Big Eyes Coin is a DeFi solution that promises to combine exchanges, liquidity pool purchases, staking, and other features like NFTs and the metaverse. Since the start of its presale, the meme coin has raised a sizable sum of money and has already gained widespread attention.\n\nLoot boxes will be available for the Big Eyes Coin community. Several adventure-style video games feature mystery boxes called loot boxes. These may be used to unlock new in-game goods, weapons, or clothes. They come randomly when playing a game.\n\nA fortunate member of the BIG community might win up to $100,000 in tokens from one of the three available loot boxes, which are all filled with $HUGE tokens. Today a fourth box has been launched called the \u201cExcali-Paw Master Chest\u201d worth $9,999 and will have rewards ranging from $10k to $1,000,000.\n\nBitcoin \u2013 Where It All Began\n\nAfter running a mining network for almost two years, Satoshi Nakamoto established the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain in 2009. The coin\u2019s introduction as a proof-of-work currency ushered in a new era of decentralised finance in which crypto tokens will dominate a sizable portion of the world financial market.\n\nBefore being made accessible for trading and exchanging, Bitcoin (BTC) was once a token that users had to mine. As users held power over the token\u2019s future, the mining was compatible with its decentralisation aims. Specialised graphics processing units like ASICs can still mine Bitcoin, even though doing so on mobile devices is no longer cost-effective. This has drastically restricted mining to large companies.\n\nBTC relied on scarcity rather than the qualities of the protocol to climb the cryptocurrency rankings. Its main contribution to DeFi was the development of private, secure blockchain technology, which increased user security and promoted the transfer of assets throughout the world.\n\nBlockchains also record each transaction that users make. Only for security reasons may the data be obtained; they cannot be used to identify somebody. Public keys are generated for each transaction, and each user has a private key. For tracing transactions on the blockchain, the public keys operate as reference points.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Monetary policy of cryptocurrencies, explained - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "What is monetary policy in crypto? Monetary policy in crypto refers to the mechanisms used to manage the supply and circulation of cryptocurrencies. These mechanisms are intended to ensure the sustainability, stability and predictability of a coin\u2019s value over time. Cryptocurrencies rely on decentralized protocols to handle their monetary policy, as opposed to conventional fiat currencies, which are controlled by central banks and governments. These protocols may contain a number of tools for regulating the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply, including block rewards, changes to the mining difficulty and issuance rates. For instance, Bitcoin (BTC) has a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins. As time goes on, the pace at which new coins are introduced to the supply continuously declines, eventually causing a deflationary situation as the rate of new supply gets closer to zero. On the contrary, certain cryptocurrencies may employ alternative mechanisms to govern their monetary policy, like proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus systems, which use staking to encourage network activity and control the cryptocurrency supply.\n\nHow do cryptocurrencies have monetary value? Cryptocurrencies have monetary value because people assign value to them, much like any other currency or asset. A cryptocurrency\u2019s value is primarily influenced by market forces of supply and demand. A cryptocurrency will become more expensive if there are more buyers than there are sellers prepared to accept their offers. The price will fall, however, if there are more sellers of a cryptocurrency than there are buyers ready to purchase it. Related: What is tokenomics? A beginner\u2019s guide on supply and demand of cryptocurrencies Other factors that can influence the value of a cryptocurrency include its utility, security and adoption. For instance, a cryptocurrency that is widely recognized as a form of payment and has a clear use case will probably be worth more than one that is not extensively accepted. Furthermore, cryptocurrencies with robust security features and a track record of dependability will often be more valuable than those with lax security or a history of hacks and flaws.\n\nHow will cryptocurrencies affect monetary policy? Although the precise impact will depend on how widely cryptocurrencies are used and integrated into the current financial system, cryptocurrencies have the potential to influence monetary policy in a number of ways. Here are some possible ways in which cryptocurrencies could affect monetary policy: Reduced control over the money supply: Due to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies and the lack of a central controlling entity, standard monetary policy tools like printing money or changing interest rates may not have the same effect on them as they do on fiat currencies. This might restrict central banks\u2019 power to affect the total amount of fiat money in circulation.\n\nNew sources of data: Large amounts of transactional data generated by cryptocurrencies could be used to get important insights into consumer behavior and broader economic patterns. It may be necessary for central banks to figure out how to include this data in the decision-making process.\n\nIncreased competition: Since cryptocurrencies provide an alternate method of payment and a store of value, they may become more competitive than traditional fiat currencies. This can put pressure on central banks to keep their currencies stable and valuable to remain competitive. Additionally, banks are experimenting with CBDC projects in response to the potential threat of cryptocurrencies, which could disrupt traditional banking and payment systems.\n\nEnhanced financial inclusion: Cryptocurrencies have the potential to give people and enterprises who might not have access to traditional banking services better financial access and inclusion. As a result, monetary policy may shift as central banks may need to consider how a more diversified and decentralized financial system will behave. Related: What is a CBDC? Why central banks want to get into digital currencies\n\nWho controls Bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy? BTC\u2019s monetary policy is controlled by the rules built into the Bitcoin software protocol, which is open-source and operates in a decentralized manner. The protocol\u2019s rules dictate how new BTC is created and distributed over time. Moreover, any proposed changes to the protocol must be approved by a majority of the network\u2019s users, making Bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy subject to the consensus of its users. Particularly, the protocol\u2019s built-in issuance schedule serves as the foundation for Bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy. The total number of BTC that will ever be created is 21 million. New Bitcoin is produced through a process called mining, where users compete to solve challenging mathematical problems in exchange for rewards that include newly created BTC. The mining reward is automatically reduced by half every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years), a process known as halving. This indicates that as time passes, the rate of new BTC generation declines, eventually resulting in a maximum supply of 21 million. One of the main components of Bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy is its constant supply, which works to maintain scarcity and prevent inflation.\n\nDo stablecoins alter the monetary policy transmission mechanism? Stablecoins may function outside of conventional banking and payment systems and may offer an alternative form of payment and store of value, which has the potential to change how monetary policy is transmitted. A classic monetary policy transmission mechanism involves the employment of various tools, such as changing interest rates by central banks to affect the money supply, the actions of financial institutions and the behavior of people. Stablecoins, however, might operate separately from these conventional dynamics and might not be directly impacted by adjustments to interest rates or other monetary policy instruments. For instance, stablecoins may be considered a safe-haven asset, particularly during periods of market turbulence or economic unpredictability. Stablecoins may see a surge in popularity during these times, which may lessen the impact of conventional monetary policy tools like interest rate increases. Moreover, stablecoins might alter the demand for conventional fiat currencies and affect the effectiveness of monetary policy if they were to gain widespread adoption. Nonetheless, in order to account for stablecoins\u2019 effects on the whole economy and incorporate them into their policy frameworks, central banks may need to develop new strategies."

        "content": "With over 90% of Bitcoin (BTC) in circulating supply, the asset\u2019s inflation rate has fallen significantly over the years to beat that of the United States dollar (USD) by at least three times. This is placing Bitcoin to act as a possible hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s dropping inflation rate stems from the cryptocurrency\u2019s fixed supply of 21 million BTCs. The rate drops after every four years during the halving event. As a result, the maiden cryptocurrency\u2019s inflation rate has been on a steady decline since its inception in 2009 to stand at 1.79% as of March 4, data by crypto analysis platform WooBull indicates.\n\nBitcoin inflation rate chart. Source: Woobull\n\nAt the same time, the annual inflation rate of the U.S. dollar in 2023 stands at 6.4%. The value peaked at 7% in 2021, data by USInflationCalculator indicates. This implies that the U.S. dollar inflation rate is 3.57 times higher than Bitcoin.\n\nU.S. dollar annual inflation rate. Source: USInflationCalculator\n\nIntrigues of Bitcoin\u2019s dropping inflation rate\n\nBitcoin\u2019s ability to record a low inflationary rate is because of the asset\u2019s deflationary model. The design means that the inflation rate decreases post-halving events. The rate is determined by the reward system for miners, which is split in half with each halving event. During the halving event, Bitcoin rewards for miners are reduced by half. This means that the number of Bitcoins produced through mining is halved, with the next event estimated to take place in May 2024.\n\nIn contrast, the U.S. dollar inflation rate will likely rise as the currency\u2019s value decreases over time. The plunge in value is primarily due to excessive printing and the diminishing purchasing power of each dollar. Notably, inflation can be caused by several factors, including an increase in the money supply, a decrease in demand, or a decrease in production.\n\nExperts have also opined that Bitcoin\u2019s inflation rate remains lower due to its decentralization nature, meaning the maiden crypto can circumvent most political and economic risks linked with the U.S. dollar.\n\nBest inflation hedge?\n\nThe contrasting inflation rate between the assets has translated to a debate over the best investment option and the perfect hedge. Bitcoin proponents argue that BTC is the ideal asset to protect against inflation.\n\nHowever, the same has yet to translate to the asset\u2019s price amid rising inflation and interest rate hikes. Amid the broader economic downturn, Bitcoin and the general cryptocurrency market have suffered significant losses.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s 2023 rally has been cut short, with the crypto facing threats of retesting lows below $20,000. By press time, BTC was trading at $22,382."
