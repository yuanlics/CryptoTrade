        "content": "El Salvador, the first country to recognize bitcoin as a legal tender, passed landmark legislation that establishes a legal framework for a Bitcoin-backed bond dubbed \u201cVolcano Bond.''\n\nKey Takeaways The digital asset bill in the Legislative Assembly obtained 62 votes in favor and 16 against.\n\n\n\nBitcoin-backed bond dubbed 'Volcano Bond' will be used to pay down sovereign debt, fund the construction of the Bitcoin City, and create Bitcoin mining infrastructure.\n\nPresident Nayib Bukele continues to double down on Bitcoin despite opposition from his citizens and a debt crisis.\n\nBond Will Be Used to Pay Debts\n\nThe digital securities law, first proposed in November 2022, was passed with a majority of 62 votes to 16 against and will be signed into law by president Nayib Bukele.\n\n'Volcano Bond' is named after the country's Bitcoin City, which will be powered by hydrothermal energy from nearby Conchagua volcano as a renewable crypto-mining center. El Salvador plans to use the Volcano Bond to pay down its sovereign debt, fund the construction of the Bitcoin City, and create Bitcoin mining infrastructure, according to Bitfinex, the technology provider for the bonds.\n\nUnder the government\u2019s proposal, the bonds would be denominated in U.S. dollars and pay 6.5% annually for ten years with a five-year lock-up period, with fast-track access for citizenship in the country. The announcement added that issuance of the bonds would soon begin.\n\nPresident Bukele Doubles Down on Bitcoin\n\nEl Salvador's President Nayib Bukele announced in September 2021 that he would make Bitcoin legal tender in the country, which has a population of only 6.3 million. Since then, he has doubled down on Bitcoin, despite the opposition of many of his own citizens.\n\nEven during the crypto winter of 2022, Bukele committed to buying one Bitcoin per day, which will be added to the country's stash of around 2,300 BTC. The country is now likely to move forward quickly with its bond issuance to fund $667 million on maturing bonds after an IMF loan was rejected.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe latest move comes at a time when El Salvador is facing financial trouble and debt default.In 2022, its credit ratings worsened to the \"most distressed sovereign debt in the world.\"The Central American country has taken a bold step at a time when the whole crypto industry is in turmoil.\n\n"

        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Exchange traded funds myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nInvestors piled money into bitcoin futures ETFs in 2022, even though the price of the cryptocurrency plunged 65 per cent.\n\nInvestors ploughed $241mn into the six US bitcoin futures ETFs during the first 11 months of 2022, according to data from Morningstar Direct. And most of that money \u2014 $198mn \u2014 was added after June, which bitcoin payment service provider Bitpay marks as the start of a crypto \u201cdeep freeze\u201d.\n\nProShares in October 2021 launched the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, the first bitcoin futures ETF. It amassed $1.2bn in assets within two days.\n\nBut its assets tumbled to $549mn by year-end, largely because of market depreciation. Sales of the ETF have held steady throughout the crypto winter, as the ETF collected monthly net inflows for all but three of the first 11 months of 2022, according to Morningstar data.\n\nThis article was previously published by Ignites, a title owned by the FT Group.\n\nInvestors piled $259mn into the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF during the year ended November 30, the database shows.\n\n\u201cA futures-based ETF is a very robust, \u2018belt and suspenders\u2019 solution for people who are looking for exposure,\u201d said Simeon Hyman, global investment strategist at ProShares. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten big reminders of the challenges with the spot market and exchanges, which are not mature yet.\u201d\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has not approved any ETFs that invest in spot bitcoin, citing concerns around fraud and manipulation. But the regulator has granted approval for ETFs that invest in bitcoin futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, arguing that futures are safer for investors.\n\nCombining the regulated futures market with an ETF wrapper resolves many of the issues with the spot bitcoin market, said Hyman.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one thing that it doesn\u2019t change,\u201d he added. \u201cBitcoin is going to be a volatile thing.\u201d\n\nETFs that invest in companies that benefit from the growth of bitcoin have also recorded net inflows so far this year, but have faltered in the second half.\n\nThose products include the $415mn Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF, $119mn First Trust Indxx Innovative Transaction & Process ETF and $99mn Siren Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF, which each invest in companies involved in the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem, prospectuses show.\n\nInvestors piled a combined $100mn into the 16 bitcoin-related ETFs during the year ended November 30, Morningstar data shows. But nearly all of that money \u2014 $92mn \u2014 went into the Global X Blockchain ETF. Six of the ETFs recorded net outflows over the period.\n\nInvestors holding on to these ETFs might be doing so in hopes that the crypto market would soon recover, analysts said.\n\nAfter soaring to record highs in 2021, digital assets have taken a considerable hit this year, driven down by plummeting cryptocurrency prices and the dramatic collapse of FTX, one of the largest crypto exchanges.\n\nThe price of bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, tumbled from a high of $68,990 on November 8 2021 to $16,548 on December 31, according to Yahoo Finance.\n\nEthereum has not fared much better despite a successful and highly anticipated update that occurred in September, known as the \u201cmerge\u201d, through which its network upgraded from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake system. Still, the price of ether \u2014 Ethereum\u2019s native coin \u2014 fell from $4,294 on November 21 2021 to $1,197 on December 31, Yahoo Finance data shows.\n\nCrypto\u2019s woes were exacerbated in November when FTX abruptly filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\n\u201cA lot of crypto investors are the \u2018buy the dip\u2019 sort of crowd that we\u2019ve seen really take shape in the last couple of years,\u201d said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar. \u201cIt almost seems like, to some market segments, it\u2019s more of like a religion than an investment at this point.\u201d\n\nFlows into Bitcoin futures ETFs could also be attributed to \u201cinvestor loss aversion\u201d, said Matt Apkarian, associate director of product development at Cerulli Associates.\n\n\u201cA biased investor might say, \u2018I want to hold on to this until it gets back to the price I bought it at [and] I don\u2019t want to sell it at a loss because it\u2019s not a loss until I sell\u2019,\u201d said Apkarian.\n\nBitcoin futures ETFs were \u201cisolated\u201d from the crypto winter and FTX collapse because they are separate from the underlying securities, said Vinod Jain, strategic adviser at Aite Novarica. \u201cYou\u2019re not buying the actual assets,\u201d he added.\n\nThe crypto winter and FTX collapse were unlikely to impact the views of people who back cryptocurrency, said Apkarian.\n\n\u201cThis is just a bump in the road, which in some ways is probably speeding up the inevitable regulation that needs to occur around it,\u201d he added.\n\n*Ignites is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

        "content": "Bitcoin is up more than 4% to start 2023, and the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency space is on the mend to start the new year, but plenty of work remains to regain previous highs.\n\nAfter bitcoin, the largest digital asset, shed roughly two-thirds of its value in 2022 and some other cryptocurrencies performed even worse, some crypto enthusiasts believe that things can\u2019t get much worse in 2023. Naysayers see things differently, and while that debate will be settled as 2023 unfolds, bitcoin volumes are recently muted, and some smaller investors have departed the market.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency spot trading volumes remain similarly muted after slumping about 48% in December versus the previous month to $544 billion, their lowest level since December 2019, CryptoCompare data showed,\u201d reported Reuters. \u201cWhile lower trading volumes are common around the turn of the year, the crypto market apathy has been exacerbated by a \u2018general exodus\u2019 of active retail investors, according to Arcane Research.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks, buyers stepped into the bitcoin market at prices ranging from $16,000 to $17,000 \u2014 it\u2019s slightly above the latter as of late Monday \u2014 indicating that\u2019s a credible support range. Additionally, there are signs that volatility is waning, which has often given way to large moves over bitcoin\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, funding rates for perpetual bitcoin futures have been positive since Dec. 19, according to Coinglass data, meaning traders are betting on prices to rise and will pay to keep their long positions open,\u201d according to Reuters.\n\nStill, crypto bears argue that the FTX contagion is at play and crypto bank Silvergate Bank (NYSE:SI) recently announced layoffs, which is viewed as a negative, albeit a short-term one for the space. There\u2019s also a sense that macroeconomic issues, including inflation, rising interest rates, and the specter of recession, among others, could crimp crypto\u2019s comeback efforts.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, cryptocurrencies remain at the mercy of macroeconomic headwinds as worries whirl around a slowing global economy,\u201d noted Reuters. \u201cEconomic uncertainty could send investors running for the safety of the U.S. dollar , which tends to be inversely correlated to bitcoin, said Dalvir Mandara, quantitative researcher at MacroHive.\u201d\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel .\n\nThe opinions and forecasts expressed herein are solely those of Tom Lydon, and may not actually come to pass.

        "title": "You Can Buy Bitcoin at a Discount, but There's a Catch - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It's been a rough year and change since Bitcoin (BTC 2.49%) peaked in 2021. The leading cryptocurrency has plummeted 59% over the past year, and seen a portfolio-crushing 73% descent since hitting an all-time high just 14 months ago. The implosion of several high-profile digital currency exchanges and platforms has rattled the confidence of traders, but there could be an opportunity in the chaos.\n\nWhat if I told you that you could buy a position in Bitcoin at a 38% discount? And -- no -- this isn't a cruel joke where the trick is just to wait a few months for the denomination itself to get cheaper. The crypto market has shown some signs of stabilizing here. Bitcoin is actually trading slightly higher over the past week as well as the past month.\n\nI'm talking about an opportunity where you can buy $15.94 worth of Bitcoin for less than $10, but -- and there's always a \"but\" -- there's a catch that may very well scare you away.\n\nIt's a matter of trust\n\nA handful of exchange-traded funds hit the market in the past 15 months, but they're far from perfect. They don't own Bitcoin itself, relying instead on futures contracts for the digital currency to participate in the ups and downs of the crypto market. However, Grayscale Investments -- a player in the crypto market since its infancy a decade ago -- runs a few publicly traded trusts that have direct ownership of the underlying crypto.\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC -1.01%) is its largest offering, currently holding more than $11 billion in Bitcoin. Unlike the newer cryptocurrency ETFs, Grayscale's entry is established as an investment trust. It actually owns the crypto. After seeing FTX, Celsius, Voyager, and other exchanges collapse after taking big risks to provide some bonus yields, it's comforting to know that Grayscale Bitcoin Trust stores its assets offline, in cold storage.\n\nAs mentioned, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is trading at a 38% discount to its net asset value. The publicly traded trust closed at $9.88 on Tuesday, a 38% markdown on the $15.94 a share it owns in cold-stored Bitcoin assets. As they always say, if it seems to be too good to be true, you're probably right.\n\nFor starters, there's a price to pay for Grayscale buying, storing, and safekeeping Bitcoin directly. Its management fee is 2% annually, taken out in small bits over the course of the year, like most ETFs and mutual funds. Many of the futures-based ETFs that don't trade at significant discounts to their assets have lower sponsor fees. Adding insult to injury, this fee is charged on what is currently the $11 billion in assets under management, not the discounted market value of the shares.\n\nThe biggest catch: You can't cash out at the value of the trust's Bitcoin. You get in or out at the prevailing discounted rate. And -- spoiler alert -- it's a discount that has historically widened instead of contracted.\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust consistently traded at a premium three years ago, when it was one of the few publicly traded ways to cash in on the Bitcoin boom. By late 2021, when Bitcoin was approaching $65,000, the trust was trading at a discount in the teens. It's far deeper now.\n\nA silver lining here is that the discount can also contract, which we've seen in recent weeks with the price of Bitcoin starting to stabilize. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is up 23% over the past month, with Bitcoin itself only rising 2% in that time. This isn't the norm, of course. As pointed out, even with Bitcoin hitting all-time highs in 2021 the double-digit discount was widening at the time.\n\nThere is no free lunch. However, if you feel that Bitcoin will bounce back -- and you understand the risks that come with freely trading trusts that will fetch varying premiums and discounts to the underlying assets -- this is one path to consider. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust offers crypto investments at a theoretical discount but at a stiff annual sponsor fee."

        "title": "The Top 7 Cryptos to Buy Before the Next Bitcoin Halving - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "As we head into a new year, 2023 is set to be the best time to look for cryptos to buy. The turbulence last year due to rate hikes and the selloff of cyclical assets such as cryptos might make it look all doom and gloom. But the bottom has historically been the best time to buy.\n\nOf course, it is difficult to predict the actual bottom, but many projects now sit well below pre-pandemic prices, with little downside risk. Moreover, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) will halve its mining rewards sometime in Q1 2024. As most cryptos correlate with BTC, this halving will likely start another crypto bull run next year, continuing the historical trend.\n\nTherefore, let\u2019s\u2019 dive into the following seven cryptos to buy, as they can benefit heavily from Bitcoin\u2019s halving. I highly recommend doing your own research into these tokens, as many of them are small-cap projects.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD)\n\nUp trend Technical graph of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) in futuristic concept, BITI ETF is a Bitcoin short fund for investors betting against Bitcoin.\n\nSource: Sittipong Phokawattana / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnsurprisingly, Bitcoin will be the biggest beneficiary of the halving. The standard deviation of BTC is lower than almost every other cryptocurrency, excluding stablecoins. Thus, if you are looking for the safest cryptos to buy, Bitcoin should always be your go-to project due to its evergreen status.\n\nI\u2019d even say it is the only crypto project worth dollar-cost averaging into, as positive returns are very likely if you choose to hold for many years. It is a tried and tested asset with a solid reputation and won\u2019t disappoint in the long run. I cannot say the same for any other asset in this article.\n\nIn the current environment, BTC is by far your best bet. There are no guarantees that the crypto market is at a bottom, and Standard Chartered analysts forecast Bitcoin could go as low as $5,000 this year. The scarier part of this scenario is that more cyclical altcoins will be hit much harder.\n\nStory continues\n\nConversely, the economy remains healthy, with the recent jobs report indicating a robust labor market. If the Fed does a U-turn in late 2023 or early 2024 and the Bitcoin halving occurs within the expected time, BTC is likely to surge. Thus, it remains the best among the cryptos to buy.\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD)\n\nCrypto currency etherium. ethereum coin on exchange charts. e-currency Ethereum. Ethereum price predictions\n\nSource: viktoryabov / Shutterstock.com\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD) is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and should be your second option if you are looking for safer cryptos to buy. Although ETH is more volatile than BTC, it is an established project that has survived multiple crypto market cycles and outperformed Bitcoin of late.\n\nThe project is at the forefront of Web3 and blockchain development, leading the development of smart contract-based applications such as non-fungible tokens. A significant number of NFTs and Web3 projects are also being developed on the Ethereum blockchain. However, the most considerable advantage of Ethereum is that thousands of crypto projects rely on the blockchain and need ETH for gas fees. There are 744,000 ERC20 tokens on the network, generating significant demand for Ethereum.\n\nFurthermore, the network\u2019s switch to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus reduced ETH issuance by 88%. In the next crypto market rally, increased ETH demand and reduced issuance will likely make Ethereum trade at a much higher valuation.\n\nSticking with Bitcoin and Ethereum will give you a balanced risk-reward ratio. Thus, I recommend you venture into other cryptos only if you seek outsized returns with little regard for risk.\n\nLitecoin (LTC-USD)\n\nSilver Litecoin coin facing forward on a pile of litecoins\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMuch like Bitcoin, Litecoin (LTC-USD) is a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain that undergoes a halving event. The next halving event for Litecoin will occur in August this year and cut mining rewards to 6.25 LTC from 12.5. That should significantly increase the value of this cryptocurrency, as it is among the most popular blockchains for miners after Ethereum shifted to a PoS consensus.\n\nFurthermore, while many thought of Litecoin as an old and irrelevant project, its recent MimbleWimble upgrade added much-needed utility and is bringing it back to relevancy. Litecoin users can now transact with the same degree of anonymity that many privacy coins such as Monero (XMR-USD) promise, but with Litecoin\u2019s block time of just 2.5 minutes.\n\nI believe LTC is at compelling levels and is bottoming out. It has gained 61%-plus from its trough last year, and I expect these gains to accelerate as it gets closer to halving. Next year, Bitcoin\u2019s halving will be the icing on the cake for this project.\n\nStorj (STORJ-USD)\n\nStorj Logo\n\nSource: storj.io\n\nI\u2019ve discussed Filecoin (FIL-USD) a considerable amount of times in my recent articles, and Storj (STORJ-USD) is similar to that project. The main difference between the two is that Storj maintains a central authority, while Filecoin is peer-to-peer. I believe both will be significant beneficiaries of the burgeoning cloud computing and storage industry, especially once decentralized storage becomes more mainstream.\n\nBlockchain storage is also cheaper than centralized counterparts that run data servers and has no censorship. On top of that, since the blockchain isn\u2019t a single server, the uptime and resiliency of these cloud storage platforms are remarkably high. These factors combined will make blockchain cloud storage projects highly-compelling to end users in the long-run.\n\nOf course, I only recommend small caps like Storj if your risk profile is aggressive. Sticking with more established projects such as Filecoin is a much better idea for long-term investing.\n\nTerareum (TERA-USD)\n\nAn image of a miner with a pickaxe mining digital coins, computer code and various numbers are overlaid on the image\n\nSource: Yev_1234 / Shutterstock\n\nTerareum (TERA-USD) is a centralized crypto exchange, and TERA is the native token of the project. Although the token has taken a hit from the selloff last year due to its small market capitalization and the effects of the current crypto winter affecting all altcoins in addition to Bitcoin and Ethereum, Terareum is highly likely to deliver disproportionately high returns due to its leading utility that has successfully launched on December last year. The Terareum exchange, also known as \u201cTERAREUM,\u201d offers lots of features under one roof, including debit cards, spot trading, and utilities such as Margin, Futures, and Staking capabilities. I recommend further researching the project on its website due to its complexity.\n\nIn addition, Terareum also has a cryptocurrency launchpad called Terapool. The launchpad raises liquidity for other crypto projects with much lower interest rates. Thus, the demand for this token will likely increase in the next cycle, due to new crypto projects and higher user influx into the Terareum exchange. The release in Quarter 3 of 2023 of an indigenous Layer 1 \u2013 Terareum Blockchain based on the PoS concept could also compel large institutional investors.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s also Terapay which enables users to utilize fiat and crypto transactions as a mode of payment for goods using a single platform at many vendors and merchants for online costs. The payment gateway is adopted worldwide and could become a game-changer in the cryptocurrency & Web3 space.\n\nKalima.io (KLX-USD)\n\nBitcoin mining operation. Bitcoin mining farm. GREE stock.\n\nSource: Michal Bednarek / Shutterstock\n\nKalima (KLX-USD) piqued my interest because of the functionality the project aims to provide. On its website, it states that Kalima is a Layer 1 blockchain for enterprises and IoT (Internet of Things). This is a network of blockchains offering quick transactions and limitless scalability.\n\nKalima\u2019s full client nodes can be embedded not only on small IoT devices but also on supercomputers. This includes mobile and web clients, allowing for transactions to be managed with a latency of less than one second. Kalima smart contracts can also be executed on the client side, opening a new world of edge-computing and blockchain technology possibilities.\n\nIts token, KLX, secures the whole Kalima network, enabling the payment of transaction fees, staking, data governance, the acquisition of nodes for PrivaChains, and numerous essential other Kalima Network key functionalities. The Kalima Blockchain allows developers to have complete control of their dApps using standard languages and tools, their governance and business models. Project developers have implemented these features successfully, and I anticipate significant growth for its KLX token.\n\nFinally, Enedis (OTCMKTS:ECIFY), ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT), Tenneco, and Spie are using Kalima\u2019s technology. That\u2019s quite a big plus when it comes to crypto, as only a few projects offer real-world utility. KLX will be listed on the 2nd of February on Bitmart.\n\nLoopring (LRC-USD)\n\nLoopring LRC token symbol of the DeFi system shining in the rays of light.\n\nSource: Vladimir Kazakov / Shutterstock.com\n\nLoopring (LRC-USD) is among the most cyclical cryptos to buy. The primary purpose of this project is to supplement the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s scalability through zkRollups. Of course, this means that the project\u2019s objective becomes redundant when the Ethereum blockchain receives less traffic. Likewise, the opposite is true when the Ethereum network is congested during a crypto bull cycle.\n\nTherefore, buying LRC at the trough before Bitcoin\u2019s halving is an excellent idea. When the Ethereum blockchain becomes congested again, Loopring will offer disproportionately higher returns than the rest of the market.\n\nOn Low-Capitalization and Low-Volume Cryptocurrencies: InvestorPlace does not regularly publish commentary about cryptocurrencies that have a market capitalization of less than $100 million or trade with a volume less than $100,000 each day. That\u2019s because these \u201cpenny cryptos\u201d are frequently the playground for scam artists and market manipulators. When we do publish commentary on low-volume crypto that may be affected by our commentary, we ask that InvestorPlace.com\u2019s writers disclose this fact and warn readers of the risks.\n\nRead More: How to Avoid Popular Cryptocurrency Scams\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "2 Charts That Show Why I'm Buying Bitcoin Now - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "In cyclical fashion, we find ourselves yet again in the midst of a crypto winter. And as they have in previous crypto winters, critics and naysayers contend that Bitcoin (BTC 2.44%) is dead, that it can't rise again, that it's a Ponzi scheme heading to zero, and that it will never recover.\n\nAll of these jabs at Bitcoin have been occurring since it was created in 2009, and yet all it has done since is go on a historical run and become the best-performing asset in history. Bitcoin forces us to think about what money actually is and how it should function. Should money be inflated at the desire of any government or central authority? Is money just an idea, or should it be backed by tangible assets? What makes one form of currency better than another?\n\nBitcoin has been touted by some as a near-perfect form of currency. Even with its volatility, which is viewed as a characteristic of new assets that eventually wanes, there is reason to believe that Bitcoin will once again rise from the ashes and reward investors who are patient and hold for the long haul.\n\nOne of Bitcoin's key features as sound money is its inherent scarcity. Ingrained in its code is a hard limit: There will only ever be a maximum of 21 million bitcoins in circulation. The only way this could be changed is if 51% of nodes running the Bitcoin network were in agreement, and I don't think that would ever happen. It's one of the crucial aspects that make Bitcoin, Bitcoin.\n\nThat limited-supply argument helped propel Bitcoin's price during the last 14 years. Since 2009, demand for Bitcoin has only increased, and it will likely continue as it remains resilient, proves to be a viable store of value, and people around the world look for more sound forms of currency.\n\nTo better showcase the dynamics behind Bitcoin's supply and demand, consider the two charts below.\n\nChart No. 1: Rising demand\n\nThere are a handful of metrics that could be used to display the growth in Bitcoin's demand. You might see charts showing the number of active addresses (wallets that send or receive Bitcoin during a specified period), transaction volume, or some other statistic trying to capture a glimpse of activity on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nHowever, while I believe Bitcoin could eventually become a viable form of currency for everyday transactions, most investors who favor it today are drawn to it as a store of value. So to capture its increased demand as a store of value, below is a chart of all Bitcoin addresses that currently hold at least 0.01 bitcoins -- and it's currently sitting at an all-time high.\n\nYou will notice that the chart is displayed on a logarithmic scale. If it were plotted on a linear scale, the line would show a continuous ascension from left to right. Unlike the linear charts that you may be more used to viewing, logarithmic ones are better suited to displaying wide ranges of values or when one wishes to describe the rate at which something grows.\n\nAs you can see, the number of addresses holding at least 0.01 Bitcoins increased the most early on in the token's history but since then, it has continued to rise even in the midst of the current crypto winter. At more than 11 million today, this metric has risen by 70% in the last five years and is up 3,000% since 2013. Talk about demand.\n\nChart No. 2: Outstanding supply\n\nNow let's look at supply. The chart below shows Bitcoin's shrinking supply-side growth. With only 21 million bitcoins set to ever be created, there can only be so many to meet the appetite of increased demand -- especially considering that around 91% of all Bitcoins have already been mined.\n\nAgain, this graph is plotted on a logarithmic scale because it is more sensitive for displaying the rate of change. Notice the difference in slope compared to the other chart? That's because the rate at which new bitcoins enter circulation is decreasing and will only continue to slow. Rather than being inflationary, Bitcoin is considered a deflationary asset -- a great quality for a store of value to possess. Deflationary assets increase an individual's purchasing power over time rather than decreasing it. This is the exact opposite of just about every government-issued currency.\n\nThere are around 19.25 million Bitcoin in circulation today, leaving only 1.75 million more to enter the supply until around the year 2140, when the last Bitcoin will be mined. Given that near-zero coin inflation, Bitcoin could benefit from increased demand and limited supply well into the future. Thanks to increased demand, Bitcoin's price has skyrocketed over the last decade, and I believe it will climb again as it becomes more scarce. That's why I'm a Bitcoin buyer right now."

If the gift is under a certain amount \u2014 $16,000 in 2022 and $17,000 in 2023 \u2014 it's also tax-free.\n\nKeep in mind that cryptocurrency is a relatively risky investment, and prices tend to be volatile. Therefore, high-risk investments such as crypto should make up a small part of your overall portfolio; the same deliberation goes for financial gifts. It's also probably best to gift well-known currencies unless your recipient is already familiar with crypto.\n\nThere are several ways to gift digital coins and tokens, including many simple and low-cost options.\n\nAdvertisement Charles Schwab Interactive Brokers IBKR Lite Webull NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

Learn More Learn More Learn More\n\nTransfer money through an exchange\n\nDifficulty: Easy.\n\nCost: Low.\n\nTransferring digital assets through an exchange is the simplest method. If you don't already have crypto to give, you can purchase it through a crypto exchange.\n\nYour recipient will also need to have an account to receive the funds. They can give you their wallet address, which may look like a QR code \u2014 a barcode you can scan with your smartphone's camera \u2014 or a long string of numbers and letters to enter when you use the \"Send\" feature on your exchange of choice. Select the currency and the amount you'd like to transfer.\n\n\u00bb Looking for an exchange? Here are our top picks\n\nUse a peer-to-peer money transfer app\n\nDifficulty: Easy.\n\nCost: Medium.\n\nYou'll have to go through a few extra identity verification steps on the app and have a linked payment method to send crypto this way. You can also use these two apps to send crypto to an external crypto wallet if your recipient already has one. Fees vary but are generally higher than crypto exchange or wallet transfers.\n\nPrint a paper wallet\n\nDifficulty: Easy.\n\nCost: Low.\n\nPaper wallets are a simple way to gift crypto, as they're meant for one-time use and can be transferred by handing the paper to someone. This method is best for smaller amounts of crypto, as it's not the most secure way to transfer funds. Paper wallets show the location of the crypto on the blockchain, so anyone with the paper can access it, and paper wallets can be easily destroyed.\n\nA free paper wallet generator, available on platforms such as BitAddress.org and WalletGenerator.net, can help you generate a printable document with a unique public and private key combination. The document will have QR codes that link to these addresses for easy transfer. If your crypto exchange has a mobile app, you can scan that QR code, then follow the steps on the app to send an amount of your choice to the paper wallet address.\n\nPaper wallets can be gifted with a card for a special occasion and are a more tangible form of digital currency. Once received, the funds can be transferred to a software or hardware wallet by scanning the same QR code, or the paper can be stored safely.\n\nUse a crypto gifting service\n\nDifficulty: Easy.\n\nCost: Low to medium.\n\nGifting services explicitly made for cryptocurrency can elevate the sentimental value of a crypto transfer. Options include the Robinhood Crypto Gifting Program or a service such as EarlyBird Crypto, which helps families gift crypto to children through a UGMA custodial account, a tax-advantaged account designed for giving cash or securities to minors.\n\nThe Robinhood Crypto Gifting Program, accessible through the Robinhood app, allows you to send funds commission-free via a link with a tracking feature. In addition, if your gift isn't accepted within 14 days, you won't be charged.\n\nEarlyBird lets you create a video message to accompany each gift and add a kid's milestone moments to the platform to look back on. The service also includes a financial literacy newsletter.\n\nCreate a software wallet\n\nDifficulty: Medium.\n\nCost: Low.\n\nThis method may take a little more effort, as you'll have to install software to create a wallet to transfer. To give a software wallet, first download a mobile or desktop wallet, such as one of these top wallet options, and follow the steps to set up an account.\n\nThe most critical step is copying down the seed or recovery phrase the wallet generates. This will look like a set of 12 or 24 random words, which are essential to recover your wallet funds or transfer them to someone else. The seed phrase must be gifted with the rest of the wallet information.\n\nOnce the seed phrase is ready, you can send your desired amount of crypto to the wallet address you created. Many software wallets have features that let you purchase crypto directly from the wallet or send it from another wallet or exchange.\n\nThe seed phrase is all your recipient needs to recover the funds in the wallet. You can write down instructions to download the same software wallet you created, and once they enter the seed phrase, they'll have access to the funds from their device.\n\nPurchase a hardware wallet\n\nDifficulty: High.\n\nCost: Medium to high.\n\nHardware wallets can be a bit more complicated to use, but they make for a great gift as they're physical devices that can be wrapped. Hardware wallets can also be a more secure storage method, as they're not accessible online.\n\n\u00bb Looking for a hardware wallet? Here are our top picks\n\nTo gift a hardware wallet, you'll need to purchase a device from a hardware wallet company; some are available at stores like Best Buy and Walmart. Once it arrives, you'll need to follow the included instructions to set it up and download the accompanying software.\n\nJust like with a software wallet, it's essential that you write down your 12- or 24-word seed phrase and keep it in a safe place.\n\nTo add crypto to a hardware wallet, you can connect your device to your computer or phone. Some devices plug into your computer with a USB cord; others connect wirelessly via QR code or WiFi. Most accompanying wallet software has tools to purchase crypto directly, or you can send crypto to the wallet address from another wallet or exchange.\n\nOnce funds have been added to the wallet, you can wrap it and gift it, along with the seed phrase information. To elevate the gift, some wallet companies have steel cards available for purchase that can be engraved with a seed phrase.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip Some hardware wallets are electronic devices that look like flash drives; others are card-shaped and are sometimes marketed as cryptocurrency gift cards. Make sure you purchase a cryptocurrency \"gift card\" from a reputable, verified provider that's been well-reviewed, as some \"Bitcoin gift card\" providers may be scams.\n\nHow are crypto gifts taxed?\n\nCryptocurrency gifts are taxed similarly to other monetary gifts and work most similarly to gifting a stock or bond. However, there's no gift tax for giving or receiving crypto under a certain amount.\n\nThe amount that qualifies for a gift-tax exemption is adjusted every year for inflation: For gifts made in 2022, it was $16,000, and for 2023, it will be $17,000. Any gift under that amount is not taxable until the recipient sells the asset.\n\nIf you're gifting crypto over the exemption amount, you'll need to file a gift tax return or Form 709. This includes smaller gifts that add to the total amount ($16,000 in 2022). Crypto is a reasonably new asset that can fluctuate a lot in value, so it's necessary to document your gift properly, especially if it's significant. This should include a letter to the recipient specifying the gift parties, amounts and purpose.\n\n\"It's especially important, with crypto, to ensure you record the right value of the asset,\" Jordan Bass, a tax lawyer and founder of Taxing Cryptocurrency (a tax service that helps clients with crypto accounting). \"Make sure it's understood that it's a gift, not a loan or a payment for services.\"\n\nBass has seen clients gift large amounts of crypto to help pay their parents' mortgages or help them retire. In situations like this, or if a child is gifted crypto that will be held for a long time and possibly increase in value, having a proper record of the original gift can help ensure that there aren't significant tax consequences in the future.\n\nTrack your finances all in one place Get started by signing up and linking an account.

        "content": "Northern Data AG, a German company that specializes in Bitcoin mining and cloud computing, has released earnings results for its mining division.\n\nNorthern Data AG said that in fiscal 2022, it mined 2,798 Bitcoin (BTC), up 315% from the previous year. This led to BTC mining revenues of 77.7 million euros in fiscal 2022. The company sold 3,005 BTC sold in 2022 for an average price of 23,849 euros, contributing to a cash revenue of 71.7 million euros.\n\nThe data released by Northern Data also indicated that it had approximately 3.6 exahash a second (EH/s) of computing power dedicated to BTC mining. Additionally, the company said it expects unaudited consolidated revenues in the range of 190 million to 194 million euros, with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) \u201cadjusted for the trading loss from the sale of cryptocurrencies\u201d of 40 million to 50 million euros.\n\nHowever, December was a challenging month for Northern Data. The company mined a total of 177 Bitcoin, down 15% from November and down 25% from December 2021. This was due to high energy prices, particularly in Europe, which caused the deployed ASIC machines in Europe to have set amounts of \u201cdowntime\u201d where they were unable toproduce continuously.\n\nThe firm said it is relocating its ASIC machines to \u201cenergy price optimized locations\u201d to ensure production stability and optimal capacity utilization in an attempt to reach its production target of 350 BTC per month.\n\nRelated: Public Bitcoin mining companies plagued with $4B of collective debt\n\nOn Jan. 6, Cointelegraph reported that one of the largest Bitcoin mining operations in North America, Marathon Digital Holdings, has been experimenting with overclocking to increase its competitive advantage in the BTC mining industry.\n\nAccording to an update issued by Marathon Digital Holdings, it produced 475 BTC in December, bringing its total mined Bitcoin in the fiscal 2022 to 4,144 BTC, a 30% increase from the 3,197 BTC produced in fiscal 2021.\n\nRecently, some Bitcoin mining companies have faced challenges due to the increasing difficulty of mining and the price of electricity. This has caused a decline in mining profitability and led some miners to shut down their operations. Others have reported significant revenue growth and increases in mining power, thanks to better mining hardware and mining software optimization."

Can government regulations help provide stability for the crypto markets?\n\nWith the recent collapse of several large crypto institutions, the industry is watching for new government regulations now more than ever. Recent news events have made many feel uneasy about entering the crypto markets, but stronger legislation on how crypto institutions are allowed to operate could help restore confidence.\n\nWhile 2022 saw plenty of discussion around potential frameworks, including an executive order from the White House, little has been set in stone.\n\nJason Ward, Head of the Blockchain Incubator for the Fidelity Center for Applied Technology (FCAT) is also watching for regulatory clarity in 2 additional areas. The first is whether crypto assets will be classified as securities or non-securities, or if different crypto assets will fall into different categories. This can have significant implications for how strictly crypto is regulated going forward.\n\nThe second is whether regulators might establish a minimum tax threshold for crypto transactions (hypothetical example: Any purchase paid for with crypto under $100 would be exempt from capital gains or losses). While cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are designed to be exchanged for goods and services, transactions are currently taxable events, which makes it inconvenient for many users.\n\n\"Tax treatment around small transactions is holding back [crypto holders] in general,\" says Ward. \"More clarity around [tax treatment] could clear the way for greater utilization.\""

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) community members took to social media in response to the claims of Peter Zeihan, a recent guest on the Joe Rogan Experience (JRE) podcast.\n\nIn a recent JRE episode, Zeihan, an American geopolitical analyst and author, claimed that crypto was always a \u201chot dumpster fire\u201d and that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. The analyst claimed that the number one digital asset by market capitalization is now being priced \u201cmore appropriately.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Zeihan argued that Bitcoin, which is trading at around $17,000 at the time of writing, will go down by $17,000 more, saying that its appropriate price is within the negatives. He added:\n\n\u201cThe craziest thing about Bitcoin is that there will never be more than X number of units of Bitcoin. By default, it means it can\u2019t be used for trade.\u201d\n\nZeihan also argued that the \u201cwhole idea of economic activity is that there\u2019s expansion, which means you need more currency to lubricate and manage that expansion.\u201d The analyst argued that if a currency\u2019s supply is locked, there will be monetary inflation and this could \u201cdestroy an economic model.\u201d\n\nBecause of Zeihan\u2019s comments, Bitcoiners almost immediately offered their responses and provided counterarguments to Zeihan\u2019s claims. Some community members instantly pointed out that the analyst has not read and understood the Bitcoin white paper.\n\nBitcoiner highlighting the tell of not reading the BTC whitepaper. Source: Twitter\n\nSwan Bitcoin executive Alex Stanczyk also criticized the JRE guest and said his comments were ignorant. \u201cAlmost every single thing this \u2018expert\u2019 said in this short span of time is complete nonsense,\u201d Stanczyk wrote.\n\nJeff Ross, the founder of the Vailshire Capital Management hedge fund, also pointed out the flaws in Zeihan's arguments. He tweeted:\n\nThree critical errors in @PeterZeihan's logic that I see:\n\n1. To be valid, money must be created and controlled by a central authority. \u274c\n\n2. Scarce money limits human productivity and economic expansion. \u274c\n\n3. #Bitcoin and #crypto are interchangeable. \u274c\n\n\n\ncc: @joerogan https://t.co/gA5szpZe7L \u2014 Dr. Jeff Ross (@VailshireCap) January 8, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, one community member proudly defended Bitcoin and argued that some of its characteristics give it intrinsic value. They include scarcity, deflation, divisibility into smaller amounts called satoshis and decentralization.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin mining stocks surge with broader market as traders see less aggressive Fed\n\nWhile Rogan didn\u2019t argue with Zeihan\u2019s claims in the episode, the popular podcaster has previously voiced positive sentiments toward Bitcoin. On May 4, 2022, Rogan said that BTC is similar to the early internet and that the government did not see it coming. The podcaster also highlighted that it is a \u201cviable form of currency\u201d and can be used to purchase things."

        "title": "Bitcoin price rally to $18K possible as $275M in BTC options expire on Friday - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) price jumped to $17,500 on Jan. 11, driving it to its highest level in three weeks. The price move gave bulls control of the $275 million BTC weekly options expiry on Jan. 13, as bears had placed bets at $16,500 and lower.\n\nThe recent move has permabulls and dip-buyers calling a market bottom and potential end to the bear market, but what does the data actually show?\n\nIs the Bitcoin bear market over?\n\nIt might seem too pessimistic to say right now, but Bitcoin did trade below the $16,500 level on Dec. 30, and those bearish bets are unlikely to pay off as the options deadline approaches.\n\nInvestors\u2019 main hope is the possibility of the U.S. Federal Reserve halting its interest rate increase in the first quarter of 2023. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation report will be released on Jan. 12, and it might give a hint on whether the central bank\u2019s effort to slow the economy and bring down inflation is achieving its expected results.\n\nMeanwhile, crypto traders fear that an eventual downturn in the traditional markets could cause Bitcoin to retest the $15,500 low. For instance, Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief investment officer and chief U.S. equity strategist, Mike Wilson, told investors on CNBC to brace for a winter downdraft and warned that the S&P 500 index is vulnerable to a 23% drop to 3,000. Wilson added, \u201cEven though a majority of institutional clients think we\u2019re probably going to be in a recession, they don\u2019t seem to be afraid of it. That\u2019s just a big disconnect.\u201d\n\nBitcoin bears were not expecting the rally to $17,500\n\nThe open interest for the Jan. 13 options expiry is $275 million, but the actual figure will be lower since bears were expecting prices below $16,500. Bulls seem in complete control, even though their payout becomes much larger at $18,000 and higher.\n\nBitcoin options aggregate open interest for Jan. 13. Source: Coinglass\n\nThe 1.18 call-to-put ratio reflects the imbalance between the $150 million call (buy) open interest and the $125 million put (sell) options. If Bitcoin\u2019s price remains above $17,000 at 8:00 am UTC on Jan. 13, less than $2 million worth of these put (sell) options will be available. This difference happens because the right to sell Bitcoin at $16,500 or $15,500 is useless if BTC trades above that level on expiry.\n\n$18,000 Bitcoin will give bulls a $130 million profit\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on Jan. 13 for call (bull) and put (bear) instruments varies, depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $16,000 and $16,500: 100 calls vs. 2,700 puts. The net result favors the put (bear) instruments by $40 million.\n\nBetween $16,500 and $17,500: 1,400 calls vs. 1,500 puts. The net result is balanced between bears and bulls.\n\nBetween $17,500 and $18,000: 4,500 calls vs. 100 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $75 million.\n\nBetween $18,000 and $19,000: 7,200 calls vs. 0 puts. Bulls completely dominate the expiry by profiting $130 million.\n\nThis crude estimate considers the put options used in bearish bets and the call options exclusively in neutral-to-bullish trades. Even so, this oversimplification disregards more complex investment strategies.\n\nFor example, a trader could have sold a put option, effectively gaining positive exposure to Bitcoin above a specific price. But unfortunately, there\u2019s no easy way to estimate this effect.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin gained 300% in year before last halving \u2014 Is 2023 different?\n\nBitcoin bears need to push the price below $16,500 on Jan. 13 to secure a potential $40 million profit. On the other hand, the bulls can boost their gains by slightly pushing the price above $17,500 to profit by $75 million.\n\nThe four-day rally totaled a 4.5% gain and liquidated $285 million worth of leverage short (sell) futures contracts, so they might have less margin required to subdue Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nConsidering the uncertainty from the upcoming CPI inflation data, all bets are on the table, but bulls have decent incentives to try pushing Bitcoin price above $17,500 on Jan. 13.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Stock trading app Robinhood warned Wednesday it would soon end support for Bitcoin SV (BSV), with plans to delist the coin later this month.\n\nRobinhood users will no longer be able to buy, sell, or transfer Bitcoin SV after Jan. 25, according to a company update. Any remaining BSV in customer accounts after that will be automatically sold with users credited accordingly.\n\n\u201cWe have a rigorous framework in place to help us regularly review the crypto we offer on Robinhood,\u201d the company stated. \u201cWhile we do not discuss the process for assets on an individual basis, based on our latest review, we\u2019ve decided to end support for Bitcoin SV.\u201d\n\nBSV is the only coin Robinhood said will be impacted by the delisting. The platform currently offers trading on 19 different tokens through its Robinhood Crypto service, including Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nThe price of BSV fell sharply on Wednesday. Its price had decreased 11% to $39.11 over the past day as of this writing, according to data from CoinGecko. The figure represented a 92% decline in price from an all-time high of $489.75 set in April of 2021.\n\nBitcoin SV was first added to Robinhood\u2019s platform in November of 2018 after a hard fork involving Bitcoin Cash created the token. Bitcoin Cash itself is the result of a hard fork with Bitcoin\u2019s protocol.\n\nBitcoin Cash is now tradable again. We\u2019ve removed the halt following the hard fork. The fork produced a new asset, Bitcoin SV. BSV will be automatically distributed to BCH holders, who are entitled to one BSV per unit of BCH owned on the day of the fork (11/15). \u2014 Robinhood Help (@AskRobinhood) November 30, 2018\n\nA hard fork essentially creates two cryptocurrencies out of one, when changes made to a token through software updates make it incompatible with previous versions, resulting in two distinct branches.\n\nBitcoin SV, or \u201cSatoshi\u2019s Vision,\u201d is distinct from other versions of Bitcoin, including Bitcoin Cash, because of its larger block size, which results in reduced transaction fees.\n\nStory continues\n\nBSV is currently ranked 54 among all cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization, with a total value of $745 million. It is significantly smaller than Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash with market capitalizations of $335 billion and $2 billion, respectively.\n\nThe token is only available on less than a handful of exchanges, such as OKX, KuCoin, and Huobi. Many exchanges have delisted the token from their platforms over time, including San Francisco-based OKCoin, which ended its support of BSV in February of 2021.\n\nBinance, Kraken delisting Bitcoin SV sets a bad precedent, say critics\n\nBSV has been championed by Craig Wright, who has made unproven claims about being the true Satoshi Nakamato\u2013Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator\u2013since 2016.\n\nIn a defamation case against podcaster Peter McCormack, who had repeatedly called Wright a \u201cfraud\u201d for claiming to be Satoshi, a British court ruled Wright submitted \u201cdeliberately false\u201d evidence in August of last year.\n\nIn December, Wright\u2019s campaign to convince the masses that he created Bitcoin appeared to be coming to a close.\n\n\u201cI have been too angry for too long as I cared for external validation,\u201d he said in a Tweet. \u201cThe only validation I seek now is from my family and from seeing my ideas come to fruition and to be used by the world."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency has been on a wild ride lately from soaring highs to crushing lows to the recent implosion of FTX, the world\u2019s third-largest crypto currency exchange. But one thing that hasn\u2019t changed? If you trade, sell, exchange, or get rid of cryptocurrency for a gain, you\u2019ll owe taxes on it.\n\nThat\u2019s because, tax-wise, the IRS doesn\u2019t treat cryptocurrency like cash, but as property. Similar to stocks, the value of cryptocurrency can increase or decrease over time.\n\n\u201cWith cash, if you have a $10 bill at the beginning of the year, barring slight changes for inflation or cost of living, it will still be worth $10 at the end of the year,\" said Helena Swyter, a certified public accountant and owner of Sweeter CPA in Chicago. \"But if you purchased $10 worth of cryptocurrency, it could be worth a lot more or a lot less than that in a year.\u201d\n\nThose fluctuations become gains or losses once you sell or exchange the cryptocurrency, at which point they can be taxable, and the IRS is going to want to know about them on Form 1040, your federal income tax return form.\n\nNew this year is the addition of a specific digital assets section on the 1040 form, named broadly enough to include not just cryptocurrency, but also non-fungible tokens. In this section is a question that asks: \u201cAt any time during 2022, did you receive (as a reward, award, or payment for property or services); or sell, exchange, gift, or otherwise dispose of a digital asset (or a financial interest in a digital asset)?\u201d\n\nCredit: Getty Images (Westend61 via Getty Images)\n\nHow to track crypto transactions\n\nBecause you have to report your cryptocurrency gains and losses to the IRS, you need a good system to keep track of them. First, check with the brokerage or exchange you use to buy or sell cryptocurrency to see if it has tracking capabilities you can use or access, Swyter said. If not, use an app, tax reporting software, or a spreadsheet to track the information on your own, she said.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to track:\n\nHow much in dollars you spent to buy the cryptocurrency\n\nThe date you bought or received the cryptocurrency\n\nThe date you sold or exchanged the cryptocurrency\n\nHow much the coins were worth in dollars on the date you sold them\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you sell cryptocurrency coins for less than what you paid for them, that\u2019s a loss. You don\u2019t pay taxes on the losses. You can offset cryptocurrency capital gains with losses of up to $3,000, according to the IRS. If you have more than that amount in losses, you can carry it forward to future years.\n\n\u201cBut if you later sold cryptocurrency for more than its purchase price, that\u2019s a taxable gain,\u201d Swyter said. \u201cThis gain is taxed at short- or long-term capital gains rates, depending on how long you owned it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to know the dates you bought and sold your cryptocurrency. Some cryptocurrency exchanges will send you a 1099-B or a 1099-K form near the end of January. The 1099-B shows your gains or losses from selling cryptocurrency, while the 1099-K shows your proceeds. A 1099-B is more useful for figuring out how much you owe for taxes, but not every exchange sends these out. If they do, they may only send to certain people who made many or larger transactions. So it\u2019s a good idea to keep your own records.\n\nNFT non fungible token. Credit: Getty Images (Adrian Vidal via Getty Images)\n\nHow to report crypto gains and losses\n\nTo figure out a loss or gain, look at how much you paid for the cryptocurrency \u2014 including fees \u2014 and subtract it from the selling price. If the number is negative, that\u2019s a loss. If it\u2019s positive, that\u2019s a profit.\n\nIf you owned the cryptocurrency for one year or less before you sold or exchanged it, it\u2019s taxed as a short-term gain or loss, which is taxed at the ordinary income tax rate. If you held it for a year or more before you sold or exchanged it, it\u2019s calculated as a long-term capital gain or loss.\n\nThose are taxed at the more favorable long-term capital gains tax rate, based on your tax bracket.\n\nMany people\u2019s experiences with cryptocurrency is through coins they\u2019ve bought that are held in a brokerage account, Swyter said. But if you received other types of income in cryptocurrency, you need to report those, too.\n\n\u201cIf you earned interest from a cryptocurrency bank that needs to be converted to U.S. dollars when you receive it, report it the same way you would from a traditional bank,\u201d Swyter said. The same goes if someone paid you for a service in cryptocurrency, she added.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve calculated your gains and losses \u2014 and determined whether they were short- or long-term capital gains \u2014 you\u2019re ready to fill out the required tax forms.\n\nIf you\u2019re reporting both short-and long-term gains and losses, fill out tax Form 8949. After that, you should also fill out and file a regular income tax form, Form 1040 (Schedule D), which includes a space to summarize your transactions from Form 8949. If you\u2019ve done a good job with your record keeping, your work should be done.\n\nKate Rockwood is a freelance writer and editor.\n\nClick here for the latest economic news and economic indicators to help you in your investing decisions\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or Android\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube."

        "title": "Nigerian innovator launches first active Bitcoin Lightning node in the country - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Lightning Network has struck the earth in one of the most challenging operating environments. Lagos, the capital of Nigeria \u2014 Africa\u2019s most populous country \u2014 welcomed a new Bitcoin Lightning Network (LN) node this week, a vital step to better connect the continent to the layer-2 payments network that sits atop Bitcoin.\n\nThe node runs on an old laptop powered by a diesel generator, as Lagos regularly experiences energy and electricity blackouts.\n\nMegasley\u2019s diesel generator and laptop running the node. Source: Megasley\n\nIn a discussion with Cointelegraph, Megasley, who operates the first Nigerian Lightning node of 2023 and the first active Lightning node in the country (other nodes are dormant), shared his vision for bringing instant, low-cost payments to Africa thanks to the LN.\n\n\u201dLight takes 50 milliseconds to cross the earth. This is quick, but with many hops, these milliseconds can add up. And when you\u2019re standing at a point of sale waiting for your payment to clear, it can be frustrating.\u201d\n\nMegasley explained his wish for Africans to have payments that are instant and as close to free as possible. \u201cIf a Nigerian Bitcoiner and a Nigerian retailer are both connected to a node in Nigeria, it will give them the best Lightning experience,\u201d Megasley added.\n\nNigeria Free Routing is live!\n\n\n\nThe lightning network is now alive and routing on the ground in Lagos .\n\n\n\nPlease share and support us by opening a channel to us: https://t.co/nClBZbW4zA pic.twitter.com/hGsKobyjzY \u2014 Africa Free Routing \u26a1 (@FreeRoutingAf) January 10, 2023\n\nAccording to the explorer services Mempool and Amboss, the operator is currently the only active node on the map in Nigeria. By spinning up the node, the operator aims to make Lightning payments as accessible as possible to Africans.\n\nWhen asked about the importance of building out an extensive network of nodes across the globe to facilitate Bitcoin payments, the node runner explained, \u201cIf Bitcoin is to succeed, it must become a better, easier, faster medium of exchange than the incumbents. To get there, we need to build out an extensive network of nodes across the globe to facilitate these payments.\u201d\n\nMegasley also touched on Bitcoin (BTC) price volatility and its perception in Africa: \u201cPeople talk about the problem of volatility, but this is nothing when you live in a place where your money could easily lose half its value in a year.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfrica has rotten money controlled by rotten people, and this is why we need Bitcoin. We will take the power of money away from them so that the enormous potential of the African people can thrive.\"\n\nIndeed, there has been a surge in Bitcoin adoption among the countries that use the Central African franc, bolstered by Bitcoin conferences and forums in Senegal and Ghana. Although Nigeria has shown promising signs of Bitcoin adoption, such as legal tender discussion, the legacy financial system has imposed further restrictions in 2023.\n\nFor example, Nigerians will only be allowed to withdraw $44 dollars per week per individual and a maximum of $11,000 for businesses in 2023, as per the government\u2019s efforts to phase out cash. As a reminder, Bitcoin has no limits or restrictions for its use. To transact freely on the Bitcoin network, users require only a phone and an internet connection.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin, Sango Coin and the Central African Republic\n\nThe establishment of a Bitcoin Lightning node in Nigeria is a significant step toward increasing accessibility and adoption of the cryptocurrency in the country and the continent as a whole. Ultimately, Megasley hopes to empower individuals and businesses in Africa to take control of their financial future."

        "content": "The year 2022 marked the start of a new crypto winter, with major crypto companies collapsing and digital currency prices plummeting, including Bitcoin.\n\nIn addition, interest rate increases and general economic negativity are causing investors to worry.\n\nThe fundamentals of Bitcoin remain strong despite all of these. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the Bitcoin metrics for the year 2022:\n\nBitcoin Circulating Supply\n\nThe circulating supply of Bitcoin currently stands at 19,257,175 \u2013 91.7% of the capped maximum supply of 21 million coins. Now, there are 1,742,825 left to be mined before the limit of 21 million bitcoins is reached.\n\nAn average of one bitcoin block is created every 10 minutes, so Bitcoin\u2019s supply is increasing approximately every 10 minutes.\n\nHowever, despite a severe market downturn, including miner capitulation and forced liquidation, defi platform hacks, Bitcoin has largely maintained consistent 10-minute block times IN 2022.\n\nBitcoin miner\u2019s block reward\n\nTwo components constitute bitcoin block rewards: newly created coins and transaction fees. When they successfully validate blocks on the network, the reward is given to miners.\n\nThe number of newly generated coins is regulated by a halving event that occurs roughly every four years. The Bitcoin halving event reduces the supply of new bitcoins by half and aims to ensure that all 21 million bitcoins have been mined.\n\nDespite moving all their BTC to different addresses, the newly generated Bitcoin currently stands at 900/day this halving, and the reward for each block is $6.3 BTC.\n\nWhile block rewards are stable and predictable, transaction fees can fluctuate depending on multiple factors, such as network activity and transaction size.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Average Transaction Fee was $0.834 on Dec.31, a decrease from last year\u2019s high of 2.829 \u2013 a change of 70.5%.\n\nThis fall is primarily due to increasing network difficulty, heavy computational demand, and poor market performance.\n\nBlock height\n\nThe block height stood at 573.296k as of December 31. The blocks created per day remained constant despite the miner\u2019s revenue touching new lows.\n\nEvery blockchain consists of a series of sequential blocks, with the first block referred to as the genesis block. The genesis block is considered to be in block height zero. As a general rule, the blockchain\u2019s total height equals the height of the most recent block.\n\nAs the block height continues, Bitcoin still has more than 99% uptime, currently sitting at 99.987%.\n\nBitcoin mining difficulty\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Bitcoin mining difficulty stood at 35.36 trillion, up from 24.27 trillion one year back.\n\nThis figure represents the amount of computing power applied to mining this particular cryptocurrency every 14 days based on the amount of hashing power competing for rewards on the network.\n\nA greater mining difficulty indicates that more miners are trying to obtain this cryptocurrency. Hashing refers to the amount of processing power that PCs use to build the blockchain: the more blocks of verified transactions are processed, the more bitcoin is mined. Despite a volatile market and a blizzard last month, mining difficulty adjusted every 2016 block."

        "title": "Why the Winklevoss brothers are in a $900 million crypto faceoff with Barry Silbert - CNBC",
        "content": "In this article FTT.CM=\n\nBTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nTyler Winklevoss, chief executive officer and co-founder of Gemini Trust Co., left, and Cameron Winklevoss, president and co-founder of Gemini Trust Co., speak during the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami, Florida, U.S., on Friday, June 4, 2021. Eva Marie Uzcategui | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nCameron Winklevoss and Barry Silbert were both early believers in bitcoin who made a fortune on their investments and built big businesses along the way. For nearly two years, they enjoyed a mutually beneficial partnership that made their customers a lot of money. Now, the bitcoin heavyweights are in a bruising war of words that illustrates the depths of the crypto crisis and underscores the risks that were ultimately shouldered by ordinary investors who got caught up in a massively unregulated market. As it stands, hundreds of millions of dollars of customer cash sits in inaccessible limbo as the two crypto entrepreneurs battle over who is responsible. Silbert is the founder of Digital Currency Group (DCG), a crypto conglomerate that includes the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and trading platform Genesis. Winklevoss, along with his brother Tyler, co-founded Gemini, a popular crypto exchange that, unlike many of its peers, is subject to New York banking regulation. Winklevoss and Silbert were linked through an offering called Earn, a nearly two-year-old product from Gemini that promoted returns of up to 8% on customer deposits. With Earn, Gemini loaned client money to Genesis for placement across various crypto trading desks and borrowers. As the digital coin markets soared in 2020 and 2021, that capital produced high returns for Genesis and easily paid Earn users their yield, which was very attractive at a time when the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate was at virtually zero. Other riskier (and now defunct) crypto platforms like Celsius and Voyager Digital were offering yields as high as 20%.\n\nBarry Silbert, Founder and CEO, Digital Currency Group David A. Grogan | CNBC\n\nIt was a booming business. Genesis had 260 employees and a robust sales desk, and Gemini was one of its largest lending partners, sending $900 million worth of customer crypto to the firm. Gemini considered Genesis, which is regulated by New York state and the Securities and Exchange Commission, to be the most reliable name in crypto lending, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Diversification was a challenge, because other players had looser risk standards, said the source, who asked not to be named for confidentiality.\n\nFriends turned foes\n\nIn 2022, the crypto market cratered, and the Earn model fell apart. Cryptocurrencies turned south, borrowers stopped repaying their debts, hedge funds and lenders went under, and activity screeched to a halt. The floodgates opened even wider in November, when FTX spiraled into bankruptcy and customers of the crypto exchange were unable to access billions of dollars in deposits. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was soon arrested on fraud charges, accused of using client funds for trading, lending, venture investments and his lavish lifestyle in the Bahamas. An industrywide crunch ensued as crypto investors across the board tried to withdraw their assets. Five days after FTX collapsed, Genesis was forced to freeze new lending and suspend redemptions. In a tweet the company said \"FTX has created unprecedented market turmoil, resulting in abnormal withdrawal requests which have exceeded our current liquidity.\" The contagion was so rapid that both Gemini and Genesis hired experts to guide them through a potential Genesis bankruptcy. All withdrawals on Earn have been paused since November. Gemini's 340,000 retail clients are angry, and some have come together in class actions against Genesis and Gemini. Winklevoss places the blame on Silbert's shoulders, and he's gone public with his battle to retrieve the $900 million of deposits his clients placed with Genesis. In a letter to Silbert on Jan. 2, Winklevoss said those funds belong to customers including a school teacher, a police officer and \"a single mom who lent her son's education money to you.\" Winklevoss said Gemini had been trying for six weeks to engage in a \"good faith\" manner with Silbert only to be met with \"bad faith stall tactics.\" Gemini attorneys had attempted to work with Genesis' team through the Thanksgiving holiday, but found their efforts effectively rebuffed, a source said. Another person who asked not to be named told CNBC that advisors for Genesis, DCG, and Gemini's creditor committee had met multiple times throughout the six-week period that Winklevoss referenced. Gemini creditors are represented by lawyers from both Kirkland & Ellis and Proskauer Rose, and financial advisors at Houlihan Lokey. Advisors for DCG and Genesis include the law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton and investment bank Moelis and Company. The most recent meeting between the three sets of lawyers and bankers was Monday, according to that individual. On Tuesday, Winklevoss followed up with an open letter to DCG's board, asking that it replace Silbert. One of Winklevoss' central complaints stems from a loan that Silbert made to Genesis after the demise of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) last year. Genesis was owed over $1 billion by 3AC when the firm defaulted on its debt. Silbert stepped in and effectively backstopped his trading firm's exposure with a $1.1 billion intercompany loan to Genesis. At the time, Genesis sought to reassure Gemini that the DCG unit remained solvent and strong and was supported by its parent company. Silbert justified the decision in a message to investors this week, writing that \"Genesis had unrivaled expertise and the best institutional client base in the world.\" Court filings show that on July 6, Genesis assured Gemini that liquidity was not a concern, and the two parties agreed to keep working together.\n\nwatch now\n\nGemini claims that Genesis provided misleading information regarding Silbert's loan. Rather than serving to bolster Genesis' operating position, the loan was a \"10-year promissory note\" and was a \"complete gimmick that did nothing to improve Genesis' immediate liquidity position or make its balance sheet solvent,\" Winklevoss wrote. Silbert has avoided responding directly to Winklevoss' latest accusation, though the company has taken up his defense. In a tweet on Tuesday, DCG called the letter \"another desperate and unconstructive publicity stunt,\" adding that, \"we are preserving all legal remedies in response to these malicious, fake, and defamatory attacks.\" \"DCG will continue to engage in productive dialogue with Genesis and its creditors with the goal of arriving at a solution that works for all parties,\" the company said. A DCG spokesperson told CNBC the company denies Winklevoss' allegations of financial impropriety. For the 41-year-old Winklevoss twins, a public and high-profile spat is nothing new. They're best known for their role in the birth of Facebook, now known as Meta , which was founded by Harvard classmate Mark Zuckerberg. They sued Zuckerberg, eventually settling in 2011 for a $65 million payout in cash and Facebook stock. The brothers quickly pivoted to crypto and by 2013 said they controlled 1% of all bitcoin in circulation. The stake soared from $11 million at that time to over $4.5 billion when bitcoin peaked in 2021. Silbert, 46, got into the market at around the same time. He sold his prior company, SecondMarket, to Nasdaq in 2015, and started DCG that year. But he first invested in bitcoin in 2012. Silbert and the Winklevoss brothers were bitcoin bulls long before any exchanges or trading apps had made it simple to buy digital currencies and well ahead of institutional interest in the space. Now that the trade has reversed, they're deep in the struggle. Facing increasing pressure from creditors and the looming threat of bankruptcy, Genesis recently cut headcount by 30% in a second round of layoffs. Gemini slashed 10% of its staff in June 2022, with another round of layoffs seven weeks later. Winklevoss says Gemini's thousands of customers are \"looking for answers.\" On Tuesday, Gemini told Earn clients that it's terminating customer loan agreements with Genesis and ending the program. Gemini and Genesis insist that they're negotiating in good faith. But the harsh reality is that, with the popping of the crypto bubble last year, both companies were left with no place to hide. Their clients are now scrambling to be made whole. \u2014 CNBC's Kate Rooney contributed to this report."

        "content": "Publicly-listed Bitcoin (BTC) mining company Argo Blockchain saw a significant drop in mining activity in December 2022 due to a winter storm in Texas.\n\nOn Jan. 11, Argo released its first operational update since selling its flagship mining facility Helios to Mike Novogratz\u2019s Galaxy Digital. The company said it mined 147 Bitcoin or BTC equivalents in December, compared to 198 BTC in November 2022.\n\nThe firm said that as of Dec. 31, Argo held 141 BTC, with its December mining revenue amounting to $2.49 million. Argo\u2019s total debt was approximately $79 million and its bank balance was about $20 million.\n\nAccording to the announcement, the decrease in the amount of mined BTC was mainly due to Argo curtailing mining operations at Helios in response to a major winter storm in Texas.\n\nIn late December, the United States Department of Energy declared a power emergency in Texas, citing a shortage of electricity due to the impact of severe winter weather. Amid a massive temperature drop accompanied by high winds, the demand on the Texas power grid reached an all-time winter peak in excess of 74,000 megawatts (MW).\n\nArgo CEO Peter Wall pointed out that the company\u2019s mining results were lower than expected because the firm had to reduce power usage on the grid due to extreme weather conditions.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin miners see mixed successes in tackling debt-fueled overexpansion crisis\n\nDuring the winter storm, Argo joined other Texas Bitcoin miners in reducing power usage by an estimated 1,500 MW, Wall said, adding:\n\n\u201cAfter the winter storm and associated freezing temperatures had subsided, we safely brought Helios back online and resumed operations.\u201d\n\nWall mentioned that Argo eventually decided to sell its Helios facility to Galaxy Digital, announcing the $65 million deal on Dec. 28. The transaction aimed to reduce Argo\u2019s total debt by $41 million and improve liquidity and operating structure.\n\nDespite the sale, Argo will still continue mining at the Galaxy-owned Helios facility. Argo\u2019s total hash rate capacity continues to be 2.5 exahashes-per-second, the announcement notes."

In this interview, we review 2022: the attacks on privacy, the reaffirmation of self-custody, how people who were treated like gods rekted the market, and the responsibility of Bitcoin podcasters in doing right by the audience.\n\n- - - -\n\n2022 has been brutal. First, tough lessons were learnt in trying to use Bitcoin for warranted privacy needs within North America. Then, we had our industry's very own global financial crisis when the tide went out and we saw how many of the supposed titans were swimming naked. So many people have been damaged, so many have been rekt.\n\nThe collateral damage to Bitcoin is unknown, but material. So much of that damage has come from malign and selfish actions by people who knew better. They have exploited a new form of money, which was meant to circumvent systemic centralized greed and corruption, to put into practice new more brutal forms of extraction than anything we witnessed in TradFi.\n\nBut, there are also those, whose actions have been made in good faith, who need to reflect on the events of the past year. We know where blame is centred, but how far does blame extend? Explicitly, what responsibilities do Bitcoin podcasters in general, and this Bitcoin podcaster in particular, have in regard to protecting and educating their audience?\n\n2022 has been personally brutal for a whole range of reasons. But, it is now time for reflection. It is right therefore that, as a show that assesses and comments on the industry, the tables are turned and a light is shone on this show\u2019s decision-making. There is nobody better than Odell to shine that light.\n\nFundamentally, it is the audience who will decide. I look forward to reading any comments listeners may have following one of the toughest podcasts I have hosted."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nStock trading app Robinhood warned Wednesday it would soon end support for Bitcoin SV (BSV), with plans to delist the coin later this month.\n\nRobinhood users will no longer be able to buy, sell, or transfer Bitcoin SV after Jan. 25, according to a company update. Any remaining BSV in customer accounts after that will be automatically sold with users credited accordingly.\n\n\u201cWe have a rigorous framework in place to help us regularly review the crypto we offer on Robinhood,\u201d the company stated. \u201cWhile we do not discuss the process for assets on an individual basis, based on our latest review, we\u2019ve decided to end support for Bitcoin SV.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBSV is the only coin Robinhood said will be impacted by the delisting. The platform currently offers trading on 19 different tokens through its Robinhood Crypto service, including Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nThe price of BSV fell sharply on Wednesday. Its price had decreased 11% to $39.11 over the past day as of this writing, according to data from CoinGecko. The figure represented a 92% decline in price from an all-time high of $489.75 set in April of 2021.\n\nBitcoin SV was first added to Robinhood\u2019s platform in November of 2018 after a hard fork involving Bitcoin Cash created the token. Bitcoin Cash itself is the result of a hard fork with Bitcoin\u2019s protocol.\n\nBitcoin Cash is now tradable again. We\u2019ve removed the halt following the hard fork. The fork produced a new asset, Bitcoin SV. BSV will be automatically distributed to BCH holders, who are entitled to one BSV per unit of BCH owned on the day of the fork (11/15). \u2014 Robinhood Help (@AskRobinhood) November 30, 2018\n\nA hard fork essentially creates two cryptocurrencies out of one, when changes made to a token through software updates make it incompatible with previous versions, resulting in two distinct branches.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin SV, or \u201cSatoshi\u2019s Vision,\u201d is distinct from other versions of Bitcoin, including Bitcoin Cash, because of its larger block size, which results in reduced transaction fees.\n\nBSV is currently ranked 54 among all cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization, with a total value of $745 million. It is significantly smaller than Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash with market capitalizations of $335 billion and $2 billion, respectively.\n\nThe token is only available on less than a handful of exchanges, such as OKX, KuCoin, and Huobi. Many exchanges have delisted the token from their platforms over time, including San Francisco-based OKCoin, which ended its support of BSV in February of 2021.\n\nBSV has been championed by Craig Wright, who has made unproven claims about being the true Satoshi Nakamato\u2013Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator\u2013since 2016.\n\nIn a defamation case against podcaster Peter McCormack, who had repeatedly called Wright a \u201cfraud\u201d for claiming to be Satoshi, a British court ruled Wright submitted \u201cdeliberately false\u201d evidence in August of last year.\n\nIn December, Wright\u2019s campaign to convince the masses that he created Bitcoin appeared to be coming to a close.\n\n\u201cI have been too angry for too long as I cared for external validation,\u201d he said in a Tweet. \u201cThe only validation I seek now is from my family and from seeing my ideas come to fruition and to be used by the world.\n\nIt does not matter if you like me. The goal of what I am doing is simple, global micropayments. One day, people will understand, not because it is inevitable, but because I will not give up on that goal and vision. We shall start to scale in 2023. Millions of TPS first... \u2014 Dr Craig S Wright (@Dr_CSWright) December 22, 2022\n\nAD\n\nAD"

For example, in the United Kingdom, crypto assets will be \u201cliable\u201d for inheritance tax on the death of the holder and capital gains tax on a valid disposal.\n\nRelated: Answering a morbid question: What happens to your Bitcoin when you die?\n\nIn Australia, there is no inheritance tax, but Heaver noted that there is a capital gains tax if one disposes of an asset inherited from a deceased estate.\n\nShe noted there are then jurisdictions where there are no taxes, like the United Arab Emirates.\n\nDigital asset lawyer Liam Hennessy, partner at Gadens, added that realizing digital assets at the best price can be another complication, due to factors such as price fluctuations and smart execution protocols."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price has initiated a rally after finding solid support at around $16.5K and breaking the 50-day moving average. However, the bullish momentum has weakened as the price faces a critical resistance level.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nAfter a short-term consolidation at the $16.5K support level, the price has finally started an uptrend and surpassed the 50-day moving average, which was serving as substantial resistance during the last few months.\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps safe to say that this latest rally was somewhat expected as the moving average was surpassed. however, the positive momentum seems to be on a pause, and the price now faces the 100 DMA that\u2019s located at around $17.9K as the next important target.\n\nIf Bitcoin moves beyond the aforementioned level, a move toward the multi-month descending wedge\u2019s upper trendline becomes more likely.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nIn the 4-hour timeframe, a double-bottom reversal pattern can be seen at the $16.5K level. After breaking the neckline, the price has been forming higher highs and higher lows and reached the Fibonacci retracement level of 0.5. The region between the 0.5-0.618 Fibonacci levels is regarded as a significant resistance zone in the correction stages of the market. In light of this, the cryptocurrency is currently facing a vital resistance zone and is attempting to surpass it.\n\nYet, the bullish momentum is not very promising. A rejection followed by a short-term consolidation stage between the $16.5K support and the $17.5K resistance level could be a possible outcome.\n\nOnchain Analysis\n\nThe Exchange Reserve metric represents the total number of coins held in exchanges. A considerable surge in the metric typically indicates higher selling pressure and has been indicative of a trend reversal overall.\n\nAs the chart depicts, a slight recovery can be observed right before each substantial price crash during the recent significant bearish market stage from the $69K all-time high to the $15K low. This might signify people are sending their Bitcoins to exchanges to distribute.\n\nThe metric is recovering slightly after the price broke a vital resistance region and started increasing. The big players might consider this recent rally a selling opportunity to realize their profits before further crashes. If so, the market could potentially face another bearish leg in the mid-term."

Discover SCENE\n\nShares in the troubled Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) surged on Monday, narrowing its discount from Bitcoin.\n\nThe price for the OTC-traded security jumped 11.56% yesterday, to $9.65. This brought the trust\u2019s discount against the net asset value (NAV) of its Bitcoin holdings to 38.55%, the smallest gap since mid-November.\n\nGBTC is a publicly-listed financial vehicle that gives investors exposure to Bitcoin without needing to buy and hold the asset physically. The trust had historically traded at a premium to Bitcoin but has, since late February 2022, been stuck at a hefty discount.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe uptick in its price comes despite a myriad of problems facing both the investment firm behind the trust and its parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG).\n\nGrayscale\u2019s discount woes\n\nGrayscale is the largest holder of Bitcoin in the world after the cryptocurrency\u2019s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nIt owns 643,572 Bitcoin, according to treasuries listings, the equivalent of $11.1 billion.\n\nThe GBTC discount emerged due to market volatility and shareholders' inability to redeem their shares.\n\nGrayscale has looked to convert the trust into a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), a structure that its CEO Michael Sonnenshein argues would provide better protection for investors.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut like every other entity which has applied to launch a Bitcoin ETF in the U.S., the company has been shot down by regulators. Last June, Grayscale filed a lawsuit against the SEC after it again rejected the firm's spot Bitcoin ETF application.\n\nCompetition from crypto ETFs in other countries such as Canada, as well as U.S.-traded Bitcoin futures ETFs, may also, therefore, be contributing to the discount.\n\nGrayscale under fire from investors\n\nBecause Grayscale does not offer a way to redeem their shares, GBTC holders have begun to put pressure on the firm to change their rules and introduce some form of liquidity.\n\nOn one front, the trust is facing a lawsuit accusing it of \u201cpotential mismanagement and conflicts of interest,\u201d filed by New York hedge fund Fir Tree Capital Management.\n\nOn another, rival investment firm Valkyrie has put forward a proposal to become the new sponsor and manager of GBTC. The idea is that GBTC shareholders could vote for a change of management, though there are some doubts over whether this would even be possible.\n\nMeanwhile, Grayscale\u2019s parent company DCG has become embroiled in a public spat with Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss. In a letter to DCG founder Barry Silbert sent last week, he set a deadline of January 8 to \u201cpublicly commit to working together\u201d to solve the problem of the $900 million that Genesis, another DCG portfolio company, owes Gemini Earn.\n\nIn the letter, he also accused DGC of borrowing almost $1.7 billion from Genesis, its own subsidiary.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSilbert denied this on Twitter, adding that DCG had never missed an interest payment to Genesis."

Besides, it is possible that the network is not used as much as it once was. This could be due to the increasing use of alternative cryptos like Ethereum,\" said Jonathan Merry, CEO of CryptoMonday.\n\nBitcoin stagnation can be a concern for many people in the cryptocurrency community.\n\nFor one, it signals a lack of liquidity in the market that could cause massive price swings if there is even a slight change in demand.\n\nIt could also signal that institutional investors are making BTC lose its volatility and turning it into an asset with minimal price movement, said the report.\n\n\"It may be too soon to draw any conclusions from this data. Nevertheless, it is a clear indication that 'hodlers' are increasing their holdings and remaining confident in the future of Bitcoin,\" said the report.\n\nThe BTC price remains stagnant at around $17,000 apiece for a while.\n\nIt is a possibility that BTC has reached a saturation point, with most of the people interested in buying BTC already having done so.\n\n\"Besides, the current economic conditions are not conducive to BTC growth.

        "title": "Dutch Bitcoin Exchange Bitvavo Says DCG\u2019s Payback Plan \u2018Not Acceptable\u2019 - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDutch Bitcoin exchange Bitvavo said it had rejected Digital Currency Group\u2019s (DCG) proposal to repay 70% of Genesis Trading\u2019s debt, arguing that it should be able to pay back the entirety of locked funds.\n\nLast month, the Dutch exchange revealed it had \u20ac280 million ($297 million) stuck with Genesis, holding its parent company DCG accountable for the funds. In its latest blog post, Bitvavo said that on January 9 DCG made a proposal offering to refund 70% of the outstanding amount in a period acceptable to the Dutch exchange.\n\nPer the exchange, \u201cthe latter is not acceptable because DCG has sufficient funds available for full repayment.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitvavo is the Netherlands\u2019 leading crypto exchange with a trading volume of more than $46 million in the past 24 hours, per CoinGecko.\n\nAlthough DCG maintained the funds are held by its \u201cindependent subsidiary\u201d Genesis, not DCG itself, the firm now appears to be willing to find a solution, with Bitvavo confirming active conversations with DCG to recover the resulting debt \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d\n\nThe exchange has also been adamant that recent events won't affect its users.\n\n\u201cAs consistently stated before, the current situation regarding DCG does not impact Bitvavo's customers, its platform and its services. Bitvavo has guaranteed the outstanding amount and thus assumed the risk on behalf of its customers,\u201d Bitvavo said in yesterday\u2019s blog post.\n\nThe Dutch exchange also weighed in on the ongoing feud between DCG and Gemini, citing the New York-based exchange\u2019s open letter that accuses DCG boss Silbert of deception and fraud and calls for his resignation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLike Gemini, we share the confidence that a solution can be found to the satisfaction of all concerned,\u201d said Bitvavo.\n\nA Bitvavo spokesperson told Decrypt there was nothing else the exchange could disclose beyond what\u2019s stated in the blog. DCG and Genesis did not immediately respond to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment.\n\nBitvavo piles on Genesis, DCG\n\nGenesis froze withdrawals from its lending arm on November 18, 2022, blaming FTX\u2019s collapse for \u201cabnormal withdrawal requests\u201d that exceeded its liquidity.\n\nIn a consequent letter to shareholders, DCG CEO Barry Silbert revealed the crypto conglomerate owed its own Genesis Trading arm as much as $575 million worth of intercompany loans due in May 2023. Additionally, DCG owes Genesis $1.1 billion on a promissory note due in June 2032 related to the default of Three Arrows Capital.\n\nPer a Reuters November report, aside from the money owed to Genesis, DCG\u2019s only debt was a $350 million credit facility from a small group of lenders led by investment firm Eldridge, with Silbert saying at the time the firm was still on pace to do $800 million in revenue last year.\n\nThere were more woes for Genesis in the past few weeks though, with the firm announcing a 30% cut to its workforce at the beginning of January, and Federal prosecutors in New York, along with the SEC, launching an investigation into DCG\u2019s internal transfers with its lending subsidiary."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nMicroStrategy shares, traded on NASDAQ under the ticker MSTR, are up more than 23% since the beginning of January. The first month of the new year has thus far been extremely positive for Michael Saylor's company's shares, especially after two months of unrelenting declines, during which the MSTR price fell by more than 50%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaylor, as co-founder and managing director of MicroStrategy, did not comment on the significant rise in the company's shares' quotes but once again reiterated his bullish stance on Bitcoin in his trademark style. As a reminder, Michael Saylor and company hold 132,500 BTC on the balance sheet of the company.\n\nBitcoin's beta\n\nSince the start of BTC purchases in 2020, MSTR has become a kind of beta to the major cryptocurrency. The main reason for the rebound in MicroStrategy's share price is also obviously because of the \"post-Santa rally\" that emerged in the crypto market in early 2023.\n\nAt the same time, MSTR falls and rises harder than Bitcoin itself, and on top of that experiences all the negative factors of traditional finance and the current monetary policy of the U.S. Federal Reserve. Add to that the fact that some cryptocurrency has been purchased on loan, and each increase in the Fed's rate makes the cost of that loan more expensive."

        "title": "5 signs that an altcoin bull run could be underway - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "While 2022 ended on a grim note with macro headwinds providing little hope of a revival in 2023, the start of a new year has surprised bears with a surge in Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and altcoin prices. The period of sparse volatility in the crypto market appears to be ending with a breakout to the upside.\n\nThe increase has been particularly striking in some altcoins such as Lido (LIDO), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). The primary factors promoting the spike in these coins are the upcoming Ethereum Shanghai update (for LIDO) and the negative funding rate in the futures market, especially for SOL. The negative rates implies that most traders are holding short positions, giving an opportunity for whale buyers to run their stop losses. Funding rates for some other tokens remain exposed to a short squeeze.\n\nMoreover, the new year has also seen the re-emergence of the degen gambling that had taken a back seat after the collapse of FTX in November. A memecoin price surge is evidence of the residual degen spirit. Technically, the total market capitalization of altcoins has surpassed a key technical resistance level as bullish momentum builds.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the bull run is questionable due to the broader trend remaining bearish, the fledgling uptrend could still bring some pain for late sellers. The five primary factors influencing altcoin prices are:\n\nJob market data revives the hope of a soft landing\n\nDefying Dow Jones estimates for an additional 200,000 nonfarm payrolls added in December and market expectations of a slowdown, the labor market report showed tha230,000 were added, a 0.2% increase in employment.\n\nA strong jobs market goes against the prevalent recession claims and acts as a catalyst for a risk-on rally. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading for December coming out on Jan. 12 will be instrumental in either building on the newfound bullish sentiment or returning to negative sentiments.\n\nIf inflation continued its downtrend, with December\u2019s CPI print below 7.7%, then the market's confidence in a soft landing could increase. However, if inflation rose in December, then the chances of a higher rate hike in the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting toward the end of January increase, risking a steep correction.\n\nTraders hunt for perpetual swaps with negative funding rates\n\nAs the spot trading volume and liquidity on cryptocurrency exchanges dried up toward the year-end, especially during the holiday season, futures markets gained more influence in moving the prices. A contrarian price reaction against a crowded trade position is highly likely.\n\nSolana's latest surge in prices is clear evidence of short-squeeze driving prices. Over the weekend, $200 million in SOL shorts were liquidated as its price surged over 27% from the Jan. 6 low of $13. According to independent market analyst Alex Kruger, \u201cSOL still has room to go but the outperformance phase is mostly behind.\u201d\n\nFunding rate for SOL perpetual swaps. Source: Coinglass\n\nWhile Solana\u2019s pump might be close to over, the majority of traders are still net short on numerous altcoins like Apecoin (APE), Tron (TRX), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Gala Games (GALA). This provides an opportunity for buyers to push the price up and hunt the stop-loss liquidity of perpetual swap sellers.\n\nFunding rate for altcoins across crypto exchanges. Source: Coinglass\n\nMeme coins pump, then dump\n\nIn the first week of January, a Solana-based memecoin named BONK experienced a whopping 25x surge. The rise symbolized the degenerate gambling spirit that was prevalent during the 2021 to 2022 bull run. Bear markets, on the other hand, tend to promote caution among traders.\n\nDespite BONK\u2019s eventual price collapse, the successful pump-and-dump playout of meme coins like it suggest that some traders are still indulging in high-risk plays.\n\nBONK price chart. Source: CoinGecko\n\nPositive technical breakout\n\nThe altcoin market capitalization broke above the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $465 billion. Buyers will likely target the 100-day EMA at $563 billion \u2014 an expected average 20% gain across the tokens. Technical traders would look to tap these key levels before reversal begins.\n\nThe relative strength indicator (RSI) for altcoin market capitalization also moved into bullish territory, increasing above the 60-point resistance. Furthermore, if buyers build support above the 50-day EMA with positive volumes, the short-term uptrend could extend toward the end of Q1 2023.\n\nTotal altcoin market capitalization (excluding Bitcoin). Source: TradingView\n\nHistorical trends and positive sentiment spike\n\nThe sustainability of the bullish altcoin run is questionable, especially since the underlying trend remains bearish. It\u2019s difficult to identify the fundamental catalyst supporting this bull run, and Bitcoin\u2019s price trades below its resistance of between $18,200 and $19,000. Thus, the uptrend will likely fade as buyers get exhausted.\n\nIf we look at previous crypto cycles, altcoins outperformed Bitcoin in a bull run, and the following cooldown period saw a cross-over with Bitcoin leading the crypto market gains.\n\nThe recent parabolic run of 2021 played out similarly, with altcoins outperforming Bitcoin. However, the correction period hasn\u2019t seen a wipeout of the altcoin market relative to Bitcoin.\n\nBoth altcoin market capitalization and Bitcoin\u2019s price have lost 75% of their value from the peak, as opposed to altcoin losses surpassing Bitcoin.\n\nAltcoins outperform Bitcoin during bull markets. Source: TradingView\n\nAn exception to the above rule can be due to Ether\u2019s increasing dominance in the market. Ethereum has maintained its market dominance of around 20% with technical breakthroughs such as the shift to an energy-friendly proof-of-stake mechanism and reduced inflation supporting its price strongly despite the negative trend. Still, a deeper correction in the broader altcoin market capitalization cannot be ruled out.\n\nBitcoin (orange) and Ethereum (blue) dominance over the crypto market. Source: TradingView\n\nLately, social media circles have witnessed a revival of positive sentiment. Santiment data shows that the social media mentions of keywords like \u201cbuy the dip\u201d and \u201cbottom\u201d spiked on platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Telegram. Usually, a positive sentiment spike is a top indicator suggesting a reversal of the bullish price trend.\n\nSocial media volume for \u201cbuy the dip\u201d and \u201cbottom\u201d key words. Source: Santiment\n\nOne of the first hurdles will be supporting the price after a wipeout of short orders. Being two of the first tokens to surge, Solana and Cardano could provide clues that point toward the end of the uptrend.\n\nIf the price of SOL breaks below support at $14.33 with a simultaneous drop below $0.30 for ADA, it could be a warning sign of the bull\u2019s exhaustion.\n\nAt the same time, tokens like LIDO that benefit from the liquid staking derivative narrative could continue to rise until Ethereum core developers implement the Shanghai upgrade. Macro market movers such as the CPI print and Bitcoin\u2019s price action will also play a crucial role in sustaining an altcoin bull run.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Its execution is 0.1 seconds faster than the market, making it a significant advantage provided by the platform since the software adapts to its exchange according to the cryptocurrency market conditions and volatility at the time of the trade.\n\nBitcoin Buyer Sucess Rate\n\nIt is essential to assimilate that Bitcoin Buyer is not a type of financial institution. What does this mean? It means that they aren\u2019t authorized to manage member funds. Therefore, this software has established a partnership with licensed and regulated brokers.\n\nAt this juncture, brokers act as financial entities. In this way, those who are collaborating on the platform can receive deposits made by users and facilitate their commercial activities.

However, it has not been possible to verify these figures.\n\nBitcoin Buyer has direct cooperation with regulated and licensed online brokers. These brokers have all the tools at their disposal to protect users from any scams while offering fast trades. Despite this, it is crucial to note that any business carries its risks.

        "title": "Poilievre opts into 241.8% inflation | Canada's National Observer: Climate News - Canada's National Observer",
        "content": "Conservative Opposition Leader Pierre Poilievre has not been content just to blame the Trudeau government for allowing inflation to rise to levels not seen in Canada since the 1980s. He also offered Canadians a prescription for coping with inflation until he is elected prime minister by using Bitcoin and other digital tokens known as cryptocurrencies. As early as September 2021, then-finance critic Poilievre touted \u201cdigital currencies \u2026 giving people an opportunity to protect themselves against inflation.\u201d Six months later, as a Conservative Party of Canada leadership candidate, he doubled down. At a campaign event at a restaurant, Poilievre bought a shawarma with Bitcoin and extolled \u201cthe freedom to use other money, such as Bitcoin\u2026 Choice and competition can give Canadians better money and \u2026 let Canadians opt out of inflation with the ability to opt into cryptocurrencies.\u201d Unfortunately for Poilievre, Bitcoin and other crypto tokens have crashed in value over the past year. National Observer columnist Max Fawcett noted that Bitcoin users experienced price rises verging on hyperinflation after Poilievre\u2019s call to \u201copt out of inflation with \u2026 crypto.\u201d To buy the same shawarma today, Poilievre would fork over more than double his March Bitcoin payment. The number of Bitcoins needed to pay for groceries, fuel, rent and all the other items in Statistics Canada\u2019s Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 241.8 per cent from November 2021 to November 2022. And 13.3 per cent inflation over just one month for Bitcoin users was higher than the 6.8 per cent annual inflation rate of prices in Canadian dollars, a currency Poilievre has dismissed as \u201cinferior,\u201d \u201cincreasingly worthless\u201d and \u201cruined.\u201d Poilievre\u2019s cure for inflation turned out worse than the disease. How did he go so far wrong? Poilievre fell under the spell of online crypto gurus promoting Bitcoin as a superior alternative to Milton Friedman\u2019s work seeking a monetary framework to guarantee price stability.\n\nIn a 2014 interview, Poilievre revealed that his political philosophy was formed as a teenager when he read Friedman\u2019s Capitalism and Freedom. There is no surprise that a future Conservative Party leader would cite the conservative thinker as an influencer. Poilievre\u2019s intellectual journey has since taken him from Friedman to Bitcoin evangelists such as Robert Breedlove and Saifedean Ammous. According to Ammous, Bitcoin can ensure price stability because annual supply growth is limited by design to less than two per cent, thereby providing a psychological anchor. How could prices measured in Bitcoins rise 241.8 per cent over the past year when their supply grew less than two per cent? The problem is that while the supply of Bitcoins is stable and predictable, the demand is not. Fighting wildfires \u2014 and misinformation Poilievre has lectured the House of Commons on \u201cwhat is money?\u201d but has not read Friedman carefully enough to know that neither Bitcoin nor any other crypto token fits the three-pronged definition of money used by almost all monetary policy analysts. Very few buyers and sellers use Bitcoin as a medium of exchange to complete transactions. Nor is Bitcoin a unit of account for keeping track of relative values in Canada\u2019s economy. Retail prices and salaries in help wanted ads are rarely posted in Bitcoin. No one talks about his or her annual income or property value in numbers of Bitcoins. Some owners believe that Bitcoin is still a good long-term investment. But, 2022 was not the first year when Bitcoin plunged in value. It is too volatile to be a reliable store of value for preserving wealth and buying power over time."

        "title": "Bitcoin and Altcoin Report - January Week 2 - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "Bitcoin experienced a significant bull run on Monday due to the U.S. job report that came in better-than-expected for December, alleviating investor concerns about rate hikes. While the dollar lost strength, stocks rose sharply in Europe, Asia, and the United States. The cryptocurrency market similarly mirrored the optimistic outlook of the stock market globally, with Bitcoin appearing as one of the top moving tokens.\n\nAltcoin accumulators are over the moon as Bitcoin and altcoins welcome a weekend pump. Major L1s like Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Cardano, Cosmos, Solana, and Polkadot register double-digit gains.\n\nBut is the pump healthy? Does it change any of the existing bearishness?\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the traditional market situations. Inflation is still high, although the growth of inflation is going down. That doesn\u2019t mean the economy is on track to healthy inflation.\n\nU.S. Regulations in 2023\n\nThe aftermath of FTX\u2019s collapse will predominate in American talks on crypto-regulatory issues. And finally, Sam Bankman-Fried was indicted on eight counts, including money laundering, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and securities fraud, and is currently on American soil.\n\nMembers of the U.S. Congress are still advocating for safety measures in the wake of FTX\u2019s demise, such as the proposed Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act.\n\nAdditionally, the regulatory discussion will likely center on stablecoins. With a record $7T settled in 2022, stablecoins have proven their product-market fit and are widely employed in DeFi applications, for international trade, and as a practical medium of exchange.\n\nHowever, stablecoin governance continues to be a crucial topic for legislative discussion, particularly in light of novel vulnerabilities like the use of admin keys.\n\nThe Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee, which hold different opinions on cryptocurrencies, govern the SEC. We may observe moderation in the SEC\u2019s stance toward cryptocurrencies as new representatives take over the House Financial Service Committee.\n\nThe CFTC, under the oversight of the Senate Agriculture Committee and House Agriculture Committee, is anticipated to take a more favorable position toward digital assets.\n\nAs the SEC and CFTC determine whose jurisdiction will rule over exchanges, stablecoins, and cryptocurrency security status, we can anticipate further moves on the U.S. regulatory front.\n\nWhat Is the Fed\u2019s Strategy?\n\nRecent CPI data suggests that the Fed does not want to hurt the market to fix the rampant inflation. So the million-dollar question is: What could be the response of the Fed in the coming quarters?\n\nSigns of recession in the housing and manufacturing sector are clearly the themes of 2023. That means house rents might fall rapidly over the next few quarters, and land/building costs will follow the trajectory. It also provides an opportunity for real estate investment, but we are crypto travelers.\n\nBut would it be overwhelming to suggest that investing in real estate is possible with crypto? Let\u2019s look at the project $RIO.\n\nRealio Network is a crypto-based real-world assets investment project. It has a market cap of $1.1 million and a fully diluted valuation of $1.6 million. The project is currently in the testnet phase on the Ethereum, Algorand, and Stellar networks.\n\nBack to the Feds, the interest rate hike is set to be a regular phenomenon. The inflation target of 2% can be fatal to the market if executed at a go. But a slower path seems to be in the best of everyone\u2019s interests. Stocks shall continue to bleed, and Bitcoin shall retest the lows.\n\nHowever, the Fed plans to increase the interest rates to 5% over the year. That means constant sell pressure from seasonal investors.\n\nStatus of Fed Net Assets\n\nFed Net Assets are the total assets in the Fed balance sheet. Historically, during a bull run, Feds increase asset holdings because they outperform cash. Similarly, in a bear market, Feds decrease asset holdings because cash can retain value more than credit-based assets.\n\nCrypto Hedge Fund Ouroboros Capital reflects that in each low in net assets, the stock market finds a new low.\n\nSince April 2022, this is the worst drawdown liquidity. The last three times this data point printed a new low, we immediately witnessed SPX print a new low (red circles). Equities should quickly catch up to the spread.\n\nIt could be yet another bloodbath for Bitcoin and altcoins, as FUD around Huobi going illiquid remain strong.

        "title": "Can you overclock a Bitcoin miner? Here's how and results - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "As the cryptocurrency industry continues to expand, crypto mining is one of the most popular ways to earn passive income, and many crypto mining enthusiasts are wondering how they can increase the amount of Bitcoin (BTC) they generate.\n\nOne of the options is running an overclocked mining machine. However, while overclocking a Bitcoin miner by putting a second power supply on it seems like an attractive idea, a question arises as to whether this is actually worth it, especially when taking into account the variable electricity costs.\n\nWith this in mind, crypto YouTuber Drew Vosk has decided to put an overclocked ASIC miner to the test, to check how much Bitcoin he can mine with it, as well as how much electricity it uses up, demonstrating the results of this experiment in a video published on January 10.\n\nOverclocking Bitcoin miner\n\nTo overclock a Bitcoin miner requires adding an additional power supply, which requires an additional power supply cable. For this purpose, Vosk used a miner with such a capability \u2013 MicroBT Whatsminer M30S+, which originally comes with a 3,400w power capable of producing 100 terahashes (T/s) per second.\n\nThis miner is then tuned to produce 139 T/s at 5,500w, in order to demonstrate the overclocking capability. M30S+ uses dual power modification. In other words, it comes with pre-installed Manifold Mining dual PSU modification, which results in a maximum power availability of 6,000w.\n\nWhen running a mining machine of such power, it is always important to keep in mind the level of noise it produces, especially when it is used in the highest setting. Therefore, its location is of tremendous importance.\n\nIs it worth it?\n\nSince putting the miner on the highest overclock setting, Vosk reported achieving a reliable and stable daily result of over 134 T/s. Taking into account the current BTC price and the ViaBTC mining pool fees, this earned him about $8, which isn\u2019t profitable from a residential mining point of view but can still be if super-cheap electricity is available.\n\nIf it isn\u2019t, then a non-2PSU version of the miner might be a better-suited and more economical option. Finally, as Vosk concludes, mining with an overclocked machine is basically a numbers game that boils down to comparing one\u2019s electricity rates and the value of Bitcoin generated.\n\nElsewhere, ASIC mining is among Vosk\u2019s suggestions of various options to mine Bitcoin as an alternative to mining using graphics cards or graphics processing units (GPUs), others being hard drive mining, 5G mining, and Equihash mining, as Finbold reported.\n\nOn the other hand, if independence from the local grid and offsetting the energy waste produced by mining Bitcoin is what you\u2019re looking for, then using solar power instead might be the right choice, although the results might vary.\n\nWatch the entire video below:"

        "title": "Faketoshi Series (Hal Finney): The men who are not Satoshi\u2014Part 3 - CoinGeek",
        "content": "Who is Satoshi Nakamoto? The pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin was a mystery to the computer science and cryptography world for many years. While Dr. Craig Wright was doxed as Bitcoin\u2019s creator by Wired and Gizmodo in 2015, the politics of Bitcoin have muddied the waters and made a rational discussion of the facts very difficult to have with a mainstream audience. Since then, the term \u201cFaketoshi\u201d has become ubiquitous with anyone who makes personal claims about the muddied history of Bitcoin and Satoshi Nakamoto. This is largely because of the perverse incentives of wealth that have been created in the gray areas where the truth hasn\u2019t shined a light, and this article aims to clarify what it means to be a Faketoshi in 2023.\n\nThe small blocker BTC crowd holds a deeply political view about the nature of the Bitcoin protocol and its governance, and therefore gives a lot of weight to candidates who agree principally with their view of permanently small blocks, UASF governance (User Activated Soft Fork), and an ethos of \u201ccode-is-law\u201d from the cypherpunk community. While some candidates, like Dave Kleiman, have been proven in court not to have helped create Bitcoin, a great deal of populist candidates still get brought up regularly.\n\nWe previously discussed why Nick Szabo and Adam Back\u2019s reputations as maybe being Satoshi fall apart, and how they have benefited tremendously from the ambiguity that they maintain on the subject.\n\nIn this article, we will see the exact opposite from Hal Finney: a man who has exponentially more right than Szabo or Back to take credit for early contributions to Bitcoin, yet benefited from it substantially less because of his humility and a terrible misfortune.\n\nEveryone\u2019s favorite\n\nHal Finney seems, by all accounts, to have been a very nice, kind, hard-working person. He was a universally well-liked member of the Bitcoin community from week one, and he fit the profile of what the earliest bitcoiners assumed Satoshi Nakamoto should have looked like. In fact, the more a good man reads about Hal Finney, the more a good man should be inspired to be a good man too!\n\nHe was a politically minded, but non-combative libertarian, a cypherpunk activist, member of various cryptography and cypherpunk forums and mailing lists, and he was an avid coder with big opinions about digital cash and cryptography. He was also probably the second miner on the network\u2014joining at some point in the block height between 70-80 and announcing it on twitter with the first Bitcoin tweet in history.\n\nRunning bitcoin \u2014 halfin (@halfin) January 11, 2009\n\nHal even worked in commercial applications of public key cryptography at PGP Corporation, and he may have been the first person to ever implement a proof of work system in his \u201cReusabal Proofs of Work\u201d or \u201cRPOW\u201d application noting its potential usefulness in digital cash or in fighting against email SPAM.\n\nBut Hal wasn\u2019t Satoshi\n\nWhile Finney was absolutely involved in the earliest public days of bitcoin and deserves credit for being a great believer in the system and a confidant to Satoshi, a little bit of digging makes it pretty clear that he could not have been Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin.\n\nWindows, Mac, Linux.\n\nWe know Satoshi Nakamoto was a Windows user. A borderline exclusive Windows user, which is a major point that made Nakamoto stand out as an anomaly in the coding world where Mac and Linux systems are more common.\n\nFor example, Nakamoto asked Laszlo Hanyecz to code up Bitcoin on MacOS because he didn\u2019t even have a Mac to work on.\n\nAccording to Hanyecz, \u201cBitcoin originally didn\u2019t work on Mac. So I ported it to that. Satoshi actually asked me to do the releases for MacOS. I would do the build because he didn\u2019t have a Macintosh. He didn\u2019t know how to build it for Mac. So I was doing that and it was actually my binaries that were being posted.\u201d\n\nHowever, we know Hal Finney was a Mac user, as he tweeted about it, explained how to use PGP work-arounds on Mac systems and was comfortable speaking about working in Mac environments.\n\nGoing to Google calendar page causes an infinite loop of redirects for both my wife's and my Macs. Google status page says AOK? \u2014 halfin (@halfin) June 9, 2010\n\nBitcoin isn\u2019t crypto\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto was also heavily presumed not to be a professional coder or cryptographer. Notably, Nakamoto used elliptic curve secp256k1 which is a very particularly uncommon curve. Most professional cryptographers would have chosen a curve that confirmed to NIST standards. When asked about it by Hanyecz, Nakamoto was said to say, \u201cI had a bunch of people look at it, and they told me this was good,\u201d according to a 2020 interview with Cointelegraph. This is a very bizarre way to pick an elliptical curve to secure the system if one understood cryptography.\n\nGavin Andresen, Bitcoin\u2019s second lead maintainer, once called Nakamoto\u2019s use of SSL \u201ckind of naive\u201d and also criticized his lack of documentation for things like Schnorr or Lamport signatures, which would have been standard practice for a cryptographer even if they weren\u2019t used.\n\nAndresen also pointed out the amateurity of Nakamoto\u2019s quote on the topic of cryptography in Bitcoin.\n\nAndresen closed saying, \u201cBut key blinding and group signatures are concepts from Crypto 101\u2026 Satoshi was a brilliant programmer, but he didn\u2019t have a deep understanding of all the cutting edge crypto research that\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nPeter Todd also mentions Satoshi\u2019s lack of cryptography chops on Reddit saying, \u201cHe made many design decisions that suggest he wasn\u2019t a \u2018professional\u2019 cryptographer\u2026 the fact that the defender in the Bitcoin system only has a linear advantage over the attacker, rather than an exponential one, really runs contrary to how cryptographic systems are designed, yet in the case of Bitcoin social and economic factors make such a system work anyway; that\u2019s the kind of idea that often takes an outsider with a fresh perspective\u2026\u201d\n\nBut rather than being some kind of amateur, naive outsider to crypto, Hal Finney was a highly credentialled cryptographer at the cutting edge of crypto technology. In fact, he was hired by the legendary Phil Zimmerman at PGP and Finney coded up the benchmark PGP 2.0 implementation, which is widely regarded as the first great implementation of the technology in the world, and he stayed at the head of the field until retirement.\n\nHe was a leading expert in cryptography such that he was cited by other cryptographers in their white papers about cryptography. Daniel Bleichenbacher of Bell Labs cited Finney specifically for his expertise on SSL in his 1998 white paper, \u201cChosen Ciphertext Attacks Against Protocols Based on the RSA Encryption Standard PKCS #1,\u201d while folks like Andresen criticized the amateurish nature of Nakamoto\u2019s use of SSL.\n\nFinney notably won challenges to break Netscape\u2019s SSL encryption \u201cin short order,\u201d as he put it. So, Finney was at the forefront of his field in cryptography throughout the Bitcoin years when Satoshi Nakamoto was making amateurish decisions and statements about the use of cryptography and SSL implementations. This doesn\u2019t make sense if Finney was Nakamoto.\n\nFurthermore, Hal had disagreements with Nakamoto\u2019s implementation security on more than one occasion, and (with a nod to his crypto sensibilities) disliked the privacy model of bitcoin as Satoshi envisioned it.\n\nLooking at ways to add more anonymity to bitcoin \u2014 halfin (@halfin) January 21, 2009\n\nCoding abilities and style\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto had a unique coding style with peculiar grammar in the C++ language, which is a powerful, object-oriented language built as an extension of the \u201cC\u201d programming language. C uses similar rules, but is ultimately a more rigid language used for system applications and low-level programming applications.\n\nBy contrast, Finney was a C programmer with limited experience in C++, and his contributions to bitcoin were heavily weighted to code and security auditing of what Nakamoto had created. In Finney\u2019s own words to journalist Andy Greenberg, he explains the difference in their coding styles.\n\nSecurity\n\nIn a security audit, a coder is not supposed to audit their own work. Their own edits should have already been done before handing over for an audit, and this is what Nakamoto did with Finney: he handed over the code for a third party audit. Finney and Nakamoto were both experts in security practices, so they would not have skipped this or faked it. And we are blessed that their private emails have been made public by Finney\u2019s wife and son, Fran and Jason Finney.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that Ray \u201cBear\u201d Dillinger was also involved to some degree in these audits and early feedback sessions, and the three of them communicated together, which is a tough charade to manage both in written word and in code syntax. If we are to believe that Finney was pretending to be Nakamoto while also being himself in this complex process, we are asking a lot of the man!\n\nAccording to Dillinger, \u201cHal and I were essentially giving it a last-minute looking over to see if we thought there was any way to attack it\u201d in November 2008. The code is still available on BitcoinTalk.\n\nIn this era of Bitcoin, the pre-release and version 0.1 was replaced by new versions very quickly because of Finney\u2019s expert reporting and debugging.\n\nAn example from Finney to Nakamoto:\n\nAnd Nakamoto\u2019s response:\n\nThe above conversation went back and forth working out several bugs that was crashing Bitcoin and led to versions 0.1.2 and 0.1.3 in order to get it running as expected. Again, this is peculiar behavior to simulate in private emails, if we are assuming it was a ruse put on by Finney.\n\nIt is also crucial to reiterate the danger of not having a third party audit of financial code, so it is unlikely that Finney could be Nakamoto and juggled the task of a complex charade while also successfully completing the audit and releasing the code.\n\nWorldview differences\n\nSimilarly in the evidence published against Szabo, Finney has fundamental disagreements with Nakamoto on the implementation, purpose and use of Bitcoin. Finney also seemed to think Nakamoto and his invention were cavalier, insecure and generally flawed on both technical and philosophical points.\n\nNotably, Finney did not like the concept of competitive mining, excessive emissions of the mining process or a number of things about the competitive game theory of the system. In fact, he seems to have wanted miners to be altruistic for social value\u2014at least in theory.\n\nSatoshi\u2019s response is curiously obtuse. Is he saying the libertarian viewpoint is in harmoney with Finney\u2019s thoughts? In my opinion, this is a contrasting retort. Libertarians are fiercely competitive, so it can perhaps be assumed that Nakamoto is saying that competition is the attractive part. That is what I have always assumed on this point.\n\nThis is reinforced by Nakamoto\u2019s advocacy for Bitcoin to move into server farms with specialized hardware. He clearly saw the need for industrialization of nodes and hashing, which would infer that the \u201clibertarian\u201d comment meant the opposite of \u201chome compute\u2026 volunteer\u2026 for good causes.\u201d\n\nFinney also clearly worried about the environmental impact of mining at scale which shows Finney was concerned about \u201cproblems\u201d created by industrialization.\n\nThinking about how to reduce CO2 emissions from a widespread Bitcoin implementation \u2014 halfin (@halfin) January 27, 2009\n\nThis is in deep contrast to the view of Nakamoto who predicted and advocated for large scale specialization and industrialization!\n\nAccording to Dillinger, Finney also introduced the concept of a block size limit. Being primarily concerned with security over usability, Finney saw the risks of a DoS attack on Bitcoin unless there was a consensus level throttle.\n\nThis is in contrast to Nakamoto\u2019s position on node consolidation and his view that Bitcoin was meant to scale past Visa \u201cwith existing hardware\u201d in his early communications with Mike Hearn. This would require massive block size!\n\nHe also believed that Bitcoin\u2019s purpose was to process as many transactions as possible with nodes competing to be the best at processing the most transactions as efficiently as possible.\n\nLastly, Nakamoto AGAIN predicted GPU cards and specialization explaining that Bitcoin is only vulnerable \u201cwhen it\u2019s small.\u201d\n\nConclusion\n\nHal Finney deserves an incredible amount of gratitude and credit for his contributions to bitcoin, but it\u2019s clear that he was not Satoshi Nakamoto. He disagreed with major parts of the design and the implementation. He also wasn\u2019t prone to sock puppetry or any of the qualities one might expect from someone trying to play both sides an identity con. Lastly, he vehemently denied that he was bitcoin\u2019s creator multiple times in his life, and based on his general sincerity, I believe him.\n\nTo believe that Hal Finney was Satoshi Nakamoto is to believe that the details in his heartfelt farewell note to the Bitcoin community were a lie. I don\u2019t believe Hal Finney was a liar or had a dishonest bone in his body, and it would be a disservice to his legacy to conclude otherwise.\n\nHal was proud to receive 10 bitcoins from Satoshi Nakamoto. His son Jason shared a screenshot with Andy Greenberg showing them in his wallet.\n\nAnd he was proud to \u201cthe first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin.\u201d\n\nIn his farewell, he continued with pride, \u201cI mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.\u201d\n\nAnd Hal Finney closed with: \u201cI\u2019m comfortable with my legacy.\u201d\n\nAnd what a legacy!\n\nHal Finney was a seasoned distance runner, and a happily married father of two. The neuro-muscular disease ALS slowly changed Finney from a man of incredible strength, and it reduced him to complete paralysis before his untimely death.\n\nThrough it all, he remained upbeat, optimistic and dedicated to his family and his work. He cared about his children and the legacy that he would leave as a security innovator, free thinker, contributor to Bitcoin and a friend to Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nIn his last days and for some time after his death in 2014, criminal extortionists made the life of the Finneys unpleasant with threats and cyber attacks against their family\u2014an awful consequence of the culture of Bitcoin becoming so deeply toxic, so let us remember to defend the weak and to always be good to each other.\n\nIf you would like to donate to research to find a cure for ALS, the disease that took Hal\u2019s life, watch the video.\n\nWatch: Fran Finney for the 2023 Running Bitcoin Challenge\n\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

He says his goal is to see developers bring ideas from concept to working applications in just a few months\u2014or even weeks.\n\nHe said BSV has probably benefitted from the declining interest in other chains that happened \u201call of a sudden, out of nowhere.\u201d The digital asset market remains in a big downturn, while individual companies and blockchains have suffered numerous glitches and scandals.\n\n\u201cFor Bitcoin to succeed, we don\u2019t have to do anything. We just have to survive long enough, and all the other blockchains, they just kind of implode, without us doing anything.\u201d\n\nJust build, show people what we can do\n\nXiaohui divides his highlights for 2022 into sections. There was the period leading up to the Global Blockchain Convention in Dubai, his first Bitcoin conference in years, and a chance to reconnect with many people he hadn\u2019t seen in years.\n\nIn Dubai, Xiaohui introduced the sCrypt Transpiler (to a standing ovation). The Transpiler is a tool that converts Solidity contracts written for Ethereum into Bitcoin-compatible sCrypt code, allowing developers to port any application they wrote for Ethereum to the BSV blockchain. He also demonstrated that BSV has the capability to run entirely other blockchain networks on its own chain. There\u2019s been an amount of interest in BSV from other blockchain developers interested in migrating their applications.\n\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nDevelopers and users just want something that works, Xiaohui says, and as long as they\u2019re not idealogues in favor of one network over another, just showing what Bitcoin can do is good enough for them.\n\nPost-Dubai, the highlight was realizing that Bitcoin can also run Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), providing cryptographic proof that data exists without revealing it. This is significant as it allows users to prove they own pieces of potentially private or sensitive information (like IDs, confidential or proprietary data) and use it without uploading the data itself to public blockchain records.\n\nIt\u2019s like the difference between chess, where all players can see all the moves, and games like poker and Battleship, where the game only works if some existent information is hidden from the other player. You can\u2019t put this hidden information on the public blockchain, but you still need some way to prove it\u2019s true.\n\nXiaohui says ZKPs are \u201clike a mathematical magical box.\u201d It\u2019s a fairly new concept, and running it on a blockchain network is difficult since it involves heavy computation work. But BSV can do it, and to Xiaohui that opens up a new universe of potential applications, even allowing Bitcoin to provide Amazon Web Services-level support for blockchain apps.\n\nThis way, if a developer wants to build an on-chain game, all they need to do is write the game logic itself. All the blockchain interactions, like wallet interactions and transaction broadcasting, can happen with sCrypt\u2019s toolkits and APIs. The goal is to make this as simple as creating any \u201cWeb 2.0\u201d application, the kind that dominates the internet today.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very bullish on games for Bitcoin,\u201d he says, since they\u2019re a medium that attracts a lot of attention from the outside world. Also, people should need to see that games can be trusted before sending their life savings to some blockchain DeFi platform.\n\nsCrypt in 2022 also co-organized the Zero-Knowledge Hackathon, which encouraged developers to try something new and build working prototypes for a $45,000 prize pool. Xiaohui was impressed by the level of interest and hopes that the Hackathon can become an annual event.\n\nOne other highlight towards the end of 2022 was when sCrypt launched scryptTS, a tool that lets developers write contract code in the more familiar TypeScript language (which adds types to JavaScript). scryptTS integrates TypeScript/Javascript libraries seamlessly, making for easier creation and debugging. Xiaohui hopes this brings in even more newcomers than sCrypt\u2019s Transpiler for Solidity.\n\nIn 2023, developing Bitcoin contracts will get easier\n\nXiaohui is optimistic about 2023 because he says it will mark Bitcoin\u2019s transition from mostly technical and theoretical discussions about what\u2019s possible to see the first usable applications appear.\n\nOne of the most depressing issues in Bitcoin until now has been the \u201cso how do I do it?\u201d question, he says. You can produce nuclear energy by applying Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity, but there are still some large gaps between knowing that formula and building a working power plant. Providing building tools for BSV apps allows developers to come over and experiment without having to learn years of detail first.\n\nXiaohui\u2019s biggest wish for 2023 is what you\u2019d expect from a developer, and that\u2019s to focus more on the tech, more people tinkering, building, and less focus on things like ideological controversies and court cases.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m saying I\u2019m super excited about 2023. We kind of handled things in previous years, but this year we\u2019re going to make it ten times, even hundreds of times, bigger. If we\u2019ve done our job right, there could be thousands of new people joining (BSV) in the next year or two.\u201d\n\nWatch: London Blockchain Conference 2023 \u2013 Bringing government and enterprise ono the blockchain\n\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"> \ufeff\n\nNew to blockchain?

(KOTA) - South Dakota legislators today (Wednesday) heard about concerns that bitcoin mining on the high plains of Harding County in northwest South Dakota may not be going according to plan.\n\nA cryptocurrency maker obtained natural gas leases in Harding County from the state\u2019s School and Public Lands to produce electricity to power large computers that \u201cmine\u201d bitcoin.\n\nOne official says the project looks like large boxes or buildings on the short grass prairie.\n\nHowever, the Joint Appropriations Committee members this morning (Wednesday) heard from School and Public Lands officials and others that there are problems.\n\nThe first is that crypto coin values have decreased from what promoters expected.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has fallen on hard times,\u201d said School and Public Lands land agent Mike Cornelison.\n\nSecond, according to officials, the leaseholder owes back taxes to Harding County.\n\nAnd third, state law requires that if a well is not in production for five years, it must be plugged. And there are inactive wells that need plugging.\n\nLegislators asked new School and Public Lands Commissioner Brock Greenfield who is ultimately responsible for making sure the leases are paid and wells that need to be plugged are capped.\n\nGreenfield said he was.\n\n\u201cIt falls on me,\u201d Greenfield, a former legislator, said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get answers to you. It is our job to be stewards of our resources.\u201d\n\nHowever, he and other officials said School and Public Lands also works closely with the state Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources in monitoring the wells and capping them if necessary.\n\nThe committee took no action. Committee Co-Chair Sen. Jean Hunhoff (R-Yankton) did ask that DANR be ready to answer legislators\u2019 questions about the natural gas wells in a subsequent hearing.\n\nCopyright 2023 KOTA.

        "title": "Who Will Ask Larry Summers About His Crypto Shenanigans? - Common Dreams",
        "content": "On Tuesday, Cameron Winklevoss publicly accused Barry Silbert, the CEO of cryptocurrency conglomerate DCG, of engaging in an elaborate fraud to illicitly pump up the bitcoin holdings of its subsidiary Genesis Global Capital. The Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice have both opened early-stage investigations into DCG and Genesis, likely to look into similar claims.\n\nWhile we of course condemn fraud and hope that any retail investors will be made whole, the Revolving Door Project doesn\u2019t especially care if one crypto tech bro (Silbert) happened to follow in the footsteps of Mark Zuckerberg and dupe a pair of crypto tech bro twins (Winklevoss). We do care about the individuals who are left as collateral damage, and that the architect of the possible con (Silbert) was advised the whole time by another person with whom the Winklevoss twins have an infamous history: former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if Summers is difficult to reach, the man clearly loves to be quoted.\n\nAccording to a book about the rise of Bitcoin, Silbert brought on Summers as an advisor to DCG in 2016 specifically to open doors for him and his company on Wall Street and in foreign banks. At the time, Bitcoin was still widely (and rightly) seen as a gimmick at best and a scam at worst, but Summers\u2019 support for Bitcoin made DCG, and Bitcoin, appear more respectable to investors, journalists, academics, and regulators.\n\nSummers worked with DCG for over six years. Particularly last year, during a high point for Bitcoin and crypto more broadly, he issued widely-reported public pronouncements about the crypto industry, including declaring that Bitcoin \u201cis here to stay.\u201d Summers also called for new regulation of the crypto industry, saying \u201cI think it\u2019s a recognition that all industries need to come to that are systemic in their importance.\u201d This call for new, crypto-unique regulation is actually in line with figures like Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s strategy at the time to establish a crypto-specific regulatory regime. This would have both institutionalized crypto as a permanent and systemically important part of the financial system, and held it to a separate, likely softer, standard than run-of-the-mill securities. Very few journalists, especially in the mainstream non-crypto-focused media, ever disclosed Summers\u2019 connections to one of Bitcoin\u2019s most prominent businessmen while quoting his views.\n\nIn fact, DCG is just one of several crypto-related firms to which Summers lent his name and reputation. Now, as DCG and the broader industry implodes, Summers\u2019 name has mysteriously vanished from the company\u2019s website. The crypto news website Protos also reported that Summers quietly removed any mention of DCG from his personal website after being contacted by Protos about his sudden disappearance from DCG\u2019s site.\n\nConsidering how much of the financial press eagerly solicits Summers\u2019 take on every imaginable economics topic, it\u2019s bizarre that no reporters have gotten his thoughts about his involvement in this crumbling company, and the asset class it promotes. Is anyone going to ask the former Treasury Secretary why he worked for years with a possible fraudster? What did he know, and when did he know it? If Winklevoss\u2019 assertions prove true, how was the former Treasury Secretary fooled by Silbert\u2019s scheme, which seems to have been pretty obvious self-dealing? How much due diligence does Summers conduct before sharing his name, status as former Treasury Secretary, and time with a corporation as a formal \u201cBoard Advisor\u201d? What value did Summers believe DCG provided the world? Does he still think crypto has emancipatory potential? If not, when did his mind change, and why?\n\nBy all appearances, Summers is dancing the same dance with crypto as he did in the 90\u2019s and 00\u2019s with traditional finance: preach the gospel of \u2018innovation\u2019 while the music plays, then change into a sober-minded skeptic when the music stops. Sure, everyday people lose their life savings in the bubble while he\u2019s feeding it, but the important thing to Summers is that his reputation remains intact.\n\nThis intact reputation appears to also be of value to the journalists who quote him, regardless of whether figures as distinct as Brooksley Born, Robert Reich, Christie Romer, and crypto skeptics have proven far more accurate.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not as if Summers is difficult to reach, the man clearly loves to be quoted. The least the media can do before he next urges a higher unemployment rate while lounging on a tropical beach is to ask him some hard questions, as DCG appears to circle the financial and legal drain. Better yet, financial reporters should take this as an opportunity to finally learn that just because a man has a fancy title and talks like a walking thesaurus neither means he\u2019s right, nor means he isn\u2019t playing you for a fool."

Currently, Tesla has about 42,902 Bitcoins, lagging behind MicroStrategy which has a total of 1,32,500 Bitcoins. MicroStrategy Incorporated is a Viginia-based American company that provides business intelligence, mobile software, and cloud-based services. The BTC holdings have been revealed in the latest study by Indian crypto asset management platform in its report titled Crypto Overview 2023.\n\nAccording to the report, global currencies continue to face the heat due to the perpetual dominance of dollars and the imminent threat of CNY emerging as the big financial bully in the future.\n\nKunji\u2019s crypto report has published details of a total of five different organisations with the most number of Bitcoin holdings.\n\nALSO READ: From India To El Salvador: How Governments Across The World Embraced Crypto In 2022\n\nGalaxy Digital ranks third on the list of companies with the maximum number of Bitcoin holdings globally.

It means that we are now experiencing an introduction to the bull reign. And the 50-day MA is over the 200-day and the distance between the two moving averages is wide, which are good signs for a bull run.\n\nThe resistance of BTC lies at $17550.46 and $17597.18, while the support is at the previous strong low, $16889.01. Moreover, there is an order block placed around $17222.60 and $17139.74, whereas buyers are waiting for a reversal miracle to happen. The RSI of Bitcoin is positioned at 62 which is a strong area, so we can expect a price reversal at an RSI level of 70.\n\nETH/USDT 1-Hour Price Analysis (Source \u2013 TradingView)\n\nAnother major cryptocurrency in the market, Ethereum has been positively fluctuating since the start of 2023. Moreover, the RSI of Ethereum is at 57.24. Seeing the price trading closely above the 50-day MA indicates that we can expect a sideways market for a while. It is more advisable to wait for a certain breakout to one side of the channel and take the trade to achieve a better risk-to-reward ratio.\n\nThe price is also above 200-day MA since the bulls can reverse the price from the downtrend. The bearish scenario is likely to happen if Ethereum breaks the lower trendline of the rising wedge. If so, we can expect Ethereum\u2019s bearish price will be $1,270. Another possible scenario is that Ethereum\u2019s price can reach $1,380.\n\nHowever, investors need to look out for the Consumer Price Index data which will be released tomorrow, January 12, 2023, for more liquidity pull and rugs.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "As the cryptocurrency market starts to recover back into the green zone with Bitcoin (BTC) leading the charge, the flagship digital asset doesn\u2019t lack vocal supporters, including the early Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) investor Bill Miller III.\n\nSpecifically, Miller believes that Bitcoin is \u201cdramatically different\u201d from the entities such as FTX and Celsius Network, the failure of which has put off many potential investors from the crypto field, as he explained in an interview on CNBC\u2019s \u2018Closing Bell\u2019 on January 6.\n\nAccording to the legendary investor:\n\n\u201cThe FTX collapse, that was a centralized enterprise, as was Celsius, and I think that it\u2019s very important to understand that Bitcoin is dramatically different from that.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Miller has drawn attention to the troubles in the traditional markets during the pandemic, when they scrambled for liquidity, and the Federal Reserve had to step up and throw them a lifeline, whereas Bitcoin did just fine on its own:\n\n\u201cThe Fed had to come in and clean those markets by just injecting the massive amounts of liquidity, Bitcoin trades 24/7/365. There wasn\u2019t a hiccup in the Bitcoin market.\u201d\n\nWhat about volatility?\n\nFurther comparing Bitcoin to the traditional markets, the famed investor touched upon the long-criticized volatility of the maiden crypto asset, stressing that \u201cthe market is up 70% and Bitcoin is up 190%. (\u2026) In the past month or so, it has been less volatile than the market.\u201d\n\nA well-known Bitcoin bull, Miller has earlier expressed his surprise at the \u201cremarkable\u201d performance of the largest digital asset by market capitalization in spite of the recent troublesome events, like the FTX implosion and the arrest of its founder Sam Bankman-Fried, that have shaken the crypto sector, as Finbold reported.\n\nA respected investment expert with a portfolio that consistently beat the S&P 500 Index from 1991 to 2005, Miller has also recently disclosed shares in crypto investment firm Silvergate Capital (which recently sank 40%) and crypto trading platform Coinbase.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin was at press time trading at the price of $17,273.91, up 0.01% on the day, as well as recording an increase of 3.16% over the week, adding up to the 0.67% gain on its monthly chart.\n\nBitcoin 7-day price chart.

        "content": "One of the world\u2019s largest asset managers, BlackRock, recently broke the news that it will add Bitcoin as an eligible investment in its funds.\n\nThe investment will be eligible on Global Allocation Fund, the fund invests globally in equities, debt securities and short-term instruments of both public and private issuers, without limitation.\n\nThe news was also leaked through the discovery of the company\u2019s deposit of 15 billion in Bitcoin futures registered with the CFTC.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s investment in Bitcoin\n\nBlackRock executives state:\n\n\u201cThe Fund may invest in cash-settled bitcoin futures that are traded on commodity exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\u201d\n\nThis $15 billion investment fund will be dedicated to investing in tokens, securities and debt obligations and will be able to allocate part of its funds to cash-settled Bitcoin futures traded through exchanges registered with the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nWhat does the integration of Bitcoin into this investment fund mean?\n\nSuch a globally important fund could accelerate Bitcoin\u2019s institutional entry into the global market.\n\nThe exposure that BlackRock\u2019s Global Allocation Fund will give the currency will make it even more visible, which would result in more optimism for the future of the oldest cryptocurrency.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s bet on Bitcoin is not a new one; rather, as early as last year, the firm added Bitcoin futures to the derivative products in which some funds could invest.\n\nIn the second half of the year, BlackRock opened the door to direct investments in Bitcoin, allowing its investors to invest and gain exposure to the cryptocurrency in the spot market through a private cryptocurrency investment fund.\n\nThe growing demand from BlackRock\u2019s cryptocurrency investors has prompted the asset manager to once again take a big step into the world of blockchain.\n\nThus arriving to launch new services, through large investments in Bitcoin custody and trading.\n\nLarry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, during an interview with CNBC in 2021, revealed:\n\n\u201cI think there is a very important role for a digitized currency (Bitcoin), and I think it will help consumers around the world.\u201d\n\nHis vision with respect to Bitcoin\u2019s future is undoubtedly very optimistic.\n\nBlackRock and the rescue of Core Scientific\n\nFollowing the various crises crypto exchange platforms have experienced, Bitcoin miners have also been in trouble.\n\nFor instance, Core Scientific Inc. ended up in bankruptcy. Nevertheless, the miners will continue to work and be operational, thanks to BlackRock.\n\nIn fact, the asset manager said it has lent $17 million to the US trading company, allowing it not to go completely bankrupt.\n\nClearly, the reason for the loan stems from the fact that the BlackRock asset manager holds funds and accounts tied to Core Scientific Inc. or related subsidiaries.\n\nCertain sources explain that BlackRock also holds $37.9 million in secured convertible bonds of Core Scientific Inc.\n\nThe first bankruptcy risks came in late October, after the Texas-registered company defaulted on its loan payments and causing its shares to fall nearly 80%.\n\nBy November the situation was critical once again, in fact it declared that it might run out of funds by the end of 2022.\n\nOn 21 December, Core Scientific, no less than one of the largest miners by computing power, filed for bankruptcy (Chapter 11), crushed by high energy costs and low Bitcoin (BTC) prices.\n\nIn short, BlackRock\u2019s connection to Bitcoin is increasingly solid; the future of Bitcoin is also in the hands of investment tycoons like Larry Fink and his firm."

        "content": "Crypto news: large hedge fund company Grayscale\u2019s leading indirect investment in BTC flies on the stock market but this reduces the discount on Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.\n\nGrayscale is grappling with some legal issues regarding some funds and loans, all solvable but the judiciary has its own timeframe and what\u2019s holding sway in the meantime is the market performance of its flagship financial instrument.\n\nFrom November to today despite some puzzlement the discount for the Bitcoin product has been at its lowest peak.\n\nShares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) flew to an incredible +12% Monday and significantly reduced the discount on Bitcoin.\n\nThe stock touched $9.65 and this caused the trust\u2019s discount to the NAV of BTC holdings to go to 38.55% recording the lowest differential in two months.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s instrument gives investors an opportunity to have one foot in Bitcoin without having to buy it directly.\n\nThe situation had not experienced this upward swing since early February last year, and the trend net of the legal events seems to be continuing.\n\nThe latest news on Grayscale Bitcoin Trust\n\nDigital Currency Group (DCG), the parent company of Grayscale, together with the trust, are the largest Bitcoin holders in the world after creator Satoshi Nakamoto and just above iconic giants such as Elon Musk, the amount is 643,572 units worth $11.1 billion according to the current value of the digital gold.\n\nMarket volatility and the technical inability of investors to get back liquidity drove up the discount but Grayscale attempted to change the product by turning it into a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to CEO Michael Sonnenshein, this would give more security to investors but the technical timeframe of the regulators was long and they eventually responded in spades.\n\nAlso in this regard last summer, Grayscale filed a complaint against the US Securities and Exchange Commission following yet another negative response for the company\u2019s submission of a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThose who own GBTC not being able to return capital as it is not provided by the instrument have pushed the company toward introducing a form of liquidity.\n\nIt is recent news that Fir Tree Capital Management, a Big Apple hedge fund is also in cahoots with Grayscale for \u201cpotential mismanagement and conflicts of interest\u201d while Valkyrie throws an assist to GBTC wanting to enter management by proposing that shareholders may vote to switch from Grayscale to Valkirie itself.\n\nIn the meantime, DCG upsets Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss, who turns to Barry Silbert and demands that he \u201cpublicly commit to working together\u201d to settle $900 million that Genesis subsidiary of DCG owes Gemini Earn.\n\nAmong the allegations he also reports that DCG is allegedly guilty of borrowing $1.7 billion from Genesis (parent to subsidiary), however, this was immediately denied via Twitter by Silbert."

        "content": "It\u2019s 14 years since the first Bitcoin (BTC) transaction was initiated, with its anonymous founder Satoshi Nakamoto acting as the sender.\n\nFor the transaction that occurred on January 12, 2009, Nakamoto transferred the 10 BTC to computer scientist Hal Finney, the first-ever recipient on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nCommenting on the transaction, Peter Smith, the CEO of Bitcoin blockchain explorer platform Blockchain.com noted it was a period of \u2018planting seeds.\u2019\n\n14 years ago today, the first P2P transaction occurred between Satoshi and Hal Finney for 10 BTC.\n\n\n\nHuge ideas take time, they were planting seeds 14 years ago for all of us today! pic.twitter.com/vCNTmht7ah \u2014 Peter Smith (@OneMorePeter) January 11, 2023\n\nFinney\u2019s prominence in the crypto space\n\nNotably, Finney has over the years gained prominence in the cryptocurrency space, as he was among the first people to embrace Bitcoin, even mining the asset. In this line, Finney is also among the few individuals who are known to have communicated with Satoshi.\n\n\u201cWhen Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test,\u201d he said in a previous post.\n\nFurthermore, Finney became famous for the first Bitcoin tweet ever in 2009 when he appeared to project the asset\u2019s potential.\n\nRunning bitcoin \u2014 halfin (@halfin) January 11, 2009\n\nBitcoin\u2019s growth\n\nSince the first transaction, Bitcoin has evolved over the years. For instance, in 2009, when the first transaction was initiated, the maiden cryptocurrency was mainly in an experimental stage.\n\nThe growth of the asset is also highlighted by a recent Finbold report that noted that the Bitcoin blockchain saw over $8 trillion in transactions in 2022 despite the bear market.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that the asset\u2019s growth has resulted in Bitcoin receiving different use cases, for example, DeFi on Bitcoin, to emerge as an investment asset and a payment option. Overall, Bitcoin is moving to emerge as a mainstream finance product.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin has emerged among the best-performing assets over the last decades despite undergoing phases of significant price correction.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price has taken a hit since it hit its all-time high back in 2021, and as a result, the number of bitcoin millionaires has dwindled dramatically since then. These addresses holding more than $1 million in BTC peaked in November 2021 and have been on a steady decline since then.\n\nBitcoin Millionaires Suffer Losses\n\nBack in November 2021, when the bitcoin bull market was in full bloom, the number of BTC millionaires had crossed 100,000 wallets. At its highest point, there were 108,886 wallets with more than $1 million worth of BTC in their balances, but according to data from BitInfoCharts, this number has dropped below 25,000.\n\nAt a current count of 24,533 millionaire wallets, more than 77% of bitcoin investors with the millionaire status have been wiped out in a little over a year. The majority of the losses came in the first half of 2022 and by June 2022, there were only a little over 26,000 BTC wallets with more than $1 million in their balances.\n\nWallets holding at least $10 million worth of BTC also took a hit during this time. It was sitting at only 3,852 at the time of this writing. However, smaller investors have been on the rise. According to a report from Glassnode, the number of BTC addresses holding higher than 0.1 and 1 BTC reached new all-time highs on Tuesday, January 10.\n\nThis marked accumulation from these smaller addresses shows that investors are not deterred by the decline in prices. But rather, are taking advantage of the low prices to increase their holdings.\n\nBTC price holding steady above $17,000 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nBTC Profitability Declines As Well\n\nThe drop in the number of bitcoin millionaires is also in line with the decline in the profitability of the digital asset. Bitcoin started the year 2022 with only about a quarter of its investor seeing losses, but by January 2023, it has dropped drastically, and now only 51% of BTC investors are in profit.\n\nIts large holder concentration has also dropped during this time. Only 10% of wallets are now classified as large holders, indicating a redistribution of BTC from whales to smaller holders. It also points to more decentralization with supply being more adequately distributed for market participants.\n\nAs for bitcoin\u2019s price, it is still trading well below its all-time high price despite its recent recovery above $17,000. Data from Messari shows that the price of the digital asset is currently down more than 74% from its November 2021 high.\n\nBTC is changing hands at $17,320 at the time of this writing. It is up 3.7% in the last week with a 24-hour trading volume of $16.2 billion."
