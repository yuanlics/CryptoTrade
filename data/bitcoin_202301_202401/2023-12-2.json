        "title": "Crypto execs say the bull run is underway and could lead to $100,000 bitcoin in 2024 - CNBC",
        "content": "In this article BTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nYuichiro Chino | Moment | Getty Images\n\nExecutives in the cryptocurrency industry called the start of a new bull run with a growing number of voices calling for fresh all-time highs for bitcoin in 2024 above $100,000. Bitcoin has rallied more than 120% this year, with many optimistic about the surge continuing into 2024. \"It feels that [2023]was a year to get ready for the bull run that is yet to come. But the sentiment is very hopeful for [2024] and 25,\" Pascal Gauthier, CEO of Ledger, told CNBC last week in an interview.\n\nThe digital currency's last record high of nearly $69,000 was hit in November 2021. Since then, the crypto industry has been hit with a litany of issues from the collapse of coins and projects to bankruptcies and criminal trials. FTX, once one of the world's biggest exchanges, collapsed with its founder Sam Bankman-Fried facing over 100 years in prison after he was found guilty on seven counts of criminal fraud. Meanwhile, Binance chief Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to criminal charges and stepped down as the company's CEO as part of a $4.3 billion settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice. Many in the industry see the two cases concluding as a line being drawn under issues that have plagued the crypto market. \"I think that once you get the speculative phase out of the way, which I think we're almost done with, probably not yet completely done, then you can get real builders focusing on the technology and the problems that can solve in the world, rather than just having a giant digital casino for people to trade,\" David Marcus, CEO of Lightspark, told CNBC last week in an interview. Marcus, the former leader of Facebook's failed Diem stablecoin project, is now working on technology to improve bitcoin as a payments network.\n\nwatch now\n\nNow that those issues are out the way, investors are focused on what the industry sees as positive developments. The first is the growing excitement that a bitcoin exchange-traded fund, or ETF, might be approved soon. This could bring in larger traditional investors who previously did not want to touch crypto. \"I think what the ETF means really is that bitcoin is going mainstream, and that's what people were waiting for,\" Gauthier said. The second development is the bitcoin halving, which takes place every four years and is scheduled for May 2024. Halving is when miners, which are entities who uphold the bitcoin network, see the rewards for their work cut in half. This keeps a cap on the supply of bitcoin \u2014 of which there will ever only be 21 million coins \u2014 and often is a factor behind a new rally. \"A number of market participants are expecting a bull run some time after the halving, but given the ETF news, we could very well have a run before that leaving most investors on the sidelines. That could cause a massive upward run in the price,\" Vijay Ayyar, vice president of international markets at cryptocurrency exchange CoinDCX, told CNBC.\n\nBitcoin at $100,000?\n\nThere have already been some bold calls for bitcoin in 2024. It began with Standard Chartered last week which reiterated an April price call that bitcoin would hit $100,000 by end of 2024. The bank said this will be driven by the approvals of numerous ETFs. That would mean a roughly 160% rally from Friday's price of around $38,413, according to CoinDesk data. Matrixport, which bills itself as a crypto financial services firm, released a note last week projecting bitcoin would reach $63,140 by April 2024 and $125,000 by the end of next year. \"Based on our inflation model, the macro environment is expected to remain a robust tailwind for crypto. Another decline in inflation is anticipated, prompting the Federal Reserve to likely initiate interest rate cuts,\" Matrixport said in its report. \"Combined with geopolitical crosscurrents, this healthy dose of monetary support should push Bitcoin to new highs in 2024.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nMany commentators see easing monetary policy as supportive for bitcoin which is viewed as a risky asset. Meanwhile, some see bitcoin as a sort of \"safe haven\" asset to pour money into in times of geopolitical strife. When asked if bitcoin would hit $100,000 in 2024, Gauthier said \"maybe,\" but declined to give a price prediction. \"What we see is strong fundamentals,\" he said. Ayyar said that the price of bitcoin is \"consolidating\" below a \"key level\" of $38,000, which is bullish for bitcoin. Once this level is broke, bitcoin could rally to between $45,000 and $48,000 next, he said. However, he warned the rally, which is in large part built on expectations of an ETF approval, could fail if the product is rejected by regulators again. \"An all out ETF rejection could play havoc to this run as well, hence definitely something to be mindful of,\" he said.\n\nwatch now"

        "title": "Franklin Templeton\u2019s Jenny Johnson on Bitcoin ETFs, investing in crypto, and how her firm is harnessing the blockchain - Fortune",
        "content": "At the Fortune Global Forum Nov. 27\u201329 in Abu Dhabi, I had a chance to talk with Jenny Johnson, the president and CEO of Franklin Templeton, which has grown from a small brokerage founded in 1947 to a global giant that now manages over $1.3 trillion.\n\nAmong the top financial firms, Franklin Templeton has been at the forefront of exploring blockchain technology. In 2021, it launched the first U.S.-registered mutual fund to use a public blockchain to process and record transactions, as well as crypto-focused separately managed accounts, or SMAs. And in September, the firm filed an application for a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nIn our conversation, Johnson discusses a variety of topics, including the role blockchain will play in her firm\u2019s long-term success and how it will help democratize markets.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nFranklin Templeton has been actively exploring blockchain technology, recently filing an application for its Franklin Bitcoin ETF. Could you elaborate a bit on how blockchain fits into your long-term strategy?\n\nI think it\u2019s important that we differentiate Bitcoin and blockchain. I think that there\u2019s a demand for Bitcoin. It has its own use case, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing these ETFs. What gets me more excited, as I think about the future, you look at blockchain technology, and it\u2019s going to enable access to things like private markets. It\u2019s going to enable the democratization of private markets. Well, why does it do that? This is because the technology takes out the frictional costs associated with processing transactions. And if you can reduce the friction in transactions, then you can more easily securitize or fractionalize ownership of things that would have been operationally too difficult to consider. Instead, you\u2019re able to create and transfer ownership of these hard-to-process assets much easier.\n\nIt\u2019s going to unlock nontraditional, non-correlated types of asset classes that are going to be interesting for our clients. We also think that it\u2019s going to make more efficient the types of products that you have today. ETFs trade all day, but only price twice a day. So, imagine that you build a pooled vehicle on the blockchain. When you transact, you can have the smart contract tell you exactly what the underlying value of those securities is. It\u2019s just a much more efficient way to be able to operate.\n\nAnd when you have atomic settlement or you have immediate settlement, it removes the potential for fraud, it takes out latency in the system. It\u2019s going to be all about efficiency. At Franklin Templeton, we developed a tokenized money-market fund. We built a shareholder recordkeeping system on that. We are a node validator, we actually advise on different portfolios. We have passive portfolios and active portfolios. While these are all in their early stages, they demonstrate that we\u2019re big believers in this space.\n\nWhen do you think the first Bitcoin spot ETF will be approved?\n\nI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s in the hands of the regulators, as they\u2019re trying to figure out the best approach. Their job is to protect the consumers, and I think they\u2019ll do it in time, as appropriate.\n\nHave you seen significant interest from clients for a Bitcoin spot ETF? Do you expect an influx of funds after it is approved?\n\nI think there\u2019s obviously a demand for Bitcoin, and I believe a spot ETF is a better way to access Bitcoin. As long as they trade, the bid-ask is narrow, it should be a better way to do it. It\u2019s a much more convenient way for anybody interested in investing in Bitcoin.\n\nBut I think Bitcoin has some challenges. It\u2019s hard to anchor to any kind of investment thesis. It tends to be a risk-on/risk-off type of asset. You just want to make sure clients are responsible in how they allocate Bitcoin.\n\nHow did you first discover blockchain and crypto?\n\nI ran the technology division years ago at Franklin Templeton. So I\u2019m always staying focused on new technological trends. This was one that I thought initially would take longer to mature, but I\u2019ve been impressed to see the various platforms and how quickly they\u2019ve matured, and the innovation that\u2019s happened in various companies that are being created on these layer-1s. But it was just because I spent about a third of my time on disruptive technologies, and it was one, just like AI, that I paid attention to.\n\nDo you personally invest in cryptocurrency?\n\nI do have some investments. It\u2019s small for my overall portfolio, but I definitely have investments there.\n\nCan you share some of your picks?\n\nWell, I haven\u2019t had more picks. They\u2019re all standard: Ethereum, a little Bitcoin, SushiSwap, Uniswap. I have a couple of different things like that.\n\nLooking ahead, do you plan to launch other blockchain- or crypto-related products? Some other wealth managers have, for example, crypto indexes or retirement plans or futures ETFs.\n\nETFs don\u2019t tend to be big in the retirement channel, but they may. Retirement plans have fiduciaries that make the decision about what investments are on there. So that would be the choice of the fiduciary. Our job is to make the products available.\n\nYou\u2019ve had big success with your U.S. money-market fund, which is tokenized and has inflows of over $ 270 million. Do you plan to tokenize any other funds?\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I think that technology is a really great opportunity. And as it matures, there\u2019ll be more investment opportunities. I always say, at Franklin Templeton, our expertise is in making active, risk-adjusted investment decisions, and we deliver them in whatever vehicle our clients would like us to deliver them. Blockchain creates one type of vehicle with tokenization, and so, yes, we do see it as a channel to ultimately be able to deliver our expertise.\n\nFranklin Templeton ventured into the world of NFTs by issuing some to attendees of your first Innovation Forum last year. What use cases do you see for NFTs, and how do you feel about them personally?\n\nLook, I think as in anything, there\u2019s mature investments that make a lot of sense. And then there\u2019s a lot that don\u2019t make any sense. I tend to make investments in things that I think are anchored in having financial returns, because I think that you have better chances of success there. There are some things that are like art in an NFT, where if two people love it, they will find a market price for it. And so, there\u2019s going to be opportunities in that space. Not all will be successful, not all will be good, but there will be some that are successful."

        "title": "One Bitcoin transaction uses as much water as filling a swimming pool - Earth.com",
        "content": "In a recent commentary, financial economist Alex de Vries has raised concerns about the significant amount of water consumed by cryptocurrency mining, particularly Bitcoin. This extensive water usage poses a threat to the global water supply, especially in water-scarce regions.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s water consumption\n\nDe Vries, a PhD student at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, highlights the burgeoning issue of Bitcoin\u2019s water footprint. \u201cMany parts of the world are experiencing droughts, and fresh water is becoming an increasing scarce resource,\u201d says de Vries (@Digiconomist). \u201cIf we continue to use this valuable resource for making useless computations, I think that reality is really painful.\u201d\n\nHistorically, the focus on cryptocurrency\u2019s environmental impact centered around its electricity consumption. Miners around the world actively compete to solve mathematical equations on the internet when mining Bitcoins, the most popular cryptocurrency. The winners receive a share of Bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\n\u201cThe right answer emerges every 10 minutes, and the rest of the data, quintillions of them, are computations that serve no further purpose and are therefore immediately discarded,\u201d de Vries says.\n\nIn the Bitcoin network, miners collectively generate about 350 quintillion guesses every second of the day, equating to 350 followed by 18 zeros. This process consumes a tremendous amount of computing power.\n\nQuantifying the impact\n\nDuring the mining process, large data centers use a significant amount of water to cool their computers. Alex de Vries, drawing on previous research data, estimates that Bitcoin mining in the U.S. consumes about 8.6 to 35.1 gigaliters (GL) of water annually from data centers.\n\nAdditionally, coal- and gas-fired power plants, which supply the electricity for these computers, also utilize water to cool down. This water, once used for cooling, evaporates and becomes unavailable for reuse. Similarly, water that evaporates from hydropower plants contributes to the overall water footprint of Bitcoin\u2019s power requirements.\n\nDe Vries estimates that Bitcoin mining used over 1,600 gigaliters (GL) of water globally in 2021. On average, each transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain consumes 16,000 liters of water, which is about 6.2 million times more than a credit card swipe, or sufficient to fill a backyard swimming pool. De Vries predicts that Bitcoin\u2019s water consumption will rise to 2,300 GL by 2023.\n\n\u201cThe price of Bitcoin just increased recently and reached its highest point of the year, despite the recent collapse of several cryptocurrency platforms. This will have serious consequences, because the higher the price, the higher the environmental impact,\u201d de Vries explains.\n\nThe environmental toll is exacerbated by the fact that these resources are not utilized for productive purposes like artificial intelligence but are instead expended on \u201cuseless computations.\u201d\n\nRegional implications\n\nCountries like Kazakhstan, a major hub for cryptocurrency mining, are already facing water shortages. In 2021, Bitcoin transactions in Kazakhstan accounted for 997.9 GL of water, adding to the country\u2019s water crisis.\n\nIn the U.S., the annual water consumption for Bitcoin mining, from all sources combined, ranges between 93 GL to 120 GL. This is equivalent to the water usage of 300,000 American households or a city like Washington, D.C.\n\nde Vries says. \u201cThe most painful thing about cryptocurrency mining is that it uses so much computational power and so much resources, but these resources are not going into creating some kind of model, like artificial intelligence, that you can then use for something else. It\u2019s just making useless computations.\u201d\n\nAddressing the challenge\n\nDe Vries suggests potential solutions, such as modifying Bitcoin mining\u2019s software to reduce power and water requirements. He also proposes incorporating renewable energy sources like wind and solar to lessen the water footprint. However, he cautions against diverting limited renewable resources to cryptocurrency mining at the expense of other essential uses.\n\n\u201cBut do you really want to spend wind and solar power for crypto? In many countries including the U.S., the amount of renewable energy is limited. Sure you can move some of these renewable energy sources to crypto, but that means something else will be powered with fossil fuels. I\u2019m not sure how much you gain,\u201d he says.\n\nWater, Bitcoin, and the future\n\nAs Bitcoin\u2019s value continues to grow, so does its environmental footprint. De Vries predicts that Bitcoin\u2019s water consumption will increase to 2,300 GL by 2023. This growing demand for water in the mining process could further exacerbate the global water crisis, especially in drought-prone areas.\n\nIn summary, the revelation of Bitcoin\u2019s significant water footprint by Alex de Vries serves as a wake-up call to the environmental implications of cryptocurrency mining. As the world grapples with water scarcity, the need for sustainable and responsible use of resources becomes more pressing.\n\nDe Vries\u2019s research underscores the importance of reassessing the environmental costs of emerging technologies like Bitcoin and seeking solutions that align with global sustainability goals.\n\nThe full study was published in the journal Cell Reports Sustainability.\n\n\u2014\n\nLike what you read?

        "title": "3 Cryptos to Buy Before the Bitcoin ETF Goes Live - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The recent spike in Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC-USD) price above $38,000 has brought a fresh wave of crypto investors into the market. With the long-awaited Bitcoin ETF potentially going live in 2024, renewed optimism avails for a bull run.\n\nHowever, it goes far beyond the ETF. Bitcoin has major catalysts approaching, like the mining reward halving projected for mid-2024. This event occurs every few years, cutting the rewards that miners receive by half and significantly impacting supply and demand dynamics over the long run. Considering mining rewards are the only new bitcoins entering circulation, halvings tend to precede major bull runs.\n\nAlso, macroeconomic factors align to Bitcoin\u2019s favor. Interest rates are still painfully high but will likely decline in 2024 or early 2025. Lower rates combined with the ETF and halving could create a perfect storm for crypto.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLess risky crypto projects for newcomers are important for long-term staying power. Let\u2019s delve into three bigger cryptos that could perform well in the next bull market, especially if a Bitcoin ETF gets approved soon.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD)\n\nBitcoin cryptocurrency with pile of coins, Vector illustrator\n\nSource: Sittipong Phokawattana / Shutterstock.com\n\nBitcoin is the obvious top pick for any crypto portfolio right now. Since it has several major catalysts lining up in 2023 and 2024, it could kickstart the next major bull run. As digital gold, BTC has a built-in scarcity and capped supply that no other crypto can match. Specifically, only 21 million BTC will be in existence.\n\nOf course, Bitcoin has downsides too. The network is rather slow and inefficient for payments compared to newer cryptos. Transactions can take over an hour to process, and fees are high due to congestion issues.\n\nWhen adding crypto exposure or balancing a portfolio with some uncorrelated assets, Bitcoin should be the first token of choice right now. Unless something catastrophic happens to destroy trust in crypto entirely, Bitcoin has likely seen its final bear market bottom around $15,000-$17,000.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the macro backdrop improving in 2024, a crashing of Bitcoin seems unlikely. As noted in June 2022, Bitcoin was not expected to break below $15,000, even in a worst-case scenario. Indeed, it bottomed around that level. Further, $25,000 might possibly be the new floor once the ETF goes live.\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD)\n\nEtereum coin is in pocket. Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. ETH crypto\n\nSource: Thaninee Chuensomchit / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough Ethereum (ETH-USD) differs from Bitcoin, it\u2019s been an exceptional long-term investment nonetheless.\n\nAs the second largest crypto by market cap, Ethereum dominates the smart contracts and Web 3.0 spaces. It allows decentralized apps and services to run on its network via the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). In contrast, Bitcoin\u2019s capabilities are quite limited to maximize security. It only supports peer-to-peer payments out of the box.\n\nAlready, ETH supply has turned deflationary post-Merge. More ETH is now removed from circulation via network burns than issued as staking rewards. Supply is decreasing by 1.75% annually, far below the Bitcoin inflation rate.\n\nOf course, Ethereum lacks Bitcoin\u2019s hard cap on supply, which some investors see as a drawback. So, while unlimited supply may seem concerning theoretically, network activity and burn dynamics act as a \u201csoft cap,\u201d keeping inflation below Bitcoin\u2019s. Also, an unlimited supply future-proofs Ethereum, ensuring that stakers still receive adequate future rewards, long after further supply decreases.\n\nFinally, Ethereum stands to gain from accelerating Web 3.0 and crypto adoption. While Bitcoin operates as a relatively simple payment network, Ethereum is an entire ecosystem for decentralized computing. Notably, Ethereum\u2019s correlation to Bitcoin remains high. ETH initially massively outperformed BTC but has lagged recently as the crypto focus returned to being a hedge against inflation.\n\nHowever, if Bitcoin sees another parabolic bull run in 2024-2025 off the halving, ETF approval, and macro backdrop, Ethereum is likely to benefit, too. Similar to the 2017-2018 bull market, while BTC may rise faster early, ETH can often overtake its gains in the later speculative frenzy stages.\n\nLitecoin (LTC-USD)\n\nImage of one litecoin in front of many stacks of litecoins. Litecoin price predictions\n\nSource: Wit Olszewski / Shutterstock.com\n\nLitecoin (LTC-USD) can be seen as a smaller sibling to Bitcoin with higher risk and higher reward potential. One of the oldest and most established crypto projects, Litecoin is essentially a faster Bitcoin fork with lower fees and a few tweaks. It operates similarly, capped at 84 million LTC instead of 21 million BTC. The vast majority of its code is identical.\n\nThus, Litecoin\u2019s correlation to Bitcoin price action tends to be very high. However, LTC generally amplifies BTC moves in both directions. When Bitcoin rises or crashes, Litecoin usually does so even more dramatically as happened in 2013, 2017, and the recent 2022-2023 crash. With its smaller $5.3 billion market cap, LTC remains more volatile and speculative than the blue chip-like BTC.\n\nSo, if Bitcoin indeed kicks off a new bull market in 2024, Litecoin seems poised to massively outperform it. Plus, it could be a safer, smaller-cap play than 99% of altcoins. Although the use case remains questionable, the correlation and historical precedent remain.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Bitcoin price could scrap $40,000 before a bigger dip, key levels to watch - FXStreet",
        "content": "Bitcoin price remains bullish, up almost 60% since mid-September, confirming the \u201cQ4 is the best month for BTC\u201d narrative.\n\nBTC could extend to tag the $40,000 psychological level before a bigger dip to give late and sidelined investors buy opportunity.\n\nWith strong downward support, GIOM shows there is one major area of interest between $42,556 to $67,413 threatening upside potential.\n\nInvalidation of the bullish thesis will occur the king of crypto breaks and closes below the $37,500 resistance level.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is trading with a bullish bias, riding on three themes. First, the fourth quarter has historically proven to be a good month for BTC. Secondly, there is strong anticipation for the approval of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with experts marking the calendar for between January 5 and 10. Third, the Bitcoin halving event slated for April 2024 remains something to look forward to.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price rally to $45,000 likely ahead of fourth BTC halving event\n\nBitcoin price could scrape $40,000\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is eyeing the $40,000 psychological level and could scrape it before a correction. Several bullish drivers, including the Relative Strength Index (RSI), bolster this outlook. For the RSI, this momentum indicator shows momentum is rising, with its position at 68 showing there is still more room to the north before the king of cryptocurrency can be considered overbought.\n\nFurther, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) is in the positive territory, with green histogram bars, suggesting the bulls are leading the market. Increased buying pressure, therefore, could see Bitcoin price extend from the current price of $39,462 (as of 8:00 AM GMT), and clear the $39,778 range high before scrapping the $40,000 psychological level.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn-chain metrics to support Bitcoin bullish outlook\n\nOn-chain aggregator IntoTheBlock\u2019s Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) metric shows there is no supply barrier that will prevent the largest crypto by market cap from achieving its upside potential. Based on this on-chain metric, there is only one major area of interest between $38,670 and $39,701 that is filled by a high number of investors that had previously purchased BTC around this price level. Here, roughly 860,540 addresses are holding nearly 324,370 BTC tokens.\n\nThe next crucial resistance extends from $42,556 to $67,413 where 5.64 million addresses or investors had previously purchased 2.11 million BTC tokens at an average price of $52,282.\n\nThe representation also shows that at current prices, 85.60% of BTC holders are sitting on unrealized profit (in the money) while only 12.74% are sitting on unrealized losses (out of the money). Meanwhile, a negligible 1.66% of token holders are breaking even (at the money).\n\nGIOM BTC\n\nAlso, the exchange inflows metric shows a declining trend, meaning the overall intention among token holders to sell BTC is reducing even as more continue to sit on unrealized profits. It points to a commitment to riding the uptrend, effectively giving Bitcoin price an abundance of buying pressure over seller momentum.\n\nBTC exchange inflows\n\nOn the flip side, if profit-taking begins, with traders cashing in for quick gains, Bitcoin price could move south, with key levels to watch, including $37,500, $35,000, $32,500, $31,529, and in the dire case, the $30,000 psychological level. Such a move would constitute a 25% drop from current levels."

        "content": "Top Stories This Week\n\nBitcoin ETF race gets 13th entrant, BlackRock revises ETF model\n\nAsset manager Pando Asset has become an unexpected late entrant into the spot Bitcoin ETF race in the United States. On Nov. 29, Pando submitted a Form S-1 \u2014 used to register securities with the agency \u2014 to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the Pando Asset Spot Bitcoin Trust. Like other ETF bids, the trust aims to track Bitcoin\u2019s price with the custody arm of the crypto exchange Coinbase to hold Bitcoin on behalf of the trust. Pando is the 13th applicant for an approved spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. and joins the race with a dozen others, including BlackRock, ARK Invest and Grayscale.\n\nBinance will end support for BUSD stablecoin in December\n\nCrypto exchange Binance is winding down the services for its native stablecoin, Binance USD (BUSD). According to an announcement, the exchange will cease support for all BUSD products following Paxos halting the minting of new coins. Binance said users should withdraw or convert their existing BUSD into other assets before Dec. 15, prior to it beginning the process of disabling withdrawals for BUSD on Dec. 31. At that point, existing balances will automatically be converted into First Digital USD for certain users.\n\nCME Bitcoin futures show investors betting on $40K BTC price\n\nThe demand of institutional investors for Bitcoin (BTC) became evident on Nov. 10 as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Bitcoin futures flipped Binance\u2019s BTC futures markets in terms of size. According to BTC derivatives metrics, those investors are showing strong confidence in Bitcoin\u2019s potential to break above the $40,000 mark in the short term. CME\u2019s current Bitcoin futures open interest stands at $4.35 billion, the highest since November 2021, when Bitcoin hit its all-time high of $69,000 \u2014 a clear indication of heightened interest. The impressive 125% surge in CME\u2019s BTC futures open interest from $1.93 billion in mid-October is undoubtedly tied to the anticipation of the approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s first year marked by existential fear, lawsuits and boardroom drama\n\nWith ChatGPT, OpenAI has developed the most popular artificial intelligence tool in the world. It was launched a year ago, on Nov. 30, 2022, and catapulted to 100 million monthly users within its first three months. In just 12 months, ChatGPT\u2019s existence has contributed to narratives surrounding the extinction of humankind, accusations that OpenAI built it by allegedly committing mass-scale copyright infringement, and a tumultuous CEO firing and rehiring that pundits are still trying to understand.\n\nFTX and Alameda Research cash out $10.8M to Binance, Coinbase, Wintermut\n\nWallets linked to defunct crypto trading firms FTX and Alameda Research moved $10.8 million to accounts in Binance, Coinbase and Wintermute using eight cryptocurrencies. Blockchain analysis firm Spot On Chain spotted the movement, estimating that the defunct entities have transferred $551 million since Oct. 24 using 59 different cryptocurrency tokens. The funds\u2019 movement dates back to March, when FTX and Alameda began the process of recovering assets for investors.\n\nWinners and Losers\n\nAt the end of the week, Bitcoin (BTC) is at $38,673, Ether (ETH) at $2,084 and XRP at $0.61.

Thanks to the United States potentially approving Bitcoin spot price ETFs, BTC/USD has the ability to almost treble from its current $37,700 over the coming 12 months.\n\n\u201cWe now expect more price upside to materialize before the halving than we previously did, specifically via the earlier-than-expected introduction of US spot ETFs,\u201d Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered\u2019s head of EM FX research, west and crypto research wrote. \u201cThis suggests a risk that the USD 100,000 level could be reached before end-2024.\u201d\n\nThe figure continues the consumer banking giant\u2019s already optimistic vision of how Bitcoin will grow in the coming years.

Around $316.4 million came from exploits alone, flash loans inflicted $45.5 million in damage, and $1.1 million was lost to various exit scams.\n\nBankless controversy forces founders to burn tokens and separate from DAO\n\nAmid the ongoing controversy around cryptocurrency media firm Bankless and the associated decentralized autonomous organization, BanklessDAO, the founders of Bankless have suggested separating the brand from the DAO. Bankless co-founders David Hoffman and Ryan Sean Adams plan to submit a governance proposal to BanklessDAO to separate the two entities. Hoffman and Adams\u2019 decision to separate Bankless from BanklessDAO came in response to community criticism of BanklessDAO\u2019s application for a grant from Arbitrum.\n\nKyberSwap hacker demands complete control over Kyber company\n\nThe hacker behind the $46-million KyberSwap exploit has finally released their conditions for the return of the stolen funds, which include \u201ccomplete executive control\u201d over the Kyber Network company. On Nov. 30, the KyberSwap hacker sent an on-chain message addressing all relevant and interested parties.

        "content": "Grayscale, a significant player in digital asset management, has expressed enthusiasm about the potential transformation of its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a Bitcoin ETF. This move could eliminate the current 8.09% discount of approximately $1.89 billion, aligning GBTC\u2019s price more closely with the actual value of Bitcoin, offering significant benefits for investors.\n\nThe company\u2019s chief legal officer, Craig Salm and chief financial officer, Edward McGee, revealed the details. Pending approval from the United States Securities Exchange Commission, GBTC is set to transition from its current platform, OTCQX, to the esteemed NYSE Arca exchange. This move seeks to better synchronize GBTC\u2019s shares with the real Bitcoin price and introduce a streamlined mechanism for investors to create or redeem shares effortlessly.\n\nETF analyst Eric Balchunas from Bloomberg observed the notable dependence on Regulation M (Reg M) relief. He references past conversations suggesting that the SEC might use Reg M to possibly impede or postpone specific procedures, although he refrains from affirming this. Balchunas notes the intriguing timing of Regulation M being mentioned immediately after Grayscale\u2019s meeting with the SEC, hinting at its potential significance or impact in their deliberations.\n\nRelated: SEC solicits comments on Fidelity\u2019s spot Ether ETF application\n\nWith Bitcoin (BTC) currently priced at $39,481 and a surge in trading volume indicating heightened trader interest, the prospect of a spot Bitcoin ETF ensures investors a more precise representation of Bitcoin\u2019s value through GBTC and establishes a safer avenue for institutional investors to engage with Bitcoin. This development has already led to a 3% increase in Bitcoin\u2019s value in the last 24 hours, accompanied by a remarkable surge in trading volume, signaling widespread interest.\n\nIn a Nov. 28 X (formerly Twitter) post, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said the SEC delayed its decision on the applications 34 days earlier than the Jan. 1, 2024, decision deadline. Seyffart and his colleague Eric Balchunas had placed 90% odds on spot Bitcoin ETF approvals by Jan. 10, 2024, and the twin delays \u201call but confirms for me that this was likely a move to line every applicant up for potential approval by the Jan 10, 2024 deadline,\u201d Seyffart said.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin ETF optimist and Worldcoin skeptic Gracy Chen: Hall of Flame"

        "content": "Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten has suggested that spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETF) will suppress the loud and flashy marketing strategies that have served as the initial gateway for many into the crypto space since 2017.\n\nDuring a recent interview with Bloomberg on December 1, Klippsten reiterated that Bitcoin ETFs offer an alternative entry into the market at a time when it has been tainted by well-funded crypto marketing schemes:\n\n\u201cThe past six years from 2017 through 2023, the top of the funnel for people looking to get into Bitcoin has been extremely noisy, polluted by all of the crypto marketing schemes funded by $50 billion of venture capital, trying to essentially market and dump crypto tokens.\u201d\n\nCory Klippsten speaking on Bloomberg Radio. Source: Bloomberg\n\nHe went on to clarify that an ETF functions similarly to an IOU for the product, differentiating it from a futures-based alternative. Essentially, it represents a paper form of Bitcoin, yet it requires the firm to back investors by purchasing actual Bitcoin.\n\n\"I think it's a great top of funnel for people to get into Bitcoin and then if they want to go a little deeper and explore it, and hold more,\" he stated.\n\nMoreover, aligning with the views of fellow crypto analysts who posit a \"clear runway\" for Bitcoin ETF approval in January, Klippsten expressed a similar optimism.\n\n\"That window seems to have been narrowed to January 8th, 9th, or 10th. It seems to be making a lot of sense given all the signals that we\u2019ve gotten out of the SEC and folks in the know,\" he stated.\n\nRelated: Swan Bitcoin to terminate customer accounts that use crypto-mixing services\n\nThis comes after a major bank recently declared that Bitcoin ETFs will drive Bitcoin\u2019s price up by 165% in 2024.\n\nOn November 30, banking giant Standard Chartered forecasted that Bitcoin should reach six figures by the end of 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, Geoff Kenrick, Standard Chartered\u2019s head of EM FX Research, West and Crypto Research mentioned that the recent shift in forecasts suggests the possibility of further price increases before April 2024:\n\n\u201cWe now expect more price upside to materialize before the halving than we previously did, specifically via the earlier-than-expected introduction of US spot ETFs.\u201d\n\nMagazine: This is your brain on crypto: Substance abuse grows among crypto traders"

        "content": "US Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, in a recent X post, expressed his strong views on Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), adding that it opens a clear path to social credit scoring.\n\n\u201cI have a one-word answer to central bank digital currencies: NO. Central bank digital currencies open a clear path to social credit scoring. No surprise that the CCP is leading the way,\" Ramaswamy said in his X post.\n\nFurthermore, he added his take on stabilizing the dollar. \u201cJanuary 2025, it would be kibosh in the Fed now programme. While we\u2019re at it, we\u2019re talking about a 90% headcount reduction of the US Fed Reserve. Peg the dollar to command gold, nickel and agricultural commodities. CBDC, we\u2019re done with it. Don\u2019t copy China. We\u2019re different for a reason,\" he added.\n\nThe presidential candidate has lately been vocal about his plans on stabilising the US Dollar by proposing linking the currency to a diversified basket of commodities, suggesting that Bitcoin might be included in this mix in the \"foreseeable future.\" Simultaneously, he expressed opposition to the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in the United States.\n\nRamaswamy expressed his intention to reposition the U.S. Federal Reserve, advocating for a substantial reduction of its workforce by 90%. His vision emphasizes a more streamlined mandate, with the primary focus on stabilizing the value of the dollar.\n\nHe noted that \u201cit could be reasonable\" to include Bitcoin in such a basket once the asset has been broadly accepted and its volatility is more in line with the larger basket of commodities.\n\nThe candidate subsequently articulated the perspective that the value of the dollar should be linked to tangible assets, potentially encompassing cryptocurrencies among them.\n\nIn a recent podcast, he said that the allure of the dollar as a global reserve currency is heightened when it avoids emulating China's digital yuan, which empowers the government to penalize dissenters.\n\nEmphasizing his commitment, he stated his intent to terminate the FedNow instant payments program, asserting that it is establishing the foundation for the eventual implementation of a central bank digital currency.\n\nMilestone Alert!

Their downfall caused havoc in crypto markets and sparked the bankruptcy of some high-profile companies in the crypto sector.\n\nBitcoin is still down from its record high of $69,000, scaled in November 2021. It has so far failed to make a breakthrough to mainstream commerce, long predicted by backers, and most large investors and companies remain wary of it as an investment.\n\nEther, the coin linked to the ethereum blockchain network, rose 2.07% to $2,210.70 on Sunday, adding $44.90 to its previous close."

        "content": "Bitcoin Hits $40,000 Level for the First Time Since May 2022\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The stock market had a rough Monday following several weeks of strength. It was a similar story in the bond market. And gold did a U-turn after climbing to a new record above $2,100 an ounce.\n\nYet in the digital-assets market, Bitcoin held firm following a weekend rally that took the oldest token above $42,000 for the first time in 19 months as frenzied speculation in cryptocurrencies extended its rally to more than 150% this year.\n\nWhile traders in traditional markets rethink aggressive pricing of potential Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts next year, Bitcoin-specific catalysts \u2014 first and foremost, prospects for the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s to approve exchange-traded funds that directly buy the token \u2014 have helped the biggest and oldest cryptocurrency break out of a trading range it had spent the previous three weeks.\n\nRead more: What Is Bitcoin \u2018Halving\u2019? Does It Push Up the Price?: QuickTake\n\n\u201cThe biggest driver behind the surge in Bitcoin price is likely the number of applications for spot BTC ETF which are expected to be approved by the SEC,\u201d Yiannis Giokas, a senior director with Moody\u2019s Analytics, said in an email. \u201cThe race is heating up to launch these vehicles with large asset managers getting ready to acquire the underlying asset.\u201d\n\nBitcoin rose as much as 6.1% to reach $42,144 earlier and was trading at $41,803 as of 4 p.m. on Monday in New York. The token was last at these levels in April 2022, before the TerraUSD stablecoin collapse that accelerated a $2 trillion rout in digital assets. It\u2019s on track for the biggest annual gain since 2020.\n\nSmaller tokens such as Ether and meme-crowd favorite Dogecoin also pushed higher. Bitcoin Cash jumped 9% and a gauge of the largest 100 crypto coins added more than 4%. Cryptocurrency-linked companies in the US were able to dodge an otherwise weak day in the stock market, with exchange operator Coinbase Global Inc. jumping 5.5%, miner Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. rising 8.6% and Bitcoin proxy MicroStrategy Inc. climbing 6.7%.\n\nThe crypto industry is awaiting the outcome of applications from the likes of BlackRock Inc. to start the first US spot Bitcoin ETFs. Bloomberg Intelligence expects a batch of these products to win Securities & Exchange Commission approval by January.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s revival from the 2022 crypto crash has weathered a US crackdown that put Sam Bankman-Fried behind bars for fraud at FTX and handed top crypto exchange Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao rap sheets and big fines.\n\nOptimists argue the push to curb dubious practices and the prospective ETFs signal a maturing crypto industry and the potential for a wider investor base.\n\nRecent enforcement actions \u201chave instilled confidence among investors,\u201d said Su Yen Chia, co-founder of the Asia Crypto Alliance.\n\nLingering Risks\n\nA reset in interest-rate bets or unexpected snarls for the ETFs could yet derail Bitcoin, while some technical indicators suggest the virtual currency\u2019s rally is stretched.\n\nFor instance, Bitcoin\u2019s weekly relative-strength index, a momentum gauge, closed above 75 for the past two weeks. Readings above 70 are viewed as signaling \u201coverbought\u201d conditions.\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin in the past decade rose an average 15% over the subsequent month after printing a weekly RSI of more than 75, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s jump in 2023 has outstripped assets such as global stocks and gold. In the derivatives market, open interest recently advanced to landmark levels at the CME Group for Bitcoin futures and at the Deribit platform for options on the most high-profile crypto coin.\n\nBitcoin Halving\n\nOne boost for sentiment is the so-called Bitcoin halving due next year, which will cut in half the amount of tokens that Bitcoin miners receive as reward for their work. The quadrennial event is part of the process of capping Bitcoin supply at 21 million tokens. The coin hit records after each of the last three halvings.\n\n\u201cWe could see Bitcoin run toward $50,000 before any major correction,\u201d said Cici Lu McCalman, founder of blockchain adviser Venn Link Partners. She cited the halving and the outlook for US monetary policy as among the reasons why.\n\nDespite the latest leg up, Bitcoin and the wider crypto market are still some way below the all-time highs achieved during the pandemic-era crypto bull run. The largest token peaked at almost $69,000 in November 2021.\n\n--With assistance from Anna Irrera.\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P."

        "content": "In anticipation of a potential bull market, investors often become engrossed in a narrative, sometimes overlooking the importance of considering alternative scenarios.\n\nThe 90% chance of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) approval in January, according to Bloomberg analysts, and the halving event have been major points of discussion within the crypto community. However, short-term pullback and a price correction of BTC are also possible scenarios to consider.\n\nBullish case\n\nBTC has \u201cleft behind depression and disbelief to enter the next stage: Hope,\u201d the second stage of the halving cycle according to renowned crypto investor CryptoCon.\n\n\u201cAfter a long period of despair, [BTC] price starts to show some signs of making a turnaround,\u201d he added on X.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s protocol reduces the reward for mining new blocks by half approximately every four years, an event known as \u201chalving.\u201d This reduction in new supply tends to create upward pressure on the price as the rate of new Bitcoin entering the market slows down.\n\nFollowing a halving, the reduced supply often leads to a bull market characterized by rising prices and increased investor interest.\n\nHalving Cycles Theory Sine Waves. Source: CryptoCon\n\nInvestors are currently in the \u2018Hope\u2019 phase of the cycle, according to the analyst. This means that people are starting to believe in Bitcoin again after long despair, and the price of Bitcoin has started to show signs of recovery, and it is now trading at fair value, he highlights. The next phase of the cycle is \u2018Belief\u2019.\n\nThis is when investors will start believing in Bitcoin, and the price will rise rapidly. This phase is expected to begin in June 2024 and last for about two years. The final phase of the cycle is \u2018Red Year\u2019, when the price of Bitcoin will reach its all-time high and then crash. This phase is expected to start in June 2026 and last for about one year, according to the expert.\n\nBearish case\n\nThe halving event has historically triggered a correction in Bitcoin\u2019s price before rallying, highlights a crypto analyst AlanSantana in a TradingView post. As the prices rise, the market can become overextended, leading to a bear market where prices fall and investor sentiment becomes negative.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart by AlanSantana. Source: TradingView\n\nThe expert also cautioned against the excessive hype surrounding the spot Bitcoin ETF, drawing parallels with past events like the Ethereum Merge.
