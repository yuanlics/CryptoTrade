        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The cryptocurrency fund manager Grayscale won a major court battle Tuesday against the Securities and Exchange Commission, paving the way for the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\n\nGrayscale sued the SEC last year when the securities regulator denied its application to turn its bitcoin fund, known as GBTC, into an ETF. The ETF would be backed by bitcoin instead of bitcoin futures, according to Grayscale\u2019s application at the time.\n\nThe SEC rejected the company\u2019s application over concerns about investor protections and other issues. However, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals sided with Grayscale, handing the SEC another setback in its attempt to regulate cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin jumped 8% Tuesday.\n\nETFs are a popular vehicle used to gain exposure to certain assets without directly investing in a commodity, or in a company\u2019s stock. ETFs track a desired index, sector or commodity, but they can be bought and sold like regular stocks.\n\nGrayscale had argued that a bitcoin ETF would be safer for investors because the bitcoin technology is not able to move as fast as stock-trading technologies.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic milestone for American investors, the bitcoin ecosystem, and all those who have been advocating for bitcoin exposure through the added protections of the ETF wrapper,\u201d said Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein, in a prepared statement.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s win will likely lead to other fund managers preparing their own bitcoin or cryptocurrency ETFs in time. Both Fidelity and BlackRock have expressed interest in producing such products in the past."

        "content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nThe value of crypto assets surged Tuesday after a US court cleared a path for the nation\u2019s first bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\n\nThe ruling is a breakthrough moment for crypto investors and a setback for the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has been trying to rein in the digital asset industry.\n\nThe three-judge panel for the DC Court of Appeals overruled an SEC decision denying Grayscale Invesments permission to launch a bitcoin-focused ETF. The panel said the regulator had failed to adequately explain why it rejected the firm\u2019s application.\n\n\u201cThe denial of Grayscale\u2019s proposal was arbitrary and capricious because the Commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar products,\u201d Judge Neomi Rao wrote.\n\nAn SEC spokesperson said Tuesday the agency was \u201creviewing the court\u2019s decision to determine next steps.\u201d\n\nMajor crypto tokens surged on the news. Bitcoin prices, which have been especially volatile in recent weeks, were up 7% to nearly $28,000. Coinbase (COIN), the largest publicly traded US crypto exchange, jumped 15%.\n\nThe bitcoin fund at the center of the case, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, or GBTC, was up 17%.\n\nGrayscale had argued that is proposal was materially similar to other bitcoin investment products that the SEC has already approved. The two other bitcoin products, from crypto firms Valkyrie and Teucrium, hold futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Grayscale had presented \u201cuncontested evidence\u201d that the underlying assets \u2014 bitcoin and bitcoin futures \u2014 were virtually identical, the judges wrote.\n\nThe ruling opens the door to an investment product that investors have been demanding for years.\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF would allow traditional investors to have exposure to the digital asset without actually owning it.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic milestone for American investors, the Bitcoin ecosystem, and all those who have been advocating for Bitcoin exposure through the added protections of the ETF wrapper,\u201d Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly exciting that we are one step closer to making a US spot Bitcoin ETF a reality.\u201d\n\nGrayscale is one of several firms that has applied for a spot bitcoin ETF. Earlier this year, BlackRock, Fidelity and Invesco, among others, sought permission to launch their own bitcoin funds.\n\nBitcoin is up some 65% this year, though remains far off its late-2021 high above $68,000."

Circuit has paved the way for bitcoin exchange-traded funds.\n\nOn Tuesday, the court sided with Grayscale in a lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission which had denied the company's application to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to an ETF. The decision could impact other companies that want to create bitcoin ETFs, like BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF would be traded through a traditional stock exchange, although the bitcoin would be held by a brokerage, and would allow investors to gain exposure to the world's biggest cryptocurrency without having to own the coin themselves. Many crypto bulls believe that approval of a spot bitcoin ETF will lead to more mainstream institutional adoption.\n\nBitcoin , ether and other major cap crypto coins surged on the news, and Coinbase , which is listed as the custodian partner in multiple spot bitcoin ETF applications, was up more than 14% on Tuesday.\n\n\"The Commission failed to adequately explain why it approved the listing of two bitcoin futures ETPs but not Grayscale's proposed bitcoin ETP,\" the court said, referring to exchange-traded products. \"In the absence of a coherent explanation, this unlike regulatory treatment of like products is unlawful.\"\n\nGrayscale Investments, which manages the world's biggest crypto fund, initiated its lawsuit against the SEC in June 2022 after the agency rejected its application to turn its flagship bitcoin fund, better known by its ticker GBTC, into an ETF. The company decided to pursue the ETF, which would be backed by bitcoin rather than bitcoin derivatives, after the SEC approved ProShares' futures-based bitcoin ETF in October 2021.\n\nThe ruling faced multiple delays but the SEC ultimately rejected the application last summer, citing failure by Grayscale to answer questions related to concerns about possible market manipulation and investor protections.\n\n\"We are reviewing the court's decision to determine next steps,\" the SEC said in a statement.\n\nA spokeswoman for Grayscale called Tuesday's ruling \"a monumental step forward for American investors, the Bitcoin ecosystem, and all those who have been advocating for Bitcoin exposure through the added protections of the ETF wrapper.\"\n\n\"The Grayscale team and our legal advisors are actively reviewing the details outlined in the Court's opinion and will be pursuing next steps with the SEC. We will share more information as soon as practicable,\" continued the written statement."

At the time of publication, the price was hovering just under $27,500.\n\nThe total market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies, of which Bitcoin represents almost half, rose approximately 5% to $1.1 trillion. Ether, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, also rose almost 5% once the verdict became public, now trading at just above $1,700.\n\nThe rising tide in the crypto market did not reflect a comparatively muted stock market, as the S&P 500 rose just 1% since markets opened on Tuesday, and the Nasdaq was up a bit more than 1%.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s sudden price jump follows a down month for the cryptocurrency after it most recently dropped below $26,000 amid an unusually placid summer.\n\nHowever, it adds to a year of gains following a disastrous 2022, when it tumbled from nearly $70,000 at the end of 2021 to just below $17,000 to start 2023. During the banking crisis in March, which most famously felled Silicon Valley Bank, Bitcoin surged to almost $28,000. In June the digital asset rocketed past $31,000, following the application of BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, for a Bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nNow, the decision in favor of Grayscale by the U.S. Court of Appeals for D.C. promises to add further fuel to the ETF fire, especially as the SEC stares down a number of deadlines to provide decisions on applications in the coming months."

Instead, the SEC will need to review Grayscale's application again and provide a clearer explanation in a situation where it is denied once more.\n\nThe launch of a spot bitcoin ETF has long been viewed as a potential boon for the bitcoin price, as some pension funds and other major financial players have strict guidelines to follow in terms of what they can do with their customers' funds.\n\nAdditionally, a spot bitcoin ETF could be seen as a regulatory and reputational stamp of approval for bitcoin, leading to greater acceptance of the crypto asset among mainstream financial institutions and investors.\n\nIn response to the court's opinion on the Grayscale bitcoin ETF lawsuit against the SEC, the bitcoin price rose more than 6%.\n\n"

        "content": "Investors who want to bet on Bitcoin may soon have more options to choose from. Major financial firms including BlackRock, Fidelity and Invesco have submitted applications to sell US \u201cspot\u201d exchange-traded funds tied directly to Bitcoin holdings, and Grayscale Investments LLC won an Aug. 29 court ruling in its push to turn its Bitcoin trust into an ETF. In the past, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has routinely rejected these products, citing wariness over volatility and potential manipulation. But the Grayscale ruling and the BlackRock filing, in particular, might show the cryptocurrencies industry gaining the upper hand.\n\n1. What do Bitcoin ETFs look like?\n\nETFs, a $7 trillion industry, are part of a broader family of products known as exchange-traded products, though people frequently use \u201cETFs\u201d to refer to all of them since they are by far the largest and most popular category. Crypto-native firms and major Wall Street financial institutions alike are trying to launch a kind of ETF that actually holds Bitcoin, as opposed to the products that invest in Bitcoin futures. Futures-backed Bitcoin ETFs have been available to US customers since 2021, but the SEC hasn\u2019t approved any applications for so-called spot Bitcoin ETFs. Issuers and investors are advocating for spot Bitcoin ETFs to be similarly accessible to retail and institutional investors in the US, a development that\u2019s perceived as having the potential to greatly broaden participation in the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. What\u2019s the difference between Bitcoin futures and spot Bitcoin?\n\nFutures are contracts to buy or sell an asset at a specified price at a later date. They are widely used in many markets, like oil, by investors who want to speculate on price movements without having to own or take possession of the underlying asset directly. As the price of Bitcoin swings up or down according to direct trading, Bitcoin futures track the cryptocurrency\u2019s spot price indirectly on exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In the spot Bitcoin market, by contrast, users buy and sell the actual digital currency via exchanges.\n\n3. What\u2019s been available before now?\n\nThe ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF became the first Bitcoin futures ETF available in the US, opening on Oct. 19, 2021, to strong demand. The Purpose Bitcoin ETF (ticker BTCC), which made its debut in Toronto in early 2021, invests directly in \u201cphysical/digital Bitcoin,\u201d its issuer, Purpose Investments Inc., said. Meanwhile, several US investment trusts have been following Bitcoin in a manner that\u2019s similar to ETFs but with certain restrictions. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (ticker GBTC) is physically backed, meaning that it holds Bitcoin. Grayscale sued the SEC over its attempt to turn GBTC into an ETF; that\u2019s the case in which Grayscale won a key legal fight in August.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Where do things stand?\n\nShare this article Share\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest asset manager, BlackRock Inc., filed an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF in June, kicking into high gear speculation that the long-illusive investment product would finally get SEC approval. BlackRock\u2019s application, in turn, led to a major crypto market rally and a flurry of similar ETF applications and resubmissions from issuers including Fidelity Investments and WisdomTree Inc. Grayscale has been making the argument that a conversion would help it unlock billions of dollars in value for investors of GBTC. The SEC could fight the August court ruling by asking a full slate of judges on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals or the US Supreme Court to review it.\n\n5. Why did regulators shun a Bitcoin ETF for so long?\n\nIn addition to their worries about liquidity and manipulation, regulators have expressed concern that Bitcoin\u2019s volatility might be too intense for ordinary investors \u2014 Bitcoin\u2019s last three full-year returns were gains of 305% in 2020, up another 60% in 2021, followed by a loss of 64% in 2022. The SEC has also questioned whether funds would have the information necessary to adequately value tokens like Bitcoin, including whether they can validate who owns the underlying coins. In 2021, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler testified to the Senate Banking Committee that the lack of regulatory oversight and surveillance in crypto markets led to \u201cconcerns about the potential for fraud and manipulation.\u201d In an attempt to allay some of the SEC\u2019s concerns, BlackRock and other issuers following in its footsteps have proposed so-called surveillance-sharing agreements, a way to mitigate the risk of market manipulation and fraud. Coinbase Inc., the only publicly traded, pure-play spot-crypto exchange in the US, has emerged as ETF issuers\u2019 market surveillance partner of choice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. What might the SEC\u2019s process look like?\n\nSome experts are expecting an ultimate approval of at least one spot Bitcoin ETF by the end of the year, while others advise caution, as the battlefield is already littered with corpses of around 30 prior attempts that failed to persuade the SEC to give them a chance. Analysts will now also be closely watching any potential developments in Grayscale\u2019s conversion process.\n\n--With assistance from Claire Ballentine.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com"

My one quibble with Approach 2 is that you really do have to keep the Bitcoins somewhere safe, and there is a long, long, long history of people in crypto finding exciting new ways to lose their cryptocurrency, but I think that in 2023 \u201cbuy Bitcoins and don\u2019t lose them\u201d is the sort of thing that you can expect a regulated financial institution to manage."

It's now off the March high of 3.5 million BTC by about 94%.\n\nAn analysis of CryptoQuant data from both spot and derivatives exchanges shows the total volume of bitcoin held on all exchanges fell earlier this month to its lowest level since 2018 and has struggled to rebound.\n\nBitcoin's trading volume hit its lowest level in almost five years this month as investors keep waiting for reasons to jump back into the market.\n\n\"Trading volumes decrease in bear markets as retail investors leave,\" Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, told CNBC. \"This happened during 2022 on most exchanges. As we progress further into a bull market, the trading volume may continue to pick up.\"\n\nThe price of bitcoin is still up 57% for the year and hovering at about $26,100, according to Coin Metrics.\n\nIt's been an excruciatingly quiet summer for bitcoin traders, but seasonality only accounts for so much of it. The U.S. regulatory crackdown on crypto combined with the end of the banking crisis in May (which accounted for much of its year-to-date gains) drove market makers and traders away \u2013 and they haven't had a reason to return.\n\nEven after bitcoin's violent sell-off on Aug. 17 \u2014 the biggest one-day sell-off since the height of the FTX fallout in November \u2014 the market quickly became quiet again.

The next one is expected to take place in spring of 2024. Cantor Fitzgerald echoed that emphasis on the long game.\n\n\"Although near-term catalysts may take many forms, we continue to believe in the long-term story of ongoing crypto adoption and bitcoin's staying power as an alternative asset and store of value,\" Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Josh Siegler said in a note Monday.\n\n\u2014CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.\n\nCorrection: On Aug. 12, bitcoin trading volume fell to 112,317 BTC, its lowest level since Nov. 10, 2018.

        "title": "Bitcoin rallies more than 7% as court sides with Grayscale over the SEC in crypto ETF case - CNBC",
        "content": "Bitcoin jumped 7.15% following the ruling to $27,851.82, according to Coin Metrics. The move lifted cryptocurrencies broadly as well as crypto equities higher.\n\nThe price of bitcoin surged Tuesday after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit ruled that the Securities and Exchange Commission was wrong to deny crypto investment giant Grayscale permission to convert its popular bitcoin trust into an ETF.\n\nGrayscale's lawsuit against the SEC has been closely watched by investors and other industry participants as a key catalyst that would shake up a market marred by low volatility and liquidity. Earlier this month, bitcoin trading volatility fell to its lowest level in more than four years as investors had been waiting on the sidelines for more regulatory clarity on crypto activity \u2013 whether through new legislation out of Congress or through the ability to launch a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nSeveral bitcoin futures ETFs have already been approved in the U.S.\n\n\"The denial of Grayscale's proposal was arbitrary and capricious ... The Commission failed to adequately explain why it approved the listing of two bitcoin futures ETPs but not Grayscale's proposed bitcoin ETP,\" the court said in the ruling. \"In the absence of a coherent explanation, this unlike regulatory treatment of like products is unlawful. We therefore grant Grayscale's petition for review and vacate the Commission's order.\"\n\nTuesday's ruling may increase the chances that the SEC will approve other bitcoin ETF applications \u2013 including that of BlackRock , whose filing in late June drove one of bitcoin's big rallies this year, as well as Fidelity , WisdomTree, VanEck and Invesco and others. A U.S. bitcoin ETF would provide a way to get exposure to bitcoin without having to hold it, which would invite retail and institutional investors as well as wealth managers into the market.\n\nA spokesperson for the SEC said it's \"reviewing the court's decision to determine next steps.\"\n\n\"Today's decision reaffirms that a bitcoin ETF in the U.S. is a matter of when, not if,\" said Steve Kurz, global head of asset management at Galaxy, which filed with Invesco for its bitcoin ETF. \"In order for digital assets to continue to flourish, they must be accessible to all investors. We believe that the ETF structure can enable greater access to and transparency across cryptocurrency investing, and truly help further democratize the asset class.\"\n\nThe ruling also comes as a relief to many crypto market participants who have been frustrated by the SEC, particularly under Chair Gary Gensler, and its insistence on regulating by enforcement. The crypto industry has long sought out clarity in rules businesses can play by to establish and build long-lasting, compliant companies. The U.S. regulatory crackdown on crypto in 2023 \u2014 which includes SEC enforcements and a lawsuit against the biggest U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase \u2014 has been a dark cloud over the market.\n\nGrayscale initiated its lawsuit against the SEC in June 2022 after the agency rejected its application to turn its bitcoin trust, better known by its ticker GBTC, into an ETF. The company decided to pursue the ETF, which would be backed by bitcoin rather than bitcoin derivatives, after the SEC approved ProShares' futures-based bitcoin ETF in October 2021.\n\nThe ruling faced multiple delays but the SEC ultimately rejected the application last summer, citing failure by Grayscale to answer questions related to concerns about market manipulation and investor protections.\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust itself jumped 16.95%.\n\n\u2014CNBC's Jesse Pound contributed reporting."

        "title": "A spot bitcoin ETF is much closer to reality, but investors aren't quite there yet - CNBC",
        "content": "The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., US, on Wednesday, Aug. 9, 2022.\n\nWell, now the SEC is in a real pickle.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit sided with Grayscale in a lawsuit against the SEC, greatly improving the chances that a bitcoin exchange traded fund will be approved. The SEC had earlier denied Grayscale's application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to an ETF.\n\nThe problem for the SEC is that the court has squarely rejected the very basis on which the SEC has been denying a spot bitcoin ETF for the past several years.\n\nThe SEC has said it can't approve a spot bitcoin ETF because there isn't a regulated crypto market of sufficient size to prevent manipulation.\n\nBut the court called out the SEC over its prior approval of a futures-based bitcoin product. The court said, in essence, Hey, you approved a futures-based bitcoin product. The futures and the spot market are \"like\" products. If you approve one, you have to approve the other.\n\n\"Because the spot and futures markets for bitcoin are highly related, it stands to reason that manipulation in either market will affect the price of bitcoin futures,\" the court said.\n\n\"The denial of Grayscale's proposal was arbitrary and capricious because the Commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar products,\" the appeals court said.\n\nThe tragedy of this ruling is that it does nothing to alleviate the concern over possible manipulation, which has not gone away. The court simply said that the SEC has erred in approving one ETF (bitcoin futures) and not approving another (spot bitcoin).\n\nWhere to from here\n\nWhat's next? A lot depends on whether SEC Chair Gary Gensler wants to fold or fight to the end.\n\nThe SEC has several choices to make.\n\nThe first is whether it wants to appeal the case, in which case the order would be stayed until there is a decision on the appeal. The regulator has 45 days to make that decision. An appeal is possible, but the harsh tone of the judicial ruling certainly makes it more difficult for the SEC to appeal.\n\nDepending on the decision to appeal, there are several choices after that.\n\n1) Approve all or some of the nine applications for a spot bitcoin ETF as soon as possible. The SEC could go along with the court ruling and issue an order allowing the exchange on which the Grayscale ETF would list (NYSE Arca) to go ahead and list the Grayscale fund, or approve other funds that have applied.\n\nApplicants for a spot bitcoin ETF\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust\n\nArk/21 Shares Bitcoin Trust\n\nBitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust\n\nBlackRock Bitcoin ETF Trust\n\nVanEck Bitcoin Trust\n\nWisdomTree Bitcoin Trust\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Fund\n\nInvesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF\n\nFidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust\n\n2) Delay as long as the law allows. The first of the applicants to file was Ark, which published in the Federal Register on May 15. The SEC has a maximum time of 240 days to approve or deny those applications, meaning the first deadline would be January 10, 2024.\n\n3) Come up with a new rationale why the application should not be approved and dare Grayscale to sue again. The SEC can no longer use the argument that there is not a market of sufficient size to prevent manipulation, but it could come up with other arguments.\n\nLike what? That's not clear.\n\nThere's one final possibility: the SEC could just kill the bitcoin futures ETF. That is theoretically possible, but unlikely, considering the SEC recently approved (leveraged) bitcoin futures.\n\nWho's first in line?\n\nEven assuming a spot bitcoin ETF is coming, it doesn't mean Grayscale can necessarily jump the line. It's possible the SEC will approve ARK first, or all of them at the same time.\n\nI wonder if the SEC is regretting that decision to approve bitcoin futures.\n\nNote: Matt Hougan Chief Investment, Officer for Bitwise Asset Management, one of the applicants for a spot bitcoin ETF, will appear on ETF Edge on Halftime Report Wednesday. For ETF Edge at 2:00 PM ET, Hougan will be joined by Craig Salm, Grayscale's chief legal officer, and Jeremy I. Senderowicz, an attorney with VedderPrice who has been representing ETFs for close to 20 years."

        "title": "Crypto vs SEC: What Grayscale's court victory means for bitcoin ETFs - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nProponents of digital assets were crowing on Tuesday after cryptocurrency asset manager Grayscale scored a resounding legal victory in its efforts to offer a spot bitcoin exchange traded fund, and the price of bitcoin subsequently shot up 7 per cent to nearly $28,000.\n\nBut that does not mean investors will be able to run out and buy a Grayscale spot ETF tomorrow. Nor does it immediately doom efforts by the US Securities and Exchange Commission to bring enforcement actions against some of the industry\u2019s biggest players, including crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance. The story of the watchdog\u2019s efforts to tame what it sees as a financial wild west still has some way to run.\n\nWhat did the court rule?\n\nA federal appeals court ruled that the SEC was wrong to reject Grayscale\u2019s application to convert its flagship Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which the SEC approved in 2015, and which holds more than $15bn in bitcoin, into an ETF. The SEC has allowed bitcoin futures ETFs since October 2021 but contended that spot funds were prone to manipulation, since crypto tokens trade on largely unregulated markets.\n\nJudge Neomi Rao wrote in the decision that the SEC\u2019s denial was \u201carbitrary and capricious because the commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar products\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is a monumental step forward for American investors, the bitcoin ecosystem, and all those who have been advocating for bitcoin exposure through the added protections of the ETF wrapper,\u201d Grayscale said in a statement.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe SEC has 45 days to decide whether to abide by the decision, ask the full federal appeals court in Washington to review it, or take an appeal straight to the Supreme Court. It said on Tuesday that it was reviewing the decision.\n\nLawyers said Grayscale would have to file a new application for its ETF. But there is no guarantee that it will be approved, despite the court\u2019s decision \u2014 the SEC could reject it on other grounds.\n\nIndeed, investors still seem to think that the Grayscale trust\u2019s conversion could get gummed up. One reason Grayscale has long sought to convert its trust into an ETF is that trusts, unlike ETFs, often trade at a discount to their holdings. Even after Tuesday\u2019s ruling, the Grayscale trust was still trading at a 20 per cent discount, a sign that investors are wary that a conversion will happen soon.\n\nFinancial reform group Better Markets suggested that the agency could address the court\u2019s concerns another way \u2014 by cancelling bitcoin futures ETFs rather than approving new spot products. The ruling \u201cdoes not change the fact that the bitcoin market is subject to fraud and manipulation or that an ETF would be a serious threat to investors\u201d, said Dennis Kelleher, its chief executive.\n\nWhat does this mean for other bitcoin ETFs?\n\nThe first European spot bitcoin ETF started trading earlier this month. In the US, there are more than a dozen other applications pending, including some from the largest US asset managers. All of them would face similar questions about preventing market manipulation and how to price the asset at the end of the trading day, lawyers said.\n\nEven though Grayscale had successfully challenged the SEC\u2019s decision, there was no legal guarantee that it would jump to the front of the queue for review, said Teresa Goody Guill\u00e9n, a partner at BakerHostetler.\n\nThe most closely watched ETF proposal is from BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager. It first filed in June 15, and the SEC officially added the BlackRock application to its docket on July 13, followed by similar proposals from Invesco, VanEck and WisdomTree. All of them are coming up for preliminary deadlines this week.\n\nSEC watchers said the commission would most likely impose a 45-day delay that puts the decisions off until mid-October. \u201cI think there\u2019s a pretty reasonable chance that multiple products get approved at once,\u201d said Jeremy Senderowicz, of law firm Vedder Price.\n\nWhat does the ruling mean for efforts to regulate crypto and digital assets?\n\nDigital asset groups were ecstatic about Grayscale\u2019s win. Coinbase\u2019s chief legal officer Paul Grewal called it \u201ca great moment for the industry . . . while we still believe comprehensive federal crypto legislation is the best way forward, decisions like this are an important step toward the clarity the industry needs\u201d.\n\nGuill\u00e9n described the Grayscale decision as a \u201chefty blow to the SEC\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis confirms that the SEC\u2019s approach to crypto has opened it up to legal challenges \u2014 whether as arbitrary and capricious, outside its statutory authority, improper rulemaking, et cetera,\u201d she said. \u201cIt certainly confirms that the courts are holding the SEC accountable to its legal obligations, including the SEC\u2019s approach to crypto.\u201d\n\nThe decision could give impetus to those who want to give more power over the sector to another regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees derivatives.\n\n\u201cThis is a real loss of face for the SEC because of the language the appeals court used to chastise them,\u201d said Lewis Cohen, of DLXLaw.\n\nWhat happens to the SEC\u2019s enforcement cases against crypto groups such as Coinbase and Binance?\n\nThe Grayscale decision was focused on the SEC\u2019s administrative procedures rather than its legal authority to regulate and enforce. So the case has no direct impact on the watchdog\u2019s lawsuits accusing exchanges Coinbase and Binance of violating securities laws.\n\nThose cases were partly called into question by an earlier lower court decision in an SEC enforcement case that involved the Ripple token, when a judge found the company did not violate securities law when its tokens were bought by members of the public on secondary markets. The SEC is appealing against the ruling, but if that decision stands, its effort to regulate digital assets as securities would be weakened.\n\nWhile legally distinct, the Grayscale decision can be used to further claims that the SEC has been misreading current law, said attorneys for the industry.\n\n\u201cThe crypto industry is pointing to this as another example of SEC over-reach . . . it lets them spin it as an agency out of control,\u201d said Lee Reiners, who teaches a course on crypto law at Duke University.\n\nAdditional reporting by Stephen Gandel in New York"

The regulator has cases pending against Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange Coinbase as well as Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world.\n\nThe price of bitcoin shot up roughly 6 per cent on Tuesday after the ruling. It is up 65 per cent year to date. Shares of Coinbase were up more than 13 per cent.\n\nThe Grayscale lawsuit focused narrowly on the question of whether the money managers could offer a spot bitcoin ETF that would expose retail investors to the real-time price of bitcoin. While the SEC has previously given the green light to ETFs based on bitcoin futures, the regulator has argued that bitcoin trades on unregulated exchanges and can be prone to market manipulation.\n\n\u201cThe denial of Grayscale\u2019s proposal was arbitrary and capricious because the Commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar products,\u201d Judge Neomi Rao wrote for a three-judge panel on the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals, which vacated the SEC\u2019s decision to block the spot ETF.\n\nThe SEC said it was reviewing the court\u2019s decision. The regulator could appeal to the full federal appeals court or the Supreme Court, but it is not clear whether it will chose to do so.\n\nDespite the SEC\u2019s tough stance on the industry, demand for a spot bitcoin ETF has grown, and more traditional players have attempted to break into the sector. The SEC is considering a half-dozen other proposals to launch spot bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock, WisdomTree and Fidelity, among others.\n\n\u201cBased on the court decision, this is a close to fatal blow for the SEC\u2019s decision that it cannot allow these products to launch,\u201d said Jeremy Senderowicz of law firm Vedder Price. \u201cIf this decision stands, then it rejects the SEC\u2019s central basis for rejecting every spot bitcoin ETF for the last several years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a monumental step forward for American investors, the bitcoin ecosystem, and all those who have been advocating for bitcoin exposure through the added protections of the ETF wrapper,\u201d Grayscale spokesperson Jennifer Rosenthal said."

But the next steps are cloudy, as the SEC could appeal the decision \u2014 and even if it doesn\u2019t, it could still reject the Grayscale application.\n\nAlthough the regulator has approved bitcoin futures products, it has pointed to potential manipulation and a lack of investor protection as problems for spot crypto ETFs. Grayscale had filed to convert its Bitcoin Trust to an ETF.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic milestone for American investors, the bitcoin ecosystem and all those who have been advocating for bitcoin exposure through the added protections of the ETF wrapper,\u201d Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said in an announcement. \u201cGrayscale has adhered to U.S. financial rules and regulations in building our product suite since our founding in 2013, underpinned by one fundamental belief: investors deserve transparent, regulated access to crypto. It\u2019s incredibly exciting that we are one step closer to making a U.S. spot bitcoin ETF a reality.\u201d\n\nNumerous firms have filed applications this year with the SEC for spot bitcoin products, including massive asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\n\u201cThis is really big news \u2014 not just for Grayscale, but for the other issuers who have filed for spot bitcoin ETFs over the past few months,\u201d said Roxanna Islam, associate director of research at VettaFi. \u201cThe most important thing to remember \u2026 is that this does not mean that the SEC is automatically approving a spot bitcoin product. What it does is open up a path to it.\u201d\n\nEven if the SEC does green-light a spot bitcoin ETF, Grayscale\u2019s might not be the first, as other firms filed earlier and are essentially in the front of the approval line, Islam said.\n\nEven so, \u201cGrayscale has a step up among the other issuers, just because they have a trust product out there that already has assets in it, and they\u2019ve been a huge name in this legal battle,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a statement, an SEC spokesperson said the regulator is reviewing the court\u2019s decision before deciding its next steps.\n\nThe Crypto Council for Innovation characterized the ruling as a step forward for all cryptocurrency products and providers.\n\n\u201cThis is big, positive, and precedent setting news,\u201d Ji Kim, the council\u2019s head of global policy, said in a statement. \u201cIt provides the obvious reminder that it is critical for regulators to provide much needed clarity and rationale when making such critical determinations affecting such a significant industry. The door is now open for a range of investors, including those who have historically been apprehensive due to a lack of regulatory clarity.\u201d\n\nADVISOR PERSPECTIVES\n\n\u201cRetail investors have been waiting for a bitcoin spot ETF for quite some time now, although the discussion/excitement has certainly died down during the sell-off over the last 21-plus months,\u201d Vaughn Kellerman, associate wealth advisor at HCM Wealth Advisors, said in an email.\n\nThe availability of a spot bitcoin ETF would provide an alternative to buying the cryptocurrency on an exchange \u2014 which, given the recent problems with FTX and others, has discouraged people, Kellerman said. And an ETF would also allow investors to get exposure to the cryptocurrency in individual retirement accounts, he noted.\n\n\u201cWhile I believe buying and storing bitcoin on your own hardware wallet is the best choice, there is a need for a spot Bitcoin ETF for the asset to take the next major jump forward regarding larger overall adoption both from the retail investors and institutional investors,\u201d he said.\n\nNot everyone feels that way.\n\n\u201cThe [Sam Bankman-Fried] case and the trial of a former president will prove to the investing public that crypto is a pyramid scheme, so my recommendation to anyone that asks is to stay away,\u201d Michael Hansen, managing partner of Frontier Wealth Strategies, said in an email. \u201cIf you have an appetite for risky investments, find a PE deal for a tech startup, because now is a great time for doing so.\u201d"

Still, the platform had its first profitable quarter ever, and its retirement offerings continued to gain traction.\n\nTransaction-based revenues, notably, declined 7% on a quarterly basis to $193 million, with cryptocurrencies, options, and equities seeing declines of 18%, 5%, and 7%, respectively.\n\nBitcoin got a boost on Tuesday from news that a judge sided with asset manager Grayscale in its suit against the Securities and Exchange Commission over converting its bitcoin trust into an ETF. The cryptocurrency popped 5% immediately after the news as traders upped bets that the ruling could also pave the way for the SEC to approve numerous applications for spot bitcoin ETFs, which experts say would be a boon for the token's price.\n\nSome strategists see bitcoin soaring six-figures over the next year thanks to the April 2024 halving process, which will cut crypto miners' reward in half to create a scarcity effect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Taking a conservative view, if bitcoin stays around $30K until the halving, even a 12-month post-halving increase of 250% \u2014 which, again, is conservative relative to previous halvings \u2014 would price bitcoin at $105K,\" Joe Kelly, the CEO of financial firm Unchained, wrote in a recent note.\n\nCoinShares data shared with Insider on Tuesday showed that last week saw the largest outflows from digital assets since March, with bitcoin seeing the biggest outflows totalling $149 million."

The SEC ruling has been vacated.\n\nLast year, Grayscale applied for the approval for the fund and was denied.

That could let large investors, such as pension funds, invest in Bitcoin.\n\nThe SEC has previously approved ETFs that track Bitcoin futures, but not so-called spot ETFs, which directly track Bitcoin price. Grayscale wanted to convert its Bitcoin trust to an ETF, which would let investors trade shares more freely than the closed-end trust currently allows. Because it\u2019s difficult for investors to trade their shares, Grayscale\u2019s trust often trades below the actual price of the Bitcoin it represents. The switch to an ETF would make it easier to create and destroy shares, so that discount would vanish."

        "content": "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued its opinion in Grayscale v. SEC on Tuesday, ruling that the agency was unreasonable to deny the crypto giant permission to launch a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe ruling, which comes after the Securities and Exchange Commission rejected Grayscale\u2019s latest bid to launch a Bitcoin ETF in October, opens the door to a potentially huge amount of new capital flowing into crypto markets.\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling turned on the SEC\u2019s inconsistent handling of applications for Bitcoin futures ETFs, which it had approved, and for regular ETPs, or exchange-traded products, which Grayscale had sought.\n\n\u201cThe Commission failed to reasonably explain why it approved the listing of two bitcoin futures ETPs but not Grayscale\u2019s similar proposed bitcoin ETP. Without such an explanation, inconsistent treatment of similar products is arbitrary and capricious,\u201d wrote Judge Neomi Rao.\n\nThe SEC did not immediately comment on the ruling or say whether it would appeal.\n\nBitcoin immediately soared after the ruling, climbing over 5% in just minutes, as did the price of several other major cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.\n\nThe ruling has big implications for crypto markets. While retail consumers and hedge funds have invested in Bitcoin for more than a decade, pension funds and other big players have largely stayed on the sidelines. This is in part because corporate bylaws restrict what they may invest in on behalf of their clients. The introduction of a Bitcoin packaged in the familiar financial wrapper of an ETF is widely expected to wipe away such legal and reputational concerns and lead to a massive liquidity boost.\n\n\u201cThis is a monumental step forward for American investors, the Bitcoin ecosystem, and all those who have been advocating for Bitcoin exposure through the added protections of the ETF wrapper,\u201d Grayscale said in a statement.\n\nGrayscale isn\u2019t the only firm that stands to benefit. Earlier this year, the financial giants BlackRock and Fidelity also were among those seeking permission for a Bitcoin ETF. To be clear, the SEC isn\u2019t now required to immediately implement the findings, but while the agency still could appeal, applications from the likes of BlackRock makes it more likely the SEC will simply accept the decision and approve applications in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cFalls short of the standard\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit began last October when Grayscale sued the SEC after it rejected the company\u2019s most recent application to launch a Bitcoin ETF. Grayscale\u2019s claim focused on the disparate treatment of ETFs that package Bitcoin futures contracts, which the agency has allowed since 2021, and ones for spot market Bitcoin, which it had repeatedly denied.\n\nAt a hearing in March, Grayscale argued the SEC\u2019s purported justification for denying its application\u2014that the underlying Bitcoin market could be manipulated\u2014was unreasonable since the same concerns could apply to the futures market.\n\nRao agreed, and in her opinion she focused in particular on the fact that there has been a 99.9% correlation between the Bitcoin futures price and the Bitcoin spot price\u2014and that Grayscale proposed to rely on an identical \u201csurveillance\u201d agreement as is being used to oversee the Bitcoin futures ETF. This implied that the SEC\u2019s concern about manipulation was not reasonable.\n\n\u201cThe Commission\u2019s unexplained discounting of the obvious financial and mathematical relationship between the spot and futures markets,\u201d Rao wrote, \u201cfalls short of the standard for reasoned decision making.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether trading flat as SEC targets NFT firm - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether were little changed on Tuesday morning in Asia, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. Cardano\u2019s ADA led the gains following bullish comments from founder Charles Hoskinson. He predicted a surge in price past both Ether and Bitcoin. Solana\u2019s SOL posted more losses, despite last week\u2019s news of Solana Pay\u2019s tie-up with Shopify. Analysts expect the generally downbeat summer mood in the crypto market to pick up in fall. Elsewhere, the Forkast 500 NFT Index continued to decline, reflecting more bad news for the NFT industry. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced Monday it has charged L.A.-based media company Impact Theory LLC with securities violations related to its offering of NFTs. Meanwhile, U.S. equity futures were trading flat after Monday\u2019s gains.\n\nSummer blues\n\nBitcoin edged down 0.12% for the last 24 hours to US$26,050.51 as of 07:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The token is down 0.30% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency reached a high of US$26,198.58 in the early hours of the morning before falling back.\n\nEther also dipped 0.40% to US$1,650.23 for a 0.99% weekly loss.\n\n\u201cThere might be another selloff taking place, but currently we\u2019ve experienced the standard August and September correction, through which it seems likely that we won\u2019t be continuing that fall for long and rather have an upwards trend from here on out,\u201d Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, CEO of Amsterdam-based crypto trading company MN Trading, said via email.\n\nVan de Poppe\u2019s comments were in line with a report by JPMorgan Chase & Co. that forecast \u201climited downside\u201d for the crypto market as losses slow. The U.S. banking giant\u2019s analysts found a drop in the number of Bitcoin-linked futures contracts on exchanges that are yet to be settled \u2014 a sign that downward price movement is losing its momentum.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be having a potential run from here,\u201d Van de Poppe said in a weekend tweet. \u201cThis rally should most likely occur in Q4 of 2023, during a good period for crypto markets (October-December tend to be this).\u201d\n\nDid #Bitcoin bottom on this correction or are we expecting $20K?\n\n\n\nThe Million Dollar question is whether #Bitcoin is done on this correction, or whether we'll see more pain.\n\n\n\nIf you'd ask people before the drop, you'd be getting a more bullish answer. If you'd ask people right\u2026 pic.twitter.com/9niq2jhw5k \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) August 26, 2023\n\nVan de Poppe pointed to Bitcoin\u2019s next halving event, which is expected to occur on April 16, 2024, as a cause for optimism from the fourth quarter of this year. The halving event will see the amount of new Bitcoin issued every 10 minutes cut in half, increasing its scarcity. This is widely anticipated to produce a surge in the token\u2019s price. He also highlighted this week\u2019s release in the U.S. of employment data and the purchasing managers\u2019 index as further potential boosts for Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision on Bitcoin exchange-traded fund applications from investment heavyweights BlackRock, Fidelity and others will also play a role, Van de Poppe said. Some of those decisions could be made as early as Saturday.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. Cardano\u2019s ADA led the winners, rising 1.46% to US$0.2669 for a weekly gain of 1.24%.\n\nCardano blockchain founder Charles Hoskinson, appearing at Denver-based conference Rare Evo on Saturday, predicted that ADA will overtake Bitcoin and Ethereum to become the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency. ADA is currently the world\u2019s seventh largest crypto, with a market capitalization of US$9.36 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Solana\u2019s SOL led the losers. It fell 1.35% to US$20.50 for a weekly loss of 3.61%. Those losses arrived despite the news that Solana Pay \u2014 a free-to-use payment protocol built on the Solana blockchain \u2014 has partnered with Canada-based e-commerce platform Shopify to allow USDC stablecoin payments for online shopping without intermediary fees.\n\nThe token gained briefly on Aug. 24, the day of the Solana Pay announcement. It added 7% to US$21.98 before falling back.\n\nBenjamin Stani, director of business development at Hong Kong-based digital asset broker Matrixport, said that the integration of Solana with a mainstream shopping app was a minor victory for the industry and wouldn\u2019t have much effect on markets.\n\n\u201cThis is just another step towards stablecoins going mainstream in line with PayPal\u2019s PYUSD,\u201d he said. He added that, while good news for Solana, its \u201cnot really a major breakthrough.\u201d\n\nPrepare for an NFT bloodbath\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.16% over the past 24 hours to 2,240.52 as of 7:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, down 3.25% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum, Polygon and Cardano indexes moved down, while the Solana index rose.\n\nThe NFT industry was reacting Tuesday to more bad regulatory news from the U.S.. The SEC announced Monday it has charged Los Angeles-based media company Impact Theory with offering and selling NFTs as unregistered securities. The charges are the first brought by the regulator against an NFT project.\n\nThe SEC suing Impact Theory for selling NFT securities is a pretty big deal.\n\n\n\nBecause if you take a closer look at the details, the description applies to quite a few NFT projects \u2013 probably also to one you are holding right now. pic.twitter.com/75kY0QQIDG \u2014 wale.swoosh \ud83d\udc33 (@waleswoosh) August 28, 2023\n\nAccording to the SEC, the company earned almost US$30 million by selling digital tokens, known as Founder\u2019s Keys, to hundreds of investors in late 2021. The agency announcement said that, while Impact Theory has not accepted or denied the charges, it has agreed to pay US$6.1 million in fines and to destroy all the Founder\u2019s Keys it controls.\n\n\u201cPrepare for a bloodbath in the NFT markets,\u201d wrote Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist for Forkast Labs. \u201cSurprisingly, the community seems to have been caught largely off guard, which makes me more concerned in the short term about NFTs\u2019 value.\u201d\n\nPetscher said he expects the SEC to pursue charges against more NFT projects in the future. NFT prices will plummet as a result, he said, as traders rush out of the market.\n\n\u201cThis will be how the market finds its bottom, but we are far away from that actually coming into picture,\u201d Petscher added.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume rose 3.23% in the past 24 hours to US$9.94 million. Volume on Ethereum fell while the other top five chains \u2014 Solana, Mythos, ImmutableX and Polygon \u2014 all logged increases, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nIn terms of NFT collections, blockchain gaming-based titles occupied the top five positions in CryptoSlam\u2019s ranking. Mythos chain-based DMarket took top spot at US$857,652 in trade volume. It was followed by Gods Unchained, Sorare and DraftKings \u2014 all of which posted gains \u2014 and PLAYNFT, which dropped 14.90%.\n\nSome macro positives\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading flat as of 10:20 a.m. in Hong Kong after Monday\u2019s regular session gains. The main Asia stock indexes all rose. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng led the gains with a 1.29% rise on the back of positive developments in both the U.S. and China.\n\nThe Chinese government, which has been exploring ways to address July\u2019s bearish macroeconomic data, reportedly cut stamp duty on stock trading by 50% on Monday \u2014 a first since 2008. Beijing said it also plans to limit the number of new stock listings to help balance supply and demand.\n\nHowever, experts say these measures may not be enough to encourage investors.\n\n\u201cIf they still feel bearish on the economic recovery of China, then it may be difficult to convince them to buy shares just because of these technical changes,\u201d Jason Lui, head of Asia-Pacific equity and derivative strategy for global markets at BNP Paribas, told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMeanwhile, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell used his Jackson Hole speech Friday to say the U.S. economy has grown stronger. However, with inflation still above its 2% target, the Fed will \u201cproceed carefully\u201d on interest rates, he said.\n\nAn unexpected rise in U.S. treasury yields in July and August could also complicate Fed policy. As of early afternoon trading in Asia, the yield on U.S. 10-year treasury bonds was 4.192% \u2014 up from 3.39% at the start of 2023 \u2014 a figure some analysts think could lead to further hikes.\n\n\u201cWas he hawkish? Yes. But given the jump in yields lately, he wasn\u2019t as hawkish as some had feared,\u201d Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at the Carson Group, told CNBC. Last week, Reuters reported that Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker and Boston Fed President Susan Collins both separately said the jump in bond yields could be positive for the Fed\u2019s efforts to cool inflation.\n\nThe Fed raised its interest rate to between 5.25% and 5.50% in July, the highest level in 22 years. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 21.5% chance for a 25-basis-point rate hike at the Fed\u2019s next meeting in September, up from 14.0% a week ago\n\nInvestors now look toward U.S. economic data releases later this week, including the personal consumption expenditures price index on Thursday and the labor report Friday.\n\n(Updates to add Equities section)"

        "title": "Hashdex aims for first US spot bitcoin approval with novel filing - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nA little-known Brazilian asset manager has come up with a novel solution that might see it elbow in front of much larger rivals such as BlackRock and Ark to gain approval for the first US spot bitcoin exchange traded fund.\n\nHashdex\u2019s move attempts to assuage the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s concerns around the risk of manipulation in the spot bitcoin market.\n\nWhile rival applicants such as BlackRock are proposing to establish a \u201csurveillance-sharing agreement\u201d with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase to detect any potential fraud, Hashdex instead says that the calculation of its ETF\u2019s net asset value would be derived from the CME market\u2019s bitcoin futures curve.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange has filed with the SEC to allow Hashdex to convert its existing NYSE Arca exchange-listed $3mn Bitcoin Futures ETF (DEFI) into a spot Hashdex Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHashdex\u2019s application comes amid rising speculation that US regulators are about to end their decade-long resistance to the creation of spot bitcoin ETFs \u2014 which invest in the \u201cphysical\u201d cryptocurrency, rather than futures contracts \u2014 since BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, filed an application to launch such an ETF in June.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s move ushered in a 21st century-style gold rush as big-name rival managers such as Ark Investment Management, Fidelity, Invesco, WisdomTree, VanEck, Valkyrie Investments and Bitwise refiled their applications to the SEC in the hope that BlackRock\u2019s filing would open the regulator\u2019s door.\n\nThe SEC is still reviewing the filings, leaving the industry guessing as to whether or not it will permit any spot bitcoin ETFs, a structure it has objected to on the grounds that bitcoin is traded on unregulated exchanges that may potentially be susceptible to manipulation or fraud.\n\nIf the SEC is willing to relent, however, it would mean all these household names could yet be pipped to the post by Hashdex \u2014 a Brazilian cryptocurrency house that currently manages just $435mn across Latin America, Europe and the US \u2014 less than 1/20,000th of BlackRock\u2019s assets under management of $9.4tn.\n\nDEFI is currently by far the smallest of four bitcoin futures ETFs trading in the US, a structure the SEC has permitted because futures contracts are listed and traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a regulated market. The SEC believes this arrangement provides enough surveillance to avoid the risk of investors being harmed by criminal activity.\n\nThe Hashdex ETF would hold a mixture of bitcoin futures contracts, spot bitcoin and cash. It would buy and sell physical bitcoin via the CME\u2019s Exchange for Physical Transactions, a type of private agreement between two parties to trade a futures position for the underlying asset. These transactions are subject to the CME\u2019s market surveillance.\n\nAs such, \u201cany attempt to manipulate the price of the fund would require influencing the futures curve on the CME market\u201d, a market the SEC is happy to let underpin pricing for the existing quartet of bitcoin futures ETFs, the filing said.\n\nNate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, a financial adviser, described the Hashdex/NYSE proposal as a \u201cbrilliant move\u201d.\n\nA second factor crucially important to the filing is that DEFI is structured under the 1933 Securities Act, rather than the 1940 Investment Act favoured by many ETFs, including its rival bitcoin futures funds.\n\nThe regulated investment companies structured under the 1940 Act are only permitted to invest in securities, not commodities.\n\nHowever, the grantor trusts and commodity pools created under the 1933 Act are permitted to invest in commodities, hence ETFs such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) are structured under this format.\n\nThis is relevant because Gary Gensler, chair of the SEC, has stipulated that bitcoin is a commodity, not a security \u2014 even though he believes most other cryptocurrencies are securities.\n\nIf the SEC does relent on spot bitcoin ETFs \u2014 or is forced to change tack if it loses an ongoing court case with Grayscale, which is suing the regulator for the right to convert its existing Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF \u2014 this could potentially hand an advantage to Hashdex because of its 1933 Act structure.\n\nThere is a school of thought that it would be quicker to convert an existing fund to start trading in spot bitcoin than to launch a new vehicle from scratch.\n\n\u201cIn the event the SEC approves a spot bitcoin, DEFI can simply convert from futures to physical because its structure allows it to hold either futures or physical assets \u2014 as with most commodities ETFs,\u201d said Cinthia Murphy, director of research at the ETF Think Tank, the research division of Tidal Financial Group.\n\n\u201cThere are a couple of filings that need to take place for a \u201833 Act to convert, but once approved DEFI could convert to spot next day post SEC approval,\u201d she added.\n\nThis option would not be available for other existing bitcoin futures ETFs such as the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), Murphy said.\n\n\u201c[19]40 Act funds can\u2019t hold physical assets, only securities, so a conversion isn\u2019t possible. We are likely to see a line-up of \u201833 Act spot bitcoin funds come to market, as opposed to conversions of existing funds due to these regulatory restrictions associated with \u201840 Act funds.\u201d\n\nBeing first may prove to be beneficial. BITO, which beat rival products from VanEck, Valkyrie and the Hashdex ETF to market when it launched in October 2021, currently holds $942mn of the $1.01bn in the segment.\n\nHowever, in this case investors may choose to wait for the launch of similar products from household names such as BlackRock if they believe they will follow on soon after."

        "content": "Robinhood, the commission-free brokerage, holds over 118,000 Bitcoin (BTC) worth more than $3 billion, according to data from Arkham Intelligence, a blockchain analytics company. This makes the brokerage owner the third-largest BTC address after cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance and Bitfinext, data from another firm, BitInfoCharts, shows.\n\nRobinhood Unmasked as Third Largest Bitcoin Holder\n\nAccording to BitInfoCharts, a Binance cold wallet address with over 249,000 BTC, which is worth approximately $6.5 billion (at the current market price) is the largest single BTC wallet. This is followed by Bitfinex\u2019s cold wallet that currently holds over 178,000 BTC, which is worth about $4.7 billion. Another Binance cold wallet with over 115,000 BTC worth $3 billion comes in fourth after Robinhood.\n\nSource: BitInfoCharts\n\nThe attribution of Robinhood to the BTC address occurred after months of online speculation about the owner of the BTC holding. Previously, spectators attributed the address to Gemini, a crypto exchange, and BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager. In June, BlackRock\u2019s submission for a crypto exchange-traded fund with the US Securities and Exchange Commission inspired a flurry of similar applications by other firms in the industry.\n\nThis unknown address has accumulated over $3 Billion worth of #Bitcoin in the last 3 months.\n\n\n\nThe prime suspect?\n\n\n\nThe first major transaction of 3400 BTC occurred on May 16th 2023. Almost exactly 1 month later on June 15th 2023, BlackRock filed for it's spot #Bitcoin ETF. pic.twitter.com/TdFuUkELuH \u2014 DivXMaN (@crypto_div) August 21, 2023\n\nGemini has transferred bitcoins to the new address bc1q....59v2 in the past 3 months. It currently holds 118,000 bitcoins, or about 3.08 billion U.S. dollars. It is currently the third largest bitcoin holder. The first and second largest Bitcoin addresses are Binance Cold Wallet\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) August 22, 2023\n\nShrinking Crypto Trading Volume\n\nMeanwhile, data on BitInfoCharts\u2019 website shows that BTC was first sent to the address, now attributed to Robinhood, on May 8, 2020. The address reportedly received the last BTC transfer yesterday (Sunday).\n\nHowever, the American online trading provider\u2019s massive build-up of its crypto holding comes at a time when the broker is seeing a decline in digital asset trading on its platform. In July, the total volume of cryptocurrency traded on Robinhood declined 38% to $3.4 billion compared to the $5.5 billion generated during the same month in 2022, Finance Magnates reported.\n\nFurthermore, the firm saw its revenue from cryptocurrency transactions decrease 18% to $31 million during the second quarter of 2023. This is even as the number of monthly active users of the platform dropped a million users to 10.8 million.\n\nNonetheless, Robinhood during the recent quarter posted its fifth consecutive quarter of revenue growth. Specifically, the stock trading platform saw its revenue jump 10% to $486 million during the last quarter. Moreover, the firm generated its first GAAP profitability during the period. This means that the earnings were calculated in line with the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n\nMeanwhile, while Robinhood recently lost its case against the Massachusetts Secretary of State, Bill Galvin, at the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, the broker emerged victorious in a legal action initiated by a group of investors who dragged the platform to court over trading restrictions it had imposed during the meme stock frenzy in 2021.\n\nASIC suspends AFS license; FCA warns against 5 fraudulent firms; read today's news nuggets."

        "title": "Declining Interest in Bitcoin? Retail Investors vs. Institutional Players - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "The world of cryptocurrencies, lead by Bitcoin, has been a thrilling ride for both investors and fans. There has recently been talk concerning Bitcoin's waning popularity. A closer examination of the dynamics, however, reveals a more nuanced story: while individual investor enthusiasm appears to have waned, institutional players have been making large moves.\n\nThis article dives into the apparent shift in Bitcoin interest, contrasting ordinary investors' and institutional participants' opinions.\n\nThe Retail Investor Environment\n\nSentiment Change\n\nRetail investors have been a key driver behind Bitcoin's recent climb. However, market sentiment in this area appears to have fluctuated. Because of the volatility of cryptocurrency markets, as well as regulatory worries and the memories of previous market crashes, some retail investors are approaching Bitcoin with caution.\n\nBitcoin's Upsurge Amid Economic Signals and Market Confluence\n\nBitcoin recently surged by almost 4%, reaching nearly $26,800 before holding steady above $26,000 for a day. Concurrently, the cryptocurrency market's total capitalization increased by 1% to approximately $1.06 trillion. This trend mirrored gains in traditional markets, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose by about 1% and 2%, respectively.\n\nThe surge in Bitcoin's value was attributed to disappointing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) figures, indicating a contracting market and suggesting lower inflation risk and reduced chances of a September interest rate hike.\n\nThis upswing followed a recent drop of nearly 8%, which affected the broader cryptocurrency landscape. These shifts occurred within a period of relative stability for Bitcoin, highlighted by its lowest 90-day volatility rate since 2016.\n\nBitcoin's trajectory in 2023 deviates from these steadier waters. Starting below $17,000, it surged to nearly $28,000 amid the Silicon Valley Bank crisis in March and further to over $31,000 post-BlackRock's Bitcoin spot ETF application.\n\nWhile notable, investors are currently in a wait-and-see mode, anticipating the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's decision on the approval of a spot-based ETF. This decision is poised to exert substantial influence on Bitcoin's course and the broader cryptocurrency domain in the coming months.\n\nSkepticism and Challenges\n\nRetail investors, who are frequently motivated by short-term returns, are prone to emotional decision-making.\n\nFear and suspicion might cause people to sell during market downturns, resulting to price decreases. This interaction produces a cyclical pattern in which a price decrease fuels negative sentiment and negative sentiment fuels subsequent price drops.\n\nEducational Disparities\n\nA sizable proportion of retail investors are unfamiliar with blockchain technology and the underlying mechanics of cryptocurrencies. This knowledge gap might lead to rash decisions influenced by news headlines and social media buzz.\n\nThe Institutional Player's Point of View\n\nIncreased Institutional Interest\n\nIn contrast to the apparent reluctance of regular investors, institutional players have shown increasing interest in Bitcoin. The maturing of the cryptocurrency sector, increasing legal clarity, and the acknowledgment of Bitcoin as a potential store of value and inflation hedge have all aided institutional adoption.\n\nInvestment Strategy\n\nHedge funds, asset managers, and corporations see Bitcoin as a strategic investment to diversify their portfolios and limit risks associated with traditional assets. The entrance of institutional participants has resulted in a more stable market, as these firms provide a long-term perspective.\n\nValue Recognition\n\nThe 2020s have seen a significant shift in attitude, with some of the world's major financial institutions recognizing Bitcoin's value proposition. The narrative has moved from skepticism to strategic consideration, with notable figures endorsing Bitcoin and financial firms adopting it into their strategies.\n\nPerspectives in Comparison\n\nPerception of Risk\n\nRetail investors, who are frequently more risk-averse due to personal financial concerns, are more likely to panic sell during market downturns. In contrast, institutional investors are better suited to withstand market changes and can even profit from price volatility.\n\nInvestment Prospects\n\nShort-term market dynamics result from retail investors' desire for immediate gains. In contrast, institutional investors frequently have longer investment horizons, which contributes to market stability and fosters more resilient price patterns.\n\nMarket Influence\n\nInstitutional participants' actions have a more measured impact on the market than ordinary investors, who can cause fast price changes. This can result in a more mature and balanced market.\n\nRegulatory Impact\n\nInstitutional players, impacted by broad regulatory considerations, may navigate market dynamics differently than ordinary investors, who may be influenced by speculative and news sentiment.\n\nFuture Pathways\n\nEducation and Awareness for Retail Investors\n\nBridging the knowledge gap is crucial for the retail investor group. Education of blockchain technology, market fundamentals, and responsible investment practices might help retail investors make more educated decisions, minimizing impulsive acts fueled by emotion.\n\nMarket Maturity and Institutional Influx\n\nThe increased participation of institutional entities indicates that the bitcoin sector is maturing. Institutional investment is projected to increase as regulatory frameworks evolve and infrastructure supporting cryptocurrencies improves.\n\nSymbiosis and Synergy\n\nThe cohabitation of retail and institutional investors adds to a well-balanced environment. While retail investors gain from institutional participation's stability, institutional players can tap into larger retail market sentiment.\n\nConclusion: A Complicated Interaction\n\nThe story of Bitcoin's popularity is multifaceted, with ordinary investors and institutional players offering diverse perspectives. Retail investors, motivated by emotion and short-term aims, have faced difficulties as a result of market volatility and information gaps. Institutional actors, on the other hand, have identified Bitcoin's value proposition, boosting adoption and market maturation.\n\nWhile retail investor attitude may fluctuate, the constant influx of institutional participants implies that cryptocurrencies are becoming more widely accepted as a viable asset class. The interaction between these two investor categories adds levels of complexity to the expanding Bitcoin scene, ultimately defining the direction of this disruptive digital asset."

        "content": "Bitcoin fell with most of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies in afternoon trading in Asia on Monday as traders remained cautious after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said at the Jackson Hole Symposium on Friday that tight monetary policy is necessary until inflation slows down significantly.\n\nSee related article: DeFi revenue remains resilient despite Curve Finance hack\n\nBitcoin hungover post-Jackson Hole weekend\n\nBitcoin lost 0.44% to US$25,915 in 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, bringing its weekly losses to 0.36%. The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency\u2019s market capitalization fell 0.41% to US$504.7 billion as its trading volume rose 40.10% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n\u201cThe cryptocurrency market is witnessing a downward trend on Monday, with Bitcoin and most major alternative currencies trading in the red zone,\u201d Rania Gule, market analyst at multi-asset brokerage firm XS.com, said in an emailed statement on Monday.\n\nAccording to Gule, the drop in prices comes after Powell said in his keynote address at the Jackson Hole Symposium that the central bank is prepared to raise interest rates further, if necessary, adding that future decisions would be made with caution.\n\n\u201cBitcoin prices have been trading within a tight range between US$25,752 and US$26,282 over the past few days. Meanwhile, technical indicators are approaching the overbought zone on both the short and medium-term scales, suggesting a potential upward reversal for Bitcoin,\u201d Gule said.\n\n\u201cHowever, there won\u2019t be a significant upward movement without a strong breach of the formidable resistance level at US$30,000 and a daily close above it. At the same time, the bearish sentiment still holds sway over Bitcoin and the digital currency market in the short term, with potential targets of US$25,500 and US$25,100, respectively,\u201d Gule added.\n\nAlmost all top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies dropped in the past 24 hours, except Tron, which gained 0.11% to US$0.07732, and posted a 2.37% rise on the week.\n\nBNB, the native token of world\u2019s largest crypto exchange Binance, lost 0.32% to US$216, although it has gained 0.66% on the week. According to a Wall Street Journal report on Friday, Binance has removed sanctioned Russian banks from its peer-to-peer trading service, and has reportedly ceased processing transactions involving five blacklisted Russian banks.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dropped 0.62% to US$1.04 trillion while market volume gained 27.69% to US$18.86 billion in the past 24 hours.\n\nNFT sales may remain low for rest of 2023\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index edged up 0.18% to 2,245.24 in 24 hours to 7 p.m. in Hong Kong, dropping 3.54% in the past seven days. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum and Polygon indexes logged losses while the Solana index gained in the past 24 hours.\n\nAt the same time, the total non-fungible token (NFT) sales volume gained 5.04% to US$10.15 million, according to CryptoSlam data. However, NFT transactions took an 11.84% dip while the number of NFT buyers declined 4.27%.\n\n\u201cDaily sales on Saturday and Sunday failed to cross US$10 million, bringing us down to daily lows we last saw in June of 2021. Weekly sales too fell to a 115-week low with just US$81 million in sales last week,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs.\n\n\u201cWe were heading in this direction anyway. It\u2019s the slower time of the year and additionally weekends are slow,\u201d Petscher explained.\n\nThis weekend, Ethereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club celebrated the two-year anniversary of the Mutant Apes and hosted a party in Miami.\n\n\u201cThis probably took a lot of traders out of action for the weekend, so we\u2019ll see if this week and upcoming weekend bounce back. But I expect us to keep finding fresh new lows for the rest of the year,\u201d he added.\n\nGlobal equities rise after Jerome Powell\u2019s comments; China\u2019s new measures boost market sentiment\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nAll major Asian stock markets rose at the end of trading hours on Monday after China introduced new measures to lift its capital markets.\n\nThe world\u2019s second largest economy halved stamp duty on stock transactions to 0.05%, reportedly the first such move since 2008. China also lowered margin requirements for buying securities to 80% from 100%.\n\nChina\u2019s Shanghai Composite and Shenzhen Component Index, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, and South Korea\u2019s Kospi all closed the day in the green.\n\n\u201cThese policies will only help in the short term, as investors are still concerned about China\u2019s fundamental problems including the property crisis and the economic slowdown,\u201d said Kenny Wen, head of investment strategy at financial services provider KGI Asia, according to a South China Morning Post report.\n\nEarlier this month, Nomura Holdings Inc. lowered this year\u2019s growth forecast for China to 4.6% from an earlier estimate of 5.1%. Morgan Stanley cut China\u2019s 2023 growth forecast to 4.7%, while JPMorgan Chase & Co. lowered its outlook to 4.8%.\n\nU.S. stock futures rose as of 8 p.m. in Hong Kong on Monday, following Fed Chair Powell\u2019s speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures, and the Nasdaq 100 Futures were all in the green.\n\n\u201cThe Jackson Hole speech\u2019s cautious tone, in our view, was meant less to suggest that more rate hikes are coming, and more to prevent the market from getting excited about the timing of eventual rate cuts,\u201d Singapore-headquartered DBS said in a research note on Monday.\n\n\u201cLooking at market pricing, there are still some bets on additional rate hikes this year, which we think will prove to be wrong. As for next year\u2019s pricing, we are in line with the view that about 100bps in rate cuts can be expected in 2H24, by which time growth would be substantially lower, along with hardly any risk of inflation rebound,\u201d DBS said.\n\nThe Fed raised its interest rate to between 5.25% and 5.50% in July, the highest level in 22 years.\n\nEuropean bourses gained on Monday, with the benchmark STOXX 600 and Germany\u2019s DAX 40 rising during afternoon trading hours in Europe.\n\nEuropean Central Bank\u2019s President Christine Lagarde said on Friday that the central bank will keep interest rates as high as required for whatever time it takes to bring inflation back to its target.\n\n\u201cIn the current environment, this means \u2014 for the ECB \u2014 setting interest rates at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary to achieve a timely return of inflation to our 2% medium-term target,\u201d Lagarde said in a speech at Jackson Hole on Friday, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\n(updates with equities section.)"

        "content": "Bitcoin dipped under $26,000 earlier this morning amid generally bearish sentiment among crypto traders and the lack of new catalysts to rally markets. Joining us now to discuss the crypto markets is hashtag Cio Samir Age. Welcome to the show. Samir. Hi Jennifer. Good morning. Good morning. Well, let's talk about these markets. It feels like no matter what happens, they are not budging in one direction or the other. What is going on? Yeah, we've seen like a historically low volatility in the markets recently. And I think mostly because there's so many uh events that the traders, the market participants are waiting to unfold that this is creating like a expectation and people are not really looking into taking directional place until you know, like we have more regulatory clarity. Um There's more news around adoption in crypto uh and also on the macro landscape, right? So we're leaving a very uncertain period around like how the fed is going to handle uh inflation. So I think traders are waiting to see how that that's going to play out until they place bigger bats. All right, what's your short term? Look on Bitcoin. Given what you just said, yeah, I think on the short term, like I wrote about this before, I believe the worst is over, right? So we are in a recovery phase in terms of these cycles we see in crypto. Uh So we're really expecting after this period of low volatility, uh the volatility may go up, but we, we probably going to see Bitcoin trading between 55,000 for a few weeks until there are new catalysts like uh like unfolding around like the gray scale lawsuit, the Bitcoin ETF narrative. And also what happens in the macro environment and geopolitical tensions, right? So uh we're probably going to see Bitcoin uh trading in a range for for a few weeks. Uh but we're still very optimistic about the long term. So we always like to zoom out and look at the long term in the long term. We're seeing 22, basically two big trends. There are um growing together the secular trend around crypto uh with like growth of the major networks, crypto adoption going up. Um like Bitcoin value proposition being reassured by the US banking crisis and the largest financial institutions coming to crypto, right, coming to Bitcoin and coming to crypto. So those are secular trends that are going to unfold over the next 5 to 10 years. And in the short term, we're seeing cyclical trends, right? So worse it's over. But like uh the US will continue monetizing its data, we have the Bitcoin housing coming right around the corner in a few months. Uh So we're very optimistic about like uh Bitcoin and crypto as a whole. Uh If you look at longer horizons of, I would say 12 to 18 months in the short term. It's really like it, it's hard to know where the price is going, but we expect it to trade range bound. You mentioned that weak macro environment, you mentioned the potential of rising interest rates. We've talked a little bit about what that means for Bitcoin. What do you think that means for the rest of the crypto markets? It's not only about Bitcoin, we have Ether, we have alt coins. Do you just expect those to follow suit? Yeah, I think Bitcoin and the other crypto assets are very different, right? So um I would say Bitcoin uh has a more like a store of value play. So uh like as we see more inflation and as we see more macroeconomic problems that may be good for Bitcoin's adoptions like we saw in the banking crisis, right? There was a big surprise on the banking prices, Bitcoin going up while all the other crypto were going down. Uh So on the macro scenario, I think if things are are are going in a more uncertain way or a more dangerous way for, for, for like geopolitically that can be positive for Bitcoin, but it's probably going to be negative for the other crypto assets. If we see interest rates going down, that's going to be very positive for, for crypto assets as a whole interest rates going up. That that would be negative for other crypto assets but may be positive uh for Bitcoin. So I'll say like, uh um Bitcoin is its own thing. It's very different from the other crypto assets. All right, I want to take a look at this chart. Now, HASHD tracks insights on indices relevant to the crypto market, the NASDAQ crypto index which has developed in which was developed, sorry, in partnership with hashd experienced a 6.3% quarterly increase. Talk to me about the significance here. Yeah. So what we saw like in, we look at the next last quarter is um basically uh um like um an environment with less news around like uh Macro and crypto specifically, we had the gray scale uh lawsuit. Uh moving on, we had the XRP judge uh uh like uh that, that gave a lot of like clarity for other crypto assets. So, uh we see like uh when you look at the chart here, uh uh A I is still a hot topic and, and it's moving the NASDAQ 100 up. So we've seen like a few names um that are still over performing the overall market. And along those names, we've seen Crypto, uh we've seen Bitcoin and more recently, we saw other assets uh especially because the regulatory uh I would say environment in the US is still uncertain but it's moving in a positive way for crypto. You mentioned A I there is a key market driver. Now, you may not have an answer for this. But um are you, are you following the A I tokens? Are you following what's going on with A I tokens? Given the more macro A I news that um we're seeing. Yeah, as I say, this is mostly a narrative, right? So we really look, we need to look into like a case by case basis. I think it's still too soon uh to, to really understand the implications of A I to crypto. What I can say is that uh um crypto or A I is going to benefit from an open Blockchain, right? As a general long term trend, it makes sense for A I applications for autonomous applications running on the internet to use the Blockchain to exchange value and ex change uh transactions uh using the Blockchain instead of using, you know, like a a visa or a swift network. So I would say uh A I adoption is very positive for crypto, but it's still too soon to, you know, place a specific bets on A I tokens. All right, Samir, we are going to have to leave it there. Thank you very much for joining me this morning. Thank you so much. That was hashtag Cio Samir Kabash."

        "content": "What Is Bitcoin Mining? Bitcoin mining refers to the process of validating and recording transactions on the Bitcoin network. The primary purpose of Bitcoin mining is twofold: validating transactions to prevent fraud and adding new blocks to the blockchain, thereby creating new Bitcoins in a decentralized manner. Key Takeaways: The process of bitcoin mining involves the verification of new transactions against the Bitcoin network, which results in the production of new bitcoins.\n\nBitcoin mining is the process by which Bitcoin transactions are validated digitally on the Bitcoin network and added to the blockchain ledger.\n\nIt is done by solving complex cryptographic hash puzzles to verify blocks of transactions that are updated on the decentralized blockchain ledger. Solving these puzzles requires powerful computing power and sophisticated equipment. In return, miners are rewarded with Bitcoin, which is then released into circulation hence the name Bitcoin mining. Also Read: Blockchain Tutorial for Beginners to Advanced Level\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is the first decentralized digital currency that allows peer-to-peer transfers without any intermediaries such as banks, governments, agents, or brokers, using the underlying technology of blockchain. Anyone around the world on the network can transfer Bitcoins to someone else on the network regardless of geographic location; you just need to just open an account on the Bitcoin network and have some Bitcoins in it, and then you can transfer those Bitcoins. How do you get Bitcoins in your account? You can either purchase them online or mine them. Bitcoin can be used for online purchases and or as an investment instrument. Primarily it\u2019s used to buy goods and services. Bitcoin Advantages Compared to traditional fiat currencies, assets can be transferred faster on the bitcoin network. The system also has lower transaction fees, because it\u2019s decentralized and there are no intermediaries, and it is cryptographically secure\u2014the identities of the sender and the receiver are kept hidden, and it is impossible to counterfeit or hack the transactions. Plus, all the information is available on a public ledger, so anyone can view the transactions. Unveil the fascinating realm of Bitcoin mining while fortifying your cybersecurity expertise through our comprehensive cyber security bootcamp. Learn the intricacies of blockchain technology and cryptographic protocols that underpin cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, all while mastering the strategies to secure these decentralized systems. With hands-on training in ethical hacking, digital forensics, and network security, you'll be equipped to not only mine cryptocurrencies but also safeguard them from evolving cyber threats.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Is Crypto Mining? Cryptocurrency mining is a process of creating new digital \"coins.\" However, that is as far as simplicity goes. The process of recovering these coins requires solving complex puzzles, validating cryptocurrency transactions on a blockchain network and adding them to a distributed ledger to locate them.\n\nWhat Is Blockchain? As mentioned, blockchain is the underlying technology of bitcoin. Blockchain is a public distributed ledger in which transactions are recorded in chronological order. Any record or transaction added to the blockchain cannot be modified or altered, meaning transactions are safe from hacking. A block is the smallest unit of a blockchain, and it is a container that holds all the transaction details. A block has four fields, or primary attributes: Previous hash: This attribute stores the value of the hash of the previous block, and that's how the blocks are linked to one another. Data: This is the aggregated set of transactions included in this block\u2014the set of transactions that were mined and validated and included in the block. Nonce: In a \u201cproof of work\u201d consensus algorithm, which bitcoin uses, the nonce is a random value used to vary the output of the hash value. Every block is supposed to generate a hash value, and the nonce is the parameter that is used to generate that hash value. The proof of work is the process of transaction verification done in blockchain. Hash: This is the value obtained by passing the previous hash value, the data and the nonce through the SHA-256 algorithm; it is the digital signature of the block. SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash algorithm that produces a unique 256-bit alphanumeric hash value for any given input, and that is the unique feature of this cryptographic algorithm: Whatever input you give, it will always produce a 256-bit hash.\n\n3 Concepts of Blockchain To understand bitcoin mining, you have to first understand the three major concepts of blockchain. Public distributed ledger: A distributed ledger is a record of all transactions maintained in the blockchain network across the globe. In the network, the validation of transactions is done by bitcoin users. SHA-256: Blockchain prevents unauthorized access by using a hash function called SHA-256 to ensure that the blocks are kept secure. They are digitally signed. Their hash value, once generated, cannot be altered. SHA-256 takes an input string of any size and returns a fixed 256-bit output, and it is a one-way function\u2014you cannot derive the reverse of the input reverse fully from the output (what you have generated). Proof of work: In blockchain mining, miners validate transactions by solving a difficult mathematical puzzle called proof of work. To do that, the primary objective of the miner is to determine the nonce value, and that nonce value is the mathematical puzzle that miners are required to solve to generate a hash that is less than the target defined by the network for a particular block.\n\nBitcoin Profit and Bitcoin Mining Profitability Bitcoin Profit is an automated crypto robot that helps trade Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies to earn profit. It uses an AI algorithm to identify trading opportunities in the crypto market that can automatically close and open your trade, saving your time and manual intervention during trading. It claims that around 85% of its trades produce profits in normal market conditions. However, technical knowledge is required to calculate the profit generated through the Bitcoin mining process. Talking about the actual Bitcoin profit - the real money making - it depends upon the cost of the AISC hardware, electricity consumption, and the effectiveness of the mining software. Bitcoin Mining profitability has decreased in recent times compared to the previous years because of the rise in electricity costs, costlier hardware, difficulty in mining due to an increase in competition, and a decrease in the Bitcoin prices. Earlier, Bitcoin Mining was initiated using CPUs and easy AI Algorithms, making it profitable and less costly.

View all Related Programs\n\nBitcoin vs. Traditional Currencies While both Bitcoin and traditional currency are similar in that both are a store of value, they differ in many ways. First things first, Bitcoin is the first and most recognized cryptocurrency - a digital currency that is secured by cryptography. Traditional currency, also referred to as fiat money, is a government-issued and regulated currency. Some differences between Bitcoin and traditional currencies are illustrated in the table below. Bitcoin Traditional Currency Tangibility It is a virtual currency and can only be used in its digital form It is a physical currency in the form of notes and coins. However, we can use it in both physical and digital forms Regulation Issued through mining and controlled by a decentralized distributed network of computers Issued and controlled by central government authorities, i.e., central banks. Owing to this, the traditional currency is the legal tender in the country governed by the issuing authority. Governance Governed by a consensus mechanism in which the majority rules Purely governed by the central bank Value Value is backed by the trust of its users. The more users are willing to transact with Bitcoin, the more stable it becomes. Value is determined by forces of supply and demand and is thus vulnerable to inflation Supply Capped at 21 million bitcoin Fiat currency has no supply limit Validation of transactions Bitcoin transactions are validated using blockchain technology and so do not require an intermediary for validation Transactions involve an intermediary such as a bank or a payment provider Transaction fees Minimal or no associated fees as intermediaries have been eliminated Transactions attract considerable charges Transaction time and speed The transaction is almost always instantaneous or greatly depends on the network speed Transactions may take time before verification or before they reflect on the system Security The concepts of decentralization, cryptography, and consensus guarantee a secure network and security of bitcoin transactions Less secure as it can be negatively affected by fluctuations in government policies Reversals Bitcoin transactions cannot be charged back, reversed, or canceled Chargebacks, reversals, and cancellations are commonplace with traditional currency transactions\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Mining Work: Public Distributed Network, POW, The 64-Digit Hexadecimal Number (SHA-256 Algorithm) Blockchain is a decentralized peer-to-peer network that has been hailed as highly secure and transparent, hence trustworthy. This is because records in the blockchain network are secured using timestamps and cryptographic hash functions in such a way that after being added to the ledger, it is almost impossible and impractical to alter the transactions. At the core of blockchain security is the absence of centralized control. Here is a breakdown of what happens during bitcoin mining The Mining Requirements A bitcoin miner will first select their tools of the trade and set them up. These include: Hardware GPU (graphics processing unit), SSD for crypto mining, or ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit)\n\nMining software\n\nA wallet\n\nPreferred mining pool (if one chooses pool mining option instead of solo mining) Once all these are set up and the system fired up, it performs the mining process autonomously. Any other human involvement comes in the event of system or network failure, power outage, or regular system maintenance. Elements of a Bitcoin Transaction When a transaction is initiated in the bitcoin network, three elements are involved: A transaction input\n\nA transaction output\n\nThe transaction amount For every transaction input, a bitcoin mining software generates a unique cryptographic hash puzzle that is difficult to decode. The software then groups the number of transactions required to form a block into a Merkle tree. The Merkle Tree and the SHA-256 Algorithm A Merkle tree is a data structure of the hashes in a block and acts as a summary of all the transactions in the block. In the Merkle tree, hashes of individual transactions known as transaction IDs are paired repeatedly using the SHA-256 algorithm until only one hash identifies the entire tree. This hash is known as the Merkle root or root hash. The Merkle tree enables the efficient verification of transactions in the bitcoin network. The Block Header The Merkle root, the identifier of a Merkle tree, is stored in the block header. The block header contains information about the block and includes the following components: The version number of the bitcoin software\n\nThe hash of the previous block\n\nThe Merkle root (root hash)\n\nTimestamp\n\nCryptographic nonce\n\nThe target This is the information miners will use to solve the hash puzzle and add a block transaction. Solving the Hash Puzzle Miners must solve the hash puzzle by finding the hash below a given target through the difficulty requirement. The target, stored in the header, is expressed as a 67-digit number that will determine the mining difficulty based on the number of miners competing to solve a hash function. It is important to note that this difficulty adjusts after every 2016 blocks are created depending on how much time it took miners in the previous 2016 blocks to solve an equation. This also helps to maintain the rate at which transactions are appended in the blockchain at 10 minutes. To solve the hash puzzle, miners will try to calculate the hash of a block by adding a nonce to the block header repeatedly until the hash value yielded is less than the target. Once a mining computer solves the puzzle, a new block is successfully created that is validated in the Bitcoin network after a consensus between the nodes has been reached. When a block is validated, the transactions bundled in it are verified and the block is added to the chain. As indicated above, this happens every 10 minutes. As there will be many miners (systems) competing to solve the puzzle, the first miner to get the correct hash value earns a reward in Bitcoin. This process allows more Bitcoins in circulation.\n\nMining and Bitcoin Circulation Bitcoin\u2019s upper supply limit of 21 million bitcoin set by its source code by Satoshi Nakamoto, its inventor, is puzzling. However, experts have seen it as a huge advantage because the scarcity of supply breeds value and a stable price for the oldest crypto. From the genesis Bitcoin block mined in 2009 with 50 bitcoins, more bitcoins have since been mined and released into circulation. Bitcoin mining ensures that blocks of transactions are created and stacked in the right order in a way that can be traced and proven mathematically. With the creation of blocks comes bitcoins as a reward, which increases the number of bitcoins in circulation. Bitcoin architecture was structured ingeniously such that every 10 minutes, a block is discovered, and a fixed bitcoin award is offered for every block that is mined.\n\nPrevention of Hacking What if someone tries to hack the data? Blockchain, as the name implies, is a chain of blocks\u2014let\u2019s call the blocks A, B and C. Each block has solved a puzzle and generated a hash value of its own, which is its identifier. Now suppose a person tries to tamper with block B and change the data. The data is aggregated in the block, so if the data of the block changes, then the hash value that is the digital signature of the block will also change. It will therefore corrupt the chain after it\u2014the blocks ahead of block B will all get delinked, because the previous hash value of block C will not remain valid. For a hacker to make the entire blockchain valid for the block B that has been changed, he or she would have to change the hash value of all the blocks ahead of block B. This would require a huge amount of computing power and is next to impossible. With this method, blockchain is non-hackable and prevents data modification.\n\nWhy Mine Bitcoin? Let\u2019s be straight: people primarily mine Bitcoin to earn profits. Other than that, people who are curious about this technology and how it works enjoy experimenting with this relatively new technology.\n\nHow to Mine Bitcoin? The Bitcoin miners are suggested to use mining hardware, such as Ebang, Antminer, Minedollars, AvalonMiner, or more that generates new Bitcoins after every 10 minutes. To mine Bitcoin, the miner is advised to invest in a powerful setup designed specifically for mining cryptos. Excessive or advanced computer knowledge must be possessed to operate the hardware system. The user then has to create at least one Bitcoin wallet for Bitcoin Mining that is secured and convenient. Once the mining hardware is set up and the Bitcoin wallet is created, the miner must adopt strategies to install and configure the mining software. The miner has to apply technical knowledge to improve the mining capacity. The mining process then begins after the miner downloads a soft copy of the blockchain of Bitcoin and clicks on the start button. The miner needs to monitor the progress regularly to ensure that the mining application runs smoothly. However, the miner does not need to do anything manually and can rely on the mining hardware after the mining process is started. Because of the Bitcoin Mining process, new blocks are added to the blockchain. Also Read: 10 Things You Didn\u2019t Know About Bitcoin\n\nHow to Mine Bitcoin at Home? Mining Bitcoins at home is challenging and requires certain steps to achieve good results. The first step is to set up the hardware properly and search for a strong power connection. The person then can create a mining wallet in any trading platform of their choice and join a mining pool to proceed further. The most important step is installing an effective mining software such as Awesome Miner, Easy Miner, and Pionex and then inserting the wallet details and the information about the mining pool. However, the hardware needed for mining is expensive, and everyone cannot afford it. Moreover, mining Bitcoins requires a lot of electricity consumption. Only people who have access to low-cost electricity can afford to mine Bitcoins at home. Therefore, Bitcoin Mining at home can be profitable but needs resources and efforts whose costs are huge.\n\nHow to Calculate Bitcoin profit? Keeping aside the actual Bitcoin profit earned by mining, miners have to perform a cost-benefit analysis to understand their break-even price before purchasing costly hardware or other mining equipment. To calculate the Bitcoin profit, one must analyze the amount spent purchasing Bitcoin currencies. The next step is to check how much 1 Bitcoin costs at the purchase and compare it with the current value. The differences between the current and old values will provide a clear idea about the amount of profit earned. Several factors that hinder Bitcoin's profit are: Cost of Power The price of electricity changes every season. Electricity is consumed not only to mine Bitcoins but also to prevent them from overheating and cooling them down. Time There is no time length for mining. Many miners mine 24x7 as they can afford the mining cost. Bitcoin value Changes in the Bitcoin value are ascertainable, affecting your Bitcoin profit and return on investment. Efficiency Difficulty in mining can arise due to slow computers, low voltage, or any other factor, affecting efficiency.\n\nHow Much Does a Miner Earn - Bitcoin Halving Bitcoin halving refers to the splitting of block rewards into half to mean that miners\u2019 reward for discovering a block is reduced by half. Halving exists to lower Bitcoin\u2019s inflation rate and the rate at which new Bitcoins are released into circulation, keeping the price of Bitcoin stable. The halving event happens after every 210,000 blocks have been mined, which is roughly after every four years. The number of Bitcoins in circulation is calculated by the halving theory laid out by Satoshi Nakamoto in the Bitcoin protocol. When Bitcoin was first launched, the reward for every block mined started at 50 Bitcoins. To date, three halving events have taken place, and the block reward went from 50 from 2009, 25 from 2012, 12.5 from 2016, to the current 6.25 BTC from 2020. The last Bitcoin halving event took place on May 11th, 2020. By September 2021, 18.828 million of the 21 million Bitcoin cap had been mined and released into circulation, accounting for roughly 89.7% of all the Bitcoins to be mined. The next Bitcoin halving event is expected to take place in the early months of the year 2024. Halving should continue until all blocks are mined, and the 21 million Bitcoin supply cap is attained sometime in 2140. After this, the Bitcoin miners will only earn from transaction fees.\n\nWhat Do I Need to Mine Bitcoins? Mining must have been a lot easier in the early days of its launch. As bitcoin and the blockchain concept were relatively new, mining was left to hobbyists on a discovery path. In fact, bitcoin\u2019s inventor Nakamoto mined the genesis block on a basic CPU. As bitcoin continues to gain wider adoption, it has also succeeded in drawing keen interest from investors, miners, and companies harnessing cryptocurrency as a mode of payment for products and services. With this, mining has become a very competitive undertaking, and the hardware and software demands for bitcoin mining are also more sophisticated. Today, bitcoin mining requires specialized tools, including: Hardware such as GPU (graphics processing unit), SSD for crypto mining, ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit), or the latest FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) chips. When purchasing mining hardware, it is important to consider two factors, their hash rate (performance) and electricity consumption.\n\nMining software such as ECOS, BeMine, and Kryptex Miner\n\nA bitcoin wallet from which an individual performs bitcoin transactions\n\nPreferred mining pool (if one chooses pool mining option instead of solo mining)\n\nIs Bitcoin Mining Profitable? Bitcoin Mining is not profitable for all individual miners except a few due to the complicated mining process and high costs. All the miners cannot spend huge amounts of dollars setting up the hardware. A cost-benefit analysis is performed to ascertain the profitability. The amount of electricity consumption in kWh, efficiency, difficulty, time taken to complete the mining process, and the Bitcoin value are deciding factors. The cost of setting up the hardware is very high, and it requires an application of a high level of technical expertise. All the miners are not well equipped with these applications, resulting in low profits for these individual miners. Because of this, miners are recommended to join mining pools where a group of miners can work together. By following this approach, Bitcoin miners will be able to increase their chances of earning more rewards in more Bitcoins.\n\nBitcoin Mining Calculator, a Bitcoin Profitability Calculator Calculating the Bitcoin Mining profitability helps evaluate the mining rewards and mining costs. That can be done with the help of a Bitcoin Mining calculator, which requires the user to fill in details, including Bitcoin mining hashrate, consumption of power in Watts, cost of electricity in $/kWh, and maintenance fees. The hashrate values are adjusted, and an appropriate mining hardware device is selected from the ASIC Bitcoin miners list. The Bitcoin profitability calculator uses strategies for providing reliable and accurate profitability information about Bitcoins. This information is crucial for the miners as they make decisions about Bitcoin Mining based on such information. The miners continue the mining process only if a high profit is earned and the cost of electricity consumption is low.\n\nWhat Does It Take to Run a Profitable Bitcoin Mining Venture? Choice of Hardware Bitcoin mining hardware performance is measured in terms of hash rate. Current new-generation ASIC miners produce 100 TH/s (trillion hashes per second) and cost somewhere between $8,000 - $10,000. Ordinary CPUs do not have the capacity to produce such fast hash rates. Location Developed nations may well have an edge when it comes to location because of the low cost of power. Bitcoin is quite power-intensive. It was estimated that one bitcoin transaction requires approximately 1,544 kWh of power to complete, which is equivalent to around 53 days of normal power consumed in an average American household which translates to an average of $200 in cost for a single transaction at 13 cents per kWh. Thus finding the right location with lower electricity costs of less than 10 cents per kWh will help maintain a profitable bitcoin mining venture.\n\nProfit From Bitcoin Mining In essence, earnings from bitcoin mining should be able to recover the cost of the mining requirements purchased as well as the running costs of electricity. This is possible with efficient hardware, lower electricity costs, and joining a reliable mining pool which we shall see below.\n\nRisks and Limitations To hear some people describing Bitcoin mining, you\u2019d think that all you need to do is solve a few puzzles and you\u2019ll be rolling in easy money. But remember, if something sounds too good to be true, then it probably is. Bitcoin has its share of limitations and risks, such as: It can leave security vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit\n\nThere is no guarantee of success; you could wind up investing a huge amount of money in the necessary equipment and have virtually no ROI (Return on Investment).\n\nIt\u2019s responsible for boosting utility and computing costs.\n\nSince Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are volatile, even if you manage to successfully mine a respectable amount of cryptocurrency, you\u2019ll still be underwater if the value suddenly plummets.\n\nCryptocurrency is decentralized, so there are no government regulations. Consequently, there are no legal protections.\n\nBitcoin transactions are irreversible. If you send the wrong amount or give the right amount to the wrong person, well, your options to correct things are limited.\n\nAnd finally, regardless of the huge buzz that cryptocurrencies generate, at the end of the day, it\u2019s not widely accepted.\n\nBitcoin Mining Electricity Cost Calculator The profitability of Bitcoin Mining is a complicated process as numerous factors affect the profitability of Bitcoin Mining. Electricity consumption is one of the major factors affecting profitability. An electricity cost calculator is used for finding the amount of electricity consumption in kWh. The calculator estimates the amount of kW used in the whole day. After this, the kWh cost is estimated based on the user's location energy prices and then multiplied by 30 to find the monthly electricity expense. Based on these results, many miners shifted to locations where electricity prices were not very high.\n\nA Pickaxe Strategy for Bitcoin Mining During the California Gold Rush of 1849, hordes of people descended on the West Coast to search for gold and make their fortune. Naturally, this was a risky proposition, as success wasn\u2019t guaranteed. But do you know what was a can\u2019t miss success? Investing in the companies making the pickaxes that all the prospectors (the failures as well as the successful ones) had to buy. In the context of Bitcoin, this means investing in the manufacturing companies that produce hardware most often used in Bitcoin mining, such as companies that make GPUs or ASIC equipment.\n\nPooling Resources for Bitcoin Mining While miners may decide to go solo, joining a pool offers them immense benefits. Pool mining utilizes joint hardware capacity and allows miners to spread risks and energy costs while at the same time increasing their stakes of discovering a block and earning a block reward. It is also relatively less costly to join a mining pool, given that the capital requirement is spread across several miners. Even though income from mining is shared between miners, hence smaller payouts, it is stable thanks to the higher-earning stakes. The reward for each miner in the mining pool is calculated based on individual share difficulty and share time in the pool. The more powerful miners are typically assigned a higher difficulty and will thus be entitled to a larger proportion of reward compared to the others. The network automatically calculates the share difficulty and share time. However, each miner will be required to submit their share records.

        "content": "According to a report by Arkham Intelligence published around Aug. 27, Robinhood allegedly holds more than $3 billion of Bitcoin in a single address\n\nThose findings show that Robinhood holds 118,300 BTC of Bitcoin (BTC), which is valued at $3.07 billion and is stored in an address beginning with \u201cbc1ql.\u201d\n\nThat address was active as recently as today. Though its recent transactions are small, the wallet\u2019s balance has grown significantly since mid-May, when it held just over $5,400 in Bitcoin. The address\u2019 balance began to grow soon after that: by May 25, it held about $1.4 billion in Bitcoin, and by June 18, it held $3 billion in Bitcoin.\n\nThe funds in the address are custodied with Jump Trading, a Chicago-based trading firm known to power Robinhood\u2019s crypto trading features.\n\nRobinhood confirmed in a statement to CryptoSlate that it owns the $3 billion address in question and said that it is used to custody user funds in cold storage.\n\nRobinhood wallet ranks third overall\n\nRobinhood\u2019s address is the third-largest Bitcoin wallet overall, according to data from Bitinfocharts.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nHedge fund Pantera Capital predicts Bitcoin to reach $35k then $148k\n\nBitcoin follows patterns predicted by creator Satoshi Nakamoto\n\nPantera believes Bitcoin halving events matter less over time\n\nSince its genesis, Bitcoin\u2019s future has been designed according to a strict mathematical equation. The founder of Bitcoin and blockchains, Satoshi Nakamoto, designed Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain to run itself according to rules that govern the ceiling of Bitcoin tokens issued, as well as planned halving events that would see miners earning fewer tokens over time, creating scarcity of the token.\n\nPantera Capital, a crypto hedge fund, has been keeping tabs on Bitcoin halving events taking place on the chain. The company now predicts Bitcoin to reach $35,000 by its next planned halving event in 2024, and $148,000 after the event.\n\nPantera\u2019s Predictions\n\nThe hedge fund managing assets worth over $4.2 billion noticed a key pattern in Bitcoin\u2019s progression, closely tying its price changes to upcoming halving events.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has historically bottomed 477 days prior to the halving, climbed leading into it, and then exploded to the upside afterwards. The post-halving rallies have averaged 480 days \u2013 from the halving to the peak of that next bull cycle.\u201d\n\nPantera\u2019s prediction model expected Bitcoin to drop in price in December 2022. In actuality, Bitcoin troughed in November 2022, after the events of FTX\u2019s collapse.\n\nAccordingly, Pantera expects Bitcoin to rally twice in 2024, once at the start of the year, and another time after the halving event set in the same year.\n\nMoreover, although Bitcoin has recently experienced a sharp drop in price, Pantera reports that Bitcoin is actually outperforming forecasts by 7%, expecting the token to reach $35,000 by next year\u2019s halving event.\n\nWhat\u2019s even more interesting is that the company expects Bitcoin to reach $148,000 in value after the 2024 halving event.\n\n\u201cThe 2020 halving reduced the supply of new bitcoins by 43% relative to the previous halving. It had a 23% as big an impact on price.\n\nThe next halving is expected to occur on April 20, 2024. Since most bitcoins are now in circulation, each halving will be almost exactly half as big a reduction in new supply. If history were to repeat itself, the next halving would see bitcoin rising to $35k before the halving and $148k after.\u201d\n\nSatoshi\u2019s Plan For Bitcoin\n\n\u201cAnnouncing the first release of Bitcoin, a new electronic cash system that uses a peer-to-peer network to prevent double-spending. It\u2019s completely decentralized with no server or central authority,\u201d reads the introduction of Nakamoto\u2019s paper, titled Bitcoin v0.1 released .\n\n\u201cThe software is still alpha and experimental. There\u2019s no guarantee the system\u2019s state won\u2019t have to be restarted at some point if it becomes necessary, although I\u2019ve done everything I can to build in extensibility and versioning.\u201d\n\nSatoshi\u2019s paper goes on to explain how Bitcoin trading and mining works, citing \u201cI made the proof-of-work difficulty ridiculously easy to start with, so for a little while in the beginning a typical PC will be able to generate coins in just a few hours. It\u2019ll get a lot harder when competition makes the automatic adjustment drive up the difficulty.\u201d\n\nHowever, among the keynotes Nakamoto included in his paper are ones regarding the token\u2019s total circulation limit and details on future halving events on the chain.\n\n\u201cTotal circulation will be 21,000,000 coins. It\u2019ll be distributed to network nodes when they make blocks, with the amount cut in half every 4 years.\n\nfirst 4 years: 10,500,000 coins\n\nnext 4 years: 5,250,000 coins\n\nnext 4 years: 2,625,000 coins\n\nnext 4 years: 1,312,500 coins\n\netc\u2026\n\nWhen that runs out, the system can support transaction fees if needed. It\u2019s based on open market competition, and there will probably always be nodes willing to process transactions for free.\u201d\n\nHalving events are a common occurrence among cryptocurrencies (such as Litecoin) as the process allows for tokens to scale in value by creating intentional scarcity. Think of other valuable commodities, such as gold. The more scarce gold gets, the lower the supply, and the higher the demand for it, hence increasing its value by default."

        "title": "As appeals court rules in favor of Grayscale, a bitcoin spot ETF could be on the horizon - TechCrunch",
        "content": "As appeals court rules in favor of Grayscale, a bitcoin spot ETF could be on the horizon The court ruled that the SEC\u2019s denial of a bitcoin ETF was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d\n\nThe D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled in favor of Grayscale, a digital asset management firm, in a lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on the matter of a bitcoin ETF, according to a legal filing on Tuesday.\n\nThis ruling is in response to Grayscale\u2019s lawsuit against the SEC, which denied the firm\u2019s application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an exchange traded fund (ETF) on June 29, 2022.\n\n\u201cThe denial of Grayscale\u2019s proposal was arbitrary and capricious because the Commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar products,\u201d the filing stated. \u201cWe therefore grant Grayscale\u2019s petition and vacate the order.\u201d\n\nThe court ruled 3-0 in favor of Grayscale, which currently owns 3.4% of outstanding bitcoin, \u201cworth tens of billions of dollars,\u201d according to the filing.\n\nTo many in the crypto space, the ruling represents a huge victory. The news was so welcome that within minutes of the courts\u2019 ruling on Tuesday, Bitcoin\u2019s price rose over 7% to nearly $28,000.\n\n\u201cThis judicial decision is a monumental step for the whole cryptocurrency sector, including Grayscale,\u201d Yusuf Sevim, CEO of blockchain tech-focused Metatime, told TechCrunch. \u201cIt gives a legal and financial stamp of approval, encouraging more traditional investors to venture into the space.\u201d It also set an \u201cencouraging example\u201d that could affect financial markets beyond the United States, Sevim said.\n\nThat\u2019s not hyperbole. A company being able to offer a bitcoin spot ETF could allow folks in the traditional financial world to buy into the crypto market using their existing investing services \u2014 companies like Fidelity and Vanguard that may hold retirement assets, for example.\n\nBringing bitcoin to the TradFi market in a manner that is already well-understood from an operational, trading and fee perspective has the potential to unlock lots of demand for the cryptocurrency in the near-term. Such interest could lead to the ETF in question buying more total bitcoin to meet demand, shifting crypto\u2019s supply equation. More demand with flat supply would send the price up, in other words.\n\nWhen Grayscale\u2019s application was denied a little more than a year ago, Michael Sonnenshein, the company\u2019s CEO, stated that he was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d and \u201cvehemently disagree[d]\u201d with the SEC\u2019s decision.\n\nToday, Sonnenshein is singing a different tune.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 JUST IN \ud83d\udea8 The D.C. Circuit ruled in favor of @Grayscale in our lawsuit challenging the SEC's decision to deny $GBTC's conversion to an ETF! Thank you to everyone who has been on this journey with us, especially our investors. We are grateful for your support and\u2026 \u2014 Sonnenshein (@Sonnenshein) August 29, 2023\n\n\u201cThis is a monumental step forward for American investors, the Bitcoin ecosystem, and all those who have been advocating for Bitcoin exposure through the added protections of the ETF wrapper,\u201d said Jennifer Rosenthal, a spokeswoman for Grayscale.\n\nSending a message\n\nThis is the latest blow in a series of \u201closses\u201d for the SEC. Last month, a federal court ruled partially in favor of Ripple Labs and its XRP token, stating that the cryptocurrency is not a security when it comes to public sales but could be considered one in some cases for institutional sales. The SEC is appealing the decision.\n\n\u201cWe have now seen a second big digital asset decision go against the SEC,\u201d said Jeffrey Blockinger, chief legal counsel at decentralized exchange Vertex Protocol. \u201cTo me, the court system is sending a message that the SEC needs to more carefully understand the limits on its authority and work within those limits.\u201d\n\nThis ruling sends a \u201cclear message\u201d from the court that bitcoin spot ETFs are not inherently riskier than other investment products and that the SEC cannot arbitrarily deny their approval, said Steve Rosenblum, CEO and co-founder of crypto risk management platform Libertify.\n\nThis move could also open the doors to both individual and institutional investors who were taking a cautious approach to the crypto market, or bitcoin specifically, and have been waiting for regulations to be established. \u201cU.S. courts are legitimizing digital assets through litigation,\u201d Blockinger said.\n\nThe court not siding with the SEC also indicates that it may have to consider a more collaborative approach rather than attempting to impose constraints on the crypto world, Sevim said. \u201cThis is a watershed moment indicating that the cryptocurrency arena is maturing to a stage where it can\u2019t be easily controlled or sidelined.\u201d\n\nBlockinger added that he doesn\u2019t expect Congress to give the SEC authority over the industry. \u201cIt looks like the SEC\u2019s aspirations to control the industry in the near term are diminishing.\u201d\n\nThe future of bitcoin spot ETFs\n\nThe ruling has wider repercussions for the entire crypto industry, Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner of Nexo, said. However, he also pointed out that this is just one of the steps needed to unfold favorably for Grayscale\u2019s spot bitcoin ETF to stand a chance of being launched.\n\nAs it stands, Grayscale\u2019s GBTC shares trade at an up to 30% discount to the value of its underlying coins, which, the firm estimates, leaves over $4 billion on the table.\n\nThis new ruling may also pave the way for other companies that want to launch bitcoin spot ETFs, alongside others like BlackRock, Fidelity, Schwab and WisdomTree.\n\n\u201cAssuming the SEC does not appeal, it is likely to result in quick approval of not only Grayscale\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application, but many of the other nine applications pending before the SEC as well,\u201d said Ric Edelman, founder of Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals. This verdict \u201csignificantly increases\u201d the likelihood that the SEC will approve one or more spot bitcoin ETF applications soon, he added.\n\nTrenchev added that the ruling is \u201cundoubtedly bullish\u201d for the possibility of a bitcoin spot ETF and it has expedited the potential for approval.\n\n\u201cThe development is game-changing,\u201d Sevim said. \u201cUntil now, cautious investors had limited options, but a spot Bitcoin ETF makes cryptocurrency investment more accessible and legitimizes it further.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, many crypto players are optimistic.\n\n\u201cThe SEC remains the most dominant and pugilistic of all the U.S. financial regulators,\u201d Trenchev said. \u201cWhat has changed, however, is that crypto companies, including exchanges, funds and token projects, are willing to stand up to have their argument heard. Whether a more collaborative and inclusive regulatory approach will be adopted, only time will tell.\u201d\n\nOn another note, bankers, investment advisors and other financial professionals are likely to feel more comfortable recommending bitcoin ETFs to their clients, Rosenblum said.\n\n\u201cThe horizon looks brighter than ever,\u201d Sevim said. \u201cThis legal victory may well act as the first domino, triggering a series of regulatory relaxations and opening the floodgates for other financial products centered on cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nWhether or not it will actually create a positive domino effect is anybody\u2019s guess at this time. But investors who were cautious about the space prior to this ruling may view this moment as a big green light to hit the gas pedal and drive into crypto land."

The District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Grayscale, handing the SEC a stinging defeat.\n\nBitcoin soared as much as 6% on Tuesday following the court ruling, ether jumped about 4%, and Coinbase surged about 15%.\n\nThe court decision could pave the way for a number of bitcoin ETFs to hit the market, as financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity have been working on applications with the SEC for their own bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe SEC originally denied Grayscale's bitcoin ETF application because it said the company failed to answer questions and concerns related to potential market manipulation and investor protections. The SEC has used similar reasoning for its denial of a plethora of bitcoin ETF applications over the past few years.\n\nGrayscale may be motivated to convert its GBTC bitcoin trust into an ETF to close the valuation gap between the net asset value of its fund and the underlying value of its bitcoin holdings. The current discount of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to its NAV is about 24%, according to data from YCharts.\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust soared more than 17% on Tuesday. The trust has about $16 billion in assets under management and was launched in 2013.\n\nA statement from Grayscale said the court ruling was \"a monumental step forward for American investors, the bitcoin ecosystem, and all those who have been advocating for bitcoin exposure through the added protections of the ETF wrapper.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company said it is reviewing the details of the court opinion and will be evaluating next steps to get bitcoin ETF approval from the SEC.\n\nIf the SEC approves bitcoin ETFs, one Wall Street analyst expects the demand for bitcoin, and subsequently its price, to soar to record highs."

        "title": "Bitcoin may hit $100K by capturing 'even 2 to 5% of gold's market cap' \u2014 Hut 8 VP Sue Ennis - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The next Bitcoin halving event is less than nine months away, and the consensus opinion among analysts and investors is that the halving will send Bitcoin\u2019s price to a new all-time high or even above $100,000.\n\nDespite this belief, the absence of fresh inflow to the crypto market, the current macroeconomic headwinds and Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) recent price action below $30,000 do not inspire much confidence in this theory in the short term.\n\nIn a recent interview with Paul Barron, Hut 8 vice president Sue Ennis shared her thoughts on how the Bitcoin price will rise above $100,000 in the next year and how the upcoming halving will impact BTC miners. Hut 8 currently has a balance of 9,152 BTC in reserve, of which 8,305 is unencumbered. The company\u2019s installed ASIC hash rate capacity sits at 2.6 exahashes per second, and Hut 8 mined 44.6 BTC in July.\n\nIn the interview, Barron inquired whether rising Bitcoin difficulty for miners could induce a fresh wave of sell pressure against BTC. Citing data from Hashrate Index, Barron observed that spikes in Bitcoin difficulty were followed by drops in BTC\u2019s price.\n\nBitcoin price, difficulty and difficulty adjustment. Source: Hashrate Index\n\nBarron questioned if miners were selling Bitcoin as a result of the upcoming halving creating a need for more efficient ASICs and whether BTC\u2019s pre- and post-halving price action would not be as bullish as investors expected.\n\nAccording to Ennis:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of really unprecedented dynamics that are happening now in the mining space. [...] What\u2019s interesting is hash rate continues to come online despite Bitcoin price trading in a certain band. [...] We\u2019re still seeing hash rate increase.\u201d\n\nEnnis elaborated with:\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s changed now is that we\u2019re seeing Bitcoin price come down a little, but hash rate continues to go up. [...] I think what\u2019s really exciting and different is we\u2019re seeing a tremendous amount of new entrants into the global Bitcoin network.\u201d\n\nEnnis referenced six gigawatts of nuclear and renewable energy being generated in the Middle East, and with the region's governments exploring Bitcoin mining as an option, more hash rate is coming online in a way that is somewhat price agnostic. This is drastically different from how publicly traded United States-based and more forward-facing miners operate.\n\nIn order to stay afloat after the halving, Ennis suggested that miners need to be in a position to avoid being \u201csingle-threaded,\u201d i.e., they need more than one way of earning revenue beyond just mining Bitcoin.\n\nRevenue diversification would include exploring various artificial intelligence (AI) applications, dedicating some warehouse rack space to GPUs for companies specializing in AI training and possibly offering industrial-level ASIC repair services \u2014 or even participating in demand-response initiatives with large energy producers and distributors.\n\nRelated: September \u2018crash\u2019 to $22K? \u2014 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week\n\nHigher prices are programmed thanks to the halving and eventual BTC ETF\n\nCrypto investors have waited years for the launch of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), and even with the recent influx of applications, an approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission remains elusive.\n\nDespite the history of delays and denials, Ennis said that a \u201cspot ETF coming to market, that\u2019s incredibly bullish for the asset class,\u201d but she also cautioned that an approval could create sell pressure on miner equities given that mining stocks have often been used as a proxy investment to Bitcoin.\n\nRegarding the percentage chance of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the end of 2023, Ennis said:\n\n\u201cDefinitely better than 50. The real reason for my opinion on that is that BlackRock threw its hat in the ring, BlackRock being powerful and the largest asset manager in the world. For them to throw their hat in the ring and say this is what we want and the amount of clout they\u2019ve had in markets in past initiatives has been tremendous. So I think for them to make this call, that is a real bullish signal.\u201d\n\nRegarding a potential target for the Bitcoin price, Ennis said:\n\n\u201cI definitely do think we could see in this next cycle $100,000 cost per Bitcoin, and that\u2019s based on if BTC were to capture even 2 to 5% of gold\u2019s $13 trillion place in institutional portfolios. If Bitcoin were able to capture even 2 to 3% of gold\u2019s market cap, that would be incredibly accretive to the price and push it north of $100,000.\u201d\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Chinese gov't fires up the printer \u2014 How will it impact Bitcoin price? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "News headlines have recently covered how China\u2019s struggling economy poses significant risk to global growth. Economic activity and the flow of credit in the region are weakening, and analysts are not convinced that the Chinese government\u2019s interventions are a sufficient fix for what appear to be structural problems.\n\nFor instance, industrial output in July increased by 3.7% compared to the previous year, which is slower than June\u2019s growth rate of 4.4%. Furthermore, Chinese banks issued 89% fewer new loans in July versus June, the lowest since late 2009.\n\nBeyond its impact on global economic growth, there\u2019s concern among investors that the turmoil in China\u2019s real estate market might trigger a ripple effect on the U.S. dollar and commodities. This, in turn, could create an unfavorable scenario for Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nOn Aug. 28, the Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 Index, a key indicator of the Chinese stock market, initially surged by 5.5% before ultimately closing the day with a 1.2% gain. Despite this improvement, Chinese shares continue to be among the poorest performers globally in equity indexes tracked by Bloomberg.\n\nBitcoin traders have valid concerns about potential repercussions from the Chinese stock market\u2019s fluctuations. This unease arises from historical price trends and a broader shift in investor sentiment toward avoiding risk-on markets during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty.\n\nBitcoin/USD index (purple, left) vs. China CSI 300 Index (blue, right). Source: TradingView\n\nAs shown in the chart above, Bitcoin's price performance tends to align with the overall movement of China\u2019s stock market, although these movements can be predicted or happen with a time lag. In fact, the 30-day correlation between the CSI 300 Index and Bitcoin/USD reached an unusually high 70% level on Aug. 28.\n\nCan China instill confidence in investors?\n\nInterestingly, the recent surge in the stock market appears to be primarily driven by China\u2019s measures announced on Aug. 27. According to Bloomberg, these measures reportedly included:\n\nSpecial refinancing terms to the real estate sector, which should assist the companies in managing challenges and sustaining economic stability.\n\nReduced fees that encourage companies to buy back shares, potentially boosting stock prices and investor confidence.\n\nSelected trading firms lowering leverage margins, making trading with borrowed funds more accessible to investors.\n\nNew stock offerings are expected to face heightened regulatory scrutiny, reducing the competition for the existing companies.\n\nLimits on selling below the initial public offering price for a specific period to prevent excessive volatility and protect investors from immediate losses.\n\nHowever, it quickly became evident that the measures, which were initially touted as economic stimulus, lacked the intended effect, according to Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura Holdings. He noted that these measures \u201cfall short in halting the downward trend and their impact will be short-lived unless accompanied by support for the actual economy.\"\n\nIn addition to the CSI 300 Index's substantial 23.8% decline since July, there are clear signs of foreign capital fleeing Chinese stocks. Global funds sold around $1.1 billion worth of shares on Aug. 28 alone, contributing to August\u2019s outflows exceeding $11 billion, potentially reaching a record level, as reported by Bloomberg.\n\nThe crucial question revolves around why China isn\u2019t implementing effective economic stimulus packages. The answer may lie in the country\u2019s currency value. The yuan\u2019s value against the U.S. dollar has been consistently dropping, as depicted by the yuan price chart. This trend is concerning, as it indicates the currency reaching historically low levels.\n\nChinese yuan vs. U.S. dollar. Source: TradingView\n\nDespite incentives like tax breaks, government bond buybacks and monetary distributions to the population, which can lead to increased money circulation and mounting debt, there\u2019s a negative impact on the purchasing power of the yuan. The situation is complex and lacks an easy solution, possibly resulting in China experiencing significantly slower economic growth.\n\nA strong U.S. dollar is bad news for Bitcoin\u2019s price\n\nInterestingly, the primary beneficiary of the outflow from the Chinese stock market seems to be the stock market in the United States, ultimately strengthening the U.S. dollar. As capital flows away from Chinese equities, it tends to weaken the local currency, as investors seek lower-risk options like the S&P 500 index or U.S. money market funds.\n\nUnfortunately, this scenario could present a challenge for Bitcoin, considering it\u2019s priced in dollars and competes as an alternative store of value. For those anticipating a cryptocurrency rally due to a global economic downturn, it\u2019s important to note that the U.S. dollar doesn\u2019t need to be flawless; it only needs to outperform other competing fiat currencies.\n\nStill, market dynamics can swiftly transform once investors recognize the potential overvaluation of the U.S. stock market or when indications of a looming moderate recession in the U.S. emerge, irrespective of the relative strength of the U.S. dollar against its counterparts. Consequently, the value of Bitcoin as an independent and alternative hedge remains valid regardless of being presently unable to reclaim the $29,000 support.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "What underpins the value of Bitcoin? - 11Onze",
        "content": "Unlike fiat currencies, Bitcoin is a decentralised digital currency that is not subject to the control of a government or central bank. Its value is not defined by an entity but is derived from consumer confidence. But what underpins this trust?\n\nDespite the differences, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin share some similarities with the traditional fiat currencies we are all used to. Therefore, it is important to understand what gives fiat money its value before analysing why there are many people who see Bitcoin as a store of value.\n\nLong gone is a monetary system in which the value of currencies is underpinned by their convertibility to gold, and since President Richard Nixon assembled his team at Camp David to announce that he was suspending the dollar\u2019s convertibility to gold. The dollar went from being a currency that based its value on the existence of a gold counterpart, to being a fiat currency, with its value derived from the relationship between supply and demand and the stability of the issuing government.\n\nThus, governments and central banks can create money to expand their money supply and stimulate spending through economic mechanisms without worrying about having sufficient gold reserves, at least this is the theory. Therefore, although these fiat currencies are not backed by tangible assets, their value is given by the collective confidence in the currencies. On the other hand, the monetary policies of governments and central banks, as well as economic developments, can cause this confidence and the value of the currency to fluctuate.\n\nDecentralisation, security, and limited supply\n\nThe Bitcoin monetary ecosystem is fully decentralised, i.e. no central authority regulates the monetary base, eliminating the need for intermediaries and giving users more control over their financial transactions. By eliminating central authorities, the creation of currency is democratised, giving more power and freedom to the user community.\n\nThe creation of Bitcoins follows detailed rules in a very strict protocol that is based on blockchain. This blockchain technology uses cryptographic algorithms and makes it more secure than physical currencies and highly immune to crises. Moreover, if the user wants to make a transfer or a payment, he has total freedom, neither the bank, VISA, nor Mastercard have to authorise it. These characteristics, and the fact that thousands of merchants already accept Bitcoin as payment for goods and services, have given it a helpful value.\n\nOn the other hand, since its introduction, a maximum limit of 21 million coins that can be mined was established, which introduced an element of intrinsic scarcity that also contributes to its value, when we consider the relationship between price and scarcity. This is why many people regard Bitcoin as a store of value, despite its volatility. Global regulation of crypto-assets and competition with other digital currencies will shape the future of Bitcoin, but ultimately it will be people\u2019s trust that will ensure, or not, its existence.\n\n11Onze Recommends Bitvavo, cryptocurrencies easily, securely and at a low cost."

        "content": "Shares of crypto platform Coinbase (COIN) are jumping after a federal appeals court ruled in favor of Grayscale's bid to convert its spot bitcoin trust (GBTC) into an ETF. Yahoo Finance Live examines Coinbase's stock action and how crypto assets such as bitcoin and ethereum are reacting to this news.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- Coinbase, shares popping there. The stock tied to the crypto space seeing a boost in today's trading session, closing at nearly 15% now, the move to the upside coming after a federal appeals court delivering a favorable ruling related to a spot Bitcoin ETF, and this all ties back to Grayscale and the ruling, their ruling against the SEC I should say, in favor of Grayscale.\n\nNow, the excitement in Coinbase, there's been some conflicting, I guess, opinions out there in the street, because Dan Dolev over at Mizuho was actually out with a note saying that he doesn't think this is going to really materially benefit Coinbase. But, Akiko, we're seeing the excitement in Coinbase, the excitement in Bitcoin today, and we have seen, certainly, a number of asset managers wanting to get into that spot Bitcoin ETF space.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, Dan Dolev over at Mizuho saying that just because the platform offers crypto doesn't necessarily mean it's positive, because it could actually increase competition and really put pressure on retail take rates for Coinbase specifically. He's already got an underperform rating on the stock. But worth noting, by the way, it wasn't just Bitcoin and Ethereum of the main crypto assets that we follow closely that rallied today. We also saw some of those Bitcoin mining plays also seeing a big bump on the back of this, Ride and Marathon Digital Holdings rallying in the session as well."

        "title": "Court rules SEC preventing Grayscale Bitcoin ETF was arbitrary - Ledger Insights",
        "content": "Today the Court of Appeals ruled that the SEC was wrong to block the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust from converting to an exchange traded fund (ETF). That\u2019s because the SEC had already allowed ETFs based on Bitcoin futures and the prices correlate 99.9% of the time.\n\nHowever, the ruling is not binding for the next seven days which leaves time for the SEC to ask for the case to be reheard. Three Appellate judges made up the deciding panel, but the SEC could request the case be heard before all the judges.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust has been notorious for its discount to market prices, hence the desire to convert to an exchange traded fund (ETF) which will be more liquid as it\u2019s not limited to accredited investors. The trust price reached almost a 50% discount in January and improved to 44% below spot prices in mid-June when BlackRock filed for a Bitcoin ETF. Since then the discount has declined to around 25%.\n\n\u201cIt is a fundamental principle of administrative law that agencies must treat like cases alike,\u201d said Circuit Judge Rao. \u201cThe denial of Grayscale\u2019s proposal was arbitrary and capricious because the Commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar products.\u201d\n\nFutures-based products are traded on the CME, which is a regulated exchange, unlike spot cryptocurrency exchanges. However, the price correlation between the futures and spot markets was seen as undermining that rationale because futures prices are based on spot markets. If the spot markets are being manipulated, then that will impact the futures market as well.\n\nThe court concluded that the SEC failed to provide a \u201creasonable and coherent explanation\u201d for treating similar products inconsistently.\n\nMeanwhile, there is a queue of spot Bitcoin ETFs awaiting approval by the SEC. The key attraction is that ETFs are an accessible surrogate for owning Bitcoin directly without the hassle of custody. Apart from the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust, the SEC is reviewing refiled applications from ARK 21Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, Wisdomtree, Investco Galaxy, Wise Origin and Valkyrie.\n\nThe Bitcoin price jumped from just shy of $26,000 to above $27,500."

        "content": "Crypto asset manager Grayscale Investments has scored a major victory against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in its efforts to convert its over-the-counter Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a listed Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF). Previously, the SEC rejected its GBTC application on grounds that the products were not \u201cdesigned to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.\u201d Grayscale subsequently sued, and the decision has been overturned.\n\nAccording to Aug. 29 court filings, U.S. Court of Appeals Circuit Judge Neomi Rao ordered Grayscale\u2019s petition for review be granted and the SEC\u2019s order to deny the GBTC listing application be vacated. Previously, Judge Rao said that the SEC did not \u201coffer any explanation\u201d as to why Grayscale was in the wrong. However, the order does not guarantee the eventual listing of a Grayscale spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nMichael Sonnenshein, CEO of Grayscale, said on X (formerly Twitter) that its legal team is \u201cactively reviewing\u201d the court opinion.\n\nJUST IN\n\n\n\nThe D.C. Circuit ruled in favor of @Grayscale in our lawsuit challenging the SEC's decision to deny $GBTC's conversion to an ETF!\n\n\n\nThank you to everyone who has been on this journey with us, especially our investors. We are grateful for your support and\u2026 \u2014 Sonnenshein (@Sonnenshein) August 29, 2023\n\nOn June 29, 2022, the SEC denied Grayscale\u2019s application to convert GBTC into a spot ETF. The next day, Grayscale\u2019s senior legal strategist, former U.S. Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr., filed a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. At the time, Sonnenshein said in a statement the firm was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d and \u201cvehemently disagreed\u201d with the SEC\u2019s decision to deny its application.\n\nRelated: SEC delays set deadlines for Bitcoin ETF approval to early 2024\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust is the largest Bitcoin fund traded over-the-counter, with over $14 billion in assets under management. Earlier this year, shares of GBTC traded at a discount of nearly 50% to the net asset value due to the firm\u2019s then ongoing litigation with the SEC and credit concerns regarding its parent, Digital Currency Group (DCG).\n\nIn October 2022, Grayscale terminated material agreements with its partner and digital currency broker Genesis Global. On Nov. 16, 2022, Genesis Global paused withdrawals, citing unprecedented market turmoil amid the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The firm was also impacted by the collapse of Singaporean crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, with a $1.2 billion debt owed to Genesis still unpaid.\n\nIn January 2023, it was disclosed that DCG owes creditors over $3 billion and is considering a $500 million venture capital portfolio sale. Genesis Global owes $900 million alone to users of cryptocurrency exchange Gemini\u2019s Earn program.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nRelated: SEC accepts BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF application, signaling regulatory review"

It\u2019s at $25,650 (Bitstamp) or $24,750 (Binance).

If it\u2019s lost, I\u2019d be looking at a case of $19,500-21,500 as the next big entry point and final capitulation.

Other leading cryptocurrencies have seen similar rises over the past hour.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market cap had largely been sitting still this summer with uncharacteristically low volatility\u2014except when news related to a spot ETF dropped.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd today\u2019s news that the SEC\u2019s denial of Grayscale\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application be reviewed is positive for investors: it means that a spot Bitcoin ETF could finally be coming to the U.S.\n\nGrayscale sued the SEC last year after the regulator rejected its application to convert its Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF doesn\u2019t yet exist in the States because the SEC has been reluctant to approve one\u2014citing market manipulation as a factor. The top regulator currently has a long list of high-profile applications to review and investors appear to be keen on such a product.\n\nThis is because it would give traditional investors exposure to the asset in a safer way: ETFs are investment vehicles that allow people to buy shares that track the price of an underlying asset, and a Bitcoin ETF would allow investors to invest in Bitcoin without having to worry about storing and protecting their cryptocurrency holdings.\n\nIn June, Bitcoin touched yearly highs of $31,000 per coin after Wall Street heavyweight BlackRock submitted its application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nInvestors interpreted the application as positive news for the cryptocurrency because it is evidence that Wall Street is hungry for crypto exposure.\n\nBitcoin has since dipped on regulatory news and macroeconomic factors. Investors also seemed to briefly lose enthusiasm as it seemed unlikely that the SEC would be rushing to approve a spot ETF.\n\nToday's news appears to have renewed optimism that a Bitcoin spot ETF will eventually be approved in the U.S. The SEC and Grayscale have 45 days to appeal today\u2019s court decision.\n\nBitcoin is still well below its November 2021 all-time high of $69,044 per coin.\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated after publication with additional information and context."

        "title": "Switzerland's Legacy Of Financial Freedom Makes It The Best Place For Bitcoin To Thrive - Nasdaq",
        "content": "This is an opinion editorial by Julian Liniger, the co-founder and CEO of bitcoin purchasing platform Relai. Source: Relai\n\nAs a Swiss citizen, it didn\u2019t take me long to understand why Bitcoin is unique. Switzerland is a country that values lots of the critical aspects that Bitcoin offers to people. The small country in the middle of Europe encourages self sovereignty, privacy and financial literacy. The pioneering Swiss banking secrecy was codified in 1934. This regulation, along with its political neutrality and enduring stability, makes the country a \u201csafe haven\u201d for companies and institutions that deal with money.\n\nHowever, there is one critical flaw: What\u2019s the point of using the most trustworthy place in the world to store your money when the money itself is broken? Particularly in recent years, we have witnessed reckless behavior by governments and central banks across the globe. Tumbling from one crisis into the next one, it seems that no matter the obstacle, more liquidity has been (and continues to be) the solution from politicians. This is one of the reasons why price inflation is rising in developed nations, and is completely out of control in developing countries.\n\nBitcoin is a solution to this problem. Bitcoin is the ultimate pristine asset, capped at 21 million units, not centrally controlled, genuinely neutral and global. It\u2019s a monetary good that can be best described as \u201cdigital gold.\u201d And, on top of that, it will act as a foundational layer for a new global financial system.\n\nI still remember my first real employment, which, ironically, was with one of the biggest national banks in Switzerland, called Raiffeisen. It was also when I first tried to understand how money and our financial system worked. I asked the bank employees and managers deep and intriguing questions, like probably no 21-year-old intern had before:\n\nWhy can the bank just create money out of thin air and lend it out to people for a profit?\n\nWhat is fiat money backed by?\n\nWhy can banks just speculate with the savings of their customers and then get bailed out when they fuck up?\n\nIt always struck me how low on substance and high on bullshit the answers were and quickly, I realized that most of these bankers working for the money machine didn\u2019t actually understand how it works. I came to the conclusion that the reason why it works in Switzerland was the high-quality standards, credibility and work ethics of the Swiss people, coupled with the country\u2019s very stable regulatory and political system. These are clearly characteristics that set this nation apart from almost any other one in the world. And, for the same reasons, I think it is why Switzerland experiences among the lowest inflation rates and unemployment rates.\n\nSo, it has built the most fertile ground worldwide for the Bitcoin industry \u2014 and, finally, sound money \u2014 to flourish.\n\nHow Switzerland Is Beating The European Union\n\nWhile Switzerland is in the middle of Europe, it always opted to stay sovereign. This also shows up in terms of the different approaches to regulating Bitcoin. One of the biggest differences between Swiss regulation and the European Union\u2019s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MICA) is the implementation of the Financial Action Task Force\u2019s (FATF) \u201ctravel rule.\u201d\n\nSwitzerland\u2019s travel rule, implemented by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), requires virtual asset service providers to verify the identity of the beneficiary of the transfer. Meanwhile, Europe\u2019s version of the travel rule requires crypto asset service providers to apply enhanced due diligence measures when transactions involve self-custody wallets. What this means is that custodial services that operate in Europe will have to transfer huge amounts of data in order to comply with the much more demanding European travel rule.\n\nAnother one of the advantages of Switzerland is the \u201ckassagesch\u00e4ft\u201d framework. Originally used for exchanging physical coins and banknotes of national currencies, it also applies to Bitcoin. Therefore, you don\u2019t need KYC/AML registration to exchange cash in Switzerland, and luckily it fits the digital age as well. In recent years, FINMA has lowered kassagesch\u00e4ft limits for bitcoin compared to physical coins and banknotes from 5,000 CHF per day to 1,000 CHF per day and now is trying to push the limits to 1,000 CHF per 30 days, a move that has been met with skepticism by Bitcoin companies in Switzerland. But, compared to other countries, the Swiss government has shown time again that it\u2019s willing to talk and collaborate with Bitcoin companies to find the best solution for all.\n\nWhy Managing Risk Matters More Than Ever\n\nOne person\u2019s asset is another person\u2019s liability. This basic rule in the world of finance became very real for a lot of cryptocurrency investors in 2022. Some of the biggest (and in terms of marketing, the loudest) names in the industry collapsed last year, taking customer funds with them into the abyss.\n\nBut it was not only FTX, BlockFi and other crypto platforms that showed us that your assets are only yours as long as the respective third party says so. The banking crisis in Lebanon, rampant inflation combined with financial repression in Argentina and the loss of access to banking services because of political reasons around the world are very real. This all shows us one thing: counterparty risk matters, especially in the uncertain geopolitical future that we are heading into. We\u2019ve seen that USD treasuries can be quickly frozen and sanctioned. The same goes for stocks or any other asset, including real estate, that people hold in other countries. While this has been the U.S.\u2019s soft power of choice, investors have surely taken notice of the downsides of counterparty risks.\n\nIt matters more than ever that Switzerland is the most trusted place for money on the planet. It has always been open to innovation, technology and international finance. Furthermore, it is, both from a regulatory and political perspective, very decentralized and community driven. Switzerland consists of 26 autonomous cantons and offers its citizens true direct democracy. When taking a closer look, the similarities between Switzerland and Bitcoin are striking: Any Swiss citizens can start an initiative to change the federal constitution, and if they manage to collect at least 100,000 signatures, the whole country will vote for it, almost like a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP).\n\nIt should come as no surprise then that Switzerland plays a crucial role in the Bitcoin market today, known as a \u201ccrypto nation,\u201d with Zug as the \u201cCrypto Valley\u201d and Lugano with the \u201cPlan \u20bf\u201d initiative, hosting hundreds of companies and thousands of employees working in this space.\n\nParticularly Lugano, Switzerland\u2019s ninth-largest city with a population of over 60,000 located in the Italian-speaking southern region, shows how Bitcoin innovation and adoption should be done: in a curious, open and grassroots way. Lugano Mayor Michele Foletti is not afraid to take the leap here, to show the world firsthand why the decentralized Swiss governance model enables projects like the advent of a bitcoin-focused city. More than 100 merchants, restaurants and bars accept bitcoin in Lugano. It\u2019s expected that soon, taxes can be paid in bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies), which means that it\u2019s very easy to seamlessly delve into a new, open monetary network.\n\nThe Trust Crisis Is An Opportunity For Bitcoin And Switzerland\n\nPublic trust in institutions like (central) banks, politics and legacy media outlets is at its lowest point in decades. In particular, younger people are looking for new answers. According to a recent survey, 45% of millennials said they prefer bitcoin to stocks, gold or real estate. More than half (51%) of millennials said they have more faith in Bitcoin than in financial institutions.\n\nThis is bullish for Bitcoin. However, there are still obstacles. The tedious onboarding process, complicated user interfaces, lousy customer support and lack of self-custody solutions are still a reality for newbies interested in buying their first bitcoin. It\u2019s clear what we have to do to get bitcoin in as many hands as possible: make buying and selling it easier. Get rid of all the hindrances, and allow anyone to stack sats in their own, self-hosted wallet, directly.\n\nBitcoin is about long-term thinking, about saving. And people are desperate for ways to save money that they can genuinely trust again, solutions that don't get eaten away by inflation or high fees, solutions that are ready for the digital age and that can\u2019t be frozen or censored in any way.\n\nI believe that Bitcoin is a force for good that can accelerate financial and, therefore human, freedom. Going forward, Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s invention will play an integral role not only as an asset without counterparty risk but also as an alternative financial layer that can host a wide range of services.\n\nThe Future Of Bitcoin-Only Is Bright, In Switzerland And Beyond\n\nTrue to its history as a place that fosters financial innovation instead of killing it, Switzerland will thrive in a world that is increasingly embracing Bitcoin.\n\nBut despite the growing recognition and adoption of Bitcoin by the financial industry, it remains a bottom-up movement driven by its community of users, developers and enthusiasts. They are committed to the principles of decentralization, privacy and financial freedom and work to promote the use and adoption of bitcoin as a digital currency. The community is active in organizing meetups, forums and events where it can share its experiences and knowledge with others and work together to improve the technology.\n\nEven in the European Union, where the will to innovate with Bitcoin seems less determined, Nakamoto\u2019s innovation will thrive. With a coherent regulatory framework on the horizon, Bitcoin is set for a bright future in Europe \u2014 no matter how hard some politicians want to fight it. Despite an ongoing energy crisis and attacks on Bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption, it\u2019s clear that there will be demand for an asset like bitcoin. High price inflation, financial repression and a looming euro-based central bank digital currency will drive adoption and demand.\n\nThis is a guest post by Julian Liniger.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin is on the rise Tuesday following news that crypto firm Grayscale won a court appeal against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\u2014and BTC-related cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin Cash and Stacks are seeing even larger gains.\n\nWhile BTC has posted a 7% gain over the past 24 hours, sitting at a current price of $27,970 per CoinGecko, Bitcoin Cash has jumped 17% to a price of about $223. It\u2019s currently the biggest gainer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap.\n\nBitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency that was created via a blockchain that forked away from Bitcoin in 2017, and has persisted since then. That means the creators copied Bitcoin's code and then went on to create an entirely separate asset and network. It\u2019s the 18th most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap per CoinGecko, as of this writing, although both its price and market cap pale in comparison to BTC itself.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe next-largest gainer today in the top 100 is also tied to BTC. It\u2019s Stacks, a layer-2 network built on top of the BTC network to enable smart contracts, which can power things like decentralized apps (dapps) and NFT collectibles. Stacks has risen about 13% today to a current price of $0.51.\n\nMeanwhile, another Bitcoin-related coin, Bitcoin SV\u2014itself forked from Bitcoin Cash\u2014has popped 10% over the past 24 hours to a current price of $34 per coin. Broadly, the entire cryptocurrency market is up more than 5% in the past day, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThe upward movement is tied to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruling Tuesday, which said the SEC was wrong to reject an application by Grayscale to convert its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a formal BTC spot exchange-traded fund (ETF). The court said that the SEC \u201cfailed to adequately explain\u201d its rejection of Grayscale\u2019s ETF application.\n\nThe SEC now has to review the application, but still has 45 days to appeal the judge's opinion. The SEC has repeatedly denied Bitcoin spot ETF applications, citing market manipulation fears. A spot ETF would let investors gain exposure to the leading cryptocurrency without actually holding and storing BTC.\n\nMany such applications are still in play, including from BlackRock and WisdomTree. A spot Bitcoin ETF is seen by many as a route to mainstream institutional adoption for crypto. While Tuesday\u2019s court decision does not ensure that a spot BTC fund will be approved, it does clear a prominent legal hurdle in the pursuit by Grayscale and others.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

BTC price shed 13.9% in August 2022, a move which marked the beginning of half a year of pain.\n\nBTC/USD monthly returns (screenshot).

What was the worst BTC August drawdown in history? -17% in 2014 and -18% in 2015. Currently in 2023, $BTC is now down -16%. If BTC were to drop -18% this August, BTC would drop to ~$24700. But that might not be the end of the retrace.\u201d\n\nContinuing, Rekt Capital noted that September usually offers a \u201csingle-digit drawdown.\u201d Against the backdrop of its recent double top on weekly timeframes, a $22,000 target lines up.\n\n\u201cSo if BTC retraces, say, an additional -10% in September... That would mean price would drop to ~$22200,\u201d he concluded.\n\n\u201cThen that would approximately match the Measured Move target for the Double Top breakdown of ~$22000.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart.

        "content": "If you read the last Excell with Options, I discussed the Treasury market and the issuance that is coming over the coming months. I discussed how foreign investors in China and Japan may be losing their appetite for U.S. Treasuries and how that may be a consideration for why U.S. yields are moving higher.\n\nIf I look at U.S. yields and compare them to the bitcoin/ether cross rate over the past couple years, I see some correlation. When considering the value of any assets, I think the core approach should consider a discounted cash flow. At some level, the value of an asset is due to the cash flow you will get back from it. This may be in the short term with Treasuries, dividend-paying stocks, and corporate bonds. Or, it may be in the long term considering stocks with no earnings, artwork, and cryptocurrencies. Long-term holders of bitcoin do so because of the declining supply. The assumption here is at some point in the future, fees will be charged because there is no new issuance of bitcoin. The current value of bitcoin is then a function of these future fees or cash flow, discounted back to the current time. The same is true for ether, except it has much more current cash flow. While the staking yield may not quite approach Treasury yields, it is much higher than 0%. Holders of ether get paid to wait and so the discounted cash flow looks quite different.\n\nThis is not to say one is better or worse than the other. Is high-growth tech better or worse than dividend-paying stocks? I think there is a time and a place for all investments. When rates are going higher, though, assets with more cash flow are often preferred. This may be why the bitcoin/ether cross rate appears to be heading higher, based on Treasury yields. If this is the case, the cross could break out above the cloud."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA judge has ordered that the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) denial of Grayscale\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application be reviewed, according to an opinion issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on Tuesday.\n\nThe decision represents a landmark moment for crypto. The SEC has denied several applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs, which allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without holding the coin, for a decade while citing market manipulation concerns.\n\nThe court explained the SEC lacked a coherent explanation for the denial.\u201cThe Commission failed to adequately explain why it approved the listing of two bitcoin futures ETPs but not Grayscale\u2019s proposed bitcoin ETP,\u201d the court opinion said. \u201cIn the absence of a coherent explanation, this unlike regulatory treatment of like products is\n\nunlawful.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGrayscale applauded the decision, saying this is a huge development for investors.\n\n\"This is a monumental step forward for American investors, the Bitcoin ecosystem, and all those who have been advocating for Bitcoin exposure through the added protections of the ETF wrapper,\" a Grayscale spokesperson said in a statement. \"The Grayscale team and our legal advisors are actively reviewing the details outlined in the Court\u2019s opinion and will be pursuing next steps with the SEC.\"\n\nSeen within crypto circles as a potential gateway to mainstream institutional adoption, a spot Bitcoin ETF would enable investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin through a traditional stock exchange and effectively hold the coin in a brokerage account.\n\nAfter the court\u2019s decision was released, Bitcoin rallied 5% to $27,300 in under an hour, according to CoinGecko. The crypto market swelled broadly as well, with coins like Ethereum and XRP up over 4% during that same span.\n\nThe SEC and Grayscale have 45 days to appeal Tuesday\u2019s court decision. If that happens, the case could either be sent to the U.S. Supreme Court or be subject to an en banc panel review, where all of the court\u2019s judges would weigh in during a rehearing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to the Yale Journal of Regulation, which refers to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit as America\u2019s \u201csecond most important court,\u201d en banc reviews are rare. A majority of the court\u2019s judges would need to approve an en banc review.\n\nGrayscale took the SEC to court last June. The firm\u2019s lawsuit followed a rejection from the SEC to convert its flagship Bitcoin fund, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, into a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nGBTC has $16.2 billion in assets under management, according to Grayscale\u2019s website. Relative to its Bitcoin holdings, shares in the trust trade at a discount because of the offering\u2019s structure.\n\nBitcoin futures ETFs have been welcomed on Wall Street by the SEC since ProShares' Bitcoin futures ETF launched on the New York Stock Exchange in 2021. Bitcoin futures ETFs give investors exposure to contracts that trade on CFTC-regulated exchanges, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).\n\nThe court described the SEC's denial as \"arbitrary and capricious\" on Tuesday, saying it failed to reasonably explain why Bitcoin Futures ETFs have been approved but not spot-based ones. It took issue with the SEC's stance that fraud and manipulation concerns in spot markets are different than with regard to futures.\n\n\"Because the spot bitcoin market and the CME bitcoin futures market are so tightly correlated, a price distortion in the spot market will be reflected in the price of the futures market,\" the opinion states. \"After all, futures are derivatives of the spot market.\"\n\n\n\nWhile a spot Bitcoin ETF has proved elusive for years, they could soon become commonplace after Tuesday's ruling. Several Wall Street titans, including BlackRock and Fidelity, have filed applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs of their own. And Grayscale argued in July that all applications on the SEC's desk should be approved at once if a regulatory green light comes.\n\nEditor's Note: Updated to include an excerpt from the court decision and a statement from Grayscale.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "A federal judge has overturned the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s decision to deny an exchange-traded fund (ETF) offering from Grayscale Investments through its Bitcoin Trust, but many experts have pointed out the court ruling will not automatically lead to the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the country.\n\nIn an Aug. 29 decision with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Judge Neomi Rao supported Grayscale\u2019s position that its proposed Bitcoin (BTC) ETF was \u201cmaterially similar\u201d to Bitcoin futures exchange-traded products already approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for trading. The court largely ruled that the SEC\u2019s justification of denying Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF on the grounds it was not \u201cdesigned to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices\u201d was insufficient, and the matter will return to the commission for review.\n\nTHIS JUST IN: The D.C. Circuit ruled 3-0 in favor of Grayscale and $GBTC. This is a monumental step forward for all who have been advocating for Bitcoin exposure through the added protections of the ETF wrapper. Read the decision: https://t.co/ulAtcsad2G pic.twitter.com/BNZABvM7tw \u2014 Grayscale (@Grayscale) August 29, 2023\n\nTo date, the SEC has denied all spot crypto ETF offerings in the U.S., though many applications are currently being reviewed, including those from BlackRock, ARK Invest, Bitwise Asset Management, VanEck, WisdomTree, Invesco and Galaxy Digital, Fidelity, and Valkyrie. The commission has the means to keep delaying a decision or otherwise pushing the final deadline for approval on the majority of the aforementioned applications until March 2024.\n\nAt the time of publication, the SEC had not publicly commented on the appeals court decision but reportedly said it would be reviewing the case to determine its next steps. The commission will likely have the opportunity to appeal the decision, but many experts have claimed that the initial Grayscale victory could pave the way for eventual approval.\n\n\u201cDespite the inevitable SEC appeal, to our mind there is no doubt now, spot BTC ETFs are coming to the U.S.,\u201d said Tim Bevan, CEO at ETC Group. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe the SEC will act as kingmaker and the most likely outcome is a block approval of applications that meet requirements, probably in Q1 \u201924.\u201d\n\nLolli CEO and co-founder Alex Adelman said the appeals court ruling would \u201cput new pressure on the SEC\u201d in its justification for rejecting spot Bitcoin ETF applications. He added the BTC price rally following the news could be interpreted as a \u201cvote of confidence\u201d for spot investment vehicles linked to Bitcoin:\n\n\u201cNow is the time for the U.S. to embrace innovation by making bitcoin available to investors through exchange-based products or risk falling behind global powers that are moving faster to claim this advantage.\u201d\n\nRelated: Jacobi spot Bitcoin ETF classed as \u2018environmental investing\u2019 by issuer\n\nA spokesperson for the Crypto Council for Innovation (CCI) told Cointelegraph the ruling opened the door to a wider range of investors looking to offer a spot BTC vehicle in the United States. According to the CCI, \u201cspot bitcoins ETFs are now closer to a potential launch.\u201d\n\nSome have asked whether they could revoke the bitcoin futures ETFs, highly unlikely in our view, esp given their recent openness to Ether futures ETFs. In the end, I know it and you know it and even animals know it- the best move is to just approve the damn things already. https://t.co/fZCOIur4of \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) August 29, 2023\n\nThe next steps for either Grayscale moving forward with its application or the SEC appealing the decision are unclear. The asset manager could refile with the SEC, aiming to make the spot investment vehicle application more like that of a Bitcoin futures-linked ETF. Experts are reporting the SEC also has the option of filing for an \"en banc\" hearing in which all judges on the D.C. circuit \u2014 rather than the three which ruled on the Grayscale appeal \u2014 would hear the matter.\n\nMagazine: SEC calls ETF filings inadequate, Binance loses euro partner and other news: Hodler\u2019s Digest, June 25 \u2013 July 1"

Discover SCENE\n\nGrayscale\u2019s courtroom victory over the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday was good news for crypto, with markets showing green. But on Wall Street, Coinbase was also flying high, and there\u2019s a strong indication as to perhaps why.\n\nShares of Coinbase were up 15% when markets closed on Tuesday. The gains outpaced Bitcoin itself, which was up 7% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThe upswing came after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit sided with Grayscale\u2014ordering the SEC to reconsider an application to convert its flagship Bitcoin fund, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), into a spot Bitcoin ETF and calling previous denials \u201ccapricious.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGrayscale argued in July that the SEC should approve all Bitcoin ETFs at once when the time comes, saying America's financial watchdog \u201cshould not pick winners and losers.\u201d And as anticipation grows that a spot Bitcoin ETF could soon be approved, Coinbase is in a unique position to see a lot of upside, according to Coinbase\u2019s Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal.\n\n\u201cCoinbase has a significant role to play as the custodian of choice, ensuring protection of client assets,\u201d he told Decrypt in a written statement. \u201cOur commitment to surveillance-sharing agreements with listing exchanges reinforces our commitment to support and augment their compliance efforts.\u201d\n\nFirms including BlackRock, the $8.5 trillion asset manager, have named Coinbase as the custodian of coins in its spot Bitcoin ETF. The product, which has yet to be approved in the U.S., would give investors indirect Bitcoin exposure without having to hold BTC themselves.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs entail Bitcoin being purchased with a respective amount of shares being doled out. While BlackRock has chosen Coinbase as its prospective custodian, other firms like Valkyrie have removed the exchange in amended applications.\n\nAmerica\u2019s leading cryptocurrency exchange has also established so-called surveillance-sharing agreements with the Cboe BZX Exchange and Nasdaq, where several firms have applied to list spot Bitcoin ETFs of their own.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUnder the agreements, Coinbase would bolster the Cboe and Nasdaq\u2019s ability to detect potential fraud and manipulation in Bitcoin\u2019s spot market by providing information about trading, clearing activity, and customer identification.\n\nThe agreements serve the purpose of quelling the SEC\u2019s Bitcoin-related market manipulation concerns, a common refrain cited in the agency\u2019s repeated Spot Bitcoin ETF denials dating back to 2013.\n\nHowever, in its opinion on Tuesday, the court said that existing surveillance-sharing agreements for Bitcoin futures ETFs\u2014first listed in 2021 following SEC approval\u2014should be enough to abate them.\n\n\u201cThe underlying assets\u2014bitcoin and bitcoin futures\u2014are closely correlated,\u201d the opinion stated. \u201cThe surveillance sharing agreements with the CME are identical and should have the same likelihood of detecting fraudulent or manipulative conduct in the market for bitcoin and bitcoin futures.\"\n\nThe court\u2019s opinion calls into question whether some firms could potentially alter the surveillance-sharing agreement listed in their applications to mirror Grayscale or other Bitcoin futures ETFs that have already been approved.\n\nTo be clear, compensation details are sparse regarding Coinbase\u2019s deal with the Nasdaq and Cboe in several spot Bitcoin ETF applications, including BlackRock\u2019s and Invesco\u2019s, so it\u2019s hard to tell how much revenue Coinbase could potentially see.\n\n\u201cIt's kind of hard to say at the moment, without them sort of disclosing it,\u201d Needham & Company analyst John Todaro told Decrypt. \u201cIt seems like we have to wait and see in terms of what kind of information we get from a public information perspective.\u201d\n\nStill, it\u2019s clear that Wall Street is feeling somewhat optimistic.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven though the court sided with Grayscale on the sufficiency of existing surveillance-sharing agreements, that doesn\u2019t mean spot and futures markets shouldn\u2019t both be monitored, Sacha Ghebali, director of strategy at The Tie, a crypto analytics platform, told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cThe key argument of the court is that the SEC is not providing evidence showing that fraud and manipulation could affect spot and regulated futures markets differently,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, monitoring for fraud and manipulation remains important as the ultimate goal is that price discovery happens on \u2018clean\u2019 markets.\u201d"

        "content": "\n\n\n\nIn the fast-evolving world of crypto, Hashdex, a crypto asset management firm, has entered the race for the first US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The company has formally submitted an application to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with a unique approach: they are seeking approval for a Bitcoin futures ETF incorporating direct investments in spot Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) function as investment vehicles traded on stock markets, with their value tied to an underlying mix of assets like stocks, bonds, and commodities. Similarly, Bitcoin ETFs track the value of Bitcoin and trade on traditional stock exchanges, setting them apart from crypto exchanges.\n\nUnlike recent endeavours from giants like BlackRock that relied on a surveillance-sharing agreement with the crypto exchange Coinbase, Hashdex has chosen a different path. The company plans to acquire spot Bitcoin through reputable physical exchanges operating within the CME market. This approach sets Hashdex apart and reflects a unique strategy. A 19b-4 filing with the SEC indicates that Hashdex aims to rename its ETF and modify its ticker to Hashdex Bitcoin ETF.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial analysts have had varying opinions of Hashdex's distinctive Bitcoin ETF filing. For instance, James Seyffart, a Bloomberg analyst, highlighted the strategy's focus on exchange for related positions transactions. This involves exchanging futures contracts for an equivalent exposure to spot Bitcoin, diverging from direct cash purchases on exchanges.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeyffart predicts a higher likelihood of SEC approval on this proposal due to external pressures on Gary Gensler, chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, driven by factors such as the increasing Ethereum futures ETF proposals and BlackRock's adoption of the Coinbase surveillance sharing agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteworthy figures in the financial sector, including Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store, investor Alistair Milne, and finance attorney Scott Johnsson, have also commented on Hashdex's distinct Bitcoin ETF submission. They believe it could address specific SEC concerns related to Bitcoin market manipulation and liquidity.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF seems close, the latest unfolding scenarios in the US crypto space emphasise the ever-evolving dynamics of the crypto realm. While the industry wrestles with complex regulatory challenges and security deliberations, the results of these occurrences continue to captivate keen attention.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe writer is the founder at yMedia.
