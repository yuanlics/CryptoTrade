        "title": "German Authorities Seize $2 Billion Worth of Bitcoin - The New York Times",
        "content": "A German programmer who is accused of running an illegal movie streaming site more than a decade ago transferred $2.17 billion worth of Bitcoin to the authorities to repay at least some of the money he had made illegally, the police said on Tuesday. The transfer required the man to use his unique Bitcoin credentials to hand over the funds.\n\n\u201cThis is the most extensive seizure of Bitcoins by law enforcement in the Federal Republic of Germany to date,\u201d said Kay Anders, a spokesman for the Saxony state police. The money will remain in the authorities\u2019 Bitcoin account until a court can figure out what to do with it, Mr. Anders added.\n\nThe man, identified only as a 40-year-old German citizen, and his business partner are under investigation on allegations that they ran what was once the country\u2019s most successful illegal video-sharing site.\n\nIn its heyday, from 2008 to 2013, the site, movie2k.to, had tens of thousands of movies in a host of languages available for download. Users from around the world visited the site, making it among the 25 most-visited websites in Germany, according to news reports at the time. After the authorities shut it down in 2013, several sites with similar names opened to fill the void."

From a regulatory standpoint, it has become more crypto-friendly over the last few years, with some of its biggest banks seeking crypto-custody licenses.\n\nGermany granted a crypto custody license to Commerzbank in November, making it the first \u201cfull-service bank\u201d to receive such a license.\n\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s Paul Maley told Blockworks last September that it was interested in offering corporate and institutional clients custody of \u201cselected cryptocurrencies and some stablecoins.\u201d\n\nThe bank applied for a crypto custody license back in June of last year.\n\nUpdated Jan. 39, 2024 at 11:07 am ET: Modified headline to reflect value of bitcoin seizure.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Conchagua (El Salvador) (AFP) \u2013 When President Nayib Bukele announced plans to create the world's first \"Bitcoin City,\" a futuristic metropolis financed by cryptocurrency bonds, American Corbin Keegan packed up his life in Chicago and headed for El Salvador.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nMore than two years later, no brick has been laid, and 42-year-old Keegan ekes out a living in Playa Blanca, a coastal town in the Conchagua municipality named after the nearby volcano meant to power the new city of which he hopes to be the first resident.\n\n\"It's going to happen. So I'm staying,\" he told AFP, sitting in a hammock and sipping coffee as waves crashed on the beach a few meters away.\n\n\"I'll wait as long as it takes.\"\n\nTo fireworks and fanfare, Bukele announced in November 2021 that his \"Bitcoin City\" would boast everything from residential and commercial areas to museums, an airport and a monument to the currency on its central square.\n\nBukele said geothermal energy generated by the Conchagua volcano would power the city some 200 kilometers (125 miles) east of the capital San Salvador.\n\nIt would also power bitcoin mining -- the massively energy-consuming process by which bitcoin is created using supercomputers that solve complex mathematical problems.\n\nEl Salvador President Nayib Bukele announced in November 2021 that his 'Bitcoin City' would boast everything from residential and commercial areas to a monument to the currency \u00a9 Marvin RECINOS / AFP\n\nThe president's announcement came just two months after El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender despite a chorus of warnings about the currency's notorious volatility.\n\nIn September 2021, bitcoin traded at about $45,000 and a few months later it reached a record $68,000. But it later dipped to a low of about $16,000 and is today again hovering around $40,000.\n\n'It cannot be stopped'\n\nBukele had promised the issuing of $1 billion in bitcoin bonds, partly to finance his city. But that did not happen.\n\nThe government has invested an undisclosed amount of taxpayer money in the cryptocurrency -- vowing at one point it would buy a bitcoin a day -- though it is not known whether this has come to pass.\n\nA poll by the Central American University found that hardly anyone used bitcoin last year in El Salvador, where the other legal tender is the US dollar.\n\nAccording to the UN, more than a quarter of Salvadorans live in poverty, while the US State Department has warned the country's public debt was \"on an unsustainable path.\"\n\nPresident Nayib Bukele's bitcoin gambit is widely thought to have failed \u00a9 MARVIN RECINOS / AFP\n\nBukele had promoted the move to bitcoin as a way to bring more Salvadorans, most of them lacking bank accounts, into the formal economy -- including through the receipt of remittances from abroad, a major contributor to GDP.\n\nThe change meant that every Salvadoran business -- even neighborhood shopkeepers -- had to accept the cryptocurrency as payment.\n\nBut the IMF and World Bank warned that quite apart from currency volatility, the move could leave the country vulnerable to money laundering and other illicit activity that could in turn affect underlying stability.\n\nDespite his crypto gambit widely seen as a failure -- at least for now -- Bukele remains immensely popular ahead of presidential elections on Sunday.\n\nPolls show his approval ratings hovering around 90 percent, thanks largely to a crackdown on criminal gangs.\n\nHis actions are credited with vastly improving the daily life of crime- and violence-fatigued citizens, but also criticized for human rights violations.\n\nKeegan said people told him he was \"crazy\" when he predicted a decade ago that one day a country would adopt bitcoin as tender.\n\nWhen bitcoiner Corbin Keegan needs money, he rides his rickety motorcycle to the city of Conchagua to draw money from an ATM that disperses bitcoin and dollars \u00a9 Marvin RECINOS / AFP\n\nWhat he did not know at the time was that the country would be El Salvador, and that it would take him to a new life in Central America.\n\nIn Playa Blanca, nobody uses crypto.\n\nWhen Keegan needs money, he rides his rickety motorcycle to the city of Conchagua about 20 kilometers away to draw money from an ATM that disperses bitcoin and dollars.\n\nWhile he waits for the new city to arise, the self-described jack of all trades fishes and does odd jobs for neighbors who fondly call him \"El Gringo.\"\n\nKeegan would not disclose how much he had invested in bitcoin, but remains convinced that crypto is \"the future. It cannot be stopped.\"\n\n\u00a9 2024 AFP"

        "content": "After several days in a row of dominance, it appeared for a time on Tuesday that BlackRock and Fidelity spot bitcoin ETFs might surpass Grayscale's fund in terms of daily volume for the first time since the products began trading more than two weeks ago.\n\nGrayscale's fund, a conversion rather than a brand new product, has shed billions of dollars after starting with more than $25 billion in assets under management. In terms of total trading volume \u2014 buying and selling \u2014 the BlackRock and Fidelity new spot bitcoin ETFs have been ranking second and third behind Grayscale.\n\nAs market close on Tuesday, BlackRock and Fidelity had generated, according to Yahoo Finance data compiled by The Block, $383 million and $288 million in trading volume, respectively. Grayscale ranked first again with $396 million.\n\nAround the midway point on Tuesday, BlackRock and Fidelity both led Grayscale in terms of daily volume.\n\nSince trading began this month, the three issuers have dominated total trading volume, accounting for, at times, about 90% of all buying and selling activity. Other spot bitcoin ETFs like those offered by Invesco and Galaxy, Franklin Templeton and Ark Invest have trailed far behind the top three.\n\nTotal daily trading volume for Tuesday was about $1.2 billion, according to Yahoo Finance data compiled by The Block.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nSo far, Grayscale's ETF has lost more than $5 billion in assets under management, according to Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart. Both BlackRock and Fidelity's products are net positive by more than $2 billion.\n\nTotal spot bitcoin ETF volume nears $27 billion\n\nIn what may be an effort to gain a competitive edge, Invesco and Galaxy Asset Management on Monday announced in a filing that the firms intend to cut their fund's fee from 0.39% to to 0.25%, which will put them on par with most rivals.\n\nTotal trading volume for all of the active spot bitcoin ETFs is nearing $27 billion, also according to Seyffart's post on Tuesday. Many market watchers and crypto enthusiasts have heralded the billions of dollars of money flowing into the new ETFs as a positive development for digital assets."

        "title": "Grayscale \u2018fought the law and won\u2019 to help get Bitcoin ETFs approved. So why did billions of dollars pour out of GBTC? - Fortune",
        "content": "Grayscale\u2019s victory against the Securities and Exchange Commission ushered in a watershed moment for crypto.\n\n\u201cThey fought the law and won,\u201d Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg\u2019s ETF analyst, told Fortune. \u201cYou have to give them credit and tip your hat.\u201d\n\nWhen the SEC repeatedly denied Grayscale\u2019s application to convert its closed-end trust into a spot exchange-traded fund, the asset manager fought back. But since the much anticipated Jan. 11 approval, Grayscale\u2019s trust-turned-fund, GBTC, has seen outflows of over $5.2 billion, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nBy freeing up investors to redeem their shares, it unleashed staggering outflows, leading some analysts to speculate whether Grayscale could be the architect of its own downfall.\n\nUnderstanding the outflows\n\nStarting in 2013 as a closed-end trust fund, GBTC was the only real option to trade Bitcoin on the stock market, for which investors paid a premium. But since February 2021, it has traded at a deep discount, hitting record lows of almost 50% in December 2022. Investors had been locked into the trust, while they watched GBTC\u2019s discount on the underlying asset, Bitcoin, widen, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart told Fortune.\n\nThat was the case until Jan. 11.\n\nExperts told Fortune the outflows so far typically have fallen into three categories: investors wanting to jump ship for lower fees; sales by FTX; and investors who were betting on the SEC approving spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe Bitcoin ETFs are engaged in a fierce race to the bottom on rates, a competition in which Grayscale has no interest.\n\nAt 1.5%, GBTC charges the highest fee among peers, whereas competitors have all kept fees below 0.3%, according to Bloomberg data. Both Seyffart and Balchunas estimate that a third of the outflows belong to investors seeking lower fees, and lightly held GBTC in their IRAs, and thus aren\u2019t subject to capital gains taxes. (This also could mean about a third of outflows have been reinvested into competing ETFs.)\n\nMeanwhile, the analysts also attribute outflows to FTX liquidating its GBTC holdings as part of the firm\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings. FTX has sold 22.28 million shares\u2014worth roughly $1 billion\u2014to eliminate its GBTC position, CoinDesk reported.\n\nThe third category of sellers, Seyffart and Balchunas explained, likely have been typical \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d investors. \u201cThey were using GBTC to bet on a Bitcoin ETF approval,\u201d says Seyffart. \u201cThey were just basically betting on the discount collapsing.\u201d\n\nA Grayscale spokeswoman told Fortune that GBTC will continue to provide investors and capital market allocators with \u201ccredible, confident, and regulated\u201d exposure to Bitcoin, and remains the \u201cbackbone\u201d of the ETF market.\n\n\u2018Playing the waiting game\u2019\n\nBut outflows haven\u2019t yet dislodged Grayscale\u2019s market dominance. With assets of over $21 billion, GBTC still represents the lion\u2019s share of the total Bitcoin ETF value of about $27.2 billion. This leaves the 10 further funds that have joined the so-called Cointucky Derby since the approval trailing. Meanwhile, digital asset manager CoinShares reported on Monday that outflows may be beginning to slow.\n\nDuring the first two weeks of trading, the daily outflow average was approximately $530 million, whereas it has been reducing since Thursday, falling to $191 million on Monday\u2014the lowest since trading began.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, last week was the last with strong outflow,\u201d said Matteo Greco, a crypto analyst at Fineqia. But he also said fresh inflows to GBTC are unlikely. \u201cFor new customers, it\u2019s not really sensible, because they have much, much less-expensive options.\u201d\n\nThe remaining GBTC likely belongs to non-IRA investors who are planning on staying put, analysts said, because redeeming those shares would be a taxable event. The 20% tax on large gains accumulated since the trust\u2019s formation will trump the 1.5% annual fee. \u201cThe math is gonna favor staying,\u201d says Balchunas.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re probably just playing the game of \u2018Let me just wait this thing out\u2019 for two or three years, until that calculation on the spreadsheet at DCG [Digital Currency Group] flips, and they reduce the price,\u201d says Swan CEO Cory Klippsten, hinting at a fee cut in the next few years. \u201cI think a lot of people are just playing the waiting game.\u201d"

        "content": "Tuesday witnessed a modest decline in equities as investors navigated market uncertainties influenced by the anticipation of big tech earnings and cautious signals from Federal Reserve officials.\n\nMeanwhile, cryptocurrencies presented a mixed picture, amidst a week packed with key earnings reports and the looming Federal Reserve decision on interest rates set for Wednesday.\n\nBitcoin bounced modestly Tuesday, hovering around $43,500 after dipping below the $40,000 level late last week. Ether traded sideways Tuesday morning, but both cryptocurrencies were able to maintain their recovery path after a disappointing few weeks.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is now up around 3.3% over the month and ether (ETH) has gained 1% in the same time period. Analysts are growing cautiously optimistic that upcoming tailwinds will propel bitcoin higher.\n\n\u201cWill bitcoin hit a $20,000 bottom this year, as some analysts and \u2014 notably \u2014 Deutsche Bank\u2019s recent survey predicts? I would say unlikely,\u201d Lucas Kiely, chief investment officer of digital wealth platform Yield App, said. \u201cThe big story this year is about crypto maturing into a stable market that combines the benefits of DeFi with best practice from [traditional finance].\u201d\n\nRead more: SEC officially approves spot bitcoin ETFs in landmark decision\n\nThe latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) data, released after the open Tuesday, showed there were an estimated 9.026 million job openings in December, a slight increase from November and higher than analysts had anticipated.\n\nAfter clocking record highs on Monday, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped at the open on Tuesday, losing 0.1% each. The Nasdaq Composite also dipped, falling 0.4% in the first hour of trading.\n\nMonday\u2019s equity rally, analysts say, is largely thanks to a late-afternoon Treasury announcement that quarterly borrowing estimate by roughly $56 billion.\n\n\u201cWe know that was the key positive catalyst because stocks accelerated the rally during the final hour and sectors that benefit most from falling yields (small caps and tech) outperformed,\u201d Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, said. \u201cSpecifically, the Treasury only needs to borrow $760 billion in Q1 compared to the previously estimated $816 billion.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee will wrap its two-day policy-setting meeting Wednesday and futures markets Tuesday morning showed there is an overwhelming expectation that rates will stay where they are. Future market moves will depend on Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s comments and the statement from the Committee, Essaye said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s virtually zero chance of a rate cut at tomorrow\u2019s meeting,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat will make this meeting hawkish or dovish (and push stocks lower or extend the rally) will be whether the Fed hints that rate cuts are coming soon.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Outflows can coincide with rising prices.\u201d\n\nThe rotation of funds from GBTC to newly issued ETFs raises questions about the nature of these inflows, whether they represent fresh capital entering the market or merely a shift between investment products, Kaiko said.\n\nA clearer picture is expected to form in the coming months as the funds mature, and as market makers show signs of entering.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin is up 3.09% in the last 24 hours, trading at $43,503.\n\nEthereum is up 2% in the same period, at $2,311.\n\nAvalanche and Solana are down 6.1% and 8.8%, respectively.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nSebastian Sinclair is a markets correspondent for DL News.

A more developed options market can yield lower volatility because it allows investors to express a broader range of investment strategies and make the most liquid ETFs even more liquid. It also expands the importance of events such as expirations and dealer positioning as price action drivers."

        "title": "Investors Are Pouring Billions Into These 2 Bitcoin ETFs and Leaving the Rest Behind - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 new spot Bitcoin (BTC -4.97%) ETFs earlier this month; two stand out as clear winners among the group.\n\nThe iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT -5.82%) from Blackrock (BLK -2.08%) was the first to reach $1 billion in assets under management less than one week after its launch. The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC -5.85%) followed close behind, reaching the milestone the next day. Two weeks into the start of trading of this new breed of Bitcoin ETFs, the two leaders account for about 70% of all inflows.\n\nIn other words, the market is showing a clear preference for the Bitcoin ETFs from Blackrock and Fidelity over the competition. Should you follow the wisdom of the crowd, or are there better options?\n\nWhy size matters in Bitcoin ETFs\n\nNeither Blackrock nor Fidelity offer the lowest fees among the new Bitcoin ETFs. That title belongs to the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (NYSEMKT: BITB), which charges just 0.20% of assets under management. It's also waiving the fee for the first six months up to $1 billion in assets. But Blackrock and Fidelity are not too far behind, with expense ratios of 0.25% each. Both issuers are also offering generous fee waivers.\n\nImportantly, scale can play an important role in driving down costs for shareholders. Issuers can leverage certain operational expenses for an ETF, such as marketing spend. Additionally, bigger funds may be able to negotiate lower custodial fees for their Bitcoin holdings. (In the case of Fidelity, its crypto arm is handling the custody of the trust's holdings, so it has a lot of room to lower fees.) As a result, the biggest ETF issuers are often very competitive on price. Over time, both Blackrock and Fidelity may offer lower fees than the competition for their respective Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBut size matters for another reason as well. More funds flowing into (and out of) an ETF means the shares are more liquid. That provides investors with tighter bid-ask spreads and helps the ETF price track the net asset value of the fund's holdings. Even if you're not an active trader, the ability to buy an ETF that tracks the actual underlying assets very closely can ensure you're not paying an unnecessary premium to invest in Bitcoin.\n\nShould you follow the crowd?\n\nIf I were to invest in a Bitcoin ETF, it would either be the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund or the iShares Bitcoin Trust. Not only do the two issuers have the factors of scale working in their favor, but they also have long track records of providing low-cost ETFs and mutual funds for traditional asset classes, like stocks, bonds, and real estate investment trusts.\n\nThe ETFs are particularly interesting for anyone looking to add Bitcoin exposure to a retirement account, such as an IRA. While it's possible to invest directly in cryptocurrency with a self-directed IRA, those plans are expensive and the process of opening an account can be cumbersome. The simplicity of an ETF that tracks Bitcoin is a great option for those investors, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy either the Blackrock or Fidelity fund in that situation.\n\nBut for those investing in a regular brokerage account, they might consider a direct investment in Bitcoin itself. Holding Bitcoin instead of an ETF has several advantages. For one, you can transfer it to a wallet you control and use it for purchases. Second, you won't pay any fees just for holding Bitcoin.\n\nThat said, there are costs to purchase and sell Bitcoin. And those costs can be substantial on certain cryptocurrency exchanges. If you want a small amount of Bitcoin or will be buying a small amount at a time, you may end up paying less in fees with an ETF, despite the expense ratio.\n\nBuying the actual cryptocurrency itself will be a great option for some, but many will be better off with an ETF. And if you're going to buy a Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust or Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund are the most appealing options."

        "content": "Regardless of any short-term pullback, Bitcoin will spend this year further cementing its reputation as digital gold. Indeed, just as it did in March 2023 during a narrowly avoided banking crisis, BTC will likely hold up in ways many traditional assets \u2014 perhaps even gold \u2014 fail to.\n\nIt is true that the grand institutional entry into Bitcoin has not lit up the markets as some might have hoped, and it probably won\u2019t for a while yet. Much of this event was already baked into prices and there are few investors that saw the SEC's reluctant capitulation as any kind of ringing endorsement of cryptocurrency.\n\nRelated: An Ethereum ETF is coming sooner than you expect\n\nNonetheless, BlackRock's ETF has already hoovered up $2 billion in assets as others follow fast in the rear, providing a level of support never before seen for the world\u2019s biggest digital currency. The day is soon coming, infact, that we all reminisce about the good old days of BTC volatility.\n\nIn the meantime, though, we will almost certainly see a pullback in the face of global economic pressures. Chief among these is the resurgence of inflation in the US, which has dashed hopes for a rate cut before Q2, and which will likely continue to be exacerbated by rising tensions in the Middle East and an ongoing war in Europe.\n\nOn top of this, we have the end of the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) coming up on March 11. The saving grace of U.S. banks during last year\u2019s almost-crisis, this may well reveal some further shaky foundations that could again spook markets into a significant sell-off.\n\nEven more significant than all this, though, we have a growing global sovereign debt pile. Now standing at $91 trillion, this stone around the neck of global economies is continuing to put pressure on fiat currencies and bond markets all over the world, with the IMF increasingly citing concerns about public debt sustainability.\n\nGlobal debt trend. Source: International Monetary Fund\n\nWhile Bitcoin may initially wobble with global markets in the face of these pressures, though, as a finite resource that is transparent, immutable and decentralized, its long-term concept value will continue to grow and this will support prices in the medium to long term. In-fact this year we could truly see Bitcoin become a North Star for the global economy \u2014 if not in exactly the way the Bitcoin maxis had hoped.\n\nUltimately, however, we are unlikely to see any major Black Swan economic events this year. Not only are we facing a presidential election in the U.S., but several others across the world \u2014 with seven out of 10 of the world\u2019s most populous nations (equating to around half the global population) hitting the polls over the next 10 months.\n\nRelated: 3 bull market narratives for 2024 that you haven\u2019t heard about yet\n\nAs such, while there isn\u2019t the economic wriggle room to offer the rate cuts and huge spending sprees that many politicians might like, we can bank on policymakers pulling out all the stops to avert any kind of crisis \u2014 especially in the banking sector. In the U.S., we will see some new packages to support banks while the real estate market will also likely win some attention.\n\nAs such, we won\u2019t see Bitcoin \u2014 or indeed any market \u2014 staying down for very long this year. Rather, after an initial pullback on global economic concerns and some reserved trading around sustained interest rates, we will \u2014 in my personal opinion \u2014 see BTC rebound and surpass $50,000 in the second quarter before taking off into the oncoming bull market.\n\nPrices and sentiment have been subdued for too long and risk appetite has returned to crypto, if not global markets at large. And if all those politicians want to win any votes, they will need to make sure that it stays that way.\n\nStefan Rust is the CEO of Truflation.com, which tracks real-time data across networks, markets, and feeds to provide financial and economic data on-chain.

        "content": "German law enforcement seized 50,000 bitcoins, valued at approximately $2.1 billion, allegedly earned through the operation of an illegal movie streaming website. With the price of bitcoin reaching $43,500 on Tuesday, this could be the largest ever crypto seizure by German authorities, Saxony prosecutors said.\n\nOne of the suspects voluntarily transferred the bitcoin to the wallet of the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) \u201cto make up for the damage.\u201d The money will remain in the BKA\u2019s crypto account until a court determines how it will be used, prosecutors said.\n\nThe police did not disclose the name of the website in their latest press release, but it was identified during a 2020 investigation as Movie2k, \u201cthe most popular German streaming platform for pirated movies.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2008, Movie2k distributed over 880,000 copies of pirated films. It was among the most-visited websites in Germany at that time. Its administrators earned money through advertising fees and subscriptions.\n\nThe police suspect that a 40-year-old German citizen and a 37-year-old Polish citizen acquired the bitcoin with revenues from the website until it was shut down in 2013.\n\nOne of the Movie2k operators, who cooperated with the police and agreed to transfer his crypto, is a programmer and real estate entrepreneur from Berlin. He has been in custody since November 2019, suspected of commercial money laundering. In 2020, the whereabouts of the second operator are unknown.\n\nThe ongoing investigation, supported by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), focuses on the illegal sharing of copyrighted work and money laundering.\n\n\u201cAll further information will be provided once the investigation is completed,\u201d the police said. According to Patrick Pintaske, the spokesman for the public prosecutor's office in Dresden, as of yet no charges have been brought against the suspects.\n\nCryptocurrency is often used by criminals to store and transfer substantial sums of money stolen from victims. Currently, the U.S. government stands as one of the world's largest holders of crypto assets seized from cybercriminals and darknet markets, having confiscated almost 200,000 bitcoins, valued at more than $8 billion, since 2020."

With her fortune, she bought a million-dollar house in her home state of Maryland, a million-dollar condo in Dubai, a BMW, and some designer handbags.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it all came crashing down, and on Monday (Jan. 29), Chunga pled guilty to fraud in a federal court in Maryland.

        "title": "Bitcoin ETFs in 401(k)s a useful diversifier, proponents say - InvestmentNews",
        "content": "The SEC\u2019s approval of spot-price bitcoin ETFs means that the digital asset finally has an entry point into 401(k) plans \u2013 but don\u2019t count on it appearing on investment menus anytime soon.\n\nInstead, retirement investors will most likely be able to access bitcoin ETFs through 401(k) plans\u2019 brokerage windows and, eventually, through asset allocation products like target-date funds. Given the extreme volatility of bitcoin and the range of opinions about its future, only a small proportion of a portfolio should be devoted to it, proponents say.\n\n\u201cBecause these are ordinary ETFs, they are immediately available in self-directed accounts,\u201d said Ric Edelman, founder of Edelman Financial Engines. For people who are active investors or traders in 401(k) plans, that access is meaningful \u2013 but those who are in default investment options or choose funds from the plan menu might not get bitcoin exposure for a while.\n\nThere are a couple of reasons for that. Because the ETFs are new, they haven\u2019t been incorporated into any target-date products that would seek to add them. Additionally, 401(k) plan sponsors are widely risk-averse when it comes to making changes, including adding what is essentially a new asset class. Guidance in 2022 from the Department of Labor also tempered expectations, as the regulator urged fiduciaries to \u201cexercise extreme care\u201d when considering the addition of bitcoin to their plans.\n\nFurther, ETFs are few and far between in 401(k) plans, in part because record-keeping systems weren\u2019t designed around intraday trading.\n\nPOTENTIAL BENEFITS\n\nAllocating 1 percent to 5 percent of assets to bitcoin can have advantages, as that range is small enough to protect investors from harm if the digital asset fails, but the potential for outsize price appreciation could have a materially positive effect on portfolios, said Edelman, who\u2019s co-founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals.\n\n\u201cThis is the best of both worlds \u2013 it reduces risk in the portfolio but improves returns,\u201d he said.\n\nThe lack of correlation to stocks and bonds also makes bitcoin advantageous as a diversifier, said Mike Alfred, who runs hedge fund Alpine Fox, which focuses on bitcoin and bitcoin-related equities. Alfred also co-founded retirement plan ratings firm BrightScope, as well as fintech Digital Assets Data.\n\n\u201cFrom a mathematical standpoint, it\u2019s kind of foolish not to include it in 401(k) plans,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just another asset class. It\u2019s not different from emerging markets, gold, or other commodities. Once the gatekeepers understand the asset class, it invariably ends up in these plans.\u201d\n\nFamed Yale chief investment officer David Swensen, who died in 2021, began incorporating bitcoin into the university\u2019s endowment in 2018 through investments in venture funds. Swensen\u2019s \u201cYale model\u201d of investing, developed along with Dean Takahashi, for many years delivered strong returns by focusing on alternative asset classes rather than traditional stocks and bonds, Alfred noted.\n\nThe best manifestation within 401(k)s, at least in the near future, would be inclusion of bitcoin ETFs within asset allocation funds that are used as the defaults, he said.\n\n\u201cPeople need to understand that this is coming,\u201d Alfred said.\n\nIt\u2019s also evident that people want bitcoin, said Edelman, who projects that $150 billion will flow into bitcoin ETFs within three years, with the price of bitcoin reaching $150,000.\n\n\u201cEmployers who respond to those workers\u2019 demands will improve employee morale by demonstrating their responsiveness to this new opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an opportunity for forward-thinking advisors and employers.\u201d\n\nOf course, changes in the 401(k) world are slow to happen, and the consultants who help shape investment menus may not see incentives to add bitcoin soon, Edelman noted.\n\nThe fact that the digital asset is available in an ETF format helps address the concerns the DOL has cited with bitcoin, but the regulator\u2019s stance will nonetheless be slow to soften, he said.\n\nCurrently, there are means of accessing bitcoin through 401(k)s, including through Fidelity\u2019s Digital Assets Account, which has not caught on quickly, Edelman said. But the fact that Fidelity is among those with a spot bitcoin ETF is significant, given that it is one of the biggest retirement plan providers.\n\n\u201cThis will make it very easy for millions of 401(k) plans to make this ETF available,\u201d Edelman said.\n\nMeanwhile, the biggest 401(k) provider, Vanguard, has indicated that it is not planning to offer access to spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\u201cVanguard is getting a lot of criticism \u2013 and deservedly so \u2013 for denying millions of investors from making their own investment choices,\u201d Edelman said.\n\nALL THE HYPE\n\nSince the SEC begrudgingly approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs on January 10, nearly $2 billion flowed into the products in the first three days of trading, according to figures from Reuters.\n\nMike Harris, associate professor of retirement studies at the College for Financial Planning, said the excitement reminds him of the tech bubble or the housing market in 2007. In cases with such intense investor interest, there is a risk that valuations are already at a high point, he said.\n\n\u201cI would be astounded if a 401(k) investment committee would say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ll let people invest in the bitcoin ETF.\u2019 Their liability on that would be pretty huge,\u201d Harris said. That said, small holdings within an asset allocation product could be more reasonable, he said.\n\nIn individual retirement accounts, people should limit their bitcoin exposure, particularly if they are in or near retirement, he noted.\n\nIt\u2019s helpful to keep in mind that if people see significant investment losses, the returns needed to make up for those in future years are higher, Harris said. \u201cThis is like dynamite \u2013 which is really helpful if you\u2019re digging a hole.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin is in the midst of a civil war over NFTs\u2014but one side is clearly winning - Fortune",
        "content": "Bitcoin zealots fighting on social media are about as rare as the torrent of Taylor Swift-Super Bowl stories we\u2019re fated to endure for the next 12 days, so I typically ignore them. But one long-running feud has caught my attention because tribes of Bitcoin warriors are not attacking other blockchains, which is their usual thing, but instead are going after each other. So I figured it was finally time to figure out what the fuss was about.\n\nThe beef in question is over a new thing called Ordinals, which arrived last year following an update to Bitcoin\u2019s core code. The invention is a clever one and involves ascribing a number to each satoshi (0.00000001 of a Bitcoin) that is minted on every new Bitcoin block, thereby creating a new type of record system on the world\u2019s preeminent blockchain.\n\nThis new numbering system also provided an opportunity to inscribe media on each Ordinal, meaning Bitcoin has a new use case in addition to its original one as a financial ledger. And so Bitcoin\u2019s version of the NFT was born. The Ordinal regime can be used to inscribe any piece of text or small image (here\u2019s an example), and so the most popular applications have become compilations of great artworks and passages from the Constitution to inspire others. Just kidding. This is crypto, so people are rushing to inscribe images of wizards and cats and god knows what else in hopes of flipping them for a profit.\n\nThe flood of Bitcoin NFTS\u2014there are already millions of them\u2014seems harmless but has infuriated segments of the Bitcoin old guard, who dislike the idea of using the blockchain for anything but financial transactions, and who are irked that a wave of digital crap has led to higher transaction fees. \u201cAnother civil war is brewing between a laser-eyes faction who thinks money is the only use case, and another faction that wants NFTs and to open up more uses cases,\u201d explains Hong Kim, a cofounder of the Bitcoin-focused firm Bitwise.\n\nI spoke to Kim to get an honest broker\u2019s take on what the Bitcoin feud is all about and who is likely to prevail. He says the laser-eyed purists have a point because Ordinals have caused Bitcoin transaction costs to spike at times. This has led to proposed countermeasures, including a Jack Dorsey-backed mining pool that warned it would refuse to process Bitcoin blocks containing Ordinals.\n\nKim added, though, that he and others might not be especially fond of \u201cpeople degen-ing with Ordinals,\u201d but that very few support the idea of censoring transactions based on their content. He also says that, like them or not, Ordinals are here to stay. A big reason for this is that, unlike the bitter block-size wars of 2015\u2014when Bitcoin was in a full-blown schism over whether to increase blocks by two or even eight times\u2014the blockchain\u2019s influential core developers are willing to put up with Ordinals. Some even like the idea of opening Bitcoin up to new use cases.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean the current feud is over, especially as so many Bitcoiners can\u2019t seem to get through the day without beefing with someone on X. In the longer term, though, Ordinals will likely come to be seen as one of the most interesting things to happen to Bitcoin in years.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nFranklin Templeton removed \"Laser Eyes Ben Franklin\" as its social media avatar, saying the profile pic was always intended to be temporary for its Bitcoin ETF launch.

        "title": "Bitcoin mining boom could be disaster for green energy, warns expert - Recharge",
        "content": "A recent breakthrough moment for Bitcoin marks the start of a new era for the cryptocurrency, but analyst Ben Hertz-Shargel warns that its staggering energy demands risk destabilising power grids and wiping out green energy gains.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission this month approved the first US-listed exchange traded funds to track Bitcoin, making it much easier to trade and opening the door to a whole new class of prospective investors.\n\nThis is all very exciting for Bitcoin enthusiasts, says Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid edge at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, but it comes with a problem: the news will likely spark a boom in the staggeringly energy-intensive mining process that underlies the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin requires so much energy because the decentralised blockchain structure it uses employs a system where to verify transactions computers must guess at a 64-digit string of numbers and letters, with trillions of possible options. Computers all over the world race to guess the string and the fastest not only certifies the transaction but is also rewarded in Bitcoin \u2013 hence, \u2018mining\u2019 it.\n\nFor context, cryptocurrency mining, which Bitcoin represents the vast majority of, used a fifth as much electricity in 2022 as global centralised data computing and data transmission combined.\n\n\u201cThat is stunning,\u201d said Hertz-Shargel, as it means that cryptocurrency mining is using a fifth of \u201call of the fruits of the internet revolution, industrial revolution, the cloud and AI industrial revolution.\u201d\n\nArticle continues below the advert\n\nPut another way, \u201cit is consuming at a level that is on par with everything else that has come out of modern technology,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that is to me a completely incommensurate cost.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Hertz-Shargel said that Bitcoin mining now uses up to 75% more electricity than it did back then.\n\nOne of the most recent estimates is that Bitcoin mining uses around 127TWh of electricity annually \u2013 around the same as Norway.\n\nMuch like tech giants, Bitcoin miners often develop their own data centres to run their operations, and many have flooded to Texas to set up facilities due to the US state's abundant wind and solar farms.\n\nHowever, Hertz-Shargel said that while Bitcoin miners often site their operations next to renewables facilities \u2013 claiming they are \u2018sustainable\u2019 as a result \u2013 this is very different to data centres run by Big Tech companies that run off renewables.\n\nThe \u201ccritical difference\u201d is that Big Tech companies such as Amazon and Microsoft sign power purchase agreements with renewables developers, prompting new wind and solar farms to get built.\n\n\u201cNo Bitcoin mines are doing that,\u201d he said.\n\n'Chequered past'\n\nPart of the problem is that the modern Bitcoin mining industry has been around for less time than the duration of many green power offtake agreements, he said.\n\nCombine that with the volatile price of cryptocurrency and the \u201cchequered past\u201d of many Bitcoin miners and Hertz-Shargel said it is \u201cvery doubtful\u201d that renewables developers will want to get into bed with the industry as a partner.\n\nInstead, Bitcoin data centres are syphoning off green energy that could be used elsewhere, he said. \u201cThe direct effect is causing high cost, high emissions generators to be run much more often.\u201d\n\nHertz-Shargel said that, despite popular belief that Bitcoin miners stop operations at periods of peak demand, many run almost constantly, and are at times pushing the grid \u201ccloser to a brownout.\u201d\n\nIn a global context, this could mean that the boom in the rollout of renewables risks being in some part cancelled out by a parallel boom in the energy demands of Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThe energy transition is all about tradeoffs,\u201d said Hertz-Shargel \u201cWe have a finite grid, a finite amount of clean energy that we can deploy in a realistic period of time.\u201d The question \u201cyou have to ask yourself\u201d is therefore \u201cwhat can we afford to power via the grid?\u201d"

        "content": "Portal has raised a new $34 million funding round to build a decentralized exchange for trading bitcoins with assets on other blockchains. Why it matters: Centralized exchanges, like FTX and Binance, have been a liability for an industry created to undermine financial intermediaries. The better the DeFi variety gets, the less their centralized cousins will be needed.\n\nContext: A decentralized exchange, known as a DEX, operates on code alone, autonomously, without the need of a human intermediary.\n\nIf everyone who built such an exchange were to quit and walk away, it would continue to operate. In this way it's no more a third-party than a road or flightpath.\n\nThe issue, however, is that blockchains have a hard time dealing with data that lives on other blockchains. And cryptoassets \u2014 which are just data \u2014 exist on a number of different ones.\n\nTrading between blockchains is both tricky and risky. The best known DEXs, such as Uniswap or Pangolin, operate on one blockchain, allowing users to trade tokens that run on that chain.\n\nZoom out: Portal \u2014 whose backers include Coinbase Ventures, Arrington Capital, OKX Ventures and Gate.io \u2014 aims to improve the experience of making trades between assets regardless of where they run.\n\nWhat they're saying: \"Bridges, centralized exchanges and other custodial solutions that enable cross-chain exchange have been vulnerable and insecure for as long as they have existed,\" Portal CEO Chandra Duggirala said in a statement.\n\nReality check: It's a crowded field. Thorchain, Stargate, Wormhole and others are all taking on the use case.\n\nYes, but: No project has truly nailed it yet. Solutions to bridge assets across chains have been hit with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of losses from code exploits.\n\nBetween the lines: To secure its transactions between chains, Portal touts its use of so-called atomic swaps \u2014 a cryptographic method that uses a predetermined code to allow two people to make a trade.\n\nWhat we're watching: The fact that Portal is leading with functionality for the Bitcoin blockchain. The oldest cryptocurrency has mostly been an afterthought for most of these projects."

        "content": "While the daily net flows entering BlackRock\u2019s spot bitcoin ETF have repeatedly beat competing offerings, Fidelity Investments\u2019 BTC fund remains on its tail in a battle analysts expect to persist.\n\nThe Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) edged BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) in net flows on Monday \u2014 $208 million to $198 million \u2014 according to Bloomberg Intelligence data.\n\nOverall, the two financial giants are neck and neck atop the flows leaderboard since launching alongside eight other spot bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 11.\n\nIBIT and the FBTC have so far seen flows amounting to about $2.4 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin ETF Tracker\n\nThe companies benefit from their large and well-established distribution networks, analysts told Blockworks \u2014 particularly when it comes to the financial adviser channel.\n\nBlackRock manages about $9 trillion in assets, including about $2.6 trillion in its US ETFs. Though not as large of an asset manager, Fidelity had $11.5 trillion assets under administration, as of Sept. 30.\n\nSumit Roy, a senior analyst at ETF.com, said while he expects both firms\u2019 funds to grow substantially over time, it\u2019s \u201cimpossible\u201d to predict which will be larger.\n\n\u201cFidelity\u2019s advantage is that it has a massive base of retail and adviser clients using its brokerage services, so it can easily push the ETF to them,\u201d he told Blockworks. \u201cOn the other hand, BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world, with plenty of marketing and distribution muscle of its own.\u201d\n\nRoy added: \u201cIt really is a heavyweight fight that can go either way.\u201d\n\nA Fidelity spokesperson declined to comment on how it could seek to boost assets in FBTC. A BlackRock representative did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nCoinShares product head Townsend Lansing noted that exchange-traded products are access tools for traditional investors, many of whom place a lot of value in brand names.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that more crypto native [firms] won\u2019t have opportunities to show value or earn flows as investors demand and reward more bespoke and informed insight into digital assets,\u201d Lansing added.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nA fund by Ark Invest and 21Shares, as well as one by crypto-focused firm Bitwise, sit in third and fourth place with about $600 million of net inflows each.\n\nWhile Grayscale Investments\u2019 Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) started with a big asset lead of roughly $28 billion, its net outflows have totaled more than $5 billion in its first few weeks trading as an ETF.\n\nRead more: As GBTC outflows continue, will the largest bitcoin ETF be dethroned?\n\nSome have compared spot bitcoin ETFs to the launch of physically-backed gold ETFs.\n\nBut David Lawant, head of research at crypto prime brokerage FalconX, noted the more competitive landscape this time around, with 10 spot bitcoin ETFs launching on the same day.\n\nContrarily, while State Street Global Advisors\u2019 SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) came to market in November 2004, BlackRock\u2019s Gold Trust (IAU) didn\u2019t launch until January 2005. GLD has roughly $55.5 billion in assets, while IAU manages about $25.7 billion.\n\n\u201cGiven the differences in the competitive dynamics on the spot [bitcoin] ETF launch versus the gold ETFs launched almost two decades ago, I\u2019d not be surprised to see a group of three to five funds gathering the lion\u2019s share of assets, perhaps with the top three more distant from the rest of the group,\u201d Lawant said.\n\nThe FalconX research executive said predicting the ultimate spot bitcoin ETF asset leader is tough at this stage.\n\n\u201cThe primary winner in this race is the consumer, who ultimately gets products that offer access to crypto at a highly competitive cost,\u201d he said. \u201cThe speed at which the fees got to where they are now suggests that both firms are dead serious about establishing their presence in crypto.\u201d\n\nExcluding GBTC, which sports a fee of 1.5%, the nine other US spot bitcoin ETFs have expense ratios ranging between 0.19% and 0.30%.\n\nA product by Invesco and Galaxy was the latest to adjust its fee, reducing its price Monday from 0.39% to 0.25% \u2014 matching BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Portal, a startup building a Bitcoin BTC -6.86% -based cross-chain decentralized exchange and wallet, has raised $34 million in a seed funding round. Investors in the round included Coinbase Ventures, Arrington Capital, OKX Ventures, and Gate.io, Portal said Tuesday.\n\nThe seed round was structured as a combination of a simple agreement for future equity (SAFE) and convertible notes, all of which have been fully converted into equity, Portal co-founder and CEO Chandra Duggirala told The Block in an interview. There is no debt component in the round, Duggirala noted, declining to comment on valuation. He also declined to comment on the specific timeline for when the funding round started and ended but said it \"closed recently.\"\n\nAt $34 million, Portal's seed round surpasses the typical size for a seed round. Duggirala said it was oversubscribed by more than two times due to increased interest in the growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nThe seed round brings Portal's total funding to $42.5 million, adding to the $8.5 million raised in pre-seed funding in 2021.\n\nWhat is Portal?\n\nPortal is a Bitcoin-based cross-chain atomic swaps protocol. Its two main products are a decentralized exchange and a wallet.\n\nPortal DEX enables Layer 2 atomic swaps of cryptocurrencies across blockchains. Portal wallet, a \"fully non-custodial\" tool, integrates the DEX and allows users to send, receive, and store cryptocurrencies across blockchains.\n\n\"You can think of Portal as a cross-chain Lightning Network,\" Duggirala said. \"It's fast, inexpensive, easy, and there is no custodial risk.\"\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nThe current cross-chain swap tools, such as wrapped tokens and bridges, are risky as they have lost billions of dollars in hacks and involve some type of custody risk, Duggirala said, adding that Portal doesn't custody user funds at all, either through one signature or multiple signatures.\n\nPortal products are currently in the testnet form, and \"mainnet readiness is quite feasible by March,\" Duggirala said.\n\nPortal plans and token\n\nWith fresh funding in place, Portal plans to launch its products on the mainnet and grow its ecosystem. \"We want to support and integrate with as many wallets and single-chain decentralized exchanges that use bridges,\" Duggirala said. \"Our goal is to replace completely the custodial risk in this space.\"\n\nAsked if Portal plans to launch its own native token, Duggirala said that decision would depend on the validators of the Portal network. The network runs on the xport (proposed ticker) token, an ERC-20 token, Duggirala said, adding that it is used to secure the network and reward validators for enabling the swaps.\n\nFounded in 2019, Portal is based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Duggirala declined to comment on the current headcount of the firm but said the team has doubled in the last year, and Portal is continuing to hire.\n\nIn the coming months, Portal also plans to launch an AI-powered investment application that will help users leverage the AI technology to make \"intelligent\" investing decisions, Duggirala said."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Cryptocurrencies myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police seized more than \u00a31.4bn worth of bitcoin derived from a huge investment fraud in China, a London court heard on Tuesday, one of the largest seizures of the cryptocurrency by law enforcement globally.\n\nThe disclosure came during the trial of Jian Wen, 42, who is accused of laundering bitcoin on behalf of her former employer, an alleged fugitive from the Beijing authorities. Wen has pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn 2018 the UK police seized four separate devices containing more than 61,000 bitcoin from a safety deposit box and a property where Wen and her then-employer, Yadi Zhang, lived at the time, Southwark Crown Court heard.\n\nThe value of the bitcoin by the time all of the cryptocurrency had been recovered by the police, in July 2021, added up to about \u00a31.4bn.\n\nThe prosecution told the jury at the start of the trial on Monday that the bitcoin derived from an investment fraud Zhang had committed in China between 2014 and 2017.\n\nZhang, whose real name is Zhimin Qian, stole roughly \u00a35bn from more than 128,000 investors. She then converted the money into bitcoin and arrived, under a false identity, in London in 2017, the court heard.\n\nShe has since fled the UK and remains at large, according to prosecutors.\n\nWen is not accused of any involvement in that fraud. However, she has been accused of helping to convert some of Zhang\u2019s bitcoin into cash, jewellery and other luxury items, as well as property, while allegedly knowing it was the proceeds of crime.\n\nGillian Jones KC, counsel for the Crown Prosecution Service, told the jury on Tuesday that Wen had tried to purchase a \u00a312.5mn London property on behalf of Zhang in 2018 using the law firm Mishcon de Reya. The purchase had failed because the law firm could not verify the source of the bitcoin, the jury heard. In October that year, the Met froze money held by Mishcon in its client account.\n\nWen had moved to the UK in 2007 from China and became a British citizen in 2018. She has described herself as Zhang\u2019s \u201ccarer\u201d and said she believed all of Zhang\u2019s bitcoin had derived from legitimate business activities, Jones told the jury.\n\nBut Jones said on Monday that Wen was a \u201cfront person\u201d who was paid to \u201ckeep Ms Zhang in the background\u201d.\n\n\u201cMs Wen had been trusted not only with copies of the passwords and passphrases to access the laptops [containing the bitcoin] but with access to where the laptops were being stored,\u201d Jones said.\n\nBefore meeting Zhang in 2017, Wen had worked in Chinese takeaway restaurants, the court heard.\n\nThe trial continues."

Back in 2021, Global X pursued a similar fund but was met with resistance from the SEC.\n\nGlobal X first filed its proposal back in August, but \u2014 like other applicants \u2014 a decision on the bitcoin ETF was delayed by the SEC. In January, the SEC issued a slew of ETF decisions but Global X was notably absent.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin ETF Tracker\n\nGlobal X didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment.\n\nThe firm wasn\u2019t on the final list of potential ETFs earlier this month after it failed to file updated documentation alongside other potential ETF issuers.\n\nGlobal X wasn\u2019t the only one of the bitcoin ETF hopefuls that failed to make it across the finish line.

On Monday, Invesco Galaxy \u2014 which offers a six-month or $5 billion in assets waiver \u2014 announced that it was cutting its fee to 0.25% from 0.39%.\n\nAside from Grayscale \u2014 which has a 1.5% fee \u2014 the group has very low fees ranging from 0.19% to 0.30%.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Fintech provider Portal today announced it\u2019s received $34 million in seed funding to further development of a decentralized Bitcoin ecosystem that will enable peer-to-peer, cross-chain swaps of digital assets.\n\n\u201cPortal intends to solve the problem of custodial risk once and for all,\u201d cofounder and CEO Chandra Duggirala said in a statement.\n\nInvestors include Coinbase Ventures, Arrington Capital, OKX Ventures, and Gate.io, and the seed funding builds on Portal\u2019s angel round of $8.5 million, which closed in 2021.\n\n\u201cPortal is rapidly pushing ahead the Bitcoin ecosystem by enabling fast and low-cost economic activity without being beholden to third parties,\u201d Michael Arrington, founder and partner of Arrington Capital, said in a statement.\n\nFounded in San Francisco in 2019, Portal enables customers to make safe cross-chain transactions without relying on third parties such as exchanges, bridges, or wrappers, which pose additional risks.\n\n\u201cFrom the very early days of Mt. Gox to FTX, centralized exchanges have been a persistent source of risk to user funds,\u201d said Duggirala. \u201cNow, the risk remains, but it has taken a new form in bridges and other custodial cross-chain solutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cCustodial bridges have been the single-biggest problem in crypto, and it becomes particularly important when it comes to cross-chain operations because different blockchains are completely disparate things,\u201d Duggirala told Fortune. Bridges are touch points that allow transfers of tokens between blockchains, but they can be extremely vulnerable to hackers\u2014a single cross-chain exploit in 2022 drained some $625 million.\n\nWrapping is another solution users have opted for to make cross-chain transactions, whereby tokens are backed by a coin or asset, native to a different blockchain, to make them usable on a different network. But wrapped tokens rely on custodians to hold the original assets, which raises questions about centralization and counterparty risk.\n\n\u201cSo, how do you bind two completely independent systems together, the only reliable way?\u201d Duggirala asked. He says it can be done using transparent layer-2 atomic-swap technology. Layer-2 refers to protocols that operate atop a layer-1 blockchain\u2014like Bitcoin or Ethereum\u2014to improve scalability. Atomic swaps are exchange contracts that allow cryptocurrencies to be traded peer-to-peer without requiring a trusted third party.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been done before; as far as we know, this is the first of its kind,\u201d Duggirala said.\n\nPortal plans to use the funds to invest in engineering and building the ecosystem of two of its flagship products: Portal DEX and Portal Wallet. The former is the first Bitcoin-based exchange that allows swaps of cryptocurrencies across blockchains, and the latter is the non-custodial, user-facing tool that integrates Portal DEX.\n\n\u201cThe portable mobile wallet serves as basically like a standard for the user experience,\u201d Duggirala said, \u201cbut we want as many third-party wallets to integrate the swap as quickly as possible.\u201d"

        "title": "Is the Bitcoin Power Law model more realistic than Stock-to-Flow? - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Since finance YouTuber Andrei Jikh recently covered the so-called Bitcoin Power Model, there has been a notable debate within the Bitcoin community around its viability.\n\nJikh opened his video entitled \u201c2024 Bitcoin Price Prediction (CRAZY!)\u201d by stating,\n\n\u201cToday I want to show how a simple math rule that\u2019s able to predict patterns of the universe has also accurately tracked the last 15 years of Bitcoin\u2019s price, and I want to show you what this formula says Bitcoin should be worth 10 years from now.\u201d\n\nHe mentions a \u2018rule\u2019 based on a model that describes Bitcoin\u2019s price growth as following a power law principle over time. The model is based on the work of astrophysicist Giovanni Santostasi, who has analyzed 15 years of Bitcoin data.\n\nA power law is a statistical relationship between two quantities, where a relative change in one quantity results in a proportional relative change in the other, independent of the initial size of those quantities. This means that one quantity varies as a power of another. For example, if you double the length of a side of a square, the area will quadruple, demonstrating a power law relationship.\n\nJikh discusses how power laws have been used to predict various phenomena, including Bitcoin\u2019s price patterns. The video suggests that Bitcoin\u2019s price could potentially reach $200,000 in the next cycle and $1 million by 2033.\n\nThe significance of power laws in this context is that they allegedly allow for accurate predictions across different domains. In the case of Bitcoin, Santostasi claims they explain its price patterns with a high degree of accuracy, as indicated by a 95.3% accuracy based on regression analysis.\n\nIn a blog post from Jan. 12, Santostasi suggested renaming the model the BTC Scaling Law for reference.\n\nUnsurprisingly, comparisons with PlanB\u2019s Stock to Flow (S2F) quickly emerged as both models depict bullish scenarios for the world\u2019s leading digital asset. On Jan. 30, Santostasi shared a graph comparing the Power Law prediction for Bitcoin to S2F and commented,\n\n\u201cI wish S2F was true. But I rather count on a more realistic model that seems correct than on a model that is too optimistic and then to get disappointed. Also it is not good for BTC PR for the community to make these unrealistic claims. I don\u2019t think it is possible to get to tens of millions by 2033 (as S2F predicts). 1 M is already amazing (more realistic Power Law in time prediction).\u201d\n\nThere has been a sizeable debate on X regarding which model is more accurate. Some believe the S2F model has been invalidated along with the rainbow chart, while others assert that global adoption will activate a return to the trend.\n\nHowever, there has been little to discuss the other power law models used to analyze Bitcoin over time.\n\nOther power law models for Bitcoin.\n\nSantostasi is not the first to utilize power laws for Bitcoin analysis. In 2014, Alec MacDonell at the University of Notre Dame introduced the Log Periodic Power Law (LPPL) model, which has been influential in understanding a Bitcoin bubble. This model focuses on asset price growth leading up to a crash.\n\nCentral to the LPPL model is the concept that Bitcoin\u2019s price growth follows an exponential trend relative to log-time. Essentially, a consistent percentage increase in time correlates with a proportional increase in Bitcoin\u2019s price. This model has proven useful in establishing critical support and resistance levels, guiding Bitcoin\u2019s upward price trajectory. Despite the model\u2019s predictive success, it\u2019s crucial to recognize its foundational assumption that Bitcoin\u2019s growth will continue to decelerate over time.\n\nIn 2019, Harold Christopher Burger built upon this foundation with the Power Law Oscillator (LPO), a tool designed to pinpoint optimal moments for Bitcoin investment, effectively predicting all four of Bitcoin\u2019s all-time highs. Notably, Santostasi suggests that Burger\u2019s PLO model was inspired by his own work from 2018, citing this Reddit thread. The thread includes Santostasi\u2019s model against Bitcoin at the time. In the top comment, the OP claimed that \u201cBTC will be around 150K in 2025.\u201d\n\nThe Power Law Oscillator gauges Bitcoin\u2019s relative valuation. With a range of 1 to -1, it signals whether Bitcoin is overpriced or underpriced at any given time. This tool\u2019s efficacy stems from its alignment with several key factors: historical data analysis, network value correlation, complex system dynamics, and resistance to traditional financial models.\n\nBitcoin price and power/scaling laws.\n\nWhen plotted on a log-log graph, Bitcoin\u2019s price trends reveal a power law relationship. A regression model based on this data can account for much of Bitcoin\u2019s price behavior, underscoring the model\u2019s predictive capabilities. The model resonates with Metcalfe\u2019s Law, which posits that a network\u2019s value is proportional to its users\u2019 square. This relationship has been validated in Bitcoin\u2019s case, especially over medium to long-term periods.\n\nThe prevalence of power laws in complex systems, such as urban growth and network development, suggests that Bitcoin, following a similar pattern, is more than a mere financial asset; it\u2019s a complex system in its own right. Bitcoin\u2019s unique characteristics, including its decentralization and detachment from traditional financial controls, render conventional currency models less effective. In contrast, the power law model offers an arguably more accurate representation of Bitcoin\u2019s market behavior.\n\nThe Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model offers a different yet complementary perspective. Popularized by an anonymous figure known as Plan B, this model assesses Bitcoin\u2019s value based on its scarcity, a concept intrinsic to commodities. The S2F model calculates the ratio of Bitcoin\u2019s total supply (stock) to its annual production rate (flow). This model\u2019s relevance is amplified by Bitcoin\u2019s predetermined supply schedule, characterized by halving events that reduce mining rewards and, thus, the flow, increasing the stock-to-flow ratio.\n\nThe S2F model gained significant attention, especially during the pandemic, as Bitcoin\u2019s price seemed to follow its predictions. However, this model focuses solely on the supply side, omitting demand, a vital component in price determination. Its predictions, sometimes reaching astronomical figures, have sparked debates in the financial community.\n\nWhile the S2F model provides a standardized measure of scarcity, helping compare Bitcoin with other scarce assets, it\u2019s essential to consider it as one of many factors in evaluating Bitcoin\u2019s investment potential. Market acceptance, technological advances, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic conditions are equally crucial in shaping Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nInterestingly, Santostasi\u2019s models are more conservative than other predictions. Many argue that Bitcoin is in the early phase of S-curve exponential growth. Santostasi rejects such models, stating that exponential growth on log charts is not feasible.\n\n\u201cBecause the middle part implies exponential growth given in a log linear chart a straight line is an exponential. BTC has never gone through an exponential growth (I mean the general trend), the bubbles are exponential.\u201d\n\nThus, while all of these models are used to predict Bitcoin\u2019s price, they differ in their specific methodologies and assumptions. The S2F model focuses on supply and demand, Santostasi\u2019s model uses regression analysis to predict future prices, MacDonell\u2019s LPPL model uses a calibration approach, and Burger\u2019s Power Law Oscillator is used chiefly as a technical analysis tool that varies over time within a particular band.\n\nIf the BTC Scaling Law (power law model) continues to be validated, Bitcoin\u2019s current value is closer to $60,000, and the next all-time high will be around March 2026, above $200,000."

        "content": "Bitcoin price hovers above the 2024 open at $42,479 and the 2024 POC at $42,643.\n\nBTC has a higher chance of resuming the uptrend after tagging the daily FVG, extending from $41,396 to $40,288.\n\nA breakdown of the weekly level at $39,851 will invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price shot up 3% on Monday but has since undone most of the gains and currently trades around $42,762. But a few things need to happen before BTC shows its bullish hand and resumes the uptrend.\n\nAlso read: Week Ahead: Bitcoin price likely to support these altcoin narratives this week\n\nBitcoin price could reveal directional bias soon\n\nBitcoin price created the Monday\u2019s range, extending from $41,807 to $43,324. The most common trade idea is to short BTC after a sweep of Monday\u2019s high and book profits at Monday\u2019s low.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Week ly Forecast: As monthly close draws near, significance of $43,750 grows\n\nHere are a few key levels to watch if one is in this trade.\n\nThe highest traded volume level of 2024, aka the Point of Control (POC) at $42,643. The 2024 yearly open at $42,479. The midpoint of the previous bear market at $42,235.\n\nIn addition to these levels, the daily imbalance, extending from $41,396 to $40,288, is also a key area to watch. Imbalances or gaps are formed when the asset moves rapidly up or down due to inefficient order flow. These gaps are often revisited by the asset to rebalance and serve as support or resistance, depending on the type of imbalance.\n\nIn BTC\u2019s case, the imbalance was formed due to a spike in buying pressure, so a retracement into this area will be a good place for sidelined buyers to open a long position.\n\nWhile this short-term play shows promise of a quick upside, investors need to be mindful of the big picture as well. As mentioned in a previous publication, Bitcoin price needs to produce a daily candlestick close above $48,222 to sustain the uptrend outlook.\n\nSupporting the bullish outlook are the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillator (AO) momentum indicators. The RSI has overcome the 50 mean level and is retesting it as a support, which is a bullish indication. The AO is close to flipping above the zero level, which shows a shift in momentum favoring bulls.\n\nIn such a case, Bitcoin price could easily overcome the $48,222 level and potentially retest the $50,000 psychological level.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nHowever, a potential spike in selling pressure that pushes Bitcoin price to slice through the $41,396 to $40,288 imbalance would denote a weak bullish camp. If this trend continues and leads to the production of a daily candlestick close below $39,851, it would produce a lower low and invalidate the bullish thesis for BTC.\n\nIn such a case, a steeper correction could be anticipated by investors, as pointed out in a previous publication. The $34,067 and $32,293 support levels will be where the Bitcoin price would likely consolidate and rethink a bounce."

The cryptocurrency mining companies will have to comply, per an \u201cemergency collection of data request\u201d the Office of Management and Budget authorized last week.\n\nGetting to this point has been a slog. After a ban on Bitcoin mining in China in 2021, the US became the world\u2019s biggest hub for Bitcoin mining. The mining boom raised flags for lawmakers and activists because of the energy demands of the process. Bitcoin mines managed to resurrect fossil fuel power plants and raise electricity costs for some residents in New York.\n\nIn 2022, Democratic lawmakers asked the biggest crypto mining companies in the US to disclose their electricity consumption and associated pollution. None of the companies responded with all the data they were asked to provide, and Congress subsequently asked the DOE and EPA to require that crypto companies publicly share the information.\n\nIn letters between the agencies and Democratic lawmakers shared exclusively with The Verge last year, Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm wrote a letter to Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) saying that the EIA has the authority to require crypto operations to report their energy use. Doing so would \u201crequire development of a new survey to collect this information,\u201d the letter says. It looks like that\u2019s what\u2019s happening now. According to the letter, the EIA can potentially also require utilities to share information about how much electricity they sell to crypto companies."

We\u2019ve also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia, a cryptocurrency is \u201ca digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.\u201d\n\nBitcoin was the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Ether is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three with its launch in July 2015. XRP, which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We\u2019ve included it here for reference.\n\nThe third-largest market share of cryptocurrency, tether, is a token \u201cbacked by actual assets.\u201d This includes one US dollar, one euro, or loans to affiliate companies and is controlled by the owners of Bitfinex. It\u2019s a controversial cryptocurrency due to its alleged manipulation of crypto pricing. It is called a \u201cstable coin\u201d because it was designed to always be worth $1.00. We do not chart it because its price rarely changes.\n\nFor a better understanding of crypto market cycles, read more here.\n\nThe Latest Crypto Data (through January 30, 2024)\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price bounced back this week to $43,000 but is still down ~3% year to date.\n\nXRP\u2019s price inched down further and is currently down ~19% year to date.\n\nEther\u2019s price improved over this past week and is now practically flat year to date.\n\nAn index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. Ether tops the chart, i.e., the price of an ether has changed the most out of all three cryptocurrencies.\n\nOn January 10th, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch.\n\nOther ETFs associated with cryptocurrencies include: ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITI), VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), and Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH).\n\nFor more news, information, and strategy, visit the Crypto Channel."

        "content": "While broker-dealers can now allow their financial advisors to sell a new spot-bitcoin exchange-traded fund, firms still have plenty of work to perform regarding the product, according to senior brokerage executives who spoke Tuesday morning at an industry conference.\n\nOn January 11, the Securities and Exchange Commission gave its approval to 11 bitcoin ETFs, and they\u2019re up and trading on public exchanges.\n\nSome firms were early adopters. For example, Wells Fargo Advisors, with close to 12,000 financial advisors across various business channels, said this month that it was selling new spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, but only when a customer asked for the security in a nonsolicited trade, or without any prompting from a salesperson.\n\nBut other firms are much more tentative, according to executives who spoke Monday at the Financial Services Institute\u2019s annual meeting, OneVoice, in Orlando, Florida.\n\n\u201cWhen new structures come out, it presents new challenges,\u201d said Matt Fries, head of investment products and partner solutions at Cetera Financial Group. \u201cIt\u2019s daunting because there is so much innovation occurring with investment products.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re scrambling to figure out spot-bitcoin ETFs right now,\u201d said Fries, who was speaking on a panel titled, \u201cIncluding Alternative Investments in Mainstream Portfolio Allocations.\u201d \u201cThat wasn\u2019t something that was on my mind a month ago, but now I\u2019m writing a policy on how we\u2019re going to handle these.\u201d\n\nCetera Financial Group is developing training for its financial advisors regarding the product, he added.\n\nBroker-dealers typically have tight restrictions on trading volatile products such as futures and options contracts, which require special training at many firms. Volatile alternative asset classes, including currencies and metals, also face strict limitations in client portfolios. Spot-bitcoin ETFs are facing that same kind of scrutiny.\n\n\u201cIt is very difficult to stay ahead of this kind of stuff even when you are trying to stay ahead of it,\u201d said Seth Miller, general counsel at Cambridge Investment Research Inc. He said that while he had anticipated the SEC\u2019s decision to approve spot-bitcoin ETFs, it still took a week to introduce training for financial advisors who were interested in the product.\n\nMeanwhile, one Cambridge financial advisor was admonishing Miller over email to hurry and immediately approve trading of the new ETFs, Miller said. \u201cWhen I look at other executives in this position, I ask, were you unprepared or were you just cautious?\u201d\n\n[More: Bitcoin ETFs in 401(k)s a useful diversifier, proponents say]"

        "content": "Where will Bitcoin (BTC -5.14%) go from here? Now that spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have obtained approval, there should be more room for Bitcoin's value to go up given that it is easier than ever to invest in it. But in the days following the approval, the cryptocurrency actually declined in value.\n\nThere aren't earnings reports or sales numbers that can help suggest where Bitcoin's value will go. Speculators play a big role in the digital currency's valuation, and that's why there can often be a great deal of volatility and risk when investing in Bitcoin. And right now, a large chunk of retail investors are expecting a significant decline in 2024.\n\nMany retail investors expect Bitcoin to fall below $20,000 this year\n\nAccording to a recent survey from Deutsche Bank, retail investors aren't overly optimistic about crypto's near-term future. More than a third of retail investors expect the price of Bitcoin to fall to less than $20,000 by the end of the year. And around 10% believe that it will finish the year between $20,000 and $40,000, suggesting a more modest decline.\n\nThere are some crypto bulls out there who believe it could rise to more than $75,000 before the end of 2024, but that is the minority, with about 10% of retail investors in the U.S. expecting it to hit those levels. And that falls to just 5% of retail investors in Europe, and even less than that in the U.K.\n\nCould this be a self-fulfilling prophecy?\n\nWhen it comes to speculation, expectations can play a large role in returns. If investors expect an investment to underperform, they could sell the asset, hoping to avoid a loss on it in the future. And if there is a large number of people holding that opinion, there could be a surge of selling, putting downward pressure on the investment -- which in this case would be Bitcoin.\n\nThere are some early signs that investors may already be cashing out. After approval of many spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, investors unloaded Bitcoin as the digital currency went in the opposite direction of where some investors might have expected it to go after the approvals (i.e., up). At the end of 2023, Bitcoin was trading at more than $42,000, but it is little changed since then.\n\nThe big test for Bitcoin could come in April\n\nAn expectation of a lower price for Bitcoin is troubling, because it could lead to more selling in the near future. But one potential catalyst that may help the digital asset's valuation is Bitcoin halving. That's when the rewards for mining the crypto are cut in half in order to limit its supply growth. After halving events, there is typically an increase in the price of Bitcoin. That's at least what has happened at previous halving events in 2020, 2016, and 2012.\n\nHowever, at previous halving events, Bitcoin's value was never as high as it is now. In 2020, when it was trading at about $8,820 on halving day, it would rise to roughly $10,940 in the 150 days after the event, a 24% gain. A similar type of move this year could push Bitcoin up to around $50,000.\n\nThe next halving event is likely to happen in April. Whether Bitcoin does indeed benefit from a big rally after could dictate how the digital currency does the rest of the year, as that momentum could carry it for months.\n\nUltimately, there isn't a reason to think halving will have such a positive effect on the price, which suggests the event may already be priced in. But given the pattern of previous halving events, it wouldn't be surprising to see Bitcoin's price jump this year -- the big question is how much.\n\nShould you buy Bitcoin today?\n\nBitcoin is a volatile and risky investment. It can be extremely difficult to try and predict where its value will go. For the majority of investors, it may not be a suitable investment option given its inherent volatility.\n\nIf you're willing to take on that risk and are looking to hang on for the long term, then it may make sense to invest in the digital asset given the approval of the recent spot Bitcoin ETFs, as that should bring in a broader pool of investors.\n\nAt the very least, investors should expect a bumpy ride, regardless of which direction you expect Bitcoin to go this year."

        "content": "What You Need to Know Bitcoin ETFs will be ubiquitous, Ric Edelman predicted.\n\nSchwab could be a low-cost competitor when and if it offers its own spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nEric Balchunas expects Schwab to file for a spot bitcoin ETF within a year.\n\nIt could take a year or more before Charles Schwab introduces its own spot bitcoin ETF, which market experts expect the giant asset manager to do eventually. And it could make a big splash when and if it does.\n\nSchwab typically isn\u2019t the first to enter new categories, analysts note. In the meantime, the company can reap the benefits of offering all the new spot bitcoin ETFs developed by other asset managers and approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission this month, including funds from Fidelity and BlackRock.\n\nSchwab, as a \u201cfinancial supermarket,\u201d has good reasons to avoid or delay entering the spot bitcoin ETF fracas, according to Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals.\n\nRemaining Agnostic\n\n\u201cThey pride themselves on making available an array of products and services to both investors and advisors that allow them to cater to the largest number possible. So by making available all 11 of these new spot bitcoin ETFs, Schwab is able to remain agnostic,\u201d Edelman told ThinkAdvisor on Monday.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have to put themselves in a position of promoting a particular product or even promoting the asset class. They can simply stand above the fray and make it clear to their investors and advisors that the products are available for them to select as they wish,\u201d he added.\n\nEric Balchunas, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst, sees Schwab potentially introducing its own spot bitcoin ETF within a year.\n\nSchwab and Fidelity are \u201calways looking to stay in competition with each other, and so as Fidelity gets more and more success with their bitcoin ETF, it may start to torture Schwab,\u201d Balchunas said.\n\n\u201cUnlike Vanguard, they\u2019re not anti-crypto at all. In fact, they have a crypto thematic ETF. So we know they\u2019re open to it. \u2026 And then there\u2019s just the fact that they generally enter categories late. They\u2019re never the first,\u201d the Bloomberg analyst said in an interview with ThinkAdvisor on Monday.\n\nA Competititve Splash?\n\n\u201cSo those are the reasons I could see them coming in with something and I could see them being really cheap. I mean, they do enter late, but when they enter, they usually make a splash with the lower fee,\u201d Balchunas added. He predicted the company would at least file an application for a spot bitcoin ETF within 12 months, noting he was only speculating.\n\n\u201cThe timetable in this new category always seems sped up to me versus normal time. It just feels like it\u2019s been like six months since they launched and it\u2019s been two weeks,\u201d Balchunas added. As Schwab sees demand for Fidelity and BlackRock spot bitcoin ETFs on its platform, there would be no reason for the brokerage not to develop its own, he said.\n\nFidelity and BlackRock already have gathered $2 billion in assets for their new bitcoin ETFs, Balchunas noted. \u201cThat\u2019s strong for two weeks. It\u2019s more than strong \u2026 That happens never, to be honest.\u201d\n\nSchwab doesn\u2019t comment on speculation, a spokeswoman said Monday.\n\nSchwab has no need to launch its own ETF in this category, according to Edelman, who nonetheless expects most all ETF sponsors to eventually offer crypto products.\n\nBy staying above the fray while offering other companies\u2019 spot bitcoin ETFs, Schwab reinforces its objectivity and the investment community\u2019s ability to obtain and execute any strategy they wish on Schwab\u2019s platform \u201cwithout worrying that there are limitations that could interfere with the preferences of the investors or advisors,\u201d Edelman said.\n\nAs for a delayed entry, Edelman added, \u201cit makes sense for Schwab to wait and see what market reaction is to these new products. Is there demand? Is there sufficient asset flow to justify the effort of creating your own investment option?\u201d\n\nEdelman noted that \u201cthere\u2019s been a race to the bottom\u201d as spot bitcoin ETF providers, in an effort to win assets under management, are offering fees as low as 19 basis points, with many waiving fees for as much as a year."

Kooner emphasizes the significant \u201cdiscount\u201d afforded to GBTC investors as a primary driver for the high volume of share selling in recent weeks:\n\n\u201cThe discount was over 50% during the bear market lows in late 2022, and it\u2019s non-existent now because of arbitrage traders. This was one of the most expected results of spot ETFs rolling out, which means these investors have been waiting for a long time to realize these profits,\u201d Kooner explains.\n\nThe report highlights $4.3 billion outflows following GBTC\u2019s conversion to a spot Bitcoin ETF on Jan. 16. Conversely, the highest net inflows for an individual spot Bitcoin ETF were to BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), attracting $1.82 billion.\n\nRelated: Fidelity Bitcoin ETF rakes in reported $208M, offsetting Grayscale outflows alone\n\nBitfinex analysts also draw attention to the impact of ETF flows on the BTC price, illustrated by the fact that there was no flow of funds into the respective spot Bitcoin ETF on Saturday, Jan. 20.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s GBTC remains the largest Bitcoin ETF, with its total assets under management hovering around the $24 billion mark despite dropping from $28.6 billion before its conversion.\n\nFTX sells GBTC shares as ETF fee battle begins\n\nThe Bitfinex report also notes that converting Grayscale\u2019s trust to a spot Bitcoin ETF facilitated the sale of significant shares held by bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX. FTX sold 22 million GBTC shares, valued at nearly $1 billion, completely liquidating its shares.\n\nAnother factor highlighted by Bitfinex Alpha is the impact of spot BTC ETF fees. Kooner noted that Grayscale\u2019s competitors currently charge fees ranging from 0.2% to 0.9%, while it charges 1.5%:\n\n\u201cThis difference in fees has incentivized investors to move their funds from GBTC to lower-cost Bitcoin ETF options. Additionally, multiple other ETF filings have waived off fees for the first year, further incentivizing a migration from GBTC to other products.\u201d\n\nData reflects a cooling of trading volume between Bitcoin ETF funds toward the end of January 2024. Source: Bitfinex Alpha/CryptoQuant.\n\nKooner said that investors are looking for more cost-effective ways to gain exposure to Bitcoin, which has impacted the shift of capital within the nascent Bitcoin ETF space. As January draws to a close, ETF data suggests that the movement of capital between the various ETF funds is beginning to settle.\n\n\"The daily outflows are reducing on a daily basis but are still quite high at an average of around $450 million per day. Unless there is change in fee structure, outflows are expected to continue,\" Kooner adds.\n\nThe Bitfinex head of derivatives concluded by highlighting that large GBTC investors who bought shares at a 50% discount over the past two years would realize profits on an earlier timeline than other investors, which is indicative of the trading behavior in January.\n\nMagazine: Big Questions: How can Bitcoin payments stage a comeback?"

        "title": "Ether takes center stage as bitcoin heads into one of strongest months - CNBC",
        "content": "Ether is ready to take the limelight in the month ahead after bitcoin and newly launched bitcoin exchange-traded funds dominated crypto investor attention in January. Both bitcoin and ether are on pace to finish the month higher by 0.01%, according to Coin Metrics. January saw sharp price swings driven first by hype before the launch of the first spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., and subsequent flows into and out of the funds after they began trading Jan. 11. By now, the outflows have tapered off and bitcoin's outlook for the year is still strong, boosted by the upcoming halving and the potential for rate cuts. As investors came to expect slow, steady flows into bitcoin through newly institutionalized ETFs in coming months, ether and altcoins have been ready for a breakout. \"Short-term flow has been dominated by GBTC [Grayscale Bitcoin] sales. \u2026 As that flow is easing, the market has found its footing and the reality of a world where large asset managers promote crypto actively is starting to hit home,\" said Darius Tabatabai, co-founder at decentralized exchange Vertex Protocol. \"ETH and the alts are acting as high beta plays on this trend and our expectation is that both will outperform as more focus starts to direct towards ETH rolling out upgrades to [the Ethereum network] \u2026 as well as a potential ETF approval.\" February is a historically strong month for both bitcoin and ether. Bitcoin has finished nine of the last 11 Februarys in the green and has had an average return of 13.12% for the month, according to CoinGlass. Ether has finished the month higher in six of the last seven since its inception, giving it an average February gain of 12.97%. Soon after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot bitcoin ETFs for trading, investors took profits and rotated into ether, pushing it to a 20-month high as they looked ahead to what might come next. The SEC is due to give decisions on spot ETH ETF applications beginning in May. BlackRock, Invesco, Ark and VanEck are among the firms in line for approval, as well as Grayscale, which is seeking to convert its existing Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into an ETF. Standard Chartered said in a note this week that ahead of the May decision, it expects ether to track or outperform bitcoin's pre-ETF uptrend in the comparable period. If it does, it could reach $4,000 by then, the bank added, which would equal a roughly 70% increase from current levels. \"Bitcoin remains the more popular macro asset with cross-over appeal to traditional finance, and Solana is gaining popularity as a faster and cheaper alternative to Ethereum,\" said Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at crypto asset manager Arca. \"Nonetheless, Ethereum is not going away anytime soon, and it could even compete with Bitcoin if an ETF is approved, or if bitcoin investors realize they want exposure to areas of blockchain's growth that Bitcoin doesn't offer, such as stablecoins, NFTs, [decentralized finance], gaming [and] AI.\" Ethereum is continually improving and upgrading , Dorman added, which will help the network grow in line with cheaper and faster alternatives such as Solana. Its next big update, called \"Dencun,\" is expected to take place in February and is meant to make transactions on so-called Layer 2 solutions \u2014 networks that sit on top of a base network like Ethereum and exist to provide extra capacity and functionality to the network \u2014 less expensive. Ether is also poised to benefit from the popularity of altcoins , many of which run on top of the Ethereum blockchain, according to Jason Urban, the global head of trading at Galaxy Digital. \"We've seen an uptick in alt interest. \u2026 ETH is probably more poised to benefit from that\" than bitcoin, he said. \"There are going to be people that will manifest that play, especially more [traditional finance] people that might not have access or the ability to trade a bag of alts. You'll see that manifest in ETH.\" For January, ETH is heading to a less than 1% gain, while other alts are a mixed bag. Since Jan. 23, however, when bitcoin fell below $40,000 for the first time this year, they've rallied, while ETH has been stagnant. ETH is weaker during that period, while SOL has gained 14%, Polygon's MATIC rose 4% and the tokens tied to Chainlink and Cardano advanced 4% and 3%, respectively. \"If you believe in a bullish market trend like in 2020 and 2021, then it makes sense to invest in the 'fastest horse,' which are the smaller and cheaper blockchains and applications,\" Dorman said. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting."

        "title": "Spot Bitcoin ETF Race Narrows to IBIT vs. FBTC - etf.com",
        "content": "Spot bitcoin ETFs from the largest issuers are separating themselves from the pack of 10 that launched earlier this month, as the race for billions of investor dollars flowing into the crypto investments begins to declare winners and losers.\n\nThe iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) have gathered $2.8 billion and $2.2 billion in assets under management, respectively, since their Jan. 11 debut, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nEach of those totals is larger than the next seven spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds combined. The ARK 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) have $662 million and $634 million in AUM, respectively, while the rest of the pack has $307 million or less.\n\nFund Data\n\nThe outcome may not necessarily surprise anyone. BlackRock was expected to eventually take the spot bitcoin ETF crown thanks to its position as the largest asset manager in the world, as well as the largest ETF issuer in the U.S.\n\nAnd as the third largest brokerage firm with a massive asset management business of its own, Fidelity was also anticipated to be a big player in the space.\n\nIBIT, FBTC Go for the Spot Bitcoin ETF Gold\n\nAs expectations are now being met, the gap between IBIT, FBTC and the rest of the pack will likely widen. Still, when or if either of those ETFs grabs the spot bitcoin ETF crown from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is open to debate.\n\nSince its conversion into an ETF, investors have pulled $5.5 billion out of GBTC, pushing its AUM down to $21.2 billion, according to Bloomberg data. But that still leaves it 10 times bigger than Fidelity\u2019s ETF and almost eight times bigger than BlackRock\u2019s fund.\n\nThe outflows from GBTC are already slowing. Most investors who were going to swap out of the relatively-expensive GBTC and into cheaper alternatives have already done so, while arbitrageurs who bought the trust at a discount before its conversion have already locked in their gains.\n\nOn the other hand anyone interested in investing in bitcoin through ETFs probably won\u2019t choose GBTC over its competitors due to its high fees, so it\u2019s unlikely that the trust sees substantial inflows anytime soon.\n\nWhat\u2019s at Stake\n\nStill, IBIT or FBTC taking over GBTC as the largest spot bitcoin ETF will take time. Assuming prices for bitcoin stay flat, it would take almost $20 billion of inflows for either ETF to eclipse GBTC in terms of total assets.\n\nIf bitcoin prices rise, it will take even larger inflows since GBTC\u2019s AUM will disproportionately benefit from that increase (a 10% increase in GBTC\u2019s AUM is $2.1 billion, while the same increase in IBIT\u2019s AUM is only $200 million).\n\nThe task becomes easier if bitcoin prices fall. In that scenario, GBTC\u2019s AUM will decline faster than that of either IBIT or FBTC (on a dollar basis), closing the gap between the funds."

(SOPA Images via Getty Images)\n\nMarket shifts focus to ether\n\nAhmad said that the market had initially priced in the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF. Once this became a reality, attention turned to ethereum. He highlighted a price increase of around 10% to 12% for ether after the approval of multiple spot bitcoin ETFs, indicating that ethereum is now in the spotlight for the next potential ETF approval.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"It is difficult to forecast whether ether will outperform bitcoin because now that bitcoin has an ETF wrapper, there is potentially more demand,\" Ahmad said.

He pointed out that after a rapid increase in rates following 15 years of near-zero interest rates, the market is now likely to experience another rate pause at this week's US Federal Reserve meeting.\n\nThis pause may provide investors, particularly those dealing with risk assets like bitcoin and digital assets, with more confidence to allocate capital to this asset class, according to Ahmad.\n\nWatch: Turning real assets into tokens on blockchain has $15 trillion market potential | Future Focus\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Portal, a fintech provider advancing financial self-sovereignty with robust technology for seamless access to Bitcoin and diverse cryptocurrency markets, today announced it has exited stealth mode and raised $34 million in seed funding. Investors that participated in the round include Coinbase Ventures, Arrington Capital, OKX Ventures and Gate.io, as well as many other high-profile fintech and crypto investors. The seed funding builds on Portal\u2019s angel round of $8.5 million, which closed in 2021.\n\nThe new funding comes at a pivotal moment for the crypto industry as it grapples with the security risks and fragmentation inherent in cross-chain bridges, centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). In fact, over the last two years, approximately $2.5 billion has been stolen from bridges alone by hackers, according to Token Terminal, with prominent hacks of bridges such as Wormhole, HECO/HTX, Nomad, Harmony, Multichain, BNB bridge and Orbit. With few alternative cross-trading solutions on the market, users are forced to rely on highly centralized, opaque and risky swapping solutions like wrappers, bridges and custodians.\n\n\u201cBridges, centralized exchanges and other custodial solutions that enable cross-chain exchange have been vulnerable and insecure for as long as they have existed,\u201d said Chandra Duggirala, co-founder and CEO of Portal. \u201cFrom the very early days of Mt. Gox to FTX, centralized exchanges have been a persistent source of risk to user funds. Now, the risk remains, but it has taken a new form in bridges and other custodial cross-chain solutions. Portal intends to solve the problem of custodial risk once and for all using secure and transparent Layer 2 atomic swap technology. With the support of our investors, we look forward to introducing cross-chain infrastructure that finally enables users to execute trades quickly and safely.\u201d\n\nThrough its novel, decentralized and trust-minimized infrastructure, Portal is building a solution that will enable peer-to-peer swapping of Bitcoin across a range of blockchains without the need for dangerous intermediaries like wrappers, bridges, CEXs and multi-hop DEXs. As a staking and swapping layer, interoperability layer and execution layer, Portal\u2019s infrastructure will enable any user to swap Bitcoin across a range of blockchains and back in seconds without giving up custody, privacy or security.\n\nPortal will use the funds to develop its two flagship products: Portal DEX and Portal Wallet. Portal DEX is the first Bitcoin-based exchange that enables Layer 2 atomic swaps of cryptocurrencies across blockchains at greater speed, lower cost and with increased transparency, security and interoperability. Portal Wallet is a fully non-custodial tool that integrates Portal DEX and allows users to receive, store and send cryptocurrencies across blockchains.\n\nIn the coming months, Portal will launch several new groundbreaking products previously only available to large institutions and hedge funds. They include an AI-powered, co-pilot investment application for acquiring financial intelligence and maximizing high-level investment strategies; and an API integration tool for building Portal DEX cross-chain swap functionality into existing wallets, DeFi applications on any chain and Web3 DApps. Portal will also be announcing several strategic partnerships with major Bitcoin projects to enhance the utility and accessibility of Bitcoin, which have been bottlenecks for the crypto community.\n\n\u201cPortal is pioneering what DeFi on Bitcoin looks like and we are thrilled to be supporting this team that continues to deliver,\u201d said Michael Arrington, founder and partner of Arrington Capital. \u201cPortal is rapidly pushing ahead the Bitcoin ecosystem by enabling fast and low-cost economic activity without being beholden to third parties. As one of the largest asset classes, Bitcoin will be more accessible and secure for individuals thanks to Portal\u2019s unique approach to access, security and products.\u201d\n\n\u201cPortal is carving a unique niche in the evolving Bitcoin landscape, crafting an innovative, cross-chain, private DEX protocol that masterfully addresses the complexities and risks of both centralized and decentralized exchanges,\u201d said Dora Yue, founder of OKX Ventures. \u201cThe Portal platform is a game-changer, making decentralized trading and financial contract creation for Bitcoin and other assets both faster and more secure. It's a leap towards a future where trading is more responsive, liquid and secure.\u201d\n\nAbout Portal\n\nPortal is a fintech provider advancing financial self-sovereignty with robust technology for seamless access to Bitcoin and diverse cryptocurrency markets. A builder of the foundational pieces of technology required for a trustless and inclusive economy, Portal offers an advanced technological infrastructure, improved systems for coordination and easy-to-use tools previously only available to large institutions and hedge funds. Portal enables individual investors to exchange digital assets across blockchain networks with greater efficiency and speed, lower costs, increased transparency and enhanced security and privacy.

Respondents included independent registered investment advisers (RIAs), as well as broker-dealer representatives, financial planners and other institutional investors.\n\nOf the surveyed advisers interested in adding bitcoin exposure to client portfolios, nearly 90% said they were waiting until after a spot bitcoin ETF was approved.\n\nRead more: SEC officially approves spot bitcoin ETFs in landmark decision\n\nWirehouses \u2014 a term for firms such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo \u2014 are usually the slowest to allocate to new offerings, said Ric Edelman, founder of Edelman Financial Services and the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals.\n\n\u201cMajor firms all have investment committees, which need time to decide which of these products to approve for use,\u201d Edelman told Blockworks. \u201cMeanwhile, their legal and compliance officers must write policies governing which of their advisers can offer these products, and which of the firm\u2019s clients will be permitted to invest in them \u2014 along with how much each client is permitted to invest.\u201d\n\nWhile independent RIAs are more agile when it comes to allocating new funds, a majority won\u2019t do so immediately, Edelman added. He noted that most advisers don\u2019t fully understand crypto or blockchain technology and will have to figure out how to explain these sectors to clients.\n\n\u201cOnly after they get past that hurdle are advisers ready to tackle the big tactical questions,\u201d Edelman said. \u201cWhich clients should invest in these ETFs? What allocation is best for them? How will the advisers communicate this recommendation, and how will they respond to client questions and objections?\u201d\n\nEdelman expects financial advisers to allocate more than $150 billion into spot bitcoin ETFs in the next two years.\n\nTen spot bitcoin ETFs launched on Jan. 11. While funds by BlackRock and Fidelity lead the pack with more than $2 billion of net inflows each, outflows from Grayscale Investments\u2019 Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) have tempered the sector\u2019s asset gains.\n\nEdelman predicts the BTC funds to be on wealth manager platforms \u2014 with advisers given the ability to allocate to them on behalf of clients \u2014 over the next six to 12 months.\n\n\u201cTo assess the real success of the bitcoin ETFs, months three through 12 will be much more important than months one through three,\u201d Thorn noted.\n\nRyan Rasmussen, senior crypto research analyst at Bitwise, said some wealth managers \u2014 namely RIAs \u2014 are already investing in crypto products, with allocations ranging between 1% and 5%. Teams at such investment firms are creating a crypto sleeve in their model portfolios, he added.\n\nRead more: Financial pros mull allocation boosts to \u2018chaos-resilient\u2019 BTC: Bitwise\n\n\u201cThat should translate to meaningful inflows into these products,\u201d Rasmussen told Blockworks. \u201cFor example, if the spot bitcoin ETFs sucked up 1% of all ETF assets in the US, that would be more than $70 billion of assets under management in spot bitcoin ETFs.

        "content": "Good timing often helps some new exchange traded funds. And that was expected to be the case for the 10 recently launched spot bitcoin ETFs, including the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO).\n\nBTCO and friends were expected to be beneficiaries of pent-up demand. The reality is the debut of spot bitcoin ETFs proved to be a \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d event. As highlighted by a strong showing Monday, the selling appears to be ebbing. And with Monday\u2019s rally, the digital currency is now in the green on a year-to-date basis.\n\nObviously, that\u2019s constructive for ETFs such as BTCO. But the good news for investors is that, well, there\u2019s more good news.\n\nStars Could Align for BTCO, Bitcoin Rally\n\nMultiple factors indicate BTCO and the digital currency could be in for some near-term upside. For example, JPMorgan said in a new report that selling pressure on bitcoin caused by the conversion of one of BTCO\u2019s rivals to an ETF from the index fund structure appears to be abating. That\u2019s pertinent because that selling was in the billions of dollars.\n\nData indicates that outflows from the BTCO rival waned last week. That might be one reason the digital currency started this week on a strong note. Additionally, The Daily Hodl reports that the cryptocurrency whales have accumulated $3 billion worth of the largest cryptocurrency this month.\n\n\u201cWhales\u2019 include any entity, individual or fund (including the ETFs) holding over 1,000 BTC. While Bitcoin ETFs have seen net inflows of $820 million, Bitcoin whales have seen an increase of ~$3 billion (76,000 BTC) so far in 2024. Including GBTC, Bitcoin ETFs now hold 3.23% of Bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply,\u201d according to the publication.\n\nIn other words, ETFs such as BTCO are having the desired effects of acting as new buyers of bitcoin while removing supply from the market. The April halving of bitcoin could act as another significant catalyst for the digital currency and funds such as BTCO.\n\nOn a recent edition of the Scott Melker podcast, Skybridge Capital Founder and Managing Partner Anthony Scaramucci said in the 18 months post-halving, bitcoin could quadruple in price. So if it trades at $40,000 on the day of halving, it could reach $160,000 or more by late 2025.\n\nHe added that his long-term forecast for the digital currency is that its market capitalization will eventually reach half that of gold. That implies a run to $400,000.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel."

A range of demographics was covered, with participants hailing from countries in Western and Eastern Europe, South and Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Northern Africa, and Latin American regions.\n\nRelated: $100K BTC? Don\u2019t undervalue Bitcoin ETF influence, says Adam Back\n\n9,748 people participated in the study between November and December 2023, with the data anonymized for analysis.\n\n84% of participants expect Bitcoin to surpass the 2021 bull market all-time high of $69,000.

Source: Bitget Bitcoin halving survey\n\nInvestors from Western European countries were the most optimistic about the next price top for Bitcoin, with 41% of respondents expecting BTC to surpass the $100,000 mark. However, the report notes that investors from the region were less convicted about the Bitcoin halving impact on BTC\u2019s price:\n\n\u201cIt may indicate that these investors are \u2018short-term cautious, long-term optimistic,\u2019 as some Western European investors do not believe the Bitcoin halving will trigger a new bull market.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, respondents from Latin America, East Asia and Southeast Asia were the most optimistic that the Bitcoin halving would significantly impact BTC\u2019s price. 84%, 82% and 81% of respondents from the regions above foresee a substantial impact of the mining reward halving.\n\nIn an interview with Cointelegraph on Jan. 30, Bitcoin proponent Paul Sztorc offered a contrasting view of the impact of the Bitcoin halving, suggesting the event would be a litmus test for the mining industry in particular as rewards drop while the hash rate and mining difficulty continue to reach new highs.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin halving 2024 \u2014 Miners predict potential outcomes of reduced BTC rewards\n\nSztorc suggests that the initial impact on price might not be as pronounced as some commentators predict. In an interview in December 2023, fellow Bitcoin proponent and cryptographer Adam Back told Cointelegraph that the next Bitcoin peak might come 18 months after the next halving.\n\nSeveral prominent mining companies gave in-depth predictions about the impact of the halving on their operations and the need to be highly efficient to remain profitable in one of Cointelegraph\u2019s 2024 New Year Specials.\n\nMagazine: Big Questions: How can Bitcoin payments stage a comeback?"

        "content": "Ark Invest CEO and famous stock picker Cathie Wood is one of crypto's biggest bulls. It's no secret that she is extremely optimistic about the long-term potential for cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin (BTC -5.14%) being potentially one of the best investments to hold on to, according to her.\n\nToday, Bitcoin's value is around $40,000 but in the long run, Wood believes it could be even better than a 10-bagger and grow to $650,000 or more. But why is she so bullish on Bitcoin?\n\nWhy Cathie Wood believes Bitcoin could soar to $650,000 and higher\n\nIn a recent interview with Yahoo! Finance, Wood was discussing her optimistic views on Bitcoin and what the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) would mean for the cryptocurrency. And approval of the ETFs, she believes, would signal to institutional investors that the \"coast is clear,\" implying that it will be safer and more acceptable for institutions to invest in Bitcoin. At the time of the interview, which was in mid-November, regulators hadn't yet approved spot Bitcoin ETFs -- but that finally happened on Jan. 10.\n\nFor institutional investors, crypto represents a new asset class where they might decide to invest a certain percentage of their portfolios, with Bitcoin being the most likely option given its popularity and dominance.\n\nPlus, Wood believes Bitcoin's scarcity, with only 19.5 million Bitcoins mined and a limit of just 21 million ever, will also help drive up the price of the digital currency. As demand increases but there isn't a correspondingly large increase in supply, that imbalance could push Bitcoin's coin price and overall valuation higher.\n\nAccording to Wood, these two factors could help Bitcoin's value rise to $650,000 and potentially even higher.\n\nIs this too bullish of an outlook?\n\nThe challenge with Bitcoin is that it's difficult to predict how high the cryptocurrency could rise in value. A few years ago, when investors were bullish on meme stocks and high-risk investments, Bitcoin reached a high of nearly $68,000. But it fell to less than $20,000 again by the end of 2022, proving that it remains highly volatile.\n\nAnd the assumption that institutional investors will play a big role in such a massive spike in Bitcoin could be a bit too optimistic. After all, it's not as if institutional investors have been sitting on the sidelines, waiting for regulators to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs. According to a 2022 report from Fidelity, 58% of institutional investors were already invested in digital assets.\n\nWhile it's possible more institutional investors could buy Bitcoin in the future, it also isn't an untapped market. And for institutional investors, it's often a mix of balancing risk and returns. With crypto being highly volatile, there may not be an overwhelming reason to dedicate a significant part of their investment portfolios to crypto.\n\nInvestors should temper their expectations for Bitcoin\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in the excitement around Bitcoin, given the approval of spot ETFs. But that doesn't mean it's off to the races or that it's going to be a 10x investment on short notice. Institutional investors have already been buying digital assets, and the overall scarcity of Bitcoin is already known and likely priced into its valuation.\n\nInvestors who are expecting significant gains from Bitcoin need to remember there are also considerable risks, such as heightened regulation and countries setting up restrictions and even banning crypto altogether. It's by no means a clear path for Bitcoin to get to $650,000 or any other specific level.\n\nWhile there can be a lot of upside with Bitcoin, there's a lot of risk as well. This remains a highly speculative asset to be investing in. If you're interested in adding crypto to your portfolio, you may want to diversify with other, safer investments to keep your risks under control."

Qian, who went to the United Kingdom under a false identity, needed help cleaning up the funds taken from an investment fraud scheme facilitated in China from 2014 to 2017.\n\nWen used to work at a Chinese restaurant in southeast London before meeting Qian. The takeaway worker lived in a room underneath the restaurant before she met her \u201cboss,\u201d whom she introduced as working in an international jewelry business.\n\nProsecutor Gillian Jones said that Wen attempted to buy luxury items and real estate in London with Bitcoin (BTC). This included a seven-bedroom mansion in Hampstead with a swimming pool. The property was on the market for $30 million, but the purchases didn\u2019t go through when Wen could not explain the source of the crypto assets.\n\nImage of the property that Wen attempted to purchase. Source: Google Street View (via Sky New)\n\nJones told the jury at the trial that Wen was not involved in the fraud committed by Qian. However, Wen is accused of converting Bitcoin into cash, luxury items and real estate on behalf of Qian.\n\nAuthorities reportedly raided a house that Wen and Qian rented and confiscated various devices containing more than 61,000 BTC, worth about $1.7 billion when it was accessed back in 2021.\n\nRelated: Couple mistakenly sent $10.5M by Crypto.com to face October plea hearing\n\nInitially, Wen claimed that the crypto she held had been mined.

Despite facing three counts of money laundering, Wen Jian maintains her innocence and is not accused of participating in the initial fraudulent schemes.\n\nProsecutor Gillian Jones identified Zhang Yadi, also known as Qian Zhimin, as the mastermind behind the $6.3 billion fraud scheme. According to Jones, Zhang, who is cited in the indictment as the beneficiary of the laundered funds, escaped to Britain with a fake identity in 2017 when Chinese officials initiated an investigation into the fraudulent operations.\n\nBritish prosecutors have charged a Chinese woman with money laundering, according to the FT. Zhang stole around \u00a35bn from more than 128,000 Chinese investors through wealth management fraud between 2014 and 2017, before converting the money into Bitcoin and arriving in London in\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 30, 2024\n\nWhile associates connected to the fraud have been apprehended in China, Jones highlighted that Zhang has successfully evaded capture. Furthermore, the stolen funds have yet to be recovered and returned to the defrauded investors.\n\nThe jury learned that Zhang appointed Wen as a facade to obscure the origins of the pilfered funds, which were initially invested in Bitcoin to facilitate their transfer out of China.\n\nUpon arriving in London in 2017, Zhang sought to transform the Bitcoin holdings back into tangible assets like cash, real estate, jewelry, or other valuable items, as explained by Prosecutor Gillian Jones.\n\nWen Jian has conceded her participation in the Bitcoin transactions, but the pivotal aspect of the trial revolves around discerning her level of awareness or suspicion regarding the illicit nature of the Bitcoin\u2019s origins, as elucidated by Prosecutor Gillian Jones to the jury members.\n\nThe case is ongoing.\n\nUK to Expand National Crypto Crime Unit\n\nIn a strategic move to combat financial crimes, the UK\u2019s National Crime Agency (NCA) is set to enhance its capabilities in addressing cryptocurrency fraud. The expansion includes the recruitment of four seasoned investigators, specifically designated to the financial crime unit, to address the increasing incidents of corruption and fraud associated with blockchain technology.\n\nFurther strengthening its operations, the NCA\u2019s Complex Financial Crime Team (CFCT) will integrate a new Digital Asset Disclosure Officer , extending its operational reach across various jurisdictions. This enhancement is aimed at ensuring a robust monitoring and enforcement mechanism in the evolving digital asset landscape.\n\nCollaboratively, the team is poised to work in tandem with a dedicated surveillance unit and the police department. This coordinated effort is crucial for the in-depth investigation of high-profile cases involving fraud and money laundering, particularly those orchestrated by sophisticated, organized criminal networks.\n\nThe UK\u2019s biggest taxpayer and algorithmic trader Alex Gerko wrote on Twitter last year that the crypto industry was \u201c99% to 100% fraud or bullshit\u201d. I agree. I just wish I paid as much tax as him! Sigh. Back to my modest self assessment form! https://t.co/in2nlIKm1I \u2014 Paul Lewis (@paullewismoney) January 27, 2024\n\nThe initiative encompasses a comprehensive approach to tackling criminal activities within the digital domain, specifically focusing on severe and harmful offenses related to cryptocurrency and virtual assets. This includes addressing sophisticated fraud and money laundering operations conducted by major organized crime syndicates and state-backed entities.\n\nEuropean Banking Authority Seeks to Fortify AML/CFT Standards for Crypto Providers\n\nThe European Banking Authority (EBA) is actively pursuing a comprehensive update to the Anti-Money Laundering and Combatting the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regulations, specifically targeting cryptocurrency service providers. Central to the EBA\u2019s strategic initiative is the harmonization of AML/CFT guidelines across both payment service providers and crypto asset service providers (CASPs).\n\nMember States are being grilled on their bids for the newest EU agency in Brussels covering anti money laundering .

A pivotal element of the proposed enhancements involves advancing the interoperability of protocols among CASPs. This development mandates CASPs to evolve their systems to facilitate the smooth and integrated exchange of information, underscoring the EBA\u2019s commitment to ensuring a robust, transparent, and cohesive regulatory framework in the evolving digital finance landscape."

        "content": "Bitcoin Drivechain proponent Paul Sztorc believes the growing mainstream acceptance of BTC will drive a need for greater scalability and functionality of its infrastructure.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with Cointelegraph, Sztorc touched on the advantages and drawbacks of the high-profile approval of Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the United States and the long-term implications of institutional money flooding into the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sign of health, a sign of validation. Bitcoin is certainly more recognizable, and its name is getting out there. It\u2019s also a result of certain types of money that must flow through ETFs,\u201d Sztorc said.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin Amsterdam: Focus on BTC fundamentals, says Edward Snowden\n\nThe co-founder of LayerTwo Labs described Bitcoin ETFs as an \u201cinevitable consequence of age,\u201d highlighting that customers of the BTC-backed investment products differ from everyday retail investors and hardcore Bitcoiners:\n\n\u201cETFs are inherently custodial, plugged into the apparatus of reporting to government and the state. Nevertheless, the type of person relying on an ETF would be unlikely to self-custody Bitcoin anyway.\u201d\n\nSztorc admits that the hype around Bitcoin ETFs may serve as an entry point for investors and individuals who have yet to learn about BTC. At the same time, the focus on their impact could be causing undue attention on Bitcoin\u2019s value rather than its underlying metrics and performance.\n\n\u201cThe bad things? ETFs continue people\u2019s obsession with price. A CEO should never talk about stock price, they should focus on what drives it. The quality of the product and how happy their workers are,\u201d Sztorc adds.\n\nBitcoin scaling is still a work in progress\n\nLayerTwo Labs has been developing Drivechains for over four years. Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) 300 and 301 outline how the Bitcoin network could create, delete, send and receive BTC from layer-2 blockchains, commonly called sidechains.\n\nSztorc, who authored BIP-300, is a proponent of the functionality afforded by Drivechains and has spoken at length about the intricacies of the two BIPs at several Bitcoin conferences in recent years.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin Amsterdam highlights hurdles for consensus over improvement proposals\n\nAs more liquidity flows into the Bitcoin ecosystem through major adoption-driving events like the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the network could face higher transaction volumes. It\u2019s a point that Sztorc highlights, referring to a statement from Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator.\n\n\u201cSatoshi Nakamoto said that in 20 years, there will be high transaction volume or no volume. Large blockers used that to say Satoshi was a large blocker; regardless, I am fairly confident he\u2019s right,\u201d Sztorc said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no scenario where one billion people use another blockchain protocol and Bitcoin survives.\u201d\n\nWhile the Lightning Network has been influential in providing a means for the Bitcoin network to process low-fee, high-throughput transactions, Sztorc maintains that the ecosystem needs additional functionality to combat existing threats from altcoin competition, hard fork campaigns and extension block campaigns.\n\nRelated: BIP-300 biff: Debate reignites over years-old Bitcoin Drivechain proposal\n\n\u201cBIP-300 is about having competition, it\u2019s the thing we need. Different software developers will compete, and it solves the last piece that people overlook. Sidechains allow people to play whatever game they want, while Bitcoiners who don\u2019t opt in never need to care what a sidechain is doing,\u201d Sztorc said.\n\nAs Cointelegraph previously reported, BIPs have played an essential role in laying the foundations for soft forks that have helped improve the functionality of Bitcoin\u2019s protocol and the development of innovations like the Lightning Network.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Elegant and ass-backward\u2019: Jameson Lopp\u2019s first impression of Bitcoin"
