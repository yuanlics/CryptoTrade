        "title": "The Ultimate Guide to Bitcoin Loan: How It Works and Its Benefits - The Arizona Republic",
        "content": "Jon Stojan\n\nContributor\n\nIn recent years, the digital financial market has revolutionized the world of finance. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have been crucial in this transformation as they have emerged as new financial instruments in the mainstream market. The popularity of Bitcoin is justified by the endless opportunities it has provided traders and investors. One such innovation is the Bitcoin loan, which is creating a lot of buzz in the financial market. This guide delves into the intricacies of Bitcoin loans, decoding its mechanics and benefits to determine the reason behind its growing acceptance.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with a brief introduction to Bitcoin loans and their role. A Bitcoin loan is an amazing opportunity to turn your Bitcoin holdings as collateral for securing a loan in fiat currency or another cryptocurrency. This can be of immense help if you need funds but don't want to sell your holdings because you expect higher returns in the future. It is like using your digital assets to increase your purchasing power without losing your digital assets.\n\nSecuring Bitcoin loans\n\nTo secure a loan, you only need to send your Bitcoin to a lending platform as collateral. In return, you will receive a loan in stablecoin or another cryptocurrency based on the value of your Bitcoin holdings and the platform's loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. The LTV ratio is a measure of risk factors associated with the volatility of the crypto market. If the value of Bitcoin drops, you might have to add more collateral to equalize the amount you borrowed or risk your Bitcoin holdings being liquidated.\n\nBenefits of Bitcoin loans\n\nThe benefits of Bitcoin loans have fuelled its popularity in the market. The opportunity to access liquidity without selling off your holding stands as the first merit of these loans. This is a great advantage for long-term holders who believe in the prospects of Bitcoin. By preserving your Bitcoin holdings, you not only save on capital gains tax but also borrow against it.\n\nCompared to traditional financial institutions, the level of privacy in Bitcoin loans is higher. Unlike extensive personal information and credit checks required by banks and other lending institutions, you can secure a Bitcoin loan with minimal identity verification. This is why Bitcoin loans are becoming the preferred option among individuals who value their financial privacy. It is also noteworthy that Bitcoin loans are processed faster than traditional loans and often involve prolonged application processes and bureaucratic delays. Leveraging the power of blockchain technology, you can get a Bitcoin loan within hours or even minutes.\n\nRisks with Bitcoin loans\n\nJust like any other financial tool, Bitcoin loans have their own limitations and challenges. The most common one is the inherent volatility of the crypto market. You are at risk of liquidation of your Bitcoin holdings or collateral if the value of Bitcoin falls to a certain range. This risk can be mitigated by tracking the market value of Bitcoin and adding up to the collateral in a bearish market situation.\n\nThis high volatility of Bitcoin can also be profitable for Bitcoin loans if the currency value rises. You can benefit from both the loan and the increasing value of your collateral if you have an outstanding Bitcoin loan while the value of your Bitcoin holdings increases. Investors often capitalize upon these opportunities.\n\nAs the financial landscape continues to evolve, Bitcoin loans are emerging as more feasible and seamless options to secure loans. This financial tool is not just closing the gap between digital and physical financial realms but also changing how people benefit from their digital holding. With incredible flexibility, speed, and privacy, Bitcoin loans are solidifying the path for Cryptocurrencies to integrate into the mainstream financial market."

        "content": "The upcoming bitcoin halving could be a boon for the share price of payment company Block, as Berenberg Capital Markets analysts argued bitcoin\u2019s impact on the stock is more than it should be.\n\nThe correlation between Block shares and the price of bitcoin \u2014 standing at 0.61 \u2014 \u201cappears to be a case in which investors\u2019 perception of the impact of bitcoin on the company\u2019s prospects matters more than the reality,\u201d the analysts said in a Wednesday research note.\n\nA potential price boost to bitcoin with the upcoming halving set for April 2024 \u2014 an event when rewards offered to bitcoin miners are cut in half \u2014 could support Block\u2019s stock price, the note adds.\n\nHistory would suggest bitcoin\u2019s price could spike in the upcoming halving\u2019s aftermath, industry watchers have said. Matt Lason, chief investment officer at crypto hedge fund Globe 3 Capital, told Blockworks in July that such events \u201cserve as a great reminder for everyone of the power of bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy and the true value of scarcity in an inflationary world.\u201d\n\nBlock \u2014 formerly known as Square \u2014 was founded by Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey in 2009. Square remains the name of its payments platform for businesses, while mobile payment service Cash App is another one of its main offerings.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock price was $45.39 at 1 pm ET Thursday \u2014 down about 30% year to date. Berenberg\u2019s price target for Block shares is $75.\n\nA questionable correlation?\n\nInvestors have used stock in Block as a means of gaining bitcoin exposure since the company announced in November 2017 that it would facilitate BTC trading for customers, according to Berenberg analyst Mark Palmer.\n\n\u201cThere are more equities that provide that kind of exposure now, but Block stands out because of its high profile and large market capitalization,\u201d Palmer told Blockworks.\n\nStock prices with a correlation to bitcoin higher than Block\u2019s 0.61 correlation include Coinbase and MicroStrategy \u2014 at 0.93 and 0.90, respectively, he added.\n\nRead more: Will MicroStrategy ever stop buying bitcoin?\n\nBlock officially launched bitcoin trading on Cash App in 2018. The total sale amount of bitcoin sold to customers of the mobile payment service during this year\u2019s second quarter jumped 34% year over year to $2.39 billion.\n\nThe company invested $50 million in bitcoin during the final quarter of 2020 and an additional $170 million in the crypto asset during the first three months of 2021. The fair value of the company\u2019s bitcoin investment was $245 million, as of June 30.\n\nBlock\u2019s affiliates include Spiral, an independent team focused on open-source work around the Bitcoin blockchain and TBD, a builder of decentralized platforms, protocols and tools.\n\nStill, Cash App reported just $44 million in gross profit from bitcoin transactions in the second quarter \u2014 a fraction of its total gross profit was $968 million in the three-month span.\n\nThe bitcoin that Block held on its balance sheet at the mid-year point \u2014 when adjusted for fair market value \u2014 represented 0.79% of its total assets, Berenberg analysts said.\n\n\u201cThe impact of bitcoin on Block\u2019s operating performance is not all that significant at this point,\u201d the Wednesday Berenberg note states.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "2 'Strong Buy' Bitcoin Stocks Under $5 With Triple-Digit Upside Potential - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Since coming on the scene, cryptocurrencies have fired the imaginations of online traders, currency speculators, and mathematicians alike. The leading digital currency, bitcoin, is currently priced at approximately $26,550 per coin, representing a ~60% increase year-to-date. And it looks like bitcoin will see a strong upward pressure on that price over the next year.\n\nThe bitcoin algorithm has a built-in halving mechanism, whereby the reward given to miners for solving a blockchain link is cut in half. The process takes place about every four years, and is next expected in May of 2024. The bitcoin halving has happened regularly since 2012, and has historically had a positive effect on the digital currency\u2019s price, as well as on the share prices of bitcoin-related stocks.\n\nThat last gives investors a chance to get in early. The predictability and regularity of the bitcoin halving makes now the right time to start looking into bitcoin stocks, to find an attractive point of entry well before this catalyst takes place. Wall Street\u2019s analysts can help with this; they\u2019ve been pointing out solid choices among the bitcoin mining companies, anticipating a rise in price.\n\nA quick look at the TipRanks data shows that their latest picks have several common attributes that should bring in investors. We\u2019ll look at two bitcoin mining stocks, each currently priced under $5 per share, and boasting a \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 consensus rating. Additionally, some are projecting triple-digit upside potential for the coming year. Here are the details.\n\nBitfarms (BITF)\n\nWe\u2019ll start with Bitfarms, a bitcoin mining company headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, and operating with 11 bitcoin mining facilities \u2013 farms, as the company calls them \u2013 located in 4 countries. The company has approximately 56,200 mining rigs deployed. Bitfarms can boast a hashrate of 5.6 EH/s, and generates an average of 12.4 bitcoins per day.\n\nBitcoin mining won\u2019t happen without power, and bitcoin miners also operate the large-scale power generation facilities needed to support their data center operations. Bitfarms has 240 megawatts of power generation planned, and this past August the company announced the start of a 50 megawatt deployment plan, located in Paraguay, for the generation of hydroelectric power. The plan is the first phase from a set of contracts totaling 150 megawatts in hydropower development. The current phase is located near Bitfarms\u2019 existing Paraguay facility, and is expected to go online in 1Q24.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, Bitfarms is expanding its Argentina operations. The company added 3,150 modern mining rigs to its Rio Cuarto facility, and has planned deliveries for another 1,068 rigs, scheduled for installation this month.\n\nBitfarms\u2019 activity to expand its power generation and farming network is bringing results. The company\u2019s 2Q23 financial report showed that the company mined 1,223 bitcoins during the quarter, and its hashrate, as of June 30, was up 10% from Q1 and stood at 5.3 EH/s. That hashrate alone shows one measure of the company\u2019s expansion \u2013 two months later, in August, the hashrate was up to 5.6 EH/s. The company has targeted a 7.0 EH/s hashrate for the first quarter of next year.\n\nIn a recent update for August\u2019s production numbers, Bitfarms reported mining 383 bitcoins during the month. This was up from 378 mined in July, although it was down from 534 bitcoins generated in August of last year. The 383 figure was in-line with Bitfarms\u2019 monthly production during the first 8 months of this year \u2013 and the year-to-date total of 3,281 bitcoins is higher than the equivalent figure, 3,252, from last year. Of the bitcoins mined in August, Bitfarms sold off 323, generating $9 million in total proceeds. The remaining 60 bitcoins were added to the company\u2019s treasury, increasing its holding to 654 bitcoins. Bitfarms valued this holding at $17.8 million, based on the August 31 price.\n\nAccording to Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Josh Siegler, Bitfarms has plenty of strength as it heads into next year, which investors might be overlooking right now. He writes, \u201cWe continue to believe the Bitfarms story may be under-appreciated by investors. The company has demonstrated substantial progress in establishing a clear line-of-sight for near-term growth and improving its cash expenses, in our view. With a strong balance sheet and higher visibility to energizing Argentina, we believe BITF may be unfairly receiving a discount on its valuation relative to peers. If Bitfarms achieves its near-term hash target \u2026 while demonstrating improved free cash flow and unit economics, we believe there may be significant upside to the stock price.\u201d\n\nSignificant upside, indeed. Along with an Overweight (Buy) rating on the shares, Seigler\u2019s $3 price target implies a robust upside potential of 168% for the next 12 months. (To watch Siegler\u2019s track record, click here.)\n\nThe Street would appear to be in agreement, as all 3 of the recent analyst reviews are positive, for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are currently priced at $1.12, and the average price target of $3.67 is even more bullish than Siegler\u2019s, indicating potential for a 228% gain over the coming year. (See Bitfarms\u2019 stock forecast.)\n\nCipher Mining (CIFR)\n\nNext up is Cipher Mining, another growing concern in the bitcoin mining industry. Cipher is a US-based firm currently in the process of building out its primary mining facility, in Odessa, Texas, which came online in November of last year. The facility is scheduled to reach completion before the end of this quarter, which will bring Cipher\u2019s total bitcoin mining hashrate to 7.2 EH/s. The company reported a total hashrate of 6.8 EH/s as of the end of 2Q23.\n\nCipher has two additional mining facilities, both wind-powered, located in Alborz, Texas and Bear and Chief, Texas. These sites can operate at 40 and 20 megawatts respectively. Among its three active sites, the company has 68,000 miners deployed, and at the end of August this year had a potential capacity to mine as many as 16.1 bitcoins per day.\n\nIn the firm\u2019s most recent production update, for August of this year, Cipher reported mining a total of 357 bitcoins. This was down 15% month-over-month, and after sales of 355 bitcoin, the company had an account balance of 519 bitcoin available. At an estimated price of $27,000 per bitcoin, this holding is worth over $14 million. Cipher management reports that the company is on track to meet its current expansion and production goals.\n\nWhile Cipher\u2019s core business is bitcoin mining, the company is also building out its power generation capacity \u2013 and that has caught the attention of BTIG analyst Gregory Lewis. He sees the company\u2019s potential as a net-seller of electricity as a clear benefit, complementing the firm\u2019s success at entering low-cost power contracts, and writes, \u201cThe company has a very low-cost fixed-price power purchase agreement at ~$0.027/kWh (expires 2027) with the ability to opportunistically sell electricity back to the grid. Cipher has one of the lowest cost structures in the BTC mining industry creating attractive unit economics allowing the business to operate through the cycle. In the near term, Cipher\u2019s core business should remain BTC mining, but longer term we see the opportunity to become a more integrated player in the energy-generation space.\u201d\n\nTaking this forward, Lewis puts a Buy rating on CIFR, and his $6 price target points toward a potential one-year gain of 124% for the stock. (To watch Lewis\u2019 track record, click here.)\n\nThe analyst consensus view on Cipher is unanimous, a Strong Buy based on 6 positive ratings set over the past 3 months. The stock has a $5.25 average price target, suggesting a 96% increase from the current share price of $2.68. (See Cipher\u2019s stock forecast.)\n\nTo find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks\u2019 Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks\u2019 equity insights.\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

        "title": "The Evolution of Bitcoin Wallets: From the Early Days to Today's Modern Solutions - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Since its conception in 2009, Bitcoin, a revolutionary digital money, has advanced significantly. The development of Bitcoin wallets has been astounding along with the rise of Bitcoin. It has been a wonderful journey from simple solutions to the sophisticated and feature-rich wallets we have today. We'll go into the fascinating past of Bitcoin wallets in this post, and we'll also look at how they've changed to accommodate the demands of modern cryptocurrency fans.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nSince the beginning of cryptocurrencies, bitcoin wallets have seen tremendous development.\n\nModern systems now provide improved convenience, security, and user-friendly features.\n\nUsers may choose a wallet with more knowledge if they are aware of the evolution of Bitcoin wallets.\n\nBitcoin Wallet: A Private Digital Safe\n\nPhoto by DrawKit Illustrations on Unsplash\n\nLet's first define a Bitcoin wallet before starting our time travel adventure. A Bitcoin wallet is a software program or physical object that enables users to securely store, transmit, and receive bitcoin. Your private keys, which are necessary for accessing your Bitcoin assets, are stored in it as a virtual vault. It would be nearly difficult to conduct Bitcoin transactions without a wallet.\n\nFun fact: Did you know that Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic person who invented Bitcoin, carried out the first transaction? On January 12, 2009, he gave developer Hal Finney 10 bitcoins, thus launching the cryptocurrency.\n\nPaper Wallets and Simple Software Wallets in the Beginning\n\nSecurity was a major issue in the early days of Bitcoin. To store their private and public keys, users depended on paper wallets, which were simply printouts. The keys were stored offline, away from any online threats, in these paper wallets, making them safe. They were inconvenient, though, because each transaction needed human key input.\n\nInteresting fact: On May 22, 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz created history by carrying out the first Bitcoin transaction in the real world. He spent 10,000 bitcoins, or millions of dollars in today's currency, to buy two pizzas.\n\n\n\nBasic software wallets soon followed, offering a more user-friendly interface. Users could easily manage their Bitcoin on their PCs with the help of these wallets, which were easy to install. To avoid data loss, they needed to be constantly backed up and were susceptible to virus assaults.\n\nMobile Wallets: Access to Bitcoin Anywhere\n\nPhoto by CardMapr.nl on Unsplash\n\nWith the popularity of smartphones, Bitcoin wallets appeared on portable electronics, enabling users to carry their digital assets with them wherever they went. Mobile wallets made using Bitcoin more convenient and opened the door for regular transactions.\n\nFun fact: In 2013, James Howells, a programmer, mistakenly threw away a hard drive containing his Bitcoin wallet. The hard disk was eventually dumped in a landfill, where it is still today. Over 7,500 bitcoins, worth millions of dollars, are thought to be in the misplaced wallet.\n\nAccessing Bitcoin Anywhere, Anytime with Web Wallets\n\nThe ability to access money from any internet-connected device thanks to web wallets transformed the Bitcoin experience. Users no longer had to bother about backups or install software. They may use a web browser to safely access their Bitcoin, making it simpler for beginners to enter the cryptocurrency realm.\n\nInteresting fact: In 2014, Mt. Gox, previously the biggest Bitcoin exchange, experienced a significant security breach that cost the company around 850,000 bitcoins. The significance of security precautions in safeguarding Bitcoin wallets was brought home by this occurrence.\n\nHardware Wallets: The Bitcoin Fort Knox\n\nHardware wallets became the most safe choice as Bitcoin's value skyrocketed and security worries multiplied. These tangible objects protect private keys from potential internet attacks by storing them offline. Hardware wallets offer an additional degree of security for your Bitcoin by being resistant to hacker attempts.\n\n\n\n\n\nFun fact: By the end of 2020, more than 1.5 million pieces of the Ledger Nano S, one of the most popular hardware wallets, had been sold.\n\nFeature-Rich and User-Friendly Modern\n\nSolutionsPhoto by Shubham Dhage on Unsplash\n\n\n\nBitcoin wallets have become sophisticated, feature-rich solutions in modern times. They provide seamless exchange integration, support for several currencies, biometric identification, and improved user interfaces. Some wallets even let users to engage in decentralized finance (DeFi) systems and earn interest on their Bitcoin holdings.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom its inception to the present, Bitcoin wallets have had an amazing journey. Wallets have improved in security, practicality, and use with each new development. It's important to keep in mind, though, that in the end, it's your obligation to protect your Bitcoin. To guarantee the safety of your digital riches, keep educated, follow best practices, and select a wallet that fits your demands. Wallets are incredibly important in the fascinating world of Bitcoin. Your Bitcoin adventure awaits, whether you choose a stylish mobile wallet or the strong security of a hardware wallet.\n\nThis is a guest post by Ethan Reed.

        "content": "This month\u2019s steep decline in Bitcoin trading volume on Binance is likely tied in part to the end of another zero-fee promotion by the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nThe seven-day average volume has dropped by 26% since the start of September, according to researcher CCData. On Sept. 7, the exchange halted an incentive that allowed customers to trade between Bitcoin and the TrueUSD stablecoin without a fee. The seven-day average volume for that so-called trading pair has dropped 89% since the inducement expired."

        "title": "How to buy Bitcoin with Venmo - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Venmo, a versatile financial application, provides a range of features, including peer-to-peer (P2P) money transfers and cryptocurrency transactions. Serving as a comprehensive financial tool, Venmo enables users to seamlessly handle transactions, including the option to participate in digital currencies like Bitcoin (BTC). The app is designed to simplify financial operations and assist users in navigating contemporary economic systems.\n\nWhat is Venmo?\n\nVenmo, a mobile payment service established in 2009, has been under PayPal\u2019s ownership since 2013. It operates as a P2P platform for money transfers within the United States. The social payment app facilitates money exchanges between users and businesses. Additionally, it functions as a digital wallet that enables individuals to accumulate funds within their Venmo accounts for future expenses.\n\nVenmo also extends its capabilities by integrating cryptocurrency transactions, enabling users to buy, sell and hold digital assets within the app. Following a similar initiative by its parent company, PayPal, this feature was introduced in April 2021. Venmo users in the U.S., excluding Hawaii, can engage with four cryptocurrencies: BTC, Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). In the future, Venmo has plans to incorporate the PayPal USD stablecoin (PYUSD).\n\nBuy Bitcoin with Venmo\n\nTo purchase Bitcoin with Venmo, users can use their Venmo balance, bank account or debit card, among other payment methods. However, it\u2019s important to recall that credit cards and Venmo Credit Cards cannot be used to complete these transactions. Moreover, users are restricted from making crypto purchases through Venmo. Users are limited to a weekly cap of $20,000 and a yearly cap of $50,000 in crypto acquisitions.\n\nSince cryptocurrencies are digital currencies, buying them involves exchanging one currency for another. The exchange rate determines the amount of Bitcoin users receive in exchange for U.S. dollars. Keep in mind that cryptocurrency values are highly volatile and change frequently.\n\nSteps to buying Bitcoin through Venmo\n\nOpen the Venmo app and navigate to the \u201cCrypto\u201d tab at the bottom of the menu.\n\nSelect \u201cBitcoin (BTC)\u201d from the list of cryptocurrencies. The current exchange price of Bitcoin is also available on the page.\n\nClick \u201cBuy\u201d at the bottom of the page.\n\nEnter the dollar amount to buy in BTC and tap the \u201cReview\u201d button. This step confirms purchase details, such as bank account, exchange rate and transaction fee, before finalizing the transaction.\n\nThe app will provide a breakdown of the amount of Bitcoin to be purchased, along with any associated fees.\n\nOnce satisfied with the details, tap the \u201cBuy\u201d button to complete the Bitcoin purchase through Venmo.\n\nAfter completing a purchase, crypto acquired through Venmo becomes irreversible. This implies that users have to sell their digital currencies to regain U.S. dollars. It\u2019s also important to note that Venmo does not provide compensation to users for any losses caused by price fluctuations.\n\nAfter successfully purchasing Bitcoin through the Venmo app, users can conveniently track its price fluctuations within the app itself. The app also provides historical price data for the selected cryptocurrency, including past transactions involving that digital asset.\n\nSteps to track the current market price of Bitcoin in Venmo\n\nIn Venmo, the current price of Bitcoin can be tracked using following steps:\n\nVenmo\u2019s app is equipped to monitor cryptocurrency prices in real-time, with updates occurring every few seconds. By default, it uses a line graph to show price movements over a 24-hour period. The time frame for price changes can be switched to one week, one month, six months, a year or the entire lifespan of the cryptocurrency selected. Tapping on the timeline graph provides more specific values over time.\n\nVenmo fees for purchasing Bitcoin\n\nAcquiring cryptocurrencies through Venmo involves fees based on the purchase\u2019s size, with transparent fee disclosure during transactions. These fees consist of the spread between the market price from Venmo\u2019s trading service provider, Paxos, and the USD-to-crypto exchange rate, along with a transaction fee associated with buying crypto assets. Venmo discloses both rates during crypto transactions, with an estimated 0.50% spread, subject to market conditions.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to note that Venmo doesn\u2019t detail the specific spread earned on each transaction. By utilizing Venmo\u2019s crypto services, users agree to cover all relevant exchange rates, including the spread and the associated fees.\n\nAdditionally, if a linked bank account or debit card is used as the funding source for purchasing crypto assets, additional bank fees, such as overdraft charges, may be imposed. Venmo doesn\u2019t bear responsibility for bank-imposed fees, so it\u2019s important to understand a bank\u2019s fee policies when using these funding sources for crypto transactions.\n\nWho can buy Bitcoin with Venmo?\n\nTo buy Bitcoin with Venmo, the app needs to be accessed, and specific user criteria must be met:\n\nAge requirement: Users must be at least 18 years old.\n\nLocation: Cryptocurrency services are accessible to users physically present within the U.S., except for Hawaii.\n\nPayment methods: Either a Venmo balance, bank account or debit card is needed.\n\nUnique cell phone number: Users need a unique U.S. cell phone number not associated with another Venmo account.\n\nAnyone who fulfills these prerequisites is eligible to create a Venmo account and can proceed with acquiring Bitcoin. To access cryptocurrency transaction services on Venmo, a user\u2019s identity must be verified. This verification process includes providing essential information such as a Social Security number or an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number. Furthermore, these services are exclusively accessible for personal Venmo profiles and are not supported for business or charity profiles.\n\nPrice Alerts in Venmo\n\nTo stay informed about Bitcoin market movements, Venmo\u2019s Crypto Price Alerts can assist in monitoring and responding to crypto price fluctuations, assisting in making timely and informed decisions in this dynamic financial landscape. When activating crypto price alerts, push notifications will be sent when the chosen cryptocurrency\u2019s price experiences a daily percentage change.\n\nIt\u2019s important not to rely solely on them for cryptocurrency-related decisions. Crypto price alerts may experience delays or disruptions due to market conditions and data interruptions. Thus, verifying any information received through a price alert before making decisions is advisable.\n\nTo set up Bitcoin price alerts in Venmo:\n\nNavigate to the \u201cCrypto\u201d tab.\n\nSelect \u201cBitcoin.\u201d\n\nActivate price alerts using the Price Alerts toggle.\n\nOnce activated, specify the desired percentage for price fluctuations, which can be adjusted as necessary.\n\nIf identity verification with Venmo is already complete and an account is configured for cryptocurrency activities, it\u2019ll be possible to subscribe to price alerts while purchasing Bitcoin.\n\nSecurity and safety measures in Venmo\n\nVenmo employs data encryption technology to safeguard users from unauthorized transactions, ensuring user information is securely stored on protected servers. The mobile payment service also allows users to log out of their Venmo accounts on lost or stolen phones, set up personal identification numbers (PINs) for mobile applications, and enable two-factor authentication (2FA).\n\nDespite Venmo\u2019s security protocols, users should be aware of potential risks, including scams and fraud by cybercriminals. Although the source of these risks might not be attributed to the payment application itself, the resulting implications may directly impact Venmo users. It\u2019s crucial never to share login details, use strong passwords, set accounts to private, and transact only with trusted individuals and businesses.\n\nAccording to research findings, Venmo publicly reveals all peer-to-peer transactions by default, with the exception of the transaction amount, which could possibly disclose sensitive user information in certain instances. In 2018, the company reached an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission to address multiple privacy and security concerns related to this and other aspects, leading to corresponding setting adjustments. Nevertheless, Venmo remained under scrutiny for potentially exposing users to privacy vulnerabilities.\n\nDrawbacks to buying Bitcoin with Venmo\n\nBuying Bitcoin through Venmo presents certain drawbacks to consider. Firstly, Venmo\u2019s Purchase Protection doesn\u2019t extend to cryptocurrency purchases, leaving users vulnerable to losses stemming from cryptocurrency price fluctuations. While unauthorized activity is safeguarded, Bitcoin transactions on Venmo are irreversible, underscoring the need for thorough research and cautious decision-making.\n\nUnlike traditional banks, Venmo\u2019s Bitcoin and investment balances lack protection by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Securities Investor Protection Corporation\n\n(SIPC) or any other public or private insurance. Consequently, funds held within the app are not protected as they would be in a bank account, making Venmo an insecure choice for storing substantial cryptocurrency holdings.\n\nAdditionally, any currency or asset acquired on Venmo remains limited to the platform, making it impossible to transfer crypto to other platforms or personal accounts. This limitation can be restrictive for those who prefer to hold their coins in digital wallets or explore different trading options."

        "title": "Better Buy: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Despite recent volatility in the crypto markets, Bitcoin (BTC -1.17%) and Ethereum (ETH -1.64%) remain two of the best-performing large-market-cap cryptos. For the year, Bitcoin is now up 65% while Ethereum is up 40%.\n\nBased on recent performance, Bitcoin would seem to be the obvious better buy. But just remember -- past performance is no guarantee of future performance. If you are a long-term investor, you need to keep your eye on future developments as well. With that in mind, there are three key factors that could determine which crypto is the better buy over the long haul.\n\nFlow of institutional money\n\nThe most important factor remains the flow of institutional money into the crypto asset class. Currently, Bitcoin appears to have a massive edge over Ethereum, with many institutional investors viewing it as a \"safe haven\" asset that can protect them from volatility in the broader market. We saw this scenario play itself out earlier this year, when a regional banking crisis in the U.S. immediately led to a flow of new money into Bitcoin, which in turn led to rapid price gains.\n\nMoreover, this entire summer seemed to be dominated by one single topic: the launch of the first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF. This led to a mini-rally for Bitcoin in mid-June, as investors recalibrated what it could mean for institutional investor flows into crypto if the SEC finally signs off on a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHere, too, Bitcoin seems to have the edge over Ethereum, since there seems to be much more investor appetite for a spot Bitcoin ETF than a spot Ethereum ETF. As long as that remains the case, there will likely be more institutional money flowing into Bitcoin than Ethereum.\n\nUser adoption rates\n\nThe next major factor to keep in mind is user adoption rates. The big-picture view here is that, as both Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to go mainstream, they will both likely see a massive surge in their built-in user bases. So which blockchain is set to grow at a faster pace in coming years?\n\nFor Bitcoin, some of the best user adoption rate numbers come from Cathie Wood and Ark Invest, which released a research report this year with a set of scenarios to describe how Bitcoin usage will increase between now and the year 2030. In a base-case scenario, for example, Bitcoin could soon account for 3% of the M2 money supply of emerging market nations, 10% of the remittance asset market, and 2.5% of all institutional assets. Over time, these percentages could grow even higher, as Bitcoin increasingly goes mainstream around the world.\n\nIn the case of Ethereum, the best user adoption rate numbers typically come from valuation models based on Metcalfe's Law, which states that the value of any network is directly proportional to the square of the number of users on it. This law has been used to model the valuation of telecom and internet companies, and now it is being used to model the valuation of cryptocurrencies. Thus, it's very possible that Ethereum's future valuation could be quadratic, not linear, in nature as more users are added to its ecosystem.\n\nThe easiest place to see the impact of this growth happening is in the Layer 2 space, which describes all of the blockchains that are building directly on top of the main Ethereum blockchain. By some accounts, Ethereum's total market capitalization should be $250 billion right now, not $200 billion, if you calculate all of the extra user activity that is happening on Layer 2 blockchain networks. In short, Ethereum could be undervalued by as much as 25% right now.\n\nTechnological improvements\n\nIf there's one area where Ethereum has a decided edge, it's in the technology supporting its blockchain. Whereas Bitcoin is built on old, proof-of-work technology that requires expensive, energy-intensive mining, Ethereum recently transitioned to new, proof-of-stake technology that does not require mining at all. As soon as Ethereum pulled off The Merge last year, it immediately became 99.9% more energy-efficient.\n\nAnd Ethereum is hardly resting on its laurels. As founder Vitalik Buterin has pointed out, Ethereum still has at least five new cycles of technological improvement incoming, all of which will finally lead to the creation of a super-fast, super-efficient \"Ethereum 2.0.\" When that happens, Ethereum will become one of the fastest, most secure transaction networks in the world.\n\nAnd the winner is...\n\nCrypto investors for years have been looking forward to \"the flippening\" -- the moment in time when Ethereum finally overtakes (i.e., \"flips\") Bitcoin as the most valuable crypto in the world. For that to happen, Ethereum's future growth needs to outpace Bitcoin's future growth by a significant margin.\n\nBased on the above, it's possible to see such a scenario taking place. But for now, I'm sticking with Bitcoin, which currently accounts for approximately 50% of the total market value of the entire crypto market. As long as Bitcoin remains the clear favorite option of both retail and institutional investors, it's likely to outpace Ethereum as the better buy going forward."

        "title": "Bitcoin's Resilience in the Face of Challenges: Lessons from Recent Events - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency sector is sometimes fraught with upheaval, yet maybe no digital asset exemplifies resilience more than Bitcoin. Bitcoin has encountered various hurdles throughout its existence, ranging from regulatory scrutiny to market crashes, yet it has continually survived these storms and emerged stronger. In this article, we look at recent events that put Bitcoin to the test and extract useful lessons for investors, enthusiasts, and the broader financial industry.\n\nA Brief History of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin, created in 2008 in a whitepaper by an unnamed entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto, was launched to the world as the first decentralized cryptocurrency in 2009. Many people were captivated by its revolutionary use of blockchain technology and the promise of a borderless, censorship-resistant, and decentralized money.\n\nBitcoin's price has fluctuated dramatically throughout the years, owing to market sentiment, technological advancements, and macroeconomic considerations. It has gone through several market cycles, each with its own set of obstacles and possibilities.\n\nRecent Events Put Resilience to the Test\n\nRegulatory Difficulties\n\nGovernments and regulatory agencies around the world have been debating how to classify and regulate cryptocurrencies in recent years. Increased inspection was prompted by concerns about money laundering, fraud, and consumer protection. Because Bitcoin is the most prominent cryptocurrency, it has found itself at the center of these debates.\n\nLearning Experience\n\nBitcoin's decentralized nature and broad user base have made it resistant to regulatory scrutiny. The lessons presented center on the significance of compliance, openness, and interaction with regulatory bodies. Long-term sustainability requires collaboration between the cryptocurrency sector and policymakers.\n\nVolatility and Market Corrections\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has seen tremendous swings, with high volatility becoming a defining feature. Market corrections, in which prices fall after making significant advances, have occurred several times. These occurrences can upset investor confidence and put long-term investors to the test.\n\nLesson Learned\n\nBitcoin's resiliency in the face of volatility emphasizes the significance of maintaining a long-term view. Investors who survived previous price declines frequently benefited from later price recovery. Risk management and diversification are critical techniques for handling the price volatility of Bitcoin.\n\nSecurity Breach\n\nWhile Bitcoin's blockchain technology is extremely secure, third-party services such as exchanges and wallets have been subject to security breaches and hacks. Large amounts of Bitcoin have been stolen as a result of these instances.\n\nProtecting Bitcoin holdings necessitates a proactive approach to security. It is critical to use secure wallets, hardware wallets, and follow best practices for protecting private keys. It is also critical to exercise caution while selecting cryptocurrency service providers.\n\nMacro Events and Economic Uncertainty\n\nBitcoin has acquired popularity as a digital gold store, particularly during times of economic uncertainty. Events like as the COVID-19 epidemic and inflation fears have added to Bitcoin's allure as a hedge against traditional financial insecurity.\n\nLesson Learned: Bitcoin's resiliency in the face of macroeconomic events highlights the currency's potential position in diversified investment portfolios. While its connection with traditional assets is still being debated, its lack of correlation during crises shows its significance as a potential hedge.\n\nTechnological Advancements\n\nThe underlying technology of Bitcoin has evolved over time. Scalability difficulties have been addressed by innovations such as the Lightning Network, which has improved transaction efficiency. These advancements demonstrate Bitcoin's versatility and dedication to continuous progress.\n\nThe willingness of Bitcoin to adapt and embrace technological innovations is critical to its continued relevance. To address scalability, security, and usability issues, the cryptocurrency sector must stay agile and responsive.\n\nGrowing Institutional Interest\n\nInstitutional investors and corporations are beginning to see Bitcoin as a viable asset class. Companies such as Tesla and Square have devoted considerable amounts of their treasuries to Bitcoin, indicating the currency's rising acceptance in mainstream banking.\n\nThe acceptance of Bitcoin by institutions demonstrates its development as an asset. Institutional participation can help to stabilize and liquidate the market. Investors should keep an eye on institutional developments because they have the potential to greatly influence Bitcoin's direction.\n\nWhy Decentralization Matters: Crypto Companies Consider Leaving the US Amid Regulatory Crackdown\n\nIn response to increasing regulatory scrutiny in the United States, particularly on cryptocurrency exchanges, many American crypto companies are exploring international expansion or even relocating their operations abroad. This shift comes as the U.S. has become one of the most stringent cryptocurrency regulators globally, with several recent enforcement actions by the SEC and other agencies.\n\n6 key points on this evolving landscape:\n\nRegulatory crackdown: Recent law enforcement actions and regulatory crackdowns have made the U.S. a challenging environment for crypto companies. The SEC filed a lawsuit against Coinbase, alleging that it marketed securities without proper registration. Binance, an international crypto exchange, was also sued by the SEC, leading to its founder being banned from the U.S. securities market. Changing industry sentiment: The crypto industry, once seen as a decentralized system beyond government control, has increasingly sought legitimacy through cooperation with regulators. However, these efforts have often failed to meet regulators' expectations. International expansion: Many American crypto firms are considering expanding into international markets or relocating entirely. Locations such as the Cayman Islands, London, Bermuda, Hong Kong, and Dubai are being explored. Mining companies flocking to the U.S.: In contrast, companies specializing in Bitcoin mining, which requires significant energy resources, are attracted to the U.S. due to its access to cheap electricity. Ongoing tensions and Coinbase\u2019s role: Tensions between the crypto industry and U.S. regulators have been escalating since Gary Gensler, a crypto critic, became SEC Chairman. Disagreements over classifying cryptocurrencies as securities and disclosure requirements have fueled this tension. Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto company, has been at the center of the regulatory debate. Despite its efforts to cooperate with regulators, it has repeatedly faced challenges from federal regulators. Coinbase has started expanding its international presence, opening an exchange in Bermuda. This move allows foreign users to engage in high-risk trades prohibited in the U.S. Startup opportunity: Smaller crypto startups find international relocation more appealing, offering flexibility and a potentially friendlier regulatory environment.\n\nWhile the crypto industry continues to navigate regulatory challenges, it remains to be seen how companies will balance their global ambitions with the evolving regulatory landscape in the United States.\n\nEnvironmental Concerns\n\nThe energy usage and carbon footprint of Bitcoin have been debated and criticized. Concerns about its environmental impact have sparked debate over the long-term viability of its mining operations.\n\nThe response of Bitcoin to environmental concerns will be critical to its long-term existence. These concerns can be addressed through innovations in energy-efficient mining and increased utilization of renewable energy sources. Bitcoin's future depends on sustainability and responsible mining operations.\n\nBitcoin's Future: A Resilient Journey Continues\n\nBitcoin's tenacity in the face of a slew of problems indicates both its continuing popularity and the strength of decentralized digital assets. While it may encounter new challenges in the future, the lessons acquired from its previous experiences can help investors and the greater cryptocurrency sector.\n\nAs Bitcoin progresses, it will very certainly remain a symbol of innovation, decentralization, and financial sovereignty. Its tenacity in the face of hardship demonstrates the power of blockchain technology and decentralized currencies to reshape the financial world. As they negotiate the ever-changing world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, investors and fans alike must be cautious, adaptive, and knowledgeable."

        "content": "Mt. Gox\u2019s infamous 2014 security breach \u2014 which lost 850,000 Bitcoin (BTC) of investors\u2019 funds \u2014 resulted in its users embarking on a seemingly never-ending, decade-long pursuit of closure via funds reimbursement.\n\nOver the years, Mt. Gox has repeatedly postponed plans to reimburse the funds that the crypto exchange had barred its users from withdrawing since Feb. 25, 2014.\n\nLatest notice concerning the change of repayment deadlines. Source: Mtgox.com\n\nHowever, with Mt. Gox postponing its repayment deadlines by one more year, from Oct. 31, 2023, to Oct. 31, 2024, the wait for redressal extends into the 11th year for Mt. Gox investors.\n\nMt. Gox 2014: The year of the largest Bitcoin hack (Avg. BTC price $420)\n\nDays after Mt. Gox lost 850,000 BTC in the February 2014 breach, leaked documents revealed that the crypto exchange became insolvent. It read:\n\n\u201cThe cold storage has been wiped out due to a leak in the hot wallet. The reality is that MtGox can go bankrupt at any moment, and certainly deserves to as a company.\u201d\n\nIt was generally assumed that the fall of Mt. Gox would mean the end for Bitcoin, considering that the exchange managed 70% of the total circulating Bitcoin at the time. Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo District Court, Japan, after losing nearly $500,000 in value.\n\nThe exchange was soon hit by numerous lawsuits as investors feared the possibility of Mt. Gox\u2019s intention to return investors\u2019 funds. The sentiment of mistrust grew over the year as Mt. Gox revealed no plans for reimbursement while deleting its website and social media presence.\n\nMt. Gox 2015: Back and forth with Tokyo court (Avg. BTC price $260)\n\nAmid its ongoing bankruptcy proceedings in Tokyo District Court, Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpel\u00e8s was arrested without charge for 23 days by the Japanese police for allegedly manipulating the computer system to inflate his account. Authorities found it hard to link criminals to crypto crimes due to the lack of cryptocurrency regulations.\n\nOn April 22, 2015, Mt. Gox\u2019s bankruptcy trustee, Nobuaki Kobayashi, instructed users to file a claim for their missing Bitcoin via mail or a form that could be accessed with a Mt. Gox login and password.\n\nIt was believed that Mt. Gox would return around 20% of the users\u2019 funds, considering the fall in Bitcoin\u2019s market price.\n\nMt. Gox 2016: Investors go through the claim process (Avg. BTC price $620)\n\nMt. Gox revealed that only $91 million in assets were slated to be distributed to claimants. However, not all investors agreed with Mt. Gox\u2019s alleged plans to reimburse a small portion of funds. As a result, the total claims for reimbursement reached $2.4 trillion, even though the loss was around $500,000.\n\nThis was also the year when the idea of storing cryptocurrencies in cold wallets got much-needed attention from the crypto community.\n\nAfter being arrested twice in 2015 under the allegations of embezzlement of $3 million of customers money, Karpel\u00e8s was released from jail on July 13, 2016, after paying a bail bond of nearly $100,000.\n\nMt. Gox 2017: Legal struggles and introduction of Karpeles coin (Avg. BTC price $5,000)\n\nDiscussions around funds reimbursement were overshadowed by the legal proceedings against former Mt. Gox CEO Karpel\u00e8s\u2019 involvement in funds embezzlement.\n\nKarpeles admits operating Willy bot, now called an \"obligation exchange\", but says it was for good of company so not illegal #KarpelesTrial \u2014 Kolin Burges (@The_K_meister) July 11, 2017\n\nDuring the trial, Karpel\u00e8s admitted to operating a so-called \u201cWilly Bot\u201d (obligation exchange). The bot earned its name from Mt. Gox traders concerned about the manipulation of the exchange\u2019s volumes at its peak.\n\nOn Nov. 28, 2017, Karpel\u00e8s introduced his plans to conduct an initial coin offering (ICO) to raise $245 million to \u201crevive\u201d Mt. Gox. However, Karpeles discarded the decision after learning about the legal hurdles around launching an ICO campaign.\n\nMt. Gox 2018: A slow year for creditors (Avg. BTC price $7,000)\n\nFollowing a strong price recovery in 2017, on Aug. 1, 2018, Mt. Gox revised its basic policy for preparing a rehabilitation plan. It read:\n\n\u201cMt. Gox is not capable of returning all BTC deposited by creditors. Accordingly, we consider that all assets of Mt. Gox should be distributed to creditors and not to shareholders.\u201d\n\nAt the time, the exchange believed that most of the assets, including approximately 166,000 BTC and 168,000 of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and other derivatives currently held by Mt. Gox, should be paid to creditors at the time of the first payment.\n\nDespite the ongoing discussion, a resolution was never reached that could satisfy legal and creditors\u2019 requirements.\n\nMt. Gox 2019: Plan extensions and delays (Avg. BTC price $8,000)\n\nThe anticipation around Mt. Gox peaked as a rehabilitation plan was seemingly underway.\n\nMt. Gox extends deadlines for rehabilitation plans. Source: Mt. Gox\n\nHowever, Mt. Gox requested the Tokyo court to extend the deadline for the submission of the rehabilitation plan. On Oct. 25, 2019, the Tokyo District Court issued an order to extend the deadline for a rehabilitation plan from Oct. 28, 2019, to March 31, 2020.\n\nMt. Gox 2020: Plan extensions and delays (Avg. BTC price $11,000)\n\nGoing against the five-year-long trend of delaying reimbursements to users, in early 2020, New York-based private equity firm Fortress offered to buy out creditor claims from Mt. Gox. Had the deal gone through, eligible creditors would have received $1,293 for every Bitcoin they owned on the exchange\u2019s wallet.\n\nBy March, Mt. Gox issued yet another draft rehabilitation plan, which revealed its plans to liquidate cryptocurrencies other than BTC and BCH. However, investors were made to wait much longer after the Tokyo court approved Mt. Gox\u2019s request for another extension, citing \u201cmatters that require closer examination.\u201d\n\nThe court heeded the motion, thereby postponing the Mt. Gox Bitcoin settlement date to Oct. 15, 2020, which was later pushed further into the next year.\n\nMt. Gox 2021: Bitcoin bull run creates hopium (Avg. BTC price $37,000)\n\nOn Oct 20, 2021, Mt. Gox creditors approved a rehabilitation plan to compensate them for billions in lost Bitcoin. According to Mt. Gox trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi, roughly 99% of the creditors affected by the collapse sided with the latest reimbursement plans.\n\nWith Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of $69,000, it was popularly believed that the value held in Mt. Gox\u2019s Bitcoin stash could suffice to reimburse complete losses for the investors.\n\nAmid positive investor sentiment, users awaited further instructions while waiting for the approved plans to unfold.\n\nMt. Gox 2022: Registrations for reimbursement contiues (Avg. BTC price $42,000)\n\nThe enthusiasm from 2021 seeped into 2022 as investors lined up to provide details for registering repayment methods.\n\nMt. Gox shares repayment method plans. Source: Mt. Gox\n\nIt was also rumored that the release of 150,000 BTC could create a \u201cblack swan\u201d event for the Bitcoin ecosystem. The Mt. Gox creditors were given until January 2023 to register and select a repayment method as part of the plan by which they will be compensated for their losses.\n\nRelated: Mt. Gox repayment date looming: Is Bitcoin in trouble?\n\nMt. Gox 2023: The day that never comes (Avg. BTC price $27,000)\n\nThe deadlines for reimbursement registrations got pushed into the future twice in 2023. However, on April 7, Mt. Gox trustee Kobayashi stated that the deadline for creditors to provide their repayment information \u2014 clarification of payee and payment type \u2014 had passed.\n\nTo the creditor\u2019s disappointment, Mt. Gox changed the repayment deadline to October 2024.\n\nMt. Gox has not yet responded to Cointelegraph\u2019s request for comment about its commitment to reimburse users\u2019 funds. In a Sept. 21 letter, Kobayashi wrote that, with the permission of the Tokyo District Court, he had extended the deadline for the base repayment, the early lump-sum repayment and the intermediate repayment.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: \u2018AI has killed the industry\u2019: EasyTranslate boss on adapting to change"

The low volatility will likely continue after Wednesday's Federal Reserve rate decision, according to some crypto traders.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell will follow with a press conference 30 minutes later.

        "content": "The ongoing legal battle between the Binance cryptocurrency exchange and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took a surprising turn on Sept. 18.\n\nMagistrate Judge Zia Faruqui rejected the SEC\u2019s request for access to Binance.US\u2019s systems. Instead, the judge suggested that the SEC should formulate specific discovery requests.\n\nWhile this decision only temporarily postponed the need for Binance to demonstrate the separation between Binance.US\u2019s custody solution and Binance International, the market responded positively.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) surged to its highest level in three weeks, breaking above the $27,000 resistance. Traders are now wondering whether the rally has been supported by leverage or genuine spot buying demand.\n\nThis is where metrics related to Bitcoin derivatives could potentially provide the solution.\n\nInvestors must wait three weeks for further rulings\n\nJudge Faruqui scheduled a follow-up hearing for Oct. 12 and called upon the involved parties to submit a status report before the event, as reported by Yahoo Finance. What might have seemed like a setback for the SEC, at least for the time being, could potentially increase the risks for Binance.\n\nBinance founder and CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao remains steadfast in asserting that Binance.US has never utilized Binance\u2019s global custody solutions, despite a document from Binance.US on Sep. 15 suggesting otherwise. Nevertheless, the SEC has yet to produce clear evidence of Binance attempting to mislead the court.\n\nRegardless of the current evidence, or more accurately, the absence of reliable information provided by Binance, the outlook for Bitcoin bulls has significantly improved for the next three weeks, with no anticipated changes until the upcoming court hearing.\n\nTo gauge the increasing optimism among professional traders, let\u2019s examine Bitcoin\u2019s margin and derivatives metrics.\n\nBitcoin margin, options show clear path toward $28,000\n\nMargin markets offer valuable insights into the positioning of professional traders as they enable investors to increase their exposure through stablecoin borrowing.\n\nConversely, Bitcoin borrowers can speculate on a cryptocurrency\u2019s price decline. A declining indicator suggests that traders are becoming less bullish, while a ratio exceeding 30 typically indicates excessive confidence.\n\nOKX stablecoin/BTC margin-lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nRecent data reveals that the margin-lending ratio for OKX traders has dropped to its lowest point in three months, standing at 19x, down from 27x just a week ago. These findings suggest that the overwhelming dominance of leverage long positions has diminished, although the current ratio still favors the bulls.\n\nMarket sentiment can also be assessed by analyzing whether more activity is occurring through call (buy) options or put (sell) options.\n\nA put-to-call ratio of 0.70 indicates that put option open interest lags behind the more bullish calls, implying a bullish momentum. Conversely, a 1.40 indicator favors put options, signifying bearish sentiment.\n\nBTC options volume put-to-call ratio. Source: Laevitas.ch\n\nThe put-to-call ratio for Bitcoin options volume has recently shifted from favoring put options at 1.50 to a balanced 1.04 level on Sept. 20, indicating a reduced interest in protective puts.\n\nNotably, since Sept. 18, BTC options volume has either been neutral or slightly favored put options, suggesting that professional traders were caught off-guard by the price rally above $27,000.\n\nRelated: Binance CEO refutes report on $250M loan to BAM Management\n\nBoth Bitcoin margin and options markets indicate a balanced demand between long and short positions. From a bullish perspective, this suggests that excessive leverage hasn\u2019t been utilized as Bitcoin\u2019s price climbed from $26,500 to $27,500 on Sept. 19.\n\nHowever, bears may find solace in the fact that even as Bitcoin\u2019s price reached its highest level in three weeks, there was limited enthusiasm from buyers in the margin and options markets.\n\nNonetheless, the data does hint at buying support from spot orders, possibly indicating that big entities, or so-called whales, are accumulating regardless of price.\n\nNow, BTC and other crypto bulls have a window of three more weeks until Oct. 12, when the Federal Judge will convene another hearing and potentially issue orders that could pose challenges for Binance.US. In the meantime, a Bitcoin price rally above $28,000 is certainly on the table.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

At the time of Finney\u2019s talk, zero-knowledge proofs were known to be theoretically possible, but were generally viewed as inefficient or unfeasible.\n\n\u201cI wanted to find out just how inefficient or impractical they really are,\u201d Finney says in the video before proposing a zero-knowledge proof system.\n\nMuch of Finney\u2019s life was marked by challenging the boundaries of what was deemed possible. In 2009, the cypherpunk was the first bitcoin recipient, receiving ten bitcoin from the cryptocurrency\u2019s pseudonymous founder Satoshi Nakamoto. The same year, Finney was diagnosed with ALS. Just shortly after, he wrote in a blog post: \u201c[M]y dream is to contribute to open source software projects even from within an immobile body. That will be a life very much worth living.\u201d Finney died in 2014 and is cryopreserved in Arizona.\n\nThe subject of Finney\u2019s 25-year old talk remains vexing today. Ethereum layer-2s are locked in an arms race building zero-knowledge proofs to scale the ecosystem. However, the efficacy of this technology is yet to be established. Implementing zero-knowledge proofs can be prohibitively costly or compromise security, rendering them inefficient and impractical.\n\nIn Finney-ian fashion, though, crypto developers are still chipping away at a solution.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Buy GSBC\u2026 \u2014 Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) September 19, 2023\n\nFor months, the best-selling author, who lent his voice to Bitcoin advocacy since 2020, has severally insisted that America is broke. He reiterated his opinion in July, explaining that the country\u2019s debt was on the rise and countering claims that the economy was strong. At the time, he stated that the stock market was rising because of the U.S. debt ceiling removal.\n\nKiyosaki frequently refers to bitcoin, gold, and silver as real assets and real money due to his belief that the U.S. dollar will die while they will act as protection measures.\n\nCrypto: The Future of Money\n\nEarlier this year, Kiyosaki disclosed that he is bent on buying more BTC, gold, and silver because the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and President Joe Biden are liars. He has always considered fiat fake money and reiterated his stance on Sunday when he revealed that he was at a \u201cmassive crypto conference\u201d in Singapore.\n\nThe renowned investor stated that crypto is the future of money while fiat is toast.\n\nMeanwhile, Kiyosaki recently predicted that BTC will soar to $120,000 in 2024 as Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa will soon launch a new cryptocurrency backed by gold, which would harm the U.S. dollar."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nAn ex-Alameda employee said the trading firm was responsible for a 87% plunge in Bitcoin\u2019s value in 2021.\n\nOn October 21, 2021, Bitcoin\u2019s price on Binance.US plummeted from around $65,760 to $8,200.\n\nBaradway stated that manual trading actions, not just algorithmic trading, played a role in the sharp price drop.\n\nAn ex-employee who has begun to disclose the inner workings of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s companies claims that disgraced trading firm Alameda Research was responsible for the blip that caused Bitcoin (BTC) 87% collapse in 2021.\n\nAs an engineer at Alameda Research, I had my entire life savings stolen from me by my former boss: Sam Bankman-Fried. Now, after months of recuperation from the craziness of the FTX collapse, I\u2019m ready to tell my story. Let\u2019s start at the beginning: (1/25) \ud83e\uddf5#SBF #FTX pic.twitter.com/x5wKvT0Dy2 \u2014 Adi (e/acc) (@aditya_baradwaj) August 23, 2023\n\nBaradway and Binance.US did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBitcoin traders on Binance.US panicked on October 21, 2021, when the cryptocurrency\u2019s price suddenly plummeted from around $65,760 to as low as $8,200 at 11:34 UTC (7:34 a.m. ET), before quickly rebounding. This abrupt drop had no apparent cause, while other bitcoin exchanges continued to operate as usual.\n\nRecent tweets from a former Alameda Research employee suggest that the trading company may be responsible for the turmoil, though the investor\u2019s true identity remains a mystery.\n\n\u201cI had my entire life savings stolen from me by my former boss: Sam Bankman-Fried,\u201d said the ex-employee, Aditya Baradway.\n\nAlthough algorithms conducted the majority of trades at Alameda, Baradwaj noted that traders could occasionally manually place orders during volatile market conditions or to capitalize on opportunities. This manual intervention led to the incident in question.\n\nThe main one was our semi-systematic strategies, where traders set model parameters that control a complex automated trading system. This way, traders aren't placing actual trades, but rather fine-tuning an algorithm that decides how to execute the trades at high frequency. 3/n \u2014 Adi (e/acc) (@aditya_baradwaj) September 20, 2023\n\nAccording to Baradwaj\u2019s tweet, the trader tried to sell a block of BTC in response to the news and sent out the order via our manual trading system. They failed to notice that the decimal point was wrong by a couple of spaces. They sold BTC for pennies as opposed to the going rate on the market.\n\nArbitrage traders promptly noted the mispricing, then returning Bitcoin to its previous values. But Alameda suffered a significant financial loss.\n\nThe result was immediate. The price of BTC shot from a high of $65k to as low as $8k on some venues, only to be quickly restored by arbitrageurs. The sudden price movement lit crypto Twitter on fire as traders scrambled to figure out what was going on: 8/n pic.twitter.com/50YP6PO84J \u2014 Adi (e/acc) (@aditya_baradwaj) September 20, 2023\n\nAlameda incurred massive losses, in the tens of millions, due to the sincere fat-finger error. Baradwaj explained that, given its genuine nature, there were limited options other than implementing additional sanity checks for manual transactions.\n\n\u201cBinance US \u2013 which was the epicenter of the flash crash \u2013 released a statement claiming that it had been caused by one of their \u201cinstitutional traders\u201d who had a \u201cbug in their trading algorithm\u201d I guess Caroline had made some phone calls,\u201d admitted Baradway mentioning Bakman-Fried\u2019s girlfriend at the time.\n\nUnlikely Market Crash from FTX Crypto Asset Sales\n\nA prospective liquidation of FTX\u2019s crypto holdings, according to digital asset exchange Coinbase, won\u2019t have a detrimental impact on the market.\n\nThis analysis was conducted in response to widespread concerns that the sale of FTX digital assets to investors for more than $3.4 billion will result in a significant price decline based on the asset\u2019s weekly transaction volumes.\n\nBecause of volume restrictions imposed at each stage of the liquidation, the company asserts that the sale won\u2019t cause a significant market impact.\n\nContrary to the initial rumors of a $1.3 billion overnight sale, the liquidations will start with a weekly cap of $50 million and gradually increase to $100 million in the coming weeks.\n\nStill, FTX debtors and their committees will need to approve a permanent $200 million per week.\n\n\u201cStrict controls in place for selling certain \u2018insider-affiliated\u2019 tokens that require 10 days advance notice to these same committees,\u201d said David Duong, the head of institutional research.\n\nHowever, the business can sign contracts for hedging digital assets with a certified advisor under the provisions. This hedging agreement exclusively applies to Bitcoin and Ethereum, with the possibility of adding other coins subject to creditor approval.\n\nThe company is also required to provide periodic updates (weekly and monthly) on balances, transactions, sales, yields, market insights, and other revenue-generating sources.\n\nAccording to a recent court judgement, the defunct exchange can now sell its cryptocurrency holdings to reimburse investors either directly or through investments.\n\nMarket Anxiety Sparked by Bankruptcy Proceedings\n\nThe collapse of FTX in November 2022 hit the market in a number of ways, from the immediate market decline that destroyed billions of dollars to the more current worries over the sale of its crypto holdings.\n\nThe exchange reportedly has $7 billion in assets, including Bahamian real estate, stocks, and cryptocurrency, according to a recent court filing.\n\nThe firm holds $560 million in BTC and $1.16 billion in Solana (SOL). The exchanges also own real estate valued at over $200 million and venture capital assets totaling over $4.5 billion in many businesses.\n\nExperts\u2019 predictions that the sale would have a large effect on the market last week prompted Tron\u2019s Justin Sun to call for greater community support and to suggest that he would make a bid for some of the assets in order to lessen the effects on the market."

        "title": "Top 4 US states that are more interested in Ethereum over Bitcoin in 2023 - Blockgeeks",
        "content": "In the dynamic landscape of cryptocurrency, while Bitcoin maintains a stronghold in terms of market share across most US states, certain regions have shown an increased inclination towards Ethereum. According to recent findings, four states \u2014 New Jersey, Colorado, Florida, and Wisconsin \u2014 stand out with a higher Ethereum preference.\n\nLet\u2019s delve deeper into the reasons behind this shift.\n\nTop 4 US states that prefer Ethereum over Bitcoin in 2023\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s interest in Ethereum and crypto\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s recent legislative moves clearly signal its intent to become a pivotal crypto hub. The state\u2019s General Assembly has passed the \u201cDigital Assets and Blockchain Regulation\u201d Act, which introduces a range of provisions favorable for the cryptocurrency sector. It lays down regulations for digital assets, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain technologies and paves the way for decentralized autonomous organizations to establish themselves within the state.\n\nSen. Robert Singer\u2019s comments reflect the state\u2019s approach: \u201cWe want to be more industry-friendly.\u201d This, combined with incentives for virtual currency businesses and the focus on blockchain integration, positions New Jersey at the forefront of Ethereum adoption.\n\nColorado: The home of ETHDenver\n\nGovernor Jared Polis\u2019s 2022 announcement to establish Colorado as a center for crypto innovation has borne fruit. The state has introduced a program allowing tax payments through cryptocurrency and embraced Ethereum-centric events like ETHDenver.\n\nETHDenver, one of the largest web3 conferences in the world, has seen enormous support from the blockchain community. Its mission to build Colorado as the ultimate destination for a decentralized future is making significant strides. The event\u2019s community-funded approach and the proposed $10 million fund for decentralized projects further amplify Colorado\u2019s commitment to Ethereum and the broader blockchain ecosystem.\n\nFlorida: Crypto Adoption led by a passionate Mayor and Governor\n\nFlorida is emerging as an attractive destination for crypto investment, thanks to the efforts of Governor Ron DeSantis and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez. The state\u2019s endeavors to integrate blockchain technology into various sectors and Mayor Suarez\u2019s aggressive campaign to lure crypto businesses to the region have significantly fueled Ethereum\u2018s popularity. The renaming of the Miami Heat\u2019s stadium to FTX Arena (before FTX went down in flames and the stadium quickly ditched the moniker) and the symbolic gesture of leaders receiving pay in Bitcoin testify to the state\u2019s growing enthusiasm for digital currencies. With the state attracting several businesses and developers, there is hardly any surprise why they lean more heavily towards the sophisticated use cases of the Ethereum ecosystem over Bitcoin.\n\nWisconsin: The Silent Ethereum Advocate\n\nThere is not much information out there about Wisconsin\u2019s interest in crypto. However, the survey suggests otherwise. The state, known for its progressive approach towards technology and innovation, is likely recognizing Ethereum\u2018s potential beyond just a digital currency. As Ethereum establishes itself as a robust platform for decentralized applications, states like Wisconsin, which value technological progress, would naturally gravitate towards it.\n\nWhy should you buy Ethereum instead of Bitcoin?\n\nCertainly, Bitcoin holds the mantle as the premier cryptocurrency, its pioneering presence and vast adoption making it a household name. However, when diving into the intricate tapestry of blockchain technology, Ethereum emerges as a potent contender, not just as a cryptocurrency but as a comprehensive platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nEthereum\u2018s programmability is its trump card. This isn\u2019t just about trading or holding a currency; it\u2019s about harnessing a versatile framework upon which a myriad of applications can be built. In essence, Ethereum offers an entire ecosystem, opening doors to decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, art, and much more.\n\nThis functionality has a magnetic pull on states with a burgeoning crypto presence and developer community. Consider Colorado and Florida; their robust crypto-awareness has led them to prefer the multifunctional Ethereum over the monolithic Bitcoin. As these states champion technological innovation, it\u2019s only logical for them to gravitate toward a platform that offers more than just a digital currency.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nWhile Bitcoin remains a significant player in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum\u2019s multifaceted capabilities, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to smart contracts, are drawing the attention of progressive states. The proactive measures by the states of New Jersey, Colorado, Florida, and Wisconsin clearly indicate Ethereum\u2018s growing significance in the US\u2019s crypto narrative. As 2023 unfolds, observing how other states respond to this trend and the innovations that Ethereum will undoubtedly catalyze will be interesting.\n\nFAQ\n\nIs it better to buy Bitcoin or Ethereum?\n\nBuying Bitcoin or Ethereum often boils down to individual investment goals and risk tolerance. Being the first and most well-established cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is often seen as a \u201cstore of value\u201d and likened to \u201cdigital gold.\u201d On the other hand, Ethereum offers a platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts, making it a currency and a comprehensive ecosystem. Those seeking a diverse range of applications lean towards Ethereum, while those looking for a more established and straightforward digital currency might choose Bitcoin.\n\nWhat problem does Ethereum solve?\n\nEthereum was designed to overcome limitations in earlier cryptocurrencies, primarily regarding flexibility. While Bitcoin introduced the concept of blockchain and decentralized money, Ethereum took it a step further by creating a platform where developers can build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications. This means tasks, transactions, and programs can run autonomously without intermediaries, potentially revolutionizing various sectors, from finance and real estate to entertainment and governance.\n\nWill Ethereum overtake Bitcoin?\n\nPredicting the future of the crypto market is challenging due to its volatile nature. While Ethereum brings a lot of functionality to the table with its smart contract capabilities, Bitcoin\u2019s primary value proposition is its status as the original cryptocurrency and its widespread adoption as a store of value. Some experts believe Ethereum\u2018s expansive use cases might give it an edge in the long run, a concept termed the \u201cflippening,\u201d but it remains speculative. Both cryptocurrencies have their strengths and could coexist, catering to different market segments.\n\nWhat will happen to Ethereum in 2030?\n\nIt is impossible to predict Ethereum\u2019s valuation in 2030. With the incorporation of multiple L2s and sharding, Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues should be solved, potentially making Ethereum more efficient and capable of handling more transactions per second. With favorable regulations, Ethereum should have plenty of use cases.\n\nWhat are the disadvantages of Ethereum?\n\nEthereum\u2019s biggest problem is integrating and deploying all the cool scalability innovations that are happening right now. For example, sharding can be complicated, and integrating it with Ethereum\u2019s chain could have unforeseen consequences."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) speculators are in \u201cpanic\u201d mode, as nearly all of them are in the red, research says.\n\nIn the latest edition of its weekly newsletter, \u201cThe Week On-Chain,\u201d analytics firm Glassnode revealed 97.5% unrealized losses among Bitcoin\u2019s short-term holders (STHs).\n\nResearch warns of \u201cnon-trivial\u201d Bitcoin sentiment slide\n\nBTC price action in recent months has tested the resolve of investors, but none more so than those who bought BTC over the past three months.\n\nSTHs, which correspond to entities hodling coins for 155 days or less, have seen their aggregate cost basis fail as market support.\n\nAs Glassnode notes, as of Sept. 17, the cost basis for those not spending BTC is now $28,000 \u2014 around 5% above the current spot price.\n\nAs part of its research, the firm separated the STH cohort into holders and spenders, discovering \u201ca relationship between abrupt changes in implied (unrealized) profitability and the shift in spending by STHs (realized profitability).\u201d\n\nThe result, it says, is what it calls a \u201cnon-trivial change in sentiment.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom this perspective, we can see that the cost basis of STHs who are spending fell below the cost basis of holders as the market sold off from $29k to $26k in mid-August,\u201d The Week On-Chain explained.\n\n\u201cThis suggests a degree of panic and negative sentiment has taken hold in the near term.\u201d\n\nBitcoin STH holder and spender data annotated chart (screenshot).

The finality is anchored on the Bitcoin blockchain, while the Polygon blockchain is used for data storage, with Trustless Computer being the project\u2019s own scaling network for Bitcoin.\n\nOne of the co-founders of the project is a pseudonymous user dubbed Punk3700, who is quoted describing the makeup of Alpha as \u201ca rollup that rolls up to another rollup that rolls up to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nCointelegraph spoke with Punk3700 to better understand the developments behind the launch of the new Bitcoin-based social token network.\n\n\u201cAlpha implies a layered architecture that includes NOS-TC. Trustless Computer (TC) is an optimistic rollup layer that centers directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. NOS is implemented as another optimistic product of layers to provide additional scalability on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHe said the optimistic rollup layers \u201cwork in tandem\u201d to provide security and efficiency for the environment to deploy decentralized applications.\n\n\u201cNOS is configured with a hybrid design that uses Bitcoin for data validity,\u201d he said, \u201cand then uses Polygon for data storage \u2014 in the end, we settle on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u200b\u200bThis will allow for flexibility with data storage for different needs because the fee on Bitcoin is insanely expensive.

        "content": "While the Bitcoin network has continued to expand over the years, the Bitcoin (BTC) mining industry has yet to see a comparable increase in carbon footprint \u2014 an achievement that a Bloomberg analyst argues \u201cfew industries can claim.\u201d\n\nThis, in turn, could drive the next wave of institutional investment.\n\nOn Sept. 20, Bloomberg crypto market analyst Jamie Coutts cited data showing that the sustainable energy mix for Bitcoin has continued to rise since 2021 and is now over 50%. This has led to the growth of emissions slowing relative to the network\u2019s continued expansion.\n\n\u201cBitcoin as a global monetary network is scaling while its carbon impact declines. Few industries can claim this achievement.\u201d\n\nHe said that the evolving relationship between Bitcoin network growth and the global push to transition from fossil fuels could \u201ccatalyze a wave of institutional and even sovereign investment capital.\u201d\n\nThe analyst added that as energy constitutes well over 50% of mining\u2019s operational costs:\n\n\u201cThe incentive to acquire the cheapest energy sources is contributing to the network\u2019s rising hash rate while simultaneously reducing the industry\u2019s emissions or carbon intensity.\u201d\n\nBottom Line: If the network scales to hundreds of millions of users, the impact on global carbon emissions will be minimal, and the technology itself is likely to play a pivotal role in the transition away from fossil fuels \u2014 Jamie Coutts CMT (@Jamie1Coutts) September 20, 2023\n\nEnergy emissions refer to the greenhouse gases and air pollutants emitted as byproducts from different energy sources and activities, whereas carbon intensity measures how clean the electricity is.\n\nOn Sept. 18, Cointelegraph reported that the next generation of Bitcoin miners was focusing on alternative energy sources for efficiency.\n\nHowever, the percentage of sustainable energy used in Bitcoin mining has been a point of debate, as Cambridge University\u2019s model (which hasn\u2019t been updated since January 2022) stated that mining from sustainable energy sources is just 37.6%.\n\nClimate technology venture investor and activist Daniel Batten, however, argues that this is actually above 50%.\n\nGoogle is learning pic.twitter.com/xt8flWKN63 \u2014 Daniel Batten (@DSBatten) September 19, 2023\n\nHe said in anX post that the Cambridge figures were out because off-grid mining and methane mitigation are currently not included in its calculations.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin mining is becoming more environmentally friendly\n\nEarlier this year, Batten reported that the intensity of Bitcoin mining emissions had fallen to its lowest-ever level.\n\nBitcoin Net Zero Emission Tracker. Source: batcoinz.com/Daniel Batten\n\nMoreover, he predicts that the Bitcoin network will become carbon neutral by December 2024.\n\n\u201cBy 2030, the Bitcoin network is projected to mitigate 10x more emissions from the atmosphere than it produces, an astonishing achievement,\u201d claimed Batten.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with \u2018Net Zero\u2019 promises"

        "content": "Early Bitcoin (BTC) pioneer Hal Finney shared his vision for zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs more than 25 years ago, a full decade before the launch of the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.\n\nThe video, purportedly from the Crypto \u201898 conference held on Aug. 26, 1998, in Santa Barbara, shows Finney discussing in detail the concept of zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic technology that gained immense popularity decades later.\n\n\ufe0f NEW: Bitcoin legend Hal Finney discusses Zero-Knowledge Proofs in a newly unearthed presentation, made 25 years ago at Crypto '98 in Santa Barbara.\n\n\n\nHave you ever heard @halfin's voice before? pic.twitter.com/HdddworTsg \u2014 Trust Machines (@trustmachinesco) September 20, 2023\n\nFinney explains how one could hypothetically perform a zero-knowledge proof on a SHA-1 hash, describing the possibility of sending a cryptographically encrypted claim without revealing any of the details contained within the same claim.\n\n\u201cI want to prove to you that I know a message that hashes to a given hash value using the SHA-1 hash. I don\u2019t want to reveal anything about the message to you. It\u2019s a zero-knowledge proof, and I\u2019ve written a program to do this that I\u2019ll tell you about,\u201d explained Finney.\n\nA ZK-proof is a cryptographic protocol that enables one user (the prover) to convince another (the verifier) that a particular claim is true without disclosing any details about the claim itself. The concept of zero-knowledge proofs was first conceived in 1985.\n\nAt the time of Finney\u2019s speech, zero-knowledge proofs were considered a possibility, but due to hardware limitations at the time, they were widely regarded as, as Finney puts it, \u201cinefficient or impractical.\u201d\n\nRelated: Idealistic Ethereum community-built zkEVM Scroll launching in weeks\n\nDecades later, the crypto industry is now abuzz with discussions and debates on how best to implement zero-knowledge proofs, with the main use of the technology being leveraged to scale the Ethereum network.\n\nFinney is a storied pioneer of the cryptocurrency industry. He was a computer scientist who made some of the earliest contributions to privacy-enhancing technology, including the first fully anonymous remailer, a tool that protected user identity when sending emails. Additionally, Finney created the first reusable proof-of-work system, which preceded Bitcoin by nearly five years.\n\nIn 2009, Finney was the very first recipient of Bitcoin after he was transferred 10 BTC by the cryptocurrency\u2019s pseudonymous founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, and was known to have worked closely alongside Nakamoto in Bitcoin\u2019s earliest days.\n\nSome have speculated that Finney himself could be Satoshi Nakamoto, though he has denied the theory.\n\nFinney was diagnosed with a rare neurological disease known as ALS, or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, the complications of which would later claim his life in 2014. Finney was cryopreserved by the Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Arizona.\n\nThe video could be one of the first times that some people have been able to hear Finney\u2019s voice, suggested TrustMachines on X.\n\nBig Questions: What\u2019s with all the crypto deaths?"

        "title": "Ethereum price sees new low vs Bitcoin since switching to proof-of-stake - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether (ETH) has seen a 36% year-to-date increase in its price in 2023 in U.S. dollar terms. This recovery, however, is modest given that ETH is currently trading 66% below its November 2021 peak of $4,870.\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin: 14-month downtrend and counting\n\nMoreover, on Sept. 20, Ether reached its lowest levels against Bitcoin (BTC) in 14 months, breaching the critical 0.06 BTC support. This has raised questions among Ether investors about the factors behind this price decline and what it will take to reverse the trend.\n\nETH/BTC price on Coinbase. Source: TradingView\n\nETH buyers placed their biggest hopes on protocol upgrades that significantly reduced the need for new coin issuance when the network transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nThese hopes were realized in mid-September 2022, resulting in an annualized issuance rate of just 0.25% of the supply. This transformation aligned with the Ethereum community\u2019s vision of \u201cultrasound money.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the subsequent Shapella upgrade on April 12 allowed for withdrawals from the native staking protocol, addressing a major concern for investors. Previously, both the 32 ETH deposits and the yield from participating in the network consensus were locked up indefinitely.\n\nConfidence among Ethereum enthusiasts grew as these significant hurdles were crossed with minimal issues. They anticipated that the price of Ether would surpass $2,000, a prediction that came true on April 14.\n\nHowever, this optimism was short-lived, as ETH\u2019s price promptly fell back to the same $1,850 level just a week later.\n\nNotably, instead of witnessing a net withdrawal, Ethereum staking experienced a net inflow of 3.1 million ETH in the 30 days following the Shappela upgrade, surpassing even the most optimistic expectations.\n\nGiven that the Ethereum network\u2019s planned developments have generally been on track, albeit with the customary delays, investors now need to explore other potential catalysts for reversing the current downtrend in Ether\u2019s price relative to BTC.\n\nExternal factors present important triggers for ETH price\n\nOne of these potential catalysts lies in the ongoing legal battle between Ripple (formerly Ripple Labs) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which could significantly impact Ether\u2019s price momentum.\n\nThe SEC contends that XRP (XRP) sales to retail investors constitute a securities offering. However, in July, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP generally does not qualify as a security under SEC guidelines, especially when distributed through exchanges.\n\nAs noted by the \u201cAmerican lawyer and Bitcoiner\u201d Bryan Jacoutot on X (formerly Twitter), the Ethereum Foundation remains exposed due to the presale of ETH directed toward institutional investors and subject to a lock-up period.\n\n(1/12) ANALYSIS: I've reviewed the district court ruling on XRP and it rests on very shaky ground. Expect an appeal.\n\n\n\nAND Ethereum Foundation remains at risk even if its upheld because of important distinctions in the methods used by Ripple to sell the \"pre-mine\"\n\n\n\n\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f \u2014 Bryan Jacoutot (@BryanJacoutot) July 13, 2023\n\nAccording to Jacoutot, even if Ripple were to secure a favorable outcome, it wouldn\u2019t immediately mitigate the risks for Ethereum. Nevertheless, it\u2019s undeniable that the regulatory uncertainty surrounding the Ether initial coin offering (ICO) remains a source of concern for investors.\n\nOn Sept. 20, an Ethereum address associated with the ICO era showed its first activity, transferring 32.1 ETH (valued at $52,000 at the time) directly to Coinbase. This additional movement only amplified regulatory concerns since there are no apparent incentives for addresses that have remained dormant for four to eight years to divest at this particular point in the market cycle.\n\nAn Ethereum ICO participant who has been dormant for 8 years transferred 32.1 $ETH to #Coinbase just now.\n\n\n\nThe address received 200 $ETH at Ethereum Genesis.\n\n\n\nAnd the address appears to be related to shemnon.eth (@shemnon).https://t.co/nj5eF8iRT0 pic.twitter.com/6Viytn4dU5 \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 20, 2023\n\nA similar occurrence unfolded with an address linked to Vitalik Buterin, which sent 300 ETH (worth $490,000 at the time) to the Kraken exchange on Sept. 19.\n\nMore positive news gives hope to Ethereum investors\n\nOn the news side, Ethereum has seen some positive surprises, such as the unexpected request for a spot Ether exchange-traded fund by ARK Invest and 21Shares on Sept. 6. This development reduced the risks associated with excessive institutional concentration in Bitcoin, particularly if the ETF is approved.\n\nAdditionally, Canto, a layer-1 Cosmos-native blockchain, announced its expansion to Ethereum\u2019s layer 2 on Sept. 18. This zero-knowledge, permissionless rollup, compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, is primarily focused on bringing traditional finance into the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nShould Bitcoin\u2019s price surge be driven solely by the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF or inflation concerns in the United States, Ether is well-positioned to follow suit, benefiting from the same catalysts.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s primary competitors in the decentralized applications sector, namely Solana and BNB Chain, face similar risks pertaining to ICO and securities regulations, making it unlikely for them to challenge Ethereum\u2019s dominance in terms of total value locked and trading volumes.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "The 60/40 Portfolio Isn't Dead, and Neither Is Bitcoin. But Mixing Them Can Be Lethal. - Morningstar Asia",
        "content": "Bitcoin has performed surprisingly well for the year to date. The CMBI Bitcoin Index posted a 76.4% return through July 2023 in defiance of the gloomy narratives that haunt the rest of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nThe trusty balanced portfolio has also beaten expectations as of late. Vanguard Balanced Index VBAIX has turned in a respectable 12.8% for the year to date after a lousy 2022 that augured the age-old question of whether the 60/40 fund (referring to its split between stocks and bonds) might be dead. Balanced funds\u2019 performance owes a great deal to the excellent performance of U.S. stocks, which have returned a hearty 20.6%, as measured by the Morningstar US Market Index.\n\nSo far in 2023, risk has paid handsomely. That fact may leave many investors wondering whether to add some extra firepower to their portfolio in the form of an allocation to bitcoin.\n\nCompared with other assets, though, bitcoin\u2019s volatility is more kerosene than kindling. Over the 10-year period ended July 2023, bitcoin was 16.8 times as volatile as Vanguard Balanced Index. (The only asset that comes anywhere close is oil, although the price history of the Dow Jones Crude Oil Index only goes back to 2015.)\n\nRolling One-Year Volatility of Bitcoin Exceeds Other Assets\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023.\n\nEven though bitcoin has performed favorably since the last time we examined bitcoin\u2019s impact on the 60/40 in 2021, its returns are still nearly 4 times as volatile as those of a balanced fund. That means that even a smidge of bitcoin changes the behavior of an investor\u2019s portfolio a whole lot.\n\nHow Much Is a Lot?\n\nLet\u2019s say that in August 2013 a hypothetical investor added a 2% allocation to bitcoin to a costless 60/40 portfolio\u2014that\u2019s $20 in bitcoin for every $1,000 invested. (For the purposes of this example, let\u2019s also assume the investor furnished that $20 investment from their bond portfolio, although it doesn\u2019t change the results much whether that money comes from stocks or bonds. We also rebalanced this portfolio on a monthly basis\u2014that will become important in a second.)\n\nOur study found that a 2% sliver of bitcoin reshaped the return profile of their portfolio nearly as much as adding a 10% stake in stocks would have: A 60%/38%/2% split between stocks/bonds/bitcoin yielded a standard deviation of 10.7 over the past 10 years, in line with how a 70%/30% S&P 500/Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond portfolio would have behaved.\n\nBitcoin Alters Standard Deviations Far More Than Additional Stock Exposure\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct.\n\nFurther up the risk spectrum, a portfolio with a 5% stake in bitcoin had a risk profile closer to a 90/10 portfolio than a 60/40. In fact, if that hypothetical portfolio was a fund, adding bitcoin would have easily pushed it out of the moderate allocation Morningstar Category to which most balanced funds belong. The closest match among allocation categories is the aggressive allocation category, meaning that the portfolio leapfrogged the moderately aggressive allocation category altogether. (Meanwhile, any portfolio with a 10% allocation or more to bitcoin courted more risk than the S&P 500 on its own!)\n\nDecomposing that risk reveals even more. Effectively, a 1% allocation to bitcoin has a negligible effect on risk, either in terms of absolute volatility or relative contribution. But a 2% allocation to bitcoin explains close to 15% of a portfolio\u2019s overall volatility, a much heftier contribution. Meanwhile, a 5% allocation accounts for nearly 45% of the return volatility the portfolio experienced, and overall volatility was meaningfully higher.\n\nBitcoin's Relative Contribution to Risk Increases With Additional Exposure\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct.\n\nAlthough adding bitcoin does open up the risk throttle on these hypothetical portfolios, it\u2019s worth pointing out that investors would have been fairly compensated for doing so. A costless 60/40 portfolio would have turned in a Sharpe ratio (a return metric that accounts for risk) of roughly 0.77 over the past decade. Each portfolio that contains bitcoin improves upon that result, although incremental improvements peak at a 5% slice.\n\nBitcoin Has Compensated Investors for Additional Risk\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct.\n\nWith that being said, our portfolios were crafted using a fairly narrow set of assumptions that aren\u2019t likely to hold in practice. That\u2019s because regulators in the United States have barred most brokerages from offering bitcoin alongside traditional stock and bond investments. Most digital assets are quarantined in a separate wallet or exchange account, which makes it tedious for investors to rebalance on a monthly cadence like we did in our study. Whether because of inertia or mental accounting or both, many investors opt not to rebalance at all.\n\nWhen it comes to security selection\u2014picking individual stocks, for example\u2014the \u201cDo Nothing\u201d approach may have some merit. But when it comes to asset allocation, there are consequences to portfolio neglect. For example, a 1% allocation to bitcoin (funded proportionally from stocks and bonds this time, to replicate the experience of segregating assets) can quickly spiral into a 60% allocation if investors fail to reap what they\u2019ve sown.\n\nFailing to Rebalance Has Significant Consequences for an Investor's Asset Allocation\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct.\n\nEven one annual rebalance makes a world of difference. There are some edge cases, like 2013 and 2017, where the allocation to bitcoin would have climbed above 5%. But mostly it plods along somewhere between 1% and 2%. For only 15 months out of the entire 10-year holding period does the portfolio overtake that 2% threshold where the portfolio experiences volatility that\u2019s out of spec with the risk profile of a 60/40 portfolio.\n\nAnnual Rebalances Partially Succeed in Keeping Allocation to Bitcoin in Check\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct.\n\nWhile the SEC weighs proposals that might broaden investor access to bitcoin by way of an exchange-traded fund, we see a marginal benefit to existing owners of digital assets who would have an easier time trying to rebalance this high-octane holding if it\u2019s permitted to live alongside their traditional investments. But without the investor protections that other asset classes provide, we continue to advise that investors treat purchases of digital assets (including bitcoin) as a sunk cost rather than an investable asset.\n\nEven so, there are investors who fall somewhere in between these two extremes and treat bitcoin as something more than a sunk cost but less than a full-blown portfolio holding. I would advise those investors to tread cautiously. Like caviar or dynamite, a little bit of bitcoin goes a long way.\n\nA note on the disclaimer below: Most digital assets, including the cryptocurrencies mentioned in this article, are not currently classified as shares of registered securities by the SEC and therefore do not fall under Morningstar\u2019s editorial policies.

        "content": "CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Lumerin Hashpower Marketplace will officially launch on September 26th, unlocking global access to Bitcoin mining hashpower for Web3 users.\n\nLaunching on September 26th on the Arbitrum One network, the Lumerin Hashpower Marketplace represents the next step towards the greater decentralization of Bitcoin mining. Bitcoin miners will have a frictionless path toward buying and selling mining capacity, and non-miners will be able to participate in the same marketplace.\n\nSmoothing the \u201cPeaks-and-Valleys\u201d for Bitcoin Miners\u2019 Operations\n\nThrough the Lumerin Hashpower Marketplace, miners can sell their hashrate through smart contracts, specifying hashrate amount, duration, and price. This contributes to business predictability and de-risking, enabling them to set fixed prices that provide regular earnings.\n\nConversely, miners can use the Lumerin Hashpower Marketplace to purchase hashpower from other miners. This allows miners to increase their chances for earning bitcoin rewards without purchasing rapidly depreciating equipment. These buyers can easily browse and select contracts that suit their needs, secure in the knowledge that they are engaging in direct, trustless transactions and paying in real-time as the contract is completed.\n\nIn either scenario, the Lumerin Hashpower Marketplace helps provide additional predictability to their revenue streams. Further, miners in low-electricity-cost areas could arbitrage those below-average prices through selling hashrate contracts at market prices, keeping the difference.\n\nMining: Anyone, Anytime, Anywhere\n\nThrough the Lumerin Hashpower Marketplace, users can mine bitcoin without the need for highly specialized knowledge, costly hardware outlays, or long-term commitments. With the Lumerin Wallet and detailed documentation, users can buy hashpower contracts, route that hashpower to their pool, and earn mining revenue directly.\n\nUnlocking Access to Mining for a More Decentralized Bitcoin\n\nFounder Ryan Condron explained the potential impact of the Lumerin Hashpower Marketplace\u2019s launch: \"Today marks a milestone in our journey to re-democratize mining,\" says Condron. \"With the Lumerin Hashpower Marketplace now live, we are starting to restore the decentralization of the Bitcoin mining landscape by providing a direct, accessible path for everyone to be part of the mining ecosystem.\"\n\nThe choice of launching on the Arbitrum One network underscores Lumerin\u2019s commitment to user experience, offering users faster transactions, reduced gas fees, and a seamless experience overall.\n\n\"Bitcoin hashpower remains the basis for supporting the most secure distributed network yet devised, creating opportunities for new financial systems and so much more,\" said Jeff Garzik, CEO and co-founder of Lumerin partner Bloq, Inc. \"Through Lumerin, professional miners and crypto enthusiasts alike will be able to participate in Bitcoin mining in ways that make the distribution of hashpower more fluid and democratized, thus bringing our ecosystem closer to its goals.\u201d\n\nThe platform's unique approach has the potential to reshape the dynamics of crypto mining, making it more accessible and appealing to a wider audience.\n\nAbout Lumerin\n\nThe Lumerin Protocol is an open-source project working on decentralized data stream routing. Its first development, the Lumerin Hashpower Marketplace, is a peer-to-peer platform that makes Bitcoin hashrate tradable and liquid, unlocking mining profitability and providing greater access to capital and hashrate on a global scale.\n\nWebsite: https://lumerin.io/\n\nX (formerly Twitter): https://x.com/hellolumerin\n\nMedium: https://medium.com/lumerin-blog\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/LumerinOfficial\n\nIntroductory Video: \u201cMine Bitcoin Everywhere\u201d\n\nDocumentation: https://lumerin.gitbook.io/lumerin-hashpower-marketplace/"

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe crypto tokens were trading mixed in Wednesday's trade ahead of the US Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. Bitcoin, XRP, Toncoin, Solana and Polygon were trading with gains, while BNB Dogecoin , and Litecoin were trading with cuts.Bitcoin (BTC) rose 0.92% to $27,044, whereas Ethereum (ETH) was above the 1,600 level. Meanwhile, the global cryptocurrency market cap was trading higher, around $1.07 trillion, rising 0.62% in the last 24 hours.\"Bitcoin's price has surged beyond the $27,000 threshold, and this upward trajectory could likely be attributed to Nomura, one of Japan's leading investment banks, unveiling a Bitcoin-based fund designed for institutional investors,\" said Edul Patel, CEO & Co-founder of Mudrex.Market sentiment currently varies from neutral to bullish as market participants await the Federal Reserve's FOMC decision regarding interest rates, set to be announced later today, Edul said.The total volume in DeFi is currently $2.23 billion, 7.94% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stablecoins is now $25.78 billion, which is 91.89% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.The market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, was around $527 billion. Bitcoin's dominance is currently 49.16%, according to CoinMarketCap.Meanwhile, BTC volume stood at approximately $14.5 billion, falling 3.86% in the last 24 hours.Bitcoin recently broke the long-term resistance at $26,800, attributed to the \u201cdouble top\u201d pattern seen in the 4-hour period. This breach also marked a successful breakout of the previous downtrend line, signaling the potential for a continued bullish trend.A dominant bullish candle on the 4-hour chart suggests strong bullish momentum with an immediate resistance or target around $27,500 and the possibility of testing $27,900 if the momentum holds. A sustained upside run could push Bitcoin to the $28,800 level and beyond.Critical support now lies at $26,800, once a resistance level, with potential secondary support at $26,300. Vigilance at $26,800 is essential; staying above is bullish, while falling below may require caution and consideration of short positions.: Quick Glance (Source: coinmarketcap.com, data as of 11.50 hours, IST on September 20, 2023)Bitcoin $27,044 0.94%Ethereum $1,634 -0.02%Tether $1 0.01%BNB $216 -0.08%XRP $0.5188 2.05%Cardano $0.2536 -0.02%Dogecoin $0.06233 0.13%Toncoin $2.52 3.68%Solana $19.92 0.56%Polygon $0.5399 2.22%Litecoin $66.53 -0.82%Polkadot $4.12 0.21%Tron $0.08438 0.10%Shiba Inu $0.00000738 1.40%(Note: Price change in last 24 hours)(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "title": "These Cryptocurrencies May Surge After Bitcoin ETF Approval, Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ethereum (ETH), Kangamoon (KANG) - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The long-awaited approval of a Bitcoin ETF in the United States could have far-reaching implications for the cryptocurrency market. While Bitcoin undoubtedly takes center stage, the ripple effect of such approval could extend to other cryptocurrencies. Ethereum (ETH), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and the promising newcomer, Kangamoon (KANG) \u2013 may also experience significant surges.\n\nSummary\n\nShiba Inu positions itself for strong growth\n\nEthereum price prediction\n\nKangamoon projected to dominate the P2E NFT gaming market\n\nDon\u2019t Miss Out On The Kangamoon (KANG) Presale \u2013 Reserve Your Spot!\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB): Strong Growth Potential\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) has made waves with its charismatic branding and an ever-growing community of supporters.\n\nThe approval of a Bitcoin ETF could further legitimize cryptocurrencies in the eyes of institutional investors and the general public. As a result, the broader crypto market, including meme coins like Shiba Inu, might experience increased attention and investment.\n\nThe strong community backing and exciting developments, such as Shibaswap 2.0 and the TREAT reward token, position the Shiba Inu coin for potential growth. Not only that, experts remain bullish for the Shiba Inu coin. In fact, they forecast that the Shiba Inu price will sit between $0.00000946 and $0.00001078 within Q4 of 2023.\n\nEthereum (ETH): A Crypto Giant\n\nEthereum (ETH) has always been pivotal in the crypto ecosystem. If a Bitcoin ETF gains approval, it could set a precedent for further cryptocurrency ETFs, potentially including Ethereum.\n\nEthereum\u2019s significance lies in its smart contract capabilities and vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). An ETF approval could bring fresh investment into the Ethereum network, supporting its ongoing upgrades. Thus driving further Ethereum adoption.\n\nRegarding Ethereum price predictions, market analysts forecast that the value will surge to $2,335.71 by the end of 2023.\n\nKangamoon (KANG): A Meme Coin With a Unique Twist\n\nKangamoon (KANG) will be a newcomer who brings an innovative twist to meme coins. This upcoming project aims to merge gaming and cryptocurrency, offering a unique play-to-earn experience. If a Bitcoin ETF receives the green light, it could surge Kangamoon interest as well.\n\nIt takes its inspiration from the world of memes and infuses it with the adrenaline-pumping world of boxing. At the heart of this crypto sensation is Kangamoon, a spirited kangaroo with an insatiable passion for boxing. Taking on the role of Kangamoon, players embark on an all-immersive journey where they can fight with players from all over the globe.\n\nWhat sets Kangamoon apart is its commitment to the play-to-earn concept. In the Kangamoon gaming universe, players can earn virtual currency and rare in-game items through their skills and dedication. Winning matches and participating in special events are all avenues to accumulating rewards, which can be sold or traded on its marketplace.\n\nIn sum, Kangamoon will be fresh air in the crypto space. Currently, one KANG native token costs only $0.005. Unlike Shiba Inu and Ethereum, KANG taps into the gaming market (seeing $200B in yearly revenue as per Newzoo). Thus, its long-term growth potential is outstanding. As a result, market analysts predict a 22x value growth before its presale finishes.\n\nDiscover the Exciting Opportunities of the Kangamoon (KANG) Presale Today!\n\nWebsite: https://Kangamoon.com/\n\nJoin Our Telegram Community: https://t.me/Kangamoonofficial\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The absence of a specific procedure rule requiring a paying party\u2019s name and address in costs assessment proceedings does not permit the party to conceal their identity from the court, an appeal judge has ruled.\n\nIn Persons Unknown v Wright - the latest in a series of judgments concerning the self-proclaimed inventor of bitcoin - the Honourable Mr Justice Richard Smith dismissed an appeal brought by 'C\u00f8bra', the pseudonymous operator of the bitcoin.org website, over the right to challenge a costs bill of \u00a3569,000. The High Court ruled last year that 'C\u00f8bra' is not entitled to take part in proceedings over a copyright dispute even with legal representation.\n\n'C\u00f8bra' had intended to challenge a default judgment in a claim brought by computer scientist Dr Craig Wright for infringing copyright in the 2008 'Satoshi' white paper which launched the bitcoin peer-to-peer digital cash system.\n\nThe latest appeal, at which C\u00f8bra was represented by Erica Bedford, instructed by Mackenzie Costs Limited, relied partly on the point that no requirement for the paying party's name to be stated appears in Part 47 of the Civil Procedure Rules and the related practice direction. Finding this omission 'unremarkable', Smith observed: 'Although comprehensive, the CPR do not purport to be an exhaustive code as to the conduct of proceedings, nor do they purport to address every specific situation that might arise.'\n\nWright's legal team, Shaman Kapoor, instructed by Travers Smith LLP, commented that the appeal was the first time that the English court has been asked on appeal to determine whether a party has the right to participate in assessment proceedings whilst maintaining their anonymity both to the court and to the opposing party.\n\nWright commented that allowing such anonymity would amount to an attack on the principle of open justice. 'This is a core component of the rule of law and generally requires justice to be administered in public,' he said. 'C\u00f8bra has shown flagrant disregard towards these important principles and now pays the price.\u2019\n\nWright's claim to be 'Satoshi' is expected to be tested in a High Court case scheduled for January and February next year."

        "content": "If someone asked you how many blocks (or minutes) they should wait to make sure their Bitcoin (BTC) transaction is irreversible, would you know what to say? The \u201crule of thumb\u201d would be between three to six blocks (around 30 to 60 minutes), but experts say it should be even more.\n\nDifferent people could give different answers, and a recent post by Luke Dash Jr. (@LukeDashjr) \u2014 a Bitcoin Core developer \u2014 on X suggests that a 12-block waiting (around 120 minutes) is the safer approach, considering Bitcoin mining\u2018s current state.\n\nIndeed, probably should wait a good 12 blocks now \u2014 Luke Dashjr (@LukeDashjr) September 19, 2023\n\nWith that in mind, Finbold went deeper into understanding what is the safer confirmation time for a Bitcoin transaction.\n\nBitcoin transactions have probabilistic finality\n\nDue to Bitcoin having what is called \u2018probabilistic finality\u2019, transactions\u2019 irreversibility increases for each new block added to the blockchain after the block that included the transaction.\n\nWhen someone sends BTC from one address to another \u2014 which could be depositing BTC to a centralized exchange in order to sell \u2014 the Bitcoin transaction sits in a mempool, waiting for the next miner to find a block and include this sending there, before broadcasting this block to the network, that will be added to the blockchain.\n\nHowever, according to the Bitcoin whitepaper, if another miner spends more hashrate and broadcasts a block with the same block height, the first block could be invalidated, as Bitcoin nodes would follow the chain with the highest work (hashrate) put into it.\n\nEach new block broadcasted after the first increases the work put into this given chain, which makes it harder for the block sequence to be invalidated. Probabilistic increasing irreversibility of all the transactions that were validated by this sequence, or chain.\n\nWhy does Bitcoin confirmation time need to increase?\n\nAnother renowned Bitcoin contributor, Jameson Lopp, wrote an article called \u201cHow Many Bitcoin Confirmations is Enough\u201d, addressing all the technical and mathematical aspects that answer this question.\n\nAccording to Lopp, the needed confirmation time for a 99.9% certainty of irreversibility increases according to the percentage of a theoretical attacker would have from the network\u2019s hashrate. Going from 5 blocks (50 minutes) for a 10% hashrate, to 340 blocks (over 56 hours) for a 45% hashrate.\n\n% Attacker Global Hashrate vs # Confs for 99.9% Certainty. Source: Jameson Lopp\n\nNotably, this aligns with the answer Luke Dash Jr. gave about the 12 confirmations needed considering that two Bitcoin mining pools already have over 20% of the global hashrate. These are Foundry USA and Antpool, with 29.67% and 22.75% of the total hashrate in the last month, respectively.\n\nBitcoin mining pools 1-month hashrate ranking. Source: mempool.space\n\nTherefore, the recommended waiting time will vary depending on the state of the network but also on the risk tolerance of the receiving part. Some centralized exchanges have chosen to wait for three blocks depending on the deposit size, while others require four, five, or even six blocks \u2014 each block having an average interval of 10 minutes."

        "content": "News that can be described as historic within the financial industry: Nomura digital asset subsidiary, Laser Digital Asset Management, has unveiled the Bitcoin Adoption Fund, designed exclusively for institutional investors.\n\nThis initiative marks a significant step toward the recognition and mainstream adoption of digital assets, particularly Bitcoin, by one of Japan\u2019s financial giants\n\nJapanese bank Nomura makes itself available for Bitcoin: important news for the crypto world\n\nNomura, a behemoth with assets of more than $500 billion, has an established track record of providing brokerage services to high-level institutional investors.\n\nNow, with the launch of the Bitcoin Adoption Fund, it is taking a decisive step into the cryptocurrency world by offering direct exposure to the leading digital asset, Bitcoin.\n\nThe Laser Digital Bitcoin Adoption Fund is designed to provide long-only exposure to Bitcoin. To ensure maximum security and regulatory compliance, Nomura has chosen Komainu as its trusted custody partner.\n\nThis Bitcoin fund operates under the umbrella of Laser Digital Funds Segregated Portfolio Company, having successfully registered as a mutual fund under the jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands Regulatory Authority.\n\nSebastien Guglietta, head of Laser Digital Asset Management, rightly pointed out the transformative potential of Bitcoin. He noted that Bitcoin stands as a catalyst for a profound and lasting paradigm shift in the financial world.\n\nLong-term exposure to Bitcoin, facilitated by the Bitcoin Adoption Fund, offers institutional investors a means to capitalize on this far-reaching macroeconomic trend.\n\nAlthough this is Nomura\u2019s first foray into a fund dedicated to Bitcoin adoption, the financial giant has long been actively engaged in the digital asset ecosystem.\n\nBack in September 2022, the institution launched its venture capital arm for digital assets, positioning itself at the forefront of digital innovation.\n\nIn addition, in August of the same year, Nomura\u2019s crypto arm, Laser Digital, secured the coveted Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) license to operate in Dubai, further consolidating its global presence.\n\nJapan follows the entire world when it comes to Bitcoin adoption\n\nNomura\u2019s venture into the long-only Bitcoin Adoption Fund aligns with a broader trend of regulated financial giants exploring Bitcoin-based investment products.\n\nIn the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has granted approval for two exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on Bitcoin futures, underscoring the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in traditional financial markets.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that the decision on Bitcoin spot ETFs remains pending. Meanwhile, regions such as Canada and Europe have also given the green light to several Bitcoin-focused investment products in recent years.\n\nNews: a deeper dive into Nomura\u2019s Bitcoin Adoption Fund\n\nThe Bitcoin Adoption Fund, created by Nomura\u2019s digital asset subsidiary, Laser Digital Asset Management, is no ordinary investment vehicle. It was meticulously designed to offer institutional investors a vehicle for long-only exposure to Bitcoin.\n\nThis strategic choice is in line with the idea that Bitcoin, as a store of digital value, is an attractive asset class for long-term investment strategies.\n\nTo safeguard the digital assets held within the fund, Nomura entrusted Komainu with custodial responsibility.\n\nKomainu\u2019s reputation for robust security protocols and regulatory compliance makes it a logical choice for such a critical role.\n\nIn addition, the Bitcoin Adoption Fund operates under the Laser Digital Funds Segregated Portfolio Company, a registered mutual fund supervised by the Cayman Islands Regulatory Authority, which ensures transparency and regulatory compliance.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Nomura\u2019s launch of the Bitcoin Adoption Fund marks a pivotal moment in the integration of cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial landscape.\n\nWith its esteemed reputation and large assets, Nomura\u2019s endorsement of Bitcoin as a long-term investment option speaks volumes about the evolving perception of digital assets within the institutional investment community.\n\nIf this trend continues to gain momentum, it could pave the way for further innovation and adoption within cryptocurrencies, opening new avenues for investors and ushering in a new era of financial diversification."
