        "content": "watch now\n\nCrypto prices fell Thursday after Silvergate, a bank that has been at the center of the industry's growth, made a decision to shut down. Bitcoin slid 7% to $20,474.50, according to Coin Metrics. Ether lost about the same amount and was last trading at $1,440.45. The slight move lower began late Wednesday, a few hours after Silvergate Capital announced it will wind down operations and liquidate its crypto-friendly bank. The relatively small size of the move indicates that cryptocurrency investors priced the news in last week when the company first warned it may not be able to continue operating and it shut down the SEN, or Silvergate Exchange Network, according to Conor Ryder, research analyst at Kaiko. The declines deepened by Thursday afternoon, however, after shares of SVB Financial, whose Silicon Valley Bank, which largely banks tech startups, announced a plan to raise more than $2 billion in capital to help offset losses on bond sales. Although SVB has said it has minimal exposure to crypto, its need to recapitalize on the heels of the Silvergate event has linked the two events in some people's minds.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Bitcoin on Thursday\n\nBitcoin and ether have held up relatively well despite a challenging macroeconomic environment \u2014 still the biggest driver of crypto price action despite a declining correlation between crypto and stocks \u2014 and a series of setbacks for the space, including the recent Silvergate developments and the post-FTX regulatory crackdown on the industry that began in February. Even their single-digit drops on Thursday pale in comparison to the 60% and 41% declines suffered by SVB and Silvergate, respectively. Bitcoin's correlation with stocks is lower than it was for much of 2022 and its volatility has been near historic lows for the past few weeks.\n\nVertigo3d | iStock | Getty Images"

        "title": "What are Bitcoin ordinals? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "What are Bitcoin NFTs? Bitcoin NFTs \u2014 aka Bitcoin ordinals, aka digital artifacts \u2014 are a way to inscribe digital content on the Bitcoin blockchain. The Bitcoin ordinals protocol was launched in January 2023 by Casey Rodarmor. The protocol allows inscribing of digital content like art onto the Bitcoin blockchain. Unlike nonfungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum and other blockchains, Rodarmor wanted to create an immutable on-chain presence of a piece of art, text or video. The genesis ordinal was a pixel art of a skull that Rodarmor inscribed on Dec. 14, 2022. As the NFT space based on Ethereum\u2019s ERC-721 standard skyrocketed in 2021, Rodarmor, who was a programmer and an artist, saw the opportunity to create a similar yet unique experience on the Bitcoin blockchain. His solution was Bitcoin ordinals, based on ordinal theory, which he went on to implement through 2022. Ordinal theory concerns itself with satoshis, giving them individual identities and allowing them to be tracked, transferred and imbued with meaning. The ordinals hype really kicked off in February 2023, six weeks after the genesis ordinal was created. The number of inscriptions doubled every week for a few weeks. However, the number could have been much higher if the infrastructure to inscribe and trade ordinals had been better planned and executed. The rise of Bitcoin ordinals has seen the Bitcoin network explode in terms of usage, fees and storage space as shown in the chart above. This may also be the first big breakthrough for the Bitcoin application tier and can help move the narrative from a pure \u201cstore of value\u201d to something more utilitarian.\n\nHow do Bitcoin ordinals work? Bitcoin ordinals are based on ordinals theory that essentially has brought life to satoshis (sats) and allows them to be treated as atomic units on the Bitcoin blockchain. Ordinals, in their simplest state, are a numbering scheme for sats. Ordinals theory drives the mechanics behind how Bitcoin ordinals work. Ordinals theory defines satoshis (sats) as the atomic unit that can be identified and traded individually on the Bitcoin network. There are 100 million sats that make up 1 Bitcoin (BTC). Sats are numbered based on the order of mining, and this number, which uniquely identifies a sat, is an ordinal number. Related: Bitcoin vs. Satoshi: Key differences explained By being a unit of transaction, sats can also be inscribed with digital content that make up Bitcoin ordinals. They become immutable digital collectibles that can be transacted on the Bitcoin network using Bitcoin wallets. As per ordinal theory, sats can be attached to security tokens, accounts or stablecoins using ordinal numbers as stable identifiers. Due to the broad set of use cases that ordinals can support, Rodarmor prefers not to equate Bitcoin ordinals with NFTs. The use case of ordinals to number a sat that\u2019s been attached to or inscribed with a JPEG can be called a nonfungible token on the Bitcoin blockchain. Although the ordinal\u2019s use that found market fit is that of NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain, ordinals are much more than just nonfungible tokens.\n\nHow to mine Bitcoin ordinals? Mining, minting or inscribing Bitcoin ordinals are the terms that have been used to refer to this process. Unlike minting NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain, which is a relatively matured process, mining Bitcoin ordinals is a technically complex process and lacks intuitive tools. Bitcoin ordinals, in the initial days, could only be mined by those who ran a Bitcoin node. For tech-savvy users, a Bitcoin node with the ord app, a command line wallet, would be the gateway to mining ordinals. Node operators would load their wallets with some sats to pay for the gas fees and perform an inscribing process on their ordinals. However, no-code ordinal mining applications like the Gamma or the Ordinals Bot aim to allow users to upload the content that they want to inscribe to create their Bitcoin ordinal. The user journey takes them through a payment process using a QR code and is intuitive enough for the less technically gifted. The tools around Bitcoin ordinals are still at a very early stage. It has only been a few months since the genesis ordinals were inscribed. As demand from ordinary users and followers increases, the ecosystem and the tooling should start maturing with more user-friendly journeys.\n\nHow to buy, sell and trade ordinals Much like the process of minting Bitcoin ordinals, the trading process hasn\u2019t had the matured tooling. Yet there are a few tools to trade these digital artifacts. As Bitcoin ordinals grow in popularity, most of the trades have been largely over-the-counter. Collections, such as \u201cPlanetary Ordinals\u201d and \u201cBitcoin Punks,\u201d among the first 1,000 inscriptions were transacted mostly without an NFT marketplace such as OpenSea or Blur. However, tools like the Ordinals Wallet, Hiro and Xverse allow users to buy and sell Bitcoin ordinals. Users can buy some sats within the wallet, using on-ramp payment plugins, and perform the transactions to buy and sell ordinals. The typical user journey involved in buying Bitcoin ordinals using Ordinals Wallet is as follows. Go to ordinalswallet.com Click on \u201cCreate Wallet\u201d Take a backup of the recovery phrase for your wallet Set up a password for wallet access Use the address of the Ordinals Wallet to send some sats to the wallet Go to \u201cCollections\u201d at the top of the page Choose the ordinals collection and the inscription that you would like to buy Buy the ordinal (using the sats in your wallet).\n\nHow have ordinals been perceived by the broader Bitcoin ecosystem? Bitcoin ordinals are a great innovation that can highlight various applications unique to the chain, thereby driving developers to participate and create the tools needed by users. Bitcoin ordinals have certainly seen a hype that potentially peaked sometime in February 2023, based on transaction data. However, the hype around the application tier on the Bitcoin blockchain is just getting started. For instance, Stacks (STX) has seen a rise in price since the ordinals episode warmed up. It is clearly the early days for the Bitcoin ecosystem, but if developers are attracted to the chain, then the network effects between developers and users could come in time for the next crypto cycle. Related: Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem explained However, there are downsides to the way ordinals have been designed. As the inscribed content is all on-chain with ordinals unlike with most Ethereum-based NFTs, the size of the blockchain would increase. As new applications emerge and network utilization and transactions increase, so will the cost of transactions. The other potential impact of Bitcoin ordinals is whether it will affect the fungibility of sats. So far, satoshis have been exchanged with one sat being valued the same as another. With various applications of ordinals, this may not be true in the future. A sat with a Bitcoin Punk inscribed in it could be priced differently. Nonetheless, it would be interesting to see how this narrative evolves over the next few months and years."

        "content": "FORT THOMAS, Ky. \u2014 The Fort Thomas Police Department is advising residents of a new scam it has been seeing over the last few weeks. The scam involves Bitcoin, which is a form of digital currency.\n\nWhat You Need To Know Police are seeing more Bitcoin scams\n\n\n\nThe latest has scam artists posing as law enforcement demanding money for dropped charges\n\n\n\nAttorneys say its hard to recover funds from crypto scams\n\n\u201cOnce the money is deposited inside a Bitcoin ATM, the money is gone, almost immediately. It is unlikely that the money will ever be located,\u201d the department said in a public notice. \u201cThe scammers usually stay on the phone with you through the entire process until the money is deposited.\u201d\n\nScammers have been telling people they are local police, U.S. Marshals, Border Patrol, and other law enforcement officers, according to the department. Scammers tell victims they need to pay a certain amount to get charges dropped.\n\nAttorney Brian Levin of Levin Law said his office receives hundreds of inquiries every month from people who\u2019ve been ripped off in cryptocurrency scams.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen people who have invested millions and millions of dollars on this representation. And then when the people go to take their money out, they are told, \u2018well, you have to pay a tax of 20%,\u2019\u201d Levin said.\n\nHowever, he said there is little recourse for the scams happening in Fort Thomas.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency transactions are not reversible, unlike certain cash transactions with banks, so once the money goes out, there\u2019s essentially no getting it back,\u201d Levin said. \u201cBecause even if you can identify where the cryptocurrency is on a blockchain, it\u2019s nearly impossible for them to obtain that cryptocurrency and get it back. And a lot of times it\u2019s in a private wallet, which makes it virtually impossible to get.\u201d\n\nLevin said a lot of his firm\u2019s current work focuses on suing large corporations for data privacy related issues, such as permitting unauthorized parties to get into people\u2019s accounts. A lot of that is in the cryptocurrency space, he said.\n\nFort Thomas police said other scammers have been changing email domain names.\n\n\u201cOnce clicking on those domain names, they are able to take over your computer and then begin their demands,\u201d the department said.\n\nAccording to the department, there are Bitcoin ATMs all over the northern Kentucky and Greater Cincinnati areas. They are typically in small gas stations, convenience stores, and liquor stores.\n\n\u201cIf you find yourself in a situation, in front of or inside one of these places while on the phone with these scammers, hang up the phone and contact your local police department immediately,\u201d the department said. \u201cPlease remember that police departments will not ask you to give money to get out of warrants or trouble over the phone. Do not give any personal identifying information over the phone. If they ask you to deposit money into a Bitcoin ATM, it is a scam!\u201d\n\nLevin said hacking scams happen all across the country, and anyone can be just a click away from falling victim.\n\n\u201cCriminals see that a lot of people are investing in cryptocurrency. And criminals see that people are used to these massive returns,\u201d Levin said. \u201cIt is far easier than people appreciate for criminals to install malware and spyware on your computer. So if you click on a link, you may instantly or almost instantly have malware or spyware installed on your computer. And that\u2019s also true on your phone.\u201d\n\nLevin said his firm has been successful in helping people retrieve their assets in these instances."

        "content": "Over 50,000 Bitcoin (BTC), worth $1 billion, were moved from multiple wallets connected to United States Government law enforcement seizures and transferred to new addresses, with some moved to Coinbase on March 8.\n\nAccording to data shared by on-chain analytics firm PeckShield, three transfers were made from U.S. law enforcement agency\u2019s wallets. These wallets held nearly 51,000 BTC seized by U.S. agencies from the Silk Road marketplace in November 2021. The confiscated BTC was consolidated into two wallet addresses.\n\nSilk Road Bitcoin moved to three different addresses. Source: Twitter\n\nOut of these three transfers, the majority appear to be internal transfers. However, approximately 9,861 BTC was sent to Coinbase. The other two include a 30,000 BTC transfer and a 9,000 BTC transfer.\n\nSilk Road BTC sent to Coinbase. Source: Glassnode\n\nThe Silk Road was an online black market and the first modern darknet market. It was launched in 2011 by its American founder Ross Ulbricht under the pseudonym \u201cDread Pirate Roberts.\u201c The marketplace was one of the first to accept Bitcoin payments, helping to popularize crypto use. U.S. law enforcement agencies confiscated multiple items from its founder, including hoards of BTC, which have been auctioned from time to time.\n\nRelated: Key Bitcoin price metrics point to BTC downside below $22.5K\n\nPopular Bitcoin proponent Tim Draper bought nearly 30,000 BTC in 2014 in one of these auctions. Another auction for 50,000 BTC was held in October 2015, where the U.S. Marshals Service auctioned 21 blocks of 2,000 BTC and one block of 2,341 in an online auction.\n\nWhile only a small portion of the 50,000 BTC was sent to Coinbase, the movement of billions worth of BTC from U.S enforcement agency-linked wallets evoked wild reactions and even wilder theories from Twitter users. One pointed out that if U.S. agencies decided to sell their Silk Road Bitcoin, it would put significant selling pressure on the market. At the same time, a few others questioned the timing of the sale."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) fell below a four-day narrow trading range near $22,400 on March 7 following comments by United States Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before the Senate Banking Committee. During the congressional appearance, the Fed chairman warned that he bank is prepared to tame inflation by pushing for more significant interest rate increases.\n\nPowell added that \u201cthe ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated\u201d and that recent economic data was \u201cstronger than expected.\u201d These remarks significantly increased investors\u2019 expectations of a 50 basis point interest rate hike on March 22, putting pressure on risk assets such as stocks, commodities and Bitcoin.\n\nThat movement could explain why the $565 million Bitcoin weekly options expiry on March 10 will almost certainly favor bears. Nonetheless, additional negative crypto market events might have also played a significant role.\n\nBitcoin from the Silk Road and Mt. Gox are on the move\n\nThe movement of multiple wallets linked to U.S. law enforcement seizures on March 8 added to the price pressure on Bitcoin investors. Over 50,000 Bitcoin worth $1.1 billion were transferred, according to data shared by on-chain analytics firm PeckShield.\n\nFurthermore, 9,860 BTC were sent to Coinbase, raising concerns about the coins being sold on the open market. These wallets are directly linked to the former Silk Road darknet marketplace and were seized by law enforcement in November 2021.\n\nMt. Gox creditors have until March 10 to register and choose a method of compensation repayment. The movement is part of the 2018 rehabilitation plan, and creditors must choose between \u201cearly lump sum payment\u201d and \u201cfinal payment.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear when creditors can expect to be paid in cryptocurrency or fiat currency, but estimates indicate that the final settlement could take several years.\n\nAs a result, Bitcoin\u2019s price drop to $22,000 on March 8 effectively confirmed bears\u2019 advantage on the March 10 options expiry.\n\nBulls placed far more bets, but most will be worthless\n\nThe March 10 options expiry has $565 million in open interest, but the actual figure will be lower because bulls have concentrated their bets on Bitcoin trading above $23,000.\n\nBitcoin options aggregate open interest for March 10. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe 1.63 call-to-put ratio reflects the disparity in open interest between the $350 million call (buy) options and the $215 million put (sell) options. However, the expected outcome is likely to be much lower, as bulls were caught off guard when Bitcoin fell below $23,000 on March 3.\n\nFor example, if the price of Bitcoin remains near $22,100 at 8:00 am UTC on March 10, only $6 million in call (buy) options will be available. This difference occurs because the right to purchase Bitcoin at $22,500 or $24,000 is rendered null if BTC trades below that level on expiry.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin clings to $22K as US dollar strength rises to December levels \u2014 What's next?\n\nThe most likely outcomes favor bears by a wide margin\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on March 10 for call (bull) and put (bear) instruments varies depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $20,000 and $21,000: 0 calls vs. 7,200 puts. The net result favors the put (bear) instruments by $150 million.\n\n0 calls vs. 7,200 puts. The net result favors the put (bear) instruments by $150 million. Between $21,000 and $22,000: 100 calls vs. 5,000 puts. The net result favors the put (bear) instruments by $105 million.\n\n100 calls vs. 5,000 puts. The net result favors the put (bear) instruments by $105 million. Between $22,000 and $23,000: 1,400 calls vs. 1,900 puts. Bears have a modest advantage, profiting some $55 million.\n\n1,400 calls vs. 1,900 puts. Bears have a modest advantage, profiting some $55 million. Between $23,000 and $24,000: 4,600 calls vs. 600 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $95 million.\n\nThis rough estimate takes into account only call options in bullish bets and put options in neutral-to-bearish trades. Nonetheless, this oversimplification excludes more complex investment strategies.\n\nA trader, for example, could have sold a call option, effectively gaining negative exposure to Bitcoin above a certain price, but there is no easy way to estimate this effect.\n\nTo turn the tables and secure a potential $95 million profit, Bitcoin bulls must push the price above $23,000 on March 10. However, given the negative macroeconomic pressure and the FUD emanating from Mt. Gox and Silk Road, the odds favor bears in this week\u2019s options expiry.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Typically, a rise in BTC inflow to exchange\u2019s wallet addresses increases the selling pressure on the asset and triggers a decline in the asset\u2019s price.\n\nBitcoin exchange inflow (total)\n\nAs seen in the above chart from CryptoQuant, a spike in BTC exchange inflow is followed by a decline in Bitcoin price, historically. As of now, the data for March 8 is incomplete, it cannot be said with certainty that the spike in inflow is driving a sell-off in Bitcoin.\n\nThe largest asset by market capitalization declined from $22,469 to the $22,000 level within the past 24 hours. It remains to be seen whether the rising selling pressure drives the asset lower, or Bitcoin sustains above $22,000."

        "content": "After U.S. lawmakers reintroduced the Financial Freedom Act in mid-February, there is fresh debate about the role crypto should play in retirement plans. The goal of the Financial Freedom Act is simple: Let Americans invest their retirement savings how they want, even if it means investing in crypto.\n\nThere's just one problem with that. Right now, the official guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor is that employers should not offer any crypto options in their 401(k) plans. Moreover, at the beginning of February, a trio of regulators -- the SEC, the North American Securities Administrators Association, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority -- warned against crypto exposure in self-directed individual retirement accounts (IRAs). With that in mind, here's a closer look at the pros and cons of adding cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC 1.72%) to your retirement portfolio.\n\nPros of adding crypto to your retirement portfolio\n\nThe overwhelming advantage to adding crypto to a retirement portfolio is the opportunity for truly life-changing gains. For example, over the period from 2011 to 2021, Bitcoin was the top-performing asset class in the world, and it wasn't even close. Over that time period, Bitcoin delivered annualized returns of 230% to investors. In comparison, the next-best asset class (big tech stocks) returned only 20% on an annualized basis.\n\nIf you're behind schedule on your retirement savings, or if you are planning on retiring early, it's easy to see the allure of investing in crypto. Rather than investing for 30 years in a relatively safe asset class and methodically churning out returns in order to save for retirement, Bitcoin theoretically gives you the option of investing for maybe 10 years and having a big enough nest egg to settle down and retire comfortably.\n\nCons of adding crypto to your retirement portfolio\n\nOf course, this type of thinking assumes two key things. One, it assumes that past returns are a reliable predictor of future returns. But that's not necessarily the case with crypto, which has a relatively short track record. Sure, Bitcoin might have a nearly 15-year track record, but newer altcoins come and go. Moreover, we don't really know how Bitcoin is going to perform in the future.\n\nSecondly, by putting a significant portion of your retirement assets into crypto, you are ignoring the fact that the crypto market is extremely volatile. At just the moment that you think you've reached your retirement savings goals, you could have your precious nest egg snatched away from you.\n\nThe past two years are a great example of this volatility at work. After a banner year in 2021, when just about every crypto approached all-time highs, the crypto market suffered through a house of horrors in 2022. Nearly every major crypto -- even Bitcoin -- fell by 65% or more last year. That means your retirement savings would have been largely wiped out if you were counting on crypto to finance your retirement.\n\nAnother big disadvantage to adding Bitcoin to your retirement portfolio is that there are few formal options available from top financial institutions. As long as the U.S. Department of Labor refuses to give a seal of approval to crypto for 401(k) plans, employers are going to be very leery about offering these plans. They have a fiduciary duty to protect their employees, and right now, crypto is not viewed as a responsible way to exercise that fiduciary duty.\n\nAs a result, individual investors are left with a DIY approach. In practical terms, this means opening up an account with a major cryptocurrency exchange and designating all funds in that account for retirement. But what happens if that cryptocurrency exchange turns out to be the next FTX (FTT -2.22%) and fails? Or what if you're investing in a lot of speculative altcoins instead of more trusted names like Bitcoin because you don't have access to professional investment advice?\n\nShifting sentiment in Washington?\n\nBased on the above, it's easy to see why there is such a contentious debate happening right now around the topic of crypto in retirement accounts. On one hand, you have free market advocates, who think the government should stay out of the game and the free market should decide what happens next. They point to examples like Fidelity Investments, which led the way in April 2022 with the introduction of crypto retirement plan offerings for employers.\n\nOn the other hand, you have the supporters of government intervention, who think the government has an important role to play in protecting individual investors from losing their retirement nest eggs. They point to examples like the recent meltdown of FTX as proof that investing in crypto is fraught with peril.\n\nThe 5% rule\n\nKeep an eye on this space. Things could change soon if the Financial Freedom Act eventually passes. For now, a good rule of thumb is that, for DIY individual investors, the maximum amount of retirement savings that should be allocated to crypto is 5%. This is the cap currently proposed by many financial advisors, and it ensures that the overwhelming majority of your retirement portfolio is tied up in less risky and less speculative assets. Thus, even if Bitcoin goes to $0, you won't face a complete obliteration of your retirement portfolio."

        "title": "Brace for BTC price volatility? Bitcoin 'coin days destroyed' metric jumps to 2-month highs - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "On March 8, addresses linked to the United States government moved 49,000 Bitcoin seized from the Silk Road, worth $1 billion. The transfer was accompanied by Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price slipping below $22,000 and a noticeable spike in a key holder metric.\n\nBut does this mean that traders should brace for potential BTC price volatility ahead?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s CDD metric suddenly spikes\n\nThe BTC transfer likely caused a significant spike in Glassnode\u2019s coin days destroyed (CDD) metric. It measures the weighted movement of Bitcoin based on the time it was last moved from an address.\n\nThe CDD is calculated by multiplying the amount of Bitcoin transferred by the number of days since BTC was last added to an address.\n\nA spike in the CDD indicator usually precedes price volatility, with the bears typically having a slight advantage. Some long-term investors, however, may also move Bitcoin to leverage it for more upside gains on the futures market.\n\nBitcoin coin days destroyed. Source: Glassnode\n\nBitcoin on-chain data shows no major sell-off signs\n\nBut the current CDD spike to a two-month high does not necessarily suggest that a $1,000 to $1,500 price move is brewing.\n\nFor instance, the exchange inflow data shows no significant spikes yet. Instead, around 5,000 BTC (worth around $100 million) was moved out of exchanges in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe netflow volume of BTC to/from exchanges. Source: Glassnode\n\nTherefore, the $215 million transfer to Coinbase has had little price impact so far. However, with only around 20% moving to an exchange out of 49,000 BTC, the risk of increased selling pressure remains.\n\nBTC/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nCurrently, the BTC/USD pair is trading above support between $21,500 and $21,950, which is encouraging for buyers despite a slew of negative news this week. Further confirmation will arrive with consecutive daily closes above this support area.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "The U.S. government moved a good chunk of its seized BTC to Coinbase.\n\nMarket participants think a BTC dump is incoming.\n\nBTC is currently trading down 1.4% on the day.\n\nThe crypto markets have enjoyed a great start to the year, with most coins and tokens going up significantly since January.\n\nHowever, the past few weeks have been increasingly challenging for digital assets. Cryptobank Silvergate is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, and the U.S. Federal Reserve has again turned hawkish and anticipates larger rate increases.\n\nFor Bitcoin (BTC), there\u2019s another threat in the short term. That threat is the U.S. government.\n\nThe Bitcoin community has been anxiously looking at the BTC chart since early Wednesday morning after reports indicated that the U.S. government has started moving their BTC holdings.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, a blockchain intelligence and data platform, U.S. government-related wallets moved around 40,000 seized BTC, or about $1 billion, in the early morning of Wednesday.\n\nMore importantly, 9,861 of the total BTC seized from the Silk Road hacker have been sent to Coinbase, fueling speculation that BTC will soon experience a surprise dump.\n\nApproximately 40k $BTC from wallets associated with US Government law enforcement seizures are on the move.\n\n\n\nOf these, the majority appear to be internal transfers (so far), however approximately 9,861 $BTC seized from the Silk Road hacker have been sent to our Coinbase cluster. pic.twitter.com/afuEYcV18L \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) March 7, 2023\n\nIf that were to happen, industry observers believe BTC could retest the $20,000 resistance zone, especially with the U.S. Federal Reserve turning hawkish on Tuesday and indicating further rate increases.\n\nU.S. Fed Indicates Rate Increases\n\nLast week, the news of Silvergate being on the brink of bankruptcy shocked the crypto markets, which saw billions of dollars vanish in 30 minutes. Bitcoin dropped around 5%, with ETH and other altcoins also dumping.\n\nOn top of that, the U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell indicated in his testimony on Tuesday that the Fed might need to introduce further rate increases to curb inflation. The current Federal Funds Rate is 4.57%, but market participants predict it will reach around 6% by the end of the year.\n\nBREAKING: Futures now see a 53% chance of a 50 bps rate hike in March.\n\n\n\nWe now have a near 35% chance that rates go to 6.00%+ this summer!\n\n\n\nJust a month ago, odds of a 50 bps rate hike were 1% and peak rates were expected at 5.25%.\n\n\n\nThe Fed pivoted, from hawkish to more hawkish. pic.twitter.com/ah4HRPVLpi \u2014 The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) March 7, 2023\n\nFor risk assets like BTC, higher-than-expected rates in the U.S. and worldwide would mean significant sell pressure in the coming months.\n\nBTC currently trades at around $22,000, down 1.4% on the day, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nThe U.S. government could have other plans related to their seized BTC.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nInvestors will potentially suffer short-term losses if the U.S. government sells its BTC. Investors should consider hedging against such an event.\n\nRead more about BTC technical analysis:\n\nIs Bitcoin in Trouble?

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) traders saw continued downward pressure after the 5.5% decline in BTC price on March 7. Higher odds of further interest rate increases by the U.S. Federal Reserve and regulatory pressure in the cryptocurrency space explain some of the movement.\n\nFinancial markets showed signs of stress as the inverted bond curve reached its highest level since the 1980s. Longer-term dated yields have stalled at 4%, while two-year treasury notes traded above 5% yield in March.\n\nSince July, longer-dated treasury yields have failed to keep pace with the surging two-year benchmark, resulting in the inverted curve distortion that typically precedes economic downturns. According to Bloomberg, the indicator reached a full percentage point on March 7, the highest level since 1981, when Fed Chair Paul Volcker faced double-digit inflation.\n\nThis week, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, increased its forecast for U.S. federal funds to 6%. Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, believes the Fed will keep interest rates high for \"an extended period to slow the economy and get inflation down to near 2%.\"\n\nFear of cryptocurrency regulation grows\n\nAccording to a Wall Street Journal report, the Biden administration wants to apply the wash sale rule to crypto, which would put an end to a strategy in which a trader sells and then immediately buys digital assets for tax purposes.\n\nFurthermore, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, an organization that keeps an eye on audits of public companies in the United States, recently put out a warning to investors about proof-of-reserves reports that auditing firms send out.\n\nThe organization, backed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said that \u201cInvestors should note that PoR engagements are not audits and, consequently, the related reports do not provide any meaningful assurance.\u201d\n\nLet's look at derivatives metrics to better understand how professional traders are positioned in the current market conditions.\n\nBitcoin margin markets have returned to normalcy\n\nMargin markets provide insight into how professional traders are positioned because they allow investors to borrow cryptocurrency to leverage their positions.\n\nFor example, one can increase exposure by borrowing stablecoins and buying Bitcoin. Borrowers of Bitcoin, on the other hand, can only take short bets against the cryptocurrency.\n\nOKX stablecoin/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nThe above chart shows that OKX traders' margin lending ratio dropped dramatically on March 9, moving away from a situation that previously favored leverage long positions. Given the general bullishness of crypto traders, the current margin lending ratio at 16 is relatively neutral.\n\nOn the other hand, a margin lending ratio above 40 is very rare, even though it has been the norm since Feb. 22. It is partially driven by a high borrowing cost for stablecoins of 25% per year. Following the recent anomaly, the margin market has returned to a neutral-to-bullish state.\n\nOptions traders are pricing in a low risk of extreme price corrections\n\nTraders should also analyze options markets to understand whether the recent correction has caused investors to become more risk-averse. The 25% delta skew is a telling sign whenever arbitrage desks and market makers overcharge for upside or downside protection.\n\nThe indicator compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options and will turn positive when fear is prevalent because the premium for protective put options is higher than the premium for risk call options.\n\nIn short, if traders anticipate a Bitcoin price drop, the skew metric will rise above 10% and generalized excitement has a negative 10% skew.\n\nRelated: US REPO task force names crypto as target in efforts involving $58B in sanctioned assets\n\nBitcoin 60-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas\n\nEven though Bitcoin failed to break the $25,000 resistance on Feb. 21 and then experienced a 14% correction in 16 days, the 25% delta skew remained in the neutral zone for the past month. The current positive 3% skew indicates a balanced demand for bullish and bearish option instruments.\n\nDerivatives data shows that professional traders are unwilling to go bearish, as evidenced by options traders' neutral risk assessment. Furthermore, the margin lending ratio indicates that the market is improving as some demand for bearish bets has emerged, but the structure remains neutral-to-bullish.\n\nGiven the enormous downward price pressure from a macroeconomic standpoint, as well as ongoing regulatory pressure in the United States, bulls should probably be content that Bitcoin derivatives have remained solid.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) has expressed a mixed stance on cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) after a year of war in the country.\n\nThe central bank of Ukraine sees both good and bad in digital assets, taking a more skeptical approach to crypto due to financial and economic issues caused by the invasion, according to the NBU press office.\n\nIn April 2022, the NBU prohibited citizens from buying cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin using the national currency, the hryvnia (UAH), only allowing such purchases via foreign currency accounts. The central bank also set a monthly limit on such purchases, prohibiting Ukrainians from buying more crypto than 100,000 UAH ($3,300) worth per month. The restrictions also apply to cross-border peer-to-peer transactions.\n\nThe administrative restrictions involving operations with cryptocurrencies in Ukraine are temporary, a press officer for the NBU told Cointelegraph on March 9. The limits will be \u201cgradually weakened as the functioning of the economy and financial market of Ukraine normalizes,\u201d the NBU said, adding:\n\n\u201cThe National Bank is taking part in building a system of transparent and understandable regulation, which will contribute to the development of fair and efficient circulation of virtual assets.\u201d\n\nAccording to the regulator, the specified restrictions were necessary for Ukraine in order to stabilize the situation in the foreign exchange market and preserve macro-financial stability.\n\n\u201cTransactions with cryptocurrencies can be used to bypass currency regulation, in particular \u2014 as a channel for unproductive capital outflow from the country, which currently poses threats to macro-financial stability,\u201d the NBU representative stated.\n\nRelated: Ukraine netted $70M in crypto donations since start of Russia conflict\n\nUkraine\u2019s central bank also sees risks of \u201csubstitution of the national currency and the emergence of parallel money circulation.\u201d According to the NBU, such risks are especially high during the war and are beyond the effective control of the regulator. \u201cThis can pose a threat to the monetary sovereignty of the state,\u201d the NBU spokesperson noted, adding:\n\n\u201cTo minimize such risks, especially during the full-scale war, the National Bank will take a strong position on preventing the narrowing of the scope of application of the hryvnia as the only legal means of payment in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nDespite taking a cautious approach to crypto during the war, Ukraine\u2019s central bank is still bullish on technological innovations related to digial assets. According to the NBU, there are many promises associated with crypto, including better access to financial services, competition in the field of payment services, the attraction of investments, crypto donations and other benefits.\n\nAs such, the central bank supports the need to create \u201ccivilized conditions for the development of the virtual assets market in Ukraine,\u201d the NBU press office stated.\n\nThe latest remarks from the NBU came soon after Yurii Boiko, commissioner of Ukraine\u2019s National Commission on Securities and Stock Market, declared that the war had no impact on the authority\u2019s regulatory stance. According to the official, Ukraine has continued to follow in the footsteps of the European Union concerning digital asset laws."

        "title": "Fed Chair Ponders Potential for Digital Dollar to Send Bitcoin to Zero - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nU.S. Congressman Stephen Lynch (D-MA) expressed concern Wednesday over the possible impact of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), asking Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to ponder the potential for a tokenized version of the U.S. dollar to wipe out other digital assets.\n\nLynch's comments came as Powell testified before the House Financial Services Committee, fielding a series of questions about digital assets.\n\n\u201cI'm worried about a lot of these stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cDo they go to zero when we come up with a CBDC that has the full faith and credit of the United States behind it?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Fed has explored the concept of issuing a digital dollar for years, publishing research as far back as 2016. CBDCs are similar to digital tokens in use today like stablecoins\u2014which track the price of a fiat currency\u2014but are managed by their respective governments instead of being issued by private firms on decentralized networks.\n\nPowell indicated it\u2019s unclear to him why any cryptocurrency that isn\u2019t \u201cdrawing on the credibility of the dollar\u201d like Bitcoin or Ethereum has any value at all, regardless of a CBDC\u2019s release. He refrained from commenting on how they could possibly be impacted by a CBDC as a result.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never understood the valuation of those,\u201d Powell said regarding coins that \u201c\u200b\u200bdon't have any intrinsic value, but nonetheless, trade for a positive number.\u201d\n\nHe also suggested it\u2019s hard to judge how stablecoins would be impacted, citing a lack of regulation in the U.S. that renders the reserves of some stablecoins opaque.\n\nStablecoins like Tether have faced penalties in the past for making false statements about their token\u2019s backing. And last month, Paxos said it was preparing for a potential lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission over its Binance-branded stablecoin BUSD.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLegislation that would provide a regulatory framework for stablecoins has been introduced on Capitol Hill several times, yet each bill so far has failed to gain momentum. Last summer's collapse of Terra\u2019s UST, a so-called algorithmic stablecoin that maintained its value via code instead of being backed by assets, created renewed urgency among lawmakers to establish rules of the road.\n\nEleven countries have already launched a CBDC and nearly 90 countries are either piloting, developing, or researching a CBDC, according to the Atlantic Council\u2019s CBDC tracker. Lynch asked Powell for an update on the Fed\u2019s timeline for potentially releasing one too.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t give you a date,\u201d Powell responded. \u201cWe engage with the public on an ongoing basis. We\u2019re also doing research on policy and also on technology.\u201d\n\nPowell said that the Fed hasn\u2019t yet determined whether a CBDC is an innovation that\u2019s even needed in the U.S., adding the central bank is not at the \u201cstage of making any real decisions.\u201d\n\nHe described the development of a CBDC as being in an early, experimental phase, adding the technology will take years to evaluate. However, Powell indicated that a CBDC could be rapidly rolled out to the public if it\u2019s decided upon by Congress, saying \u201cI think we can get this into the hands of the public very quickly.\u201d\n\nNew York\u2019s Federal Reserve bank has previously engaged in an experiment that simulated how a tokenized dollar could work among financial institutions, launching a pilot program last November that included firms like BNY Mellon and Citi.\n\nOther lawmakers, including French Hill (R-AR), asked Powell questions related to CBDCs, such as whether the Fed chairman still holds the belief that a CBDC would need authorization from Congress.\n\nPowell responded that the U.S. central bank might not need written approval from Congress to establish a CBDC, at least for financial institutions, explaining a \u201cwholesale\u201d CBDC could be a valid for settling transfers between banks and other financial institutions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPowell had previously said that establishing a tokenized version of the U.S. dollar would need written approval from Congress, but he clarified in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee that the need applies to a CBDC for \u201cretail\u201d consumers.\n\n\u201cWe've always been talking about [a] retail CBDC, and that's something we would certainly need congressional approval for,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThere are potential forms of a wholesale CBDC that we\u2019d need to look at. It's less clear.\u201d\n\nPowell added that it\u2019s also a valid question to ask why a wholesale CBDC would be needed, alluding to the upcoming launch of FedNow, an instant payment service for Federal Reserve Banks that is set to launch later this year.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers like Tom Emmer have pushed for legislation that would ban the Fed from releasing a CBDC, saying it would erode Americans\u2019 right to financial privacy. He reintroduced the legislation shortly after the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco started accepting job applications for CBDC developers and designers."

        "content": "While United States regulators increasingly scrutinize stablecoins, the community continues to pitch new ideas for stablecoins independent of the U.S. dollar.\n\nArthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX cryptocurrency exchange, has proposed creating a new stablecoin with a value pegged to the sum of $1 worth of Bitcoin (BTC) and one inverse perpetual swap of BTC against USD. He outlined the idea of the potential Satoshi Nakamoto Dollar (NUSD), or NakaDollar, in a blog post titled \u201cDust on Crust\u201d on March 8.\n\nUnlike major reserve-backed U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), the proposed NakaDollar will not depend on any USD reserves, but solely upon derivatives exchanges that list liquid inverse perpetual swaps, Hayes said.\n\nThe proposed stablecoin would be explicitly based on a set of short BTC positions and USD inverse perpetual swaps, maintaining its 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar via mathematical transactions between the new decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) \u2014 NakaDAO \u2014 authorized participants and derivatives exchanges.\n\nThe process of creating the NakaDollar stablecoin will be entirely free from any movements of USD, which require the services of banks, Hayes stated. He still noted that the proposed NUSD stablecoin would not be decentralized, adding:\n\n\u201cThe points of failure in the NakaDollar solution would be centralized crypto derivatives exchanges. I excluded decentralized derivative exchanges because they are nowhere near as liquid as their centralized counterparts [...]\u201d\n\nThe news comes amid the owner of Silvergate Bank, a major crypto-focused bank in the United States, shutting operations and liquidating business amid the ongoing market downturn. The shutdown came quickly after the New York Department of Financial Services abruptly ordered the Paxos Trust Company to stop the issuance of Binance USD (BUSD), one of the largest U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins on the market. As previously reported, Paxos held deposits in several banks, including Silvergate and Signature.\n\nRelated: \u200b\u200bStablecoins and Ether are \u2018going to be commodities,\u2019 reaffirms CFTC chair\n\nHayes is not alone in considering USD-independent stablecoins amid the ongoing pressure from regulators. In February, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao suggested that the cryptocurrency industry will likely move to other fiat currencies as a base for stablecoins, including euro, yen, or Singapore dollars."

        "title": "Bitcoin price falls to a multi-month low, but data points to a possible short-term bounce - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "March started off on a low due to a resurrection of inflationary fears. On March 7, hawkish comments from United States Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell amplified the market\u2019s expectation of a 50-basis point hike in the upcoming policy rate meeting on March 22 to March 23.\n\nOn March 8, the U.S. government\u2019s $1 billion Bitcoin (BTC) transfer of assets seized from Silk Road sparked fears of a sell-off. Later on the same day, the largest crypto-friendly bank confirmed its collapse and planned to liquidate its crypto positions voluntarily. The week\u2019s events sent Bitcoin to a two-week low of $20,050.\n\nA spike in negative sentiment may preclude a bounce\n\nThe flurry of bad news and price drops caused a significant dip in CryptoQuant's Coinbase premium index, which measures the difference in trading prices on Coinbase and Binance. Higher prices indicate stronger demand in the U.S. versus the rest of the world. The premium dipped to a two-month low on the morning of March 9 as negative news piled on.\n\nCoinbase premium index. Source: CryptoQuant\n\nOn-chain analytics firm Santiment reported fear, doubt and uncertainty (FUD) settling in the markets, increasing the \u201cprobabilities\u201d of contrarian price bounces during this \u201cperiod of disbelief.\u201c\n\nHowever, the funding rate for BTC perpetual swaps is still neutral, with no major liquidations in the futures market. It doesn\u2019t show considerable negative bias to suggest the possibility of a short squeeze. The Fear and Greed Index also slipped to two-month lows of 44 but stayed well above historic bounce levels between 10 to 25. This suggests that any positive rallies are likely to be short-lived.\n\nBesides negative sentiment, on-chain data shows positive accumulation among the most critical stakeholders, miners and whales. The holdings of Bitcoin miners have been on the rise since the start of 2023, heading for a six-month peak. Glassnode data also shows an increase in the number of Bitcoin wallets with more than 1,000 BTC.\n\nThe holdings of one-hop BTC miner addresses. Source: Coinmetrics\n\nThe on-chain Realized Price of BTC, which represents the average daily dollars moved through the Bitcoin network, currently sits at $19,800. Historically, this on-chain metric has formed a crucial bull-bear pivot line. If the prices slide back below this level, it could invalidate the early 2023 gains and throw the market back into a long-term bearish trend.\n\nThe elephant in the room: Fed rate hikes\n\nThe Fed\u2019s upcoming rate hike is the most important piece of the puzzle that traders need to solve before placing their bets. A higher Consumer Price Index print on March 14 could send the global markets to a risk-off environment heading to the Fed meeting later in the month.\n\nRelated: Fed signals a sharp rate hike in March due to inflation \u2014 Here\u2019s how Bitcoin traders can prepare\n\nTechnically, the BTC/USD broke below February lows of $21,400, triggering wider sell-off toward the $20,650 support level. The pair can slip back into a bear trend toward 2022 lows if this support breaks. Consecutive daily closes below this level will be a strong bearish sign.\n\nBTC/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe compilation of negative news over a bearish macroeconomic setting has led to an increase in market volatility, which could likely fuel a short-term upside bounce. However, the market\u2019s reaction to the CPI print and Fed\u2019s policy rate decision in during March remain crucial to momentum traders.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Neither taxpayer money, nor the FDIC [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation], are involved.\n\n\u201cHopefully, this situation serves as a needed reminder to regulators of the risk of concentration, which is certainly not unique to the crypto industry, and will cause them to encourage responsible distribution across the banking sector.\u201d"

        "content": "Ordinals are here to stay. Ordinals, or the ability to permanently ink the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain with data, typically in the format of a picture or JPEG, are a controversial topic among some members of the Bitcoin and wider crypto community. Not so for the builders and the CEOs of Bitcoin-focused companies who were present at the Advancing Bitcoin conference in London.\n\nCointelegraph asked several CEOs, builders and key opinion leaders for their views on Ordinals throughout the conference. The overarching sentiment ranged from curiosity to indifference to deference.\n\nAlex Leishman, CEO of River, told Cointelegraph that he doesn\u2019t have a stance on ordinals just yet, but has recently been gifted an Ordinal:\n\n\"In the abstract, the idea of having this sort of like meta-layer on top of Bitcoin that tracks Sats; that has a separate state or mapping onto the blockchain is really fascinating and could potentially be interesting for other things.\"\n\nFor example, Leishman said he recently played a clone of the classic computer game Doom (called Yet Another Doom Clone) on an Ordinal. \u201cSomeone had embedded Doom in JavaScript and in a small web page in an Ordinal,\u201d which Leishman loaded up from the blockchain.\n\nReal gameplay of Yet Another Doom Clone loaded from an Ordinal. Source\n\nEric Sirion, co-founder of and advisor to Fedi, and maintainer of the open-source protocol Fedimint, told Cointelegraph that he\u2019s also \u201cpretty neutral\u201d on Ordinals:\n\n\u201cEssentially, we cannot do anything about it in a way that is morally consistent. Like if we try to fight it, what gives us the right to do that? And also, we cannot effectively fight it. [\u2026] So yeah, why get worked up about it?\u201d\n\nSirion added that he\u2019s not necessarily a fan of Ordinals as they might blow up the blockchain a bit, but said: \u201cWho am I to tell other people what to do with the fees they pay like?\u201d\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain has since \u201cbloated,\u201d reaching an average block size all-time high, but fees have remained more or less consistent.\n\nAverage block size has soared higher since ordinals. Source: Blockchain.com\n\nBenoit Mazouk, CEO of U.K.-based Bitcoin exchange BitcoinPoint, shared Sirion\u2019s concerns about blockchain congestion. Mazouk explained that while he understands key Bitcoin opinion leaders, such as Blockstream CEO Adam Back, who commented that ordinals are \u201cuseless,\u201d he\u2019s \u201cmore into Bitcoin as a currency.\u201d\n\n\"you can't stop them\" well ofc! bitcoin is designed to be censor resistant. doesn't stop us mildly commenting on the sheer waste and stupidity of an encoding. at least do something efficient. otherwise it's another proof of consumption of block-space thingy. \u2014 Adam Back (@adam3us) January 29, 2023\n\nPerhaps a greater concern is that users can upload graphic images and offensive data onto the blockchain. Recently, shock porn was uploaded as an Ordinal.\n\nHowever, the permanence and censorship resistance works both ways: Leishman states that permanent records for potentially important or culturally significant events can be permanently etched into the blockchain. \u201cOrdinals can eventually become composable and it's really truly censorship resistant content,\u201d Leishman commented.\n\nRelated: Yuga Labs\u2019 first Bitcoin NFT auction nets $16.5M in 24 hours\n\nChristian Keroles, managing director at Bitcoin Magazine, recently posted a culturally topical reference to the censuring of Roahl Dahl books, questioning whether the minting of banned books on the blockchain as a form of preservation would be worthwhile.\n\nMaybe banned books are worth inscribing to Bitcoin \u200d\u2640\ufe0f https://t.co/WXpDYk4rzs \u2014 ck (going to Bitcoin 2023) (@ck_SNARKs) February 28, 2023\n\nIn all, Ordinals are beginning to change the way Bitcoin advocates use and approach Bitcoin. Ordinals offer another use case to the Bitcoin network over its first one: peer-to-peer cash. Leishman sums it up:\n\n\u201cMaybe the Bitcoin database has value for other things, and they're willing to pay for it, which is good for miners and maybe is what actually.\u201d\n\nMiners have earned more revenue per block since Ordinals\u2019 introduction, while video game fans can rest assured that a recreation of Doom is playable, loaded from the Bitcoin blockchain."

        "content": "The ongoing cryptocurrency winter and massive collapses in the industry do not mean that digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC) are doomed to fail, according to a major European asset manager.\n\nDespite BTC failing to protect investors against rising inflation in 2021 and 2022, Bitcoin\u2019s limited supply may still attract more attention if inflation remains above central banks\u2019 targets, according to investment executives at Paris-based investment manager Amundi.\n\nAmundi chief investment officer Vincent Mortier and macroeconomist Tristan Perrier on March 2 released a thematic paper analyzing the state and the perspectives of the crypto market. The executives argued that Bitcoin has failed to serve as an inflation hedge over the past two years due to \u201cdramatic rises in policy and market interest rates\u201d that pressured \u201call asset classes.\u201d\n\nAccording to the paper\u2019s authors, nominal interest rates are likely to stop surging or may even fall if inflation is high, but not rising. Such a situation would potentially lead to a bull market for Bitcoin, the Amundi investment execs said, stating:\n\n\u201cThis is a much more favorable environment for an asset whose supply is finite and that has a long duration in essence, as its main attraction is its future potential rather than its current status.\u201d\n\nThe analysts also provided five reasons why the recent setbacks in the crypto industry \u2014 including collapses of firms such as FTX and Celsius \u2014 may not mean the end of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe recent crisis is likely to bring more realistic expectations from the industry and \u201cseparate the wheat from the chaff,\u201d the Amundi executives said. They compared crypto to blue-chip tech stocks, which also experienced wild price collapses before starting to thrive. The analysts also noted that the current market downturn still comes in line with Bitcoin\u2019s historical price cycles.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price historical chart. Source: CoinGecko\n\nMortier and Perrier mentioned Ethereum\u2019s successful shift to a proof-of-stake blockchain, highlighting the industry\u2019s capabilities in reducing energy consumption. The executives also noted that the key value propositions of crypto, such as decentralization and immutability of transactions, have not been touched by the crisis.\n\nAnother reason is that prominent companies in finance and other industries have not stopped expressing their interest in crypto entirely, with heavyweights such as BlackRock acquiring a stake in Circle in 2022.\n\nRelated: France on the verge of passing stringent crypto firm licensing laws\n\nFinally, regulation will likely bring a more positive impact on the industry despite certainly causing temporary price setbacks, the analysts argued. They stressed that many regulators have eventually preferred not to put a blanket ban on crypto after several attempts and that advanced economies now see it as a possibility.\n\nDespite expressing some level of bullishness toward the future of crypto, Amundi\u2019s investment executives still noted that the real economic utility of crypto \u201cstill needs to be fully confirmed.\u201d That would need widespread use of public blockchains in the real economy and the associated non-speculative demand, the experts noted."

        "content": "The collapse of crypto exchange FTX and other bearish events in the space were at the center of discussions among lawmakers and witnesses at the inaugural hearing of the United States House Committee on Financial Services\u2019 Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion.\n\nAddressing lawmakers at the March 9 hearing, BitGo co-founder and CEO Mike Belshe criticized the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for enforcement actions against crypto firms \u201ctrying to do it right\u201d \u2014 i.e. communicating with regulators and pursuing a path to operate in the country. He cited BitGo\u2019s experience going through the process of approaching the SEC in 2018, seeking a regulatory path forward on the question of how the firm should custody assets, only to wait more than four years for a definitive answer.\n\nAccording to Belshe, the SEC\u2019s reluctance to address a \u201cbasic\u201d regulatory issue like the issuance of a Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund could have seemingly opened the door for bad actors like Sam Bankman-Fried to operate FTX as he did. The former CEO faces charges from the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and federal prosecutors related to transferring user funds between the exchange and Alameda Research.\n\n\u201cYou do have to wonder if we couldn\u2019t have avoided the massive amounts of money that flowed to FTX if the basic principle of a Bitcoin ETF had been provided and approved by the SEC,\u201d said Belshe. \u201cThere had been 25-plus valid applications \u2014 some from Invesco and other reputable firms that have done ETFs for many years in the past.\u201d\n\nBitGo co-founder and CEO Mike Belshe addressing the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion on March 9\n\nMuch of the discussion among lawmakers and industry experts at the hearing centered around which federal agencies could regulate certain crypto assets should Congress pass related legislation. Some Republican representatives seemed to be particularly critical of the Biden administration\u2019s approach to crypto, as evidenced in the hearing\u2019s title calling its actions an \u201cattack on the digital asset ecosystem.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis report summarizes President Biden\u2019s political plan to lawlessly abuse the administrative state to push American crypto firms and their United States customers into offshore, unregulated, opaque and unsafe markets,\u201d said Representative Tom Emmer, citing a Jan. 27 report from the White House on mitigating the risks associated with crypto. \u201cThis administration is weaponizing the banking sector to debank legal crypto activity here in the U.S., using scare tactics to run an entire industry out of the country.\u201d\n\n#HappeningNow: Chairman @RepFrenchHill convenes the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology & Inclusion for a hearing on the Biden Administration\u2019s attack on the digital asset ecosystem.\n\n\n\nTune In https://t.co/FGQaA37IYN pic.twitter.com/DqBA6O5rcc \u2014 Financial Services GOP (@FinancialCmte) March 9, 2023\n\nOther witnesses at the hearing were more critical of crypto as a whole rather than focusing on blaming any single agency, political party or presidential administration. Representative Brad Sherman, a well-known critic of the space, referred to crypto as a \u201cscourge\u201d in the economic system. Lee Reiners, the policy director of the Duke Financial Economics Center, claimed thatthough FTX was one \u201cbad apple,\u201d the entire crypto industry was \u201crotten.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrypto and the unique nature of crypto was what fueled FTX\u2019s rise, and it\u2019s what made FTX collapse in the blink of an eye,\u201d said Reiners.\n\nRelated: Samsung investment arm to launch Bitcoin Futures ETF amid rising crypto interest\n\nThe House subcommittee hearing was the first in the new session of Congress to address issues related to the crypto market and the collapse of FTX since December 2022.

        "content": "Countries lead blockchain adoption for various reasons, including recognizing its potential to transform multiple sectors of the economy, promoting innovation and economic growth, and creating a favorable regulatory environment to attract blockchain businesses.\n\nTypes of blockchain communities that lead blockchain adoption\n\nBlockchain communities refer to groups of individuals, organizations and companies involved in developing and using blockchain technology. These communities form to share knowledge, collaborate on projects and advance the adoption of blockchain technology.\n\nThere are different types of blockchain communities, including:\n\nDeveloper communities: These groups of blockchain developers work together to create protocols, programs, smart contracts and other blockchain-based projects.\n\nIndustry communities: Communities developed around specific industries or sectors, such as banking, healthcare and supply chain management, are known as industry communities. Members of these communities work together to create blockchain solutions that can handle the particular problems faced by their respective sectors.\n\nUser communities: Individuals that use blockchain-based goods or services make up these communities. They exchange information and offer feedback to enhance the usability and functionality of blockchain goods.\n\nInvestment communities: These groups have grown around blockchain-based ventures like cryptocurrency or startups that use the technology. Members of these communities engage in due diligence projects, exchanging knowledge and views about potential investment opportunities.\n\nSocial impact communities: These groups are focused on leveraging blockchain technology to solve problems in the social and environmental spheres. Members of these communities work together to develop blockchain solutions that could create a more just and sustainable world.\n\nCountries leading blockchain adoption\n\nBlockchain technology can potentially boost numerous industries\u2019 productivity, security, and transparency, reducing costs and enhancing customer experiences. Therefore, countries are investing in developing and using blockchain technology to address different societal and economic concerns.\n\nEl Salvador\n\nEl Salvador has emerged as a global pioneer in adopting blockchain technology after becoming the first nation to recognize Bitcoin as a legal tender. In June 2021, El Salvador\u2019s government established a law recognizing Bitcoin as a legitimate payment method for goods and services alongside the U.S. dollar, the nation\u2019s legal currency. Through this effort, the government aimed to prioritize financial inclusion in the country, where 70% of adults do not have a bank account.\n\nThe acceptance of Bitcoin (BTC) might make El Salvador a desirable location for international investors, a benefit mentioned by the country\u2019s president, Nayib Bukele. To encourage the widespread adoption of Bitcoin, the government implemented several actions. The $150 million trust fund in the state development bank \u2014 Banco de Desarrollo de El Salvador \u2014 was approved by the legislature\u2019s finance commission in August 2021. It was created to allow the automatic conversion of Bitcoin to the U.S. dollar, facilitating easy exchange between the two currencies for Salvadorans.\n\nThe nation debuted its Chivo (slang for \u201ccool\u201d) wallet in September 2021. Each wallet contained $30 in BTC. The government has established a network of crypto automated teller machines (ATMs) in El Salvador and 50 other U.S. cities, making sending money to their families easier.\n\nIn 2022, the crypto market crash affected the price of Bitcoin badly, raising concern for the Central American country that had invested so much in the cryptocurrency. However, Bukele showed no apprehension and, on the contrary, pledged to a dollar-cost average purchase of one BTC per day to confirm continued and full support for the digital asset.\n\nRelated: What is dollar-cost averaging (DCA), and how does it work?\n\nIn January 2023, El Salvador enacted the Digital Asset Issuance Law, establishing the parameters for a \u201cVolcano Bond\u201d\u2014 bonds backed by Bitcoin.\n\nPortugal\n\nPortugal has proactively created a favorable environment for blockchain and cryptocurrency startups. The nation has actively used blockchain technology in public services, healthcare and supply chain management. The Blockchain Panorama platform \u2014 which intends to encourage information exchange and cooperation among participants in the blockchain business \u2014 was introduced by the Portuguese government in 2019.\n\nSince then, Bitcoiners and crypto enthusiasts have flocked to the region, attracted by a pro-crypto environment offering the chance to use BTC in real life \u2014 paying bills and taxes with the cryptocurrency. Merchants\u2019 adoption has also increased, with Spanish startup BitBase working on bringing more Bitcoin ATMs and stores to major cities.\n\nIn 2021, the Portuguese government approved a decree establishing the basic conditions for the creation of technological free zones (ZLTs) to promote tech-based innovation. It includes helping the implementation of blockchain technologies through experimentation and testing.\n\nSince then, the country has started adopting more stringent regulations on crypto taxes to follow other European countries\u2019 legislation. In 2022, the government announced the reversal of a long-standing tax law that excluded crypto gains based on the assumption that they are not legal tender.\n\nSingapore\n\nSingapore is a leading country in blockchain adoption, with the government investing heavily in blockchain research and development. Due to its favorable regulatory climate, Singapore has become a hotspot for initial coin offerings (ICOs), with many blockchain businesses choosing to incorporate there.\n\nThe country\u2019s financial regulatory body, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), is leading the country\u2019s development of governance structures, technical standards and infrastructure to encourage blockchain and cryptocurrency adoption. Its primary role is to monitor and mitigate the crypto industry risks without hindering technological innovation.\n\nIn 2021, the crypto exchange Independent Reserve conducted a survey across all demographics of Singaporeans, revealing that 43% owned crypto. In 2022, a new survey by the same company highlighted that the population\u2019s interest, trust and confidence in the future of cryptocurrency and blockchain was very high, with 58% of the population interviewed perceiving Bitcoin as an investment asset and a store of value.\n\nMalta\n\nAlong with Singapore, Malta started to promote blockchain adoption as early as 2017, when it gained a reputation as the \u201cblockchain island\u201d after drafting some industry regulations to speed the growth of blockchain technology. In 2018, the Maltese parliament passed three laws providing a regulatory framework for blockchain and digital currencies to regulate ICOs, digital assets, digital currencies and related services.\n\nConcerning the taxation of crypto assets, Malta specified that electronic money and utility tokens are not listed as capital assets in the Income Tax Act, excluding them from capital gains tax. In contrast, securities and virtual finance assets are considered capital assets and subject to taxation.\n\nAt the end of 2021, the Maltese government included blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) within their commercial guide prospect and framework to commit to promoting the tech. The aim is to incentivize international companies to establish in Malta for testing and operating blockchain technology.\n\nMalta hasn\u2019t achieved \u201cblockchain island\u201d status yet. Consistent and increased international scrutiny over the island\u2019s domestic political and economic events led its leaders to pursue more conservative policies toward the industry than those previously promoted.\n\nHowever, many blockchain and crypto-focused businesses are thriving. For example, companies utilizing blockchain in the supply chain of products, like wine and olive oil, are a tangible reality on the island.\n\nRelated: How blockchain technology is used in supply chain management?\n\nUnited Arab Emirates (UAE)\n\nIn April 2018, the UAE government launched the Emirates Blockchain Strategy 2021 to become a smart region, with government services and private businesses powered by blockchain for more efficiency.\n\nThe region has always had a reputation for being the hotspot for digital innovation, and blockchain allows the government and businesses to save time, money and effort while allowing people to use a transparent and decentralized system. The UAE government is pushing for policies that welcome innovation in the metaverse and nonfungible token (NFT) marketplaces.\n\nRelated: Cryptocurrency regulation in the UAE and the Dubai Virtual Assets Law\n\nThe remaining emirates forming the UAE are aligning with Dubai and Abu Dhabi in implementing initiatives and regulations to promote blockchain and crypto businesses in the region. In February 2023, the Ras Al Khaimah (RAK) emirate announced the creation of the first free economic zone fully dedicated to virtual assets and digital companies, dubbed the RAK Digital Assets Oasis or RAK DAO.\n\nOther countries\n\nThe digital asset market \u2014 blockchain and cryptocurrency primarily \u2014 is growing worldwide. Neglecting some other regions that have become industry hotspots for innovation and investments would be unfair. Here are other top countries where adoption has grown massively in the last couple of years, encouraged by a crypto-friendly approach.\n\nUSA\n\nThe United States is home to the most extensive crypto ATM network. It is the highest contributor to the Bitcoin hash rate, implying that blockchain and crypto adoption is thriving in the country. While there is yet to be a consistent legal approach at the state or federal level, the government is trying to develop a more precise crypto regulatory framework to encourage adoption and investments.\n\nSwitzerland\n\nWith the city of Lugano aiming to become the cryptocurrency capital of Europe, Switzerland is one of the most exciting countries to watch in the blockchain space. The small European country welcomed blockchain and crypto payments as early as 2016, with a pro-crypto regulatory framework encouraging businesses to settle and invest in the area.\n\nSouth Korea\n\nSouth Korea has experienced a growing interest in blockchain and cryptocurrency, becoming a significant player in adoption in Asia. The country has taken a proactive but cautious approach to digital assets regulation to ensure the safe operation of the market for both consumers and entrepreneurs. Thorough attention is given to Anti-Money Laundering and combating the financing of terrorism laws to ensure market transparency and security.\n\nJapan\n\nJapan has always been at the forefront of Bitcoin and blockchain adoption since many Japanese were mining Bitcoin even when the cryptocurrency had little value. The first and most prominent Bitcoin exchange was Japanese-based Mt. Gox until it was hacked and halted operations.\n\nThe failure of Mt. Gox inspired the government to take measures to protect consumers while maintaining a leading role in the world\u2019s cryptocurrency market. In 2022, the Japanese government awarded seven mayors with NFTs for their achievements, granting more official status to the technology and encouraging its adoption.\n\nNigeria\n\nA Google Trend data analysis revealed that the adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrency had experienced a clear uptrend in Nigeria, especially after the 2022 crypto market crisis when the country emerged as one of the most crypto-curious nations. It also appeared among the top countries with a high global crypto adoption index, according to a report by crypto data analysis company Chainalysis.\n\nThe Nigerian population faces an uncertain domestic situation, with high inflation and depreciation of the country\u2019s fiat currency fueling an acceleration in the adoption of digital assets. The government seeks to implement a fair regulatory framework to protect consumers while encouraging innovation. In October 2021, the Central Bank of Nigeria launched the eNaira, a blockchain-based central bank digital currency (CBDC) pegged to the country\u2019s national currency, the naira. Nigeria is one of the very few countries to fully roll out a CBDC to the population, alongside the Bahamas and Jamaica."

        "content": "Leer en espa\u00f1ol\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s crypto barons went from eccentric social media personalities to private economic and diplomatic operators. The U.S.-born Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert are investors in the crypto company Bitfinex, directly linked to the stablecoin Tether. Raucous supporters of the adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender, they have become bureaucrats at the service of President Nayib Bukele. In two years, Keiser and Herbert \u2014who used to be propagandists for the Russian government\u2014 found in El Salvador an ideal entity to parasitize and put at the service of their agenda.\n\nBukele has given the couple the authority to design public policy that Salvadorans will eventually fund. On November 17, Bukele created the National Bitcoin Office by executive decree, requiring all executive branch offices to collaborate with the Bitcoin Office helmed by Keiser and Herbert. As part of their newfound posts in the Salvadoran government, the two were granted the ability to open \u201cBitcoin embassies\u201d in Europe and the United States.\n\nThe Bitcoin Office has recruited Salvadoran-American Bitcoin enthusiast Gerson Mart\u00ednez as one of its spokespersons. Mart\u00ednez says the office reports directly to Bukele. Its function, he clarifies, is to control the entry of crypto investors to the country. In other words, Keiser, Herbert, and Mart\u00ednez are gatekeepers of crypto investment in El Salvador.\n\nIt is not clear how Bukele funds the office, who works there, or whether the three are compensated with taxpayer money. Mart\u00ednez has denied receiving any compensation. However, for Bitfinex and Tether, the strategic value of the office goes beyond money. The state office is a hub for propaganda and corporate diplomacy for the crypto corporations. Bukele has given Bitfinex a diplomatic fa\u00e7ade providing an aura of respectability. It is not new for crypto barons to use fronts to gain legitimacy and access new markets at a moment of low public trust in their organizations. On March 3, The Wall Street Journal revealed how Bitfinex and Tether allegedly used fake documents and shell companies to open bank accounts and evade international financial controls.\n\nIn events organized by the Bukele administration, it is common to see Bitcoin gurus Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert attend as special guests. Photo: Carlos Barrera/El Faro\n\nThe executive order that birthed the Bitcoin Office suggests that the entity displaces and replaces Salvadoran diplomacy itself and, therefore, weakens the official role of Foreign Minister Alexandra Hill. Bukele has thus legalized an apocryphal diplomacy of crypto evangelists. When Salvadoran Ambassador Milena Mayorga met in Texas with Assistant Secretary of State Joe Esparza in February, within her \u201cdelegation\u201d was Keiser, identified as an \u201cadvisor\u201d to Bukele.\n\nWith Mayorga's support, Keiser and Herbert have begun to weave a parallel network to that of El Salvador's embassies and consulates. At a conference in Switzerland, Mayorga \u201cappointed\u201d Josu\u00e9 L\u00f3pez, a young Salvadoran residing in Switzerland, as Bitcoin \u201cconsul\u201d \u2014as he calls himself\u2014 in the European country. L\u00f3pez thanked Mayorga, Keiser, Herbert, Bukele, and even Michele Foletti, a member of the Lugano municipal council, for his appointment. He never mentioned Hill. Apparently, L\u00f3pez answers to Keiser and Herbert, and not to the Foreign Ministry, which has not included him in its list of ambassadors and consuls.\n\nThe Bitcoin Office appears to be Bitfinex\u2019s puppet embedded in the Salvadoran state. Among its responsibilities will be to design, dictate, and execute public policy projects, and to deploy a network of apocryphal diplomats serving as an echo chamber for official and corporate propaganda, merging both into the same choir. The office helps Bitfinex to navigate the troubled sea of cryptocurrency and the regulatory onslaught of these assets in the United States.\n\nBitfinex's appetite is not waning; the next domino is the release of the volcano bonds. These will be public debt issued by El Salvador, partly in exchange for funds to build Bitcoin City in La Uni\u00f3n. Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino has said that his company wants to commercialize the bonds.\n\nKeiser and Herbert are crypto maximalists who have learned to love financial and political centralization as long as it serves their interests. Rather than importing a new way of doing business, Bitfinex and Bukele replicate the old script that has plagued Salvadoran history: using the Executive branch as a Trojan horse for the personal and corporate interests of a few at the expense of the majority. Let\u2019s see what Bukele gets from this deal in return.\n\nRicardo Valencia is an assistant professor of communications at California State University, Fullerton. Twitter: @ricardovalp"

        "title": "Electrum Crypto Wallet Review - Money",
        "content": "Electrum is an open-source crypto wallet that was first released in 2011. Since then, it has become one of the most popular Bitcoin wallets due to its easy setup across devices, compatibility with major hardware wallets and open-source application.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a cryptocurrency wallet that offers the best desktop experience and are happy trading bitcoin only, then the Electrum crypto wallet could be the best crypto wallet for you.\n\nRead on for our review of Electrum's crypto wallet.\n\nBest desktop Bitcoin wallet\n\nElectrum is our pick for the best desktop Bitcoin wallet thanks to its easy setup process, compatibility with hardware wallets and open-source application structure. Electrum\u2019s desktop app also allows for a high degree of customization, making it an ideal desktop wallet for users well versed in crypto trading and who have programming experience.\n\nThe wallet does have some drawbacks, namely that it only supports Bitcoin and isn't ideal for beginners. Additionally, Electrum offers limited customer support compared to other popular wallets.\n\nWhile Electrum is compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux, the mobile version is currently only available on Android devices.\n\nElectrum crypto wallet pros and cons\n\nPros Easy setup process\n\nHardware wallet compatible\n\nOpen source application Cons Supports Bitcoin only\n\nLimited customer support\n\nPros explained\n\nEasy setup process\n\nElectrum focuses on offering a no-frills Bitcoin storage experience that is best for those looking for fast and secure Bitcoin trading. As such, setting up your Electrum Bitcoin wallet account is easy. You must download the free app from the Electrum website or the Google Play Store, set up two-factor authentication, create a new wallet and set your password.\n\nHardware wallet compatible\n\nThe Electrum Bitcoin wallet is compatible with several hardware wallet brands, including Ledger, Trezor and KeepKey. Using a hardware wallet allows you to store your private keys in an offline device, making it virtually impossible for them to be compromised by hackers or in a data leak. This adds yet another level of security that software wallets cannot attain on their own.\n\nOpen-source application\n\nOne of the biggest benefits of Electrum is that it's an open-source application. This means that Electrum has published its entire source code for users to inspect, evaluate and enhance. If you have some programming experience, you can modify this code to build entirely new features to suit your unique needs.\n\nCons explained\n\nSupports Bitcoin only\n\nElectrum is limited in its selection of supported cryptocurrencies. You cannot purchase Bitcoin with cash using Electrum or store any other cryptocurrency. This means you should look elsewhere for a crypto wallet that can store or exchange with other cryptocurrencies.\n\nLimited customer support\n\nElectrum does not offer direct customer support. Instead, it provides documentation on setting up two-factor authentication, using Electrum with the command line, and more. The official Electrum site also has a frequently asked questions page with more information about the service.\n\nElectrum posts updates and announcements on its official Twitter page, though it does not offer support over Twitter. If you've reviewed the official and unofficial documentation and can't find an answer to your question, you may have to seek support from the Electrum community by posting to BitcoinTalkForum, Reddit or GitHub.\n\nAds by Money.

Learn More\n\nElectrum crypto wallet offerings\n\nElectrum is a bitcoin-only wallet that offers security features like multisig and cold storage. That said, the wallet doesn\u2019t feature any other auxiliary services, so you\u2019ll have to look elsewhere if you\u2019re looking for a wallet that enables services like crypto staking.\n\nCold storage\n\nCold wallets store your keys or seed phrases, which give you access to your crypto on offline devices. This makes them much safer than hot wallets, which are always online. Electrum allows you to store your seeds in offline devices and make transactions without having to connect them to an online server, keeping them safe from hackers and data leaks.\n\nLightning Network connection\n\nElectrum offers Lightning Network transactions as a way to bypass the traditional Bitcoin transaction process. Instead of completing the entire transaction on the Bitcoin network, the Lightning Network only opens and closes the payment channels on-network, while the rest of the transaction is executed off-network. This allows for much cheaper and faster peer-to-peer (P2P) microtransactions.\n\nMultisig wallet\n\nElectrum offers multisig services to enhance the security of your wallet. With a multisig wallet setup, you can require two or more private keys, or signatures, to confirm all your transactions. Similar to multi-factor authentication, enabling multisig for your wallet adds another layer of security to your Electrum wallet, keeping your transactions more secure.\n\nElectrum crypto wallet pricing\n\nThe Electrum software wallet is free and users can download the mobile wallet from the Google Play store and the desktop wallet from the official website. There are no fees to set up your Bitcoin wallet. But, as with other crypto wallets, Bitcoin charges a variable fee for each transaction.\n\nElectrum transaction fees are paid in satoshis per byte. One bitcoin is made up of 100 million satoshis, so a fee of 300 satoshis is equivalent to 0.00000300 bitcoin. You can choose between Static, Mempool and ETA fees.\n\nStatic fees are fixed, range between 1 and 300 satoshis per byte, and do not depend on Bitcoin network conditions.\n\nMempool and ETA fees will depend on the blockchain network conditions at the time.\n\nETA fees will adjust depending on the estimated confirmation time that you select.\n\nMempool fees will vary depending on the volume of pending transactions on the blockchain.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that none of the three pricing structures is inherently cheaper than the rest. Although ETA and Mempool fees vary depending on market conditions, users can generally slide the fee scale to the lowest price of 1 satoshi per byte. So, even though the fee you end up paying could be the same with all three structures, the transaction speed will depend on market conditions.\n\nElectrum crypto wallet financial stability\n\nElectrum is free, open-source software, so it is not at risk of shutting down due to financial problems. It's a decentralized wallet, so you also don\u2019t have to worry about the reliability of one central server, since transactions are shared among a large number of servers.\n\nAds by Money. We may be compensated if you click this ad. Ad Unlock the world of Cryptocurrency Crypto Wallets make life on the blockchain simple and secure. Take control of your investment by downloading your wallet today. Learn More\n\nElectrum crypto wallet accessibility\n\nAvailability\n\nElectrum is available for download anywhere in the world. Since Electrum doesn\u2019t take fiat currency payments in exchange for Bitcoin, there are no limitations to who can use Electrum. All you need to set up an Electrum wallet is internet access to download the software, create your account and execute your transactions.\n\nKeep in mind that you may have some tax obligations depending on where you live, so make sure to take some time to learn more about how crypto is taxed.\n\nThe desktop version of Electrum is available as a free download for Python, Linux, Windows and MacOS. You can also download the mobile version of Electrum for Android from the Google Play Store.\n\nContact information\n\nElectrum does not have a dedicated customer service department. Since Electrum is an open-source software and not a company, it doesn\u2019t handle complaints and requests like a regular business would. Instead, you have to rely on help from the user community when you run into problems. If you need to report a bug or technical problem, you can do so on Electrum\u2019s GitHub page.\n\nUser experience\n\nSetting up Electrum on a computer and Android mobile divide is easy. However, Electrum\u2019s user interface is not apt for beginners. This wallet has been around since 2011, and its interface shows it. With outdated designs and unintuitive organization, this app can be difficult to navigate unless you have experience with other crypto wallets.\n\nIf you know your way around crypto wallets, you may appreciate Electrum\u2019s favor for functionality over design.\n\nElectrum crypto wallet customer satisfaction\n\nElectrum doesn\u2019t have a company profile on Better Business Bureau since it is open-source software. Thus, online customer satisfaction reviews of Electrum are limited. Electrum\u2019s Trustpilot profile has 16 customer reviews, with an average rating of 3.3 out of 5 stars.\n\nThe customers who gave Electrum a 5-star rating praise its speed, desktop app and low fees. The 1-star reviews complain about technical difficulties during setup.\n\nElectrum crypto wallet FAQ What's the difference between a hardware and software wallet? chevron-down chevron-up Hardware wallets use a physical device to store private keys, while software wallets use a computer's hard drive to store private keys. In other words, a hardware wallet is a device \u2014 usually a thumb drive or a similar device \u2014 that you can plug into a computer to store your wallet's private keys. A software wallet, on the other hand, stores private keys within your computer's hard drive. Generally, hardware wallets are considered more secure than software wallets since they're not connected to the internet. The biggest risk associated with hardware wallets is misplacing the physical device and thus losing access to your cryptocurrencies. Getting a hardware wallet can be a good idea if you're worried about falling victim to one of the recent Generally, hardware wallets are considered more secure than software wallets since they're not connected to the internet.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIf there was any suggestion that the hype around Ordinals\u2014a way of inscribing media onto the Bitcoin blockchain akin to NFTs\u2014had died down, that idea was dashed today. The buzz is only getting bigger and wilder, especially now that someone figured out how to mint a form of \"fungible tokens\" using the Ordinals protocol.\n\nOrdinal inscriptions surged to a new single-day peak of about 31,700 today, as of this writing, per a Dune dashboard that tracks public blockchain data. And it's all because of the launch of \"BRC-20,\" an experimental way to use the tech to let people mint and transfer whatever tokens they please via the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIt's the latest evolution in the Ordinals saga that has irritated some Bitcoin maximalists, yet also excited many creators and collectors about the expanding possibilities around the original blockchain network. Now the tech is being used in an analog to the ERC-20 token standard on Ethereum, but it's still very early and experimental.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAn experiment into \"brc-20's\" and fungibility on bitcoin with ordinals 1/x pic.twitter.com/9khKLbEPk6 \u2014 domo (@domodata) March 9, 2023\n\nA pseudonymous on-chain data enthusiast named Domo launched the BRC-20 implementation on Wednesday. Domo calls BRC-20\u2014short for \"Bitcoin Request for Comment\"\u2014an experiment inspired by another pseudonymous user's tweet along with the Sats Names (.sats) standard.\n\n\u201cI [heard] about the possibility of BRC-20 the past couple of days on Twitter and was curious if I could apply the .sats name format to create it,\u201d Domo told Decrypt via Telegram. \u201cBasically, what I was trying to do was to see if I could create an off-chain state with the tooling I had at hand (Dune Analytics) and inscriptions.\u201d\n\nThere have been 23,926 BRC-20 ordinal inscriptions in the past 24 hours. It only took 6 weeks for people to figure out how to use ordinals to make fungible meme coins. At this point, nothing surprises me. pic.twitter.com/CnHD3qRTcA \u2014 Leonidas.og (@LeonidasNFT) March 9, 2023\n\nDomo's Ordi token kicked things off on Wednesday, but meme-inspired tokens like Doge, Pepe, and even Meme itself have been deployed by users via BRC-20 and Ordinals since.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to Dune, the vast majority of Ordinal inscriptions created since the BRC-20 implementation went live are text-based. Altogether, more than 385,000 total inscriptions have been made via Ordinals to date, with nearly all of them coming over the last six weeks.\n\n\u201cThis fits into a larger trend of text-based inscriptions becoming more popular due to their small file sizes, which can be as low as a few bytes,\u201d pseudonymous NFT historian Leonidas told Decrypt on Twitter. \u201cBecause you pay fees proportionate to the file size being inscribed, it costs significantly less in fees to inscribe JSON [code] or text.\u201d\n\nMining pools really need to send @domodata a gift basket for all this fee traffic he is driving. Domo threw a toy out there and people jumped on it, now I'm going to need to sell a kidney to inscribe anything today. \u2014 Psifour (@Psifour) March 9, 2023\n\nLaunched in late January thanks to the Bitcoin network\u2019s Segwit and Taproot upgrades, Ordinals took the crypto world by storm as more and more enthusiasts came to the original blockchain network to mint what have colloquially been called Bitcoin NFTs. They don't function exactly like NFTs on Ethereum, for example, but the end result is similar.\n\nThe Ordinals protocol has been used for a wide array of on-chain media inscriptions thus far, including artwork, profile pictures, playable games, and video-based web apps. Even Bored Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs auctioned its own original art collection via Ordinals, yielding $16.5 million in the process.\n\nAccording to a report released last week by Galaxy Research, the rapidly rising Bitcoin NFT market could be worth $4.5 billion by 2025\n\nDespite the social media buzz around BRC-20 tokens and the rising inscription tallies to match, Domo said that by no means should it be considered the \"standard\u201d for Bitcoin-based tokens. They cautioned against anyone mass-minting such tokens on Twitter, calling them \"worthless,\" and recommends that other builders design and code their own, more robust solutions.\n\nBut it's a starting point. Even if it was meant as a fun experiment, the BRC-20 launch has already captured a lot of Bitcoin users' imaginations. Domo said that the responses have been better than expected.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI have yet to have any very angry reactions, which I\u2019m relieved about,\u201d they said. \u201cHowever, some of the more technically inclined have pointed out (and rightfully so) that there are much better ways of achieving what I\u2019m doing. And some others question why at all (fair enough).\"\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it was an experiment, and I think the majority understand that,\" Domo said. \"Those people seem to be having fun.\""

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe chairman of the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has taken a firm stance against the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC)\u2019s subtle power creep over the digital asset market.\n\nRostin Behnam told the Senate Agriculture Committee on Wednesday that Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency next to Bitcoin, is a commodity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been listed on CFTC exchanges for quite some time, and for that reason,\u201d said Behnam, who argued that it creates a \u201cdirect jurisdictional hook\u201d for the agency to police both ETH\u2019s derivatives market and underlying market.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHis opinion appears to directly contradict that of SEC chairman Gary Gensler, who argued last month that \u201ceverything other than Bitcoin\u201d falls under securities laws. While not naming any names, the chairman has hinted many times that this would include Ethereum\u2014especially after the network transitioned to a proof of stake consensus mechanism.\n\nUnder the Howey Test, a security counts as an asset sold to raise money from the public, from which they expect profits based on the efforts of others. Gensler\u2019s own words reinforced this in January 2022. However, under the securities act, the definition can be much broader.\n\nComments in late November suggested that Behnam had come to agree with the SEC chief that Ethereum fell under this umbrella, but his argument Wednesday shows that he is standing by his long-held position that there\u2019s room for more than one crypto commodity.\n\n\u201cWe would not have allowed the Ether futures product to be listed on a CFTC exchange if we did not feel strongly that it was a commodity asset,\u201d he elaborated, stating that his agency has \u201cserious legal defences\u201d to support their case.\n\nThe regulatory chiefs also disagree on stablecoins. While the SEC recently threatened to sue Paxos for issuing BUSD as an unregistered security, Behnam believes stablecoins should be considered commodities\u2014absent any legislation to claim otherwise.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBehnam cited an investigation into Tether during a 2021 lawsuit, after which Tether agreed to pay over $40 million to settle charges that it had lied about its dollar reserves.\n\n\u201cExamining the circumstances around the Tether case, it was clear to our enforcement team and the commission that the Tether stablecoin was a commodity, and that we needed to move forward, and swiftly, to police that market,\u201d he said."

        "content": "Bitcoin detractor and economist Peter Schiff has taken another swipe at the digital asset and MicroStrategy, a public company that is heavily invested in the digital asset. Schiff has always been vocal about his disdain for bitcoin and has now turned his attention to MicroStrategy and its former CEO, Michael Saylor.\n\nWhy MicroStrategy Bought Bitcoin\n\nIn a tweet, Peter Schiff revealed to his more than 890,000 Twitter followers what he says was the real reason behind Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy\u2019s move to begin investing in bitcoin. According to Schiff, former CEO Michael Saylor had admitted that buying BTC was actually a last-ditch effort to save the company from being liquidated. He further dissed the company saying that it has nothing going for it other than a leveraged speculative position on the digital asset.\n\nFor the first time I heard @saylor admit that adding #Bitcoin to the @MicroStrategy balance sheet was basically a Hail Mary to avoid liquidating the company. If the only thing $MSTR has going for it is a leveraged speculative position in Bitcoin, than it has nothing going for it. \u2014 Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 20, 2022\n\nAs expected, Schiff\u2019s strikes toward bitcoin were met with pushback from supporters. One user took to the comment section to defend MicroStrategy\u2019s decision as one that was taken so it could acquire the \u201cscarcest and most desirable asset the world has ever seen.\u201d However, Schiff would denounce this saying that bitcoin was in no way scarce nor was it desirable. He also added that bitcoin was a way to lose money.\n\nSchiff continues to advocate for gold as a better option for investors. Bitcoin maximalist Dan Held hit back at the economist saying, \u201c[Gold] is hardly scare and in no way desirable. If you want to lose your money there are plenty of ways to do it. You don\u2019t need to buy [Gold].\u201d\n\nBTC touches above $16,800 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nSo Why Did Saylor Buy BTC?\n\nMichael Saylor is arguably one of the most vocal bitcoin bulls. The ex-CEO of MicroStrategy has previously stated that his decision to purchase bitcoin was that he believed that the digital asset is the future of finance. Additionally, Saylor previously revealed that he had personally owned BTC before MicroStrategy had begun purchasing the cryptocurrency, his own personal holdings serving as evidence for the profitability of the asset.\n\nAs the company expects the price of bitcoin to appreciate over time, it believes that it will serve as an effective inflation hedge over the long term. Saylor himself has referred to BTC as \u201cdigital gold, saying \u201cWe find the global acceptance, brand recognition, ecosystem vitality, network dominance, architectural resilience, technical utility, and community ethos of Bitcoin to be persuasive evidence of its superiority as an asset class for those seeking a long-term store of value.\u201d\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s decision to invest in bitcoin also helped boost the popularity of the company, going from a company operating in the background to one of the most popular names among cryptocurrency enthusiasts.\n\nMicroStrategy is currently the public company with the largest BTC holdings in the world. The company held 130,000 BTC as of Sep. 30, 2022, worth over $2.1 billion at current market prices. At a cumulative entry value of almost $4 billion, the company is recording more than $1.7 billion in unrealized losses following the market downturn.\n\nFeatured image from Blockchain Reporter, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "If there was any suggestion that the hype around Ordinals\u2014a way of inscribing media onto the Bitcoin blockchain akin to NFTs\u2014had died down, that idea was dashed today. The buzz is only getting bigger and wilder, especially now that someone figured out how to mint a form of \"fungible tokens\" using the Ordinals protocol.\n\nOrdinal inscriptions surged to a new single-day peak of about 31,700 today, as of this writing, per a Dune dashboard that tracks public blockchain data. And it's all because of the launch of \"BRC-20,\" an experimental way to use the tech to let people mint and transfer whatever tokens they please via the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIt's the latest evolution in the Ordinals saga that has irritated some Bitcoin maximalists, yet also excited many creators and collectors about the expanding possibilities around the original blockchain network. Now the tech is being used in an analog to the ERC-20 token standard on Ethereum, but it's still very early and experimental.\n\nAn experiment into \"brc-20's\" and fungibility on bitcoin with ordinals 1/x pic.twitter.com/9khKLbEPk6 \u2014 domo (@domodata) March 9, 2023\n\nA pseudonymous on-chain data enthusiast named Domo launched the BRC-20 implementation on Wednesday. Domo calls BRC-20\u2014short for \"Bitcoin Request for Comment\"\u2014an experiment inspired by another pseudonymous user's tweet along with the Sats Names (.sats) standard.\n\n\u201cI [heard] about the possibility of BRC-20 the past couple of days on Twitter and was curious if I could apply the .sats name format to create it,\u201d Domo told Decrypt via Telegram. \u201cBasically, what I was trying to do was to see if I could create an off-chain state with the tooling I had at hand (Dune Analytics) and inscriptions.\u201d\n\nThere have been 23,926 BRC-20 ordinal inscriptions in the past 24 hours. It only took 6 weeks for people to figure out how to use ordinals to make fungible meme coins. At this point, nothing surprises me. pic.twitter.com/CnHD3qRTcA \u2014 Leonidas.og (@LeonidasNFT) March 9, 2023\n\nDomo's Ordi token kicked things off on Wednesday, but meme-inspired tokens like Doge, Pepe, and even Meme itself have been deployed by users via BRC-20 and Ordinals since.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Dune, the vast majority of Ordinal inscriptions created since the BRC-20 implementation went live are text-based. Altogether, more than 385,000 total inscriptions have been made via Ordinals to date, with nearly all of them coming over the last six weeks.\n\n\u201cThis fits into a larger trend of text-based inscriptions becoming more popular due to their small file sizes, which can be as low as a few bytes,\u201d pseudonymous NFT historian Leonidas told Decrypt on Twitter. \u201cBecause you pay fees proportionate to the file size being inscribed, it costs significantly less in fees to inscribe JSON [code] or text.\u201d\n\nMining pools really need to send @domodata a gift basket for all this fee traffic he is driving. Domo threw a toy out there and people jumped on it, now I'm going to need to sell a kidney to inscribe anything today. \u2014 Psifour (@Psifour) March 9, 2023\n\nLaunched in late January thanks to the Bitcoin network\u2019s Segwit and Taproot upgrades, Ordinals took the crypto world by storm as more and more enthusiasts came to the original blockchain network to mint what have colloquially been called Bitcoin NFTs. They don't function exactly like NFTs on Ethereum, for example, but the end result is similar.\n\nThe Ordinals protocol has been used for a wide array of on-chain media inscriptions thus far, including artwork, profile pictures, playable games, and video-based web apps. Even Bored Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs auctioned its own original art collection via Ordinals, yielding $16.5 million in the process.\n\nWhat Are Ordinals? A Beginner's Guide to Bitcoin NFTs\n\nAccording to a report released last week by Galaxy Research, the rapidly rising Bitcoin NFT market could be worth $4.5 billion by 2025\n\nDespite the social media buzz around BRC-20 tokens and the rising inscription tallies to match, Domo said that by no means should it be considered the \"standard\u201d for Bitcoin-based tokens. They cautioned against anyone mass-minting such tokens on Twitter, calling them \"worthless,\" and recommends that other builders design and code their own, more robust solutions.\n\nBut it's a starting point. Even if it was meant as a fun experiment, the BRC-20 launch has already captured a lot of Bitcoin users' imaginations. Domo said that the responses have been better than expected.\n\n\u201cI have yet to have any very angry reactions, which I\u2019m relieved about,\u201d they said. \u201cHowever, some of the more technically inclined have pointed out (and rightfully so) that there are much better ways of achieving what I\u2019m doing. And some others question why at all (fair enough).\"\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it was an experiment, and I think the majority understand that,\" Domo said. \"Those people seem to be having fun.\""

        "title": "Bitcoin Miners Show Signs Of Dumping, Bad For Rally? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "On-chain data shows Bitcoin miners could be dumping right now, a sign that could provide an impedance to the rally.\n\nBitcoin Miners\u2019 Position Index Has Shot Up Recently\n\nAs pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, miners may be putting selling pressure on the market currently. The relevant indicator here is the \u201cMiners\u2019 Position Index\u201d (MPI), which measures the ratio between the miner outflows and the 365-day moving average of the same.\n\nThe \u201cminer outflows\u201d refer to the total amount of Bitcoin that all these chain validators are transferring out of their wallets at the moment. Usually, miners withdraw coins from their reserves with the main purpose of selling them. Thus, a high value of the outflows can suggest that this cohort is dumping large amounts right now.\n\nAs the MPI compares these outflows with their yearly average, the metric\u2019s value can tell us how the current miner selling is compared with the mean for the last 365 days.\n\nWhen this indicator has a high value, it means miners are selling at a higher degree than usual currently, while the metric having a low value could suggest there is lesser selling pressure coming from these chain validators than the average for the past year.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin MPI over the past year and a half:\n\nThe value of the metric seems to have been quite high in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nAs shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin MPI has spiked up recently and has hit a value of about 4, the highest level that the indicator has observed since April of last year. The metric having such a large value would suggest miners are taking out way more coins than usual, and are therefore potentially putting extraordinary selling pressure on the market currently.\n\nFrom the chart, it\u2019s apparent that spikes in the metric have usually been followed by declines in the price of the crypto. The most extreme example was back in April 2022, when the price saw a very sharp drawdown not too long after the metric recorded even higher values than now.\n\nThe last time the indicator observed high values were back during the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX when the price once again saw a rapid downward move.\n\nBitcoin has been busy rallying during the past week or so, touching as high as $21,000 so far, so these increased withdrawals right now would suggest miners want to take advantage of this profit-taking opportunity while they still can, and dump their coins.\n\nIf this cohort indeed intends to sell with these transfers, then the crypto\u2019s rally could possibly find some impedance and temporarily halt here, if not outright reverse its direction.\n\nBTC Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $20,800, up 20% in the last week.\n\nThe value of the asset seems to be finding it hard to make a significant break above $21,000 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, CryptoQuant.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The relationship between the stock market and the cryptocurrency sector has been a matter of interest for quite some time now, and recently the correlation between Bitcoin (BTC), the largest digital asset by market capitalization, and the Nasdaq 100 index has recorded its lowest levels in a year.\n\nAs it happens, the correlation of daily returns between the Nasdaq 100 and Bitcoin has dropped to the lowest level since the United States Federal Reserve signaled rates hiking at the beginning of 2022, the crypto trading and investment platform CoinShares said on March 8.\n\nNasdaq 100 and Bitcoin correlation. Source: CoinShares\n\nSpecifically, the (de)correlation level between the two at press time stood at 34%, close to that from February 2022, increasing soon after. According to the platform, the current \u201cdecorrelation could continue as the Fed rate hikes slow, further anchoring Bitcoin as an interest rate-sensitive asset.\u201d\n\nEssentially, Bitcoin previously had the tendency to move in the same direction as the large companies listed on the Nasdaq 100 index, leading some financial experts to see this as an argument against the digital asset\u2019s role as a diversifier. However, the recent decorrelation might prove them wrong.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nIndeed, as things stand, the representative decentralized finance (DeFi) asset is currently changing hands at the price of $21,701, which demonstrates a decrease of 1.44% on the day, in addition to the losses of 8.18% and 4.76% on its weekly and monthly charts, respectively.\n\nBitcoin 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nMeanwhile, the crypto market has continued to crash under significant selling pressure and the increasing \u2018FUD\u2019 (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) in recent days, which have together managed to pull its market cap to decline below the $1 trillion psychological threshold.\n\nAdding to the FUD, the U.S. government has moved $1 billion worth of Bitcoin it seized from the anonymous darknet marketplace Silk Road in 2021 and 2022, propping up fears of an imminent BTC dump, which could exert even more pressure on the market and see BTC lose more support levels.\n\nHowever, this could also represent a good opportunity to buy the maiden crypto before its price increases again, as Bitcoin has been demonstrating a steady pattern of optimal times for decision-making in crypto trading strategies \u2013 buy, hodl, and sell \u2013 over the past years.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "The Bitcoin price is under heavy pressure due to fears of \u201csticky\u201d inflation and yesterday\u2019s ultra-hawkish comments from U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) chairman Jerome Powell. At press time, BTC was trading just above $22,000 and continued to show no strength yet.\n\nAt this time comes news that the US government is in the process of selling off some of its seized Bitcoin. Blockchain security firm PeckShield first reported that addresses associated with the US government transferred 49,000 BTC worth $1.08 billion today, which were seized from the Silk Road hacker.\n\nOf that total, 9,826 BTC worth $217 million were transferred to Coinbase and 39,175 BTC worth $867 million were transferred to two new addresses. On-chain data provider Glassnode confirmed this, adding that most (so far) appear to be internal transfers, but approximately 9,861 BTC were sent to a Coinbase cluster.\n\nGlassnode also shared the chart below, displaying the estimated Bitcoin balance of the US government.\n\nPeckShield also stated that about 51,351.9 BTC of Silk Road Crime Proceeds were seized by the US government in November 2021 and March 2022 and clustered into 2 addresses.\n\nThe seized Bitcoin from founder Ross Ulbricht\u2019s legendary darknet platform \u201cSilk Road\u201d make up a large portion of the US government\u2019s holdings. While Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison without parole in 2015, he was ordered to pay $183 million in restitution related to Silk Road\u2019s total sales.\n\nBefore the marketplace was shut down, Silk Road experienced a hack in which 69,370 BTC were stolen. The government seized these Bitcoins in November 2020, and Ulbricht relinquished all rights to the Bitcoin and used them to pay the restitution.\n\nWill The US Government Impact The Bitcoin Price?\n\nA Bitcoin dump by the US government does not seem very likely according to current information. The 9,826 BTC presumably sent to Coinbase is too little to affect the price. The other funds moved appear to be internal transfers only.\n\nTherefore, a warning of a dump is by no means appropriate. Moreover, it should be emphasized that the U.S. government usually chooses a different way to sell seized Bitcoin. Usually, the sale is done through General Services Administration (GSA) auctions, where confiscated Bitcoins are auctioned off in lots to willing buyers without affecting the price.\n\nAt press time, the BTC price had to fight off the macro economic headwinds and was trading at $22,025. The $21,900 price level continues to serve as the key support for BTC.\n\nShould the level be breached to the south, a new lower low would be in play. Of particular importance then becomes the price level around $21,600 to write a higher low and maintain the uptrend in the 1-day chart.\n\nFeatured image from Medium, Chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Estimates do not guarantee end-of-month prices.\n\nWhile Bitcoin (BTC) rallied for the first 45 days of the year, its price has been more bearish in recent weeks due to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) continued crackdown on crypto firms and Silvergate Capital Corporation, the holding company of crypto-focused Silvergate Bank decision to wind down operations.\n\nThe volatility has left many in the cryptocurrency community confused about the future price of the maiden digital asset, with many traders turning to deep learning algorithms to forecast the coin\u2019s price for the end of the month.\n\nBesides the artificial intelligence (AI) price estimation, the thoughts of the crypto community over at CoinMarketCap, which have an 81% historical accuracy of predicting Bitcoin\u2019s price over the last six months, are also worth examining. Notably, the most recent estimation accuracy for the end of February was 89.63%.\n\nBitcoin 6-month estimation accuracy.

Further, such dealers and exchanges will now have to report any suspicious activity to the government agencies. This will enable government to keep a closer watch on the crypto trading activities,\" said Shashank Agarwal, Advocate, Delhi High Court.The Indian Government imposed Anti-Money Laundering provisions on Virtual Digital Assets (VDA) vide Ministry of Finance notification dated 7th March 2023. As a result, VDA service providers / businesses have now become the \u2018reporting entities\u2019 under PMLA Act, and they have to follow similar reporting standards and KYC norms as the other regulated entities like banks, securities intermediaries, payment system operators, etc. do.This means that any financial wrongdoing involving cryptocurrency assets can now be investigated by the Enforcement Directorate.The definition of \u2018virtual assets\u2019 would be the same as that in the Income-Tax Act, the notification stated. The definition includes cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens. With the imposition of the new rules, Indian crypto exchanges will have to report suspicious activity to the Financial Intelligence Unit India (FIU-IND).It also mandates entities dealing in crypto to follow KYC, anti-money laundering regulations and due diligence as followed by banking and other financial entities which fall under the classification of reporting entities under PMLA.\"Cryptocurrency industry members will now be required to undertake the necessary steps to verify and maintain accounts of individuals, transactions, and report any suspicious activity to the Financial Intelligence Unit. Additional compliance requirements such as verification of source of funds, ownership and financial positions will further lend credibility to an industry, which has been subject to severe regulatory attention over the last few years. This move also empowers the government to access the information stored by crypto exchanges at any point in time,\" said Bagmisikha Puhan, (Associate Partner TMT Law Practice.\u201cCryptocurrency transactions continue to lack transparency and the trail is difficult to establish. This move pushes responsibility on the cryptocurrency markets to bring transparency to cryptocurrency trading,\u201d said Prashant Garg, partner, technology consulting, EY.\u201cThe responsibility of maintaining transparency, identity, and following regulations is on cryptocurrency exchanges. Globally, banks are severing ties with exchanges, straining the exchanges and forcing them to look for an alternative model,\u201d said Garg.\"The new rules are introduced to prevent misuse of crypto, such as money laundering, and they do not stop the regular, KYC-verified conversion of crypto to INR users do on the CoinSwitch app or CoinSwitch PRO platforms. We took a conscious decision in 2021 to limit crypto movement within our KYC-compliant ecosystem to ensure transparency and compliance with the laws of the land,\" said Ashish Singhal, Co-founder & CEO, CoinSwitch.\" In this digital era of finance, compliance is a must not just to safeguard interest of investors but also of the country and in this aspect the crypto industry is becoming increasingly important, governments and regulators around the world are paying closer attention to this rapidly evolving space. We welcome the government move for bringing \u2018money laundering provisions\u2019 in the crypto sector. Moreover, we see this as a step forward to make the \u2018Indian crypto market\u2019 having a compliant framework for Investment in \u2018crypto currency\u2019,\" said Lavin Kotian - CTO and Cofounder, TransBnk.\"The move by India to impose money laundering provisions on cryptocurrencies shows that governments around the world are recognizing the importance of having clear regulations in place for cryptocurrencies, which can help prevent criminal activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing. While this may lead to some short-term challenges for cryptocurrency traders and investors, it could ultimately lead to a more stable and trustworthy environment for the industry to thrive in the long run,\" said Vijay Pravin Maharajan, Founder & CEO, bitsCrunch.As per the Indian laws, \u201cwhosoever directly or indirectly attempts to indulge or knowingly assists or knowingly is a party who is actually involved in any process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime and projecting it as untainted property shall be guilty of offence of money laundering\u201d.\" For the crypto space this means that if an individual is transferring crypto having a monetary value without complete disclosure to the government and the receiver is not reporting that as income or a payment, both parties can be held liable under the money laundering act. It is relatively easy for an individual to open a crypto wallet without having the need to disclose their identity or fulfil any KYC requirements and load funds in the form of crypto. The interesting part about this is that there is no limit to transfers, no transaction trail, valued at par globally, doesn\u2019t require government approvals, and can easily be sent within a few minutes,\" said Abhinav Soomaney, Managing partner at CryptoTax International Pvt Ltd.As stated in the money laundering section, \u201cwhoever commits the offence of money laundering shall be punishable with rigorous punishment for a term no less than three years, but which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine which may extend to five lakh rupees\u201d.\" If there are laws and guidelines against crypto laundering, investors will have the fear of being penalized. To make things more streamlined, exchanges in India must track transfers made by investors within a tax year exceeding a certain amount and report the same to the tax authorities. It is very important to note that this law will be applicable to crypto traders, safekeepers, and financial service providers which will include exchange platforms and blockchain startup companies as well,\" said Soomaney.Enforcement Directorate and Income Tax Department are already probing several such money laundering cases against companies running cryptocurrency exchanges and transactions and nearly Rs 936 crore related to crypto currency has been attached or seized under PMLA, so far.In the last one year, Enforcement Directorate and Income Tax Department have already probied at least 10 crypto exchanges for allegedly assisting foreign firms launder money via crypto. The probe had unearthed instances of the accused firms approaching the exchanges to buy crypto coins for more than Rs 100 crore and crypto coins being sent to international wallets. In many cases, the KYC details (know your customer) collected by the exchanges were found to be dubious. The government agency estimates the accused firms laundered more than Rs 1,000 crore in the instant loan app case, adding that most of the allegations have a China link.Under Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA), assets amounting to Rs 289.28 crore have been seized under section 37A of FEMA and one show-cause notice to crypto currency exchange Zanmai Labs Pvt Ltd, known as WazirX and its directors under FEMA for transactions involving cryptocurrencies work Rs 2,790 crore has also been issued.The government notification is expected to aid investigative agencies in carrying out their actions against crypto companies.\"This notification reflects Central Government\u2019s intention to regulate the VDA space rather than an outright ban, which is a welcome step. It will be interesting to see how VDA service providers / businesses streamline their services to accommodate the PMLA obligations without any industry specific governing body overlooking. Overall, this has tightened the governance of VDA service providers/ businesses, which results in more depth in this large ambiguously regulated industry\" said Diviay Chadha, Partner, Singhania & Co. LLP.Last month, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told Parliament that India was discussing with the G-20 member countries the need to develop a standard operating protocol for regulating crypto assets.She had said crypto assets and Web3 are relatively new and evolving sectors and require significant international collaboration for any specific legislation on these sectors to be fully effective.Crypto assets are by definition borderless and require international collaboration to prevent regulatory arbitrage. Therefore, any legislation for regulation or for banning can be effective only with significant international collaboration on the evaluation of the risks and benefits and evolution of common taxonomy and standards.In April 2022, India introduced a 30 per cent income tax on gains made from cryptocurrencies. In July 2022, rules regarding 1 per cent tax deducted at source on cryptocurrency came into effect.The Reserve Bank of India has so far cautioned people against crypto assets. In January, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said investing in crypto was akin to gambling and will even undermine the power of the central bank if allowed to grow unchecked. \u201cIf crypto is allowed in India, the RBI will lose control over monitoring transactions,\" Das had said.India, which currently holds the G20 presidency, has been pushing for a collective global effort to regulate VDAs and mitigate its potential risks. During the latest G20 meeting, which ended on Saturday, Sitharaman held a seminar for member states to share their concerns regarding the risks of cryptocurrencies while discussing how to come up with a common framework.17 lakh users Indian VDA users have switched from domestic centralised VDA exchanges to foreign counterparts since the announcement of the tax regime in the Union Budget in February 2022:The current tax structure on VDS in India have impacted trading volumes on local cryptocurrency exchanges.A research study by Esya Centre, a Delhi-based technology policy think tank, shows Indian crypto traders have moved over $3.8 billion in trading volume from local exchanges to international crypto platforms after the country\u2019s controversial tax policy came into effect last year.\u201cThis is likely to lead to a large negative impact on tax revenues, as well as a decrease in transaction traceability\u2014which defeats the two central goals of the extant policy architecture. The downside impact of the VDA tax architecture is likely to further accentuate capital outflow and deter international investors. This implies reduced competitiveness of Indian centralised VDA exchanges relative to international counterparts,\u201d the study added.The Esya Centre recommended three steps to stem the offshoring of domestic business and liquidity to foreign exchanges.It says tax deducted at-source (TDS) on VDAs should be at par with securities transaction tax. The government should reconcile tax rates vis-a-vis revenue maximisation by ascertaining the optimal taxation point(s) using economic analysis tools such as the Laffer Curve. And, India should adopt a progressive tax structure with differentiated rates for short-term and long-term gains, in line with international best-practices, it added.\"While this move will undoubtedly bring about greater consumer confidence in a regulated industry, aspects in relation to data security and privacy measures will require strengthening, with increased incidence of collection of user\u2019s sensitive data sets. While banking and financial institutions are required to adhere to sector specific data security norms released by RBI, crypto industry members are still largely regulated under SPDI norms, which will require a re-look,\" said Puhan."

        "content": "CryptoQuant\u2019s Bitcoin on-chain PnL index has surged above its 365-day MA recently, a crossover that has historically signaled early bull markets.\n\nBitcoin On-Chain PnL Index Has Formed A Bullish Crossover\n\nAs per data from the on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, the index is indicating a buy signal for BTC right now. The \u201cCryptoQuant on-chain PnL index\u201d is a metric that combines three different indicators into one to point out tops, bottoms, and cyclical shifts in the price of Bitcoin.\n\nThe first of the metrics that the PnL index uses is the \u201cMVRV ratio,\u201d which is a model that checks whether BTC is currently overvalued or undervalued by comparing the crypto\u2019s market cap with a fair value model called the \u201crealized cap.\u201d\n\nThe second relevant indicator here is the \u201cNUPL,\u201d which tells us whether the Bitcoin market as a whole is currently carrying an unrealized profit or an unrealized loss. This metric can provide hints about whether there is a buying or selling motive among investors right now.\n\nFinally, there is the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), which tracks whether the average holder is selling at a loss or a profit at the moment. The SOPR shouldn\u2019t be confused with the NUPL, as the quantity being measured by the NUPL is the \u201cunrealized\u201d profit/loss, which is the profit or loss that investors have accumulated but are yet to harvest (or \u201crealize\u201d) as they are still to sell their coins.\n\nThere are actually two SOPR metrics of interest here; the version specifically for the short-term holders (STHs) and that for the long-term holders (LTHs). The entire Bitcoin market can be divided into these two groups, with the criteria being that holders who bought within the last 155 days fall into the former cohort, while those who bought before that fall into the latter.\n\nNow, here is the data for the CryptoQuant on-chain PnL index, which takes all these different Bitcoin indicators and combines them into one model for the crypto:\n\nLooks like the value of the metric has shot up | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nAs displayed in the above graph, the CryptoQuant on-chain PnL index has sharply risen out of the historical bottom zone recently. The chart also includes the curve for the 365-day moving average (MA) of the metric, and it\u2019s clear that the index has crossed above this MA with the latest surge.\n\nHistorically, such a crossover during bearish periods has signaled a transition toward an early bull market. If this pattern holds true this time as well, then the current breakout could be good news for the ongoing rally.\n\nHowever, back in 2015, an initial breakout like the current one did end up failing, and it was only later that a successful transition took place. Nonetheless, CryptoQuant notes \u201calthough it is still possible for the index to fall back below, the CryptoQuant PnL Index has issued a definitive buy signal for BTC.\u201d\n\nBTC Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $22,900, up 11% in the last week.\n\nBTC seems to be showing stale price action | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Hans Eiskonen on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, CryptoQuant.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Bitcoin Poised To Resume Its Inclination To Outperform, Says Bloomberg Senior Analyst - NewsBTC",
        "content": "After the Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced a surprising turnaround in its monetary policy today, the Bitcoin price managed to rise near the important resistance level of $16,900. The BOJ announced that it will drastically widen its yield curve control band to 0.50%. At the same time, it announced that it will significantly increase the number of government bonds it will buy each month.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg senior commodities analyst Mike McGlone, this trend could continue. McGlone shared his insights via Twitter and said that a \u201cwarm spell\u201d is ahead for Bitcoin.\n\nAs the analyst notes, BTC has taken a beating as a risk asset in 2022 with most other cryptocurrencies, but \u201cappears poised to resume its inclination to outperform.\u201d This will happen when the U.S. Federal Reserve eases monetary policy and completes its pivot.\n\nBitcoin Is Set To Outperform When\u2026\n\nAccording to the chart from a Bloomberg Intelligence report, the levels that BTC and the Nasdaq 100 stock index have been resisting have now turned into support.\n\nAccording to the analysis, the BTC price soared in 2020 and 2021 due to unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus, allowing it to outperform the stock index. McGlone further elaborated:\n\nAt a Bitcoin/ Nasdaq ratio of 1.5x on Dec. 16, what\u2019s been consistent for most of the benchmark crypto\u2019s history is its declining relative risk vs. the stock index. At 2x, Bitcoin\u2019s annual volatility at the end of 2022 compares with 4x at the end of 2021.\n\nIn the coming year of 2023, McGlone expects that it will be a matter of how much lower global economies fall. Investors should by no means underestimate BTC then, as the risk/reward ratio is in favor of the leading cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cRisk vs. reward appears to argue against under-allocating or estimating the propensity for Bitcoin to continue its trajectory toward becoming digital collateral,\u201d McGlone claimed.\n\nIn other words, the Bloomberg analyst predicts that as soon as the U.S. Federal Reserve fires up its money printer again, cuts interest rates and returns to monetary easing, Bitcoin will \u201coutperform\u201d the rest of the market again.\n\nIn another tweet, McGlone predicted that the leading cryptocurrency will outperform the Tesla stock. \u201cThe near-certain decline in Bitcoin supply compared to the rising number of Tesla shares outstanding favors cryptocurrency outperformance when the rules of economics apply,\u201d McGlone said.\n\nBTC Price At Crucial Level\n\nMeanwhile, the BTC price needs to crack the extremely crucial $16,900 level in the short term and could then have a strong continuation. If so, investors should then keep an eye on the next vital resistance in the $17,350 area.\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash, Chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin price made a 5% move today, poking above $19,000 momentarily. It is currently the largest daily climb of 2023 and since the FTX collapse.\n\nMore significantly, the sharp rally tagged a level that triggered a possible trend change according to the weekly Parabolic SAR. In the past, the technical indicator has lived up to its name. What could it mean this time?\n\nBitcoin Makes Biggest Move Of 2023\n\nThe start of 2023 has been positive for altcoins. But up until today, Bitcoin has been mild by comparison.\n\nFollowing today\u2019s CPI data release coming in at 6.5% and Biden\u2019s victory lap on inflation, Bitcoin price soared by $1,000, taking the top cryptocurrency above $19,000 briefly.\n\nMore importantly than what happened today, was what occurred on the weekly timeframe. BTCUSDT (Binance) weekly tagged the Parabolic SAR for the first time since May 2022. The LUNA collapse pulled Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies lower, beginning the second, more aggressive phase of the recent downtrend.\n\nThe same Parabolic SAR signal was also triggered prior to the 2019 crypto rally, and the 2020 to 2021 bull run (pictured below). Both rallies also blossomed from the same exact trend line previously.\n\nThe Parabolic SAR has produced profitable results | BTCUSDT on TradingView.com\n\nBTCUSDT Weekly Triggers Parabolic SAR Buy Signal\n\nThe Parabolic SAR is a technical indicator designed by J. Wells Wilder, Jr. and is used to detect changes in trend direction. The tool consists of a visual overlay of SAR dots that hover above or below price action, determining the direction of the trend.\n\nWhen the SAR dots are tagged, it suggests that a trend might \u201cstop and reverse\u201d \u2014 which is precisely what SAR stands for. Therefore, it\u2019s especially effective in timing entire and exits. Because the SAR dots travel higher or lower alongside the trend, they can be used reliably to set trailing stop losses.\n\nOn weekly timeframes, BTCUSDT (Binance) touched the Parabolic SAR, essentially telling short traders to get out of the position. If bears had used the PSAR for trailing stop losses, they\u2019ve now been stopped out \u2014 purposely \u2014 in profit.\n\nWhile the signal isn\u2019t a guarantee of continued upside, considering that the possible signal of a trend change has appeared alongside the coincidental timing of a long-term trend line touch, the recovery from this level could be more sustainable than many are ready for.\n\nFollow @TonySpilotroBTC on Twitter or join the TonyTradesBTC Telegram for exclusive daily market insights and technical analysis education.

        "content": "The supply of bitcoin was strictly constrained In this article, let\u2019s examine the Bitcoin supply in 2023\n\nCompared to other cryptocurrency coins Bitcoin is a highly erratic currency. Nakamoto put a strict limit on the bitcoin supply while creating it. The rate at which the bitcoin supply is increasing along a pre-set path is decreasing. More than 21 million bitcoins will never be in circulation. As a result, one should not be concerned about unforeseen fluctuations in the bitcoin supply. The bitcoin supply is extremely predictable. Let\u2019s explore the Bitcoin supply in 2023. As of writing on March 9, 2023, there are 19.31 million bitcoins in circulation. One block of bitcoin transactions is verified by miners every ten minutes. 6.25 bitcoins are now awarded for validating a single bitcoin block. Thus, every day, about 900 bitcoins are issued into circulation.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s supply is limited. As a result, trading with another person will be the only option to obtain Bitcoin once the supply is reached. There can only ever be 21 million Bitcoins in circulation.\n\nExperts predict that the total amount of Bitcoins issued will almost certainly never surpass this limit. It is so because the Bitcoin code base contains rounding operations. To impose a Bitcoin cap restriction, block rewards are frequently divided over time. There won\u2019t be any more Bitcoin cryptocurrency created after the final 21 million have been mined. So, the only sources of income for Bitcoin miners will be the sale of their coins and transaction fees.\n\nAlthough there are theoretically 21 million bitcoins available, 4 million of them have been irretrievably lost. Bitcoins can be misplaced if the owner misplaces the private key to a paper wallet or other cold storage wallet if the private key is lost, if the wallet is misplaced, or if the owner\u2019s wallet or hard drive is lost. Without a private key, it is impossible to use or trade bitcoins because it is necessary to send them from one wallet to another. As owners were less vigilant when the coins were just worth pennies, many bitcoins were lost in the early years of the cryptocurrency. As they are not maintained on an exchange, which may be exposed to security threats, and are kept offline, cold storage wallets are the most secure way to hold bitcoins.\n\nA sizeable fraction of the available bitcoins are owned by several investors who entered the Bitcoin market early. Whales are investors who own enough bitcoin to influence the market when they buy or sell. 5 million bitcoins, or around 28% of the entire supply, are now held by about 1,600 companies. From Bitcoin\u2019s birth, Satoshi Nakamoto, the alleged creator (or group of founders), has kept 1 million bitcoins in their wallet without ever moving a single one. Even though some whales do sell and spend their bitcoins, most of them choose to keep with them, effectively removing them from the market.\n\nNo new bitcoins will be created after the maximum number of bitcoins has been achieved, even if that number ultimately falls slightly below 21 million. Bitcoin miners will still be compensated, but probably simply with transaction processing fees, for continuing to pool and process bitcoin transactions into blocks.\n\nBitcoin miners will undoubtedly be impacted when Bitcoin reaches its upper supply limit, but how much will depend on how Bitcoin develops as a cryptocurrency. Bitcoin miners might still be able to make money solely from transaction processing fees in 2140 if the Bitcoin blockchain handles a large volume of transactions.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "On-chain data shows the number of stablecoin transactions going into spot exchanges have risen recently, something that could help fuel a Christmas Bitcoin rally.\n\nStablecoin Deposits To Spot Exchanges Have Shown Increasing Demand Recently\n\nAs pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, there has been an increasing demand on spot exchanges recently. The relevant indicator here is the \u201cstablecoin exchange depositing transactions,\u201d which measures the total number of transfers involving these fiat-tied tokens that are heading towards exchanges.\n\nInvestors usually use stablecoins whenever they want to escape the volatility associated with coins like Bitcoin. Once the holders feel the prices are right to re-enter into these volatile markets, they transfer their accumulated stables to exchanges for swapping them into their desired cryptocurrency. So, a large amount of these tokens entering into exchanges can act as buying pressure for other markets, and thus provide a bullish effect to the prices of Bitcoin and other assets.\n\nUnlike the normal inflow metric, which simply measures the total amount flowing into exchanges, this indicator paints an idea about the actual demand in the market since it counts individual transfers, which can\u2019t be inflated by a few large investors as their transaction count will be much lesser than their inflow values.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in this metric, as well as the opposite one that keeps track of withdrawal transactions:\n\nThe value of the metric seems to have increased in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nAs the above graph shows, the stablecoin exchange depositing transactions metric has observed some growth recently, and at the same time, the withdrawing transactions have gone down instead. This means that there is demand to buy with stables right now, while there isn\u2019t much interest in exiting from volatile markets using these fiat-tied tokens.\n\nSuch a situation has proved to be bullish for the price of Bitcoin in the last few months, as the previous instances of this trend in the chart display. \u201cWith the number of stablecoin deposits up-trending & the number of stablecoin withdraws down-trending, the capitulation events could be reaching an end,\u201d notes the quant.\n\nThe analyst believes these inflows can fuel a new rally, saying \u201csuch pick up in retail investor sentiment could potentially lead to a Christmas rally.\u201d It now remains to be seen whether these stablecoin inflows will turn out to be constructive for the price this time or not.\n\nLooks like BTC has observed a decline in the last few days | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin\u2019s price is floating around $16,900, down 1% in the last week.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Recently, Senegal hosted a Bitcoin conference tagged \u201cDarker Bitcoin Days\u201d, initiated by Bourou, to highlight the surging interest in knowing more about Bitcoin in Senegal.\n\nRead Also: Crypto layoffs decreased by 80% in February; is the FTX contagion over?\n\nIn the last few years, residents of Senegal have grown fond of transferring money via mobile phones rather than banks as the nation seeks to bank the unbanked. Cointelegraph discovered Wave, a mobile money provider in business since 2017.\n\nRead Also: Visa and Mastercard to delay crypto partnerships amidst uncertainties\n\nWave has a similar operation mode to Bitcoin. The mobile money provider seeks to bank the unbanked and improve financial conditions for financially underserved populations. With Wave, users can scan a QR code or send money to a number; this is similar to sending money over Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network. But there is a transaction fee between 1% and 3%.\n\nTransactions take only a few minutes to go through. Although recognized as a helpful platform, its weakness is that it is expensive for microtransactions.\n\nBitcoin.\n\nTo test the efficiency of Bitcoin as an adequate alternative, the Cointelegraph reporter transfers bitcoin over the Lightning Network to a manager at Wave, who is interested and equally animated by the speed of the Lightning Network.\n\nScores of Senegalese showed interest in receiving, buying, and learning to keep bitcoin. Besides enjoying a fast, easy, and cost-friendly mode of transaction, the monetary chains of its colonial past could spur the faster adoption of Bitcoin in Senegal.\n\nSenegal explores other alternatives for CFA\n\nIn Africa, almost 150 million people use the Franc of the Financial Community of Africa (CFA) for their daily transactions, from Senegal in the extreme west to Gabon in the centre of the continent.\n\nThe CFA franc is used in 14 countries. Its value corresponds with the Euro. Printed in France, its monetary policy is regulated by Western powers. As Fod\u00e9 Diop, a Bitcoin Lightning developer from Senegal, details, \u201cThe IMF and the French government still control the currency.\u201d\n\nRead Also: Want to invest in March? Here are 3 cryptocurrencies to consider\n\nIn 1994, a devastating experience eroded the Senegalese society when the value of the local currency, the CFA, was slashed in half through the merged efforts of France, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. As a result, the fiat savings of Senegalese were decimated. This incident has produced a lack of doubt in the CFA among Senegalese.\n\nRead Also: Notorious crypto scammer Monkey Drainer retires\n\nGloire, the founder of Kiveclair, a Bitcoin Beach-inspired refugee project in the Congo, told Cointelegraph that the CFA \u201cmakes whole countries dependent\u201d and \u201cit is usually the poorest who suffer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most striking example is that of 1994, when France and a privileged few decided to devalue the CFA Franc. There is no guarantee that such a thing will not happen again, especially since the global economy is threatened.\n\nThis is why Senegal is exploring other viable alternatives to replace the CFA."

        "title": "Bitcoin vs Ethereum: How Is Ethereum Different From Bitcoin - ClearTax",
        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum are the Xbox and Playstation of the cryptocurrency world. They are two of the most popular cryptocurrencies whose contribution to the sector's growth has been enormous. From price to the premise, their concepts are unique but with a few things in common.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nUsers under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto first created the concept of Bitcoin in 2008. Bitcoin allows users to manage a currency not controlled by any financial institution or government.\n\nA set of decentralised networks runs the Bitcoin blockchain software with its own rules to which every participant must agree. These rules determine how every transaction works. It was the first cryptocurrency based on DLT (Decentralized Ledger Technology) blockchain.\n\nThe Bitcoin network processes multiple data sets and converts them into hashes through an algorithm called the SHA-256 hash function. It processes data and converts them into long strings of numbers.\n\nBitcoin's mining and consensus mechanism ensures that users cannot spend their funds twice, enabling it to stand out as a tamper-proof currency. Moreover, Bitcoin also features a store of value, which users can stock as an asset and use over time. Bitcoin's hassle-free mode of transactions has increased its popularity over time.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nThe Ethereum network was launched in July 2015, and its co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, published its white paper in 2013. Ethereum uses its blockchain to create a decentralised computer, like interacting with applications and making transactions based on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe main goal of Ethereum was to decentralise everything on the internet. This cryptocurrency operates on its programming language and solidity and is surging daily on the ladders of innovation. For instance, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and decentralised financial service applications are examples of what developers can create using Ethereum-based smart contracts.\n\nUsers must pay a fee for creating smart contracts, paying for transactions, and using decentralised apps in Ether. Today, as this ambitious cryptocurrency's value is increasing, it is also being used to store value.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum: Overview\n\nQuite often, these two biggies of the crypto world are compared against each other. However, you should know that Bitcoin and Ethereum are merely systems, whilst the cryptocurrencies these two systems use are called bitcoin (small letter b) and Ether. Their respective stock symbols are:\n\nbitcoin: BTC\n\nEther: ETH\n\nMain takeaways: Bitcoin v/s Ethereum\n\nParticulars Bitcoin Ethereum Currency v/s platform A feasible alternative to traditional currency. Acts as a medium of exchange and store of value. A platform that runs programmatic applications and contracts via Ether. Launch date January 2009 July 2015 Price** \u00a323,756 \u00a31,575 Market cap** \u00a3478 bn \u00a3191 bn Consensus mechanism Proof of work Proof of stake Block time 10 minutes 12 to 14 seconds Max supply 21 million Unlimited\n\n**Please note that the abovementioned data is current as of 27th May 2022 and is subject to change over time.\n\nSpeaking of how similar these two systems are, both use blockchain technology to record and validate all their transactions. However, Ethereum's upcoming change plans differ concerning accessibility, sustainability, and speed.\n\nBefore discussing their major difference in the consensus mechanism, let's understand what a consensus mechanism is.\n\nConsensus Mechanism\n\nA consensus mechanism refers to a computer algorithm which mainly aims at solving the problem of 'double spending' by making any blockchain viable. BTC is a string of codes that can be infinitely copied. In other words, you can become as wealthy as you want to be by simply making multiple copies of your BTC.\n\nHowever, the reality is very different. Every time you spend a bitcoin, its copy gets destroyed, and the recipient on the other side of the transaction receives a new version. A record of all details of transactions is maintained on a distributed ledger, where the world can see that you have spent your BTC.\n\nThe ledger holders' consensus would clearly indicate the fake one if you attempt to spend a copied version. Counterfeiting even one such transaction would be difficult, and then you have to modify each transaction since all of them are correlated.\n\nTo work around this, you either have to control at least 51% of that network's mining hash rate or have massive computing power. Therefore, an attack as such on Bitcoin or Ethereum is probable but still hypothetical. From the very beginning, Bitcoin and Ethereum used distinct consensus mechanisms. Bitcoin uses 'proof of work' while Ethereum aims at using a 'proof of stake' consensus mechanism.\n\nBitcoin: Proof of Work\n\nProof of work (PoW) is the decentralised consensus mechanism, where network members put feasible amounts of effort to deter anyone from gaming the system. It is mainly used in cryptocurrency mining for mining new tokens and validating transactions.\n\nProof of Work: Understanding\n\n'Work' involves estimating a unique 64 characters string that is alphanumeric as accurately as possible. Within a 10-minute window, anyone making the maximum number of guesses per second has the highest chance of being chosen as a validator.\n\nProof of Work: Criticism\n\nEarlier, hobbyists sitting at home used to do this 'work'. However, the processing power required to get it done has increased exponentially. As a result, only those able to afford the necessary power and hardware can get this work done today, like companies and specialist mining organisations.\n\nThe energy required for computer hardware is enormous and is the sole reason behind Bitcoin's criticism. Currently, it uses 19 terawatt hours (TWh) every year, nearly the amount used by an entire country like Norway.\n\nEthereum: Proof of Stake\n\nThis consensus mechanism initiates processing transactions and helps create new blocks in the blockchain based on the total number of validator stakes coins. The PoS structure has less potential for a network attack thanks to its well-designed structure.\n\nUnder Proof of Stake, the next block writer is selected randomly, with nodes having larger stake positions being assigned with higher odds.\n\nProof of Stake: Understanding\n\nUnder proof of stake (PoS), owners themself offer coins as collateral and are given a chance to validate blocks. As a result, coin owners with 'stake coins' are eligible to become 'validators'; however, they should own a specific amount of stake coins. Next, a random validator is selected who gets to do the 'mining' unlike the competition-based mechanism as in the proof of work.\n\nProof of Work v/s Proof of Stake: Main Takeaways"

        "content": "Home \u00bb Bitcoin Best time of day to buy bitcoin? Is That Even A Thing? BitcoinJournal Best time of day to buy bitcoin? Is That Even A Thing? Felix K\u00fcster\n\nSomeone told you there is one specific time of day when you should buy bitcoin, and it triggered your interest, but you are not sure if that is even a thing? Read on, and we will explain what the theory behind such claims is.\n\nBitcoin and any cryptocurrency, in general, are known to be very volatile. That has its pros and cons. It has seen some people become millionaires while others burn down to the ground. You may be wondering: What\u2019s the secret? Well, it\u2019s not a secret anymore. The trick is to know the right time to buy Bitcoin.\n\nBest Day To Buy Crypto \u2013 TL;DR Buying Bitcoin on Sundays and Mondays could be advantageous as the crypto price of Bitcoin is usually at its lowest on those days due to lower trading volumes over the weekend.\n\nResearch suggests that Bitcoin is most volatile at around 1 am UTC, likely because Western and Asian traders are actively trading simultaneously at that time.\n\nThe best time to buy crypto is when the buyer is feeling confident in their strategy and financially ready to make a move, according to experts.\n\nCryptocurrencies are most active during the workweek, with prices starting low on Monday morning and steadily rising until they drop over the weekend.\n\nPaying attention to stock market trading hours can also have an effect on cryptocurrency trading, even though you can buy and sell cryptocurrencies 24/7.\n\nIt is important to be aware of your risk tolerance by forecasting your cash flow and watching cryptocurrency market trends before making a purchase.\n\nUsing dollar-cost averaging, or buying a little bit at a time over an extended period, is a useful strategy to control the volatility of your investment.\n\nMultiple analysts have suggested that Monday is the best day to buy cryptocurrencies, as Bitcoin\u2019s price is consistently lower on Sundays and Mondays based on daily averages over week-long periods.\n\nTiming a cryptocurrency buy is never cut and dried as the market is traded 24 hours a day by investors around the world, so using dollar-cost averaging can help to even out any volatility.\n\nLet\u2019s face it; most people do not have all the knowledge required to deal with Bitcoin. Many Bitcoin active traders are self-taught, and this eventually works as long as the need is met. Several economists have researched the best time to buy Bitcoin is providing their observations based on several factors and analyses.\n\nFirst, they took note that the factors determining price swings in cryptocurrency are very different from those that affect traditional assets. Bitcoin prices rise rapidly and fall just as fast. It is therefore advisable to only invest in Bitcoin when its value increases by 20% in the previous week.\n\nBefore we tackle the best time of the day, let\u2019s begin by, first of all, deciphering what day is best if one is planning on buying Bitcoin.\n\nThe best day of the week to buy Bitcoin\n\nIt is crucial to take into account that, unlike traditional stock markets, the cryptocurrency market is open 24/7. You can buy Bitcoin at any time of the day from anywhere as long as you have an internet connection.\n\nAccording to an analysis carried out, the best days to buy Bitcoin are Sundays and Mondays, for the sole reason that on these days, the crypto price of Bitcoin is at its lowest.\n\nThe reason to explain why Sunday evenings are the best time to buy BTC is that trading volumes on every crypto exchange usually drop during the weekend. US derivatives giant CME Group, which also contributes significantly to bitcoin\u2019s global volume (over $500 million daily) traded by institutional investors, go on a break during the weekend.\n\nTheories behind the specific days\n\nMultiple theories explain how to determine the best timing to buy Bitcoin. We are going to look into three.\n\nThe first theory suggests that the demand for Bitcoin slows down during the weekends pushing its price to lower on Monday and higher on Fridays .\n\nsuggests that the demand for slows down during the weekends pushing . A second theory suggests that most people tend to buy Bitcoin during the weekends and begin trading during the week, meaning that the trading volume is high on Mondays .\n\nsuggests that most people tend to buy during the weekends and . A third theory suggests that it is best to avoid buying Bitcoin during periods when 9-5 workers get paid. The more the money, the more the demand for Bitcoin.\n\nBest time of day to buy Bitcoin\n\nWe have narrowed it down to the best days to buy Bitcoin and even further looked into several theories that can help you better ascertain your decision. Now let\u2019s take a deep dive and take a look at the best time of the day to buy Bitcoin.\n\nTake note of the fact that the BTC is highly volatile, and its price changes within a short period. Searching for the best time to buy Bitcoin, however, depicts a focus on the short-term focus on the price of the Bitcoin, which is not advised.\n\nThe best thing you can do is to adopt the following practices that are sure to keep the risk of losing all your money at bay.\n\n\u2705 Educate yourself\n\nDo not begin trading in cryptocurrency if you do not know anything about it. Cryptocurrency is not a platform to chase quick profits. There are numerous risks involved with it.\n\nGet on the internet and research. You can get material from the Nakamoto institute and even get a lot of information on Youtube. It may be time-consuming, but that is the right way to go about it\n\n\u2705 Don\u2019t panic sell\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking. What if the Bitcoin market price is high? Isn\u2019t it advisable to sell and gain profit? Yes, it is good to do so if you plan to sell when BTC reaches a certain price height. However, if you got into panic mode by reading or listening to stuff online and think you need to sell before it all crashes \u2013 then, NO \u2013 don\u2019t do that.\n\nTake note of the fact that holding Bitcoin long-term is the best strategy. Bitcoin is in the process of slowly monetizing. Wouldn\u2019t it be useless to sell and accumulate fiat money which would eventually prove to be worthless?\n\n\u2705 Buy on the dip\n\nCryptocurrency being highly volatile, it comes without question that at some point, the market price of Bitcoin will fall. The best time to invest in Bitcoin is at this time. If you are new to cryptocurrency, this may sound counterintuitive to you. However, take note of the fact that Bitcoin is very volatile. Prices could go down right now and appreciate within the next hour.\n\n\u2705 Understand current markets and trends\n\nIt is advised to make sure that you know how to study market trends and decide the best time to invest in cryptocurrency. You should be able to make decisions based on market trends and not based on what every trader is doing.\n\nRead also:\n\nHow to keep track of Bitcoin prices\n\nHaving concluded that there is not exactly the best time to buy cryptocurrency due to its volatility, let us look into a concept that will prove to be even more useful.\n\nKeeping track of Bitcoin prices will notify you when its price has gone down for you to buy it is essential. You can keep track of Bitcoin prices using several apps, including Binance, TradingView, Plus500, Coinbase, Delta App, and Blockfolio, to name a few.\n\nYou can set alerts on whichever application you get so you will be notified when the Bitcoin either goes up or down.\n\nAt what time of the day is Bitcoin most volatile?\n\nWe have concluded that due to volatility, it gets challenging to decide on the best time of the day to buy Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, knowing the hour of the day when Bitcoin is most volatile can prove to be very vital. Research and analysis of the crypto market trends have shown that Bitcoin is most volatile at around 1 am UTC. That could be because this hour is the beginning of the evening in North America. In contrast, it is the beginning of the workday in Asia. At this time of the day, Western traders and Asian traders are most likely to be actively trading simultaneously.\n\nSo, the best time of day to buy cryptocurrency is around 1 AM UTC.\n\nBybit \u2013 best place to buy crypto Visit Now Anonymous trading: Bybit is a fully anonymous exchange, with no KYC verification required.\n\nImpressive trading tools: Bybit offers top-notch security, no downtime commitment, and charting tools with advanced functionality and extra features.\n\nHigh leverage: Bybit offers high leverage of up to 100x on Bitcoin and up to 50x on other currencies.\n\nPerpetual swaps: Bybit specializes in perpetual swaps, a unique form of futures contract called an \u201cinverse futures contract.\u201d\n\nIn conclusion \u2013 Best day of the week to buy crypto\n\nIs there a thing as the best time of day to buy cryptocurrency? From all the theories, research and analysis, it is clear that there is no such thing as a perfect market when it comes to cryptocurrency. Unlike other traditional assets, cryptocurrency is very volatile. You could make some quick only today and lose it all tomorrow. That is not a matter of sheer luck. It\u2019s about doing as much research as possible and making sure that as a crypto investor you are investing what you can afford to lose."
