        "title": "SEC's Gensler Warns Crypto Investors, but Differentiates Bitcoin - Nasdaq",
        "content": "By Landon Manning\n\nGary Gensler, the head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has recently made some comments on the legal status of Bitcoin that investors should note.\n\nGensler, who has spent much of his career with investment banks and government positions, has commented on the legal status of bitcoin in his role as the SEC chair several times since 2021. The SEC is designed to ensure a safe regulatory environment for investors and to protect consumers from illegal activity, making its positions important to any crypto investor.\n\nOn February 27, Gensler made comments in an interview about the state of the wider crypto industry. Specifically, he claimed that \u201ceverything but bitcoin\u201d could be considered a security in the world of cryptocurrency, while bitcoin could be considered a commodity due to its stature and resolutely-decentralized nature. The difference between securities and commodities is often determined by the Howey Test, based on a Supreme Court case from 1946, which dictates that the difference between the two is determined by the expectation that investors will profit as well as the status of the party offering a sale. Securities must follow a far more stringent series of restrictions than commodities do, so Gensler\u2019s determination of bitcoin\u2019s status could have major investment implications.\n\nIn what Time called a \u201cfederal offensive\u201d against the cryptocurrency industry, it noted that Gensler\u2019s SEC has been shutting down a variety of crypto businesses and leading other institutions like the Federal Reserve to decry the risks of crypto and stablecoins. Gensler has personally questioned exchanges\u2019 ability to custody funds, saying that, \u201cJust because a crypto trading platform claims to be a qualified custodian doesn\u2019t mean that it is.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that these are only his personal views and not in themselves a binding opinion of the federal government\u2019s, but nevertheless, they have been provocative enough for Ripple to call on Gensler to recuse himself in an ongoing legal battle between itself and the SEC.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s design renders it immune from many criticisms of the broader industry and Gensler has claimed unequivocally that bitcoin should be held to different standards. Any arguments against a particular exchange or altcoin project will not apply to the first-ever cryptocurrency. However, even if bitcoin itself will not be attacked, a frostier environment for the wider world of crypto could have negative effects. An important goal for Bitcoiners is widespread adoption, which could be more difficult if exchanges dealing in bitcoin go under. The same effects could hold for a crackdown on miners and lenders, even if Bitcoin exists worldwide.\n\nAs a result, investors need to be cautious about these developments and their potential impacts on the world of cryptocurrency, and also recognize the variety of reasons that betting on bitcoin remains the best and safest option for many. Even with a variety of hostile attacks to the ecosystem as a whole, one can never forget that Bitcoin is the first trailblazer, with years of experience in flourishing under hostile regulators. Any number of cryptocurrency projects could become more dicey propositions if the federal government takes up a firm offense, but Bitcoin has demonstrated time and again that it is capable of coming out of these periods stronger than ever before.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "The hopeful optimism of Bitcoin (BTC) traders seemed to dissipate in the first week of March as key on-chain metrics provided resistance.\n\nNow Bitcoin is threatening a retest of the $22,000 level, and a wave of short sellers would stand to profit if that occurred. If the short sellers\u2019 strike price hits, some analysts believe Bitcoin could drop as low as $19,000.\n\nBitcoin options by strike price. Source: Coinglass\n\nA handful of analysts still project BTC to hit $25,000 in the short-term, on-chain data highlighting a few reasons for price resistance at higher levels.\n\nRealized price metric highlights profit-taking\n\nMarket participants\u2019 concern over the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hikes and high inflation are heavy macro headwinds facing Bitcoin and this has investors weighing the time value of money (TVM) of BTC investments. To measure TVM on-chain, Bitcoin holders can be put into groups based on the amount of time they held BTC and average the acquisition cost.\n\nInvestors that purchased BTC within the last six months benefited from the early bear market conditions and have an average realized price of $21,000, which places them in profit. The average market realized price across all BTC holders is $19,800, also currently in profit.\n\nConversely, BTC held for over six months has a higher realized price than the rest of the market groups at $23,500. When Bitcoin reaches above $23,500, the holders that have seen little TVM return for over six months potentially put pressure on a breakout as they get antsy to lock in profits.\n\nBitcoin supply cost basis by time held. Source: Glassnode\n\nLiquidity inflows increase but pale in comparision to 2022\n\nBitcoin price is highly reactive to interest rates and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which puts a strain on risk assets. The negative impact of these factors is great for short sellers but bad for Bitcoin. The best way for Bitcoin to withstand short-seller pressure is for new long liquidity and spot buyers to enter the market.\n\nAnalyzing exchange net flows is a good way to measure new liquidity and currently this metric reflects a 34% uptick since the start of 2023, but it lags behind the yearly daily average of $1.6 billion.\n\nBitcoin exchange volume. Source: Glassnode\n\nCurrently, the general consensus among analysts is that the ability to onboard new liquidity into the crypto market has been hindered by a crackdown on banks that support crypto-oriented businesses.\n\nThe uptick in unrealized Bitcoin profits mirrors previous cycles\n\nWhile some Bitcoin investors were realizing profit, positive on-chain signals appear when looking at the Net Unrealized Profit / Loss metric (NUPL). The NUPL metric shows the difference between unrealized Bitcoin profit and unrealized loss within the BTC supply.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, NUPL metrics on March 6 show:\n\n\u201cSince mid-January, the weekly average of NUPL has shifted from a state of net unrealized loss to a positive condition. This indicates that the average Bitcoin holder is now holding a net unrealized profit of magnitude of approximately 15% of the market cap. This pattern resembles a market structure equivalent to transition phases in previous bear markets.\u201d\n\nBitcoin NUPL. Source: Glassnode\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s 2023 momentum may have paused in mid-February and many headwinds remain, there are positive signs that the transition out of the deepest phase of thbear market is near.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today\n\nAn ominous-sounding technical pattern has appeared on bitcoin's (BTC) weekly price chart for the first time on record. Analysts, however, are split on what it means for cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin's 50-week simple moving average has crossed under its 200-week SMA, confirming a \"death cross,\" a bearish indicator suggesting the short-term price pullback could become a more sustained downtrend.\n\nEven though the moving average-based death cross represents what happened in the past, many consider it a forward-looking indicator.\n\n\"The death cross formed on the weekly time frame makes for a cautious view of the near-term outlook and keeps the potential for a return to the $18,000-$16,300,\" Alex Kuptsikevich, a market analyst at FxPro, said in an email.\n\nOne could argue that the death cross has come at the right time for bears, considering the crisis at crypto-friendly Silvergate Bank and surging interest rate expectations across the advanced world.\n\nBitcoin fell nearly 5% last week as Silvergate said it was evaluating its ability to survive as a going concern. The leading cryptocurrency ran into offers around the 50-week SMA for the second straight week.\n\n\"Technically, the 50-week moving average continues to act as a valid resistance from which the selling intensifies,\" Kuptsikevich said.\n\nSome observers, however, don't see the death cross as a reliable indicator, because it is based on backward-looking moving averages and lags prices and has proved to be a contrary indicator in stock markets.\n\n\"A death cross is a nonevent. A weekly death cross means the 50-week average dropped below the 200-week average. They are *lagging* indicators that definitionally occur after a rapid decline,\" Timothy Peterson, investment manager at Cane Island Alternative Investments, tweeted last month.\n\nAccording to Peterson, the death cross has been unreliable as a standalone indicator in traditional markets.\n\n\"For the S&P 500 going back nearly 100 years, there have been 9 such occurrences: 1938, 48, 58, 63 , 70, 74, 78, 2001, '08.,\" Peterson said. \"Within 50 days, the average gain was 22% and the average loss was -9%. Within 200 days, the average gain was 46% and the average loss was -11%. Those are great risk/return odds.\""

        "title": "Ordinals: A New Innovation Powering Bitcoin NFTs and Maybe More - Chainalysis Blog",
        "content": "Since its introduction in Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s renowned 2008 white paper, Bitcoin (BTC) has challenged traditional monetary systems, introduced trustless networks, and inspired innovation in the digital ecosystem. Despite Bitcoin\u2019s diverse use cases, it is primarily viewed as either \u201cdigital gold\u201d for inflation mitigation or a currency alternative that lets participants transact in a decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) environment. It typically has not been viewed as the blockchain on which you can build.\n\nBut now, with the launch of the Ordinals protocol, developers are able to innovate on top of the Bitcoin blockchain by creating inscriptions on individual units of Bitcoin, which can function similarly to the NFTs (non-fungible tokens) found on blockchains like Ethereum (ETH). This opens a realm of possibilities. A new value proposition on the oldest and most secure blockchain provides new functionality for the network, and is likely to attract innovators.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll explore the launch of the Ordinals protocol, how Ordinals work, how they differ from traditional NFTs, and statistics about Ordinals transactions.\n\nOrdinals\u2019 origins\n\nDevelopers have been working on enhancements to the Bitcoin network for nearly a decade, focusing on additional exchange features and financial instruments. Years before the term NFT became mainstream, cryptographer Meni Rosenfeld released a white paper in 2012, detailing the concept of Colored Coins \u2013 segregated Bitcoins that would be colored according to their unique purpose. In 2014, Layer 2 protocol Counterparty enabled the minting and trading of digital collectibles on Bitcoin. Similarly, the Stacks network was launched in 2017 to facilitate Bitcoin smart contract deployment for more efficient transactions. Regardless, many such protocols lost popularity and developers turned to the Ethereum network to work on Layer 2 tokens and decentralized applications (Dapps).\n\nBut that changed this year. On January 21, 2023, developer Casey Rodarmor launched Ordinals to provide added functionality to the Bitcoin blockchain and \u201cMAKE BITCOIN FUN AGAIN.\u201d Ordinals is a Layer 1 protocol that introduces transformative blockchain technology to inscribe content and new functionalities onto Bitcoin itself. The idea for Ordinals came about during the Bitcoin Taproot upgrade in November 2021, which was also the catalyst for Taro, a Layer 2 protocol that facilitates asset issuance on Bitcoin, transferred over the Lightning Network. Since then, Ordinals have sparked discussions about network scalability and Layer 2 potential.\n\nHow do Bitcoin Ordinals work?\n\nInspired by the mathematical concept of ordinal numbers, Ordinals are chronologically inscribed on a satoshi, the smallest unit of a Bitcoin. Ordinals begin at zero and are serially numbered depending on the order in which they are mined \u2013 similar to serial numbers on U.S. dollar bills. Ordinals can contain image, video, and text files; these files are included on the transaction \u201cwitness,\u201d which authorizes trades through signatures and other important identifying data.\n\nDue to the lack of supportive Web3 infrastructure on Bitcoin, the Ordinals protocol did not originally have its own wallet interface for transactions. As of March 2023, supported wallets now include Ordinals Wallet, XVerse, and Hiro Wallet. In order to mint using Ordinals, Bitcoin participants must download Bitcoin Core and sync it to the nodes of the blockchain. Then, they can create a profile using a supported wallet and send satoshis to it.\n\nHow do Ordinals differ from NFTs on Ethereum and other blockchains?\n\nMinting Ordinals is similar to minting NFTs, but there are key differences that make the former simpler and arguably more secure. Whereas NFT files are stored off-chain, accessed by a link on the blockchain, and can be altered by smart contract developers, the data for Ordinals inscriptions are stored directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. By keeping minting completely on-chain, Ordinals are permanent and immutable. Additionally, NFTs usually have royalties attached to them; Ordinals do not. These characteristics are why Rodarmor refers to inscriptions as \u201cdigital artifacts\u201d and not \u201cBitcoin NFTs.\u201d\n\nOrdinals transaction data\n\nWithin the last year, interest in the NFT markets has waned. As the below chart demonstrates, total weekly value received by NFT platforms on Ethereum grew at the beginning of 2022, peaking on April 25 at over $1.7 billion.\n\nValue further slumped at the end of 2022, likely due to the FTX collapse and onset of \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d While the Ethereum blockchain NFT marketplace remains robust, with value stabilizing in January and February of 2023, activity is well off its all-time highs.\n\nOn the contrary, Ordinals have experienced a recent increase in activity. According to Dune, Ordinals inscribed with image and text files have experienced the highest volume levels. On March 1, 2023 \u2013 the day with the highest minting volume \u2013 the files varied, with 15,981 text files, 8,817 image files, 23 applications, two audio files, one model, and one video. Although Dune identifies that fees spent to inscribe Ordinals have declined since mid-February, cumulative fees are approximately $1.5 million.\n\nSource: Ordinals.\n\nDune lists the total number of Ordinals inscriptions to date as more than 320,000. Some of the most notable Ordinals thus far include Ordinal Punks \u2013 a tribute to CryptoPunks \u2013 and Taproot Wizards. Given that Ordinals are a fairly new protocol, it is likely that most cryptocurrency ecosystem participants don\u2019t yet know how to create or trade them. Once Ordinals become more mainstream, inscriptions are likely to increase faster.\n\nOrdinals may also help reignite interest in NFTs and other related digital tokens. For example, Bitcoin experienced a recent increase in volume and reached its highest level since August of 2022. Although difficult to determine, it is likely that the launch of Ordinals was a contributing catalyst for this movement. The Stacks token (STX) also recently increased in price, over 160% \u2013 possibly sparked by Ordinals rejuvenating interest in Bitcoin smart contract development.\n\nThe future of Ordinals\n\nThe Ordinals protocol has already opened doors to a substantial, untapped market in the form of Bitcoin NFTs. Ordinals present other interesting potential use cases as well. For example, miners interested in ESG initiatives could use Ordinals to inscribe ESG compliance on the satoshis they mine. Ordinals may also be useful for tracking stolen coins based on serial numbers instead of order flow.\n\nOf course, those potential use cases, and even the currently popular NFT use cases, raise concerns about Bitcoin fungibility. Any Bitcoin is meant to be interchangeable with any other Bitcoin \u2013 Ordinals ascribing enhanced or decreased value to individual units of Bitcoin could mean that prices no longer reflect that fungibility. For that reason, many Bitcoin enthusiasts have expressed discontent with the launch of Ordinals, stating that it conflicts with Satoshi\u2019s original vision for the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency. Others have also raised concerns about the increased strain Ordinals put on the Bitcoin network by allowing files to be embedded in satoshis. Nonetheless, for the time being, Ordinals appear to be spurring increased interest in the Bitcoin blockchain, and are a bright spot in the current bear market.\n\nThis material is for informational purposes only, and is not intended to provide legal, tax, financial, or investment advice.

Should BTC go higher and rally to $300,000, Vays believes that can happen in late 2025 or early 2026.\n\nIn the short term, however, Vays thinks that the Bitcoin pullback is not yet over.\n\n\u201cThe [previous] week closed poorly, which at the moment sets us up for a pullback all the way down to the long-term moving average and $20,000.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $22,490.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "What Do New NFTs Mean for Bitcoin's Future Valuation? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "New non-fungible tokens (NFTs) from Bitcoin known as Ordinals continue to generate a tremendous amount of buzz, hype, and speculation. But what impact will they actually have on the valuation of Bitcoin (BTC 1.58%)?\n\nFrom one perspective, Ordinals could be the key to unlocking new value on the Bitcoin blockchain. From another perspective, though, Ordinals could be a major distraction from the core purpose of Bitcoin, which is to become a new form of digital money. In a worst-case scenario, Ordinals might make Bitcoin less attractive for institutional investors and invite unwelcome regulatory oversight.\n\nThe Ordinals phenomenon\n\nWhile Ordinals are not NFTs in the traditional sense, they enable creators to \"inscribe\" content directly into individual blocks of the Bitcoin blockchain. The maximum size for an Ordinal is just 4 MB, but that is still enough space in order to squeeze a tiny game, photo, or image into a Bitcoin block. Previously, these Bitcoin blocks only held financial transaction data, but now some of them will include Ordinal data as well.\n\nTo date, more than 260,000 of these Ordinals have been created, and they have transformed from an interesting conversation piece into a real phenomenon. A single Ordinal (Ordinal Punk 94), for example, recently sold for $214,000. By way of comparison, that's more than the current price of a CryptoPunk NFT on the Ethereum (ETH -1.28%) blockchain.\n\nIn short, there's potentially real money to be made here, and that is going to incentivize even more entrepreneurs and innovators to develop the market for Bitcoin NFTs. By some estimates, the total value of the NFT market is now worth close to $20 billion annually, with Ethereum currently dominating the lion's share of that figure.\n\nEven if Bitcoin only gains a 10% market share of the overall NFT market, that could get investors excited about the future growth prospects of Bitcoin. After all, some forecasts now call for the NFT market to explode in value, to nearly $200 billion, by the year 2030.\n\nBitcoin meets the Bored Apes\n\nMy concern, however, is that the market for Ordinals is already becoming a bit too frothy and speculative just two months after being created. Case in point: Yuga Labs -- the creator of the Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks NFT collections -- is now going to issue a new 300-piece NFT collection for Bitcoin called TwelveFold. While Yuga Labs says there will be no added utility for these NFTs (such as VIP access to Bored Ape Yacht Club events), it's almost certain there will be heightened demand for these NFTs simply due to their novelty and the potential to flip them for a huge profit.\n\nAdding Bored Apes into the Bitcoin discussion complicates matters considerably from a regulatory perspective. Until now, Bitcoin has avoided the scrutiny of regulators, who generally acknowledge that Bitcoin is the only crypto that should not be regulated as a security. Bitcoin is a digital currency, full stop. But if Bitcoin now offers NFTs, that argument becomes a lot harder to make.\n\nKeep in mind that there is already an SEC investigation into the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection from Yuga Labs. The SEC claims the Bored Apes might actually represent an unregistered securities offering.\n\nSo what happens when Yuga Labs issues the new TwelveFold collection for Bitcoin? It would be a shame if Yuga Labs somehow gets Bitcoin mixed up with regulators.\n\nMoreover, there is a very real risk that adding NFTs to Bitcoin might dissuade risk-averse institutional investors. How are large pension funds and endowments going to react when they find out there are tiny photos or videos potentially inscribed into their Bitcoin holdings?\n\nFor me, it would be like opening up my leather wallet and finding out that someone had drawn tiny cartoon figures next to the serial numbers on my U.S. fiat money. Yes, it's still money, and yes, it still works, but wouldn't you feel a bit silly carrying it around with you all day?\n\nWill Ordinals change the way investors value Bitcoin?\n\nThe current size of the NFT market pales in comparison to other markets where Bitcoin is making its presence felt. Even if you take the rosy view of things and say the NFT market is worth $20 billion, that's still just one-sixth the size of the global remittances market, where Bitcoin is playing an increasingly important role.\n\nThe value of other markets where Bitcoin is gaining market share are measured in the trillions of dollars, not billions. For example, Bitcoin is viewed by some investors as a form of \"digital gold.\" And the value of the world's physical gold supply is approximately $12 trillion.\n\nLong story short: NFTs probably won't move the needle when it comes to valuation. While there has been plenty of commentary saying Bitcoin NFTs could make Bitcoin even more valuable than it already is, my basic take is this: If you're buying Bitcoin because of the NFTs, you're doing it all wrong. Bitcoin is a fantastic long-term buy, not because of NFTs, but because of its role in key financial markets where it is becoming increasingly mainstream on a global basis."

        "title": "Is the IMF shutting the door prematurely on Bitcoin as legal tender? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "There\u2019s been little sunlight this crypto winter, so it may seem odd to present the \u201cBitcoin as legal tender\u201d argument again. That is, will or should any country \u2014 other than El Salvador and the Central African Republic (CAR), which have already done so \u2014 declare Bitcoin (BTC) an official national currency?\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) raised the issue again last week in a paper putting forth nine crypto-focused policy actions that its 190 member countries should adopt. First on its list of \u201cdon\u2019ts\u201d was elevating crypto to \u201clegal tender.\u201d Or, as the multilateral lending institution\u2019s executive board assessment stated:\n\n\u201cDirectors generally agreed that crypto assets should not be granted official currency or legal tender status in order to safeguard monetary sovereignty and stability.\u201d\n\nMaybe it\u2019s not fair to ask the question with crypto back on its heels, but was the IMF right to warn its member banks about cryptocurrencies? And if so, what exactly is lacking in the composition of private digital money that makes it unsuitable as an official national currency? Maybe it\u2019s Bitcoin\u2019s well-documented volatility, but if that\u2019s the case, couldn\u2019t the world\u2019s oldest cryptocurrency still grow into a new role as an auxiliary scrip \u2014 perhaps in a few years when it has more users, is more liquid, and exhibits less price variance?\n\nThe IMF must tread carefully\n\n\u201cThe IMF\u2019s mandate is to promote global economic stability and growth. It is therefore reasonable that the IMF has recently advised countries to refrain from granting legal tender status to crypto-assets, which are, by design, often disruptive in nature,\u201d Gavin Brown, associate professor in financial technology at the University of Liverpool, told Cointelegraph. \u201cSuch disruption does arguably present just as many opportunities as threats, but the IMF must tread a more prudent path when faced with such open-ended uncertainty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are very good economic reasons why most countries would not want to adopt cryptocurrencies like BTC as their local scrip,\u201d James Angel, associate professor at Georgetown University\u2019s McDonough School of Business, told Cointelegraph. \u201cIn short, they don\u2019t want to lose the profits from printing their own money or the economic control over the economy that fiat currencies provide.\u201d\n\nWhile crypto maximalists may skewer governments for printing money non-stop to paper over deficits, \u201csometimes, the right thing to do is to print money,\u201d added Angel, \u201clike in the Great Recession or the pandemic. The trick is not to print too much, which happened in the pandemic.\u201d\n\n\u2018Bitcoin was made for the Global South\u2019\n\nIn its policy paper, the IMF had multiple arguments for its position beyond crypto\u2019s well-documented volatility. It could expose government revenues to foreign exchange rate risk. Domestic prices \u201ccould become highly unstable\u201d because businesses and households would spend time deciding whether to hold fiat or BTC \u201cas opposed to engaging in productive activities.\u201d Governments would have to allow citizens to pay taxes in Bitcoin \u2014 and so on.\n\nAdopting crypto as legal tender could even affect a government\u2019s social policy objectives, the IMF paper stated, \u201cparticularly for unbacked tokens, as their high price volatility could affect poor households more.\u201d\n\nBut questions remain. Even if the IMF arguments are valid and hold in most circumstances, aren\u2019t there exceptions? What about developing countries struggling with inflationary currencies, like Turkey?\n\n\u201cBitcoin was made for the Global South,\u201d Ray Youssef, co-founder and CEO of Paxful \u2014 and a founder of the Built With Bitcoin Foundation \u2014 told Cointelegraph. \u201cIn the West, a lot of attention is paid toward the suspected volatility of Bitcoin. That\u2019s because the world runs on the dollar and the West is shielded from global inflation. Right now, Turkey has an inflation rate of over 50%, and Nigeria has an inflation rate of over 20% \u2014 in these economies, Bitcoin is a strong bet.\u201d\n\nBut even in instances like these, it may not be so easy. \u201cIn order for cryptocurrency to be used effectively as legal tender in developing countries, governments will [still] need to heavily invest in the technological infrastructure and a suitable regulatory framework,\u201d Syedur Rahman, a partner at law firm Rahman Ravelli, told Cointelegraph. If this can be done, it \u201cwill assist in financial inclusion.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdopting a foreign/hard currency or monetary standard is a last resort to rein in hyperinflation,\u201d commented Angel. \u201cBut even weak governments like to have the power of the printing press, as it provides a taxation mechanism to pay the troops.\u201d\n\nThe Central African Republic made crypto legal tender in April 2022 \u2014 the second country to do so, after El Salvador. Some CAR representatives said that crypto would help reduce fees for financial transactions in and out of the country. Maybe that, too, is a valid reason to elevate crypto to official currency.\n\nRahman acknowledged that \u201cthere are benefits such as seeing a reduction in transaction fees for financial transactions. If there is a weak traditional banking system or lack of trust, then cryptocurrency undoubtedly can provide an alternative means of payment.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemittance is a great use case for Bitcoin,\u201d said Youssef. \u201cMoney transfer companies charge high fees and funds can take days to arrive.\u201d Bitcoin cuts down on fees, and transactions can take minutes. People who may not have a bank account can take advantage of remittances too. \u201cThis is a huge deal when you look at the amount remittances bring into some countries. In El Salvador, remittances account for over a quarter of the country\u2019s GDP.\u201d\n\nOthers were dismissive, however. \u201cI think legal tender status in this context is likely a gimmick. I\u2019m not sure how I might be more motivated to send BTC to someone living in CAR just because BTC is now viewed as legal tender in that jurisdiction,\u201d David Andolfatto, economics department chair and professor at the University of Miami\u2019s Miami Herbert Business School, told Cointelegraph.\n\nMoreover, the act of granting a \u201cforeign\u201d currency legal tender status \u201cseems to me to be an admission that a country\u2019s institutions cannot be trusted to govern society effectively,\u201d added Andolfatto, a former senior vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis where he became one of the world\u2019s first central bankers to deliver a public talk on Bitcoin in 2014.\n\nBitcoin remains questionable as legal tender because it does little to quell the so-called \u201cflight-to-safety\u201d phenomenon, wherein the demand for money shifts violently with sudden changes in consumer or business sentiment, Andolfatto explained.\n\n\u201cThese violent swings in the price level are unnecessary [...] What is needed is a monetary policy that expands the supply of money to accommodate the demand for money in times of stress. The provision of an \u2018elastic currency\u2019 serves to stabilize the price level for the benefit of the economy as a whole.\u201d\n\n\u201cTransaction fees are a friction on global economic activity,\u201d noted Brown, and developing nations often bear the burden of these inefficiencies. Still, \u201cIn my view, a pivot to crypto assets, such as in El Salvador today, is a risk too big to take,\u201d Brown said. Georgetown\u2019s Angel added, \u201cEl Salvador and CAR are special cases since they did not have their own currency to start with.\u201d\n\nMore maturity\n\nBitcoin is still relatively young and volatile. But with wider adoption, including institutional investors, couldn\u2019t it become a stable asset, more like gold? \u201cThere is some merit to this argument,\u201d says Andolfatto. \u201cI believe BTC price volatility will diminish as the product matures.\u201d But even if BTC remains stable for long periods of time, \u201cit will always be susceptible to \u2018flight-to-safety\u2019 phenomena that would generate sudden large deflations \u2014 or inflations if people are dumping BTC,\u201d he added. \u201cBTC will appear stable, but it will remain fragile.\u201d\n\nYouseff, like some others, suspects the IMF has ulterior motives in all this. The fund is interested in self-perpetuation, he suggested, adding:\n\n\u201cBitcoin has proven to lower inflation, give more people access to the economy and international work, increase transparency and act as a universal translator of money. It also has the potential to lessen a country\u2019s reliance on international centralized power \u2014 like the IMF. It\u2019s not hard to connect the dots on why the IMF is not welcoming of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\n\u201cCryptoassets such as Bitcoin are still young in currency terms,\u201d noted Brown, but their inherent weaknesses like price volatility and pseudo-anonymity could present \u201cinsurmountable challenges from the perspective of nation-states. Nonetheless, Bitcoin has become a backstop alternative when fiat currencies fail through macroeconomic events such as hyperinflation and controls around capital flight.\u201d\n\nIf not the lead, still a supporting role?\n\nFor the sake of argument, let\u2019s agree with the IMF, crypto skeptics and others that there is no future role for Bitcoin as legal tender or official currency \u2014 even in the developing world. Does that still preclude BTC and other cryptocurrencies from playing a useful social or economic role globally?\n\n\u201cI see a very useful role for crypto technology, which is why I have been a vocal proponent of CBDCs [central bank digital currencies] since 2014,\u201d answered Angel. \u201cThere are very good reasons why over 100 central banks are working on these.\u201d\n\nBut he\u2019s skeptical about Bitcoin because \u201cgovernments have a long history of pushing private money aside. I\u2019m surprised that it has taken as long as it has for governments to react and attempt to push aside Bitcoin in order to get all the seigniorage revenue for themselves.\u201d\n\nOverall, crypto assets such as Bitcoin may continue \u201cto be held in limbo by many nation states and regulators,\u201d opined Brown, given that they are inherently anti-establishment but also \u201cnear impossible\u201d to ban in free societies.\n\nBitcoin and other digital assets can still serve a positive role as \u201cthe trigger forcing the monopoly, which are central banks,\u201d to think again about their monetary policies \u201cand to innovate in response,\u201d said Brown."

The trio was arrested last week and search warrants were executed on their residences in Florida and Illinois.\n\n3 men, 1 business charged in cryptocurrency scam; avoid Bitcoin of America ATMs, Cuyahoga Co. prosecutor says https://t.co/LaR1L2E1yH \u2014 News 5 Cleveland (@WEWS) March 2, 2023\n\nAccording to the prosecuting attorney Andrew Rogalski, romance scammers, law enforcement impersonators, and \u201crobocallers\u201d exploited the lack of Anti-Money Laundering protections in the firm\u2019s systems to transfer funds out of users\u2019 crypto wallets.\n\nRogalski commented during a press conference that \u201cthese ATMs are ready-made for scammers,\u201d adding that they:\n\n\u201cDirect the victims, which are often elderly or otherwise vulnerable, to specifically go to Bitcoin of American ATMs, take money that they\u2019ve withdrawn from their savings accounts or 401Ks.\u201d\n\nThey are then instructed to put the cash into the machine in exchange for BTC in a wallet they think is theirs but have no control over, he explained.\n\nHe added that in one instance, an elderly gentleman lost $11,250 in three transactions to one of the dodgy kiosks in under an hour to this scam.\n\nProduct image of a Bitcoin of America kiosk.

Bitcoin of America made $3.5 million in profit from cash deposits at these unlawful kiosks in 2021, Rogalski said.\n\nOfficials believe the firm has been operating and evading regulatory safeguards and financial compliance requirements since 2018.\n\nThe investigation into the firm and its executives was reportedly spearheaded by the United States Secret Service's Cyber Fraud and Money Laundering Task Force.\n\nIn October, the FBI\u2019s Miami Field Office warned that crypto ATMs were becoming a popular vehicle for scammers to defraud victims in an increasing trend of \u201cpig butchering\u201d scams."

        "content": "Bitcoin bear market builders convened in London for the Bitcoin-only conference Advancing Bitcoin, which ran from March 2\u20133.\n\nCommon Bitcoin (BTC) conference vernacular like \u201cmacro,\u201d \u201cshitcoin\u201d and \u201cdebt spiral\u201d was absent from the debate, replaced by computer science terms like \u201cOP_return,\u201d \u201cnonce\u201d and \u201cordinals\u201d dominating the discussion. The two-day developer conference was technical and thoughtful \u2014 a space to get one\u2019s hands dirty writing code.\n\nFedi's Leon Johnson organized and kicked off the conference. Source: Michaelayophotography79\n\nLeon Johnson, a conference organizer and the head of operations at Bitcoin company Fedi, told Cointelegraph that the conference is entering its fourth year and the profile of attendees has slowly evolved:\n\n\u201cIn 2019, we had a lot of what I would call hobbyists, enthusiasts, tinkerers. And those same people have now kind of progressed to work for Bitcoin companies.\u201d\n\nTrue to its name, the conference has advanced Bitcoin hobbyists to Bitcoin companies. Gaming company Zebedee, for example, spun up from interactions at Advancing Bitcoin, Johnson explained.\n\nAlex Leishman, CEO of River \u2014 a U.S.-based Bitcoin accumulation and Lightning Network company \u2014 told Cointelegraph that the event is a high-quality arena for builders:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to be in workshops and presentations that really dig into the weeds and the inner workings of the innovations happening in the space \u2014 whether it\u2019s ordinals, Lightning Network, protocol upgrades \u2014 and what those then mean for user experience and for improving the actual products we\u2019re all trying to build.\u201d\n\nTrue to form, developers and computer scientists pitter-pattered on their keyboards throughout the conference. Attendees as young as 10 constructed hardware wallets from scratch, spun up code, and interrogated the blockchain and Bitcoin mempool. An entire day was dedicated solely to workshops.\n\nCointelegraph\u2019s Joe Hall was conference comp\u00e8re. Source: Michaelayophotography79\n\nEchoing comments made by other developers and computer scientists, Johnson highlighted that progress is good, but the layer-2 Lightning Network is still in its infancy, and Bitcoin is just a teenager at almost 15 years of existence. So, what does Bitcoin need to mature?\n\n\u201cBitcoin needs people. We need more than speculators. We need people that care about applications.\u201d\n\nEric Sirion, co-founder of Fedi and maintainer of the Fedimint protocol, joined in: \u201cDon\u2019t gamble \u2014 it\u2019s a bear market, and bear markets are for building.\u201d It\u2019s time to \u201cget out there and inspire people,\u201d he suggested.\n\nRelated: UK is \u2018likely\u2019 to need digital currency, says BoE and Treasury: Report\n\nUncle Rockstar (not his real name), the brains behind some of Bitcoin company Strike\u2019s inner workings concluded the first day of talks. Rather than delve deeper into technical specifications, as other talks did, Rockstar chose to chide, reassure and motivate developers, particularly those working on free, open-source software.\n\nUncle Rockstar (who chooses to hide his features) gives a talk. Source: Alex Waltz\n\nBear markets can burn out the best of us, he explained during his talk. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to take a break and pick up a fiat job before returning to building.\u201d Leishman agreed:\n\n\u201cI think Bitcoin is going to become the money of the world and is going to completely change everything. We can speed that up if we\u2019re smart about how we approach it.\u201d\n\nWith Bitcoin\u2019s price continuing to wallow in the low $20,000s, the bear market continues to grind on. Advancing Bitcoin recently announced its intention to travel to M\u00e1laga, Spain with the concept in autumn. The Spain edition will focus on businesses and institutions and have less of a developer focus."

        "content": "Yuga Labs, the company behind the Ethereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection and the biggest player in the NFT world, just made 733 BTC ($16.5M) from its first-ever Bitcoin NFT auction.\n\nThe top 3 winning bids out of the 288 NFTs, named Twelvefolds, were:\n\n7.12 BTC ($159,954)\n\n7 BTC ($156,963.8)\n\n4.12 BTC ($92,384)\n\nThe lowest winning bid was 2.25 BTC, while the average winning bid was 2.55 BTC.\n\nBelow is an example of the Twelvefolds artwork:\n\nNot a bad debut, considering all the controversy around the launch.\n\nWhy the spiciness? Because of how the bids were placed and the ongoing debate around how Bitcoin and Ethereum should stay in their respective lanes.\n\nEthereum has always been the go-to blockchain network for the ~$10.3B NFT ecosystem. That\u2019s what the protocol was built for: dApps and other decentralized projects.\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, is the OG cryptocurrency whose blockchain was designed mainly for monetary purposes, not for developers to build decentralized projects on top of. It\u2019s much slower, more expensive, and less sophisticated than Ethereum\u2019s.\n\nEnter the recent Bitcoin NFT craze. Casey Rodarmor (a developer) built a system on Bitcoin called Ordinals that are basically NFTs attached to individual satoshis (the smallest possible denomination of a Bitcoin.) This is what Yuga Labs used to mint its Twelvefold NFTs.\n\nBut since Ordinals are so new, there\u2019s not a marketplace yet for users to easily trade them, like there is Opensea and Blur for Ethereum-based NFTs. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t even have the smart contract capacity to allow developers to create Opensea equivalents for Bitcoin-based transactions.\n\nSo here\u2019s how people had to place bids on the Twelvefold NFTs: they transferred Bitcoin to a Yuga Labs-controlled wallet to place a bid. They also had to present a separate and empty self custody wallet and trust that Yuga would send either the TwelveFold inscription to it if they won the bid or their refund if they lost the bid.\n\nOne user said the process was out of the \u201cstone age.\u201d\n\nso the way yugas auction will work tomorrow is everyone sends Bitcoin to one wallet and if you lose the bid they promise to manually send it back\n\n\n\nlikely tens of millions of dollars\n\n\n\nwe\u2019re still in the stone age \ud83d\udc80 \u2014 Giancarlo (@GiancarloChaux) March 5, 2023\n\nEven Rodarmor (the guy that invented Ordinals) doesn\u2019t approve.\n\nHe agreed with a Twitter user that said Yuga was setting a bad example with its bidding process, which he called \u201ca scammer\u2019s dream,\u201d though Yuga will likely still refund everyone\u2019s unsuccessful bids.\n\n\u201cIf I, personally, Casey Rodarmor, ever see you, Yuga labs, the entity, fuck around with degenerate bullshit like this again, I will wash my hands of you forever and encourage others, including those close to me to do the same,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nSo what happens now? Well if Yuga tries another auction like this, it sounds like Rodarmor will kick off a boycott against the company. We\u2019ll see how that goes.\n\nThere\u2019s also the question of NFT players like Yuga dragging Bitcoin into regulatory wars (the SEC has been investigating Bored Apes.)\n\nControversy aside though, a $4 billion-dollar NFT giant like Yuga Labs legitimizing Bitcoin NFT adoption like this isn\u2019t unmeaningful, plus Galaxy Research predicts that the Bitcoin NFT market could be worth $4.5B by 2025. That\u2019ll excite investors.\n\nBut as some Twitter users said, Yuga Labs opened a door that maybe it shouldn\u2019t have.\n\n\u201cThe nascency of the Ordinals infrastructure ecosystem, coupled with Yuga Labs\u2019 size and reputation, will allow this auction mechanism to succeed in this instance,\u201d Alex Thorn, managing director and head of research at Galaxy Digital, told Milk Road. \u201cBut this is not a path that should be encouraged for future mints and auctions, which will likely not have a heavy weight like Yuga Labs to underwrite them.\u201d\n\nKatie Canales Katie joined Milk Road in December 2022 as a writer for its daily newsletter. She previously was a founding member of Morning Brew's crypto newsletter, Incrypto. She covered the technology sector at Business Insider for four years prior to that."

        "content": "A popular crypto analyst is unveiling his forecast for Bitcoin (BTC) after the king crypto plunged over 6% on March 3rd.\n\nAnalyst Justin Bennett says in a recent newsletter that Bitcoin bulls should pay close attention to the $23,130 price for BTC.\n\nAccording to the trader, BTC could witness another sell-off event if bulls fail to recapture the key price area.\n\n\u201cThe key for bulls is a reclaim above the $23,130 monthly open. The longer Bitcoin trades below that area, the stronger it becomes as resistance.\n\nIf Bitcoin bulls fail to reclaim $23,130, we could move toward the $20,800 liquidity pool.\n\nIf they can reclaim $23,130, then $23,800 is the next hurdle for buyers.\n\nBut, for now, Bitcoin is range bound between the January trend line at $21,900 and the monthly open at $23,130.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $22,491, way below the analyst\u2019s crucial price level.\n\nLooking at Ethereum (ETH), Bennett believes that the leading smart contract platform is following in the footsteps of BTC. According to the analyst, ETH could be gearing up for the next leg down as long as it is trading below $1,600.\n\n\u201cAs of now, the $1,600 area is new resistance based on recent closing prices and lows this week.\n\nThe monthly open is just above that at $1,605, so keep that in mind.\n\nIf ETH bulls can\u2019t reclaim $1,605 in the next few days, we\u2019ll likely see a retest of $1,500 support, and below that is the $1,420 confluence of support.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $1,575.\n\nAs for blockchain scaling solution Polygon (MATIC), Bennett says the altcoin looks bearish and appears to be at risk for a move below $1.\n\n\u201cOne thing that\u2019s a bit concerning is how MATIC has (so far) been unable to climb back above $1.179 today.\n\nThat\u2019s been a key pivot since late January, so a daily close below it could be significant.\n\nIf MATIC closes below $1.1790, the next stop is $1.056 unless it becomes a fakeout, of course.\n\nBut all in all, MATIC looks increasingly weak, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see $1.056 tested in the coming days, if not the $1 mark or lower.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, MATIC is worth $1.15.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Even BTC is a security - CoinGeek",
        "content": "This post originally appeared on ZeMing M. Gao\u2019s website, and we republished with permission from the author. Read the full piece here.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler recently commented that, except for Bitcoin, all \u2018crypto\u2019 are securities.\n\nWe mostly agree but would further argue that even BTC is a security, according to the Howey test, due to its base-protocol being controlled and frequently changed by a centralized entity (Core developers and proponents behind the scene), which in at least one major forking event resulted in a re-issuance of all existing bitcoin. The genuine Bitcoin (Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, BSV) alone satisfies that exception, thanks to its locked protocol that prevents control, re-issuance, and manipulation by any entity or group, hidden or apparent.\n\nIn addition, BTC does not have qualifications for a commodity exemption, while BSV does.\n\nWe are, in fact, encouraged by the SEC Chairman\u2019s straight and courageous interpretation of the law. Given the pressure that comes from a misinformed public and motivated stakeholders, it is not easy for public officials and legislators to hold a correct understanding of the pertinent law and technology.\n\nThe risk is that lacking such an understanding, they could be impeded by self-doubt, fearing being viewed as backward obstructionists. But we would like to tell Chairman Gensler\u2019s SEC that they are doing the right thing by enforcing the law, and what they are doing is helping to advance the technology, contrary to what some in the media are saying. This is because the crypto market has become cancerous and is the biggest obstacle to the true development of blockchain technology, and enforcing the securities law against illegal securities offerings and even Ponzi schemes makes a bit more room for the real technological and business innovations.\n\nThe Howey Test\n\nThe present legal standard in the U.S. for determining whether something is a security is summarized in the Howey Test according to a U.S. Supreme Court case SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293 (1946).\n\nThe Howey test has been quoted or formulated in various ways. For accuracy, the following is the exact quote from the original Supreme Court opinion:\n\n\u201c\u2026an investment contract, for purposes of the Securities Act, means a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party\u2026\u201d\n\nThe above statement became the Howey Test, according to which if an instrument meets all the following criteria, it is a security:\n\npeople invest money in a common enterprise and are led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party\n\nIt should be noted that (1) the term \u2018investment contract\u2019 has been broadly interpreted to not only include an explicit contract, but any transaction or scheme that fits the description; and (2) the subsequent case law has downplayed the word \u2018solely\u2019 in the above fourth prong but instead used a reality test of substantial reliance.\n\nAt the same time, it should also be noted that most opinions, commentaries, and analyses of the Howey test neglect the following two important sub-elements in the Howey decision:\n\n(1) The actor and the act that \u2018led\u201d the investor to expect profits. That is, there has been an inaccurate overemphasis on the subjective state of the investor\u2019s mind, neglecting the promoter\u2019s objective acts to promote a suspect investment scheme.\n\n(2) The need for a nexus among the factors (actors and acts) found in the Howey test. The requirement of such a nexus is completely illogical, albeit implicit. The courts never put it that way explicitly in the past only because they never needed to. But the situation with Bitcoin and crypto has made it necessary to consider such a dimension in order to discern the differences.\n\nApplying the Howey test to crypto\n\nMost digital currencies offered to the public meet all of the elements of the Howey test easily because they all have a common enterprise operating to promote the value of a coin or token, which are purchased by investors who invested money and were led to expect profits through the effort of others (who most likely are the identified common enterprise, but can be another related party as an active participant).\n\nHowever, as will be demonstrated further below in this article, the four elements in the Howey test are not considered in isolation from each other. There must be a connection between them. That is, a nexus is required among the four elements. Especially to be classified as a security, the \u2018investment,\u2019 the actor or acts that \u2018led\u2019 the investors to expect profits, the \u2018efforts,\u2019 and the \u2018third party\u2019 identified in the Howey test should not be completely unrelated to any interest in the identified \u2018common enterprise.\u2019\n\nWe demonstrate that, under the Howey test and according to the principles of securities law, the only exception among the digital assets is one that satisfies all of the following conditions:\n\n(1) did not do pre-mining;\n\n(2) had no new issuance, re-issuance, secondary offering, and/or airdropping in its lifetime (through whatever hidden or clandestine means);\n\n(3) is based on genuine Proof-of-Work (PoW); and\n\n(4) has a locked base protocol according to the law.\n\nPre-mining by an issuer or a related party is relevant to the Howey test because it indicates not only the existence of a common enterprise, but also that there is a nexus between the common enterprise and the investment made by the coin purchasers. An issuer who does a pre-mining shows control and influence over the coin or token, and by the time when the coin or token was distributed to purchasers (investors), the investment by the purchasers clearly had a direct relationship with an asset (the pre-mined coin) of the common enterprise.\n\nNew issuance, re-issuance, a secondary offering, and/or airdropping may establish the issuer as a relevant common enterprise, even if this wasn\u2019t the case before the new issuance or re-issuance. This matter will be discussed further below in detail in the context of Bitcoin history.\n\nIf the underlying blockchain uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS) or any other consensuses that use different names but are, in essence, still Proof-of-Stake, the coin is a security. This is because PoS places an owner of the coin in a position akin to that of a traditional shareholder of a corporation. This will also be discussed below in detail.\n\nThe SEC has in the past indicated that it does not see Bitcoin as a security, as Bitcoin has been sufficiently \u201cdecentralized.\u201d\n\nHowever, we argue that even BTC is a security and that the SEC has misapplied its own standard due to its misunderstanding of BTC.\n\nBTC, a severely distorted version of Bitcoin, does not meet the nonsecurity standard. The following are some of the reasons:\n\n(1) It does not have true decentralization. It is centrally controlled by a small group of Core developers, who in turn are subject to the control or influence of certain interest groups hidden behind the scenes. The centralized nature of BTC is strongly evidenced by the fact that it does not have a locked base protocol, and further by the fact that it has indeed frequently changed the base protocol by exercising the power of that centralization.\n\n(2) Even though bitcoin was not a security to start with, BTC subsequently became one by covertly re-issuing the coin as a new coin, namely BTC, when the BTC blockchain forked from the original Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n(3) Further, it has been deliberately transformed from the original bitcoin\u2019s design of utility (a Peer-to-Peer cash system) to a purely speculative investment.\n\nThe original Bitcoin (BSV) is the only exception\n\nThe original Bitcoin, however, is an exception. Bitcoin is not a security, according to the Howey test.\n\nBut the reason why the original Bitcoin is not a security, according to the Howey test, is not because of what most people vaguely claim, that Bitcoin is sufficiently decentralized. That claim is very vague and quite useless, because the concept of \u2018decentralization\u2019 is far more complicated than most people even realize (See Decentralization \u2013 a widely misunderstood concept). Further, decentralization can be easily faked to mislead people who don\u2019t fully understand the inner workings of the system.\n\nWith the above notion, we give a very simple and basic reason why the original Bitcoin is not a security according to the Howey test, and develop the thesis from there:\n\nIt is not a security because it does not have a \u2018common enterprise\u2019 as defined in the Howey test and the securities laws.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s own use of \u2018sufficient decentralization\u2019 as a reason to exonerate BTC is actually also based on similar reasoning, specifically, there is no common enterprise whose effort is expected by the investors to promote the investment. But it is not fully and precisely reasoned due to its lack of sufficient understanding of how Bitcoin and BTC actually work from a deep inside viewpoint. As a result of the SEC\u2019s insufficient reasoning, it may reach erroneous conclusions when it is applied to actual coins such as BTC and BSV.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with arguments that Bitcoin is a security from the law enforcement viewpoint, but then provide rebuttals to prove that BSV, not BTC, qualifies as an exception.\n\nThe prima facie argument why Bitcoin is a security:\n\nEven with the original Bitcoin, a \u2018common enterprise\u2019 does exist, and therefore is a security. There are three candidates that could qualify as the requisite \u2018common enterprise\u2019:\n\nThe coin issuer The developers who work together as a common law partnership, whether incorporated as one or not The miners who collaborate to maintain the blockchain as a common-law partnership, whether incorporated as one or not.\n\nAny one of the above three, qualifies as a common enterprise, would be sufficient.\n\nThe rebuttal, why the original Bitcoin is not a security:\n\n(1) The issuer is not such a common enterprise. Although the original issuer (Satoshi Nakamoto) could be classified as an \u2018enterprise,\u2019 it is not the kind of \u2018common enterprise\u2019 in the context of the Howey test, which requires more than a mere existence of an enterprise, but also that the enterprise is a common enterprise connected, or having a nexus, with the other elements in Howey test, especially \u2018the investment\u2019 and \u2018the efforts of others.\u2019 See the later section of this article for more discussions on the connectedness or nexus.\n\nMore specifically, as far as his role as the \u2018issuer\u2019 is concerned, the original issuer Satoshi Nakamoto himself was not and never became a common enterprise that received an investment in the meaning of the Howey test.\n\nFirstly, Satoshi issued 21 million bitcoin tokens all at once, not to himself, nor to a treasury of his or his company, but to an automated unilateral contract to which he was bound. He did not do any pre-mining. At the initial issuance, he, as the issuer, did not sell any bitcoin to anyone. Further, when the tokens were issued, they had no value. When the tokens subsequently gained value, no proceeds of the token transactions went to Satoshi by virtue of his being the issuer (and Satoshi\u2019s subsequently becoming a miner earning bitcoin is an entirely separate matter).\n\nTherefore, unless Satoshi subsequently makes substantive changes to the automated unilateral contract, he cannot be a common enterprise in the meaning of the Howey test because there is no nexus between him and the investment (coin purchases).\n\nSatoshi as the issuer essentially cut himself out of the loop where the securities law applies.\n\nThe fact that after the issuance of bitcoin, Satoshi himself became a miner on the same basis as any other miner in the world according to the automated unilateral contract does not change the above conclusion because even though it is the same person, a miner plays a different role. And whether the miners are a requisite common enterprise will be a different issue discussed below.\n\n(2) The miners of bitcoin are not the common enterprise either. This is not only because miners are decentralized due to the Proof-of-Work consensus (as the SEC also correctly recognized), but more importantly because bitcoin miners are highly specialized by acting according to the terms of the automated unilateral contract. They do not participate in any governance, such as policies/protocol making. They have their own corporate structures, each with its own company shares as securities, but that has nothing to do with whether bitcoin is a security or not. The purchasers of bitcoin do not make an investment in the miners. The miners do not receive any proceeds from the coin purchases. They are just paid with bitcoin for their specialized service.\n\n(3) Neither are developers are not a common enterprise. But this is not because they are merely individuals and not Incorporated (a misunderstood issue by most people, very likely by the SEC as well), but because they have no power to change the base protocol which relates to the terms of the issuer\u2019s unilateral contract, as the base protocol is supposed to be locked and set-in-stone. Developers only work on improving the software to better execute the base protocol and the unilateral contract, which are fixed both in the technical sense and the legal sense. Unable to change the base protocol and the issuer\u2019s unilateral contract, the developers have no power to carry out any kind of new issuance or re-issuance of the original bitcoin. They may have a fiduciary duty to the bitcoin issuer and the bitcoin owners, but they are not a common enterprise in the meaning of the Howey test that is connected to the investment from the bitcoin purchasers.\n\nTherefore, the original Bitcoin is not a security because there is no requisite common enterprise in the meaning of the Howey test and the securities laws.\n\nBut it should be clear at this point that only the original Bitcoin, BSV, not BTC, satisfies the conditions laid out in the above rebuttal for an exception to the Howey test. Only BSV has kept the original Bitcoin protocol, locked it and set it in stone, and has never made any changes to cause a new issuance or re-issuance of the coin, intentionally or not.\n\nBTC does not.\n\nBTC does not qualify for an exception\n\nTo put it succinctly, history shows that BTC\u2019s core developers, colluding with miners and \u201ccrypto\u201d exchanges, effectively changed the nature of Bitcoin, and reissued the coins as a new and different coin.\n\nThe above conclusion may seem odd to people who do not have a solid grasp of how bitcoin works and what happened in the past. Most people\u2019s attention is superficially on the name \u2018Bitcoin\u2019 and the ticker \u2018BTC.\u2019 They automatically assume that because BTC continued with the original name and ticker, it must be the original coin.\n\nBut the correct identity of which coin is the original Bitcoin is of legal, technical, economic, and financial significance, and must be investigated and determined as such, and cannot be based on a passive recognition by the misled public.\n\nThe fact becomes clear once one gets to the root of the issue to understand the actual definition, identity, and history of Bitcoin.\n\nHere is the simple and straight fact:\n\nEvery time when the actual underlying blockchain changes the base protocol that not only affects transactions but also affects the automated unilateral contract originally issued and fixed by Satoshi, the coin is no longer the original coin. From that point on, any coin that continues on the changed blockchain is materially a new coin. It does not matter what name or ticker it carries, nor what the market price it receives. This is because the market is not the factfinder for this matter; it simply votes according to whatever information it was fed, and in this case, they were fed deceptive information.\n\nOnce such a new coin is issued, we have a new issuer. But unlike Satoshi, the original issuer who had completely and cleanly cut himself off the securities loop (see above), the new issuer is actively in the game and stays so.\n\nMore specifically, the new issuer is now clearly the requisite \u2018common enterprise\u2019 according to the Howey test and the securities law. Accordingly, the underlying coin (BTC in this case) became a security, even if it was not initially.\n\nThe above is exactly what happened in Bitcoin history. Among the multiple forks of Bitcoin, BSV is the only one that kept the original protocol unchanged. This can be proven beyond any doubt, not only in what it stands for in principle but also in exactly what it actually is and does.\n\nThe unchanged base protocol is critical in this analysis, not only because it is the only way to maintain genuine decentralization but also because it is the only way to maintain the nonsecurity nature of the original coin and not to corrupt into a new coin that effectively becomes a security.\n\nBTC did exactly the opposite.\n\nWithout a locked base protocol, the BTC Core developers have always had control, both direct and indirect, over the blockchain and the coin. Even though there is a pretense of the full node consensus, the Core has acted with an effective dictatorship when needed.\n\nFor example, the major political change SegWit only had a limited voluntary uptake among the nodes when proposed. Only 20% to 30% of the nodes by hash power signaled acceptance. BTC Core developers responded by saying that if these nodes didn\u2019t implement SegWit the Core would change the proof of work algorithm and bankrupt them. That threat was effective. It was just one example to show the kind of centralized control BTC is under, despite the false impression of being decentralized it has created.\n\nAfter SegWit, BTC Core developers continued to make changes, including Taproot, that were not voted on by the majority of users or exchanges and were forced upon everybody.\n\nPut aside the numerous protocol changes that BTC has made, the first major event of forking, which eventually led to BTC and BCH is an undeniable event that constituted a new issuance or re-issuance, as discussed above.\n\nThe moment when BTC forked by changing the original protocol, the coins became a different coin. Whether that new coin is a security or not must be determined by its own nature and characteristics, because it cannot automatically inherit the nonsecurity status from the original coin, given that the very substantial nature of the coin has changed.\n\nThe new issuance of BTC as a different coin had both a legal and technical character. Legally, as discussed above, it was reissued as a security because the new coin satisfies all four elements of the Howey test.\n\nBut it is also necessary to understand how it did it technically, not because the technical aspects would change the legal conclusion in this case, but because it is helpful to better understand it and to avoid confusion caused by the deep technical obfuscation.\n\nBefore forking, just one set of coins (bitcoin) existed on one chain. At the moment of forking, two separate blocks were generated each representing the different chain, let\u2019s say chain A and chain B, the picture of the entire set of coins looks like the following:\n\nChain A: contains all the original UTXOs on the previous blocks before the fork, plus new UTXOs created in the first forked block on chain A. Let\u2019s call them UTXO Prior, and UTXO Fork-A, respectively.\n\nChain B: contains all the original UTXOs on the previous blocks before the fork (identical to that of Chain A), plus new UTXOs created in the first forked block on chain B. Let\u2019s call them UTXO Prior, and UTXO Fork-B, respectively.\n\nThat is, at the moment, the only difference between chain A and chain B is that between UTXO Fork-A and UTXO Fork-B on the new blocks, which are of a very small number compared to the unchanged UTXO Prior on the historical chain. UTXO Fork-A and UTXO Fork-B would have different addresses because they were generated in different blocks by different miners meant to build different chains. But all the UTXOs in UTXO Prior are identical on both chain A and chain B because they are the exact copies of the original chain, with just one difference: they are now on different chains.\n\nBut because there are two different chains, clearly, we now have two different sets of coins, including those in the identical UTXO Prior. Not only do they exist on different chains, but they are also presented to the market as two different assets.\n\nWith the above picture, now ask the following critical question:\n\nWhich of the above two sets of coins is the original bitcoin?\n\nIf one is not confused by the technical obfuscation, the answer is simple and clear: it has to be the one chain that maintained the original protocol. The one that has changed the original protocol becomes a new coin.\n\nAnd technically, it became a new coin and was recognized in user wallets by way of \u2018airdropping.\u2019 This kind of airdropping may not be easy to tell because the users of the wallets may not explicitly observe an actual event of airdropping (i.e., new coin being dropped to the wallets for free), but in reality, what happened was exactly the same as an airdropping.\n\nJust imagine the user of a wallet that has the original bitcoin. When the fork occurred, the original UTXOs owned by the user remained in his wallet, but something material had happened due to the forking: now those UTXO addresses suddenly became two different sets of coins, one on chain A (BCH and subsequently BSV), and one on chain B (BTC). The user automatically owns both. This has happened not because something has changed in the user\u2019s wallet but because something has changed on the blockchains and further on the coin exchanges.\n\nBut since the coins on chain A are just a continuation of the original bitcoin, the coins on chain B have been simply created out of thin air, the equivalent of an airdropping.\n\nWe are, of course, not against, as a matter of principle creating and issuing new coins. But the key matters at hand now are as follows:\n\n(1) as far as the securities law is concerned, which one is the original bitcoin that has established itself as a nonsecurity, and which one is newly created?\n\n(2) is the new coin still a nonsecurity?\n\n(3) does the market deserve to know the correct answers to the above questions?\n\nWe believe the answers to those questions are clear. BTC became a new coin at the fork, and the new coin qualifies as a security. And as it continued to be offered to the market without registration, it violated securities law.\n\nAnd the fact that BTC was able to fool the market into believing that itself was the original bitcoin not only lends no relief to the above conclusion, but in fact, it aggravated the offense because not only did it become an illegal security, but it also committed active fraud against the investors.\n\nHere, the exchanges were also involved because it was their decision in collusion with the Core developers to assign the then-existing ticker BTC to chain B and call it Bitcoin when they should have done the opposite if they followed the principle of the base protocol set by Satoshi. Other than that principle, there was no other self-evident truth in determining which was which. Doing the opposite of what the original base protocol indicated, their only explainable motivation then was ulterior.\n\nIn addition to creating a new coin that was a security, the airdrop also triggered a taxable event, as the new coin was no longer the original asset that had been held, unsold, not transferred or exchanged, but a materialized profit from the original asset, thus a taxable income.\n\nBCH did the same at a subsequent fork between BCH and BSV, and, therefore also became a security.\n\nBelow in this article, we discuss further the difference between Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS), and also the important matter of nexus.\n\nPoW, PoS, and the Howey test\n\nIn this article, we explain the legal reason why the \u2018specialization of services\u2019 in PoW has an impact on whether the underlying asset is a security or not.\n\nIt is mostly because the \u2018specialization of services\u2019 separates the investment from the requisite common enterprise and therefore yields a negative result according to the Howey test.\n\nHowever, this \u2018separation\u2019 can be destroyed if the issuer pre-mines the asset (coins or tokens), because once the issuer pre-mines, a nexus exists between the money investment and the issuer which is now a suspect of the requisite common enterprise according to the Howey test.\n\nThe genius of PoW is deeply and widely misunderstood. The PoW as originally designed by Satoshi maybe essentially described as follows:\n\nA competitive economic system that requires nodes to each perform and demonstrate a signal-work in order to prove both its honesty and ability to perform a utility-work.\n\nThe bifurcation of work into two different kinds of work in PoW, namely a signal-work, and a utility-work, is critical not only to the overall design of Bitcoin as a scalable and secure system but also to the question of the Howey test. The bifurcation of work leads to specialization and labor division, which in turn, along with a locked base protocol, causes the nonexistence or disappearance of a common enterprise requisite, according to the Howey test.\n\nTherefore, the original bitcoin that is based on PoW and has a locked protocol is not a security because the buyers of bitcoin do not invest in a common enterprise.\n\nIn contrast, a crypto asset based on PoS is a security under the Howey test because the stakers are analogous to shareholders of a company, and the stakers (shareholders) bought the tokens (1) as an investment of money (2) in a common enterprise (3) with an expectation of profits (4) predominantly from the efforts of others.\n\nThe common enterprise\n\nIt is clear both PoW and PoS satisfy the first element of the Howey test: investment of money.\n\nIt is also quite easy to identify a common enterprise working behind any crypto asset, be it PoW or PoS. The common enterprise may be the issuer of the asset, a group that maintains a consensus, a group of developers, a company that builds the common infrastructure, or the mining business as a collective whole in their effort of operating the blockchain according to the rules set by the issuer, etc. Legally speaking, the \u2018common enterprise\u2019 does not need to be an incorporated legal entity. The common law standard applies.\n\nIf the above two are established, it is also fairly easy to establish the other two elements of the Howey test as well: investors also have an expectation of profits predominantly from the efforts of others.\n\nTherefore, it may appear that even bitcoin with PoW meets the Howey test, is thus a security suspect.\n\nHowever, it is the existence or absence of a nexus between the investment and any common enterprise in the ecosystem that is important. It makes the genuine bitcoin based on the original PoW consensus different from other coins. See below.\n\nNexus required in Howey test\n\nConcerning the Howey test, a focus has been on the existence or lack thereof of a \u201ccommon enterprise.\u201d\n\nHowever, there is an implicit nexus among the four elements required in the Howey test. The nexus is especially important between the first test element and the second one (\u201cinvestment of money\u201d and \u201cin a common enterprise\u201d), meaning that for the Howey test to be positive, investors must have invested the money into the common enterprise.\n\nIf there is no common enterprise for investors to invest into, the transaction does not meet the Howey test. Or, although an enterprise does exist in the ecosystem, the investment has nothing to do with the enterprise (but is rather related to something else), it still does not meet the Howey test. The mere existence of both an investment and an enterprise somewhere in the ecosystem does not qualify for the Howey test.\n\nIn other words, if the investors have invested money into something that\u2019s different from the identified \u201ccommon enterprise,\u201d the Howey test would result in a negative, and the asset would not be a security.\n\nIt is the absence or existence of this nexus that is the most important difference between PoW and PoS.\n\nThe requisite nexus exists in PoS\n\nA PoS system not only has a distinctive \u201ccommon enterprise,\u201d it also has the requisite nexus.\n\nWith PoS, once a common enterprise is found to exist (which usually does), the nexus is inherently there, and it is quite obvious. There is no separation, not even an essential and substantive distinction, between possessing coins and performing validation by the validators in PoS. The validators derive their acting power and benefit directly from the very fact that they hold \u201cshares\u201d of this common enterprise. The shares, in essence, are non-distinguishable among all shareholders, except for a nonessential difference in the manner in which they receive a \u2018dividend.\u2019\n\nWhether they are staking to become a validator or not, they are all investing into this same enterprise (the common enterprise). This makes the PoS coin holders essentially the same as any shareholders who have shares of a conventional enterprise and therefore are holders of a security.\n\nIn other words, with PoS, coin purchasers effectively buy shares of a common enterprise which runs the PoS-based blockchain creation and validation business. They are all shareholders of the common enterprise. When some shareholders happen to also stake for validation using the shares and thus receive an extra benefit, they are nonetheless still shareholders of the same common enterprise and do not change the non-staking coin purchasers\u2019 role as shareholders either.\n\nThis is akin to a company\u2019s equity shareholders who are also workers or employees of the company receiving an extra benefit in wage compensation, except that PoS ties the stakes even more directly with the compensation by not even requiring the \u201cshareholder-employees\u201d to perform real work other than exercising voting rights proportional to each one\u2019s shares.\n\nNo requisite nexus in genuine PoW\n\nIn contrast, with genuine PoW, mining nodes derive their benefit by performing real work. The fact that a mining node may also own some coins (bitcoin, for example) is merely incidental. The ownership of the coins does not constitute the business of mining. Performing the mining work does. There is a fundamental separation between possessing coins and performing mining work by the PoW miners.\n\nIn other words, even if one could characterize holders of bitcoin as some kind of investors who have invested in something, that \u2018something\u2019 is not an identifiable \u201ccommon enterprise\u201d in active operation. Rather, they just purchased a thing (a commodity), not the share of a common enterprise.\n\nThe case is particularly clear and strong with the genuine bitcoin based on genuine PoW.\n\nFirst, the investors did not invest in an issuer to create more coins. The issuer of bitcoin, namely Satoshi, issued all the coins all at once in the beginning without having any coin purchasers\u2019 participation. The bitcoin issuer isn\u2019t a continuing enterprise that needs investment. In the case of bitcoin, the truth is that Satoshi, the issuer, would have received no money either directly or indirectly from the investments by others had he, not himself mined coins as a miner on exactly the same terms as the other miners. And the fact that the issuer did also do mining is coincidental and has no inherent relationship with the issuer\u2019s identity.\n\nIn this respect, any secret arrangement, such as pre-mining, that gives the issuer an unfair advantage makes the asset a suspect. The genuine bitcoin had no such arrangement.\n\nSecond, bitcoin purchasers did not invest in the mining business. It is the shareholders of the mining companies who have invested in the mining business, and these shareholders are a different category than the coin holders. The company shares of a mining business are clearly securities, and no one could honestly argue they are not, but there are different from bitcoin.\n\nThird, bitcoin purchasers did not invest in a common infrastructure development business. Shareholders of the blockchain infrastructure development companies have invested in the development business, but again they are in a different category than the coin holders. Likewise, the company shares of an infrastructure business are clearly securities, but they are different from bitcoin.\n\nAn example of a nonsecurity digital asset\n\nOne distinct example is Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV).\n\nBSV is the original Bitcoin, according to the whitepaper \u201cA Peer-to-Peer electronic cash system. \u201d It is based on genuine Proof-of-Work (POW); and has a locked base protocol according to the law.\n\nNot only the legal theory but also the actual evidence supports the lack of a gravity center acting as a force to attract speculative investors.\n\nDue to its emphasis of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) cash payment utility (versus \u201cdigital gold\u201d and \u201cstore of value\u201d narratives) by design, BSV clearly has far less attraction to pure speculative investors. The way the market has treated BSV is, in fact, a harsh and bitter showing that BSV can only succeed on its having developed real utility and not by merely selling a narrative. (But is it not what it should be like in a real world of business?)\n\nBut at the same time, this rather peculiar phenomenon is also circumstantial evidence that BSV is not a security but a commodity which lives or dies based on its utility.\n\nAs BSV\u2019s ecosystem further develops, coin purchasers are more and more purchasing the satoshi tokens for the utility (to actually use them) rather than with a mere expectation of profit.\n\nIn the case of BSV, the empirical behavior and the legal theory are in harmony. Both the lack of an investable common enterprise and the lack of nexus in an actually invested common enterprise, along with the asset\u2019s being centered around utility, clearly demonstrated a nonsecurity asset.\n\nThe spirit of the law\n\nLastly, looking beyond the letters of the law, it is relevant to consider the spirit of the law as well. The spirit of the securities law, including the Howey test, is to protect investors from issuers/sellers of certain things that have a strong speculative nature.\n\nThere is a twofold reason why \u201csecurities\u201d as a category are particularly risky:\n\nFirst, those behind securities are strongly motivated to get investors\u2019 money; and\n\nSecond, the investors, on the other hand, are strongly drawn to a prospect of receiving a return without actually doing any work because all work is done by others in the enterprise that is supposed to create the underlying return.\n\nTherefore, when a common enterprise exists as a center of gravity to pull many investors in, you want some protection for the public. This gravitational pulling is critical in assessing the reality and is also reflected in the Howey test\u2019s use of the word \u2018led\u2019 in the phrase \u2018led to expect profit\u2019, a word that deserves much more attention than it has had in the past.\n\nThe securities law does not make fundraising illegal per se. It just subjects fundraising process to certain regulatory requirements.\n\nHowever, almost none of the existing crypto coins and tokens were issued and exchanged in a manner that satisfies such regulatory requirements. Therefore, to be legal, a crypto must pass a negative Howey test and be thus considered not to be a security.\n\nFor this purpose, a digital asset that runs on a genuine decentralized PoW consensus with a base protocol locked according to the law passes a negative Howey test and may not be required to register as a security because such an asset does not have a common enterprise that exists and acts as the center of gravity.\n\nEspecially, if the digital asset is further designed to primarily serve as a nontrading utility, it tends to be even less likely to form a center of gravity that is in itself speculative and also attracts speculating investors.\n\nBTC and the other cryptos do not have such qualities in reality.\n\nTo reveal the reality, an empirical demonstration that is more than mere theoretical considerations would be necessary to show such nonspeculative characteristics. To this end, the factfinder is encouraged to compare the messages that run deep and run on top of the ecosystem and the mindset of each coin, and ask these questions:\n\nIs it not the main message of BTC to the world \u2018the number go up\u2019?\n\nIs it not the main message of BSV to the world, \u2018utility and value only, not the price\u2019?\n\nIs it not the main message of BTC to BSV \u2018enjoy staying poor\u2019?\n\nIs it not the main message of BSV to BTC \u2018wake up and do something useful\u2019?\n\nSecurities, commodities, and currencies\n\nIn the U.S., securities, commodities, and banking products are placed under different jurisdictions. Securities are under the SEC, commodities under the CFTC, and banking products under the FDIC. Because the SEC has the most strict and burdensome registration and reporting requirements, it is usually advantageous to be classified as a commodity or a banking product rather than a security.\n\nTo escape from the Howey test, a digital asset must either prove it is an exception that does not fall into the definition of a security according to the Howey test or prove it is a statutory exemption.\n\nFor coins and tokens that were created from nothing and further promoted by an identifiable entity or people, it is very hard to argue for an exception of the Howey test. As a result, the focus has been on arguing that the thing is either a commodity or a currency as an exemption.\n\nCommodities\n\nHistorically, the enactment of laws such as the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 and CFTC Act of 1974 did provide legislative exemptions to commodity trading, such as the futures and options from the securities law.\n\nHowever, these laws have quite restrictive definitions of \u2018commodities\u2019 under the jurisdiction of the CFTC. The legal definition of \u2018commodities\u2019 is quite different from that in economics.\n\nIt is a misunderstanding that anything that can be classified as a \u2018commodity\u2019 in terms of economics would be automatically exempted from securities law. To be statutorily exempted, it would have to literally fall within the legal definition of a \u2018commodity\u2019 with no ambiguity, and this certainly does not include bitcoin, nor any crypto coins.\n\nAt the present time, barring new legislation that clearly brings bitcoin and certain crypto coins under the jurisdiction of the CFTC, an ambiguity exists between securities and commodities and, accordingly, between the jurisdictions of the SEC and CFTC. For example, just because the CFTC claims certain crypto asset are commodities does not exclude the SEC from claiming the same as a security. Without clear legislation, there could be competition and even conflict between the two branches of the government agency.\n\nBut we also argue that a true commodity should not clearly be a security according to the Howey test in the first place. We note that the purpose of the commodities law was to eliminate unnecessary litigations due to ambiguities in the securities law interpretation rather than simply carving out exemptions in contradiction with the securities law.\n\nTherefore, the statutory exemption should be sought and provided in a principled manner. This is necessary to bring harmony to the two sets of laws, which are meant to serve the same society.\n\nIt is important to note that the commodity laws in the U.S. were created at a time when all commodities were physical, and as a result, only the derivatives (such as futures, forwards, and options) based on commodities had significance to the financial markets and therefore needed to be regulated. The spot market of physical commodities did not have such needs and certainly did not have an effect of speculative investments to impact investors.\n\nWith digital assets such as bitcoin and crypto coins, this has all changed. Regardless of whether you see them as securities or not, these things can be traded directly (i.e., without forming derivatives) on exchanges with the same level of investor participation that of stocks, and clearly with even higher level of speculations. The entire crypto mass is a testament to this dire effect. See The Cancerous Crypto.\n\nThe law, therefore, must look at the substance instead of form. If investors need protection on the stock market by securities law, they certainly also need the same kind of protection on speculative offering and trading of digital assets if what\u2019s being offered and created clearly meet the Howey test.\n\nIn this sense, just because something is a commodity in an economic sense should not result in an automatic exemption from securities law.\n\nOn the other hand, if something does not clearly meet the Howey test (or even clearly does not meet the Howey test), while at the same time clearly has characteristics of a commodity, it should be regulated under the CFTC. This should not only include the derivatives but also include spot trading on exchanges.\n\nApplying the commodities law to BTC and BSV would show that BTC does not have strong qualifications for a commodity, but the genuine Bitcoin BSV does (see below).\n\nCurrencies\n\nAlternative to commodities, currencies is another potential exemption of securities law.\n\nRipple, for example, argues that its XRP is a currency, and therefore is exempted from securities law.\n\nHowever, as the SEC has clearly argued in its case against Ripple, the currency exemption applies only to legal tender such as a fiat currency.\n\nThe Ripple case is another example of confusion over terminologies. The word \u2018currency\u2019 has different meanings in different contexts. When it comes to securities law exemptions, it is the specific legal definition, not the definition in economics or technology, that applies.\n\nAgain, what is important is the substance, not the form or words. The reason why a conventional fiat-based currency isn\u2019t a security is not because it is a currency in an economic or technical sense but because it does not meet the Howey Test. Specifically, (1) a conventional fiat-based currency is not issued by an enterprise but by the government; and (2) obtaining a conventional fiat-based currency is not an investment, nor with an expectation of profits predominantly from the efforts of others, but to get a reliable medium of value exchange.\n\nCurrently, no cryptocurrency, including bitcoin, has really become legal tender. A convincing argument can be made that the genuine bitcoin BSV is a currency in a technical sense, but it would still be hard to persuade a court that it is a currency in a legal sense (i.e., legal tender).\n\nHowever, we do believe BSV is a true commodity and, therefore, should be exempted from the securities law, an alternative to finding an exact exception to the Howey test. See more discussion on this point below.\n\nThe genuine Bitcoin BSV qualifies for the commodity exemption, but BTC does not\n\nApplying the commodities law to BTC and BSV, it is clear that BTC is much less like a commodity than BSV is.\n\nThe most important characteristic of a commodity is standardization. A commodity is standardized both in its substance (as a good or service) and in its contracts.\n\nFor bitcoin, there would be no standardization if its base protocol kept changing. The base protocol affects the substantive nature of bitcoin. The change in the base protocol is analogous to a change in the manufacturing process that results in a material of different chemical properties, thus destroying the standardization of the substance, as the thing you buy the next time might be different from what you think it is today. The fact that it is always labeled and packaged under the same name does not mean it is the same thing when measured by its properties, such as what it can or cannot do.\n\nIn addition, a base protocol change directly affects transactional contracts, resulting in less reliable contract standardization. To the users, when a script created for a transaction could be rendered unusable sometime in the foreseeable future (which has already happened with BTC), there would be no reliable standardization in contracts. Besides, if the base protocol is changed in such a manner that it alters the original automated unilateral contract between the bitcoin issuer and miners (which again has already happened with BTC), it destroys another aspect of standardization.\n\nIn comparison, BSV does not suffer any of those problems thanks to its locked protocol.\n\nTherefore, from a commodity viewpoint, there is a sharp contrast between BTC and BSV. BSV has the most evident characteristics of a commodity, but BTC does not.\n\nWe also note that BSV being a true commodity is congruent with it being a non-security according to the Howey test. It ought to be.\n\nAs illustrated above, BSV clearly is not a security. In consideration of the harmony between the two sets of laws, a true commodity should not clearly be a security according to the Howey test in the first place. The purpose of the commodities law was to eliminate unnecessary litigations due to ambiguities in the securities law interpretation rather than simply carving out exemptions in contradiction with the securities law.\n\nThe same is also why Congress passed laws treating traditional commodities differently than securities in the first place. An apparent characteristic of a commodity is that it is a standardized good or service with standardized contracts. But it also has implicit characteristics that are related to the Howey test.\n\nSpecifically, a typical commodity does not read on the Howey test to behave like a security. People buy a commodity primarily for its utility, not as an investment, or at least are not actively led by others to believe it is an investment, to expect a profit from the effort of a recognizable third party (a common enterprise). This line is blurred when people buy derivatives such as futures of a commodity, but such futures are still underlined by a real commodity whose main property is utility rather than speculations. It was precisely for this reason, the commodities laws were created to avoid unnecessary litigation in securities law.\n\nIn addition to utility, the production and promotion of a commodity should not be under the control of a single entity or an effective global partnership acting in coordination (the common enterprise). Otherwise, the thing would look more like a security. This would be the case especially when the controlling common enterprise is able to create among the investors a belief in speculations that are detached from the actual utility. Besides, imagine a producer being able to create a virtual commodity out of thin air and \u2018issue\u2019 it to others. It would make the producer more of an issuer of a security than a producer of a commodity.\n\nIn conclusion, BTC does not have good qualifications for a commodity and should not enjoy the commodity exemption. But if BTC could even be remotely considered as a commodity, the genuine Bitcoin (BSV) is certainly much more so. As a commodity, BSV should be regulated as such instead of a security. This means BSV is an exemption from the securities law, an alternative to finding an exact exception to the Howey test.\n\nLegislation considerations\n\nAt the same time, new legislation could further clarify the legal definition of a commodity to properly take digital realities into consideration.\n\nWith multiple bills being introduced in Congress (for example, S.4760 \u2013 Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act of 2022, and H.R.7614 \u2013 Digital Commodity Exchange Act of 2022), it is important that legislators understand not only the apparent issues but also the nature of the new asset class well. Currently, two opposite types of risks exist at the same time. One is the risk of inaction causing prolonged uncertainty, and the other is herd action hyped by misunderstandings.\n\nThe risk is that, given the public pressure, the legislators may be too eager to please the crowd, desiring to be viewed as heroes protecting technological advances. But in reality, the opposite is true. The crypto market has become cancerous and is the biggest obstacle to true development of blockchain technology.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe only digital assets that are not a security are ones that satisfy all the following conditions:\n\n(1) did not do pre-mining;\n\n(2) had no new issuance or re-issuance in its lifetime;\n\n(3) is based on genuine Proof-of-Work (PoW); and (4) has a locked base protocol according to the law.\n\nExcept for the genuine bitcoin (BSV), other cryptos, even BTC, are all nonexempt securities.\n\nThe genuine bitcoin BSV is not a security. It is also a true commodity. Having harmony between the laws of commodities and securities on a utility blockchain that serves as an authentication layer in a global data network is for everyone\u2019s good.

        "content": "Just a few months after the very first NFT was inscribed into Bitcoin, developers are trying to imbue the age-old blockchain with another new-age technology: rollups.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what Rollkit\u2014a self-described \u201cmodular framework for rollups\u201d\u2014claimed over Twitter on Sunday, revealing a research integration that would allow \u201csovereign rollups\u201d on Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to Rollkit, its new rollup solution lets users produce rollups by retrieving and storing data on the Bitcoin blockchain.

        "title": "Monetary policy of cryptocurrencies, explained - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "What is monetary policy in crypto? Monetary policy in crypto refers to the mechanisms used to manage the supply and circulation of cryptocurrencies. These mechanisms are intended to ensure the sustainability, stability and predictability of a coin\u2019s value over time. Cryptocurrencies rely on decentralized protocols to handle their monetary policy, as opposed to conventional fiat currencies, which are controlled by central banks and governments. These protocols may contain a number of tools for regulating the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply, including block rewards, changes to the mining difficulty and issuance rates. For instance, Bitcoin (BTC) has a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins. As time goes on, the pace at which new coins are introduced to the supply continuously declines, eventually causing a deflationary situation as the rate of new supply gets closer to zero. On the contrary, certain cryptocurrencies may employ alternative mechanisms to govern their monetary policy, like proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus systems, which use staking to encourage network activity and control the cryptocurrency supply.\n\nHow do cryptocurrencies have monetary value? Cryptocurrencies have monetary value because people assign value to them, much like any other currency or asset. A cryptocurrency\u2019s value is primarily influenced by market forces of supply and demand. A cryptocurrency will become more expensive if there are more buyers than there are sellers prepared to accept their offers. The price will fall, however, if there are more sellers of a cryptocurrency than there are buyers ready to purchase it. Related: What is tokenomics? A beginner\u2019s guide on supply and demand of cryptocurrencies Other factors that can influence the value of a cryptocurrency include its utility, security and adoption. For instance, a cryptocurrency that is widely recognized as a form of payment and has a clear use case will probably be worth more than one that is not extensively accepted. Furthermore, cryptocurrencies with robust security features and a track record of dependability will often be more valuable than those with lax security or a history of hacks and flaws.\n\nHow will cryptocurrencies affect monetary policy? Although the precise impact will depend on how widely cryptocurrencies are used and integrated into the current financial system, cryptocurrencies have the potential to influence monetary policy in a number of ways. Here are some possible ways in which cryptocurrencies could affect monetary policy: Reduced control over the money supply: Due to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies and the lack of a central controlling entity, standard monetary policy tools like printing money or changing interest rates may not have the same effect on them as they do on fiat currencies. This might restrict central banks\u2019 power to affect the total amount of fiat money in circulation.\n\nNew sources of data: Large amounts of transactional data generated by cryptocurrencies could be used to get important insights into consumer behavior and broader economic patterns. It may be necessary for central banks to figure out how to include this data in the decision-making process.\n\nIncreased competition: Since cryptocurrencies provide an alternate method of payment and a store of value, they may become more competitive than traditional fiat currencies. This can put pressure on central banks to keep their currencies stable and valuable to remain competitive. Additionally, banks are experimenting with CBDC projects in response to the potential threat of cryptocurrencies, which could disrupt traditional banking and payment systems.\n\nEnhanced financial inclusion: Cryptocurrencies have the potential to give people and enterprises who might not have access to traditional banking services better financial access and inclusion. As a result, monetary policy may shift as central banks may need to consider how a more diversified and decentralized financial system will behave. Related: What is a CBDC? Why central banks want to get into digital currencies\n\nWho controls Bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy? BTC\u2019s monetary policy is controlled by the rules built into the Bitcoin software protocol, which is open-source and operates in a decentralized manner. The protocol\u2019s rules dictate how new BTC is created and distributed over time. Moreover, any proposed changes to the protocol must be approved by a majority of the network\u2019s users, making Bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy subject to the consensus of its users. Particularly, the protocol\u2019s built-in issuance schedule serves as the foundation for Bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy. The total number of BTC that will ever be created is 21 million. New Bitcoin is produced through a process called mining, where users compete to solve challenging mathematical problems in exchange for rewards that include newly created BTC. The mining reward is automatically reduced by half every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years), a process known as halving. This indicates that as time passes, the rate of new BTC generation declines, eventually resulting in a maximum supply of 21 million. One of the main components of Bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy is its constant supply, which works to maintain scarcity and prevent inflation.\n\nDo stablecoins alter the monetary policy transmission mechanism? Stablecoins may function outside of conventional banking and payment systems and may offer an alternative form of payment and store of value, which has the potential to change how monetary policy is transmitted. A classic monetary policy transmission mechanism involves the employment of various tools, such as changing interest rates by central banks to affect the money supply, the actions of financial institutions and the behavior of people. Stablecoins, however, might operate separately from these conventional dynamics and might not be directly impacted by adjustments to interest rates or other monetary policy instruments. For instance, stablecoins may be considered a safe-haven asset, particularly during periods of market turbulence or economic unpredictability. Stablecoins may see a surge in popularity during these times, which may lessen the impact of conventional monetary policy tools like interest rate increases. Moreover, stablecoins might alter the demand for conventional fiat currencies and affect the effectiveness of monetary policy if they were to gain widespread adoption. Nonetheless, in order to account for stablecoins\u2019 effects on the whole economy and incorporate them into their policy frameworks, central banks may need to develop new strategies."

        "title": "This Bitcoin Metric Is Forming A \u2018Triple Bottom,\u2019 Here\u2019s What Happened Last Time - NewsBTC",
        "content": "On-chain data shows the Bitcoin active addresses metric is forming a triple bottom right now. Here\u2019s what happened the last time this pattern formed.\n\n30-Day WMA Bitcoin Active Addresses Forms Triple Bottom Structure\n\nAs pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the price of the cryptocurrency saw a sharp increase when this kind of triple bottom structure took shape back during the 2018-2019 bear market.\n\nThe relevant indicator here is the \u201cactive addresses,\u201d which measures the daily total number of Bitcoin addresses that are getting involved in some kind of transaction activity on the chain.\n\nThe metric accounts for both senders and receivers in this calculation, and it also only counts unique addresses, meaning that if the same address makes multiple transfers in a single day, it\u2019s still counted only once.\n\nWhen the value of this indicator is high, it means a large number of addresses are taking part in some transfer activity right now. Such a trend suggests traders could be active in the BTC market currently.\n\nOn the other hand, low values imply not many users are active on the blockchain at the moment. This kind of trend can be a sign that the general interest in the cryptocurrency is low currently.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin active addresses over the last few years:\n\nLooks like the value of the metric has been rising in recent weeks | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nAs displayed in the above graph, the version of the Bitcoin active addresses here is actually the 30-day weighted moving average (WMA) one. A WMA is a type of MA that puts more weight on the newer data as compared to the older one (hence the \u201cweighted\u201d in the name).\n\nFrom the chart, it\u2019s apparent that this indicator\u2019s value had plunged pretty hard as the 2018-2019 bear market started and had remained at pretty low values throughout it.\n\nThe metric had made some attempts to put together an uptrend, but it failed the first two times and created local bottoms. These bottoms, along with the bottom for the initial plunge, together formed a sort of \u201ctriple bottom\u201d shape.\n\nFollowing the last of these three bottoms, the metric was finally able to amass together some actual upwards momentum, as it then went on to rally to a local top.\n\nAlongside this rise in the 30-day WMA active addresses, the price of Bitcoin also observed a rally out of the bear market lows, in an event now called the April 2019 rally.\n\nThere have been some interesting similarities already between the April 2019 rally and the latest price surge that BTC has been observing. Curiously, the active addresses indicator has formed a similar triple bottom pattern in this bear market as well.\n\n\u201cIf Bitcoin follows the triple bottom structure of the last major cycle, we\u2019re about to see incremental price increases across 2023,\u201d explains the quant.\n\nBTC Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $22,400, down 5% in the last week.\n\nThe value of the asset seems to have gone stale since the plunge | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, CryptoQuant.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "LUCKNOW A city-based second-year BCom student allegedly hanged himself on Thursday after losing his \u20b93.5 lakh investment in Bitcoin, a popular cryptocurrency. The victim, a resident of LDA colony under Sarojini Nagar Police station limits, was found hanging from a piece of cloth in the wee hours of Thursday. According to the bereaved family, the boy was depressed after losing the money. (HT Photo)\n\nAccording to the bereaved family, the boy was depressed after losing the money that he had invested in Bitcoin. They added that he stumbled upon an online crypto investment company while using Telegram, a social media app. As the company promised high returns, he started trading in Bitcoins.\n\nHindustan Times - your fastest source for breaking news! Read now.\n\n\u201cHowever, he didn\u2019t receive a penny in return even after investing \u20b93.5 lakh. When he asked for his money back, the company representative he was in touch with stopped picking up his calls. Later, he realised that the company duped him. This provoked him to take the extreme step,\u201d said the victim\u2019s cousin.\n\nSharing further details, Santosh Kumar Arya, SHO, Sarojini Nagar, said, \u201cThe body was sent for post-mortem. Its report confirmed death due to suicide... According to the preliminary investigation, the boy hanged himself after losing money. We checked the company\u2019s authenticity and has found it to be genuine. If the family files a complaint, the matter will be investigated.\u201d he added."

        "title": "What Ordinal NFTs Mean for Bitcoin \u2013 BRINK \u2013 Conversations and Insights on Global Business - BRINK",
        "content": "Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images\n\nThe Bitcoin community is in turmoil. Ordinal NFTs \u2014 also referred to as \u201cDigital Artifacts\u201d and \u201cOrdinal inscriptions\u201d \u2014 surfaced on January 21, 2023, on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin maximalists are furious \u2014 they believe NFTs are spamming and attacking the Bitcoin network. Other Bitcoin enthusiasts argue that Ordinal NFTs make the Bitcoin network not only more fun but also can help generate more revenues for Bitcoin miners.\n\nBitcoin is now home to 100,000+ Ordinal NFTs, including a playable DOOM game clone, and JPEGS of \u201cTaproot Wizards,\u201d \u201cAstral Babes,\u201d and \u201cOrdinal Punks.\u201d\n\nHeated debate has primarily focused on whether Ordinal NFTs are a positive or negative development for the Bitcoin network. The answer depends on whether one believes Bitcoin should be purely a monetary system or serve multiple use cases.\n\nWhether one loves or hates them, the fact is that Ordinal NFTs exist and will continue to be minted on the Bitcoin network \u2014 in the absence of a soft or hard fork.\n\nGiven that Ordinal NFTs have arrived, what do they mean for Bitcoin? Here are my thoughts on three implications:\n\nBlockchain upgrades can bring significant, unintended consequences. Ordinal NFTs could pose a threat to Bitcoin as a medium of exchange and as a store of value. Bitcoin is decentralized in technology and decision-making \u2014 especially because Satoshi Nakamoto has disappeared.\n\nA Brief History of Bitcoin NFTs\n\nImmortalizing non-monetary data (e.g., JPEGs, video files, etc.) on the Bitcoin network is not new. In fact, the Genesis block \u2014 the very first Bitcoin block ever created by pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto included a message: \u201cThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\u201d\n\nBuying/selling immortalized data is also not new to Bitcoin. Counterparty NFTs are an example of Bitcoin-based NFTs that have existed since 2014.\n\nBut three technical features distinguish Ordinal NFTs from previously existing Bitcoin NFTs: 1) content size limit 2) content storage and security 3) cost to mint (i.e., create an NFT).\n\nTwo soft-fork upgrades enabled these net new technical features on the Bitcoin network.\n\nThe SegWit upgrade in 2017 increased the total data that a block could carry to 4MB and created a cheaper category of data The Taproot upgrade in 2021 which enabled the mechanism by which content attached to Ordinal NFTs gets published to the Bitcoin network.\n\nImplication 1: Blockchain upgrades can bring significant, unintended consequences\n\nWithout both Segwit and Taproot upgrades, it would not be possible to upload 4MB of content completely and relatively cheaply onto the Bitcoin network.\n\nYet, the motivations behind the Segwit and Taproot upgrades were far from seeking to enable anything akin to Ordinal NFTs.\n\nSome have dismissed Ordinal NFTs as \u201cnothing new, Bitcoin goes on\u201d since uploading non-monetary content to the Bitcoin network has always been possible \u2014 since the Genesis block.\n\nThese critics are missing the point. Bitcoin NFTs prior to Ordinal NFTs did not achieve mass popularity, at least partly because they were too expensive to mint, and only up to 80 bytes of content could be stored on the Bitcoin blockchain itself. This meant that NFT enthusiasts were incentivized to turn to other blockchains, such as Ethereum, where they faced less restrictive content size (compared to 80 bytes) and fee limitations when minting NFTs. This incentive no longer exists with Ordinal NFTs due to the three new technical features outlined above in Figure 1. Today, more content can be immortalized and secured per NFT on Bitcoin than on other blockchains, including Ethereum, for significantly reduced fees.\n\nImplication 2: Ordinal NFTs could pose a threat to Bitcoin as a medium of exchange and as a store of value\n\nBitcoin maximalists are furious about Ordinal NFTs because they believe that the sole purpose of Bitcoin should be to serve as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, as articulated in Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s whitepaper. Ordinal NFTs attack this vision as they take up block space that would otherwise be used for financial transactions, increase the bandwidth required to operate a full Bitcoin node, and drive up transaction fees for financial transactions on the Bitcoin network.\n\nOrdinal NFT proponents argue that the Bitcoin network can be used by anyone for anything, including funny JPEGs, so long as they can pay the associated transaction fees. After all, the Bitcoin protocol itself permits uploading non-financial content for a price.\n\nIf Ordinal NFTs gain and maintain popularity, they will compete with financial transactions for space on the Bitcoin network. Given the increased demand for block space, the transaction fees needed to transact on Bitcoin will increase. Transaction fees have generally increased since Ordinal NFTs were launched on January 21. Increased transaction fees harm some but benefit others. Those who rely on Bitcoin\u2019s historically low transaction fees \u2014 for example, those who send Bitcoin to send remittances \u2014 will be negatively impacted. Benefit will accrue to other stakeholders, including Bitcoin miners, whose revenues rely partly on transaction fees.\n\nAll else equal, increased transaction fees can threaten Bitcoin\u2019s viability as an everyday medium of monetary exchange in the shorter term. Some would argue that layer 2 solutions, such as the Lightning Network, already solve this potential threat to Bitcoin as a medium of exchange. Yet, layer 2 solutions offer less decentralization and security than the Bitcoin network.\n\nIn the longer term, Bitcoin as a store of monetary value may be at risk. Practically anyone can upload anything up to 4MB to the Bitcoin network for a price that many are willing to pay \u2014 this could run the whole gamut of funny videos, child pornography, confidential documents, how-to guides banned by governments, etc. In particular, if Bitcoin is associated with immortalizing illegal content in significant volumes, Bitcoin\u2019s perceived legitimacy as a legal monetary system will be put to the test.\n\nImplication 3: Bitcoin is decentralized in technology and decision-making \u2014 especially because Satoshi Nakamoto has disappeared\n\nExtreme emotions abound in the \u201cOrdinal NFTs, good or bad for Bitcoin?\u201d debate.\n\nYet, no one can unilaterally take any action.\n\nThe current conflict between Bitcoin maximalists and Ordinal NFT proponents \u2014 where arguments are vehement and actions are curtailed \u2014 reflects Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature, not only in technology but also in decision-making.\n\nThe decentralized nature of decision-making in the Bitcoin community is likely only possible due to the disappearance of Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThe debate about the legitimate use cases of the Bitcoin network has existed since the beginning. In 2009, Nakamoto explicitly indicated their belief that Bitcoin should be used for financial transactions and that financial and non-financial use cases should not mix on a blockchain network (see Figure 2).\n\nA counterfactual scenario to consider: If Nakamoto were still present today, their voice and reason would likely hold significant sway over the Bitcoin community, similar to how Vitalik Buterin\u2019s voice and reason hold weight in the Ethereum community.\n\nBitcoin As Money Is At Stake\n\nRelated Reading Is the Metaverse Dying Already? NFTs: 4 Insights to Capitalize on a Multibillion-Dollar Market How Will Web3 Impact the Future of Work? Purchasing the Metaverse \u2014 How Does It Work?\n\nBitcoin upgrades are highly technical. Translating these highly technical changes precisely and comprehensively into non-technical terms is often challenging. It is incumbent on technical and non-technical Bitcoin stakeholders to work together to think through not only the intended implications for blockchain operations but also the potentially inadvertent implications that often result from a complex web of incentive structures. Thinking through potential unintended consequences is particularly important in a decentralized system, where achieving majority consensus to do \u2014 and undo \u2014 actions is incredibly difficult.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Ordinal NFTs will seriously compete with financial transactions on the Bitcoin network. One thing is clear \u2014 resources to develop the Bitcoin network are limited. When competing priorities exist, no single priority can get full attention.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Metaverse Musings on Substack"

        "content": "The year 2022 was nothing short of a catastrophic year for digital assets, with the crypto world caught up in the chaos of one of the industry\u2019s largest scams. One of the biggest crypto exchanges FTX was a two-week nightmare that experts and analysts predicted will damage and have a long-term effect on crypto users around the world. Albeit, as we just start the month of March, crypto investors may be able to breathe a sigh of relief. Because since January a few coins have been experiencing a bullish-like trend, which crypto enthusiasts hope will continue.\n\nAs crypto users want to invest in the market\u2019s more established digital assets, a \u2018big-eyed\u2019 feline is purring away and grabbing the attention of investors. Because of its enticing features and advantages for investors, Big Eyes Coin (BIG) is becoming more and more well-known.\n\nNonetheless, several well-known cryptocurrencies had a difficult 2022 as a result of the collapse of the FTX exchange. In this challenging time, new cryptocurrencies like Big Eyes Coin saw great improvements.\n\nMake BIG Returns with Big Eyes Coin Loot Boxes\n\nA meme coin project called Big Eyes Coin (BIG) seeks to bolster the crypto market by bringing wealth and more users. It is a cat meme coin that aims to become accepted on the Ethereum blockchain and offer more benefits to its community. Big Eyes Coin is a DeFi solution that promises to combine exchanges, liquidity pool purchases, staking, and other features like NFTs and the metaverse. Since the start of its presale, the meme coin has raised a sizable sum of money and has already gained widespread attention.\n\nLoot boxes will be available for the Big Eyes Coin community. Several adventure-style video games feature mystery boxes called loot boxes. These may be used to unlock new in-game goods, weapons, or clothes. They come randomly when playing a game.\n\nA fortunate member of the BIG community might win up to $100,000 in tokens from one of the three available loot boxes, which are all filled with $HUGE tokens. Today a fourth box has been launched called the \u201cExcali-Paw Master Chest\u201d worth $9,999 and will have rewards ranging from $10k to $1,000,000.\n\nBitcoin \u2013 Where It All Began\n\nAfter running a mining network for almost two years, Satoshi Nakamoto established the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain in 2009. The coin\u2019s introduction as a proof-of-work currency ushered in a new era of decentralised finance in which crypto tokens will dominate a sizable portion of the world financial market.\n\nBefore being made accessible for trading and exchanging, Bitcoin (BTC) was once a token that users had to mine. As users held power over the token\u2019s future, the mining was compatible with its decentralisation aims. Specialised graphics processing units like ASICs can still mine Bitcoin, even though doing so on mobile devices is no longer cost-effective. This has drastically restricted mining to large companies.\n\nBTC relied on scarcity rather than the qualities of the protocol to climb the cryptocurrency rankings. Its main contribution to DeFi was the development of private, secure blockchain technology, which increased user security and promoted the transfer of assets throughout the world.\n\nBlockchains also record each transaction that users make. Only for security reasons may the data be obtained; they cannot be used to identify somebody. Public keys are generated for each transaction, and each user has a private key. For tracing transactions on the blockchain, the public keys operate as reference points.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Everything you need to know about Hard Fork (Bitcoin) - ClearTax",
        "content": "The 2004 iteration (codenamed San Andreas) of the popular video game franchise Grand Theft Auto offered a perfect blend of open-world exploration, humour and action. However, it found particular favour among developers. The numerous modifications to the game enabled gamers to drive fast cars or real-life cosplay characters.\n\nForking in cryptocurrency is synonymous with video game mods. It implies alterations in the basic crypto protocol whose acceptance depends on the platform\u2019s stability.\n\nWhat Is A Hard Fork?\n\nSynonymous with the modifications in video games, forking is essentially an alteration in the crypto transaction chain. These splits create newer crypto versions and are possible because of the decentralised nature of transactions.\n\nForks can be soft or hard, depending on the impact it creates on the online community. Soft forks are flexible and allow users to use the forked and un-forked versions interchangeably.\n\nIn comparison, hard forks are rigid and behave as individual units that are not interchangeable. The 2017 Bitcoin hard fork gave rise to Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin Gold. They work independently, and unlike original Bitcoins, they comprise 8 MB blocks instead of 1 MB.\n\nWhat Are The Types Of Bitcoin Hard Forks?\n\nBitcoin Hard forks are irreversible changes derived from the original BTC blocks. The BTC community has witnessed numerous hard forks aiming to create a dent in the blockchain. Some popular BTC hard forks include:\n\nBTC XT : With a capacity to perform up to 24 transactions per second, BTC XT was one of the first prominent hard forks. With a block size of 8 MB, BTC XT initially witnessed great success with over 1,000 nodes within six months. However, eventually, users lost interest in the project, and it soon ended operations.\n\nBTC Classic : The demand for larger block sizes gave rise to Bitcoin Classic in 2016. Unlike BTC XT, BTC Classic utilises 2 MB per block. Although some developers support BTC Classic wholeheartedly, its importance has steadily declined.\n\nSegregated Witness : Initially launched as a soft fork, Core developer Pieter Wuille introduced SegWit in 2015. It aims to make room for more transactions by reducing the size of individual transactions. However, it simply served the purpose of promoting a hard fork.\n\nBTC Cash Hard Fork : The BTC community realised the need to deal with the occasional snags and delayed transactions faced while dealing with BTC. After a series of soft forks aimed to improve usability, the 2017 hard fork gave rise to BTC Cash. Unlike regular BTC, BTC Cash uses 8 MB blocks, thus making it more scalable and improving the user experience. Its split from the normal BTCalso indicates that it rejects BTC transactions and blocks.\n\nBTC Gold Hard Fork: To make Bitcoin mining more scalable and equal, developers introduced BTC Gold. Unlike regular BTC, it requires basic equipment, and users can mine it on standard graphics processors instead of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC). Gold forking enabled further decentralisation and experimentation devoid of quality compromise.\n\nOther BTC Hard forks: BTC has undergone numerous other experiments in the form of hard forks, which include\n\nBitcoin Diamond\n\nSuper Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin Atom\n\nBitcore\n\nBitcoin God\n\nBitcoin Private\n\nBitcoin Zeo\n\nBitcoin Post-Quantum\n\nWhy Do Hard Forks Happen?\n\nIn simple terms, hard forks are essential upgrades that can transform the blockchain and improve its network. When these upgrades undergo these irreversible changes, they split into two versions: the original blockchain and the upgraded one.\n\nHard forks can happen when developers try to improve the functionality, debug potential errors or resolve a disagreement within the crypto network. When developers tweak the network functionality, they usually allow those not in consensus initially to re-join.\n\nHard forks can also happen accidentally, although they are easily resolvable due to a lack of consensus. Accidental hard forks can occur when two miners work on the same block instantaneously until another miner mines the subsequent block.\n\nForks of other blocks or networks are eventually abandoned because of a lack of consensus. This makes the actual block longer and the more profitable one to invest in.\n\nEffects Of Hard Forks On The Crypto Landscape\n\nThe crypto landscape is primarily favoured for its decentralised and transparent structure. Any substantial changes are visible online in the premise of hard forks and their effect on the crypto community.\n\nThree ways in which hard forks can affect miners and users alike are as below:\n\nAlthough the transparent nature of Bitcoins makes it easy for anyone to inspect and tweak, it may pose difficulties in reaching a consensus to resolve issues. For example, BTC Cash resulted from non-consensus arising out of diversity in perspectives. It is crucial to note that hard forks often cause temporary price volatility.\n\nSince anyone can create a BTC by tweaking the blockchain network, each form of cryptocurrency can have several versions resulting from a hard fork. BTC alone has more than 27 different versions, all existing autonomously.\n\nHard forks represent the diversity and the entire network of BTC or other cryptocurrencies. It promotes empowerment for participants from around the globe, allowing them to research and bring in relevant changes. However, differences in perspective can also cause chaos and potential instability. Such a situation also helps manifest innovation and omits negativity.\n\nH22ard Fork vs Soft Fork\n\nThere are certain inherent differences between Hard Forks and Soft Forks, which are as below:\n\nHard Fork Soft Fork When the underlying source code of a blockchain undergoes irreversible changes, thereby changing its security parameters or adding a particular feature. Soft forks are code changes that can add features and functions without altering the source code and are useful for introducing new features at the programming level. Hard fork nodes in the underlying blockchain will stop processing the blocks in the older network when a blockchain rule is reformed. Soft forks result in a single split, thereby retaining the original blockchain. Soft forks are thus backward node compatible. Hard forks preserve the privacy and security definitions of a blockchain, although that requires a lot of electricity and computing power. Soft forks do not cause any volatility or changes in the security code, thereby saving additional power consumption.\n\nNot all modifications introduced in GTA-SA were widely accepted. The successful ones paved the way for necessary updates in the newer GTA V.\n\nLikewise, hard forks are those changes that actually affect the blockchain and create a new version. The growing popularity and magnetic appeal of investing in BTC require implementing updates. These would stabilise the blockchain network over time."
