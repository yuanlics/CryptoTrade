        "content": "watch now\n\nThe price of bitcoin briefly topped $35,000 for the first time since May 2022, bolstered by positive sentiment about a bitcoin exchange-traded fund and a flight to safety that led to a spike in short liquidations. On Tuesday bitcoin rose 7.97% at $33,900.00, according to Coin Metrics. Late Monday night it reached as much as $35,113.29, its highest level since May 8, 2022. Bitcoin is now up 104% from the start of the year and 105% from its 2022 low. The rally could be fueled in part by investors who were betting against the crypto asset scrambling to cover short positions, in other words, by a short squeeze. Bitcoin saw $275.45 million in short liquidations on Sunday, followed by another $100.44 million Monday, according to crypto data provider CoinGlass. \"The real catalyst that created the 'god candle' [Monday] and pushed bitcoin above $34,000 was the $167 million in short liquidations, mainly on offshore exchanges,\" Ryan Rasmussen, analyst at Bitwise Asset Management, told CNBC. \"I don't think anyone expected the level of price action we're seeing, and those investors who were shorting bitcoin in the $33,000 plus range are certainly feeling the pain of that surprise.\""

        "title": "Why bitcoin is surging again - CNN",
        "content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nBitcoin is rocketing higher, topping $35,000 for the first time since May 2022. It\u2019s up 20% over the past five days.\n\nThe famously volatile cryptocurrency has more than doubled in value this year as investors grow excited about the prospect of being able to buy bitcoin funds that trade on good old-fashioned stock exchanges rather than having to deal with less-regulated and sometimes sketchy crypto platforms (see: FTX, Binance, et al).\n\nThe latest round of excitement came as the BlackRock exchange-traded fund for bitcoin appeared on a list controlled by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corp., a Nasdaq-operated clearing house for stocks and ETFs, according to Reuters.\n\nBlackRock applied in June to register a bitcoin spot ETF, which is pending approval. The company is the largest provider of ETFs in the world, managing trillions of dollars of assets. A BlackRock bitcoin ETF would give the cryptocurrency a new sense of legitimacy.\n\n\u201cThis listing in the DTCC does not mean that the fund has actually been launched or that this will inevitably happen,\u201d said Samer Hasn, market analyst at online brokerage XS.com. \u201cHowever, it may appear as part of BlackRock\u2019s preparations to launch the ETF soon.\u201d\n\nOther companies have also applied for approval to launch similar bitcoin ETFs, including Grayscale Investments.\n\nAlthough the US Securities and Exchange Commission had ruled against Grayscale\u2019s ETF, a three-judge panel for the DC Court of Appeals in August overruled the regulator\u2019s decision. The panel said the regulator had failed to adequately explain why it rejected the firm\u2019s application.\n\nThat has helped boost cryptocurrencies throughout the summer.\n\nStill, the SEC has not approved the fund, and investors may be getting out in front of their skis.\n\n\u201cI think that these rapid rises in bitcoin are somewhat exaggerated,\u201d said Hasn. \u201cRegulatory and legislative concerns are still clouding this market, and I don\u2019t see opportunities soon to dispel these concerns as the legal battles continue.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s another reason why bitcoin may be rising: fear. As investors look to diversify their portfolios in uncertain times, some turn to bitcoin, ironically as a kind of digital safe haven. Sometimes dubbed \u201cdigital gold,\u201d bitcoin has become a way for investors to branch out beyond traditional stocks and bonds."

        "title": "Bitcoin rises to 17-month high as ETF optimism soars - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\n\nBitcoin hit a 17-month high on Tuesday, recouping the losses it sustained in last year\u2019s crash, on rising speculation that US regulators will approve stock market funds that invest directly in the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe price of the digital currency leapt more than 10 per cent in the past 24 hours to $35,000 a token as traders grew increasingly confident the Securities and Exchange Commission would approve an exchange-traded fund in coming months.\n\nIts sharp rise meant that bitcoin, the oldest and most actively traded token, has pulled back all the losses it made in the wake of the failure of the Terra stablecoin last May.\n\nTerra\u2019s sudden downfall sparked an unprecedented crisis of confidence and the collapse of a string of high-profile companies, including lender Celsius and Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX exchange.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s surge has been driven by hopes that in coming months the SEC will resile its decade-long policy of refusing to approve spot ETFs, a stock market fund that hold bitcoins. Wall Street names such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have joined companies such as VanEck and WisdomTree in submitting filings with the SEC.\n\n\u201cThe SEC accepting a spot bitcoin ETF application would validate bitcoin as an established asset class alongside all other asset classes,\u201d said Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex, a London-based broker.\n\n\u201cIt could close the book on rogue and unregulated institutions leading the way on crypto. Major institutions would now have a buy-in into the sector,\u201d he added.\n\nCrypto advocates have said such funds offer consumers a cheap and safe way to trade the token, instead of buying it directly from unregulated crypto exchanges.\n\nThe SEC has argued that it cannot offer investors reassurance that the bitcoin market is not prone to being manipulated.\n\nHowever, the regulator has been under pressure since the summer after a Washington court ruled the agency was wrong to reject an application by asset manager Grayscale to turn its flagship vehicle, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, into an ETF.\n\nTraders said Tuesday\u2019s gains were driven by the listing of BlackRock\u2019s planned bitcoin ETF at the US securities market\u2019s main clearing house.\n\nIt came days after an updated filing from BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, which said that an unnamed investor planned to buy shares in the ETF. The move is common for new or upcoming ETFs in search of fresh capital.\n\n\u201cEvery day, we get news further solidifying the common consensus that the SEC will approve the variety of bitcoin spot ETFs,\u201d said Michael Silberberg, head of investor relations at Alt Tab Capital.\n\nTraders have been positioning themselves for a jump in bitcoin price if an ETF is approved. Earlier this month it rose by more than 8 per cent as false rumours circulated on social media that BlackRock\u2019s application had been approved.\n\nCoinShares, an investment group, said that investors had put $179mn into digital asset funds over the past four weeks and were \u201clikely linked to excitement\u201d over a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nHowever, it noted the flows were below the $807mn that flowed into funds in the four weeks after BlackRock made its first filing last June. It suggests \u201ca more cautious approach from investors this time around,\u201d it said in a research note.\n\nThe SEC is due to make its first rulings on the ETF filings at the start of next year."

        "content": "Indulge me for just a minute. For more than a year now, I\u2019ve watched the industry I cover with a mix of disbelief and despair\u2014there are only so many hacks, frauds, and arrests you can witness without getting jaded. But this week, for the first time in months, I felt something else: optimism.\n\nThe feeling came as the price of Bitcoin reached its highest level since 2022 on Tuesday, and amid a growing consensus the SEC is on the cusp of approving applications for a Bitcoin ETF, and that it will soon do the same for Ethereum. When this happens, ETF providers like BlackRock and Fidelity will likely nudge the thousands of funds they serve to add a small percentage of crypto to their portfolio, driving the price up further. By mid-2024, memories of post-FTX Bitcoin at $15,000 could become quite distant, as the top cryptocurrency\u2014currently sitting above $34,000\u2014climbs to $50,000 and beyond.\n\nThis has certainly happened before. I recall Bitcoin shaking off a post-crash low of $300 in 2014 to climb to nearly $20,000 in 2017, and then, in the next cycle, recovering from a then-floor of $3,000 in 2018 to go all the way to its all-time high of around $65,000. Crypto aficionados with a technical bent say the industry operates in four-year cycles and that we are entering the upswing of another one. They\u2019re not the only ones\u2014Morgan Stanley just published a report titled \u201cWill Crypto Spring Ever Come?\u201d that suggests the worst is over.\n\nIf the good times are indeed returning, it\u2019s interesting to consider who the winners of this cycle will be. In the 2017 boom, cryptographers and technology experts reaped newfound crypto riches, while in 2021 money also flowed to chipmakers and to artists through the NFT market\u2014and also to Lamborghini dealers and makers of tungsten cubes. When it comes to the current cycle, one of the biggest beneficiaries is likely to be the traditional financial industry, which is not only seeking to dominate the impending ETF market but is making use of crypto for payments and settlements.\n\nThis would be an ironic outcome. After all, Satoshi Nakamoto founded Bitcoin to usurp the traditional banking industry\u2014not empower it with new tools. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a zero-sum game. Even if legacy companies reap a big part of the next crypto boom, there will be plenty of other winners\u2014including long-suffering exchanges like Coinbase and the entire Ethereum ecosystem. Meanwhile, if past booms are an indication, there will be an appetite for startups with new ideas. And maybe this time around, investors will actually remember to do due diligence instead of shoveling money to fly-by-night projects and con men.\n\nRemember this is all a best-case scenario. It\u2019s also very possible that a fresh wave of regulatory crackdowns or another massive collapse (you doing okay, Binance?) could snuff out the current rally before it properly takes off. But for today at least, let\u2019s be optimistic.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nDigital Currency Group\u2019s revenue climbed 23% and the company repaid its subsidiary $223 million in Q3, the conglomerate said in a shareholders letter.

        "content": "Screens in Unciphered\u2019s lab show a microscopic image of the layout of the IronKey\u2019s controller chip (left) and a CT scan of the drive. Photograph: Meron Menghistab\n\nNow, after months of work, Unciphered's hackers believe they can open Thomas' locked treasure chest, and they're ready to use their secret cracking technique to do it. \u201cWe were hesitant to reach out to him until we had a full, provable, reliable attack,\u201d says Smith, who asked WIRED not to reveal his real name due to the sensitivities of working with secret hacking techniques and very large sums of cryptocurrency. \u201cNow we\u2019re in that place.\u201d\n\nThe only problem: Thomas doesn't seem to want their help.\n\nEarlier this month, not long after performing their USB-decrypting demonstration for me, Unciphered reached out to Thomas through a mutual associate who could vouch for the company\u2019s new IronKey-unlocking abilities and offer assistance. The call didn't even get as far as discussing Unciphered's commission or fee before Thomas politely declined.\n\nThomas had already made a \u201chandshake deal\u201d with two other cracking teams a year earlier, he explained. In an effort to prevent the two teams from competing, he had offered each a portion of the proceeds if either one could unlock the drive. And he remains committed, even a year later, to giving those teams more time to work on the problem before he brings in anyone else\u2014even though neither of the teams has shown any sign of pulling off the decryption trick that Unciphered has already accomplished.\n\nThat has left Unciphered in a strange situation: It holds what is potentially one of the most valuable lockpicking tools in the cryptocurrency world, but with no lock to pick. \u201cWe cracked the IronKey,\u201d says Nick Fedoroff, Unciphered's director of operations. \u201cNow we have to crack Stefan. This is turning out to be the hardest part.\u201d\n\nIn an email to WIRED, Thomas confirmed that he had turned down Unciphered's offer to unlock his encrypted fortune. \u201cI have already been working with a different set of experts on the recovery so I'm no longer free to negotiate with someone new,\u201d Thomas wrote. \u201cIt's possible that the current team could decide to subcontract Unciphered if they feel that's the best option. We'll have to wait and see.\u201d Thomas declined to be interviewed or to comment further.\n\nA Very Valuable, Worthless USB Stick\n\nIn past interviews, Thomas has said that his 7,002 bitcoins were left over from a payment he received for making a video titled \u201cWhat is Bitcoin?\u201d that published on YouTube in early 2011, when a bitcoin was worth less than a dollar. Later that year, he told WIRED that he'd inadvertently erased two backup copies of the wallet that held those thousands of coins, and then lost the piece of paper with the password to decrypt the third copy, stored on the IronKey. By then, his lost coins were worth close to $140,000. \u201cI spent a week trying to recover it,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cIt was pretty painful.\u201d\n\nIn the 12 years since, the value of the inaccessible coins on Thomas' IronKey has at times swelled to be worth nearly half a billion dollars, before settling to its current, still-staggering price. In January 2021, as Bitcoin began to approach its peak exchange rate, Thomas described to The New York Times the angst that his long-lost hoard had caused him over the years. \u201cI would just lay in bed and think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I would go to the computer with some new strategy, and it wouldn\u2019t work, and I would be desperate again.\u201d"

        "content": "Asset management firm AllianceBernstein put out a memo last Monday not so subtly hyping bitcoin over gold, calling the cryptocurrency a \u201csafe haven asset.\u201d\n\nAllianceBernstein (AB) analysts highlight that aside from Bitcoin\u2019s inherent value stemming from its limited supply of 21 million coins \u2014 referred to as its \u201chard money properties\u201d \u2014 the asset\u2019s returns are undeniable.\n\n\u201cSince its inception, Bitcoin has consistently outperformed gold,\u201d AB analysts wrote in the Oct. 16 note. \u201cOver [the] last 3 years, Gold has been flat, while Bitcoin is up 150% (despite the 60% drawdown in 2022).\u201d\n\nAnd over the last five years, they wrote, bitcoin had five times better returns than gold.\n\nThis note was written prior to the recent multi-day bitcoin rally, which began as early as Sunday night when bitcoin (BTC) was trading at close to $30,000. It then peaked at $35,100 early Tuesday morning, before dipping to just under $34,000 at the time of publication.\n\nAB analysts also pointed out that bitcoin is such a young asset compared to gold, which had its first ETF tracking the commodity\u2019s price in 2004.\n\nIn fact, speculation about a possible ETF is the very thing driving bitcoin\u2019s value up at the moment, even though some industry watchers believe this price action is premature since ETF approvals are dependent on the US Securities and Exchange Commission. So far, the SEC has dragged its feet, delaying multiple spot bitcoin ETF applications multiple times throughout 2023.\n\nAccording to AB, Bitcoin\u2019s main hurdle is its \u201cUX UI\u201d problem. This is an issue the analysts believe can be turned around with the advent of spot bitcoin ETF.\n\n\u201cThe inaccessibility of crypto wallets and the treacherous track record of exchanges, has made Bitcoin inaccessible to the mainstream. The Bitcoin ETF would make Bitcoin accessible in broker accounts, well integrated with private banks and wealth managers/advisors,\u201d AB analysts wrote.\n\nGrayscale could win the race to a bitcoin ETF since the SEC has declined to appeal an August ruling siding with Grayscale. The DC Court of Appeals said the SEC blocking the firm\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF was \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) surged above $35,000 in its largest single-day jump in 13 months, fueled by optimism that regulatory approval of the first spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund is nearing.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency moved up more than 10% Monday, its biggest increase over a 24-hour period since September 2022. The price reached its highest point in a year and a half.\n\nThe stocks of digital asset companies also pushed higher. Coinbase (COIN), the largest US crypto exchange, opened 13% higher Tuesday while MicroStrategy (MSTR) rose 12%. Bitcoin mining firms Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Marathon Digital (MARA) surged more than 13% and 17%, respectively.\n\nThe rally appeared to be driven partly by speculation that the Securities and Exchange Commission was close to granting approval for a spot bitcoin ETF, which would allow investors to get exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to own it.\n\nBlackRock (BLK) is among the money managers that have recently applied to launch such a product.\n\nThe BlackRock logo is pictured outside the money manager's headquarters in Manhattan. (Carlo Allegri/REUTERS) (Carlo Allegri / reuters)\n\nBitcoin backers pointed to the listing of BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust on the website of clearing house Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), while also cheering a suggestion that BlackRock had begun seeding the fund.\n\nA spokesman for DTCC said Tuesday evening that its \"standard practice\" for the company to add securities to its list, which includes \"active and potential\" ETFs, in preparation for the launch of a new ETF to the market and that BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF was added in August 2023.\n\n\"Appearing on the list is simply an indication that an agent bank has requested a DTCC identifier for an ETF fund, and that DTCC may process that transaction at an undetermined date,\" said the DTCC spokesman. It \"is not indicative of an outcome for any outstanding regulatory or other approval processes,\" they added.\n\nSpeculation about BlackRock also drove prices higher last week when a rumor circulated that the SEC had granted its approval for the spot bitcoin ETF. Prices pulled back when BlackRock denied it. Investors expect the agency will rule on the applications by Jan. 10.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere is another factor behind this week\u2019s price swings, according to crypto market data aggregator Coinglass. Over the past 24 hours, $231 million worth of levered positions on bitcoin have been liquidated by investors, 80% of which were short the digital asset.\n\nThe dramatic movements over the last few weeks have some in the crypto community celebrating a return of the enthusiasm that characterized the industry during the early days of the pandemic.\n\n\"We are so back,\" Alex Svanevik, CEO of blockchain analytics firm Nansen, in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nWe are so back. \u2014 Alex Svanevik \ud83d\udc27 (@ASvanevik) October 23, 2023\n\nBitcoin peaked at $68,789 in November 2021 but then crashed in 2022 as the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates and a series of firms imploded, including crypto exchange FTX in November 2022. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is now on trial in Manhattan for multiple counts of fraud.\n\nA widespread crackdown on the crypto industry followed. The SEC sued a number of big players, including Coinbase and Binance.\n\nBut since the beginning of January, bitcoin has more than doubled. MicroStrategy, the Virginia-based software company, is the largest public company holding bitcoin. Its stash of 158,245 BTC is currently worth roughly $5.4 billion as of Tuesday morning.\n\nIn various tweets over the past month, the company\u2019s founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor, who stepped down as CEO in August 2022, has said of bitcoin that the asset is \"a flight to safety,\" \"digital energy,\" \"for the kids,\" \"power,\" and \"forever.\"\n\nUpdated 10/25 with DTCC comments.\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking and crypto.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "content": "The global Bitcoin mining network is highly dependent on fossil fuels, having worrying impacts on water and land in addition to a significant carbon footprint, warns the new UN assessment.\n\nHamilton, Canada: The extraordinary rise in cryptocurrency prices over the previous decade has prompted huge investments in the cryptocurrency sector. Undeniably, digital currencies have won the faith of the world's top investors, ranging from large corporations and tech millionaires to criminals, money launderers, and sanction busters.\n\nThanks to blockchain and other technological breakthroughs, digital currencies now constitute an advanced element of the world\u2019s modern financial system. They are said to even have the potential to crush the world\u2019s strongest currencies.\n\nThe surge in the crypto market is comparable to the gold rush. Yet, this exciting market has a hidden dark side. Mining cryptocurrencies can have major environmental impacts on climate, water, and land, according to new research by United Nations scientists.\n\nBitcoin is the most renowned and popular cryptocurrency. This motivated the UN scientists to evaluate the environmental impacts of Bitcoin across the world by looking at the activities of 76 Bitcoin mining nations during the 2020\u20132021 period. The results are shocking. In addition to a substantial carbon footprint, global Bitcoin mining activities have significant water and land footprints.\n\n\u201cTechnological innovations are often associated with unintended consequences and Bitcoin is no exception,\u201d said Professor Kaveh Madani, the Director of the United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health (UNU-INWEH), who led this study. \u201cOur findings should not discourage the use of digital currencies. Instead, they should encourage us to invest in regulatory interventions and technological advancements that improve the efficiency of the global financial system without harming the environment.\u201d\n\nAccording to study results, published by the United Nations University and Earth\u2019s Future journal, during the 2020\u20132021 period, the global Bitcoin mining network consumed 173.42 Terawatt hours of electricity. This means that if Bitcoin were a country, its energy consumption would have ranked 27th in the world, ahead of a country like Pakistan, with a population of over 230 million people. The resulting carbon footprint was equivalent to that of burning 84 billion pounds of coal or operating 190 natural gas-fired power plants. To offset this footprint, 3.9 billion trees should be planted, covering an area almost equal to the area of the Netherlands, Switzerland, or Denmark or 7% of the Amazon rainforest.\n\nDuring this time period, Bitcoin's water footprint was similar to the amount of water required to fill over 660,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools, enough to meet the current domestic water needs of more than 300 million people in rural sub-Saharan Africa. The land footprint of worldwide Bitcoin mining activities during this period was 1.4 times the area of Los Angeles.\n\nThe UN scientists report that Bitcoin mining heavily relies on fossil energy sources, with coal accounting for 45% of Bitcoin's energy supply mix, followed by natural gas (21%). Hydropower, a renewable energy source with significant water and environmental impacts, is the most important renewable source of energy of the Bitcoin mining network, satisfying 16% of its electricity demand. Nuclear energy has a considerable share of 9% in Bitcoin\u2019s energy supply mix, whereas renewables such as solar and wind only provide 2% and 5% of the total electricity used by Bitcoin.\n\nChina, by a large margin, has been the biggest Bitcoin mining nation. To offset the carbon emissions from China's coal-intensive Bitcoin mining operations in 2021\u20132022, about 2 billion trees should be planted, covering an area equivalent to the sum of Portugal and Ireland or 45,000 times the area of Central Park in New York City. Aside from China, the world\u2019s top 10 Bitcoin mining nations in 2020\u20132021 included the United States, Kazakhstan, Russia, Malaysia, Canada, Germany, Iran, Ireland, and Singapore.\n\n\u201cBecause countries use different sources of energy to generate electricity, their electricity production impacts on climate, water, and land are not the same,\u201d said Dr. Sanaz Chamanara, the lead author of the study and an Environmental, Social and Governance (EGS) Research Fellow at UNU-INWEH. \u201cThe rankings of countries in terms of the environmental impacts of their Bitcoin operations change depending on which environmental footprint is considered.\u201d\n\nNorway, Sweden, Thailand, and the United Kingdom are among the countries that make it to the top 10 list when the water or land footprint of their Bitcoin mining activities is taken into account. Together, the top 10 Bitcoin mining countries in terms of environmental footprint are responsible for 92\u201394% of Bitcoin\u2019s global carbon, water, and land footprints.\n\nThe UN scientists make a range of recommendations regarding possible interventions by the governments to monitor and mitigate the environmental impacts of cryptocurrencies. They also suggest investment in other types of digital currencies that are more efficient in terms of energy use and less harmful to the environment. The investigation also calls for attention to the transboundary and transgenerational impacts of mining cryptocurrencies. \u201cWhen you note which groups are currently benefiting from mining Bitcoin and which nations and generations will suffer the most from its environmental consequences, you can\u2019t stop thinking about the inequity and injustice implications of the unregulated digital currency sector,\u201d said Madani.\n\nRead the paper, summarizing the main findings of the study: Chamanara, S., Ghaffarizadeh, S.

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s rally above $35,000 is pushing higher the shares of several crypto-related firms, with investor optimism increasing alongside the likely approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nBitcoin mining stocks led the gains on Tuesday morning, with Marathon Digital Holdings and Riot Platforms up 18% and 15%, respectively. Shares of the largest U.S.-based crypto exchange, Coinbase, were up 15%, to about $89, while Bitcoin HODLer MicroStrategy was up 13%, at $427, just after the market opened Tuesday.\n\nTwo of the three major indices closed down on Monday, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which posted a decline of 0.6%, or 191 points, and the S&P 500, which fell 0.2%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 0.3%.\n\nThe surge in crypto-related stocks follows a downturn in 2022, which pushed some of them to the brink. After closing at $328 on its public debut in 2021, Coinbase\u2019s stock dropped to as low as $35 in 2022 as crypto prices slumped across the board.\n\nTuesday\u2019s rally comes as Bitcoin broke through the $35,000 level for the first time since 2022, before paring back gains, to about $34,400. The increase is a jump from its Monday performance when the cryptocurrency broke through the psychologically important level of $30,000. Bitcoin now makes up more than half of the overall crypto market, according to CoinGecko, thanks to a flurry of inflows over the past few days.\n\nOn Monday, a court of appeals made official Grayscale\u2019s victory over the agency in a lawsuit over the SEC\u2019s decision to deny the asset manager\u2019s bid to create a spot Bitcoin ETF in 2022. The agency has yet to officially approve Grayscale\u2019s application.\n\nOther TradFi heavyweights such as BlackRock and Fidelity have also filed applications to create a spot Bitcoin ETF, which gives investors more direct exposure to the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency.\n\nOn Monday, BlackRock took a step forward in preparing to offer the investment product by registering a ticker\u2014IBTC\u2014for its iShares Bitcoin Trust with the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, which provides clearing and settlement services to financial markets. An amendment to BlackRock\u2019s ETF application filed last week also showed that a seed investor could fund the investment vehicle as soon as this month, although that move doesn\u2019t necessarily correlate with when the spot Bitcoin ETF would begin trading."

        "title": "US Federal Government Holds Massive Bitcoin Stash Amidst Price Rocket - Nasdaq",
        "content": "New data shows how the federal government has accumulated billions of dollars worth of bitcoins over the years. As it plans and executes more sophisticated sales worth hundreds of millions, bitcoiners consider its influence as a major whale.\n\nBy Landon Manning\n\nFrom years of various seizures and confiscations, the U.S. government has become one of the world\u2019s largest holders of Bitcoin, with its 200k bitcoin worth more than $5 billion.\n\nThroughout the many years of Bitcoin\u2019s ascendancy into a worldwide phenomenon, its millions of supporters have had extremely diverse backgrounds and viewpoints, even as they have all been united in the pursuit of a worldwide decentralized currency. Among this cohort, naturally, there have been a few criminals. Even now in October 2023, new details are still coming to light about the prosecution of Bitcoin-related crimes that took place more than a decade ago. Jimmy Zhong, who was finally sentenced to prison this year, was convicted of stealing some 50k bitcoin from the now-defunct Silk Road in 2012. The government has long since confiscated his bitcoin, but many of them essentially remained frozen as the legal battle proceeded. Obviously, during a decade, this bitcoin has accumulated tremendous value.\n\nIt must be remembered, however, that this particular example is one of many, and a very early one at that. Over the years, it has come to light that the federal government has accumulated a massive stockpile of bitcoin, approximately 200,000. It seems that the presence of red tape has been a surprising aid in profit for the government\u2019s \u201cinvestment\u201d, as lengthy trials have only led to a complicated asset liquidation process. In short, it costs the government nothing to keep these bitcoin in the wallet of an incarcerated person, or else hold them directly, often for years at a time. All the while, growth for Bitcoin has been rocketing at unbelievable rates. Jared Koopman, executive director of the IRS\u2019s cyber and forensics services section, denied any deliberate strategy when he claimed to the Wall Street Journal that \u201cWe don\u2019t play the market. We basically are set by the timing in our process\u201d.\n\nThat may be the case so far, but the way that the government has sought to profit off of this bitcoin has grown more sophisticated over the years. For example, federal agencies would initially sell these coins at an auction to interested buyers, selling confiscated coins tens of thousands at a time in 2014. However, since a pilot attempt by the Marshals Service in 2021, they have switched to directly selling on exchanges. Even as the government paid service fees that were derided as extortionary, it has still netted hundreds of millions from its repeated sales, with no sign of stopping. In a particular irony, one federal agency can even use an exchange to sell off these assets, while a different agency can open a lawsuit against it soon after! If this dynamic was abused, it could create a tidy revenue stream.\n\nIt\u2019s in this light that the bitcoin community has been asking itself one question: What happens if the US government enters the space in a more major way? Obviously, federal agencies have no interest in practically adopting a currency that is in any way free of state control. El Salvador famously is the only world nation to accept bitcoin as legal tender, and part of the motivation for this move was explicitly to undermine the hegemony of the dollar. Although the United States may not believe in the mission of Bitcoin, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that it is currently one of the largest whales in existence. And whales, historically, have had a tremendous impact on bitcoin\u2019s price fluctuations.\n\nJust consider the state of the markets today, and a simple thought experiment. What would it look like if the federal government started acting more deliberately like a Bitcoin whale, maximizing its gains and attempting directly to influence the price of its assets? By making its liquidation process more sophisticated, it has already made the first step in becoming a robust bitcoin-selling machine. And the market these days is active and volatile, full of opportunities to act. For example, as bitcoin miners worldwide have been preparing for the next halving, Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate has been exploding for more than a year. Even now, it continues to reach new heights of productivity.\n\nSource\n\nAll these miners have been preparing for the halving, consolidating and modernizing their equipment and facilities while even preparing political efforts. And in this ecosystem, the government has planned to sell off assets worth hundreds of billions. How many individuals controlling these sales would really be necessary to take some deliberate action? How difficult would it really be, when the halving sends shockwaves through the entire space, for a federal agency to make a few big sales that cause a crisis of confidence? Even if it sells at a loss relative to 2024\u2019s prices, these will dwarf the massive gains these assets have gained over the years. More to the point, the government has sat on these assets for years at a time! A prolonged bear market could push firms all over the world to the absolute brink, and federal agencies already are fighting legal battles against some of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchanges. If assets were seized in the middle of a bigger collapse, the government could sit on them for years, and see astronomical gains.\n\nThe government would also have options to see the continued rise of Bitcoin in the immediate future, too. In the prolonged fight to win regulatory approval for a Bitcoin ETF, the community is generally convinced that the victory is close at hand. The SEC\u2019s arguments against the ETF have failed to convince the U.S. Court of Appeals, and the markets have been salivating. The mere rumor of regulatory success has led bitcoin to appreciate several thousand dollars in value in a few days, and the actual approval will be an explosion. What would happen if these approvals became more common? It wouldn\u2019t take a true Bitcoiner, only someone convinced that a growing industry will help America. A few years ago, it was unimaginable that those seized assets would be worth billions some day. What could we imagine for the future?\n\nThe purpose of this hypothetical has not been to seriously make the case that a massive reorientation towards Bitcoin will take place. Even if the value of this bitcoin hoard were doubled, ten billion dollars is small change compared to the U.S.\u2019 GDP of $23 trillion. However, anyone in this space should appreciate the sheer power that exists when the buying and selling power of a whale is combined with the power to materially put a thumb on the scale. How many people would it really take? If someone with power at one of these federal agencies wished to carry out a deliberate plan, how hard would it really be? Even if a functionary earns the same salary whether the bitcoin sell at a high price or a low, they would certainly be interested in winning as many cases against \u201ccrypto criminals\u201d as possible. And all those criminals would see their assets added to the pile.\n\nIn short, the main concern is that the existence of sums of money like this is an organizing principle all in itself. The federal government holds massive power, when considering its ability to wage war or impact global trade. But the economic stakes of Bitcoin hold huge power as well, the power to sway people at all levels of these bureaucracies. For a normal whale, selling hundreds of millions would be a very dramatic event, intended to ripple out across the whole space. But for this particular whale, it\u2019s only a scheduled liquidation in a long backlog of government property. It would only take a little pushing to make ripples of their own. Nobody involved would have to truly believe in replacing the dollar, or a trustless world economy. They\u2019d just have to understand that the rise of Bitcoin, so far, has been very good for business.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "What Are the Biggest Factors Driving Bitcoin Adoption? - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Few inventions in finance have created as much talk and excitement as Bitcoin. This cryptocurrency has evolved from a tiny digital experiment to a global financial phenomenon since its launch in 2009. However, many people are wondering whether Bitcoin will ever overtake fiat currencies or if crypto itself will be relegated to niche use.\n\nBitcoin's Perception as a Store of Value\n\nThe perception of Bitcoin as a store of value is one of the most important elements driving its adoption. Unlike traditional fiat currencies, which are susceptible to inflation as a result of central bank policy, Bitcoin has a fixed supply limit of 21 million coins. This scarcity is intended to maintain Bitcoin's value and shield it from the devaluation that can occur with fiat currencies. Individuals and organizations have turned to Bitcoin as a hedge against currency depreciation as concerns about inflation have intensified, particularly in the aftermath of economic uncertainty.\n\nInstitutional Investment\n\nInstitutional investment has been essential in propelling Bitcoin adoption to new heights. Bitcoin is gradually being recognized as an asset class worthy of investment by major corporations, hedge funds, and asset managers. This shift in attitude has resulted in significant capital inflows into the cryptocurrency industry. Several factors have fueled institutional interest in Bitcoin, including the desire for portfolio diversification, the potential for high returns, and the rising acceptance of Bitcoin as a real store of value.\n\nGrowing acceptability and Integration\n\nAs Bitcoin has progressed from obscurity to widespread acceptability, it has been more integrated into the traditional financial system. Leading payment processors and financial institutions have started to provide Bitcoin-related services, making it easier for consumers to purchase, sell, and store Bitcoin. In addition, certain nations and regions have taken steps to establish regulatory clarity for cryptocurrencies, creating a more favorable atmosphere for Bitcoin adoption.\n\nKeep Reading TradingView Enhances DeFi Tools on Polygon via QuickSwap Partnership\n\nTechnological advances\n\nTechnological advances inside the crypto ecosystem have also aided Bitcoin acceptance. Individuals and institutions can now connect with Bitcoin more easily because to the development of secure and user-friendly wallets, exchanges, and custody solutions. The introduction of Bitcoin-related financial products such as futures contracts and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has provided investors with new ways to obtain exposure to Bitcoin price changes.\n\nGlobal Economic instability\n\nGlobal economic instability, aggravated by events like as the COVID-19 epidemic and geopolitical conflicts, has prompted many people to seek alternative financial assets, such as Bitcoin. In times of crisis, the concept of a decentralized, borderless money that works independently of established financial institutions has proven increasingly intriguing. Furthermore, Bitcoin's capacity to conduct cross-border transactions without the use of intermediaries has established it as a crucial tool for individuals and enterprises navigating international financial issues.\n\nIncreased Accessibility\n\nThe rising accessibility of cryptocurrencies has also fueled Bitcoin acceptance. Individuals may now acquire, keep, and use Bitcoin more easily than ever before thanks to cryptocurrency exchanges, mobile apps, and peer-to-peer networks. The presence of Bitcoin ATMs in various places around the world has increased its accessibility. These devices enable customers to buy Bitcoin with cash, linking the digital and physical worlds.\n\nFear of Missing Out (FOMO)\n\nFOMO, or the fear of missing out, has played a psychological effect in pushing Bitcoin acceptance. With Bitcoin's price seeing substantial rallies and media attention, more people have been motivated to participate in order to avoid missing out on possible benefits. The FOMO phenomenon has been aided by social media, news coverage, and word-of-mouth debates. Many newbies to the cryptocurrency industry have been enticed by stories of early Bitcoin investors who became millionaires, which has fueled their desire to engage in the market.\n\nFinancial inclusivity\n\nAnother compelling aspect driving acceptance is Bitcoin's ability to foster financial inclusivity. Bitcoin provides an alternate means of making financial transactions in areas where traditional banking services are unavailable. Individuals who do not have access to traditional banks can participate in the global economy by using Bitcoin wallets and smartphones. Furthermore, Bitcoin-powered remittance businesses have made it possible for migrant workers to send money to their family back home. By lowering fees and enhancing efficiency, this use case has the potential to revolutionize the remittance sector.\n\nUse Case Evolution\n\nBitcoin's use cases have evolved beyond its status as a digital store of wealth. It has acquired adoption as a payment method by a variety of merchants and online platforms. Some businesses already accept Bitcoin in exchange for products and services, allowing consumers to immediately spend their holdings. Furthermore, the Lightning Network, a second-layer Bitcoin solution, has increased its scalability and speed, making it more ideal for everyday transactions. This advancement has increased the utility of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange.\n\nRegulatory Clarity and Compliance\n\nClearer regulatory frameworks and enhanced compliance initiatives have made Bitcoin adoption more steady. Cryptocurrency exchanges and businesses have made strides in conforming to anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) rules. The adoption of regulatory best practices has established trust in users and investors alike, lowering the notion of illegal behavior in the cryptocurrency market. Improved compliance procedures have also cleared the door for institutional adoption, as institutions feel more at ease participating in a regulated environment.\n\nBitcoin Adoption Obstacles\n\nWhile these factors have fueled Bitcoin adoption, obstacles remain. Price volatility is a worry, since large price swings can deter some consumers and companies from using Bitcoin as a payment method. Scalability concerns, as well as high transaction fees during times of network congestion, have sparked debate among the Bitcoin community. Furthermore, legislative developments and prospective changes in tax treatment may have an impact on Bitcoin's attractiveness to investors and consumers. In some regions, regulatory uncertainty may discourage firms from fully embracing cryptocurrency.\n\nHow the Spot Bitcoin ETF is Paving the Way for Crypto Mass Adoption\n\nThe cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation, and it's all thanks to the impending arrival of a spot market Bitcoin ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund). After years of legal battles and regulatory scrutiny, a spot market Bitcoin ETF is finally on the horizon, and it could be a game-changer for the entire industry.\n\nThis ETF represents a financial product that allows investors to access Bitcoin's spot market prices within traditional stock exchanges, offering a regulated and familiar investment avenue. While similar products already exist in Canada and Europe, they have remained out of reach for U.S. investors due to repeated SEC rejections.\n\nExcitement around the spot Bitcoin ETF stems from a recent U.S. Court of Appeals ruling, criticizing the SEC for approving a futures-based Bitcoin ETF while rejecting spot market-based applications. This development has reignited hopes that a spot market ETF may arrive in U.S. markets by year-end.\n\nThe implications are monumental. The ETF opens the door to mainstream cryptocurrency adoption, offering U.S. investors a regulated entry point into the market. This could drive substantial capital into the crypto space, propelling it to new heights.\n\nMoreover, the association of a spot Bitcoin ETF with financial giants like BlackRock has generated immense optimism. BlackRock's ETF submission alone caused a 20% Bitcoin price surge, underscoring the market's enthusiasm.\n\nWhile uncertainties remain about the SEC's stance, the current climate suggests a shift in favor of cryptocurrency adoption. The arrival of a spot market Bitcoin ETF may be the catalyst that drives crypto mass adoption.\n\nConclusion\n\nA convergence of variables has marked Bitcoin's journey from a whitepaper to a global phenomenon, including its role as a store of value, institutional adoption, technological developments, and global economic dynamics. While obstacles exist, Bitcoin's adoption is increasing, and its integration into the larger financial ecosystem is set to advance further. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem matures, it will be critical to track how these factors influence Bitcoin adoption and the broader financial industry. The continual interaction of technology innovation, legal advancements, and economic pressures will undoubtedly shape the trajectory of Bitcoin's adoption in the next years."

After a false report spread on Twitter Oct. 16 that the iShares ETF was approved, the price of Bitcoin spiked about 10% before coming back down once BlackRock confirmed the report was false.\n\nStory continues\n\nContact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2023 etf.com.

        "title": "What a spot bitcoin ETF could mean for the future of crypto - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has jumped past $33,000, driven by enthusiastic sentiment for SEC approval of a spot bitcoin ETF. Several major investment firms have already filed for those ETFs, including BlackRock (BLK) and Invesco (IVZ). The question now becomes what the timeline for approval looks like and what will happen after those ETFs are approved.\n\nSwan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten joins Yahoo Finance to give his thoughts on those questions as well as give insight into the impact this will have on cryptocurrency markets at large.\n\nIn terms of what will happen once the ETFs are approved, Klippsten says \"the top-of-funnel for investor class is going to change from something that is contrary to bitcoin, which is all of the crypto scams and pump-and-dumps of the last six years, FTX and the like... Now you're going to see a new era where some of the most credible, some of the most well-funded, trust brands in the world are going to be shouting from the rooftops with tens, maybe hundreds of millions of dollars of marketing expense, just talking about bitcoin.\"\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJOSH LIPTON: And Cory, there's a lot of enthusiasm from crypto fans about the SEC possibly approving a spot bitcoin ETF. Bottom line, Cory, do you think the SEC is going to greenlight a spot bitcoin ETF? And if so, Corey, when do you think they make that decision? Is that this year? Is it early next year? What do you think the timeline could be?\n\nCORY KLIPPSTEN: I do think it's pretty much an inevitability that it's going to happen. And that will be a batch of them at about the same time. And then they'll compete it out to see who becomes who's the bitcoin version of the cues for S&P for instance. So that's what they'll be spending into, these big companies with their listings.\n\nAs far as timing, you know, I have been handicapping it as basically Q1. But it does seem like there is a smaller chance obviously of it happening sooner. I would place my bets on Q1, though.\n\nStory continues\n\nJULIE HYMAN: And Cory, what effect if and when these ETFs are approved? You know, it's not as just that it creates the product and people invest in it. But one would have to think that these big firms are going to be trying to push clients into these products. I mean, what kind of effect do you expect?\n\nCORY KLIPPSTEN: That's right. Yeah. The biggest effect of the ETFs is going to be that the top of funnel for the investor class is going to change from something that is contra-bitcoin, which is all of the crypto scams and pump and dumps of the last six years, FTX and the like and all these wannabe altcoins. That's generally what has gotten people into bitcoin because they've been able to print their own money and sell it with marketing and all this VC funding.\n\nAnd then it takes people a year or two often to wade through all of that false marketing noise and find out what really is the signal in the space, which is bitcoin and bitcoin only. And now you're going to see a new era, where some of the most credible, some of the most well-funded, some of the most trusted brands in the world are going to be shouting from the rooftops with tens and maybe hundreds of millions of dollars of marketing expense just talking about bitcoin and putting all of the bitcoin authors and podcasters and executives out there at conferences and encouraging them to go speak on to their companies and to the investing public.\n\nAnd that top of funnel is going to be talking about bitcoin. And that's going to get people through the early stages of their customer journey much, much, much faster toward understanding what bitcoin is and how different bitcoin is from the world of, quote unquote, \"crypto.\"\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Well, Cory, by the same token, I mean, the SBF trial is still going on. Do you think that there will be sort of a public overhang from not just that but some of the other frauds that there have been over the past couple of years and that it's going to take some time to overcome some of that institutional and individual reluctance perhaps linked to those incidents?\n\nCORY KLIPPSTEN: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, they had a dramatically negative effect on bitcoin in the last bull market, because they siphoned demand away with false promises and frankly just by stealing demand with fake yields and, you know, fake pump and dumps that were all sort of just Sam's fraud essentially, allegedly, but probably, certainly.\n\nSo you know, I think I think that we'll see a very different dynamic play out. And it'll be fascinating, because there have been so many people, you know, myself included that would assume that the percentage rises sort of bull cycle to bull cycle would continue to diminish. But if we truly were chopped at the knees with the last bitcoin bull market, which it certainly seems like we were-- a lot of demand truly was siphoned away by these scams. And most of them are gone, or at least the investing public understands much better after having it drummed into their head the difference between bitcoin and crypto scams over the last couple of years-- there's a very good chance that we see a pretty different-looking bull market the next time it really gets into swing for bitcoin."

        "title": "Will the SEC Finally Approve a Spot Bitcoin ETF? - Nasdaq",
        "content": "The price of Bitcoin today (^BTCUSD) rose more than +4% to a 3-1/4 month high on speculation the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may be close to approving the first U.S. exchange-traded-funds (ETFs) investing directly into spot Bitcoin. Asset managers BlackRock and Fidelity Investment are among the fund managers in the race to offer a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S., which could spark new inflows into the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe SEC has so far resisted approving spot Bitcoin ETFs, citing risks such as fraud and market manipulation. However, the SEC recently indicated that it won\u2019t appeal an August court ruling that may pave the way for the $18.4 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to convert to an ETF. Bloomberg Intelligence said, \u201capproval of a spot Bitcoin ETF looks inevitable\u201d and that several funds are likely to be given the green light, although the exact timing remains uncertain.\n\nBitcoin has rallied +87% this year, easily beating the 44% gain in the MarketVectorTM Digital Assets Index, a market cap-weighted index that tracks the performance of the 100 largest digital assets. According to CoinGecko, Bitcoin accounts for almost 50% of the $1.2 trillion digital asset market. Other cryptocurrencies are also moving higher, with Ethereum (^ETHUSD) up more than +4% today at a 3-week high. The \u201cCrypto is Now\u201d newsletter said, \u201cAs Bitcoin moves gather steam, traders are concerned the rest of the cryptocurrency market might follow,\u201d so traders are moving to covered short positions.\n\nIn addition to worries about liquidity and market manipulation, the SEC has expressed concern that Bitcoin\u2019s volatility might be too much for ordinary investors. Bitcoin\u2019s last three full-year returns were gains of +305% in 2020, up another +60% in 2021, followed by a loss of -64% in 2022. The SEC has also questioned whether funds would have the information necessary to adequately value tokens like Bitcoin, including whether they can validate who owns the underlying coins. SEC Chairman Gensler has said that the lack of regulatory oversight and surveillance in crypto markets has led to \u201cconcerns about the potential for fraud and manipulation.\u201d\n\nLong-term market investor confidence in Bitcoin appears to have improved recently. Data from intoTheBock shows a sizable increase in long-term Bitcoin holdings, as 80% of circulating Bitcoin has not been moved from investor digital wallets in the last six months. The continuous accumulation of Bitcoin is a positive factor behind the recent strength in cryptocurrency despite a series of turbulent market events.\n\nSome experts expect SEC approval of at least one spot Bitcoin ETF by the end of the year. However, uncertainty remains as there have been nearly 30 prior attempts by asset managers that failed to persuade the SEC to give them a chance to start a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nMore Stock Market News from Barchart\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Bitcoin on Monday was trading at over $30,700 in the international market. The most popular cryptocurrency saw a spike of 58 percent in the past one year, reinvigorating a hope that was fast eroding among the crypto investors worldwide.\n\nThe price is over 98 percent higher than the 52-week low of $15,480, and is within the kissing distance of the 52-week high of $31,809.\n\nFollowing the lead of bitcoins, other cryptocurrencies have risen significantly in the past few months. For instance, Ethereum traded at $1,674, over 50 percent higher than 52-week low of $1,072.\n\nView Full Image Bitcoin spiked 58% in the past one year\n\nRipple traded at $0.53, 72 percent higher than 52-week low of $0.3011. Solana traded at $29.53, over 2.5 times higher than the 52-week low of $8. Binance Coin traded at $221, significantly higher than the 52-week low of $202.9. And the list goes on.\n\nThere is no doubt that cryptocurrencies are infamous for extreme volatility. So, what is high today may be low tomorrow, and vice versa.\n\n\u201cShort-term price swings keep happening and getting carried away by upswings and grappling in fear during downturns does more harm than good to long-term investing. Having an education-first approach is an essential cornerstone for sustainable long-term wealth creation,\" says Rahul Pagidipati, CEO, ZebPay.\n\nWhy the spike?\n\nAmong several positive developments for cryptocurrencies, the key one is building of broader consensus among G20 nations about adopting the broader contours of regulatory framework proposed by Financial Stability Board (FSB) and IMF.\n\n\"A false report by a media house suggesting BlackRock\u2019s Spot BTC ETF approval led to an instant spike in BTC purchases soaring prices by $3k in 30 minutes, only to reverse the entire gains in the next half hour as more clarity emerged. However, since then, BTC has decoupled from other \u2018risk on\u2019 assets and has been inching towards $30k levels,\" says Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures.\n\n\u201cThe recent surge in Bitcoin prices appears to be fuelled by strategic efforts from individuals and organizations with vested interests, aiming to rekindle interest from both existing and potential participants in the adoption pyramid,\" says Gaurav Mehta, Co-Founder and CEO of Catax- Simple Crypto Taxes.\n\n\"Bitcoin as a crucial aspect in the emerging financial system has been recognised globally. It\u2019s only a matter of time before it not just becomes an investment option but also a transaction tool. We have witnessed high price fluctuations and volatility in the market before but with widespread adoption, the Crypto market will gain more legitimacy and trust,\" says Rajagopal Menon, Vice President of WazirX.\n\nThe Government of India last year imposed 30 percent capital gains tax and one percent TDS on crypto transactions, thus implicitly acknowledging the prevalence of trading in these assets. That was seen as a step towards a full-fledged regulatory framework for assets linked through blockchain.\n\nFocus on fundamentals\n\nThe industry insiders believe that this is seemingly a positive development and digital currencies are now coming of age, and the wild movements are gradually becoming a thing of the past. At the same time, they argue that not much must be deduced from the crypto\u2019s price movement, and investors should educate themselves first about the technology.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has always been and will continue to be an incredibly resilient asset with remarkable economic potential. Rather than timing the market and deciding the best time to invest, it is essential to focus on the fundamentals, conduct thorough due diligence, and invest based on one\u2019s financial goals,\" adds Zebpay\u2019s Rahul.\n\n\u201cUpon closer examination of the fundamentals, numerous crypto businesses are facing financial challenges, governments are intensifying regulatory measures, and from a technical standpoint, there are many alternative cryptocurrencies that outperform Bitcoin in terms of efficiency, speed, and environmental impact,\" adds Catax\u2019s Mehta.\n\nSo, it is advisable to apply the conventional rules of investing in cryptocurrencies as well, and one should focus on the fundamentals of blockchain technology before intending to invest instead of waiting for the next swing to take place.\n\nMilestone Alert!

Today\u2019s rally that took prices to a three-month high is not about spot Bitcoin ETF optimism but about a significant reversal in the dollar and 10-year Treasury yield. Bitcoin could continue to rally if investors continue expect risk appetite prefers risky assets over Treasuries. The key for Bitcoin won\u2019t just be positive ETF news but will require a peak in rates to be confidently priced in. There is still a risk that investors might prefer stocks versus cryptos. As long as the Fed is done with this hiking cycle and soft landing hopes remain, that should be a positive backdrop for Bitcoin.\n\nIf Bitcoin is able to rally above the $31,500 level, bullish momentum could support a rally towards the $35,700 region, which is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the collapse record highs ($68,772) to this cycle\u2019s low ($15,278).\n\nWhat would really get the crypto world going again is we start to new money become highly committed.

        "content": "Since Bitcoin\u2019s introduction in 2009, cryptocurrency has worked its way into mainstream conversations and consumer decision-making. The medium of exchange is now actively traded 24/7 and becoming more widely accepted as a payment form.\n\nBut is cryptocurrency right for your small business? Several serious considerations must be taken into account \u2013 both technical and pragmatic \u2013 before deciding to accept crypto as a form of payment from your customers. We\u2019ll weigh all the cryptocurrency factors small business owners should consider and examine how some blockchain startups are trying to push the space forward.\n\nDid You Know? Did you know According to Deloitte, 3 out of 4 retailers plan to accept cryptocurrency payments. Part of the motivation is helping their brand be perceived as cutting-edge \u2013 making crypto a tech trend that will influence marketing.\n\nWhat is cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency is a digital medium of exchange that relies on peer-to-peer blockchain technology. It\u2019s decentralized \u2013 no central bank or government regulates or backs crypto. Buyers transfer funds directly to sellers without the third parties traditionally used to process payments. \u201cCryptocurrencies cut out the middleman in a transaction,\u201d explained Chris Poelma, CEO and board director of PCS Software Inc. \u201cRather than store your money somewhere where you\u2019re dependent on an organization to safeguard it, you hold on to it through an encryption only you have a key to. As we hear more stories of data breaches and hackers becoming more sophisticated, cryptocurrencies sound more appealing to consumers looking for a safer way to do business.\u201d Small businesses might accept cryptocurrency for many reasons: It\u2019s at the forefront of financial technology.\n\nIt can attract customers who use crypto for all purchases.\n\nIt eliminates certain kinds of fraud. But is accepting cryptocurrency right for your business? Tip Tip Encryption is a digital form of cryptography. It uses mathematical algorithms to scramble messages; the sender\u2019s cipher or key is necessary for decoding the message.\n\nWhat are the benefits of accepting cryptocurrency? Compared to traditional point-of-sale (POS) systems, cryptocurrencies offer several primary benefits to consider. Cryptocurrency has lower transaction fees. The lack of a central intermediary dramatically reduces transaction fees. Small businesses that accept credit card payments often incur credit card processing fees of around $0.25 for each card swipe plus 2 percent to 4 percent of the transaction total. These costs add up, which is why smaller stores often have credit card purchase minimums on their POS systems. Accepting crypto can reduce these costs to less than 1 percent of the value of each transaction.\n\nThe lack of a central intermediary dramatically reduces transaction fees.

Cryptocurrency offers customer convenience. Accepting cryptocurrency offers customers additional ways to pay while providing an extra layer of protection for their information. Tip Tip Experience working with blockchain development and engineering is becoming an in-demand career skill, as is familiarity with cryptocurrency and digital ledgers.\n\nWhat are the risks of accepting cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency isn\u2019t without its downsides. Here are some of the risks of accepting cryptocurrency. 1. There are technical barriers to accepting cryptocurrency. Accepting cryptocurrency requires setting up a digital wallet on a digital currency exchange, which could be technically prohibitive for small business owners unfamiliar with the technology. Cryptocurrency is an information-dense field with a relatively steep learning curve, which can be a significant obstacle when you\u2019re also trying to run a business. \u201cAs it stands now, small businesses, in particular, would find it difficult to accept cryptocurrency,\u201d noted Serge Beck, CEO and founder of blockchain ecosystem company Optherium. \u201cAnd even without the technical obstacles, the volatility of crypto values still creates a disincentive for entrepreneurs to hold digital currencies.\u201d 2. Cryptocurrency can be volatile. Digital currency\u2019s highest risk is price volatility, which makes its value extremely unpredictable. For example, Bitcoin was first valued in pennies in 2009; it rose to more than $64,000 per coin in February 2021 before dropping down to less than $28,500 per coin in May 2023. \u201cYou will have to make some form of arrangement for translating your cryptocurrency back into your currency of record,\u201d advised Areiel Wolanow, managing director of consulting firm Finserv Experts. \u201cCryptocurrencies are volatile, [so] you will want to do this quickly and regularly.\u201d Using a merchant services company like BitPay or Coinbase helps insulate small businesses against that volatility by immediately exchanging digital currency for its cash value. Through these services, cryptocurrency payments are made in real time for the currency\u2019s current value. The only reason for a business to hold on to cryptocurrency would be as a speculative investment, Wolanow noted, but this essentially amounts to gambling with your revenue stream. Did You Know? Did you know While many speculate that digital payments like crypto will usher in a cashless society, it\u2019s doubtful that digital transactions will become exclusive anytime soon. 3. Cryptocurrency has security issues. Although cryptocurrency transactions eliminate cyber threats like stolen credit card numbers, the currency still isn\u2019t 100 percent safe from cybersecurity threats. So far, there is no way to completely prevent cybercriminals from getting their hands on users\u2019 digital wallets. This is particularly dangerous because, unlike fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar and the euro, cryptocurrencies are not backed or insured. However, companies are working on measures to protect against cryptocurrency security issues, including the following: Some companies are insuring cryptocurrency. Some companies are working to insure and back crypto. For example, Coinbase holds less than 2 percent of customers\u2019 digital currency online; in the event of a breach, the company fully insures losses. All fiat currency maintained on Coinbase is subject to FDIC insurance up to $250,000, just like conventional banks. However, these protections don\u2019t apply if your personal wallet is hacked or affected by a data breach; it\u2019s still your responsibility to secure your personal account. Still, you can rest easy knowing that if the company suffers an attack, your funds are safe.\n\nSome companies are working to insure and back crypto.

Still, you can rest easy knowing that if the company suffers an attack, your funds are safe. Wallet security is being explored. Companies are also working on solutions to address wallet security. According to Beck, Optherium employs a biometric verification method that identifies users based on their facial structure to grant wallet access, significantly reducing a thief\u2019s ability to steal someone\u2019s assets. This method also helps users reconstitute their wallets when access is lost. However, some cryptocurrency wallets require only a password for access, and if you forget your password, there is no way to recover the wallet. You will lose your entire ledger. Tip Tip If your SMB plans to accept crypto, improve cybersecurity by enabling multifactor authentication, securing and maintaining your private keys, and considering taking your crypto offline by putting it in cold storage. 4. Cryptocurrency faces regulatory uncertainty. Cryptocurrency\u2019s regulatory landscape is poised to change as lawmakers craft new regulations. Once regulations are in place, they will likely evolve further, meaning business owners must be ready to adapt to changes in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. \u201cBecause cryptocurrencies are relatively new, there\u2019s much uncertainty around how the government will work out kinks in its regulation,\u201d Poelma explained. \u201c[Cryptocurrency] won\u2019t be universally accepted until businesses are certain they know how to report gains and pay proper taxes on cryptocurrency transactions.\u201d Changes in cryptocurrency regulation will likely continue as cryptocurrency\u2019s adoption expands and new problems and difficulties emerge. As there are no significant current regulations, crypto firms are moving abroad to establish trading desks while also working with the Securities and Exchange Commission to prevent flouting securities laws. Additionally, the IRS classifies cryptocurrency as \u201cproperty\u201d or a \u201cdigital asset,\u201d so anytime you sell or exchange crypto, it will be taxed. Key Takeaway Key takeaway Business owners who accept crypto should carefully monitor ever-changing local and state business regulations, particularly related to online business laws and data privacy regulations like the GDPR.\n\nHow do you accept cryptocurrency? If you decide to move forward and start accepting cryptocurrency, you must make some decisions and take a few steps. Overall, the process is similar to getting set up with a credit card processing company. First, you must decide whether to use a processor to accept payments or accept them manually. Payment processors: A processor will simplify the process; you must register with a company like BitPay or PayPal to start accepting payments.\n\nA processor will simplify the process; you must register with a company like BitPay or PayPal to start accepting payments. Manual crypto acceptance: Alternatively, you can accept cryptocurrency payments to your small business manually. However, the process is a bit more complicated. You must create an account on a crypto exchange (such as Coinbase) so customers have somewhere to send your payment. Then, you can add functionality to your website (like a QR code) so customers can send crypto to your exchange account. Finally, you must take steps to withdraw your crypto from your exchange account. You\u2019ll either move it to a digital wallet or exchange it for dollars and transfer the funds to your business bank account."

        "content": "Stocks rallied hard Tuesday as investors took in the latest round of corporate earnings. The buying power faded early afternoon but picked up again into the close as market participants looked ahead to quarterly results from several Big Tech firms.\n\nWhen the closing bell rang, the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.9% at 13,139, the S&P 500 had gained 0.7% to 4,247, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.6% higher at 33,141.\n\nCoca-Cola, Verizon pop after earnings\n\nIt's a busy week on the earnings front, with roughly 30% of S&P 500 companies reporting. Today's headlines centered around results from several blue chip stocks. Coca-Cola (KO), for one, jumped 2.9% after the beverage company reported higher-than-expected third-quarter earnings of 74 cents per share on revenue of $11.9 billion. The company also raised its full-year guidance.\n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance Be a smarter, better informed investor.

The company's revenue growth showed little signs of stopping in Q3, thanks in part to strong demand in Latin America, Nelson adds.\n\nVerizon Communications (VZ) was another stock popping post-earnings, with shares jumping 9.3% after the telecommunications firm reported a third-quarter earnings beat. Revenue of $33.3 billion matched estimates, while the company also raised its full-year free cash flow forecast by $1 billion to more than $18 billion.\n\nNext up on the earnings calendar are Alphabet (GOOGL, +1.7%) and Microsoft (MSFT, +0.4%) \u2013 both of which reported higher-than-expected earnings after tonight's close. Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META, -0.5%) reports tomorrow night, while results from e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN, +1.6%) are due after Thursday's close.\n\nBitcoin price pops on ETF chatter\n\nBitcoin was a big mover too. The cryptocurrency ran up near $35,000 overnight, a level it hasn't seen since May 2022, on news asset management giant BlackRock listed its iShares Bitcoin Trust with the ticker IBTC on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC). This sparked excitement that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is on the cusp of approving the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\n\"Bitcoin has stormed higher again on Tuesday continuing its blockbuster start to the week on the back of more ETF chat,\" says Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA . \"There's clearly a lot of excitement about the prospect of a Bitcoin spot ETF, as is evident by such a surge on speculation of something that was already expected to eventually get over the line.\"\n\nHowever, subsequent reports indicated that the listing for the iShares Bitcoin Trust had been removed from the DTCC website. This brought Bitcoin slightly off its earlier highs, with the digital asset last seen up 7.8% at $33,804. (Bitcoin markets don't close; price taken at 4 pm Eastern.) Still, the price of Bitcoin is up 25% since the start of the month.\n\nFlash PMI data comes in strong\n\nOn the economic front, data from S&P Global showed its flash manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) and flash services PMI were both higher in October vs September, with the latter surpassing the 50 level that marks expansion for the first time since April.\n\n\"Hopes of a soft landing for the U.S. economy will be encouraged by the improved situation seen in October,\" said Chris Williamson , chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, in the report . Still, Williamson warns that ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East \"post downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation, adding fresh uncertainty to the outlook.\""

        "content": "By Euronews with Reuters\n\nSpike comes amid speculation of an imminent bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBitcoin rose 6% on Tuesday to $35,100 (\u20ac33,100), its highest in nearly a year-and-a-half, on mounting speculation that an exchange-traded bitcoin fund is imminent.\n\nThe 10% surge on Monday gave bitcoin its best day in almost a year.

        "content": "Wall Street has had some big concerns about the stock market lately. A big move downward in major market benchmarks over the past several weeks has many investors wondering whether a new bear market might be just ahead.\n\nYet one long-struggling market appears to be getting itself back in shape. Cryptocurrencies have been down and out for quite a while as digital assets have gone through a fabled \"crypto winter.\" Now, though, major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC -2.41%) are seeing their prices climb back to their best levels in more than a year. That's also good news for the companies that rely on Bitcoin and its peers for their own success. Here's the latest on what's going on.\n\nBitcoin regains lost ground\n\nBitcoin made a major move higher Monday night and Tuesday morning. The value of Bitcoin is up nearly $4,000 in the past 24 hours, climbing 13% to around $34,675.\n\nMost of the excitement surrounding Bitcoin lately has come from efforts among institutional investors to provide an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that will invest in the cryptocurrency to ordinary investors. Currently, investment vehicles that allow investors to get exposure to Bitcoin futures are available. However, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulators have hesitated to allow ordinary investors to have access to a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe latest step forward came from BlackRock's proposed iShares Bitcoin Trust. The proposed ETF filed an amended Form S-1 registration statement with the SEC that suggested that its initial seed capital investor would purchase fund shares at some point during the month of October. That move led Bitcoin enthusiasts to speculate that the ETF would commence operations within the next week, in turn suggesting that BlackRock anticipates favorable action from regulators.\n\nIf BlackRock is successful, it's likely to spur other companies that have sought to bring their own Bitcoin ETFs to market to get more aggressive in their efforts as well. The net result could be increased demand for the cryptocurrency that could further boost its price.\n\nBig gains for crypto stocks\n\nExcitement about Bitcoin inevitably draws interest to stocks that are connected with cryptocurrencies. Several categories of cryptocurrency stocks performed well early Tuesday.\n\nCrypto exchange stocks were clear winners. Coinbase Global (COIN -7.36%) rose more than 7% in premarket trading early Tuesday, adding to gains of about 3.5% from Monday's trading session. Coinbase in particular has sought to be the standard-bearer for cryptocurrency trading, but the long crypto winter has caused it to suffer significant losses. Robinhood Markets, which offered cryptocurrency as part of a broader range of investment assets, picked up a more modest 2% in premarket trading.\n\nBitcoin mining stocks also moved higher. Marathon Digital Holdings looked poised for its second straight double-digit percentage move higher, climbing 13% in the premarket session following a similar rise on Monday. Riot Platforms posted a 12% advance, bringing its total two-day gain to 22%. The math for these stocks is simple: If the Bitcoin that their operations produce is worth more, it means more in profit for the companies and their shareholders.\n\nIt's noteworthy, though, that other crypto tokens largely underperformed Bitcoin. Ethereum, for instance, was up just 9%, and some smaller digital assets saw even smaller gains. That doesn't mean that those Bitcoin alternatives won't catch up at some point, but it shows that crypto investors are focused most closely on the first mover in the space right now."

        "title": "These 4 Bitcoin Miners Are Absolutely Skyrocketing Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "This past 24 hours have been incredible for investors in Bitcoin (BTC -2.41%). The world's largest cryptocurrency surged from around $30,000 per token to break the $35,000 level in early morning trading Tuesday. As of 12:30 p.m. ET, Bitcoin's price was hovering around the $34,000 level.\n\nThe crypto's surge appears to be tied to bullish sentiment building around the listing of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Blackrock's spot Bitcoin ETF product has reportedly been listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation database, under the ticker \"IBTC.\" This has led many investors to believe that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has already capitulated in its fight against the formation of such ETFs. And that has crypto bulls expecting that a wave of institutional investment into Bitcoin will follow.\n\nAll of this has had ripple effects for Bitcoin miners, which are seeing strong price appreciation Tuesday. Shares of Canaan (CAN -6.57%), Marathon Digital (MARA -10.40%), Cleanspark (CLSK -10.64%), and Riot Platforms (RIOT -8.01%) had surged by 12.3%, 10.5%, 9.5%, and 9.4%, respectively, over the past 24 hours as of 12:30 p.m. ET.\n\nInvestors are looking for ways to play Bitcoin's momentum\n\nThe launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF in and of itself isn't really significant, in that Bitcoin miners and other publicly traded vehicles already exist as options for investors looking to play Bitcoin's volatility either to the upside or the downside. Indeed, many who follow and invest in the crypto sector often look to Bitcoin mining stocks as a way to trade Bitcoin volatility. These equities generally have good liquidity and also provide higher beta than the token itself. (In other words, when Bitcoin moves in either direction, Bitcoin miners tend to make larger percentage moves.)\n\nThat said, the long-awaited debut of a spot Bitcoin ETF will be important, as it opens the door to what could be an absolute wave of institutional investment into crypto. A surge in open interest for the CME's Bitcoin product surged above 100,000 Bitcoin Tuesday for the first time ever (a notional value of roughly $3.4 billion). That's impressive, and signals just how much institutional capital has been waiting on the sidelines for the right vehicle through which to invest in crypto.\n\nWill the launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF diminish investors' interest in Bitcoin miners?\n\nOne question I've been pondering lately is whether a spot Bitcoin ETF could siphon off some investor demand for Bitcoin-adjacent stocks such as crypto miners, if investors (institutional or otherwise) view such an ETF as a more stable way to play the sector. I think this concept is directionally correct, though I do think Bitcoin mining stocks provide traders, speculators, and investors with another use case and purpose that's worth noting.\n\nSecuring the Bitcoin network and validating transactions on the blockchain is what Bitcoin miners do. One could argue that without these companies, Bitcoin's entire existence could be in jeopardy. Thus, with a Bitcoin halving event coming up next year, and other catalysts on the way that are expected to push Bitcoin's price higher, there are fundamental reasons for investors to hold these stocks, independent of a Bitcoin ETF launch.\n\nOverall, I think Bitcoin miners represent a unique option for investors looking to create a truly diversified portfolio. These higher-beta assets will tend to be much more volatile than crypto itself, though, and investors should be aware of this before jumping in. Tuesday's price action indicates just what investors can expect, and on rally days like this one, that means big gains."

        "content": "BTC is trading at its highest level since last May as researchers tip that the highly anticipated spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund from the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, may be seeded this month.\n\nOn Oct. 23, Scott Johnson, a finance lawyer, flagged that an updated BlackRock filing indicated the firm may move to seed its iShares Bitcoin Trust with cash this month. Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, said the filing indicates BlackRock expects to launch the fund in the near future.\n\n\u201cSeeding an ETF is when initial funding is provided\u2026 to purchase a few creation units (in this case bitcoin) in exchange for ETF shares which can be traded in [the] open market on day one,\u201d Balchunas tweeted. \u201cSeeding is typically not a lot of money, just enough to get [an] ETF going\u2026 the fact they doing it and disclosing it shows another step in the process of launching.\u201d\n\nBalchunas also noted that the ETF was also listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, which clears trades executed on the NASDAQ exchange. \u201cAgain all part of the process of bringing [an] ETF to market,\u201d he said.\n\nThe filing ignited feverish momentum in the markets, with Bitcoin rallying 15% in 24 hours to tag a local high of $35,000, according to CoinGecko. Other top ten cryptocurrencies are up by between 5% and 8% over the same period.\n\nBitcoin Surges To 17-Month High Amid Spot Bitcoin ETF Progress\n\nBullish Anticipation\n\nBlackRock filed its application for a spot Bitcoin ETF in June, prompting a rush of similar filings from rival asset issuers.\n\nWhile the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has approved futures-based Bitcoin ETFs in the past, such products invest in derivatives and thus do not impact the supply of BTC. By contrast, a spot ETF would invest in Bitcoin directly, driving scarcity for the asset\u2019s supply.\n\nSigns of progress towards the iSHARES Bitcoin Trust\u2019s launch helped to pull the markets out of a multi-month downtrend. The combined crypto market cap is now on the cusp of retesting April\u2019s year-to-date high of $1.28T after sitting at $1.03T last month.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast week, an inaccurate tweet from the crypto media outlet, Cointelegraph, falsely claiming BlackRock\u2019s ETF had received regulatory approval, sent Bitcoin flying 10% in an hour. However, the markets quickly gave back most of the gains when BlackRock rejected the tweet\u2019s claim shortly after.\n\nAnalysts at JPMorgan predicted the SEC will approve iSHARES Bitcoin Trust by January 10 \u2014 the deadline for its verdict on rival applications from Ark Invest and 21Shares.\n\nJPMorgan recently said the SEC\u2019s decision not to appeal a recent court ruling permitting Grayscale, a crypto asset manager, to convert its Bitcoin Trust into an ETF indicates a spot Bitcoin ETF approval is likely around the corner. Coinbase echoed the same sentiment in an Oct. 20 interview with CNBC.\n\nTraders are closing the gap between the price of BTC and shares in Gryscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust in response to the news, with GBTC shares trading an 11% discount relative to BTC \u2014 its lowest level in two years, according to Ycharts.\n\nBitcoin Surges To 17-Month High Amid Spot Bitcoin ETF Progress\n\nSEC Commissioner calls for Bitcoin ETF approval\n\nOn Monday, SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce told CNBC she is frustrated that her agency is still yet to approve a Bitcoin ETF thus far.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking we should approve one for the last five years, the logic for why we haven\u2019t has always mystified me,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cThe agency has not been very good when it comes to anything related to Bitcoin or other crypto assets. Every day I hope that they will wake up and they will think \u2018You know what, we need to take a more productive approach\u2019.\u201d\n\nPierce also cautioned investors against trying to predict the SEC\u2019s next move regarding a Bitcoin ETF, comparing the exercise to tea leaf fortune-telling.\n\n\u201cI can't say whether or not the commission is ready to approve a Bitcoin exchange-traded product,\u201d Pierce continued. \u201cThe [Grayscale] court case obviously is an important factor in the landscape, but I can\u2019t guess as to my colleagues\u2019 approach to this topic\u2026 Obviously, we are seeing more and more interest from firms in these products, and I hear a lot of interest from investors in these kinds of products as well.\u201d\n\nTo continue reading this as well as other DeFi and Web3 news, visit us at thedefiant.io"

        "content": "At last, bitcoin has broken out of a tight trading range, potentially heralding greater highs from here. After oscillating between $25,000 and $30,000 for most of the year, touching the top end several times and stepping out of it briefly at one point in July, the flagship cryptocurrency shot up to $35,000 late Monday . Bitcoin sat just below that threshold for much of the trading day Tuesday. Investors should expect higher lows and higher highs in the bitcoin price over the next few months, chart analysts say. \"The strong rise in the price of bitcoin is indicated by its daily relative strength index reaching above 80 for the first time since January,\" Ari Wald, a technical analyst at Oppenheimer, told CNBC. \"Although typically viewed as an overbought condition, it's also an indication that price is still accelerating.\" \"This characterizes a trend that should continue, rather than reverse, as it did in January 2023,\" he added. \"This doesn't mean that trend will continue in a straight line higher either, but it does indicate pullbacks should provide tactical opportunities for purchase, similar to the test of the 200-day average in March 2023.\" Wald said he's eyeing the 200-day moving average of $28,000 as a potential new support level while bitcoin runs into key retracement levels of its 2021-22 decline. Many chart analysts considered the previous support level to be about $25,000. If bitcoin can clear the $32,000 level, that would open the door for it to reach the $38,000 to $40,000 range, according to Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at BTIG. For Julius de Kempenaer, senior technical analyst at StockCharts.com, bitcoin's former resistance level of roughly $31,000 could now become support, with the next resistance level ranging as high as $47,000 to $48,000. \"All selling activity in the $31,000 area has now been exhausted, there is no supply left, and buyers are getting very aggressive, which is pushing the price up,\" de Kempenaer said. \"The tables have now turned, and risk/reward is getting back in favor of bitcoin.\" \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting."

        "content": "\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has issued an order requiring the Securities and Exchange Commission to reconsider Grayscale Investments\u2019 application to register a bitcoin exchange-traded fund with the New York Stock Exchange Arca, confirming the SEC\u2019s decision not to appeal the circuit court\u2019s August ruling in Grayscale v. SEC.\n\nIn August, the D.C. Circuit held that the SEC\u2019s denial was \u201carbitrary and capricious because the Commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar products.\u201d The similar products were two bitcoin futures ETFs that were listed, with the SEC\u2019s approval, on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one from Teucrium Trading and the other from Valkyrie Funds.\n\nThe decision held that the ETF proposed by Grayscale was a very similar product\u2014an ETF in the Bitcoin spot market\u2014to the two previously-approved products\u2014both ETFs in the futures market\u2014and that Grayscale\u2019s ETF had a manipulation surveillance agreement with the CME similar to the one the futures ETFs had. Therefore, the D.C. Circuit held, denying one and approving the others, absent further argument, was \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\nThe deadline for the SEC to appeal the August ruling was October 13, and the appeals court advanced a formal order on Monday to comply with the ruling.\n\nThe ruling has significant implications for 12 outstanding bitcoin exchange-traded products currently being considered by the SEC, managed by BlackRock, Fidelity Investment and VanEck.\n\nThe first deadlines for these ETFs are January 10, 2024, and they will likely be approved together, according to Michael Silberberg, head of investor relations at Alt Tab Capital, a crypto hedge fund: \u201cConsensus is that the SEC is going to approve these.\u201d\n\nSilberberg says the \u201cSEC has continued to not give clarity\u201d on \u201cwhich digital assets are commodities and which are securities,\u201d a complaint echoed by many supporters of the cryptocurrency industry in Congress.\n\nSEC Chairman Gary Gensler has rejected making a formal rule on the issue, instead saying that current laws are clear enough to take enforcement action. Gensler has indicated, while speaking in public settings, that he believes Bitcoin to be a commodity, not a security, though exchanges regulated by the SEC must still seek approval to list a bitcoin ETF. Specifically, Gensler has said that all cryptocurrencies are securities, except for Bitcoin and possibly Ethereum.\n\nThe rise of cryptocurrencies and digital assets, including Bitcoin, has raised still unanswered questions about which federal regulator, the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, should be the primary regulator. This case does not address that question.\n\nSilberberg says he expects \u201csmall allocations from large institutions into bitcoin.\u201d He argues that digital assets can be highly non-correlative with other assets and can be a useful hedge strategy that \u201cwould serve any portfolio.\u201d\n\nTags: Bitcoin, CME, Crypto, digital asset, NYSE, SEC"

        "title": "Why Is Bitcoin (BTC) Moving Up? | Markets Insider - Markets Insider",
        "content": "The recent rally in Bitcoin's price over the last week can be attributed to several factors:\n\nOptimism Around Bitcoin ETF Approval:\n\nThe cryptocurrency markets, especially Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), have experienced a boost due to optimism surrounding the potential approval of a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in the US\u200b.\n\nThe speculation around the Bitcoin ETF has been building up, with a notable instance on October 16th when a false news report regarding the approval of a Blackrock ETF led to a brief price jump.\n\nFinancial institutions are showing increased interest in providing access to Bitcoin investing to their clients through ETFs. The expectation of a fully-fledged Bitcoin ETF in the US has significantly ramped up, with several asset managers like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton filing for a Bitcoin spot ETF. Analysts believe that the approval of such ETFs could lead to a substantial inflow of capital into the Bitcoin market, potentially boosting its price significantly\u200b.\n\nStatements from Influential Figures:\n\nA CEO managing $9 trillion in assets mentioned that this rally is just the beginning, indicating a belief in continued capital flow into the cryptocurrency market, which can instill confidence among investors.\n\nTechnical Factors:\n\nThere was a mention of Bitcoin breaking through the $30,000 barrier for the first time since mid-August, which could be considered a technical breakout, possibly triggering buying activity from traders and investors following technical analysis strategies.\n\nFurther Speculation:\n\nAccording to a recent Cointelegraph article, the proposed iShares spot Bitcoin ETF by BlackRock has recently been registered on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), hinting at a possible nod from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. On Oct. 23, in a thread on X (previously known as Twitter), Bloomberg ETF specialist Eric Balchunas mentioned that the DTCC registration is a step forward in the journey of launching a crypto ETF. The iShares spot Bitcoin ETF, with a ticker identifier of IBTC, could potentially make its way to the Nasdaq stock exchange, following an application for listing and trading shares of this investment tool back in June.\n\nEric Balchunas stated: \u201cThis is [the] first spot ETF listed on DTCC, none of the others on there (yet),\u201d said Balchunas. \u201cDef notable BlackRock is leading charge on these logistics (seeding, ticker, dtcc) that tend to happen just prior to launch. Hard not to view this as them getting a signal that approval is certain/imminent.\u201d\n\nBalchunas theorized that BlackRock might have attained preliminary approval for the ETF listing from the SEC, or is orchestrating all prerequisites under that assumption. Given the timeline of BlackRock's submission, the SEC has a deadline of Jan. 10, 2024, to finalize their verdict on whether to approve or reject the ETF.\n\nUS Court Puts Pressure on The SEC:\n\nThe US Court's decision regarding Grayscale's bid for a spot Bitcoin ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) has indeed made a notable impact in the cryptocurrency sphere, especially on the price of Bitcoin. Here's a breakdown of the events and their implications:\n\nCourt's Ruling:\n\nOn Monday October 23, 2023, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals resolved a dispute between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Grayscale, ordering the SEC to reconsider its rejection of Grayscale's application to convert its Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF\u200b.\n\nThis ruling was celebrated as a significant win for Grayscale as it nudged the SEC to reevaluate its stance, which was deemed \"arbitrary and capricious\" in the initial rejection of Grayscale's attempt.\n\nImpact on Bitcoin Price:\n\nFollowing the court's mandate in August, Bitcoin's price briefly surged by 10%, showcasing a positive reaction from the market.\n\nOn a specific day post-ruling, Bitcoin's price spiked roughly 6%, reaching its highest level since August 17.\n\nThe legal tussle and its outcomes were closely watched by investors, as the SEC's initial rejection had led to a price dip of around 12%, pushing Bitcoin's price below $20,000. The optimistic outlook is that listing GBTC (Grayscale Bitcoin Trust) as an ETF could increase Bitcoin demand, thereby potentially boosting its price further\u200b.\n\nFuture Implications:\n\nThe court's decision not only bodes well for Grayscale but also sets a precedent for other asset management giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton, who have similar applications pending with the SEC.\n\nGrayscale expressed its readiness and eagerness to work constructively with the SEC to expedite the process of converting GBTC to an ETF, which reflects a positive stride towards mainstream acceptance and regulatory compliance in the crypto sector\u200b.\n\nShould You Buy Bitcoin Now?\n\nPlease read this 1st: I am not a financial advisor, and the information provided herein is purely for entertainment purposes.

Remember, investing and trading involve risks, and you should only invest money that you can afford to lose.\n\nConsidering the recent market dynamics, regulatory advancements, and technical factors surrounding Bitcoin (BTC), the potential decision to invest or trade in Bitcoin could vary greatly depending on individual risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals. Here's a comprehensive analysis based on the given facts and current market conditions:\n\nOpinion on Buying BTC Now:\n\nThe current atmosphere seems cautiously optimistic with the anticipation around Bitcoin ETF approval and positive technical breakouts. However, investing in Bitcoin remains a high-risk, high-reward venture due to its historical volatility and regulatory uncertainties.\n\nSupporting Arguments:\n\nRegulatory Progress: The recent court ruling favoring Grayscale's bid for a Bitcoin ETF is a positive sign, potentially paving the way for more institutional investment and broader acceptance. The optimism surrounding Bitcoin ETFs could lead to an influx of capital, which may drive the price higher.\n\nInfluential Statements: Prominent figures envisioning a bullish future for Bitcoin could instill confidence among investors.\n\nTechnical Breakout: Crossing the $30,000 mark might trigger buying activities from technical traders.\n\n\n\nHowever, unpredictability in regulatory decisions and market reactions can lead to significant price swings.\n\nAggressive Strategy:\n\nTrading: Entry Point: Buy BTC now anticipating further bullish momentum driven by ETF optimism and technical factors. Exit Point: Set a high target price for selling, perhaps near its previous all-time highs, or utilize trailing stop losses to capture gains while protecting downside. Risk Management: Allocate a portion of the portfolio to BTC but be ready for high volatility.\n\nInvesting: Long-Term Holding: Buy and hold BTC with a multi-year horizon expecting mainstream adoption to drive prices up substantially. Diversification: Diversify with other cryptocurrencies and traditional assets to mitigate risk.\n\n\n\nConservative Strategy:\n\nTrading: Entry Point: Await clearer regulatory clarity or a more stable price trend before entering. Exit Point: Set a modest profit target or a tight stop loss to manage risks. Risk Management: Only allocate a small portion of the portfolio to BTC and consider using options for downside protection.\n\nInvesting: Long-Term Holding: If buying, consider a long-term horizon but with a smaller portfolio allocation. Diversification: Broadly diversify across asset classes to mitigate the inherent risks of BTC.\n\n\n\nThe outlined strategies underline the importance of adept risk management, diversified asset allocation, and staying abreast of regulatory and market developments when navigating the intricate and volatile terrain of Bitcoin and broader cryptocurrency markets.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is in massive demand from institutional investors but awaits a spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval to trigger a buying rally, according to a blockchain executive at the professional services provider Ernst & Young (EY).\n\nEY\u2019s global blockchain leader Paul Brody believes that Bitcoin faces a lot of pent-up demand from institutions due to United States regulators not approving a spot Bitcoin ETF for years.\n\nBrody discussed the outlook for the cryptocurrency adoption on CNBC\u2019s Crypto Decrypted on Oct. 23, declaring that trillions of dollars in institutional money are waiting to enter Bitcoin once a BTC ETF is approved.\n\n\u201cBut any of these other institutional funds, they can\u2019t touch this stuff unless it\u2019s an ETF or some other kind of regulatory blessed activity,\u201d EY\u2019s blockchain expert said, adding:\n\n\u201cIf you look at people who are buying Bitcoin, they are buying it as an asset. They are not buying it as a payment tool. Those who are buying Ethereum, are buying it as a computing platform for business transactions and DeFi [decentralized finance] services.\u201d\n\nBrody\u2019s remarks come amid global investors closely watching the crypto regulatory process by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has not approved a single spot Bitcoin ETF so far. A number of companies, including Grayscale Investments, ARK Investment, BlackRock and Fidelity, have filed with the SEC for multiple Bitcoin ETF products and are awaiting a regulatory response.\n\nRelated: Grayscale files for new spot Bitcoin ETF on NYSE Arca\n\nGrayscale, which in August 2023 won an SEC lawsuit for a spot Bitcoin ETF review, has recently filed an S-3 form registration statement with the SEC to list its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust on the New York Stock Exchange Arca.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, a recent amendment to the spot Bitcoin ETF by ARK Invest and 21Shares is a \u201cgood sign\u201d of progress and impending approvals. The ETF expert believes that the ETF amendments filed in mid-October 2023 could be in direct response to concerns the SEC has asked ETF issuers to address.\n\nMagazine: Big Questions: Did the NSA create Bitcoin?"

Mining has massive water and land footprints as well, according to a new study that is the first to detail country-by-country environmental impacts of bitcoin mining. It serves as the foundation for a new United Nations (UN) report on bitcoin mining, also published today.\n\nThe study reveals how each country\u2019s mix of energy sources defines the environmental footprint of its bitcoin mining and highlights the top 10 countries for energy, carbon, water and land use. The work was published in Earth\u2019s Future, which publishes interdisciplinary research on the past, present and future of our planet and its inhabitants.\n\n\u201cA lot of our exciting new technologies have hidden costs we don\u2019t realize at the onset,\u201d said Kaveh Madani, a Director at United Nations University who led the new study. \u201cWe introduce something, it gets adopted, and only then do we realize that there are consequences.\u201d\n\nMadani and his co-authors used energy, carbon, water and land use data from 2020 to 2021 to calculate country-specific environmental impacts for 76 countries known to mine bitcoin. They focused on bitcoin because it\u2019s older, popular and more well-established/widely used than other cryptocurrencies.\n\nMadani said the results were \u201cvery interesting and very concerning,\u201d in part because demand is rising so quickly. But even with more energy-efficient mining approaches, if demand continues to grow, so too will mining\u2019s environmental footprints, he said.\n\nElectricity and carbon\n\nIf bitcoin mining were a country, it would be ranked 27th in energy use globally. Overall, bitcoin mining consumed about 173 terawatt hours of electricity in the two years from January 2020 to December 2021, about 60% more than the energy used for bitcoin mining in 2018-2019, the study found. Bitcoin mining emitted about 86 megatons of carbon, largely because of the dominance of fossil fuel-based energy in bitcoin-mining countries.\n\nThe environmental impact of bitcoin mining fluctuates along with energy supply and demand in a country. When energy is inexpensive, the profitability of mining bitcoin goes up. But when energy is expensive, the value of bitcoin must be high enough to make the cost of mining worth it to the miner, whether it\u2019s an individual, a company or a government.\n\nChina, the U.S. and Kazakhstan had the largest energy and carbon footprints in 2020-2021.\n\nWater\n\nGlobally, bitcoin mining used 1.65 million liters (about 426,000 gallons) of water in 2020-2021, enough to fill more than 660,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. China, the U.S. and Canada had the largest water footprints. Kazakhstan and Iran, which along with the U.S. and China have suffered from water shortages, were also in the top-10 list for water footprint.\n\n\u201cThese are very, very worrying numbers,\u201d Madani said. \u201cEven hydropower, which some countries consider a clean source of renewable energy, has a huge footprint.\u201d\n\nLand use\n\nThe study analyzed land use by considering the area of land affected to produce energy for mining. The land footprint of server farms is negligible, Kaveh said. The global land use footprint of bitcoin mining is 1,870 square kilometers (722 square miles), with China\u2019s footprint alone taking up 913 square kilometers (353 square miles). The U.S.\u2019 land footprint is 303 square kilometers (117 square miles), and likely growing while China\u2019s is shrinking.\n\nMost impacted countries\n\nChina and the United States, which have two of the largest economies and populations in the world, take the top two spots across all environmental factors. A mix of other countries make up the other 8 spots in the top 10. Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Iran and Thailand \u2014 countries to which servers are outsourced and, in some cases, where cryptocurrency mining is subsidized by the government \u2014 appear as well. Canada, Germany and Russia have some of the largest footprints across all categories. Each country engaged in large-scale bitcoin mining affects countries around the world by their carbon emissions, Kaveh noted.\n\nBut the benefits of bitcoin mining may not accrue to the country, or the individuals, doing the work. Cryptocurrency mining is an extractive and, by design, difficult to trace process, so geographic distribution of environmental impacts cannot be assumed to be a map of the biggest digital asset owners.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know exactly who is benefiting from this,\u201d Madani said. \u201cThe issue now is who is suffering from this.\u201d\n\nAlready, some countries have potentially seen their resources impacted by cryptocurrency mining. In 2021, Iran faced blackouts. The government blamed bitcoin mining for excessively draining hydropower during a drought and periodically banned the practice.\n\nChina in June 2021 banned bitcoin mining and transactions in the country; other countries, such as the U.S. and Kazakhstan, have taken up the slack and had their shares in bitcoin increase by 34% and 10%, respectively.\n\nMadani said the study is not meant to indict bitcoin or other cryptocurrency mining. \u201cWe\u2019re getting used to these technologies, and they have hidden costs we don\u2019t realize,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to inform people and industries about what these costs might be before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nNotes for journalists:\n\nThis study is published in Earth\u2019s Future, an open-access journal.

        "title": "Cryptocurrency Rally: Bitcoin and More Soar on New Hopes for ETF - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The weekend brought another rally to the cryptocurrency market as investors speculated that a Bitcoin (BTC -2.57%)exchange-traded fund (ETF) could be imminent. And if one ETF is approved, there could be a flood of investors moving into the market.\n\nValues are rising across the crypto industry, but the big names are advancing more than normal today. Bitcoin is up 5.6% from the market's close on Friday, Ethereum (ETH -3.18%) has gained 4.9%, Solana (SOL 5.80%) has gained 9.8%, and Dogecoin (DOGE 3.66%) has advanced 6.7%.\n\nCryptocurrencies rally on ETF hope\n\nNo Bitcoin ETF has been approved yet, but investors are positioning themselves for when that day comes. The theory is that an ETF will bring in new investors to crypto, including institutional investors who may not want to take on the custody risk of crypto but are interested in owning the assets.\n\nThere was a short period of time last week when investors thought a Blackrock Bitcoin ETF had been approved, and tokens jumped in value when that happened. This was more speculation than actual demand for Bitcoin, so the move didn't last.\n\nCoinbase pushes for more clarity\n\nThere's also a filing deadline of tomorrow for Coinbase (COIN -7.02%) to provide an answer to the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC's) rebuttal to the company's motion to get a major enforcement action dismissed. The SEC says Coinbase is selling securities, which the company disputes, and Coinbase is trying to get the case thrown out.\n\nIt's no coincidence that Coinbase would be the custodian for some of the ETFs that have been applied for. The company has some of the most advanced infrastructure in the crypto industry, and besides offering exchange solutions for institutions, it's also providing solutions for ETFs.\n\nIf the case is dismissed, it's hard to see how the SEC could continue to hold back Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency ETF applications.\n\nETF speculation brings volatility\n\nThe crypto industry is still searching for regulatory clarity in the U.S., and ETFs have become a proxy for the industry's current position with regulators. Based on the major financial institutions now applying for Bitcoin ETFs, it certainly seems likely they are confident they will get approval.\n\nIf the Bitcoin ETF is approved, the floodgates could open to other tokens. Ethereum, Solana, and even Dogecoin could see new investors, including institutions, investing in ETFs. The market may be speculating on these approvals, and that's what's driving prices today.\n\nI think the bigger impact of regulatory certainty would be increased investment in the crypto industry. The blockchain is fundamentally a technology that could drive new businesses and ways of performing contracts and storing information, but regulators need to ensure companies know what's legal and what isn't. That's why there's so much speculation on the current regulation.\n\nVolatility will continue to be commonplace in crypto until we know the certainty of both ETFs and the SEC's stance on major tokens. I think we are seeing the industry move to more approvals, but battles may need to go to court, and certainty could still be years away."

        "content": "MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin (BTC) holdings have turned profitable for the first time since July, now that BTC has broken through $30,000.\n\nMicroStrategy up $132 million in paper profits\n\nAs of Oct. 23, MicroStrategy held 158,245 BTC, worth $4.847 billion, up about $132 million from the original amount invested \u2014 with the Bitcoin purchased at an average cost of $29,870 per coin. In other words, the firm is now up at least $130 per coin.\n\nMicroStrategy Bitcoin holdings as of Oct. 23. Source: BlockchainCenter.Net\n\nMicroStrategy started buying Bitcoin in 2020 and ramped up purchases in 2023 as its price recovered from extreme losses resulting from the United States Federal Reserve\u2019s policy around interest rate hikes as well as high-profile crypto bankruptcies and implosions.\n\nIn September 2023, MicroStrategy acquired 5,444 BTC by raising an equivalent amount of capital, mirroring the approach that saw the firm buy approximately 12,333 BTC by raising funds earlier this year.\n\nMichael Saylor, the co-founder and chairman of MicroStrategy, shared data showing Bitcoin\u2019s outperformance versus traditional assets since the company adopted its cryptocurrency-buying strategy in August 2020.\n\nBitcoin vs. S&P 500, Nasdaq, gold, silver and bond returns since August 2020. Source: Michael Saylor/X\n\nWill Bitcoin price rise further into 2024?\n\nSince May 2022, Bitcoin has failed to establish a clear bullish momentum after crossing $30,000. This scenario may repeat in the coming weeks. This, in turn, risks pushing MicroStrategy\u2019s BTC investment below its average buying price once again.\n\nBTC/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nMore downside cues come from Bitcoin\u2019s daily relative strength index (RSI), now at its most overbought levels since January 2023. As a rule of technical analysis, an overbought RSI (above 70) could prompt BTC\u2019s price to drop or consolidate sideways.\n\nA correction scenario will see Bitcoin\u2019s price head toward its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave) near $27,720 in November, down about 10% from current levels.\n\nConversely, maintaining and confirming $30,000 as the new support level will open the door toward the next big resistance area at $32,000 \u2014 a level not seen since May 2022.\n\nRelated: How high can Bitcoin price go by 2024?\n\nFrom a fundamental perspective, the potential approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. serves as a strong bullish backdrop, according to CryptoQuant. It notes that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF could boost the Bitcoin market\u2019s net capitalization by $155 billion.\n\nCryptoQuant argues that if this happens, the price of Bitcoin could hit $50,000 to $73,000 in 2024, which would certainly become a boon for MicroStrategy. However, the firm says it will stay on its BTC course even if a Bitcoin ETF gets the green light.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Rallied Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The prices of several major cryptocurrencies jumped on Tuesday amid increased speculation over the imminent approval of the first spot Bitcoin (BTC -2.41%) exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As of the regular markets' close on Tuesday, Bitcoin was up more than 9%, Ethereum (ETH -2.96%) had gained nearly 7%, and Dogecoin (DOGE 3.64%) had risen 5.5%.\n\nFresh signs of the first spot Bitcoin ETF approvals\n\nLate Monday, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out on social media platform X that BlackRock's (BLK -2.09%) iShares Bitcoin Trust had been listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) website (the organization that clears all Nasdaq trades) with the planned ticker symbol IBTC. The news subsequently garnered so much attention that the DTCC website briefly crashed due to overwhelming traffic.\n\nIndeed, Tuesday's optimism followed a significant rally in cryptocurrency prices last week, which was spurred by the SEC's reported decision not to appeal a federal court's August reversal of its order preventing crypto asset manager Grayscale from converting its widely popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC -3.48%) into an ETF.\n\nSure enough, late Monday the D.C. Circuit of Appeals formalized Grayscale's court win over the SEC, indicating no appeal was filed and putting the onus back on the SEC to move forward with its approval process. The court described the SEC's order preventing Grayscale from converting its bitcoin trust into an ETF -- while simultaneously allowing bitcoin futures funds to launch -- \"arbitrary and capricious.\"\n\n\"This is pretty much checking every box that you need to check before you launch an ETF,\" Balchunas added, noting the timing of the ticker's appearance on the site was \"surprising\" considering any formal approval of a spot bitcoin ETF by the SEC was widely expected to happen sometime over the next several weeks.\n\nWhy the first Bitcoin ETFs are likely still several weeks away\n\nYou shouldn't hold your breath waiting for an imminent approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs. Eagle-eyed investors noticed early Tuesday that BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust was no longer present on the DTCC's list this morning -- a change Balchunas speculated may have happened after BlackRock was \"told to or want[ed] to wait until they are days, not weeks or months away\" from the SEC's formal approval.\n\nIt's hard to blame BlackRock, of course, for ensuring all the pieces are in place to move forward as soon as that approval hits the wires. For perspective, the SEC's final deadline to respond to BlackRock's application is March 15, 2024. According to a research report released last week by JPMorgan, however, the first approvals of spot Bitcoin ETFs will most likely arrive before January 10, 2024 -- the final deadline by which the SEC is required to respond to ARK Invest's open application for its \"21Shares\" bitcoin ETF. At that time -- rather than responding to individual applications separately over the course of several months -- the SEC will most likely approve multiple applications at once to level the playing field and prevent any single bitcoin ETF from gaining a so-called \"first-mover\" advantage.\n\nSo why is this a big deal for cryptocurrencies in general? Exchange-traded funds are a much more investor-friendly medium compared to creating separate investment accounts through cryptocurrency trading firms, enabling people to buy and sell shares throughout each trading day through any brokerage firm. Any approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF would significantly broaden investors' access to cryptocurrencies as a widely accepted asset class and source of portfolio diversification.\n\nAs a result, tens of billions of dollars of incremental liquidity would almost certainly flow into cryptocurrencies in short order, likely driving prices even higher in the near term. According to a report from data analytics firm CryptoQuant last week, the overall cryptocurrency market capitalization could ultimately increase by a total of more than $1 trillion after Bitcoin ETFs are approved and become mainstream.\n\nIn any case, it now seems a matter of if, not when we see the SEC finally give its stamp of approval to the first Bitcoin ETFs. Cryptocurrency investors are rightly enthused by the news."

        "content": "On this episode of the \u201cETF of the Week\u201d podcast Tom Lydon discussed the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) with Chuck Jaffe. The pair discussed several different topics regarding GBTC and its journey with the SEC to convert this trust into an ETF.\n\nChuck Jaffe: One fund on point for today and the expert to talk about it, welcome to the ETF of the Week. It\u2019s the ETF of the Week where we get the latest take from Tom Lydon, Vice Chairman at VettaFi, where they have everything you need to be a smart, savvy, sound investor in exchange traded funds. It\u2019s Vettafi.com, and Tom Lydon their vice chairman, well, he joins me every week with something that he sees happening and that he thinks you should know about in the ETF industry. Tom, great to chat with you again. Tom Lydon: Great to be back. Thanks, Chuck. Chuck Jaffe: Your ETF of the week is\u2026\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust\n\nTom Lydon: The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, ticker symbol GBTC. Chuck Jaffe: Wait, wait, wait. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, because ticker GBTC is not an ETF, so how can we have a not ETF for the first time in the history of the ETF of the week be the ETF of the week? Tom Lydon: It\u2019s an important day, Chuck, the first time that we\u2019re doing this, but there\u2019s a good story behind it where in fact this trust may turn out to be an ETF, fingers crossed. So let me give you a little bit of the backstory. Grayscale put GBTC together a while ago. Had at one point something like $7 billion. I think there\u2019s about $4 billion in this now, but it\u2019s not an ETF. It\u2019s a trust and it almost trades like a closed-end fund where you can actually have a premium or a discount on the underlying holdings. Bitcoin was out of favor. There was almost a 30% discount on this trust. So, with that complication and the fact that there was not a spot Bitcoin ETF, Grayscale put a lot of work together, applied to the SEC to convert this trust into a spot, Bitcoin ETF, and in fact was denied, even though there were futures-based Bitcoin strategies in ETFs out there.\n\nContent continues below advertisement\n\nSEC and Grayscale\n\nFast forward, they sued the SEC\u2026 Grayscale sued the SEC in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals and won, and the SEC had 45 days to appeal that decision and that deadline was last Friday, October 13th. They did not appeal. At the same time, there are almost 10 other ETF issuers out there that have put in applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs, and the SEC is having conversations with them. They\u2019re trying to understand a little bit more about how they would be put together. In some cases, there have been amendments to the applications, so there are ongoing discussions. The fact that the SEC did not appeal that decision means that they\u2019re going to have to get Grayscale on the phone. They\u2019re going to have to have discussions. They\u2019re going to have to talk about moving forward. And there\u2019s a good chance\u2026 Again, we don\u2019t have any inside information. Nobody from any of the ETF issuers or Grayscale have told us about any conversations with the SEC, but just by the path that we\u2019re going on, we may by the end of the year or early next year see a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nBitcoin ETFs and Ether ETFs\n\nChuck Jaffe: Now, we should point out there are Bitcoin ETFs and Ether ETFs now as well. We\u2019ve just had some expansion into some of the other cryptos, but they\u2019re not a spot bitcoin ETF or crypto ETF. And for anybody who\u2019s not familiar with the term or is not a hundred percent sure, spot is\u2026 That means they invest in the coin and they trade at the value of the currency. So a spot gold fund holds gold bars rather than say investing in gold miners or gold futures. To this point, any ETF that has been in cryptocurrency has been doing the future. So we\u2019re talking about GBTC. If it is allowed to convert, would it be therefore the first spot gold ETF? And if that\u2019s the case, conversion note, you mentioned that it\u2019s like a closed-end fund. We talk a lot on my show, Money Life about closed-end funds. People want to get stuff at discounts and want to have activist investors come in and go, \u201cMake that a traditional fund. Make that an open-ended fund.\u201d And at that point pops up to net asset value. So is there a little bit of a buying play here, arbitraging the SEC, where if you\u2019re buying this fund and the case goes through, it\u2019s going to start trading at net asset value and you capture the discount?\n\nIs There an Arbitrage Opportunity?\n\nTom Lydon: Well, you touched on a lot of things there, and you\u2019re right, Chuck, there may be an arbitrage opportunity at one point in time. Again, as I mentioned, there was over a 30% discount. That discount has been shrunk to 15%, but there\u2019s still a discount. But you\u2019re almost making a bet because if this does not go through, it will continue to trade at a discount or potentially a premium at one point in time. I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019m in a position to recommend that people take advantage of that. I think the biggest thing here, and the big story is the average investor and the average financial advisor may now with a spot Bitcoin ETF feel comfortable getting access to the crypto market because by buying an ETF, you\u2019re buying through a brokerage company and all the due diligence that\u2019s done. Again, there\u2019s never a guarantee that it\u2019s going to be a hundred percent safe. Obviously, the SEC has had its reservations as well, but we\u2019re surveying advisors every year with the folks over at Bitwise. Five years we\u2019ve had the survey, but still, only 29% of investment advisors feel comfortable that they have access to cryptocurrency for their clients. Now, we feel that if there is an approval of one or many spot Bitcoin ETFs, we\u2019re going to start to see advisors take maybe small allocations for their clients in their brokerage platforms, and a little bit for a lot of advisors who have a lot of clients, could actually be very favorable for the crypto markets.\n\nDifference Between a Spot ETF and a Futures-Based ETF\n\nChuck Jaffe: It could be. And it\u2019s important to note that the difference between a spot ETF and a futures-based ETF is that you could be a diehard crypto believer. If you own a futures-based ETF, you\u2019re going to get a lot of distortion in that price. In other words, the fund may go up or down based on what\u2019s happening to the price of Bitcoin, but futures funds trade in a much more volatile way, and they don\u2019t tend to track the thing that they are tied to the way a spot fund does. So, the bigger thing is it\u2019s a long-term investment. Tom Lydon: Yeah, I would say, Chuck, the good news is we have enough time where those futures-based Bitcoin strategies and ETH strategies have correlated pretty tightly. I mean, that\u2019s the reputation of those companies and those products. And if you actually have seen a lot of volatility or it doesn\u2019t correlate with the spot price, you\u2019re not going to get a lot of people investing in it. They have pressure to make sure that there\u2019s a very, very tight correlation between the spot price and the price within those futures-based strategies. But if we see a spot ETF, we\u2019re probably not going to see as much traction in those futures-based strategies.\n\nClosing Thoughts"

        "content": "Bitcoin Funds Saw $57M in Inflows as ETF Excitement Grows\n\nGlobal publicly traded crypto funds saw a significant increase in fresh capital of more than $61 million on Monday, comparable to more than 10% of this year's net deposits into such funds.\n\nThe majority of the assets, approximately $57 million, were channeled towards Bitcoin (BTC) investments, spurred by rising investor demand for a Bitcoin spot ETF in the United States. This comes as Bitcoin surged past $35,000 momentarily, for the first time since May last year. Excitement surrounding the potential approval of the ETFs likely triggered the spike, with BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin ticker reportedly listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC).\n\nThe biggest sources of these inflows were Germany and Canada, with Germany's ETC Group receiving $24.3 million and Canada's Purpose Investments receiving $10.9 million. In addition, 21Shares AG took about $11.8 million. Meanwhile, the United States Court of Appeals has directed the SEC to reconsider Grayscale's Bitcoin ETF application, heightening the competition among prominent firms hoping to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "They say time heals all wounds \u2013 not in Bitcoin.\n\nAs documented by Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo, tomorrow marks the 12th anniversary of a now-infamous tweet by Nick Allen back in 2011, one that demonstrates the remarkable growth and resilience of the cryptocurrency over the past decade.\n\nThe tweet in question, posted on October 25, 2011, by technologist Nick Allen, expressed disbelief at Bitcoin's value, which was \"down to $2.70 a pop.\" Allen went on to say he was \"so glad I didn't buy in on that mess.\"\n\nAt the time of the tweet, Bitcoin was trading at $2, and it's up some 1,600,000 percent since that date.\n\nFast forward to today, and Bitcoin's price has soared to nearly $35,000 per coin, marking a phenomenal increase from the days when it was valued in the single digits. Allen's tweet has since become a symbol of how the cryptocurrency has defied expectations and evolved into a mainstream asset class.\n\nAllen's responded to the post in 2021, at a time when Bitcoin was down from $60,000 all-time highs.\n\nNick Allen, who has an extensive background in the gaming and esports industry, may not have anticipated the extraordinary growth of Bitcoin when he posted his tweet, but the incredible price increase highlights the digital currency's journey and the increasing interest in cryptocurrencies as a legitimate investment vehicle.\n\nStill, as recent news stories show, Allen is not alone when it comes to believing Bitcoin is a fad whose best days are behind it. While some are excited about the potential approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF, there has been a continued barrage of news stories in the wake of the FTX trial that take a similar tone.\n\nIn this way, Allen's tweet may serve as a reminder that Bitcoin has a history of defying its doubters \u2013 and rewarding its investors.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Bitcoin is nearing $31,000 taking bullish cues from traditional rate sensitive assets like gold. What does this mean? So joining us now to discuss the crypto markets is three IQ President Chris Matta, welcome Chris, good morning, Jane morning Lawrence. Great to be back. Good to see you. So Bitcoin uh is up about 15% over the this October so far, October is almost to an end. Uh A lot of that is enthusiasm about what might come, namely a potential bunch of spot ETF S in Bitcoin. Um Do you, what, what are your short term uh expectations here? What what do you think is happening? Is the market uh a little too bullish for its own good. Uh No, I don't think so. I mean, obviously there's been an onslaught of regulatory concerns over the last year, you know, rightfully. So in many cases with, with the FT collapse DC G, but then also some things like XRP, obviously gray scale, I think a lot of these cases are still starting to come closer to completion, which is bringing more regulatory clarity, more comfort. It allows institutions to feel a little more comfortable about allocating to the ecosystem. And now that's happening at a, at a similar time when there might be regulated vehicles to actually allocate into, especially with the gray scale case going favorably. And it looks like the probability of Bitcoin Etfs getting approved is inching ever higher in the final months of the year. And Ether futures ETF has has recently got approved and it seems very likely considering the gray scale precedent that Ether Spot ETF S will also get approved um sometime next year. So I think these are all really great tailwinds um for the space over the next, you know, 12 to 24 months. So, uh let's talk interest rates here because interest rates are, are, well, it'll be uh it, it seems like we might get a little bit of a pause uh with Jerome Powell uh and, and the fed seeing the bond markets kind of doing its job for it uh in many ways, letting interest rates rise as the people sell off bonds, um particularly the, the far dated uh uh bonds here. So what exactly is happening then in the E market? How are, what's the interplay between interest rates and what's going on with E? Yeah, so it's been really interesting actually over the last, you know, 6 to 10 months, obviously, the, the DFI space has, has cooled off a bit. But uh on the Ether platform, there's been a huge surge in real world assets. Um mostly treasuries, but essentially, there's a handful of crypto entrepreneurs that have brought treasuries onto the ether network and other blockchains to make it more accessible for crypto native folks to get exposure to the heightened interest rates in stratify. And so we've actually seen billions of dollars now allocated to these, to these vehicles. And I think it's interesting because that had to happen during this bear cycle. But I think longer term, this will be a really pivotal moment for the space because more assets, more real world assets are coming on chain. Um And that's going to be a real tailwind for the space to be a crucial part of the capital markets, infrastructure as other asset classes potentially start to get brought on chain as well. And you kind of have this competing technology with uh maybe traditional markets and hopefully an integration over time, many uh stratify institutions are also looking at uh tokenized uh real world assets too. Um And so for us, you know, at three A Q, it's really interesting because we um we obviously have uh E three ETF in in other jurisdictions like in Canada, um which while the the US is still working through approving spot ETF S um Canada has been very forward thinking around um even pushing the envelope further our spot Ether ETF S are now the first in the world that are staking as well. So I think Ether with the the transition to proof of stake um passing through that staking yield to investors and having some of these natural demand use cases like real world assets. These are going to be tailwinds for, for investors to allocate over the next cycle. Jen likes those compliments to Canada. I always do, always got to get some nice Canadian compliments into this show. The regulators in Canada, I have been, I have been blown away by how progressive they've they've been around topics like this, like the complexities of staking and educating themselves and putting frameworks in place to allow asset managers to bring, um, you know, things like staking to market, especially when you, you know, put that alongside of other regulators like in the US where, where those even just spot ETF vehicles haven't been able to break through. So it's been great for crypto exchanges to um they've had uh uh uh infrastructure in place and rules in place to allow retail investors to stake. And now asset managers like three IQ are able to do the same thing while, you know, in the US, as you know, with the coin based litigation and uh a lot of the retail staking platforms have been shut down and, and obviously those aren't really available through regulated exchange traded products today. Chris maybe do a little bit of a comp compare and contrast for us. You talk, um you're speaking very highly of working with the regulators in Canada, but we saw a handful of exchanges leave Canada earlier this year because they said it was tough to work with regulators there. Tell us a little bit more about your experience. It sounds like you've had a better experience than some that we've heard about in the news. Yeah. Look, I'll say I've worked with global regulators all around the world. It's never easy. It's very costly. This initiative I'm talking about where we launched an ether staking ETF has been a year and a half in the making. So that's a long time, a lot of investment, legal, legal costs, and a lot of education and collaboration with the regulators to find structures that make that work. That said there is an inherent openness, I think from the Osce and other Canadian provincial regulators to understand, learn about the space and potentially put more rules in place. So when we finally came to the finish line, they published a series of rules for asset managers to ensure that they were taking the appropriate steps and understood the risks of something like staking. And they've done this in a whole variety of different areas but things like the appropriate due diligence and reporting requirements and risk disclosure and ensuring custody remains in cold storage. And there is dedicated validators. These are all very technical things, but the regulators were comfortable understanding learning these technicalities and making sure to put a fair rule set in to enable um asset regulated asset managers like ourselves to um to launch products. So I think it takes a certain type of a firm, a certain type of pedigree folks that come from, you know, tr that understand the regulatory framework to kind of work arm in arm and, and spend the time to, to the regulators and, and ultimately come down on a compromise with a, with a framework that works for everyone. You know, you, you, you, I kind of want to go back a little bit to interest rates here because you, you brought them up as almost tailwinds for the E market and, and for development. But how are they headwinds in the sense of higher interest rates making AAA higher hurdle rate for each staking and for returns. Can you explain a little bit more? Uh what do you think the long term impact will be when it comes to staking uh in the E market? Uh particularly uh what do you think the impact will be as rates either stay high, stay steady or go even higher potentially? Yeah, of course, I think all risk assets are, are obviously impacted by the, the elevated interest rates. And so when when investors are looking at their cost of capital and if they're evaluating ST or the E staking yields have decreased over time, since proof of stake has really ramped up. And that's mostly a result of the network coming up to scale. There's been a lot more validators at events of the network. So while it started um uh post uh post merge around, you know, 8% it slowly moved down closer to 4% and that will likely continue as more validators come onto the network. But to your point, if there is, you know, competing interest rates, especially even on chain through like some of these on chain treasury products that I mentioned, it may result in investors allocating capital towards, you know, treasuries or other high interest bearing assets. But I think in light of the broader kind of negative macro sentiment right now, you mentioned earlier, Lawrence, the budget budgetary pressures with with the multiple global conflicts, you know, rising interest rates and just general inflationary pressures. I think there's been a move towards assets like gold like like Bitcoin like Ether, I mean, we we heard Larry Fink's comments about flight to quality and and including Bitcoin in that statement. So I think that narrative will will hopefully keep some some positive momentum for crypto assets even though Ether staking yields may be declining over the long term. Chris, I want to come back to the three IQ Ether ETF, talk to us about the demand for staking in the ETF and how it's going to work. Yes. So it's really interesting in an ETF vehicle. There's this complexity around you have daily creations and redemptions and for those that may be a little more technical about staking staking. There is a bonding and un bonding period. So there's liquidity challenges. So these are all things that I mentioned before that we worked with the regulators. Obviously, our focus at three IQ is bridging that gap between traditional finance and the crypto space and making the asset class more accessible. So bundling in staking into a vehicle that you can create and redeem unlimited quantities on a daily basis. There's there's obviously operational and liquidity challenges with that, but we've optimized that we are, we are going to be ramping up staking to probably about 50% of the assets initially and hoping to increase that closer towards 100% over time as things like liquid staking um become more regulated and more liquid. We're able to pass through um the yield from that the the staking yield to the actual unit holders. Um It won't be passed out as a dividend, but it will accrue to the net asset value of the fund and essentially provide enhanced performance um for those investors. So it's, it's a really interesting um a time where investors that are that are buying e are now getting boosted performance over just the price of E but are actually getting that staking yield accruing to the net asset value of the fund. And, and like I said earlier, this is the first Ether ETF in the world. There are some exchange traded notes ens in Europe that have different staking components, but this is the first, you know, true exchange traded fund that, that has this and that's a distinction in counter party risk. But essentially, you know, the ETF is is fully segregated assets in the unit holders name. So there's a, there's a lower counter party risk threshold than some of the other vehicles globally. So it's a really, it's a really huge innovation. We're dropping our management fees to zero to promote the product obviously flows globally just generally into into crypto is is muted as Lawrence mentioned earlier, but you know, the best products get built during the bear markets. And as some of these market sentiments shift and there's more flows towards crypto. We're hoping to really capture that especially with really innovative products like staking integrated entire E three TF. Chris, congratulations on the launch of the new pro product and thanks for joining us this morning. It's always a pleasure. Thanks for having me talk soon. That was three IQ President Chris Matta."

        "content": "The battle for SocialFi supremacy continues to rage, and while Friendtech may have kicked off the latest boom, its position atop the sector is showing signs of weakening.\n\nOver the last two days, many prominent users, including NFT influencer Pranksy and Vombatus, a colourful figure whose key was formerly the most expensive on the platform, sold the majority of their assets on Friendtech and moved over to New Bitcoin City (NBC), another SocialFi platform that runs on a bespoke Layer 2 built atop the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nNBC has seen around $1M in inflows over the past day, pushing its total value locked (TVL) above $3M, according to DeFiLlama. Meanwhile, Friendtech has seen outflows of around $2M in the past two days.\n\nNew Bitcoin City TVL chart\n\nVombatus sold 176 of his own keys for over 850 ETH ($1.5M) without warning, dropping the price by 75%. While he retains 150 keys, the move triggered a cascade as other users sought to protect their portfolios from further drawdowns.\n\nFriendtech Hit By Selloff As SocialFi Whales Move To New Bitcoin City\n\nRise and Fall of (3,3)\n\nOver the past few weeks, the preferred strategy for farming Friendtech points has been to exchange keys with other users with an informal understanding not to sell each other\u2019s keys. This is referred to as (3,3) or (fren,fren).\n\nOnce popularized by OlympusDAO, the selloff over the past two days has again highlighted the flaws in the strategy, as whoever sells first often comes out ahead.\n\n\u201cIt appears that ETH was more important than any imaginary 3,3 reputation,\u201d NFT enthusiast Otto Suwen told The Defiant.\n\nLack Of Progress\n\nOthers blame the development team, led by Racer, for a lack of clarity on the future direction of the app and for taking too long to deliver seemingly simple features that would enhance the user experience.\n\n\u201cFT team can do a better job sharing their vision for the app so these moments are easier to bear for the ecosystem they're trying to create,\u201d wrote 0xbreadguy.\n\nPerhaps in response to community pressure, Racer posted an update on X, saying that the team will prioritize 'usability and fun,' after focusing on security over the past weeks.\n\nStory continues\n\nFriendtech Hit By Selloff As SocialFi Whales Move To New Bitcoin City\n\nThe Defiant reached out to some active Friendtech users seeking insights into the situation.\n\nMost aren\u2019t too concerned about the exodus to NBC but want to see new features and improved communication from the developers.\n\n\u201cTime to be decisive if you want to stay or leave, and act on that,\u201d said Lutherin, a self-proclaimed Friendtech addict.\n\n\u201cMany are using NBC as an excuse, they're leaving to chase the shitcoin pump,\u201d opined BigHead.\n\n\u201cThey are not here to farm the airdrop or create content, they are only interested in fees on their own keys. As soon as the volume drops, they move to a new fork and call everyone there. But they won't trap me,\u201d said retired Blur farmer minysmoral, when asked about prominent accounts abandoning the platform.\n\nCheesypouf echoed the sentiment. \u201cThey're moving because it offers the best chance for them to extract what they can from a somewhat new segment of buyers. That\u2019s all,\u201d he said.\n\nNot everyone is convinced, however.\n\n\u201cSome people downplaying it, but look at the major players either they're liquidating in mass or clearly trickle selling out - not something to ignore. Doesn't help that this app has been so buggy the last few days,\u201d said ozark.eth.\n\nDisclosure: The author has an active account on Friendtech.\n\nTo continue reading this as well as other DeFi and Web3 news, visit us at thedefiant.io"
