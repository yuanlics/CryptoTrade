        "title": "What Is Proof of Work (PoW) in Blockchain? - Bitcoin - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is Proof of Work (PoW)?\n\nProof of work (PoW) describes a consensus mechanism that requires a significant amount of computing effort from a network of devices. The concept was adapted digital tokens by Hal Finney in 2004 through the idea of \"reusable proof of work\" using the 160-bit secure hash algorithm 1 (SHA-1).\n\nFollowing its introduction in 2009, Bitcoin became the first widely adopted application of Finney's PoW idea (Finney was also the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction). Proof of work forms the basis of many other cryptocurrencies, allowing for secure consensus.\n\nKey Takeaways Proof of work (PoW) is a decentralized consensus mechanism that requires network members to expend effort in solving an encrypted hexadecimal number.\n\nProof of work is also called mining, in reference to receiving a reward for work done.\n\nProof of work allows for secure peer-to-peer transaction processing without needing a trusted third party.\n\nProof of work at scale requires vast amounts of energy, which only increases as more miners join the network.\n\nUnderstanding Proof of Work\n\nThis explanation will focus on proof of work as it functions in the Bitcoin network. Commonly called a cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is technically a token\u2014a representation of ownership of value on the Bitcoin blockchain. The ownership of the token can be exchanged for something of equal value, much like how you hand someone a dollar for a candy bar\u2014they now have the dollar and you have the candy bar.\n\nProof of Work Blockchains\n\nBlockchains are distributed ledgers that record all bitcoin transactions, similarly to how you would enter transactions in a spreadsheet. Each block is similar to a cell. Information such as transaction amounts, wallet addresses, time, and date are recorded and encrypted into a block header\u2014a hexadecimal number created through the blockchain's hashing function.\n\nThe hash from each block is used in the block that follows it when its hash is created. This creates a ledger of chained blocks that cannot be altered because the information from every block is included in the newest block's hash.\n\nHashes\n\nWhen a block is closed, the hash must be verified before a new block can be opened. This is where proof of work comes in. The hash is a 64-digit encrypted hexadecimal number. With modern technology, a hash can be generated in milliseconds for a large amount of data. However, miners try to guess that hash, which takes a very long time in computing terms.\n\nMining is the process of validating transactions by solving the hash and receiving a reward.\n\nNonce\n\nThe hash includes a series of numbers called the nonce, short for \"number used once.\" When a miner\u2014the program on a node that works to solve the hash\u2014begins mining, it generates a hash from publicly available information using a nonce equal to zero.\n\nSolving the Hash\n\nIf the hash is lower than the current network target, the miner has successfully solved the hash. The network target is a mathematical result of a formula converted to a hexadecimal number that dictates the mining difficulty.\n\nIf the hash is greater than the target, the mining program adds a value of 1 to the nonce and generates a hash again. The entire network of miners tries to solve the hash this way. On the Bitcoin blockchain, the miner that solves the hash is given the current reward for the work done.\n\nProof of Work vs. Proof of Stake\n\nThe two most popular consensus mechanisms are proof of work and proof of stake. Bitcoin's top competitor Ethereum used proof of work on its blockchain until September 2022, when the highly-anticipated transition to proof of stake was made. Here are some of the key differences between the two.\n\nProof of Work Validation is done by a network of miners\n\nBitcoin paid as a reward and for transaction fees\n\nCompetitive nature uses lots of energy and computational power Proof of Stake Validation is done by participants who offer ether as collateral\n\nEther is paid for transaction fees only\n\nLess computational power and energy used\n\nSpecial Considerations\n\nMining is a competitive process, so it has become a race between those with the most computational power. So, miners join pools to increase their chances of receiving a reward because it takes an enormous amount of computing work to be competitive.\n\nOn Feb. 9, 2023, the mining pool FoundryUSA accounted for nearly 32% of the Bitcoin network's three-day hashrate\u2014the number of hashes a network can perform per second. FoundryUSA hashed 89.81 exa hashes per second (EH/s)\u2014the pool generated nearly 90 quintillion (90 x 1018) hashes per second.\n\nSingle or individual PoW miners are not able to compete with pools for rewards.\n\nProof of work is also known for its energy consumption. The University of Cambridge tracks the Bitcoin network energy demand and uses a \"best guess estimate\" to determine its usage. The network uses as much energy as some small countries; however, it's important to note that industrial data networks and data centers use far more energy than the Bitcoin network.\n\nProof of work is also a much slower validation method than other mechanisms. For example, more transactions are taking place than the Bitcoin network can handle. Transactions are stored in a mempool waiting for validation, with average confirmation times between Jan. 1 and Feb. 9, 2023, ranged from seven to 91 minutes (confirmation is when your transaction is confirmed). Bitcoin keeps its block times at an average of 10 minutes\u2014compare this with block times on the Ethereum PoS network, which have averaged 12 seconds since September 2022.\n\nExample of Proof of Work\n\nProof of work requires a computer to randomly engage in hashing functions until it arrives at an output with the correct minimum amount of leading zeroes. For example, the hash for block #775,771, mined on Feb. 9, 2023, is:\n\n00000000000000000003aa2696b1b7248db53a5a7f72d1fd98916c761e954354\n\nThe block reward for that successful hash was 6.25 BTC and 0.1360 BTC in fees.\n\nThe nonce was 2,881,347,934, there were 1,519 transactions in the block, and the total value of the block was 1,665.9645 BTC. Remembering that a hash is generated and the nonce starts at zero, this block was hashed by a miner 2.8 billion times before reaching a number less than the target.\n\nWhat Does Proof of Work Mean? PoW requires nodes on a network to provide evidence that they have expended computational power (i.e., work) to achieve consensus in a decentralized manner and to prevent bad actors from overtaking the network.\n\nWhy Do Cryptocurrencies Need Proof of Work? Because they are decentralized and peer-to-peer by design, blockchains such as cryptocurrency networks require some way of achieving both consensus and security. Proof of work is one method that makes it too resource-intensive to overtake the network. Other proof mechanisms also exist that are less resource-intensive. Without a proof mechanism, the network and the data stored within it would be vulnerable to attack or theft.\n\nDoes Bitcoin Use Proof of Work? Yes. It uses a PoW algorithm based on the SHA-256 hashing function to validate and confirm transactions and issue new bitcoins.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nProof of work is a consensus mechanism used by many cryptocurrencies to validate transactions on their blockchains and award tokens for participating in the network. Proof of work is a competitive process that uses publicly available transaction information to attempt to generate a hexadecimal number less than the network target for that mining period. Under PoW consensus, thousands of mining programs work on one block until the hash is solved, then move to the next block.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (\u201cICOs\u201d) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

        "title": "Cryptocurrency's Myth of Anonymity - WIRED",
        "content": "Michael Calore: Wow. Well, let's take a quick break and we'll be right back.\n\n[Break]\n\nMichael Calore: The crypto market has been pretty wild lately. There's all the recent drama with Sam Bankman-Fried and the collapse of the FTX Exchange. There's the cratered market around NFTs, the rapid devaluation and erratic behavior of many of the currencies. Andy, have these recent instabilities in the cryptocurrency market at all slowed down the use of it on the dark web or in other illicit markets?\n\nAndy Greenberg: I don't think that they have, for the most part. The one big crime that has kind of slowed down because of the fall in the value of cryptocurrency is scamming, because scammers depend on people believing that their cryptocurrency is going to keep going up in value. But on the dark web, cryptocurrency is really just a means of transaction, and it doesn't really matter so much what it's worth. In fact, the fact that bitcoin appreciated massively from the time when I was buying marijuana on the Silk Road in 2013 really now just means that I spent tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bitcoins on a few grams of pot, which is unfortunate when you think about it. But the dark web is not the only place where these crimes that are now traced by the tracers who are the central detectives in my book are taking place. There are also just straight-up thefts that are a huge part of the dark side of the crypto world. When FTX collapsed, in the midst of that collapse, which was like a traditional finance story in a way\u2014an over-leveraged bank or something, or a Lehman Brothers or maybe like a Theranos story. But there's also a straight-up crime story here, where about half a billion dollars of FTX's funds were actually just stolen in the midst of its bankruptcy, and we don't know by whom still. The bizarre thing about the blockchain is that all of these tracers can watch this theft happen in real time. We can see these hundreds of millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency taken out of FTX and then moved around. They seem to be packaged to try to launder them. But because it's all so transparent and traceable, it's going to be very difficult for whoever took that money to cash it out or spend it or get away with this crime in a way where they won't be identified. So we'll probably soon know if the person who did that was some sort of inside embezzler or external hackers who were trying to take advantage of the chaos of FTX's meltdown.\n\nLauren Goode: Do you see a mainstream future for some of the more privacy-focused coins, like monero\u2014am I saying that correctly, monero?\u2014or will they be kept at arm's length by legitimate financial institutions?\n\nAndy Greenberg: It's really interesting to watch. I mean, monero is one that is being adopted. Monero, for the people who maybe haven't heard of it, it's not the most popular cryptocurrency by any means, but it is designed to be much less traceable than bitcoin and to tangle up its blockchain and obfuscate the amounts and make it hard to see who is sending money to whom. And monero is being adopted by dark web markets. One of the big stories in this book is the hunt for and the takedown of the kingpin of AlphaBay, which was this dark web market that became 10 times the size of the Silk Road. Now, years after AlphaBay was taken down, it actually reappeared in 2021, and now only accepts monero, which is a sign of the cat-and-mouse game, as Mike put it, that is occurring and the ways that people are starting to wise up to the traceability of bitcoin at least. But we see that cat-and-mouse game continuing because it does actually seem like sometimes monero, much to the surprise of all of these people using it, can sometimes be traced. monero people hate it when I point this out. In this big case that happened about a year ago where these two New Yorkers were arrested and accused of money laundering \u2026 You probably heard of this case because the woman in this couple had posted these terrible, super cringey rap videos on YouTube. $3.6 billion was seized from this couple, the biggest seizure of money of any kind in US criminal history. They had actually transferred some of that money into monero. Yet, you can see in court documents that the IRS criminal investigators, who were the central detectives in that case, continued to follow it and to identify them as the ones holding it. There's actually even leaked Chainalysis documents that appeared on the dark web that show that Chainalysis says to its law enforcement customers that it can trace monero in the majority of cases. So even when people, even now, believe that they're using a privacy coin, something that's less traceable, they're often still going to be surprised, I think, by how clever the tracers have become, how hard it is to use cryptocurrency anonymously. But I feel like I have to also mention that there is a newer cryptocurrency, zcash, that does seem to be truly untraceable, that uses these new, almost magical-seeming cryptography tricks called zero-knowledge proofs to basically fully encrypt its blockchain, so that there is no information for blockchain analysis or tracing of any kind. That may be finally the untraceable cryptocurrency that people believed bitcoin was. Yeah, as you say, Lauren, it's going to be really interesting to see if zcash is more adopted, and if it is, if it becomes this popular tool for crime or what people once called crypto-anarchy, carving out a space where you can't collect taxes, you can do any black market transaction you want, will that lead to some sort of regulatory backlash where regulators try to ban zcash or prevent exchanges from letting you buy and sell it?"

        "title": "Crypto Is Becoming More Correlated to Stocks \u2014 And It's Your Fault - Institutional Investor",
        "content": "Digital assets are losing their hedging benefit just as more institutional investors enter the crypto world. In fact, allocators may be the cause.\n\nThe correlation between the price of cryptocurrencies and the stock market has increased over time, according to a recent research study from Georgetown University. The study also found that crypto assets followed the market\u2019s lead even more closely during periods of high market volatility, such as the Covid pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMany individual investors, market watchers, and entrepreneurs have argued that crypto assets are a safe haven given their scarcity and independence from national governments. In recent years, however, cryptocurrencies have been moving in lockstep with stocks and some critics have raised questions about whether the asset class can continue to serve as \u201cdigital gold\u201d that protects investors during times of crises. The new study provides additional evidence that debunks the diversification benefit of crypto assets.\n\nThe paper\u2019s authors based their findings on a analysis of the correlation between the S&P 500 and the two biggest cryptocurrencies \u2014 Bitcoin and Ether \u2014 between January 2016 and July 2022. They found that the correlation \u2014 which measures the degree to which two financial securities or instruments move together \u2014 between Bitcoin and the index was 0.08 between January 2016 and January 2021. But the correlation between the two increased to 0.33 between February 2021 and July 2022, a period of relatively high volatility. The correlation between Ether and the S&P 500 also rose from 0.04 between 2016 and 2021 to 0.38 during the latter period. A correlation of 1 indicates the two instruments move together.\n\n\u201cThe recent increase in the correlation coefficient between the crypto asset market and the S&P 500 may reflect the increased participation of institutional investors,\u201d according to the paper.\n\nBitcoin and Ether have moved even more closely in line with the market when markets are rough \u2014 exactly the time when investors need assets to behave differently. When the coronavirus shut down global economies in March 2020, Bitcoin and Ether recorded a correlation with the S&P 500 of 0.47 and 0.5, respectively. At the time, gold only had a 0.04 correlation with the index. From February 2022 to July 2022, as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine escalated, Bitcoin and Ether had correlations of 0.58 and 0.59 with the market, while gold had a correlation of -0.12.\n\nThe authors also compared cryptocurrencies with gold during periods of high market volatility and high policy risk. When the VIX index \u2014 a popular measure of market volatility \u2014 rose above 25, Bitcoin and Ether had a correlation with the S&P 500 of 0.43 and 0.41, respectively, while gold had a near-zero correlation with the market. The same pattern is also reflected during periods when the U.S. Economic Policy Uncertainty Index rose above 300.\n\n\u201cGold\u2019s propensity as a hedging asset appears to be stronger during stressed periods, such as crypto winter, the Covid-19 shock, and during higher VIX periods,\u201d the authors concluded. \u201cOn the other hand, correlations between Bitcoin/Ether and the S&P500 are positive and significant during these periods. This implies that Bitcoin has become neither \u2018digital gold\u2019 nor a \u2018safe-haven asset\u2019 in times of crisis. Bitcoin may have rather acted as a risk-magnifying factor.\u201d"

The move adds to existing investor worries about macroeconomic trends, such as higher interest rates. Ether fell along with all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies.\n\nSee related article: Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong says SEC has \u2018terrible\u2019 idea to ban crypto staking for U.S. retail customers\n\nFast facts\n\nBitcoin fell 4.93% in the past 24 hours to US$21,815 at 8 a.m. in Hong Kong, and lost 7% over the past calendar week, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Ether dropped 6.32% to trade at US$1,547, logging a 5.86% weekly loss.\n\nSolana, the biggest loser among the top 10, slid 11.81% in the past 24 hours, pushing its weekly loss to 15.69%. Shiba Inu dipped 11.66% in the last 24 hours, reversing gains over the past week to remain little changed.\n\nOn Thursday, the U.S.-based crypto exchange Kraken said it shut its on-chain staking services for U.S. users to settle charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC said in a Thursday statement that two Kraken subsidiaries failed to register the offer and sale of their staking programs, and that the exchange had agreed to pay US$30 million to settle the charges.\n\nBrian Armstrong, chief executive officer of Coinbase Global Inc., the largest crypto exchange in the U.S., said on Wednesday that the SEC may be considering a broad ban on crypto staking for U.S. retail users, which he called a \u201cterrible\u201d idea.\n\nStaking refers to the process of crypto investors depositing tokens into certain blockchains to receive rewards, typically more tokens \u2014 a practice widely used on various \u201cproof-of-stake\u201d blockchains including Ethereum, the second biggest.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s action should make clear to the marketplace that staking-as-a-service providers must register and provide full, fair, and truthful disclosure and investor protection,\u201d SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in the statement.\n\nU.S. equities fell on Thursday, as traders assessed earnings and job data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.73%. The S&P 500 Index slipped 0.88% and the Nasdaq Composite Index closed down 1.02%. Trading this week has been choppy, with several U.S. Federal Reserve governors stating more interest rate increases are coming and rates may stay higher for longer to beat back inflation.\n\nAnalysts at the CME Group predict a more than 90% chance the Fed will raise interest rates by a further 25 basis points at its next meeting in March. U.S. interest rates are currently at 4.5% to 4.75%, the highest in 15 years, and Fed officials have repeatedly indicated they could raise rates to as high as 5%.\n\nFigures released Thursday showed that U.S. initial jobless claims, or applications for unemployment benefits, rose to 196,000 last week. While that is higher than the 183,000 in the previous week, the claims are still at historically low levels and indicate labor demand remains high. More people in work would typically be good news for an economy, but with the Fed focused on slowing inflation, strong economic indicators can indicate more interest rate hikes will follow.\n\nSee related article: Robinhood aims to buy-back its shares seized by Department of Justice in FTX failure"

        "content": "LocalBitcoins, one of the oldest and best-known Bitcoin exchanges, is closing after a decade of service, with the peer-to-peer platform citing the \u201congoing very cold crypto-winter\u201d as the reason for stopping operations.\n\nThe marketplace, which launched in 2012, allows users from 189 countries to trade Bitcoin by matching buyers with sellers and holding the cryptocurrency in escrow until both parties confirm the transaction\u2014assuring no funny business with dodgy traders.\n\nBut now with it shutting up shop, what other P2P exchanges can you use? A P2P service means that the two parties interact directly with each other on their own terms without the need for third-party involvement.\n\nAlthough LocalBitcoins is remarkably efficient and easy-to-use, other platforms exist. The following platforms provide a similar service that will allow you to interact directly with buyers or sellers to get a good price for your sats (or other digital assets.)\n\nBinance\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange has a P2P section where users can buy or sell a number of cryptocurrencies\u2014including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, and Binance Coin. Just like LocalBitcoins, the prices of the assets are labeled lowest to highest and users can interact directly with sellers from over 40 countries.\n\nThe service is very easy to use and quick\u2014just like when spot trading on the platform, and the service offers more payment methods than LocalBitcoins (though it lacks some of what LocalBitcoins offers, such as PayPal.)\n\nPaxful\n\nPaxful is one of the most popular P2P Bitcoin exchanges. The platform offers over 350 ways to buy and sell Bitcoin, and offers users a Bitcoin wallet.\n\nThe exchange also allows buyers and sellers to choose the location they want to shop in, the amount they want to spend, and if they want to make a transaction using another cryptocurrency (LocalBitcoins does not allow users to use cryptocurrency to buy Bitcoin.)\n\nStory continues\n\nUsers can buy Bitcoin using a number of digital assets on Paxful's P2P platform.\n\nPaxful\u2019s platform currently offers Bitcoin and stablecoins Tether and USD Coin and sign-uping up to the website is quick and easy.\n\nHuobi\n\nLike Binance, Singapore-based Huobi is another giant cryptocurrency exchange which also offers a P2P service. And just like LocalBitcoins, it\u2019s not complicated for even beginners to use.\n\nThe platform lists an impressive number of payment methods\u2014including, surprisingly, some banks which have said they don\u2019t allow customers to buy or sell crypto. But note that a trader using the P2P service must use the same details which match their Huobi account details.\n\nBisq\n\nBisq is a private, open-source P2P platform that allows users to buy and sell Bitcoin\u2014and only Bitcoin\u2014using fiat currency without know your customer (KYC) procedures. That means you don\u2019t have to hand over personally identifiable information, such as your name and address, before making a trade.\n\nYou have to download Bisq's desktop app to get started.\n\nFor those wanting complete decentralization, this is the platform: Most cryptocurrency trading platforms now require documentation to sign up, especially if fiat money is involved.\n\nDeposits are held in multisig wallets\u2014meaning the wallet is secured by various private keys, not just one\u2014to protect buyers and sellers. User data is not stored anywhere but traders have to download the desktop app to use it.\n\nOKX\n\nSeychelles-based crypto exchange OKX also has a P2P service where users can buy and sell Bitcoin, Tether, Ethereum, USD Coin, and some other digital assets in their local currency.\n\nLike other services on this list, OKX offers lots of payment methods and users are able to search through the long-list of currencies to find the best offers.\n\nBut users can only use fiat currency to make or receive payments\u2014not crypto."

        "title": "Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin retreats below US$22,000 after a record January. Is the strong start to 2023 - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell 3.92% in the week from Feb. 3 to Feb. 10, trading at US$21,848 at 6 p.m. on Friday in Hong Kong. Ether lost 5.32% in the same period, to change hands at US$1,547.\n\nColin Johnson, chief executive officer and co-founder of Freeport, a platform bringing fine art investment on-chain, said he sees two price points critical for the market\u2019s direction.\n\n\u201cKey price levels to watch are a $19k floor and $25k ceiling. If you see a breakout to either side, it\u2019s likely due to significant macro news \u2013 as the driest powder is currently in the hands of highly risk-sensitive parties,\u201d he said in a LinkedIn response to questions.\n\nJonas Betz, a crypto analyst based in Germany, agreed with the US$25,000 key price ceiling that could help the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency return to levels seen before the series of failures and bankruptcies that befell the industry last year.\n\n\u201cIf Bitcoin is able to reclaim and hold this price level on the weekly chart the next resistance level is around US$29,000, which corresponds to the price of Bitcoin before the Terra-Luna collapse.\u201d\n\nPolygon\u2019s Matic was the week\u2019s biggest gainer among the 10 largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, up 8.34% on the weekly chart, trading at US$1.28.\n\nThe global crypto market cap stood at US$1.02 trillion on Friday at 6 p.m. in Hong Kong, down 5.55% from US$1.08 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin\u2019s US$421 billion represented 41.4% of the market, while Ether accounted for 18.6%.\n\nFreeport\u2019s Johnson said macroeconomic factors will continue to drive sentiment, helped by signs of inflation easing and a smaller increase in interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve in February. However, he said \u201cthat trend is not guaranteed,\u201d pointing to spoilers such as rising U.S.-China tensions following the spy balloon incident and developments in the Ukraine conflict.\n\nKasper Vandeloock, chief executive officer of quantitative trading firm Musca Capital, said the appetite for crypto investment is still strong, adding that some investors were surprised on the upside when more skeletons did not emerge after the FTX/Celcius/3AC shenanigans.\n\n\u201cThere is an appetite for crypto, venture capitalists want in and there is a lot of demand. Shorts are being covered, FOMO (fear of missing out) is being created,\u201d wrote Vandeloock, in an email to Forkast.\n\nHowever, Betz warned that traditional financial markets are still driven by a fear of a global recession and higher inflation: \u201cIf this comes true, further de-risking will take place and markets will plummet.\u201d\n\nThe fear of U.S. entities excluding exchanges and other actors in the crypto industry from the banking system is currently driving uncertainty. Binance has already announced it will suspend USD bank transfers starting Feb. 8, wrote Betz.\n\nMarket concern also grew after crypto exchange Kraken announced Thursday that it will shut down its on-chain staking services to settle charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which had alleged that two of the exchange\u2019s subsidiaries failed to register the offer and sale of their staking program. Kraken also agreed to pay US$30 million.\n\nSEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has publicly criticized the agency\u2019s fines against Kraken, calling the approach \u201cpaternalistic and lazy,\u201d adding that \u201cusing enforcement actions to tell people what the law is in an emerging industry is not an efficient or fair way of regulating.\u201d\n\nAI coins rally\n\nSingularityNet\u2019s AGIX token was this week\u2019s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap. SingularityNet is the world\u2019s first decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) network enabling the creation and monetization of AI services.\n\n\n\nAGIX rallied over 119% to change hands at US$0.434. The token started its pick-up on Jan. 23, soon after Microsoft confirmed its US$10 billion investment in OpenAI.\n\nThe gains reignited after SingularityNet announced a partnership with Cardano to leverage the blockchain\u2019s programming language, Haskell, for developers using MeTTA, an Artificial Intelligence Domain Specific Language (AI-DSL) focused on autonomous interoperability between AI services.\n\nThe Graph\u2019s GRT was the second biggest gainer, up over 60% to trade at US$0.16. The Graph is an indexing protocol to publish open APIs with data. The Graph\u2019s technology promotes AI capabilities, as its databases show the relationships between data, which cannot be communicated using standard databases.\n\nVandeloock attributes this to the success of ChatGPT, which has created demand for AI among venture capitalists.\n\n\u201cPeople are realizing how important AI is now that they can finally interact with it through websites like ChatGPT. The importance of AI has always been there, we use machine learning and AI daily but it\u2019s not something we are aware of. Now that we can interact with it and see how powerful AI can be, people want a piece of the pie and will buy anything as long as it is AI related,\u201c wrote Vandeloock.\n\nJohnson attributed the rally to the value of blockchain and AI. \u201cPeople see two incredibly powerful technological advancements and believe that combining them must create a god-like technology. In a future where AI is able to replace human output and capture a huge amount of value, we will need blockchain to allow for the proper distribution of that massive output,\u201d wrote Johnson.\n\n\u201cAI will also help increase the speed at which cryptocurrency infrastructure is built, and the companies that are able to capture the value output from that will see obscene revenue growth over the next five years,\u201d he added.\n\nSee related article: JPMorgan report shows institutional trader interest shifting to AI from blockchain after crypto slump\n\nBut Betz held a different view. \u201cThe AGIX rally is fueled by the current hype surrounding AI, as programs like ChatGPT gained mainstream media attention. However, I expect this to be a short-lived pump-and-dump, as blockchain and AI technology are far from compatible with each other, given the current state of the art,\u201d wrote Betz.\n\nNext week?\n\n\u201cThe most likely outcome for the crypto market next week will be a continued crab walk through the doldrums,\u201d wrote Johnson. \u201cSome up days and some down days, and the potential for a breakout on either side based upon China\u2019s economy re-opening, any inclination of the Ukraine war resolving, or inflation data,\u201d\n\nBetz also anticipates a crab walk sideways. \u201cI expect the next week will show a sideways [market] with a slight downtrend. Investors should be mindful of a possible U.S. crypto de-banking operation led by the Fed and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which according to speculations have prepared measures that are deemed draconian and are aimed to kill crypto,\u201d wrote Betz.\n\nJohnson said that while major cryptos like Ethereum are \u201cby default in growth mode,\u201d macroeconomic challenges are weighing down potential.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can expect the technology and associated brainpower to continue driving demand via novel use cases. Fighting that growth is real, daunting macro challenges \u2013 inflation, international trade disputes, pandemics shutting down countries, wars, and other persistent risk factors,\u201d wrote Johnson.\n\nVandeloock anticipates bearish momentum for some altcoins. \u201cAfter this run, I still am expecting a price drop to happen on major altcoins.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of players are getting in at a late time and players are getting greedier. I\u2019m expecting AI projects to still do amazing, however many are already at a high market cap such as $FET. I would look at new projects that started building a crypto-AI business before the AI craze started,\u201d wrote Vandeloock.\n\nSee related article: Blockchain developers have taken a decentralized interest in cloud storage \u2013 will it shake up the industry?"

        "title": "The pros and cons of taking payments in cryptocurrency - Raconteur",
        "content": "The first documented purchase using bitcoin involved fast food. In 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz spent 10,000BTC on buying some takeaway pizzas from a fellow crypto enthusiast. The value of the transaction at the time was about \u00a325. If he\u2019d curbed the carbs and hung on to that money, he\u2019d have been worth about \u00a35bn at bitcoin\u2019s peak.\n\nHanyecz later explained that he had \u201cno regrets\u201d about this \u2013 someone had to get things started.\n\nWhere is it possible to spend cryptocurrencies on consumer goods today? Starbucks takes crypto via the Bakkt app, while Home Depot accepts a range of coins via the Flexa checkout systems installed in its DIY stores. In fact, about 15,000 businesses worldwide accept bitcoin, according to research by jobsite Zippia.\n\nOther studies have indicated a strong pent-up desire among both merchants and consumers to shift to crypto. Based on polls conducted in December 2021, Deloitte\u2019s Merchants Getting Ready for Crypto report suggested that 85% of organisations had placed a \u201chigh priority\u201d on enabling crypto as a payment choice. The key reason for this? Customer demand. The surveys found that 64% of consumers had a significant interest in digital currencies, while 85% of merchants believed that crypto payments would be ubiquitous among suppliers within five years.\n\nThe cryptocurrency meltdown that has occurred since that research may have dented their confidence. Bitcoin has plummeted from \u00a338,000 at the end of 2021 to about \u00a314,000 as this report goes to press. Cryptos tend to move in sync and, sure enough, other prominent coins \u2013 including ethereum, solana and dogecoin (Elon Musk\u2019s personal favourite) \u2013 have suffered similar crashes.\n\nSuch factors present some fundamental questions for any business that\u2019s thinking about accepting cryptocurrencies. Apart from the practical matters of how to receive and process payments, are the reasons for doing so sufficiently compelling, given the risks posed by the terrifying volatility associated with crypto?\n\nThe benefits of taking crypto\n\nLet\u2019s start with the advantages. \u201cThere are several pros for businesses,\u201d according to Roman Matkovskyy, assistant professor of finance and accounting at the Rennes School of Business.\n\nThese include \u201cfaster processing times, particularly for payments from abroad; potentially higher transparency; and lower transaction fees\u201d, he says. \u201cThere is no cost for direct crypto payments from a customer and a maximum transaction fee of 1% if these are routed through a tool such as Coingate or Bitpay. That compares with the standard fee of 2.9% plus 30\u00a2 per transaction for most credit card processors.\u201d\n\nStablecoins are much more suitable for merchants just gaining familiarity with crypto and digital wallets\n\nThe cost of sending crypto from one wallet to another depends on both the coin and the activity on the blockchain used. A fundamental mechanism of bitcoin and other cryptos is to reward participants for processing transactions. If activity on a blockchain increases, or there is a backlog of payments for processing, these rewards increase to incentivise more processing.\n\nBeing one of the early cryptocurrencies, bitcoin suffers from inefficiencies, so its transaction costs are relatively high. The same goes for ethereum, for which the \u2018gas fees\u2019, as these costs are known, tend to fluctuate between \u00a312 and \u00a335 (although they spiked above \u00a3500 for a spell in 2020). This makes only higher-value transactions justifiable. A substantial import order via ethereum, for instance, might save significantly on traditional payment methods.\n\nBut parallel technologies offer radical improvements. The Bitcoin Lightning Network enables the smallest tradable unit of a bitcoin \u2013 a satoshi, valued at 0.00000001BTC \u2013 to be sent. Up to 1 million transactions a second are possible on the network and the fee per transaction is less than 1\u00a2.\n\n\u201cThe Bitcoin Lightning Network can theoretically replace existing payments for fiat transactions,\u201d says Matkovskyy, who cites Solana Pay as another promising project with low fees.\n\nHow to avoid the rollercoaster\n\nVolatility is the problem that puts transaction fees in the shade. There\u2019s no point in saving a percentage point on processing costs if the currency you\u2019re trading in loses 10% of its value in a week.\n\nBut there is a way to avoid volatility altogether. Stablecoins are cryptos that are pegged to a traditional currency such as the dollar. They include tether, binance USD and dai. These enable their users to hold virtual dollars without their capital leaving the crypto universe.\n\n\u201cVolatility can be removed completely from crypto payments for both seller and buyer,\u201d says Jordan Bentley, product manager of crypto at FIS, a provider of payment tech to banks. \u201cCustomers are shown an exchange rate at the point of purchase, often locked in for 15 minutes, and merchants can choose to receive settlement in fiat, offering certainly regarding the amount.\u201d\n\nBentley adds that the use of stablecoins can keep volatility at bay for the long term. \u201cStablecoins such as Circle\u2019s USD coin, which is pegged at 1:1 with the dollar, also remove all volatility from crypto payments, enabling rapid settlements. They are therefore much more suitable for merchants that are just gaining familiarity with crypto and digital wallets,\u201d he says.\n\nBut not everyone agrees that stablecoins are deserving of their name. For instance, the most popular stablecoin, tether, stands accused of lacking transparency. There are theories that it may not have the reserves it claims, which would make it vulnerable to a run if enough users were to cash out. Indeed, The New York Times recently published an article with the headline \u201cTether: the coin that could wreck crypto\u201d.\n\nThe founder of dogecoin, Billy Markus, recently opined: \u201cTo anyone worrying about binance and / or tether collapsing, if either does it\u2019s pretty much game over.\u201d\n\nThe practicalities of crypto payment\n\nTo be able to accept crypto payments, you must choose a wallet or crypto banking service, such as Nexpay, BitPay or Worldpay.\n\nThe Geneva office of Saffery Champness, a provider of trustee services to asset managers, is planning to take crypto payments via Coinify. It will be able to accept 25 currencies, including bitcoin and ethereum.\n\n\u201cWe need to transact with crypto-native clients, but crypto is not core to our business,\u201d says its director of marketing, Siobhan Moret. \u201cUsing a merchant service like Coinify is a good option for us. It\u2019s quick to set up and inexpensive. It offers payment options in a wide variety of coins and converts almost immediately to Swiss francs. This offers us maximum flexibility at low pain.\u201d\n\nOn top of the technical challenges of accepting crypto payments, there are compliance matters to consider. In the UK, the financial services and markets bill that\u2019s progressing through Parliament should give the government new legal powers over certain crypto-related activities.\n\nSome fiat-to-crypto exchanges \u2013 for instance, Coinbase, Kraken and eToro \u2013 are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. But the watchdog did not approve the Bahamas-regulated FTX exchange, which imploded in November with the loss of an estimated \u00a36.5bn in customers\u2019 funds.\n\nYet, despite all the downsides associated with it, crypto will be the next big thing in B2B and B2C payments \u2013 if the claims of parties with an interest in its success are to be believed. A recent survey by Pymnts.com, a news website for the payments industry, for instance, has indicated that 23% of merchants are already accepting payments via crypto-native wallets.\n\nPeople are sceptical about crypto and the claims made by its proponents with good reason. Accepting payments in pounds, dollars and euros may not be sexy and the transaction fees are certainly steep. But the CEO of your high-street bank is unlikely to disappear with all your money in his suitcase.One of the oldest mottos of commerce is caveat emptor: let the buyer beware. For any entity thinking about taking crypto payments, perhaps it should be a case of caveat venditor: let the seller beware."

The tech investor may have now changed his mind somewhat, but is still heavy on the industry as a whole.\n\nHe told Reason Magazine in an interview published Wednesday that, back then, he thought Bitcoin was a tech innovation that would develop to support several other applications just like the internet, but that it \u201cbasically stopped evolving.\u201d He now has his sights set on Ethereum being at the core of transformation.\n\n\u201cWhat happened was a bunch of other projects emerged and took that place, and the big one right now is Ethereum. I would either say Ethereum instead of Bitcoin, or I would just say crypto or Web3 instead of Bitcoin,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the early Facebook investor, Web3 has all the features of the internet that people knew they wanted to have when the internet was originally built.\n\n\u201c[Web3] is all the aspects of basically being able to do business and be able to have money and be able to do transactions and have trust,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did not know how to use the internet to do that in the 90s. And now, with this technological breakthrough of the blockchain, we now know how to do that, we have the technological foundation to be able to do that.\u201d\n\nA16Z launched a $4.5 billion crypto fund in 2022, which was touted as the largest-ever crypto-venture fund. The firm\u2019s flagship crypto fund, launched in 2018, lost 40% in the first half of 2022 as they faced a battering. The VC\u2019s portfolio counts projects like Alchemy, Aptos, Avalanche, Chia, Compound, Coinbase, Lido, Mysten Labs and Yuga Labs.\n\nAndreessen didn\u2019t touch upon the bear market that lasted most of 2022, but said the potential of the industry is \u201cextraordinarily high\u201d and that there are \u201ctonnes of really smart entrepreneurs\u201d pursuing various opportunities.\n\n\u201cA lot of those things have worked, some of those things haven\u2019t worked yet, but I think that they\u2019re going to work,\u201d he said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Buzz around Bitcoin-based NFTs\u2014via the recently-launched Ordinals protocol\u2014keeps growing by the day, with record-setting mints on Thursday and high-value sales over the past day. And one established Ethereum NFT collection is reaping the benefits of going multi-chain, seeing its prices surge after revealing Bitcoin-based counterparts.\n\nOnChain Monkey, a collection of 10,000 Ethereum NFT profile pictures (PFPs) minted in 2021, used Ordinals to \u201cinscribe\u201d all of its existing artwork on Bitcoin over the past day. Now the NFT holders on Ethereum can also say that their respective collectibles live on Bitcoin, as well.\n\nPrices for the Ethereum NFTs have almost tripled since the announcement, with the floor price\u2014that is, the cheapest listed NFT on a marketplace\u2014for the project jumping from 0.79 ETH at the start of the day (per NFT Price Floor) to a peak of 1.75 ETH before settling to about 1.5 ETH (nearly $2,500) as of this writing.\n\nOnChainMonkey is the first 10K collection to be inscribed on Bitcoin via Ordinals!

The analytics platform reports about $1.1 million in sales over the past day for a project with lifetime secondary sales totaling almost $39 million.\n\nMetagood, the startup behind OnChain Monkey, said it put all 10,000 NFTs onto Bitcoin via the Ordinals protocol using a single transaction, much as it did for the original Ethereum collection back in 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Hottest Bitcoin NFTs Right Now Are CryptoPunks Clones\n\nIn a Twitter Spaces today, Metagood co-founder Danny Yang said that enabling trading was the next step for the team but suggested that other tooling needs to be created around Ordinals to facilitate that feature. He also noted that Metagood plans to build a bridge between Ethereum and Bitcoin to let NFT holders switch between the two versions.\n\n\u201cThey are the same on both chains,\u201d an OnChain Monkey Discord moderator wrote earlier today. \u201cBuy on ETH and you will have access to the BTC version when the tools catch up.\u201d\n\nThe project\u2019s Discord server is filling up with users who claim to have purchased one of the Ethereum NFTs following the Bitcoin announcement and are asking for details on how it will work.\n\nOnChain Monkey is part of Metagood\u2019s push to use Web3 initiatives to fund programs that benefit communities. These include efforts to fund coral restoration and provide aid to Ukraine amid the Russian invasion. Metagood, co-founded by venture capitalist Bill Tai alongside Yang and Amanda Terry, raised $5 million in December.\n\nMetagood says that it minted the first 10,000 NFT project on Ordinals\u2014a claim that the creators of Bitcoin Punks, a clone of popular Ethereum project CryptoPunks, have also made.\n\nBitcoin Punks began inscribing its NFTs via Ordinals before OnChain Monkey, but opted to put each Punk as a separate inscription\u2014a process that stretched from Wednesday into Thursday. OnChain Monkey, on the other hand, committed its entire collection to Ordinals via a single transaction late Wednesday.\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to clarify when OnChain Monkey and Bitcoin Punks were inscribed via Ordinals."

        "title": "As Bitcoin nears $25K, questions about rally's sustainability remain - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "It is no secret that the global economy has continued to weaken over the course of the past year. To this point, on Jan. 19, the United States government hit its \u201cdebt ceiling,\u201d i.e. the total sum of money that the U.S. Treasury can borrow to fund its ongoing federal operations, leading to renewed concerns that more financial pain and the economic slowdown could be incoming.\n\nSimilarly, on the other side of the Atlantic, the United Kingdom has been struggling as well. This is made evident by the fact the number of company insolvencies registered in 2022 hit 22,109 \u2014 a 57% spike from the year prior and its highest rate since 2009. Not only that, the International Monetary Fund recently released a report suggesting that the United Kingdom would be the only G-7 nation to face a recession this year.\n\nHowever, amid all this devastation, the crypto market seems to have caught some wind in its sail over the past month. In January, the total capitalization of this sector surged from $828 billion to approximately $1.1 trillion, signaling a rise of nearly 32%. Focusing on Bitcoin (BTC) particularly, on Jan. 30, the cryptocurrency rose to $24,000 after seemingly having stagnated around the $16,500 range for the better half of November and December.\n\nIn fact, the asset\u2019s share of the market\u2019s total cap rose as high as 44.82% recently, its highest such level since June last year. As a quick remedy, this number usually rises so steeply only when investors start limiting their exposure to altcoins and pouring their capital back into BTC.\n\nIs $25,000 the next stop for Bitcoin?\n\nAfter successfully defending a price target of $22,500 since Jan. 20, Bitcoin is currently showcasing a 30-day profit ratio of around 40%. This spike has been mirrored by similar surges in the stock market, which rallied recently after China eased its COVID-19 restrictions after three long years of strict pandemic controls.\n\n30-day Bitcoin price chart. Source: CoinGecko\n\nFurthermore, as per data made available by financial services company Matrixport, American institutional investors currently account for 85% of all recent Bitcoin accrual activities, suggesting that mainstream players are not ready to give up on the digital asset market. Thus, to gain a better understanding of where the industry may be headed in the near term, Cointelegraph reached out to Timothy T. Shan, chief operating officer for Avalanche-based decentralized exchange Dexalot. In his view:\n\n\u201cI think the recent rally in Bitcoin has been a positive surprise given all the negative news in the industry that is yet to be fully played out. That said, I don\u2019t think this current rally is sustainable and users should expect more volatility.\u201c\n\nOn a somewhat similar note, Frederic Fernandez, co-founder of DeFi trading application DEXTools, told Cointelegraph that the new year could be bullish for the crypto market if and only if the global economy is able to forge a recovery of sorts. This is because a large-scale trend reversal could boost the demand for alternative investments and increase liquidity in the market.\n\nRecent: Crypto exchanges tackle insider trading after recent convictions\n\n\u201cThe market could remain bearish if economic uncertainty increases as restrictive regulations may be imposed. However, if Bitcoin reaches $25,000, that could mean increased confidence and acceptance of cryptocurrencies leading to increased investment and widespread adoption,\u201d he added.\n\nKey market indicators\n\nAccording to Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer for Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) options exchange Deribit, the crypto market is slowly returning to greener pastures. To support this claim, he told Cointelegraph that the market is once again witnessing a \u201ccontango,\u201d a situation where the futures price of an asset is higher than its spot price. In layman's terms, a contango is usually observed when the price of a particular asset is set to rise over time.\n\nHe said that BTC\u2019s 25-Delta put skew has moved from over 30% to below zero, a bullish indicator. The above-stated metric allows analysts to forecast the price movements of an asset as well as estimate future fluctuations (volatility) based on certain predictive factors. \u201cA drop in 1-Month Skew indicates the shorter-dated out-the-money calls are getting more expensive relative to the out-the-money puts, which is a bullish signal,\u201c Strijers noted.\n\nHe also highlighted that open interest in regard to Bitcoin and Ether options has been growing again, which is a positive sign specially when considering that a lot of this momentum was lost after last year\u2019s large year-end expiry.\n\nBitcoin Options open interest data since February 2022. Source: Deribit\n\nNot only that, Strijers pointed out that the options market\u2019s put-call ratio (PCR) reached a local bottom late last month, suggesting that investors may once again be warming up to the digital asset industry. PCR is an indicator that is commonly used to determine the mood surrounding the options market.\n\nMarket sentiment analyzed\n\nOver the last week of January alone, digital-asset investment products available in the market witnessed a cumulative capital inflow of $117 million, the largest such amount over the past 180-day stretch. Investors put funds largely into BTC-related offerings, which accounted for $116 million of the aforementioned figure.\n\nFurthermore, digital investment product volume has continued to surge, approaching the $1.3 billion mark on Jan 30, up 17% when compared to its year-to-date value. However, short-Bitcoin products registered monetary inflows worth $4.4 million, which is not a good sign for investor sentiment, as per Coishares\u2019 researchers.\n\nMulti-asset investment vehicles saw money being drained from them for the third month running, with these outflows amounting to $6.4 million. According to Coinshares, this suggests that more investors are starting to move toward tried and tested crypto assets.\n\nLastly, the crypto fear and greed index, a tool that helps investors gauge crypto market movements and sentiment, currently stands at 60. This figure represents \u201cgreed,\u201d i.e. people are looking to buy digital assets as they believe that more bullish traction may be coming in the near term\n\nWhat lies ahead for the market?\n\nFrom a macro perspective, Shan believes that the Federal Reserve is close to reaching its terminal rate goal \u2014 the neutral interest rate where prices are stable, and full employment is achieved \u2014 which currently stands slightly above 5%. In his view, the Fed will hold this figure for the duration of the year while also noting that any looming recession will be very mild, one that shouldn\u2019t impact the crypto market too much.\n\nHe further noted that strict regulations will most likely be incoming shortly, which, if done correctly, could help the market immensely. \u201cThe industry could grow exponentially just because of good regulations as they will open the door to mass adoption over the next 10+ years,\u201d Shan said.\n\nRecent: Scammers are targeting crypto users with new \u2018zero value TransferFrom\u2019 trick\n\nLastly, the hard selloff as well as the various instances of fraud, over-leverage, poor controls and governance over the past year, have been a good reset for the crypto economy, in his view. This is because they can help serve as lessons for the industry, allowing participants to act responsibly and allowing the industry to blossom sustainably.\n\nThus, as we head into a future driven by increasing economic uncertainty, it will be interesting to see how the landscape of the digital currency market continues to evolve, especially with Bitcoin and other major cryptos forging a minor comeback at the moment."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Cryptocurrencies myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nHello and welcome to the latest edition of the FT\u2019s Cryptofinance newsletter. This week, we\u2019re asking whether crypto donations really make a difference in times of crisis.\n\nAfter the devastating earthquake that hit Turkey and Syria at the start of this week, the crypto industry has tried to do its part by rounding up millions in donated tokens.\n\nBlockchain records show wallet addresses shared by AHBAP, a local non-profit, have received more than $3mn in donations this week. Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis estimates that more than $5mn in crypto donations have been sent to Turkey and Syria.\n\n\u201cMany people around the world want to help with cryptocurrency,\u201d AHBAP founder and local artist Haluk Levent wrote on Twitter.\n\nChainalysis rival Elliptic has also been crunching donation numbers, finding more than $10mn worth of crypto tokens pledged by a host of crypto firms, most notably Binance which has promised a total of $5mn in donated funds.\n\nIn many ways, Turkey\u2019s economic strife even before the earthquake means the country is tailor-made to embrace crypto. An era of soaring prices and falling interest rates plays into the hands of crypto evangelists who claim digital assets such as bitcoin are a store of wealth and a hedge against inflation.\n\n\u201cIf you ask people, they are so eager on crypto,\u201d one Ankara local named Tolga told me. The FT\u2019s new Turkey correspondent \u2014 and my old boss \u2014 Adam Samson spotted a coin store in his first week in Ankara.\n\nA coin store in Ankara, spotted by the FT\u2019s Turkey correspondent Adam Samson \u00a9 FT montage / Adam Samson\n\nFor an industry scarred by scandal, it\u2019s a great sales pitch to paint crypto as the go-to tool for financial relief in times of crisis. But is it true?\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t use crypto in daily life,\u201d Tolga explained, adding that locals need to convert their crypto to the Turkish lira and withdraw newly converted fiat to their bank account. Hardly the type of financial gymnastics needed in the aftermath of a natural disaster.\n\nAnother local \u2014 who I\u2019ll refrain from naming but who traded cryptocurrencies before the earthquake \u2014 has struggled since the disaster to release funds from a popular exchange. \u201cI am really sad, I have nothing left to do but wait for [the exchange to help],\u201d they told me via Twitter.\n\n\u201cSome of our friends are under the rubble . . . we can\u2019t hold back our tears.\u201d\n\nThe intent on behalf of crypto\u2019s advocates may be admirable, but the simple fact is where crypto succeeds in enabling near-real-time transactions, it fails in real-world utility.\n\n\u201cIf the goal is to get grandma money quickly and simply, there is a strong economic argument that a countertrade swap through a crypto asset isn\u2019t going to be any cheaper than traditional mechanisms,\u201d software engineer and crypto critic Stephen Diehl told me via text. \u201cUltimately, the recipient doesn\u2019t have much use for bitcoin because they can\u2019t spend it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say crypto can\u2019t serve a humanitarian purpose. I\u2019d be remiss not to point out that more than $50mn worth of crypto tokens were donated to Ukraine\u2019s war effort in the aftermath of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion last year.\n\nWeeks after the invasion, Ukraine\u2019s deputy minister for digital transformation Alex Bornyakov said crypto was \u201cextremely helpful\u201d when it came to sending vital supplies to armed forces. \u201cEach and every helmet and vest bought via crypto donations is currently saving Ukrainian lives,\u201d he said.\n\nThat may be true, but before Christmas Bornyakov also told me that Russian use of crypto to evade sanctions was set to become a \u201chuge issue\u201d. So there are always two sides to the coin in crypto land.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on crypto\u2019s utility in times of crisis? Let me know at scott.chipolina@ft.com\n\nWeekly highlights\n\nAnother week, another crypto platform bites the dust. LocalBitcoins, one of the world\u2019s oldest crypto exchanges, announced it will discontinue its service after 10-plus years of activity. The company blamed the \u201congoing very cold crypto-winter\u201d for its closure and apologised to users for \u201cany inconvenience this may cause\u201d.\n\nThe bad news for crypto exchanges continues: late on Thursday Kraken ended its staking programme for US customers and paid $30mn in a settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The settlement is the latest in a number of enforcement actions targeting actors the SEC says violated securities rules. Check out my story with Stefania Palma here.\n\nMy colleague Joshua Oliver published a fascinating FT Magazine piece on the final hours of FTX, written during his recent trip to New York. Check it out here.\n\nFormer Coinbase employee Ishan Wahi pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. You may recall the 32-year-old\u2019s case from July last year, when the former product manager was charged with sharing tips on tokens due to be listed on Coinbase. \u201cWahi is the first insider to admit guilt in an insider trading case involving the cryptocurrency markets,\u201d said US attorney Damian Williams.\n\nDays before cracking down on Kraken, the SEC laid out its priority for the year ahead. Among other areas, the regulator pointed to emerging technologies and crypto assets as one sector that may pose risks to investors or financial markets. That much is obvious to anyone who has followed crypto for more than a day, but if you thought the SEC was tough on this industry in 2022, my advice would be to buckle up.\n\nSoundbite of the week: \u2018Shameless\u2019 crypto founder\n\nThree Arrows Capital co-founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies oversaw one of the highest-profile crypto collapses of 2022 not named FTX.\n\nEarlier this year both men announced a new exchange, named GTX. The idea behind GTX is to offer impatient folks the chance to trade bankruptcy claims before the slow wheels of justice settle claims for themselves. No, I\u2019m not kidding.\n\nThree Arrows\u2019 liquidators, who have long complained about the co-founders\u2019 lack of willingness to engage in the bankruptcy process, slammed Davies for his newest project.\n\n\u201cSince January 5, 2023, Mr Davies has been active on social media, having \u2018tweeted\u2019 or \u2018retweeted\u2019 dozens of times . . . Shamelessly, while ducking his obligations to his failed company, Mr Davies has been recently active in an effort to raise tens of millions to start a new crypto exchange.\u201d\n\nData mining: A word on darknet market share\n\nIf you follow the ever-evolving nexus of cryptocurrency and crime, you will recognise Hydra Market \u2014 at its height the largest darknet market in the world.\n\nEarlier this year the US Department of Justice took action against the founder of Bitzlato, a little-known crypto exchange that allegedly acted as a conduit for laundered money. Its largest trading counterparty, Hydra Market, was shut down in April last year.\n\nFresh data shared by Chainalysis shows that despite having only a third of the year to play with, Hydra crushed the competition.\n\nCryptofinance is edited by Philip Stafford.

        "content": "Estimated reading time: 6 minutes\n\nCryptocurrency scams and bankruptcies have seen the value of Bitcoin and other cryptos plummet as investors have rushed to dump their stakes.\n\nBut investors hoping for a market rebound may have to wait until the spring for prices to rise again.\n\nBitbank, one of the leading exchanges, expects Bitcoin to recover to between $20,000 and $30,000 after the second quarter, and only if the US Federal Reserve stops hiking interest rates and starts cutting them early next year.\n\nStandard Chartered bank takes the opposite view.\n\nAnalysts are warning investors that more crypto failures are on the way, driving prices down up to 70 per cent to bottom out at around $5,000.\n\nPlagued By Fraud And Bankruptcies\n\nBitcoin started the year at $16,605 and has followed an upwards path to reach the current price of $18,116.\n\nHowever, the cryptocurrency price is far from reaching the heady levels of the 12-month high of $47,454 in March or the record high of $66,400 in November 2021.\n\nThe latest round of fraud and bankruptcies that plague Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency world have provoked American regulators to issue a severe wealth warning to investors.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, the US Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, issued a joint statement revealing they are monitoring the crypto activities of leading banks.\n\n\u201cThe events of the past year have been marked by significant volatility and the exposure of vulnerabilities in the crypto-asset sector,\u201d the statement said.\n\nUS Regulators Issue Crypto Warning\n\nThe regulators added that issuing or holding crypto tokens stored on public decentralised networks was \u201chighly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices\u201d.\n\nBanks were also encouraged to take steps to avoid problems in the digital asset market spreading to the broader financial system.\n\n\u201cRisks related to the crypto-asset sector that cannot be mitigated or controlled mustn\u2019t migrate to the banking system,\u201d the statement continued.\n\nThe announcement followed months of hesitancy by US financial watchdogs to set guidelines on cryptocurrencies despite calls from the banks for straightforward advice.\n\nFourteen years of fraud and scandal have rocked the cryptocurrency market, but the sad truth is that the crypto system works fine \u2013 when people step in, everything seems to go wrong.\n\nThe weak point of the market are cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nNo One Controls Crypto\n\nExchanges regularly go to the wall with millions of dollars of missing funds. Moreover, as US regulators point out, crypto has no rules, no one is responsible for policing the market and fraudsters can easily run scams with little fear of detection.\n\nThat\u2019s why governments are unlikely to adopt cryptocurrency as day-to-day spending money. In addition, a lack of trust in the accountability of the market\u2019s people has put the brakes on a wider take-up of virtual currencies.\n\nInstead of the Bitcoin dollar or pound, many countries have their central banks working on digital currencies under government control.\n\nSo where does that leave cryptocurrency? One comment economists tend to make about financial bubbles is they are formed by investors making irrational decisions.\n\nTo illustrate this, the story goes that one day an economist noticed the price of tins of sardines was inexplicably rising, but no one understood why. The economist resolved to open the tin to see what was inside and found it was full of sardines. Another economist told him he should not be surprised as the tins were for buying and selling, not opening.\n\nSardines And Bubbles\n\nYou can swap out sardines for any bubble, from tulips to cryptocurrency.\n\nPredicting the future of cryptocurrency is notoriously difficult.\n\nTaking a view at what\u2019s happening at Coinbase, the world\u2019s second largest exchange behind Binance, may throw some light on what the market expects. Coinbase has announced a third round of job losses, cutting 950 posts \u2013 roughly a fifth of the company\u2019s global workforce.\n\nCoinbase is restructuring to cope with the sharp downturn in cryptocurrency values blamed on fraudsters, higher interest rates and a slowing global economy.\n\n\u201cIn 2022, the crypto market trended downwards along with the broader macroeconomy. We also saw the fallout from unscrupulous actors in the industry, and there could still be further contagion,\u201d said a blog on the company website.\n\nOffshore Rogues Hold Back Crypto\n\nThe blog is designed to promote trust in the exchange and blames loose regulation for leaving an offshore hole crooks can exploit.\n\n\u201cWe believe that what\u2019s happening now is yet another example of why strong, clear regulatory standards are so important,\u201d said the blog.\n\n\u201cFragmented, opaque regulatory frameworks in the U.S. are driving crypto to offshore unregulated exchanges, where looser regulations can put customers at risk. Congress needs to provide clear, national rules for crypto \u2014 and make those rules workable so companies aren\u2019t rewarded for building outside the U.S.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why Coinbase has leaned into regulation from the very beginning. While it may feel somewhat burdensome at times, it means our customers can trust that their assets are safe.\u201d\n\nTaking an overview of the market, crypto will remain around current values until regulators act \u2013 and that\u2019s unlikely to happen due to the offshore nature of the industry.\n\nCryptocurrency 2023 FAQ\n\nWhat is cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency is a decentralised digital currency that only exists online. The underlying technology that runs crypto is called a blockchain. What is a blockchain? Essentially, a blockchain is a tamper-proof ledger or database of cryptocurrency transactions. A cryptocurrency can run on a dedicated blockchain or share a blockchain with other cryptos. The blockchain lists any change of ownership of a token. What are tokens? Tokens are specific virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin, Ether or XRP. How do public and private keys work? Keys appl;y security toIs my money safe in a crypto e the blockchain. Public keys identify the tokens in a transaction, while private keys authorise the user access to an account. Is my money safe in a crypto exchange? Crypto exchanges are like banks. Regardless of how sophisticated the security, a robber can walk in the door and hold up the staff. A hacker is the crypto equivalent of a robber. This example highlights the weakness in crypto security and shows investors cannot eliminate the risk of fraud.\n\n\n\nOther types of security exist \u2013 hot systems use computers and drives linked to the internet, while cold systems only connect to the internet to carry out transactions. Who is responsible for policing cryptocurrency? The sad answer is no one. A country\u2019s police is responsible for policing incidents happening within the country\u2019s borders, but because crypto is not resident in any country, no police or regulator has overall responsibility or control of the system.\n\n\n\nThis was perceived as a strength by the originators of Bitcoin but has turned out to be a weakness holding back the general take-up of cryptocurrencies.\n\nRelated Information\n\nBelow is a list of related articles you may find of interest."

        "title": "How Inscriptions Impact Bitcoin Block Space - Nasdaq",
        "content": "A new use case for bitcoin is causing a stir because of its ability to include data directly on-chain. An analysis of inscriptions\u2019 impact on block space.\n\nThe below is an excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine PRO, Bitcoin Magazine's premium markets newsletter. To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals And Inscriptions\n\nA recent and somewhat contentious use of Bitcoin is an innovative application of the Taproot soft fork that was merged into the protocol in 2021. Ordinal Theory is a way of serializing each individual unit of bitcoin and labeling these specific satoshis \u201cordinals.\u201d The creator of this numbering scheme, Casey Rodarmor, described it in his blog saying, \u201cSatoshis are numbered in the order in which they\u2019re mined, and transferred from transaction inputs to transaction outputs in first-in-first-out order.\u201d\n\nBy serializing these individual satoshis and utilizing the Taproot upgrade, Bitcoin users can also include arbitrary data directly on the blockchain. While this was already possible with text using the OP_RETURN function, these new \u201cinscriptions\u201d can be anything from jpegs, short sound clips and even simple games.\n\nThere is growing debate in the development community about the implications of storing all this data directly on Bitcoin and what that means for users who want to run a full archival node. While this discussion is important, we want to dig into how inscriptions are currently impacting Bitcoin\u2019s fee market and how it might look in the future.\n\nEfficient Use Of Block Space\n\nBy their nature, inscriptions are larger files and therefore take up more of the finite space in each Bitcoin block. The users that are creating inscriptions are required to pay the necessary fees in order to send their transactions, however, inscriptions are included in witness data which is given a slight fee discount thanks to the SegWit soft fork in 2017.\n\nOrdinals officially launched on January 21, 2023. Less than three weeks later, inscriptions are already taking up 50% of Bitcoin\u2019s block space according to Pierre Rochard, vice president of research at Riot Platforms.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s fee market is a constantly changing landscape. Fees rise when demand to transact on-chain is high and users want to get their transaction included in the next block. Inversely, the fee rate drops when demand is low and users don\u2019t need their transactions confirmed in a timely manner.\n\nWhether or not these inscriptions should be considered an \u201cacceptable\u201d use of Bitcoin, the market will decide the appropriate fee pricing for those who wish to include this arbitrary data into each block. Should transaction fees rise enough, it\u2019s likely that less important or smaller bitcoin transactions will be priced out of the market and move to Layer 2 protocols, such as Lightning. These additional layers were always the game-theoretical hypothesis of Bitcoin\u2019s fee structure, even predicted by Hal Finney in 2010.\n\nHistorical Block Weight\n\nThis is not the first time that a significant number of transactions have filled the mempool. As noted, Bitcoin\u2019s fee market is dynamic and the cycle of high fees create efficient uses of block space, create low fees, create inefficient use of block space, create high fees will repeat ad infinitum.\n\nShown below is mempool data and fee prices going back to the beginning of 2017. Blockspace tends to be at a premium during bull runs as many people are sending bitcoin back and forth from exchanges or cold storage or spending it at the relatively high exchange rate.\n\nZooming in on the past three months, it\u2019s clear that there was a significant number of transactions happening in the second half of November as bitcoin flew off exchanges with users protecting themselves from any other potential contagion events.\n\nBeyond extreme cases, transaction fees have been low for long stretches of time and have led to questions about Bitcoin\u2019s long-term security budget as the block subsidy dwindles and fees must become a larger percentage of bitcoin miners\u2019 revenue. Again, the hypothesis from Bitcoin proponents is that demand for block space will increase over time as bitcoin gains adoption and scales, causing more usage to migrate to other layers built on top of the protocol.\n\nIn the last few weeks, the average block size has seen a massive spike.\n\nEven with this major increase in block size, fee market competition has yet to heat up. It\u2019s likely that those who wish to send monetary transactions will increase their fees to get their transaction included more quickly or those who want to mint an inscription without having to wait will do the same. Either way, should fees increase, so will profitability for miners who would collect additional revenue in the block reward in the form of higher transaction fees.\n\nTransaction fees are still an insignificant percentage of the mining block reward, falling somewhere between 1% and 3%. Will fees begin to rise as more and more people attempt to use bitcoin for sending money and minting inscriptions?\n\nLike this content?

        "title": "Bitcoin price correction was overdue \u2014 analysts outline why the end of 2023 will be bullish - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) price and the wider crypto market corrected at the start of this week, giving back a small portion of the gains accrued in January, but it\u2019s safe to say that the more experienced traders expected some technical correction.\n\nWhat was unexpected was the SEC\u2019s Feb. 9 enforcement against the Kraken exchange and the regulator\u2019s announcement that staking-as-service programs are unregulated securities. The crypto market sold off on the news and given Kraken\u2019s decision to shut down its staking services, traders are concerned that Coinbase will eventually be forced to do the same.\n\nWhile the events of this week triggered sharper than expected downside, the real question is, does the correction reflect a change in the trend of bullish momentum seen throughout January, or is the \u201cstaking services are unregistered securities\u201d news a simple blip that traders will disregard in the coming weeks?\n\nAccording to analysts at Delphi Digital, crypto is set up for a \u201croller coaster ride in 2023.\u201d Analysts Kevin Kelly and Jason Pagoulatos explained January\u2019s price action as being fueled by \u201crecent increases in global liquidity,\u201d which are favorable to risk assets, but both agree that macroeconomic headwinds will continue to negatively impact markets until at least the third quarter of 2023.\n\nMajor asset classes year-to-date normalized % change. Source: Delphi Digital\n\nBeyond the negative news of this week and its impact on crypto prices, a handful of metrics provide some insight into how the rest of the year could be for the crypto market.\n\nDXY comes back to life\n\nThe U.S. Dollar Index has rebounded from its recent lows, a point highlighted by Cointelegraph newsletter author Big Smokey.\n\nIn a recent post, Big Smokey said:\n\n\u201cDecember\u2019s below expectation CPI print and the upcoming February FOMC and interest rate hike clearly provided the necessary investor sentiment boost to push prices through what had been a sticky zone for months. But, as shown below, BTC\u2019s inverse correlation with the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) says it all. Recently, DXY has been losing ground, pulling back from a September 2022 high at 114 to the current 101. As is custom, as DXY pulled back, BTC price amped up.\u201d\n\nBTC and DXY weekly price action. Source: Trading View\n\nLooking at DXY this week, one will note that DXY rebounded off its Jan. 30 low at 101 and reached a five-week high near 104. Like clockwork, BTC topped out at $24,200 and began to roll over as DXY surged.\n\nDXY. 1-week chart. Source: TradingView\n\nAccording to JLabs analyst JJ the Janitor:\n\n\u201cHow DXY fares after retesting the 50-, 100-, and 200-day MAs in the weeks to come will provide us much insight into the market\u2019s next move\u2026If it breaks through and holds above its 200-day MA (currently at ~106.45), asset markets will indeed become bearish again, and we could expect November\u2019s lows to be threatened. However, should this DXY back-test fail, either now (at the 50-day) or later, we can take it as confirmation that we have entered into a new macro environment. One where the strong dollar that terrorized us in 2022 is now a neutered beast.\u201d\n\nThe Fed pivot takes way longer than investors expect\n\nFor months retail and institutional traders have prophesied an eventual pivot from the United States Federal Reserve on its interest rate hike and quantitative tightening policies. Some seem to interpret the shrinking size of the recent and future rate hikes as confirmation of their prophecy, but in the last post-Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) presser, Powell hinted at the need for future rate hikes and while speaking to David Rubenstein during an open interview at the Economic Club of Washington. Powell said:\n\n\u201cWe think we are going to need to do further rate increases,\u201d primarily because according to Powell, \u201cThe labor market is extraordinarily strong.\u201d\n\nAccording to Delphi Digital analysis, market participants are \u201cplaying chicken with the Fed trying to call their bluff.\u201d The analysts suggest that data shows the bond market is signaling that the Fed\u2019s policy is too firm.\n\nGenerally, equities and crypto markets have rallied when FOMC decisions on rate hikes align with the expectation of market participants and anyone who was following crypto markets in 2022 will remember that everyone and their mother was waiting for Powell to pivot before going ultra long on large-cap cryptocurrencies.\n\nFrom the vantage point of technical analysis, BTC\u2019s price pullback was also expected, with a possible retest of underlying support in the $20,000 zone, especially after a 40%+ monthly rally in January.\n\nBased on historical data and fractal analysis, Delphi Digital analysts suggest that there is room for further upside from BTC as \u201cthere isn\u2019t a lot of overhead supply for BTC in the $24K - $28K range\u201d and earlier reporting from Cointelegraph highlighted the importance of Bitcoin\u2019s recent golden cross.\n\nWhile this is all encouraging in the short-term, the reality of certain Consumer Price Index components remaining sticky and Powell seeing a need for further interest rate hikes due to the labor market\u2019s strength should be a reminder that crypto is not yet in bull market territory. Interest rate hikes increase operational and capital costs for businesses, and these increases always trickle down to the consumer. Another consistent and alarming development is the continuance of layoffs in Big Tech companies.\n\nBanks and major U.S. brokerages continue to spin down their earnings estimates and Big Tech has a way of being the canary in the coal mine for equities markets. The high correlation between equities markets and Bitcoin and concerning macroeconomic hurdles suggest an expiration date on crypto\u2019s recent mini bull market. Investors would do well to keep this front of mind.\n\nIf the long-awaited \u201cFed pivot\u201d continues to remain elusive, certain realities will come to the forefront that is bound to have a stronger impact on pricing in the crypto and equities markets.\n\nRelated: SEC enforcement against Kraken opens doors for Lido, Frax and Rocket Pool\n\nLooking deeper into 2023\n\nDespite the bearish nature of the challenges listed above, Delphi Digital analysts issued a more positive outlook for the bottom half of 2023. According to their analysis:\n\n\u201cThe need for liquidity expansion will become more pressing as the year progresses. Cracks in the labor market will also become more apparent, which will give the Fed cover for a shift toward more accommodative policy. The reversal in Global Liquidity we cited at the end of last year will start to accelerate in response to a weaker growth outlook and concerns over growing fragilities in sovereign debt markets, acting as support for risk assets in 2H 2023. The impact of changes in global liquidity on financial markets tends to lag anywhere from 6-18 months, setting up a more optimistic outlook for 2024-2025.\u201d\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and even nascent altcoins are a solid \u201cbuy,\u201d a previously risk-off investor says.\n\nIn a blog post released on Feb. 8, industry stalwart Arthur Hayes announced a u-turn on his current crypto investment plans.\n\nHayes changes tune on \u201crisky assets\u201d\n\nCurrent macroeconomic conditions stemming from the United States Federal Reserve previously made Arthur Hayes keen to avoid what he calls \u201crisky assets.\u201d\n\nAs inflation slows in tandem with the Fed\u2019s rate hikes, multiple new storms are brewing in the U.S., and the Fed, Congress and the Treasury will steer the economy as they see fit, he says.\n\nThe problem is guessing how these events will play out over the course of the year. For Hayes, 2023 could well be split into two halves, with H1 being an ideal investment environment for crypto.\n\nThis runs contrary to a previous thesis from mid-January, in which the former BitMEX CEO said that he was staying on the sidelines for fear of a Fed-induced capitulation event hitting risk assets.\n\n\u201cMy concerns about this potential outcome, which I handicapped would most likely happen later in 2023, has led me to keep my spare capital in money market funds and short-dated U.S. Treasury bills,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cAs such, the portion of my liquid capital that I intend to eventually use to purchase crypto is missing out on the current monster rally we\u2019re seeing off of the local lows. Bitcoin has rallied close to 50% from the $16,000 lows we saw around the FTX fallout.\u201d\n\nHayes continued that Bitcoin is likely far from done with its rebound despite 40% gains in January alone, comparing the risk asset environment to 2009 and the start of quantitative easing.\n\nS&P 500 (SPX) annotated chart (screenshot). Source: Arthur Hayes/ Medium\n\nThis year, the picture is complex \u2014 quantitative easing has given way to quantitative tightening, where liquidity is removed from the U.S. financial system at risk assets\u2019 expense.\n\nHowever, H1 looks to be providing some relief, with some liquidity returning to avoid hitting the debt ceiling too soon. This could continue until Congress votes to raise the debt ceiling in the summer, which Hayes and others argue is inevitable.\n\nCash in the Treasury General Account (TGA) will be emptied to the amount of $500 billion, canceling the $100 billion monthly liquidity that the Fed is removing.\n\n\u201cThe TGA will be exhausted sometime in the middle of the year. Immediately following its exhaustion, there will be a political circus in the U.S. around raising the debt limit,\u201d the blog post forecasts.\n\n\u201cGiven that the Western-led fiat financial system would collapse overnight if the US government decided to forgo raising the debt ceiling and instead defaulted on the assets that underpin said system, it\u2019s safe to assume the debt ceiling will be raised.\u201d\n\nU.S. federal debt trends chart (screenshot).

His plan is to move into U.S. dollar cash, from where a segue into select risk assets is possible. Top of the menu, it would appear, is Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll deploy over the coming days. I wish my size actually mattered, but it doesn\u2019t \u2014 so please don\u2019t think that when this happens, it will have any discernible effect on the price of the orange coin,\u201d he told readers.\n\nGoing forward, however, altcoins represent a major opportunity, the blog post explains in its conclusion, with these likewise conditioned by timing.\n\n\u201cThe key to shitcoining is understanding they go up and down in waves. First, the crypto reserve assets rally \u2014 that is, Bitcoin and Ether. The rally in these stalwarts eventually stalls, and then prices fall slightly,\u201d Hayes wrote about crypto market cycles.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, the shitcoin complex stages an aggressive rally. Then shitcoins rediscover gravity, and interest shifts back to Bitcoin and Ether. And this stair-stepping process continues until the secular bull market ends.\u201d\n\nYear-to-date, the total crypto market cap has gained around 34%, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows.\n\nTotal crypto market cap 1-day candle chart.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin NFTs are the talk of the Web3 world right now, thanks to a new way to \u201cmint\u201d media and assets on the layer-1 blockchain through the Ordinals project. And, as with many past NFT network launches, cloned versions of Ethereum\u2019s early and influential CryptoPunks are dominating the early buzz around Ordinals.\n\nCryptoPunks, created by Larva Labs in 2017, is a seminal NFT project that set the template for the modern profile picture (PFP) trend. The 10,000 Ethereum assets were initially released via a free mint, well before there was a thriving NFT market, but have gone on to generate almost $2.5 billion worth of trading volume in the years since.\n\nOrdinals just launched on the Bitcoin blockchain in late January, but there are already multiple CryptoPunks-inspired projects gaining steam on the platform.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe most prominent so far is Ordinal Punks, which spans 100-pixel avatars that have been \u201cinscribed\u201d on Bitcoin through the Ordinals project and can be traded. Unlike some Punks clones seen in the past, however, they're not direct clones of the original CryptoPunks collection.\n\nSome on Crypto Twitter believe that Ordinal Punks is based on a derivative Ethereum collection called Mutant Punks\u2014in other words, a derivative of a derivative. However, a person connected to the project clarified to Decrypt that Ordinal Punks \"used an open-source algorithm and CC0 Punk sprite sheet to generate new Punks.\"\n\nOne Ordinal Punk sold for 9.5 BTC late Wednesday, or nearly $215,000. While that\u2019s about double the entry-level price for a real CryptoPunk\u2014about 64 ETH right now, or nearly $106,000\u2014that particular Ordinal Punk is based on the very rare alien CryptoPunks, which have sold for as much as nearly $24 million worth of ETH in the past.\n\n12 years ago I was mining Bitcoin on a gaming PC in my parent's basement. Today, we just minted out the first 10k NFT collection on Bitcoin. Thanks to everyone, but most importantly the @cryptopunksnfts. \u2764\ufe0f@Bitcoin_Punks_ + https://t.co/3O4wIo0OYC pic.twitter.com/BV0a6KmrWj \u2014 Robert Clarke (@robertjfclarke) February 9, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn another example, pseudonymous NFT collector and investor dingaling tweeted that he purchased a bundle of seven Ordinal Punks for 15.2 BTC on Wednesday\u2014about $349,000 worth at the time.\n\nHowever, because Ordinals just launched and they function differently than typical NFTs on other platforms (like Ethereum and Solana), there isn\u2019t much infrastructure to support buying and selling the assets once they\u2019ve been described. In other words, there aren\u2019t Bitcoin NFT marketplaces for Ordinals just yet.\n\nIn fact, such trades are currently taking place over the counter (OTC) directly between users or through escrow services, with asking prices and bids being tracked via online spreadsheets. It\u2019s all being facilitated through Twitter and Discord as collectors vie for these Punk clones, as some expect these early Bitcoin \u201cinscriptions\u201d to prove more and more valuable over time.\n\nnew opensea competitor lookin sharp pic.twitter.com/pJH0fuRnYm \u2014 113 \u2656\u2656\u2656 (@0x113d) February 8, 2023\n\n\u201cThere's [a] real moment behind Ordinals and things are still very very early. There are opportunities everywhere,\u201d dingaling tweeted. \u201cOrderbooks are currently updated on shared spreadsheets and sales are only done via OTC/escrow. But there's lots of building being done behind the scenes.\u201d\n\nHowever, the lack of infrastructure means that the current trading model is susceptible to scams, and some Crypto Twitter users have raised the alarm. One viral thread from pseudonymous NFT collector TheNorwegian called out various perceived issues with the collection, and asked whether it's the \"biggest NFT scam of all time.\"\n\nAnother notable Ordinals project is Bitcoin Punks, which puts replicas of all 10,000 original CryptoPunks on Bitcoin. It\u2019s billed as the first 10,000-piece NFT project launched through Ordinals, and all of the assets have already been minted for free by collectors.\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear how much trading demand there is for the larger Bitcoin Punks collection at this point, however, and a moderator on the project\u2019s official Discord server warned holders today to \u201cbe careful trading\u201d before a code audit can be completed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOrdinals use has surged over the last few days, with data platform Dune showing over 17,000 mints on the platform already today\u2014double yesterday\u2019s total, continuing a trend that has exploded over the last week-plus. More than 39,000 assets have now been inscribed as Ordinals, including other knockoffs and a playable clone of the classic video game Doom.\n\nHowever, the project has proven controversial with some Bitcoin maximalists and enthusiasts, some of whom have argued that it\u2019s a waste of network space or that it goes against Bitcoin\u2019s original focus on financial assets. Bitcoin transaction fees have surged over the last week and a half since Ordinals started gaining steam.\n\nCryptoPunks clones are common on NFT protocols that have emerged after Ethereum, and you can find them all over the place\u2014on Solana, Polygon, Cardano, Algorand, and even Stacks, a \u201clayer 1.5\u201d network built on top of Bitcoin.\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to clarify the origins of the Ordinal Punks designs."

The long-time Bitcoin trading service was the first peer-to-peer (P2P) transaction platform for many Bitcoiners. Launched in June 2012, the exchange is one of the oldest entities in Bitcoin, establishing itself as a primary P2P player in its hey-day with over $100 million in weekly trading volume of peer-to-peer transactions.\n\n\u201cOriginally LocalBitcoins was established to Bring Bitcoin Everywhere and drive global financial inclusion,\u201d the announcement reads. \u201cWe have honored that mission for over 10 years and we are proud of what we have achieved together with all of you, our loyal community.\u201d\n\nThe announcement cites \u201cchallenges during the ongoing very cold crypto-winter\u201d as reasoning for the shutdown. The exchange has informed customers that they should withdraw their funds from LocalBitcoins, as well as withdrawing their bitcoin from the LocalBitcoins wallet. It notes that customers will have 12 months to complete this process, although they encourage users to do so sooner.\n\nNotably, the shutdown has arrived just as P2P Bitcoin merchants and individual sellers have come under heavy scrutiny from U.S. regulatory authorities. While there is no mention of this in the announcement, it could be assumed that these recent actions have led to decreased volume on platforms like LocalBitcoins.\n\nDespite these pressures, alternatives such as RoboSats and Bisq still function for Bitcoiners seeking to acquire bitcoin via P2P transactions.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

Discover SCENE\n\nLocalBitcoins, one of the oldest and best-known Bitcoin exchanges, is closing after a decade of service, with the peer-to-peer platform citing the \u201congoing very cold crypto-winter\u201d as the reason for stopping operations.\n\nThe marketplace, which launched in 2012, allows users from 189 countries to trade Bitcoin by matching buyers with sellers and holding the cryptocurrency in escrow until both parties confirm the transaction\u2014assuring no funny business with dodgy traders.\n\nBut now with it shutting up shop, what other P2P exchanges can you use? A P2P service means that the two parties interact directly with each other on their own terms without the need for third-party involvement.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlthough LocalBitcoins is remarkably efficient and easy-to-use, other platforms exist. The following platforms provide a similar service that will allow you to interact directly with buyers or sellers to get a good price for your sats (or other digital assets.)\n\nBinance\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange has a P2P section where users can buy or sell a number of cryptocurrencies\u2014including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, and Binance Coin. Just like LocalBitcoins, the prices of the assets are labeled lowest to highest and users can interact directly with sellers from over 40 countries.\n\nThe service is very easy to use and quick\u2014just like when spot trading on the platform, and the service offers more payment methods than LocalBitcoins (though it lacks some of what LocalBitcoins offers, such as PayPal.)\n\nPaxful\n\nPaxful is one of the most popular P2P Bitcoin exchanges. The platform offers over 350 ways to buy and sell Bitcoin, and offers users a Bitcoin wallet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe exchange also allows buyers and sellers to choose the location they want to shop in, the amount they want to spend, and if they want to make a transaction using another cryptocurrency (LocalBitcoins does not allow users to use cryptocurrency to buy Bitcoin.)\n\nUsers can buy Bitcoin using a number of digital assets on Paxful's P2P platform.\n\nPaxful\u2019s platform currently offers Bitcoin and stablecoins Tether and USD Coin and sign-uping up to the website is quick and easy.\n\nHuobi\n\nLike Binance, Singapore-based Huobi is another giant cryptocurrency exchange which also offers a P2P service. And just like LocalBitcoins, it\u2019s not complicated for even beginners to use.\n\nThe platform lists an impressive number of payment methods\u2014including, surprisingly, some banks which have said they don\u2019t allow customers to buy or sell crypto. But note that a trader using the P2P service must use the same details which match their Huobi account details.\n\nBisq\n\nBisq is a private, open-source P2P platform that allows users to buy and sell Bitcoin\u2014and only Bitcoin\u2014using fiat currency without know your customer (KYC) procedures. That means you don\u2019t have to hand over personally identifiable information, such as your name and address, before making a trade.\n\nYou have to download Bisq's desktop app to get started.\n\nFor those wanting complete decentralization, this is the platform: Most cryptocurrency trading platforms now require documentation to sign up, especially if fiat money is involved.\n\nDeposits are held in multisig wallets\u2014meaning the wallet is secured by various private keys, not just one\u2014to protect buyers and sellers. User data is not stored anywhere but traders have to download the desktop app to use it.\n\nOKX\n\nSeychelles-based crypto exchange OKX also has a P2P service where users can buy and sell Bitcoin, Tether, Ethereum, USD Coin, and some other digital assets in their local currency.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLike other services on this list, OKX offers lots of payment methods and users are able to search through the long-list of currencies to find the best offers.\n\nBut users can only use fiat currency to make or receive payments\u2014not crypto."

        "title": "6 best cross-chain bridges in 2023 - TechTarget",
        "content": "As the demand for different blockchain-based Web 3.0 technologies continues to grow, so too does the need to enable interoperability. This is something that is enabled with cross-chain bridge services.\n\nBlockchain is a distributed ledger technology that uses cryptography to provide assurance and integrity to data and transactions. Blockchain networks enable many types of services, including secured databases, immutable ledgers, decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThere are many blockchain networks and cryptocurrencies that use different blockchain technologies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Solana and Arbitrum. Enabling interoperability and exchange across different blockchain networks is an area where cross-chain bridges -- sometimes also referred to as blockchain bridges -- play an increasingly important role.\n\nWhat is a cross-chain bridge? A cross-chain bridge enables an exchange of information, cryptocurrency or NFTs from one blockchain network to another. It enables the flow of data and tokens across what would otherwise be siloed sets of data on different blockchains. With fiat currency there are many established ways for individuals and businesses to exchange money, creating a globally available and interoperable system of financial payments. Those systems include financial institutions, banks and credit cards that handle foreign exchange. In the world of blockchains, a cross-chain bridge serves an analogous purpose. Exchange across different blockchains for cryptocurrency is possible without a cross-chain bridge, but it is expensive and more time-consuming. Without the use of a cross-chain bridge, users must first convert a cryptocurrency token into a fiat currency, which often involves fees. They then use currency to get the other desired type of cryptocurrency, incurring more fees and taking time. One characteristic of a cross-chain bridge is that it enables users to exchange one cryptocurrency for another without first changing it to fiat currency. Cross-chain bridges aren't limited to just cryptocurrency value transfer either. An effective cross-chain bridge can also enable the transfer of smart contracts and NFTs from one blockchain environment to another. There are several approaches to enabling transfers with a cross-chain bridge. One common approach is using a wrapped token issued by the cross-chain bridge provider platform. With a wrapped token, the value of one token from a specific blockchain network can be encapsulated inside another token. Wrapped tokens are typically based on the ERC-20 technical specification for an Ethereum network. For example, WBTC is a Bitcoin token wrapped with an ERC-20 Ethereum smart contract. Another approach to enabling cross-chain bridge transfers is by using a liquidity pool. With a liquidity pool, a cross-chain bridge provider holds inventory -- or pools -- of various coins where one can be exchanged for another. Cross-chain bridges can also be a lucrative target for hackers. One of the largest attacks occurred in February 2022, when cross-chain bridge platform Wormhole was the victim of an attack in which the threat actor stole 120,000 wrapped Ethereum tokens -- worth an estimated $320 million at the time of the theft. BNB Chain, also known as Binance Smart Chain, was the victim of an attack in October 2022 that resulted in losses estimated at $570 million. Blockchain bridge analysis vendor Chainalyis has estimated that 69% of cryptocurrency funds stolen in 2022 have been attributed to attacks on cross-chain bridges.

        "content": "The two companies will join together to form \u2018Hut 8 Corp\u2019 or \u2018New Hut\u2019 and will have access to approximately 825MW of gross energy across six sites, four of which were previously US-based Bitcoin mining facilities, the other two were used by Hut 8 for digital asset mining and high-performance computing (HPC).\n\nHut 8 Corp will, according to the company, not only focus on \u2018economical mining\u2019, but also anticipates having several diversified revenue streams all while meeting ESG standards. The deal is expected to close in Q2 of 2023.\n\nThe company will be governed by a combination of Hut 8 and USBTC executives, including Hut 8 CEO Jaime Leverton retaining her role and USBTC CEO Michael Ho to become chief strategy officer. The board of directors will consist of five individuals from each company.\n\nThe transaction will see Hut 8 shareholders receive 0.2 of a share of New Hut stock for every share of Hut 8 they previously held. Similarly, shareholders of USBTC will retain 0.6716 per share. Based on the five-day VWAP for the Hut 8 shares on the Nasdaq as of the last trading day prior to this announcement (6 February), the aggregate Consideration implies a combined market capitalization of approximately $990 million. The two companies will each own 50 percent of Hut 8 Corp.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Hut 8 has also committed to providing USBTC with secured bridge financing during the interim period of between $6m and $6.5m.\n\n\"Our established track record of creating shareholder value through organic growth and strategic acquisitions while maintaining a balance sheet-first approach has positioned us perfectly to advance our growth trajectory through this business combination,\" said Jaime Leverton, CEO, Hut 8.\n\n\"Bringing together Hut 8's operational track record and diversified revenue streams with US Bitcoin's scalable mining sites, sizeable hosting business, and industry-leading managed infrastructure operations not only accelerates our diversified strategy and positions us for near-term growth, but also establishes us as a strong, US-based player that is ready and able to seize additional opportunities as they arise.\"\n\nHut 8 Corp will have 5.6 EHps of self-mining capacity and 244MW of total energy available at the five self-mining sites located in Alabama, New York, and Texas.\n\nOne of the two Texas sites, King Mountain, will remain 50 percent owned by USBTC\u2019s energy partner King Mountain Joint Venture. Hut 8 Corp will manage the 220MW of hosting infrastructure on the site which is powered by wind and nuclear power among other sources.\n\n\"The combination of Hut 8 and USBTC is an important step, but it's truly just the beginning,\" said Asher Genoot, co-founder and President of USBTC.\n\n\"We believe that New Hut will challenge industry paradigms and set the standard for operating rigor and team culture. We are laser-focused on identifying opportunities to capture untapped value across the mining ecosystem. Together, we will become an exceptional self-mining operator, hosting provider, strategic operator of managed infrastructure, purveyor of high-performance computing infrastructure, and industry-leading ASIC repair and sales hub, underpinned by world-class operating technology and IP to drive growth.\"\n\nLast month Hut 8 was required to pause its mining operations due to disagreements with its energy provider, Validus. This, along with tumbling cryptocurrency values and the fall of FTX Trading has meant Hut 8 has had a challenging few months. On the announcement of the merger, Hut 8 shares dropped by nine percent to $2.17. In total, the stock\u2019s value has dropped by 86 percent since its November 2021 all-time high.\n\nRiot Platforms opens new building, suffers damage in Texas storm\n\nIn other crypto news, crypto mining and data center hosting company Riot Platforms (Riot) has released its January 2023 updates.\n\nRiot has announced the return of operations in Building F. The company experienced a significant hit to its operations after the severe winter weather in Texas damaged the pipes to its immersion-cooled F & G buildings at the Rockdale Facility in late December 2022. The Rockdale Facility has ~700MW of capacity.\n\nJason Les, CEO of Riot, said: \u201cAs previously disclosed, some sections of piping in Buildings F and G were damaged during the severe winter storms in Texas in late December, impacting approximately 2.5 exahashes per second (EHps) of our hash rate capacity. Repairs have been ongoing in both buildings, and we have successfully brought Building F back online, representing 0.6 EHps of impacted hash rate capacity. We are thankful for our team\u2019s progress, despite difficult weather conditions, and are evaluating several options to bring online the approximately 1.9 EHps of hash rate capacity still affected in Building G.\"\n\nDuring this period, Riot also voluntarily curtailed operations to help protect the ERCOT grid and, as a result, earned $4.9m in power credits throughout December. The company did a similar thing in the Summer of 2022, during which period DCD reported that the company earned more in power credits than it would have from crypto mining.\n\nWhile work is ongoing for building G, the company has recently completed Building D at the same facility, an air-cooled building, and is continuing developments for its external water system-cooled Building E with the installation of external wall lovers, interior water frames, and electrical testing."

        "content": "SHARON, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mawson Infrastructure Group Inc. (NASDAQ:MIGI) (\u201cMawson\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a digital infrastructure provider, announced today that it has broken ground on the Company\u2019s latest Bitcoin Mining operation in Sharon, PA. The first 6 Modular Data Centers, capable of holding and operating up to 3,528 ASIC miners and handling approximately 12MW have been installed. The site has a total capacity of 120 MW, which is capable of housing and operating up to 35,280 ASIC miners,1 with those miners capable of producing up to 4.2 exahashes per second (EH/s)2.\n\nThe first stage of 12 MW is scheduled to be energized in early Q2, 2023. The balance of the 120 MW capacity will come online incrementally through 2023 and early 2024.\n\nMawson plans for the Sharon, PA facility to house a split of Mawson Self-Mining and Mawson Hosting operations.\n\nThe Sharon, PA facility will also take part in Mawson\u2019s market leading Energy Markets Program, which helps drive curtailment revenue through periods of grid stress, whilst simultaneously providing power stability to the grid and households throughout the PJM market.\n\nThe successful completion of the Sharon, PA and Midland, PA (100 MW) sites will see Mawson with a total capacity of up to 220 MW of power, capable of housing and operating up to approximately 64,680 ASIC miners, with those miners theoretically capable of producing approximately 7.8 exahashes per second (EH/s).\n\nLiam Wilson, COO, commented, \u201cWe are delighted to have broken ground on our Sharon, PA facility \u2013 and to have taken delivery of the first 6 Modular Data Centers destined for Sharon, capable of delivering 12MW of power to our miners / holding about 12 MW worth of miners. This step forward is further proof of Mawson\u2019s push to deploy infrastructure and energize through 2023, and to achieve our previously stated targets. We look forward to continuing to communicate operational updates throughout 2023.\u201d\n\nAbout Mawson Infrastructure\n\nMawson Infrastructure Group (NASDAQ: MIGI) is a digital infrastructure provider, with multiple operations throughout the USA and Australia. Mawson\u2019s vertically integrated model is based on a long-term strategy to promote the global transition to the new digital economy. Mawson matches sustainable energy infrastructure with next-generation Mobile Data Center (MDC) solutions, enabling low-cost Bitcoin production and on-demand deployment of infrastructure assets. With a strong focus on shareholder returns and an aligned board and management, Mawson Infrastructure Group is emerging as a global leader in ESG focused Bitcoin mining and digital infrastructure.\n\nFor more information, visit: www.mawsoninc.com\n\nStatements about hashrate capacity\n\nStatements in the press release about hashrate capacity (including \u2018installed capacity\u2019 or \u2018nameplate\u2019 capacity), will often differ from the actual or observed hashrates. Hashrate capacity generally makes certain assumptions about the efficiency of the ASIC miners that are in use. Some ASIC miner models will consume less power to create the same amount of hashing power than other ASIC miner models (typically more recent models are more efficient). Many ASIC miner fleets are blended fleets, including various ASIC miner models each with different efficiency ratings. Hashrate capacity figures typically assume 100% deployment of ASIC miners. Given the large numbers of computing units (often numbering in the tens of thousands), ASIC mining fleets are rarely 100% deployed and online at any one time. This can be due to a variety of factors, including ASIC miners being under maintenance, in storage, in transit, or due to technical faults and breakdowns. Once deployed and online, the actual or observed hashrate can be influenced by other factors such as heat, overclocking (causing the ASIC miner to perform at levels higher than the manufacturer\u2019s specifications), the age, and wear and tear exhibited by the ASIC miners and also by the limitations of the surrounding infrastructure, such as power outages, and MDC and transformer breakdowns. Construction and development delays are a common risk for mining data centers, for example due to weather, permitting delays, or labor and equipment shortages. Investors should consider all risk factors related to uptime when considering these figures, which are a best-case scenario.\n\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nMawson cautions that statements in this press release that are not a description of historical fact are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words referencing future events or circumstances such as \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d and \u201cwill,\u201d among others. Because such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based upon Mawson\u2019s current expectations and involve assumptions that may never materialize or may prove to be incorrect. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of various risks and uncertainties, which include, without limitation, the possibility that Mawson\u2019s need and ability to raise additional capital, the development and acceptance of digital asset networks and digital assets and their protocols and software, the reduction in incentives to mine digital assets over time, the costs associated with digital asset mining, the volatility in the value and prices of cryptocurrencies and further or new regulation of digital assets. More detailed information about the risks and uncertainties affecting Mawson is contained under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d included in Mawson\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 21, 2022, and Mawson\u2019s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 22, 2022, November 14, 2022 and in other filings Mawson has made and may make with the SEC in the future. One should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they were made. Because such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Mawson undertakes no obligation to update such statements to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made, except as may be required by law.\n\n________________________________\n\n1 Statements about ASIC miner capacity in this document are not an assurance that Mawson will have that many ASIC miners available to deploy (whether self-mining or hosted units). Mawson\u2019s ability to deploy units will depend on many factors such as Mawson\u2019s future ASIC miner purchases and sales, our ability to attract future hosting customers, and the number of ASIC miners customers have to deploy.\n\n2 Statements about exahash capacity in this document assume a combined fleet (of self-mining and hosted units) deployed over the relevant sites having an industry-leading average of 120TH per machine. This may not be achieved, and will depend on many factors such as Mawson\u2019s future ASIC miner purchases and sales, our ability to attract future hosting customers, and the hosting customers\u2019 ASIC miner specifications. To the extent that any of the ASIC miners operate at less than 120TH, then this will reduce the hash rate actually achieved."

        "content": "Max Levchin, the CEO of buy-now-pay-later company Affirm, has confirmed that they will be shutting down their \u201cAffirm Crypto Program\u201d amid dampening consumer spending and a changing macroeconomic environment.\n\nThe CEO released a letter to shareholders on Feb. 8 alongside a 19% staff cut. He cited uncertain macroeconomic conditions and the need to offset some liabilities on the firm\u2019s balance sheet as the two main reasons behind the decision:\n\n\u201cIn a period of increased economic uncertainty, we are doubling down on our core businesses, delaying projects with less certain revenue timelines, and aligning our operating expenses with revenue. Concurrent with reducing our workforce, we are sunsetting several initiatives, such as Affirm Crypto.\u201d\n\nThe firm\u2019s chief financial officer, Michael Linford, said the decision was made to meet profitability targ.\n\n\u201cWe have taken decisive actions to reduce expenses. We believe our cost base is now appropriately sized to meet our profitability goals while still supporting our product roadmap and long-term growth ambitions,\u201d he said.\n\nAffirm is a millennial-facing payments service provider similar to Afterpay that allows customers to purchase a product online and pay later.\n\nThe firm launched the \u201cAffirm Crypto Program\u201d in late 2021, near crypto\u2019s market peak, partnering with Bitcoin payments platform NYDIG to process Bitcoin (BTC) transactions and provide a crypto account for Affirm users.\n\nThe program enabled users to set up a scheme where monthly interest accrued from a user\u2019s savings account would be automatically converted into BTC.\n\nHowever, Affirm noted its cryptocurrency program will officially close on March 31, according to the Affirm website:\n\n\u201cOn March 2, 2023, the ability to purchase bitcoin through the Affirm app will end. We will be discontinuing the Affirm Cryptocurrency Program on March 31, 2023.\n\n\u201cAny bitcoin in your account when the program ends will be sold at CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR) as of 4:00 p.m. London Time, and the sale proceeds will be deposited into your Affirm Savings account,\u201d the note added.\n\nAs of March 2, Affirm users will no longer be able to buy Bitcoin. Source: Affirm\n\nThe shutdown is of course a part of a larger staff cleanout for the San Francisco-based lending platform. Levchin said the 19% reduction in its workforce took effect Feb 8.\n\nLevchin shouldered the blame, stating in a Feb. 8 note to employees that he reacted too slowly to actions from the U.S. Federal Reserve:\n\n\u201cEverything changed in mid-2022. Over the last three quarters, the Fed increased its benchmark rate at an unprecedented pace. This has already dampened consumer spending and increased Affirm\u2019s cost of borrowing dramatically. The root cause of where we are today is that I acted too slowly as these macroeconomic changes unfolded.\u201d\n\nApproximately 2,593 individuals claim to be employed at Affirm, according to from LinkedIn.\n\nThis means about 500 people were likely impacted by the announcement.\n\nRelated: Coinbase to cut another 20% of its workforce in second wave of layoffs\n\nCointelegraph reached out to Affirm to find out how many employees related to its crypto initiative were impacted, however, no additional information was shared.\n\nThe CEO did however state in the letter that he expects to keep the current headcount to remain essentially flat for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe price of Affirm\u2019s stock, tickered AFRM, has fallen 19.1% in after-hours trading in the NASDAQ, according to Google Finance."

        "content": "The U.K. High Court has ruled that a landmark claim over the ownership of the Bitcoin database and the Bitcoin white paper has enough prospect of success that it\u2019s defendants can be served out of the jurisdiction.\n\nThe claim is brought by Dr. Craig Wright and is against the BTC partnership, which comprises the BTC developers and ecosystem companies such as Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN), Blockstream, Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), and Square (NASDAQ: SQ). It is the first time that a claim has been brought against the BTC outfit in its entirety, including the wider group of corporates that prop up and disseminate the BTC system.\n\nThe U.K.-based defendants have already been served. However, to serve defendants sitting outside of the jurisdiction, Dr. Wright must prove that the claim represents a serious issue to be tried on the merits of the case. On Wednesday, the U.K. High Court ruled that there is merit on at least two of the three arms of Dr. Wright\u2019s argument.\n\nThose arms are the infringement by the defendants of Dr. Wright\u2019s rights to the Bitcoin database as its true owner and infringement by the defendants of his copyright in the Bitcoin white paper: the Judge easily satisfied himself that there is a serious issue to be tried on those points easily.\n\n\u201cI was and am satisfied that the claims in database right and of infringement of copyright in the White Paper raise serious issues to be tried and therefore service out of the jurisdiction of those claims should be permitted,\u201d wrote the Judge.\n\nThe third, which was a claim over copyright in the Bitcoin file format itself, involving the structure of the Bitcoin blocks, was rejected by the Judge. The issue is that the structure of any subsequent block building on Dr. Wright\u2019s original Bitcoin blocks cannot be read without relying on the original: according to Dr. Wright, the subsequent blocks violate his copyright on that basis. The Judge acknowledged that the sphere of copyright in file formats is a developing area of law, but ultimately found that there was no serious issue to be tried on whether copyright exists in the Bitcoin file format.\n\nHe rejected permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal on the third point, but the claimant Dr. Wright can apply for permission from the higher court directly. Given his recent track record in the U.K. Court of Appeal, that seems likely.\n\nThe net result of this is that Dr. Wright\u2019s claim to the Bitcoin database and copyright in the white paper is going to get a full trial. Again, it is perhaps most notable because it is the first time that the BTC partnership as a whole\u2014which has been passing off BTC as the original Bitcoin for some time\u2014will be brought to collectively answer for their activities.\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "title": "The Hottest Bitcoin NFTs Right Now Are CryptoPunks Clones - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin NFTs are the talk of the Web3 world right now, thanks to a new way to \u201cmint\u201d media and assets on the layer-1 blockchain through the Ordinals project. And, as with many past NFT network launches, cloned versions of Ethereum\u2019s early and influential CryptoPunks are dominating the early buzz around Ordinals.\n\nCryptoPunks, created by Larva Labs in 2017, is a seminal NFT project that set the template for the modern profile picture (PFP) trend. The 10,000 Ethereum assets were initially released via a free mint, well before there was a thriving NFT market, but have gone on to generate almost $2.5 billion worth of trading volume in the years since.\n\nOrdinals just launched on the Bitcoin blockchain in late January, but there are already multiple CryptoPunks-inspired projects gaining steam on the platform.\n\nThe most prominent so far is Ordinal Punks, which spans 100-pixel avatars that have been \u201cinscribed\u201d on Bitcoin through the Ordinals project and can be traded. Unlike some Punks clones seen in the past, however, they're not direct clones of the original CryptoPunks collection.\n\nSome on Crypto Twitter believe that Ordinal Punks is based on a derivative Ethereum collection called Mutant Punks\u2014in other words, a derivative of a derivative. However, a person connected to the project clarified to Decrypt that Ordinal Punks \"used an open-source algorithm and CC0 Punk sprite sheet to generate new Punks.\"\n\nOne Ordinal Punk sold for 9.5 BTC late Wednesday, or nearly $215,000. While that\u2019s about double the entry-level price for a real CryptoPunk\u2014about 64 ETH right now, or nearly $106,000\u2014that particular Ordinal Punk is based on the very rare alien CryptoPunks, which have sold for as much as nearly $24 million worth of ETH in the past.\n\nStory continues\n\n12 years ago I was mining Bitcoin on a gaming PC in my parent's basement. Today, we just minted out the first 10k NFT collection on Bitcoin. Thanks to everyone, but most importantly the @cryptopunksnfts. \u2764\ufe0f@Bitcoin_Punks_ + https://t.co/3O4wIo0OYC pic.twitter.com/BV0a6KmrWj \u2014 Robert Clarke (@robertjfclarke) February 9, 2023\n\nIn another example, pseudonymous NFT collector and investor dingaling tweeted that he purchased a bundle of seven Ordinal Punks for 15.2 BTC on Wednesday\u2014about $349,000 worth at the time.\n\nHowever, because Ordinals just launched and they function differently than typical NFTs on other platforms (like Ethereum and Solana), there isn\u2019t much infrastructure to support buying and selling the assets once they\u2019ve been described. In other words, there aren\u2019t Bitcoin NFT marketplaces for Ordinals just yet.\n\nIn fact, such trades are currently taking place over the counter (OTC) directly between users or through escrow services, with asking prices and bids being tracked via online spreadsheets. It\u2019s all being facilitated through Twitter and Discord as collectors vie for these Punk clones, as some expect these early Bitcoin \u201cinscriptions\u201d to prove more and more valuable over time.\n\nnew opensea competitor lookin sharp pic.twitter.com/pJH0fuRnYm \u2014 113 \u2656\u2656\u2656 (@0x113d) February 8, 2023\n\n\u201cThere's [a] real moment behind Ordinals and things are still very very early. There are opportunities everywhere,\u201d dingaling tweeted. \u201cOrderbooks are currently updated on shared spreadsheets and sales are only done via OTC/escrow. But there's lots of building being done behind the scenes.\u201d\n\nHowever, the lack of infrastructure means that the current trading model is susceptible to scams, and some Crypto Twitter users have raised the alarm. One viral thread from pseudonymous NFT collector TheNorwegian called out various perceived issues with the collection, and asked whether it's the \"biggest NFT scam of all time.\"\n\nAnother notable Ordinals project is Bitcoin Punks, which puts replicas of all 10,000 original CryptoPunks on Bitcoin. It\u2019s billed as the first 10,000-piece NFT project launched through Ordinals, and all of the assets have already been minted for free by collectors.\n\nWith 11,000 NFTs Minted to Bitcoin, Are Bitcoin Maxis Coming Around?\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear how much trading demand there is for the larger Bitcoin Punks collection at this point, however, and a moderator on the project\u2019s official Discord server warned holders today to \u201cbe careful trading\u201d before a code audit can be completed.\n\nOrdinals use has surged over the last few days, with data platform Dune showing over 17,000 mints on the platform already today\u2014double yesterday\u2019s total, continuing a trend that has exploded over the last week-plus. More than 39,000 assets have now been inscribed as Ordinals, including other knockoffs and a playable clone of the classic video game Doom.\n\nHowever, the project has proven controversial with some Bitcoin maximalists and enthusiasts, some of whom have argued that it\u2019s a waste of network space or that it goes against Bitcoin\u2019s original focus on financial assets. Bitcoin transaction fees have surged over the last week and a half since Ordinals started gaining steam.\n\nCryptoPunks clones are common on NFT protocols that have emerged after Ethereum, and you can find them all over the place\u2014on Solana, Polygon, Cardano, Algorand, and even Stacks, a \u201clayer 1.5\u201d network built on top of Bitcoin.\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to clarify the origins of the Ordinal Punks designs."

        "title": "Ordinal NFTs: Are Bitcoin NFTs the Hottest New Trend? - NFTevening.com",
        "content": "Bitcoin NFTs are all the rage right now, due to the launch and massive success of the \u2018Ordinals\u2019 protocol. Ordinals provide a novel way to mint NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain. The latest rise in the Bitcoin assets is due to the launch of the Bitcoins equivalent CryptoPunks (Ethereum-based NFT) collection. Although all the buzz and hype is met with mixed reactions from the web3 community. So, what are Bitcoin Ordinals? Find out more below\n\nWhat are Ordinal NFTs on Bitcoin?\n\nOn January 21, software engineer Casey Rodarmor launched the Ordinals protocol on the Bitcoin blockchain. Each Bitcoin can be broken down into 100,000,000 units termed \u201csats\u201d (short for Satoshi). This new protocol allows users and builders to inscribe each \u2018sat\u2019 with data, known as Ordinals. This data can also be smart contracts, and hence NFTs can be minted on them. In essence, the Ordinal protocol allows builders to create NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nMoreover, one of the core distinctions between Ethereum-based NFTs and Bitcoin is that Ethereum NFTs usually point to off-chain data on the IPFS system. With this protocol, all the data is inscribed on-chain. \u201cAn Ordinal is intended to reflect what NFTs should be, sometimes are, and what inscriptions always are, by their very nature,\u201d says Rodarmor. This new ecosystem may be a boon to the NFT industry overall, improving upon the very concept of digital collectibles. To add to this, due to the entirely on-chain inscription of data for Ordinals, Rodarmor refers to them as something beyond NFTs, calling them Digital Artifacts.\n\nHow Will Ordinal Punk NFTs Change the Game?\n\nIn many ways, Ordinal Punks means a new wave of Bitcoin NFTs, digital collectibles, and marketplaces. The 100-pixel pfp avatars are tradeable digital artifacts inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain. The project is allegedly a clone of a derivative project \u201cMutant Punks\u201d, a clone of the original CryptoPunks on Ethereum. Though founder Rodarmor claims that the project uses \u201can open-source algorithm and CC0 Punk sprite sheet to generate new Punks.\u201d\n\nThe entire 10K collection is already off the shelf, with one Ordinal Punk (#620) selling for 9.6 BTC (~$214,766.50). However, one of the problems with the project at the moment is that there simply isn\u2019t a marketplace to buy and sell the crypto art once minted. But this, of course, does not stop the web3 community from buying and selling the digital pieces.\n\nMore than 40,000 Ordinals have been inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain so far. There has also been a backlash against the whole protocol by Bitcoin maximalists. According to them, the whole idea of Bitcoin NFTs are against Bitcoin as a financial asset. Some even claim the Ordinals are just a waste of network space.\n\nHow to Actually Buy Bitcoin NFTs?\n\nTo buy an Ordinal NFT, one must first download a Bitcoin compatible wallet. Once done, the user then has to follow a detailed GitHub guide to make the BTC wallet compatible to Ordinals. After this, the user must run their own Bitcoin node and inscribe an ordinal (which wouldn\u2019t be possible now since the project is minted out). So there are two other options available for people to purchase a BTC Ordinal NFT.\n\nThe simple way is to find an Ordinal owner and purchase it from them. Owners can be found on the official Discord server. Navigating to the link-your-project channel on their discord allows users to explore what Bitcoin projects are out there. This is, obvious to say, a huge risk to potential customers, as the sites and discords may be completely botched. Moreover, unless there is a trust between project buyers and sellers, it may lead to scams and frauds. Moreover, BTC Ordinals may take hours or even days before they show up inside your BTC wallet.\n\nMoving on, if one wishes to create/inscribe an Ordinal themselves, there are services out there that allow for this. The services allow users to inscribe them without actually running a node themselves. For example, popular Bitcoin project Satoshibles have created an Ordinal Bot, that allows users to inscribe NFTs to their Bitcoin wallets."

        "content": "In this article, we will examine some of the different cryptocurrencies and their fundamentals to predict whether their price will go up to the moon, or plummet to rock bottom. We will look at Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Big Eyes Coin (BIG).\n\nThough it is impossible to guess with certainty the price of many different cryptocurrencies, what we can do is look at the fundamentals of the cryptocurrencies and their price movements in the past to try to predict their potential price movements in the future.\n\nBitcoin: The Original Cryptocurrency\n\nBitcoin is becoming more and more popular as an investment choice because of its long-term development potential as a store of value. Having been released in 2009, Bitcoin has grown to become the most valuable cryptocurrency. Due to its potential for substantial long-term financial gains, many view Bitcoin as a promising long-term investment.\n\nBitcoin is very tempting for investors because it is decentralised, which means that no single body has authority over it or the ability to change its value. This makes it a viable replacement for traditional investments, which are frequently subject to influences like those of the government.\n\nFrom its price movements in the past, we can see Bitcoin continuing its upward momentum in the long term. Though volatility is to be expected, in the long run, Bitcoin is likely to outlast the rest of the competition, being one of the original cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum: Digital Silver\n\nInvestors are increasingly turning to Ethereum (ETH) as a viable investment choice. With good cause, too! Ethereum provides a secure, decentralised framework for building blockchain applications. Smart contracts can run on the platform, giving it a lot of utility in the blockchain space, and allowing developers to build dApps (decentralised applications) on the platform.\n\nIt is a popular choice for investors looking to diversify their portfolios since it provides several advantages and features.\n\nEthereum is likely to maintain its position as one of cryptocurrency\u2019s leaders due to its low transaction costs, rapid transaction speeds, and tremendous scalability. Aside from better security, increased returns on investment, and improved liquidity, investing in Ethereum can provide investors with several benefits.\n\nIn the future, Ethereum is most likely to maintain its position as one of the leading cryptocurrencies, and we can see its price retaining a steady position in keeping with Bitcoin.\n\nBig Eyes Coin: The New Meme Coin King?\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) is one of the hottest new meme coins on the market right now. It has raised $24.5 million and counting!\n\nIt was developed on the Ethereum network and works to raise consumer awareness of the DeFi market while promoting DeFi to boost the amount of money coming into the DeFi ecosystem.One of Big Eyes Coin\u2019s key goals is protecting the seas. To benefit organisations that promote ocean conservation, Big Eyes Coin retains 5% of all tokens in an open charity wallet.\n\nWant to carry out your price prediction? On the Big Eyes Coin website, there is a calculator to look at your potential ROI if you invested now and what your returns could be if Big Eyes Coin increased in price!\n\nWe can easily see this coin skyrocketing, as it already has an incredible amount of momentum, and it champions a social cause that people are looking to get involved in.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThough no price prediction is certain, we can see all of these coins increasing in value due to their solid fundamentals and promising communities built around their respective cryptocurrencies. As always, ensure that you carry out thorough research before investing in any asset. Happy investing!\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "What Is Bitcoin Bank? Bitcoin Bank Review for Canada\n\nBTC Bank is one of the numerous cryptocurrency robots that operate in the cryptocurrency industry, promising profits to account holders who invest their money into Bitcoin. The automated trading platform claims to use trading bots powered by AI technology to make trades with the funds you deposit into your account. This technology reportedly scans crypto exchanges and monitors market trends to find smart investments.\n\nThe aim of trading apps such as the Bitcoin Bank app is to buy Bitcoin at a low price and sell it for a profit later.\n\nHowever, while cryptocurrency is still in its infancy and the market is still very volatile, Bitcoin Bank app encourages you to try auto crupto trading in a bid to open a whole new avenue of investment properties.\n\nThe concept behind the platform is relatively simple. On the surface, you do not need any prior knowledge of Bitcoin to start investing your money in the market. However, while the company infers that a Bitcoin investment can be life-changing, the truth is far more complicated \u2014 particularly when automatic trading is concerned. For starters, this type of trading is very high-risk, especially when you cannot verify the reputability of Bitcoin Bank\u2019s partnered brokers.\n\nNote that the dollar figures in this review refer to USD and not Canadian dollars. This is because the amounts specified by the app are in USD, and Canadian users' funds will automatically be converted to USD based on the existing exchange rate.\n\nBitcoin Bank Overview\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Robot Type: Auto Trading Robot \ud83d\udcb8 Minimum Deposit: $250 \u2705 Is It a Scam or Legit? Legit \ud83d\ude80 Claimed Win Rate: 88% \ud83d\udcb0 Trading Fees: None \ud83d\udcb0 Account Fees: None \ud83d\udcb0 Deposit/Withdrawal Fees: None \ud83d\udcb0 Software cost: Free \u231b Withdrawal Timeframe: 24 Hours \ud83d\udcb1 Supported Cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, XRP \ud83d\udcb2 Supported Fiats: USD, EUR, GBP \ud83d\udcca Leverage: 1000:1 \ud83d\udcf1 Native Mobile App: No \ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Free Demo Account: Yes \ud83c\udfa7 Customer Support: Email, Live chat \u2705 Verification required: KYC \ud83d\udd01 Automated Trading: Yes \ud83d\udcc8 CFD Available Yes\n\nPros and Cons of Using BTC Bank\n\nPros Low deposit of $250\n\nDemo account and video tutorials available\n\nNo service charges\n\nAvailable in countries that allow Bitcoin trading\n\n24/7 customer support Cons Withdrawing funds is difficult\n\nAuto trading bots are very risky\n\nSome testimonials and reviews are fake\n\nWhat is the Bitcoin Bank Team?\n\nThe Bitcoin Bank team consists of professional traders and experienced software developers. We couldn't find the specific names of the owners, however.\n\nGetting Started With Bitcoin Bank\n\nIf you are a beginner in the cryptocurrency market, you probably are wondering how to get started with Bitcoin Bank app. Do not fret because the bot is user-friendly and designed to be used by both new entrants and experienced traders in the cryptocurrency market. Take a look below at our brief overview of how to start. Remember, the bot is connected to regulated brokers, so ensure you choose the best-suited broker for your needs before starting.\n\nRegister for a Trading Account. Deposit funds with your broker. Customize your trades, buying points, selling points, etc., and start trading.\n\nBitcoin Bank Markets, Assets, and Options\n\nWhat cryptocurrencies and products can you trade using Bitcoin Bank?\n\nThis trading robot is specifically tailored for digital assets, meaning you can\u2019t use it for assets like forex, stocks, commodities, and so on. Therefore, if you diversify your portfolio with assets from different markets, consider other bots. For traders and investors in the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin Bank offers trading options for some of the most popular cryptocurrencies. The full list will be determined based on the broker that you choose to use.\n\nWhat leverage trading options are there with Bitcoin Bank?\n\nDuring our research for this review, we could not find any conclusive information on the leverage trading options on the Bitcoin Bank platform. However, if the service is like other auto traders, you should expect potential leverages of 1000:1 at least. While this may seem like an enticing proposition, most regulated brokers would never offer such massive leverage options. Therefore, if you intend to sign up, you should be wary of exceptionally high leverage percentages.\n\nConfused about using BTC Bank? Allow us to explain.\n\nWhen a broker offers leverage to invest in Bitcoin, they are effectively giving you a loan. For example, say the broker provides a 1000:1 leverage option. If you invest a minimum deposit of $250, you\u2019ll be loaned $250,000 for Bitcoin investments. Essentially, you are borrowing a large sum of money in a bid to earn a significant profit. However, you need to remember that automatic trading comes with plenty of risks, and it\u2019s a very unreliable way of trading at the best of times. Therefore, when you add in the astronomical leverage, you may prefer to look for alternative investment methods that offer more control over your funds.\n\nWhat are the spreads on Bitcoin Bank?\n\nDue to the volatility of the BTC market, you can expect the buying and selling price of cryptocurrency to fluctuate every day. That being said, different brokers will offer you different deals, all of which will have varying pip values.\n\nFees, Limits, and Payment Options on Bitcoin Bank\n\nHow much does Bitcoin Bank cost?\n\nBesides offering free trade automation services, BTC Bank has deposit bonuses you can enjoy from time to time. Signing up for an account with it is also free, and there are no subscription charges. You should test it out via its demo account to ensure it aligns with your trading or investment requirements.\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Minimum Deposit: $250 \ud83d\udcb0 Trading Fees: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Account Fees: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Deposit/Withdrawal Fees: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Software cost: zero \ud83d\udcb0 Subscription cost: Zero\n\nWhat are the payment methods accepted by Bitcoin Bank?\n\nThere are several alternative payment methods for trading with Bitcoin bank. These include:\n\nPayPal\n\nMastercard\n\nVisa\n\nAnd more\n\nDoes Bitcoin Bank also charge fees and commissions?\n\nAs we have stated in this Bitcoin Bank review, it does not charge any registration fees when you become a user. Also, you will not face any service charges when you place your initial deposit into your account. However, you can expect the platform to take a small commission of any profits you earn through it.\n\nBitcoin Bank trade sizes and limits\n\nLike many other auto crypto traders, BTC Bank has set a minimum deposit limit of $250 to purchase cryptocurrency. Interestingly, the platform offers zero information on the maximum trading limit. As such, you can assume that you can invest as much as you can feasibly afford. However, as we have said in this Bitcoin Bank review, automatic trading is an unreliable way to invest in Bitcoin and comes with plenty of risks. Therefore, if you are thinking of using an auto trader, we strongly advise keeping to the minimum deposit limit.\n\nBitcoin Bank Platform\n\nHow does Bitcoin Bank work?\n\nThis is an trading bot system that reportedly utilizes AI technology to invest user funds into the Bitcoin market and hopefully make a profitable return.\n\nBTC Bank claims to use AI bots to find cheap Bitcoin shares. Then the platform will prompt you to invest in those shares, or if you have selected the auto trade setting, it will purchase the shares for you. BTC Bank will then hold these investments and send you a message to make a substantial profit. Sounds easy, right? Well, it also sounds too good to be true. Nevertheless, the platform seems to be an excellent way to make extra money. However, trading bot is undeniably risky and often ineffective, which means you are likely to lose your money rather than earn a profit.\n\nOn the Bitcoin Bank website, they suggest that your auto trading investments can have numerous benefits on your life, but we could not find many trustworthy testimonials or reviews that supported these claims. While bots can scour the crypto market much faster than human traders, we would not wholly trust them to help you earn a profit. There is a good chance you will not see a return on your investment given the nature of auto trading.\n\nWhat devices can I use Bitcoin Bank on?\n\nYou can use this platform on any device that can connect to Wi-Fi and access an internet browser. This includes:\n\nSmartphones\n\nTablets\n\nDesktop Browsers\n\nCan I Use Bitcoin Bank in My Country?\n\nCountry Is Bitcoin Bank available? United Kingdom No Canada Yes Australia Yes USA No South Africa Yes New Zealand Yes Philippines Yes United Arab Emirates Yes Singapore Yes France Yes Spain Yes Italy Yes Germany Yes Nigeria Yes Mexico Yes\n\nWhich exchanges and brokers does Bitcoin Bank partner with?\n\nUnfortunately, for this Bitcoin Bank review, we found it difficult to zero in on any concrete information regarding the brokers and exchanges partnered with Bitcoin Bank. That being said, you should remember that high leverage rates are a strong indicator that brokers are probably unregulated and, therefore, less likely to help you earn a profit.\n\nIs Bitcoin Bank available in my language?\n\nBTC Bank is available in numerous languages. Unfortunately, the language will be automatically assigned to you based on your geographical location. You can expect to view Bitcoin Bank in:\n\nEnglish\n\nGerman\n\nSpanish\n\nItalian and more\n\nHow easy is it to use Bitcoin Bank?\n\nRegarding the app itself, BTC Bank is straightforward to navigate. The user interface is relatively minimal and sleek. Account registration is speedy, but that is probably because the company wants you to deposit your funds and get trading. If you are confused by the Bitcoin Bank platform, you can use a demo account to practise making trades without spending any real money.\n\nHow much profit can you make using Bitcoin Bank?\n\nBTC Bank automates trades and investments to attempt to maximize your success potential. However, the trading bot doesn't guarantee profits, and it is crucial to take measures to mitigate the risks in the crypto market. If you are new to the market, conduct thorough market research and develop a solid trading strategy that you are comfortable with and that allows you to control your spending. This is so that you can easily follow up on the bot\u2019s performance and take advantage of potentially profitable market trends the robot misses out on.\n\nRemember, the profits you earn with BTC Bank depend on your input. Since the robot has a leverage of 1000:1, you can make more than your invested capital, up to $1,000 daily. That being said, always calculate your potential profits before you begin trading/investing, and consider your tax deductions to the CRA.\n\nBitcoin Bank Key Features\n\nBitcoin Bank offers numerous features on the platform to stand out to new users. These include:\n\nCustomer Support: In preparation for this review, we found that the customer support side of BTC Bank is very attentive. When you create your account, you\u2019ll be contacted by a representative immediately to finalize your registration. If you miss their call, you can expect them to try your number repeatedly until you complete the sign-up process. You can also contact BTC Bank by e-mail or live chat.\n\nLow Deposit: One of the most advertised Bitcoin Bank features is their low minimum deposit of $250. But, of course, they do not tell you the high leverage options required to afford Bitcoin with such a small deposit.\n\nDemo Account: As we have already stated, Bitcoin Bank allows you to try out a demo version of the app, which has all the features of the live trading crypto experience, but you do not use your funds, eliminating any risk.\n\nBitcoin Bank Security and Regulation\n\nIs Bitcoin Bank legit?\n\nWe found plenty of Bitcoin Bank reviews online during our research, though many of them were obvious fabrications designed to direct traffic towards the site. Also, the high leverage options make you wonder how many BTC Bank partnered brokers are regulated. In our experience, regulated brokers and exchanges do not offer astronomical leverage options.\n\nThere have also been some reports that Bitcoin Bank makes it very difficult to withdraw your funds. Details can be found here.\n\nIs Bitcoin Bank safe?\n\nBTC Bank is technically safe in regard to your personal information being protected by SSL encryption. However, due to the issues surrounding the problematic withdrawal process and the large amount of risk involved with leveraged trades, we cannot guarantee that your funds will be safe and that you will make a profit.\n\nAre my money and I protected?\n\nOverall, Bitcoin Bank is highly encrypted and aims to ensure your email and data are protected from hackers.\n\nIs Bitcoin Bank regulated?\n\nThis is difficult to say. We found little information regarding regulated exchanges and brokers on the Bitcoin Bank website. However, as we have stated, we recommend that you avoid any broker that offers obscenely high leverage on your deposit, as they will most likely be unregulated. The best crypto trader regulators are the CySec, FCA, ASIC, and FSB. Look for any of these authorities before conducting business with any trader.\n\nDo I have to verify my account with Bitcoin Bank?\n\nYes, when you create your account, you\u2019ll need to provide documents and verify your identity and address. Then you can use your BTC Bank login.\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Bank Work? Trading Strategies and Algorithms\n\nBitcoin Bank is AI-powered, which uses trading signals and algorithms to monitor the cryptocurrency market and trade on your behalf based on potentially profitable market trends it picks. The robot is designed for high--speed performance; no wonder it gains excellent reviews and testimonials from users. Bitcoin Bank has a claimed win rate of 88%, but like any trading product, it doesn't guarantee successful trades. It does, however, improve its chances of success due to the following features.\n\nAutomated Trading Tools\n\nArbitrage Trading\n\nReactive News Trading\n\nPrice Trend Analysis\n\nExtra Information About Bitcoin Bank\n\nEducational Resources\n\nTraders and crypto investors can also learn more about cryptocurrency trading from website blogs, podcasts, and YouTube channels. All these resources are free, but you can pay for financial advisors\u2019 services should you require extra guidance.\n\nBitcoin Bank comes with plenty of charts and metrics to show you the Bitcoin market projections. You can also set parameters to narrow your searches to better search for traders and exchanges.\n\nCustomer Support\n\nBitcoin Bank Customer Support Details Support email Not available Support contact number Not available Live chat option Yes Other support options Online Form\n\nDemo Account\n\nBitcoin Bank has a demo account to test its features and gauge your skill level before venturing into the live market using real money. The demo account is risk-free, but you must make a minimum deposit of $250 to use it. It is the best platform to get started with, especially if you are entering the crypto space with zero experience.\n\nHow to get started with Bitcoin Bank? 3 simple steps\n\nBelow you\u2019ll find a list of steps to help you get started with Bitcoin Bank:\n\nStep 1 - Register\n\nRegistration is a relatively quick and painless process. Simply input your details, and you\u2019ll be contacted by a representative who will see you through the verification procedure.\n\nStep 2 - Make a Deposit\n\nOnce you have created your Bitcoin Bank account, you need to pay a deposit of $250 to trade for Bitcoin. You can deposit more funds if you prefer, though we strongly recommend that you stick to the minimum.\n\nStep 3 - Begin to Live Trade\n\nIf you\u2019ve completed the above steps, you are ready to start trading crypto on Bitcoin Bank.\n\nHow to delete the Bitcoin Bank account?\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Bitcoin Bank is connected to regulated brokers. Therefore, to delete it, go to its menu at the top corner of the page and access the settings command to initiate the process. Alternatively, you can delete your Bitcoin Bank account by deleting your account with the broker. However, you will also lose your data with that broker. Do not start the process of deletion if you are not certain about how you want to go about it. Instead, contact its customer care for guidance.\n\nHow to withdraw money from Bitcoin Bank?\n\nBitcoin Bank does not have a cryptocurrency wallet for storing your assets and earnings. The brokers it is connected with do the storing, meaning that your funds can only be accessed through the brokers. Below is the procedure for withdrawing your money earned from Bitcoin Bank's automated trades and investments.\n\nVisit a Bitcoin Bank\u2019s connected broker\u2019s platform and sign into your trading/investment account. Go to your wallet, whereby you should click withdraw to start the withdrawal process. Enter your preferred payment method, whether PayPal or bank. Enter an amount to withdraw. Click continue to initiate the withdrawal process, which should take up to 24 hours to complete.\n\nRemember, most cryptocurrency brokers do not accept payouts in crypto assets, and that is why Bitcoin Bank supports various fiat currencies to streamline the withdrawal process. Therefore, choose your preferred fiat currency to successfully withdraw your funds.\n\nBitcoin Bank Celebrity/Company Endorsements\n\nYou have probably come across online reviews claiming that top celebrities or companies endorse Bitcoin Bank.

BTC was trading between $22,900 and $23,100. Despite a 1.4 percent decrease in the last 24 hours, Bitcoin has still seen a 38 percent increase this year. The second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, is following a similar pattern as Bitcoin, with a 1.8 percent decrease in the last 24 hours.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin said, \u201cThe cryptocurrency market is witnessing a bullish trend as Bitcoin (BTC) formed a \u201cgolden cross\u201d with its 50-day SMA moving above the 200-day SMA, signalling a positive shift in market momentum. While the BTC/USD pair may face resistance near $23,250, the trend remains positive with the potential to reach $23,500. Traders are advised to closely monitor market developments and consider taking advantage of this positive trend.\u201d\n\nKunji founder Anurag Dixit offered his take, \u201cLayoffs and restructuring don't seem to slow down anytime soon. The multitude of data points released in the last two weeks and the number of points coming next week will keep the market volatility high. The ongoing restructurings denote the continued extreme macroeconomic uncertainty. While the markets have rallied since the start of the year, sustainable developments are what matter the most.\"\n\nShivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, \u201cThe crypto market is showing cautious optimism as the US Fed chief has hinted that it may be winning the war against inflation and the disinflationary process has begun. The market immediately responded to the positive development and touched the $1.09 trillion market cap. BTC is up by 1.72 percent and crossed the $23,000 mark while Ethereum is up by a staggering 3 percent and is exchanging hands at the $1,680 level. The current momentum is expected to continue if macroeconomic factors remain favourable.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "title": "We asked ChatGPT to explain Bitcoin like a 1920s mobster; The result is hilarious - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "The text-based artificial intelligence (AI) platform ChatGPT is all the rage these days, as people are discovering they can use it for writing all sorts of things, including jokes, poems, stories, predictions on cryptocurrency prices, or even to explain Bitcoin (BTC) as would, for instance, a 1920s mobster.\n\nIndeed, to bring some light after the most recent blow to the crypto sphere in the form of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) forcing the crypto trading platform Kraken to shut down its staking services in the U.S., Finbold asked ChatGPT to explain Bitcoin in the style of a mobster from the 1920s.\n\nAs it happens, the AI did a very good job, deploying the vocabulary, phrasing, content, and sentence style that resembles that of the movies and shows featuring organized crime syndicates from the \u2018roaring twenties\u2019 era that marked the American landscape at the time.\n\nTelling it like a mobster\n\nFirst, ChatGPT artfully introduced the topic, making it difficult not to read the text in a 1920s gangster voice:\n\n\u201cAlright boss, let me break it down for you. Bitcoin is like this stash of cash we got hidden away, see. Only instead of being in a physical place like a safety deposit box, it\u2019s all digital, get it? And just like regular money, you can use it to buy things, but there\u2019s a few key differences.\u201d\n\nLike a skillful storyteller, the AI continued to explain the main benefits of this kind of money, using relatable and simple terms for a mobster:\n\n\u201cFirst off, it\u2019s completely anonymous. No one knows who\u2019s makin\u2019 the transactions, which makes it a pretty sweet setup for us. Second, it\u2019s decentralized, which means there ain\u2019t no one person or bank in charge of it, it\u2019s all run by the people usin\u2019 it, get it? And the best part? It\u2019s completely untraceable. No government, no bank, no one can track where the bitcoins are comin\u2019 from or where they\u2019re going. It\u2019s like we\u2019re runnin\u2019 our own little shadow economy.\u201d\n\nFinally, in the manner of a careful 1920s mobster, ChatGPT warns his imaginary boss about the importance of understanding the potential risks of dealing with Bitcoin, while at the same time reiterating its advantages:\n\n\u201cNow, the value of a bitcoin can change just like the stock market, so you gotta keep an eye on it. But if you play your cards right, you could end up with a real nice payout. Just remember, it\u2019s a risky game and you gotta be careful, or you could end up losin\u2019 everything.\u201d\n\nConclusion\n\nDespite the comedic value of having ChatGPT role-play as a crook from the beginning of the last century while describing a very modern concept, its educational purpose can easily be recognized as well, thanks to the humorous and simple approach to explaining Bitcoin to someone who knows nothing about it."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is again under pressure as the leading cryptocurrency sank to a four-week low below $22,000. This decline follows Bitcoin\u2019s impressive performance in January, during which BTC rose about 40% since the beginning of the year, leading some to predict a fresh bull run.\n\nFinbold has analyzed the potential performance of BTC on Valentine\u2019s Day using artificial intelligence (AI) to see if any more significant price moves could be on the cards ahead of the holiday after the recent drop in the wake of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announcing a settlement with cryptocurrency exchange Kraken for alleged securities laws violations.\n\nIn particular, the machine learning algorithms at the crypto monitoring platform PricePredictions have projected the price of BTC will trade at $21,632 on February 14, 2023, according to the data retrieved on February 10.\n\nBTC 7-day forecast. Source: PricePredictions\n\nThe AI aggregates the latest technical analysis (TA) indicators, including moving averages (MA), the moving average convergence divergence (MACD), relative strength index (RSI), Bollinger Bands (BB), and more, to come to the price estimate for Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin technical analysis\n\nBitcoin sentiment via TradingView\u2019s technical analysis indicators on 1-day gauges, is rather bearish, with the summary pointing at a \u2018sell\u2019 at 9, as summarized from oscillators being in the \u2018neutral\u2019 zone at 8, and moving averages suggesting \u2018sell\u2019 at 8.\n\nBTC 1-day technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin is changing hands at $0.388, down 2.35% in the last 24 hours and down a further 3.94% across the previous seven days. A support level exists at $21,249, while the next significant resistance level is located at $22,649.\n\nBTC 1-day chart. Source: Finbold\n\nIn total, $40 billion has fled the crypto market cap in a day as anxiety grows over SEC\u2019s actions. After agreeing to pay a $30 million fine to resolve the accusations with the SEC, the Kraken decided to shut down its staking services in the United States.\n\nAdditionally, the SEC accused the cryptocurrency exchange of marketing unregistered securities, which led to enormous withdrawals from the market cap of cryptocurrencies with $18 billion leaving Bitcoin\u2019s market cap which currently stands at $419 billion.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Traders are reminded of a major development in the cryptocurrency world. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong expressed concerns about the possible elimination of cryptocurrency staking for retail clients by the SEC.\n\nLater, it was announced that Kraken, one of the longest-running crypto exchanges, reached a $30 million settlement with the SEC on the issue.\n\nIn recent hours, information has also emerged regarding regulators\u2019 persecution of large centralized stablecoin issuers.\n\nThese events come shortly after the White House\u2019s statement regarding its concerns about cryptocurrencies. Ironic situation when considering that several US regulators in recent years have received funding from the FTX exchange, and now find the future of cryptocurrencies in their hands.\n\nFunding that after the exchange goes bankrupt could be part of the bankruptcy recovery action and be returned.\n\nScrolling down the Top 30 list, only one green sign stands out.\n\nIt is that of Polygon (MATIC), which from last Friday\u2019s levels is registering a rise that exceeds 6%. The token, which plays an important role in the Polygon platform ecosystem, is on its way to ending its 6th consecutive upward week. After about 10 months, the MATIC digital token recovers $1.3, gaining more than 70% since the beginning of the year.\n\nAnalysis of Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nAfter sustained gains in January, Bitcoin (BTC) is set to close the week down for the 2nd consecutive time, with prices hovering around $21,800.\n\nShould these levels hold until Sunday\u2019s close, there would be a decline from the $22,900 with which the week began.\n\nScenario that should not surprise readers of these pages who follow the cryptocurrency market. As hypothesized in my last update published on Tuesday, an imminent close of the monthly cycle, expected between the end of this week and the beginning of next week, was being reported, which would be characterized by a continuation of the bearish trend.\n\nThe cyclical structure is taking shape confirming a final phase of a major cycle, such as the monthly cycle, in which prices are subject to downturns.\n\nHowever, the presence of an ongoing monthly cycle and its conclusion could be an important factor to consider when analyzing future market trends.\n\nTechnically, it is important that any continuation of the descent does not push prices too far down and in any case below $20,600. This level coincides with the last valid support built in mid-January during the last bullish run.\n\nEthereum (ETH) performance\n\nThe move backwards brings Ethereum (ETH) prices back to test the crucial $1,520 USD support. A level that has been an opportunity for a rebound several times since mid-January.\n\nRebounds that have been unsupported by new buying that has so far failed to confirm momentum beyond the $1,620 resistance, previous to the November highs.\n\nOver the weekend, it is important for ETH to confirm the holding of current support. A breakout of $1,500 could result in the stimulation of bearish speculation that would find space for a descent down to the $1,420 USD area, caused by the lack of validly built supports during the last ascent in January.\n\nIn the coming days or weeks, only an overtaking of $1,650 accompanied by volumes would create the conditions for a new bullish extension with the next target in the $1,750 USD area."
