        "title": "If U.S. defaults on debt Bitcoin could rise nearly 70%, says Standard Chartered analyst - Fortune",
        "content": "Bitcoin bulls have had a good year so far. If the U.S. defaults on its debt, it could get even better, at least in terms of their Bitcoin investment.\n\nThat\u2019s according to Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered\u2019s head of digital assets research. He told Insider this week that a U.S. default\u2014which he called a \u201clow-probability, high-impact event\u201d\u2014could cause Bitcoin to jump by about $20,000, an increase of nearly 70% from current levels.\n\nBitcoin started the year at well below $17,000 but is now hovering near $30,000. That\u2019s still well off its all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November 2021, and some investors who bought Bitcoin around then are no doubt still licking their wounds.\n\nBitcoin, Kendrick predicted, would fare well even if overall cryptocurrencies, which trade more like stocks, did not. \u201cSo actually, the optimal trade would probably be long Bitcoin, short Ethereum. That sort of mix would probably be a good expression of this,\u201d Kendrick told Insider.\n\nOn Monday, Kendrick said in a note that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 by the end of 2024 and the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d was over. He added that Bitcoin has benefited from its status as a \u201cbranded safe haven, a perceived relative store of value and a means of remittance.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price shot up earlier this year after Silicon Valley Bank collapsed and fears of a banking crisis mounted.\n\nMeanwhile the debt ceiling crisis has intensified. On Wednesday, House Republicans passed legislation (barely) that would raise the government\u2019s debt ceiling in exchange for spending restrictions. In the weeks ahead, they\u2019ll try to reach a compromise with President Joe Biden that would allow the nation\u2019s debt to be lifted.\n\nIf the U.S. did default on its debt this summer, the consequences would be severe for America and the world. Last month, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned lawmakers that \u201ca default on our debt would trigger an economic and financial catastrophe.\u201d\n\nFew think it will come to that.\n\nBut even without a U.S. default, many Bitcoin bulls see good things ahead. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood said in February that in five years Bitcoin will hit \u201croughly $670,000, something like that, and then by 2030, as we see more use cases and more of these insurance policies taken out against fiscal and policy regimes that are not healthy, we think it could pass $1 million.\u201d\n\nBitcoin has plenty of critics and doubters, of course. Mark Mobius, the billionaire cofounder of Mobius Capital Partners, predicted in December that Bitcoin would fall to $10,000 at some point this year. He has said of Bitcoin, \u201cIt\u2019s not an investment, it\u2019s a religion.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett reiterated his long-running skepticism. \u201cSomething like Bitcoin, it is a gambling token, and it doesn\u2019t have any intrinsic value,\u201d he told CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t stop people from wanting to play the roulette wheel.\u201d"

That sort of mix would probably be a good expression of this,\" Kendrick said.\n\nIf Congress fails to lift the $31.4 trillion federal debt limit, a default could come sometime in the summer \u2014 an event that could cause seismic ruptures global markets. On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned a default would be catastrophic for the US economy, sparking mass unemployment, payment failures, and higher rates \"into perpetuity.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith House Republicans and the White House still far from a deal to raise the debt ceiling, yields on three-month Treasurys recently jumped to a 22-year high, as they would mature around a potential default date.\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin is still recovering from a massive sell-off that began in late 2021 and continued through much of 2022 as the Federal Reserve embarked on an aggressive tightening cycle.\n\nBut bitcoin has rallied nearly 80% so far in 2023 and recently neared $30,000 as First Republic Bank's woes reignited fears over the financial sector.\n\nFor his part, Kendrick is already bullish on bitcoin, saying in a note on Monday that it could surge to $100,000 by the end of 2024 due to bank turmoil, bitcoin halving, and the expected end of Fed rate hikes, among other things, though it didn't mention the risk of a US default.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"While sources of uncertainty remain, we think the pathway to the USD 100,000 level is becoming clearer,\" he wrote."

        "content": "Bitcoin edged up on Monday morning in Asia on the first trading day of May to hold above the US$29,000 mark as worries about the U.S. banking system resurfaced and amid bullish price forecasts for the token. Ether dipped below US$1,900, paring its 5% gain in April. Most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded lower, though Binance\u2019s BNB gained after the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange added the Sui blockchain to its Launchpool. Litecoin led the losers. U.S. equity futures traded flat to lower in Asia ahead of the Fed interest rate decision this week. All three major U.S. stock indexes logged gains for April.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin flirts with US$30,000, Ether regains US$1,900\n\nCrypto\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nBitcoin inched up 0.48% to US$29,309 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data, holding a weekly gain of 5.32%, after rising to as high as US$29,952 on Sunday.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency tested the lower US$27,000 line multiple times in April, but gained more than 4% for the month for the longest streak of monthly gains since March 2021. This could foreshadow a surge in 2023 that could send Bitcoin to US$105,000, according to a Bloomberg analyst report on Sunday.\n\nBitcoin could attract investment from global bond investors due to negative real rates and real returns, according to Jamie Coutts, a senior market structure analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nEther dipped 0.81% to US$1,884, but was trading 0.34% higher for the week. The world\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency gained over 5% for the month of April.\n\nBinance\u2019s BNB jumped 5.56% to US$339.09, logging a weekly gain of 2.05%. Binance introduced Sui blockchain\u2019s SUI token to its Launchpool on Monday, allowing Binance users to stake their BNB and TrueUSD (TUSD) to farm the recently launched SUI, whose price jumped over 20% in the past 24 hours.\n\nBNB also received a boost from Binance\u2019s return to Japan. Sakura Exchange BitCoin (SEBC), a regulated crypto exchange platform in Japan that was acquired by Binance in November 2022, will end its domestic services by the end of May and start a new service under the name \u201cBinance Japan\u201d from June 2023, according to a notice by SEBC on Friday.\n\nStory continues\n\nLitecoin led the losers, falling 2.33% to US$88.67 but adding 1.56% for the week.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization edged up 0.09% in the past 24 hours to US$1.20 trillion. The total trading volume over the last 24 hours rose 33.36% to US$32.79 billion.\n\nNFT\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index edged up 0.37% to 3,757.67 in the 24 hours to 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, but remained 0.55% lower for the week. The index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts. It is managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nMad Lads, a Solana-based NFT first minted on April 21, logged the largest seven-day sales volume across the market of over US$7.63 million, beating Bored Ape Yacht Club\u2019s (BAYC) US$7.04 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. The floor price of the NFT was 63.75 SOL as of 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, almost 10 times higher than the first token minted at 6.9 SOL.\n\nBAYC, one of the biggest NFT collections by market cap, also saw a surge in sales volume in the past 24 hours, jumping 170.22% to US$1.05 million, the largest volume across the NFT market.\n\nEquities\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded flat to lower as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures inched down 0.03%. The S&P 500 futures and the Nasdaq Composite Index both dipped 0.04%.\n\n\n\nThe three indexes closed higher last Friday on strong earnings from Intel Corp. and Exxon Mobil Corp., and logged gains for both the week and the month of April, according to Reuters on Saturday.\n\nHowever, the stock market gains last week were overshadowed by worries about the banking industry. The share price of U.S.-based First Republic Bank plunged 43.20% on Friday after the lender reported a 40.8% drop in deposits, or around US$100 billion, since the start of the year. Regulators are preparing to take over and sell the embattled bank, with multiple large financial institutions having submitted bids, according to the Wall Street Journal on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nMeanwhile in China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, the purchasing managers manufacturing index for April unexpectedly fell to 49.2 on month, missing expectations of a 51.4 gain, pointing to slower growth in the country, according to Reuters on Monday.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s next move on interest rates is due on May 3. The Fed has repeatedly raised rates over the past year to bring inflation down to its target range of 2%. With U.S. inflation still trending at around 5%, analysts at the CME Group now expect an 85.5% chance the Fed will raise rates by 25 basis points this week.\n\nU.S. interest rates are currently between 4.75% to 5%, the highest since June 2006.\n\nSee related article: Coinbase says SEC\u2019s legal threats punish transparency, undermine public listing process"

And one of the things she said on stage was that she was being stymied in her work and PepsiCo has been stymied in its work by the lack of regulatory clarity, and I thought that was interesting because obviously this is something the industry says a lot that we need to do. There are guidelines from Washington, D.C., from lawmakers and from policymakers. And we think that that conversation or that that issue only affects people in the relatively small world of crypto."

        "content": "It now costs Bitcoin (BTC) miners at least $17,000 to produce one BTC in the United States versus the $5,000\u201310,000 range a year ago, according to Bitcoin mining data resources Hashrate Index and Luxor.\n\nBitcoin hash price has dropped 58% in a year\n\nUnsurprisingly, soaring electricity rates across U.S. states have contributed to rising Bitcoin mining costs.\n\nNotably, between January 2022 and January 2023, the commercial electricity tariff surged at an average of 10.71% per U.S. state, higher than the average Consumer Price Index surge of 6.4%.\n\nAverage industrial rate rise between January 2022 and 2023. Source: EIA/Hashrate Index/Luxor\n\nCoupled with Bitcoin\u2019s downward performance in 2022, which saw a maximum drawdown from around $48,000 to below $15,000, it is evident that active miners generated consistent losses due to the increase in operational costs and lower returns.\n\nBut this changed in Q1 of 2023 as the miners\u2019 hash price, or the U.S. dollar price per terahash per second per day (TH/s/d), rose 31% thanks to Bitcoin\u2019s price recovery toward $30,000.\n\n\u201cBleak as the new year looked at the outset, the lowest day for hashprice on a USD basis in Q1 was January 1,\u201d noted researchers at Hashrate Index, adding:\n\n\u201cIt was only up from there as a 70% rise resuscitated Bitcoin\u2019s price over the quarter, and along with it, hashprice.\u201c\n\nBitcoin hash price (in the dollar terms). Source: Hashrate Index/Luxor\n\nWhich state is cheapest, most expensive to mine Bitcoin in?\n\nNew Mexico emerged as the cheapest and, in turn, more profitable state for Bitcoin miners in Q1 at $16,850 to mint one BTC. On the other hand, Hawaii was the most expensive at around $114,590.\n\nRegionally, the south and the midwestern U.S. states are the most attractive for miners regarding electricity prices.\n\nPower cost to produce 1 BTC across U.S. states. Source: EIA/Hashrate Index/Luxor\n\nMore recently, some U.S. states, including Arkansas, Montana, Missouri, Mississippi and others, have taken concrete steps to protect crypto miners from excessive taxes and regulations. On the other hand, Texas has amended its utilities and tax codes, bolstering restrictions for crypto mining companies.\n\nEnergy deflation could boost miners\u2019 profitability\n\nFurthermore, the researchers anticipate the Bitcoin mining margins to grow further based on the U.S. Energy Information Association\u2019s (EIA) expectations of energy price deflation.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin advocates rally at Texas State Capitol to oppose bill cutting mining incentives\n\nFor instance, the agency expects the demand for electricity to drop by 1% in Q2, citing additional generation from renewable sources and cheaper natural gas prices. It further anticipates that natural gas prices will remain below $3 in 2023 vs. 2022\u2019s $6.45 average.\n\nForecasts for wholesale electricity prices in the U.S. Source: Hashrate Index/Luxor/EIA\n\nBitcoin mining stocks shine\n\nLower operational costs could help otherwise cash-strapped Bitcoin mining companies survive in 2023. For example, the stock price of Core Scientific, an already bankrupt Bitcoin mining firm, has jumped over 450% year-to-date.\n\nSimilarly, the HI Crypto Mining Stock Index has soared more than 100% this year, showing a return of investor appetite for mining socks.\n\nBitcoin mining stocks performance in 2023. Source: Hashrate Index/Luxor/EIA\n\nHashrate Index researchers also stated:\n\n\u201cIf the bitcoin price was to increase by an additional 40% to reach $42k this year, most mining stocks would rise by more than 50% from today\u2019s level, while the four-to-five biggest gainers would soar by more than 150%.\u201c\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Bitcoin And Ethereum Maximalism: Silly And Self-Defeating - Blockworks",
        "content": "Maximalism is one of the least attractive philosophies in crypto.\n\nIt\u2019s the belief that any given blockchain is fit for all purposes, and that other blockchains are therefore inherently useless and of no value.\n\nThis is as dumb as it sounds.\n\nThe original maximalists were Bitcoiners, many of whom predate the era of smart contracts.\n\nAccording to Bitcoin maxis, the Bitcoin blockchain is capable of almost any functionality that later chains have added; or they assert, bizarrely, that any functionality not supported by the Bitcoin blockchain is not useful, and is therefore unnecessary.\n\nNever mind that Bitcoin is often slow, and somewhat expensive for everyday transactions.\n\nI\u2019m a pretty big fan of Bitcoin. It has many strengths, not least the fact that it\u2019s decentralized, secure, an excellent way to store value, and pretty much censorship-resistant. This makes it useful for all manner of things; some anticipated and desirable, some less so.\n\nI\u2019m also a major admirer of Ethereum. It is also highly decentralized, and it has a fantastic community of developers and builders who have created thousands of useful and utterly new applications on Ethereum.\n\nIt\u2019s also a little expensive, scaling it has involved a lot of compromises and a confusing array of solutions, its governance is tricky, and the manner of its launch made a few people who probably deserved it very rich (as well as a couple of folks who were just lucky enough to be in the room at the time).\n\nAnd I\u2019m excited about lots of other foundational blockchains, some of which have features they don\u2019t really share with Ethereum or Bitcoin, some of which are optimized for transaction cost, or volume, or some other metric.\n\nI try to imagine what it must be like to assert, contrary to logical analysis, that MY blockchain is the ONLY blockchain.\n\nAnd I guess it must be the equivalent of having just one tool in your garage, a drill, and wanting to use that drill for every home improvement project.\n\nHanging some drywall? Drill it! Repairing the stucco? Drill it! Fixing the plumbing? Drill it!\n\nOf course, we can\u2019t necessarily have exactly the right tool for every single situation. Your car, for example, may be a compromise car.\n\nMaybe you own a Toyota Camry. It\u2019s not designed to go extremely fast around corners. It wouldn\u2019t be much good off-road. It doesn\u2019t haul half a ton of lumber.\n\nEssentially the Camry is the Ethereum of cars. It does a bit of everything, which makes it a great solution for people who need their car to do a bit of everything.\n\nBut let\u2019s say you need your blockchain to be very, very good at one thing.\n\nFor instance, you are designing for the billion or so gamers out there.\n\nGamers don\u2019t want to pay little fees every time they mint an NFT achievement like clearing a level in record time, or collect an item they might use in a sequel.\n\nSo maybe you need a blockchain that has no fees.\n\nThat takes some pretty specialist design. Ethereum can\u2019t, by its very nature, support that precise need.\n\nMaybe you need your blockchain to be more private, or more secure, or much faster, or infinitely scalable, or to support some novel quantum-resistant cryptography. There are lots of reasons you might be prepared to trade all the usefulness of Ethereum for something very, very specific to your needs.\n\nIn which case, maximalism is exposed as a fraud.\n\nSure, clever folks have figured out lots of workarounds to make Ethereum more useful. In much the same way that Toyota figured out a nicer set of features to appeal to the customer who orders the loaded Camry \u2013 a better stereo, a more powerful engine, quad exhaust tips (don\u2019t get me started).\n\nBut a very nicely-equipped Camry is still not a Mercedes.\n\nNo matter how you slice it, Ethereum is a general use blockchain suitable for most general uses.\n\nIt is not the answer to every single real-life use case.\n\nWhich is why maximalism, in all its forms, no matter what blockchain the maximalist is maximizing, is an indication of a minimalist level of intellectual curiosity and honesty.\n\nNot to mention: We\u2019re ostensibly all in this together, right? We all want roughly the same thing: A better way of doing things, for the betterment of our experience on this planet?\n\nWe get there by collaborating, cooperating, working to find the right tool for the right job. Not by screaming at each other for daring to suggest that a general-purpose blockchain may not fit every use case.\n\nEthereum is a great innovation, it has a wonderful community and almost endless uses. Bitcoin is a remarkable and world-changing accomplishment, one that has opened countless minds to new possibilities.\n\nNeither of them is perfect. And that\u2019s okay.\n\nA version of this op-ed first appeared in Blockworks\u2019 newsletter.

Illustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nMost of the top thirty cryptocurrencies by market capitalization have appreciated in value over the last seven days, with Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and the Internet Computer Project (ICP) leading the rally.\n\nBitcoin is around 7.5% pricier than it was this time last weekend and trades for $29,295 as of this writing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Monday, the world\u2019s favorite cryptocurrency slipped down to $27,500, but on Wednesday, it reclaimed $29,000 after another potential insolvency rocked the traditional finance world; shares in First Republic Bank fell 50% on Tuesday, a day after its latest quarterly report revealed a marked decline in deposits.\n\nFrom Bitcoin\u2019s whitepaper onwards, crypto has been pitched to the world as an alternative to the banking system. So, when TradFi institutions are in trouble, investors often flock to crypto\u2014as happened last month when news of Credit Suisse\u2019s insolvency pumped Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nBitcoin\n\nThe market\u2019s second biggest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, only managed to add 2.7% to its value this week and currently trades for $1,906.\n\nThe biggest rallies among leading cryptocurrencies came from Solana, which grew 11% and is now worth $23.35, and ICP blew up 16.6% to change hands at $6.58.\n\nHolders of Cosmos Hub (ATOM) found their stashes increased this Saturday as the token rallied 8.5% over the week to trade at $11.68.\n\nRegulation\n\nThe glare from regulators\u2019 headlamps has been intensifying recently as U.S. agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) continue to bring enforcement actions against the industry instead of new guidelines.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Monday, Democrat and California lower house lawmaker Matt Haney introduced Assembly Bill 1229, a legal framework for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) that would change state legislation to enable DAOs to incorporate and pay taxes in California while providing better safeguards for Californians participating in the Web3 economy.\n\nThe bill already has support from crypto investment firm Andreessen Horowitz and the Crypto Council for Innovation.\n\nOn Tuesday, news broke on Twitter that Binance US had walked away from a deal to acquire the assets of crypto lender Voyager, one of the high-profile casualties stemming from Terra\u2019s collapse last May. In a statement to Decrypt, the exchange cited \u201cthe hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States\u201d as the main factor behind the decision to ax the deal.\n\nOn Wednesday, reports emerged that Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao had hired lawyers to defend himself against multiple legal threats filed against him and his exchange by the SEC, the CFTC, and the Department of Justice.\n\nThat day, crypto-friendly Texas Senator Ted Cruz launched a diatribe against the idea of an American central bank digital currency (CBDC) during the Bitcoin Policy Summit.\n\nCBDCs are currently being researched by governments worldwide, including those of the U.S. and the EU. A CBDC is a stablecoin pegged to the local currency, and advocates say they would facilitate online payments while taking advantage of blockchain features like instant settlement and smart contracts. However, critics fear the result would lead to an increase in centralized control over our money, which goes against crypto's very ethos.\n\nCruz argued that U.S. leaders would use a CBDC \u201cto destroy all value of Bitcoin, to destroy anonymity, to destroy decentralization.\u201d He added: \u201cThe same people that want to see a CBDC, they hate Bitcoin, and they hate cash. Let's be clear; they don't like cash for exactly the reason I like cash because it is not subjected to centralized control that is not subject to constant surveillance. And so I hope we see growing resistance to a CBDC.\u201d\n\nCBDC skepticism is prevalent in Republican circles. Last month Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Ohio Representative Warren Davidson echoed Cruz\u2019s sentiments.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFinally, at a Bloomberg event on Thursday, Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) CEO Julia Leung announced the special administrative region will launch its crypto licensing regime next month.\n\nThe new rules promise to let retail investors trade significant cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) with fewer restrictions from June 1."

        "content": "Gary James Harmon of Ohio was sentenced to four years and three months in prison for stealing 712 Bitcoin that belonged to his brother, the U.S. Department of Justice has announced.\n\nHarmon pleaded guilty to criminal charges in January, faced with one count each of wire fraud and obstruction of justice, carrying a maximum sentence of 40 years combined.\n\nThe 712 Bitcoin in question\u2014worth over $21 million at today\u2019s prices\u2014was taken by Harmon after the arrest of his brother in February 2020. According to the Justice Department, the funds were worth around $4.8 million at the time they were taken.\n\nHarmon\u2019s brother, Larry Dean Harmon, was arrested in February 2020 for operating a coin-mixing service called Helix, which processed over 350,000 Bitcoin between 2014 and 2017 and partnered with several darknet markets, the Justice Department said.\n\nFormer Coinbase Manager's Brother Gets 10-Month Sentence for Insider Trading\n\nLarry Dean Harmon later pleaded guilty to a money laundering conspiracy and charges associated with the improper transmission of money in 2021. In addition to criminal charges, Larry Dean Harmon was hit with a $60 million penalty by The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the first penalty levied again a Bitcoin mixer.\n\nAs part of that prosecution, law enforcement seized several assets, including a \u201ccryptocurrency storage device\u201d that couldn\u2019t be accessed initially due to certain security features, the Justice Department said.\n\nGary James Harmon was able to \u201ccovertly\u201d send himself 712 Bitcoins on the device by recreating Bitcoin wallets with his brother's credentials. Harmon then laundered the assets further, sending the freshly-taken bitcoin to two other online mixing services, authorities said.\n\nWhen he agreed to hand over assets that stemmed from the 712 Bitcoin he took illegally, he agreed to forfeit cryptocurrencies that included 17.4 million Dogecoin, around 647 Bitcoin, and just over 2 Ethereum\u2014altogether valued in excess of $20 million by the Justice Department.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom 'Bitcoin Billionaires' to SEC Charges: A Brief Crypto History of the Winklevoss Twins\n\nThough advocates of coin mixers have called them necessary tools for maintaining the privacy of crypto transactions, government officials have taken aim at the services, deriding them as crucial to hackers and other bad actors.\n\nCoin mixers obfuscate the source and destination of funds by grouping various transactions together. And last summer, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against the coin mixer Tornado Cash, essentially banning people in the U.S. from engaging with the application.\n\nThe Treasury Department said Tornado Cash was being used by the North Korean state-sponsored hacking organization, Lazarus Group. The move drew condemnation from politicians like Rep. Tom Emmer and the whistleblower Edward Snowden, who called it a \u201c\u200b\u200bdo or die\u201d moment for crypto.\n\nNew \u2018Sinbad\u2019 Bitcoin Mixer Unmasked As Formerly Sanctioned Blender\n\nThe crypto policy non-profit Coin Center is currently suing the Treasury Department, accusing it of government overreach in blacklisting the tool. And though his trial is pending, a Dutch court recently ruled that a Tornado Cash developer named Alexey Pertsev could be released on bail after spending nine months in detention.\n\nPertsev noted his freedom on Twitter on Friday, wondering what had gone on in the crypto space since he was arrested last August."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nOrdinals notched a new record on Saturday as the protocol used for inscribing digital assets on Bitcoin\u2014producing assets comparable to Ethereum-based NFTs\u2014had its busiest day yet.\n\nThe daily number of inscriptions made through Ordinals on Saturday totaled around 223,000, according to a widely-used Dune dashboard. It marked the first time over 200,000 inscriptions were made in a single day and suggests the protocol is as popular as ever as it enters its fifth month since launch.\n\nIn April alone, the daily record for inscriptions made was shattered four other times. That included roughly 72,000 inscriptions on April 2 and 193,000 inscriptions on April 23, according to the Dune dashboard.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the same time, the number of Bitcoin transactions neared levels not seen in several years, according to blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock. On Sunday, the firm said that the weekly average of daily Bitcoin transactions was around 396,000, its highest level since December 2017.\n\nThe 7-day average of daily Bitcoin transactions was at its highest this week since December 2017. The increasing number of daily transactions suggests growing active usage of the Bitcoin blockchain pic.twitter.com/zKWUM8Vw5P \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) April 30, 2023\n\nLooking at some of the latest inscriptions using ordinals.com, what once resembled a sea of images early on has morphed into a wall of text-based inscriptions. The tides began to shift last month as people discovered Ordinals could be used to create fungible tokens on Bitcoin, in a way that\u2019s analogous to what one can do on Ethereum.\n\nThe trend was kicked off by a pseudonymous on-chain data enthusiast named Domo, who created the \u201cBRC-20\u201d token standard as an experiment. And as of Sunday, close to 6,900 tokens using the new-developed standard have been launched, including several meme tokens with multi-million dollar market caps, according to data from brc-20.io.\n\nNorth of 99.8% of the total inscriptions made on Saturday was text-based compared to just 272 image-based inscriptions, which represented 0.1% of the daily total. While not every text-based inscription is tied to fungible tokens, the ratio on Saturday represents a shift in Ordinals\u2019 use compared to when the month began.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen the daily record for inscriptions made was broken on April 4, text-based subscriptions accounted for only 86% of the daily total, while image-based ones made up nearly 13% at 9,273.\n\nAside from the creation of fungible tokens under the so-called BRC-20 standard, Ordinals is opening the door to activity on Bitcoin in other ways, such as the Sats Name (.sats) standard that resembles name services built on Ethereum.\n\nOn Friday, the self-described NFT Historian @LeonidasNFT recognized recent developments in the Ordinals space, saying that \u201cordinals protocol innovation on Bitcoin has been increasing exponentially.\u201d\n\nOrdinals Inscriptions Rare Sats BRC-20 .sats None of these things existed 3 months ago. Ever since the release of the ordinals protocol innovation on Bitcoin has been increasing exponentially. 14 years in and we haven't even scratched the surface of what Bitcoin can do yet. \u2014 Leonidas.og (@LeonidasNFT) April 28, 2023\n\nThat same day, the account celebrated a separate milestone for Ordinals, as the total number of inscriptions crossed 2 million. Just a couple of days later, the total number of inscriptions is now over 2.5 million, according to the Dune dashboard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s thrilling to see inscriptions growing the way they are,\u201d Ordinals Project Communications Director Isabel Foxen Duke told Decrypt, \u201cI\u2019m concerned these numbers are inflated by a flood of inscription-generated BRC-20 tokens which are highly insecure and may pose a risk to retail investors.\u201d\n\nIndeed, some projects that have quickly embraced the experimental token standard have encountered headwinds, such as UniSat Wallet. Shortly after the digital wallet project\u2014which supports inscriptions and BRC-20 tokens\u2014launched its own marketplace, the service was compromised \u201cdue to a vulnerability in [its] codebase.\u201d\n\nA few hours ago, UniSat Marketplace, which just launched, experienced a large number of double-spend attacks due to a vulnerability in our codebase.\n\nDuring our testing last week, we simulated different approaches to double-spend attacks and made improvements and enhancements to\u2026 \u2014 UniSat Wallet - Store, Inscribe and Search. (@unisat_wallet) April 24, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUniSat Wallet indicated it will compensate users who were affected by the incident on Twitter, which it said had impacted 70 transactions. The project did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Decrypt.\n\nInscriptions are sometimes referred to colloquially as Bitcoin NFTs, but the process for creating inscriptions and how each one\u2019s corresponding data is stored is distinct compared to digital assets that are created on blockchains like Ethereum or Solana.\n\nNFTs are unique digital tokens minted using smart contracts, where people interact with code that operates on decentralized protocols. They represent the ownership of an item, often digital art, and though it\u2019s possible to store assets such as images on-chain using Ethereum or Solana, most NFTs point to an asset that is stored off-chain.\n\nlInstead of creating a token that\u2019s entirely new, using Ordinals, people inscribe content like images or text to individual Satoshi, the smallest denomination that a Bitcoin can be divided into (1/100,000,000 BTC). And that content is stored directly and permanently on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain."

The protocol works by burning the selected amount of native USDC on the source chain, and minting an equivalent amount of new USDC on the intended destination chain. The protocol essentially makes USDC transfers between the two networks faster and more user-friendly, as prior to its launch, people had to use third-party bridges or a Circle partner to facilitate transfers between the two networks. Additional support for Solana and other blockchains will be added later in 2023.\n\nStablecoin payments: Visa shares plans for \u2018ambitious\u2019 crypto product\n\nCuy Sheffield, the head of crypto at Visa, announced a new cryptocurrency-related project, on April 24, focused on stablecoin payments.

According to court documents, the firm requested a federal court in San Francisco to intervene and ask the IRS to back off. The IRS issued a summons in February demanding additional information on Kraken users who traded $20,000 or more in any single year from 2016 to 2020.\n\nMeta disclosed in its Q1 earnings report that its metaverse unit, Reality Labs, posted a loss of around $4 billion during the quarter. In what has been a costly venture for the firm, the $4 billion loss adds to the $14 billion Reality Labs loss over the entirety of 2022. Still, Meta posted a profit totalling roughly $5.7 billion in Q1 overall, with the firm\u2019s work on artificial intelligence somewhat curbing the losses. Mark Zuckerberg was also not phased by the loss from Reality Labs, as he reiterated that \u201cwe continue to expect Reality Labs operating losses to increase year-over-year in 2023\u201d as the firm eyes growth in the long term.\n\nViral clips of Securities and Exchange Commision chair Gary Gensler started circulating this week, showing him take a highly contradictory stance on crypto compared to what he holds now. As it stands, Gensler thinks almost every crypto asset apart from BTC is a security, and has pushed hard to regulate the crypto sector from that viewpoint. However, in a snippet from one of his \u201cBlockchain and Money\u201d lectures from 2018 \u2014 while he was working as a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology \u2014 Gensler said, \u201cThree quarters of the market is non-securities, it\u2019s just a commodity, cash, crypto.\u201d He even suggested Ether was not a security, despite repeatedly suggesting otherwise over the past couple years.\n\nWinners and Losers\n\nAt the end of the week, Bitcoin (BTC) is at $29,275, Ether (ETH) at $1,900 and XRP at $0.47.

ZachXBT tracked the 0x739c58807B99Cb274f6FD96B10194202b8EEfB47 address, and found that stolen funds from scams are continually sent to this address.

This resulted in a decrease in the selling pressure on ordinals.\n\nDue to these factors, Bitcoin miners started seeing growth in terms of revenue generated over the last few days, according to blockchain.com\n\nSpeculations start to rise\n\nHowever, the FUD around Bitcoin could soon stunt this growth. Recently, there was speculation going around that large transactions were being made by the BTC wallets of the U.S. government and Mt.Gox trustees.\n\nFor context, Mt. Gox was once the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world before it filed for bankruptcy in 2014. The exchange suffered a massive security breach resulting in the loss of 850,000 bitcoin, worth around $460 million at the time.\n\nThe court appointed Nobuaki Kobayashi as the trustee to oversee the fair and transparent distribution of the remaining assets and funds to the exchange\u2019s creditors.\n\nAdditionally, Kobayashi sold a significant amount of the remaining bitcoin over the years to pay back the creditors. He currently holds a substantial number of bitcoins which will be distributed to the claimants.\n\nMany stated that the FUD surrounding the government transactions has led to the recent decline in BTC prices.\n\nIt is to be noted that the U.S government was the largest holder of Bitcoin at press time. According to Glassnode\u2019s data, the U.S. government and the Mt.Gox trustee held 205,514 and 137,890 BTC, respectively.\n\nBased on our labels at @glassnode, neither the USG, nor Mt Gox are spending any coins from addresses we monitor. Stay safe out there folks. https://t.co/1B8gUVKjon pic.twitter.com/O5CZ0VtrYh \u2014 _Check\u0271ate ?\u26a1?\u2622\ufe0f?\ufe0f (@_Checkmatey_) April 26, 2023\n\nHow many are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today\n\nThis FUD also affected trader behavior as well. As the expiry date for 105,000 Bitcoin options draws near, GreeksLive\u2019s data showed that these options have a Put Call Ratio of 0.85.\n\nFurthermore, this ratio suggested that there are more investors betting on a dip in Bitcoin\u2019s price. The options also have a max pain point of $27,000, which is the price level where option holders would face the most significant financial loss. The estimated total value of these options was $3.1 billion."

        "content": "Bhutan\u2019s largest and only government-owned holding company Druk Holding and Investments (DHI), has confirmed that it has been mining Bitcoin (BTC) for several years as part of its diversified portfolio.\n\nAccording to the company, its interest in Bitcoin mining began when the maiden cryptocurrency was valued at around $5,000, but it also has a slight interest in Ethereum (ETH), the local media outlet The Bhutanese reported on April 28.\n\nDHI officials assured that the risks associated with cryptocurrencies are mitigated, considering that the company is not involved in direct selling and buying digital assets. At the same time, DHI noted that the investment pays for itself by selling Bitcoin to cater for the mining operational costs.\n\nThe company clarified that the investment in Bitcoin mining is a strategic move rather than driven by the fear of missing out (FOMO) on the technology. As part of this strategy, DHI is assembling a team of experts in cryptocurrencies and harnessing the benefits of regulated cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide.\n\nFinbold initially reported that it emerged that the landlocked Himalayan country was secretly investing millions in Bitcoin alongside other digital assets. The investment revelations came to light following the bankruptcies of crypto lenders BlockFi and Celsius.\n\nSurplus of electricity\n\nThe mining operation is powered by Bhutan\u2019s renewable energy source, which is generated through hydro projects. Notably, the country generates nearly 100% of its electricity from renewable sources, which produces a surplus of electricity, making it ideal for Bitcoin mining.\n\nThe venture into cryptocurrency mining is part of Bhutan\u2019s efforts to spur economic growth, where technology is viewed as a key element.\n\n\u201cOur portfolio contains investments across a range of asset classes that deliver exposure to traditional sectors and the industries driving the modern economy. This includes global equities, fixed income and venture capital investments in promising startups; domestic and international real estate; renewable energy including hydropower generation; healthtech, biotech, life sciences, and agritech; and digital asset mining and investment,\u201d said a statement from DHI.\n\nFurthermore, DHI CEO Ujjwal Deep Dahal explained that the company had managed to repay all the loans borrowed from bankrupted crypto firms BlockFi and Celsius. He clarified that DHI did not suffer any financial losses compared to the cost of mining digital assets in Bhutan."
