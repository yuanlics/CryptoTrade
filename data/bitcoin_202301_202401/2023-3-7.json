That's because the market has less leverage than it did last year. It's also because the market today is composed of more investors owning wallets holding more than $1,000 worth of tokens than it was last year, when the market was flooded with a large amount of crypto-curious investors who held much smaller amounts of bitcoin."

        "content": "The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is a pot that contains Bitcoins. Shares of the trust \u2014 each representing a share of ownership of the Bitcoins in the pot \u2014 trade publicly on OTC Markets like shares of stock. If you have some Bitcoins and want shares of the pot, you can go to Grayscale Investments LLC \u2014 which runs the trust \u2014 and give them your Bitcoins, and they will give you back shares in the pot. If you have shares of the pot and you want some Bitcoins, however, you can\u2019t go to Grayscale and ask for the Bitcoins back. The pot is one-way. Bitcoins can come in, but they cannot leave.\n\nThis is suboptimal product design for customers, but it is very very good product design for Grayscale. As an asset manager, it is just good business to run a pot of money that can increase (when people put in Bitcoins) but not decrease (they can\u2019t take them out). Grayscale has got all these Bitcoins in the pot \u2014 about $14 billion worth \u2014 and, as the manager of the pot, it gets to charge fees on the money in the pot. The fee is 2% per year, so Grayscale collects about $280 million a year for sitting on its giant pot of Bitcoin. Grayscale also has a Grayscale Ethereum Trust, the same idea but for Ether; that has $4.7 billion of Ether in the pot and a 2.5% annual fee."

        "title": "Did Bitcoin Bottom in November? These Metrics Suggest So. - Blockworks",
        "content": "Hopeful signs are emerging for the crypto industry mid-term as on-chain metrics for bitcoin suggest the world\u2019s largest digital asset by market value may have hit its bottom in late 2022.\n\nThose include the Market Value to Realized Value Ratio (MVRV) and the Net Unrealized Profit and Loss metric (NUPL), both of which flashed a trend reversal following FTX\u2019s collapse in November.\n\nThe rally in digital assets, represented by the price increase in bitcoin (BTC), as well as ether (ETH) this year, is reinforcing that play. Both assets are up 35% and 30% on a year-to-date basis trading at $22,450 and $1,550 respectively, Blockworks Research data shows.\n\nData provided by CryptoQuant shows MVRV hit its lowest point on Nov. 9, right around the time revelations came to light that FTX had allegedly misappropriated user funds, at a reading of 0.75.\n\nThe MVRV ratio is a metric used to determine whether an asset, in this case, bitcoin, is undervalued or overvalued.\n\nWhen the ratio is above 3.7, bitcoin is said to be overvalued and may be at a market top. Conversely, when the reading is below 1, the asset is considered undervalued and may be at a market bottom.\n\nThe last time the MVRV ratio was around as its November print was way back on Dec. 15, 2018, when the price of one bitcoin traded at $3,200. Despite a relatively uneventful year for price action in 2019, bitcoin never dipped below its 2018 lows.\n\nNUPL, a metric used to measure the average profit margin of all bitcoin holders, began to flash similar signs around the same time.\n\nLike the MVRV ratio, the NUPL can indicate whether bitcoin is undervalued or overvalued. Historically, NUPL levels above 0.7 (70% average profit margin) have signaled market tops, while levels below -0.4 (-40% profit margin) have signaled market bottoms.\n\nThe NUPL reading for bitcoin reached a low of -0.3 in November at a price of $15,800 and has held a positive reading since the middle of January. The NUPL is currently trending at 0.1 after crossing a 365-day moving average threshold, signaling bitcoin may have commenced a new upward cycle.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that although there are indications of a potential \u201ccrypto spring,\u201d analysts cautioned at the end of February that it is still premature to declare at this point.\n\nThey warned against the lingering presence of ongoing inflation, the possibility of future rate hikes and wider macroeconomic uncertainty which may cause further downward momentum.\n\nPrevious price history is also telling. While it\u2019s entirely plausible a mean reversion following the November drawdown is well underway, a daily close below about $21,400 \u2014 the most recent nadir on Feb. 13, could hint at further pain.\n\nCryptoassets can fall considerably further and still maintain the current uptrend on macro timeframes, even if the late November low holds. But the total drawdown in the bitcoin price from its November 2021 peak to November 2022 trough, of about 77% is broadly similar to prior cycles in Bitcoin\u2019s history.\n\nL2\u2019s a better indicator than the majors?\n\nSome like Rich Falk-Wallace, CEO of crypto data analytics platform Arcana suggest that on-chain activity is a better indicator of price for less utilized blockchains than for those fully utilized like bitcoin and ether.\n\n\u201cFor alternative coins and layer-2s, we\u2019ve seen 90%+ mid-term correlations between daily active users and prices,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for bitcoin and ether, both chains hit full capacity around 2018, which means user numbers have essentially been static since that time.\u201d\n\nHitting capacity for bitcoin and ether refers to the point where they reached their effective block capacity limits, beyond which the fees grow exponentially to restrict further demand for block space.\n\nThis results in a gradual increase in daily active addresses since there are restrictions on address growth. Falk-Wallace further explained that the incremental increase in value for these chains must come from a rise in value per active address instead of an increase in users.\n\nThat means there exists a \u201cstrong relationship\u201d between daily active users and prices for alternative coins and layer-2s, where an increase in daily active users on those chains is highly correlated with an increase in bitcoin\u2019s price, over a medium-term period.\n\n\u201cIf you look at dollar value transferred on-chain, the metric is well correlated to BTC\u2019s price historically. And that bottomed \u2014 and has languished \u2014 since November,\u201d Falk-Wallace said.\n\nThat means, even if the bottom is in, investors may be in for a period of relative boredom.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "FORT THOMAS, Ky. \u2014 The Fort Thomas Police Department is advising residents of a new scam it has been seeing over the last few weeks. The scam involves Bitcoin, which is a form of digital currency.\n\nWhat You Need To Know Police are seeing more Bitcoin scams\n\n\n\nThe latest has scam artists posing as law enforcement demanding money for dropped charges\n\n\n\nAttorneys say its hard to recover funds from crypto scams\n\n\u201cOnce the money is deposited inside a Bitcoin ATM, the money is gone, almost immediately. It is unlikely that the money will ever be located,\u201d the department said in a public notice. \u201cThe scammers usually stay on the phone with you through the entire process until the money is deposited.\u201d\n\nScammers have been telling people they are local police, U.S. Marshals, Border Patrol, and other law enforcement officers, according to the department. Scammers tell victims they need to pay a certain amount to get charges dropped.\n\nAttorney Brian Levin of Levin Law said his office receives hundreds of inquiries every month from people who\u2019ve been ripped off in cryptocurrency scams.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen people who have invested millions and millions of dollars on this representation. And then when the people go to take their money out, they are told, \u2018well, you have to pay a tax of 20%,\u2019\u201d Levin said.\n\nHowever, he said there is little recourse for the scams happening in Fort Thomas.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency transactions are not reversible, unlike certain cash transactions with banks, so once the money goes out, there\u2019s essentially no getting it back,\u201d Levin said. \u201cBecause even if you can identify where the cryptocurrency is on a blockchain, it\u2019s nearly impossible for them to obtain that cryptocurrency and get it back. And a lot of times it\u2019s in a private wallet, which makes it virtually impossible to get.\u201d\n\nLevin said a lot of his firm\u2019s current work focuses on suing large corporations for data privacy related issues, such as permitting unauthorized parties to get into people\u2019s accounts. A lot of that is in the cryptocurrency space, he said.\n\nFort Thomas police said other scammers have been changing email domain names.\n\n\u201cOnce clicking on those domain names, they are able to take over your computer and then begin their demands,\u201d the department said.\n\nAccording to the department, there are Bitcoin ATMs all over the northern Kentucky and Greater Cincinnati areas. They are typically in small gas stations, convenience stores, and liquor stores.\n\n\u201cIf you find yourself in a situation, in front of or inside one of these places while on the phone with these scammers, hang up the phone and contact your local police department immediately,\u201d the department said. \u201cPlease remember that police departments will not ask you to give money to get out of warrants or trouble over the phone. Do not give any personal identifying information over the phone. If they ask you to deposit money into a Bitcoin ATM, it is a scam!\u201d\n\nLevin said hacking scams happen all across the country, and anyone can be just a click away from falling victim.\n\n\u201cCriminals see that a lot of people are investing in cryptocurrency. And criminals see that people are used to these massive returns,\u201d Levin said. \u201cIt is far easier than people appreciate for criminals to install malware and spyware on your computer. So if you click on a link, you may instantly or almost instantly have malware or spyware installed on your computer. And that\u2019s also true on your phone.\u201d\n\nLevin said his firm has been successful in helping people retrieve their assets in these instances."

        "title": "Bitcoin Mining Has Surprising Environmental, Grid Benefits - ETF Trends",
        "content": "Aside from the obvious high correlations to bitcoin prices, one of the most frequent criticism lobbed at the bitcoin mining industry is that the group isn\u2019t environmentally astute and that its core activity is a drag on climate efforts.\n\nIn theory, that could be seen as a sign that exchange traded funds such as the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) aren\u2019t credible avenues for investors looking to tap into industries embracing clean tech and renewable energy. Interestingly, some experts argue that the opposite is true.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no denying that bitcoin mining is an energy-intensive endeavor, some market observers believe that related criticisms lack context and miss the mark when it comes to analyzing the industry\u2019s potential to drive increased adoption of renewable energy sources.\n\n\u201cHaving governments clamp down on Bitcoin\u2019s energy usage or attempting to switch how transactions are processed would not only undermine the Bitcoin network but also impede energy innovation, positive environmental outcomes and economic opportunity in America,\u201d wrote Dennis Porter for CoinDesk.\n\nAs Porter noted, bitcoin can serve as a catalyst for expanding renewable energy because it solves two of the biggest issues associated with traditional renewables, such as wind and solar: costs and reliability.\n\n\u201cBitcoin miners stand ready to purchase excess energy from wind and solar farms, improving the revenue for renewable generation and preventing taxpayers from subsidizing the generation of energy. A win-win,\u201d he noted.\n\nThat\u2019s pertinent to the SATO investment thesis because the ETF, which follows the Alerian Galaxy Global Cryptocurrency-Focused Blockchain Equity, Trusts and ETPs Index, features a slew of bitcoin miners among its 37 holdings.\n\nDue to the drubbings incurred by many of those firms during the 2022 crypto winter, market values across the industry are well off prior highs. As a result, more than 63% of SATO members are classified as small-cap fare.\n\nBitcoin miners serve other objectives, including the potential for sending excess power back to energy grids, allowing grid operators to improve reliability while reducing customer costs.\n\n\u201cMiners aren\u2019t just good for renewables. They can also make use of stranded methane, a potent greenhouse gas, that is often uneconomical to bring to market. Methane is frequently vented or flared from landfills, abandoned wells, and oil and gas operations,\u201d concluded Porter.\n\nAdd it all up, and SATO could be more of a renewable energy play than meets the eye.\n\nVettaFi LLC (\u201cVettaFi\u201d) is the index provider for SATO, for which it receives an index licensing fee. However, SATO is not issued, sponsored, endorsed or sold by VettaFi, and VettaFi has no obligation or liability in connection with the issuance, administration, marketing or trading of SATO.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel .\n\nThe opinions and forecasts expressed herein are solely those of Tom Lydon, and may not actually come to pass.

        "title": "Grayscale\u2019s GBTC shares soar more than 10% after judges show skepticism of SEC\u2019s denial of Bitcoin ETF - Fortune",
        "content": "On Tuesday, a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit raised doubts over a decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission to deny a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund, or ETF.\n\nShortly after the hearing, which turned on a complaint by the crypto company Grayscale, shares of the company\u2019s GBTC shares\u2014which are backed by Bitcoin\u2014surged more than 10% on a day when the broader market is down. By midday ET, GBTC shares fell slightly from their earlier high, trading around $12.50.\n\nGrayscale, represented by former solicitor general Donald Verrilli Jr., argued that the SEC had been \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d in approving an ETF based on the futures market for Bitcoin, but then denying Grayscale\u2019s ETF based on the spot market.\n\nThe SEC, represented by senior counsel Emily Parise, countered that the futures market was regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission through a surveillance agreement with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while spot markets remain unregulated and are subject to fraud and manipulation.\n\nThe three judges for the court\u2014Sri Srinivasan, Harry T. Edwards, and Neomi Rao\u2014expressed skepticism toward the SEC position, seeming to side with Grayscale\u2019s argument that the futures market relied on the spot market for its underlying pricing, and therefore fraud and manipulation would affect both. Even as Grayscale provided data that showed the two markets were 99.9% correlated, Parise said that it was not empirically sufficient.\n\n\u201cIt seems there\u2019s quite a bit of information on how these markets work together,\u201d Rao noted to Parise. \u201cThe SEC has not offered any explanation that the petitioners are wrong.\u201d\n\nJames Angel, a faculty member at Georgetown\u2019s Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy specializing in market structure and financial regulation, told Fortune the judges seemed to understand Grayscale\u2019s economic argument that the SEC accepted one product and arbitrarily rejected another.\n\nEven so, the case will likely come down to the doctrine of Chevron deference, which entails courts giving agencies like the SEC latitude to interpret statutes related to their expertise. Even though the Supreme Court has recently reduced the amount of administrative deference, agencies such as the SEC generally have a wide remit to interpret statute\u2014in this case, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nEven as the judges appeared unconvinced of the SEC\u2019s arguments, Angel said that the outcome is still uncertain. \u201cMy crystal ball is cloudy,\u201d he told Fortune.\n\nThere is also the question of what would happen if the judges side with Grayscale. Rao asked Parise if the SEC would go back on its approval of the Bitcoin futures ETF. Parise said she could not speak for the commission, but that it would have to \u201cthink about the issue anew.\u201d\n\nGrayscale, a subsidiary of crypto empire Digital Currency Group, currently operates the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, a fund holding nearly $15 billion in assets. When it launched in 2013, it represented one of the first financial instruments for investors to get access to Bitcoin without buying it directly.\n\nAlthough investors can buy shares of the trust, they cannot redeem them back into Bitcoin\u2014a limitation that has caused the fund to trade at a significant discount to the price of its underlying Bitcoin. Verrilli argued that converting the trust to a spot-based ETF would unlock $4 billion in value.\n\n\u201cThe court asked thoughtful, pointed questions about the inextricable link between Bitcoin spot markets and Bitcoin futures markets\u2014the exact points that are the bedrock of the case to convert GBTC to an ETF,\u201d a Grayscale spokesperson told Fortune. \u201cWe look forward to the court\u2019s final decision, and strongly believe that American investors deserve to have equal access to the Bitcoin ETF product that best suits their needs.\u201d\n\nGiven the recent torrent of enforcement actions by the SEC, a Grayscale win would set back Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s crackdown against the crypto industry, although, as Parise alluded, it could also cause the agency to revisit its approval of a Bitcoin futures ETF. The approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF would open the market to new investors, likely causing the price of Bitcoin to rise.\n\nEven with an uncertain outcome, the surge in GBTC\u2019s share price indicated investors are optimistic that judges would side with Grayscale. A decision is expected by the end of the summer."

The proceeding came after Grayscale and the SEC exchanged written briefs in recent months.\n\nGrayscale sued the SEC last June after the agency did not allow the firm to convert its flagship Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF.\n\nGBTC launched in 2013 and holds $14 billion in assets. The trust has traded at a discount of more than 40% in recent weeks. Grayscale has said its preferred solution is converting the trust to an ETF.\n\nDonald Verrilli Jr., a former US solicitor general who Grayscale hired last year as a legal strategist, kicked off the hearing. Verrilli reiterated that the SEC\u2019s approval of ETFs investing in CME-traded bitcoin futures, but not for proposed ETPs that invest in bitcoin directly \u2014 such as what GBTC would convert to \u2014 is discriminatory.\n\nEmily Parise, an attorney representing the SEC, contended that bitcoin futures ETPs are different from the proposed spot bitcoin products the agency has denied. Bitcoin spot markets are \u201cfragmented and unregulated,\u201d Parise said.\n\nUnderlying products for the approved bitcoin futures ETFs instead trade only on CME, which is CFTC-regulated, she added, where the \u201cexchange has a surveillance sharing agreement that gives it access to information like market trading activity, customer identification \u2014 the tools to investigate fraud and manipulation if it were to occur.\u201d\n\nJudges grill the SEC\n\nRao, during the hearing Tuesday, interrupted Parise on that point, saying the SEC needs to explain how it views the relationship between bitcoin futures and the spot price of bitcoin.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me\u2026one is essentially a derivative of the other,\u201d the judge said. \u201cThey move together 99.9% of the time, so where\u2019s the gap in the commission\u2019s view?\u201d\n\nParise said the correlation between once-a-day futures prices and spot prices doesn\u2019t signal the \u201ccausal relationship\u201d between the two.\n\nBut Rao added the SEC has not offered an explanation why Grayscale is wrong as it relates to the relationship between the bitcoin spot and futures markets. The judge said the SEC\u2019s ruling on a bitcoin futures ETF by fund group Teucrium recognizes the futures prices are influenced by the spot prices.\n\n\u201cIn approving the futures ETPs, it seems to be that the commission has to have necessarily drawn the conclusion that this arrangement would prevent fraud and manipulation on the underlying spot market,\u201d Rao said.\n\nAn SEC spokesperson declined to comment about the oral arguments.\n\n\u201cThe court asked thoughtful, pointed questions about the inextricable link between bitcoin spot markets and bitcoin futures markets \u2014 the exact points that are the bedrock of the case to convert GBTC to an ETF,\u201d a Grayscale spokesperson told Blockworks in an email.\n\nQuestions signal a potential ruling?\n\nBloomberg Intelligence ETF Analyst James Seyffart told Blockworks Monday he expected the judges\u2019 questions Tuesday could signal how they might rule on the case.\n\n\u201cRao is definitely team Grayscale,\u201d he tweeted during the hearing. \u201cGrayscale needs to get Judge Srinivasan or Judge Edwards on their side as well and they can win.\u201d\n\n\u201cSrinivasan seems to be leaning Grayscale as well based on this line of questioning,\u201d Seyffart added. \u201cWOW. The SEC lawyer seems to keep saying the futures aren\u2019t and I quote \u201cmanipulated in the *same way*\u201d and I don\u2019t even understand what she\u2019s trying to say.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nSeyffart told Blockworks that he believes it\u2019s possible for all three judges to side with Grayscale \u2014 a \u201csharp reversal\u201d of what he thought before the oral arguments began. He quantified Grayscale\u2019s chance to win as 70% likely, noting that a decision could come as early as the second quarter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible the ruling tells the SEC to go back to the drawing board, where the SEC can put us back on the spot Bitcoin ETF denial merry-go-round by issuing another denial with different language and/or reasoning,\u201d Seyffart said in an email. \u201cSo this could still be far from over.\u201d\n\nGBTC was up about 8% on the day, as of about 1:00 pm ET.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The core argument in favor of approving a spot bitcoin ETF, at least at this time, is that the SEC\u2019s concerns about manipulation are literally inconsistent \u2013 and possibly in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, as Ribbit Capital\u2019s Sigal Mandelker and Jessi Brooks wrote. The agency has already approved exchange-traded products that use bitcoin futures contracts, particularly NYSE Arca\u2019s proposal to list and trade shares of the Teucrium Bitcoin Futures Fund and Nasdaq\u2019s proposal to list and trade shares of the Valkyrie XBTO Bitcoin Futures Fund. Both of the funds provide \u201csurveillance-sharing agreements\u201d designed to prevent manipulation, which the SEC says every spot BTC application has lacked."

        "content": "Over 50,000 Bitcoin (BTC), worth $1 billion, were moved from multiple wallets connected to United States Government law enforcement seizures and transferred to new addresses, with some moved to Coinbase on March 8.\n\nAccording to data shared by on-chain analytics firm PeckShield, three transfers were made from U.S. law enforcement agency\u2019s wallets. These wallets held nearly 51,000 BTC seized by U.S. agencies from the Silk Road marketplace in November 2021. The confiscated BTC was consolidated into two wallet addresses.\n\nSilk Road Bitcoin moved to three different addresses. Source: Twitter\n\nOut of these three transfers, the majority appear to be internal transfers. However, approximately 9,861 BTC was sent to Coinbase. The other two include a 30,000 BTC transfer and a 9,000 BTC transfer.\n\nSilk Road BTC sent to Coinbase. Source: Glassnode\n\nThe Silk Road was an online black market and the first modern darknet market. It was launched in 2011 by its American founder Ross Ulbricht under the pseudonym \u201cDread Pirate Roberts.\u201c The marketplace was one of the first to accept Bitcoin payments, helping to popularize crypto use. U.S. law enforcement agencies confiscated multiple items from its founder, including hoards of BTC, which have been auctioned from time to time.\n\nRelated: Key Bitcoin price metrics point to BTC downside below $22.5K\n\nPopular Bitcoin proponent Tim Draper bought nearly 30,000 BTC in 2014 in one of these auctions. Another auction for 50,000 BTC was held in October 2015, where the U.S. Marshals Service auctioned 21 blocks of 2,000 BTC and one block of 2,341 in an online auction.\n\nWhile only a small portion of the 50,000 BTC was sent to Coinbase, the movement of billions worth of BTC from U.S enforcement agency-linked wallets evoked wild reactions and even wilder theories from Twitter users. One pointed out that if U.S. agencies decided to sell their Silk Road Bitcoin, it would put significant selling pressure on the market. At the same time, a few others questioned the timing of the sale."

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The so-called mining for digital assets, or cryptocurrency, consumes as much electricity as some entire nations, and U.S. senators explored the issue Tuesday in what they said was their first-ever hearing focused on the energy implications of digital currency.\n\nCrypto mining in both Nebraska and Pennsylvania was discussed in particular by the members of the panel of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\nTouting his legislative proposal to improve transparency of crypto mining, Democratic Sen. Ed Markey, of Massachusetts, likened it to being \u201cmore like digital coal than digital gold\u201d and implored the industry \u2014 Bitcoin being the most popular currency \u2014 to \u201cwork smarter, not harder\u201d by improving energy efficiency as the world faces the effects of climate change.\n\n\u201cBitcoin mining in the United States uses as much power as we need to light every single home in our country, and that demand on our grid is only going to grow,\u201d Markey said in opening remarks.\n\nMarkey\u2019s bill, introduced Monday, would require cryptocurrency asset operators to report emissions to the Environmental Protection Agency, and would mandate the agency to conduct a study of energy usage required by thousands of robust, special-use computers to add new transactions to the decentralized digital accounting ledger, he said. The text of the bill was not yet published.\n\nThe hearing before the Senate Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate and Nuclear Safety featured testimony from Rob Altenburg, of PennFuture, a Pennsylvania-based clean energy advocacy organization; Courtney Dentlinger, an executive with the Nebraska Public Power District, a publicly owned utility; and Anna R. Kelles, a member of the New York State Assembly.\n\nThe subcommittee\u2019s top Republican, Sen. Pete Ricketts, of Nebraska, pushed back on environmental concerns.\n\nReminding fellow members that CNBC ranked his state No. 1 last year for cultivating a crypto economy, Ricketts said he\u2019s \u201cparticularly interested in this topic as to whether this industry could result in more economic development.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrypto asset mining is hardly alone in being an industry reliant on large data server banks,\u201d Ricketts later continued. \u201cFinance, technology, government, academia and many others use significant amounts of electricity to power their computing needs. We should be providing the tools for open competition in a free market and not allowing politicians or bureaucrats in Washington D.C. to pick winners and losers.\u201d\n\nCheap electricity in Nebraska\n\nBoth Nebraska and Pennsylvania are home to crypto mining operations.\n\nCheap electricity in Nebraska \u2014 100% powered by publicly owned utilities \u2014 makes the state an attractive option for the crypto data centers, where acres of extremely fast computers encased in what look like metal shipping containers attempt to guess long combinations of numbers to verify a new transaction, some at speeds of up to trillions of guesses per second.\n\nOne 11-acre crypto mining site in Kearney, Nebraska, consumes as much electricity as the city itself, which has a population of 33,790, according to a local news analysis published in January.\n\nHowever, the industry has had \u201csignificant benefits\u201d for the state, Nebraska Public Power District\u2019s Dentlinger told lawmakers, giving the example that just one of Nebraska\u2019s crypto mining facilities generated $1.8 million in state sales taxes and $3.8 million in local taxes over a 12-month period.\n\nDentlinger also argued that consistent electricity demand from a customer benefits the wider customer base.\n\n\u201cIn our predominantly non-metro and rural service area, diversification of businesses and economic growth is critical as these areas continue to see population declines,\u201d she told lawmakers. \u201cIn fact, local leaders have been very receptive to crypto mining facilities as they\u2019ve seen the potential for significant economic development benefits for their communities.\u201d\n\nCrypto operations pop up in Pennsylvania\n\nPennFuture\u2019s Altenburg argued there\u2019s a different story in Pennsylvania, one where regulators can\u2019t keep tabs on crypto operations popping up across the state.\n\nLast year, a site inspection by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection found that a company in Clearfield County had plugged into a natural gas well site without seeking a permit. The company, Big Dog Energy, was running 30 natural gas generators to power its crypto operation. The EPA took the lead on investigating.\n\nAltenburg told lawmakers it\u2019s \u201cimpossible to know which or how many of Pennsylvania\u2019s thousands of fracked gas wells are being used in this way.\u201d\n\nAnother company, Stronghold Digital Mining, burns waste coal to power crypto operations. The company \u2014 which argues it is an \u201cenvironmentally beneficial\u201d Bitcoin miner for finding a use for an environmental hazard \u2014 sources from the ubiquitous piles of waste coal around the state and converts it into for electricity at two sites, one in Venango County between Pittsburgh and Erie, and the other in Carbon County northwest of Allentown, according to the company\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cWaste coal is a problematic fuel to say the least. As the name implies, it has low energy value compared to ordinary coal, so plants need to burn even more to generate the same amount of electricity. In the process, they emit more ozone precursors, fine particulates, acid gases, heavy metals, and it\u2019s the second-most carbon intensive generation, next to residual fuel oil,\u201d Altenburg said.\n\nWhy crypto mining requires energy\n\nCryptocurrency mining involves the use of robust computing power to add to digital ledger technology, such as \u201cblockchain.\u201d\n\nThe decentralized digital financial record of transactions is a ledger or database where users, or \u201cminers,\u201d on a common network can agree on entries, sometimes called \u201cblocks,\u201d through a \u201cconsent mechanism.\u201d\n\nEnergy usage varies depending on which consent mechanism is used. For example, Bitcoin is based on a \u201cproof of work\u201d mechanism, which in part ensures security of the ledger by requiring miners to have access to special computers and considerable amounts of energy.\n\nAnother popular cryptocurrency, Ethereum, recently switched to a \u201cproof of stake\u201d mechanism, which consumes a fraction of the energy \u2014 as of 2021 it accounted for 0.001% of global energy usage \u2014 because it relies on miners to risk a stake of their crypto assets as a way to enforce the integrity of the accounting ledger.\n\nU.S. power usage for crypto\n\nA September 2022 report from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy warned that cryptocurrency mining uses a significant amount of energy that has only increased over the past five years.\n\nCrypto assets worldwide use 120 to 140 billion kilowatt-hours per year \u2014 or roughly exceeding the total energy usage of countries like Argentina or Australia, the report found.\n\nThe U.S. accounts for one-third of the world\u2019s crypto asset operations, consuming about 0.9% to 1.7% of the nation\u2019s electricity usage, which is about equal to the energy used to power all home computers or all residential lighting in the U.S., according to the OSTP.\n\nPresident Joe Biden ordered the interagency report in a March 2022 wide-ranging executive order on \u201cEnsuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets,\u201d which included exploring energy implications and possible impediments to reaching the administration\u2019s climate goals.\n\nThose goals include reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030, achieving a carbon-free electricity grid by 2035 and reaching net-zero emissions by mid-century.\n\nMarkey\u2019s bill has been referred to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\nSens. Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, and Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, have signed on as co-sponsors.\n\nMarkey compared reducing the energy usage of cryptocurrency mining to updating energy standards for appliances or fuel economy for vehicles.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not looking to end refrigeration or automotive technology. What we\u2019re saying is that we should be more efficient, we should be more aware of the emissions into our atmosphere that are avoidable,\u201d Markey said. \u201cSo on the one hand, this (cryptocurrency) is a very innovative sector, economically, and they count themselves as innovators. But all we\u2019re asking for them to do is look across the board at innovation.\u201d"

        "content": "The U.S. government moved a good chunk of its seized BTC to Coinbase.\n\nMarket participants think a BTC dump is incoming.\n\nBTC is currently trading down 1.4% on the day.\n\nThe crypto markets have enjoyed a great start to the year, with most coins and tokens going up significantly since January.\n\nHowever, the past few weeks have been increasingly challenging for digital assets. Cryptobank Silvergate is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, and the U.S. Federal Reserve has again turned hawkish and anticipates larger rate increases.\n\nFor Bitcoin (BTC), there\u2019s another threat in the short term. That threat is the U.S. government.\n\nThe Bitcoin community has been anxiously looking at the BTC chart since early Wednesday morning after reports indicated that the U.S. government has started moving their BTC holdings.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, a blockchain intelligence and data platform, U.S. government-related wallets moved around 40,000 seized BTC, or about $1 billion, in the early morning of Wednesday.\n\nMore importantly, 9,861 of the total BTC seized from the Silk Road hacker have been sent to Coinbase, fueling speculation that BTC will soon experience a surprise dump.\n\nApproximately 40k $BTC from wallets associated with US Government law enforcement seizures are on the move.\n\n\n\nOf these, the majority appear to be internal transfers (so far), however approximately 9,861 $BTC seized from the Silk Road hacker have been sent to our Coinbase cluster. pic.twitter.com/afuEYcV18L \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) March 7, 2023\n\nIf that were to happen, industry observers believe BTC could retest the $20,000 resistance zone, especially with the U.S. Federal Reserve turning hawkish on Tuesday and indicating further rate increases.\n\nU.S. Fed Indicates Rate Increases\n\nLast week, the news of Silvergate being on the brink of bankruptcy shocked the crypto markets, which saw billions of dollars vanish in 30 minutes. Bitcoin dropped around 5%, with ETH and other altcoins also dumping.\n\nOn top of that, the U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell indicated in his testimony on Tuesday that the Fed might need to introduce further rate increases to curb inflation. The current Federal Funds Rate is 4.57%, but market participants predict it will reach around 6% by the end of the year.\n\nBREAKING: Futures now see a 53% chance of a 50 bps rate hike in March.\n\n\n\nWe now have a near 35% chance that rates go to 6.00%+ this summer!\n\n\n\nJust a month ago, odds of a 50 bps rate hike were 1% and peak rates were expected at 5.25%.\n\n\n\nThe Fed pivoted, from hawkish to more hawkish. pic.twitter.com/ah4HRPVLpi \u2014 The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) March 7, 2023\n\nFor risk assets like BTC, higher-than-expected rates in the U.S. and worldwide would mean significant sell pressure in the coming months.\n\nBTC currently trades at around $22,000, down 1.4% on the day, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nThe U.S. government could have other plans related to their seized BTC.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nInvestors will potentially suffer short-term losses if the U.S. government sells its BTC.

        "title": "Bitcoin bulls' desire for a trend reversal could be obliterated by this week's $565M options expiry - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) fell below a four-day narrow trading range near $22,400 on March 7 following comments by United States Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before the Senate Banking Committee. During the congressional appearance, the Fed chairman warned that he bank is prepared to tame inflation by pushing for more significant interest rate increases.\n\nPowell added that \u201cthe ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated\u201d and that recent economic data was \u201cstronger than expected.\u201d These remarks significantly increased investors\u2019 expectations of a 50 basis point interest rate hike on March 22, putting pressure on risk assets such as stocks, commodities and Bitcoin.\n\nThat movement could explain why the $565 million Bitcoin weekly options expiry on March 10 will almost certainly favor bears. Nonetheless, additional negative crypto market events might have also played a significant role.\n\nBitcoin from the Silk Road and Mt. Gox are on the move\n\nThe movement of multiple wallets linked to U.S. law enforcement seizures on March 8 added to the price pressure on Bitcoin investors. Over 50,000 Bitcoin worth $1.1 billion were transferred, according to data shared by on-chain analytics firm PeckShield.\n\nFurthermore, 9,860 BTC were sent to Coinbase, raising concerns about the coins being sold on the open market. These wallets are directly linked to the former Silk Road darknet marketplace and were seized by law enforcement in November 2021.\n\nMt. Gox creditors have until March 10 to register and choose a method of compensation repayment. The movement is part of the 2018 rehabilitation plan, and creditors must choose between \u201cearly lump sum payment\u201d and \u201cfinal payment.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear when creditors can expect to be paid in cryptocurrency or fiat currency, but estimates indicate that the final settlement could take several years.\n\nAs a result, Bitcoin\u2019s price drop to $22,000 on March 8 effectively confirmed bears\u2019 advantage on the March 10 options expiry.\n\nBulls placed far more bets, but most will be worthless\n\nThe March 10 options expiry has $565 million in open interest, but the actual figure will be lower because bulls have concentrated their bets on Bitcoin trading above $23,000.\n\nBitcoin options aggregate open interest for March 10. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe 1.63 call-to-put ratio reflects the disparity in open interest between the $350 million call (buy) options and the $215 million put (sell) options. However, the expected outcome is likely to be much lower, as bulls were caught off guard when Bitcoin fell below $23,000 on March 3.\n\nFor example, if the price of Bitcoin remains near $22,100 at 8:00 am UTC on March 10, only $6 million in call (buy) options will be available. This difference occurs because the right to purchase Bitcoin at $22,500 or $24,000 is rendered null if BTC trades below that level on expiry.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin clings to $22K as US dollar strength rises to December levels \u2014 What's next?\n\nThe most likely outcomes favor bears by a wide margin\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on March 10 for call (bull) and put (bear) instruments varies depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $20,000 and $21,000: 0 calls vs. 7,200 puts. The net result favors the put (bear) instruments by $150 million.\n\n0 calls vs. 7,200 puts. The net result favors the put (bear) instruments by $150 million. Between $21,000 and $22,000: 100 calls vs. 5,000 puts. The net result favors the put (bear) instruments by $105 million.\n\n100 calls vs. 5,000 puts. The net result favors the put (bear) instruments by $105 million. Between $22,000 and $23,000: 1,400 calls vs. 1,900 puts. Bears have a modest advantage, profiting some $55 million.\n\n1,400 calls vs. 1,900 puts. Bears have a modest advantage, profiting some $55 million. Between $23,000 and $24,000: 4,600 calls vs. 600 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $95 million.\n\nThis rough estimate takes into account only call options in bullish bets and put options in neutral-to-bearish trades. Nonetheless, this oversimplification excludes more complex investment strategies.\n\nA trader, for example, could have sold a call option, effectively gaining negative exposure to Bitcoin above a certain price, but there is no easy way to estimate this effect.\n\nTo turn the tables and secure a potential $95 million profit, Bitcoin bulls must push the price above $23,000 on March 10. However, given the negative macroeconomic pressure and the FUD emanating from Mt. Gox and Silk Road, the odds favor bears in this week\u2019s options expiry.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

This BTC was seized by the regulator in November 2021 and March 2022.\n\nPeckShield, a blockchain security firm, tracked the move on-chain and identified it as proceeds from the Silk Road crimes.\n\nUS Government law enforcement seizes BTC from the Silk Road crimes\n\nThe two wallet addresses, bc1qf2\u2026fsv moved 30,000 BTC and bc1qe7\u2026rdg moved 9,000 BTC seized from Silk Road crimes to Coinbase.\n\nMovement of seized BTC to Coinbase\n\nA total of 51,351 BTC was seized from crime proceeds by the US Government.\n\nWhat were the Silk Road crimes?\n\nSilk Road was a digital black market platform popular for hosting money laundering activities and illegal drug transactions using Bitcoin.

Typically, a rise in BTC inflow to exchange\u2019s wallet addresses increases the selling pressure on the asset and triggers a decline in the asset\u2019s price.\n\nBitcoin exchange inflow (total)\n\nAs seen in the above chart from CryptoQuant, a spike in BTC exchange inflow is followed by a decline in Bitcoin price, historically. As of now, the data for March 8 is incomplete, it cannot be said with certainty that the spike in inflow is driving a sell-off in Bitcoin.\n\nThe largest asset by market capitalization declined from $22,469 to the $22,000 level within the past 24 hours. It remains to be seen whether the rising selling pressure drives the asset lower, or Bitcoin sustains above $22,000."

        "content": "Print this page\n\n\u201cConfidence must be earned\u201d is the current ad slogan of Amundi, Europe\u2019s biggest asset manager. Keep it in mind while reading its latest thematic paper on what might follow crypto winter.\n\nParis-based Amundi can appear a bit bipolar about crypto. Last February it was reportedly investigating how to sell NFTs to clients while warning them about the \u201cpotentially destabilising systemic risk\u201d of stablecoins. Former chief investment officer Pascal Blanqu\u00e9 called bitcoin a \u201cfarce\u201d; his successor Vincent Mortier is more amenable:\n\n\u201cIf inflation remains above central banks\u2019 targets, bitcoin\u2019s limited supply may start to attract more attention,\u201d write Mortier and strategist Tristan Perrier:\n\nWhile bitcoin spectacularly failed to protect investors against galloping inflation in 2021-22, this was a period of dramatic rises in policy and market interest rates that pressured all asset classes. If inflation is high, but not rising, nominal interest rates will also likely stop climbing and may even fall a little. This is a much more favourable environment for an asset whose supply is finite and that has a long duration in essence, as its main attraction is its future potential rather than its current status.\n\nAnd sure, maybe? The evidence we have suggests that as an inflation hedge bitcoin is useless (Smales, 2021), mostly useless (Conlon et al, 2021), randomly worse than useless (Matkovskyy and Jalan, 2020), or consistently worse than useless (Pinchuk, 2021). The inflation discussion also invites broader questions around whether finite supply is a precondition of all forms of existence (Aristotle, 350BC), and whether \u201cfuture potential\u201d can matter when applied to something that has unquantifiable exogenous risks but no intrinsic value (Amundi, 2021). But then, a firm doesn\u2019t collect more than almost \u20ac2tn in assets by seeding FUD.\n\nAmundi\u2019s \u201cfive reasons why recent setbacks may not mean the end of cryptocurrencies\u201d will be familiar to anyone who\u2019s been to Davos or Reddit. There\u2019s the shakeout, where a dotcom-style crash leaves behind a leaner group of eventual winners. There\u2019s proof-of-stake mining as a route out of the energy boondoggle. There\u2019s regulation, which \u201cis more likely than not to be a positive in the end\u201d. And there are signs that the financial mainstream hasn\u2019t abandoned all hope in crypto, Amundi says, somewhat self-referentially.\n\nWhat\u2019s important, Mortier and Perrier suggest, is to separate practice from theory. The experienced reality of crypto (fraud, hubris, incompetence, or some yet-to-be-determined combination of all three) might look unappealing but it\u2019s mostly just TradFi doing TradFi things, so the theory (code-is-law decentralisation) has emerged \u201cmostly unscathed\u201d.\n\nAnd sure? Mayyyyy-be?\n\nA person might argue that the dotcom bust wasn\u2019t defined primarily by bankruptcies and fraud \u2014 or had more promoter fraud and less alleged theft \u2014 which allowed for a period of industry consolidation and retrenchment. That\u2019s unlikely to happen to crypto. They might argue that in its current form, proof-of-stake mining invites concentration of control so is in direct opposition to Amundi\u2019s core argument. They might see recent crypto press releases from mainstream companies less as a sign of a healthy ecosystem than as the light only just reaching us from a long-dead star.\n\nAs for the positive tailwind of legitimacy through regulation, programmer Stephen Diehl posed the key question on these pixels earlier this month: without a point, what\u2019s the point?\n\nAmundi says that for investors to remain interested in crypto, someone\u2019s going to have to find something productive to do with a blockchain. Financial asset tokenisation is interesting in theory, but applying the concept comes with big hurdles around legality, delivery and adoption.\n\nThese are fair points but again are perhaps not up with recent developments, such as China\u2019s use of blockchain for some ABS contracts. While the experiment might be lowering costs by a few basis points, research so far hasn\u2019t been entirely convincing.\n\nMortier and Perrier conclude:\n\nBlockchains, cryptocurrencies and tokenisation do have a lot of potential, be it in powering new types of decentralised organisations that can offer serious economic and social advantages, or in enabling new ways of trading and managing assets. The most likely outcome is that they will simply need more time to mature before becoming mainstream, as was the case for other technologies in the past. However, they could still turn out to be a dead-end (which could allow time for another cryptocurrencies bull market to last a few years but not much more). At this stage, nothing is proven either way and the jury is still very much out.\n\nIsn\u2019t it normal to give evidence to a jury before expecting its verdict?"

        "content": "On March 8, addresses linked to the United States government moved 49,000 Bitcoin seized from the Silk Road, worth $1 billion. The transfer was accompanied by Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price slipping below $22,000 and a noticeable spike in a key holder metric.\n\nBut does this mean that traders should brace for potential BTC price volatility ahead?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s CDD metric suddenly spikes\n\nThe BTC transfer likely caused a significant spike in Glassnode\u2019s coin days destroyed (CDD) metric. It measures the weighted movement of Bitcoin based on the time it was last moved from an address.\n\nThe CDD is calculated by multiplying the amount of Bitcoin transferred by the number of days since BTC was last added to an address.\n\nA spike in the CDD indicator usually precedes price volatility, with the bears typically having a slight advantage. Some long-term investors, however, may also move Bitcoin to leverage it for more upside gains on the futures market.\n\nBitcoin coin days destroyed.

        "title": "Key Bitcoin price metrics point to BTC downside below $22.5K - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) faced a one-hour $1,420 pullback on March 3 following Silvergate Bank\u2019s 57.7% stock crash, which was due to significant losses and \u201csuboptimal capitalization.\u201d The U.S. fintech-friendly bank was a key financial infrastructure provider for exchanges, institutional investors and mining companies, and some investors are worried that its potential demise could have wide-ranging negative impacts on the crypto sector.\n\nThe crypto-friendly bank discontinued its digital asset payment railway \u2014 Silvergate Exchange Network \u2014 citing excessive risks. Silvergate also reportedly borrowed $3.6 billion from the U.S. Federal Home Loan Banks System, a consortium of regional banks and lenders, to mitigate the effects of a surge in withdrawals.\n\nAmong the impacted exchanges was Dubai-based Bybit, which announced the suspension of U.S. dollar transfers after March 10. The move follows Binance\u2019s international platform, which suspends U.S. dollar fiat withdrawals and deposits on Feb. 6.\n\nFiat on- and off-ramps have always been troublesome areas due to the lack of a clear regulatory environment, especially in the United States. Additional uncertainty came from The Wall Street Journal\u2019s March 3 report on iFinex, the holding company behind Tether and Bitfinex. Leaked documents and emails revealed the group reportedly relied on fake sales invoices and hid behind third parties to open bank accounts.\n\nDespite a Wall Street Journal report alleging that Tether is being investigated by the Department of Justice, USDT (USDT) is still the absolute leading stablecoin, with a $71.4 billion market capitalization. The issue has spread across the industry as Paxos, the issuer of the third-largest stablecoin, was ordered by the New York Department of Financial Services on Feb. 13 to stop issuing Binance USD (BUSD).\n\nLet\u2019s look at Bitcoin derivatives metrics to better understand how professional traders are positioned in the current market conditions.\n\nDerivatives metrics show buyers' shrinking appetite\n\nTraders should refer to the USD Coin (USDC) premium to measure the demand for cryptocurrency in Asia. The index measures the difference between China-based peer-to-peer stablecoin trades and the U.S. dollar.\n\nExcessive cryptocurrency buying demand can pressure the indicator above fair value at 104%. On the other hand, the stablecoin\u2019s market offer is flooded during bearish markets, causing a 4% or higher discount.\n\nUSDC peer-to-peer vs. USD/CNY. Source: OKX\n\nThe USDC premium indicator in Asian markets has been slightly positive for the past three weeks, but it is nowhere near the substantial 4% premium from early January. In addition, the metric shows weakening demand for stablecoins in Asia, down from 2.5% in the previous week.\n\nStill, the present 1.5% premium should be interpreted as positive considering the bearish newsflow regarding crypto-fiat payment railways.\n\nBitcoin's quarterly futures are the preferred instruments of whales and arbitrage desks. These fixed-month contracts usually trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are requesting more money to withhold settlement longer.\n\nConsequently, futures contracts should trade at a 5%\u201310% annualized premium in healthy markets. This situation is known as \u201ccontango\u201d and is not exclusive to crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe chart shows that traders abandoned any prospects of exiting the neutral-to-bearish area on March 3 as the basis indicator moved away from the 5% threshold. However, the current 3% premium is lower than last week\u2019s 4.5%, reflecting fewer investors\u2019 optimism.\n\nOn the bright side, the 6.2% drop in BTC price had a near uneventful impact on Bitcoin futures markets. Higher demand for bearish bets using leverage would have moved the basis indicator to the negative area, known as \u201cbackwardation.\u201d\n\nAdditional volatility is expected on March 14\n\nIn the week following Feb. 27, Bitcoin\u2019s price lost 4.5%, indicating that investors are effectively worried about contagion from Silvergate Bank. Even though crypto exchanges and stablecoin providers have denied exposure to the troubled fintech firm, the cut-off from its payment processing system has raised uncertainty.\n\nAnalysts are now focused on the announcement of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data on March 14. As Cointelegraph noted, CPI prints tend to spark short-term volatility across risk assets, although often short-lived in Bitcoin\u2019s price movements.\n\nDerivatives metrics currently point to limited pressure from the Silvergate Bank saga, but the odds favor Bitcoin bears, considering the diminishing demand for stablecoins in Asia and the BTC futures premium.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Like a currency, you can use it to pay for things. Like a digital asset, you can invest in it for long-term gains.</li>\n\n<li>You\u2019re not buying a currency; you\u2019re buying the idea behind the coin, which is supported by an underlying blockchain technology. <em>Blockchain technology</em> is a distributed ledger that records a growing list of data.</li>\n\n<li>Cryptocurrency investing is very new, so its investment resources are constantly evolving.</li>\n\n<li>Always read about the background of a cryptocurrency, its underlying technology, its management, and its community before investing. Ask yourself what problem a cryptocurrency is trying to solve and why that solution matters.</li>\n\n<li>If you\u2019re buying a cryptocurrency to hold long term, you\u2019re looking for <em>capital appreciation.</em> If you\u2019re actively getting in and out of trades, you\u2019re <em>speculating.</em></li>\n\n<li>The cryptocurrency market is extremely volatile.

What does that mean? It means that instead of panicking when the prices drop to a dip, it may be the best time for you to buy. Don\u2019t buy when the prices have gone up so much in a short amount of time and the markets are hyped up. Of course, for all your investment decisions, you must analyze the market from different points than just the low price.</li>\n\n<li>Diversify your portfolio with at least five cryptocurrencies from different categories to manage your risk.

Pay attention to the following key components when you do your crypto research:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>The crypto\u2019s white paper: </strong>A <em>white paper</em> is something like a business proposal for new cryptocurrencies. It includes everything potential investors need to know about the crypto, such as technology, purpose, financial details, and so on. Think of it as your crypto\u2019s resume.</li>\n\n<li><strong>The team behind the crypto: </strong>No one really knows who created Bitcoin, but the rest of the cryptocurrencies out there normally have a team behind them who guide the company and its blockchain technology. Make sure to find out about team members\u2019 experience in the field, their motivations, and their authority.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Partnerships: </strong>If you\u2019re not willing to take a lot of risk, seeing who in the industry has put their trust in the hands of the cryptocurrency you\u2019re considering buying is very important. Another good thing about having partners in the traditional world is that the cryptocurrency may have a higher chance of being accepted by the masses.</li>\n\n<li><strong>The crypto\u2019s technology: </strong>Many cryptocurrencies are tokens from blockchain companies with multiple products. The more you get to know the products and the technology behind the cryptocurrency, the better.</li>\n\n<li><strong>The crypto\u2019s contribution to society: </strong>What problem is this cryptocurrency trying to solve? Does it matter to you? Is the team behind the cryptocurrency just trying to get rich quick, or does it have a long-term plan for the betterment of society? Finding answers to these questions can help you decide whether you should consider buying this cryptocurrency.</li>\n\n<li><strong>The road map: </strong>Many companies behind cryptocurrencies have sections on their websites dedicated to their road maps: where they come from, what they\u2019ve achieved, and what they\u2019re planning to accomplish in the future. If available, road maps are a great way to discover a ton of fundamental information about the crypto in a few minutes.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\"}],\"videoInfo\":{\"videoId\":null,\"name\":null,\"accountId\":null,\"playerId\":null,\"thumbnailUrl\":null,\"description\":null,\"uploadDate\":null}},\"sponsorship\":{\"sponsorshipPage\":false,\"backgroundImage\":{\"src\":null,\"width\":0,\"height\":0},\"brandingLine\":\"\",\"brandingLink\":\"\",\"brandingLogo\":{\"src\":null,\"width\":0,\"height\":0},\"sponsorAd\":\"\",\"sponsorEbookTitle\":\"\",\"sponsorEbookLink\":\"\",\"sponsorEbookImage\":{\"src\":null,\"width\":0,\"height\":0}},\"primaryLearningPath\":\"Advance\",\"lifeExpectancy\":\"One

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nU.S. Congressman Stephen Lynch (D-MA) expressed concern Wednesday over the possible impact of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), asking Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to ponder the potential for a tokenized version of the U.S. dollar to wipe out other digital assets.\n\nLynch's comments came as Powell testified before the House Financial Services Committee, fielding a series of questions about digital assets.\n\n\u201cI'm worried about a lot of these stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cDo they go to zero when we come up with a CBDC that has the full faith and credit of the United States behind it?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Fed has explored the concept of issuing a digital dollar for years, publishing research as far back as 2016. CBDCs are similar to digital tokens in use today like stablecoins\u2014which track the price of a fiat currency\u2014but are managed by their respective governments instead of being issued by private firms on decentralized networks.\n\nPowell indicated it\u2019s unclear to him why any cryptocurrency that isn\u2019t \u201cdrawing on the credibility of the dollar\u201d like Bitcoin or Ethereum has any value at all, regardless of a CBDC\u2019s release. He refrained from commenting on how they could possibly be impacted by a CBDC as a result.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never understood the valuation of those,\u201d Powell said regarding coins that \u201c\u200b\u200bdon't have any intrinsic value, but nonetheless, trade for a positive number.\u201d\n\nHe also suggested it\u2019s hard to judge how stablecoins would be impacted, citing a lack of regulation in the U.S. that renders the reserves of some stablecoins opaque.\n\nStablecoins like Tether have faced penalties in the past for making false statements about their token\u2019s backing. And last month, Paxos said it was preparing for a potential lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission over its Binance-branded stablecoin BUSD.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLegislation that would provide a regulatory framework for stablecoins has been introduced on Capitol Hill several times, yet each bill so far has failed to gain momentum. Last summer's collapse of Terra\u2019s UST, a so-called algorithmic stablecoin that maintained its value via code instead of being backed by assets, created renewed urgency among lawmakers to establish rules of the road.\n\nEleven countries have already launched a CBDC and nearly 90 countries are either piloting, developing, or researching a CBDC, according to the Atlantic Council\u2019s CBDC tracker. Lynch asked Powell for an update on the Fed\u2019s timeline for potentially releasing one too.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t give you a date,\u201d Powell responded. \u201cWe engage with the public on an ongoing basis. We\u2019re also doing research on policy and also on technology.\u201d\n\nPowell said that the Fed hasn\u2019t yet determined whether a CBDC is an innovation that\u2019s even needed in the U.S., adding the central bank is not at the \u201cstage of making any real decisions.\u201d\n\nHe described the development of a CBDC as being in an early, experimental phase, adding the technology will take years to evaluate. However, Powell indicated that a CBDC could be rapidly rolled out to the public if it\u2019s decided upon by Congress, saying \u201cI think we can get this into the hands of the public very quickly.\u201d\n\nNew York\u2019s Federal Reserve bank has previously engaged in an experiment that simulated how a tokenized dollar could work among financial institutions, launching a pilot program last November that included firms like BNY Mellon and Citi.\n\nOther lawmakers, including French Hill (R-AR), asked Powell questions related to CBDCs, such as whether the Fed chairman still holds the belief that a CBDC would need authorization from Congress.\n\nPowell responded that the U.S. central bank might not need written approval from Congress to establish a CBDC, at least for financial institutions, explaining a \u201cwholesale\u201d CBDC could be a valid for settling transfers between banks and other financial institutions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPowell had previously said that establishing a tokenized version of the U.S. dollar would need written approval from Congress, but he clarified in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee that the need applies to a CBDC for \u201cretail\u201d consumers.\n\n\u201cWe've always been talking about [a] retail CBDC, and that's something we would certainly need congressional approval for,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThere are potential forms of a wholesale CBDC that we\u2019d need to look at. It's less clear.\u201d\n\nPowell added that it\u2019s also a valid question to ask why a wholesale CBDC would be needed, alluding to the upcoming launch of FedNow, an instant payment service for Federal Reserve Banks that is set to launch later this year.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers like Tom Emmer have pushed for legislation that would ban the Fed from releasing a CBDC, saying it would erode Americans\u2019 right to financial privacy. He reintroduced the legislation shortly after the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco started accepting job applications for CBDC developers and designers."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBlock, Inc. thinks it and developers can build better Bitcoin mining rigs. That's why it's considering building a \u201cMining Development Kit,\u201d or MDK, it said on Tuesday.\n\nThe company hopes its do-it-yourself kit will spur innovation in Bitcoin mining hardware, it said in an announcement, alluding to a statement from CEO Jack Dorsey on Twitter in 2021 that the company was \u201cconsidering building a Bitcoin mining system based on custom silicon and open source.\u201d\n\nBlock wrote it would share more details in the coming weeks and months but mused that the MDK would include basic Bitcoin mining rig components, like a hashboard and controller board, open source firmware, software, and lots of documentation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe anticipate the MDK being useful for development projects focused on integrating Bitcoin mining into various novel use cases\u2014such as heating solutions, off-grid mining, home mining or intermittent power applications\u2014as well as optimization of Bitcoin mining hardware for traditional commercial mining operations,\u201d Naoise Irwin, Block mining hardware senior product lead, wrote in a blog post.\n\nBlock didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.\n\nIrwin, who\u2019s also the co-founder of solar heating company SolarFlux, joined Block last month after starting his career on Wall Street in 2000 and transitioning to tech and strategy a decade later.\n\nAround this time last year, Block, Inc. announced it had contributed $5 million to a partnership with Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla and infrastructure company Blockstream to pilot an all-solar Bitcoin mining facility in Texas.\n\nSince then, Block has also started designing its own Bitcoin mining semiconductor chips\u2014commonly referred to as ASICs, which stands for application specific integrated circuits.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s not totally out of place, although hardware accounted for less than 1% of a Block\u2019s $17 billion total net revenue in 2022. The bulk of it was generated from transactions, services, and Bitcoin. Block generates Bitcoin revenue when it buys and then sells BTC to its customers, like through its Cash App.\n\nThe rest came from hardware, which accounted for $164 million of that total, according to SEC filings.\n\nBut the company said it\u2019s set to make a big push into the \u201cBitcoin ecosystem\u201d with Spiral, an independent team contributing to open source projects; TBD, an open decentralized finance developer platform; and hardware projects, like its mining rigs and a self-custody wallet.\n\n\u201cWe believe our bitcoin ecosystem can help address inefficiencies in the current financial system, especially with respect to identity and trust,\u201d the company wrote in its annual report.\n\nStill, it had to disclose it\u2019s taken the same kind of battering on its Bitcoin holdings as other publicly traded companies. By the end of 2022, Block has invested a cumulative $220 million in Bitcoin. After factoring in a $118 million impairment loss, the fair market value of Block\u2019s BTC was $133 million.\n\nAlthough the company\u2019s share price experienced a 21% boost since the start of the year, investors don\u2019t yet seem swayed by Block\u2019s Bitcoin aspirations. The company\u2019s shares ended trading on Tuesday at $78.04, down 3% for the day."

        "content": "Ordinals are here to stay. Ordinals, or the ability to permanently ink the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain with data, typically in the format of a picture or JPEG, are a controversial topic among some members of the Bitcoin and wider crypto community. Not so for the builders and the CEOs of Bitcoin-focused companies who were present at the Advancing Bitcoin conference in London.\n\nCointelegraph asked several CEOs, builders and key opinion leaders for their views on Ordinals throughout the conference. The overarching sentiment ranged from curiosity to indifference to deference.\n\nAlex Leishman, CEO of River, told Cointelegraph that he doesn\u2019t have a stance on ordinals just yet, but has recently been gifted an Ordinal:\n\n\"In the abstract, the idea of having this sort of like meta-layer on top of Bitcoin that tracks Sats; that has a separate state or mapping onto the blockchain is really fascinating and could potentially be interesting for other things.\"\n\nFor example, Leishman said he recently played a clone of the classic computer game Doom (called Yet Another Doom Clone) on an Ordinal. \u201cSomeone had embedded Doom in JavaScript and in a small web page in an Ordinal,\u201d which Leishman loaded up from the blockchain.\n\nReal gameplay of Yet Another Doom Clone loaded from an Ordinal. Source\n\nEric Sirion, co-founder of and advisor to Fedi, and maintainer of the open-source protocol Fedimint, told Cointelegraph that he\u2019s also \u201cpretty neutral\u201d on Ordinals:\n\n\u201cEssentially, we cannot do anything about it in a way that is morally consistent. Like if we try to fight it, what gives us the right to do that? And also, we cannot effectively fight it. [\u2026] So yeah, why get worked up about it?\u201d\n\nSirion added that he\u2019s not necessarily a fan of Ordinals as they might blow up the blockchain a bit, but said: \u201cWho am I to tell other people what to do with the fees they pay like?\u201d\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain has since \u201cbloated,\u201d reaching an average block size all-time high, but fees have remained more or less consistent.\n\nAverage block size has soared higher since ordinals. Source: Blockchain.com\n\nBenoit Mazouk, CEO of U.K.-based Bitcoin exchange BitcoinPoint, shared Sirion\u2019s concerns about blockchain congestion. Mazouk explained that while he understands key Bitcoin opinion leaders, such as Blockstream CEO Adam Back, who commented that ordinals are \u201cuseless,\u201d he\u2019s \u201cmore into Bitcoin as a currency.\u201d\n\n\"you can't stop them\" well ofc! bitcoin is designed to be censor resistant. doesn't stop us mildly commenting on the sheer waste and stupidity of an encoding. at least do something efficient. otherwise it's another proof of consumption of block-space thingy. \u2014 Adam Back (@adam3us) January 29, 2023\n\nPerhaps a greater concern is that users can upload graphic images and offensive data onto the blockchain. Recently, shock porn was uploaded as an Ordinal.\n\nHowever, the permanence and censorship resistance works both ways: Leishman states that permanent records for potentially important or culturally significant events can be permanently etched into the blockchain. \u201cOrdinals can eventually become composable and it's really truly censorship resistant content,\u201d Leishman commented.\n\nRelated: Yuga Labs\u2019 first Bitcoin NFT auction nets $16.5M in 24 hours\n\nChristian Keroles, managing director at Bitcoin Magazine, recently posted a culturally topical reference to the censuring of Roahl Dahl books, questioning whether the minting of banned books on the blockchain as a form of preservation would be worthwhile.\n\nMaybe banned books are worth inscribing to Bitcoin \u200d\u2640\ufe0f https://t.co/WXpDYk4rzs \u2014 ck (going to Bitcoin 2023) (@ck_SNARKs) February 28, 2023\n\nIn all, Ordinals are beginning to change the way Bitcoin advocates use and approach Bitcoin. Ordinals offer another use case to the Bitcoin network over its first one: peer-to-peer cash. Leishman sums it up:\n\n\u201cMaybe the Bitcoin database has value for other things, and they're willing to pay for it, which is good for miners and maybe is what actually.\u201d\n\nMiners have earned more revenue per block since Ordinals\u2019 introduction, while video game fans can rest assured that a recreation of Doom is playable, loaded from the Bitcoin blockchain."

        "content": "The ongoing cryptocurrency winter and massive collapses in the industry do not mean that digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC) are doomed to fail, according to a major European asset manager.\n\nDespite BTC failing to protect investors against rising inflation in 2021 and 2022, Bitcoin\u2019s limited supply may still attract more attention if inflation remains above central banks\u2019 targets, according to investment executives at Paris-based investment manager Amundi.\n\nAmundi chief investment officer Vincent Mortier and macroeconomist Tristan Perrier on March 2 released a thematic paper analyzing the state and the perspectives of the crypto market. The executives argued that Bitcoin has failed to serve as an inflation hedge over the past two years due to \u201cdramatic rises in policy and market interest rates\u201d that pressured \u201call asset classes.\u201d\n\nAccording to the paper\u2019s authors, nominal interest rates are likely to stop surging or may even fall if inflation is high, but not rising. Such a situation would potentially lead to a bull market for Bitcoin, the Amundi investment execs said, stating:\n\n\u201cThis is a much more favorable environment for an asset whose supply is finite and that has a long duration in essence, as its main attraction is its future potential rather than its current status.\u201d\n\nThe analysts also provided five reasons why the recent setbacks in the crypto industry \u2014 including collapses of firms such as FTX and Celsius \u2014 may not mean the end of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe recent crisis is likely to bring more realistic expectations from the industry and \u201cseparate the wheat from the chaff,\u201d the Amundi executives said. They compared crypto to blue-chip tech stocks, which also experienced wild price collapses before starting to thrive. The analysts also noted that the current market downturn still comes in line with Bitcoin\u2019s historical price cycles.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price historical chart. Source: CoinGecko\n\nMortier and Perrier mentioned Ethereum\u2019s successful shift to a proof-of-stake blockchain, highlighting the industry\u2019s capabilities in reducing energy consumption. The executives also noted that the key value propositions of crypto, such as decentralization and immutability of transactions, have not been touched by the crisis.\n\nAnother reason is that prominent companies in finance and other industries have not stopped expressing their interest in crypto entirely, with heavyweights such as BlackRock acquiring a stake in Circle in 2022.\n\nRelated: France on the verge of passing stringent crypto firm licensing laws\n\nFinally, regulation will likely bring a more positive impact on the industry despite certainly causing temporary price setbacks, the analysts argued. They stressed that many regulators have eventually preferred not to put a blanket ban on crypto after several attempts and that advanced economies now see it as a possibility.\n\nDespite expressing some level of bullishness toward the future of crypto, Amundi\u2019s investment executives still noted that the real economic utility of crypto \u201cstill needs to be fully confirmed.\u201d That would need widespread use of public blockchains in the real economy and the associated non-speculative demand, the experts noted."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nJudges overseeing Grayscale\u2019s lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) questioned the financial watchdog Tuesday, digging into the agency\u2019s basis for denying Grayscale\u2019s application to establish a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe questions came during oral arguments in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, overseen by Judges Sri Srinivasan, Neomi Rao, and Harry Edwards. Grayscale initiated legal action against the SEC in June of last year, after an application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot market Bitcoin ETF was rejected.\n\nA core element of the SEC\u2019s argument, delivered by SEC Senior Counsel Emily Parise, is that Grayscale\u2019s application lacked data necessary to confidentially determine \u201cwhether fraud and manipulation in the spot market impacts futures [markets] in the same way.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Judge Neomi Rao said it seems the futures price of Bitcoin is a derivative of the asset\u2019s spot price which move together 99.9% of the time. She said the SEC has not provided evidence that Grayscale\u2019s claims are wrong.\n\n\u201cIt seems like there\u2019s quite a bit of information on how these markets work together,\" Rao said, adding that the SEC \"really needs to explain... how it understands the relationship between Bitcoin futures and the spot price of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nOn behalf of Grayscale, former U.S. Solicitor General Don Verrilli argued that the SEC\u2019s denial of Grayscale\u2019s application to convert GBTC into a spot market Bitcoin ETF contradicted previous decisions \u201cgiving the green light\u201d for futures-based ETFs to trade in the U.S.\n\nHe described the SEC\u2019s denial as \u201cthe definition of arbitrary decision-making,\u201d arguing that Grayscale\u2019s spot market ETF would pose the \u201csame risk of fraud and manipulation\u201d that currently approved Bitcoin products that trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).\n\nGrayscale first submitted an application to convert GBTC into an ETF in 2016. According to the company\u2019s website, it holds more than $14 billion worth of assets in the product.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCurrently, shares of GBTC trade at significantly less than the underlying value of the Bitcoin held by Grayscale in its trust partly due to the product\u2019s structure, which prevents shares from being redeemed for Bitcoin. If it were converted into a spot market ETF, shares of BTC would likely track the price of Bitcoin more closely as arbitragers trade the difference away.\n\nAs of Tuesday, shares of GBTC traded at a 42% discount relative to the assets under management by Grayscale in the trust, a gap that\u2019s reached nearly 49% at its widest, according to Ycharts. However, shares climbed upwards of 7.6% to $12.68 amid Tuesday\u2019s oral arguments.\n\nAs of now, no spot-based Bitcoin ETF has been approved in the U.S. by the SEC, which has rejected numerous applications since the Winklevoss twins filed for a Bitcoin ETF-like trust in 2013. But Bitcoin ETFs based on futures contracts have traded in the U.S. since ProShares' Bitcoin futures ETF launched on the New York Stock Exchange in October 2021.\n\nThe SEC has repeatedly cited its mandate to protect investors in the U.S. while rejecting spot-based Bitcoin ETF applications. When Grayscale\u2019s application to convert GBTC into a spot market Bitcoin ETF was rejected last year, the financial watchdog said that Grayscale's application did not do enough to provide protection from \u201cfraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.\""

        "title": "An Adventurers Guide to the Bitcoin-Based Ordinals NFT - NFT Plazas",
        "content": "An Adventurers Guide to the Bitcoin-Based Ordinals NFT\n\nOrdinals are inscriptions of content onto individual satoshis that can be tracked and held by users. The data is purely on chain, doesn\u2019t rely on other protocols, and will therefore survive as long as the bitcoin blockchain is up and running. Many new services have emerged that allow users to inscribe, hold, and sell inscriptions. Everyone is doing it. It\u2019s all the rage.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAt the beginning of this year, a bitcoin developer named Casey Rodarmor released a bitcoin native protocol called ordinals, that allows individual satoshis to be \u201cinscribed\u201d with arbitrary data, enabling them to host images directly on the bitcoin network\u2026 no third party image hosting services, no links required, all directly on chain. This is a significant contribution to the bitcoin network that opens up a world of possibilities for the blockchain that most regard simply as a monetary instrument. This innovation has been met with strong opinions from both sides of the emotional spectrum. Bitcoin maxis regard it as graffiti on the blockchain that threatens to clog up the mempool, raise mining fees to untenable levels, and possible introduce exploits. Others see this as a breakthrough innovation that allows bitcoin to be a platform for free expression. Since its launch just weeks ago, almost 300,000 \u201cinscriptions\u201d (the Ordinal term for NFTs) have been created, and that number is quickly growing. Even projects like Yuga labs, famous for their Bored Ape Yacht Club collection, has decided to jump in with a new project.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nOrdinals are called ordinals because in number theory it denotes that numbers signify an order. Ordinal numbers are integers (natural numbers like 1, 2, 3\u2026) and can be used to identify an objects place in a list. Satoshis, the fundamental unit of bitcoin where each Satoshi is worth 1 / 100,000,000) of a bitcoin are not naturally ordered and do not have unique identifiers. When people transfer Satoshis between each other, as Casey Rodarmor puts it, they are held in a Satoshi goo superposition, indistinguishable from one another. This was the first basic innovation of Ordinals, creating a protocol that identifies and tracks individual satoshis. The details are somewhat complex, so feel free to read more about ordinal theory on the Ordinals website.\n\nNow that individual satoshis have unique identifiers and can be tracked across the blockchain, they can be inscribed with content. The details of this are also complex, but essentially they are inscribed through an envelope serializing procedure that recognizes the ordinal protocol, denotes the inscription content type, and then includes the actual data in the OP_FALSE and OP_PUSH sections of a bitcoin transaction. Altogether, \u201cthe inscription content is contained within the input of a reveal transaction, and the inscription is made on the first sat of its first output.\u201d\n\nOne very important thing to note about inscriptions is that they are inherently limited by the megabyte contents of a bitcoin block. This means that currently 4MB is a hard cap on the size of the data one can inscribe. However, in reality the current practical limit is considerably smaller than that, around 400kb. The reason for this lower limit is because larger data will not be relayed by the Bitcoin Core. The only exception to this is bitcoin miners who have the ability to accept and transmit larger transactions. So yeah, 400kb for the average user. That\u2019s pretty small, which is an interesting constraint on the type of content that can be hosted there. Its also important to mention that the cost of an inscription is directly related primarily to the size of the inscription, as well as how in demand blockspace is at the time of inscription.\n\nNow that we have some of the basics and mechanics down, lets dive into how you can start inscribing, browsing inscriptions, finding a marketplace where these are bought and sold, and holding your inscription (heads up: it will need an ordinal compliant bitcoin taproot wallet). At first, inscribing and holding inscriptions required a lot from its users. You had to be running a full bitcoin node using Bitcoin Core 24 or newer. Even getting to this stage is a task beyond the reach of most. Syncing a full node \u2013 meaning the entire history of the blockchain \u2013 requires several days or weeks of downloading time, and a large disk on which to store the almost 500GB. Once the full node is synced, a few configurations need to be implemented using the command line in the bitcoin node. Additionally, the Ordinal client needs to be installed, and can only be interacted with on a command line basis. A taproot bitcoin wallet is needed otherwise inscribed sats could be accidentally lost and transferred. It\u2019s a lot, and not for beginners.\n\nWallets\n\nLuckily, with the enthusiasm for Ordinals, several companies have developed tools that accomplish all this for you\u2026 and they are growing and developing at a blistering pace. Lets start with wallets. As mentioned, you need a bitcoin Taproot wallet that plays nicely with the ordinal client to ensure you can hold your inscriptions without accidentally transferring them. Several wallets have stepped up to the plate. Two of the best available are Sparrow Wallet and Hiro Wallet. These are both fairly wysiwyg, and there are good guides on how to use them for managing inscriptions. Additional available ordinals wallets include ordinalswallet.com and xverse.app.\n\nInscription Services\n\nNow that you have a wallet that can hold and manage inscriptions, lets talk about resources that allow you to make your own inscriptions. There are two that have really risen to prominence in these early days. The first one is gamma.io. Gamma was one of the first out of the gate offering ordinal minting services, and they have been rapidly developing new tools. Their basic service is an incredibly simple 5 step process that involves choosing the type of data (single image, or text), drag and dropping data to be uploaded and inscribed, fee estimation for the inscription, giving your ordinal compliant wallet address, and finally payment for the inscription. Its really simple once you have the wallet figured out. In their recent tweet, they described some new functionality including minting in bulk (multiple inscriptions at the same time), linking inscriptions to higher resolution assets that are hosted off chain, and generating a dedicated collection page for users. All very cool stuff! Additional minting services that are worth mentioning include inscribenow.io, ordinalsbot.com, ordswap.io, ordimint.com, and generative.xyz.\n\nToday, we\u2019re announcing one of our biggest releases yet \u2014 one we know will change the game for #Bitcoin Ordinals: Ordinal Collection Mints \ud83d\udc8e In our typical fashion, this isn\u2019t just a bulk mint option. It\u2019s so much more. Buckle up\u2026 \ud83e\uddf5 \u2014 Gamma.io (@trygamma) February 28, 2023\n\nMARKETPLACES\n\nWith all the sustained hype around Ordinals, its no surprise a multitude of marketplaces have come into being that allow users to buy and sell inscriptions. In general, there is significant overlap between inscription services, wallets, and marketplaces. Nevertheless, to date, there are a few key players in the space. Marketplaces are either trusted or trustless, meaning that you either rely on the marketplace to act as an intermediary between buyer and seller (trusted) or not (trustless). Trustless marketplaces typically use a PBST mechanism which stands for \u201cpartially signed bitcoin transaction,\u201d which allows buyer and seller to put funds and inscriptions in a conditional contract that only executes when all conditions are met. Trustless intermediaries are more in line with the ethos of decentralization, but both have been working seamlessly for all parties. Additionally, these marketplaces are their own islands: there is currently not a general marketplace where all ordinals that are for sale are listed. Each of the following marketplaces have a unique set of ordinals for sale. The most used frequently used sites are ordinals.market, ordswap.io, ordina.ls, and scarce.city. Of these, Scarce.City is worth distinguishing based on the fact that they are an auction house that has been in the space since the beginning of #rarepepe, which makes their prestige, longevity, and mechanism of sale orthogonal to the other marketplaces mentioned. Another class of buying and selling avenues worth mentioning are the various telegram and discord communities that have sprung up like wildflowers around this space. There are innumerable ordinal projects / collections that have bespoke chat spaces devoted to them, where buyers and sellers often meet.\n\nRESOURCES\n\nThe last class of repositories worth sharing are general informational sites. We are still very much in the early days of ordinals, but as a type of digital asset, they seem to have the hallmarks of one that will stand the test of time. Data inscribed on the most trusted, longest running, and widely adopted blockchain is a recipe for longevity. This innovation has actually caused me to reconceptualized the purpose and significance of bitcoin: I see it now as not just the most innovative monetary instrument in the history of humanity, but now it\u2019s a time capsule that preserve information longer and further into the future than any other that I am aware of. This is historic. Coming to this realization and understanding has required uncountable hours scouring the web for small scraps of information. The best way for you to begin that knowledge journey is by first reading ALL of the information contained on ordinals.com. Next, I recommend searching for any and all podcasts that Casey Rodarmor has done (which are many), and listening to all the nuance of his technical explanations and plans for the future. We are currently in V1, so to speak. After that, getting involved in the various chat rooms and visiting all the resources mentioned here will help crystallize your understanding of the mechanics. Here are a few podcasts and videos you might invest some time listening to: resource1, resource2, resource3, resource4.\n\nI hope you have enjoyed this explainer. I know it\u2019s a lot. All new technologies are, even though most of them will fail. For my money, I strongly recommend investing the time to learn about Ordinals. They are not going anywhere, and understanding them with a level of nuance is an easily claimed feather in the cap that even many seasoned crypto enthusiasts have yet to claim. Bitcoin native NFTs are a significant advancement of human ingenuity and the possibilities portended by the bitcoin network.\n\nFollow me @DANCETURN to receive regular updates about ordinals, what they mean, how they are changing the game, and the latest Ordinal tech.

And now, Norway is hosting the world\u2019s \u201cmost Bitcoin experience\u201d \u2014 Northern Lightning 2023.\n\nA pure-signal conference\n\nNorthern Lightning 2023 will take place in Bergen, Norway, from March 17\u201319, and the Norwegians are going all out.\n\nEverything has been designed for and by Bitcoiners: from the keynotes to the food, the parties and the merch. Merch will be limited to 21 numbered copies. Our vision is to create an annual, intimate experience bringing Bitcoin to a new Nordic city each year until \u201chyperbitcoinization\u201d is achieved and beyond.\n\nThis first edition will be a three-day Bitcoin conference in a historical setting among Bergen\u2019s dramatic scenery and wooden harbors, headlined by the greatest minds in Bitcoin, with the opportunity to orange pill hundreds of no-coiners at a massive party running on the Lightning Network.\n\nHodlonaut, Knut Svanholm and Peter Todd are just some of the great Bitcoiners who will be joining, covering topics like monetary liberation, Bitcoin adoption and lightning innovation.\n\nFocused on bringing Bitcoiners together and creating deep connections with minimal stage staring, Northern Lightning also wants to provide the purest signal anywhere. Even the DJs are Bitcoiners.\n\nA rave running on Lightning?\n\nEven the DJs? Yes.\n\nThe highlight of Northern Lightning will be one of the world's largest AFK Bitcoin onboarding events \u2014 an all-night rave with hundreds of no-coiners set to use Lightning. Headlined by Norway\u2019s leading electronic artists, including Karolinski, Matiago, Klysterik, Antibakke and Trym S\u00f8vdsnes, it is set to be a unique orange-pilling opportunity. A lineup this good would fill any venue. So, what happens when 400 thirsty no-coiners meet 200 Bitcoiners, and they all need to use Lightning to buy a beer?\n\nWith the goal of creating an unforgettable, real-world experience of Bitcoin for everyone every year, a rave running on Lightning is a perfect start. Partygoers can use Lightning when buying drinks, renting towels or buying merch, and even buying Bitcoin for cash peer-to-peer when onboarding.\n\nIt\u2019s all designed to offer a little less conversation and more Bitcoin action.\n\nAnd as for the venue, Smien Laksev\u00e5g Verft is Bergen\u2019s oldest ship wharf, recently converted into a nightclub opening directly onto the fjord, which will offer free welcome drinks, as well as sauna use and an all-night barbecue.\n\nNot only for adults\n\nTalk of raves may not appeal to the more family-oriented, but Northern Lightning 2023 has got you and your little ones covered, too.\n\nMy own daughter, Lykushka (who is nine), is organizing the kids\u2019 corner and workshop, a space to educate young minds about Bitcoin while having lots of fun. I love when my kids make friends with other Bitcoiners\u2019 kids; they\u2019re usually brilliant too.\n\nKIDS' CORNER & WORKSHOP \u26a1#NorthernLightning 2023 is proud to present our new project lead for the #Bitcoin kids experience.\n\n\n\nLykushka (9) will ensure it's safe and fun to bring your family:https://t.co/EPM8MpfQGn pic.twitter.com/Tez9kKlW0J \u2014 Erik Dale \u26a1 (@EuroDale) February 24, 2023\n\nWhether the event will make them think mommy and daddy are more or less nuts remains to be seen, but they will be welcomed every day until 10 pm Central European Time at Northern Lightning.\n\nAlmost sold out\n\nNorthern Lightning is less than two weeks away, and passes are selling out fast.\n\nThe main conference pass, including access to keynotes, workshops, dinners, meetups and parties, will sell out this weekend. After that, only limited passes will be available, but the limited passes are pretty awesome, and you won\u2019t want to miss out.\n\nCointelegraph is sending a crew to cover Northern Lightning 2023. Join us in Bergen."

        "content": "Leer en espa\u00f1ol\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s crypto barons went from eccentric social media personalities to private economic and diplomatic operators. The U.S.-born Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert are investors in the crypto company Bitfinex, directly linked to the stablecoin Tether. Raucous supporters of the adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender, they have become bureaucrats at the service of President Nayib Bukele. In two years, Keiser and Herbert \u2014who used to be propagandists for the Russian government\u2014 found in El Salvador an ideal entity to parasitize and put at the service of their agenda.\n\nBukele has given the couple the authority to design public policy that Salvadorans will eventually fund. On November 17, Bukele created the National Bitcoin Office by executive decree, requiring all executive branch offices to collaborate with the Bitcoin Office helmed by Keiser and Herbert. As part of their newfound posts in the Salvadoran government, the two were granted the ability to open \u201cBitcoin embassies\u201d in Europe and the United States.\n\nThe Bitcoin Office has recruited Salvadoran-American Bitcoin enthusiast Gerson Mart\u00ednez as one of its spokespersons. Mart\u00ednez says the office reports directly to Bukele. Its function, he clarifies, is to control the entry of crypto investors to the country. In other words, Keiser, Herbert, and Mart\u00ednez are gatekeepers of crypto investment in El Salvador.\n\nIt is not clear how Bukele funds the office, who works there, or whether the three are compensated with taxpayer money. Mart\u00ednez has denied receiving any compensation. However, for Bitfinex and Tether, the strategic value of the office goes beyond money. The state office is a hub for propaganda and corporate diplomacy for the crypto corporations. Bukele has given Bitfinex a diplomatic fa\u00e7ade providing an aura of respectability. It is not new for crypto barons to use fronts to gain legitimacy and access new markets at a moment of low public trust in their organizations. On March 3, The Wall Street Journal revealed how Bitfinex and Tether allegedly used fake documents and shell companies to open bank accounts and evade international financial controls.\n\nIn events organized by the Bukele administration, it is common to see Bitcoin gurus Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert attend as special guests. Photo: Carlos Barrera/El Faro\n\nThe executive order that birthed the Bitcoin Office suggests that the entity displaces and replaces Salvadoran diplomacy itself and, therefore, weakens the official role of Foreign Minister Alexandra Hill. Bukele has thus legalized an apocryphal diplomacy of crypto evangelists. When Salvadoran Ambassador Milena Mayorga met in Texas with Assistant Secretary of State Joe Esparza in February, within her \u201cdelegation\u201d was Keiser, identified as an \u201cadvisor\u201d to Bukele.\n\nWith Mayorga's support, Keiser and Herbert have begun to weave a parallel network to that of El Salvador's embassies and consulates. At a conference in Switzerland, Mayorga \u201cappointed\u201d Josu\u00e9 L\u00f3pez, a young Salvadoran residing in Switzerland, as Bitcoin \u201cconsul\u201d \u2014as he calls himself\u2014 in the European country. L\u00f3pez thanked Mayorga, Keiser, Herbert, Bukele, and even Michele Foletti, a member of the Lugano municipal council, for his appointment. He never mentioned Hill. Apparently, L\u00f3pez answers to Keiser and Herbert, and not to the Foreign Ministry, which has not included him in its list of ambassadors and consuls.\n\nThe Bitcoin Office appears to be Bitfinex\u2019s puppet embedded in the Salvadoran state. Among its responsibilities will be to design, dictate, and execute public policy projects, and to deploy a network of apocryphal diplomats serving as an echo chamber for official and corporate propaganda, merging both into the same choir. The office helps Bitfinex to navigate the troubled sea of cryptocurrency and the regulatory onslaught of these assets in the United States.\n\nBitfinex's appetite is not waning; the next domino is the release of the volcano bonds. These will be public debt issued by El Salvador, partly in exchange for funds to build Bitcoin City in La Uni\u00f3n. Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino has said that his company wants to commercialize the bonds.\n\nKeiser and Herbert are crypto maximalists who have learned to love financial and political centralization as long as it serves their interests. Rather than importing a new way of doing business, Bitfinex and Bukele replicate the old script that has plagued Salvadoran history: using the Executive branch as a Trojan horse for the personal and corporate interests of a few at the expense of the majority. Let\u2019s see what Bukele gets from this deal in return.\n\nRicardo Valencia is an assistant professor of communications at California State University, Fullerton. Twitter: @ricardovalp"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe chairman of the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has taken a firm stance against the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC)\u2019s subtle power creep over the digital asset market.\n\nRostin Behnam told the Senate Agriculture Committee on Wednesday that Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency next to Bitcoin, is a commodity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been listed on CFTC exchanges for quite some time, and for that reason,\u201d said Behnam, who argued that it creates a \u201cdirect jurisdictional hook\u201d for the agency to police both ETH\u2019s derivatives market and underlying market.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHis opinion appears to directly contradict that of SEC chairman Gary Gensler, who argued last month that \u201ceverything other than Bitcoin\u201d falls under securities laws. While not naming any names, the chairman has hinted many times that this would include Ethereum\u2014especially after the network transitioned to a proof of stake consensus mechanism.\n\nUnder the Howey Test, a security counts as an asset sold to raise money from the public, from which they expect profits based on the efforts of others. Gensler\u2019s own words reinforced this in January 2022. However, under the securities act, the definition can be much broader.\n\nComments in late November suggested that Behnam had come to agree with the SEC chief that Ethereum fell under this umbrella, but his argument Wednesday shows that he is standing by his long-held position that there\u2019s room for more than one crypto commodity.\n\n\u201cWe would not have allowed the Ether futures product to be listed on a CFTC exchange if we did not feel strongly that it was a commodity asset,\u201d he elaborated, stating that his agency has \u201cserious legal defences\u201d to support their case.\n\nThe regulatory chiefs also disagree on stablecoins. While the SEC recently threatened to sue Paxos for issuing BUSD as an unregistered security, Behnam believes stablecoins should be considered commodities\u2014absent any legislation to claim otherwise.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBehnam cited an investigation into Tether during a 2021 lawsuit, after which Tether agreed to pay over $40 million to settle charges that it had lied about its dollar reserves.\n\n\u201cExamining the circumstances around the Tether case, it was clear to our enforcement team and the commission that the Tether stablecoin was a commodity, and that we needed to move forward, and swiftly, to police that market,\u201d he said."

        "content": "BTC\u2019s NUPL suggests that the coin has commenced a new bull cycle.\n\nHowever, increasing coin dump indicates a lack of investors\u2019 confidence.\n\nIn a new report, CryptoQuant analyst Sachi found that the assessment of Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) revealed that the leading coin has commenced a new bull cycle.\n\nThe NUPL is a metric used to evaluate the profit margin of the BTC market in relation to its market capitalization. A value below zero indicates an accumulation phase, while values above 0.5 suggest a distribution phase.\n\nAccording to Sachi, \u201cthe crucial threshold to monitor is 0.2.\u201d In the current market, BTC\u2019s NUPL has reached this \u201ccrucial\u201d position.\n\nThe review conducted by the analyst on BTC\u2019s historical performance found that a golden cross, which typically occurs between the 128 and 200-day moving averages, signals the end of the accumulation phase when the NUPL metric reaches or surpasses 0.2. This signifies the commencement of a bull market.\n\nSachi concluded that a bull cycle was underway as all three critical factors were present once again in the current cycle.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nAccumulation has slowed, but only because\u2026\n\nFor the first time since the unexpected fallout of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, BTC traded momentarily above the $25,000 price mark on 16 February.\n\nAlthough the king coin\u2019s price later went on to trade below $25,000, for a few weeks, investors anticipated that BTC would reclaim the price position, leading them to open several long positions.\n\nHowever, things failed to go as expected, leading to dwindling conviction in any further price rally. Investor\u2019s confidence plummeted further on 3 March when BTC\u2019s price suddenly fell by 5%, dropping from $23,500 to $22,240 due to a sense of insecurity and doubt surrounding Silvergate Capital.\n\nThis led to the liquidation of the long positions earlier opened.\n\nWhile Sachi opined that the decline in accumulation and other factors ushered in a new bull cycle, a look at on-chain data and price chart revealed otherwise.\n\nFirst, BTC\u2019s Open Interest has been in a downtrend since 21 February. The fall in Open Interest coincides with a 10% fall in the asset\u2019s value.\n\nWhen the Open Interest of a crypto asset falls, it means that the number of outstanding contracts or positions in the market has decreased.\n\nIt is often accompanied by a decline in market sentiment or a decrease in the number of traders willing to take positions in the market. As expected, this drives down the value of an asset.\n\nRead Bitcoin [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nFurther, on a daily chart, increased coin distribution has put the buyers at the sellers\u2019 mercy. Key momentum indicators such as the RSI and MFI were positioned in downward trends and rested below their respective neutral regions.\n\nLikewise, the coin\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) returned a negative -0.09 at press time, indicating the severity of coin distribution. Without a change in conviction, this usually precedes a further price drawdown.\n\nLastly, a look at BTC\u2019s funding rates across exchanges confirmed the lack of confidence that permeated the market at press time. Per data from CryptoQuant, as of this writing, short positions exceeded long positions. It was the highest negative funding rate year-to-date."

We\u2019re proud to say that since we announced the event it has been highly talked about and is now on many people's yearly must-hit conference calendars.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re extremely excited to be putting on the world's first bitcoin & lightning event in Asia,\u201d Malcolm Weed, COO of Neutronpay said, echoing Buu. \u201cBitcoin adoption is very strong across the region with countries like Vietnam (1), Philippines (2), India (4), Pakistan (6), Thailand (8), and China (10) all being in the top 10 global rankings for bitcoin adoption, making it the world's bitcoin epicenter. With over 4B people in Asia, representing half the world's population, 70% of which are unbanked, it is no wonder bitcoin adoption is so strong.\u201d\n\nStarting on March 22, the event will commence with a beach meet and greet, followed by two days of speakers who will share the latest advancements in the Bitcoin ecosystem. These presentations will cover both the technological and economic aspects of Bitcoin. Companies building on the Lightning Network are also expected to be well-represented and provide updates on the current state of affairs and exciting ongoing projects.\n\nDue to the limited availability of tickets, only 500 attendees will be able to participate. General admission two-day passes are currently priced at $500, but prices will rise again on March 22. Local Vietnamese attendees can access the non-profit event at a discounted rate of $40. The press release strongly encourages local participants to attend and learn about the technology, as well as meet Vietnamese companies that are building on Bitcoin and Lightning.\n\nSoftware developers from Vietnam that are interested in working with the Lightning Network, are encouraged to contact the organizers at info@neutronpay.com, and those interested in speaking, moderating, volunteering or sponsoring are encouraged to reach out to malcolm@neutronpay.com.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Bitcoin Miners Show Signs Of Dumping, Bad For Rally? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "On-chain data shows Bitcoin miners could be dumping right now, a sign that could provide an impedance to the rally.\n\nBitcoin Miners\u2019 Position Index Has Shot Up Recently\n\nAs pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, miners may be putting selling pressure on the market currently. The relevant indicator here is the \u201cMiners\u2019 Position Index\u201d (MPI), which measures the ratio between the miner outflows and the 365-day moving average of the same.\n\nThe \u201cminer outflows\u201d refer to the total amount of Bitcoin that all these chain validators are transferring out of their wallets at the moment. Usually, miners withdraw coins from their reserves with the main purpose of selling them. Thus, a high value of the outflows can suggest that this cohort is dumping large amounts right now.\n\nAs the MPI compares these outflows with their yearly average, the metric\u2019s value can tell us how the current miner selling is compared with the mean for the last 365 days.\n\nWhen this indicator has a high value, it means miners are selling at a higher degree than usual currently, while the metric having a low value could suggest there is lesser selling pressure coming from these chain validators than the average for the past year.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin MPI over the past year and a half:\n\nThe value of the metric seems to have been quite high in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nAs shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin MPI has spiked up recently and has hit a value of about 4, the highest level that the indicator has observed since April of last year. The metric having such a large value would suggest miners are taking out way more coins than usual, and are therefore potentially putting extraordinary selling pressure on the market currently.\n\nFrom the chart, it\u2019s apparent that spikes in the metric have usually been followed by declines in the price of the crypto. The most extreme example was back in April 2022, when the price saw a very sharp drawdown not too long after the metric recorded even higher values than now.\n\nThe last time the indicator observed high values were back during the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX when the price once again saw a rapid downward move.\n\nBitcoin has been busy rallying during the past week or so, touching as high as $21,000 so far, so these increased withdrawals right now would suggest miners want to take advantage of this profit-taking opportunity while they still can, and dump their coins.\n\nIf this cohort indeed intends to sell with these transfers, then the crypto\u2019s rally could possibly find some impedance and temporarily halt here, if not outright reverse its direction.\n\nBTC Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $20,800, up 20% in the last week.\n\nThe value of the asset seems to be finding it hard to make a significant break above $21,000 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, CryptoQuant.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "US Government Transfers 40,000 Bitcoin, Will It Affect The Price? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The Bitcoin price is under heavy pressure due to fears of \u201csticky\u201d inflation and yesterday\u2019s ultra-hawkish comments from U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) chairman Jerome Powell. At press time, BTC was trading just above $22,000 and continued to show no strength yet.\n\nAt this time comes news that the US government is in the process of selling off some of its seized Bitcoin. Blockchain security firm PeckShield first reported that addresses associated with the US government transferred 49,000 BTC worth $1.08 billion today, which were seized from the Silk Road hacker.\n\nOf that total, 9,826 BTC worth $217 million were transferred to Coinbase and 39,175 BTC worth $867 million were transferred to two new addresses. On-chain data provider Glassnode confirmed this, adding that most (so far) appear to be internal transfers, but approximately 9,861 BTC were sent to a Coinbase cluster.\n\nGlassnode also shared the chart below, displaying the estimated Bitcoin balance of the US government.\n\nPeckShield also stated that about 51,351.9 BTC of Silk Road Crime Proceeds were seized by the US government in November 2021 and March 2022 and clustered into 2 addresses.\n\nThe seized Bitcoin from founder Ross Ulbricht\u2019s legendary darknet platform \u201cSilk Road\u201d make up a large portion of the US government\u2019s holdings. While Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison without parole in 2015, he was ordered to pay $183 million in restitution related to Silk Road\u2019s total sales.\n\nBefore the marketplace was shut down, Silk Road experienced a hack in which 69,370 BTC were stolen. The government seized these Bitcoins in November 2020, and Ulbricht relinquished all rights to the Bitcoin and used them to pay the restitution.\n\nWill The US Government Impact The Bitcoin Price?\n\nA Bitcoin dump by the US government does not seem very likely according to current information. The 9,826 BTC presumably sent to Coinbase is too little to affect the price. The other funds moved appear to be internal transfers only.\n\nTherefore, a warning of a dump is by no means appropriate. Moreover, it should be emphasized that the U.S. government usually chooses a different way to sell seized Bitcoin. Usually, the sale is done through General Services Administration (GSA) auctions, where confiscated Bitcoins are auctioned off in lots to willing buyers without affecting the price.\n\nAt press time, the BTC price had to fight off the macro economic headwinds and was trading at $22,025. The $21,900 price level continues to serve as the key support for BTC.\n\nShould the level be breached to the south, a new lower low would be in play. Of particular importance then becomes the price level around $21,600 to write a higher low and maintain the uptrend in the 1-day chart.\n\nFeatured image from Medium, Chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "CryptoQuant\u2019s Bitcoin on-chain PnL index has surged above its 365-day MA recently, a crossover that has historically signaled early bull markets.\n\nBitcoin On-Chain PnL Index Has Formed A Bullish Crossover\n\nAs per data from the on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, the index is indicating a buy signal for BTC right now. The \u201cCryptoQuant on-chain PnL index\u201d is a metric that combines three different indicators into one to point out tops, bottoms, and cyclical shifts in the price of Bitcoin.\n\nThe first of the metrics that the PnL index uses is the \u201cMVRV ratio,\u201d which is a model that checks whether BTC is currently overvalued or undervalued by comparing the crypto\u2019s market cap with a fair value model called the \u201crealized cap.\u201d\n\nThe second relevant indicator here is the \u201cNUPL,\u201d which tells us whether the Bitcoin market as a whole is currently carrying an unrealized profit or an unrealized loss. This metric can provide hints about whether there is a buying or selling motive among investors right now.\n\nFinally, there is the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), which tracks whether the average holder is selling at a loss or a profit at the moment. The SOPR shouldn\u2019t be confused with the NUPL, as the quantity being measured by the NUPL is the \u201cunrealized\u201d profit/loss, which is the profit or loss that investors have accumulated but are yet to harvest (or \u201crealize\u201d) as they are still to sell their coins.\n\nThere are actually two SOPR metrics of interest here; the version specifically for the short-term holders (STHs) and that for the long-term holders (LTHs). The entire Bitcoin market can be divided into these two groups, with the criteria being that holders who bought within the last 155 days fall into the former cohort, while those who bought before that fall into the latter.\n\nNow, here is the data for the CryptoQuant on-chain PnL index, which takes all these different Bitcoin indicators and combines them into one model for the crypto:\n\nLooks like the value of the metric has shot up | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nAs displayed in the above graph, the CryptoQuant on-chain PnL index has sharply risen out of the historical bottom zone recently. The chart also includes the curve for the 365-day moving average (MA) of the metric, and it\u2019s clear that the index has crossed above this MA with the latest surge.\n\nHistorically, such a crossover during bearish periods has signaled a transition toward an early bull market. If this pattern holds true this time as well, then the current breakout could be good news for the ongoing rally.\n\nHowever, back in 2015, an initial breakout like the current one did end up failing, and it was only later that a successful transition took place. Nonetheless, CryptoQuant notes \u201calthough it is still possible for the index to fall back below, the CryptoQuant PnL Index has issued a definitive buy signal for BTC.\u201d\n\nBTC Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $22,900, up 11% in the last week.\n\nBTC seems to be showing stale price action | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Hans Eiskonen on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, CryptoQuant.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin detractor and economist Peter Schiff has taken another swipe at the digital asset and MicroStrategy, a public company that is heavily invested in the digital asset. Schiff has always been vocal about his disdain for bitcoin and has now turned his attention to MicroStrategy and its former CEO, Michael Saylor.\n\nWhy MicroStrategy Bought Bitcoin\n\nIn a tweet, Peter Schiff revealed to his more than 890,000 Twitter followers what he says was the real reason behind Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy\u2019s move to begin investing in bitcoin. According to Schiff, former CEO Michael Saylor had admitted that buying BTC was actually a last-ditch effort to save the company from being liquidated. He further dissed the company saying that it has nothing going for it other than a leveraged speculative position on the digital asset.\n\nFor the first time I heard @saylor admit that adding #Bitcoin to the @MicroStrategy balance sheet was basically a Hail Mary to avoid liquidating the company. If the only thing $MSTR has going for it is a leveraged speculative position in Bitcoin, than it has nothing going for it. \u2014 Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 20, 2022\n\nAs expected, Schiff\u2019s strikes toward bitcoin were met with pushback from supporters. One user took to the comment section to defend MicroStrategy\u2019s decision as one that was taken so it could acquire the \u201cscarcest and most desirable asset the world has ever seen.\u201d However, Schiff would denounce this saying that bitcoin was in no way scarce nor was it desirable. He also added that bitcoin was a way to lose money.\n\nSchiff continues to advocate for gold as a better option for investors. Bitcoin maximalist Dan Held hit back at the economist saying, \u201c[Gold] is hardly scare and in no way desirable. If you want to lose your money there are plenty of ways to do it. You don\u2019t need to buy [Gold].\u201d\n\nBTC touches above $16,800 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nSo Why Did Saylor Buy BTC?\n\nMichael Saylor is arguably one of the most vocal bitcoin bulls. The ex-CEO of MicroStrategy has previously stated that his decision to purchase bitcoin was that he believed that the digital asset is the future of finance. Additionally, Saylor previously revealed that he had personally owned BTC before MicroStrategy had begun purchasing the cryptocurrency, his own personal holdings serving as evidence for the profitability of the asset.\n\nAs the company expects the price of bitcoin to appreciate over time, it believes that it will serve as an effective inflation hedge over the long term. Saylor himself has referred to BTC as \u201cdigital gold, saying \u201cWe find the global acceptance, brand recognition, ecosystem vitality, network dominance, architectural resilience, technical utility, and community ethos of Bitcoin to be persuasive evidence of its superiority as an asset class for those seeking a long-term store of value.\u201d\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s decision to invest in bitcoin also helped boost the popularity of the company, going from a company operating in the background to one of the most popular names among cryptocurrency enthusiasts.\n\nMicroStrategy is currently the public company with the largest BTC holdings in the world. The company held 130,000 BTC as of Sep. 30, 2022, worth over $2.1 billion at current market prices. At a cumulative entry value of almost $4 billion, the company is recording more than $1.7 billion in unrealized losses following the market downturn.\n\nFeatured image from Blockchain Reporter, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Bitcoin Exchange Inflows Fall To 2020 Levels As Activity Remains Low - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Data shows the Bitcoin exchange inflows and outflows have both shrunk recently as market activity has remained low.\n\nBitcoin Exchange Inflows & Outflows Continue To Decline\n\nAs per the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the BTC inflow volumes are now only around $350-$400 million per day. The \u201cexchange inflow\u201d is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin currently being deposited to centralized exchanges by holders. Its counterpart metric is the \u201cexchange outflow,\u201d and it naturally tracks the volume leaving exchange wallets.\n\nGenerally, during periods of high activity in the market, both these indicators rise to high values as a large number of investors make their respective moves. However, the price may react in particular directions depending on which of these metrics is higher at the moment.\n\nSince one of the main reasons why investors use exchanges is for selling purposes, inflows outweighing outflows could be bearish for Bitcoin. On the other hand, outflows being more dominant can suggest there may instead be buying pressure in the market as investors are withdrawing their coins for accumulation.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange inflows and outflows over the last few years:\n\nlooks like both these metrics have declined in recent weeks | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 2, 2023\n\nAs shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin exchange inflows and outflows were both at high levels during the past couple of years, with their volumes remaining in the range of multi-billion dollars throughout. At the peak of inflows back in May 2021, between $2.8 billion to $3.5 billion per day was entering exchange wallets.\n\nRecently, however, both the inflows and the outflows have significantly declined. Currently, the inflow volumes are between $350 million to $400 million per day, which are lows not seen since 2020. The outflows haven\u2019t quite shrunk to these levels yet, possibly because of the fact that the collapse of FTX lead to renewed interest in self-custody among investors, which made them withdraw large amounts from centralized platforms.\n\nIn the chart, data for the Ethereum exchange flows are also displayed. It seems like before May 2021, the Bitcoin exchange flow dominance was about 70%, which means the combined volumes of Ethereum inflows and outflows made up for 30% of the total between ETH and BTC during the period.\n\nBut since May 2021, the share of the Ethereum flows has significantly increased as ETH inflows and outflows dominance is now 42%. This trend suggests that the relative trading interest in ETH has gone up in the last one and a half years, while BTC has lost some mindshare.\n\nThough, in pure numbers, both cryptocurrencies have seen very little market activity recently as both their exchange inflows and outflows are at pretty low values.\n\nBTC Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $17,200, up 3% in the last week.\n\nThe value of the asset seems to have surged in the last couple of days | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Glassnode.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "As digital assets continue to grow in popularity worldwide, many investors are looking for ways to stay ahead of the game. If Cryptocurrencies can continue to build on their already strong foundation, there\u2019s no telling how much their prices could go up. For that reason, it\u2019s essential to stay well informed and learn all about the predictions of these two cryptocurrencies for the year that has just commenced.\n\nFor those who are looking to get in on the action early, there are a few things to do. The first is to learn about the predictions of these two currencies and then read about what steps to take to start investing in Crypto. You can do that by checking out this article with predictions for Ethereum and Bitcoin prices in 2023 and a guide on how to invest in them.\n\nOur predictions for Bitcoin\n\nCryptocurrencies have doubtlessly been on the rise for years now. Bitcoin, in particular, has seen tremendous growth, with its value increasing tenfold since 2017. This trend is expected to continue in the coming years, and many experts have made bitcoin price predictions 2023 that are staggering.\n\nSome believe that bitcoin could reach as high as $1 million per coin by the end of 2023, while others believe it will settle around $100,000. Those who get in early stand to make the most profit, so it\u2019s important to do your research and make an informed decision about whether or not to invest.\n\nOur predictions for Ethereum\n\nThe year 2023 might see Ethereum prices reach new highs. ETH could be worth $10,000 by the end of this year. While this may seem like a stretch, it\u2019s important to remember that the price of Bitcoin reached nearly $20,000 very fast.\n\nThe growth of the DeFi sector, increasing institutional adoption, and the launch of ETH 2.0 could all contribute to pushing Ethereum prices higher in 2023, which is why the Ethereum price prediction is high.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to get involved and want to invest in Ethereum, there are a few actions you can take. Naturally, you should first make sure you carry out your research before investing in it. After that, look into buying ETH on a reputable exchange like Coinbase or Kraken. And for your final step, consider storing your ETH in a secure wallet like Ledger or Trezor. By keeping an eye on Ethereum price predictions for 2023, you could make more informed decisions for investing in ETH.\n\nSteps to take for your first Crypto investment\n\nAs you could have concluded by now, Bitcoin and Ethereum are two of the most popular cryptocurrencies, and their prices have certainly caught plenty of attention. If you\u2019re thinking about investing in crypto, here are some factors to consider.\n\nThe basics\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand how cryptocurrency works. Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that uses cryptography to secure its transactions. Bitcoin, for example, is based on a decentralized network of computers that keep track of all bitcoin transactions. Ethereum is similar but also allows users to create contracts and programs within the Ethereum network.\n\nResearch\n\nYou need to decide which currency you want to invest in. There are numerous different cryptocurrencies available, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Make sure to research each one to find the one that suits your needs best.\n\nAccount setting\n\nYou need to open an account with a reputable exchange where you can buy and sell cryptocurrency. Coinbase is a popular option for those looking to invest in Bitcoin or Ethereum. Once you\u2019ve set up your account, you\u2019ll be able to buy and sell currency pairs like BTC/USD or ETH/USD.\n\nCaution\n\nLast but not least, it\u2019s vital to remember that cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile. This means that they can fluctuate rapidly in value, so it\u2019s important to monitor the market closely before making any trades. You should also have a clear exit strategy planned out before buying or selling any Crypto.\n\nThere are plenty of expectations in the crypto market in store for 2023 and the future of Ethereum and Bitcoin looks very bright. However, you will need to carry out your research and be cautious, while continually reading news about the price changes of Cryptocurrencies you want to invest in.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Bitcoin Poised To Resume Its Inclination To Outperform, Says Bloomberg Senior Analyst - NewsBTC",
        "content": "After the Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced a surprising turnaround in its monetary policy today, the Bitcoin price managed to rise near the important resistance level of $16,900. The BOJ announced that it will drastically widen its yield curve control band to 0.50%. At the same time, it announced that it will significantly increase the number of government bonds it will buy each month.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg senior commodities analyst Mike McGlone, this trend could continue. McGlone shared his insights via Twitter and said that a \u201cwarm spell\u201d is ahead for Bitcoin.\n\nAs the analyst notes, BTC has taken a beating as a risk asset in 2022 with most other cryptocurrencies, but \u201cappears poised to resume its inclination to outperform.\u201d This will happen when the U.S. Federal Reserve eases monetary policy and completes its pivot.\n\nBitcoin Is Set To Outperform When\u2026\n\nAccording to the chart from a Bloomberg Intelligence report, the levels that BTC and the Nasdaq 100 stock index have been resisting have now turned into support.\n\nAccording to the analysis, the BTC price soared in 2020 and 2021 due to unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus, allowing it to outperform the stock index. McGlone further elaborated:\n\nAt a Bitcoin/ Nasdaq ratio of 1.5x on Dec. 16, what\u2019s been consistent for most of the benchmark crypto\u2019s history is its declining relative risk vs. the stock index. At 2x, Bitcoin\u2019s annual volatility at the end of 2022 compares with 4x at the end of 2021.\n\nIn the coming year of 2023, McGlone expects that it will be a matter of how much lower global economies fall. Investors should by no means underestimate BTC then, as the risk/reward ratio is in favor of the leading cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cRisk vs. reward appears to argue against under-allocating or estimating the propensity for Bitcoin to continue its trajectory toward becoming digital collateral,\u201d McGlone claimed.\n\nIn other words, the Bloomberg analyst predicts that as soon as the U.S. Federal Reserve fires up its money printer again, cuts interest rates and returns to monetary easing, Bitcoin will \u201coutperform\u201d the rest of the market again.\n\nIn another tweet, McGlone predicted that the leading cryptocurrency will outperform the Tesla stock. \u201cThe near-certain decline in Bitcoin supply compared to the rising number of Tesla shares outstanding favors cryptocurrency outperformance when the rules of economics apply,\u201d McGlone said.\n\nBTC Price At Crucial Level\n\nMeanwhile, the BTC price needs to crack the extremely crucial $16,900 level in the short term and could then have a strong continuation. If so, investors should then keep an eye on the next vital resistance in the $17,350 area.\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash, Chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The Bitcoin price is finally seeing some profits, but it seems weak compared to other crypto assets. The macroeconomic environment is waking up, shaking things across all asset classes.\n\nAs of this writing, the Bitcoin price trades at $16,800 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. In the crypto top 10, BTC is lagging behind Ethereum, Binance Coin, and Cardano. These cryptocurrencies are positively reacting to the start of 2023.\n\nBitcoin Price Aims For Higher Levels\n\nPer a recent report from the trading desk QCP Capital, institutions are returning to action and allocating capital in Gold and other assets. The precious metal has seen a 15% rally in the past 60 days and keeps trending upwards.\n\nThe trading desk believes institutions are allocating into \u201calternative assets\u201d or stores of value. The Bitcoin price is yet to benefit from this trend, but the crypto market is recording some profits. In particular, the non-fungible token space.\n\nThis sector is coming back to life after months of declining activity. Popular NFT collections experienced 2 to 3x profits in late 2022 and are likely to maintain the trend. QCP Capital noted Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s price action:\n\n(\u2026) in line with Gold and NFTs, BTC and ETH are playing catch up to some extent at the start of the year. Despite the mini rally, BTC is still trading in an extremely tight falling wedge \u2013 with 18k the key breakout level to the topside.\n\nIf the Bitcoin price can flip $18,000 and trend higher on the back of institutional allocation to alternative assets, the cryptocurrency could reclaim higher levels. The trading desk points to $28,000 as a critical level to watch.\n\nThis level is the neckline of the \u201cHead and Shoulders\u201d pattern formed by BTC in the past two years. In addition, $28,000 has confluence with the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level, meaning many players will keep an eye on it.\n\nWhat Could Operate As An Obstacle For Bitcoin\n\nIn the short term, the Bitcoin price is seeing resistance at its current levels. Analyst Caleb Franzen claims that BTC is likely to continue seeing resistance around these prices and higher.\n\nIn 2022, the levels at $17,000 operated as critical support. Once lost, these levels turned into significant resistance, likely creating friction for the cryptocurrency. As the analyst pointed out, Bitcoin was already rejected from these levels in an attempt to rally beyond the $18,000 mark. Franzen said:\n\nBitcoin is decisively within a potential resistance range. Even if price manages to break above this diagonal resistance channel, we can\u2019t ignore overhead resistance from the former 2022 support range. We\u2019ve already been rejected there once\u2026\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin price made a 5% move today, poking above $19,000 momentarily. It is currently the largest daily climb of 2023 and since the FTX collapse.\n\nMore significantly, the sharp rally tagged a level that triggered a possible trend change according to the weekly Parabolic SAR. In the past, the technical indicator has lived up to its name. What could it mean this time?\n\nBitcoin Makes Biggest Move Of 2023\n\nThe start of 2023 has been positive for altcoins. But up until today, Bitcoin has been mild by comparison.\n\nFollowing today\u2019s CPI data release coming in at 6.5% and Biden\u2019s victory lap on inflation, Bitcoin price soared by $1,000, taking the top cryptocurrency above $19,000 briefly.\n\nMore importantly than what happened today, was what occurred on the weekly timeframe. BTCUSDT (Binance) weekly tagged the Parabolic SAR for the first time since May 2022. The LUNA collapse pulled Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies lower, beginning the second, more aggressive phase of the recent downtrend.\n\nThe same Parabolic SAR signal was also triggered prior to the 2019 crypto rally, and the 2020 to 2021 bull run (pictured below). Both rallies also blossomed from the same exact trend line previously.\n\nThe Parabolic SAR has produced profitable results | BTCUSDT on TradingView.com\n\nBTCUSDT Weekly Triggers Parabolic SAR Buy Signal\n\nThe Parabolic SAR is a technical indicator designed by J. Wells Wilder, Jr. and is used to detect changes in trend direction. The tool consists of a visual overlay of SAR dots that hover above or below price action, determining the direction of the trend.\n\nWhen the SAR dots are tagged, it suggests that a trend might \u201cstop and reverse\u201d \u2014 which is precisely what SAR stands for. Therefore, it\u2019s especially effective in timing entire and exits. Because the SAR dots travel higher or lower alongside the trend, they can be used reliably to set trailing stop losses.\n\nOn weekly timeframes, BTCUSDT (Binance) touched the Parabolic SAR, essentially telling short traders to get out of the position. If bears had used the PSAR for trailing stop losses, they\u2019ve now been stopped out \u2014 purposely \u2014 in profit.\n\nWhile the signal isn\u2019t a guarantee of continued upside, considering that the possible signal of a trend change has appeared alongside the coincidental timing of a long-term trend line touch, the recovery from this level could be more sustainable than many are ready for.\n\nFollow @TonySpilotroBTC on Twitter or join the TonyTradesBTC Telegram for exclusive daily market insights and technical analysis education.

        "content": "The bitcoin mining difficulty had adjusted upward for the majority of 2022, recording its highest correction in the same year. However, 2023 kicked off with a downtrend as the mining difficulty has begun to drop. A sharp drop in this metric recorded in the early hours of Tuesday could be the start of a trend reversal in this regard.\n\nBitcoin Mining Difficulty Plunges\n\nThe bitcoin mining difficulty declined suddenly on Tuesday morning during Asia hours. Data from CoinWarz shows that it had fallen almost 3.6% in a sharp downward correction. This took the mining difficulty from the 35.36T that it was trending at to 34.09T following the adjustment.\n\nThe bitcoin mining difficulty is important in the fact that it actually measures how much power is needed to verify transaction blocks on the network. The higher this figure is, the more demand it shows for the bitcoin network. And the lower it becomes, it means there are fewer miners on the network.\n\nOne factor that has had a profound effect on the mining difficulty in the last month was the blizzard that blew through the United States. As temperatures dropped dangerously low in some places, miners had to disconnect their machines to free up the energy grid. This was in a bid to leave enough energy for citizens to power their homes.\n\nBTC price at $16,700 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nImpact Of This On BTC\n\nThe bitcoin price is still stalling despite the sharp downward correction in the mining difficulty. The digital asset is still trending in the mid-$16,000s and has refused to budge. Even the return of some momentum with the new year has not been enough to trigger a movement beyond this point.\n\nSo when looking at the broader picture with the difficulty adjustment and price, it does not look like there would be any profound effect on price. Also, miners are still seeing similar profitability in their mining operations, so there is no tipping of the scale toward sell-offs or holding.\n\nAs long as the price continues to hold up above the $16,600 level, there should be no downtrend in price. Although if it does break below this support, then $16,000 is more likely than $17,000 in the short term. Also, add in the fact that there are multiple events such as the DCG and Gemini debacle unfolding over the next month, and it becomes imperative for the cryptocurrency to hold support.\n\nBitcoin was changing hands at a price of $16,700 at the time of this writing. It remains the largest cryptocurrency in the sector with a market cap of $322 billion.\n\nFeatured image from CoinDesk, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

These exchanges act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers, and they make money by charging fees on transactions.\n\nA good crypto exchange has a good reputation, high security, features an intuitive user interface, offers low fees and has high liquidity for your preferred crypto assets.\n\nFor example, Coinbase is a popular cryptocurrency exchange that supports bitcoin cash. You can buy, sell and store bitcoin cash on Coinbase, along with many other cryptocurrencies. Other reputable cryptocurrency exchanges include Binance, Kraken and OKX.\n\nTo buy bitcoin cash on a crypto exchange, you\u2019ll have to create an account, verify your identity and deposit funds. Once you have funds in your account, you can place an order to buy BCH.\n\nP2P Networks\n\nIt\u2019s also possible to buy cryptocurrency directly from other people on peer-to-peer exchanges. Some benefits of P2P networks include multiple payment options, no trading fees and greater flexibility in terms of legal restrictions.\n\nHowever, P2P trading can also be risky. There are plenty of scammers on these networks who take advantage of the lack of a central authority to govern transactions. In addition, there is often lower liquidity on P2P marketplaces so trades may take longer to complete.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\nCrypto ATMs\n\nCrypto ATMs are convenient options if you happen to have one in your area. They allow you to purchase bitcoin cash and other cryptocurrencies with cash, debit cards or credit cards.\n\nOne benefit to crypto ATMs is that they offer a high degree of anonymity, especially for users who buy with cash. However, they typically have much higher fees than online exchanges. In addition, they may not offer access to as many cryptocurrencies as online exchanges.\n\nIs Bitcoin Cash Safe To Buy?\n\nAs with any investment, buying bitcoin cash involves risk. As shown by BCH\u2019s price history, it\u2019s a highly volatile asset that has experienced many sudden increases and decreases in price. BCH\u2019s value may follow events in the cryptocurrency market and the economy as a whole or be directly related to its own development as a digital asset.\n\nBefore deciding whether to buy bitcoin cash, it\u2019s essential that you do your research and fully understand the potential risks.\n\nIf you\u2019re comfortable with the risks involved and have done your due diligence, there are steps to ensure the safety of your investment. For example, purchasing bitcoin cash on a reputable cryptocurrency exchange or P2P network with strong security measures in place helps mitigate the risk of fraud or hacking.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to store your bitcoin cash in a secure wallet, such as a custodial wallet offered by a reliable crypto exchange or an offline hardware wallet. Research different options to protect yourself against potential theft.\n\nIs It Better To Buy Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash?\n\nWhen it comes to deciding whether to buy bitcoin or bitcoin cash, there\u2019s no right answer as it ultimately will depend on your investment strategy and financial goals.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\nBoth bitcoin and BCH have advantages and disadvantages, so you should do your research and consider factors such as transaction speed, fees and overall market performance before making a decision.\n\nOn one hand, bitcoin is the more widely recognized cryptocurrency and has a much larger market capitalization and mainstream adoption than bitcoin cash. With a current market cap of over $400 billion, it\u2019s the world\u2019s most valuable cryptocurrency and may have greater potential for preserving its long-term value.\n\nOn the other hand, bitcoin cash has some technical advantages over bitcoin, such as faster transaction times and lower fees. So if your goal is to use cryptocurrency as a secure digital payment method rather than a long-term investment, bitcoin cash may be a better option.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nBitcoin cash is an established cryptocurrency that shares many of the same characteristics as bitcoin, with some notable improvements to its technical capabilities. If you\u2019re interested in buying bitcoin cash for the first time, make sure you know how to securely conduct transactions and store your crypto assets.\n\nBy taking these precautions and staying informed about the cryptocurrency market, you can make an informed decision about whether buying bitcoin cash is a safe investment for you.\n\nInformation is accurate as of March 7, 2023."

        "title": "Exploring the Relationship Between NFTs and Bitcoin Valuation - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The relationship between NFTs and Bitcoin is explained in detail. Bitcoin NFTs future depends on how the NFT market as a whole.\n\nThe growth of an NFT-like initiative on the Bitcoin blockchain during the past month suggests that the largest cryptocurrency may be about to enter a new phase. However, according to analysts, it needs to increase its accessibility and security to be the biggest. More than 260,000 of them have been developed so far. The latest non-fungible tokens (NFTs) from Bitcoin, known as Ordinals, continue to stir up a lot of excitement, hype, and speculative activity. How much of an effect will they have on the price of Bitcoin though? Let see explore the relationship between NFT and Bitcoin\n\nAccording to one viewpoint, Ordinals might be the key to revealing hidden Bitcoin valuation. Nevertheless, from another viewpoint, Ordinals might significantly detract from Bitcoin\u2019s primary goal of developing into a new type of digital currency. In the worst case, Ordinals might deter institutional investors from investing in Bitcoin and entice unwanted regulatory inspection. In other words, there could be money to be earned here, which will encourage more businesspeople and inventors to grow the market for Bitcoin NFTs. Some estimates place the current year value of the NFT market at close to $20 billion, with Ethereum now accounting for the lion\u2019s share of that sum.\n\nIn comparison to other markets where Bitcoin is making an impact, the NFT market\u2019s current size is tiny. The worldwide remittances business, where Bitcoin is becoming more and more significant, is still one-sixth the size of the NFT market, even if you take the optimistic view of things and estimate the NFT sector is worth $20 billion.\n\nIt is assessed in trillions of dollars, not billions, how valuable other markets are than those where Bitcoin is gaining market share. For instance, some investors consider Bitcoin to be a type of \u201cstore of wealth.\u201d Also, the physical gold reserves around the world are worth about $12 trillion.\n\nHow would NFT and Crypto Integrate?\n\nThe planned Web3 would include both NFTs and cryptocurrencies, which are important components of the metaverse. Users cannot trade one NFT for another, unlike bitcoin. However, consumers who interact with one might also utilize the other.\n\nA user needs a cryptocurrency wallet that is typically used for cryptocurrencies to buy non-fungible tokens. Platforms also save NFT keys here as evidence that they are the rightful proprietors of an NFT collection. Users keep their cryptocurrency wallets secure and secret, just like an offline wallet. Even though many NFTs can only be bought using cryptocurrencies, there are frequently possibilities for people who want to use their local money and credit cards.\n\nThe Risk Associated Association of NFT and Crypto\n\nWorking with NFTs and cryptocurrencies carries some risks, much like trading stocks or making investments.\n\nDue to various sponsorships, influencers may recommend non-fungible tokens, alternative coins, or other cryptocurrencies to their followers. As a result, young people may lose their own money if they don\u2019t understand the source of the influencer\u2019s income.\n\nIndividuals might encounter information from influencers pushing cryptocurrency or selling NFTs on social media that highlights the potential for investments to rise, but they might not comprehend the reasons for this. For instance, the influencer can be promoting a course which is how they primarily generate income. Or perhaps they have a sponsorship and a platform to advertise. In that regard, they don\u2019t profit significantly from NFTs or cryptocurrencies.\n\nHigh-risk investments include NFTs and, particularly, cryptocurrencies. The purchase and sell rates change often, just like the stock market. This implies that a young person who invests a lot of money in cryptocurrency risks losing all or the majority of it.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Plenty of people think that Blockchain and Bitcoin are the same things as they are closely related.\n\nDid you even know that Bitcoin and blockchain are two different concepts? You\u2019re not alone if you\u2019ve been using the phrases interchangeably; many others do the same thing, possibly as a result of the strong connection between blockchain and bitcoin.\n\nThis article is for you if you\u2019ve ever scratched your head trying to figure out what on earth the difference between the two is:\n\nBlockchain\n\nEvery block in Blockchain includes transaction data, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash of the block before it. In other words, bitcoin is constrained by blockchain, a distributed database technology, and any digital asset. It makes it possible for several parties to do business, exchange important data, and combine their resources in a safe yet impenetrable way. The blockchain\u2019s data is decentralized since it is spread across several computers. Blockchains are very safe since there is no single point of attack due to their decentralized structure.\n\nBitcoin\n\nThe network of computers joined together to handle Bitcoin payment transactions between Bitcoin accounts is known as the Bitcoin Network. These computers, known as miners, are owned by individuals and businesses all around the world.\n\nBitcoin Network security is top-notch. The system has been expressly created and built to make it impossible to create counterfeit Bitcoin or fraudulent transactions, therefore \u201cDouble Spending\u201d is not a possibility.\n\nOne of the first cryptocurrencies to leverage blockchain technology to enable peer-to-peer transactions is Bitcoin. Bitcoin provides a comparably cheap transaction charge compared to well-known payment gateways thanks to its decentralized network.\n\nKey Difference Between Blockchain and Bitcoin\n\nThe key differences between a Bitcoin and a Blockchain are studied and summarised below:\n\nThe main difference between Bitcoin and Blockchain is in how each technology is flexible or broad in application. The Blockchain\u2019s scope is significantly wider than that of Bitcoin, which is only concerned with enabling international monetary transactions. Money, property rights, and other kinds of assets can all be transferred via it.\n\nCryptocurrency is another name for digital money, like bitcoin. It was established in 2009 to circumvent governmental control of any nation\u2019s currency and simplify online transactions for users by getting rid of third-party middlemen used for payment processing.\n\nOn the other side, Blockchain technology is used to maintain the transaction record for Bitcoin. Via a peer-to-peer network, this method transmits and stores Bitcoin transaction data using a distributed ledger. The information in the ledger is open to everybody.\n\nBitcoin is a type of digital currency or crypto-currency used to send money across international borders. By eliminating intermediaries and the role of the governments of the sending and receiving nations in managing currencies, it offers the benefit of simplifying transactions. The technology behind bitcoins is called a blockchain. The ledger that records each Bitcoin transaction is kept up to date using Blockchain technology. Yet, nothing saved in the Blockchain can be changed or modified in the future by either a person or a piece of technology. Blockchain is one of the most open, usable, and secure technologies as a result.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is still in the grips of bearish headwinds that have seen it struggle to retain the $1 trillion threshold, and its representative digital asset, Bitcoin (BTC), is no exception. However, its historical movements have suggested this could be an opportunity to buy BTC before the price increases.\n\nTaking into consideration the previous significant ups and downs for Bitcoin, as well as the activities in between, the flagship digital asset has been demonstrating a steady pattern of ideal times for decision-making in crypto trading strategies \u2013 buy, hodl, and sell \u2013 as observed by the pseudonymous crypto analyst Stockmoney Lizards on March 7.\n\nIn line with these observations, the current bearish moment seems to be a good time to buy Bitcoin before its price begins another bullish movement upwards, at which point the better strategy would be to hodl and then sell when the price peaks, as indicated on the chart which ranges back to 2013.\n\nBitcoin historical patterns. Source: Stockmoney Lizards\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAs noted by crypto expert Ali Martinez, Bitcoin\u2019s current price was below a critical area of support between $23,050 and $23,730, where 1.63 million addresses purchased more than 910,000 BTC. According to him, if Bitcoin failed to regain this zone as support, it could trigger a sell-off that could push BTC down to $20,700 or even as low as $19,300.\n\nBitcoin in/out of money around price. Source: Ali Martinez\n\nAt press time, Bitcoin was changing hands at $22,406, representing a marginal decline of 0.05% over the last 24 hours, in addition to the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset losing 4.73% across the week and 4% over the previous 30 days, as the charts indicate.\n\nBitcoin 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nThat said, Bitcoin\u2019s further movements will depend on a range of factors, including directly related events such as the announced release of a Bitcoin debit card by Mastercard (NYSE: MA) and crypto exchange Bybit, as well as the sentiment in the wider crypto and macroeconomic landscape, which continues to await for the next major development that will influence the market\u2019s direction.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "For some time now, the value trend of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) has been very similar.\n\nFocus on the value trend of Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nSince November last year, the two trends have been proceeding almost in unison.\n\nAnalysis of Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nThe market value trend of Bitcoin (BTC) in recent days is rather flat and monotonous.\n\nIn fact, it has been doing nothing but lateralizing within a very compressed range between $22,200 and $22,500 now since Friday 3 March, with only a few brief excursions just above or just below.\n\nIt is as if after the sudden drop from $23,400 to $22,400 last Friday the price has stabilized.\n\nIn fact, that drop was only the latest in a series that began on 21 February, after failing for the fourth time to break the $25,000 mark.\n\nSomething similar had already happened in early February to Bitcoin, after it failed its fourth attempt to break above $24,000 on Thursday 2 March.\n\nThen between late January and early February it tried four times to move steadily above $24,000 without succeeding, at which point it began to fall, stopping eight days later around $21,600.\n\nThereafter, it later lateralized around that figure for four days, only to suddenly break down that wall and head straight for $25,000 on 15 February.\n\nAt that point, it seems to have begun a phase similar to the one that just ended, but at levels $1,000 higher.\n\nIn fact, it tried four times to break above $25,000, only to start falling on 21 February.\n\nThe descent lasted ten days, instead of the eight days of the previous medium-short-term cycle, and it has now been sideways in the very narrow range of $22,200 to $22,500 for four days.\n\nShould it manage to return above $24,000 within a couple of days, or even break through the $25,000 wall, the medium-short-term cycle would have replicated itself in almost the same way.\n\nIt is worth noting that $25,000 seems a much more difficult resistance to break through than $24,000.\n\nAnalysis of Ethereum (ETH)\n\nThe trend in the market value of Ethereum (ETH) has been very similar, although at different levels.\n\nIt was again on Friday 3 March that the price of ETH fell to $1,560, and since then it has continued to lateralize within a very compressed range between $1,560 and $1,580.\n\nThis trend seems identical to that of Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nPreviously, while Bitcoin tried unsuccessfully four times to move steadily above $25,000, Ethereum tried unsuccessfully to move above $1,700, although for three days, from 17 to 19 February included, it seemed to have succeeded.\n\nThe decline began on 21 February, at the same time as Bitcoin\u2019s.\n\nIn contrast, between late January and early February, when Bitcoin was trying four times to exceed $24,000, Ethereum\u2019s price had remained almost consistently above $1,600.\n\nFrom this difference it seems to emerge that at this stage Ethereum\u2019s price trend is influenced by Bitcoin\u2019s, and not vice versa.\n\nIt is worth noting that another difference concerns percentage movements.\n\nFor example, after the four failed attempts to get back above $24,000, BTC then lost 11% in eight days, while ETH lost 13% in five days.\n\nAnd after the failure of the fourth attempt to get above $25,000, BTC lost 11% again, while ETH lost 9%, this time both in ten days.\n\nThe comparison between Bitcoin and Ethereum: value trend, regulation and market\n\nThus what seems to be dragging the trend of Ethereum\u2019s market value during this period is the trend of Bitcoin\u2019s market value, with small differences that make it clear how the two trends actually move independently, but with the latter heavily influencing the former.\n\nExtending the comparison to the whole of 2023 shows that Bitcoin since late 2022 has gained 34%, while ETH has gained 30%. And extending it to November 2021, when all-time highs were touched, BTC loses 67% while ETH 68%.\n\nThus, there are more differences in this early 2023 in favor of Bitcoin than there have been since the highs were touched.\n\nSpecifically, in the past 30 days, Bitcoin\u2019s price has lost 3.5% while Ethereum\u2019s has lost 5%.\n\nIt is possible that this difference is affected by the words of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler recently, whereby he suggests that only Bitcoin is a commodity, while Ethereum, like other cryptocurrencies, should actually be considered securities."
