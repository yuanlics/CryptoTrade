        "title": "A tokenized version of Bitcoin is launching on Solana. Here\u2019s what you need to know - Fortune",
        "content": "Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency on the planet, and as such it has become central to the industry, which spans many blockchains.\n\nBut Bitcoin as a transactable asset has its limits. Although it hosts the most valuable coin, the Bitcoin blockchain is slow to adopt new features, and executing smaller transactions is slow and often costly.\n\nTo solve these drawbacks and allow investors on different blockchains to use and leverage Bitcoin, the Threshold Network, backed by Threshold DAO, created the first \u201ctokenized\u201d version of Bitcoin, tBTC, which launched Tuesday on the Solana blockchain.\n\nBut what is a tokenized version of a cryptocurrency, and what are the advantages of tBTC that give it the potential to level up DeFi on Solana? Matt Luongo and Maclane Wilkison, two key architects of the tBTC protocol, are here to explain.\n\nWhat is tokenized crypto?\n\nYou can put native Bitcoin in a hardware wallet or in a software wallet, or send it to someone, Luongo told Fortune, but it\u2019s limited in how it can be used by smart contracts, even with the Lightning Network, a layer-2 protocol built on top of the Bitcoin network to expedite smaller transactions.\n\nWhen someone mints tBTC on Solana, they send Bitcoin to be \u201cwrapped,\u201d which involves a process of decentralized review. The crypto is held in custody in a wallet that is validated by 51 of 100 people operating \u201cnodes\u201d on the Threshold Network that review and agree the crypto you\u2019ve sent is correct and authentic.\n\nYou can then mint the same number of Bitcoin that you wrapped, but in tBTC, which can be used on the Solana blockchain. The tBTC, therefore, serves as a receipt that allows you to prove you have a certain number of Bitcoin. If you want your Bitcoin back, simply trade for it with tBTC. After 51 of 100 validators sign off, you can claim your original Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a single party going bankrupt and you can\u2019t get your money, or a single party walking off\u201451 people have to have tried to actively be malicious to prevent you from getting your money back when you want it,\u201d Luongo explained.\n\nWhy is this useful?\n\nThe original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, remains the hardest to use, added Luongo, also CEO of Thesis, the venture studio behind the Threshold Network.\n\n\u201cBitcoin by itself is not that useful\u2014Lightning has been limited,\u201d Luongo said. \u201cTools like Solana, and like some of these other layer-2s in the ecosystem, are alternatives to Lightning. They\u2019re alternatives to scaling Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nIf you want to take out a loan against your Bitcoin, you often have to turn to centralized lenders, like BlockFi, which filed for bankruptcy in November. This puts your crypto at risk. With tBTC, investors can take out loans against Bitcoin on the Solana blockchain while avoiding the limitations of the Bitcoin Network and the risk of using a centralized loan platform.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s cool about tBTC is, we\u2019re saying okay, if you have Bitcoin, you can go to Solana and you can get USD loans,\u201d Luongo said. \u201cYou can start earning yield on your Bitcoin, and that\u2019s something that a lot of holders just have not had access to at all.\u201d\n\nWilkison, CEO of the crypto infrastructure company Nucypher, added that other uses range from loaning out Bitcoin to others to trading it on decentralized exchanges to using it as a liquidity token.\n\nDo other tokenized versions of BTC exist?\n\nThere are ways to tokenize Bitcoin that are more centralized. For instance, Wrapped Bitcoin, or wBTC, allows users to create a tokenized version of Bitcoin on the Ethereum network. Luongo pointed out that he believes wBTC is less safe than tBTC because it involves crypto being held by a single custodian instead of in a wallet controlled by a series of validators like with tBTC.\n\nApart from Solana, Threshold has launched tBTC on other blockchains\u2014Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon. The current supply of tBTC is about $29 million across all blockchains, according to Dune, compared with $4.2 billion of wBTC.\n\nSolana has been rebuilding its credibility after taking a hit last year because of associations with Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX and Alameda Research, which declared bankruptcy in November. But Luongo said he believes on-chain DeFi is making a comeback.\n\n\u201cI think tBTC is going to be the beginning of a renaissance for DeFi on Solana,\u201d he added.\n\nAlameda had been a big source of Bitcoin liquidity for the Solana blockchain, but tBTC may be able to help fill that gap, according to Wilkison, who added: \u201cOne important piece is bringing back Bitcoin to Solana, but another is bringing it back in a way that\u2019s not exposed to those types of centralized risks.\u201d"

It\u2019s at 12 percent this year, according to a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, and Bitcoin\u2019s price has risen more than 75 percent from its 2022 low.\n\nCrypto conviction \u2014 or just curiosity \u2014 is not something that merits condescension from the olds and scolds of personal finance. It just requires you to ask a few questions about who you are and why you find crypto alluring.\n\nIt is true that younger adults are more open to this way of putting money to work. If you\u2019re under 40, you\u2019re more likely to own crypto than people over 60, according to the N.B.E.R. research. You\u2019re also more likely to be male."

        "title": "Michael Saylor's Billion-Dollar Bitcoin Bet Has Rebounded - Nasdaq",
        "content": "By Landon Manning\n\nMichael Saylor, MicroStrategy\u2019s founder and executive chairman, has seen his bold bet on bitcoin vindicated as BTC\u2019s price has risen dramatically since his resignation as CEO.\n\nA longtime Bitcoin advocate, Saylor began publicly purchasing large amounts of bitcoin in 2020, devoting MicroStrategy\u2019s resources to several high-profile acquisitions that built up a reserve of nearly $2 billion worth by 2022. Although he began these purchases with the bitcoin price at around $10,000, the price had reached more than $30,000 by August 2022, roughly where the price sits at the time of this writing. Many of the firm\u2019s largest purchases were at the higher end of this premium, and Saylor resigned from his position as CEO that same month as MicroStrategy reported a $1 billion loss related to a bitcoin price slump.\n\nAfter Saylor\u2019s resignation, poor performance from bitcoin turned worse as the cryptocurrency exchange FTX cratered in spectacular fashion in November 2022. Through the rest of the year, the bitcoin price remained at around half of what it was when Saylor and MicroStrategy made many of its purchases. However, rising from these lows, the cryptocurrency rose dramatically and consistently throughout 2023 until seeming to generally recover from this valley.\n\nOne year on from his departure from leading MicroStrategy, it seems that Saylor\u2019s persistence is bearing fruit. Although he resigned from his position as CEO, responsible for day-to-day management and operations of his company, he did retain a role as executive chairman of its board, leading the company\u2019s shareholders and representing the firm publicly. With a focus on continuing the firm\u2019s bitcoin strategy, Saylor continued buying thousands of bitcoin at reduced prices, and his commitment seems to be paying off.\n\nIn a recent tweet, Saylor noted MicroStrategy\u2019s 254% increase in stock price since the beginning of his strategy, comparing it to the stock prices of firms like Google and Apple, which rose 78% and 74%, respectively. The decision to publicly tie MicroStrategy\u2019s fortune to bitcoin has, at least for now, led to gains unrelated to the firm\u2019s core products and offerings. This month, the company revealed a plan to sell $750 million of its stock, ostensibly to make further large purchases of bitcoin, and its value rose when the news broke.\n\nSaylor\u2019s work with Bitcoin has gone beyond this high-profile advocacy, as he has taken to development work on the Lightning Network in the past year as well. More than anything, these displays of conviction have shown that his commitment to Bitcoin\u2019s economic vision are genuine, rather than based merely on the dollar price at any given time.\n\nThis decision to wholeheartedly back Bitcoin has seemingly turned into a durable business strategy, capable of weathering and surmounting significant tempests in the global economy.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

As reported by Blockworks, Fidelity Digital Assets will handle the custodial elements of the BCOIN ETF.\n\nRelated: Grayscale Bitcoin ETF decision could happen this week, pundits say\n\nThe asset management firm also highlighted the environment and socially friendly nature of the fund, having added a renewable energy certificate (REC) to the ETF.\n\nThe fund taps into external data to measure the energy usage of the Bitcoin network and buys and retires the RECs.

        "title": "Big Questions: Did the NSA create Bitcoin? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Over the 15 years since Bitcoin was created, there has been no shortage of crazy conspiracy theories about how it was made and where it came from.\n\nSome believe Bitcoin was the work of \u201ca bunch of engineers\u201d in the Chinese Communist Party \u2014 presumably for world domination; others claim Bitcoin is the work of benevolent aliens to help humans evolve.\n\n\n\nBut one theory with circumstantial evidence supporting it has persisted over the years \u2014 and it involves one of America\u2019s most secretive intelligence-gathering agencies.\n\nThere\u2019s a small sect of Bitcoiners that believes Satoshi Nakamoto \u2014 the creator of Bitcoin \u2014 is, in fact, the United States National Security Agency in disguise.\n\n\n\nMany more, of course, think the idea is ridiculous and point out there\u2019s no absolutely no solid evidence to support it.\n\nBut where does the theory stem from? Well, one only needs to look into Bitcoin\u2019s source code.\n\nIt\u2019s in the code\n\nWhat makes Bitcoin so secure lies in its use of Secure Hash Algorithm 256, or SHA-256 (read as sha), which is used for everything from deriving transaction IDs and block hashes to addresses and Merkle trees.\n\nPut simply, it\u2019s a mathematical formula that garbles data into a string of seemingly random text, and it\u2019s why Bitcoin is basically impossible to crack.\n\nWell, it just so happens that this algorithm is the direct work of Glenn M. Lilly, a mathematician who, under the direction of the NSA, designed and eventually published the algorithm in 2001. Lilly later became the NSA\u2019s chief of mathematics research.\n\nThe NSA was also one of the first organizations to describe a Bitcoin-like system in a 1996 paper titled How To Make A Mint: The Cryptography Of Anonymous Electronic Cash.\n\nIn the paper, the authors proposed a system that uses public-key cryptography to allow users to make anonymous payments without revealing their identity.\n\nThe NSA\u2019s 1996 plan to create anonymous electronic cash. (archive.org)\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto is code for the CIA?\n\nOf course, some Bitcoiners don\u2019t think the NSA invented Bitcoin\u2026. they reckon it was the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nThe name of Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, can be interpreted as a reference to the U.S. spy agency. Nakamoto, loosely translated from Japanese, means \u201ccentral,\u201d while the name Satoshi means \u201cintelligent.\u201d\n\n\u201cSatoshi Nakamoto\u201d means \u201ccentral intelligence\u201d in Japanese. Really. Look it up. (Ancestry.com)\n\nSpeaking of Satoshi, their identity has never been uncovered, prompting some to believe they are likely to have had some form of intelligence training.\n\nIn an interview with Impact Theory\u2019s Tom Bilyeu in June, former Goldman Sachs executive and Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal revealed he\u2019s believed for years that Bitcoin could be the result of the NSA and the United Kingdom\u2019s government experimenting with potential ways to get out of future potential financial disasters.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence it came out in the financial crisis. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that the halving cycle and all of this is all related.\u201d\n\nFinally they're saying it\u2026but it's not Bitcoin and never was.(Remember guys like him are the same ones that have been shouting Bitcoin and Ethereum for years. Why is he just now admitting he's known this all along?) pic.twitter.com/4nFlUN45N6 \u2014 Digital Asset Investor.XRP (@digitalassetbuy) June 9, 2023\n\nSo, did the NSA create Bitcoin?\n\nJeff Man, a former NSA cryptanalyst, tells Magazine that it\u2019s \u201cfeasible\u201d that the NSA could have created Bitcoin as a means to gather intelligence about its enemies, but is doubtful.\n\nMan joined the NSA in 1986 at the tail end of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States. At the time, the NSA was hiring around 100 people a week to fill roles in critical skills, including engineering, mathematics and computer science, he says.\n\nOne of the NSA\u2019s main missions is to gather signals (or communications) intelligence necessary for the country\u2019s defense. This became an even higher priority following the September 11, 2001, terror attacks on the World Trade Center.\n\nPlumes of smoke billow from the World Trade Center towers. (Michael Foran, CC BY 2.0, Wikicommons)\n\nAsked about whether Bitcoin could have been created to gather intelligence about foreign agents and powers, Man said the agency certainly had the resources to do so.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a possibility. It\u2019s certainly feasible,\u201d says Man.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not outside of the realm of possibility that there would be a concerted effort to set up something like this.\u201d\n\nHowever, Man has strong doubts about it, based on his experience at the agency. He notes that one of the outcomes of the Watergate scandal in 1972 put a congressional spotlight on America\u2019s three-letter agencies, which were found spying on American citizens without proper warrants.\n\n#Spystuff! The NSA's headquarters, known as the \"Crypto City,\" spans an impressive 2.6 million square feet! It houses cutting-edge technology, top-notch analysts, and a vast intelligence library. Talk about a fortress of knowledge and innovation. pic.twitter.com/Sg2isODJXy \u2014 Robert Morton (@Robert4787) June 6, 2023\n\nMan believes, at least based on his years at the NSA, that the agency had since been very cautious not to breach its charter and that devising Bitcoin could be seen as spying on its own citizens.\n\n\u201cHistorically, in my experience, NSA takes very seriously its charter to only do what NSA does to foreigners, and not U.S. citizens.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it would be hard to prove or disprove perhaps who the targets were, or who were the potential targets. It would be hard to say definitively: \u2018We did not do any of this capability \u2014 we did not set it up and target any U.S. citizens.\u2019 That makes me doubt that it happened.\u201d\n\n\n\nMan, however, noted that he left the agency back in 1996 and conceded that the 2001 terror attacks and the subsequent Patriot Act may have changed this.\n\nThe Edward Snowden leaks in 2013 alleged the NSA had been gathering data on domestic internet communications without the proper warrants, an idea the U.S. government has denied.\n\nNo, the whole idea is silly\n\nOf course, most Bitcoiners completely dismiss the idea the NSA invented Bitcoin.\n\nWhile SHA-256 is used in Bitcoin, it also just happens to be one of the most widely used hash algorithms, making its presence in anything from digital signatures to password authentication.\n\nThe fact it was made public in 2001 means that everyone had access to it long before Bitcoin was invented. And no one has ever identified a secret backdoor into the SHA-256 algorithm or suggested a credible way it could be cracked.\n\nThey also patented SHA256 under a royalty-free license. \u2014 Alex Waltz (@raw_avocado) June 30, 2021\n\nSilicon Angle\u2019s Mellisa Tolentino addressed the notion that \u2018Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019 could be a veiled reference to \u201cCentral Intelligence\u201d, writing that the argument is \u201cnot very compelling.\u201d Satoshi Nakamoto is a fairly common Japanese name, and spy agencies don\u2019t tend to leave easter eggs calling attention to the fact they\u2019re involved.\n\n\n\n\u201cWould the NSA really have given the creator of its \u2018secret project\u2019 such an obvious name? If the NSA really is behind Bitcoin, naming it \u201cCentral Intelligence\u201d would not be a very intelligent move.\u201d\n\nOthers have argued that Bitcoin\u2019s first proof-of-concept software was more of a \u201cclever patchwork\u201d of old cryptography algorithms, which wouldn\u2019t be something an organized intelligence behemoth would come up with.\n\nAnd the idea that Nakamoto must have intelligence-training credentials, given that he has remained anonymous all these years also falls apart the closer you look at it.\n\n\u201cIt ignores the fact that thousands (if not millions) of people manage to remain anonymous online everyday,\u201d Ian DeMartino wrote in a Cointelegraph editorial.\n\n\u201cI have had internet friends that I talked to for years, on message boards and elsewhere, without ever meeting or talking on the phone. I suspect many reading this have had similar experiences. I don\u2019t suspect all of them are CIA agents.\u201d\n\nWill we ever find out if the NSA invented Bitcoin?\n\nIt seems unlikely we\u2019ll ever know for certain whether the NSA was involved in Bitcoin, at least not in our lifetime, says Man.\n\n\u201cYou will never get the answer to that definitively until it doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s this honeypot type of scenario, where it\u2019s a resource for information [\u2026] and it\u2019s still providing results and information, you\u2019re never going to get the definitive answer,\u201d he adds.\n\nEvery time someone non-ironically calls me a \"Spook,\" I remind them that #Bitcoin runs on NSA encryption and that \"Satoshi Nakamoto\" means \"central intelligence.\" The response is usually thishttps://t.co/0HPSh4v2KY pic.twitter.com/Kr2sHbm2gh \u2014 Jason Lowery (@JasonPLowery) April 30, 2023"

        "title": "KC has over 100 crypto ATMs, mostly in low-income neighborhoods - The Kansas City Beacon",
        "content": "Finance professor Jocelyn Evans first encountered a cryptocurrency ATM on the way to talk about financial education with students last fall.\n\nEvans stopped at a gas station on her way to Sumner Academy in Kansas City, Kansas. She came across the machine with the word \u201cBITCOIN\u201d on the screen. Store staffers weren\u2019t familiar with the machine, which didn\u2019t provide much explanation about how cryptocurrencies work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a low-income area with primarily Hispanic, African-American, people who are immigrants,\u201d said Evans, the Henry W. Bloch endowed chair of finance and an associate dean at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. \u201cI just wondered how much people know about cryptocurrency and, with a standalone machine, how much people knew when they made transactions with these machines.\u201d\n\nThe ATM that caught Evans\u2019 attention is one of more than 100 cryptocurrency kiosks installed in gas stations, liquor stores, smoke shops and elsewhere across the Kansas City area in the last few years.\n\nThe companies running the machines argue they\u2019re providing communities an alternative to traditional financial institutions that have historically given worse deals to poorer neighborhoods and communities of color.\n\nBut critics call the machines a targeted attempt to exploit financially vulnerable people with steep fees for a volatile product that\u2019s difficult to cash out from.\n\n\u201cThis is no different than people who target the Black community for payday loans or subprime loans,\u201d Evans said. \u201cThey\u2019re targeting people with the least financial knowledge and understanding of how you invest in cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nCrypto ATMs are more prevalent in areas with more Black residents, particularly along Troost Avenue in Kansas City\n\nSource: CoinATMRadar.com, U.S. Census \u2022 Graphic by: Dan Mika/The Beacon\n\nCrypto ATMs are more common in neighborhoods with more Hispanic residents, particularly in Kansas City, Kansas\n\nSource: CoinATMRadar.com, U.S. Census \u2022 Graphic by: Dan Mika/The Beacon\n\nCryptocurrency machines tend to be placed in and around neighborhoods with larger numbers of Black and Latino residents, and in areas with lower median household incomes, according to a Beacon analysis comparing ATM locations provided by CoinATMRadar against recent estimates from the U.S. Census.\n\nResearch from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. shows those populations are more likely to lack bank accounts \u2014 or to use nontraditional financial services like payday loans or title loan services that often carry steep fees.\n\nMore crypto ATMs are clustered in lower-income areas than in wealthier neighborhoods\n\nSource: CoinATMRadar.com, U.S. Census \u2022 Graphic by: Dan Mika/The Beacon\n\nCrypto ATMs promise access to the world of cryptocurrency to financially disadvantaged groups. However, they often charge fees far above industry standards and sometimes offer little explanation of the risks inherent in crypto. All of these ATMs will accept cash to buy crypto, but most aren\u2019t equipped to sell crypto and dispense cash.\n\nAlso, cryptocurrency accounts are not insured by the federal government, while the vast majority of bank accounts with less than $250,000 are. The machines also come with pricey surcharges. They often charge more than 10% per transaction and, in one case found by The Beacon, up to 40%.\n\nThe promise, rise and crash of crypto\n\nCryptocurrencies are meant to be a digital form of money. No specific entity like a bank or government controls how much of the currency is available or manages and tracks currency transfers between people.\n\nInstead, cryptocurrency ledger updates are pushed to a decentralized network of computers that acts as an ever-updating history of every transaction within that currency.\n\nSuch an arrangement can appeal to people who don\u2019t trust the financial system, since cryptocurrency wallets in theory don\u2019t require users to identify themselves. Some machines visited by The Beacon required a government ID to put in cash or transact, while others only required a phone number and name without any additional verification.\n\nAt least one crypto ATM provider has acknowledged placing machines near unbanked communities. In an interview with a crypto trade publication earlier this year, Bitcoin Depot CEO Brandon Mintz said his company views the unbanked as a primary customer segment. A 2021 survey from the Federal Reserve showed people who used cryptocurrencies for paying others were twice as likely to be unbanked than those who don\u2019t use crypto.\n\nBitcoin Depot did not respond to multiple requests from The Beacon for comment.\n\nBitcoin Depot\u2019s projections show how lucrative the crypto ATM business can be. The company, which recently went public, estimates revenues of between $700 million and $730 million this year, with nearly all of that coming from transaction fees.\n\nThe first crypto ATM in Kansas City launched in November 2016 at a currency exchange on Broadway Boulevard in midtown. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies, had a combined market capitalization of $12 billion at the time. A bitcoin cost around $700, while one ethereum costs $10.\n\nAt their peak, around the fall of 2021, Bitcoin and Ethereum combined were valued at the equivalent of nearly $1.8 trillion. Crypto ATMs followed the rise of the coins they sold. The number of ATMs operating in the U.S. rocketed from nearly 4,200 from the start of 2020 to more than 30,000 at the end of 2022.\n\nOnly 16 ATMs opened in the Kansas City region during 2018 and 2019. But as cryptocurrencies began to rise in the summer of 2020 amid broader financial speculation, ATM companies added 31 more in the region by the end of the year. Another 50 ATMs were installed in 2021 as pandemic anxieties began to wane.\n\nBut economic conditions soured in 2022, as decades-high inflation and fears of global recession created a drag on speculative assets that were flying high during the pandemic.\n\nIf the crypto market was an airliner, the end of low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve was like stalling out at 40,000 feet. Just more than a year off its highs, the combined value of Bitcoin and Ethereum sat at about $453 billion in late November 2022 \u2014 a decline of nearly 75%.\n\nYet 40 more ATMs started operating in Kansas City in 2022, while the crypto crash sapped hundreds of billions of dollars out of the ecosystem.\n\nGlobally, the crypto research firm Chainalysis estimates that the entirety of the crypto ATM ecosystem accepted deposits worth nearly $3.8 billion in 2021; that amount fell sharply in 2022 alongside the larger slump in crypto prices.\n\nSteep fees, little disclosure\n\nThe cost to buy crypto at stand-alone machines is often hidden or poorly advertised. The average buy rate among ATMs providing information to CoinATMRadar is 16%, and often a flat fee ranging from $1 to $5 is added to the transaction.\n\nA customer who purchased $20 of bitcoin would pay $3.20 in percentage fees, bringing the total fee to between $4.20 and $8.20 when buying crypto. The dollar equivalent of what remains after those fees is rarely the same day to day due to volatile price swings in crypto compared to government-backed currencies.\n\nCashing out is also expensive. Selling fees could take another 7% to 15% out of the withdrawal.\n\nAnd those transaction fees can run much higher, and be hidden in plain sight.\n\nA Beacon reporter visited a store in northeast Kansas City on July 19 to buy $20 worth of bitcoin, which was trading around $30,000 per coin throughout the day. While there was no flat fee, the machine issued the equivalent of $20 of bitcoin at the equivalent of bitcoin priced at approximately $45,000 \u2014 a difference of more than 40% over the market price. The price discrepancy was not disclosed.\n\nTransaction fees are far lower on fully online exchanges. The popular crypto exchange Coinbase doesn\u2019t charge fees for deposits and withdrawals of funds in a bank account to and from crypto. SoFi, another online financial brokerage, charges 1.25% per transaction.\n\nThe spread of crypto ATMs in the region coincides with a recent increase in unbanked Kansas Citians. An estimated 6.4% of Kansas City area residents were unbanked in 2021, according to FDIC estimates, an increase from 5.8% two years earlier.\n\nFDIC surveys show the most commonly cited reason Americans forgo bank accounts is because they cannot maintain the minimum balance required to avoid monthly fees, which are more likely to be charged to Black and Latino customers.\n\nDiscriminatory practices like \u201credlining,\u201d or denying bank loans and services to residents in communities with significant numbers of racial or ethnic minorities, were banned at the federal level in 1974.\n\nThe long-lasting effects of redlining and more modern disadvantages continue to pose a hurdle for low-income people and communities of color to build wealth.\n\nGeoff Jolley, executive director of the community nonprofit Local Initiatives Support Corp. of Greater Kansas City, said access to traditional financial services still lags in communities of color.\n\nThe lack of traditional lenders in those areas leaves alternative financial services providers to fill the gap, often with exorbitant fees and interest rates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised to see things like cryptocurrency ATMs, payday loans, title companies, that tend to be more exploitative, located in Hispanic or Black communities,\u201d Jolley said.\n\nCrypto ATMs also may not allow customers to convert their crypto into cash. Nearly one in five crypto ATMs in the Kansas City area do not offer cash withdrawals, according to CoinATMRadar data. These factors combined make it fairly easy to put cash into the world of cryptocurrencies, but far more difficult to withdraw if a user relies heavily on ATMs.\n\nEquitable crypto access?\n\nSeveral crypto ATM companies with locations in Kansas City did not respond to requests for comment for this story.\n\nOne company that did respond was RockItCoin. In an emailed statement, CEO Michael Dalesandro said five of the company\u2019s 18 ATMs in Kansas City take and dispense cash. He said machines that do both are more expensive to maintain, so they\u2019re deployed less often.\n\nDalesandro said RockItCoin\u2019s kiosks are placed in high-traffic areas. He said they do not target specific communities because ATMs aren\u2019t limited to only serving residents that live nearby. Customers search for ATMs and travel to conduct their transactions, he said.\n\nHe said RockItCoin\u2019s ATMs do not target specific communities and argued that crypto ATMs are the opposite of exploitative because they offer people without bank accounts or internet access to cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cWe are leveling the playing field, not creating barriers to entry or methods of exploitation,\u201d he said.\n\nDalesandro said RockItCoin\u2019s fees reflect the \u201cpremium service\u201d it provides along with the risks involved in buying cryptocurrencies and the costs of maintaining the machines and employing customer support and regulatory compliance staff.\n\nDalesandro said it would be \u201cunfair\u201d to compare RockItCoin\u2019s higher fees with centralized exchanges like CoinBase and SoFi. Those companies are much larger and have other revenue streams that may allow lower transaction fees to entice new customers, he argued.\n\n\u201cOne cannot criticize the mom-and-pop convenience store for charging $4 for a gallon of milk when Wal-Mart charges only $1.69 \u2014 they have different costs of production,\u201d Dalesandro said.\n\nMalfunctioning crypto ATMs\n\nA Beacon reporter visited several stores in Kansas City and asked employees how often they saw people using the machines. Some said they have never seen the machines used. Others said they see a small number each week.\n\nMany of the machines were not functioning, and store employees described difficulty reaching ATM providers for service. One worker in a store a few blocks east of Troost Avenue said his machine had been broken for three to four months before a repairman came. When a Beacon reporter tested that machine, the keypad was unresponsive.\n\nJared Girma, co-owner of Ethio Mart in Shawnee, signed a contract three years ago with the crypto ATM provider Coin Cloud to place a machine in his store. One of the company\u2019s selling points was the possibility of more foot traffic and more sales, he said.\n\nBut Girma said crypto customers would walk into his store, use the machine and immediately leave.\n\n\u201cNot many people used it (and) then shopped,\u201d he said.\n\nCoin Cloud filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February. Girma said the machine hasn\u2019t been working since. Girma also said he\u2019s only been paid $150 so far this year despite agreeing to a $200 per month rental fee.\n\nSomeone came to remove the machine from his store several weeks ago, but Girma refused to let Coin Cloud recover the ATM until his rent agreement is paid in full.\n\nIn an emailed response, Brett Axelrod, Coin Cloud\u2019s attorney, said several of Coin Cloud\u2019s ATM lease contracts were not purchased in the bankruptcy process and are effectively terminated. He said the bankruptcy court has allowed Coin Cloud to recover its machines if the party providing the lease space hadn\u2019t filed a dispute.\n\nRegulations and the future of crypto ATMs\n\nA recently introduced U.S. Senate bill would among other things require cryptocurrency ATMs to collect the same level of identity information as banks would for anti-money laundering purposes. Crypto supporters such as the Chamber of Digital Commerce, a crypto industry trade group, are calling that bill an excessive effort to regulate the industry.\n\nThe chamber declined to comment on the record about crypto ATM business practices when reached by The Beacon. The DeFi Education Fund, another trade group for crypto-related companies, would not comment on the bill or crypto ATMs in Kansas City.\n\nEvans, the UMKC finance professor, argues crypto ATMs should be banned in lieu of cheaper, more highly regulated online exchanges for people who want to use cryptocurrencies. She also said state governments need to widen access to financial education programs.\n\nMeanwhile, cryptocurrency ATMs remain plugged into stores across Kansas City, charging steep fees and presenting themselves as an alternative to a financial system that doesn\u2019t maintain the same presence in lower-income neighborhoods that it does elsewhere.\n\nLISC Executive Director Jolley lives in northeast Kansas City, an area that\u2019s relatively low-income and home to a relatively high number of immigrants. It has three crypto ATMs and just two bank branches between Independence Avenue and the Missouri River, according to a Beacon analysis of crypto ATM and FDIC location data.\n\n\u201cFinancial institutions have not done their part to ensure that there is equitable access to financial opportunity,\u201d Jolley said. \u201cIt has created a bit of a vacuum for payday loans (and) cryptocurrency, for other measures with the promise of wealth building being the attraction, but not necessarily the reality.\u201d\n\nThis story was supported by the Watchdog Writers Group, a non-profit journalism institute that produces in-depth reporting. It is based at the University of Missouri School of Journalism.\n\nHow we reported this story\n\nThe Beacon compiled its database of Kansas City-area cryptocurrency ATMs by manually downloading the HTML files for individual locations from CoinATMRadar.com. The site is frequently cited in financial and legal documents to describe the scope of the cryptocurrency ATM market.\n\n\n\nFrom those files, we extracted details such as store location, operator names, installation dates, cryptocurrencies offered and more into a single database and standardized dates, street names and latitude/longitude points. This data can then be overlaid over a street map of the Kansas City area.\n\n\n\nWe also overlaid bank branch locations in the region using data from the FDIC.\n\n\n\nIn a separate database, we downloaded data from the U.S. census\u2019 most recent five-year estimates from its American Community Survey. The data include estimates of Black and Latino residents, and people who identify as those races alone or in combination with other races. We also downloaded data on estimated foreign-born populations and median household income. We used \u201cblock groups,\u201d or the smallest geographic unit of measurement available for the five-year ACS.\n\n\n\nWe then narrowed the ATM locations and census data to focus only on Jackson, Clay, Platte, Johnson and Wyandotte counties. The resulting heatmaps for each variable were then merged with the crypto ATM location map to show proximity of kiosks to areas with higher numbers of Black and Latino people or lower median household incomes. The R notebook files used to clean, analyze and map ATM and Census data are available on GitHub.\n\n\n\nWhat are the limitations?\n\n\n\nIndividual ATMs are not tracked by regulators at the state or federal level. CoinATMRadar solicits location data from ATM providers, so its database may miss some locations that were not submitted to the site.\n\n\n\nThe census data used for these maps are five-year estimates ranging from 2017 to 2021. The pandemic may have had an impact on certain data sets, such as household incomes decreasing due to job loss, or potentially increasing due to stimulus payments, unemployment benefits and other income from government sources."

        "content": "A recent report by the research firm Delphi Digital illustrates the predictable consistency of price action and trends within the crypto market. The report delves into the interconnectedness between the four-year Bitcoin (BTC) cycle and broader economic trends.\n\nAccording to Delphi Digital analysts, the ongoing consolidation at $30,000 is similar to the period between 2015 and 2017, with indicators pointing toward an all-time high (ATH) for Bitcoin by the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nEconomic cycle's impact on Bitcoin's performance\n\nDelphi\u2019s analysis draws attention to the inherent cyclical nature of the cryptocurrency market. This cyclicality is demonstrated by the timing between peak-to-trough bottoms, recovery periods to previous cycle highs and the timing of price rallies to new cycle tops. Using Bitcoin as a benchmark, Delphi outlines the general blueprint of a cryptocurrency market cycle.\n\nBitcoin price in USD (log scale) reflecting four-year cycles. Source: Delphi Digital\n\nThese four-year cycles include Bitcoin hitting a new ATH, experiencing an approximate 80% drawdown, then a bottom around one year later. This tends to be followed by a two-year recovery to prior highs and, finally, a price rally for another year leading to a new all-time high.\n\nThe research reveals a fascinating correlation between Bitcoin price peaks and changes in the business cycle, as indicated by the ISM Manufacturing Index.\n\nBitcoin/USD year-over-year (orange) vs. U.S. ISM Manufacturing Index year-over-year (white). Source: Delphi Digital\n\nDuring Bitcoin\u2019s price peaks, the ISM often demonstrates signs of topping out, and active addresses, transaction volumes and fees reach their highest point. Conversely, as the business cycle signals recovery, so do network activity levels.\n\nThe report emphasizes the Bitcoin halving\u2019s role in these cycles. The last two halvings occurred about 18 months after BTC bottomed and roughly seven months before a new ATH. This historical pattern indicates a projected new ATH for Bitcoin by the fourth quarter of 2024, aligning with the expected timing of the next halving.\n\nBitcoin price action looks similar to the 2015-2017 pre-bull run phase\n\nThe report also suggests that the current market environment shares striking similarities with the period between 2015 and 2017. The alignment of market behavior, economic indicators and historical trends indicates that the current phase is akin to a time of increased risk exposure and potential growth, just as was experienced during that period.\n\nThe report notes that the market\u2019s trading patterns, especially in the S&P 500, closely resemble the trajectory observed during 2015-2017. Even during times of uncertainty, such as an earnings recession, these patterns persist, mirroring the sentiment of that period.\n\nThe consistent pattern of Bitcoin\u2019s cycle, its synchronization with broader economic shifts and the imminent halving in 2024 all contribute to this thesis.\n\nU.S. ISM Manufacturing Index, current (orange) vs. 2013-2019 cycle (white). Source: Delphi Digital\n\nDelphi highlights parallels between the bleak global growth outlook during 2015-2016 and the recent period of economic uncertainty in 2021-2022. Factors such as the strength of the U.S. dollar and changes in global liquidity cycles echo the past.\n\nThe report underscores how gold\u2019s performance around that time, influenced by currency debasement concerns, exhibits remarkable similarities to the present. These parallels bolster the argument that macroeconomic conditions are following a familiar trajectory.\n\nGold price in USD (log scale), current (orange) vs. 2015-2019 cycle (white). Source: Delphi Digital\n\nRelated: Is Bitcoin\u2019s record-low volatility and decline in short-term holders a bull market signal?\n\nThe crypto market reflects an optimistic outlook, with some red flags\n\nDelphi\u2019s analysis provides compelling evidence that the crypto market operates within cyclical patterns that mirror broader economic changes. The report\u2019s prediction of a new all-time high by the fourth quarter of 2024 aligns with historical halving patterns. This timing, coupled with the state of indicators like the ISM and expectations of renewed liquidity cycles, strengthens the argument for a cycle akin to the one seen in 2015-2017.\n\nThe upcoming Bitcoin halving in 2024 further adds credence to the firm's expectations of a possible bull market by the fourth quarter of that year. While the analysis is not without its risks and uncertainties, the overall outlook for the cryptocurrency market in the next 12-18 months appears promising, given the stacking catalysts and historical precedent.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "SEC delays set deadlines for Bitcoin ETF approval to early 2024 - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \u2014 the financial regulator with the final say over allowing a spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF) \u2014 may be moving closer to giving the investment vehicle the green light after several years of applications.\n\nIn June, the world\u2019s largest asset management firm, BlackRock, added its application to the bundle of Bitcoin (BTC) ETF filings currently being reviewed by the SEC, creating renewed interest among investors in and out of the crypto space. The company later added a \u201csurveillance-sharing agreement\u201d with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase following reports the SEC could be more open to accepting an ETF application under such conditions.\n\nBlackRock is one of many firms with crypto ETF applications in the SEC pipeline. ARK Invest, under CEO Cathie Wood, filed to list its ARK 21Shares spot Bitcoin ETF in May 2023 and received the most recent delay from the SEC on Aug. 11, pushing back the deadline another 21 days as the regulator opens the proposal to public comments.\n\nUnder SEC guidelines, the federal regulator has the authority to delay ETF applications for up to 240 days \u2014 by opening them to public comment or otherwise \u2014 from the first filing in the Federal Register. Even so, the SEC has never approved a spot Bitcoin ETF proposal from any firm in the United States and only started accepting investment vehicles tied to BTC futures in October 2021.\n\nOne of the challenges behind getting the SEC to allow a spot crypto ETF may be the nature of the investment vehicle. Bitcoin futures-linked ETFs also enable individuals and companies to invest in the crypto asset without an exchange, while a spot BTC ETF could involve holding Bitcoin within a fund for more direct investment.\n\nGemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss were the first to apply for a crypto exchange-traded product listing using their Bitcoin Trust in July 2013, when many regulators might not have even understood digital currencies and the SEC ultimately rejected the application.\n\nStuart Barton, co-founder and chief investment officer of Volatility Shares \u2014 the firm behind the listing of a leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF in June \u2014 told Cointelegraph its process of applying with the SEC involved back-and-forth negotiations. The regulator proposed changes to disclosure documents but was generally \u201ccooperative.\u201d He speculated that smaller firms might have more of an edge with the SEC on a spot crypto ETF offering.\n\n\u201cBig companies have been doing the same thing they\u2019ve been doing for years,\u201d said Barton. \u201cYeah, there are new applications, new filings\u2026 they haven\u2019t really moved the argument along.\u201d\n\nAt the time of publication, major asset management firms with spot Bitcoin ETF applications under review by the SEC include BlackRock, ARK Invest, Bitwise Asset Management, VanEck, WisdomTree, Invesco and Galaxy Digital, Fidelity and Valkyrie. With the maximum 240-day extension window available to the SEC, the final deadline for ARK\u2019s Bitcoin ETF is in January 2024, while approval or disapproval of all the other firms\u2019 offerings could come as late as March 2024.\n\nRelated: SEC decision on Bitcoin ETFs won\u2019t leave out Wall Street giants\n\nPart of the SEC\u2019s seeming reluctance to sign off on a spot crypto ETF could be from the nature of the crypto market in the United States, which, while regulated, has left many lawmakers and industry leaders calling for greater clarity and oversight. The SEC is currently pursuing enforcement cases against Coinbase, Binance and Ripple, and it has already levied financial penalties against firms such as Bittrex. Barton added:\n\n\u201cBoth sides are going to bend a little bit. I think the SEC are going to have to be a little bit more open-minded [...] There\u2019s going to be a lot more bending, I think, from the crypto side.\u201d\n\nU.S. lawmakers are currently considering legislation to better define the roles the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) should have in regulating digital assets. In addition, both the regulator and industry may have to consider court decisions until regulations are better defined, as a judge in the SEC vs. Ripple case largely ruled that XRP was not a security, creating ramifications for everyone dealing with crypto in the United States.\n\n\u201c[The ETF application process] puts the SEC in an incredibly powerful position,\u201d said Barton. \u201cGensler has a great amount of sway in that; the political makeup of the commission definitely influences that.\u201d\n\nMagazine: Crypto regulation: Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?\n\nAs of August, certain analysts have suggested that the chances of a spot Bitcoin ETF being approved in the U.S. are close to 65% based partly on BlackRock\u2019s application. Both Cathie Wood and Grayscale \u2014 the asset manager currently suing the SEC over its ETF application \u2014 have hinted that the regulator could approve multiple applications simultaneously to avoid any company having an advantage over another."

        "content": "The latest report from Glassnode Insights, titled \u201cThe Week On-Chain,\" emphasizes that Bitcoin has reached historically low levels of volatility. This has led to a mere 2.9% separation between the asset\u2019s Bollinger Bands, indicating an exceptionally narrow trading range.\n\nThis situation has only been observed twice in Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) history: in September 2016, when BTC traded near $604, and in January 2023, when the asset maintained a steady value of $16,800.\n\nAs outlined in the report, periods of reduced volatility, combined with investor fatigue, prompt the movement of coins based on their cost close to the current price. This implies that traders are likely making marginal profits or losses with their exits. The report concludes that establishing a new price range is necessary to stimulate fresh spending, potentially contributing to an anticipated increase in volatility.\n\nIs Bitcoin\u2019s low volatility a reflection of broader markets?\n\nThe constrained range within which Bitcoin has traded \u2014 specifically, $29,050 to $29,775 over the past three weeks \u2014 is atypical, and it does not require advanced mathematical analysis to understand. This has resulted in an exceptionally low annualized 30-day volatility of 17%. The key question is whether this trend is isolated to cryptocurrencies or if it's a phenomenon also observed in the traditional markets, including stocks, oil, bonds and currencies.\n\nS&P 500 (blue), WTI (green), DXY (orange), 10-year Treasury (purple) 30-day volatility. Source: TradingView\n\nNotice how the S&P 500 and the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price 30-day volatility are currently at their lowest levels since November 2021. Interestingly, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) didn't follow this trend, as the metric rose to 8% from 6% in May 2023. Additionally, the 10-year Treasury yield\u2019s 30-day volatility recently rose from its 18-month low of around 10% to the current 16%. These trends could have potentially influenced the decrease in Bitcoin\u2019s volatility.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, there\u2019s a significant concentration of short-term holders\u2019 price distribution between $25,000 and $31,000. This pattern is reminiscent of similar periods during past bear market recoveries. However, the data shows that many of these investors are still holding positions with losses, creating short-term selling pressure.\n\nEntity-adjusted unspent BTC realized price distribution. Source: Glassnode\n\nMoreover, the analytics firm highlights a noteworthy drop in short-term holder supply to a multiyear low of 2.56 million BTC. On the flip side, the supply held by long-term holders has reached an all-time high of 14.6 million BTC, as mentioned in the report.\n\nBitcoin long-term and short-term holder threshold. Source: Glassnode\n\nAssuming a relatively optimistic scenario where only 10% of the 1.77 million BTC held by long-term investors at $47,000 or higher change their positions before Bitcoin surpasses $40,000, this amounts to about six and a half months of the current mining output. This illustrates the importance of not disregarding the potential impact of a global economic recession on Bitcoin\u2019s price, beyond the fact that short-term holders are becoming scarce.\n\nThis hypothesis doesn\u2019t invalidate Glassnode\u2019s idea of increased positions by \u201clong-term conviction holders.\" Nevertheless, no historical data can account for the U.S. 10-year Treasury yields nearing their highest level in 16 years or the 30-year fixed average mortgage rate in the United States flirting with the 7% mark.\n\nDespite the current trend, long-term holders still could flip their sentiment and actions in the event of adverse economic conditions.\n\nHigher yields in equities could attract investors, leading to possible volatility, while rising government and corporate borrowing costs might strain budgets and profitability. Concurrently, real estate markets might slow due to the impact on mortgage affordability. Such circumstances would likely compel central banks to implement fiscal policies to support economic activity, often resulting in upward inflation pressure.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s ascension as a $50 billion asset class occurred merely six years ago, making it uncertain how holders will react to the stress faced by some traditional markets. This contradicts the historically low volatility in the S&P 500, oil and Bitcoin markets.\n\nThis raises the question: Could this tranquility be preceding a period of turmoil, and will Bitcoin serve as a hedge against escalating inflation? Only time will provide the answers.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "Is Crypto a Commodity? What It Means, Examples - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is a Crypto Commodity?\n\n\"Crypto commodity\" is the generally accepted term for a tradable and fungible token representing a commodity, utility, asset, or contract in the real or virtual world. The underlying asset's value is tokenized on a blockchain, and the asset is secured or held in reserve. Once created, the token is considered a crypto commodity. It can then be traded like any other cryptocurrency or commodity wherever it can legally be traded.\n\nThe term can also refer to legally regulated cryptocurrencies traded as commodities. Bitcoin, ether, and other cryptocurrencies are considered commodities by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nKey Takeaways A crypto commodity is a tradeable and fungible token representing an underlying asset.\n\nThe Commodity Futures Exchange Commission has defined cryptocurrency and related assets as commodities, thus claiming jurisdiction under specific use cases.\n\nThe framework for defining crypto commodities and other virtual assets remains gray because regulators, developers, traders, investors, and courts are battling over definitions and jurisdiction.\n\nThe History of Crypto Commodities\n\nA quick dive into the evolutionary history of cryptocurrency platforms is warranted to understand the concept of crypto commodities.\n\nAs the Bitcoin network evolved, it gained popularity for its ease of payment processing and decentralized nature. Technology stalwarts quickly realized that blockchain networks could be used for more than simple online payments. Bitcoin had a fiat currency value, which created interest in transferring other asset values to the blockchain. Asset ownership could be recorded on the chain, and tokens created to represent ownership of that asset.\n\nOnce this was realized, the world exploded with tokens. Digital art was tokenized on a blockchain and sold to collectors; virtual property in a persistent digital landscape was tokenized and sold; and the concept of tokenizing real estate and property emerged. Many other tokens were created and could be bought and sold on digital exchanges.\n\nAs long as there is demand from investors for crypto commodities, they are likely to continue being traded on commodity and crypto exchanges.\n\nNext came the idea that derivatives of the tokens could be created, much like stock and commodity derivatives. These are contracts that could be bought and sold by traders and investors, who are essentially betting on the price movements of the assets the contracts were linked to. The Commodity Future Trading Commission (CFTC) quickly stepped in and began regulating these tradeable assets.\n\nConcerns About Crypto Commodities\n\nAs of August 2023, virtual assets like cryptocurrency and crypto commodities do not have clearly defined legislation or regulatory guidelines. Due to existing regulations, authorities have claimed jurisdiction over specific blockchain-related tokens, assets, and investing and trading activities. However, there is still controversy regarding regulating decentralized assets such as crypto and if regulators have jurisdiction over them.\n\nBoth the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Cboe Options Exchange have cryptocurrency-derived products, which can be readily traded alongside more traditional commodities like gold and corn.\n\nHowever, in July 2023, the Southern District of New York district court issued a summary judgment against Ripple for violating securities laws when it sold cryptocurrency to institutional investors. But the company was judged to have not violated any securities laws when selling its coin on exchanges to individual investors. The effect this ruling will have on crypto commodities, which are basically cryptocurrencies, remains unclear.\n\nWhich Cryptos are Classified as Commodities? Some or all cryptos are commodities, depending on which regulatory authority you ask. The classification depends on the circumstances the cryptocurrency is issued under, how it is made available to investors, how it trades, and how investors and traders treat it.\n\nWhat Is the Difference Between a Commodity and a Cryptocurrency? Traditionally, a commodity is a raw physical good used in other goods and services. Cryptocurrency began as a virtual payment system. The line distinguishing between the two is blurring as cryptocurrency investing and trading products continue to emerge.\n\nWhat Commodities are Backed By Cryptocurrencies? There are no commodities backed by cryptocurrencies. However, there are commodity-backed stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies that are collateralized by reserves of physical goods. Examples are PAX-Gold (PAXG) and Tether Gold (XUAt).\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCryptocommodities are tokens that represent an underlying or secured commodity on a blockchain. They can also be cryptocurrencies, depending on specific regulatory authorities' definitions."

        "content": "Can Bitcoin help enhance the security of proof-of-stake blockchains? The team behind the Babylon network has published a new paper exploring that question.\n\nBabylon is built using the Cosmos software development kit (SDK) and was designed by a team of researchers from Stanford University. And as Blockworks has previously reported, the team isn\u2019t new to the idea of using Bitcoin in conjunction with the network.\n\nThe team released a paper earlier this year for a Bitcoin timestamping protocol for use by proof-of-stake networks. Yet according to David Tse, the founder of Babylon Chain and a Stanford University professor, the timestamping protocol has limitations. Namely, it\u2019s only useful for long-range security protection.\n\n\u201cThe timestamp takes a long time before it becomes secure on the Bitcoin chain, because Bitcoin is very slow,\u201d Tse said.\n\nThe latest paper explores the other end of the spectrum: utilizing Bitcoin for short-range security on such chains.\n\nHow it works\n\nA problem faced today by many layer-1 proof-of-stake blockchains (outside of Ethereum) is that the capital backing the chain is comparatively insignificant. According to Tse, most proof-of-stake chains rely on their native tokens to back their assets.\n\n\u201cThe idea we have is, is it possible to use a non-native asset to secure a chain?\u201d Tse said.\n\nThat\u2019s where Bitcoin comes in. Although using Bitcoin to secure a proof-of-stake chain may sound impossible \u2014 Bitcoin is a distinct, proof-of-work chain \u2014 Tse and his team have utilized simple staking logic to make this possible.\n\n\u201cStaking has similarities to lending. When you borrow money to me, you might be worried that I will run away with the money, so you demand collateral \u2014 for example my house \u2014 this means if I run away, you can take my house,\u201d Tse said.\n\nTo participate in network activities on a proof-of stake-chain, one must provide collateral. In the event a staker proves to be malicious, their stake is subsequently taken from them in a process known as slashing.\n\n\u201cThe challenge for our problem then, is how do we slash the Bitcoin asset,\u201d Tse said.\n\nBridging, in this case, wouldn\u2019t be an option, as Bitcoin bridging is often considered an insecure process, Tse said. Further, Bitcoin does not support smart contracts as far as its scripting language capability is concerned.\n\nWhat Babylon\u2019s latest paper proposes is using a particular cryptographic scheme so that once a validator does something wrong, their private key is automatically revealed.\n\n\u201cSlashing functionalities is achieved through a spending condition which is expressible in the Bitcoin scripting language,\u201d Tse said. \u201cThere is a type of signature called the extractable one-time signature \u2014 which means when you sign something once, it is secure, but when you use the same key to sign something twice, then automatically your key will be revealed.\u201d\n\nWithin Babylon\u2019s Bitcoin staking protocol, all slashable offenses then can be reduced to signing something twice \u2014 which will cause a private key to be revealed.\n\nIt\u2019s an approach that could prove compelling for participants \u2014 but one not devoid of risk.\n\nBob Summerwill, the executive director of the Ethereum Classic Cooperative, told Blockworks that Babylon\u2019s \u201csell\u201d is that stakers are getting yield on Bitcoin. \u201cBut that also means that you are putting it at risk,\u201d he added.\n\nLooking ahead, the Babylon team is soliciting feedback from the community. It plans to launch a mainnet early next year.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Each of the past three halvings have correlated with new record highs within 12 months.\n\nThe halving on its own could send bitcoin's price up sharply, but Lee said it wouldn't make a six-figure leap without the regulatory approval of the spot ETF in the US.\n\nSeparately, he noted that easing macro conditions and Fed policy creates a bullish setup for cryptocurrency across the board.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Crypto is dependent on monetary policy, so if inflation is cooling, then we can start to bet on forward financial conditions easing and central bank easing sooner,\" Lee said. \"That's bullish for crypto or alternative assets.\"\n\nAs far as traditional assets go, the Fundstrat chief reiterated his call for a new all-time high in the S&P 500 before the end of the year. Even if equities fall 5%-8% in August, there's still $5.5 trillion in cash on the sidelines waiting to enter the market, he said.\n\n\"I think you have an earnings recovery, the Fed may be slowing, interest rates could stabilize and then the cash gets put to work,\" Lee said."

        "title": "Monero (XME) Cryptocurrency: Definition, Mining, Vs. Bitcoin - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is Monero (XMR) Cryptocurrency?\n\nCryptocurrencies are increasing in popularity. These are virtual or digital currencies that are decentralized and can be used to trade or spend using blockchain technology. Many of them are aimed to enhance privacy and anonymity, and whether they achieve success is unpredictable. A few of these currencies allow public viewing of all transactions, while others make privacy optional. And still, others keep the privacy feature strictly implicit.\n\nWhen most of us think of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is usually the first one that comes to mind. It was one of the first of its kind, using peer-to-peer technology to allow users to make payments with their coins. But there's another currency that has achieved a high level of popularity and acceptance, mainly for its privacy-oriented features. This one is called Monero. This article explains the key concepts, features, and challenges of Monero.\n\nKey Takeaways Monero is an open-source, privacy-oriented cryptocurrency that was launched in 2014.\n\nIts blockchain is opaque, which makes transaction details and the amount of every transaction anonymous by disguising the addresses used by participants.\n\nInvestors can mine Monero using their own CPUs, which means they don't need to pay for special hardware.\n\nIts privacy features make Monero easy to use for illicit activities as well as for use on the dark web.\n\nUnderstanding Monero (XMR) Cryptocurrency\n\nMonero (XMR) is an open-source, privacy-oriented cryptocurrency that was launched in 2014. It is built and operates on the concept. These blockchains, which form the underlying technology behind digital currencies, are public ledgers of participants' activities that show all the transactions on the network.\n\nMonero's blockchain is intentionally configured to be opaque. It makes transaction details, like the identity of senders and recipients, and the amount of every transaction, anonymous by disguising the addresses used by participants.\n\nAlong with anonymity, the mining process for Monero is based on an egalitarian concept. This is the principle that all people are equal and deserve equal opportunities. Its developers did not keep any stake for themselves when they launched Monero but they did bank on contributions and community support to further develop the virtual currency.\n\nAs of Aug. 26, 2023, Monero was trading at $146.22 and had a market capitalization of $2.68 billion. That's a big difference from the closing price of $89.12 on Aug. 26, 2020. The market cap on that date was $1.58 billion.\n\nHow Is Monero Different from Bitcoin?\n\nAs mentioned above, Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency on the market. It works on a protocol that attempts to shield the participant's identity using pseudo name addresses. These pseudo names are randomly generated combinations of alphabets and numbers.\n\nBut this approach offers limited privacy as both Bitcoin addresses and transactions are registered on the blockchain, opening them to public access. Even pseudonymous addresses are not fully private. A few transactions carried on by a participant over time can be linked to the same address, allowing the possibility of others to become aware of an address owner's trends and their identity.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nAnother advantage of Monero over bitcoin is fungibility. This means that two units of a currency can be mutually substituted with no difference between them. While two $1 bills are equal in value, they are not fungible, as each carries a unique serial number. In contrast, two one-ounce gold bars of the same grade are fungible, as both have the same value and don\u2019t carry any distinguishing features. Using this analogy, a bitcoin is the $1 bill, while a Monero is that piece of gold.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nThe transaction history of each bitcoin is recorded on the blockchain. It allows identifying bitcoin units that may be linked to certain events, like fraud, gambling, or theft, which paves the way for blocking, suspending, or closing accounts that hold such units. Imagine receiving a few bitcoins today that were previously used for gambling, and they are banned in the future, leading to a loss.\n\nMonero has a non-traceable transaction history, which offers participants a much safer network where they don\u2019t run the risk of having their held units be refused or blacklisted by others.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nMonero is among the top 30 most popular cryptocurrencies in the industry.\n\nHow Does Monero Improve Privacy?\n\nMonero alleviates privacy concerns using the concepts of ring signatures and stealth addresses. Ring signatures enable a sender to conceal their identity from other participants in a group. Ring signatures are anonymous digital signatures from one member of the group, but they don\u2019t reveal which member signs a transaction.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nTo generate a ring signature, the Monero platform uses a combination of a sender\u2019s account keys and clubs it with public keys on the blockchain. This makes it unique as well as private. It hides the sender's identity, as it is computationally impossible to ascertain which of the group members' keys was used to produce the complex signature.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nStealth addresses add additional privacy, as these randomly generated addresses for one-time use are created for each transaction on behalf of the recipient. The use of these stealth addresses enables concealing the actual destination address of a transaction, and it hides the identity of the receiving participant.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nRing Confidential Transactions, or RingCT, also enable hiding the amount of a transaction. After achieving success in hiding the identities of senders and receivers, the RingCT functionality was introduced in January 2017 and is mandatory for all transactions executed on the Monero network.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nMonero's Challenges\n\nWhile privacy fuels the rapid adoption of Monero, it also brings with it several challenges. For instance, the non-traceability and privacy features allow them to be used for disreputable purposes and at questionable marketplaces, including those like drugs and gambling. This is one of the reasons why markets that were popular on the dark web, like AlphaBay and Oasis, showed increased use of Monero before they were shut down.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nReports by CNBC cite the case of hackers creating malicious software that infected computers to mine Monero and send it to North Korea. Monero is essentially open to be used for illicit activities and for evading law enforcement, as it remains outside of capital controls with no traceability.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nHow to Mine Monero\n\nMonero runs on all leading OS platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and FreeBSD. The currency supports a mining process where individuals get rewarded for their activities by joining mining pools, or they can mine coins individually.\n\nMonero mining can be performed on a standard computer and does not need any specific hardware such as the application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). An ASIC is a costly form of hardware that is commonly used to mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Instead, you can use the CPU or GPU of your own computer to mine the currency. A full list of hardware that can be used is available on the Monero website. Users can also install certain software, which may cost a developer fee.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nAccording to the company's website, Monero relies on proof-of-work mining.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff This is an algorithm that provides security to certain cryptocurrencies like Monero. This system prevents problems surrounding double-spending, which can skew the supply, showing there's much more than actually available.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nPurchasing the currency is as easy as going on an exchange or looking for a seller who's willing to unload their supply. You can also buy Monero through an automated teller machine (ATM) that is enabled for cryptocurrencies.\n\nYou don't need any special hardware to mine Monero. The currency runs on all major operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and FreeBSD\n\nIs Monero Illegal? Monero is not an illegal cryptocurrency. Unlike others, it is a privacy-oriented cryptocurrency that provides users with anonymity. This means it is not traceable. This characteristic, however, does make it very popular on the darknet and for use with certain activities such as gambling and the sale of drugs.\n\nIs Monero a Good Investment? If you're interested in cryptocurrencies, Monero may be a good investment. The price of the currency jumped more than 64% between Aug. 26, 2020, and Aug. 26, 2023. Additionally, it doesn't cost much to start, as you don't need any special hardware. You can actually use the CPU of your own computer to mine it, and Monero works with all major operating systems. This will save you a lot of money in fees and charges.\n\nWhere Can I Buy Monero? You can purchase Monero through a digital or virtual currency exchange. Or you can search for an individual seller or an ATM enabled for cryptocurrencies.\n\nHow Long Does It Take to Mine One Monero? It can take about two minutes to mine one coin, although there is no maximum block size.\n\nCan XMR Be Traced? Monero, or XMR, is untraceable. Unlike other coins, such as Bitcoin, Monero has a non-traceable transaction history. This characteristic offers participants a much safer network where they don\u2019t run the risk of having their held units be refused or blacklisted by others.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCryptocurrencies are a very popular investment for many people. But the popularity\u2014and price\u2014of Bitcoin may be a turnoff. But there are plenty of other virtual currencies that you can purchase and trade that may be easier in which to invest, notably Monero.\n\nThe privacy-rich attributes have helped Monero become a recognizable cryptocurrency and one to keep an eye on. Investors can trade in Monero on leading cryptocurrency exchanges like Kraken, Poloniex, and Bitfinex. However, it's important to remember that what makes Monero so popular\u2014namely, its privacy features\u2014can also lead to some major challenges, such as its use in illegal activities.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (\u201cICOs\u201d) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

        "title": "Unchained's Distinctive Approach to Bitcoin's Financial Sovereignty - USA TODAY",
        "content": "Jon Stojan\n\nContributor\n\nAs one of the biggest groundbreaking inventions of recent years, Bitcoin has changed the investment landscape dramatically since its debut in 2009. In 2021, Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $69,000, prompting new investors to enter the market. However, this was short-lived as the market entered its bearish phase in 2022, and the price took a hit. As Bitcoin\u2019s next halving event, scheduled for April 2024 nears, experts reckon the next bull run might be the biggest one yet. While that may be true, future-minded investors need a solution to cushion them from the devastating losses that always occur during the bearish season. That\u2019s what the team at Unchained, the #1 Bitcoin loan provider in the USA, offers.\n\nCEO Joe Kelly and Chief Science Officer Dhruv Bansal began conceptualizing Unchained in 2015 after selling their last company, Infochimps. At the time, Bitcoin was much smaller, with fewer investors and users. However, as early adopters, the duo knew Bitcoin had the potential to flip the entire financial landscape and transform other industries. They started thinking about a business plan and embarked on a journey to build a financial company built on Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cFor an asset that grows like Bitcoin, making sure you don\u2019t lose it over the decades is the most important and valuable thing you can do,\u201d Bansal observes. Unchained\u2019s main objective is to help investors avoid the most common pitfalls that cause people to lose their bitcoinas the market conditions change. As the leading Bitcoin financial company, Unchained is committed to individual Bitcoin ownership and financial sovereignty, unlike other custodial services and exchanges. They support this mission in several ways, including helping Bitcoin holders buy and sell their Bitcoins without go-betweens and keeping investments safe in the long run by ensuring they don\u2019t lose them to theft, loss or hacks.\n\nUnchained also helps holders use their Bitcoin as collateral and borrow in US dollars against it should they need liquidity during times when the price is lower than average. \u201cWe are the only Bitcoin lender protecting loan collateral with collaborative custody,\u201d Kelly explains. The process begins with sending the holder\u2019s Bitcoin to a dedicated multi-signature address for confirmation. Upon confirmation, the funds are released to the borrower\u2019s bank account. Meanwhile, the holder retains one of the three keys used to generate the multisig address for the loan. This solves the holder\u2019s immediate needs while ensuring they will still reap the potential gains of their Bitcoin investment in the long run, as no single person can authorize any transactions against the collateral.\n\n\u201cUnchained is committed to a vision of Bitcoin ubiquity and a financial system built on the right values and principles,\u201d Bansal explains. This commitment is a major differentiator that explains why Unchained not only survived the crypto contagion, which wiped out nearly all crypto lenders (Celcius, Voyager, Vauld, Bable, BlockFi) but also proceeded to raise a $60M Series B. The team plans to channel part of the Series B investment toward strengthening the bridges between USD and BTC, such as Unchained\u2019s credit and trading products, through new dollar-focused products such as checking accounts, credit cards, etc.\n\n\u201cWe believe that offering traditional dollar-denominated products will further benefit our clients by allowing them to manage their traditional assets with the same high product and service standards we deliver for their Bitcoin,\u201d the team shares. By offering traditional USD banking options to complement its BTC product suite, Unchained is disrupting and improving existing USD banking\u2014all without putting anything on a blockchain."

        "content": "Bitcoin prices fell on Wednesday afternoon trade in Asia, along with all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Notably, BNB, the native token of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, added to its weekly drop after the company announced the closing of its cryptocurrency payment service Binance Connect. Investor concerns remained on edge following Fitch Ratings\u2019 downgrade warning on Tuesday for dozens of major U.S. banks including JPMorgan.\n\nSee related article: TradFi has its eyes on crypto, and here\u2019s the real reason why: Opinion\n\nBitcoin dips; Binance faces heat\n\nBitcoin dropped 0.69% to US$29,160 in the 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, bringing its weekly losses to 2.18%, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin has been trading below US$30,000 since last Wednesday. The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency\u2019s trading volume gained 8.71%, but its market capitalization lost 0.84% to US$567.23 billion in the past 24 hours.\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s earlier reputation as a highly volatile asset attracted traders who thrived on rapid price swings. With the decrease in volatility, such opportunities for substantial short-term gains have become less common,\u201d said Nigel Green, founder and chief executive officer of financial management group deVere, in an emailed statement on Monday.\n\n\u201cFor investors who thrive on volatility, the calmer waters of the Bitcoin market can feel limiting. They must adapt their strategies to the new normal, focusing on longer-term trends and holding positions for extended periods,\u201d Green added.\n\nBNB, the native token of the largest crypto exchange Binance, fell 1.92% to US$234.66, logging a 4.17% weekly decline. Binance said it will shut down its cryptocurrency payment service Binance Connect on Wednesday, due to \u201cchanging market and user needs.\u201d\n\nBinance filed a protective court order against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday, seeking to restrict the agency\u2019s \u201coverbroad\u201d requests for information. The SEC sued Binance, its U.S. platform, and Chief Executive Officer Changpeng Zhao in June for alleged breach of securities laws.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization fell 1.31% to US$1.16 trillion, while market volume climbed 22.48% to US$32.08 billion.\n\nDeGods sales drop, but tops rankings\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.14% to 2,471.55 over the 24 hours leading up to 7.10 p.m. in Hong Kong, but posted gains of 0.23% on the week.\n\nAt the same time, Forkast\u2019s Ethereum NFT and the Polygon NFT indexes gained, while the index measuring Solana NFTs declined.\n\nTotal NFT sales volume dropped 2.16% in the past 24 hours to US$15.79 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Total NFT transactions also dropped 9.78% to US$565,906.\n\nNFT sales volume on Ethereum dropped 7.97% to US$9.14 million, although the network topped CryptoSlam\u2019s sales volume rankings.\n\nAmong collections, Ethereum-based DeGods topped sales rankings with US$1.23 million, although it was 37.85% lower than the previous day.\n\n\u201cClearly collectors have lost some faith in the DeGods team after fumbling the DeGods Season III art release, and the announcement of moving y00ts again from Polygon to Ethereum,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs.\n\nMythos-based DMarket ranked second, rising 8.33% to US$1.01 million, while Polygon\u2019s DraftKings ranked third after its sales volumes climbed 52.19% in the past 24 hours to US$771,722.\n\nAsian bourses, U.S. stock futures fall; European equities mixed\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nMost Asian equity markets were down on Wednesday. China\u2019s Shenzhen Component, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, Japan\u2019s Nikkei, and South Korea\u2019s Kospi dropped at the end of trading hours, following lackluster economic data coming out of China.\n\nThe country\u2019s economic activity data for July \u2014 retail sales, industrial output and investment \u2014 all came in lower than expected, raising concerns about the health of the world\u2019s second-largest economy. The People\u2019s Bank of China on Tuesday unexpectedly cut loan rates by 15 basis points to 2.5%, the steepest cut in three years.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s cyclical soft patch keeps deepening. Data from a wide range of indicators, including credit growth, investment in capital markets and properties, industrial production, retail sales, construction, exports, and manufacturing and agricultural product prices reveal an overall loss of economic momentum,\u201d Singapore-based DBS bank said in a research report on Monday.\n\n\u201cIn addition to lackluster economic data, a long-simmering threat to economic and financial stability, the intersection of weak property market prices and a mountain of debt in the sector, is causing considerable concern,\u201d DBS added.\n\nU.S. stock futures dropped as of 8.30 p.m. in Hong Kong with the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures, and the Nasdaq 100 futures all in the red.\n\nRatings agency Fitch has warned of a downgrade for dozens of major U.S. banks including JPMorgan. The agency also downgraded the United States\u2019 long term credit rating from AAA to AA+ earlier this month citing long-term macroeconomic concerns.\n\nMeanwhile, annual headline inflation in the United Kingdom dropped sharply to 6.8% in July from 7.9% in June, the lowest level since February 2022 and matching market expectations. However, core inflation, which excludes volatile energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices, remained unchanged from June at 6.9%, and slightly above expectations of 6.8%.\n\n\u201cThe plan that we are executing on is clearly working, but we need to keep with that plan, keep making responsible decisions when it comes to public finances, and we need to make sure that fiscal policy is aligned with monetary policy at the Bank of England,\u201d Gareth Davies, exchequer secretary at the U.K. Treasury, told CNBC on Wednesday.\n\nEuropean bourses were mixed on Wednesday, with the benchmark STOXX 600 falling while Germany\u2019s DAX 40 strengthened during afternoon trading hours in Europe."

        "content": "A Bitcoin (BTC) wallet containing 1,005 BTC mined in 2010 has reawakened, with an anonymous user moving the long dormant coins to new addresses in a number of different transactions.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Cointelegraph, Kirill Kretov \u2014 a blockchain researcher, developer and cryptocurrency trader \u2014 weighed in on the event after initially flagging the movement of the BTC, which was mined just a year after Bitcoin\u2019s inception.\n\nCointelegraph independently verified the details of the wallet using blockchain data from Blockchair. According to the wallet statement, the 1,005 BTC was valued at just $328 when it was received in 2010. The coins were valued at over $29 million at the time of publication.\n\nThe wider cryptocurrency community also took note of the BTC awakening, with some questioning whether Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, was moving coins:\n\nLooks like Satoshi is back! I can bet this wallet is owned by Satoshi Nakamoto himself. \u2014 The Wise Guy (@wiseguyhoshi) August 16, 2023\n\nKretov told Cointelegraph it was unlikely that Bitcoin\u2019s creator was quietly moving virgin BTC, suggesting that a long-term holder or entity associated with previous dormant Bitcoin awakenings was behind the transaction. The researcher added that the holder could be selling Bitcoin in an over-the-counter transaction:\n\n\u201cI may expect the price to be higher than the current market because these are 100% clean Bitcoins. Not to mention how old they are, which makes them especially attractive to crypto-numismatics.\u201d\n\nKretov believes that the wallet could be controlled by the same user that had previously moved Bitcoin from wallets in 13 different instances between 2020 and 2021. According to the researcher, this involved 13 awakenings, each of 1,000 BTC (from 20 wallets containing 50 mined BTC), amounting to 13,000 BTC.\n\nKretov also noted that his research archives, which monitor a large number of virgin Bitcoin wallets in the immediate years after Bitcoin\u2019s inception, have only flagged three other awakenings of 1,000 BTC or more.\n\nThis included a first instance, where 1,000 BTC from two wallets mined in 2011 was moved in December 2021. In April 2023, 1,000 BTC mined in 2011 was moved from a single wallet before another 1,037 BTC was moved in July 2023 from a wallet dating back to 2012\n\n\u201cThose BTC are from 2011 and 2012, and the sources of funds are different \u2014 not freshly mined coins. So the present awakening is much closer to those 13 instances.\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph recently reported, another dormant BTC wallet holding over 1,037 coins transferred its funds to a new address. The BTC had been obtained in April 2012 at an estimated value of $5,100, while its total value when it was moved in 2023 was around $31 million.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: The value of a legacy: Hunting down Satoshi\u2019s Bitcoin"

        "content": "In the latest episode of Cointelegraph\u2019s The Market Report, analyst Marcel Pechman discusses the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approved in the European Union, which went live on the Euronext Amsterdam exchange on Aug. 15. Despite the seemingly unconventional choice of the Guernsey regulator for its constitution, the fund\u2019s listing on Euronext suggests a strategic maneuver, though its meager 1 million euro launch and unfamiliar management casts a shadow over its appeal.\n\nMoving on, Pechman shifts focus to the United States Bitcoin ETF landscape, where the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has once again delayed its decision on approving a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF, setting a potential deadline for early 2024. This recurrent cycle of postponements echoes the challenges faced over the past decade.\n\nThe lack of regulatory clarity in the U.S. cryptocurrency market underscores the SEC\u2019s reluctance to endorse a spot crypto ETF.\n\nPechman also discusses Bitcoin\u2019s price trajectory. According to Bitcoin investor Jesse Myers, breaking the $100,000 barrier is intricately tied to the block subsidy halving in mid-2024. Myers challenges the efficient market hypothesis, positing that the market will take 12 to 18 months post-halving to fully assimilate the implications.\n\nPechman conveys skepticism about predicting market outcomes, acknowledging many factors that can sway Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory, including Federal Reserve decisions, banking liquidity, economic conditions and unforeseen events.\n\nPechman concludes by circling back to the primary drivers of Bitcoin\u2019s value: the abundance of fiat currency and government debt. He foresees Bitcoin surpassing $100,000, but the real-world purchasing power of that sum might be diminished due to inflation.\n\nListen to the full episode of The Market Report on the new Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel, and don\u2019t forget to click \u201cLike\u201d and \u201cSubscribe\u201d to keep up-to-date with all our latest content."

        "content": "El Salvador, which adopted Bitcoin (BTC) as a legal tender in 2021, has seen its dollar bond outperform the majority of the emerging markets with a 70% return in 2023. The massive rally of the bond has now drawn interest from several institutional giants, including JP Morgan, Eaton Vance and PGIM Fixed, prompting President Nayib Bukele to say, \u201cI told you so.\u201d\n\nApart from the institutional giants, the likes of Lord Abbett & Co LLC, Neuberger Berman Group LLC and UBS Group AG have also added debt security since April, reported Bloomberg.\n\nPaolo Ardoino, chief technology officer of Bitfinex, told Cointelegraph that the performance of El Salvador bonds is a clear signal that investors are supportive of the financial policies of the El Salvador government and demonstrates the renewed interest in investing in the El Salvador story while adding:\n\n\u201cAs the first company to receive a Digital Asset Licence, we are seeing significant interest in digital asset issuance and renewable energy investments, which the country has in abundance and is being used for Bitcoin mining and to provide more energy for the country\u2019s electrical grid.\u201d\n\nThe growing demand for El Salvador\u2019s debt security in 2023 is quite a contrast to its performance a couple of years ago when it first adopted Bitcoin as a legal tender. The BTC adoption created uncertainty among investors who bet against the country\u2019s bonds, with several financial agencies casting a shadow of doubt on the country\u2019s financial future.\n\nIn February 2022, the American credit rating agency Fitch lowered the country\u2019s long-term Issuer Default Rating from B- to CCC, citing policy uncertainty and the Bitcoin adoption, along with an $800-million debt payment due for January 2023.\n\nRelated: El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin strategy evolved with the bear market in 2022\n\nEl Salvador paid $800 million in debt in full within the due maturing time at the start of this year, raising confidence in the country\u2019s bonds again. President Nayib Bukele at the time noted that they have proven every finance pundit wrong who doubted whether they would be able to pay their debts in time after Bitcoin adoption.\n\nIn the past year, almost every legacy international news outlet said that because of our \u201c#Bitcoin bet\u201d, El Salvador was going to default on its debt by January 2023 (since we had an 800 million dollar bond maturing today).\n\n\n\nLiterally, hundreds of articles https://t.co/rEiK7K13U4 \u2014 Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) January 24, 2023\n\nThis rise in the confidence of investors is visible from the bond\u2019s performance throughout 2023. During the same time frame, El Salvador also passed a landmark crypto bill, paving the way for a Bitcoin-backed Volcano bond.\n\nEl Salvador bond performance 2018-2023. Source: Bloomberg\n\nEl Salvador and its president have been at the receiving end of criticism ever since they first adopted Bitcoin in September 2021 as legal tender along with the United States dollar. Financial pundits predicted that the BTC adoption will further strain Salvador\u2019s financial conditions. However, within two years, the debt security of the state has become a hotcake among institutional giants, the same that once advised against its buying.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: What it\u2019s actually like to use Bitcoin in El Salvador"

        "content": "A potential wave of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, PayPal\u2019s new stablecoin and a key Ethereum upgrade are among the catalysts that could wake crypto from its hibernation.\n\nWhile early 2023 has seen the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies improve from the second half of 2022, the past five months have seen more lethargy, with Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz calling the markets \u201clackadaisical\u201d in June.\n\nHowever, analysts told Cointelegraph that they\u2019re tipping several catalysts that could add a new spark to crypto markets.\n\nApollo Crypto Chief Investment Officer Henrik Andersson is among those with their eyes fixed on the potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, saying it was \u201cnot unlikely\u201d to see one approved in the next six months.\n\nHe told Cointelegraph that cryptocurrency's institutional acceptance has continued to rise, adding that \u201cthe worst of the macro tightening appears to be behind us.\u201d He said that central banks have paused rate hikes, meaning we\u2019ve potentially reached the end of the hiking cycle.\n\nAndersson has also seen PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch and potential moves from X (Twitter) to include crypto payments as bullish markers for future crypto adoption.\n\n\u201cThere are other potential catalysts on the horizon, for example, what is X planning in terms of payments and financial applications \u2014 crypto is a real possibility there.\u201d\n\nMarkus Thielen, head of research at crypto financial services platform Matrixport, has also placed his bets on spot Bitcoin ETFs, but says an upcoming upgrade to Ethereum is also one to keep an eye on.\n\n\u201cTwo significant catalysts are supporting Bitcoin and Ethereum prices into year-end: the potential SEC approval for a US-listed physical Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum\u2019s EIP-4844 upgrade, which is expected for Q4 2023.\u201d\n\nThe Ethereum upgrade will introduce a mechanism called proto-danksharding that will reduce fees and increase transaction throughput.\n\nIn the short term\n\nMeanwhile, Tony Sycamore, a market analyst for the trading platform IG Australia, told Cointelegraph that investors should keep an eye on the minutes from the Fed\u2019s last meeting.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to release the minutes of its July meeting on Aug. 16 and it is expected to keep rates on hold.\n\n\u201cFor Bitcoin specifically, it will be looking towards US stock markets for signs of stabilization after the Nasdaq posted its second consecutive losing week and towards the interest rate market, given that yields have closed higher in each of the last four weeks.\u201d\n\nRelated: Bitcoin has bottomed despite 'astonishing' BTC price action \u2014 Analyst\n\nBitcoin prices have oscillated within a $6,000 range-bound channel since the middle of March. Resistance just above $31,000 has proven to be too strong on at least four separate occasions while support was found at $25,000 during the mid-June dip.\n\nFurthermore, markets have suffered record lows in volatility as the liquidity and volumes have dried up in recent months.\n\nMagazine: Wolf Of All Streets worries about a world where Bitcoin hits $1M: Hall of Flame"

Discover SCENE\n\nYet another high-profile politician is backing Bitcoin.\n\nIn an unexpected victory, presidential candidate Javier Milei, known for his pro-Bitcoin and libertarian economics, earned the top spot in Argentina's primary yesterday.\n\nMilei and his coalition, La Libertad Avanza (\"Liberty Advances\"), raked in over 30% of the votes, beating second-place contender, the center-right coalition, Juntos Por El Cambio (\"Together For Change)\", by slightly less than a 2% margin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUp until Sunday\u2019s shocking results, La Libertad Avanza was considered a reasonably small party that offered minor representation in Congress\u2013despite its successful first foray.\n\nFounded in 2021, during its first legislative elections (which took place the same year) the coalition surprisingly received 17% of the votes In Buenos Aires, becoming the third most-voted coalition in the district.\n\nThose elections earned the coalition two congressional seats, which were occupied by none other than Javier Milei and his now-running mate Victoria Villarruel.\n\nThe candidate\u2014which critics have placed on the far right of the political spectrum\u2014has been lauded by so-called protest voters, and among them cryptocurrency advocates.\n\nAdam Dubove is an Argentine Bitcoin enthusiast who voted for the first time in eight years, \u201cbecause of Milei.\u201d Dubove is a political theorist, who has been on myriad talk shows over the years discussing the country\u2019s political and economic situation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe told Decrypt that it\u2019s not necessarily because of Bitcoin, but rather \u201ca different mindset,\u201d and someone who will \u201cstir up the hen.\u201d\n\nMilei has appeared on multiple talk shows before and during his presidential campaign, preaching the benefits of Bitcoin and crypto.\n\nThe self-proclaimed libertarian economist has called Bitcoin (and some of its competition, like Ethereum) a \u201creturn of money to its original creator: the private sector.\u201d\n\nHe also touted Bitcoin\u2019s finite supply and considers cryptocurrency a safer alternative to transacting in gold or silver.\n\nNot all is rosy in Milei\u2019s connection to cryptocurrency, however.\n\nMilei, Ponzi schemes and the central bank\n\nHe was sued for allegedly promoting a Ponzi scheme in Argentina called Coinx, which is being accused of stealing at least $800,000 in Argentine pesos.\n\nIn a 2022 interview, Milei denied any wrongdoing by the company, which offered high monthly interest rates--to the tune of 8%. According to him, \"Their business model is the same as that of a bank,\" with the only difference being that \"since their interest rate isn't regulated by the central bank, they can pay more.\"\n\nAccording to Manuel Ferrari, a board member of the NGO Bitcoin Argentina, this connection is a concern.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPromoting projects like Coinx makes me not trust him, yet,\u201d he told Decrypt.\n\nFerrari, a co-founder of Money on Chain, a BTC-backed stablecoin protocol, explained that he doesn\u2019t think Milei is pro-Bitcoin\u2013pointing to a 2019 video of the candidate declaring he \u201cisn\u2019t a specialist in cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nThat said, Ferrari told Decrypt that he does think Milei is the \u201cleast likely\u201d of presidential candidates to get things wrong about Bitcoin\u2013and that introducing the freedom to choose currencies \u201cdoes interest him.\u201d\n\nWhat he\u2019s mainly known for is his unabated bashing of the country\u2019s central bank.\n\nLast year he claimed he would \u201cblow it up,\u201d which he has called a scam for cheating \u201cgood people\u201d through inflationary tax.\n\nArgentina currently suffers from rampant inflation, clocking in at 135% this year.\n\nAlthough the country\u2019s Central Bank made anti-crypto moves through a recent ban on digital wallets, not much has changed in the burgeoning crypto scene, which according to Chainalysis, ranks Argentina\u2019s crypto adoption at 13th worldwide.\n\nWhile some in the crypto space are hopeful Milei might push for an El Salvador-style Bitcoin standard, or other similar pro-crypto measures, the eccentric presidential hopeful might not be so willing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLast month, for example, he announced his intentions to \u201cdollarize\u201d the Argentine economy."

However, low volatility could prove to be a blessing in disguise, said Nigel Green, founder and chief executive officer of financial management group deVere, in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cThis newfound stability attracts institutional investors, who have been historically wary of entering the market due to its extreme price swings,\u201d Green said.\n\n\u201cThis stability is also a boon for businesses and consumers looking for a reliable store of value or medium of exchange,\u201d he added.\n\nStory continues\n\nDigital asset investment products saw an inflow of US$29 million in the week ending Aug. 11. That followed three consecutive weeks of outflows totalling around US$144 million, according to a Monday report by European alternative asset manager CoinShares. Bitcoin saw an inflow of US$27 million \u2014 roughly 93% of the total inflows.\n\nThe inflows to digital asset investment products are \u201clikely due to the recent U.S. inflation data, which was slightly below expectations, signifying that a September rate hike is less likely,\u201d CoinShares wrote in the report.\n\nEther dipped 0.33% to US$1,840.95 but added 0.71% for the past seven days. Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies all traded lower with the exception of Solana\u2019s SOL, which moved up 1.39% to US$24.82 and gained 7.09% for the week.\n\nSynthesis One, an artificial intelligence (AI) data crowdsourcing platform based on the Solana blockchain, launched its new train-to-earn application \u201cWorkspace by Synesis\u201d on Monday.\n\nThe app allows users to train AIs as data providers while earning cryptocurrencies as rewards. This process, Synthesis One claims, will result in a \u201cfully traceable and auditable\u201d data supply chain.\n\nShiba Inu, which has recently replaced Polkadot as the 10th biggest non-stablecoin cryptocurrency by market cap, led the losers, falling 2.89% to US$0.00001028 while logging a weekly jump of 14.51%\n\nThe token received a boost from the incoming launch of Shibarium, a layer-2 network built by Shiba Inu developers whose launch date is yet to be unveiled.\n\nBlockchain analytics platform Lookonchain noted Tuesday that bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital had been selling its assets including Shiba Inu, which could weaken the upward trend in the token.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dipped 0.18% in the past 24 hours to US$1.17 trillion, while trading volume edged up 7.75% to US$26.17 billion.\n\nWeekly NFT transactions rise to year-high\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index moved up 0.27% in the past 24 hours to 2,482.04 as of 17:50 p.m. in Hong Kong, and up 0.05% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum, Polygon and Cardano NFT indexes also logged gains, while the index for Solana dropped.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume rose 28.04% in the past 24 hours to over US$17.71 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volumes on the Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, and Cardano blockchains all logged double-digit gains, while volumes on the Bitcoin blockchain shrank.\n\nIn the week ending Aug. 13, NFT sales topped US$101 million after sitting short of US$100 million for three consecutive weeks. NFT transactions for the week exceeded 2.8 million, a high since February 2022.\n\nOn the past week\u2019s surge in NFT sales, Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, said that he saw the emergence of low-priced collections as key to a sustained potential uptick in the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting a glimpse of the future of NFTs. More affordable prices, higher volume, likely big brands and this is what we\u2019re seeing in DraftKings, DMarket, Gods Unchained, and Sorare,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nCombined, Petscher noted, those three collections alone notched 872,185 transactions \u2014 nearly a third of the week\u2019s total transactions.\n\n\u201cThe question is, is this sustainable? I think it is, and that\u2019s exactly why this will be the future. Traders haven\u2019t really left NFT, they just ran out of liquidity since there\u2019s no profits. But they can afford NFTs that are priced at just a few dollars,\u201d Petscher added.\n\nAmong NFT collections, Ethereum-based DeGods saw the largest 24-hour sales volume, surging 255.38% to over US$2.92 million after the project launched its \u201cSeason 3\u201d digital art collection on Sunday.\n\nEthereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mythos Chain-based DMarket, ImmutableX-based Gods Unchained and Polygon-based DraftKings took up the rest of the top five NFT collections in terms of 24-hour sales volume.\n\nAdidas Originals, a subdivision of sports apparel corporation Adidas, will launch its first NFT auction on Aug. 22 in collaboration with crypto payment platform Moonpay.\n\nThe auction will feature 100 \u201cproduct-linked\u201d NFTs, each of which can be later redeemed for a pair of limited-edition sneakers in the real world as well as a digital replica.\n\nMost Asia stock markets drop, U.S. equities down\n\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Image: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures slid as of 18:30 p.m. in Hong Kong following gains at the close of trading Monday, while the main stock indexes traded mixed. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng and South Korea\u2019s Kospi all logged losses, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei moved higher.The stock market took a blow after China\u2019s central bank unexpectedly lowered the rate of its medium-term lending facility (MLF) by 15 basis points to 2.5% on Tuesday morning, only two months after the previous rate cut in June.\n\n\u201cThe slightly earlier timing and a larger than expected 15 basis point rate cut of MLF show that Beijing feels the urgency to take more policy easing actions to stabilize expectations and growth,\u201d Xiaojia Zhi, chief China economist at international banking group Credit Agricole, told Bloomberg, adding that China could see more monetary easing in the coming months.\n\n\u201c(The rate cut in China) is a positive but I suspect the support to the market from this will be subdued and short-lived,\u201d Redmond Wong, a market strategist at Saxo Capital Markets Hong Kong, told Bloomberg in another Tuesday report. \u201cInvestors now are worried about credit events, not just from the ailing property sector.\u201d\n\nThe decision was announced shortly before China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics reported disappointing economic data for July. That data included a rise in the urban unemployment rate, as well as decelerated and smaller-than-expected growth in retail sales and industrial production, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nU.S. global investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a Sunday note it expected the Federal Reserve to start cutting the interest rates in the second quarter of 2024 and keep the rates unchanged at its next meeting in September, Bloomberg reported on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe cuts in our forecast are driven by this desire to normalize the funds rate from a restrictive level once inflation is closer to target,\u201d wrote Goldman Sachs analysts in the Sunday note.\n\nU.S. investors now await the release of retail sales data on Tuesday, followed by the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s July meeting minutes on Wednesday, for further insight on the health of the U.S. economy and the Fed\u2019s future monetary policies.\n\nThe Fed meets on Sep. 19 to make its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest level since January 2001. Analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predict a 88.5% chance there will be no interest rate hike in September.\n\nElsewhere, European bourses traded lower on Tuesday, with the benchmark STOXX 600 and Germany\u2019s DAX 40 both dropping during afternoon hours in Asia.\n\nStocks in U.K. and Sweden spearheaded the drop in the European markets, as a strong wage increase in the U.K. and high inflation data in Sweden triggered fears of more interest rate hikes, according to Reuters on Tuesday.\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEurope has beaten the U.S. with the roll-out of the first Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) as London-based Jacobi Asset Management today announced the product's listing on Euronext Amsterdam.\n\nAfter receiving approval from the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC) in October 2021, the firm initially planned to launch its Bitcoin ETF product last year.\n\nIt, however, decided to postpone the launch, deeming it an inopportune time due to the collapse of the Terra ecosystem and the bankruptcy of the FTX crypto exchange.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nToday, the Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF is finally live, trading under the ticker BCOIN. It charges investors a 1.5% annual management fee.\n\nFidelity Digital Assets handles custodial services for the fund, while Flow Traders takes on the role of market maker. Authorized participants include Jane Street and DRW.\n\n\u201cThis fund has been designed to give institutional investors a simple, secure, and transparent access to Bitcoin whilst addressing their sustainability requirements,\" Jacobi CEO Martin Bednall told Decrypt. \"We believe this ETF launch will be the catalyst for institutional adoption of digital assets.\"\n\nJacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF is also billed as the first decarbonized digital asset fund compliant with Article 8 of the European Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), which applies to funds promoting environmental and social objectives.\n\nThe firm partnered with digital asset platform Zumo to implement a verifiable built-in Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) solution, which offers institutional investors the ability to deal in Bitcoin while also meeting their Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) objectives.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs the Jacobi CEO explained to Decrypt, RECs, and offsets are inherently different and should not be confused. Whilst offsets can be used for any aspect of a company\u2019s carbon footprint (one offset represents one tonne of CO2e), RECs relate to electricity consumption only (one REC represents 1 MWh of electricity).\n\nThe REC solution verifies the utilization of renewable energy sources, contributing to the fund's overall decarbonization and adherence to sustainable principles.\n\n\u201cThis makes RECs an ideal tool to use for crypto, where the most material part of the carbon footprint relates to electricity consumption,\" Bednall told Decrypt. \"Furthermore, the use of RECs is recognized under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol as a Market-Based accounting method and can be used to claim full decarbonization, whereas the same claim cannot be used for offsets.\u201d\n\nJacobi makes leap from crypto ETNs\n\nThe firm emphasized that as an open-ended fund, its Bitcoin ETF will mark a major shift from the traditional exchange-traded notes (ETNs), to date the most widely spread structure in Europe for crypto-backed financial instruments.\n\nOne key distinction between an ETN and an ETF lies in the ownership structure and the nature of the investment. In the case of an ETF, shareholders possess a stake in the underlying assets held by the fund. ETN investors, on the other hand, own a debt-security.\n\n\u201cETFs are approved by regulators and are overseen by regulated managers. These managers sign off all activities and report on a regular basis to the regulator. ETNs do not have such a party providing this level of investor protection,\u201d Bednall told Decrypt.\n\nETFs are restricted from using leverage or incorporating derivatives, which helps mitigate the potential risks associated with market manipulation. Conversely, ETNs may incorporate leverage or derivatives, thereby introducing an additional layer of risk.\n\nThe launch of Jacobi\u2019s Bitcoin ETF would also mean that European investors will be ahead of their American counterparts in accessing the much sought-after product.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGemini, the crypto exchange helmed by the Winklevoss twins, was the first U.S.-based entity to apply for a Bitcoin ETF ten years ago, and American investors are yet to see any of such a product.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has repeatedly rejected or postponed any application it received, citing, among other concerns, market manipulation.\n\nThere's renewed hope that, after years of rejections, a Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. will eventually receive regulatory approval.\n\nA new wave of applications recently reached the SEC's door, beginning with Wall Street giant BlackRock's entry into the space last month and followed by more filings submitted by Fidelity, Valkyrie, and Invesco among others."

        "content": "United States-based Bitcoin (BTC) ATM operator Bitcoin Depot said it posted its best-ever revenue numbers in the second quarter of 2023 as the company looks to expand its footprint after its recent listing on the Nasdaq.\n\nBitcoin Depot released its Q2 results along with several cryptocurrency ecosystem firms, recording $197.5 million in quarterly revenue. The company noted that this is a record figure and an 18% increase from its revenue for the same period in 2022.\n\nThe company also reported that its net loss of $6.1 million was down by 249% year-over-year. Its Q2 profit stood at $25.9 million, while its gross profit margin was 13%, up from 8% during the same period in 2022.\n\nRelated: Economics of Bitcoin ATM market could hinder wider adoption\n\nBitcoin Depot founder and CEO Brandon Mintz said the company would be looking to continue growing through 2023 following its public listing on the Nasdaq. The listing occurred on July 3 following the closing of a business merger with GSR II Meteora Acquisition Corp.\n\nBitcoin Depot has also announced a number of partnerships with convenience stores across the U.S. as it aims to increase the number of Bitcoin access points across the country.

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether fell on Thursday morning in Asia, along with other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptos. Bitcoin briefly dipped below $28,500, while Ether\u2019s losses took it below the psychologically important $1,800 threshold. Smaller altcoins such as Dogecoin, Solana and Ripple suffered the biggest drops. In more bullish news, Coinbase Global received approval to offer crypto futures to U.S. retail investors. The Forkast 500 NFT Index was down, although market sentiment remains positive amid a prolonged increase in global transactions. U.S. equity futures traded mixed after another day of losses Wednesday. The release of the minutes for July\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting on interest rates has cast a shadow over equities, the mood music now suggesting a prolonged period of elevated rates or even another hike.\n\nAnother down day for crypto\n\nBitcoin fell 0.95% in the last 24 hours to US$28,551.83 as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, after briefly falling below the $28,500 threshold earlier in the morning. The largest crypto by market capitalization logged a weekly loss of 3.51%, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nEther also lost 1.80% to US$1,794.91 \u2014 below the psychologically important $1,800 level \u2014 for a 3.28% drop in the past seven days.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were down. Dogecoin was the biggest loser among the top 10, dropping 5.01% to US$0.06731 for a weekly loss of 10.07%. Solana followed in terms of losses, dipping 4.25% to US$22.83. The token fell 5.98% in the past week.\n\n\u201cLarger currencies have seen less pressure than smaller altcoins,\u201d wrote Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at London-based online brokerage FxPro, in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cRising U.S. Treasury yields put pressure on riskier assets,\u201d Kuptsikevich explained.\n\nThe losses arrive in the midst of more positive news for the crypto market.\n\nOn Wednesday, Coinbase Global \u2014 the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S. \u2014 announced that it has received approval from the National Futures Association to offer crypto futures to U.S. retail investors. Previously, only institutional customers could trade crypto futures on the platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoinbase called it a \u201cwatershed moment,\u201d celebrating the win despite facing securities violation charges from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nMajor moment for crypto regulatory clarity in the U.S.\n\n\n\nThis has been a multi-year process toward approval, and we're excited to finally be launching federally regulated crypto derivatives with margin to our U.S. customers.\n\n\n\nWhen there is a clear path to register, we do. https://t.co/TxSOAIpoPj \u2014 Brian Armstrong \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f (@brian_armstrong) August 16, 2023\n\n\u201cThey now have an approved, compliant [Futures Commission Merchant status] and they understand the nuances of crypto markets,\u201d wrote Chris Perkins, president and managing partner at New York-based investment advisor CoinFund.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an important step forward in cultivating deep, liquid derivative markets \u2014 which are very much needed. This should be very good for Coinbase, and excellent for crypto markets,\u201d Perkins added.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP token also lost 3.66% to US$0.5862, posting a weekly loss of 8.08%. On July 13, Ripple appeared to score a victory in its ongoing legal battle with the SEC. A New York court ruled that the sale of XRP on public exchanges does not violate securities laws.\n\nHowever, that aspect of the case is again under scrutiny as, on Aug. 9, the SEC asked for a review of the ruling \u2014 contributing to the downward pressure on XRP\u2019s price.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization moved down 1.47% in the past 24 hours to US$1.14 trillion, while trading volume rose 13.64% to US$33.76 billion.\n\nDaily NFT transactions hit historic levels\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.76% in the past 24 hours to 2457.08 as of 08:45 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index shows a 1.23% loss for the week.\n\nForkast\u2019s Ethereum, Solana and Cardano NFT indexes logged losses, while the index for Polygon gained.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume dipped 7.72% in the past 24 hours to US$15.01 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volumes on the Ethereum, Polygon and ImmutableX blockchains logged losses, while volume on Solana and Mythos gained.\n\nOn Wednesday, the total number of global NFT transactions reached a new milestone, marking an all-time high of 617,619, up from 595,209 on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe NFT market is maturing right in front of us and we\u2019re hitting historic levels on a daily basis,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs.\n\n\u201cSales volume isn\u2019t my measure for how healthy the NFT ecosystem is, it\u2019s the buyers, sellers and it\u2019s transactions,\u201d said Petscher. \u201cI am so bullish on NFTs right now.\u201d\n\nMuch of that optimism, Petscher said, is based on a decline in NFT prices, with the average price of a single NFT now US$22.08, down from US37.85 a week earlier.\n\n\u201cAverage sale prices, I want to point out again they continue to decline and that\u2019s a very, very good thing. We want to bring in the masses. We want our friends and families to come into NFTs,\u201d Petscher added.\n\nDMarket, a collection linked to Mythos network-based blockchain games, topped the NFT collections chart by trade volume on CryptoSlam, adding 0.45% to US$970,811.\n\nEthereum-based DeGods came in second despite a 38.75% slump to US$922,882. The collection recently launched its \u201cSeason 3\u201d collection update on Sunday. New-entry The Heist, an NFT collection based on the strategy game of the same name, placed third with a trade volume of US$756,980.\n\nFed minutes signpost potential hikes ahead\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell | Image: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded mixed as of 10:45 a.m. in Hong Kong following a decline across all three major indexes during regular trading Wednesday.\n\nWednesday\u2019s release of the minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s July meeting has put a dampener on investor sentiment. The discussion revealed concerns among Fed members that additional interest rate hikes may be needed to control inflation.\n\nThe minutes stated that \u201cwith inflation still well above the Committee\u2019s longer-run goal and the labor market remaining tight, most participants continued to see significant upside risks to inflation, which could require further tightening of monetary policy.\u201d\n\nFollowing the release of the meeting minutes, analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool gave a 13.5% chance that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in September, up from 9.5% on Wednesday. The Fed meets on Sep. 19 to make its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest level since January 2001.\n\nThe main stock indexes in Asia \u2014 China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 and South Korea\u2019s Kospi \u2014 all posted losses on Thursday morning, echoing bearish sentiment in the U.S.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite fell 0.15% to around 3,145, its lowest level since early January. That reading combined with weak economic data and the nation\u2019s ongoing property sector debt crisis points to a downturn in the Chinese economy.\n\n\u201cProlonged weakness in property construction will add to destocking pressures in the industrial space and depress consumption demand as well,\u201d said Tao Wang, economist at UBS Investment Bank, according to Reuters.\n\n\u201cIn such a case, economic momentum may stay subdued in the rest of the year and China may miss this year\u2019s growth target of around 5%,\u201d Wang added.\n\nChina has also stopped releasing youth unemployment data after the figure hit a record high of 21.3% in June. The suspension follows a string of downbeat economic reports in China, including retail sales and industrial output, raising fears about a slide into recession.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. retail giant Target reported a slump in quarterly revenue. The US$24.77 billion in Q2 was lower than the estimated US$25.16 billion. However, Target shares still added 2.96% on Wednesday.\n\nMajor U.S. retailer Walmart is set to release its quarterly results on Thursday.\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) speculators are leading a period of \u201cexhaustion and apathy\u201d across the market, new research says.\n\nIn the latest edition of its weekly newsletter, \u201cThe Week On-Chain,\u201d analytics firm Glassnode wrote about waning conviction among Bitcoin\u2019s short-term holders (STH).\n\nBitcoin speculators risk unrealized losses\n\nAfter several months of stagnant BTC price action, frustration among market participants has led to predictions of deeper downside to come.\n\nBulls remain unable to break resistance, while sellers likewise face multiple support zones in the form of trend lines between the current $29,000 and $25,000.\n\nAmong these is the STH cost basis, or realized price. STHs are defined by Glassnode as entities hodling coins for 155 days or less and correspond to the more speculative end of the Bitcoin investor spectrum.\n\nThe STH cost basis has functioned as support throughout 2023, but it is rapidly rising and currently sits at $28,600.\n\nBy contrast, the long-term holder (LTH) cost basis, which reflects the aggregate purchase price of the most stubborn hodlers, is far lower at $20,300.\n\n\u201cThe separation between these two cost basis is an indicator that many recent buyers have a relatively elevated acquisition price,\u201d Glassnode commented.\n\nContinuing, researchers described the market as being potentially \u201ctop heavy,\u201d with even a modest BTC price comedown now apt to send the STH cohort into the red.\n\n\u201cOn a macro scale, this supply distribution does resemble similar periods during bear market recoveries in the past,\u201d they reasoned.\n\n\u201cHowever, on a shorter timeframe, it could be argued to be a slightly top heavy market, with many price sensitive investors at risk of falling into an unrealized loss.\u201d\n\nBitcoin long/short-term on-chain cost basis annotated chart (screenshot).

In direct contrast, Short-Term Holder supply has declined to multi-year low of 2.56M BTC,\u201d The Week On-Chain added.\n\n\u201cOverall, this suggests that conviction of Bitcoin investors does remain impressively high, and very few are willing to liquidate their holdings.\u201d\n\nThe last time that STHs had such little market presence was in October 2021, just before BTC/USD hit its current all-time high of $69,000.\n\nBitcoin long/short-term holder threshold chart.

        "title": "Can Bitcoin Reach $100,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After 2022 saw Bitcoin's (BTC -0.63%) price crater 65% amid an aggressive rising rate environment, this year has been a turnaround story. The top digital asset's recent rally (up 76% as of Aug. 14) has many investors excited about its long-term potential.\n\nBitcoin currently commands about 49% of the overall cryptocurrency market, which is not surprising given its first-mover advantage. And the current price of $29,400, while still 57% below its peak, is astronomically higher than where it was a decade ago.\n\nBut can Bitcoin reach $100,000, equaling a more than threefold rise? Here's why I think this is completely within the realm of possibility.\n\nCathie Wood's perspective\n\nRenowned investor Cathie Wood of Ark Invest has an incredibly lofty price target of nearly $1.5 million per Bitcoin by 2030. That's certainly an extremely bullish outlook. While I have no idea whether this will happen, I agree with Wood's research as it relates to the general direction of Bitcoin's adoption curve.\n\nThe key to Ark Invest's thesis is that Bitcoin simply finds its way into more portfolios. This means that individual and institutional investors, corporations, and governments will start to allocate capital to Bitcoin. Therefore, it can become a more popular reserve asset.\n\nWood and her team also believe that Bitcoin will be used for global remittances, as a form of currency in emerging markets, and to settle transactions among banks in the U.S. I view these scenarios as having lower probabilities of success.\n\nThe digital version of gold\n\nAdding to the point above, Bitcoin's most realistic use case is that it one day solidifies itself as a prominent store of value. To be more specific, it can be a substitute for owning gold, which has been a popular asset for thousands of years.\n\nBut Bitcoin has some important advantages compared to the precious metal. The cryptocurrency is more divisible, useful in transactions, and portable. And its fixed supply cap of 21 million tokens introduces scarcity. If demand for Bitcoin goes up, nothing can be done to alter the growth in its supply because the limit is hard coded into the software.\n\nOn the other hand, should the demand for gold skyrocket, it would become more economically feasible for mining companies to explore different regions of the world to find new deposits. In other words, the supply dynamics could change.\n\nUnderstand the risks\n\nAlthough there's a lot to like about Bitcoin, investors should be mindful of the most important risk factor: Governments banning it. In 2021, China made it illegal to mine and own cryptocurrencies. As the world's second-largest economy, with a population of 1.4 billion people, this was huge news.\n\nNaturally, there's also a worry that the U.S. will follow the same path. What's encouraging, however, is that Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler has publicly stated that the agency has no plan to ban Bitcoin, viewing it as a commodity instead of a security. In fact, clearer regulation could actually be a boon for Bitcoin because then it could be seen as more of a legitimate asset.\n\nA popular argument for banning Bitcoin is that it is used in illicit activities. But this fails to recognize that fiat (government-backed) currencies have long facilitated these types of transactions. And according to data from Chainalysis, a blockchain research company, only 0.24% of cryptocurrency activity in 2022 was used for illegal purposes.\n\nAs wealthier Americans -- at least those who donate to political parties -- start to own more Bitcoin over time, it will be even harder for the government to ban it. And from the perspective of the U.S., prohibiting the use of Bitcoin could lead to the country falling behind in terms of innovation, something that could have drastic consequences from a geopolitical perspective.\n\nKeeping these risks in mind, I still think it's more likely than not that Bitcoin will reach $100,000. And I wouldn't be shocked if it happened within the next five years."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitcoin is following a four-year business cycle and is ready for bullish moves\n\nOn-chain indicators MVRV and VWAPR support this claim\n\nChart analysis points out at bearish near-term price action\n\nKevin Kelly , co-founder of Delphi Digital, perceives a recent shift in a pivotal U.S. manufacturing index as a potential precursor to a crypto upswing and pointed out that many on-chain indicators suggest the start of a new crypto bull cycle.\n\nIn a Twitter (X) thread , he said: \u201cBTC price peaks occur around the same time the ISM shows signs of topping out. Active addresses, total transaction volumes, total fees \u2014 they all peaked alongside tops in the ISM too.\u201d\n\nDrawing a connection between the business cycle and the crypto market, Kelly elucidated that crypto market rebounds usually mirror signs of recovery in the business sector.\n\nHe said, \u201cTurning points in the business cycle have historically been ripe opportunities to increase risk exposure,\u201d before adding, \u201cIt looks like the ISM is nearing the final stages of its two-year downtrend, which again risk assets have been sniffing out.\u201d\n\nAre there any other on-chain indicators that signal Bitcoin is starting its bull cycle?\n\nOn-Chain Indicators\n\nOne of the most reliable metrics for spotting Bitcoin tops and bottoms has been the Market Value to Realized Value ratio. This metric is a ratio between Market capitalization and Realized capitalization. Realized capitalization approximates the value paid for all coins in existence by summing the market value of coins at the time they last moved on the blockchain.\n\nAs you can see from the chart above, we have drawn black lines between MVRV and price tops and red lines to its correlated bottoms. In June last year, MVRV reached a key horizontal level of 0.76, last seen in December 2018 when the previous bull run started and was. Last June, it was even slightly lower than in March 2020 when the bull market really took off.\n\nIt reached the value of 1.53 in mid-April, reminiscent of June 2019 when the price of Bitcoin made a first bull market high.\n\nThe next one would be the Volume-Weighted Average Price Ratio (VWAPR). The volume-weighted average price is a moving average that considers the trading volume as it divides the price in the trading session with the volume to come up with an average price.\n\nThe chart above shows that every time the Bitcoins price went below the VWAP (red circles), we saw the accumulation zone starting. This is also the case up until June last year. On the other hand, the WWAP ratio fell last June to its significant horizontal levels that have proven to indicate the bottom area.\n\nVWAPR made a higher low, but a higher low was also me in December \u2013 February 2019 compared to February \u2013 August 2015.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere is some on-chain evidence to support the assumption that from June last year, the price of Bitcoin has started its bull market cycle. As we have seen a price increase that recovered it by 100% until April, this rise would be its first impulsive wave.\n\nIn some of our previous analyses, we have pointed out that if Bitcoin started its bull cycle, then we need to see the first major correction establishing the first bull market higher low, similarly to how we say in March 2020 compared to February 2019.\n\nSince we are talking in the macro term, we are still yet to validate this possibility by some near-term price action as there is still a bearish scenario to be invalidated.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin is now the most valuable it\u2019s ever been in Argentina following a crypto-friendly libertarian\u2019s unlikely win in the country\u2019s presidential primaries on Sunday.\n\nAssets dropped in value and the Argentine peso (ARS) dipped, meanwhile, after anti-establishment candidate Javier Milei grabbed the top spot in the South American nation\u2019s election and spooked investors.\n\nBut Bitcoin has held steady and, due to the dipping peso, hit an all-time high of 10.2 million ARS yesterday, according to CoinGecko. It has since dipped to 10.1 million ARS.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe all-time national high comes at a time when the country is suffering from one of the world\u2019s highest levels of inflation, and the peso is rapidly losing value.\n\nDigital assets are popular in the country, though, according to Chainalysis, which last year ranked Argentina as having the tenth highest rate of cryptocurrency adoption anywhere in the world.\n\n\ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udcc8#Bitcoin\u2019s value against the three weakest emerging markets currencies this year - the ARS, TRY and the RUB - has soared between 140% and 240% YTD. \ud83d\udc49Notably, its price in ARS just hit an all-time high! pic.twitter.com/G97nswb22F \u2014 Kaiko (@KaikoData) August 14, 2023\n\nMilei is a 52-year-old shaggy-haired economist with a penchant for rock music and leather jackets. He also has called central banks \u201ca scam\u201d and sung Bitcoin\u2019s praises for its finite supply.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBitcoin is the natural reaction against the scam that are central banks,\u201d he said last year.\n\nMainstream media outlets describe him as a \u201cfar-right populist,\u201d but Argentinans are clearly giving him a chance because the country\u2019s economy is in disarray.\n\nAccording to the central bank, annual inflation in Argentina currently stands at 113%. That\u2019s the highest in the region after Venezuela, and rising prices in Latin America\u2019s third-largest economy have pushed many into poverty.\n\nSocial media-savvy Milei has said he wants to dollarize the economy and wants Argentina to distance itself from communist countries like Venezuela and China.\n\nIf he wins, will he make Argentina into a Bitcoin-friendly economy, too?"

        "title": "Bitcoin flat amid low volatility; NFT transactions soar; Nvidia leads Wall Street rally - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin edged higher on Tuesday morning in Asia but failed to breach the US$29,500 resistance level. Ether also edged up, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded flat to higher. Solana\u2019s SOL led the winners. As risk sentiment improved in the wake of weak U.S. inflation data, last week saw an inflow for digital asset investment products after three consecutive weeks of outflows. Meanwhile, the Forkast 500 NFT index moved up after the NFT market logged the largest weekly total transactions since February 2022. U.S. stock futures traded mixed after Wall Street closed higher Monday on the back of a rally led by chipmaker Nvidia.\n\nA blessing in disguise\n\nBitcoin edged up 0.35% in the last 24 hours to US$29,408.45 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, and logged a weekly gain of 0.91%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency reached a high of US$29,660.25 early Tuesday morning.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price has remained largely within the $29,000 to $30,600 range for the past seven weeks, causing frustration among investors seeking higher rewards. However, low volatility could be a blessing in disguise, Nigel Green, founder and chief executive officer of financial management group deVere, said in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cThis newfound stability attracts institutional investors, who have been historically wary of entering the market due to its extreme price swings,\u201d Green said.\n\n\u201cThis stability is also a boon for businesses and consumers looking for a reliable store of value or medium of exchange,\u201d he added.\n\nMatteo Greco, research analyst at Canada-based digital asset investment firm Fineqia International, said in an emailed note that low volatility does not necessarily mean low investor interest in the coin.\n\nGreco pointed to the Bitcoin long-term holder level \u2014 a metric that measures the percentage of Bitcoin holders who have held the coin for over 155 days \u2014which reached its highest ever level over the first week of August.\n\n\u201cThe data shows how the vast majority of BTC holders did not execute trades in the last few months, as the low volumes and the almost inexistent volatility recorded in the last two months suggest,\u201d said Greco.\n\n\u201cThese numbers are also typical to be observed during the summer months, especially July and August, and do not reflect a decrease in investors\u2019 interest towards the digital asset market,\u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, digital asset investment products saw an inflow of US$29 million in the week ending August 11. That followed three consecutive weeks of outflows totalling around US$144 million, according to a Monday report by European alternative asset manager CoinShares. Bitcoin saw an inflow of US$27 million \u2014 roughly 93% of the total inflows.\n\nThe inflows to digital asset investment products are \u201clikely due to the recent U.S. inflation data, which was slightly below expectations, signifying that a September rate hike is less likely,\u201d CoinShares wrote in the report.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, Ether gained 0.22% to US$1,844.14 and added 1.05% for the past seven days. Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies all traded higher with the exception of Dogecoin, which inched 0.06% lower to US$0.07477 but gained 2.05% for the week.\n\nSolana\u2019s SOL led the winners, rising 3.50% to US$25.17 for a 9.42% weekly gain.\n\nSynesis One, an artificial intelligence (AI) data crowdsourcing platform based on the Solana blockchain, launched its new train-to-earn application \u201cWorkspace by Synesis\u201d on Monday.\n\nThe app allows users to train AIs as data providers while earning cryptocurrencies as rewards. This process, Synesis One claims, will result in a \u201cfully traceable and auditable\u201d data supply chain.\n\nWe are proud to announce the launch of the Synesis One AI data crowdsourcing app on @solana Mainnet! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89https://t.co/L4Bjq5upgT\n\n\n\nMore information in the \ud83e\uddf5below! pic.twitter.com/eyd4wtBHYD \u2014 Synesis One (@synesis_one) August 14, 2023\n\nOutside the top 10 cryptos, HBAR, the utility token of distributed ledger technology platform Hedera Hashgraph, saw its price surge 13.59% in the past 24 hours to US$0.06666. That contributed to a weekly jump of 12.89%.\n\nHBAR received a boost after Dropp, a Hedera-based micropayments application, was added to the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s instant payments platform FedNow. The Fed-run service allows merchants to \u201caccept small-value purchases digitally without paying large transaction fees\u201d following its launch in July.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization moved up 0.40% in the past 24 hours to US$1.17 trillion, while trading volume rose 47.95% to US$28.52 billion.\n\nWeekly NFT transactions hit year-long high\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index moved up 0.39% in the past 24 hours to 2,486.89 as of 09:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, and notched a 0.27% gain for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum and Polygon NFT indexes also logged gains, while the indexes for Solana and Cardano dropped.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume rose 22.88% in the past 24 hours to over US$16.48 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volumes on the Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, and Cardano blockchains all logged gains, while volume on the Bitcoin blockchain dipped.\n\nIn the week ending August 13, NFT sales topped US$101 million after sitting short of US$100 million for three consecutive weeks. Meanwhile, NFT transactions for the week totaled more than 2.80 million, a high not seen since February 2022.\n\nYehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, commenting on the past week\u2019s surge in NFT sales, said that he saw the emergence of low-priced collections as key to a sustained potential uptick in the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting a glimpse of the future of NFTs. More affordable prices, higher volume, likely big brands and this is what we\u2019re seeing in DraftKings, DMarket, Gods Unchained, and Sorare,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nCombined, Petscher noted, those three collections alone notched 872,185 transactions \u2014 nearly a third of the week\u2019s total transactions.\n\n\u201cThe question is, is this sustainable? I think it is, and that\u2019s exactly why this will be the future. Traders haven\u2019t really left NFT, they just ran out of liquidity since there\u2019s no profits. But they can afford NFTs that are priced at just a few dollars,\u201d Petscher added.\n\nAmong NFT collections, Ethereum-based DeGods saw the largest 24-hour sales volume. The collection surged 144.25% to over US$2.21 million after the project launched its \u201cSeason 3\u201d digital art collection on Sunday.\n\nRather than introducing new NFTs, Season 3 allows its holders to upgrade their original DeGods NFT and receive four generative artworks.\n\nMythos Chain-based DMarket and ImmutableX-based Gods Unchained \u2014 two video game-adjacent collections \u2014 came in second and third place in terms of 24-hour sales volume.\n\nMeanwhile, global beverage giant Coca-Cola Company introduced its \u201cMasterpiece\u201d NFT collection on Monday. The collection combines classic and contemporary art pieces with virtual coca-cola bottles, the company said.\n\nCheck out the link below to see the full Masterpiece collection https://t.co/PQoKJCmUWe \u2014 Coca-Cola (@CocaCola) August 13, 2023\n\nThe collection is issued on the Base blockchain, an Ethereum layer-2 network recently launched by crypto exchange Coinbase.\n\nNvidia leads US equities rally\n\nNvidia headquarters in Santa Clara, California|Image: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded higher as of 11:20 a.m. in Hong Kong following gains at the close of trading Monday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the gains with a rise of 0.34%.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes traded mixed on Tuesday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng and South Korea\u2019s Kospi all logged losses, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei moved higher.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker Nvidia Corporation posted a rise of 7.09% on Monday, its highest daily rise since May. That jump followed a note from multinational investment bank Morgan Stanley that described the U.S. tech giant as its \u201ctop pick\u201d amid a \u201cmassive shift in spending towards AI.\u201d\n\nNvidia\u2019s highly anticipated quarterly earnings report is due for release next week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first day in a while that tech has really significantly outperformed,\u201d Jay Hatfield, CEO of U.S.-based investment advisor Infrastructure Capital Advisors, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s indicative of the fact that you have this blockbuster Nvidia report coming up and that could support the tech market pretty substantially,\u201d Hatfield added.\n\nU.S. investors now await the release of retail sales data on Tuesday, followed by the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s July meeting minutes on Wednesday, for further insight on the health of the U.S. economy and the Fed\u2019s future monetary policies.\n\nThe Fed meets on Sep. 19 to make its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest level since January 2001. Analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predict a 88.5% chance there will be no interest rate hike in September.\n\nElsewhere, China\u2019s central bank unexpectedly lowered the rate of its medium-term lending facility (MLF) by 15 basis points to 2.5% on Tuesday, only two months after the previous rate cut in June.\n\n\u201cThe slightly earlier timing and a larger than expected 15 basis point rate cut of MLF show that Beijing feels the urgency to take more policy easing actions to stabilize expectations and growth,\u201d Xiaojia Zhi, chief China economist at international banking group Credit Agricole, told Bloomberg.\n\nZhi added that China could see more monetary easing in the coming months.\n\nThe decision was announced shortly before China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics reported disappointing economic data for July. That data included a rise in the urban unemployment rate, as well as decelerated and smaller-than-expected growth in retail sales and industrial production, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"

(\u201cBitcoin Well\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSXV:BTCW; OTCQB:BCNWF), the non-custodial fintech business which future-proofs money by making bitcoin useful to everyday people, today announced financial and operating results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2023.\n\n\n\nKey highlights\n\nGross profit of $1.2 million for the 3-months ended June 30, 2023 (+13% compared to $1.1 million in the same period in 2022) and $2.3 million for the 6-months ended June 30, 2023 (+15% compared to $2 million in the same period in 2022).\n\nAdjusted EBITDA of negative $0.3 million for the 3-months ended June 30, 2023 (76% improved compared to negative 1.3$ million in 2022) and negative $0.6 million for the 6-months ended June 30, 2023 (79% improved compared to negative $2.8 million in 2022). Improvements to Adjusted EBITDA are a result of significant cost containment in areas across the business, including a significant reduction in the number of full time employees, achieved through efficiencies and automation in many operational processes.\n\nApproximately 6,000 unique users in the Online Portal (3,800 - Q1, 2023) an improvement of 52% compared to Q1 2023. Associated Online Portal monthly revenues exceeded $2 million for the 3-months ended June 30, 2023 ($935,000 - Q1, 2023) an improvement of 113% compared to Q1 2023.\n\n21 new Bitcoin ATMs under operation 12 from a new partner 9 from our existing partners\n\n\n\n\u201cQ2 was a defining quarter for the organization.\u201d said Adam O\u2019Brien, Founder & CEO of the company. \u201cThe growth we are seeing in our Online Portal confirms we are meeting the desire for Canadians to buy bitcoin in a non-custodial platform. This, coupled with our ability to continually grow and find efficiency with our Bitcoin ATMs has me very bullish on the future of our organization.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial overview\n\nFor the three months ended, For the six months ended, June 30, 2023 June 30, 2022 Jun. 30, 2023 Jun. 30, 2022 Revenue 15,112,693 20,586,354 27,529,453 34,115,158 Gross Profit 1,202,286 1,065,759 2,288,040 2,030,549 Adjusted EBITDA1 (332,948 ) (1,342,592 ) (550,328 ) (2,836,187 ) Total comprehensive loss (1,453,259 ) (1,094,724 ) (4,919,187 ) (3,156,057 )\n\n1 See Non-IFRS Measures.\n\nRevenue for the 3-months and 6-months ended June 30, 2023 was $15.1 million and $27.5 million, respectively ($20.6 million and $34.1 million for the 3-months and 6-months ended June 30, 2022, respectively). Despite a decrease in revenue, gross profits have increased by 13% in the 3 and 6-month periods ending June 30, 2023, when compared to the same periods in 2022.\n\nThe improved margins are a direct result of more high-margin ATM sales, when compared to the same period last year. The Company recorded a record number of ATM transactions in May 2023, totalling 4,800, which exceeds the previous record of over 4,400 in April 2023.\n\n\"Late in Q2 2023, we executed additional cost-cutting measures, while yielding improved Gross Profits\" said Luke Thibodeau, CFO \"With steady improvements in operating income over the past 12 months, coupled with the rapid growth of our Online Portal, we've continued to showcase our commitment to the financial success of this business.\"\n\nStock Option Repricing\n\nBitcoin Well also announces, subject to TSX Venture Exchange approval, it is repricing 2,198,245 stock options (\u201cOptions\u201d) held by non-executive employees and consultants. The repricing does not affect the Options\u2019 current vesting schedules and does not extend the term of the Options.

        "title": "What are crypto-backed mortgages, and how do they work? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Crypto-backed mortgages, explained Using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) or other digital assets as collateral to get a standard mortgage loan is known as a crypto-backed mortgage. The idea of using cryptocurrencies as loan collateral surfaced as the cryptocurrency market gained popularity. The extreme volatility and potential for significant value appreciation in the crypto market inspired the notion of leveraging these digital assets to secure conventional loans. In crypto-backed mortgages, the loan amount is based on the cryptocurrency\u2019s value, and the digital assets are kept as security until the loan is paid back. To enable safe and open transactions, these organizations use blockchain technology and smart contracts to facilitate cryptocurrency-collateralized loans, which utilize digital assets as security to obtain loans. When a decentralized lending platform called Salt Lending was introduced in 2018, it became the first notable instance of cryptocurrencies-backed mortgages. Borrowers could use their cryptocurrency holdings as security for loans through Salt lending. Though the idea ran into legal and regulatory issues, the business later altered its offers. Types of crypto-backed mortgages The common type of crypto-backed mortgages include: Purchase mortgages: These mortgages are used for real estate financing and are secured using cryptocurrency as a security by borrowers.\n\nCash-out refinancing: Homeowners with existing mortgages may refinance their properties using their cryptocurrency holdings as security to acquire funds for various uses.\n\nBridge loans: Borrowers use cryptocurrency collateral to secure a short-term bridge loan to cover the gap between buying a new property and selling an existing one.\n\nHow do crypto mortgages work? Crypto mortgages entail utilizing cryptocurrency holdings as security to bind a conventional mortgage or loan. The procedure to obtain a crypto-backed mortgage starts with the borrower giving their cryptocurrency to the lender as security, with the lender calculating the maximum loan amount depending on the value of the collateral. The acceptability of the cryptocurrency is assessed before interest rates, payback terms and term length are decided. The borrower deposits the agreed cryptocurrency sum into the lender\u2019s escrow account once the terms are agreed. In the escrow account, a third party keeps and manages funds, property or documents on behalf of both parties to a transaction until certain criteria are satisfied. This collateral is kept locked up for the duration of the loan, and to control volatility risks, borrowers frequently need to have a specific buffer between the value of the collateral and the loan balance. Payments are typically made in fiat money. After repayment is complete, the borrower receives the collateral back. However, a margin call (demand for additional collateral due to fluctuation in collateral value) might happen if the value of the cryptocurrency falls dramatically, in which case the borrower would have to restore the necessary margin. When referring to loans with cryptocurrency as collateral, a buffer is a predetermined percentage difference between the loan balance and the collateral value (cryptocurrency). For instance, if a borrower\u2019s cryptocurrency collateral is valued at 1 BTC and the lender stipulates a 20% buffer, the borrower needs to provide the collateral equivalent to 1.2 BTC (1 BTC 20% of 1 BTC), effectively creating a buffer against potential volatility risks throughout the loan tenure. This buffer serves as a safety cushion for both the borrower and the lender by preventing changes in the value of the cryptocurrency from instantly resulting in margin calls or the liquidation of collateral.\n\nCrypto-backed mortgage products Crypto-backed mortgage products, such as crypto collateral loans and decentralized finance (DeFi) mortgages, offer cryptocurrency owners an opportunity to access liquidity without selling their digital assets. Examples of crypto-backed mortgage products include: Crypto collateral loans Borrowers use their cryptocurrency holdings as security to obtain a loan. The worth of the collateralized assets establishes the loan\u2019s value. In accordance with the nature of the collateral, certain crypto-backed mortgages permit borrowers to pay back the loan plus interest in cryptocurrency. However, the lender may sell the collateral if the borrower defaults. Stablecoin mortgages Borrowers pledge stablecoins as collateral, which are digital currencies anchored to a stable asset like a fiat currency. This preserves access to funds while reducing the volatility linked to conventional cryptocurrencies. DeFi mortgages DeFi mortgages are issued using blockchain technology and smart contracts. DeFi protocols operate autonomously on the blockchain, enabling trustless borrowing and lending without intermediaries. For instance, platforms like Aave and Compound allow users to pledge their crypto assets as loan collateral. Cross-collateralization To secure a loan, borrowers may utilize a variety of cryptocurrencies as security. Distributing collateral among several assets can offer flexibility and reduce risks. Fractional ownership mortgages Using blockchain technology, borrowers can tokenize their real estate and offer fractional ownership, giving investors a new option to get involved in real estate ventures.\n\nHow to buy a house using crypto-backed loans People who want to buy a house using crypto-backed loans should research lending platforms, choose their collateral, submit loan applications and consider potential legal ramifications. To buy a house using crypto-backed loans, an individual must look into reputable lending companies that provide such mortgages. After deciding on an appropriate platform, the user can choose a cryptocurrency for collateral. The next step is to file a loan application via the platform of choice, including necessary information, such as ownership evidence for the collateral. The lending institution then assesses the collateral\u2019s worth to calculate the practical loan amount. Once the lender approves, the borrower reads and accepts the loan\u2019s terms, which cover items like interest rates, payback terms and collateral requirements. Following acceptance, the borrower receives the loan amount (in fiat money, cryptocurrencies or stablecoins), which can subsequently be used to buy a property. To reduce the risks related to changes in the value of the collateral, it is essential to be diligent in monitoring potential market volatility. Furthermore, to ensure compliance with applicable laws in their area, individuals should also consider the legal and tax implications of using cryptocurrencies for real estate transactions.\n\nCrypto-backed mortgage benefits Crypto-backed loans provide cryptocurrency holders access to assets without selling, avoiding taxes and enabling traditional investments. They also promote financial inclusion and control over exposure to digital assets. Crypto collateralized loans enable cryptocurrency owners to access their digital assets without selling them, potentially saving them from paying capital gains tax. These mortgages also offer a way to get traditional financing, making investing in real estate or other businesses possible. Financing options may be available through cryptocurrency-backed mortgages for those without access to conventional banking institutions, promoting financial inclusion. Borrowers can use these mortgages to control their exposure to cryptocurrencies and possibly hedge against significant price changes. Moreover, borrowers continue to be exposed to possible cryptocurrency value growth while using funds for useful purposes. Additionally, by bridging the traditional financial and digital worlds, these mortgages increase the utility of cryptocurrencies in regular transactions. Cryptocurrency owners can diversify their investment portfolio by securing traditional finance for projects like real estate with their digital assets. Borrowers can utilize their assets directly as collateral instead of selling cryptocurrency on exchanges, avoiding potential trading complexities."

        "title": "Understanding And Preventing Bitcoin-Related Hacks On Instagram - Jumpstart Media",
        "content": "The Instagram Bitcoin hacks serve as a sharp reminder of the constant threat of cyberattacks at a time when our digital lives are entwined with social media platforms.\n\nInstagram, a globally renowned social networking platform, has recently been plagued by a surge of Bitcoin-related hacks. Users are alarmed by unexpected posts and stories showcasing fake Bitcoin transactions, coupled with a sudden influx of spam accounts in their following list. This audacious cyberattack has not only jolted the digital community but also underscored the fragility of our online security.\n\nTherefore, this calls for careful investigation about the kind of hackers your account might become vulnerable to and how to avoid such instances in the future.\n\nWho are these Instagram Bitcoin hackers?\n\nThese cybercriminals range from solitary individuals working from their home computers to sophisticated, globally dispersed organizations. They often employ tactics like phishing, impersonation and even ransom attempts. Once they gain access to an account, they exploit it to promote fraudulent schemes, such as promoting fake investments or advertising sham giveaways.\n\nThese malicious actors leverage Instagram to disseminate deceptive content, aiming to dupe unsuspecting followers into making Bitcoin payments. They don\u2019t discriminate, targeting accounts of celebrities, influencers and even established businesses. The cybersecurity community is working tirelessly to understand the full extent of these breaches and identify the culprits.\n\nThe breach has once again highlighted the cat-and-mouse game between cybercriminals and internet businesses. It has dented Instagram\u2019s reputation, prompting users to question the platform\u2019s commitment to safeguarding their personal information. The ramifications of this breach are expected to resonate across the digital community, raising alarms about the adequacy of current security protocols on social media platforms.\n\nTypes of Instagram Bitcoin attacks on Instagram\n\n1. Phishing attacks\n\nHackers often employ phishing to trick users into revealing personal details, such as login credentials. Typically, these attacks are skillfully concealed to seem like genuine communications from Instagram or another reliable source. Here\u2019s how they orchestrate this deception:\n\nDeceptive links : Users receive links redirecting them to counterfeit Instagram login pages. Unsuspecting victims enter their details, which the hacker then captures.\n\n: Users receive links redirecting them to counterfeit Instagram login pages. Unsuspecting victims enter their details, which the hacker then captures. Misleading emails : Emails masquerading as official Instagram communications might urge users to \u201cverify your account\u201d or \u201cconfirm a password change\u201d. These lead to fake login pages designed to harvest credentials.\n\n: Emails masquerading as official Instagram communications might urge users to \u201cverify your account\u201d or \u201cconfirm a password change\u201d. These lead to fake login pages designed to harvest credentials. Direct messaging: Compromised accounts might send direct messages to followers, offering rewards or alarming users about their photos being misused elsewhere. These messages invariably contain malicious links.\n\n2. Fake profiles\n\nImpersonation scams involve attackers masquerading as someone else, usually reputable people or entities, to defraud victims. On Instagram, this manifests in two primary ways:\n\nFake celebrity profiles : Hackers mimic profiles of celebrities known for their cryptocurrency affiliations. These fake accounts post misleading information about Bitcoin giveaways or investment opportunities to scam followers.\n\n: Hackers mimic profiles of celebrities known for their cryptocurrency affiliations. These fake accounts post misleading information about Bitcoin giveaways or investment opportunities to scam followers. Counterfeit bitcoin companies: These sham profiles imitate legitimate Bitcoin businesses, luring users with false investment opportunities or feigning customer support to extract sensitive data.\n\n3. Cryptojacking\n\nAlthough rare on Instagram, cryptojacking is a menace. It involves hackers exploiting a device\u2019s processing power to mine cryptocurrencies. Here\u2019s how it might occur:\n\nMalicious links: Links embedded in comments or direct messages might redirect users to sites laden with cryptojacking malware. Once clicked, these links can initiate scripts that harness the victim\u2019s device for cryptocurrency mining.\n\nWhile this method might not directly relate to the Instagram Bitcoin hacks, it\u2019s part of a broader trend where hackers exploit the burgeoning interest in cryptocurrencies.\n\n4. Bitcoin ransome attacks\n\nIn these attacks, hackers seize control of an Instagram account, demanding Bitcoin as ransom to restore access. The preference for cryptocurrency as the ransom medium stems from its inherent anonymity; crypto transactions are challenging to trace and irreversible. The modus operandi typically involves:\n\nAccount takeover : Using methods like phishing or brute-force, hackers gain unauthorized access, subsequently changing the account\u2019s password.\n\n: Using methods like phishing or brute-force, hackers gain unauthorized access, subsequently changing the account\u2019s password. Ransom threats: The legitimate account owner receives threats, often via email, of potential account deletion, content alteration or private data exposure unless a Bitcoin ransom is paid.\n\nHow to protect your Instagram account from Bitcoin hackers?\n\n1. Strong and unique passwords\n\nThe cornerstone of digital security is a robust password. Opt for a combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols, ensuring it spans at least 12 characters. Regularly updating your password\u2014every three to six months\u2014can further bolster your account\u2019s defenses. For an added layer of protection, activate two-factor authentication (2FA), which requires a verification code, typically sent to your mobile device, in addition to your password.\n\n2. Be wary of suspicious links\n\nExercise caution with links, especially those received via direct messages (DMs) or comments from unfamiliar sources. Hackers often employ deceptive tactics, camouflaging malicious links to appear genuine. Always verify the authenticity of the sender and be particularly skeptical of links purportedly from Instagram. Avoid shortened URLs, a common tool hackers use to mask harmful destinations.\n\n3. Update your app and device frequently\n\nRegularly updating your app and device is crucial. Developers release updates to patch known vulnerabilities. By keeping your software current, you reduce the risk of hackers exploiting these weak points. In the ever-evolving digital landscape, staying updated ensures you\u2019re protected against emerging threats.\n\n4. Scrutinize third-party access\n\nBefore granting permissions to third-party apps, critically assess their requirements. Ensure the permissions align with the app\u2019s functionality. Be cautious of apps seeking excessive access\u2014they might have ulterior motives. Always verify the credibility of third-party apps, checking user reviews and ratings. Download apps from trusted sources, avoiding sideloading from potentially harmful platforms.\n\n5. Stay informed on cybersecurity news and tips\n\nSubscribing to reputable cybersecurity newsletters and blogs can keep you abreast of the latest threats and protective measures. Engage with esteemed security professionals and organizations on platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn. These experts often share invaluable insights, news and security best practices. Regularly monitor updates and alerts from tech and software providers, implementing fixes promptly to address identified vulnerabilities.\n\nIn closing\n\nSafeguarding your Instagram account from Bitcoin hackers is more than just a precaution\u2014it\u2019s a necessity. By fortifying your defenses, you ensure the privacy of your posts, interactions and personal data. Beyond preserving your online reputation, these measures protect you from potential financial losses and ensure a secure digital experience.\n\nAlso read:\n\nHeader Image Courtesy by Unsplash"

        "title": "What Makes Cryptocurrencies Different? - Liberty Street Economics - Liberty Street Economics -",
        "content": "Anders Brownworth, Jon Durfee, Michael Lee, and Antoine Martin\n\nPermissionless blockchains, which support the most popular cryptocurrency networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum, have shown that it is possible to transfer value without relying on centralized trusted third parties, something that is new and remarkable (although perhaps most clearly useful for less developed financial markets). What makes permissionless blockchains able to transfer value without relying on a small number of trusted third parties is the combination of several components that all need to work together. The components themselves are not particularly new, but the combination of these components is more than the sum of its parts. In this post, we provide a high-level overview of these components and how they interact, taking Bitcoin as an example.\n\nPayments and Trust\n\nPayment systems traditionally operate with a small number of economic agents playing key roles, such as making sure only authorized transactions take place. This requires participants to trust these agents to perform their duties. This trust is bolstered by law, rules, and regulations that provide incentives for the agents playing these central roles not to misbehave. Nevertheless, bad behavior, while rare, cannot be ruled out.\n\nCryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, were designed to operate using a different model of trust, one that does not rely on law and regulations. Instead, they rely on two features, open access and a set of incentives to induce good behavior. Open access, or \u201cpermissionlessness,\u201d is necessary to eliminate the risk that a gatekeeper could exert power to their advantage. Mechanisms that offer incentives aimed at limiting misbehavior by participants in the system are necessary since open access permits anyone to opt into any role in the system. While each feature is important on its own, we argue that the combination of the two is necessary for a permissionless blockchain to work as intended. We now describe each feature in more detail.\n\nOpen Access or Permissionlessness\n\nIn permissionless blockchains, anyone can use the payment system without restrictions. In addition, anyone can choose to take part in any of the roles necessary for the operations of the payment system. If any role that is essential to operations has limited access, then select groups could be positioned to gatekeep those roles and misuse their power.\n\nAn important role in a blockchain is forming new blocks. Miners perform that role in Bitcoin. They validate transactions, for example by checking that the same bitcoin is not spent more than one time and add new blocks of valid transactions to the blockchain. Because of open access, anyone can choose to be a miner and Bitcoin has a large number of them. Validation is an important function in any payment system. If the validator, or validators, cannot be trusted, they could authorize transactions that are not valid or exclude transactions that are, whenever favorable, at the cost of other participants.\n\nPermissionless blockchains are transparent, meaning anyone can observe the ledger, know the state of accounts, and see all transactions. It is necessary that the state of the ledger be visible to everyone, so that anyone who wants to propose a new block can verify that proposed transactions are indeed feasible. Transparency also facilitates the detection of attempts to tamper with the ledger.\n\nIf governance of the blockchain is too centralized, so that a small number of individuals can make decisions that affect the entire system, then the system is more vulnerable. Bitcoin does not have a single owner. Governance is quite open as anyone can propose a change to the core code through a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (known as a BIP). However, implementing changes to the core codebase of Bitcoin is restricted to a small number of developers, who could make changes that favor them. That said, any changes these developers make must be accepted by the miners and other nodes in the system to have influence. In this way, the participants of the network also contribute to deciding what rules are executed.\n\nA Set of Incentives for Good Behavior\n\nIn addition to open access, permissionless blockchains require appropriate economic incentives to make sure all system participants behave in a way that supports the blockchain. In cryptocurrency projects, these incentives are achieved through the issuance and usage of a \u201cbase-layer token,\u201d such as bitcoin (Bitcoin, with an upper case \u2018B\u2019 typically refers to the system while bitcoin, in lower case, refers to the asset).\n\nTo give miners an incentive to attempt to add new blocks to the blockchain, successful miners receive a combination of newly issued bitcoin and fees included by the sender of bitcoins. These rewards give miners the incentive to conduct their work honestly because they only retain value, and thus contribute to profits, if the block is broadly accepted.\n\nAn Alternative Model of Trust\n\nWhile both permissionlessness and economic incentives are important on their own, the interplay of both is necessary to implement a new model of trust. We illustrate the importance of this interplay in the case of Bitcoin miners.\n\nTo minimize the need to trust a single or small set of miners, Bitcoin relies on a consensus algorithm that attempts to distribute block creation. Would-be miners compete to solve a mathematical problem resulting in a solution approximately every ten minutes. Anyone can attempt to solve the problem. This mathematical problem has the property that it can only be solved by trial and error. However, once the solution is found, it is easy for anyone to verify that the solution is indeed correct. The probability of being the first to guess the answer is roughly proportional to the processing power at the disposal of the potential miner.\n\nTo understand why distributing validation reduces the need for centralized trust, imagine that you are concerned that a referee could be corrupt and affect the outcome of a sports match you care about. One way to reduce the potential impact of a corrupt referee would be to have a large group of potential available referees. Every thirty seconds or so, a new referee could be put into the game. The new referee\u2019s officiating is reviewed by the large group of potential referees. If the large group of referees agrees with the officiating, the game continues; if not, the game is restarted at the previous state. With such a process, the impact any given referee can have on the game is very small and, so, the incentive to misbehave is also small.\n\nTo Sum Up\n\nThe key innovation of permissionless blockchains, such as Bitcoin, is not any specific technology. The technological and cryptographic primitives underlying Bitcoin were known for years before the cryptocurrency was created. It is the combination of open access and incentives for good behavior that allows the system to operate with a radically different trust model. This raises important questions for permissioned distributed systems, which rely on a trusted third party. These systems give up on the key innovation of Bitcoin and, so, must bring some other benefit to the table. While a number of benefits has been claimed, such as programmability or the ability to operate twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, year-round, there is little evidence that these benefits are unique to permissioned distributed ledger systems in practice, at least so far.\n\nHow to cite this post:\n\nAnders Brownworth, Jon Durfee, Michael Lee, and Antoine Martin, \u201cWhat Makes Cryptocurrencies Different?,\u201d Federal Reserve Bank of New York Liberty Street Economics, August 16, 2023, https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2023/08/what-makes-cryptocurrencies-different/.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views expressed in this post are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the position of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.

        "content": "The total number of inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain has surpassed 24 million.\n\nBitcoin NFTs were no more in the top five with respect to volume.\n\nOver the past few months, Bitcoin Ordinals witnessed an interplay of highs and lows, marking significant shifts in the ecosystem. At press time, the total inscriptions minted till data had surpassed 24 million.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nBottoms through the peaks\n\nData from Dune Analytics showed that BTC Ordinals crossing the 24 million landmark could be linked to a hike in daily inscriptions. On 14 August, the daily inscriptions minted on the Bitcoin blockchain was 317, 350. This represented the highest number over the last week.\n\nBut before the recent increase, Bitcoin Ordinals witnessed a down season. For instance, on 2, 12, and 22 July, the number of inscriptions stood at an extremely low level and did not edge any closer to the peaks. On 7 and 8 August, the situation continued.\n\nThe decline in the aforementioned times explains how interest in Bitcoin Ordinals subdued. Furthermore, the activity rate was also not as impressive as in the first quarter (Q1). Thus, the decrease meant that users\u2019 creation of Bitcoin-native Digital Artifacts fell.\n\nRecall that Ordinals, put forward by Casy Rodarmor, emerged around the first three months of the year. And despite the controversy around the application on the Bitcoin network, its adoption skyrocketed.\n\nA twist of fate for Ordinals\n\nIntroducing recursive inscriptions to the blockchain significantly impacted the technology. For context, recursive inscriptions are features of the Bitcoin blockchain that allows for the creation of complex data structures that can be stored on the blockchain.\n\nFurthermore, developers noted that they will create a chain of inscriptions with the introduction of recursive inscriptions in July. Additionally, each of these references data was created previously, from existing inscriptions.\n\nAs a result, thousands of recursive inscriptions made it to the Bitcoin blockchain. At the time of writing, assets inscribed in text format topped the inscription created to date.

At press time, Bitcoin had dropped to 7th in terms of the volume registered by each blockchain. The fall reinforced the notion that interest in Bitcoin Ordinals and NFTs at large had reduced."

I am such an idiot Scam victim\n\nSoon afterwards, Austin called to warn your friend her account would collapse if she did not top it up.\n\nAlthough now anxious and suspicious, she sent yet more money, this time to Ibinex, an Estonian crypto website.\n\nIt was only when her funds had been drained that she finally woke up to the full extent of the deceit and reported the fraud, in March, to Revolut.\n\nShe told me: 'I have lost all of our retirement money and my marriage is hanging in the balance. Every penny was worked hard for. There was no inheritance, no windfall. I am such an idiot.'\n\nAlthough she should have spotted the danger signs sooner, I feel very sorry for her. Only those who have been trapped in such a sophisticated web of lies know how convincing such a fraud can be.\n\nI was not satisfied with Revolut's response. Money Mail reported recently that this firm, which offers current account services but is not yet a licenced bank in the UK, has featured in many fraud complaints, with criminals often convincing victims to open a Revolut account.\n\nThis might be because cryptocurrency purchases are permitted via Revolut, when some other banks have either banned or limited the sums that can be spent on the investment.\n\nOn my request, Revolut reopened your case to see if it could have done more to protect you.\n\nIts response was not good news. Although the firm conceded your friend had been duped by 'ruthless and highly sophisticated criminals', it refused to reimburse her losses on the basis that she overrode two warnings.\n\nShe defended her actions, telling me the scammer had convinced her there was not a problem.\n\nStraight to the point I tried to renew my \u00a3160 road tax online but my attempt seemed to be unsuccessful, so I went to the Post Office to pay it in person. It turned out I paid twice but I'm struggling to get a refund. R. S., Vale of Glamorgan. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency investigated and it quickly organised your \u00a3160 refund. *** I Bought a pair of orthopaedic shoes for \u00a325 from Yours Clothing but I haven't received them. Yodel told me that the shoes had been delivered and left by my back fence, but I don't even have a fence. I am an 80-year-old disabled woman. Please help. K. C., Berwickshire. Yodel apologises that your parcel was not delivered safely. Yours Clothing has also refunded you for the missing shoes. *** I booked a villa in Naxos, Greece, for June 2020 via Airbnb and paid a deposit of \u00a31,400. When the pandemic began, I contacted Airbnb but it would not refund me. The villa host said I could come once the pandemic was over, but when I tried to rebook the property it had doubled in price. The host will not refund my deposit. V. C., Warwickshire. Airbnb says you were not eligible for a refund under its Covid-19 policy and the host provided this credit as a goodwill gesture. Your new dates were during peak season, so the price was higher. Hosts set their own prices and cancellation policies, so you are not due a refund.\n\nA Revolut spokesman says: 'We take our responsibility to protect and support our customers extremely seriously and have made significant investments in our systems, processes and people to ensure our customers are safe.'\n\nRevolut states that financial institutions and banks are usually the last link in the chain, and that a fraud has already been committed before they are involved.\n\nThis may be so, but I would argue they are also the last bastion of security for customers and should do more to protect innocent victims \u2014 and if this can't be done, then to reimburse their losses.\n\nI approached Lloyds Bank, where your friend held her current account from where the unusual spending pattern surely must have set off alarm bells. It turned out she had not complained to Lloyds because she had felt it was Revolut's responsibility.\n\nI asked Lloyds to investigate. It took a couple of weeks, but the welcome news came back that it would reimburse your friend almost all her losses: a total of \u00a3179,000.\n\nA Lloyds spokesman says: 'We carefully review the individual details of each case reported to us in line with the industry scam code and do all we can to get back the money that a victim has lost to fraudsters.\n\n'While we did intervene more than once to block payments and warn that she was being scammed, we also appreciate this was a sophisticated fraud and have agreed to refund the vast majority of the money that she lost.'\n\nAll in all, your friend was lucky. Transfers made by bank customers to an account held in another bank in their own name \u2014 known as 'me2me' payments \u2014 are not covered by the Contingent Reimbursement Model Code, the industry arrangement designed to protect victims of authorised push payment fraud.\n\nRevolut is not part of this scheme but says it applies the same standards to its customers \u2014 though it seemingly felt your friend's case did not meet its criteria.\n\nAnyone tempted by an investment ad should make checks first. Always consult the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) register of legitimate firms at fca.org.uk to ensure the operation is regulated in the UK. If your bank issues warnings, then heed them.\n\nMeanwhile, social media companies must do more to banish these wicked ads at source. David Postings, head of UK Finance, recently urged them to step up after the banking body published its annual fraud report revealing that three-quarters of authorised push payment scams begin on social media platforms.\n\nIn it, he says: 'Relying on the banking sector alone to reimburse victims of fraud means the platforms that facilitate the majority of the fraud have no financial incentive to stop it.'\n\nSome relief should soon be at hand from the Online Safety Bill progressing through Parliament, as it will demand social media platforms remove scam ads.\n\nA spokesman for Facebook, says: 'We don't want anyone to fall victim to these criminals which is why our platforms have systems to block scams and financial services advertisers now have to be FCA-authorised to target UK users. We also work with the police to support their investigations and encourage people to report this content when they see it so we can take action.'\n\nA final word of warning. It can be hard to escape once caught in a scammer's web. After your friends' funds were returned, the crooks rang her again, aggressively demanding $54,000. This time she knew what to do \u2014 and slammed down the phone."
