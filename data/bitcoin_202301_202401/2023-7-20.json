        "content": "From the very beginning, observers speculated BITO and other futures-based ETFs would significantly underperform bitcoin due to costs associated with rolling over, or selling expiring futures contracts and buying the next set. Usually, longer-dated futures contracts trade at a premium to those closer to expiry, a condition known as contango. The contango tends to steepen during bull runs, and the steeper the contango, the higher the costs, and the so-called contango bleed."

        "content": "The nature of the charge or charges in the information was not made public. It is common for informations to have fewer charges than those originally lodged against defendants, or to have different ones.\n\nAnother docket entry shows that Lichtenstein and the aspiring rapper Morgan have been ordered to appear in court on Aug. 3 for separate arraignments and plea hearings on the information.\n\nAn information is a type of charging document that federal prosecutors typically use when defendants have agreed to plead guilty.\n\nThe couple, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Rhiannon Morgan, have been newly charged in the case with a document known as an information, according to a new Washington, D.C., federal court docket entry Friday.\n\nThe New York couple charged with trying to launder $4.5 billion in bitcoin stolen in a 2016 hack of Bitfinex appear set to plead guilty in the case.\n\nJudge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly on Friday ordered prosecutors and defense lawyers to provide plea paperwork to her by Thursday, the docket shows.\n\nThat paperwork is to include \"charged offense(s) and statutory provision; charge(s) in plea and statutory provision; elements of the offense; copy of the plea agreement; penalties; and [federal sentencing] guideline calculations.\"\n\nThe couple was originally charged in a criminal complaint when they were arrested in February 2022, and had pleaded not guilty to the charges listed in that document \u2013 money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to defraud the United States.\n\nMorgan, known as \"Razzlekhan,\" is free on a $3 million bond. Lichtenstein, whose nickname is \"Dutch,\" has been held in jail since February 2022 without bond after a judge ruled that the Russian emigre was a flight risk.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, which is prosecuting the couple, declined to comment. Their defense lawyers didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from CNBC.\n\nProsecutors had said weeks after the couple's arrests that they were in plea negotiations with them.\n\nThe couple's case has been repeatedly continued since their arrests. Until Friday's new docket entries, they had been scheduled to appear at a status hearing on Monday. That hearing was vacated as a result of the new charging document being filed.\n\nLichtenstein, 34, and the 32-year-old Morgan are accused of trying to launder the proceeds of 119,754 bitcoin that were stolen from Bitfinex's platform in August 2016. The couple was not charged in the hack of the Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nAt the time of their arrests, the Department of Justice said officials had been able to seize more than 94,000 bitcoin involved in the hack, which at that time of the seizure was worth about $3.6 billion. That was the largest financial seizure in DOJ history.\n\nThe bitcoin stolen in the hack was worth just $70 million at the time of the theft, but soared in value in the following years.\n\n\"Over the last five years, approximately 25,000 of those stolen bitcoin were transferred out of Lichtenstein's wallet via a complicated money laundering process that ended with some of the stolen funds being deposited into financial accounts controlled by Lichtenstein and Morgan,\" the DOJ said at the time of their arrests.\n\nNetflix in early 2022 announced it had commissioned a series on the couple."

        "content": "Last month, BlackRock Inc., the world\u2019s biggest money manager, asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund \u2014 a fund that would invest in the digital currency directly rather than through futures markets. BlackRock joins tens of other smaller ETF providers with the same request, so far without success. But with BlackRock\u2019s heft behind growing demands for a spot Bitcoin fund, it\u2019s only a matter of time before the SEC relents.\n\nAnd it should. A spot ETF would allow investors to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin more easily, cheaply and securely than they can today. In a crypto industry awash with scams, regulatory oversight would also give investors and money managers confidence that they\u2019re buying a bona fide financial product, particularly if it has BlackRock\u2019s name on it."

        "content": "Kuwait\u2019s capital markets regulator banned bitcoin mining this week as they reiterated prohibitions on crypto activities.\n\nThe prohibition came down via an official circular released on Tuesday. Kuwaiti authorities had previously only expressed disapproval of crypto payments.\n\nAs early as 2017, the local regulator had warned banks and other intermediaries that crypto wasn\u2019t legal tender and prohibited institutions from handling digital assets.\n\nKuwait is now reinforcing restrictions on institutions and other payment services touching crypto, but so far it seems to have stopped short of outright criminalizing interactions with crypto for individuals.\n\nStill, regulators stated the use of crypto as a form of payment is strictly prohibited, and residents are advised against engaging in any transactions involving cryptocurrency.\n\nBut until now, the regulatory status of crypto mining had been ambiguous. The recent circular changes that.\n\nKuwait shuns crypto as neighbors open arms\n\nBitcoin mining is a resource-intensive process, requiring specialized equipment and substantial energy consumption \u2014 so low energy costs can greatly impact profitability.\n\nGauging realistic costs of mining bitcoin is difficult. Large-scale operations are often vertically integrated with their own power sources, or have specialized deals for cheaper rates, which can bring down costs.\n\nStill, estimates have previously dubbed Kuwait the most affordable location to mine bitcoin (BTC) worldwide. One roundup suggested the cost of mining in Kuwait was just $1,400 per BTC in 2022 compared to more than $18,000 in Texas (bitcoin was worth more than $40,000 at the time).\n\nLocal reports indicated some crypto miners had exploited Kuwait\u2019s low electricity tariffs by disconnecting home cooling devices in favor of mining rigs to avoid drawing suspicion with high electricity usage.\n\nThe Ministry of Electricity and Water reportedly took measures to curb such practices, including cutting off power supplies.\n\nBitcoin mining aside, Kuwait regulators emphasized that they\u2019re banned from granting licenses to entities for the purpose of offering crypto services as a commercial enterprise.\n\nThe capital markets authority warned that any violation of this regulation would be subject to penalties in accordance with the rules pertaining to money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nIn contrast, neighboring Dubai has taken a more inclusive stance towards crypto, positioning itself as an attractive destination for the digital asset ecosystem.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, Dubai\u2019s \u201ccrypto zone\u201d had already attracted over 500 crypto companies.\n\nMore specific to mining, major outfit Marathon recently pledged to open two facilities in nearby Abu Dhabi.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The CEO and Founder of financial advisory, asset management and fintech organisation deVere Group, Nigel Green, says the price of Bitcoin is set to soar.\n\nThis is based on a belief that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will imminently approve spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nWhy spot ETFs could boost Bitcoin\u2019s value\n\nSpot ETFs allow for investment in underlying assets \u2013 usually stocks or bonds \u2013 at the current market or \u2018spot\u2019 price, replicating a particular asset class or performance by giving investors a portfolio of the actual securities that make up a particular asset class/index.\n\nSimilar to a mutual fund, ETFs differ in that they are bought and sold from other owners on stock exchanges as opposed to purchases from the issuer.\n\nEssentially a way to hedge your investments across multiple companies of a particular industry, the question remains: why could the regulation of spot Bitcoin ETFs boost the cryptocurrency\u2019s value?\n\ndeVere\u2019s Green offers four reasons: \u201cFirst, a Bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly owning or trading the cryptocurrency. Such increased accessibility for both can lead to a larger pool of potential investors entering the market, driving up demand for Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cSecond, the introduction of a Bitcoin ETF will undoubtedly attract institutional investors who have strict regulatory requirements and risk management policies. They\u2019ll bring with them capital, expertise and clout.\n\n\u201cThird, ETFs are traded on established stock exchanges, providing liquidity and ease of trading. This liquidity will attract more traders and increase market efficiency, reducing price volatility. As such, increased liquidity and market efficiency can positively impact the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cAnd fourth, a Bitcoin ETF will generate significant mainstream attention and media coverage which will drive up demand and prices in the crypto market.\u201d\n\nThe path to spot Bitcoin ETF approval\n\nWhile spot Bitcoin ETFs are currently unapproved, the SEC has, for the first time, acknowledged the applications of WisdomTree, VanEck, Invesco, Fidelity, BlackRock and Bitwise, adding the request from regulated spot trading to the Federal Register.\n\nIt is usually a 45-day review process, and application requests can stretch as long as 240 days. So, while ETF traders will be hoping for a quick resolution, the result of these applications may stretch out longer than usual.\n\n\n\nA stretched review for spot Bitcoin ETF regulation may be more likely than in other cases, given the current temperature from crypto trading assets at the SEC, following the Ripple case over its XRP cryptocurrency."

        "content": "Bitcoin fell 4.66% from July 14 to July 21 to US$29,755 at 7:35 p.m. Friday in Hong Kong. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been trading under the US$30,000 mark for most of the week. Ether lost 5.38% over the week to US$1,885.\n\nIn continued institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has accepted eight applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs so far, with the first from BlackRock on July 13 and the second from asset manager Valkyrie on Monday.\n\n\u201cInstitutional interest remains a driving force behind Bitcoin\u2019s stability, as large corporations and financial institutions continue to invest in Bitcoin, while the SEC accepts more Bitcoin ETF filings for review,\u201d Lucas Kiely, chief investment officer of digital asset platform Yield App, told Forkast.\n\n\u201cETFs are set to open up the Bitcoin market, and potentially crypto markets in general, to a large pool of global investors who until this point have not considered buying Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. It\u2019s grown clearer that governments are inclined to regulate rather than ban cryptocurrencies, and the Ripple ruling has provided a sense of relief in the US crypto industry.\u201d\n\nThe SEC\u2019s move to accept the first eight Bitcoin ETF filings for review inspired confidence in other top asset managers, Aziz Kenjaev, financial analyst and director of business development at cross-chain liquidity protocol Entangle, told Forkast,\n\n\u201cInvestors and the crypto-community called this a beginning of a new bullish cycle. The US$30,000 is Bitcoin\u2019s major support, therefore keeping Bitcoin above this level plays a key role for the bullish continuation of Bitcoin. It\u2019s also a psychological level, whereas dropping below this level would trigger a panic sale in the market,\u201d wrote Kenjaev, in a statement shared with Forkast.\n\nIn Europe, French bank Societe Generale on Tuesday obtained a crypto service license in the country that allowed its crypto unit, Forge, to offer crypto sales, custody and trading services.\n\nBitcoin and crypto prices have been more correlated to macroeconomic conditions in 2023, wrote digital asset manager Grayscale Investments in a Friday report.\n\n\u201cSince January, Bitcoin has appreciated more than can be explained by the rally in tech stocks and fall in the US dollar. We think this reflects idiosyncratic positives, including optimism about eventual spot Bitcoin ETF approval, as well as Bitcoin\u2019s surge in March following stress in regional banks,\u201d wrote the report.\n\n\u201cAlthough crypto has healed significantly since late 2022, valuations are now more closely tied to broader macro trends, and more Fed tightening could be a headwind for higher risk assets, including both equities and cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.2 trillion on Friday at 7:35 p.m. in Hong Kong, down 4% from US$1.25 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. With a market cap of US$578 billion, Bitcoin represented 48.3% of the market while Ether, valued at US$226 billion, accounted for 18.9%.\n\nNotable Movers: MKR, XDC\n\nMaker DAO\u2019s (MKR) governance token was this week\u2019s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins, rising 25.83% to US$1,151. The coin started picking up momentum on Friday, hours after crypto intelligence firm Lookonchain shared that a16z deposited 12,864 MKR tokens to Coinbase while CMS Holdings deposited 525 MKR to Binance, presumably selling the coins before the rally.\n\nEnterprise-grade blockchain protocol XDC Network\u2019s (XDC) token was the week\u2019s second-biggest gainer, rising 25.15% to US$0.04187. The coin started picking up momentum yesterday, in anticipation of the protocol\u2019s appearance at the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Paris.\n\nSee related article: USDT\u2019s goal is to be the dollar, not beat it, says Tether CTO\n\nNext week: Fed\u2019s interest rate decision\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s next meeting on monetary policy is scheduled for next Wednesday. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 99.8% chance the Fed will raise interest rates by 25 basis points at the next meeting. U.S. interest rates are currently at 5% to 5.25%, the highest since 2006.\n\nEntangle\u2019s Kenjaev said that a close above last week\u2019s high of US$31,800 will be needed to boost Bitcoin prices.\n\n\u201cThe four-hour Bitcoin chart below clearly shows key levels to watch within this week. The parallel channel of June 30 signals the bearish continuation of Bitcoin for this week\u2019s end. Although Bitcoin was able to jump back into the parallel channel, it has to close above $30,300 and remain above to continue bullish or at least guard itself from a panic sell,\u201d wrote Kenjaev, referencing the below chart.\n\nSee related article: XRP\u2019s partial victory as Russia inches toward CBDC; Arkham draws flak"

Despite the increase, the Forkast SOL NFT Composite fell 0.56% during the day.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales fell for a second consecutive day, declining 21.77% to US$10.26 million, while sales for the largest Ethereum-native NFT collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, rose 10.26% to US$356,746. CryptoPunks sales also fell 76.61% to US$110,440.\n\n\u201cEthereum has managed to cross 10,000 unique buyers, a number it has only fallen below a few times this year,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\n\u201cWith NFTs losing steam it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll see it fall below this threshold soon, especially as NFTs enter the slower time of the NFT market in the second half of the year.\u201d\n\nThe Opepen collection also continued its decline, with 24-hour sales decreasing 55.36% to US$148,191.\n\nAsian equities, most U.S. stock futures fall with investors cautious ahead of interest rate decision\n\nImage: elements.envato\n\nMajor Asian equities fell as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong.

Still, that would result in nearly $30B of incremental demand for a bitcoin ETF,\u201d NYDIG writes.

        "title": "Ben McKenzie needs a hug: The \u2018OC\u2019 star\u2019s crypto book is an ill-informed flop - Fortune",
        "content": "You probably remember Ben McKenzie as the 27-year-old playing a 17-year-old on the early aughts soap opera \u201cThe O.C.\u201d (Just kidding. If you\u2019re reading the Fortune Crypto beat, odds are you were watching Survivor during that time slot.) Anyway, by Ben\u2019s account, during the COVID-19 pandemic he took some bad financial advice from a friend, smoked legal marijuana, and came up with the idea to write a cryptocurrency book called Easy Money as he lost over $200,000 in the market.\n\nLord, grant me this much confidence in the face of failure.\n\nEven without knowing the backstory, the many contradictions and half-baked arguments suggest this book grew out of a stoned idea. McKenzie claims, for instance, that Bitcoin is only owned by a small set of people and repeatedly compares crypto to the most recent banking crisis that devastated the global housing market. He makes an unintentionally credible defense that cryptocurrencies are not securities: \u201cCryptos aren\u2019t tied to anything of real value, unlike shares in a company or a commodities future. They\u2019re computer code uncorrelated with any actual asset.\u201d I couldn\u2019t have put it better myself!\n\nMcKenzie likes to mock online cryptocurrency believers for using the word \u201ccommunity\u201d when they only share a \u201cutopian vision of financial freedom,\u201d but takes great pains to laud his own legitimate \u201ccommunity\u201d of skeptics who have dorm room-style conversations over beers. There\u2019s a constant insistence that cryptocurrencies have no use case while citing capital flight from authoritarian regimes and war-torn regions. McKenzie also can\u2019t seem to decide if FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is a PR genius or a bumbling weirdo.\n\nEasy Money does touch on many valid criticisms of the cryptocurrency industry. McKenzie is correct that the prevailing crypto culture revels in conspiratorial thinking and has more than a tinge of misogyny and anti-semitism. He\u2019s correct to note that many Bitcoin \u201cmaxis\u201d are happy to embrace authoritarians who embrace the token. Likewise, the crypto industry does provide leverage to unsophisticated actors who get fleeced by established traders, while both crypto exchanges and venture capitalists are rife with conflicts of interests. These aren\u2019t novel observations, but they are fair. I wish McKenzie had expanded upon them, rather than rushing to paint everything with vague accusations of fraud. Brief encounters with industry folks later found to be fraudsters\u2014not found by McKenzie, of course\u2014get more airtime than technical explanations that would be more useful to a general audience.\n\nThere are also numerous mischaracterizations within the book that point to either shoddy editing or insufficiencies in McKenzie\u2019s decades-old BA in economics\u2014the poor sheepskin is mentioned so often that it feels like a character in the book\u2014to explain cryptocurrencies. I dispute McKenzie\u2019s basic definition of a cryptocurrency wallet, his confusing characterization of FDIC insurance, his understanding of smart contracts, and his market research on crypto fees. The one section of the book that comes off even less believable than an alleged encounter with drunken CIA officers is his account of a hypothetical Bitcoin OTC trade with a 60% haircut. (Girl, those are 2009 numbers!)\n\nMy real beef, though, is with the bitterness that seeps through the book\u2019s pages. McKenzie\u2019s contempt for anyone sympathetic to the book\u2019s subject matter only serves to clarify why he\u2019s so befuddled by it. To him, no crypto-enthusiast could possibly have a credible intellectual defense for their position, rather they\u2019re just all \u201cboosters\u201d (a potentially interesting historical concept to define, which the author doesn\u2019t) or na\u00effs. Basic terms from economics are defined with snarky graphs, while more sophisticated activities like ETF market-making are characterized in a single line as akin to \u201cplaying video games.\u201d McKenzie mocks emerging markets for their potential to host technical innovation hubs and makes pains to paint \u201cpeople of color\u201d as unsophisticated victims, inexplicably highlighting the ones gifted Bitcoin by Jay-Z.\n\nAnother reason to avoid Easy Money is the final third of the book, which is a wordy report of things like Twitter feuds that took place late last year as the FTX exchange and the TerraLuna \u201cstablecoin\u201d saw their chickens come home to roost. It\u2019s lazy. McKenzie should have tried to coauthor with Dirty Bubble Media, a Twitter account manned by someone with the actual hustle to unearth some of the sinews connecting the cryptocurrency world\u2019s nasty underbelly.\n\nSome people have the chutzpah to call out bullshit when they see it, even at great risk. Others wait 10 months to write a seething account of how \u201caverage Joes\u201d making money convinced them that they should examine the global financial system for the first time. It\u2019s a pity the wrong party wrote this book.\n\nAnd, my goodness, could the timing be worse? McKenzie\u2019s assured claim that most cryptocurrencies are unregistered securities was upended by last week\u2019s court ruling in the case SEC v. Ripple. Meanwhile, the excesses of the last crypto bubble have long since popped and the market seems to be renewing after a period of deleveraging. The time to write a warning or a screed based on the instability of the market was July 2022.\n\nThe next time I see McKenzie and his Emmy-award winning film crew at something like a near empty SXSW panel, I will offer him a hug. The one thing this book convinced me of is that he needs one.\n\nKathleen Breitman is a cofounder of Tezos.

        "title": "Ben McKenzie Exposes Dark Side of Crypto in \"Easy Money\" | TIME - TIME",
        "content": "Ben McKenzie is an unlikely anti-crypto crusader. The actor is best known for his role as a teen heartthrob on The O.C., which is not exactly a harbinger of technological or economic rigor.\n\nBut McKenzie also has an economics Bachelor\u2019s degree from the University of Virginia, and has studied the long history of financial frauds around the world. Based on that foundation of knowledge, McKenzie became obsessed with crypto\u2019s rise in 2021, convinced that it was little more than a house of cards that would inevitably topple.\n\nThat August, McKenzie reached out to the journalist Jacob Silverman and proposed collaborating together on crypto journalism that would expose its potential dangers and seedy underbelly. McKenzie believed he could wield his public profile to add some nuance to a crypto discourse that mostly surfed high on optimism and euphoria.\n\n\u201cI told Jacob: \u2018If I have a superpower, it\u2019s as a mid-level celebrity and econ dork,'\u201d McKenzie recounted in an interview over the phone with TIME. \u201cThose two skills don\u2019t often overlap. But they seemed to be potentially particularly powerful here, because crypto had gathered up so much momentum with the help of lots of people pouring money into it, that it was drowning out other voices. If there\u2019s one thing I felt like I knew how to do, it was to make a little splash\u2014quite frankly because I\u2019m a public person\u2014but also explain economic concepts relatively simply.\u201d\n\nMcKenzie and Silverman co-published several articles together, including in the Washington Post. This week, they released the book Easy Money, a culmination of their reporting which traces crypto\u2019s stunning recent rise and fall. McKenzie interrogated leaders of crypto who have since been arrested\u2014including FTX\u2019s Sam Bankman-Fried and Celsius\u2019s Alex Mashinsky\u2014and traveled to El Salvador to monitor their mostly disastrous Bitcoin experiment. Many crypto enthusiasts argue that the current lull in prices is temporary, and that Bitcoin rises upwards in a cyclical pattern. McKenzie and Silverman, in contrast, make that case that crypto\u2019s downfall last year was inevitable, and that its markets rest on unsustainable economic models. \u201cThe system was so fragile, and based on such faulty economics, that mass liquidations and bank runs and all manner of contagion were practically expected,\u201d they write in the book.\n\nMcKenzie spoke to TIME about Hollywood\u2019s embrace of crypto, his strange encounter with Bankman-Fried and his response to pro-crypto critics of the book.\n\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nHow does crypto\u2019s rise and fall in the last few years mirror a long history of financial bubbles?\n\nThe title of the book is Easy Money. When people can get money easily\u2014either directly, in the case of COVID stimulus payments or in the form of credit\u2014they have incentives to gamble with it. It\u2019s basically free money, so you might as well try to see if you can get a return.\n\nThe line between investing and gambling is quite fuzzy. Some of the things people invest in, or gamble on, are truly innovative technologies that actually do change things. And those people make a lot of money. But some of them are fraud. Charles Kindleberger is an economic historian who studied this extensively.\n\nOnce I understood that essential element\u2014that this followed a long history of bubbles\u2014it made a lot more sense why crypto took off like wildfire in a particular time period: during the easy money time period after the global financial crisis, and then after COVID hit and the government pumped trillions of dollars into the economy. There was just so much money flooding around looking for a home that it was pretty natural that people would gamble with it.\n\nCrypto advocates often argue that crypto will help developing nations. During your reporting, you traveled to El Salvador, the first country to make Bitcoin legal tender. What did you learn about crypto\u2019s impact on the people it was supposed to be helping?\n\nThat was a real eye opener. The pro-crypto argument I was most sympathetic to was that there are other countries where their currencies are much more unstable, and there are people who lack access to banking. Potentially, cryptocurrency could provide a bridge for those people.\n\nBut the things I had been told in the abstract were not true, at least in El Salvador. The day that the law went into effect, the price of Bitcoin crashed 10% in hours. The Chivo wallet system didn\u2019t work: Every citizen was given $30, but a lot of people were immediately defrauded. Someone took a picture of their dog still got $30, so the system was not exactly tightly run.\n\nBy the time I\u2019d gotten there around 9 months later, it was basically being ignored. Less than 2% of remittances were using Chivo wallets, according to their Central Bank\u2019s own figures.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems like crypto was being used as a vehicle of corruption for a quasi-authoritarian state. El Salvador has the highest incarceration rate in the world. And so it\u2019s deeply ironic to me that the only place where this quote-unquote currency\u2014that was supposed to be democratizing and decentralizing\u2014was also a place that was locking people up on meaningless charges. That felt deeply ironic.\n\nRead More: Why El Salvador\u2019s Bukele Is Doubling Down on Bitcoin Despite the Crypto Crash\n\nHaving been part of entertainment industry for so long, why do you think Hollywood was so susceptible to the crypto and NFT boom?\n\nThe easy money was very appealing to Hollywood. Also, crypto is just a story, of how these things are going to do all this amazing stuff they don\u2019t actually do. Where better to sell that story than the land of storytelling, and tell it through the most famous people on earth?\n\nEconomically, it\u2019s a good fit for the parties involved. But it\u2019s not such a good fit for the people that end up buying these worthless links to JPEGs.\n\nYou were able to score a one-on-one interview with FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who has since been criminally charged with fraud among other allegations. In your interview, did you sense an aura or a charisma that Sam seemed to captivate the rest of the world?\n\nI think what Sam did brilliantly was cut against what we think of as the profile of a fraudster. We think of older, tough men who project an aura of uber-confidence and slickness.\n\nSam cut the other way. He\u2019s this kid who always wore a t-shirt and cargo shorts. If you didn\u2019t know who he was, you\u2019d think, \u2018He\u2019s a kid who\u2019s coming in to fix my computer, or like, is hanging out on message boards.\u2019 And so it forces you to go, \u2018Well, he must be brilliant because he clearly doesn\u2019t care about the way he looks. He\u2019s not fitting into some Wall Street stereotype of a really wealthy person.\u2019\n\nBut as soon as we started talking, I found the actual substance of his answers, or lack thereof, really quite shocking. I really had a hard time getting to anything that resembled true conversations of the merits of crypto that he could articulate in a real way.\n\nI asked him, \u2018Show me one company that does anything that\u2019s useful here.\u2019 He initially said remittances, but I had just come back from El Salvador. So I called bull on that. We went around again, and he named Solana. But he happened to own a lot of that currency\u2013and Solana breaks down all the time. He was advocating for it while potentially just pumping his bags.\n\nAnswers like that really left me aghast. It\u2019s one thing for Joe Schmo on the floor of the Miami Bitcoin conference to say stuff like that. But for Sam, it was shocking, because he\u2019s supposedly the titan. I left not knowing what to feel, but feeling very unsettled.\n\nRead More: Where Did FTX\u2019s Missing $8 Billion Go? Crypto Investigators Offer New Clues\n\nJournalists more sympathetic to crypto have unsurprisingly criticized the book in the last few weeks. Brady Dale wrote in an Axios newsletter: \u201cIt\u2019s a book where the two writers knew their conclusion before they did any reporting.\u201d Would you like to respond?\n\nWe knew that it was one of the biggest frauds in history. Then we did 2 years of reporting and found out that was true. If that\u2019s your \u2018gotcha,\u2019 okay. I guess we\u2019re pretty smart, then. We certainly found a lot of fraud.\n\nCoinDesk\u2019s Daniel Kuhn called you a \u201chypocrite\u201d for writing this book after placing a $250,000 bet against crypto, arguing that your crusade against crypto is \u201cessentially the same type of arrangement that McKenzie often criticized others [including Kim Kardashian] for.\u201d\n\nI put my money where my mouth was. I was trying to warn people there was a lot of fraud, and that I suspected it was a bubble. Whether people heard that or not is really not up to me. But I wasn\u2019t out there potentially selling unregistered, unlicensed securities. I was warning people it would go belly up, I thought\u2014and sure enough, it did."

BTC is up 80% in 2023, even after slipping below $30,000 this week.\n\nTeraWulf (WULF) \u2014 which debuted the US\u2019s first nuclear-powered bitcoin mining facility in May \u2014 and Iris Energy (IREN) are respectively up 384% and 466%.\n\nExcluding Core Scientific, a trader who placed equal bets across top bitcoin mining stocks at the start of the year would be up nearly 250%.\n\nInvestments into the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap, meanwhile, would have netted the same individual an average of around 49% over the same period.\n\nEther (ETH) is up 58% and XRP has popped 130%, with markets for the latter reacting positively to a mixed court ruling in a long-running legal dispute.\n\nCoinbase (COIN), the only publicly-listed US crypto exchange, has also tripled this year, having started below $35 to $101 today. That converts to one-third gained over the past year, but it\u2019s still 70% down since its April 2021 direct listing.\n\nBitcoin mining stocks are proving more volatile than bitcoin (chart by David Canellis)\n\nThe world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, named Coinbase as the potential bitcoin custodian in its spot ETF filing last month.\n\nAn average of 22 Wall Street analyst forecasts on Coinbase points to a price target of $68.53, suggesting a 32% fall from its current price, per TipRanks.\n\nPerformance in the fintech payments sector, meanwhile, has been mixed. Block (formerly Square), the firm behind bitcoin-forward Cash App, has seen an 18% increase year to date.\n\nPayPal, which allowed users to buy and sell crypto back in October 2020, is down about 2%.\n\nWhile the corporate earnings season has kicked off across the broader economy in the US, publicly-traded crypto companies are not due to report until later this month.\n\nPositive earnings for crypto stocks this month may act as a catalyst for further growth across digital asset markets, although the same can\u2019t be said for lackluster quarterly reports.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "What is Bitcoin Mining and How Does It Work? - Decrypt",
        "content": "In brief Bitcoin mining is the process of adding and verifying blocks of transactions to Bitcoin\u2019s public blockchain.\n\nBitcoin uses the \u201cproof of work\u201d consensus mechanism, which demands commitment from miners in the form of expensive mining hardware and electricity.\n\nMiners compete to solve a complex cryptographic puzzle, and are rewarded with newly-minted Bitcoin.\n\nYour Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin mining is the process by which blocks of transactions are added to the public blockchain and verified. It\u2019s also the process by which new Bitcoin is created\u2014a mechanism that both secures the integrity of the blockchain and incentivizes participation in the network.\n\nMiners compete to add new blocks to the blockchain. Mining Bitcoin demands a substantial commitment on the part of miners; it\u2019s a costly, time-consuming task, and one that\u2019s necessary for the cryptocurrency to work and for people to have faith in its legitimacy.\n\nOver a decade since Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, most people have heard of mining. But what does it really mean\u2014and how do you go about mining Bitcoin?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat is Bitcoin mining?\n\nMining Bitcoin isn\u2019t like digging for gold or coal deep underground. It refers to verifying the transactions made using Bitcoin. Miners are those individuals or companies that sustain and audit the blockchain network that supports the cryptocurrency.\n\nThey do so by completing \"blocks\" of verified transactions, which are added to the blockchain; when a miner completes a block, they are rewarded with Bitcoin.\n\nDid you know? Approximately every four years, the reward for mining Bitcoin is halved, an event known (unsurprisingly) as the \u201chalving\u201d. In May 2020, the block reward dropped from 12.5 BTC per block to 6.25 BTC.\n\nMining for Bitcoin isn\u2019t as cheap as it once was, but this still doesn\u2019t prevent investors from carrying out this activity. The block reward of Bitcoin is the incentive that powers cryptocurrency transactions through legitimizing and monitoring the network. Because this responsibility is carried out by many users throughout the world, Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency, meaning that it relies on no central authority such as a government or bank for its trustworthiness.\n\nWhy does Bitcoin need miners?\n\nMining is, in effect, a process of auditing and verifying Bitcoin transactions to prevent the problem of \u201cdouble spending\u201d. Double spending is where someone with cryptocurrency tries to spend the same coin twice. With physical currency, you can\u2019t buy a drink in a pub with a \u00a320 note and then pop to the shops to buy some groceries with the same \u00a320 note.\n\nWith cryptocurrency, there is a risk that someone with Bitcoin could make a copy of that Bitcoin and send that to a merchant instead of the real thing. In the real world, the cashier looks at a \u00a320 note to ensure it is not fake\u2014and this is what Bitcoin miners are trying to do with cryptocurrency; they are checking to ensure that a transaction has not been made twice.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat is the process of Bitcoin mining and what can you do with it?\n\nBitcoin uses a consensus mechanism called proof of work.\n\nThe process of mining Bitcoin works as follows:\n\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f A miner\u2019s computer, called a node, collects and packages individual Bitcoin transactions from the last ten minutes into a block.\n\n\ud83d\udda7 This node competes with other nodes in the network to solve a complicated cryptographic problem to be the first to validate the new block for the blockchain.\n\n\ud83d\udce1 The first miner to solve the problem broadcasts their success to the entire network.\n\n\ud83e\uddee Other nodes then check if their solution is correct. If correct, the new block is added to the blockchain and the whole process starts again.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 As the miner was first to solve the problem, it gets rewarded with Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin mining hardware runs a cryptographic hashing function on a block header.\n\nWhat that means is that each miner creates a \u201ccandidate block\u201d with unconfirmed transactions from the node\u2019s memory pool, or mempool. This block includes a block header that summarizes the data inside the block, along with a reference to an existing block in the blockchain and a nonce (\u201cnumber only used once\u201d). In Bitcoin, the nonce is a whole number somewhere between 0 and 4,294,967,296.\n\nThis block header is then put through the SHA256 hash function; if the resulting number is higher than the current target hash, the miner adjusts the nonce and tries again. Miners do this many thousands of times per second. The difficulty target is a 256-bit number; it is adjusted every 2016 blocks (roughly every two weeks), to ensure that a block is mined on average once every 10 minutes.\n\nWhen a lucky miner\u2019s hash function spits out a result that\u2019s lower than the current target hash, the block is broadcast to the network. Each node checks that the block header hashes to meet the target, and if confirmed the newly mined block is added to the blockchain. The miner receives a reward of Bitcoin; this transaction, which creates new Bitcoin out of thin air, is known as the \u201ccoinbase transaction\u201d and is included in the candidate block.\n\nThese rewards serve to incentivize participation and keep things running smoothly.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe rate at which coins are issued is set by the mining code, ensuring that the time it takes for a miner to win a block is always approximately 10 minutes. This is to protect the system and prevent miners from creating their own Bitcoin.\n\nEvery time Bitcoin is mined, the cryptographic problem becomes harder to solve, meaning that miners will require a higher hash rate to succeed in earning block rewards. This means that more computing power is needed to earn the same amount of cryptocurrency.\n\nThe first Bitcoin miners used their computers\u2019 CPUs to complete the cryptographic problems. Soon, miners discovered that graphics processing units (GPUs) were more effective than CPUs, sparking an arms race in mining hardware. Now, Bitcoin miners use dedicated hardware known as ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) miners\u2014though miners of Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies still typically use GPUs, which has led to shortages of graphics cards.\n\nSolving cryptographic problems is necessary to protect the Bitcoin network from attacks. To reverse transactions in the blockchain would require 51% of the whole network\u2019s computing power. This ensures that any attack is difficult and pointless as an attacker would have to own more mining hardware than anyone else.\n\nChina's Bitcoin mining crackdown, and beyond\n\nAs Bitcoin mining has matured, the barrier to entry for individual miners has been raised. Now, most mining is carried out by \u201cpools\u201d of miners who combine their resources and attempt to use their cumulative computing power to earn Bitcoin rewards.\n\nUp until mid-2021, the majority of mining pools were based in China. That changed in May 2021, when China's State Council included Bitcoin mining in a list of financial risks that required monitoring. It marked the start of a sweeping crackdown on crypto mining across China, prompted by the country's commitments to carbon neutrality and the imminent launch of its digital yuan, a central bank digital currency and Bitcoin rival.\n\nA succession of mining bans imposed by provincial governments including Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Yunnan and Sichuan followed, causing a collapse in the Bitcoin mining hash rate. Since then, Chinese miners have relocated to countries including Kazakhstan, while miners in other countries have picked up the slack, with the result that by October 2021, the U.S. had overtaken China as the world's largest market for Bitcoin mining.\n\nMiners are heavily influenced by electricity prices, since proof of work mining uses large quantities of electricity; many miners relocate their operations to make the most of cheap electricity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDid you know? The supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million. When all 21 million BTC are mined, in around 2140, miners will be rewarded with transaction fees.\n\nBitcoin mining has come in for criticism over its high energy consumption, which in 2021 was around 11.8 GW or 103.31 terawatt-hours\u2014more than the output of twelve nuclear power plants.\n\nSome advocates of the cryptocurrency argue that it functions as an \u201cenergy currency\u201d that incentivizes the use of surplus energy; indeed, several power plants in the USA and Iran are now using surplus natural gas to operate large-scale Bitcoin mining operations. Other miners are looking to nuclear power. The government of El Salvador, which made Bitcoin legal tender in 2021, has even started mining Bitcoin using geothermal energy from volcanoes.\n\nFigures for how much of Bitcoin's total energy consumption comes from renewables vary, with estimates ranging from 39% to as much as 75% (though the higher estimates typically come from firms involved in the crypto industry). Bitcoin miners currently generate a carbon footprint equivalent to that of Bangladesh.\n\nStung by this criticism, some cryptocurrencies are switching from a proof of work consensus mechanism to a system known as proof of stake (PoS).\n\nInstead of miners, proof of stake cryptocurrencies have validators. These validators stake their cryptocurrency on betting which blocks will be added next to a chain. If successful, the validators get a block reward in proportion to what they have staked. Ethereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after Bitcoin, is switching to a proof of stake model with its Ethereum 2.0 upgrade.\n\nBitcoin, however, is sticking with the tried-and-true proof of work consensus model espoused by Satoshi Nakamoto in the original Bitcoin whitepaper, over a decade ago."

        "content": "Bitcoin fell on Friday morning in Asia as other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. Bitcoin again slipped below support at US$30,000 after a week that saw buyers retreat. Developments in applications for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) failed to generate fresh investment, though some commentators say the pent up demand is there. Ether traded flat and is also a loser for the week. Matic led the early gainers on Friday, but is also in the red for the week.\n\nBitcoin backs off\n\nBitcoin fell 0.18% to US$29,824.09 as of 6:40 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency has lost 4.53% in the past seven days.\n\nThe drop came amid further developments in Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications by U.S. asset managers.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF applications from BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, VanEck, and WisdomTree on July 19 were published in the Federal Register, which means the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) now has up to 240 days to accept or request the applications, according to Bloomberg.\n\nBloomberg research analyst James Seyffart wrote on Twitter that while this sets the clock ticking, the SEC may still reject all the applications.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, filed its spot Bitcoin ETF application on June 15, sparking a round of buying of cryptocurrencies on expectations more institutional funds will start investing in the asset class.\n\nWhile that enthusiasm has faded, Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at London-based brokerage firm FxPro said latent demand for cryptocurrencies remains, although \u201cthe momentum is far from euphoric.\u201d Kuptsikevich added that Bitcoin continued to find support this week on dips below $30,000. \u201cA move to the upper boundary at $31,300 is most likely in this environment,\u201d he said.\n\nAsia Pacific institutional investors \u201cremain constructive across the digital asset complex following last week\u2019s positive news on [ETFs],\u201d said Matt Long, the APAC general manager of California-based international crypto brokerage FalconX. \u201cThey are well positioned for further appreciation in markets,\u201d said Long in an emailed statement to Forkast.\n\nU.S.-based digital asset manager Grayscale Investments said in a Friday report that about half of Bitcoin\u2019s 80% increase from December to mid-July relates to macro developments, while the rest is due to Bitcoin-specific positives.\n\n\u201cCrypto no longer behaves as its own ecosystem: Bitcoin and other digital assets are now more correlated with other market indicators,\u201d according to the report.\n\n\u201cSince January 2023, Bitcoin has appreciated more than can be explained by the rally in tech stocks and fall in the US Dollar. We think this reflects idiosyncratic positives, including optimism about eventual spot Bitcoin ETF approval, as well as Bitcoin\u2019s surge in March following stress in regional banks,\u201d Grayscale said.\n\n\u201cValuations are now more closely tied to broader macro trends, and more Fed tightening could be a headwind for higher risk assets, including both equities and cryptocurrencies,\u201d the report said.\n\nBack in Asia Friday morning trading, Ether edged up 0.31% to US$1,895.14, while falling 4.70% in the last week.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were mixed \u2014 Polygon\u2019s Matic led gainers, rising 3.42% to US$0.7711. However, it posted a weekly loss of 8.46%.\n\nPolygon Labs is currently working on developing Polygon 2.0, a series of updates to the blockchain that the company says aim to make network governance more open and inclusive.\n\nSolana was the biggest loser among the top 10, declining 3.53% to US$25.49, amid a 0.72% weekly loss.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization edged down 0.15% in the past 24 hours to US$1.2 trillion, while trading volume jumped 19.19% to US$37.15 billion.\n\nNFTs fall; OpenSea launches swap feature\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.56% in the past 24 hours to 2,696.41 as of 08:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index gained a flat 0.01% in the last seven days.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume rose 1.62% to US$18.69 million in the past 24 hours, according to data from CryptoSlam. Forkast NFT market indexes measuring performance on the Ethereum, Polygon and Solana blockchains all dropped, while the Cardano index rose.\n\nOn Thursday, NFT marketplace OpenSea announced that it is launching \u201cDeals,\u201d a new peer-to-peer NFT swap function. The company said in a tweet that this will help users avoid falling victim to \u201csketchy DMs & websites\u201d as OpenSea will provide the platform for users to directly engage with each other.\n\nYehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, says this feature is \u201cmore significant than people may realize.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the primary ways people are scammed in the NFT space is through fake trades. Often, legitimate trade sites are spoofed, and then trades offered through there,\u201d said Petscher. \u201cNow collectors will be able to trade using a platform they\u2019re already familiar with and trust, and the best part is there are no fees involved other than gas.\u201d\n\nCurrently, OpenSea allows only ERC-721 NFTs on Ethereum from verified collections to be traded on Deals. To make a \u201cdeal,\u201d a user can offer one or more NFTs in return for another user\u2019s NFTs, where one can also choose to add wrapped Ether (WETF) as part of the offer. The user accepting the deal will have to pay gas fees, according to OpenSea.\n\n\u201cEasy to use, and hopefully will have a major impact on lowering scams. This was long overdue.\u201d Petscher said.\n\nElsewhere, Yuga Labs\u2019 Bored Ape Yacht Club topped CryptoSlam\u2019s NFT collection ranking by trading volume, rising 3.80% in the last day to US$1.4 million.\n\nEthereum was the top performing blockchain network by NFT trade volume, gaining 5.63% to US$13.73 million. Solana placed second, up 4.41% to US$1 million.\n\nU.S. equity futures gain after mixed session\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell | Image: Getty Images\n\nThe three major U.S. stock futures indexes gained as of 11:10 a.m. in Hong Kong on Friday, after equities had a mixed regular trading session on Thursday.\n\nThe Dow Jones gained on top of strong Q2 earnings reports from Johnson & Johnson and Goldman Sachs. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 slipped as Tesla tumbled on weak second-quarter gross margins and Netflix reported less-than-expected revenue.\n\nIn Asia, China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index gained, partially recovering from disappointing economic growth data for Q2. Investors are betting on Beijing to step up its economic stimulus measures, according to Trading Economics. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index also rose on China news of authorities possibly easing home buying limits in big cities.\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 dipped after its inflation rate rose slightly in June. South Korea\u2019s Kospi also slipped.\n\nOn macro events, the next U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meeting is next week on July 26 when the central bank will make its next move on U.S. interest rates. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 99.8% chance that the Fed will announce a further 25 basis points raise that will take rates to the 5.25%-5.50% range, which will be the highest since January 2001.\n\n(Updates to add equity section)"

        "content": "Scott Melker is the host of The Wolf Of All Streets Podcast and author of The Wolf Den newsletter.\n\n\u201cIf I tweeted about a small cap [crypto] of some sort right now, the price would probably change by like 50%,\u201d says Scott Melker, better known to his 904,800 Twitter followers as The Wolf Of All Streets.\n\nMelker says he takes this responsibility seriously and won\u2019t share tweets that might \u201cimpact the market\u201d \u2013 but this makes Twitter \u201ca lot more boring\u201d from his end. In fact, Melker declares that Twitter \u201cstopped being fun\u201d when he reached 100,000 followers.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I went through a phase of a real love-hate relationship with Twitter because that\u2019s when I guess 10% of the people who respond to comments were trolling at any given time.\u201d\n\nAll you can really post to 900,000 followers is \u201cBitcoin and inspirational quotes\u201d because \u201ceverything else\u201d will land you in hot water.\n\nAfter graduating from Penn State University with an Anthropology degree in 1999, Melker tried his hand at a \u201cmillion\u201d other things \u2014 finding the most success in his 20-year stint as a DJ.\n\nShortly after finishing university, he also started his own magazine in Philadelphia called 101 Magazine, focusing on street culture and city vibes.\n\nIt caught the attention of a \u201chuge\u201d magazine called Frank 151, which acquired it, and Melker became the editor-in-chief of both.\n\nDuring that time, he had the opportunity to attend \u201cinsane\u201d parties and rub shoulders with legendary acts like the Wu-Tang Clan and Outcast.\n\nThe music industry led him to try crypto trading in the first place.\n\n\u201cI just happened to look into crypto because there was a bunch of DJs trading it,\u201d he says.\n\nHe first started trading on the Gemini crypto exchange in 2016 and recalls buying Bitcoin to send it to another exchange, Bittrex, so he \u201ccould buy Ethereum and Ripple.\u201d ETH was \u201cunder 20 bucks\u201d back then, he notes in a cheeky humble brag.\n\nRather than some lofty higher purpose, he says the main attraction was making cold hard cash.\n\n\u201cI was really just trading, trying to make money to support a new family; it had nothing to do with what Bitcoin was or what the asset class was.\u201d\n\nWhat led to Twitter fame?\n\nMelker initially started stacking up followers when he was \u201ctrading the market well\u201d and posting about it on Twitter. At that point in time, his content was \u201c100% charts and trades.\u201d\n\nHowever, Melker didn\u2019t want his account to be based on trades because it\u2019s \u201cfickle.\u201d\n\nSo, he transitioned toward a more holistic approach to his content within the crypto industry.\n\n\u201cI would love to tell you there was some strategy that I took to grow my account, but it was always just me doing whatever I enjoyed doing the most at any given time.\u201d\n\nMelker has observed a direct correlation between his follower growth and the performance of the crypto market.\n\nDuring previous bull markets, he has experienced an insane influx of daily followers.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when I was getting a hundred thousand [followers] in two months,\u201d he says.\n\nMelker used to \u201cliterally respond to everybody\u201d who commented on his tweets or messaged him, but that ship has now sailed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s like a full-time job, and then you just get to the point where you literally can\u2019t open all your DMs anymore,\u201d he says.\n\nBut it\u2019s best not to refer to him as an \u201cinfluencer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate the term influencer because, to me, I\u2019m just a student of crypto, and it\u2019s something I\u2019m passionate about and want to learn more about.\u201d\n\nWhat type of content do you do?\n\nMelker\u2019s content revolves around crypto news and keeping people up-to-date with what\u2019s happening in the market.\n\nHe likes to share his take on what\u2019s important, and \u201cwhat\u2019s kind of noise and not signal.\u201d\n\n\u201c[My content includes] all the lessons that I\u2019ve learned in my streams and podcasts, but I would say it\u2019s generally educational/informational content about this market.\u201d\n\nMelker emphasizes the overwhelming pressure he faces whenever he decides to \u201cfire off a tweet,\u201d considering how many followers he has amassed on Twitter.\n\n\u201cTwitter is like a movie where you throw a grenade in a room and walk away, and there\u2019s a huge explosion behind you. That\u2019s how I feel every time I send a tweet now,\u201d Melker says.\n\nExtreme beef: Gary Gensler\n\nMelker is not a fan of United States Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler.\n\nHe admits that his Twitter is filled with many \u201cangry tweets against Gensler.\u201d\n\n\u201cI literally contributed to aggressively getting #firegarygensler trending on Twitter,\u201d he declares.\n\nHe explains that his problem with Gensler is his recent regulatory actions, which he perceives as a \u201cmassive overcorrection\u201d targeting crypto firms.\n\nHe believes that it stems from a sense of embarrassment over the fact Gensler was meeting with Sam Bankman-Fried before the collapse of FTX and didn\u2019t realize \u201che was a fraud.\u201d\n\nSpicy beef: ZachXBT\n\nZachXBT, a pseudonymous on-chain researcher, accused Melker of pumping and dumping shit coins to his followers in 2021. It was a troubling time for Melker, who received threats and became the target of white-hot anger.\n\nMelker vehemently refuted the claims and announced he would steer clear of tweeting about projects with small market caps altogether.\n\nMelker says he doesn\u2019t want his audience to get the wrong idea and prefers to focus on the educational stuff. He reiterates that he \u201cwas passionate\u201d about trading altcoins, but says it can be difficult to navigate the boundaries of what you should and shouldn\u2019t talk about as your following grows.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t just show up with 900,000 followers one day and understand what you can and cannot tweet about.\u201d\n\nPrice predictions?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that makes you look dumber than a price prediction,\u201d Melker states. He should know, given he took an optimistic swing at predicting Ethereum would hit five figures in 2021.\n\nI think $ETH will hit 5 figures this year. \u2014 The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) February 15, 2021\n\nHowever, he is bullish on Bitcoin hitting six figures in the next bull run.\n\n\u201cI think the next cycle would be somewhere between 100 (thousand) and 250 (thousand),\u201d he declares.\n\nBut Melker believes that after that, the market will see another huge decline before it hits half a million.\n\n\u201cThen we drop down to 60 (thousand), and it\u2019s boring forever. Then, we pop up to half a million, like we continue these four-year cycles.\u201d\n\nHowever, Melker doesn\u2019t want \u201cto live in a world where Bitcoin is a million dollars.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe faster it happens, the worse the world is,\u201d Melker says.\n\n\u201cBecause if Bitcoin goes to a million dollars. It means that everything else has exploded, including the United States dollar, and we\u2019re living in some Mad Max dystopian future.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere you and I are those guys without faces painted going to gas town, fighting off the enemies,\u201d he describes, referring to the 2015 movie Mad Max: Fury Road.\n\nBut maybe in a couple of decades.\n\n\u201cI would like to see Bitcoin at a million dollars in 20 years, following reasonable cycles,\u201d he adds."

        "title": "Bitcoin no longer asset of choice for criminals \u2014 former Elliptic crypto advisor - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Crime in Web3 is shifting away from Bitcoin (BTC) to stablecoins, and Ponzi schemes remain prevalent, according to Elliptic\u2019s former head of technical crypto advisory.\n\nTara Annison shared the latest insights from the murky world of cryptocurrency-related crime during a presentation on the final day of EthCC in Paris, addressing a wide variety of ways digital assets are either facilitating crime or being used to launder funds.\n\nThe presentation drew Web3 crime insights from Elliptic, Chainalysis and TRM Labs, with Annison talking in her capacity as a former employee of Elliptic having recently left the firm.\n\nAccording to Annison, Bitcoin is no longer the cryptocurrency of choice for illicit activities or laundering money. As the cryptocurrency industry has matured, the establishment of decentralized finance protocols, mixing services and stablecoins present new avenues for criminals to explore.\n\nSlide from Annison\u2019s presentation. Source: Tara Annison.\n\nCriminals have shifted toward using dollar-denominated assets, like USD Coin (USDC), with their easy accessibility and ability to be laundered through decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n\n\u201cThe criminals use that as a target point. It\u2019s also super easy to launder through DEXs. There\u2019s deep liquidity, really good volume, so that\u2019s pretty worrying.\u201d\n\nAnnison highlighted a potential silver lining from a law enforcement perspective, noting that centralized issuers like Circle could freeze specific USDC tokens before criminals can \u201coff-ramp out of the asset\u201d into fiat through DEXs or centralized exchanges.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is an increased number of accounts with USDC and USDT being blacklisted, and these are frozen funds that the criminals now can\u2019t access.\u201d\n\nPonzi and pyramid schemes remain a feature of the sector, with Annison noting that $7.8 billion was stolen from unwitting victims of these types of scams.\n\nRelated: How the IRS seized $10B worth of crypto using blockchain analytics\n\nCriminals are finding more sophisticated ways to launder funds. Annison said chain swapping and asset swapping are prevalent as criminals try to hide illicit activity.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that to the tune of about $4.1 billion. So they hop across using a DEX. They use a coin swap service, they use a mixer, they use a bridge, all basically to try and throw blockchain analytics firms off the trail.\u201d\n\nAnnison said that $1.2 billion stolen from DEXs eventually ends up on centralized exchanges. In comparison with previous years, scams in the sector are down 46%. The reason, according to Annison, is the ongoing bear market, which has inevitably made the sector less appealing for cybercriminals.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re less hyped up, the prices are lower, so it\u2019s not as profitable for criminals. So at least next time we\u2019re in a bear market, do bear in mind that the scams are at least down.\u201d\n\nAnnison also touched on the increasing use of cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions and finance terrorist activities, highlighting TRON (TRX) and Tether (USDT) as popular assets for illicit use.\n\nThe advent of metaverse experiences has also seen the space attract nefarious actors. Various crimes are emerging in virtual worlds, including phishing attacks, nonfungible token theft, wallet tainting and augmented reality hacks.\n\nAnnison\u2019s presentation highlighted the reality of criminal activity in the sector, which will demand increased security measures to protect users and combat illicit activities.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: US enforcement agencies are turning up the heat on crypto-related crime"

The couple were arrested in February 2022, but requested delays in their case to facilitate plea discussions, which could indicate they are cooperating with authorities."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether trade flat as buzz around Bitcoin ETFs and Ripple court ruling fade - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin edged higher in Thursday morning trading in Asia, along with most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, but the token has lost much of its support at the US$30,000 line. Investors said buying enthusiasm for Bitcoin has faded after recent gains sparked by exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications and Ripple\u2019s favorable court ruling in the case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Ether fell back.\n\nBitcoin flatlines\n\nBitcoin rose 0.44% to US$29,919.68 as of 6:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency fluctuated around the US$30,000 support price earlier in the morning, but is now down 1.45% in the past seven days.\n\n\u201cCrypto has been relatively flat following a stream of good news,\u201d Nick Ruck, the chief operating officer of Singapore-based blockchain infrastructure platform ContentFi Labs, said in emailed comments. \u201cThe Bitcoin ETF news has been priced in and the market is waiting to see the financial products in action.\u201d\n\nThe world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock and several other U.S. financial institutions started filing applications for Spot Bitcoin ETFs from mid-June, helping move Bitcoin\u2019s price north of US$31,500 at one stage last week.\n\nRuck added that the U.S. court ruling last week in favor of Ripple Labs and its XRP token also helped drive the price gains, but the case isn\u2019t the end of the regulatory war since the SEC can appeal the case to a higher court.\n\n\u201cThis case also didn\u2019t finalize whether XRP and other tokens are securities, but instead added more regulatory confusion on how and when a token can be considered a security in some cases but not others,\u201d said Ruck.\n\nAdrian Wang, the chief executive officer of Hong Kong-based digital asset manager Metalpha, agreed the optimism around XRP and ETFs looked to have run out of steam. He added in emailed comments that XRP had only a partial victory as the district court said \u201cinstitutional sales of the tokens violated federal securities laws.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Ripple was the biggest gainer among the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies Thursday morning. The token jumped 8.02% to US$0.8275 and added to a weekly surge of 75.85%.\n\nOther gainers included Cardano, which added 5.81% to US$0.3224 and is up 12.04% for the week. Solana rose 4.67% to US$26.53 for a weekly gain of 20.62%.\n\nOn Wednesday, Solana Labs, the blockchain infrastructure developer behind the token of the same name, introduced a new developer tool named Solang that it said will make smart contracts on the blockchain more accessible.\n\nEther was the main loser in early Asia trading, with the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization slipping 0.37% to US$1,892.30. However, it is still up 1.17% in the last week and has gained 57% for the year to date.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization edged up 0.01% in the past 24 hours to US$1.2 trillion, with trading volume dipped 3.50% to US$31.11 billion.\n\nNFTs trade thin, but expansion into art world continues\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.25% in the past 24 hours to 2,710.26 as of 08:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index rose 0.47% in the last seven days.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume fell 16.91% to US$15.87 million in the past 24 hours, according to data from CryptoSlam. Forkast NFT market indexes measuring performance on the Ethereum, Polygon and Solana blockchains all dropped, while the Cardano index rose.\n\n\u201cSales are very slow across all blockchains, which allows for newer mints like Garbage Bags to enter the top 10 collection rankings with just over US$200,000 in sales,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain-based Garbage Bags placed seventh on CryptoSlam\u2019s NFT collection ranking by trading volume, rising 19.75% to US$281,775. The NFT collection was first minted on July 17, with a supply of 6,500 NFTs.\n\nThe @garbagefriends mint will take place today \ud83d\udcc5 \ud835\udfed\ud835\udfec \ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde0 \ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde7\n\n\n\nHere is quick review and what you need to know about it \ud83e\uddf5\ud83d\udc47\n\n\n\n(1/20) pic.twitter.com/7tV5m2mHwk \u2014 Jereziz (@jerezizzz) July 17, 2023\n\nAzuki performed best in terms of sales volume on Thursday, surging 92.06% to US$826,007. ImmutableX\u2019s trading card game NFT collection Gods Unchained placed second with US$679,479.\n\nTotal trading volume on Ethereum, the largest NFT network, dropped 22.08% to US$10.52 million, with 12,244 buyers.\n\n\u201cEthereum has managed to cross 10k unique buyers, a number it has only fallen below a few times this year,\u201d commented Forkast Labs\u2019 Petscher. However, there is now a sense that the 10,000 unique buyer threshold could soon be under threat.\n\n\u201cWith NFTs losing steam it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll see it fall below this threshold soon, especially as NFTs enter the slower time of the NFT market in the second half of the year,\u201d Petscher added.\n\nTrading volume on the Bitcoin network also fell 8.14% to a thin trade of US$1.12 million. That figure is less than half the sales volume recorded on the network at the beginning of this month.\n\nDespite the general decline in market activity, NFTs continue to make an impact in the art world. New York\u2019s Jackson Pollock Studio released an art collection on Wednesday that includes both NFTs and physical prints of the late painter\u2019s abstract expressionist work.\n\nNamed \u201cBeyond the Edge,\u201d the 500 Ethereum-based NFT artworks were released in collaboration with digital art platform Iconic Moments.\n\nPublic mint is live for The Jackson Pollock Studio Collection.\n\n\n\nMint: https://t.co/tIrYx4wJOq pic.twitter.com/zUw65k8WES \u2014 Iconic (@Iconic_NFT) July 19, 2023\n\nElsewhere, at Wednesday\u2019s Art+Tech Summit held in New York\u2019s Christie\u2019s modern art museum, a group of digital art experts gathered for a panel discussion titled \u201cAI, Digital Assets and the Future of Museums and Galleries.\u201d\n\nOne theme central to the discussion was the use of blockchain technologies including NFTs as a way of making art institutions more accessible to audiences.\n\nSpeaking during the panel, Miami Institute of Contemporary Art\u2019s Anthony Troisi said that the decentralized nature of NFT art offers vast possibilities for institutions, and that they are now \u201cjust scratching the surface\u201d in the exploration of the technology \u2014 a potentially positive omen for the future of the wider NFT market.\n\nU.S. equity futures fall as heavyweights post mixed Q2 earnings\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s regular trading session, the Dow Jones and S&P 500 gained while the Nasdaq index dipped. The three major U.S. stock futures indexes dropped as of 11:20 a.m. in Hong Kong on Thursday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq declining the most at 0.50%.\n\nTesla shares dropped despite reporting record-high quarterly revenue in Wednesday\u2019s Q2 earnings call, as lower operating margins outweighed concern for investors. Elsewhere, stocks in Netflix plunged as the streaming giant posted lower-than-expected revenue.\n\nGoldman Sachs also reported missed estimates in its earnings report. The report revealed a 60% drop in profits during the second quarter due to write-downs in consumer business and real estate. However, with shares rising 2%, the firm\u2019s CEO David Solomon nonetheless anticipates an imminent recovery in the investment banking sector.\n\nReuters reports that Solomon told a group of analysts via a conference call that he had noticed an increasing sense of positivity over the past six to eight weeks. \u201cThe inflation data\u2019s been better, the client sentiment is better, and now we\u2019ll have to watch and see,\u201d he said.\n\nGlobal information technology conglomerate IBM reported mixed results in the second quarter. While earnings exceeded expectations, revenue fell short.\n\nInvestors now await more earnings reports on Thursday from U.S. heavyweights including Johnson & Johnson, Philip Morris, Lenovo Group and American Airlines.\n\nThe main stock markets in Asia were mixed. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 fell, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index jumped back up from a two-day decline. South Korea\u2019s Kospi index also edged upward.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve is holding its next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on July 26. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 99.8% chance that the Fed will use the meeting to announce a further 25 basis points raise that will take the interest rate to the 5.25%-5.50% range.\n\n(Updates to add equity section)"

        "title": "'Bitcoin Bonnie & Clyde' to plead guilty for alleged $4.5B cryptocurrency laundering scheme - New York Post",
        "content": "Crypto heist couple Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan \u2014 who were charged with laundering $4.5 billion in hacked Bitcoin in 2016 \u2014 are reportedly preparing to plead guilty ahead of their next scheduled court appearance on Aug. 3.\n\nThe so-called \u201cBitcoin Bonnie & Clyde\u201d have been newly charged in the case with a document known as an information, which lays out criminal charges and is similar to an indictment, but which doesn\u2019t require a grand jury\u2019s vote, a Washington, D.C., federal court document filed Friday showed.\n\nFederal prosecutors have been known to use the special documents when defendants agree to plead guilty.\n\nRussian-born Lichtenstein, 34, and his wife Morgan, 32, previously pleaded not guilty in a February 2022 case that charged them of money laundering and conspiracy to defraud in the United States.\n\nThe pair were arrested at their Manhattan apartment earlier that month for allegedly attempting to launder an astounding $4.5 billion in cryptocurrency that had been stolen from Hong Kong\u2019s Bitfinex, one of the world\u2019s largest virtual cryptocurrency exchanges, in 2016.\n\n3 A new court filing hints that Ilya Lichtenstein (right) and Heather Morgan (left), who were charged with laundering $4.5 billion in hacked bitcoin back in 2016, appear to be gearing up to plead guilty. Alexandria Adult Detention Center\n\nFederal authorities accused the couple of trying to launder 119,754 bitcoin. At the time of the theft, the crypto amounted to about $70 million.\n\nHowever, at the time of their arrest, the price inflated into the billions. Today, 119,754 bitcoin is worth nearly $3.6 billion.\n\nLichtenstein \u2014 a Russian emigre known as \u201cDutch\u201d \u2014 was not granted bail, and has been in a Washington, D.C., jail since his arrest after being billed a flight risk.\n\nMorgan \u2014 better known as the questionably talented rapper \u201cRazzlekhan\u201d who shares songs about being \u201cthe crocodile of Wall Street\u201d \u2014 is free on a $3 million bond pending the outcome of negotiations.\n\nThe nature of the charges stated in the document are confidential, though the court docket showed that District of Columbia Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly ordered the couple\u2019s defense to provide plea paperwork by Friday.\n\nJudge Kollar-Kotelly said the defendants\u2019 paperwork must include \u201ccharged offense(s) and statutory provision; charge(s) in plea and statutory provision; elements of the offense; copy of the plea agreement; penalties; and [federal sentencing] guideline calculations,\u201d according to the docket.\n\n3 Russian-born Lichtenstein, 34, and his wife Morgan, 32, previously pleaded not guilty in a February 2022 case that charged them of money laundering and conspiracy to defraud in the United States. Instagram/heatherreyhan\n\nThe Post has reached out to Lichtenstein\u2019s counsel at Cahill Gordon & Reindell, as well as Morgan\u2019s legal team at Burnham & Gorokhov.\n\nIf found guilty, Lichtenstein and Morgan could face up to 25 years years behind bars. It\u2019s unclear how a plea deal could affect their sentence.\n\nMorgan has been spending her 24-hour house arrest holed up in the rented Wall Street high-rise she once shared with her husband.\n\nThe downtime had Morgan looking for remote work. In September, she tweeted saying: \u201cLooking for remote B2B growth /marketing /sales /copywriting /demand gen work. Can be contract or potentially full-time.

        "title": "The last Bitcoin: What will happen once all BTC are mined? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Satoshi Nakamoto mined the genesis block on Jan. 3, 2009, minting the first 50 Bitcoin (BTC) in history and kicking off what would become a billion-dollar industry centered around mining crypto. However, with a cap on Bitcoin supply, the fate of miners after the last coins are issued is unclear.\n\nBitcoin is created through mining, a process involving computer hardware to solve complex mathematical problems and verify transactions on the blockchain network. For their efforts, miners are rewarded with a predetermined amount of BTC for each block of transactions.\n\nAccording to the Blockchain Council, more than 19 million BTC has been awarded to miners in block rewards, and according to Nakamoto\u2019s white paper, only 21 million are available. Once this cap is reached, miners will no longer receive rewards for verifying transactions.\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Nick Hansen, founder and CEO of Bitcoin mining firm Luxor Mining, says that despite the loss of block rewards, miners will continue to play an essential role in verifying and recording transactions on the blockchain, but how they are compensated will evolve.\n\nCurrently, successfully validating a new block on the blockchain rewards miners with 6.25 BTC, worth about $188,381 at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko. Miners also receive transaction fees.\n\nAccording to calculations shared in a May 1 tweet from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, since 2010, fees and block rewards have netted miners over $50 billion.\n\nSince #Bitcoin's inception, Miners have earnt a total revenue of $50.2B from the block subsidy and fees, for an all-time estimated input cost of $36.6B.\n\n\n\nThis places the all-time-aggregate profit margin for Miners at $13.6B (+37%). pic.twitter.com/TYvBSZbsRo \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) May 2, 2023\n\nHansen believes transaction fees will eventually become the primary incentive for miners to continue long after the last BTC is mined.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why as transaction fees become an increasingly important part of Bitcoin mining economics, understanding transaction fee dynamics and forecasting them into the future becomes even more critical,\u201d he said, adding:\n\n\u201cThus, it\u2019s important to see fees increase over time, something that Bitcoin Ordinals, as of late, has helped with, for example.\u201d\n\nHowever, this shift is still likely years away, given that nobody currently mining will be alive when the last BTC block reward is received.\n\nIt will be a long wait to find out\n\nAccording to Hansen, based on the block discovery rate and the halving process, which occurs roughly every four years \u2014 or every 210,000 blocks of transactions \u2014 the last BTC will most likely be mined around 2140.\n\nA Bitcoin halving is a planned reduction in the rewards that miners receive, with the next one currently predicted to occur around April 2024. This will reduce the reward for each block to 3.125 BTC or roughly $94,190 at the time of writing.\n\nIn theory, by limiting the supply of BTC, each coin\u2019s value should increase as demand increases and supply remains fixed.\n\nHansen says the price of BTC in 2140 will depend on unpredictable factors such as market demand, the regulatory environment, technological advancements and macroeconomic factors.\n\n\u201cThe fact that all Bitcoin is in circulation may create scarcity, but whether this scarcity will translate to price increases is subject to market dynamics,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs we look to a future where all Bitcoin has been mined, it\u2019s important to remember that Bitcoin was designed with this endgame in mind.\n\n\u201cThe tapering off of block rewards and shift toward transaction fees are intrinsic to the protocol, and represent an ingenious solution to ensuring the ongoing security and viability of the network,\u201d Hansen added.\n\nRelated: Rising BTC transaction fees are a good thing, Bitcoin educator shares\n\nJaran Mellerud, a research analyst from Hashrate Index, told Cointelegraph that as Bitcoin adoption and usage grows, transaction fees will drastically increase and become the primary source of revenue for mining firms.\n\nMellerud said that, by the time the last BTC is issued, the block subsidy will have already been so minuscule that it will not significantly impact the coin supply.\n\n\u201cDue to the huge block space demand relative to the scarce block space supply, transaction fees will have to skyrocket in a future scenario of hyperbitcoinization,\u201d he said, adding:\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe there will be sufficiently high transaction fees in the future to justify the existence of mining, you don\u2019t really believe in Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWhat about fiat\n\nBy the time the last Bitcoin is mined, Mellerud believes its value won\u2019t be measured in United States dollars or other fiat currencies.\n\nHe speculates that by then, fiat money systems will have long since collapsed, and Bitcoin could be the successor, becoming the standard unit of account globally.\n\n\u201cUnder such circumstances, the only valid way to measure the purchasing power of Bitcoin is by looking at how much energy a Bitcoin or satoshi can purchase,\u201d Mellerud said.\n\n\u201cJust as we currently measure the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar in energy terms, barrels of oil,\u201d he added.\n\nA collapse of fiat money systems has long been predicted, spurred on by the many problems facing the traditional financial system. As recently as March 2023, Silicon Valley Bank collapsed due to a liquidity crisis, with Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank following.\n\nRelated: The first-world debt crisis means you can expect more pain ahead\n\nBefore the March 2023 banking crisis, a February survey conducted by business intelligence firm Morning Consult and commissioned by crypto exchange Coinbase found most respondents were already disillusioned with the global financial system.\n\nA large portion of respondents are disillusioned with the global financial system and want change. Source: Morning Consult\n\nBitcoin might not be the same in 120 years\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Pat White, co-founder and CEO of digital asset platform Bitwave, believes miners will remain a critical part of the ecosystem, but not all will survive, with some shutting down in the face of mounting costs.\n\nAccording to a March 24 report from Glassnode, since 2010, miners have already been experiencing long periods of unprofitability, with only 47% of trading days being profitable.\n\nAccording to data from Glassnode, miners have already been experiencing long periods of unprofitability. Source: Glassnode\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s conceivable we\u2019ll see some miners shut down or other manipulation techniques used in an effort to drive up fees,\u201d White said, adding:\n\n\u201cBut I also imagine that will happen well before the last Bitcoin is mined since the last few halvings will get the block rewards down to the satoshi level.\u201d\n\nHowever, White also says \u201ca lot can happen in 120 years,\u201d and BTC could fundamentally change over the next century.\n\nWhite believes that by 2140, quantum computers will likely have broken the core encryption under Bitcoin, though he says engineers working on it have long known it\u2019s not quantum-secure.\n\n\u201cThat shouldn\u2019t necessarily scare people because of this quantum security issue. Between now and 2140, there will have to be a major reworking of Bitcoin from the encryption layer upward,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt that point, the Bitcoin developer community will be able to assess whether or not we\u2019re actually on track to have a functioning transaction fee-based network or if additional Bitcoin mining is necessary to ensure the security of the network,\u201d White added.\n\nWhite further speculates that while Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s white paper states that 21 million BTC is the supply cap and the single most concrete rule, none of us will likely be alive by 2140 to enforce that rule.\n\nHe believes crypto boils down to coding and consensus; if the community thinks the transaction fee incentive is insufficient to keep the network secure, future miners could theoretically extend the BTC hard cap beyond 21 million.\n\nRelated: $160K at next halving? Model counts down to new Bitcoin all-time high\n\nWhat effect this could have on the price isn\u2019t clear, but either way, White thinks that the price of Bitcoin will stabilize at some global inflation-reflecting price point, and the major price movement will occur at some time in the next 120 years if one or more nations seriously pick it up as their reserve currency.\n\nIn that instance, he says it will \u201clikely be independent of Bitcoin mining schedules,\u201d and it would be the most solidifying moment to drive up the price of BTC.\n\nRelated: US law protects institutions and exposes retail investors \u2014 Rep. Torres\n\n\u201cThere are things we can\u2019t even imagine that might impact Bitcoin \u2014 wars and energy crises obviously \u2014 but what if we\u2019re a true multiplanetary species by then and we have to extend the block production time to support solar system-level communication speeds,\u201d White said.\n\n\u201cWhat I always find important is to focus on the hardest problems we\u2019re seeing today and do what we can to solve them. That might mean solving for payments or digital ownership, or banking the unbanked \u2014 these are the problems to focus on now,\u201d he added."

        "title": "Bitcoin options tantalizing bears to push BTC price below $30K before Friday's expiry - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "This week\u2019s Bitcoin (BTC) options expiry on Friday, July 21, could solidify the $30,000 resistance level and give the bears the upper hand for the first time since the 21% rally between June 14 and June 21.\n\nBitcoin options expiries coincide with volatility\n\nA review of Bitcoin\u2019s recent price action shows that three out of the last four BTC options expiries triggered significant price movements, making it crucial for traders to pay close attention to these events.\n\nBitcoin/USD price index, 4-hour. Source: TradingView\n\nNotably, Bitcoin\u2019s price has consistently shown strong reactions following the weekly 8:00 am UTC options expiry. While causation cannot be established, the magnitude of these price swings warrants extreme caution leading up to the weekly expiry on July 21.\n\nBitcoin bears benefit from stricter regulations\n\nWhile this week\u2019s options expiry could give bears control of Bitcoin\u2019s price in the short term, bulls have the potential advantage of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission reviewing spot exchange-traded fund proposals.\n\nAlthough these proposals are still in the early stages of regulatory scrutiny, the slow progression could partially explain why the bears have managed to defend $31,000 multiple times since late June.\n\nHowever, their best chance of keeping Bitcoin\u2019s price below $30,000 lies in the worsening regulatory environment. On July 19, the global securities exchange Nasdaq suspended the launch of its cryptocurrency custodian solution due to a lack of regulatory clarity in the United States. This change of plans was justified by Nasdaq\u2019s CEO, Adena Friedman.\n\nRelated: Bipartisan bill to regulate DeFi, crypto security risks introduced into US Senate\n\nFurthermore, on July 14, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced the suspension of its staking services for clients in California, New Jersey, South Carolina and Wisconsin. This decision followed a June 6 lawsuit from the SEC that accused the exchange of operating as an unregistered security broker since 2019.\n\nBitcoin bulls\u2019 overoptimism leads to a disappointing outcome\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price briefly surpassed $31,000 on July 13 and July 14, fueling bullish bets by traders using options contracts. However, a four-hour correction brought the price back down to $30,000.\n\nDeribit Bitcoin options aggregate open interest for July 21. Source: Deribit\n\nThe 0.39 put-to-call ratio reflects the difference in open interest between the $430 million call (buy) options and the $170 million put (sell) options. However, the outcome will be lower than the $600 million total open interest since the bulls were overconfident.\n\nFor example, if Bitcoin\u2019s price trades at $30,500 at 8:00 am UTC on July 14, only $18 million worth of call options will be accounted for. This distinction arises from the fact that the right to purchase Bitcoin at $31,000 or $32,000 becomes invalid if BTC trades below those levels upon expiration.\n\nBelow are the three most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on July 21 for call (buy) and put (sell) instruments varies depending on the expiration price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $28,000 and $30,000: 100 calls vs. 2,400 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $70 million.\n\n100 calls vs. 2,400 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $70 million. Between $30,000 and $31,000: 600 calls vs. 1,800 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $35 million.\n\n600 calls vs. 1,800 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $35 million. Between $31,000 and $32,000: 3,100 calls vs. 1,400 puts. The net result favors the call (buy) instruments by $55 million.\n\nConsidering the recent weak macroeconomic indicators, it\u2019s likely that bears will continue suppressing Bitcoin\u2019s price until Friday\u2019s expiry. Moreover, China\u2019s second-quarter gross domestic product grew by 6.3% year-on-year, falling short of the 7.3% market expectation. Meanwhile, U.S. retail sales in June increased by 0.2% from the previous month, below the 0.50% consensus.\n\nConsequently, the bulls find themselves in a challenging position, as their call (buy) instruments will be invalidated if Bitcoin\u2019s expiry price falls below $30,000. Therefore, the bears\u2019 $35 million favorable outcome may not be a significant win, but it does increase the chances of $30,000 becoming a new resistance area.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "BlackRock ETF will be 'big rubber yes stamp' for Bitcoin \u2014 Charles Edwards - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) stands to win big thanks to the BlackRock exchange-traded fund (ETF), investor and analyst Charles Edwards believes.\n\nIn his latest interview with Cointelegraph, Edwards, who is founder of quantitative Bitcoin and digital asset fund Capriole Investments, goes deep into the current state of BTC price action.\n\nWith his previous bullish statements continuing to stand the test of time, and after an eventful few months, Edwards does not see the need to alter the long-term perspective.\n\nBitcoin, he argues, may be less of a sure bet on shorter timeframes, but the overarching narrative of crypto becoming a recognized global asset class undoubtedly remains.\n\nCointelegraph (CT): When we last spoke in February, Bitcoin price was around $25,000. BTC is not only 20% higher today, but Bitcoin\u2019s NVT ratio is also at its highest levels in a decade. Does this suggest more upside?\n\nCharles Edwards (CE): NVT is currently trading at a normal level. At 202, it is trading in the middle of the dynamic range band, well below the 2021 highs. Given its normalized reading today, it doesn't tell us much; just that Bitcoin is fairly valued according to this metric alone.\n\nBitcoin Dynamic Range NVT Signal, using Blockchain.com data. Source: Capriole Investments/TradingView\n\nCT: At the time, you described Bitcoin as being in a \u201cnew regime\u201d but forecast up to 12 months\u2019 upward grind to come. How has your thinking evolved since?\n\nCE: That thinking mostly remains today. Bitcoin has steadily grinded up about 30% since February. The difference today is that the relative value opportunity is slightly less as a result, and we are now trading into major price resistance at $32,000, which represents the bottom of the 2021 bull market range and confluence with major weekly and monthly order blocks.\n\nMy outlook today over the short term is mixed, with a bias towards cash until one of three things occurs:\n\nPrice clears $32,000 on daily/weekly timeframes, or Price mean-reverts to the mid-$20,000s, or On-chain fundamentals return to a regime of growth.\n\nCT: At $30,000, miners have begun to send BTC to exchanges en masse at levels rarely seen. Poolin, in particular, has moved a record amount in recent weeks. To what extent will miners\u2019 purported selling impact price moving forward?\n\nCE: It\u2019s true that relative Bitcoin miner sell pressure has stepped up. We can see that in the two below on-chain metrics; Miner Sell Pressure and Hash Ribbons. Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate is up 50% since January \u2014 that\u2019s over 100% annualized growth rate.\n\nThis rapid rate of growth is not sustainable long term. Hence we can expect any slowdown will trigger the typical Hash Ribbon capitulation. This rapid growth in hash rate also can only mean one thing; an extraordinary amount of new mining rigs have joined the network.\n\nIt\u2019s 50% harder to mine Bitcoin, there's 50% more competition and as a result 33% less relative BTC revenue for miners.\n\nThrough 2022 there were delays and backlogs in global mining hardware shipping for many months; we likely have seen that backlog flush out in the first half of the year with the large hash rate uptick. New mining hardware is costly, so it makes sense that miners would want to sell a bit more at relatively higher prices today to help cover operational costs and take advantage of the 100% price rally we have seen in the last 7 months.\n\nMiners are large Bitcoin stakeholders so if they are selling at a rapid rate it can impact prices. Though given their relative share of the network is diminishing, that risk factor is not what it once was.\n\nTwo on-chain metrics showing miner stress/selling. Source: Capriole Investments/TradingView\n\nCT: When it comes to U.S. macro policy, how do you see the Fed approaching inflation for the second half of the year? Are further hikes coming past July?\n\nCE: The market is pricing in a 91% chance of rate hikes through the rest of this year. There\u2019s a 99.8% chance that the Fed will raise rates at next week's meeting, according to the CME Group FedWatch Tool. So it's probable we see one or two more rate hikes in 2023. That seems quite excessive given inflation (CPI) has consistently been trending down since April 2022, and is now well below the Fed funds rate of 5%.\n\nOf course things could change quite a bit over the next months, but if we take two more rate hikes as the base case, my expectation that any net change in the Fed\u2019s plan would be toward a pause. We\u2019ve already seen the considerable stress building in the banking system, with multiple bank collapses just a couple of months ago. 2023 was the biggest banking failure of all time in dollar value; more than 2008, so things could change considerably over the next six months.\n\nRegardless, the Fed has implemented the vast majority of its rate hike plan. 90% of the tightening is complete. It's now a game of wait and see \u2014 will inflation continue to decline as anticipated? And will that occur before or after the economy takes a turn?\n\nFed target rate probabilities chart. Source: CME Group\n\nCT: Bitcoin\u2019s correlation with risk assets and inverse correlation with U.S. dollar strength has been declining of late. What\u2019s the reason for this? Is this part of a longer-term trend?\n\nCE: Bitcoin has historically spent most of its life \u201cuncorrelated\u201d with risk markets, oscillating from periods of positive to negative correlation. Correlation comes in waves. The last cycle happened to see a very strong correlation with risk assets. This began with the Corona crash on March 12, 2020. When fear peaks, all markets go risk-off (into cash) in unison, and we saw a huge spike in correlations across asset classes as a result.\n\nFollowing that crash, a wall of money entered risk markets from the biggest QE of all time. In that regard, the following year was \u201call one trade\u201d \u2014 up and to the right for risk. Then in 2022 we saw the unwinding of all risk assets as bonds repriced following the most aggressive Fed rate hike regime in history.\n\nSo it\u2019s been unusual times. But there is no intrinsic need for Bitcoin to have a high correlation to risk assets. It is likely with time that as Bitcoin becomes a multi-trillion-dollar asset, it will be more interconnected with major asset classes and so expect to see a more consistent positive correlation with gold over the next decade, which has a highly negative correlation with the dollar.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s correlation to the S&P 500 and Gold. Source: Capriole Investments/TradingView\n\nCT: How do you think U.S. regulatory pressure will impact Bitcoin and crypto markets going forward? Do you think Binance and Coinbase were the tip of the iceberg?\n\nCE: Impossible to say for sure, but I believe the regulatory fears of early 2023 have been well overblown. Bitcoin was long ago classified as a commodity, and from a regulatory perspective is in the clear. There\u2019s definitely question marks on various altcoins, but the legal outcome of XRP being deemed not a security was definitely an interesting turn of events this month.\n\nFinally, it's pretty clear that industry and government \u2014 where it matters \u2014 is in support of this asset class and knows it's here to stay.\n\nBlackRock ETFs have a 99.8% success rate and its announcement to launch a Bitcoin ETF was essentially a regulatory and financial industry green light.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen half a dozen other leading-tier financial institutions follow suit and, of course, now presidential candidate Kennedy is talking about backing the dollar with Bitcoin. This asset class is here to stay. There will be bumps and hiccups along the way, but the direction is clear to me.\n\nCT: How do you foresee progress of the BlackRock spot ETF and its effect on Bitcoin should it launch?\n\nCE: The BlackRock ETF approval will be huge for the industry.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin traders say \u2018get ready\u2019 as BTC price preps 2023 bull market\n\nBlackRock is the biggest asset manager in the world, and its (and regulatory) seal of approval will allow a new wave of capital to flow into the market. Many institutions sat on the sidelines last year due to concerns and uncertainty regarding crypto regulation. ETF approval will be a big rubber \u201cyes\u201d stamp for Bitcoin.\n\nETFs also arguably make it easier for institutions to put Bitcoin on their balance sheet, as they don't need to worry about custody or even entering the crypto space. So it opens a lot of doors. The best comparable we have for this event is the gold ETF launch in 2004. Interestingly it launched when gold was down 50% (much like Bitcoin is today). What followed was a massive +350% return, seven-year bull run.\n\nEssentially the Bitcoin ETF is just another goalpost on the pathway to broad regulatory acceptance and establishment of Bitcoin as a serious asset class. And it has big implications.\n\nCFDs on Gold annotated chart. Source: Charles Edwards/TradingView\n\nMagazine: Should you \u2018orange pill\u2019 children?

The Toronto Police Service said in a statement on Monday that it had arrested and charged four men on counts of kidnapping for ransom and other charges: Mr. Heywood, Tyler Fast, 37, and Deren Akyeam-Pong, 24, all of Toronto, as well as Rakeem Henry, 24, of London.\n\nMr. Heywood was among dozens who invested with Mr. Pleterski, who was supposed to invest their money in cryptocurrency and foreign exchange positions, according to court documents. But after spending money feeding a lavish lifestyle, buying three Lamborghinis and three McLarens, Mr. Pleterski filed for bankruptcy in August, leaving investors wondering what had happened to their money."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) miners have been up against the ropes over the past year, with record amounts of BTC sent to centralized exchanges to cover costs in 2023.\n\nAs Cointelegraph previously reported, the Bitcoin mining ecosystem has had an eventful year. The industry scored a staggering $184 million from transaction fees in the second quarter of 2023, eclipsing the total of 2022 on the back of a BTC price rebound and hype around BRC-20 tokens.\n\nStocks in prominent mining firms have also seen impressive gains in 2023, far exceeding Bitcoin\u2019s market value performance. The top nine public Bitcoin mining firms saw their market capitalization increase by 257% from the start of 2023.\n\nMeanwhile miners have also been forced to continue selling mined BTC to cover operational costs as the industry continues to attempt to claw its way out of a prolonged bear market. Miners sent a record $128 million worth of Bitcoin to exchange in June 2023, with industry experts highlighting miners' propensity to send BTC to exchange to cash out, cover costs and lock in profits.\n\nRelated: How Irish farmers turn cow dung into digital gold (Bitcoin)\n\nA market report from Bitfinex suggests that mining firms are looking to derisk by offloading BTC to exchanges. Analysts believe miners are engaging in hedging activities in the derivatives market, carrying out over-the-counter orders or transferring funds through exchanges for other reasons.\n\nCointelegraph reached out to a number of prominent mining companies to unpack the current mining climate and the recent trends emerging from the sector.\n\nJaime Leverton, CEO of Hut8, highlighted the company\u2019s efforts to close-off a merger with USBTC which has hampered its ability to raise capital through an at-the-market offering. After announcing the upcoming merger, Leverton said Hut8 treasury strategy included the option selling from its Bitcoin holdings and newly produced BTC to cover its operating costs:\n\n\u201cWe plan to revisit our treasury strategy once our merger is complete. As such, we were the last major Bitcoin miner to sell part of our production earlier this year.\n\nLeverton added that Hut8 still holds more that 9,100 BTC ($271 million) and the firm remains \u201cbullish on Bitcoin and HODLing\u201d, given that it retains one of the largest self-mined Bitcoin reserves from a publicly traded company.\n\nHut8 disclosed that it had sold 217 Bitcoin mined across May and June for $7.9 million in its most recently published production and operation update.\n\nRelated: A Glimpse Into The Future - What Happens When There Are No More Bitcoin To Mine?\n\nFoundry\u2019s business development senior manager Charles Chong also weighed in on the subject, while the firm declined to comment on whether it had held any BTC holdings in 2023.\n\nAs Chong explained, bull market conditions in the past saw miners earning a 60-80% margin on production, while external capital was abundant, allowing many operators to hold onto their mined BTC.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are in a different time now with scarce external capital and only a 15-30% margin, forcing miners to liquidate their bitcoin to cover operational costs.\u201d\n\nChong also added that it was difficult to compare current market conditions to subsequent bear markets following market peaks in 2017 and 2021. He said that Bitcoin mining moved in cycles as miners \u201coverinvest\u201d in ASIC mining equipment during good times.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the Bitcoin mining difficulty has also hit recent all time highs, which suggests that the network is at its most robust. Chong explained that new, more efficient mining capable of higher hashrates have continuously been released into the market in 2023, which has forced miners to refresh their fleet to continue producing BTC at a profit.\n\n\u201cThat said, total energy usage by the network has been slowly creeping up as well, albeit at a slower pace, indicating increasing investment in security for the network.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson from Braiins mining told Cointelegraph that continuing difficulty increases are a result of hashrate increasing, which signals that industry participants see potential upside for BTC's price in the future:\n\n\"To us, this is a sign that miners are still able to deploy machines profitably in the current environment and are bullish on Bitcoin's future price appreciation.\"\n\nOngoing market conditions have also seen the closure of some prominent mining firms, including Core Scientific which filed its chapter 11 bankruptcy plan in June 2023. The firm has already managed to raise significant capital to bootstrap a reorganization plan earmarked for September 2023 .\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with \u2018Net Zero\u2019 promises"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is lining up a burst of volatility that could rival its 40% January gains, on-chain data suggests.\n\nIn the latest edition of its weekly newsletter, The Week On-Chain, analytics firm Glassnode revealed the tightest Bollinger Bands since the start of 2023.\n\nBTC price due \u201cstrong moves\u201d \u2014 but direction unknown\n\nBTC price has acted in a tight range for an entire month, using $30,000 as a focal point for sideways behavior.\n\nThis, popular analyst Aksel Kibar says, is putting both bulls and bears to the test.\n\n\u201cSeems like $BTCUSD is exhausting many trader\u2019s patience,\u201d he summarized on July 21.\n\n\u201cThat is usually the condition you see before strong moves. Not sure about the direction though. I will stick with my well-defined boundaries. I know that increased volatility is around the corner. Capture the directional move.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart. Source: Aksel Kibar/Twitter\n\nAccording to Bollinger Bands behavior, that move should come sooner rather than later.\n\nThe classic volatility indicator is currently printing a telltale sign that the days of rangebound BTC price action are numbered.\n\nBollinger Bands use standard deviation around a simple moving average to determine when an asset\u2019s price is due a shift in trend.\n\nOn BTC/USD, its upper and lower band are unusually close together at present \u2014 more compact, in fact, than at any time since Bitcoin began its 2023 upside.\n\n\u201cThe digital asset market continues to see remarkably little volatility, with the classic 20-day Bollinger Bands experiencing an extreme squeeze,\u201d The Week On-Chain commented.\n\nIt added that with a range of just 4.2%, this marked the \u201cquietest BTC market since the lull in early January.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Bitcoin saw a breakout which then continued throughout the month, bringing January gains to around 40%.\n\nBitcoin Bollinger Bands range chart (screenshot).

With this strategic move, Flooring Hut demonstrates its commitment to staying at the forefront of technological advancements and adapting to the evolving financial landscape.\n\nFormed in 2015, Flooring Hut stocks a wide range of carpet, laminate and vinyl flooring solutions, and is obviously engineering the kind of publicity stunt that\u2019s catnip for snarky blogs such as ours.\n\nBy diversifying its asset holdings to include Bitcoin, Flooring Hut embraces innovation and positions itself at the forefront of the digital economy.\n\nAccording to Companies House filings, the privately-owned company has four shareholders and two employees.\n\nFlooring Hut recognises the growing interest and demand from stakeholders, including investors, partners, and customers, who value transparency and progressive approaches to financial reporting. Including Bitcoin holdings on the balance sheet ensures that the company remains responsive to the expectations of its diverse stakeholders.\n\nIts 2023 accounts showed a loss of \u00a3173,423 and cash reserves of \u00a375,105, which at spot pricing is enough to buy 3.2 bitcoins.\n\nDavid Greaves, CFO at Flooring Hut says: \u201cOur decision to include Bitcoin on our balance sheet exemplifies our commitment to embracing digital transformation and being at the forefront of technological innovation. We recognise the potential of cryptocurrencies and their impact on the future of finance. By including Bitcoin holdings, we not only diversify our assets but also demonstrate our dedication to transparency and meeting the evolving expectations of our stakeholders.\u201d\n\nNews of Flooring Hut\u2019s endorsement of bitcoin follows an announcement on Tuesday that it would be \u201chonouring the legacy of Nelson Mandela\u201d through initiatives that combine \u201cthe principles of social responsibility with their expertise in flooring solutions.\u201d On Monday it press-released the donation of a wall clock to K2 Leisure Centre in Crawley, West Sussex.

        "content": "Pan Gongsheng, tipped to be the next governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China, is poised to continue taking a hard line on cryptocurrency trading and mining.\n\nChina has pushed major blockchain projects to support CBDCs and distributed ledger infrastructure.\n\nWestern-educated economist may take critical position as China struggles to revive its economy.\n\nWhen it comes to crypto, some hope China is on the rebound.\n\nHong Kong is reviving as a startup scene, state-run companies are pushing hard to get consumers to use digital yuan, and Beijing is backing an ambitious programme to build blockchain infrastructure for global businesses.\n\nBut there may be one major obstacle ahead \u2014 Pan Gongsheng, the deputy governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC). The Harvard and Cambridge-educated economist is tipped to be the next governor of the central bank.\n\nAnd he is not a big fan of Bitcoin and its ilk.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nCommunist party secretary\n\nNow speculation is mounting in both Chinese and foreign press that Pan is set to replace Yi Gang as the governor of the PBOC, which is one of the most influential positions in global banking.\n\nOn July 1, he was promoted to the communist party secretary at the central bank. And on July 8, Janet Yellen, the US Secretary of the Treasury, appeared to anticipate another promotion when a readout of her meeting with Pan called him the \u201chead\u201d of the PBOC during her diplomatic visit to Beijing.\n\nFreudian slip? US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen referred to Pan Gongsheng as the 'head' of the People's Bank of China (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Rita Fortunato)\n\nRumours of his appointment have dashed hopes of a reversal on crypto policy in China. He\u2019s been referred to as \u201canti-Bitcoin\u201d and \u201cBitcoin\u2019s worst nightmare\u201d in the English-language crypto press.\n\nThe characterisations are based on a series of comments he made in the months after the 2017 ICO craze. He referred to Bitcoin as a speculative bubble and likened it to the tulip mania in 17th century Holland \u2013 and doesn\u2019t think it will last.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nQuoting Keynes\n\n\u201cThe market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent,\u201d Pan reportedly said at a forum that year, invoking a famed comment from British economist John Maynard Keynes. \u201cSit by the river, watch, and one day the corpse of Bitcoin will float past you,\u201d Pan added, paraphrasing French economist \u00c9ric Pichet.\n\nAt the same time, he added he was a \u201clittle scared\u201d at the thought of unrestricted digital assets in China.\n\nBut his views reflect the general consensus in Beijing about cryptocurrency: it\u2019s volatile, destined to collapse, and has no place in the Chinese financial system.\n\nNOW READ: Multichain workers in China fear for safety after CEO\u2019s arrest, says Fantom boss\n\nPan has been a steady presence in the commercial banking sector in China for the last 20 years. He earned a Ph.D in economics at the Renmin University of China and then did postdoctoral research at the University of Cambridge in the UK and was a senior research fellow at Harvard University in the US.\n\nPrior to joining the PBOC in December 2012, he held several roles at the Industrial and Commerce Bank of China and served as executive director at the Agricultural Bank of China. Since April 2016, he\u2019s been deputy governor of the central bank and held other senior positions.\n\n\u2018Sit by the river, watch, and one day the corpse of Bitcoin will float past you.\u2019 \u2014 Pan Gongsheng, paraphrasing \u00c9ric Pichet\n\nBut whether his views on crypto have changed since he last spoke about it publicly isn\u2019t known. \u201cHe is a bit of an elusive new character. But he\u2019s also not that public of a figure,\u201d Kai von Carnap, an analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, tells DL News.\n\nNaturally, crypto is not high on the list of priorities for China\u2019s next central bank governor.\n\nThe Chinese economic situation, several months on from the relaxation of Covid restrictions, is only just starting to find its feet again. The IMF predicts the economy will expand 5.2% this year following the lifting of pandemic restrictions. But its growth is expected to slow after the reopening boost.\n\nNOW READ: Why China\u2019s rocky CBDC rollout is a \u2018severe\u2019 warning sign to Europe and America\n\n\u201cThe contraction in real estate remains a major headwind, and there is still some uncertainty around the evolution of the virus. Longer-term, headwinds to growth include a shrinking population and slowing productivity growth,\u201d wrote IMF economist Diego A. Cerdeiro and Sonali Jain-Chandra, another senior official at the fund, earlier this year.\n\nChina also wants to instil confidence in foreign investors and businesses who are wary of committing more capital to the nation amid tense relations with the US and the West.\n\n\u2018He has the kind of background where he can talk to international people, to the Fed, to the ECB. I think that probably gave him the edge over potential competitors.\u2019 \u2014 Kai von Carnap\n\n\u201cYou need to have this kind of character who can mediate some of the messaging,\u201d von Carnap said. \u201cHe has the kind of background where he can talk to international people, to the Fed, to the ECB. I think that probably gave him the edge over potential competitors.\u201d\n\nAs head of the PBOC, the digital yuan will also come under his portfolio. Von Carnap points to his expertise as useful for its internationalisation, though he cautions that it is still a mostly domestic project.\n\nBut is he in charge?\n\nThere has been no official statement yet as to his accession. This week, Yi declined to comment about his possible retirement during a lecture on the digital yuan organised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.\n\n\u201cMy title is right here on the screen,\u201d he said, although according to Channel News Asia a powerpoint at the event called him the \u201cPresident of the China Society for Finance and Banking\u201d as opposed to governor of the PBOC.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s crypto push\n\nThat said, Yi, 65, was appointed to a second five-year term as governor by the National People\u2019s Congress in March. It\u2019s not clear whether that was for the purpose of helping to usher in a new leader. Yi has reached the retirement age for ministerial officials (Pan himself turns 60 this month).\n\nAs for crypto, Chinese entrepreneurs are hopeful that Hong Kong\u2019s push to rekindle startup activity would spur the same story on the mainland. Tron founder and Huobi advisor Justin Sun, gushed about Hong Kong\u2019s new crypto policies to Bloomberg TV late last year.\n\n\u201cRight now they are using Hong Kong as an experiment base so they can see all the feedback, all the results, once they adopt crypto,\u201d he said.\n\nNOW READ: China wants 1.4bn citizens to use digital yuan for shopping and bus fares, but consumers still love Alipay\n\nA burgeoning start-up scene in Hong Kong won\u2019t persuade officials in China to abandon their view that cryptocurrencies are little more than a speculative bubble, even if Pan doesn\u2019t take the job.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how Hong Kong regulation would reflect or imply a change in Chinese crypto regulations by any stretch of the imagination,\u201d says von Carnap.\n\nCallan Quinn, based in Hong Kong, covers Asia for DL News.

I'm not sure if that's good, bad, interesting, or meaningless. \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) July 19, 2023\n\nSchwartz noted that there are many possible interpretations because XRP\u2019s trading volume as a percentage of its market cap is four times higher than BTC\u2019s.\n\nCalculating the Claims\n\nWith a trading volume of $2,248,762,398 and a market value of $$40,688,646,47, according to CoinMarketCap data analysis, it is clear that XRP has displayed exceptional trading activity during the last 24 hours.\n\nBTC, on the other hand, had a trading volume of $$13,569,814,934 and a large market cap of $579,361,777,905.\n\nIt has to be taken into account the trading volume as a proportion of the market capitalization for both XRP and BTC and compare the findings in order to verify Schwartz\u2019s claim.\n\nA closer examination of the data reveals that the trading volume of XRP as a percentage of its market capitalization is roughly 9%. BTC\u2019s percentage, which is 2%, is considerably lower in contrast.\n\nThese numbers support Schwartz\u2019s earlier assertion and highlight XRP\u2019s larger percentage of actively traded tokens in comparison to its market valuation.\n\nCumulative Spot Volume for XRP\n\nAdditionally, Kaiko , a trustworthy source of market information, provided insights on XRP\u2019s gaining significance in the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nThe report claims that after the key court decision, XRP has outperformed BTC, accounting for 21% of all crypto transaction volume to BTC\u2019s 20%. Ethereum (ETH) recorded a meager 8% share in contrast.\n\nThe trading activity on the sports market since July 13 is considered in this report from Kaiko and Schepens\u2019 declaration.\n\nThis does not consider the 24-hour volume of trades across all marketplaces, since BTC continues to outperform XRP. Kaiko pointed out that data from 25 exchanges were used in the evaluation.\n\nAdditionally, data from the market data source CryptoCompare demonstrates that XRP and BTC are closely matched regarding trade volume. Notably, the volume for BTC is $1.95 billion, while the volume for XRP is $1.57 billion. Commentators contend that because CryptoCompare only examines spot volume, XRP might have previously surpassed BTC on this criteria.\n\nSimilar to how XRP dominated South Korean markets, earning at least $2.5 billion after a US court determined that the digital asset is not a security.\n\nThe XRP Rally May Be Coming to an End\n\nHowever, given that the token\u2019s trading volume is beginning to decline, XRP rally may be nearing its end.\n\nThe ongoing decline in trading volume might perhaps result in a price reversal for XRP, which is now trading close to its local top. Following a landmark legal victory over the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), XRP\u2019s trading volume has been an important factor to monitor during its spectacular price surge.\n\nThe current drop may indicate a change in market sentiment, given that the token\u2019s price ascent was mostly driven by an increase in trade volume.\n\nThe drop in volume shows that fewer XRP-related transactions are taking place. This frequently suggests that traders may begin to take profits or reduce their purchase activities during a price rally, possibly in anticipation of a market shift.\n\nThis signals that we might be approaching a turning point in the recent price trajectory of the token, together with the fact that XRP is trading close to its local top.\n\nA price reversal can occur if this volume decline keeps up. A rally\u2019s large volume frequently reflects fervent investor interest and confidence in the prospects of the asset. However, if volume falls, it can be a sign that interest is dwindling and a sell-off is about to occur."

        "content": "A British court granted an appeal on July 20 that gave Craig Wright the right to argue in litigation that the Bitcoin file format is well-defined enough to qualify for copyright protection.\n\nWright, who since 2016 has claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin (BTC), launched a lawsuit against 13 Bitcoin Core developers and a group of companies, including Blockstream, Coinbase and Block, alleging violation of his copyright to the Bitcoin white paper, its file format and database rights to the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe decision reversed a ruling from February that considered Wright\u2019s arguments insufficient to show how the Bitcoin file format was first recorded, a concept known as fixation in copyright law.\n\n\u201cThe Claimants may consider themselves unlucky to have had their application for leave to serve out come before a Judge with at least some understanding of the technology involved here,\" reads the decision from February, refusing permission to appeal. With this week\u2019s reversal, Wright reopens the discussion on the case.\n\nIn a tweet on July 20, Wright wrote, without mentioning the decision: \u201cThe legal protection of intellectual property is necessary to ensure the rights of creators and innovators and to encourage the production of new ideas, inventions, and creative works.\"\n\nEngland and Wales Court of Appeal's decision on July 20. Source: BAILII\n\nThe Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund (BLDF), the developers\u2019 legal representative, argues that Wright hasn\u2019t been able to prove that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of the Bitcoin white paper and database.\n\n\u201cWright has claimed to be Satoshi since at least 2016 without providing a shred of evidence to back up this claim,\" BLDF noted in a statement, adding that Wright must prove to be Satoshi Nakamoto \u201cbefore the courts can make a decision on the three primary claims named in the lawsuit.\" The case is expected to go to trial in early 2024.\n\nThe Bitcoin code is open-sourced and freely distributed under the Massachusetts Institute of Technology license, meaning that users have the right to reuse the code for any purpose, including in proprietary software. Wright has argued, however, that the Bitcoin Core developers represent a \u201cBitcoin Partnership,\" allegedly a centralized entity that controls the Bitcoin network.\n\n\u201cThey seem to be trying to muddy the waters and make it seem like Bitcoin development is a centralized process controlled by a few people, which is a key argument for their lawsuit,\" a spokesperson from BLDF told Cointelegraph.\n\nAccording to BLDF, the fact that courts in the United Kingdom are allowing his arguments to be heard is extremely concerning \u2014 not just for the crypto community but for the whole world. \u201cIt sets a dangerous precedent where developers can be sued for violating the file format of open source software that someone else claims to have created,\" it said.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Ordinals turned Bitcoin into a worse version of Ethereum \u2014 Can we fix it?"

        "title": "Towards a trustless Bitcoin wallet with miniscript - Ledger",
        "content": "\n\nThings to know:\n\n\n\n\u2013 Miniscript makes it possible to build Bitcoin software wallets that make a backdoor impossible to exploit in the hardware wallet. We\u2019re glad to say that Ledger is the first commercial hardware wallet manufacturer to support miniscript.\n\n\n\n\u2013 The additional features can be implemented without compromising the user experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware signing devices are engineered to safeguard the user from various common attack vectors, such as:\n\nUnauthorized access and extraction of the seed\n\nMalware infecting your associated software wallet\n\nSoftware vulnerabilities on the device itself\n\nLike any business, it\u2019s in the manufacturer\u2019s best interest to make devices as unbreakable as they can. Succeeding in this mission is paramount, and security companies like Ledger rely on a reputation built on their track record.\n\nHowever, some users might still have concerns. What prevents the company itself from hiding a backdoor in the devices?\n\nIn self-custody, we don\u2019t trust, we verify.\n\nBut can the user really verify that a device does not have a backdoor?\n\nThat\u2019s the key question this article delves into. More precisely, this article tackles the following topics:\n\nwhat is a backdoor, and why it\u2019s difficult, if not impossible, to prove that there isn\u2019t one;\n\nwhy only users can protect themselves from this risk;\n\nhow miniscript enables practical solutions to this challenge for bitcoin wallets.\n\nBy being the first hardware wallet to support miniscript, we hope to inspire developers to build secure solutions and upgrade our whole industry, and eliminate the chance of such a systemic risk from ever materializing.\n\nHow to build the unbackdoorable signing device\n\nLet\u2019s put it clearly: you can\u2019t.\n\nTo defend yourself against a potential backdoor, you need a different attack model than the one we outlined above: in this scenario, the adversary could be the vendor themselves, or a corrupted insider.\n\nThe often-touted solution to this issue is Open Source: after all, if you can inspect the code, what could possibly go wrong?\n\nHowever, the truth is more complex. Since the vendor assembles the hardware, a backdoor could be entirely contained within it. The hardware could be designed to disregard the software at certain points and execute malicious code instead.\n\nUnlike software that runs on general-purpose computing devices (like your laptop or phone), scrutinizing the hardware is practically impossible with today\u2019s technology. Even if the hardware specifications were entirely open source, complete with the details of every single gate in the circuit, you would still need high-cost equipment to verify that a specific chip is built in accordance with them.\n\nHow to backdoor a hardware wallet\n\nHere are a few of the simplest methods a malicious hardware vendor could use to introduce a backdoor, along with some ways power users can protect themselves today.\n\nSeed generation\n\nMany devices offer you the ability to generate a seed (also called the Secret Recovery Phrase) directly on the device, using a True Random Number Generator.\n\n\ud83d\ude08 The evil device could generate seeds that appear random but are actually predictable to the attacker.\n\n\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Power users can circumvent this problem by generating a mnemonic offline. Additionally, incorporating a robust passphrase can also generate an entirely independent seed that the hardware vendor cannot predict. The trade-off is that users must ensure they properly back up the passphrase in addition to the mnemonic words.\n\nPublic key derivation\n\nHardware wallets derive and export the public keys (also called xpubs, short for extended public key as defined in BIP-32. The xpubs are used to generate the possible addresses for receiving coins.\n\n\ud83d\ude08 The evil device could return public keys controlled by the attacker instead of the correct ones derived from the seed.\n\n\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Users could validate the derived xpub on another, offline device. However, entering the seed on other devices carries its own risks. Security-aware users might deem any device that has accessed the seed as dangerous, potentially to the point of destroying them. The typical user might struggle to correctly perform this procedure while managing the additional risks.\n\nLeaking information\n\nAn airgap is frequently proposed as a solution to prevent a malicious or compromised device from exfiltrating private keys. After all, if a device can\u2019t communicate with the outside world, it can\u2019t do anything harmful, right?\n\nNot quite!\n\nThe device can always communicate when it\u2019s in use: it produces signatures. These signatures end up inside transactions that are broadcast and stored forever on the blockchain.\n\nA signature is a random-looking byte string of at least 64 bytes. However, since more than one valid signature can correspond to the same message, a malicious device could communicate a few bits of information every time a signature is produced, by generating multiple signatures and selectively choosing which to publish.\n\n\ud83d\ude08 A rogue device might produce non-random signatures that, over many transactions, reveal the seed to the attacker!\n\nAn attacker successful in installing such a backdoor would merely have to wait for malicious signatures to appear on the blockchain until they have enough information to reconstruct the entire seed.\n\n\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f For ECDSA signatures, using a standardized method of deriving the nonce deterministically (like RFC6979) thwarts this attack, provided one validates that the produced signature matches the expected one. However, ensuring this is the case requires loading a second device with the same seed, which leads to the same practical problems mentioned in the previous section.\n\n\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f An interesting approach is to use a smart way to force the device to actually choose a random nonce. A protocol for this purpose, known as anti-exfil or anti-klepto, is currently implemented in Blockstream Jade and ShiftCrypto BitBox02 hardware wallets. Read more on ShiftCrypto\u2019s blog, which also includes a technical description of how such an attack might be executed.\n\nOk then, is there no hope?\n\nMost of the defenses\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f listed above mostly require the user to perform explicit, intrusive actions in order to protect themselves: either by generating the seed on their own (essentially, using their brain to replace the functionality from the hardware wallet), or utilizing an additional device to verify that computations are correctly executed.\n\nHowever, the anti-exfil protocol stands out: given that there\u2019s always a machine intermediating between the hardware signer and the outside world, this machine can assist. Through an interactive protocol with the hardware signer, it can enforce the use of a genuinely random nonce, thereby diminishing or eliminating the chance of significantly manipulating the final signature.\n\nIn this blog post, we are primarily interested in these types of measures: while strategies that significantly worsen the UX could be appealing to power users, they are likely to make things worse in practice for the less technically adept users \u2212 which is the vast majority.\n\nThe security model\n\nStandard model for hardware signers\n\nHardware signer manufacturers aim to protect users from a variety of potential threats (for more details, see Threat Model). In this article, we focus on one, very important property, that can be summarized as follows:\n\nUsers can\u2019t be deceived into an action resulting in fund loss, provided they understand and verify the on-screen information prior to approval.\n\nApproval is needed for any sensitive action, particularly signatures. Protecting the seed would be futile if malware could produce signatures for arbitrary messages, such as a transaction draining all the funds!\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to emphasize that the above property must hold true even if the software wallet is completely compromised. What\u2019s displayed on your laptop/phone screen cannot be trusted: malware could replace addresses, deceive you about which addresses are yours, present a transaction but then forward a different one to the device for signing, etc.\n\nTherefore, the firmware and applications running on a hardware signing device consider the software wallet inherently untrusted and untrustworthy.\n\nAnti-backdoor security model for software wallets\n\nIn this section, we flip the roles completely. We now want to design a software wallet that prevents the hardware manufacturer from stealing or causing fund loss, even if the device is completely malicious.\n\nHence, this can\u2019t be a property of the device: rather, it\u2019s a property of the software wallet setup. We could summarize it as follows:\n\nProvided that the software wallet is not compromised, the hardware manufacturer cannot cause the user to lose funds.\n\nThis may seem counterintuitive, as it directly contradicts the standard security model detailed above. However, \u201cnot having a backdoor\u201d means \u201cdoing exactly what they are supposed to do\u201d. Since the software wallet is the sole interface between the signing device and the external world, it\u2019s the only place where protection against misbehavior can be enforced \u2212 whether because of a bug, or explicit compromission of the device.\n\nNote that this model extends significantly beyond a device failure, such as an exploitable bug. In this case, we\u2019re operating within a scenario where the device is actively seeking to cause fund loss.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s no possible protection if the manufacturer has successfully compromised both the device and also your machine that runs the software wallet. Therefore, it\u2019s absolutely vital to ensure that your software wallet is Open Source and auditable, especially if built by the same vendor that manufactures the hardware.\n\nThe role of miniscript\n\nMiniscript equips wallet developers with the ability to fully utilize the advanced features of bitcoin Script. For an overview of the incredible possibilities miniscript unlocks, refer to our previous blog post. You might also want to listen to Episode 452 of the Stephan Livera Podcast for a discussion on what miniscript brings to the bitcoin landscape.\n\nThe Ledger Bitcoin app supports miniscript since its 2.1.0 release, which was deployed in February 2023. At the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami, Wizardsardine announced the 1.0 release of their Liana wallet, the first deployed wallet based on miniscript.\n\nThe basic idea of this post is that a bitcoin wallet account can be protected not just with one, but with multiple keys. This allows flexible security frameworks where even a total failure or compromission of a key is not catastrophic.\n\nMultisig musings\n\nMultisig is a significant upgrade in the strength of a self-custody solution. By leveraging the programmability of Bitcoin Script, it enables the creation of wallets that necessitate multiple keys instead of just one. A k-of-n multisig wallet requires a combination of k valid signatures, out of a total of n possible ones.\n\nHowever, multisig also places a UX burden on the user, and introduces new opportunities for errors. A 3-of-3 multisig setup, involving three different keys securely backed up in separate locations, offers strong security\u2026 but it also means that if even a single key is lost, the coins become permanently inaccessible!\n\nTherefore, setups offering more redundancy (like 2-of-3, or 3-of-5) tend to be more popular: should a single key be lost, the other keys can still facilitate recovery. But this introduces a tradeoff: if one key is compromised unbeknownst to you, the overall security is significantly reduced!\n\nCompanies like Casa and Unchained Capital specialize in self-custody solutions where they hold a minority of the keys for their customers. They also assist their users by guiding them through the onboarding process and simplifying the use of custody systems, which can otherwise be daunting for most non-technical users.\n\nMiniscript and time-locked recovery paths\n\nLiana uses miniscript to create wallets that have multiple ways of spending:\n\na primary spending condition, which is immediately available;\n\none or more additional spending conditions that become available after a certain period (the so-called timelock).\n\nThis enables many interesting use cases:\n\nRecovery : A standard wallet with either single-signature or multisig as the primary spending path; but a separate recovery mechanism (a key with a different seed, a multisig, a tech-savvy friend, a custodian) becomes available after 6 months.\n\n: A standard wallet with either single-signature or multisig as the primary spending path; but a separate recovery mechanism (a key with a different seed, a multisig, a tech-savvy friend, a custodian) becomes available after 6 months. Governance : A company with two directors could establish a 2-of-2 for the company\u2019s treasury; in case of disagreement, a trusted lawyer could access the funds after 6 months.\n\n: A company with two directors could establish a 2-of-2 for the company\u2019s treasury; in case of disagreement, a trusted lawyer could access the funds after 6 months. Decaying multisig : A wallet starts as a 3-of-3, transitions to a 2-of-3 after 6 months, and becomes a 1-of-3 after 9 months.\n\n: A wallet starts as a 3-of-3, transitions to a 2-of-3 after 6 months, and becomes a 1-of-3 after 9 months. Automatic inheritance: The recovery path after 6 months includes a 2-of-3 of your three children; perhaps a second recovery path after 1 year involves a notary, in case the heirs can\u2019t reach a consensus.\n\nRemark: all the examples above use a relative timelock, which refers to the age of the coins (that is: the last time the funds were moved). The trade-off is that the user must remember to spend the coins (by sending them to themselves) if the timelock is nearing expiration.\n\nThese are just a few examples, but they should be enough to convince the reader that miniscript is a significant step forward towards realizing Bitcoin\u2019s potential as programmable money.\n\nWallet policy registration\n\nFor Bitcoin wallet accounts utilizing multiple keys (be it multisig, or more sophisticated miniscript-based solutions), it\u2019s crucial to train the device to identify the addresses that belong to that account. This is the only way the device can aid the user in ensuring that they\u2019re receiving or spending from the correct addresses\u2026\n\nValidating the policy and the xpubs of the cosigner against a trusted backup is essential, but relatively time-consuming.\n\nThe good news is that it only needs to be done once:\n\nOnce a policy is registered with a name (in the example \u201cDecaying 3of3\u201d), your device will be able to recognize it whenever such a policy is employed.\n\nThose interested in technical details can find more information in the BIP proposal.\n\nPolicy backup\n\nOne critical aspect to note is that while multi-key policies permit a subset of the private keys to authorize transactions, the knowledge of all the public keys (and the exact policy) are required.\n\nHowever, unlike the seed, backing up the policy and the public keys is far less risky: if someone were to discover it, they could trace all the transactions linked to that policy. Although this is not ideal \u2212 privacy matters! \u2212 it is not as disastrous as losing your coins and less enticing for potential attackers. Consequently, storing multiple copies of the policy in hot wallets, printing it and storing it in various places, encrypting it and storing it in cloud storage, and so on, are all viable strategies.\n\nThe unbackdoorable single-signature wallet\n\nLet\u2019s take a step back. We\u2019ve discussed multi-signature wallets, but now we\u2019re going back to basics to create a single-signature wallet. More precisely, we want a wallet that feels and looks like a single-signature wallet, after an initial setup phase. Yet, we aim to create a wallet from which the manufacturer cannot steal your funds even if they are malicious \ud83d\ude08, and the hardware signing device behaves in unpredictable ways.\n\nThe approach can easily be generalized for multi-signature wallets.\n\nThe examples below will be written in a language called policy, rather than miniscript. Policy is easier for humans to read and think about, and can be compiled to miniscript with automated tools. Read more about miniscript and policy.\n\nThe hardware wallet can protect you in the standard security model. Miniscript can protect you in the anti-backdoor security model (and much more!).\n\nStep zero: the status quo\n\nThis is the policy most users use today: a single key that is derived from a seed produced in the hardware wallet.\n\npk(key_ledger)\n\nOf course, there is no way of proving the absence of a backdoor.\n\nStep one: double those keys\n\nThe first step is simple:\n\nand(pk(key_ledger), pk(key_client))\n\nHere, key_client is generated on the user\u2019s machine, hence a hot key. Essentially, it\u2019s a 2-of-2 multisig setup. The key aspect is that the user doesn\u2019t interact much with key_client : the software wallet generates this key, includes it in the wallet\u2019s backup, and signs whenever needed (for example, while the user is busy signing with their hardware signer).\n\nThis already seems quite interesting: the funds are unspendable without key_client , which is unavailable to the hardware vendor; even if the evil vendor had full knowledge of the key in the device, they would still be unable to move the funds without explicitly targeting the user, for example by compromising the machine that runs their software wallet.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s an issue: during wallet onboarding, the hardware signer is the only entity capable of generating the public key (xpub) key_ledger used in the wallet. Hence, the device could intentionally generate a wrong xpub controlled by the attacker, and later decline (or be unable) to sign. Arguably, this is a fairly extreme attack scenario: the backdoor creator can\u2019t steal the funds, and the most they can do is individually target the user and demand a ransom (\u201cI can help you retrieve your money if you pay half to me\u201d).\n\nMore realistically, this increases the chance of mistakes of mistakes: you now have two seeds / private keys, and you need both in order to be able to spend. Lose either, and coins are locked forever.\n\nStep two: timelocked recovery\n\nWe introduce a separate recovery key, accessible only after a specific timelock: and(older(25920) , pk(key_recovery)) , where 25920 is the approximate number of blocks in 6 months. The full policy becomes:\n\nor( and(pk(key_ledger), pk(key_client)), and(after(25920), pk(key_recovery)) )\n\nThis is similar to the previous scenario, but with a twist: if key_ledger or key_client becomes unavailable for any reason (most commonly, losing the seed backup!), a recovery path becomes accessible after 6 months.\n\nThere are several options for key_recovery , each with its own tradeoffs:\n\na. Use another hot key. This is a practical solution as long as the user remembers to reset the timelock. However, if the hot keys are compromised (a scenario that should generally be considered quite likely!), the attacker could attempt to access the funds as soon as the timelock expires, initiating a race with the legitimate owner.\n\nb. Use a separate hardware signing device. This is a robust solution and can be used in combination with a different vendor if desired; however, it increases the setup complexity and cost for the user in terms of user experience.\n\nc. Use a trusted external service. The software wallet could import an xpub from an external service, using it as key_recovery . This third party is only trusted if the timelock expires, which could be an appealing tradeoff for some users.\n\nAs mentioned, like for any policy with timelocks, it is important that the user remembers to refresh the coins before the expiration of the timelock.\n\nStep three: the untrusted third party\n\nLet\u2019s blend both ideas (a) and (c): for the recovery path, we require a local hot key key_recovery_local , and a key_recovery_remote that is hosted with a semi-trusted service; we also retain the timelock.\n\nor(\n\nand(pk(key_ledger), pk(key_client)),\n\nand(older(25920),\n\nand(pk(key_recovery_local), pk(key_recovery_remote))\n\n)\n\n)\n\nThis decreases the level of trust needed from the recovery service. However, we must exercise caution: the service itself could be monitoring the blockchain and detect our UTXOs \u2212 after all, they provided us with the key_recovery_remote xpub, so they can scan for UTXOs containing pubkeys derived from key_recovery_remote . They will be able to learn about our financial history, even before the timelock expires, and even if we never utilized their service.\n\nRemark: Taproot trees can eliminate this privacy problem for certain policies, but this isn\u2019t always the case and requires careful evaluation based on the specific policy.\n\nStep four: blind the third party \ud83d\ude48\n\nIn order to prevent the recovery service from learning about our financial history, instead of using the pubkey they communicate to us, we can use a blind xpub technique explained by mflaxman in detail here. In short, instead of using key_recovery_remote in our policy, we choose four 31-bit random numbers a , b , c , d (the blinding factors), and we use the following BIP-32 derived pubkey:\n\nkey_recovery_remote_blind = key_recovery_remote/a/b/c/d\n\nIt\u2019s crucial that we also add key_recovery_remote , and the blinding factors a , b , c and d to our backup, for future reference.\n\nIf we ever need to use the recovery service, then we will reveal a , b , c , d to them. Until then, they have no way of discovering that keys derived from their key_recovery_remote are being published on the blockchain: the number of possible combinations for the 4 blinding factors is 2^(31*4) = 2^124 , which makes it impossible to bruteforce them all.\n\nStep five: too many hot keys can burn you \ud83d\udd25\n\nWe succeeded in making our software wallet unbackdoorable. However, we introduced a different problem: both spending conditions use a locally-generated, hot key that is not verified by the hardware wallet. Therefore, if the host machine is compromised, it might trick you into registering the policy using the pubkeys key_client and key_recovery_local , but put random, unrelated private keys in our backup (remember, the hot keys are part of our backup!).\n\nThat would basically make any funds sent to the wallet unspendable, as nobody controls the private keys necessary to sign.\n\nThere are a few solutions to solve this problem:\n\nDuring onboarding, after printing our backup on paper, we can use a separate device to verify that the private and public hot keys on the backup indeed match. This approach would eliminate the problem, as we would be certain we have all the required keys needed for reconstruction and signing.\n\nWe can add another spending condition with an even longer timelock (9 months, 38880 blocks) that only requires a key_ledger_failsafe from the hardware device. In this way, in the absolute worst-case scenario where everything else fails, we fall back to the security of a single signing device. In normal operations, we would never let the first timelock expire, thus, the second timelock also won\u2019t expire!\n\nWith the second approach, the final policy would look like this\n\nor(\n\nand(pk(key_ledger), pk(key_client)),\n\nor(\n\nand(older(25920),\n\nand(pk(key_recovery_local), pk(key_recovery_remote_blind))\n\n),\n\nand(older(38880), pk(key_ledger_failsafe))\n\n),\n\n)\n\nThis software wallet configuration satisfies all the security properties that we claimed at the beginning. Moreover, it offers a recovery path in case the main spending keys key_ledger are lost. A nice feature to have!\n\nOnboarding to the unbackdoorable software wallet\n\nWhat would the user experience for a wallet using such a complex policy look like? Here\u2019s a brief overview:\n\nThe user opens the software wallet and starts creating a new account.\n\nThe software wallet prompts the user to connect their signing device and retrieves the xpubs for key_ledger and key_ledger_failsafe .\n\nand . The software wallet autonomously generates the key_client hot key.\n\nThe software wallet obtains key_recovery_remote from a co-signing service or allows the user to specify a key in another manner. Optionally, it computes the key_recovery_remote_blind using the blinding technique mentioned previously.\n\nfrom a co-signing service or allows the user to specify a key in another manner. Optionally, it computes the using the blinding technique mentioned previously. The software wallet generates a policy backup containing the precise miniscript policy, all the xpubs, and the extended private key for the key_client hot key. This backup is securely stored (for instance, printed on paper or saved on a separate device).\n\nhot key. This backup is securely stored (for instance, printed on paper or saved on a separate device). Finally, the software wallet instructs the user to register the policy on the device. The user cross-checks the backup (on paper or any medium other than the screen controlled by the software wallet).\n\nThe software wallet manages most of the above steps, making the user\u2019s involvement not more burdensome than the expected effort needed today to set up a multisignature wallet.\n\nThe onboarding should just require a few minutes once a good UX is built for it. Once complete, the software wallet can provide a user experience very similar to that of a typical single-signature wallet. This is how miniscript will change everything: by disappearing from the user\u2019s sight!\n\nTaproot improvements\n\nLedger supports miniscript since version 2.1.0 of the Bitcoin app, released in March. While support for receiving to and spending from taproot addresses was enabled since the taproot softfork in November 2021, we are now putting the finishing touches on the next step of the roadmap: miniscript support for taproot.\n\nTaproot will have a huge impact on the usability of the approaches presented in this article. If the primary spending path is a single-key spending condition, the existence of recovery spending paths will be undetectable on the blockchain unless they\u2019re utilized. This will greatly improve privacy by completely eliminating any fingerprints for the standard spending path. Furthermore, it improves scalability, as the standard spending path becomes as cost-efficient to spend as possible. This means no additional cost will be incurred due to the presence of recovery paths, unless they\u2019re used. This is a significant upgrade from SegWit transactions, which require publishing the entire script, including all spending conditions, during any spend.\n\nFinally, more advanced protocols like MuSig2 (recently standardized) and FROST will supercharge the taproot keypath. Built on Schnorr signatures, these protocols allow to create a single aggregate pubkey that can be used to represent an n-of-n multisignature or a k-of-n threshold scheme. This would allow the use of the taproot keypath even in cases that today are more commonly represented with specific multisig scripts.\n\nConclusions\n\nThis article explores a small (but important) niche of the vast design space that miniscript unleashes for software wallets.\n\nWe showed how miniscript can be used to create an \u201cunbackdoorable\u201d software wallet, while also adding an additional recovery path that allows to prevent disastrous key losses. While hardware signing devices cannot enforce the anti-backdoor security model, by supporting miniscript they enable software wallets that do exactly that!\n\nBy cleverly utilizing a combination of multisignature schemes, timelocks, blind xpubs, and hot keys, we\u2019ve demonstrated a secure wallet configuration that balances security, privacy, and robustness.\n\nMoreover, we argued that this is possible without negatively impacting the user experience, as the complexity of the setup does not translate to a great additional UX burden.\n\nWe are excited for the possibilities that miniscript will unlock for the next generation of bitcoin self-custody."

        "content": "Key takeaways\n\nThe amount of Bitcoin used for illicit activity has decreased drastically over the last two years.\n\nCriminals are beginning to favor stablecoins for their accessibility and ubiquity.\n\nPonzi schemes remain a threat in the Web3 space.\n\nBitcoin is no longer the cryptocurrency of choice for criminals, according to Web3 crime trends outlined in a presentation during EthCC in Paris.\n\nTara Annison, former head of technical crypto advisory at Elliptic, delved into the world of crypto-related crime, highlighting shifting trends in the cryptocurrencies being used for money laundering and illicit activities.\n\nUnpacking insights from Web3 crime insights from Elliptic, Chainalysis and TRM Labs, Annison highlighted a shift away from criminals using BTC in illicit schemes to stablecoins and other cryptocurrency tokens.\n\nAccording to the speaker, criminals prefer using dollar-denominated assets, like USDC Coin (USDC), as they are easily accessible and can be laundered through decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n\nPonzi schemes remain prevalent in the industry, with nearly $8 billion worth of funds stolen from unsuspecting users in 2022.\n\nCriminals are also becoming increasingly more savvy using a variety of cryptocurrency cross-chain bridges, DEXs and mixing services in an effort to avoid blockchain analytics firms\u2019 detection.\n\nA Stable Option for Criminals\n\nA key takeaway from Annison\u2019s presentation was the role that stablecoins are playing in the world of Web3 crimes.\n\nThe accessibility of stablecoins and their ubiquity across DEXs and centralized exchanges makes these assets an easy choice to quickly move funds around. Annison said digital assets\n\nthat are dollar-denominated feel \u201cmore accessible\u201d which criminals use as a target point.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also super easy to launder through DEXs. There\u2019s deep liquidity, really good volume, so that\u2019s pretty worrying.\u201d\n\nThe caveat of the increased use of stablecoins like USDC is the ability for issuers like Circle to freeze blacklisted tokens associated with hacks or thefts before criminals are able to cash out the stablecoins to fiat currencies.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is an increased number of accounts with USDC being blacklisted, and these are frozen funds that the criminals now can\u2019t access.\u201d\n\nFeels Like the 80s\n\nPonzi schemes have been part and parcel of the cryptocurrency space dating back to the early years after Bitcoin\u2019s inception. As Annison highlighted, scams are still prevalent and continually account for major losses.\n\n\u201cIt might feel a bit 80s, but they reign supreme. In 2022 we saw $7.8 billion worth of funds stolen from users in the space from ponzis and pyramids. The ten largest of these schemes accounted for about 54%. Ponzis and pyramids tend to get really big and dominate.\u201d\n\nAnnison highlighted Forsage and Trade Coin Club, the latter of which was eventually charged by the SEC . Trade Coin Club raised more than 82,000 BTC from 100,000 investors globally over a two year period. The SEC also charged eleven individuals responsible for running Forsage for operating an illegal pyramid scheme that raised over $300 million from users.\n\nA New Type of Criminal\n\nThe presentation also suggested that criminals are becoming more sophisticated in laundering stolen funds by using chain swapping and asset swapping techniques, aiming to evade blockchain analytics firms\u2019 detection.\n\n\u201cCriminals employ chain swapping and asset hoping to throw off blockchain analytics firms and evade detection, making it harder to trace stolen funds.\u201d\n\nAnnison also highlighted an interesting correlation between the number of scams in the industry and prevailing cryptocurrency market conditions. Scams in the cryptocurrency space have decreased due to the falling market prices, as fewer new investors are attracted, making it less profitable for criminals.\n\nTerrorists Using Tron, USDT\n\nAnnison also touched on sanctions evasion and terrorist financing, suggesting that terrorists are increasingly using crypto to bypass international financial barriers\n\n\u201cCryptocurrencies are being used for sanctions evasion and terrorist financing, with Tron and USDtt being favored by terrorist organizations.\u201d\n\nAnnison also noted that some sanctioned nations have turned to Bitcoin mining in an effort to bypass sanctions. She highlighted reports and data from 2021 that estimated that 4.5% of all Bitcoin mining was carried out in Iran, with the proceeds used to evade sanctions.\n\nThreats From All Sides\n\nThe popularity of various metaverse platforms has also led to an element of criminality creeping in.\n\nPhishing attacks, NFT theft, wallet tainting, and augmented reality hacks have all become commonplace, according to Annison, presenting unique challenges for the sector to tackle with users\u2019 reputations and security at risk.\n\nOverall, the cryptocurrency sector continues to face a range of criminal activities, demanding increased vigilance and security measures to protect users and combat illicit activities."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nTesla hasn\u2019t lost much by selling most of its BTC a year ago\n\nWhat Did Tesla Make by Selling its Bitcoin?\n\nIs Tesla Still Interested in Crypto?\n\nIs Dogecoin Elon\u2019s favorite?\n\nTesla, the world\u2019s leading EV manufacturer, just released the company\u2019s earnings report for the second quarter of 2023. Within the report, the company details its expenditures and income from various sources, including returns on investments. However, the report shows that the company has made no sales of digital assets \u2014 not for this quarter, nor the two quarters prior.\n\nTesla reports that it holds $184 million in digital assets, a figure that hasn\u2019t changed since Q3 of 2022.\n\nConsidering the huge push both Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk made for crypto in 2021, the company\u2019s inactivity in the crypto market tells a story about its change of attitude towards digital asset investment.\n\nTesla Dumped Bitcoin\n\nIf we rewind the clock all the way to 2021, we\u2019ll remember how Tesla shocked the crypto market when it invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin. According to the US Securities and Exchange filing , the company said that it \u201cinvested an aggregate $1.50 billion in Bitcoin under this policy and may acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term. Moreover, we expect to begin accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future.\u201d\n\nThe move shocked the market as Bitcoin immediately rose in price by over $3,000.\n\nShortly after, Musk tweeted that the company \u201chas suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin. We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel,\u201d adding that \u201cCryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at great cost to the environment.\u201d\n\nFast forward just over a year, in Q2 2022, the company sold 75% of its Bitcoin stash for $936 million, realizing a profit of $128 million.\n\nThe company then released its earning report reflecting the sale, stating, \u201cAs of the end of Q2, we have converted approximately 75% of our Bitcoin purchases into fiat currency.\u201d\n\n\u201cConversions in Q2 added $936M of cash to our balance sheet.\u201d\n\nThe company also commented on the huge Bitcoin offload, saying it was meant to \u201cprove liquidity of Bitcoin as an alternative to holding cash on balance sheet.\u201d\n\nThrough quick maths, we can assume that Tesla sold its Bitcoin stash for an average of $29,000 per token. The figure is shockingly close to the price of BTC at the time this article is being written, floating around $30,000.\n\nSo, had Tesla held onto its Bitcoin stash for a year longer, the company would\u2019ve sold the same tokens in 2023 for $968 million, rather than $936 million.\n\nMeme-ing The Crypto Market\n\nIn the meantime, Tesla\u2019s CEO Elon Musk has been fickle about his support for DogeCoin. As the company was making its huge purchase of Bitcoin, Musk posted a series of tweets to show support for DogeCoin, even momentarily including \u201cDogecoin\u201d in his Twitter bio.\n\nDoge \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 4, 2021\n\nDogecoin is the people\u2019s crypto \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 4, 2021\n\nNo highs, no lows, only Doge \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 4, 2021\n\nAs a result, DogeCoin saw a staggering 50% surge in price. Elon even gave another 30% boost to DogeCoin earlier this year when Twitter decided to change its logo from the typical blue bird to the DogeCoin logo.\n\nTesla still accepts DogeCoin as a form of payment on its websites. A whole FAQ page on Tesla\u2019s website is dedicated to DogeCoin.\n\nPerhaps, as a result, Evan Spencer of Evan Spencer Law, A New York plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer, filed accusations against Tesla and its CEO, claiming market manipulation.\n\nThe complaint states that Musk and Tesla used eight crypto wallets to sell DogeCoin after hyping up the token through Twitter shenanigans.\n\nMusk has responded with proof that he had disclaimed these wallets prior to the DogeCoin sale."

        "title": "Bitfinex Hack Money Launderers Plead Guilty - Chainalysis Blog",
        "content": "Today, paperwork was filed in the case of Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan (also known by her rap name Razzlekhan) for their role in laundering the more than 120,000 Bitcoin stolen from Bitfinex in 2016, suggesting the couple will plead guilty in a hearing scheduled for August 3rd. The stolen Bitcoin was valued around $70 million at the time of the theft, but worth over $4 billion at the time of their arrest in February 2022.\n\nAs we covered at the time, U.S. authorities were able to recover over 94,000 of the stolen Bitcoin following a joint investigation by the FBI, IRS-CI, and HSI. On August 9th 2022, in a previously unreported set of transactions, U.S. authorities recovered an additional 12,267 Bitcoin directly from the wallets of the initial theft. And on November 18th 2022, U.S. authorities recovered a further 1,155 Bitcoins. On January 5th, an additional 2.5 Bitcoins was recovered. The second, third, and fourth recoveries bring the amount recovered by U.S. authorities to over 108,068 Bitcoin.\n\nThe arrest and seizure, along with today\u2019s filing, represent another major victory for law enforcement in the fight against cryptocurrency-based crime. We\u2019ve written previously about how important it is for law enforcement to develop the ability to seize criminally-obtained cryptocurrency, and published a guide last year on how cryptocurrency businesses and law enforcement can work together to facilitate seizures. The Bitfinex investigation is a great example of this collaboration.\n\nBelow, we\u2019ll explore how the husband-and-wife duo\u2019s money laundering strategy evolved in the years following the hack, and tell you more about how law enforcement cracked the case.\n\nTracking Bitfinex\u2019s stolen funds\n\nWe constructed the Chainalysis Reactor graph below based on the publicly-available DOJ indictment describing how Lichtenstein and Morgan moved the Bitcoin stolen from Bitfinex. While the information provided in the indictment wasn\u2019t enough to trace the movements of funds to every cryptocurrency service mentioned, the graph below shows how the couple\u2019s money laundering strategy evolved over time. We should also note that while not all of these businesses meet the conventional definition of an exchange, the DOJ indictment refers to all of them as Virtual Currency Exchanges (VCEs) and anonymizes them with simple, numbered labels (VCE 1, VCE 2, etc.), which we\u2019ll also use here.\n\n\n\nThe laundering of the Bitfinex funds had five distinct components, some of which were carried out in overlapping time periods, involving several different cryptocurrency businesses.\n\nComponent 1: The theft\n\nFirst, we see the initial theft: In a series of 2,075 transactions taking place in August 2016, the hacker moved 120,000 Bitcoin from Bitfinex to a wallet we labeled \u201cBitfinex.com Stolen Funds.\u201d Most of the funds never left that wallet. Directly above the hacker\u2019s wallet, we see that those funds were seized by law enforcement and moved to a new wallet nearly six years later in February 2022.\n\nComponent 2: Using a darknet market as a mixer\n\nIn January 2017, Lichtenstein and Morgan moved a large portion of the funds to the now-defunct darknet market AlphaBay, which the couple essentially used as a mixer by depositing the stolen Bitcoin and withdrawing equivalent amounts. Some funds moved to AlphaBay directly from the initial theft wallet, while others were moved there through intermediary wallets.\n\nComponent 3: Movements to VCEs and first cashouts\n\nSoon after that, Lichtenstein and Morgan moved funds from AlphaBay to four cryptocurrency exchanges, which the indictment refers to as VCEs 1-4. The information provided in the indictment only allows us to show movements to VCEs 1 and 4 on the graph above, but the movements to VCEs 2 and 3 likely look similar. Lichtenstein and Morgan created several different accounts using fake identities at these exchanges to receive the Bitcoin laundered through AlphaBay \u2014 in at least some cases, compliance teams at the exchanges were able to detect that the accounts likely belonged to the same person, for instance due to similarities in the email addresses used to register them and overlaps in the IP addresses used to access the accounts. Some of the exchanges froze the accounts due to this suspicious activity, as well as Lichtenstein and Morgan\u2019s inability to verify their identities or the source of the funds.\n\nComponent 4: Mixer usage and more VCEs\n\nBy 2019, AlphaBay had been taken down by law enforcement, so Lichtenstein and Morgan needed a new money laundering method. They began sending funds to a popular mixer, and then on to more VCEs (VCEs 5-10 in the indictment) where they swapped the Bitcoin for other assets, including Monero. Additionally, the pair sent some funds to a precious metals seller via a merchant services provider (labeled BTC PSP 1) in order to swap their cryptocurrency for gold. The indictment details how Lichtenstein and Morgan in some instances attempted to convince exchange representatives that their Bitcoin came from payment for advertising services, even creating a shell corporation to sell the story.\n\nComponent 5: Funds exchanged for cash at VCE 7\n\nFinally, in 2020 and 2021, Lichtenstein and Morgan were able to convert more funds into fiat currency at VCE 7 and move them into a U.S. bank account. The pair was also able to buy gift cards for Walmart and other businesses at VCE 10 \u2014 a specialized service devoted to crypto-for-gift card trades rather than a conventional cryptocurrency exchange \u2014 using the Bitcoin they\u2019d moved to VCE 10 previously.\n\nBlockchain analysis and traditional police work solved this case\n\nIn the end, the gift card purchases described above provided crucial clues in the investigation. After tracing the initial movements of cryptocurrency, investigators discovered that a personal wallet address beginning with 36B6mu, which had received over $1 million worth of Bitcoin associated with the Bitfinex hack, provided funding for the account at VCE 10 used to purchase gift cards. Agents discovered that the Walmart gift card specifically was redeemed through Walmart\u2019s iPhone app under an account in Heather Morgan\u2019s name. That enabled agents to get a search warrant for Lichtenstein and Morgan\u2019s home and cloud storage accounts, where they found files containing details of the cryptocurrency addresses used to move the stolen funds \u2014 including their private keys \u2014 along with the false information used to open accounts at cryptocurrency exchanges and plans to acquire fake passports. That discovery enabled investigators to trace the flow of funds in its entirety.\n\nThis case illustrates how blockchain analysis combined with traditional financial investigation techniques can empower law enforcement to solve cryptocurrency-related crime, win convictions, and seize stolen funds \u2014 in this case, over $3 billion worth at the time of arrest. We commend the agents at IRS-CI, FBI, and HSI who conducted this investigation, and look forward to working with our customers in the public sector to prevent further theft and abuse of crypto assets.\n\n\n\nThis website contains links to third-party sites that are not under the control of Chainalysis, Inc. or its affiliates (collectively \u201cChainalysis\u201d).

        "content": "Tesla appears to be ready to take Bitcoin payments again after briefly doing it a few years ago, but stopping after pressure about going against its mission.\n\nTesla\u2019s history with Bitcoin\n\nEarly in 2021, Tesla invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin. Shortly after, the automaker started accepting the cryptocurrency as payment on new vehicles.\n\nHowever, a few days later, Tesla took a step back with crypto by removing the Bitcoin payment option. The company noted concerns over the energy needs of the Bitcoin network:\n\nTesla has suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin. We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.\n\nThis is a concern that many Tesla community members shared when Tesla first announced its Bitcoin investment, and many were angered by the fact that the company didn\u2019t think about it in the first place.\n\nAt the time, Tesla noted that they were not selling their stake in Bitcoin and that they planned to resume taking Bitcoin payments once the network showed a higher mix of renewable energy.\n\nA year after the initial investment, Tesla\u2019s Bitcoin holding increased to $2 billion, but the cryptocurrency lost a lot of its value in 2022 and the automaker\u2019s position suffered greatly.\n\nLast year, we reported that Tesla was likely down by as much as $500 million on its Bitcoin investment.\n\nHowever, it looks like Tesla might have avoided some of those losses.\n\nWith the release of its Q2 2022 financial results, Tesla confirmed that it sold about 75% of its Bitcoin position:\n\nAs of the end of Q2, we have converted approximately 75% of our Bitcoin purchases into fiat currency. Conversions in Q2 added $936M of cash to our balance sheet.\n\nWith roughly $936 million from that 75% and having sold over $250 million as a sort of stress test early in its investment, Tesla is still likely up on its $1.5 billion investment in the cryptocurrency.\n\nIs Tesla finally going to take Bitcoin payments again?\n\nIt has been two years, and Tesla hasn\u2019t seemed to be taking steps toward bringing back Bitcoin.\n\nNow internet sleuths have spotted that Tesla has added code on its website to accept Bitcoin payment again:\n\nBREAKING:\n\n\n\nTESLA HAS ADDED BITCOIN BACK INTO THEIR CODE FOR PAYMENTS ON THEIR WEBSITE pic.twitter.com/BhRL4C4BK9 \u2014 LilMoonLambo (@LilMoonLambo) July 20, 2023\n\nThe integration appears to be through Stripe, but it is still not available as an option on Tesla\u2019s website.\n\nBut it is all over the code on Tesla\u2019s ordering page:\n\nThe move could be due to recent reports stating that now more than half of Bitcoin mining is powered by renewable energy.\n\nIt could help Tesla justify bringing back Bitcoin as a mode of payment on its vehicles."

        "content": "Microstrategy\u2019s Stock Poised to Benefit from Bitcoin Halving, Berenberg Predicts\n\nSource: AdobeStock / JorgeEduardo\n\nBerenberg Capital has revealed its bullish case for Michael Saylor\u2018s Microstrategy ahead of the upcoming Bitcoin (BTC) halving event.\n\nIn a recent research note, the investment firm said the Bitcoin halving, scheduled for April 26, 2024, serves as the primary driving force behind the firm\u2019s positive outlook.\n\nBerenberg currently holds a price target of $430 for the Virginia-based software company, a notable increase from its current price of $407.71 per share.\n\nBitcoin halving occurs approximately every four years and is ingrained in the Bitcoin protocol.\n\nIt refers to the reduction in the rate at which new bitcoins are created and awarded to miners for validating transactions. The halving mechanism is designed to control inflation and limit the supply of bitcoins in circulation.\n\nHalving events have significant implications for the supply and demand dynamics of Bitcoin, which can ultimately impact its price.\n\nThe reduction in new coin issuance creates a scarcity effect. With fewer BTC tokens entering the market, the available supply decreases.\n\nIf the demand for Bitcoin remains stable or increases, the reduced supply can lead to upward price pressure.\n\nMicrostrategy Expected to Rally Alongside Bitcoin\n\nGiven the strong correlation between Microstrategy\u2019s stock price and the price of Bitcoin at approximately 90%, Berenberg suggests that Microstrategy\u2019s stock is likely to rally alongside Bitcoin.\n\nSince the start of the year, Microstrategy\u2019s stock has soared by over 181%, according to TradingView. This bullish trend continued on Monday, witnessing a 7% increase and ending the day at $407.71.\n\n\u201cIf the historical pattern established by the first three bitcoin halvings continues to play out with the fourth halving, then the pre-halving rally would begin about four months from now,\u201d the firm wrote.\n\n\u201cIf a rally were to occur after the fourth halving, and if it were as long-lived as the rallies that occurred after the past couple of halvings, then it would continue until around October 2025.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time analysts at Berenberg have endorsed Microstrategy due to its massive exposure to Bitcoin.\n\nBack in May, Mark Palmer, an equity research analyst at Berenberg Capital Markets, claimed MicroStrategy is a safer bet compared to Coinbase due to the exchange\u2019s regulatory issues.\n\n\u201cGiven the heightened uncertainty that Coinbase faces, we believe investors would be much better served investing in shares of MicroStrategy,\u201d the analyst wrote.\n\nAs reported, the Litecoin (LTC) blockchain\u2019s halving, which is poised to go through in another 21 days, has already positively impacted the price of LTC.\n\nOver the past month, the price of Litecoin has risen by 22%, while its 12-month performance shows an impressive 81% increase.\n\nThis performance has bolstered the confidence of Bitcoin investors who believe that the upcoming halvening event for Bitcoin will have a similarly positive impact on the price of the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin hit a 52-week high last month after BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, filed an application to create a spot Bitcoin ETF."

        "title": "Web3 Gamer: Earn Bitcoin in Minecraft, BGA's 50/50 gender split, Oath of Peak hot take - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Minecraft gets the Bitcoin treatment\n\nIt seems like Minecraft has been around since the invention of computers, and there is a reason for that. Along with its official free updates, which provide extra content, the Minecraft ecosystem has an incredibly active community, helping it stay up to date. Thanks to the game\u2019s open-ended gameplay, there is tons of community-built content available to enjoy.\n\nHave you finished the standard content of the game? Then why not relive the industrial revolution with custom-built mods? Or enter a competition to see who can build a construction first against hundreds of others? There is a server for that. Pokemon in Minecraft? Pixelmon!\n\nAnd if you want to earn Bitcoin in Minecraft? Welp, you can even do that now.\n\nPlayers can earn Bitcoin in Minecraft with the partnership between Zebedee and Satlantis. (Zebedee)\n\nA community-operated Minecraft server by the name of \u201cSatlantis\u201d has integrated Zebedee\u2019s gaming tech that lets players earn Bitcoin by completing in-game quests inspired by real-life BTC mining. Players in the server can join in-game mining pools, collect ASICs (popular hardware tailored for Bitcoin mining) and increase their hash rate to win block rewards. What a cool way to educate traditional gamers on the basics of Bitcoin!\n\nPlayers can withdraw their earnings to Zebedee\u2019s app, where they can spend their gains on other games made by the company or move them to exchanges that support Bitcoin\u2019s layer-2 Lightning Network.\n\n@Minecraft, meet #Bitcoin \ud83d\udfe7\ud83e\udde1\n\n\n\nIntroducing @PlaySatlantis, where you can earn real bitcoin in the world's most popular game.\n\n\n\nAll powered by the #ZEBEDEEapi\n\n\n\n\ud83e\uddbe\u26a1Supercharge your creation w/ the power of Bitcoin & get started w/ ZEBEDEE for free today:https://t.co/PRAH5i4EVM pic.twitter.com/WBDwepIJg3 \u2014 ZEBEDEE (@zebedeeio) July 10, 2023\n\nDon\u2019t get your hopes up for buying a Lambo with your earnings from building pixelated wonders. The server will give out a total of 1 million satoshis \u2014 equal to one hundred millionth of a BTC \u2014 per week. That\u2019s around $300 per week divided by God-only-knows how many people. While it isn\u2019t much, it\u2019s a start that could become a trend.\n\nThe Bitcoin-friendly integration is an unofficial one, and neither Satlantis nor Zebedee is affiliated with the Minecraft developer Mojang Studios. The studio itself is pretty down on Web3, having previously banned Minecraft NFT integrations. Time will show how this integration fairs against the ban.\n\nBlockchain Game Alliance ramps up diversity efforts\n\nDiversity is a surprisingly new topic in the world of video games. Most major publishers had not even released a diversity report as recently as 2021. In 2022 Activision Blizzard gave itself five long years to meet its goal of 50% women and non-binary employees.\n\nMembers of the Blockchain Game Alliance, a key organization promoting Web3 and blockchain gaming, voted to install a gender-balanced board, with three men and three women. And the newly elected BGA board of 2023 is made up of all new faces.\n\nBlockchain Game Alliance 2023 board members. (BGA)\n\nThey are Leah Callon-Butler, director of consulting firm Emfarsis; Yasmina Kazitani, chief marketing and partnerships officer at Interverse; Christina Macedo, co-founder and chief operating officer at Ready gg; Hideaki Uehara, director of business development at Square Enix; Mariano Rubinstein, CEO and co-founder at Sura Gaming; and Alex Kosloff, head of business development at Altura.\n\nAs an avid gamer, I will be watching with interest to see if the make-up of the new board can help progress and innovation across the Web3 gaming space.\n\nSega not a fan of P2E but developing a blockchain game\n\nThe makers of all-time favorite franchises Sonic and Yakuza have had an on-again, off-again relationship with blockchain technology. Sega announced plans for NFTs as play-to-earn (P2E) rewards last year. Later, they stepped off the gas after a backlash from fans, who considered the initiative a money grab.\n\nThis year, Sega is also walking both sides of the street. Shuji Utsumi, co-chief operating officer at Sega, called blockchain games \u201cboring\u201d and said the Japanese gaming giant wouldn\u2019t be using its biggest titles in blockchain gaming projects.\n\nHowever, Sega has announced a partnership with Line Next to bring its classic games to GAME DOSI, a Web3-friendly blockchain gaming platform. In light of this announcement, Utsumi clarified that investing in Web3 projects is within the company\u2019s strategy but that they don\u2019t intend to be a Web3 company but rather a \u201cWeb 2.5\u201d one.\n\nLINE NEXT partners with SEGA to license and bring a classic game to the Web3 gaming platform GAME DOSI. (LINE)\n\nAs everyone\u2019s aware, the mainstream gaming community is unenthusiastic about blockchain games and sees them as a temporary trend fueled by hype and speculation. Players are concerned about money grabs and the short lifespans of Web3 games, so it\u2019s understandable Sega doesn\u2019t want to put its big titles in an area where it has little-to-no experience.\n\nWhile some skepticism is warranted, it doesn\u2019t mean blockchain technology won\u2019t ever find its footing in the gaming industry. Multi-billion-dollar tech companies are aware of the possibilities Web3 gaming brings and know the importance of getting in on the ground floor.\n\nSega\u2019s decision to test the water with its smaller IPs is a thoughtful and measured approach that respects its legacy while navigating the uncharted terrain of Web3 gaming.\n\nStudio\u2019s $15M funding from Binance Labs for Web3 dino game\n\nBinance\u2019s venture capital and incubator arm Binance Labs has invested $15 million in Web3 gaming startup Xterio. The company labels itself as a \u201cfree-to-play-and-own\u201d game developer and publisher, meaning the games are free to play, and players are able to earn and keep NFTs. In August last year, it raised $40 million in funding from investors, including FunPlus, XPLA and now-extinct FTX Ventures.\n\nXterio seems to have a lot of experience on the gaming front, with Web2 gaming industry veterans on its founding executive team from companies including Ubisoft, Krafton and NetEase. There are 11 games in its repertoire, ranging from Age of Dino \u2014 a massively multiplayer online 4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate) strategy game that features dinosaurs \u2014 to Overworld, a cross-platform sandbox RPG with anime-inspired graphics.\n\nXterio is developing an \u201cemotion engine for AI,\u201d with an aim to enhance player immersion by equipping game characters with realistic and dynamic emotional responses \u2014 The Matrix and the whole AI takes-control scenario were way ahead of their time.\n\nOverworld promotional art. (Xterio)\n\nThe company uses AI very actively as they host an AI toolkit for developers and are creating a digital companion game called AIpal which is entering its beta phase later this year.\n\nHot take \u2014 Oath of Peak\n\nThe undeniable success of Genshin Impact \u2014 a Chinese MMORPG with cute graphics and fast-paced action that was released on virtually every platform except Casio Scientific Calculator \u2014 sparked off a trend of introducing every possible bit of Chinese mythology to Western audiences among developers.\n\nOath of Peak promotional art. (Oath of Peak)\n\nOath of Peak, an action MMORPG game that diversifies with its Web3 elements, seems to capitalize on that itch. Available on iOS and Android platforms as a free download, the game offers an epic world that\u2019s easy to get familiar with, thanks to its cute graphics.\n\nSimilar to other massively multiplayer games, players can pick from five different classes with fully customizable avatars. The game offers melee, assassin, ranger, mage and support characters \u2014 nothing groundbreaking.\n\nWith the recently-added English language support, it wasn\u2019t hard to find my way around the colorful island. After completing some quests, I realized one cool thing about the game: it doesn\u2019t shove its Web3 features at the player. Sure, the game has NFT monsters and a utility token that\u2019s exchangeable with in-game currency, but it doesn\u2019t become prominent until after players are invested in the game in terms of time and effort.\n\nIf you are in the market to check some new games with familiar mechanics, it\u2019s worth taking a look at Oath of Peak, now available globally via app stores or its APK. It\u2019ll only take 15-20 minutes for you to understand whether it\u2019s a game for you or not anyway.\n\nMore from Web3 gaming space:\n\n\u2014 Eyeball Games, led by the team behind Miniclip\u2019s 8 Ball Pool, has announced the launch of their blockchain-based mobile game, Eyeball Pool, on the Immutable platform in early 2024.\n\n\u2014 Polygon Labs\u2019 president, Ryan Wyatt, is transitioning to an advisory role after over a year with the company. Polygon\u2019s chief legal officer, Marc Boiron, will succeed Wyatt as the new CEO.\n\n\u2014 MetaGalaxy Land introduced the pre-alpha version of its metaverse platform, which utilizes Unreal Engine 5.\n\n\u2014 Major League Baseball became one of the first professional sports leagues to own a virtual world. Improbable, a metaverse tech firm, announced the new virtual space called \u201cMLB virtual ballpark.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Immutable has introduced OBS, its first Web3 racing game, as the latest addition to its game lineup.\n\n\u2014 Telescope Labs launched a comprehensive range of AI-driven solutions tailored for Web3 gaming, empowering gaming enterprises with the necessary resources to construct robust virtual economies.\n\n\u2014 Sweat Economy, a move-to-earn initiative, has revealed the introduction of Sweat Hero, an in-app game and NFT experience within their platform."

        "title": "UK Court of Appeal rules Craig Wright's copyright claim over Bitcoin file format can proceed - CoinGeek",
        "content": "Dr. Craig Wright notched another win in the United Kingdom\u2019s Court of Appeal today, as the court granted Dr. Wright\u2019s appeal over his copyright in the Bitcoin file format. As a result, his copyright and database rights case against the BTC partnership\u2014which includes Core developers and entities within the ecosystem such as Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN)\u2014will proceed on all fronts.\n\nDr. Wright had originally sued the BTC partnership which includes 26 defendants all of whom are involved in the use or promotion of the BTC network, arguing that the two airdrops which effectively carved out the BTC network from the original Bitcoin were breaches of his copyright in the Bitcoin white paper and the Bitcoin file format, and had additionally amounted to breaches of his database rights in the Bitcoin blockchain. Given how much of the industry went on to revolve around this new BTC, a finding that its creation was a breach of Dr. Wright\u2019s rights has the potential to alter the digital asset industry forever.\n\nThe High Court allowed the suit to be served on the defendants with respect to the copyright claim in the white paper and the database rights claim in the Bitcoin blockchain. However, the judge found that there was no serious issue to be tried in respect of the Bitcoin file format claim, finding that the Bitcoin file format was not defined with sufficient precision and objectivity in order to be subject to copyright\u2014a requirement known as \u2018fixation.\u2019\n\nToday, the court of appeal unanimously overruled the lower court. They found that the lower judge had \u2018several flaws\u2019 in his reasoning, beginning with the finding that Dr. Wright had failed to identify any relevant \u2018work\u2019 which defines the structure of the Bitcoin file format:\n\n\u201cThe work Dr. Wright relies upon, the Bitcoin File Format, has been clearly identified. The question of how and when that work was fixed is a different one. Dr. Wright\u2019s case is that the work was fixed when the first block in the Bitcoin blockchain was written on 3 January 2009.\u201d\n\nThe Court of Appeal went on to say that there was no requirement that there be additional content defining or describing the format in order for \u2018fixation\u2019 to be established. They agreed with Dr. Wright\u2019s argument\u2014which was rejected by the lower court\u2014that third parties have been able to deduce the structure comprising the Bitcoin file format from the blockchain and thus proved that the work was identifiable with sufficient precision and objectivity.\n\nDamon Parker of Harcus Parker, which represents Dr. Wright, said:\n\n\u201cWe welcome this significant ruling which enables Dr. Wright to advance his claim for copyright in the Bitcoin File Format which potentially affects all future use, and marketing, of Bitcoin and will prove to be a crucial development in intellectual property law.\u201d\n\nDr. Wright said in a statement:\n\n\u201cI am pleased with the outcome of this appeal. As many developers do not fully document their entire body of work, this appeal shows that, even without documentation, their work is still considered to be capable of copyright protection.\u201d\n\nThe Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment is a powerful one. Though the Justices were only considering whether Dr. Wright\u2019s claim had a serious prospect of success, the ruling nonetheless amounts to an encouraging rubberstamp from the second-highest court in the country. Now, all three limbs of Dr. Wright\u2019s lawsuit against the BTC partnership will be in play when the case eventually goes to trial. All 26 BTC Core defendants will have to defend against the claim that they breached Dr. Wright\u2019s copyright in the Bitcoin white paper; that they breached his copyright in the Bitcoin file format; and that they breached his rights in the Bitcoin database.\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "content": "Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion.\n\nThe bullish rally continued to wither, as BCH dipped below $250.\n\nShorts held a 52.21% advantage on the exchange long/short ratio.\n\nBitcoin Cash [BCH] went on a remarkable bullish rally in late June that launched it to a 2023-high of $329. However, July brought a change of fortunes for BCH, as bears formed a resistance level at $311 which led to a 30% dip.\n\nRead Bitcoin Cash\u2019s [BCH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nWhile buyers are still up significantly, sellers can advance the bearish momentum with its price currently trading below $250. BCH bulls could see more of their gains erased if Bitcoin [BTC] continues its price correction under $30k.\n\nSellers primed to flip price momentum\n\nThe on-chart indicators hinted at a change in momentum for BCH. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remained under the neutral 50 and continued to edge toward the oversold zone. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also stayed negative with a reading of -0.14. Collectively, the indicators revealed declining buying pressure and strong capital outflows.\n\nThe 12-hour timeframe showed that bears had broken below the key $248 support level. With declining volume, bulls could lose more ground with sellers looking to drive the price to the $186 \u2013 $220 level.\n\nNonetheless, another rally by BTC to $31k could prop up Bitcoin Cash at the current support level with bulls able to target the $280 price level.\n\nShorts hedge bets on further dips\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BCH worth today?\n\nAccording to Coinglass\u2019 long/short ratio, shorts had a greater share of the open contracts for BCH. Shorts had a 52.21% share compared to longs 47.79% share. This reinforced the bearish sentiment in the futures market.\n\nThis could see sellers extend their gains toward the critical $186 \u2013 $220 level, especially with Bitcoin continuing to trade below $30k in the meantime."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the oldest and most valued cryptocurrency, failed to rise above the $30,000 mark early Friday. Other popular altcoins \u2014 including the likes of Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), and Solana (SOL) \u2014 saw minor dips across the board. The Chainlink (LINK) token became the top gainer, with a 24-hour jump of over 18 percent. Rocket Pool (RPL), on the other hand, emerged to be the biggest loser, with a 24-hour loss of over 6 percent.\n\nThe global crypto market cap stood at $1.21 trillion at the time of writing, registering a minor 24-hour gain of 0.01 percent.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Today\n\nBitcoin price stood at $29,895.37, registering a 24-hour loss of 0.20 percent, as per CoinMarketCap. According to Indian exchange WazirX, BTC price stood at Rs 25.69 lakh.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Today\n\nETH price stood at $1,896.72 marking a 24-hour loss of 0.04 percent at the time of writing. As per WazirX, Ethereum price in India stood at Rs 1.62 lakh.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) Price Today\n\nDOGE registered a 24-hour jump of 1.69 percent, as per CoinMarketCap data, currently priced at $0.07166. As per WazirX, Dogecoin price in India stood at Rs 6.19.\n\nLitecoin (LTC) Price Today\n\nLitecoin saw a 24-hour gain of 0.40 percent. At the time of writing, it was trading at $92.59. LTC price in India stood at Rs 8,089.61.\n\nRipple (XRP) Price Today\n\nXRP price stood at $0.7925, seeing a 24-hour loss of 5.06 percent.

As per WazirX, SOL price in India stood at Rs 2,230.\n\nTop Crypto Gainers Today (July 21)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto gainers over the past 24 hours:\n\nChainlink (LINK)\n\nPrice: $8.25\n\n24-hour gain: 18.41 percent\n\nMaker (MKR)\n\nPrice: $1,164.71\n\n24-hour gain: 15.24 percent\n\nSynthetix (SNX)\n\nPrice: $3\n\n24-hour gain: 9.95 percent\n\nCompound (COMP)\n\nPrice: $75.39\n\n24-hour gain: 8.62 percent\n\nPolkadot (DOT)\n\nPrice: $5.65\n\n24-hour gain: 7.65 percent\n\nTop Crypto Losers Today (July 21)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto losers over the past 24 hours:\n\nRocket Pool (RPL)\n\nPrice: $30.77\n\n24-hour loss: 6.23 percent\n\nMultiversX (EGLD)\n\nPrice: $33.84\n\n24-hour loss: 5.66 percent\n\nRipple (XRP)\n\nPrice: $0.7958\n\n24-hour loss: 4.71 percent\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nPrice: $25.55\n\n24-hour loss: 3.97 percent\n\nHedera (HBAR)\n\nPrice: $0.05642\n\n24-hour loss: 3.64 percent\n\nWhat Crypto Exchanges Are Saying About Current Market Scenario\n\nMudrex co-founder and CEO Edul Patel told ABP Live, \u201cBitcoin has persisted below the $30,000 threshold for yet another consecutive day, influenced by various factors such as investors taking profits after a rally and the US dollar's strengthening. At one point, BTC even dropped to a one-month low of $29,500. Currently, BTC faces resistance at the $30,000 level and finds support at $29,600. Apart from Bitcoin, XRP and Ethereum have also experienced value declines. On a positive note, LINK's performance has managed to avoid a downturn. Furthermore, a notable development is the United States government introducing a new bill to regulate digital assets, potentially impacting the future of cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nShubham Hudda, Senior Manager, CoinSwitch Markets Desk, said, \u201cBTC, for another day, traded flat while altcoins registered some significant developments. LINK (+17.3 percent) is making a big move after launching its CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol). Good moves in other prominent DeFi tokens like MKR (+8.38 percent), SNX (+5.96 percent), and COMP (+5.29 percent) underline that the current market interest is around accumulating quality DeFi protocols before Bitcoin coves out of its tight range of trading.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, offered his take, \u201cThe overall market sentiment remains neutral even as prices for Bitcoin and Ethereum decreased. The macroeconomic factors and equity markets results have had little impact on user sentiment. Altcoins continue their popularity streak even amidst price volatility.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin is currently hovering slightly above the important $29,500 support level, bolstered by a triple bottom pattern on the four-hour time frame. Technical indicators such as RSI (39) and MACD (-5) indicate bearish sentiment. The 50-day exponential moving average acts as resistance around $29,995. The likelihood of Bitcoin remaining bearish below $30,000 is high, with potential support at $28,900 if it breaks below $29,500. A bullish breakout could push it to $30,000 and even $30,500. If demand increases, a break of $30,450 could lead to a rally towards further resistance at $31,200. Watching the $29,500 level is vital as it could indicate a buying opportunity above or quick selling positions if breached.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, \u201cThe entire volume of the cryptocurrency market increased by an amazing 19.70 percent over the past day to reach an astounding $37.46 billion. Ripple's XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency, gained 6.8 percent, while native cryptocurrencies Cardano, Solana, ADA, and SOL surged over 6 percent, outpacing Bitcoin and Ether. With a value of $29,905.69, Bitcoin continues to play a significant role in this rollercoaster. These numbers demonstrate the potential of the cryptocurrency sector and its indisputable influence on the financial landscape, which presents opportunities and difficulties for both investors and enthusiasts.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cBitcoin is holding a key support above $30,000 with a record-breaking accumulation of 5,92,000 BTCs worth $17.8 billion at the $30,200 level as per Glassnode, suggesting that investors are confident that BTC will continue to hold above this level. However, BTC dominance is close to its 1-month low, as investors are shifting their focus to smaller, riskier tokens. One such token is XRP, which has surpassed Bitcoin in trading volume after a court ruling determined that it is not a security.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: https://t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "content": "After shelving Bitcoin as a payment method due to criticism over environmental concerns, it appears that Tesla may start accepting the cryptocurrency as payment for its electric vehicles in the near future. The site's code also makes mention of Dogecoin, which is Elon Musk's favourite crypto flavour. The company has not announced any intentions to resume Bitcoin payments just yet.\n\n4 Reviews\n\nTesla, and its CEO, Elon Musk, have a bit of a sordid history when it comes to cryptocurrency, but it has been a while since the electric car company has accepted Bitcoin as payment for orders. Now, it appears that Tesla may start accepting Bitcoin in the near future once more, if Twitter user @LilMoonLambo's discovery is to be believed.\n\nIn a tweet posted to the social media site, @LilMoonLambo reveals that Tesla has added code that enables Bitcoin payments back into the design of its website. This is not a concrete indication that Tesla will accept Bitcoin, but it would be odd to code the feature into the website again if it didn't plan on using it.\n\nInspecting the Tesla order site and searching for \"Bitcoin\" reveals numerous mentions of the cryptocurrency throughout the payments page. Somewhat comically, doing the same thing with \"Dogecoin\" as the search term also reveals numerous mentions throughout the payments page.\n\nGiven the reasons Bitcoin fell out of favour for the EV maker, it's unlikely the brand would resume using Bitcoin, much less Dogecoin. That said, Tesla appears to be making a number of sweeping changes to its strategy, with recent changes to its EV pricing putting intense pressure on other electric vehicle manufacturers. The widespread adoption of its NACS charging hardware and the Supercharger licensing that goes hand-in-hand with NACS may be another strategy to diversify the company's revenue streams.\n\nBuy a Hot Wheels RC 1:64 Scale Tesla Cybertruck Rechargeable Radio-Controlled Racing Car on Amazon."

        "title": "Bitcoin Vs Gold Market Cap: Will Bitcoin Become the Gold 2.0? - The European Business Review",
        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency, has attracted tremendous attention in recent years. Often referred to as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d it has attracted many investors who see it as a way to diversify their wealth and secure their financial future. But the question remains: will Bitcoin ever outperform Gold\u2019s market cap? Can it be the Gold 2.0?\n\nBitcoin Market Cap Vs Gold Market Cap\n\nFirst, it is important to understand what market cap is. Market cap is calculated by multiplying the total number of coins or tokens in circulation by the current market price. If a cryptocurrency has 1 million coins in circulation and is traded at $1 per coin, its market cap would be $1 million. Gold market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the total amount of gold in circulation by the current price of gold.\n\nIn 2021, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap peaked at around $1 trillion, while gold\u2019s market cap was around $11 trillion. Even when Bitcoin was at its best in history, it still had a long way to go to outperform gold. Bitcoin is currently trading at a market cap of $512 Billion as at this writing and Gold at $13 Trillion. Bitcoin needs to increase in price by a factor of 26 to be hot on the trail of gold.\n\nBitcoin critics like Peter Schiff in particular have always argued against a further increase in the price of Bitcoin. It is often argued that Bitcoin is still a very young and untested concept compared to gold. It has yet to prove itself to be a stable and reliable investment option, and it remains unclear how it will fare in economic downturns or other challenges.\n\nHowever, not everyone shares Peter Schiff\u2019s opinion. Even his son, @SchiffSpencer, invests in Bitcoin.\n\nThe Digital Gold\n\nThere are many Bitcoin supporters who believe that the cryptocurrency will one day surpass gold\u2019s market cap. They see it as an alternative investment option that deviates from traditional investment options and offers investors new opportunities. Bitcoin utility also trumps gold\u2019s in some aspects.\n\nGold is certainly not suitable for everyday use; whether it be to clear a shopping cart on an online store or quick payment for a quick bite at Chick Fil a. Bitcoin isn\u2019t really there yet either, but it clearly has potential. Many companies and online stores now accept Bitcoin as a valid means of payment and this will surely contribute to its worldwide acceptance as time goes.\n\nOne factor that could contribute to Bitcoin\u2019s growth is the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies by governments, businesses, and consumers. In recent years, some governments have already taken steps to regulate and integrate cryptocurrencies, and these efforts are expected to increase further in the future.\n\nAccording to Prof. Dr. Philipp Sandner: \u201cCryptocurrencies are a vehicle with excellent prospects for the future. They have the potential to overtake conventional financial products while providing more efficiency, less bureaucracy, and more transparency.\u201d While this is not a general take and it is \u2018just\u2019 an opinion, investors have a real knack for taking risks and Bitcoin is considered by many as a risk worth taking.\n\nWe are in the digital age, and the most common investment among Gen Zs is cryptocurrency. A study by the Bank of America says that about 47% of wealthy young US investors invest in cryptocurrency. This is significant.\n\nBitcoin Vs Gold: The \u2018Why\u2019\n\nExperts have opposing opinions on what the future holds for Bitcoin and whether or not it will outperform gold\u2019s performance. Comparisons between Bitcoin and gold are common and have grown over the years.\n\nBut what do Bitcoin and gold have in common that put them in the same category?\n\nWhy is everyone suddenly drawing parallels between a physical precious metal and a digital currency?\n\nThe truth is that, although there are quite marked differences between the two, Bitcoin and gold have several similarities that justify the comparison. One of these is the fact that investors see both assets as a kind of \u201cbearer asset,\u201d that is, a financial instrument that is transferred through possession without the need for formal registration of ownership. Thus, if you hold it, you own it. They are also both \u2018sound money\u2019 that maintains their value and purchasing power over time.\n\nGold has long been considered a crisis-proof currency, but the market\u2019s leading cryptocurrency earned the name Digital Gold in 2020. It mirrored the trajectory of the precious metal and began to emerge as a potential store of wealth as the global economy faltered against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBitcoin, like Gold, also has a limited supply, which prevents excessive asset creation and therefore prevents runaway inflation as we see with fiat currencies. This is in addition to not being controlled by any government or central authority.\n\nAnd, let\u2019s face it, the consensus that Bitcoins fulfill the functions of money as a \u201cunit of value\u201d and \u201cmeans of exchange\u201d is more than justified, with only the function of \u201cstore of value\u201d remaining controversial. There are those who argue that gold has intrinsic value and real utility, unlike Bitcoin. However, only 7.5% of circulating gold is used for industrial purposes. The remainder is used for jewelry making, purchases for investment, and bank reserve purposes, which strongly weakens the \u201cutility\u201d argument.\n\nIn summary, gold is mostly priced and valued based on its speculative nature as a stable reserve of value against inflation. In this sense, it is practically indistinguishable from Bitcoin which has as its intrinsic utility embedded in its function as a peer-to-peer and decentralized transaction network.\n\nBitcoin or Gold: Which Should Invest In?\n\nAlthough both have been placed in the same category of \u201cprotection assets against inflation,\u201d mainly with the collapse of the US banking system driving the search for assets with strong monetary appeal and \u201cfootprint\u201d of the store of value, they are quite far apart from a practical investment point of view.\n\nThe first notable difference is that gold is seen as a more conservative investment and/or as a \u201crisk-free\u201d asset, while Bitcoin still exhibits sharp fluctuation in price and extreme volatility \u2013 thus, a lot of attributed risk. Bitcoin plunged more than 60% of its value in late 2022 and is only now recovering. Critics say, \u201cso much for store of wealth.\u201d\n\nHowever, we must take into account that Bitcoin is still extremely new and we are still \u201cearly adopters.\u201d There is no way to expect stability from an asset on the rise and at the beginning of its S-curve adoption phase. There is usually a process of speculation, usually accompanied by rejection, fear, and, finally, understanding and study until the masses start to feel confident to invest and accept a new idea.\n\nSo does Bitcoin have what it takes to become Gold 2.0?\n\nPerhaps when answering this question one should not think in terms of finding a winner, but rather in terms of knowing both assets for the function they both serve.\n\nBitcoin has barely lasted a decade while Gold has been here for ages. Therefore, issues such as \u2018trust\u2019 or \u2018security\u2019 are under scrutiny of course. However, while these are essential aspects for means of payment or financial investment, what the future holds for Bitcoin remains exciting.\n\nFAQ\n\nCan Bitcoin Replace Gold?\n\nNot yet. Bitcoin still needs to prove itself as a sure-proof store of wealth against an asset that has existed for centuries. Bitcoin market cap will equal Gold\u2019s when 1 BTC is approximately $500,000 \u2013 and experts don\u2019t think this will happen soon.\n\nIs There a Correlation Between BTC and Gold?\n\nYes. Bitcoin\u2019s price chart somewhat correlates with Gold\u2019s. Their correlation currently stands at 50% according to Yahoo.\n\nIs it Better to Invest In Gold or Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is more volatile than Gold and therefore gives significantly more returns on investment. However, increased volatility means increased risk. Digital assets like Bitcoin can appeal to potential investors. Overall, you should invest according to your risk tolerance and appetite.\n\nMore information about markets and utilities for web 3.0 here\n\nGo to top\n\nDisclaimer: This article contains sponsored marketing content.
