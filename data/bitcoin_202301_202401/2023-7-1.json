        "content": "WisdomTree is attempting to launch a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund even though its peers have failed.\n\nThe firm filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last week, making it its second bitcoin ETF application after an initial rejection two years ago.\n\nHowever, WisdomTree's Jeremy Schwartz believes this time could be different.\n\n\"We've been able to successfully launch products in Europe,\" the firm's global chief investment officer said on CNBC's \"ETF Edge\" this week. \"The European regulators have been more friendly, and they've been able to get comfortable with the mechanisms, the custodians [and] how the markets work.\"\n\nThe SEC rejected WisdomTree's previous applications in 2021 and 2022 on the notion they came in short to protect investors and the public interest.\n\nSchwartz hopes the changes made in the firm's updated filing will satisfy regulators.\n\n\"Some of the new filings have these data sharing agreements, surveillance sharing, new ways of doing it,\" he said. \"Now the question is: Will that address the SEC's concern on market manipulation? But that is one of the things I think we're all trying to address.\"\n\nWisdomTree's latest launch effort comes during an increased appetite for bitcoin . As of late Friday, prices are up almost 84% so far this year.\n\n\"It's hard for me to comment too much about all the details while you're in these [filing] periods,\" Schwartz said when \"ETF Edge\" host Bob Pisani asked him why he thinks the SEC will approve the spot bitcoin ETF this time. \"But I think the key is, will the exchanges share data \u2026 and [will the SEC] have more comfort than what was previously done before? I think the data sharing agreements are the key element for that.\"\n\nIt appears interest is climbing.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing this week, Fidelity Investments is also trying to launch a spot bitcoin ETF despite its prior failures. It joins WisdomTree, BlackRock, VanEck and Invesco."

        "content": "Bitcoin traded little changed and Ether gained on Monday morning in Asia, with prices of most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies mixed. Solana added to gains after a slump that followed it being labeled a security by the U.S. financial regulator. Litecoin led winners, still riding the optimism of being included in the tokens trading on the Wall Street-backed EDX Markets exchange that opened on June 20.\n\nMixed crypto\n\nBitcoin added 0.41% to US$30,730.25 over the last 24 hours to 6:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. After a jump that followed a raft of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in the final weeks of June, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has lost direction, adding just 0.61% over the past seven days.\n\nThe U.S. regulator that approves ETFs, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), on Friday indicated it was unimpressed by the Bitcoin ETF applications by financial heavyweights such as Blackrock and Fidelity Investments, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nEther, the world\u2019s second biggest token by market capitalization, added 1.49% to US$1,954.67. It\u2019s gained 2.65% for the seven days.\n\nSolana was among the gainers in mixed early Asia trading for other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The token rose 5.48% to US$19.43 for a weekly gain of 14.47%.\n\nSolana is rallying after a raft of bearish indicators last week, with Solana-based non-fungible token (NFT) protocol Cardinal saying it was shutting down, citing \u201cmacroeconomic challenges.\u201d The Revolut neobank and crypto exchange also reportedly told U.S.-based users last Wednesday that it will delist Solana, along with Cardano and Polygon.\n\nThe three tokens were among cryptocurrencies that the SEC named as illegally issued financial securities in its lawsuit filed last month against the Coinbase and Binance.US exchanges.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum wrote on Twitter on Friday that the tokens don\u2019t deserve to be targeted. \u201cIf ethereum ends up \u201cwinning\u201d through all other blockchains getting kicked off exchanges, that\u2019s not an honorable way to win, and in the long term probably isn\u2019t even a victory.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nLitecoin led the gainers with a 6.37% increase in the last 24 hours to US$112.96. The token surged 27.98% in the past seven days.\n\nLitecoin, which was created in 2011 as a hard fork to Bitcoin, was one of the four tokens selected to trade on the EDX Markets exchange, which is backed by Citadel Securities and Fidelity Investments. The other tokens are Bitcoin, Ether and Bitcoin Cash. The New Jersey-based EDX opened for business despite the crackdown on crypto from U.S. regulators.\n\nThe California-based crypto exchange Kraken was ordered by a U.S. judge on Friday to submit information about its users to the Internal Revenue Service in an investigation of underreported tax liabilities. The crypto exchange was fined US$30 million in February by the SEC for its staking services, which the federal agency said were an offering of unregistered securities.\n\nOther crypto movers included Tron, which dipped 1.85% to US$0.07572, but gained 3.31% for the week. Binance\u2019s BNB token edged down 0.31% to US$247.13, and Cardano\u2019s ADA fell 0.13% to US$0.2905.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap edged up 0.02% to US$1.2 trillion, with trading volume dropping 7.54% to US$27.26 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nNFTs \u201cbrutal weekend\u201d\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index fell 1.49% to 2,910.36 in the 24 hours to 7:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index is down 4.59% for the week.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume dipped 9.68% to US$28.3 million, while volume on Ethereum rose 3.12% to US$22.3 million.\n\n\u201cBrutal weekend for NFTs,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. \u201cIt might be easy to point to Azuki\u2019s Elementals mint as the catalyst still, but lowering average sales and floor prices in top collections prior to Elementals mint showed that we were on the cusp of another free fall.\u201d\n\nThe Azuki Elementals collection began minting last Tuesday and sold out in 15 minutes, but left collectors disappointed as the latest collection looked almost the same as the original.\n\nAzuki founder Alex Xu, who goes by the moniker Zagabond, met with its community last Thursday to address complaints about the mint and Elementals issued a public apology on Twitter, saying they \u201cmissed the mark\u201d and that the new release diluted the value of the popular collection.\n\nEthereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs topped the volume ranking on Cryptoslam at US$3.87 million. Another Ethereum-based collection, The Captainz, came in at second place with US$2.3 million.\n\nOver the weekend, the Memeland team behind The Captainz NFTs, revealed their PFPs or Profile Picture art upgrades for the collection but met with mixed to negative response. \u201cMost negative responses to the art came from people who were unaware that the art would be upgradeable with purchasable traits,\u201d Petscher explained. \u201cWithout these traits the base characters are nearly identical, which caused some confusion in the NFT community.\u201d\n\nU.S. equity futures little changed\n\nU.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen | Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were little changed as of 10:20 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures edged down 0.029%, S&P 500 futures dipped 0.011%, while Nasdaq Futures added 0.068%.\n\nU.S. equities rallied during regular trading on Friday, the last day of the first half of 2023, though face disruptions to trading this week with limited trading hours on Monday and the July 4 public holiday on Tuesday when equity markets will be closed.\n\nEconomic indicators to come this week include US manufacturing activity on Monday as well as a monthly jobs report on Friday. Tesla Inc.\u2019s Sunday announcement of record-breaking vehicle sales in the second quarter is a bullish factor for investors.\n\nJapan equities on Monday gained on the coattails of the Friday rally on Wall Street, with technology stocks leading the gains in Tokyo.\n\nIn China manufacturing slowed, but by less than expected. Both purchasing managers\u2019 Indices in Taiwan and South Korea also showed manufacturing contraction.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is traveling to China in an effort to try and improve communications and the frosty ties between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\n\nInvestors are expecting more interest rate hikes this year in the U.S. following reiterated warnings from Fed Chair Jerome Powell in speeches last week in Europe that inflation has yet to be brought under control.\n\nU.S. interest rates are now between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts an 87.4% chance for a 25-basis-point rate hike at the Fed\u2019s next meeting on July 26 and predicts only a 12.6% chance the Fed will leave rates unchanged.\n\n(Updates to add equities section)"

        "content": "TOKYO -- Bitcoin's position as the top player in the cryptocurrency market is solidifying as the prospect of an inflow of money from institutional investors has lifted the virtual asset to its highest point in a year.\n\nBitcoin touched a year-to-date high above $31,000 last Saturday, amid a surge that followed BlackRock's June 15 application to U.S. regulators for an exchange-traded fund based on the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin's share of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrency assets topped 50% for the first time in more than two years, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission repeatedly rejected filings for bitcoin ETFs not based on futures contracts over the risk of manipulation in the spot bitcoin market.\n\nBlackRock aims to allay these concerns through an expected agreement with Nasdaq, where the fund would be listed, for \"surveillance-sharing\" of a bitcoin trading platform, though The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that the SEC said its filing remains inadequate.\n\nIf the regulator ultimately accepts this solution, hopes are high that it will open the door to more ETFs. BlackRock's filing was followed by a string of applications from other big institutions.\n\nThis month has also seen the launch of EDX Markets, a new digital asset exchange for accredited investors backed by Fidelity, Charles Schwab and Citadel Securities, that will enable trading of bitcoin and Ethereum, among other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe platform says it will follow best practices from traditional bourses, which had been an issue with other cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Binance, which was sued by the SEC this month.\n\nThese developments have reassured some market players that problems like the collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange have not turned institutional investors away from cryptocurrency. Spot bitcoin ETFs are expected to be used by financial institutions as a way to hold the asset with no need for a wallet.\n\nInstitutional money appears to already be moving back into the market. Trading of bitcoin futures contracts has picked up on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and nearly $200 million flowed into major bitcoin investment products last week, the most since July 2022, according to data from CoinShares.\n\n\"Hedge funds specializing in cryptocurrency have recently begun to trade more aggressively with our company,\" said Midori Kanemitsu at Japanese exchange operator bitFlyer.\n\nRetail investors, meanwhile, have been less than enthusiastic this year. The number of active addresses on the bitcoin network has stayed largely flat since late 2021, and the number of new addresses being created each month is down to less than a tenth of its peak that year.\n\nDespite the growing anticipation around bitcoin, \"there's no indication that individuals are starting to trade actively,\" Kanemitsu said.\n\nThis sluggish activity is hitting smaller cryptocurrencies like Cardano and Solana, which are seeing much slower growth than bitcoin. Trading platforms popular with retail investors, such as Robinhood, are moving to end support for trading these tokens, and the risk of an SEC crackdown has made institutional investors even more leery of them."

        "title": "LTC, XMR, AAVE and MKR turn bullish as Bitcoin stalls under $31K - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a narrow range for the past few days, but that doesn\u2019t take away the sheen from its stunning 84% rally in 2023. The strong recovery in Bitcoin\u2019s price has boosted buying in several altcoins, which have risen sharply from their yearly lows.\n\nAs the second half of the year begins, the central question on every investor\u2019s mind is: Will the rally continue? CoinGlass data shows that July has seen only three negative monthly closes since 2013, with the most significant decline being 9.69% in 2014. This suggests that bulls have a slight edge.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nA large part of the latest leg of the rally in Bitcoin and altcoins was fuelled by hopes that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission will approve one or more applications for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. Any adverse news on this front could turn the sentiment bearish and result in a sharp sell-off.\n\nHowever, for now, Bitcoin and select altcoins are showing strength. Let\u2019s analyze the charts of the top five cryptocurrencies that may continue their up-move over the next few days.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin (BTC) continues to trade near the stiff overhead resistance at $31,000. This suggests that the bulls are in no hurry to book profits, as they anticipate another leg higher.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nUsually, a tight consolidation near a crucial overhead resistance resolves to the upside. The rising 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) ($29,278) and the relative strength index (RSI) in the positive territory indicate that the road of least resistance is to the upside.\n\nIf bulls propel and sustain the price above $31,000, the BTC/USDT pair is likely to start the next leg of the uptrend. The bullish momentum may catapult the price above the immediate resistance at $32,400. If that happens, the pair may continue its northward march toward $40,000.\n\nIf bears want to make a comeback, they will have to sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA. The pair could then slide to the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) ($27,622).\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages have flattened out and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. The price has been stuck between $31,431 and $29,500 for some time.\n\nBuyers will have to drive and sustain the price above the $31,431 hurdle to indicate the resumption of the up-move. Alternatively, a break and close below the $29,500 support may start a deeper correction toward $27,500.\n\nLitecoin price analysis\n\nLitecoin (LTC) skyrocketed above the descending channel and the overhead resistance of $106 on June 30, indicating the resumption of the uptrend.\n\nLTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears yanked the price back below the breakout level of $106 on July 1 but the bulls purchased the dip. If buyers sustain the price above $106, it increases the likelihood of the continuation of the rally. The LTC/USDT pair could then soar to the overhead resistance zone between $134 and $144.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price slips and sustains below $106, it will signal that bears are selling at higher levels. That could pull the price to the psychological level of $100 and then to the breakout level from the channel.\n\nLTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that bears are attempting to guard the $112 level with vigor, but they are struggling to sustain the price below $106. This suggests that the bulls are buying at lower levels. The rising 20-EMA and the RSI in the overbought territory indicate that buyers have the edge.\n\nIf the price sustains above $112, the pair may start the next leg of the uptrend toward $126. The first support on the downside is at the 20-EMA and then at $98.\n\nMonero price analysis\n\nMonero (XMR) rose and closed above the downtrend line on June 23, invalidating the developing descending triangle pattern.\n\nXMR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe failure of a bearish pattern is typically a positive sign, as it traps several aggressive bears, resulting in a short squeeze. That could be seen in the XMR/USDT pair, which surged from $150 on June 23 to $171 on June 27.\n\nFollowing the sharp rally, the price has been oscillating between $171 and $160 for the past few days. The consolidation is a positive sign, as it shows that the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate another leg higher.\n\nIf buyers shove the price above $171, the pair may start the next leg of the up-move. The pair may then skyrocket to $187. The bears will have to sink the price back below the 50-day SMA ($149) to seize control.\n\nXMR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows the formation of a symmetrical triangle, which generally acts as a continuation pattern. If buyers push and sustain the price above the triangle, it will suggest that the uncertainty between the bulls and the bears has resolved in favor of the buyers. That could signal the resumption of the up-move. The pattern target of this setup is $182.\n\nThis positive view will invalidate in the near term if the price turns down and plummets below the triangle. The pair could then plunge to $148.\n\nRelated: Why is Litecoin price up today?\n\nAave price analysis\n\nAave (AAVE) has been trading inside a descending channel pattern for the past several weeks. The price turned down from the resistance line of the channel on June 25, but the bulls arrested the correction at the 20-day EMA ($61.69).\n\nAAVE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThis suggests a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. The price has again reached the resistance line. The repeated retest of a resistance level within a short interval tends to weaken it.\n\nThe rising 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers propel and sustain the price above the channel, the AAVE/USDT pair could start a new up-move toward $84.\n\nThe 20-day EMA remains the important support to watch on the downside. A break and close below this level will suggest that the pair may spend some more time inside the channel.\n\nAAVE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up on the four-hour chart and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that buyers are in control. If bulls flip the downtrend line into support, the pair may rise to $76.\n\nAlternatively, if the price sinks and sustains below the downtrend line, it will signal that bears remain active at higher levels. The pair may then slump to the moving averages. A break below the 50-SMA may open the doors for a possible drop to $62 and then to $58.\n\nMaker price analysis\n\nMaker\u2019s MKR (MKR) is attempting to start an up-move. The bulls purchased the dip to the moving averages between June 24 and 28, indicating demand at lower levels.\n\nMKR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($725) has turned up and the RSI is in the overbought territory, indicating that bulls have the upper hand. Buyers pushed the price above the downtrend line on July 2 but the long wick on the candlestick shows strong selling at higher levels.\n\nA minor positive in favor of the buyers is that they have held their ground. This enhances the prospects of a rally above the downtrend line. If that happens, the MKR/USDT pair may soar toward $979. The first sign of weakness will be a drop below $772. That could start a deeper correction toward the 20-day EMA.\n\nMKR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe pair closed above the downtrend line, but the rally is facing selling at higher levels. The bears are trying to trap the aggressive bulls by pulling the price back below the downtrend line. If they do that, the pair could descend to the 20-EMA. This remains the key level to watch out for because a break below it will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.\n\nContrarily, if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above $900, it will suggest that bulls have flipped the downtrend line into support. That could start a rally to $941.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "This Week In Coins: Bitcoin Unmoved, But Proof-of-Work Classics Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin Moon - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nMarket leader Bitcoin had a wobbly week this week. It peaked above $31,100 and bottomed below $29,900, but its variability was limited to less than 2% in any given 24-hour period. After surpassing 50% market dominance last week, the top cryptocurrency settled back to 47.9%, but still sustaining over $9 billion in trading volume.\n\nDespite this ultimately flat week, Bitcoin (BTC) is up 15% over the last two weeks and up 13% over the last month, with a one-year return of more than 50%, according to data from CoinGecko. It currently trades for $30,612, which is more or less where it was seven days ago.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe number one contender, Ethereum (ETH), added 1.9% over the seven days to trade at $1,923 on Saturday.\n\nEarlier in the week, several altcoins that had been labeled as securities by the SEC in its various lawsuits on the industry appeared to finally shake off the effects of the bad press. Polygon (MATIC) and Cardano (ADA) remain virtually unchanged from last week, but Solana (SOL) actually rallied and added 10% to change hands at $18.35.\n\nThere were no significant losses among leading coins but there were several notable rallies of more than 10% this week. Two classic proof-of-work coins ballooned after Wall Street-backed EDX Markets listed them last week: Litecoin (LTC) rallied 18% to $105.18, and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blew up a staggering 52.6% to hit $291.31.\n\nThe week in headlines\n\nOn Monday, Swiss National Bank Chairman Thomas Jordan\u2014speaking at the Point Zero Forum in Zurich\u2014said that a central bank digital currency (CBDC) will be tested on the country\u2019s first regulated crypto exchange called the SIX Digital Exchange (SDX). Jordan was adamant that it was more than a mere trial balloon.\n\n\u201cThis is not just an experiment, it will be real money equivalent to bank reserves,\u201d he told attendees. \u201cThe objective is to test real transactions with market participants.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat same day, HSBC Hong Kong customers became eligible to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum futures Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) on the bank\u2019s \u201cEasy Invest\u201d mobile app.\n\nOn Tuesday, the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs committee announced via Twitter that it reached a consensus on changes to the Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive, including new regulations for crypto assets. This move came in response to lawmakers' calls for stringent rules to prevent \u201cunbacked cryptocurrencies\u201d from infiltrating the traditional financial system.\n\nThe Bank of England\u2019s director of fintech said, meanwhile, that the British central bank was open to the possibility that a British CBDC (or \u201cBritcoin) may not be blockchain-based. The official added that there was conflict at a recent meeting of technologists hosted by the bank to discuss the matter.\n\n\u201cNone of them agreed with each other at any point,\u201d he said, adding that forum contributors \u201cwere not convinced that distributed ledgers offered more efficiency over conventional ledgers.\u201d\n\nOver in Canada, a group of thirty Canadian lawmakers published a report endorsing cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, with 16 recommendations for the country's government to create a national strategy for crypto. The group said the industry has \u201csignificant long-term economic and job creation opportunities.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 was granted Royal Assent by King Charles, officially enshrining new law, according to a press release by the UK government.\n\nUnder the reform bill, crypto trading is recognized as a regulated financial activity. The amended act defines crypto assets as \"cryptographically secured digital representation of value or contractual rights,\" considering them as regulated financial instruments, products, or investments.\n\nFinally, the industry is still reeling from the news a fortnight ago that the world\u2019s largest asset management company, BlackRock, has applied to the SEC for a spot Bitcoin ETF. BlackRock has applied to the SEC with ETF proposals 576 times and has only been rejected once so far.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis week, Fidelity and ARK Invest became the latest companies to redouble their efforts with their own ETF applications since the BlackRock news, joining companies like Invesco, Wisdom Tree, Valkyrie, and Bitwise. However, on Friday, reports appeared to indicate that insiders at the chief U.S. securities regulator believe BlackRock\u2019s and Fidelity\u2019s applications (and by extension, everyone else\u2019s) are inadequate."

Source: TradingView\n\nThose levels continue to hold into the weekend, with the past month marking Bitcoin\u2019s best June performance since 2019.\n\nBy historical standards, July looks even better; throughout its history, BTC price action has never lost more than 10% during the month.\n\nBTC/USD monthly returns (screenshot). Source: CoinGlass\n\nFor CryptoBullet, however, \u201ccommon sense\u201d dictates that BTC/USD should fall below some key moving averages.\n\n\u201cSo, June surprised me. We got a pretty bullish monthly close: BTC tested the the MA50, bounced strongly and managed to regain the EMA21 !\u201d he commented on the monthly chart.\n\n\u201cI can repeat what I said: $BTC can go to 35k (to hunt liquidity), but this mid term bullish rally is coming to an end. Likely this month.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart. Source: CryptoBullet/Twitter\n\nThe concept of liquidity hunting in the low $30,000 zone remains popular as a theory for price continuation.\n\nAmong those tracking it is trading suite DecenTrader, which this week underscored the leveraged short positions stacked toward $35,000.\n\nThis ties in nicely with the massive chunk of #Bitcoin Liquidity, which is loaded all the way above $35k.\n\n\n\nIf we see cascading short liquidations, wicking all the way up to the Moonraker resistance at $37k could be reasonable. https://t.co/JR4J24Ak8H pic.twitter.com/3CEJQ9bvOI \u2014 Decentrader (@decentrader) June 28, 2023\n\nBattle of the monthly Bitcoin charts\n\nElsewhere, a broadly optimistic Rekt Capital was keen for what he called a \u201chealthy technical retest\u201d of levels below $30,000 for Bitcoin, despite the monthly close.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin speculators send 35K BTC to exchanges in new \u2018elation inflow\u2019\n\n\u201cBTC has performed a bullish Monthly close but is primed for a healthy technical retest at ~$29250,\u201d he told Twitter followers on the day.\n\n\u201cWith price currently around $30500\u2026 I wonder what negative catalyst will soon emerge to facilitate this technical retest.\u201d\n\nFurther analysis additionally argued that even if the BTC price were to snap below that downside target, it would constitute nothing \u201cout of the ordinary.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell positioned for upside overall,\u201d Rekt Capital added.\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart.

        "title": "SEC Inaction on Spot Bitcoin ETF a 'Complete and Utter Disaster', Says Cameron Winklevoss - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Cameron Winklevoss slammed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a history of failure on Saturday, noting that it has been ten years since the agency received what he called the first Bitcoin ETF application\u2014and killed it.\n\nThe Winklevoss twins, who cofounded crypto exchange Gemini, first filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF-like trust in July 2013, moving early to establish an investment vehicle that tracks the price of Bitcoin and trades similarly to stock on exchanges like the Nasdaq.\n\nThe Winklevoss\u2019 initial filing, along with a second attempt in 2018, was ultimately rejected by the SEC. While futures-based Bitcoin ETFs have since gotten a regulatory green light in the U.S., the SEC claims that no spot ETF arrangement thus far proposed does enough to protect investors from \u201cfraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.\u201d\n\nSo, on the first filing\u2019s 10-year anniversary, Winklevoss called out the agency for supposedly dragging its feet, recognizing every other application for a spot-based Bitcoin ETF has been stifled as well.\n\n\u201cThe SEC's refusal to approve these products for a decade has been a complete and utter disaster for U.S. investors,\u201d he said, adding that the agency\u2019s reluctance \u201cdemonstrates how the SEC is a failed regulator.\u201d\n\nToday marks 10 years since @tyler and I filed for the first spot Bitcoin ETF. The @SECGov's refusal to approve these products for a decade has been a complete and utter disaster for US investors and demonstrates how the SEC is a failed regulator. Here's why: -\"protected\"\u2026 pic.twitter.com/xmK1xo1iX8 \u2014 Cameron Winklevoss (@cameron) July 2, 2023\n\nThese failures, according to Winklevoss, include cutting investors off from the best investment opportunity of the past decade. Or, as Winklevoss puts it, keeping investors \u201cprotected\u201d from exposure to Bitcoin.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs the crypto market recoiled after the SEC\u2019s bombshell lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase on June 5, BlackRock\u2019s gambit to establish a spot Bitcoin ETF two weeks later reignited optimism on Crypto Twitter and pushed Bitcoin higher. Capping off a wave of Bitcoin ETF applications from other firms that followed\u2014including Invesco, Wisdom Tree, and Valkyrie\u2014Fidelity threw its hat back into the ring last week.\n\nHowever, the SEC believes BlackRock and Fidelity\u2019s recent Bitcoin ETF applications \u201caren\u2019t sufficiently clear and comprehensive,\u201d according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.\n\nWinklevoss asserts that the complete lack of options for spot Bitcoin ETFs has \u201cpushed\u201d U.S. investors toward Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust. Shares in Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin trust, launched in 2013, currently trade at a discount relative to its Bitcoin holdings due to shareholders\u2019 inability to redeem their shares.\n\nWhile Winklevoss called the product \u201ctoxic,\u201d he didn\u2019t mention that converting Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust into an ETF would likely resolve this discount, and the firm is currently suing the SEC over repeated denials to do just that.\n\nWinklevoss has joined a chorus of critics who say SEC Chair Gary Gensler is pushing innovation offshore, and said the agency meanwhile thrust \u201cinvestors into the arms of FTX\u201d and made them victim \u201cto one of the largest financial frauds in modern history.\u201d\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO and founder of FTX, has pleaded not guilty to a litany of charges he faces for conduct at the collapsed exchange, including fraud.\n\nSending investors abroad in search of Bitcoin exposure has also led them to do business with \u201cunlicensed and unregulated venues,\u201d Winklevoss claimed.\n\nGemini and the SEC are not on friendly terms. The regulatory agency accused Gemini of violating securities laws in January, alleging that its \u201cGemini Earn\u201d product constitutes an unregistered securities offering. Retail investors could previously loan their crypto to the now-bankrupt firm Genesis\u2014which was also charged by the SEC\u2014in exchange for interest on deposits.\n\nSEC Calls BlackRock, Fidelity Bitcoin ETF Applications Inadequate: WSJ\n\nNotably, Genesis and Grayscale are both owned by Digital Currency Group. And Genesis and Gemini have been engaged in a spat over a $900 million loan that Gemini extended to the crypto lender.\n\nWinklevoss considered a lawsuit against DCG and company CEO Barry Silbert earlier this year, but Gemini, Genesis, and DCG reached an agreement \u201cin principle\u201d in February. However, Gemini said DCG missed a $630 million loan repayment this past month and risks defaulting on its obligations.\n\nWinklevoss expressed hope that the SEC will \u201creflect on its dismal record\u201d and focus on its stated duties, \u201cinstead of overstepping its statutory power and trying to act like the gatekeeper of economic life.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Winklevoss ended his post with accolades for \u201call those fighting the good fight to bring U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs to life\u201d\u2014which, in practice, may preclude certain companies that have outstanding applications or lawsuits."

        "title": "Ideas for the next Bitcoin halving - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In order to better prepare for Bitcoin\u2019s next halving (the halving of miners\u2019 rewards per validated block of BTC), which is expected to take place around the beginning of 2024, this new article looks at recent movements in the crypto market to try and understand which sectors and tokens are delivering the best performance in this early part of the year.\n\nFigure 1 shows 25 of the top tokens in the crypto landscape. These are the most capitalised (excluding stablecoins) and belong to different sectors such as DeFi (AAVE), Gaming (AXS), Exchanges (BNB), Layer 2 (MATIC) and of course the two main cryptocurrencies BTC and ETH.\n\nFigure 1. Most capitalised crypto yields in early 2023\n\nThe last date taken into account for these calculations is 23/05/2023, while the first date is obviously 01/01/2023. In these first months, most of the stocks under consideration have shown a positive performance.\n\nIn fact, only APE and LUNC show negative returns of -8.73% and -40.54% respectively. We all know by now the sad epilogue of the LUNA project, which saw everything it had built destroyed in a matter of days, leaving many investors on the brink and triggering a chain reaction throughout the sector. APE, on the other hand, a project at the heart of the NFT sector, probably paid for the sharp rise seen in 2022 following its listing on Binance.\n\nCurrently, the best performing cryptocurrency in 2023 is Solana (SOL) with a performance of 98.6%, followed by Fantom (FTM) with a return of 83.6%. Also performing well are Curve (CRV) and Decentraland (MANA) with performances of 65.4% and 60.19% respectively.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) also performed very well, rising from $16607 to $27334 in 2023, a positive result of 64.6%. Ethereum (ETH) is a little further down the list, up a good 54.29%.\n\nScrolling down the list, a number of altcoins from different sectors stand out, such as Cardano (ADA) with 48.37%, SandBox (SAND) with 32.56% and so on.\n\nAmong the worst performers are Dogecoin (DOGE), which is hovering around parity (3.9% to be precise), Axie Infinity (AXS) with a slight increase (considering the volatility of the crypto sector) of 9.31% in 2023, and of course the aforementioned APE and LUNC.\n\nThese results might suggest that a new rally in cryptos is on the horizon, but in reality the road back to the highs of recent months is still a distant mirage for most of them. Indeed, in Figure 1, in the column labelled ATH (all-time high), it can be seen that the distance between the current price and the all-time high is still very large.\n\nSuffice it to say that despite bitcoin\u2019s recent rise of 64.6%, the distance from the all-time high is still very pronounced (-60.37%). For altcoins, the figure is even worse, with tokens well over 90% away from all-time highs.\n\nAll of this means that, as can be seen in Figure 2, to recover these drawdowns and return to historical highs, there needs to be a much bigger rally than we have seen so far. In fact, to recover a 50% drawdown would require a 100% positive performance. Similarly, to recover a 60% drawdown, a 150% performance is required, and so on down to 90%, where a 900% rally is required to return to historical highs.\n\nFigure 2. Summary table of the yield required to recover a drawdown\n\nThis period in history could certainly be a good time for those who believe in these projects to accumulate some cryptocurrencies, given the strong drawdowns and the imminent halving of bitcoin, but beware, it is by no means a given that cryptocurrencies that have experienced drawdowns of over 90% can definitively recover the lost ground.\n\nCryptocurrencies are a highly volatile market, as evidenced by the figures we have seen so far, and this implies that one should treat them with extreme caution, without committing too much of one\u2019s capital, or at least the percentage of one\u2019s account that one is willing to lose up to 90-95% of one\u2019s investment.\n\nAll in all, 2023 continues to recover from the strong drawdowns of 2022, but there is still a long way to go. So watch out for movements between now and early 2024, when we will see the halving of bitcoin, which historically has been the start of all rallies seen in bitcoin (and other cryptos as well) since its inception.\n\nUntil next time!\n\nAndrea Unger"
