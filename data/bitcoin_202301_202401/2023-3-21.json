        "title": "Crypto Is Mostly Over. Its Carbon Emissions Are Not. - The Atlantic",
        "content": "Sign up for The Weekly Planet, The Atlantic\u2019s newsletter about living through climate change, here.\n\nAt this point, for most of us, cryptocurrency seems like nothing more than a fad. After the FTX bankruptcy and broader crypto crash last year, basically all of the celebrities who were promoting crypto have gone silent. \u201cMiamiCoin,\u201d hyped by Miami Mayor Francis Suarez as a new source of income for the city, is now worthless. The Wild West days of the industry may be over. Recently, the head of the SEC warned crypto firms to \u201cdo their work within the bounds of the law\u201d or face enforcement actions. Lots of people lost money in the crash, but from the planet\u2019s perspective, the industry\u2019s downfall is good news: The computing power fueling the crypto boom was so substantial that it was causing substantial greenhouse-gas emissions.\n\nAnd yet crypto\u2019s greenhouse-gas emissions are still shockingly high, according to an industry tracker run by the University of Cambridge. The tracker focuses on bitcoin, the cryptocurrency with by far the largest market share, and estimates that at its current rate of \u201cmining\u201d new coins, bitcoin will release about 62 megatons of \u201ccarbon-dioxide equivalent\u201d each year\u2014about as much as the entire country of Serbia emitted in 2019. That\u2019s up from about 43 megatons a year in December, and just slightly below the all-time peak of nearly 74 in May 2021. Many people who\u2019ve invested in crypto tend to have a lot of sunk costs, whether digital wallets bulging with various coins, tokens, or expensive physical setups designed to make more. Even now that the boom times are over, they have no reason to stop.\n\nMining bitcoin does not involve actually digging anything out of the ground\u2014unless you count the fossil fuel that often powers it. The process involves using heavy-duty computers to grind through trillions of calculations, solving equations to create virtual coins. The method is known as \u201cproof of work.\u201d Once upon a time, bitcoin mining was something that people did if they had a couple of spare computers they wanted to put to work. Over time, it\u2019s taken more and more computing power to unlock a single coin; now most mining is done in large-scale operations using purpose-built mining rigs.\n\nAnd it is America\u2019s problem now. After China clamped down on crypto mining in 2021, such computing work increased in the United States. Miners set up shop in communities with low energy prices. And owners of unprofitable power-generation infrastructure, such as waste-coal-burning power plants, opened up crypto-mining operations to create another revenue stream. These companies have put a lot of money into their hardware and their physical space, and they will continue mining until they are actively losing money. \u201cThere are miners that have been quoted saying, \u2018As long as the price is over $10,000 per coin, it still can generate money,\u2019\u201d Elizabeth Moran, a policy advocate at the green law firm Earthjustice, told me. And that is a big reason crypto keeps spewing out so many emissions even during the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d: Bitcoin prices in particular have held up, in fact they just passed $28,000 a coin. That\u2019s still far below their peak of almost $68,000 in late 2021, but represents a bit of a comeback from the sub-$16,000 prices of last fall.\n\nSo it is still very possible to make money at this game. Some companies bypass the energy grid entirely; depending on the price of gas and the price of bitcoin, turning natural gas into crypto might be twice as profitable as selling it to the wholesale gas market. Gas companies bring in a trailer or three jam-packed with generators, plugging one end into the well and the other into \u201cshipping containers full of bitcoin miners,\u201d says Rob Altenburg, the senior director for energy and climate at PennFuture, an environmental nonprofit. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard of three different companies doing it. But we\u2019ve got thousands of fracked gas wells across the state and just simply have no way of knowing where this is happening.\u201d Gas drilling is heavily regulated, but crypto mining itself is not.\n\nA recent federal investigation in Colorado found crypto mining powered by gas wells on public-lease lands, creaming energy off before it hit the grid and converting it to crypto without paying any royalties. The report noted that because the generators and rigs are usually on trailers, the entire operation can be moved quickly, so miners can stay ahead of government oil and gas inspectors. Other \u201cbehind-the-meter\u201d operations are physically located at power plants. The natural-gas-fired Greenidge Generation Station, on the shores of Seneca Lake in upstate New York, opened a massive bitcoin-mining operation plugged right into the plant, which in 2021 consumed the bulk of the electricity it produced. Tapping into energy before it hits the grid is just one way bitcoin miners keep costs down; they\u2019ll seek out and exploit any cheap source of energy.\n\nCrypto doesn\u2019t have to torch the planet. The second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, switched to a different method of creating its tokens in September 2022. The new approach, called \u201cproof of stake,\u201d uses significantly less computing power, so much so that after the switch, the company\u2019s total energy consumption dropped 99.95 percent. \u201cIt is impossible for bitcoin to switch to proof of stake, because the bitcoin network is completely decentralized,\u201d Kyle Schneps, the director of public policy at Foundry, a major mining financier, told me. \u201cThere is no governing body that could make such a decision.\u201d\n\nRenewables could also power bitcoin mining, just like they power anything else. Maybe as much as 38 percent of bitcoin mining is currently powered by renewables, according to the Cambridge tracker, though no one really knows. But that hasn\u2019t gone up since the crypto winter. Schneps said that bitcoin mining could help with the energy transition: Renewable-energy companies can always sell their energy to bitcoin miners when demand is otherwise low, keeping them profitable enough to stay in business and grow. But it\u2019s not clear if mining operations that run only at certain times would be profitable.\n\nFor now, bitcoin will remain an albatross on the planet at just the moment that the energy transition ramps up. Cambridge predicts that its environmental impact in 2023 will be worse than it was in 2022. The Super Bowl ads and awkward late-night celebrity endorsements may be gone, but crypto is not dead. Still embraced by true believers and international criminals, the hard drives grind on, in shipping containers and empty warehouses and back lots of power plants, endlessly calculating, spinning money out of carbon and faith.\n\nLots of other digital activities do consume power and cause greenhouse-gas emissions\u2014questing with pals, hoarding years of work emails on the cloud, making friends with a hallucinating AI. One analysis in 2019 suggested that our online lives were responsible for 3.7 percent of planet-wide emissions; the number may have gone up since. Schneps likened bitcoin\u2019s global electricity consumption to \u201croughly the same as video games.\u201d But even if that\u2019s true, while two-thirds of Americans play video games, just 21 percent of Americans own crypto, and even less bitcoin in particular. The massive environmental impact of bitcoin is harder to swallow because it is part of an industry that is, in essence, \u201csmoke and mirrors,\u201d as the crypto blogger James Block put it in an interview with Charlie Warzel. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing produced by these companies.\u201d\n\nFinance experts around the world largely agree with Block. In December, a director-general at the European Central Bank, Ulrich Bindseil, called for serious financial institutions to stop legitimizing cryptocurrency, saying bitcoin was \u201cnot suitable as an investment.\u201d If the world is going to continue to burn fossil fuels, it makes sense to do so for things that genuinely contribute to people\u2019s well-being, not for risky virtual tokens untethered to any real thing of value in the world."

Ether fell 4.1% to $1,726.58, following a big move higher on Tuesday.\n\nThe Fed enacted a quarter percentage point interest rate increase at the conclusion of its latest policy meeting, expressing caution about the recent banking crisis and indicating that hikes are nearing an end. Fed projections call for just one more hike this year.\n\nA 25 basis point increase was widely anticipated. The decision makes it the ninth consecutive interest rate hike and the second quarter-point increase in a row after a series of bigger rate hikes were implemented throughout 2022.\n\n\"The hope was that the long-awaited dovish tone from the Fed would finally arrive in the midst of this banking crisis. Those hopes were dashed by Powell's comments that rate hikes could continue as long as things continued to stabilize, weakening some of the momentum that has been leading crypto's rise in recent days,\" said Michael Safai at the crypto trading firm Dexterity Capital.\n\n\"A lot of what has driven the latest bitcoin rally \u2013 the ongoing weakness in the banking system and the potential for increases in central bank balance sheets \u2013 hasn't disappeared completely,\" he added. \"This could provide a floor for cryptocurrencies once the broader institutional reaction to the Fed settles down.\""

        "title": "The Institutionalization of Bitcoin: Effects on Price and Adoption - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Bitcoin's rise has been one of the most significant financial events in the last decade. Bitcoin has grown from its humble beginnings as a decentralized, peer-to-peer payment system to a global phenomenon, with a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion as of March 2023.\n\nHowever, as Bitcoin has grown in popularity, it has also grown in institutionalization, with large financial institutions and corporations investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In this article, we will look at how institutionalization affects the price and adoption of Bitcoin.\n\nWhat Is Institutionalization?\n\nThe process by which a new financial asset or technology is adopted by mainstream financial institutions such as banks, hedge funds, and pension funds is referred to as institutionalization. Increased liquidity, price stability, and broader adoption of the asset or technology can result from institutionalization.\n\nInstitutionalization has taken various forms in the case of Bitcoin. Large financial institutions, such as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, have begun to offer their clients Bitcoin-related investment products.\n\nKeep Reading Will Blockchain Technology Mark a Turning Point in Fraud Prevention?\n\nBitcoin has been used as a store of value by major corporations such as Tesla and MicroStrategy. Furthermore, regulatory bodies such as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have begun to provide guidance on the regulation of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Impact of Institutionalization on the Bitcoin Price\n\nBitcoin's price has been significantly influenced by its institutionalization. Bitcoin's price was highly volatile in its early days, with large price swings occurring on a regular basis. However, as more institutional investors have entered the market, the price has stabilized.\n\nA variety of factors have contributed to this increased stability. For starters, institutional investors are typically long-term investors who prioritize portfolio diversification and risk management.\n\nThis means they are less likely to sell their Bitcoin holdings during market volatility, which can help to limit price swings.\n\nFurthermore, institutional investors frequently invest large sums of money in Bitcoin, which can help to keep the price stable. For example, when Tesla announced in February 2021 that it had invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, the price of Bitcoin increased by more than 10% in a single day.\n\nBitcoin's increased stability has also made it a more appealing investment for traditional investors like pension funds and endowments. These investors typically have strict investment policies that require them to invest in low-volatility assets. As Bitcoin becomes more stable, these investors are more likely to consider adding it to their portfolios.\n\nInstitutionalization's Influence on Bitcoin Adoption\n\nBitcoin's institutionalization has also had a significant impact on its adoption. In the early days of Bitcoin, it was primarily used for peer-to-peer transactions by individuals and small businesses. However, as more institutions have entered the market, Bitcoin has begun to gain acceptance as a form of payment.\n\nPayPal, for example, began allowing its users to buy, hold, and sell Bitcoin in late 2020. This move was interpreted as a significant endorsement of Bitcoin by a mainstream financial institution, and it aided in increasing adoption by making it easier for people to buy and sell Bitcoin.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin's institutionalization has helped to improve its reputation and build trust among mainstream investors. Bitcoin was initially associated with illegal activities, such as money laundering and drug trafficking.\n\nHowever, as more institutions have invested in Bitcoin and regulatory authorities have issued guidance on its use, it has gained acceptance as a legitimate asset.\n\nInstitutionalization's Difficulties\n\nWhile Bitcoin has benefited greatly from institutionalization, it has also presented some challenges. One of the most significant challenges is the possibility of market manipulation by large institutional investors.\n\nIf a small group of investors controls a significant portion of the Bitcoin market, they may be able to manipulate the price by purchasing or selling large amounts of Bitcoin.\n\nFurthermore, the increased regulatory scrutiny that comes with institutionalization may pose difficulties for Bitcoin. Regulatory authorities may impose restrictions on the use of cryptocurrencies or impose strict reporting requirements on institutions. Institutions that invest in Bitcoin may incur additional costs and administrative burdens as a result of this.\n\nFinally, Bitcoin's increasing centralization may raise concerns about the decentralization that was one of its founding principles. As more institutions become involved in Bitcoin, the risk of it becoming more centralized and controlled by a small group of investors or institutions increases.\n\nWill Institutionalization Correlate with BTC\u2019s Demise?\n\nBitcoin has been the topic of many debates since its inception in 2009. As Bitcoin has gained more attention and popularity, the possibility of its institutionalization has become a growing concern among its supporters.\n\nThe institutionalization of Bitcoin refers to the process of large financial institutions such as banks, hedge funds, and investment firms incorporating Bitcoin into their business models. While some argue that this would increase the adoption and legitimacy of the cryptocurrency, others believe that it would ultimately lead to the end of Bitcoin.\n\nOne of the reasons why the institutionalization of Bitcoin could lead to its demise is because it goes against the core principles of the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin was created as an alternative to the traditional financial system, which is dominated by large institutions that control the flow of money. By allowing these institutions to incorporate Bitcoin into their business models, it could lead to a concentration of power and influence in the hands of a few players, which would defeat the purpose of decentralization.\n\nAnother reason why the institutionalization of Bitcoin could lead to its downfall is the potential for increased regulation. As Bitcoin becomes more mainstream and widely used, governments may feel compelled to regulate it more heavily. This could lead to restrictions on the use of Bitcoin and make it less attractive to individuals who value its anonymity and lack of government oversight.\n\nFurthermore, the institutionalization of Bitcoin would also likely correlate with increased volatility in the cryptocurrency market. Large financial institutions have a significant amount of power and influence in the financial world, and their participation in the Bitcoin market could lead to rapid fluctuations in its value. This could make it difficult for individuals and businesses to use Bitcoin as a stable store of value or medium of exchange.\n\nLastly, the process could likely lead to the creation of alternative cryptocurrencies that better align with the principles of decentralization. As Bitcoin becomes more mainstream, some individuals may become disillusioned with its institutionalization and seek out alternative cryptocurrencies that are more in line with their values. This could lead to a fragmentation of the cryptocurrency market, which could ultimately weaken Bitcoin's position as the dominant cryptocurrency.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin's price and adoption have been significantly influenced by its institutionalization. Institutional investors have helped to stabilize the market and improve Bitcoin's reputation among mainstream investors.\n\nAs a result, Bitcoin has grown in popularity and is increasingly being used as a form of payment.\n\nHowever, institutionalization has brought with it new challenges, such as the possibility of market manipulation and increased regulatory scrutiny.\n\nIt is critical for the Bitcoin community to prioritize decentralization and ensure that the benefits of institutionalization do not come at the expense of the fundamental principles that distinguish Bitcoin.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how institutionalization shapes Bitcoin's development as it evolves and matures. It is clear that institutionalization has had a significant impact on Bitcoin in recent years, but how this will play out in the future remains to be seen."

        "content": "Magic Eden, one of the largest cross-chain NFT platforms, launched a Bitcoin marketplace for digital artifacts, the company shared on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe are already a multichain platform and believe that adding Bitcoin will connect us to a deep community of people and a rapidly growing collectibles market thanks to Ordinals,\u201d Zhuoxun Yin, COO and co-founder of Magic Eden, said to TechCrunch. \u201cAdding a Bitcoin marketplace allows us to continue our multichain vision.\u201d\n\nOrdinals, an NFT-like project on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, has grown significantly since the first one was inscribed in December. By mid-February, over 90,000 Ordinals were inscribed \u2014 which is jargon for created (or minted) \u2014 on the Bitcoin blockchain. About a month later, there are more than 400,000 inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain, up 344% during that time frame, Magic Eden shared.\n\nPrior to the announcement, Magic Eden supported NFT trading on Solana and Polygon and provided aggregated listings for Ethereum-based NFTs. The platform is supported by major firms like Paradigm, Sequoia, Coinbase Ventures, Solana Ventures and others, and has more than 22 million unique monthly visitors and over 100,000 wallets connecting to its network daily, its website stated.\n\nMagic Eden launching a Bitcoin marketplace could be a significant step forward because there are limited tools and products for the blockchain\u2019s trading market, which has made the space inaccessible and unsafe for nonprofessional users. Going forward, this could expand its reach to a bigger audience.\n\nThe launch will also integrate two noncustodial crypto wallets, Hiro and Xverse, so users can process transactions.\n\n\u201cThe Bitcoin NFT ecosystem is very new and a lot of the tooling that exists today is not optimal and lacks robust security measures,\u201d Yin said. \u201cWe want to come in with a serious focus on security and transparency while leveraging our brand so that people can feel safe when trading their Ordinals, thus opening up the ecosystem to flourish even more.\u201d\n\nAs the overall NFT market continues to grow, the subsector is still discovering its product-market fit, Yin thinks. \u201cThe growth of Bitcoin NFTs indicates that there\u2019s a market for people who want to own true digital artifacts or collectibles.\u201d\n\nMagic Eden has \u201calways taken a long-term view\u201d that NFTs will be the center of culture over many years, Yin said.\n\nWhile NFTs have gained popularity within the crypto industry, the mainstream world is still slow to adopt it, even though major brands and companies like Starbucks, Adidas and Nike have launched initiatives in the past year to implement NFT-like products and services.\n\nFor Magic Eden\u2019s initial beta launch of its Bitcoin Marketplace, it selected 13 collections to partner with, including Taproot Wizards, Inscribed Pepes and Bitcoin Bandits, to name a few. Those collections were selected because they were some of the earliest to be inscribed and have the \u201cstrongest communities,\u201d Yin said. \u201cWe see value in partnering with early adopters as many of them have been pioneers for Ordinal theory as well as contributors to Bitcoin\u2019s culture for many years.\u201d\n\nIn the near future, all Bitcoin inscriptions will be available for trading on Magic Eden, Yin noted. In the long term, Magic Eden plans to continue building out new use cases on new chains.\n\n\u201cDespite where the market is at, we are continuing to build in the bear and we\u2019re showing people that we are doubling down on our commitment to the long-term potential for NFTs,\u201d Yin added."

        "title": "Bitcoin shines but here's why altcoins failed to catch up amid banking crisis - Business Today",
        "content": "The recent banking crisis in the US and Europe has sparked a strong rally in Bitcoin, but other crypto assets have been unable to translate this action into their prices. A majority of the altcoins have underperformed the largest crypto asset in the near-term price appreciation.\n\n\n\nIn the last two weeks, Bitcoin's price has jumped more than 40 per cent to $28,250 on Wednesday, March 22, 2023. The largest crypto asset was trading at around $19,950 on March 10, 2023. However, other major tokens including Ethereum, BNB, Cardano, XRP have failed to perform on a similar line.\n\n\n\nAnalysts said that bitcoin is always seen as a store of value and amid the banking crisis in some of the strongest economies of the world and gloomy macroeconomic sentiments, its safe-haven appeal has increased and investors are lapping up the digital token.\n\n\n\nEdul Patel, Co-founder and CEO at Mudrex said that factors such as banking sector instability, high inflation data and reduced confidence in a dovish Federal Reserve have pushed the demand for Bitcoin, which is trading near its nine-month highs.\n\n\n\n\"Bitcoin can act as a hedge against inflation and a bet against the devaluing US dollar and investors prefer it over altcoins. Investor's trust in Bitcoin as a secure store of value is reflected in its increasing value, rather than a general sentiment towards cryptocurrencies that rely heavily on their ecosystem fundamentals,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe dominance of Bitcoin in the total crypto market has increased to more than 46 per cent on Wednesday, according to the data from Coinmarketcap. The total market capitalization of Bitcoin is around $550 billion, while the crypto market is commanding a cumulative marketcap of $1.18 trillion.\n\n\n\nBitcoin has experienced a significant rally over the past few days. However, when looking at the overall crypto market cap, it has only increased by 8% to $1.17 trillion. This implies that there is a lack of significant fresh investment entering the market, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\n\n\n\"The uncertainty surrounding stablecoins and illiquid assets in the banking sector has caused individuals to move from stablecoins to Bitcoin instead of depositing their money in banks,\" it said. \"The market direction will be determined by the outcome of Fed's FOMC meeting.\"\n\n\n\nBitcoin is also considered sensitive to changes in money supply, and as such, many have argued that the increase in the size of the Fed's balance sheet is the key driver of the rally, said Rajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX.\n\n\n\n\"Last week, the Fed and its allies effectively bailed out the depositors of SVB. As part of this bailout, the Fed had to increase its balance sheet by $300 billion. The Fed printed 300 billion new dollars, given that Bitcoin was built in response to the 2008 bank bailouts. BTC's price went parabolic in response to the SVB bailout,\" he added.\n\n\n\nAnalysts said that Bitcoin is the oldest and most known crypto asset among investors. Interestingly, not only bitcoin, gold is also gaining momentum but its counterpart silver is unable to catch up with the rise.\n\n\n\nNew investors in the crypto space tend to gravitate towards the more established coins, such as Bitcoin over taking risks on relatively unknown Altcoins. The recent rise in Bitcoin's price and the attention it's been getting in the news may also be bringing in more mainstream investors and institutions, which would make it even more dominant on the market, said Menon from WazirX.\n\nAlso read: Hindustan Zinc shares jump 5% after dividend announcement; here's what analysts say\n\nAlso read: Crypto Price Today: Bitcoin tops $28,000; XRP, Cardano, Dogecoin rally up to 21%"

        "title": "Bitcoin at $100,000? Insiders say the cryptocurrency could test new highs this year - CNBC",
        "content": "In this article BTC.BS=-USS\n\nBTC.CB=\n\nBTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nwatch now\n\nBitcoin has rallied nearly 70% so far this year \u2014 and industry insiders who spoke to CNBC remain bullish, with one saying the world's biggest cryptocurrency could reach new heights. Bitcoin previously hit its all-time high of $68,990.90 in November 2021. Since then it has fallen about 60%. Marshall Beard, chief strategy officer at U.S.-headquartered cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, said $100,000 could be a possibility for bitcoin. \"I think bitcoin probably breaks all-time highs this year,\" Beard said, adding that the $100,000 price figure is an \"interesting number.\" Beard said that if bitcoin gets to its previous record high of near $69,000, \"it doesn't take much more for it to lift up\" to $100,000. Bitcoin would need to rally around 270% to hit $100,000.\n\nPaolo Ardoino, chief technology officer at stablecoin issuer Tether, said bitcoin could \"retest\" its all-time high near $69,000. The predictions of new record highs mark a more optimistic outlook than in January when industry executives told CNBC that they expected 2023 to be a year of caution.\n\nIs bitcoin finally becoming 'digital gold'?\n\nPart of the industry's positive view on bitcoin right now actually stems from how the asset has performed during the banking turmoil sparked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the failure of two crypto-friendly lenders Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank. Instead of crashing, bitcoin rallied. Bitcoin proponents say this is evidence that bitcoin is offering an alternative to the traditional banking system as a place for people to keep their money safe. \"I think the rally is explicable by saying, people have got freaked out by the banking system by the collapses,\" Oliver Linch, CEO of Bittrex Global, told CNBC in an interview at Paris Blockchain Week on Thursday.\n\nBitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, has been stealthily rising in 2023. Chris Ratcliffe | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nFor many years, bitcoin advocates have argued bitcoin is a form of \"digital gold\" \u2014 a safe-haven asset that can provide investors a hedge against inflation and an investment in times of turmoil. But over the past few years, bitcoin has traded in correlation with stocks, in particular the tech-heavy Nasdaq. There are now signs of decoupling with bitcoin massively outperforming the Nasdaq, many other risk-assets and gold this year. But bitcoin also got a boost on hopes the banking crisis maybe reduce the U.S. Federal Reserve's ability to be as aggressive on interest rate rises, which would be supportive for risk assets like cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe $1 million bitcoin bet\n\nDiscussion of where the digital coin's price could go this year has been rife since Balaji Srinivasan, an investor and the former technology chief at Coinbase, wagered on Mar. 17 that bitcoin would be worth $1 million or more in 90 days. He bet $2 million. The wager was in response to a Twitter user who said that they would bet $1 million that the U.S. does not enter hyperinflation. Srinivasan argued that the \"world redenominates on Bitcoin as digital gold\" as hyperinflation kicks in, erodes the value of the U.S. dollar, and nations, individuals and companies begin to buy large amounts of bitcoin. Hyperinflation is the massive rise in prices in an economy.\n\nI think for bitcoin to be a million dollars in 90 days, some crazy things are happening in the world, which we don't want. Marshall Beard Chief strategy officer, Gemini"

        "content": "Over St. Patrick's Day weekend, unidentified hackers stole more than $1.6 million in cryptocurrency from Bitcoin ATMs owned by General Bytes.\n\nIn what the ATM owner called a security incident of the highest severity, threat actors were able to exploit a zero-day flaw by uploading \"his own java application remotely via the master service interface used by terminals to upload videos, and run it using batm user privileges,\" the advisory released by General Bytes stated.\n\nOnce the attackers were able to accomplish this, they secured access to the database, where they were able to \"read and decrypt API keys used to access funds in hot wallets and exchanges, send funds from hot wallets, and download usernames, password hashes\" as well as turn off the two-factor authentication (2FA) feature.\n\nThis cryptocurrency-related breach is the second aimed at General Bytes in under a year, the last of which occurred less than a year ago, in August.\n\nThough the company has stated that it has run multiple security audits since 2021, this was a vulnerability that was never caught. General Bytes advises its terminal operator customers to keep their servers behind firewalls and VPNs, as well as assume that the passwords and API keys to exchanges and hot wallets used by end users are compromised \u2014 and should be changed accordingly."

        "content": "As the next Bitcoin halving approaches, industry experts are closely examining the implications for price and hash rate over a long-term horizon.\n\nThe halving event, set to occur around mid-April 2024, is expected to have a significant impact on the crypto market, according to a report published Monday by research firm BitOoda.\n\nThe report suggests the key driver of bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price is the flow of funds into the ecosystem \u2014 currently amounting to about $25 million per day \u2014 to absorb the roughly 900 new BTC entering circulation through mining; blocks are mined, on average, every 10 minutes, minting 6.25 bitcoins each.\n\nAt the halving, the supply of new bitcoins received by miners \u2014 also known as the coinbase reward \u2014 is reduced by half. This happens all at once, from one bitcoin block to the next.\n\nThe report also notes sentiment can play a role in price discovery \u2014 where the investors see the bitcoin market going.\n\nLooking at historical data, BitOoda said the six months following each of the prior halvings have seen an increase in price, with the most significant increase occurring after the first halving in 2012 when the price surged more than ten times its value.\n\nIn 2016, bitcoin\u2019s price increased by 53% six months post-halving while the 2020 halving was preceded by a mostly flat price \u2014 excluding the exogenous shock of the March COVID-driven sell-off, 60 days prior to the event, BitOoda said. Bitcoin\u2019s price then gained more than 70% over the following 180 days.\n\nWhile the dollar value of mined BTC initially fell after each halving, the post-halving fund flows have always caused the price to recover throughout Bitcoin\u2019s history, data by CryptoQuant shows.\n\nThe effect has become more muted over time, CryptoQuant told Blockworks, with the impact of each halving\u2019s reduction in supply, diminishing relative to other factors.\n\n\u201cAdoption, institutional demand, easier access to bitcoin and macro factors become more important for bitcoin\u2019s price growth,\u201d Julio Moreno, CryptoQuant\u2019s head of research, said.\n\nPrice of bitcoin compared against the flows of capital to derivative exchanges | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nMoreno pointed out that when capital flows are growing \u2014 meaning demand to trade bitcoin is increasing \u2014 the asset appreciates and vice versa.\n\nThe Bitcoin price correlation to hash rate\n\nThe Bitcoin ecosystem is likely to continue experiencing significant growth in the coming years, with both price and hash rate expected to increase steadily leading up to the next halving event in 2024, the report notes.\n\nPrice moves tend to lead hash rate, with sustained hash rate growth typically driven by price appreciation, the firm said, although this is debated.\n\nThe Bitcoin network\u2019s hash rate is a measure of the computing power dedicated to the network by miners worldwide. It represents the total number of hashes that can be performed by all miners in a given period and is measured in exahashes per second (EH/s).\n\nBased on data from YCharts, the current bitcoin network hash rate is 320.42 EH/s \u2014 up about 51% from a year ago but down 8.6% on the day.\n\nThe increase in hash rate over the past year is likely due to the increasing number of miners joining the network, as well as the adoption of more powerful mining equipment.\n\nThis has resulted in greater competition for mining rewards and an increase in the network\u2019s overall security.\n\nThe increasing number of bitcoin miners is a reflection of the improving market sentiment, as seen in the upward movement of spot prices for digital assets. This comes at a time when industry participants are re-evaluating a risk-on approach to protect wealth.\n\nAn analysis of hash rate scenarios shows a link to the estimated power price curve, suggesting the convergence of ASIC technology to leading-edge semiconductor processes will bring next-gen hardware to the market in late 2023, with volume shipments expected in 2024.\n\n\u201cAs more powerful and efficient ASICs have been developed, hashrate has experienced an acceleration as miners enjoy a lower capital and operational cost per terahash deployed,\u201d Moreno said. \u201cThe latest generation of ASICs are about 50% to 100% more powerful than the previous models.\u201d\n\nBitOoda estimates the theoretical \u201cmarginal maximum hashrates\u201d could achieve 432 EH/s by the end of 2023 and 721 EH/s by the end of 2024, assuming power prices remain below $50 per megawatt hour.\n\nThough the reality is likely to be closer to 400 EH/s by the end of 2023, reflecting a significant amount of older equipment still in use, the research firm said.\n\nLonger term, the security of the Bitcoin network will depend more on transaction fees. Miners\u2019 production costs will become less a function of their expectations of coinbase rewards, as Satoshi observed.\n\n\u201cIn later years, when new coin generation is a small percentage of the existing supply, market price will dictate the cost of production more than the other way around,\u201d Satoshi wrote in 2010.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency among American adults. It\u2019s easy to open a bitcoin account: in this article, we\u2019ll provide several ways of doing it and straightforward guidance.\n\nOpening a bitcoin account is quick and easy\n\nOpening a bitcoin (BTC) account is as easy as installing an app on your mobile device or laptop. Once you install the app, your bitcoin wallet will automatically be created. However, you\u2019ll have to decide what specific bitcoin wallet you want.\n\nJust because you can store bitcoin digitally doesn\u2019t mean you should keep it just anywhere. If you plan to open a bitcoin account, this guide will tell you everything you need to know.\n\nWhat is a bitcoin wallet\n\nBitcoin wallets can store cryptocurrency holdings like bitcoin, ethereum (ETH) and XRP. This digital storage device contains private keys to access and spend your coins. They come in many forms, including physical hardware devices, software applications, and even paper printouts. You can use your bitcoin wallet to send and receive payments and store funds securely offline in so-called cold storage.\n\nMost bitcoin wallets put you in control of your private keys, meaning you are responsible for keeping your bitcoins secure. Depending on how diligent you are about using your private keys, this can be advantageous or disadvantageous.\n\nHow does a bitcoin wallet work\n\nJust like you need a physical wallet to store your cash and credit cards, a bitcoin wallet is where you store your bitcoins. But unlike a physical wallet, a bitcoin wallet is entirely digital and functions like an email address. You must log into your account using your private key, access your cryptocurrency, and send amounts to the intended recipients.\n\nThere are two main types of bitcoin wallets:\n\nHot wallet: Hot wallets store bitcoin private keys on internet-connected devices. While they are easy and convenient to use, they can pose a significant security risk to bitcoin holders who lose their primary device. If you open a bitcoin account, only use a hot wallet to store small amounts of crypto.\n\nHot wallets store bitcoin private keys on internet-connected devices. While they are easy and convenient to use, they can pose a significant security risk to bitcoin holders who lose their primary device. If you open a bitcoin account, only use a hot wallet to store small amounts of crypto. Cold wallet: Cold wallets store bitcoin private keys offline. They are highly secure and eliminate any risk of compromise by hackers.\n\nHow to open a bitcoin account: step-by-step\n\nNow that you know the basics of bitcoin, it\u2019s time to open an account. Follow these simple steps:\n\nGo to any cryptocurrency exchange website that supports bitcoin, such as Coinbase, Kraken, or Bitstamp. Enter your email address and a strong password. You\u2019ll receive a verification code in your email. Once you verify your account, you can start depositing funds immediately. There are many ways to transfer funds, including bank transfers and credit cards. Once you\u2019ve deposited your funds, you can buy and sell bitcoin.\n\nTypes of wallets you can open\n\nLike physical wallets, there are many bitcoin wallets to choose from. Each has its advantages and disadvantages \u2013 let\u2019s break them down below.\n\nMobile wallet\n\nA mobile crypto wallet is perfect for face-to-face trades and shopping at brick-and-mortar establishments. Most mobile wallets use near-field communication (NFC), allowing users to tap their phone on a terminal to start a transaction.\n\nPros\n\nHighly portable and convenient\n\nVery easy to set up\n\nAdded security with two-factor authentication\n\nCons\n\nLeast secure digital wallet as it is prone to hacking\n\nNo control over nodes and transactions\n\nEU-licensed CryptoWallet is one example of mobile wallet with an exchange service incorporated. Within the app, you can create multiple wallets for bitcoin, ether and other cryptocurrencies. Moreover, as many mobile wallets, it allows customers to pay online and spend cryptocurrencies like real money. In addition to that, CryptoWallet offers an affiliate program. When your associate registers in CryptoWallet using your rewards code, you\u2019ll get a percentage of any transaction fees charged.\n\nCryptoWallet interface | Source: CryptoWallet.com\n\nTrust Wallet is another popular mobile wallet integrated with major crypto exchange Coinbase. Same as CryptoWallet, it allows users to store multiple cryptocurrencies and even NFT collectibles in one place. The wallet is integrated with BinancePay that allows you to use cryptocurrencies in the real world, for instance, pay in shops.\n\nThe mobile wallets are trying to keep pace with security measures and regulations. For instance, CryptoWallet has recently renewed a trading license in Estonia amid tightening EU crypto legislation. However, it\u2019s worth remembering all the cons mentioned above and avoid storing big amounts of crypto in hot wallets.\n\nSoftware wallet\n\nSoftware wallets are mobile or desktop applications that connect to the internet to facilitate transactions. Most software wallets are fully self-custodial, meaning wallet providers cannot access your cryptocurrency \u2013 only you can.\n\nPros\n\nNo cost to download, no registration fee\n\nEasy to use\n\nSmaller risk of hacking compared to mobile wallets\n\nMetaMask is probably one of the most popular software wallets out there, with both browser extension and an app available to users. As a software wallet, it provides a convenient way for users to store, send, and receive ethereum and ethereum-based tokens like ERC-20 and ERC-721.\n\nIntegration with dapps is one of the MetaMask advantages. The wallet seamlessly integrates with a multitude of dapps, enabling users to access various decentralized services, like decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, and gaming applications.\n\nMoreover, users can easily add custom tokens to their wallets, enabling the management of a wide range of assets. However, MetaMask supports only ethereum-based tokens, making it unsuitable for users seeking a multi-chain wallet solution.\n\nIt is also important to keep in mind the cons of using software wallets. For instance, it\u2019s not decentralized enough for some crypto enthusiasts, as MetaMask transactions are publicly visible on the blockchain, which could reveal users\u2019 wallet addresses and associated transaction history. Moreover, although MetaMask offers reasonable security features, it does not provide the same level of protection as hardware wallets, which are considered the most secure way to store crypto assets.\n\nHardware wallet\n\nHardware wallets are cold wallets that you can use to perform offline transactions. There are several different types of hardware wallets available on the market. The most popular ones are the Ledger Nano S and Trezor Model T. These wallets support a wide range of cryptocurrencies and have built-in screens that make it easy to confirm transactions before signing them.\n\nPros\n\nKeys are more secure as they are never connected to the internet\n\nEasy to back up and restore\n\nCons\n\nNot ideal for frequent bitcoin transactions as they can be difficult to access\n\nSome hardware wallet sellers are unreliable/not secure\n\nCentralized exchange wallet\n\nCentralized exchanges (CEXs) are similar to trading accounts in that third parties manage accounts, exchanges, wallets, and transactions.\n\nPros\n\nEasy to set up and use\n\nCompatible with desktops or mobile devices\n\nCons\n\nNot secure unless trading bitcoin immediately\n\nRequires permission for withdrawal\n\nLonger withdrawal periods\n\nHigh transaction fees\n\nBinance\u2019s P2P service can serve as an example of a centralized exchange wallet, where traders\u2019 funds can be exchanged online within seconds. Crypto assets traded on Binance P2P are not stored on the platform itself. Once a trade is completed, the purchased cryptocurrency is transferred to the user\u2019s Binance wallet.\n\nPaper Wallet\n\nTo use paper wallets, you must download a software package to generate key pairs. Then, you\u2019ll print these key pairs on paper, enabling you to access and store bitcoin offline.\n\nPros\n\nLow-cost alternative to hardware wallets\n\nIdeal for face-to-face transactions\n\nCons\n\nEasy to lose paper keys\n\nRequires physical access to the printed keys\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile opening a bitcoin account is relatively straightforward, what type of wallet you choose will dictate how secure your coins are. Think about how you want to access your bitcoin, what you want to use it for, and what is most convenient for you. Here\u2019s the brief summary to guide you:\n\nHot wallet: can be used for trading, paying in crypto, exchanging on P2P, and other goals that require quick access to your coins via internet.\n\nCold wallet: can be used for long-term storage of crypto, savings, etc.\n\nWhen you do your homework, buying and selling crypto is a breeze. If you\u2019re new to bitcoin, consider what wallets are best for safely holding and storing crypto.\n\nFAQ: how to open a bitcoin account"

        "title": "Bitcoin Bros Can't Stop Gloating About the Bank Crisis - The Daily Beast",
        "content": "Three banks have crashed and another is on life support, the U.S. banking system is on rocky ground, and fears of a recession are skyrocketing. But one group is thrilled about the current situation: the Bitcoin bros.\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank this month, along with the smaller Signature and Silvergate banks, was followed by a rally in the price of Bitcoin after a painful year that wiped $2 trillion of value out of the crypto market. Largely silent since the fall of industry darling FTX, the crypto enthusiasts re-emerged on Twitter in recent weeks to boast about their investment\u2014even as others worried about their ability to pay the bills.\n\nThe chest-thumping started on March 10, when a massive run on the bank caused SVB to collapse. The bank was a lifeline for many in the tech industry, including small startup founders, who started to panic about not being able to pay their employees or put dinner on the table. Major national economists warned about a contagion that could level still more banks and drag down an already struggling economy.\n\nSome Bitcoin enthusiasts, however, chose that moment to take a victory lap.\n\n\u201cBanks failing. I wonder where I can put my money where I don\u2019t need to trust anyone? Like maybe Bitcoin?\u201d crypto entrepreneur and advocate Dan Held tweeted that day, adding a smirking emoji.\n\n\u201cRT if you trust #Bitcoin more than banks,\u201d Bitcoin Magazine, the host of the annual Bitcoin Conference, tweeted that weekend.\n\nA few days later, the federal government announced it would ensure deposits in the bank, making all SVB customers whole. The move saved thousands from financial ruin but sparked debate over whether yet another bank bailout\u2014even one not funded by U.S. taxpayers\u2014was the right call.\n\nThe Bitcoin bros just saw it as an opportunity to post.\n\n\u201c#Bitcoin will never need a #Bailout,\u201d tweeted Michael Saylor. He later retweeted a video clip of crypto podcaster Natalie Brunell\u2019s Fox News appearance, where she declared that \u201cBitcoin worked this weekend when banks didn't,\u201d and that the U.S. dollar is \u201cdying by a thousand cuts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is our time!! Let\u2019s go team $BTC!! Let\u2019s go $ETH!!\u201d tweeted Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz. \u201cThe decentralized revolution is happening.\u201d (Novogratz famously got a tattoo of a different cryptocurrency, Luna, weeks before its value crashed to zero.)\n\nThe cheering only grew louder as the price of Bitcoin continued to rise last week. Tyler Winklevoss, the tech entrepreneur whose crypto company, Gemini, is facing charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission, predicted Friday that the price of Bitcoin could reach $30,000 by the end of the weekend.\n\nFormer Coinbase chief technology officer Balaji Srinivasan took it even farther, betting a follower on Saturday that Bitcoin would reach $1 million within 90 days. \u201cYou buy 1 BTC. I will send $1M USD,\u201d he tweeted. The pseudonymous follower took the bet; he told The Daily Beast via Twitter DM the two sides were just \u201cironing out the details with a lawyer.\u201d\n\nJoshua White, a finance professor at Vanderbilt University, called these bold predictions nothing more than \u201chype\u201d meant to drive up the value of Bitcoin. He noted that buying Bitcoin from a crypto exchange like Coinbase or Binance was not inherently safer than investing with banks, because those exchanges could also go bankrupt and lose customers\u2019 money. Users could store their tokens in their own crypto wallets, he added, but that requires a fair amount of technical savvy.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine the mom and pop running a wine store in Nashville that says, \u2018I don't trust this bank, let me go put this money in Bitcoin,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nOf the crypto fans predicting a Bitcoin boom, he added: \u201cThey also argued that Bitcoin was an inflation hedge, and we did not see that.\u201d\n\nBitcoin did not cross $30,000 by the end of last weekend, nor did it come anywhere near its historic high of more than $65,000 in 2021. According to crypto investment group CoinShares, people took more money out of digital currencies last week than they put in\u2014for the sixth week in a row. Net outflows were more than $95 million last week alone, with Bitcoin seeing the most sell-offs.\n\nPlus, some industry experts believe the bank failures could actually wind up hurting crypto: Silvergate and Signature were two of the only banks in the U.S. willing to work with crypto companies.\n\n\u201cThe impacts would be really big if there is no U.S. bank that will take on deposits from a crypto client,\u201d Taylor Johnson, a co-founder of crypto product company PsyFi, told Time. \u201cIt would be very painful, and reduce crypto activity a ton for any U.S. person or business.\u201d\n\nWhether Srinivasan gets his $1 million back remains to be seen."

        "title": "Bitcoin buoyed as bank busts spook investors - Forkast News",
        "content": "In this issue\n\nBitcoin: What crisis? Arbitrum: Network effects Guo Wengui: Hammer time\n\nFrom the Editor\u2019s Desk Dear Reader, It\u2019s not without a quiet sense of irony that we have been watching recent events unfold in the traditional banking sector. After a year in which the cryptocurrency industry has suffered unprecedented pain, it now seems to be TradFi\u2019s turn, with the collapses of U.S. lenders Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank to be followed by that of Credit Suisse, once a bastion of Big Finance and one of only 30 systemically important global lenders. The Swiss heavyweight\u2019s problems triggered a worldwide banking market rout that has wiped around US$1 trillion off the value of finance sector shares in recent days. Nobody is suggesting for a moment that this makes the US$60 billion implosion of Terra or the US$8 billion hole that FTX\u2019s crash left behind look small \u2014 and keep in mind that these sums were proportionally a much larger chunk of the crypto market than the latest share rout represents for TradFi. But it does put the 48% rise in crypto market cap over the past 14 days \u2014 particularly, perhaps, Bitcoin\u2019s 71% gain since the beginning of the year \u2014 into perspective. So once again it has come to pass that a number of investors seem to be feeling at least as safe putting money into crypto as they do putting it into traditional banks. The crowing and \u201ctold you so\u201d sneering by some in the TradFi space during crypto\u2019s annus horribilis, in light of this, has the feel of rather ill-advised schadenfreude. We should emphasize that any such gloating among the crypto community would be equally ill-advised \u2014 not only given the industry\u2019s woes of the past year but also the fact that turmoil in any part of the financial system, from Main Street banks to memecoins, heaps misery on investors large and (especially) small. Yet the irony remains. And with it persists one of the driving forces of the crypto phenomenon and the financial revolution that it has given the world. Crypto may have been down lately, but it\u2019s far from out. Until the next time, Angie Lau,\n\nFounder and Editor-in-Chief\n\nForkast\n\n1. Boosted\n\nBitcoin has surged amid the collapses of several banks in the U.S. and Europe as investors question the fragility of the mainstream finance system. Image: Canva\n\nBy the numbers: Bitcoin \u2014 over 5,000% increase in Google search volume.\n\nThe banking crisis in the U.S. and Europe that has roiled markets recently may be adding to investors\u2019 appetite for crypto assets as Bitcoin powers a rally in cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin has gained over 14% in the past seven days, and briefly breached the US$28,000 mark on Monday for the first time since June 2022, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency has soared more than 70% since the start of the year. Alongside Bitcoin, the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies rebounded from around US$914 billion on March 10 to top US$1.18 trillion at press time, a jump of more than 29%.\n\nAt the same time, worries about systematic risks in the banking system are putting pressure on equity markets and prompting authorities to take action. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which has taken over failed lenders Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, has announced that most Signature Bank deposits would be handed over to a unit of Hicksville, NY-headquartered New York Community Bancorp.\n\nIn Europe, Swiss authorities have initiated an emergency takeover of global investment bank Credit Suisse by UBS after the former\u2019s imperiled financial status sent its share price to record lows last week.\n\nConcerns are increasing that the list of failed banks will grow longer. Last Friday, Moody\u2019s Investor Service downgraded embattled U.S. lender First Republic Bank, whose stock closed 32.8% lower on the day, despite a US$30 billion rescue plan to backstop it. Last Sunday, S&P Global downgraded First Republic for a second time in five days, according to a Reuters report.\n\nHowever, fears over fragility of the banking system are also driving the prices of cryptocurrencies higher, Kadan Stadelmann, chief technical officer of blockchain infrastructure development firm Komodo, told Forkast.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Reserve embarked upon a many-trillion dollar quantitative easing program, cut the minimum bank reserves from 10% to 0% on March 26, 2020, and led us into the current bout with inflation, which has led people to seek alternative ways to preserve wealth. Bitcoin has become a prominent option,\u201c Stadelmann wrote.\n\nThe troubles in the banking industry may even prompt a monetary policy shift by the Federal Reserve, which last weekend announced a coordinated move with other central banks to make more U.S. dollars available to improve market liquidity. Analysts at CME Group are now divided on whether the Fed will further raise interest rates at its meeting on March 22 as policymakers weigh financial and price stability.\n\nThe U.S. consumer price index rose 6% year on year last month, a level still well above the Fed\u2019s goal of keeping annual inflation below 2%. Stubborn inflation, accompanied by the Fed\u2019s dovish monetary policy tendencies, is contributing to Bitcoin\u2019s price gains, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nForkast.Insights | What does it mean? Bitcoin\u2019s surge has been explained in two ways. The first, and arguably the most popular, is that the banking system has lied to investors, and that the breakdown in trust has sent investors looking for something with better credentials. The second has more to do with U.S. regulators\u2019 desire to backstop the banking industry, as they did early on in the Covid-19 pandemic. When lockdowns and other pandemic controls were announced in 2020, stock and crypto prices nosedived. What helped them bounce back were the extraordinary measures taken by central banks and other regulators around the world to economies running. The reassurance their actions provided led to surges in the values of stocks and digital assets alike. In recent days, crypto prices have sunk on news that crypto-friendly banks were failing, but they have recovered since U.S. regulators stepped in. The first week of March, which saw the highest level of capital flight from crypto since the collapse of FTX last September, provided the backdrop and was the fifth consecutive week of money leaving the industry. While some Bitcoin boosters may be gleeful amid TradFi\u2019s troubles, crypto is just as reliant on the rest of the finance sector and the world\u2019s central banks as any other industry.\n\n2. Ready to drop\n\nThe launch of Arbitrum\u2019s governance token due to take place this week has stirred much excitement among investors as well as the popping up of similar-sounding projects that are likely scams. Image: Arbitrum/Canva\n\nBy the numbers: Arbitrum \u2014 over 5,000% increase in Google search volume.\n\nArbitrum, an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, is set to launch its new native governance token, ARB, and a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance model for the Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova networks on Thursday, March 23.\n\nAround 56% of Arbitrum tokens will be community-owned and 12.75% of the community allocation will be distributed in Thursday\u2019s airdrop. The remainder of the supply will be distributed by the DAO over time.\n\nThe ARB token will have an initial supply of 10 billion and will allow holders to vote on community proposals through the DAO.\n\nAirdropped tokens will be tradable within a week, while tokens held by early investors and team members will be subject to a four-year lock-up. The first unlock will take place a year from the date of issuance, followed by subsequent yearly unlocks.\n\nMore than 625,000 wallets are eligible for the airdrop, according to blockchain analytics firm Nansen, which provided on-chain data to help develop the token\u2019s distribution.\n\nSeveral large exchanges, including Binance and Bybit, said they would list the new token from its launch date.\n\nFutures markets for the Arbitrum token have already opened. The Arbitrum IOU token is down 27% since Friday, trading at US$7.32 at 04:25 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nForkast.Insights | What does it mean? Arbitrum\u2019s token launch is this month\u2019s answer to the Blur token\u2019s airdrop in February. The excitement around a governance token is less about holders being able to vote on community proposals and DAO participation than it is about capitalizing on a surge in popularity. The Arbitrum IOU placeholder token has racked up a trading volume of US$4 million over the past day on Hotbit, and a token for Solana\u2019s ARB Protocol is up 890% in the past week, perhaps because they bear names similar to that of the forthcoming Ethereum layer-2 token. There are also copycats looking to capitalize on the launch frenzy and investor gullibility. CoinGecko has accused ArbiSwap of \u201cminting 1 billion fake tokens\u201d and committing a rug-pull. In a Twitter post last Sunday, Arbitrum News DAO said it had identified more than 273 phishing sites related to Arbitrum since the protocol announced the airdrop. Meanwhile, crypto security startup Redefine drew attention to a website that it said was impersonating Arbitrum\u2019s airdrop site. Where there\u2019s excitement and hype in crypto, keep a cool head and be on the lookout for scams.\n\n3. Guoing to jail?\n\nThe massive crypto fraud of which Guo Wengui stands accused may eclipse the other controversies for which he is known. Image: Emmert/Getty Images\n\nExiled Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui was arrested in New York last week for allegedly orchestrating a fraud worth more than US$1 billion that included cryptocurrency, according to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nGuo \u2014 known variously as Miles Guo, Ho Wan Kwok and \u201cBrother Seven\u201d \u2014 has been charged by the DOJ with multiple counts of wire fraud, securities fraud, bank fraud and money laundering on suspicion he solicited investments in various entities through false statements and representations to \u201chundreds of thousands of [his] online followers,\u201d the DOJ said in a statement.\n\nGuo and other defendants stand accused of obtaining more than US$262 million in victims\u2019 funds through the Himalaya Exchange, a purported cryptocurrency ecosystem, the DOJ said, adding that it had seized approximately US$634 million from 21 bank accounts linked to the alleged fraud.\n\nThe DOJ alleges that Guo lied, promising his victims outsized returns if they backed a number of his ventures, including GTV Media Group Inc., a media company he formed in 2020 with Steve Bannon, an ex-adviser to former U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nGuo was also charged by the SEC for his alleged involvement in unregistered and fraudulent offerings that raised more than US$850 million.\n\nThe SEC said one of the offerings raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors through a crypto asset security referred to as \u201cH-Coin,\u201d or \u201cHimalaya Coin,\u201d by falsely stating that 20% of its value was backed by gold and that Guo \u201cwould personally compensate investors for any potential losses.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn reality, Guo took advantage of the hype and allure surrounding crypto and other investments to victimize thousands and fund his and his family\u2019s lavish lifestyle,\u201d Gurbir S. Grewal, director of the SEC\u2019s enforcement division, said in a statement. CNN reported that Guo had been denied bail in a hearing the same day.\n\n\u201cKwok is charged with lining his pockets with the money he stole, including buying himself, and his close relatives, a 50,000 square foot mansion in New Jersey, a US$3.5 million Ferrari, and even two US$36,000 mattresses, and financing a US$37 million luxury yacht,\u201d U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in the DOJ statement.\n\nThe International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) issued a \u201cred notice\u201d in 2017 for Guo\u2019s arrest at the request of Chinese authorities over suspected bribery of Chinese officials and other crimes, according to a report by the South China Morning Post."

        "title": "Unregulated crypto ATMs give criminals a loophole to prey on unsuspecting victims - CBS News",
        "content": "Police say scammers are using cryptocurrency ATMs to steal from victims\n\nCrypto ATMs, or kiosks, are increasingly being used as a tool for scams across the country. The machines are often unregulated and unregistered, providing a loophole for criminals to take advantage of unsuspecting victims.\n\nIn Oct. 2021, artist Joe Samuels thought he was contacting his computer company's IT department. During the call, he granted someone access to remotely fix his computer, which appeared to work.\n\nHowever, a few months later, he received another call from someone claiming to be from the same IT department. They told him that they had mistakenly deposited $20,000 into his checking account and demanded he send it back through a Bitcoin ATM.\n\n\"And they're telling me, calling me. 'You got to pay us back. Otherwise we're going to get the FBI,'\" said Samuels, who is 84.\n\nFearing for his safety, Samuels complied and deposited $20,000 in cash into a Bitcoin of America kiosk located near his apartment in Hartford, Connecticut. Five days later, he discovered that the scammers had actually moved his own money from his savings account into his checking account.\n\nThe crypto kiosk that Samuels used was seized but Samuels paid the price: he spent a week in the hospital and two years later, he has not been able to recuperate the money. He is now living with his son since he can not afford to live on his own.\n\n\"That's what I gotta deal with. But then again, you know, I feel very fortunate. I take the opportunity to just paint. And put the work away,\" Samuels said.\n\nRight now, there are about 32,000 crypto ATMs and kiosks across the country \u2013 up from 1,200 in 2018. Although they resemble regular ATMs, they convert cash into digital cryptocurrency that goes to a digital wallet instead of a traditional bank account.\n\nBitcoin of America, accused of aiding scammers who stole millions from victims using its kiosks, faces charges of conspiracy and money laundering along with its CEO and two others. The kiosks were allegedly unlicensed and profitable in Ohio.\n\nBitcoin of America CEO Sonny Meraban was arrested in Miami earlier this month and charged with crimes including money laundering and conspiracy.\n\nAccording to Connecticut State Police Detective Matthew Hogan, who specializes in financial crimes and cryptocurrency, some of these machines are safe for consumers. But he warns that due to the lack of regulation around them, many are used for scams or crimes like money laundering. Hogan also believes that they are deliberately placed in high-crime areas.\n\n\"I think they're strategically placed on purpose because they're getting a higher percentage of use in those locations of high crime,\" Hogan said.\n\nCybersecurity expert Bree Fowler from CNET warns that crypto ATMs pose a unique risk because many are unregulated and unlicensed.\n\n\"They're, you know, on some levels not any different than a soda or a candy machine. If you see one of these things, just don't use them right now,\" Fowler said.\n\nCBS News reached out to Bitcoin of America for comment on the indictment. The company did not respond, and the CEO has also not responded to requests for comment. Bitcoin of America's website has also been shut down.\n\nBefore the indictment of Meraban, the company claimed in court that they had given Samuels' money to a third party whose identity remains unknown. A judge ordered that Samuels' money be handed over to Bitcoin of America. However, now that the company is facing legal issues, Samuels' family is considering suing Bitcoin of America to recover their lost funds."

        "content": "The Texas legislature introduced a bill on Tuesday to attract more Bitcoin-related businesses to the state and protect the rights of Bitcoin holders, miners, and developers, according to the text of the proposed legislation.\n\nSee related story: Bitcoin hashrate slumps to lowest in over five months amid 100-degree-plus weather in Texas\n\nFast facts\n\nThe bill will provide legal protection for those owning and engaging in Bitcoin-related activities, including the immunity afforded by censorship-resistant Bitcoin spending and the ability to store Bitcoin in an unhosted wallet without state interference.\n\nBitcoin miners will be free to engage in mining without restrictions from any law or resolution and to seek out any form of energy for securing the Bitcoin network, according to the bill.\n\nTexas will support individuals who code or develop on the Bitcoin network under Section 8, Article I of the Texas Constitution, which protects freedom of speech and the press.\n\nThe bill cited the Chinese government\u2019s banning of bitcoin mining and trading in 2021 has led to the quick migration of miners from China to the United States, particularly to Texas, due to the state\u2019s crypto-friendly regulations and relatively low-cost electricity.\n\nTexas has the fourth-highest Bitcoin hash rate, accounting for 14% of the total hash rate in the United States, according to Foundry USA, the biggest mining pool in North America and the fifth-largest globally.\n\nIn a related development, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on March 20 proposed a bill to the local legislature to ban central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), both foreign and domestic, from being used in Florida, saying they can be used as a means of surveillance on citizens. CBDCs are issued and controlled by central banks, unlike stablecoins and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\nAmid criticism of excessive energy use by Bitcoin miners, U.S. President Joe Biden on March 9 proposed a 30% tax on electricity used in cryptocurrency mining in his budget blueprint for Fiscal Year 2024.\n\nSee related story: China\u2019s mining exodus flows to U.S. Is Texas the new promised land?"

        "content": "As Bitcoin goes, so goes the rest of crypto, and that includes Coinbase.\n\nIn less than two weeks, the exchange\u2019s stock has soared approximately 56%, exceeding more than $83 per share, the highest in six months.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s recent resurgence reflects a broader rally in the crypto market. On Sunday, Bitcoin broke $28,000 for the first time since June 2022, as investors rushed to the digital asset amid fears of a banking crisis. Other cryptocurrencies are also up, including Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and the native token for the Ethereum blockchain, which has gained 20% in less than two weeks.\n\nThe rising share price is welcome news after a tough year for Coinbase, which reported fourth-quarter earnings that included a $2.6 billion net loss for 2022. Amid a prolonged Crypto Winter, the cryptocurrency exchange reported a 50% decline in total trading volume compared with 2021.\n\n\u201cTo state the obvious, 2022 was a challenging year for the crypto markets and our transaction revenues,\u201d Coinbase wrote in its shareholder letter.\n\nA spokesperson for Coinbase declined to comment on the recent share gains when reached on Tuesday by Fortune.\n\nThe company, headed by founder and CEO Brian Armstrong, also has been battling an increasingly hostile regulatory landscape as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the federal government have pursued a widespread crypto crackdown after the sudden fall of FTX.\n\nIn January, the SEC charged crypto firms Genesis and Gemini with selling unregistered securities through the companies\u2019 yield-bearing product, Gemini Earn. In February, the competing cryptocurrency exchange Kraken then agreed to pay a $30 million fine and shut down its staking service, which the SEC alleged was tantamount to selling unregistered securities.\n\nAnd Coinbase, along with the broader crypto landscape, has also reckoned with the sudden disappearance of Silvergate and Signature, which once were the banks of choice for the industry.\n\nBut the recent resurgence in crypto prices\u2014and Coinbase\u2019s stock\u2014has enthusiasts hopeful that the enduring chill of Crypto Winter may soon subside."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price broke above the February 2023 highs of $25,200 after U.S. inflation data was in consensus with the market expectation. The potential fallout of the global banking system further promoted Bitcoin investment as a non-correlated global hedging instrument similar to gold in March. The correlation between gold and Bitcoin (BTC) has been rising since the start of the month.\n\nCorrelation coefficient between BTC and gold. Source: TradingView\n\nHowever, institutions have become net sellers of Bitcoin in 2023, which raises some red flags. Bitcoin whales \u2014 wallets holding between 10 BTC and 10,000 BTC \u2014 have not participated in the current rally. It appears that retail investors are mainly driving the uptrend. The divergence between whale and retail investment could cause a short-term pullback in Bitcoin prices.\n\nInstitutions are forced BTC sellers, says analyst\n\nInstitutional crypto asset flows data from CoinShares reveals the largest two-week sell-off from investment funds since March 6. The outflows have erased the positive inflows for this year, with the net year-to-date flow equalling negative $177 million.\n\nCoinShares\u2019 data tracks the portfolio of global institutional funds with digital asset exposure, including Grayscale, CoinShares XBT, 21Shares, Purpose and 3iQ.\n\nJames Butterfill, CoinShares\u2019 head of research, notes in the report that the flows \u201cmay be driven, in part, by the need for liquidity during this banking crisis, a similar situation was seen when the COVID panic first hit the market in March 2020.\u201d\n\nInstitutional flow of crypto assets. Source: CoinShares\n\nButterfill\u2019s theory about forced sell-offs by institutions may have some credibility, as on-chain analytics firm Santiment informed Cointelegraph that it \u201cdo[es] not currently see major whale sell-offs at this time. Bitcoin addresses holding 10-10,000 BTC have remained essentially flat.\u201d\n\nIt is encouraging that whales are not looking to sell the current rally. However, as the prices continue to rise, the asset will require whale buyers to join the bandwagon \u2014 otherwise, the rally could fade soon.\n\nAdditionally, the recent depegging of USD Coin (USDC) and the regulatory crackdown on Binance USD (BUSD) have likely caused a minor whale exodus from stablecoins. Santiment reported that \u201caddresses holding between $100,000 to $10 million in stablecoins have been dropping slightly, but not to a notably high degree.\u201d\n\nA flow of stablecoins to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is positive for prices. However, large-scale conversions from stablecoins to dollars weaken the market\u2019s buying power. The lack of growth in whale BTC holdings suggests that the flows represent more of the latter situation.\n\nWhale holdings of BTC and stablecoins. Source: Santiment\n\nAnother crucial stakeholder in the Bitcoin economy is BTC miners. The BTC holdings in one-hop miner addresses \u2014 BTC accounts that receive coins from mining pools \u2014 have increased steadily since the start of 2023.\n\nSome miners booked some profit on March 14 when Bitcoin\u2019s price broke above $25,000 for the first time and again a week later when it touched $28,000. However, the total holdings are still in an uptrend since the start of 2023.\n\nHoldings on one-hop miner addresses. Source: Coin Metrics\n\nRetail investors on spot exchanges are driving prices\n\nSo far, spot purchases by retail investors are likely driving the rally. Will Clemente, an independent on-chain analyst and the co-founder of Reflexivity Research, tweeted that the uptrend \u201cappears to be mostly spot driven\u201d with muted open interest volumes for BTC futures contracts and funding rates on perpetual contracts.\n\nThe holdings of Bitcoin addresses with less than 10 BTC continue to surge to new all-time highs. The distribution among small hands adds credibility to the \u201carguments against Bitcoin regarding supply concentration\u201d among a few large holders.\n\nRelated: Holding Bitcoin: A profitable affair 88.5% of days\n\nHowever, retail investors have a poor track record in timing market entries and exits. Thus, the participation of whale investors is crucial for confidence in the present rally.\n\nTechnically, the BTC/USD pair appears strong on a daily time frame, with a positive breakout and consolidation above its broadening wedge pattern. Currently, buyers are facing resistance from the June 2022 breakdown levels between $28,000 and $30,000.\n\nBTC/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nOn the other hand, the CME futures data raises the chance of a pullback with two unfilled gaps toward $26,500 and $19,500. A price gap on CME futures charts is formed during U.S. holidays and weekends when the spot trading of Bitcoin on exchanges creates a difference between the closing and opening price on CME.\n\nUsually, CME gaps are filled by a price action toward the closing price on CME to retrace the pump on the futures market. Veteran trader Peter Brandt advised opening a short BTC position based on the gap.\n\nThere\u2019s a chance that more sophisticated investors are waiting for the U.S. Federal Reserve policy rate meeting on March 22 before opening their swing positions. The Fed\u2019s policy rate announcement will likely act as a strong market mover, inducing significant volatility in the market.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Just How Realistic Is a Bitcoin Price Target of $100,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "There has been a lot of Bitcoin (BTC 1.59%) exuberance lately, with Bitcoin up more than 15% over the past week, and almost 70% for the year. Bitcoin now trades at almost $28,000, and accounts for a staggering 46% of the total market capitalization of the $1.2 trillion crypto market. Everyone, it seems, wants a piece of Bitcoin these days.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, given all this bullishness, some tech insiders are now predicting that Bitcoin could hit $100,000 soon, perhaps within the next 12 months. That includes Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, who recently suggested a price of $100,000 was possible. But just how realistic is this price target? After all, Bitcoin's all-time-high is $68,789.63, and that was at the peak of the bull market in tech. Here's a closer look at several factors to keep in mind if you're expecting Bitcoin to soar by the end of the year.\n\nInterest rates\n\nUntil recently, the primary factor influencing the future price of Bitcoin was the Federal Reserve and the path of U.S. interest rates. Thus, for Bitcoin to continue its extraordinary ascent, it seems that it's going to need some help from the Fed. If the Fed pauses its interest rate hikes, or even decides to lower interest rates, that would be very bullish for Bitcoin.\n\nGiven the current state of the banking sector, which has been pummeled by rising rates, this might actually happen. That's probably why forecasts of Bitcoin at $100,000 are starting to pop up. Lower interest rates are typically favorable for risk assets such as crypto. But lower interest rates aren't a guarantee.\n\nBitcoin as digital gold (the sequel)\n\nRemember when everyone thought Bitcoin was \"digital gold\" and a safe haven against inflation? That was the general thinking among crypto investors until the 2022 market meltdown. Well, it looks like that argument is coming back, in a slightly different form. It's hard to ignore the growing number of analysts who are calling Bitcoin a potential safe haven in the face of a gathering financial storm. Some people are actually saying they'd rather hold Bitcoin than put their money into risky banks.\n\nSo if Bitcoin does replace gold as the safe haven asset of choice, then that would be bullish for Bitcoin. Keep your eye, too, on what the big institutional investors are doing with their portfolio allocations. If more and more of them increase their exposure to Bitcoin, then that would also be a huge plus. Some are even suggesting that corporations might start to hold Bitcoin directly on their balance sheets.\n\nTech stocks\n\nUntil the recent banking turmoil, the crypto asset class was highly correlated with the performance of tech stocks. In other words, if big Silicon Valley stocks went up, then crypto went up. If big Silicon Valley stocks went down, then crypto went down.\n\nSo I think this is where the $100,000 target idea starts to break down. Have you checked the news recently from the likes of Meta Platforms, which just laid off another 10,000 employees? Or Amazon, which yesterday said it was cutting an additional 9,000 jobs. A number of big-name tech companies have also announced huge rounds of layoffs, so I don't see a rebound happening in tech stocks anytime soon. Add in the fact that Silicon Valley Bank was the go-to lender for small tech start-ups, and things don't get any more encouraging.\n\nBitcoin's long march to $100,000?\n\nI think Bitcoin will eventually break through the $100,000 mark. But it could take longer than many people now expect. I'm basing my analysis on long-term secular trends happening in financial markets, such as Bitcoin's growing adoption as a form of payment, and Bitcoin's growing allocation in the portfolios of institutional investors.\n\nInvestors should be deeply skeptical of any argument that basically boils down to, \"The fiat money system has failed, now it's all clear for crypto.\" This argument is not just naive, but it also puts crypto investors into a difficult position. Who wants to root for bank failures and bank runs?\n\nKeep in mind that predicting the future of the economy is difficult. As legendary economist John Kenneth Galbraith once remarked, \"The only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.\" Nobody really knows what's going to happen with Bitcoin this year because nobody really knows what's going to happen with the economy. I'm bullish on Bitcoin long-term, but I also recognize that the path to $100,000 might be more difficult and more challenging than many crypto bulls now are willing to acknowledge."

        "title": "Bitcoin tops $28,500 \u2013 experts predict where BTC is going next - CNBCTV18",
        "content": "Bitcoin has registered a strong rally over the last 10 days or so. The world\u2019s oldest and largest cryptocurrency has gained nearly 30 percent in valuation over the last week, hitting a 9-month high of $28,527 yesterday, March 20. After this surprising price trend, most investors and traders are wondering where the king coin will go from here. Can a push higher be expected or will the bears take over once again? Here\u2019s what the experts are saying.\n\nEnd of the bear market? Next stop $30,000?\n\nAfter Bitcoin\u2019s recent price spurt, several analysts believe the bear market has finally come to an end. Popular trader and podcast host, Scott Melker, sees BTC\u2019s recent price movement as a sign that good things are just around the corner. \u201cBTC made its first higher high ($25,212) since the all-time high . That confirms a new bullish trend. Price can still go down, but that would be a new trend, not a continuation of the previous bear market. Congrats everyone.\u201d\n\nAnother prominent analyst, Rekt Capital, supported this notion. Based on historic chart patterns, he believes that Bitcoin will confirm a new bull market in the coming weeks. \u201cJust under two weeks left until #BTC monthly closes above the Macro Downtrend to confirm a new Bull Market,\u201d he said in a tweet today.\n\nAs such, several crypto traders believe BTC will continue on its upward journey in the coming days. One such analyst, Crypto Tony, took to Twitter to shed light on the king token\u2019s future valuation. \u201c$27,700 ensured we are now in the next range between $27,700 - $31,000. Using $27,700 as a level that bulls need to hold to sustain a move up to the $30,000 level,\u201d he said in March 20 tweet. Another prominent trader, Crypto Chase, agrees with this bullish outlook, stating that BTC could land in the $33,000 to $35,000 range in the coming weeks.\n\nAll eyes are on the upcoming FOMC meeting\n\nA pivotal event that could influence the price of Bitcoin is the upcoming FOMC meeting. Scheduled for March 21-22, the meeting will see members of the Fed decide and announce U.S. interest rates for the coming month.\n\nIn 2022, the Federal Reserve raised rates by 75 basis points four consecutive times in a bid to curb record-high inflation. These rate hikes seemed to have borne fruit as inflation numbers declined for the first time in months in Dec 2022. This prompted the Fed to pivot from its aggressive rate hikes, opting for a hike of 0.50 percentage points in Dec, followed by a 0.25 increase in early February.\n\nHowever, on March 7, Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome H. Powell, said that the U.S. central bank was likely to raise rates higher than expected. \u201cThe latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,\u201d said Powell in an appearance at Capitol Hill. Just this statement caused crypto prices to drop, with BTC slipping below $22,000 following Powell\u2019s announcement.\n\nHowever, the banking crisis that unravelled over the next few days could change this outlook. Several of the biggest financial institutes believe that the Fed could go back on its interest rate hike to ease the pressure on the banking sector. For instance, the popular investment bank, Goldman Sachs believes that, instead of an aggressive rate hike, interest rates will plateau.\n\nThe global investment bank, Nomura, takes things one step further, stating that the Fed could opt to cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage points owing to \"looming financial stability risks.\u201d Historically, every time interest rates are lowered, BTC tends to rally. Therefore a rate cut could send BTC spiking.\n\nFear and greed index backs narrative of further gains\n\nThe fear and greed index is a numeric representation of market sentiment toward Bitcoin and the broader crypto industry. It is measured on a scale of 1 to 100, where 1 indicates an extremely fearful market whereas 100 points toward high investor confidence. Recent reports indicate that Bitcoin has recorded its highest fear and greed score this year, touching 68 on March 20. The last time it reached this level was in Nov 21, around the same time BTC touched its all-time high.\n\nThis investor confidence is evident from a recent poll conducted by Santiment. The analytics platform took to Twitter asking users where BTC was headed next. Unsurprisingly, more than half of the 1,000 voters believed the king coin would go above $30,000 in the coming days.\n\nAnticipation around Bitcoin\u2019s halving\n\nBitcoin is scheduled for its halving event in March 2024. This will reduce the block reward to 3.125 BTC. Lowering the amount of Bitcoin entering circulation could cause prices to spike. Keeping this in mind, a leading crypto financial services platform, Matrixport, believes that BTC could surge toward the end of the year. In a recently published report, the platform predicted that BTC could touch $45,000 by the end of the year.\n\nThe wildest prediction\n\nThe wildest Bitcoin prediction comes from ex-Coinbase CTO, Balaji Srinivasan, who believes that BTC would touch $1 million within 90 days. This was after a JP Morgan report indicated that the U.S. Fed would inject $2 trillion as part of its new bank backstop program. \"The Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) was created to support American businesses and households by making additional funding available to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks can meet the needs of all their depositors,\" the Fed said in a press release.\n\nSrinivasan believes that the Fed\u2019s move to \u201cprint $2 trillion\u201d will \u201chyperinflate the dollar.\u201d Therefore, as a protective measure, Srinivasan is encouraging users to \u201cbuy bitcoin now and get your coins off exchanges.\u201d He also made a $2 million bet with two Twitter users that BTC would touch $1 million in 90 days. That translates into a 3,600 percent increase in a matter of months.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin is marching strong in 2023. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was changing hands at $27,627 per unit. That works out to a 67 percent increase since the start of the year. However, where the coin is headed from here is anyone\u2019s guess. Crypto markets are highly volatile and can move against even the strongest indicators. Therefore, it is important to do your own research and invest only as much as you can afford to lose completely."

        "content": "Is it Bitcoin\u2019s time to Shine, as the Banking System Falters?\n\nBitcoin's price action this week provides a clear market signal that Bitcoin is decoupling from other assets. Is Bitcoin, for the first time, acting as a safe haven asset in response to the traditional banking system and in response to a globally fraught central bank monetary policy?\n\nThe 30-day Pearson Correlation Coefficient between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 currently sits at -0.2. With the Nasdaq Composite, this correlation sits at 0.8. The correlation between Bitcoin and equity markets has broken. The S&P 500 is up just 0.3% in the last month, the Nasdaq Composite is up by ~3,1%. Conversely, the price of Bitcoin is up ~15.7% and has been enjoying strong gains.\n\nBitcoin has been touted as having the attributes of an uncorrelated asset. These are assets that move independently from the stock market and give investors a chance to beat the market.\n\nBitcoin has for a period of time, moved in lockstep with the equity market, both asset classes sold off and then soared together during extended periods in the last two years. There has been a prevalent view that Bitcoin\u2019s price has been driven by the Federal Reserve and macro-events.\n\nIn the last year, for example, the correlation between BTC and the S&P 500 had moved closer together with both asset classes reacting similarly to events like CPI prints. When the correlation did break it was because of disastrous black swan events like the LUNA/Terra/USDT collapse and the FTX implosion.\n\nThe prices of BTC, and the S&P 500. Source: Brave New Coin, FRED\n\nWhat is happening in the last month is very different, however.\n\nBitcoin was built to be a decentralized payment network that removed intermediaries and counterparties from transactions. It has a purposefully built hard-coded, predictable monetary supply. It was created during the 2008 financial crisis and it has found renewed support during the current banking crisis in the United States and Europe. Another factor is the hidden chaos in the developing world in countries like Lebanon and Turkey.\n\nEach of the banking collapse incidents listed below has an element of political interference and special concessions, and law changes, made to direct markets in a particular direction. Importantly, such interference is not possible with Bitcoin.\n\nBackstops and shutdowns, the US banking system wobbles\n\nIn the last two weeks, under different circumstances, three major American banks have been shut down. Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Bank, and Signature Bank have all had a run on deposits and have become entangled with regulators. This entire episode has created serious question marks surrounding the relationship between the government and the banking sector.\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank is complicated and likely had a number of contributing factors. Extraordinarily, the bank did not have a Chief Risk Officer (CRO) between April 2022-December 2022. Danny Moses, an investor who predicted the 2008 financial crisis and was featured in the \u2018Big Short\u2019, said of SVB. \u201cThis isn\u2019t greed, necessarily, at the bank level,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s just \u2026 complete and utter bad risk management on the part of SVB.\u201d\n\nSVB has also been accused of being a \u2018woke bank\u2019, more interested in ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance \u2013 a way for investors to measure how socially concious a business is) initiatives than its core banking services.\n\nThe collapse is also notable because SVB had long lobbied for looser risk requirements \u2013 arguing that if it did fail, its collapse would not require government intervention. In 2015, SVB CEO Greg Becker argued in front of Congress that the US$50 billion balance sheet threshold outlined by the Dodd-Frank Legislation was unnecessary for his bank. He said SVB and other mid-sized banks, or regional banks, did not present systemic risks in case of collapse. In 2018, Dodd-Frank was rolled back by law makers from both the Republican and Democratic parties.\n\nFast-forward to March 2023 and US financial regulators were forced to step in to provide special accommodations to SVB depositors after the Treasury deemed the bank \u201cSystemically important\u201d.\n\nAnother key factor in the collapse of SVB and the other bank\u2019s struggles is a reversing global bond market and interest rate regime. Years of low-interest rates meant that SVB struggled to make returns. Seeking profits, SVB and other banks poured money into bonds, primarily long-term US treasuries.\n\nWhen interest rates started rising, SVB and other competitors had to sell the bonds they were exposed to because depositors needed to be paid more interest. The inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices meant that these bonds were sold at a loss. Concerns around the bank\u2019s ability to continue running this loss were a key factor in the run against SVB.\n\nThe Silvergate and Signature situations shared many characteristics of the SVB downfall \u2014 all three had overexposure to traditional banking risks like a lack of diversification and maturity mismatches. With these two banks, the added element of crypto gives their downfalls a unique angle.\n\nSilvergate was a bank noted for serving the cryptocurrency industry and had clients including Circle and FTX. The bank voluntarily ceased operations and liquidated assets after intense regulatory scrutiny from Financial Regulators and US lawmakers.\n\nUS Senators including Elizabeth Warren stated that because Silvergate was FTX\u2019s banking partner, and \u201creportedly facilitated transfer of FTX customer funds to Alameda Research,\u201d it played some part in the fraud committed by the exchange and its sister companies.\n\nNic Carter, a noted digital asset analyst and advocate said on Twitter \u201cThe government also hastened the collapse of Silvergate by launching investigations and legal attacks on them. They\u2019re the arsonist and the firefighter in one\u201d. The fall of Silvergate raised other questions about the interference of politics in financial markets.\n\nSignature Bank, like Silvergate, was a bank noted for its services to the cryptocurrency industry and ability to cater to clients with digital assets on their books. Signature Bank was shut down by the New York State Department of Financial Services and its assets was seized by the FDIC. What made Signature different from Silvergate is that it was solvent at the time it was taken over by the FDIC.\n\nBarney Frank, a former Democrat congressman who was on the Signature Board said it was \u201can unjustified total shutdown\u201d. The bank was experiencing a surge in withdrawals but Frank said the situation was stabilizing. \u201cThe bank failed to provide reliable and consistent data, creating a significant crisis of confidence in the bank\u2019s leadership,\u201d is the response offered by a NYDFS spokesperson when asked why the bank was seized.\n\nA Swiss giant goes under\n\nFollowing the chaos in the US banking sector, this week it was announced that UBS, the largest bank in Switzerland will buy out ailing rival Credit Suisse. The Swiss National Bank announced that the UBS rescue operation would \u201csecure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy.\u201d The deal was brokered by the Swiss government and special measures including government guaranteed liquidity were put in place to ensure it would happen. It occurred without the approval of shareholders because of changes in laws made to ensure that there was no uncertainty surrounding the deal.\n\nIn 2022, Credit Suisse recorded its worst financial year since the Global Financial Crisis and for some time has been dealing with a market concerned about its stability and performance.\n\nThe rot has been setting in for some time at Credit Suisse. Source: NYSE CS stock price\n\nLast week the bank acknowledged that it had \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d in its bookkeeping. Given the uncertainty that was created following the closure of three notable American banks, Credit Suisse experienced a surge in withdrawals.\n\nThe Swiss banking giant tried to stem the flow through strategies like offering higher deposit rates but it was not enough. UBS was able to acquire Credit Suisse at a significant discount. Shareholders were wiped out as UBS received the equivalent of 0.76 Swiss Francs per their shares, likely disappointing because shares were trading for 1.86 Swiss Francs on Friday.\n\nAnother collapse looms large\n\nThe shares of First Republic Bank sank by more than 45% in a single day on Monday, hitting record lows. The Californian lender appears to be on its last leg but said it is \"well positioned to manage short-term deposit activity.\" The bank received a lifeline last week after a group of 11 banks lent First Republic US$30 billion.\n\nThere are whispers that JP Morgan is positioning itself to acquire First Republic. There are, however, views that regulators may be reluctant to let a major bank like JP Morgan make a sizable acquisition. The stock price of First Republic has reversed in the last day following statements from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen who said the government may backstop more depositors at regional banks.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s time to finally Shine?\n\nWith a new round of quantitative easing needed to ensure there is liquidity to guarantee bank depositors, further currency debasement and inflation seem likely. With gold already hitting new all-time highs, Bitcoin may yet prove itself to be the ultimate hedge and eventually do the same.\n\nDuring the Covid-19-driven global GDP challenges, did Bitcoin perform? No, it crashed brutally, like everything else. During the Russia-Ukraine invasion, did Bitcoin have a moment? Not really, interest rates shot through the roof, and Bitcoin once again traded as a risk asset, dropping 66% over 12 months.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price action over recent weeks suggests, however, that a new narrative is building. The market signal is clear and undeniable, as Bitcoin seeks to decouple from other risk asset classes.\n\nIs Bitcoin, ready to assume a position as a safe haven asset in response to a globally fraught central bank monetary policy? We\u2019ll know soon."

        "title": "Taproot Wizards: A Guide to the Fastest-Growing Bitcoin Ordinals Project - nft now",
        "content": "At the start of 2023, with Ordinals Inscriptions growing in popularity daily, it seemed every collector worth their salt was out to cash in on the Bitcoin NFT craze. While most turned their attention to CryptoPunks, OnChainMonkey, and other Ethereum-native projects bridging over to the world\u2019s oldest blockchain, one Bitcoin-centric endeavor emerged to establish a new narrative around digital artifacts.\n\nHelmed by an independent developer and longtime Bitcoin advocate, Taproot Wizards (TW) entered not only as the new kid on the Ordinals block but with a mission to become much more than just another generative avatar project. Carrying the tagline \u201cMake Bitcoin Magical Again\u201d and featuring art that holds historical significance within the Bitcoin community, the wizard-themed project completely disrupted the still-developing Bitcoin NFT ecosystem in one fell swoop.\n\nWhat is Taproot Wizards?\n\nAt its core, Taproot Wizards seems akin to the many dozens of PFP (profile picture) projects that preceded it. Featuring 2,121 unique, wizard-themed Ordinals, the collection grew over time, teased bit by bit via the project\u2019s Discord before being fully revealed on February 18, 2023. Though the project has yet to mint at the time of writing, it continues to receive accolades for its avant-garde sensibilities that hedge on a critical piece of Bitcoin history: the Bitcoin Wizard.\n\nOn February 18, 2013, exactly ten years before the Taproot Wizards reveal, a user who goes by the moniker \u201cmavensbot\u201d uploaded a crude drawing of a Bitcoin-wielding wizard to the r/Bitcoin on Reddit. The image, which quickly became iconic within the crypto community as a sort of mascot for BTC, existed in numerous forms before finding new life in Web3 by way of Taproot Wizards.\n\nIt was initially assumed that those behind Taproot Wizards had only co-opted the original Bitcoin Wizard as inspiration for a PFP project. But on the 10th anniversary of the initial release, it was announced that mavensbot was, in fact, involved in the creation of the art for the TW collection.\n\nSubsequently, a secondary collection featuring the Bitcoin Wizard was launched, independent of the droves of Taproot Wizards already revealed. It served to both onboard users onto Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network and benefit mavensbot for his masterful creation and years of blockchain advocacy.\n\n\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0fA special thanks to all the wizards, especially @udiWertheimer and @TaprootWizards for making the #BitcoinWizard 10-year so special! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf82\u2764\ufe0f \ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n\n\nI'm looking forward to see more of the @TaprootWizards art as it drops soon! Looks like a great community of enthusiastic bitcoiners. pic.twitter.com/mKK9NfUNJb \u2014 Bitcoin Wizard \u2013 mavensbot \ud83e\uddd9\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f (@mavensbot) February 19, 2023 The original artist behind the iconic Magic Internet Money meme @mavensb0t just earned over 6.15 BTC this weekend.\n\n\n\nThe @TaprootWizards project integrated lightning network so all the NFT degens would have to figure out how to use LN to get one \ud83d\udc4d\n\n\n\nProps!https://t.co/QvVR4butDI \u2014 Brad Mills (\ud83d\udd11,\ud83e\uddc0) (@bradmillscan) February 21, 2023\n\nWho created Taproot Wizards, and why?\n\nTaproot Wizards would be nothing without mavensbot\u2019s original contribution to the Bitcoin Reddit. But the impact of the Wizard drawing goes beyond simply inspiring the art of TW. As Udi Wertheimer \u2014 a developer, crypto advocate, and member of r/Bitcoin when the original Bitcoin Wizard was posted \u2014 puts it, mavensbot\u2019s drawing was a major event that nearly doubled the size of the Bitcoin Reddit at the time. This event, and the cultural shift it marks, would ultimately inspire Wertheimer to leverage the wizard IP to create its modern, non-fungible counterparts.\n\n\u201cThe 2013 Bitcoin Wizard brought in a lot of new people [to r/Bitcoin]. The cool thing about it was that it was this very simple drawing. It looks like it was made in Microsoft Paint, and it just says \u2018magical internet money \u2013 join us,\u2019 that\u2019s all,\u201d Wertheimer said in an interview with nft now.\n\n\u201cPeople really liked that. So we made a twist of that. We said, \u2018Okay, we\u2019re gonna say its magical internet JPEGs and invite people to join us.\u2019 This wizard collection is supposed to be really for people who believe in Bitcoin and want it to succeed.\u201d\n\nThe evolution of the Bitcoin Wizard into the Taproot Wizards. Credit: Taproot Wizards\n\nWhen Ordinals first began to hit their stride, Wertheimer \u2014 a major proponent of Bitcoin over the years \u2014 was seemingly already lightyears ahead of most in Web3. Due to his nature as a Bitcoin native, he saw Ordinals as a chance to shake up the seemingly stagnant bitcoin community and took it upon himself to do so in a grandiose fashion.\n\nOn February 1, in an event to announce Taproot Wizards to the world, Wertheimer purposefully orchestrated the largest block and transaction in Bitcoin\u2019s history, achieving the absolute maximum BTC block size of 4MB \u2014 something that many, up until this point, thought was impossible.\n\nYet, perhaps as to be expected, not everyone was happy about the sizeable block, or Taproot Wizards, for that matter. Considering a large portion of Bitcoin maximalists were already opposed to Ordinals for various reasons \u2014 including their nature to cause congestion on the blockchain \u2014 Wertheimer\u2019s purposeful action of maxing out of a BTC block meant that network usage would come to a halt if only for a short while. Of course, while this was not well received by the keepers of tradition, it was but a single show of force in Wertheimer\u2019s battle plan to bring innovation back to Bitcoin.\n\nThe intention behind the project\n\nAt face value, Taproot Wizards is a PFP collection featuring thousands of crudely drawn wizard Ordinal NFTs. This much is true. But by leveraging the obvious hype factor and tradablility that comes with PFP projects, Wertheimer aims to create a sort of trojan horse of Bitcoin awareness. Although collectors may come for the art, through disruption, community building, and by re-establishing the longstanding BTC ethos of rebellion, Wertheimer hopes to inspire a new wave of interest in and innovation on Bitcoin.\n\nFueled by the belief that Bitcoin has essentially lost momentum in the wake of Ethereum\u2019s NFT successes, Wertheimer says he\u2019d love to see the unique, creative, and humorous culture once established by early crypto adopters return to the Bitcoin blockchain. But for this to happen, he feels that Bitcoin maximalists will need to come down from their high horses and accept that the blockchain can be used for more than simply transacting. This is why he opted to launch TW with a 4MB Bitcoin block.\n\n\u201cThe statement we were trying to make is: \u2018look, whatever the Bitcoin protocol allows us to do, we\u2019re going to do.\u2019 You might have some preconceptions about what is okay and what is not okay, but we\u2019re just going to do what the Bitcoin protocol allows us,\u201d said Wertheimer. \u201cI don\u2019t think that every single thing we do is going to be brilliant, but we\u2019re going to try. We\u2019re going to start trying things which is something that is missing in Bitcoin culture.\u201d\n\nOnly 12 @TaprootWizards found their way to the Chain of Time so far!\n\n\n\nWhich one is your favorite? pic.twitter.com/oletzsxT7x \u2014 Taproot Wizards (@TaprootWizards) February 13, 2023\n\nWertheimer noted that while he doesn\u2019t expect everyone to appreciate Ordinals, users don\u2019t have to think they\u2019re good to benefit from them. But in the spirit of innovation, he says that he disagrees with the current Bitcoin ethos of perfectionism and believes that failure must be achieved for progress to be made.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not possible to have software that is completely perfect. I think that a much better approach to life, and Bitcoin as well, is that failures and mistakes are going to happen, but they should be embraced because that\u2019s how you correct your path. That\u2019s how progress is made in all fields,\u201d said Wertheimer.\n\n\u201cIt seems like people on Bitcoin have been very focused on avoiding mistakes and failures when really they\u2019ve been avoiding his progress. The only way to not make mistakes is not to move at all. So I hope that [Taproot Wizards] can reignite this passion to experiment, to try things, and to learn from mistakes.\u201d\n\nThe future of Taproot Wizards\n\nWhether or not Taproot Wizards catches fire as the next big NFT project is anyone\u2019s guess. But while speculation can only take users so far, it seems that Wertheimer\u2019s efforts are meant to have a much greater effect on the Bitcoin blockchain than a simple PFP collection could. In the spirit of bringing renewed interest to BTC, Wertheimer says that he\u2019ll largely focus on education \u2014 prompting TW community members to act for themselves rather than offering periodical incentives to those that stick around.\n\nAs evidence of this, only a month after his brainchild was introduced to Web3 via the now infamous 4MB block, Wertheimer launched something called the Wizard School to effectively gamify the Taproot Wizards onboarding process. Accessible only to those who complete a social media and email verification process, the Wizard School offers potential Taproot Wizards collectors a way toward becoming a holder through a series of quests.\n\nFrom learning how to engage with Bitcoin\u2019s layer two Lightning Network to pledging allegiance to Taproot Wizards by way of Twitter or donning a wizard costume and going for a swim, users enrolled in Wizard School are given time-constricted tasks to advance through the ranks in order to obtain something called a \u201cmagic key.\u201d\n\nAlthough, with four tasks down, it\u2019s still unclear how long the Wizard School enrollment will be or exactly what might be attainable once a user completes a full course of quests, the gamified process is inexplicably unique even by Web3 standards.\n\nfeeling a bit emotional rn\n\n\n\nwhen we launched the @TaprootWizards shower video challenge, we didn\u2019t know how people would react\n\n\n\na week later, we have over a thousand submissions, and they\u2019re getting better each day\n\n\n\ni can\u2019t thank you crazy wizards enough. you are all magical \ud83e\udde1 pic.twitter.com/T1czEPqt5i \u2014 Udi Wertheimer \ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f (@udiWertheimer) March 20, 2023\n\nBeyond Wizard School, it seems likely that TW fans will surely be rewarded for their support and participation over time. Especially considering some within the more creative set of enthusiasts have even gone so far as to launch indie games inspired by Wertheimer\u2019s collection.\n\nAnd as we\u2019ve recently seen the NFT landscape (and collector rewards) shifting significantly in 2023, Wertheimer\u2019s methodology could inspire new forms of Ordinals project management. But as Web3 matures, Taproot Wizards may have served the blockchain best by highlighting one salient truth: stagnancy and complacency will surely not help NFTs go from niche to mainstream."

        "title": "Satoshi Nakamoto: The Bitcoin Creator Mystery | Young Platform - Young Platform",
        "content": "The identity of Bitcoin\u2018s creator is a mystery: we know their pseudonym, but no one has ever managed to find out who Satoshi Nakamoto is. On the Internet we can find a few clues, emails and posts in old forums, we know that they have been nominated for a Nobel Prize and we can perhaps estimate their net worth, but they seem destined for eternal anonymity in any case.\n\nWho is Satoshi Nakamoto?\n\nWe don\u2019t know their real name, but they are absurdly the most renowned person in the crypto world: who is Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, and what is their net worth? On 31 October 2008, on the crypto enthusiast website metzdowd.com, they shared the whitepaper of their cryptocurrency: \u2018A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\u2019. This paper presents the philosophy and functioning of a decentralised digital currency, exchanged without the need for intermediaries (Peer-to-Peer), whose transactions are stored in a shared ledger (the blockchain), so as to prove the ownership of the coins and prevent attempts at \u2018double spending\u2019.\n\nOn 3 January 2009, the project came to fruition: Satoshi Nakamoto themselves created the genesis block of Bitcoin, inserting a message as a warning.\n\n\u201cThe Times 3 January 2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\u201d\n\nThis Times headline is iconic for the crisis years that motivated Bitcoin\u2019s creator. In a nutshell, Satoshi reflected on the fragility of the traditional financial system, dependent on trust in centralised authorities, and proposed an alternative based on cryptography.\n\nThis project perfectly represents who Satoshi Nakamoto is: a revolutionary who, having solved the problem of money, chose anonymity to give up control and return power to individuals. Bitcoin, in fact, does not need its creator to function, because its decentralised system is managed by a network of equal nodes, which follow the rules of an impartial algorithm.\n\nThe creator of Bitcoin: from forums to the Nobel Prize\n\nTheir willingness to remain anonymous has not stopped the curious people who, for years now, have been wondering who Satoshi Nakamoto is and trying to find out as many details about them as possible, such as their net worth. There is an entire archive of emails, forum posts and even quotes from the Bitcoin creator: a sort of \u2018digital identity\u2019, but one that describes a character in search of an author. We can appreciate their discussions on BitcoinTalk, the online space they founded. Here we find, for instance, exchanges of banter with Hal Finney, the cryptographer who defined the risk of double spending for Bitcoin.\n\nSatoshi\u2019s last post in this forum, dated 12 December 2010, emphasised the need to improve Bitcoin\u2019s protocol, but this is not their final message to the world. In fact, they later wrote other e-mails to two collaborators of the project: some to Mike Hearn, on 23 April 2011, after they gave the Bitcoin source code to Gavin Andresen:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve moved on to other things. It\u2019s in good hands with Gavin and everyone.\u201d\n\nThe second to Gavin himself, a few days later, saying not to speak of them as a \u2018mysterious figure\u2018, because it would have given Bitcoin the reputation of a \u2018pirate currency\u2018, but rather to emphasise the project being open-source. We do not know what Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s new interests are, but they probably withdrew from the scene to prevent their words from affecting the value of their creation. In any case, they were taken literally, because many still contribute freely to the development of Bitcoin\u2019s algorithm today.\n\nThe profile on the P2P Foundation forum, on the other hand, gives us perhaps the best clues: male, Japanese, 47 years old; probably fictitious data, but it has sparked speculation. So much so that, in 2014, an article was published in the online publication Newsweek recognising the creator of Bitcoin in Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto, a 64-year-old Japanese programmer from California.\n\nIf we search online for \u2018who is Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019 we find the face of Dorian, but he himself has denied being the creator of the cryptocurrency. To confirm this, the real one broke his silence on the P2P forum: \u2018I am not Dorian Nakamoto\u2018. By contrast, in 2016 the Bitcoin creator did not comment on their nomination for the Nobel Prize in Economics, proposed by Bhagwan Chowdhry, a professor at California University. In the end, Satoshi did not win the Nobel, but even today the crypto community on Twitter is convinced they deserved it.\n\nWho is behind Satoshi Nakamoto: possible identities\n\nThe enigma concealing the name of Bitcoin\u2019s creator is more complex than mining calculations. However, crypto-enthusiasts never give up: searching for who Satoshi Nakamoto is, they have formulated several hypotheses.\n\nWe already know Hal Finney, the first person to receive a transaction in Bitcoin from Nakamoto in January 2009. Finney also helped overhaul BTC\u2019s software before it was launched. Unfortunately, in August 2014, he lost his battle against ALS, but decided to hibernate to see the future. For many, this sad event would explain the Bitcoin creator\u2019s silence since the Dorian affair.\n\nWe can still name Gavin Andresen among the candidates: in addition to receiving the source code, he was the creator of the first Bitcoin faucet, a site to distribute BTC via a sort of airdrop. If he were Satoshi Nakamoto, that would be a great way to redistribute his net worth!\n\nOther clues lead to Adam Back, identified as a possible Satoshi Nakamoto by the Financial Times in 2016. He is the cypherpunk and cryptographer who created the HashCash: Bitcoin\u2019s Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm, which is fundamental to recording transactions and producing blocks. Nakamoto also sent a preview of Bitcoin\u2019s whitepaper to him and Wei Dai, the engineer who created b money, one of the first digital currency projects."

        "content": "Russia-linked cryptocurrency exchange Bitzlato has partially restored access to user funds despite being officially seized by European authorities.\n\nBitzlato has enabled its users to withdraw up to 50% of assets stuck on the platform due to enforcement from the United States and Europol, the firm announced on its Telegram channel on March 20.\n\nAccording to the statement, Bitzlato users can now restore half of their assets using the Telegram bot \u2014 bz_phoenix_bot \u2014 which allows users to move assets from the web Bitzlato account to an external wallet or exchange.\n\nAll withdrawals from Bitzlato are processed in Bitcoin (BTC), as the platform converted all altcoin holdings by users into BTC when the service was halted on Jan. 18. According to the firm, Bitzlato had to convert user balances to Bitcoin due to technical difficulties associated with servicing multiple altcoins after Bitzlato was seized.\n\nIn a public Bitzlato chat, several alleged Bitzlato users said they were able to move their Bitcoin to exchanges like ByBit and Binance. Some alleged Bitzlato clients also reportedly used software wallets like Trust Wallet and ViaBtc, and hardware wallets like Ledger, to withdraw their Bitcoin.\n\nBitzlato\u2019s 50% withdrawal option follows its previously announced roadmap on restoring users\u2019 access to the platform and resuming operations. According to the plan, Bitzlato will continue its work to restore the platform and aims to provide a service for peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency trading by early April 2023.\n\nA number of users have preferred not to withdraw 50% of their assets from Bitzlato this time, opting to wait until the exchange restores P2P trading. Once the P2P platform is restored, users will be able to access all previously available functions, a spokesperson for Bitzlato told Cointelegraph.\n\nBitzlato users should not expect to recover the remaining 50% of their assets once the P2P exchange is launched, the representative said.\n\n\u201cThere will be no second half once the P2P is opened since these are two unrelated questions and processes,\u201d the Bitzlato spokesperson added.\n\nRelated: Binance\u2019s response to U.S. Senators lacks financial information: Report\n\nAccording to the representative, the issue with client funds has not yet been resolved, but Bitzlato plans to return the money either by restoring access to seized funds by Europol or from the company\u2019s funds. The spokesperson said:\n\n\u201cLawyers have disputed the decision of the French government, and if the outcome is favorable, the funds will be returned [...] If it does not work out, the users have to wait until the firm earns enough to compensate for the losses.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, the United States Department of Justice announced a major international crypto enforcement action against Bitzlato in mid-January. Europol subsequently said that European authorities seized more than $19 million in crypto from Bitzlato as part of the enforcement actions.\n\nMagazine: Crypto winter can take a toll on hodlers\u2019 mental health"

        "content": "Ark's Cathie Wood: Bitcoin's Strength Through Bank Crisis Will Attract Institutional Investors\n\nListen to the CoinMarketRecap podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify and Google Podcasts\n\nArk Invest's Cathie Wood predicted that Bitcoin's strength during the recent banking crisis will bring back institutional investors who have been pushed away by regulators focusing attention on the bitcoins on their balance sheets.\n\nBitcoin is up almost 70% this year and 21% this month as small crypto-friendly banks like Silvergate and Signature were lost along with Silicon Valley Bank, and even mainstream banks like First Republic and Credit Suisse have been hit hard enough to require big rescues and in the latter's case, a bargain basement buyout.\n\nSpeaking to Bloomberg on March 21, Wood noted that \"one of the things that happens in a crisis is liquidity dries out so that that tends to hurt assets.\" But, she added:\n\nIn a recent report, Ark recommended that institutional investors interested in digital assets should target 2.5% to 6.5% to Bitcoin, she said.\n\n\"So not crazy,\" Wood added. She said:\n\nIn Ark's Big Ideas 2023 report, the base case Bitcoin price prediction was $682,000 by 2030, while the bear case was more than $250,000 and the bull case nearly $1.5 million.\n\nWood said the base case price, she believes, is \"quite conservative.\"\n\nLast week, Ark Invest revealed that it has raised $16 million for a new private crypto fund.\n\nMeanwhile, Wood, who has been buying swaths of Coinbase shares over the last few months, sold $13.5 million worth of COIN on March 21.\n\nThat's after Ark Invest bought about $30 million worth in February and another $30 million in the week of March 6. After its last buy, on March 10, Ark Invest owned 9.9 million shares of Coinbase. Wood has long been a strong supporter of Coinbase, despite its abysmal performance in 2022, when its share price declined 86%.\n\nThat said, she did make some big sells last year, dumping 1.4 million in July alone, although she bought a lot later in the year.\n\nSo what happened? Well, COIN is up almost 150% since the beginning of the year, closing at $83.99 on Tuesday after starting the year at $33.60. And it's up more than a third since March 10. So, while she is a long-term investor, a bit of profit taking does seem like a possibility."

Every big bank now has a substantive crypto desk, not just for trading, but for partnerships as well.\u201d\n\nHowever, he said that there\u2019s still a divide between traditional financial institutions and crypto firms, which has caused headwinds in institutional adoption over the last few months.\n\n\u201cHistorically, those big players have been the biggest drivers of innovation,\u201d he said, adding that the two sides are currently \u201cstuck in a bit of a rut\u201d and that the \u201cbig change\u201d won\u2019t happen until they stop fighting for superiority.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not crypto versus Goldman Sachs or crypto versus institutions. It\u2019s a race to who can do crypto better.\u201d\n\nAs for the impact on Bitcoin\u2019s price from the institutional interest, Wood explained in the interview that ARK Invest\u2019s $1-1.5 million BTC price prediction by 2030 was made on the back of an institutional investor BTC allocation analysis, which estimates most firms would allocate between 2.5% to 6.5% to BTC in their investment portfolios.\n\n\u201cThese are the sorts of allocations that they would have made to emerging, new categories of assets like real estate in the 70s and small caps in the 80s and 90s,\u201d Wood added.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin holds $28K due to spot buying, but institutional investors are still selling\n\nARK Invest estimates the BTC price towards $1.5 million will be pushed by institutional investors allocating between 2.5-6.5% of their portfolio into BTC. Source: ARK Invest\n\nLinch, on the other hand, believes that \u201caggressive\u201d institutional adoption will come when opportunities become more easily identifiable:\n\n\u201cShow them a way that it can be done and it can make them money and I guarantee you they won\u2019t stand in the way of that. They\u2019ll be pedal to the metal to exploit that opportunity.\u201d\n\nPositive sentiment has surrounded Bitcoin following the collapses of Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature banks. BTC has surged 43.6% since its most recent low on March 11, compared with a 25.3% increase in the broader crypto market over that time, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nMagazine: Unstablecoins: Depegging, bank runs and other risks loom"

It supports over 180 fiat currencies and has collectively performed nearly 22.6 million transactions worldwide.\n\nThe BATMs are designed to connect to a crypto application server (CAS), which are either managed by the customer or by the company itself on the cloud via infrastructure provided by DigitalOcean.\n\nIt also warned that its own cloud service as well as other operators' standalone servers were infiltrated as a result of the incident, prompting the company to shutter the service.\n\nIn addition to urging customers to keep their crypto application servers (CASs) behind a firewall and a VPN, it's also recommending to rotate all users' passwords and API keys to exchanges and hot wallets.\n\n\"The CAS security fix is provided in two server patch releases, 20221118.48 and 20230120.44,\" General Bytes said in the advisory.\n\nThe company further emphasized that it had conducted multiple security audits since 2021 and that none of them flagged this vulnerability. It appears to have been unpatched since version 20210401.\n\nGeneral Bytes did not disclose the exact amount of funds stolen by the hackers, but an analysis of the cryptocurrency wallets used in the attack reveals the receipt of 56.283 BTC ($1.5 million), 21.823 ETH ($36,500), and 1,219.183 LTC ($96,500).\n\nThe ATM hack is the second breach targeting General Bytes in less than a year, with another zero-day flaw in its ATM servers exploited to steal crypto from its customers in August 2022."

        "content": "Hackers drained millions of dollars in digital coins from cryptocurrency ATMs by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability, leaving customers on the hook for losses that can\u2019t be reversed, the kiosk manufacturer has revealed.\n\nThe heist targeted ATMs sold by General Bytes, a company with multiple locations throughout the world. These BATMs, short for bitcoin ATMs, can be set up in convenience stores and other businesses to allow people to exchange bitcoin for other currencies and vice versa. Customers connect the BATMs to a crypto application server (CAS) that they can manage or, until now, that General Bytes could manage for them. For reasons that aren\u2019t entirely clear, the BATMs offer an option that allows customers to upload videos from the terminal to the CAS using a mechanism known as the master server interface.\n\nGoing, going, gone\n\nOver the weekend, General Bytes revealed that more than $1.5 million worth of bitcoin had been drained from CASes operated by the company and by customers. To pull off the heist, an unknown threat actor exploited a previously unknown vulnerability that allowed it to use this interface to upload and execute a malicious Java application. The actor then drained various hot wallets of about 56 BTC, worth roughly $1.5 million. General Bytes patched the vulnerability 15 hours after learning of it, but due to the way cryptocurrencies work, the losses were unrecoverable.\n\nGeneral Bytes officials wrote:\n\nThe night of 17-18 March was the most challenging time for us and some of our clients. The entire team has been working around the clock to collect all data regarding the security breach and is continuously working to resolve all cases to help clients back online and continue to operate their ATMs as soon as possible. We apologize for what happened and will review all our security procedures and are currently doing everything we can to keep our affected customers afloat.\n\nThe post said the flow of the attack was:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. The attacker identified a security vulnerability in the master service interface the BATMs use to upload videos to the CAS. 2. The attacker scanned the IP address space managed by cloud host DigitalOcean Ocean to identify running CAS services on ports 7741, including the General Bytes Cloud service and other BATM operators running their servers on Digital Ocean. 3. Exploiting the vulnerability, the attacker uploaded the Java application directly to the application server used by the admin interface. The application server was, by default, configured to start applications in its deployment folder.\n\nOnce the malicious application executed on a server, the threat actor was able to (1) access the database, (2) read and decrypt encoded API keys needed to access funds in hot wallets and exchanges, (3) transfer funds from hot wallets to a wallet controlled by the threat actor, (4) download user names and password hashes and turn off 2FA, and (5) access terminal event logs and scan for instances where customers scanned private keys at the ATM. The sensitive data in step 5 had been logged by older versions of ATM software.\n\nBATM customers on their own now\n\nGoing forward, this weekend\u2019s post said, General Bytes will no longer manage CASes on behalf of customers. That means terminal holders will have to manage the servers themselves. The company is also in the process of collecting data from customers to validate all losses related to the hack, performing an internal investigation, and cooperating with authorities in an attempt to identify the threat actor.\n\nGeneral Bytes said the company has received \u201cmultiple security audits since 2021,\u201d and that none of them detected the vulnerability exploited. The company is now in the process of seeking further help in securing its BATMs.\n\nThe incident underscores the risk of storing cryptocurrencies in Internet-accessible wallets, commonly called hot wallets. Over the years, hot wallets have been illegally drained of untold amounts of digital coin by attackers who exploit various vulnerabilities in cryptocurrency infrastructures or by tricking wallet holders into providing the encryption keys required to make withdrawals.\n\nSecurity practitioners have long advised people to store funds in cold wallets, meaning they\u2019re not directly accessible to the Internet. Unfortunately, BATMs and other types of cryptocurrency ATMs generally can\u2019t follow this best practice because the terminals must be connected to hot wallets so that they can make transactions in real time. That means BATMs are likely to remain a prime target for hackers."

Steve Marcus/Reuters\n\nWharton professor Jeremy Siegel said bitcoin's recent boost will fade out once people start trusting banks again.\n\nHe said cryptocurrencies push a narrative that the conventional financial system is terrible, helping drive bitcoin gains amid a banking crisis.\n\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency is trading around the $28,000 mark \u2013 it's highest level in nine months.\n\nWharton professor Jeremy Siegel has weighed in on bitcoin's recent rally, spurred on by the recent banking crisis.\n\n\"My feeling is when people feel they're safe in the banks again, bitcoin will go back down,\" the economist said in a weekly blog.\n\nBitcoin has enjoyed attractive gains in the wake of a string of bank collapses and expectations that the Federal Reserve will ease up on its aggressive interest-rate policy.\n\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency has surged about 37% since early March when chaos in the banking sector erupted due to the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Turmoil in the financial industry has extended through March, following the government-backed takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS in Switzerland, and escalating pressures on San Francisco-based First Republic Bank.\n\nThe logic behind bitcoin's gains seems to be tied to diminished confidence in the financial sector, causing investors to turn to the digital-asset industry which boasts benefits not offered by the US banking system \u2013 a decentralized currency.\n\n\"Bitcoin was launched with a mantra that the banking system was terrible, and the economy needed an alternative.

        "content": "Nonfungible token marketplace Magic Eden has launched its own \u201cfully audited\u201d marketplace for Bitcoin Ordinals, leveraging the surging interest in \u201cBitcoin NFTs.\u201d\n\nThe newly launched marketplace allows Bitcoin (BTC) NFT traders to buy and sell Bitcoin Ordinal collections, giving users a similar experience to the one that Magic Eden offers for Polygon, Ethereum and Solana-based NFTs.\n\nExtremely excited to announce that @MagicEden is now on Bitcoin. With this, we are simplifying the journey for collectors and creators to get started on Bitcoin - the granddaddy of all chains. Kudos to @kevcode_art @zhouzhuojie @ChartFuMonkey who championed this effort. https://t.co/0W7i0uBvPT \u2014 Zhuoxun Yin (@ZhuoxunYin) March 21, 2023\n\n\u201cJust as we have expanded into other chains, we now aim to bring our expertise in building marketplaces to the nascent, yet flourishing Ordinals ecosystem,\u201d the firm said in a March 21 statement.\n\nThe new Ordinals protocol was introduced in January by former Bitcoin core contributor Casey Rodarmor. Since then, the popularity of Bitcoin Ordinals has surged.\n\nAccording to data from Dune analytics, between Feb. 1 and March 1, the total number of Bitcoin Ordinals inscriptions surged from 679 to 240,000. As of March 21, a total of 567,087 have been inscribed.\n\n\u201cWe paid close attention to the release of Ordinal Theory and the lightning pace of adoption that soon followed,\u201d said Magic Eden, adding:\n\n\u201cOur marketplace was built within a month, culminating in a hackathon in California with over a dozen devs.\u201d\n\nCurrently, the marketplace only supports secondary sales of Bitcoin Ordinals. The marketplace said it is also looking into future tools that would allow creators to more easily mint or inscribe Bitcoin NFTs, such as its launchpad, which it offers for other chains.\n\nIn order to enable permissionless swaps, it uses partially signed Bitcoin transactions \u2014 a Bitcoin standard that allows multiple parties to sign the same transaction \u2014 rather than smart contracts.\n\nThe marketplace launched with over 70 collections. Source: Magic Eden\n\nMeanwhile, Magic Eden says while there will be no royalty support for the marketplace, it is \u201cactively looking\u201d into this, adding there is \u201cvery little tooling and no secure and trustless enforcement solutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith no royalty standard today, we have decided to launch on Bitcoin without royalty support for now,\u201d said Magic Eden.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this is most in-line with the ethos of the ecosystem, and despite this, we are actively looking into the development of an on-chain, permissionless royalty standard and are committed to working with creators and the greater community,\u201d it added.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin thought leaders weigh the pros and cons of Ordinals\n\nOther Bitcoin Ordinals marketplaces have already launched, including ORDX and Generative XYZ, which launched in February.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\n\"Bitcoin NFTs\" have taken off over the last two months thanks to the launch of Ordinals, a protocol that lets people digitally imprint media and text on the original blockchain\u2014with more than 500,000 such \u201cinscriptions\u201d made to date. Now, one of the leading NFT marketplaces on other chains has made a move to support Bitcoin, as well.\n\nMagic Eden, the largest Solana NFT marketplace, announced today that it has added support for Bitcoin Ordinals. It\u2019s the latest multi-chain move for the startup\u2014which was valued at $1.6 billion as of June 2022\u2014after expanding to Ethereum and Polygon last year.\n\nOrdinals are a relatively new breakthrough for Bitcoin, enabling the on-chain storage of media without the use of smart contracts as on other chains, and much of the tooling is still being built in real time. As a result, minting, handling, and trading Ordinals is a more complicated process than on other chains like Ethereum and Solana, thanks in part to the lack of infrastructure.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven so, Magic Eden says that its Ordinals marketplace experience will be similar to what users are used to experiencing on its platform.\n\nAs a non-custodial marketplace, Magic Eden itself never takes control of assets being traded, and it will support the Ordinals-compatible Hiro and Xverse wallets at launch. Magic Eden claims that it is the first fully audited Ordinals marketplace.\n\n\u201cThe core marketplace functionality should feel really, really similar for users, and hopefully it gives people the perception that the [Ordinals] hurdle is not crazy,\u201d said Magic Eden co-founder and COO Zhuoxun Yun. \u201cAs long as I have a little bit of Bitcoin in my wallet, I can just get going and it would feel the same as if I'm trying to try to buy something on ETH.\u201d\n\nMagic Eden\u2019s marketplace launch suggests that Ordinals tooling and infrastructure are spinning up quickly. As recently as early February, when Bitcoin NFT buzz was first heating up, some traders were using public spreadsheets and Airtable forms to coordinate asking prices and trades, since formal marketplaces still hadn\u2019t been developed.\n\nThe first Bitcoin Ordinals marketplaces, including ORDX and Generative, launched later in February, with others joining the fray since\u2014including Gamma, a marketplace first established for NFTs on Stacks, a Bitcoin scaling network. Trustless marketplaces, including the Magic Eden one, are a big step up for Ordinals in terms of security, accessibility, and scalability.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYun said that interest from creators will help dictate the future direction for Magic Eden\u2019s Bitcoin marketplace. It\u2019s still relatively early days for Ordinals, but even so, the limitations of the protocol suggest that it\u2019s a better fit for some types of on-chain assets\u2014like limited edition artwork\u2014than others, such as large-scale video game NFT collections.\n\nStill, Magic Eden already has some plans ahead. Right now, the Ordinals marketplace is focused on secondary market sales, but the firm plans to offer future tools for minting (or inscribing) digital assets onto the Bitcoin blockchain. Yun said it\u2019s still unclear whether that will take the form of a minting launchpad, which it offers on Solana and other platforms, or auctions.\n\nIgor Milihram, who handles business development for Magic Eden, said that the idea of inscribing digital artifacts on Bitcoin lit a spark under the team, who \u201cfell in love\u201d with the idea of Bitcoin NFTs. Having the artwork stored fully on-chain gives Ordinals a different value proposition than some other NFT chains, too.\n\n\u201cIt stays on every node, forever,\u201d he told Decrypt. \u201cEven if the apocalypse hits, there will be computers that will have Bitcoin on their hard [drives], and they will be able to spin it up. It's kind of undestroyable in that way. And that gives those assets more value.\u201d"

        "content": "The leader of a prominent banking company offered some harsh criticism of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) in 2017. While criticism is nothing new, the person who made the comments at the time is generating interest in these comments made more than five years ago.\n\nWhat Happened: Swiss bank Credit Suisse AG (NYSE:CS) is among the banking giants that have struggled in recent months. The troubles eventually led to the bank being bought out by Swiss peer UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) at a discount.\n\nWith several banks collapsing and questions about the banking industry, some experts have suggested investment in the leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cRich Dad, Poor Dad\u201d author Robert Kiyosaki has told investors to buy gold, silver and Bitcoin with banks in trouble.\n\nThe leader of one of the banks in trouble spoke out against Bitcoin in 2017, something fans of the cryptocurrency haven\u2019t forgotten.\n\nTidjane Thiam, the former CEO of Credit Suisse, called Bitcoin a bubble while speaking at a press conference on Nov. 2, 2017, CoinDesk reported.\n\n\u201cFrom what we can identity, the only reason today to buy or sell Bitcoin is to make money, which is the very definition of speculation and the very definition of a bubble,\u201d Thiam said.\n\nThiam also mentioned the close links to Bitcoin and crime saying that banks like Credit Suisse \u201chave little or no appetite to get involved in a currency which has such anti-money laundering challenges.\u201d\n\nThiam is not the only critic of Bitcoin. Other prominent investors such as Warren Buffett and Ray Dalio have spoken out against Bitcoin, with Buffett referring to the cryptocurrency as \u201crat poison squared.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon has been one of the banking CEOs speaking out against Bitcoin for years.\n\nThiam resigned from Credit Suisse in February 2020, after being CEO since March 2015. Thiam is now the chairman of Freedom Acquisition I Corp (NYSE:FACT), a SPAC merging with Complete Solaria, a solar company.\n\nWhile Credit Suisse was not led by Thiam recently, Twitter user Joe Burnett, an analyst at Blockware Solutions, shared the details.\n\n\u201cOver 5 years ago, the CEO of Credit Suisse called Bitcoin a bubble. Since then, BTC is up 318% and Credit Suisse just sold for 1/5 the size of Dogecoin,\u201d Burnett tweeted.\n\nThe tweet generated a face with tears of joy emoji response from Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao, the CEO and co-founder of Binance.\n\nRelated Link: How To Buy Bitcoin\n\nInvesting $1,000 in Bitcoin: Hearing the CEO of one of the largest banks in the world call Bitcoin a bubble might have scared many investors away. The comments also might have led some investors to believe that they could get in before major banks catch onto the capabilities and investment cases for cryptocurrency.\n\nWith Bitcoin trading at $6,758.72 on Nov. 2, 2017, a person could have bought 0.1480 BTC with $1,000. The same $1,000 investment would be worth $4,151.97.\n\nThis represents a return of 315.2% in a period of 5.33 years for an average annual return of 59.1%.\n\nInvestors could have listened to the comments about Bitcoin being a bubble and invested the $1,000 in shares of Credit Suisse instead. A $1,000 investment could have purchased 61.5 shares of Credit Suisse at the time.\n\nThe $1,000 investment in Credit Suisse would be worth $60.28 today based on a price of 98 cents per share at the time of writing. This represents a loss of 93.9% on the investment, or an average annual loss of 17.6%.\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), which tracks the S&P 500, is up 155.2% over the same time period, representing an average annual gain of 29.1%.\n\nRead Next: 10 Things Credit Suisse Is Older Than: Light Bulbs, Telephones, Radios, Sports Leagues And More\n\nPhoto: Marko Aliaksandr via Shutterstock\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Print this page\n\nMuch as it can be enjoyable to poke fun at the crypto bros \u2014 with their silly memes, irritating acronyms, puerile jokes and frankly ridiculous ideas about the world \u2014 I have to confess: I don\u2019t believe they\u2019re the main problem. As far as I\u2019m concerned it\u2019s the earnest, strait-laced types who insist that we should all be taking the whole thing terribly seriously who pose the biggest threat to our survival as a rational and prosperous society. Welcome to the plague of what I like to call \u201csensible crypto\u201d.\n\nWhat I am talking about when I use this oxymoron is the men in suits \u2014 and it is most commonly men, though there are women too \u2014 who will tell you that sure, the vast majority of cryptoland is a gigantic grift, but that their crypto coin is going to change the way we send money around the world, making the financial system fairer and more inclusive and democratic.\n\nIt\u2019s the political leaders who insist that we must embrace this noxious industry in order to stay at the cutting edge of innovation. It\u2019s the Wall Street types with money to lose who appear on CNBC to tell the less well-off that crypto is a safe place to put their money. And yes, it\u2019s the crypto exchange bosses who don\u2019t care about the Lambos and designer clothes; they just want to make a few billion dollars so they give it all away and make the world a better place.\n\nThese people lend credibility to a high-risk, opaque and ill-understood industry that should be thought of as something between a multilevel marketing scheme and a Ponzi scheme, that preys on \u2014 and indeed relies upon \u2014 those who cannot afford to gamble their money away.\n\nOne way these sensible crypto types exert influence is via central bank digital currencies. You might think these CBDCs should have little to do with crypto, given they would be centrally issued and controlled, and that cryptocurrencies are not used as money but as a means of speculating. And you would be right. But the argument for CBDCs \u2014 that they could allow for quicker, cheaper, more efficient transfers of money \u2014 is also one of the arguments pushed by crypto, and thus CBDCs pose a direct threat.\n\nThis week the Digital Pound Foundation will be holding an event, The Geopolitical Case for a Digital Pound, at which the Bank of England\u2019s head of future technology is due to speak. This follows last month\u2019s announcement that the BoE and Treasury are jointly designing a \u201cdigital pound\u201d that could replace cash by the end of this decade. This all sounds sensible enough.\n\nBut who are the Digital Pound Foundation? They pitch themselves as an \u201cindependent forum supporting the implementation of a well-designed digital pound\u201d, and say that their motive is to \u201cdrive forward the UK\u2019s transition to a digital economy\u201d. But they are probably more interested in driving forward crypto. The board of directors consists of three people: two founder-CEOs of relatively obscure crypto projects, and the \u201chead of policy\u201d at Ripple, the company behind the XRP token, who chairs the Digital Pound Foundation but who happens to be based in the global hub of the crypto lobbying industry: Washington DC.\n\n\u201cThe crypto industry\u2019s number one objective is to sell crypto . . . and to legitimise it,\u201d Martin Walker, a longtime crypto critic and the director of banking and finance at the Center for Evidence-Based Management, tells me. \u201cIf CBDCs actually took off . . . it would totally destroy one of the crypto narratives.\u201d\n\nRipple is an example of sensible crypto in its own right. This is a company that sells itself to banks as a payment settlement solution, whose CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in 2020 that \u201conce regulators understand you\u2019re not circumventing regulatory frameworks they get very comfortable very quickly\u201d. His confidence was misplaced: later that year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission sued the company, alleging that they had \u201craised over $1.3bn through an unregistered . . . digital asset securities offering\u201d. (Ripple has denied the claim, and the case is ongoing.)\n\nThe legitimisation of crypto is happening in UK politics too. Rishi Sunak suggested last year, while he was chancellor of the exchequer, that Britain should become a \u201cglobal cryptoassets hub\u201d. MPs have also established a \u201ccentral bank and digital currency\u201d all-party-parliamentary group whose secretariat is \u2014 surprise \u2014 a crypto company.\n\nThey might use real words and speak in complete sentences; they might turn up at banking conferences and speak sombrely about financial inclusion; but we must see this crypto crowd for what they really are: snake-oil salesmen in sensible clothing.\n\njemima.kelly@ft.com"

        "title": "Mt. Gox creditor saga: What lessons has the Bitcoin community learned? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "In the early days of Bitcoin, Mt. Gox was by far the most prominent Bitcoin (BTC) exchange in the world. The Tokyo-based company was responsible for more than 70% of all Bitcoin transactions in 2013. However, by early 2014, it had collapsed spectacularly, leaving investors and traders with losses amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nThe downfall of Mt. Gox was a defining moment in the history of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general, with several regulators, market analysts and industry experts continuing to study the case to prevent such instances in the future. Moreover, the saga has continued to serve as a cautionary tale for the cryptocurrency industry, highlighting the potential risks and pitfalls associated with digital currency trading and investments.\n\nMt. Gox: The early years\n\nMt. Gox was launched in 2010 by Jed McCaleb, a programmer and entrepreneur who had previously founded the file-sharing network eDonkey2000. At the time, Bitcoin was still a niche technology that was largely unknown outside of a small group of enthusiasts and developers. Mt. Gox was one of the first exchanges that allowed users to buy and sell Bitcoin for fiat assets, thereby quickly amassing a high degree of popularity among early adopters and traders.\n\nRecent: 4 out of 10 NFT sales are fake: Learn to spot the signs of wash trading\n\nIn 2011, McCaleb sold Mt. Gox to Mark Karpeles, a French software developer who had previously worked on various projects, including an online marketplace called \u201cMagic: The Gathering Online Exchange.\u201d Karpeles moved the company\u2019s headquarters to Tokyo and began to expand its operations, opening up new markets and adding support for additional cryptocurrencies. This transformed Mt. Gox into the most prominent crypto trading ecosystem of the early 2010s.\n\nThe hack\n\nIn February 2014, Mt. Gox abruptly halted all withdrawals from its platform, citing technical issues and security concerns. The company\u2019s website went offline, and rumors circulated that the exchange had been hacked. A few days later, Karpeles held a press conference in Tokyo where he confirmed that Mt. Gox had indeed been hacked, and miscreants had stolen 850,000 Bitcoin \u2014 worth approximately $450 million at the time.\n\nThe Mt. Gox hack was one of the largest thefts in the history of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, and it had a significant impact on the broader industry. The price of Bitcoin dropped sharply in the days following the announcement, with many investors and traders losing confidence in the security and reliability of digital currency exchanges.\n\nMt. Gox hack aftermath\n\nIn the months following the Mt. Gox hack, there was great uncertainty and confusion about what had happened to the stolen Bitcoin, and who was responsible for the theft. Karpeles initially claimed that the coins had been stolen due to a \u201cbug\u201d in Mt. Gox\u2019s software, but experts and members of the Bitcoin community widely criticized this explanation.\n\nIn March 2014, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan, and Japanese authorities seized the company\u2019s assets. Karpeles was eventually arrested and charged with embezzlement and fraud in connection with the exchange\u2019s collapse, but he has consistently maintained his innocence, claiming that he was simply a victim of circumstances beyond his control.\n\nLogarithmic Bitcoin price chart on Mt. Gox from February 2012\u2013February 2014. Source: Bitcoincharts\n\nThe Mt. Gox bankruptcy proceedings were complicated and protracted, with multiple legal challenges and competing claims from creditors and investors. In 2018, a Japanese court ruled that Mt. Gox\u2019s assets should be liquidated and distributed among its creditors \u2014 a process that is still ongoing.\n\nHow are the reimbursement proceedings going?\n\nIn 2018, after several years of legal battles and investigations, a Japanese court approved a plan to compensate the victims of the Mt. Gox hack. The plan, which a court-appointed trustee proposed, called for the creation of a trust to hold the remaining Bitcoin and distribute them to the creditors. The trustee, Nobuaki Kobayashi, was tasked with overseeing the distribution of the remaining funds.\n\nThe first step in the plan was to convert the remaining Bitcoin into cash. The trustee sold over 35,000 BTC and 34,000 Bitcoin Cash (BCH) on various cryptocurrency exchanges, raising over $400 million. This was a significant achievement, as it represented the largest sale of cryptocurrency by a single entity in history.\n\nDelays galore\n\nIn March 2020, the trustee announced that a new system had been implemented to allow creditors to make claims for the remaining funds. Creditors were required to submit proof of their claim, including documentation such as bank statements, transaction records and identification documents. The deadline for submitting claims was set for October 2020, which was subsequently pushed back to December.\n\nIn December 2020, the trustee announced that it had received claims from 99.9% of the creditors. The total amount of claims submitted was approximately $16 billion, which was significantly higher than the remaining funds available for distribution. This presented a significant challenge for Kobayashi, as he had to determine how to distribute the remaining funds fairly.\n\nIn January 2021, the trustee submitted a draft rehabilitation plan to the court. The plan proposed that the remaining funds be distributed in Bitcoin rather than cash, as this would avoid the need to sell the remaining cryptocurrency and risk affecting the market. The plan also proposed that the creditors be given the option to receive reimbursement in Bitcoin or cash, with the conversion rate based on the market price at the time of distribution.\n\nAs expected, the proposed rehabilitation plan received mixed reactions from the creditors. Some creditors welcomed the plan, as it offered the possibility of a higher reimbursement if the price of Bitcoin increased. However, others were skeptical, as the value of Bitcoin is highly volatile and subject to significant fluctuations. Some creditors also expressed concerns about the potential tax implications of receiving reimbursement in Bitcoin.\n\nRecent developments\n\nDuring the first week of September 2022, Kobayashi announced that former Mt. Gox customers had until Sept. 15 to make or transfer a claim. This date was then pushed back to Jan. 10, 2023, with Kobayashi urging creditors to complete the necessary steps before the deadline.\n\nKobayashi informed creditors that those individuals who failed to do so would be unable to receive their funds quickly or would be required to supply several documents to the firm\u2019s head office in Japan. Even then, they would only be able to receive payments in Japanese yen.\n\nHowever, the deadline was moved to March 10, citing the \u201cprogress by rehabilitation creditors\u201d in the selection and registration as a reason for the change. In fact, as part of a March 7 announcement, the trustee reiterated a January notice reminding creditors who had not registered for repayment that they had until March 10 to do so \u2014 two additional months as part of the rehabilitation plan proposed earlier.\n\nKobayashi did not provide a reason for the extension, which would allow individuals who suffered losses at Mt. Gox to select a repayment method and register their information in an online rehabilitation claim filing system.\n\nAdditionally, it bears mentioning that amid all these changes, Mt. Gox Investment Fund \u2014 the largest creditor of the defunct crypto exchange \u2014 opted for an early payout in Bitcoin rather than wait longer for a larger payment after a legal battle. The early payout meant creditors would receive approximately 90% of what was due. The bankruptcy trustee doesn\u2019t have to sell tokens to acquire fiat funds for the payment since the creditor also chose to be paid in BTC.\n\nMost recently, the timeline for filing claims and distribution of assets to Mt. Gox creditors seems to have been amended again. As per an official announcement, the deadline for filing claims has been extended by another month, from March 10 to April 6, 2023, allowing creditors to register their claims for an additional period. The distribution of assets has also been pushed back by another month, with the process now starting on Oct. 31 instead of Sept. 30.\n\nThe official statement released by the Mt. Gox trustee cited several reasons for the delay in the deadlines, including the progress made by rehabilitation creditors in terms of selection and registration. Creditors have multiple options for receiving payments, including a lump-sum payment, bank remittance, via a transfer service provider or a cryptocurrency exchange or custodian.\n\nLessons learned and looking ahead\n\nOne crucial lesson learned from the Mt. Gox collapse is the value of transparency and accountability. Many critics argued that the hack\u2019s severity was partly due to the exchange\u2019s opacity and secrecy regarding its operations. Nowadays, reputable cryptocurrency exchanges are relatively more transparent, with some frequently publishing audits and reports to reassure customers and investors.\n\nRecent: Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s downfall has many causes, but crypto isn\u2019t one\n\nAnother lesson from the Mt. Gox failure was the need for better risk management and financial controls. In the early days of Bitcoin, many exchanges were run by tech enthusiasts and entrepreneurs with little to no experience in finance or risk management. Today, exchanges have more professional and experienced management teams implementing better financial controls and risk management practices.\n\nLastly, the Mt. Gox hack revealed the necessity for improved regulation and oversight of the cryptocurrency industry. Since the collapse, regulators worldwide have proposed new rules and regulations to protect investors and traders, including stricter Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer requirements. While some may view these regulations as excessively restrictive, others believe they are necessary to prevent fraud and safeguard consumers.\n\nThe Mt. Gox incident continues to serve as a cautionary tale regarding digital assets\u2019 potential risks and dangers, emphasizing the need for greater transparency, accountability and risk management."

        "content": "DeGods Takes an Exciting Trip Across the Bitcoin Bridge\n\nPopular NFT PFP project, DeGods, has been plotting to go cross-chain for a while now; however, the project might have just completed one of its biggest cross-overs by bridging to Bitcoin. As such, the collection has engaged with the Ordinals project to bring some of its NFTs onto the undisputed king of distributed ledgers.\n\nFor a start, DeGods will bridge a small portion of its digital collectibles to Bitcoin as part of its long-term vision. At least that is the sentiment of Kevin Henrikson, CEO of Dust Labs, the platform behind DeGods. By doing this, the project hopes to introduce a first-of-its-kind minting experience for fans of the project, on the oldest blockchain network in operation.\n\nAll of the successful minters of the BTC DeGods will be sent their inscriptions immediately after the mint. You will then be free to list it on any marketplace or use our dedicated OTC trading desk in our Discord. Best of luck to everyone. \u2014 DeGods III (@DeGodsNFT) March 17, 2023\n\nLast December, DeGods offered collectors the chance to migrate their NFTs to the Ethereum network. It\u2019s news that wasn\u2019t well received within the Solana community, where the project is native. But, as Henrikson notes, DeGod\u2019s mission is to be the leading NFT community on all chains.\n\n\u201cFirst Solana, now Bitcoin, and soon Polygon and Ethereum once we migrate and grow on those chains. We aren\u2019t just trying to go to every chain but are being thoughtful and purposeful on how it can extend our vision.\u201d\n\nDeGods on Bitcoin\n\nThat said, the latest crossover is dubbed \u201cDeGods on Bitcoin.\u201d As of March 17, the project intended to burn 535 NFTs and mint them on Bitcoin. Of that number, 500 digital avatars will be available on a first-come, first-served basis, and potential bidders will require at least 0.444 BTC or $12,464, as of press time to participate.\n\nThe remaining 35 items will be auctioned for $DUST, the community\u2019s utility token, with all proceeds donated to the DustDAO. The decentralized autonomous organization will be formed to govern the $DUST token after DeGods merges with y00ts.\n\nBy bridging to Bitcoin, DeGods follows in the footsteps of other popular collections that have taken the same route, such as CryptoPunks and OnChainMonkey.\n\nWant more?

        "title": "Bitcoin mining: what it is, how it works and what it means - Young Platform",
        "content": "To understand what Bitcoin mining is and how it works, we have to consider the nature of cryptocurrencies: since there is no central controlling authority, there is no \u2018bank\u2019 that manages BTC exchanges and mints new coins. In fact, Bitcoin is administered by a network of independent nodes that abide by rules defined by an algorithm. This decentralised network is in charge of the shared ledger of transactions: the blockchain, whose blocks of information are created and hooked precisely through Bitcoin mining.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin mining? Meaning and Purpose\n\nSome nodes in Bitcoin\u2018s network solve complex mathematical problems, using sophisticated power and hardware. This fair amount of work goes into producing the blocks of the blockchain, safeguarding its security and issuing new coins. This is the starting point for understanding the meaning of Bitcoin mining, but let\u2019s delve deeper into what it is and how it works.\n\nThe first objective of this process is the validation of transactions: the blocks created contain the information on these exchanges, which are thus stored and confirmed without the possibility of modification. In a nutshell, the blockchain tracks all cryptocurrency movements, so as to provide irrefutable proof of their authenticity and thwart attempts at double-spending. Everything Bitcoin mining records in blocks is verified, without the need for authorities and intermediaries, and is available in an eternal and immutable history.\n\nThe commitment of the nodes that take care of the blockchain must be rewarded, because Bitcoin mining operations are expensive and no one would participate without financial return. Each block, therefore, corresponds to a reward in BTC (block reward), sent to the wallet of the creating node. The second purpose of the mining mechanism, therefore, is the issuance of new coins as a reward: 21 million Bitcoins, the maximum set supply, will be released in this way. In this regard, as we will see in the section explaining how Bitcoin mining works, the incentives are scheduled to gradually decrease over time. In addition to the block reward, fees paid by users to carry out transactions are also distributed.\n\nThe nodes that perform the calculations to create the blocks are called miners, precisely because they \u2018mine\u2018 cryptocurrencies as if they were minerals. This explains the meaning of Bitcoin mining from an etymological point of view. Satoshi Nakamoto\u2018s crypto is also referred to as Digital Gold by the community, although the comparison to gold does not relate to mining, but derives from the reserve quality of value that some recognise in BTC.\n\nHow does Bitcoin mining work?\n\nThe entire network participates in the creation of a block, but it is only one miner who receives the rewards; let\u2019s therefore summarise in essential steps how Bitcoin mining works. First, when a transaction is made on the network, it is transmitted to all nodes. Each of them verifies its validity, based on the rules of cryptography: in a nutshell, by comparing the public key and the sender\u2019s \u2018signature\u2019, it is ascertained that the latter is the legitimate owner of the funds. The transactions, if approved by the majority of the network, are then aggregated in the mempool: a sort of \u2018waiting room\u2019, from which they will be retrieved to be registered on the blockchain. At this point, the miners must create a new blockchain by solving a complex mathematical problem. These nodes compete with each other, because whoever finds the solution first will receive the valuable reward.\n\nIn short, this is the process that explains how Bitcoin mining works, but it is useful to set some technical parameters for a better understanding. First, it is essential to know that Bitcoin blocks must be produced every 10 minutes: this block time is programmed and stored by an algorithm. In practice, an automatic mechanism increases (or decreases) the difficulty of mining, so that the time per block is kept constant. In this way, the blockchain should be protected from spam attacks and, above all, it is possible to predict the distribution rate of new Bitcoins. Every 2016 blocks (approx. 2 weeks), therefore, the average block production period is evaluated and, if necessary, the complexity of the calculations to be performed is corrected.\n\nIn this regard, the puzzle to be solved consists in determining the hash of the block, i.e. the alphanumeric string that identifies it. This sequence is obtained by processing and \u2018summarising\u2019 various pieces of information with a mathematical function. The data to be processed, however, are not only known elements, such as transactions. The real meaning of Bitcoin mining, in fact, lies in finding a random number (nonce) that, together with the other factors, can generate the right hash. Miners basically work by trial and error and, to see if the result is correct, they compare the calculated combination with a target value, defined by the mining difficulty. If the value of your hash is less than or equal to this coefficient, they have found the right sequence.\n\nNB The hash constitutes proof of the work done, which is why Bitcoin\u2019s consensus mechanism is called Proof-of-Work. This algorithm, in general, is employed by all mining-based blockchains.\n\nOnce the exact hash is found, the corresponding block is created and the miner is rewarded with a certain amount of BTC. Initially, the reward was 50 per block, but every 4 years or so (210,000 blocks) it has been halved. Currently, the block reward is 6.25 BTC, but with the next halving, the mining reward will again be reduced by half. This mechanism, together with the fixed time per block, schedules the issuance of the crypto so as to make it a scarce resource and control the inflation rate.\n\nBitcoin mining: cost or profit?\n\nThe price of Bitcoin from the genesis block (3 January 2009) to today has increased exponentially, so the profit from mining should also (in theory) be higher. Halving itself, although reducing the rewards, makes it more profitable, because it generally has a positive effect on the value of the cryptocurrency, as suggested by models such as Stock-to-Flow. In parallel, however, competition between miners has also grown, exploiting increasingly powerful devices. As a result, Bitcoin mining is increasingly difficult, but this is good because it has made the network more secure.\n\nIn practice, a hacker would need to control at least 51% of the total computing capacity (Hash Rate) to attempt to tamper with the blockchain. But since we now know how Bitcoin mining works, we can guess that this is impossible: the Total Hash Rate is very high, as is the difficulty, not to mention that mining devices are very expensive. In fact, it is no longer possible to produce blocks with the CPU of a simple computer, but mining rigs with multiple graphics cards (GPUs) or even Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), hardware designed specifically for mining cryptocurrencies, are used.\n\nNB Given the costs and the fierce competition, many prefer ETFs to actual Bitcoin mining: financial instruments based on the securities of companies engaged in this activity, so as to try to earn money indirectly.\n\nMaking money from home mining, even with the most sophisticated device, however, is unlikely: the only way to get rewards is to join a mining pool. These huge data centres rely on the computing capacity of multiple devices: Foundry USA, AntPool and F2Pool are the main ones. If the devices are hosted in the same place, it\u2019s called a farm, but to participate you can also \u2018rent\u2019 computing capacity through cloud mining solutions. In any case, participating in a pool means paying a fee and sharing the rewards, thus limiting your earnings from mining.\n\nFinally, to complete the explanation of what Bitcoin mining is and how it works, we have to consider the cost of energy, which dwarfs its earnings. Indeed, miners have to use part of the rewards essentially to pay for electricity. In this regard, energy sustainability is one of the most critical aspects of what mining means."

To keep the water inside the bucket at exactly the same level, you set up a mechanism that adds or removes water depending on how far the water level has deviated from the mark. This is controlled by a computer algorithm such that if it rains and the bucket begins to fill up, the algorithm instructs the mechanism to release water out of the bottom of the bucket until it reaches the water level mark. Conversely, if it\u2019s a hot day and water evaporates out of the bucket, the computer algorithm would instruct the mechanism to add more water to the bucket until the correct level is regained."

Like any traditional IRA, your contributions are tax deductible in the year you make them. You'll only pay taxes when you withdraw funds.\n\nJust remember that those tax savings require you to give up some flexibility. Since an IRA is a retirement account, withdrawals made before the age of 59 \u00bd will result in early withdrawal penalties and are subject to income taxes.\n\nLooking for more alternative assets?

Whereas strong leaders embrace it and are looking for this change. He concluded his speech with a three-minute song, which he wrote and performed.\n\nAccording to Draper, the song was written four years ago but is more relevant than ever today. It touched on Satoshi, Bitcoin, banks, governments and the want for a new world order.\n\nRelated: Paris Blockchain Week 2023: First day of the Summit kicks off\n\nBefore he began, he dedicated the song to SVB and \u201call the banks that have failed and will fail.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I dedicated to all those governments that if they don\u2019t trust their people and set them free, they will also fail, and their currencies will also fail.\n\nThe song got a round of applause from the audience, as well as the panelists who followed Draper on the master stage.\n\nHe concluded his time by saying blockchain, Bitcoin and smart contracts are making up one of the \u201cgreatest transitions in the history of the world,\u201d and it should be embraced."

        "title": "Bitcoin's layers - Coinbase",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s development landscape is currently populated by several strategies to enhance the functionality and scalability of the network. These approaches, however, have some key fundamental differences in terms of their architecture, intended utility, and ease of deployment. In this report, we explore the design space for Bitcoin\u2019s \u201clayers\u201d and attempt to characterize the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches currently in development. In our view, the Lightning Network (a layer-2 protocol) has an advantage over alternative scaling approaches because it leverages bitcoin as the native asset. Other solutions introduce external blockchains (or sidechains), new tokens, and bridges that require a trusted third-party, but the Lightning Network is simply a peer-to-peer communications network that interacts directly with Bitcoin\u2019s base layer. The Lightning Network is not without its own issues and limitations, but as a Bitcoin-native solution, it has achieved greater social consensus amongst the Bitcoin development community. This has helped catalyze a growing ecosystem of applications and projects with real-world utility ranging from remittances to content monetization.\n\nBackground Within the context of the blockchain trilemma, the Bitcoin base layer has been optimized for security and decentralization, at the expense of scalability. The network is rate-limited to produce finalized blocks of transactions every ~10 minutes which can be large \u2013 up to 4 megabytes (MB) in size (including up to 1MB of transaction data and 3MB of signature data). On one hand, these limitations are critical in supporting the security and decentralization of the network, as they allow the barriers to entry for participating in protocol consensus to remain low enough (in terms of computation, storage and bandwidth) to be truly permissionless and secure. Conversely, the throughput limitations (~7 transactions per second) inherent to Bitcoin\u2019s base layer make micropayments largely impractical and have historically prevented the protocol from fulfilling a role as an effective medium of exchange. In order to transcend the \u201cdigital gold\u201d narrative and become an effective medium of exchange (able to service billions of users), bitcoin\u2019s infrastructure must scale to facilitate higher throughput and lower cost transactions. That is, as new bitcoin issuance declines (i.e. lower rewards), it\u2019s possible that miners could feel less incentivized to secure the network, and we believe they would need to be compensated by fees generated by demand for blockspace. Therefore, we believe future demand for blockspace will play an important role in the long-term security of the network. Importantly, the result of the block size war in 2017 further ossified the base layer of Bitcoin. One outcome of the block size war was the activation of the SegWit (Segregated Witness) soft fork, which \u201cincreased\u201d the block size by separating the witness data from the transaction data, thus enabling more transactions per block (from 1650 to 2700). (Incidentally, it was this change that ultimately allowed the Lightning Network to be developed.) The success of the \u201csmall-block\u201d cohort ensured that Bitcoin\u2019s block size would not be increased (beyond the limits made possible by SegWit) in order to facilitate higher throughput, thereby placing an emphasis on scalability via layered approaches.\n\nThe \"layer\" landscape The Lightning Network is just one approach to enhancing the scalability of the Bitcoin network. Detailed in Table 1 is a comparison of the most prominent layer-based scaling strategies currently in development. The fundamental difference between the Lightning Network and the alternative strategies (highlighted in gray) is that these layers \u2013 whether they be sidechains, independent layer-1s or rollups \u2013 currently rely on trusted \u201cpegging\u201d mechanisms to deposit/withdraw bitcoin to/from the external execution environments. Further, they typically introduce a separate token that is representative of bitcoin, which could be considered more of an abstraction relative to a network like Lightning which leverages the actual native asset. These alternative approaches also differ from Lightning in that their intended utility is oriented towards more expressive smart contracts that go beyond the capabilities of Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language and facilitate specific applications such as liquidity pools, decentralized lending pools, NFT marketplaces, and automated market makers (AMMs). Conversely, Lightning represents more of a Bitcoin-native solution that utilizes the native asset and its corresponding scripting language (Script) to enable near-instantaneous and low-cost payments, which can be applied to a variety of useful applications. Table 1. Comparison of various approaches to scaling Bitcoin (project links: Lightning / Liquid / Rootstock / Stacks / Rollkit ) The eventual goal in terms of future development for these alternative approaches (outside of Lightning) is to create a decentralized (trustless) pegging mechanism or bridge. Stacks is one such approach that recently unveiled an updated whitepaper that aims to facilitate the permissionless use of bitcoin in an external execution environment. Separately, Bitcoin developer John Light recently published a research paper as part of the Human Rights Foundation\u2019s ZK-Rollup Research Fellowship that explores the potential of implementing zero-knowledge (ZK) proof technology on Bitcoin. As his research suggests, ZK rollups (or validity rollups as he calls them) could theoretically facilitate a trustless pegging mechanism or bridge, but would likely require new opcodes (operation codes, specific commands capable within Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language) such as proof verification and recursive covenants to be implemented via Bitcoin Implementation Proposals (BIPs). As BIPs necessitate a soft fork of the protocol, these solutions will need to achieve significant social consensus before they can be actualized. Lightning, on the other hand, requires no changes to the Bitcoin base layer in order to function in a trustless manner. Accordingly, developers can readily build applications and projects that leverage the Lightning Network and be confident they\u2019ll be able to easily deploy their ideas to the masses. Moreover, because building on Lightning does not require changes to the Bitcoin base layer, it is less likely to threaten the ongoing ossification of Bitcoin\u2019s existing protocol rules, which helps support bitcoin\u2019s reliability as a store of value asset.\n\nUnderneath the hood of Lightning The Lightning Network consists of nodes running software that allows peer-to-peer transactions via bidirectional multisignature Bitcoin addresses that act as payment channels. (A multisignature address is a specific type of Bitcoin address that requires multiple private keys in order to authorize a transaction; the typical structure is referred to as \u201cm-of-n\u201d where \u201cn\u201d is the total number of private keys associated with the address, and \u201cm\u201d is the minimum number of private keys required to sign a given transaction.) Functionally similar to bar tabs that must be reconciled at the end of the night, payment channels can be opened by creating a two-party (2-of-2) multisignature address and funding said address with a certain amount of bitcoin via a base layer transaction. Once a channel is open and funded with bitcoin (representing the upper limit of transactional capacity for the channel), the two parties can conduct an unlimited number of transactions for very low cost. Transactions within a channel are conducted \u201coff-chain.\u201d When users want to close the payment channel, only the net change in value between the two parties is finalized via a single base layer transaction. Importantly, the architecture of the Lightning Network protocol allows for the routing of payments across the network of interconnected nodes and corresponding payment channels. This means that users can send and receive payments to and from Lightning addresses without having to create a dedicated payment channel between two parties. Lightning achieves this routing process by implementing a specific type of Bitcoin transaction called a Hashed Timelock Contract (HTLC). A HTLC is a type of smart contract that combines two cryptographic concepts \u2013 hashlocks and timelocks \u2013 to ensure payments can be trustlessly routed across multiple \u201chops\u201d to and from intermediary channels. This structure suggests that the effectiveness of the network is directly a function of the number of users participating in the network, as they are additive to the overall liquidity of the network as well as the number of available routing destinations.\n\nImproving the infrastructure Despite its architectural advantages, Lightning is not without its own issues and limitations. Intricacies associated with managing payment channels and maintaining appropriate liquidity can be burdensome for individual users. As a result, the network is susceptible to denial-of-service and Sybil attacks (attempts to control a network by creating multiple fake identities), as well as other vulnerabilities related to potentially malicious counterparties. In order to protect themselves from dishonest actors, Lightning users can utilize \u201cjustice transactions\u201d which serve as a punitive mechanism involving the closure of a lightning channel that may be under attack. Moreover, users can outsource these protective measures to \u201cwatchtowers,\u201d third-party services that charge a fee to monitor specific Lightning channels. Bitcoin and Lightning developers are acutely aware of these challenges to usability and are working to improve the infrastructure of the network. One such open-source project called the Lightning Development Kit (initially supported by Chaincode Labs and Spiral). It aims to help developers more easily integrate Lightning functionality into user-friendly applications. A specialized library of APIs, the LDK meaningfully reduces the friction for developers to build and launch applications that can further expand the usability of the Lightning Network. Separately, an important factor in Lightning payments being reliable is the aggregate liquidity of channels across the network. A recently announced initiative from TBD (a Bitcoin-focused subsidiary of Block) called \u201cc=\u201d aims to create an enterprise-grade \u201cLightning Service Provider \u201d (LSP) to bolster channel liquidity accessible to the network. In other words, c= has committed to contributing bitcoin liquidity to the network in order to run a dedicated routing node that can be utilized by individuals and businesses alike. Initiatives like this that support the usability of Lightning will be critical to the maturation of the network and are helping catalyze the proliferation of Lightning-enabled applications.\n\nMeasuring adoption growth Lightning adoption and activity have been steadily increasing, with aggregate channel capacity hovering around all-time highs (currently ~5,480 BTC, or ~US$153M, as shown in Chart 1). While this growth trajectory is encouraging, the channel capacity of the network (a proxy for user activity) is still relatively small compared to the user activity on a network like Ethereum which has a current total-value-locked (TVL) of ~US$29B. Nevertheless, Lightning channel capacity compares favorably to the TVL of the aforementioned scaling alternatives such as Stacks and Rootstock, as shown in Chart 2. It is also worth noting that because Lightning channels are not required to be made public, the available data on channel capacity likely understates the entirety of network activity (an estimated ~30% of channels are private). Further, there are roughly ~18k active Lightning nodes at current, up over 116% since the start of 2021. Another important gauge of Lightning adoption is merchant and corporate integrations. Enterprises such as Shopify , Clover , and Robinhood have announced their intentions to support Lightning-based payments for their respective merchants and users. Chart 1. Lightning channel capacity (BTC and USD) Chart 2. Comparison of TVL (channel capacity for Lightning) Perhaps the most insightful signal of adoption, however, is the emergence of a diverse ecosystem of Lightning-enabled applications in recent years. Detailed in Table 2 are several innovative projects that are leveraging the Lightning Network in some capacity to broaden the utility of bitcoin. Notably, several of these initiatives represent potential solutions to real-world problems including reducing frictions for remittances/cross-border payments, empowering content creators to more effectively monetize their work, and fostering censorship-resistant social networks. Table 2. Key projects leveraging the Lightning Network (project links: Strike / Fedimint / Fedipool / Synota / Nostr / Fountain / Wavlake / Mash / Kollider / Taro ) (please also see our report Bitcoin Fedimints ) The efforts detailed above stand in contrast to the applications currently being built on alternative scaling platforms, many of which simply replicate certain products and services already available on dedicated smart contract platforms like Ethereum. For instance, the most popular application on Stacks is a DEX platform called ALEX which accounts for ~93% of the network\u2019s TVL. Similarly, a lending application called MoneyOnChain accounts for ~62% of Rootstock\u2019s TVL. Broadly speaking, sidechains and rollups are more oriented towards expressive smart contracts and programming languages to enable DeFi-like applications, while Lightning is more purely focused on fostering an effective payments layer for Bitcoin. That said, Lightning Network development is supporting more than just payments applications \u2013 Fedimint and Fedipool are important examples of leveraging the Lightning Network to build trust-minimized custody solutions and reduce centralization risks for mining pools, respectively.\n\nConclusions While far from perfect, the Lightning Network is integral to the future of Bitcoin in that it promises to broaden the utility of the protocol beyond a store of value without needing to infringe upon any existing protocol rules. Moreover, one could argue that some of the most impactful projects in terms of real-world utility are being built on the Lightning Network. Importantly, these projects are complementary to the Bitcoin network and can function with the existing native asset and corresponding scripting language. Alternative scaling solutions \u2013 those that introduce external chains, new tokens, or bridges \u2013 differ from the Lightning Network in terms of their architecture, intended utility, and ease of deployment. For these reasons, we believe the Lightning Network is well positioned to remain the focal point of future Bitcoin development. Nevertheless, we feel the various approaches being pursued to build incremental functionality and usability atop the Bitcoin base layer should not be dilutive to one another. While we believe that the Lightning Network possesses some critical advantages relative to its alternatives, we do not view the landscape for Bitcoin\u2019s scalability as winner-take-all. Each approach brings its own set of tradeoffs, and they all share the common goal of broadening the utility of bitcoin and represent sources of potential future demand for blockspace. Overall, we believe the design space for Bitcoin\u2019s layers is more vibrant than most realize and the network should benefit from the diversity of scaling approaches being developed."

        "content": "Most cryptocurrencies have gained momentum in the recent days with Bitcoin price hovering above the $28,000 level for the first time since June 2022. The largest digital coin has gained roughly 25% since March 8, when signs first emerged of trouble around Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which has since folded and ignited turmoil among other lenders.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has been experiencing a surge in value over the past few days due to instability in the banking sector, higher-than-expected inflation data, and renewed confidence in a dovish Federal Reserve, bringing it to its highest level in approximately nine months. The global crypto market was valued at US$1.18 trillion during this period. On Monday, major central banks made coordinated moves, including the Federal Reserve to improve market liquidity. This might have also contributed to the upward sentiment in the market,\" said Edul Patel, Co-founder and CEO at Mudrex.\n\nThe crypto market experienced a bounce last week. The pump, as per experts was caused by a combination of factors, including a massive short squeeze, a billion-dollar buy by Binance, and the Fed's response to the banking crisis, and news on Ethereum\u2019s update.\n\n\u201cAccording to Block statistics, nearly $300 million in leveraged BTC short positions were liquidated in the last week. This amounts to more than $300 million in buying pressure for BTC. During a bear market, this is quite substantial because it doesn't take nearly as much money to drive prices up or down. Binance's conversion of $1 billion in BUSD into BTC, ETH, BNB, and other unnamed cryptocurrencies is likely to have contributed to the recent rise. Another reason is the official announcement of the Ethereum Shanghai hard fork update date (April 12), which will allow users to withdraw their staked Eth and is expected to stimulate Ethereum market demand,\" said Rajagopal Menon Vice president WazirX.\n\n\"However, caution remains the need of the hour as the banking sector news can still impact market sentiments. Regulators may continue to make it difficult for banks to process crypto-related transactions, as has been the case with Signature bank. Another thing to look out for will be the Fed's meeting on Wednesday,\" said Parth Chaturvedi, Crypto Ecosystem Lead, CoinSwitch.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)\n\nMilestone Alert!

        "content": "Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap, has rallied up to 40 per cent ever since the collapse of multiple much-vaunted global financial institutions. The cryptocurrency breached the $28,000 mark for the first time after June 2022, fueled by investor\u2019s distrust in the banking system after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic Bank, Silvergate, and Credit Suisse Bank.\n\nCoinDCX Research Team enlisted the reasons for the current crypto rally and their future outlook for the cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cIn recent times, Bitcoin has experienced a significant surge in its value, rising by more than 28% over the last week and trading at $28,000. The BTC dominance has also reached an all-time high of 44.4 per cent after six to eight months. This sudden increase in price has been attributed to various factors, including the long-term trend of accumulation during dips below $20,000 and the liquidity crisis faced by the banking sector,\u201d they told Business Today.\n\nParth Chaturvedi, Crypto Ecosystem Lead, CoinSwitch explained that despite the rally, volatility in the digital currency cannot be ruled out.\n\n\u201cIt was heartwarming to see the crypto market rise against all odds last week. Despite the many sell-offs in global equities and 'risky assets,' Bitcoin (BTC) finally broke out of the $20,000- $25,000 range it was trading in for weeks,\u201d he told Business Today.\n\nHe added: \"However, caution remains the need of the hour as the banking sector news can still impact market sentiments.

Another thing to look out for will be the Fed's meeting on Wednesday.\"\n\nThe CoinDCX Research Team spoke about the outlook for other crypto tokens: \u201cIn the wake of this, more investors may currently consider Bitcoin as a safe haven asset. This could result in Bitcoin\u2019s value continuing to rise to levels beyond $30,000 in the near future. Additionally, crypto projects with good developments like ETH, MATIC, LIDO Finance, and UNISWAP are expected to see significant traction in the coming days.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Bitcoin was trading at $27,561 as per data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nAlso Watch: Binance\u2019s Executive Explains How To Secure Your Funds In Crypto - BT TV BusinessToday\n\nAlso Read: 'Are they sharks or loan sharks?'

        "title": "Ethereum as a deflationary asset, explained - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "What is a deflationary cryptocurrency? Although cryptocurrencies are often promoted as investment opportunities, their primary purpose was originally to serve as an alternative form of currency. Considering this narrative, the rules of supply and demand apply to cryptocurrencies as to fiat currencies. An undergraduate economics student might say the basics of money, economy and market forces is balancing supply and demand. How much of an asset is in circulation versus the demand \u2014 how many people want that particular asset \u2014 helps decide its price. This equation between supply and demand underlies the fundamentals of all economies and also applies to cryptocurrencies. Deflationary cryptocurrency is one where the value of the crypto increases due to a reduction or stagnation in supply. This ensures that the coin\u2019s market value is attractive for more people to invest in and can be used as a store of value. While deflationary cryptocurrencies look more attractive, not all are designed that way. Many well-known cryptocurrencies are not deflationary. In addition, there is often no supply limit to them. Some are disinflationary because inflation gradually reduces over time due to its tokenomics. Bitcoin (BTC), for instance, won\u2019t be deflationary until all 21 million coins have been mined. Ether (ETH) was not deflationary until the \u201cMerge\u201d happened in September 2022. Related: Inflationary vs. deflationary cryptocurrencies, Explained\n\nHow does Ethereum fare against other deflationary tokens? Developers of tokens create deflationary mechanisms during the design of the economic model behind the token. The economic model \u2014 tokenomics \u2014 can be fundamental to how stakeholders add and accrue value in a Web3 ecosystem. The supply and demand dynamics of a token are decided at the level of development. Deflationary characteristics like burn mechanisms are decided as the economic model underlying the token is being developed. This can be a point-in-time process like with Bitcoin or an evolving mechanism like with Ethereum. When creating Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto ensured there would only be a finite supply of 21 million. Once 21 million Bitcoin are mined, no new BTC can be created. This limited supply has helped the narrative that Bitcoin is a true store of value compared with fiat currencies that increase supply due to central bank monetary policies. In contrast, Ethereum had an inflationary supply at its inception. Ether supply was increasing at an annual rate of 4.5%. However, after the Ethereum Merge that saw it move from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, it is now a non-inflationary asset due to its burn rate. The number of Ether burned in maintaining the network activity is more than the amount of Ether entering circulation. Implementing the EIP-1559 protocol has altered the economic nature of the Ethereum token by incorporating the burning of a fraction of the gas fees per transaction. As a result, some experts argue that Ethereum has become more deflationary than Bitcoin. As deflationary tokens are considered a better store of value, new tokens created for both protocol and application tiers may be designed to be deflationary.\n\nHas Ethereum\u2019s transition to a deflationary token made it a more desirable asset? Investments in deflationary cryptocurrencies can yield growth and returns for investors. But being deflationary alone may not be a criterion to be identified as a better investment. Due to their supply cap, deflationary tokens are typically perceived as more valuable by holders and investors. This was also demonstrated by the rise of nonfungible tokens (NFTs), where the rarity of the NFTs often decided the prices. Limited supply driving prices higher was also true with the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), where some three-digit ENS names were sold for even more than 100 ETH. Ethereum may not necessarily be classified as a better asset after it became deflationary. Ethereum has a rich ecosystem that drives transactions on the chain, and as more Ether gets burned in the process, it causes deflation. An unused Ethereum blockchain wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve this economic feat. The underlying chain fundamentals must remain strong for Ethereum to thrive as an investment. A chain with strong fundamentals typically has a developer ecosystem to create many applications that users widely adopt. As users flock to these applications, developers are encouraged to continue innovating. The resulting network effect would make Ethereum deflationary, making it a more attractive investment asset."

        "content": "Bitcoin price is trading around $25,000, following a meltdown across the banking sector. The first ever cryptocurrency designed to allow individuals to be their own bank, has given banks a run for their money amidst a series of bank runs and collapses across the United States and the globe.\n\nTake a closer look at the crypto price charts you absolutely cannot miss.\n\nBitcoin Priced In Bank Shares Rockets To New All-Time High\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 during the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis by the still-unidentified Satoshi Nakamoto. Hidden within the Genesis block there is a message referencing the cover story on The Times about the second bailout for banks.\n\nThe message made Bitcoin\u2019s mission clear: remove the need for third-parties from the financial system and free humanity from the impact of greed and the elite. Essentially, the decentralized cryptocurrency-based protocol allows anyone to be their own bank, custody their own assets, and send and receive money without an intermediary like a bank.\n\nOver the last week, several banks nearly collapsed resulting in yet more bailouts some 14 years after the launch of the first ever cryptocurrency. The story rarely changes, with governments and central banks quick to swoop in and stop a crises from further developing.\n\nLike dominoes, several banks revealed major issues, ranging from Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate, Signature Bank, and Credit Suisse. While the factors behind each instance varies, the end result was the same: customers realized they cannot trust the banks with their deposits. Signature Bank\u2019s story is a little bit more complex, and was potentially shuddered due to involvement with crypto.\n\nSince the ordeal began, Bitcoin has been on a tear priced in USD and other global currencies. BTC priced against bank shares? Well, that\u2019s a crypto price chart you simply must lay your eyes on.\n\nBitcoin versus Banks | BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nHistory In The Making As BTC Becomes The Answer\n\nThe monthly candles in the above chart in the chart above are especially impressive. BTCUSD increased 80% against CS shares, 95% against SBNY, 200% against SIVB shares, and a staggering 650% against Silvergate.\n\nThe last time BTCUSD rallied this hard against big banks was back in May of 2019. Bitcoin price saw its bear market bottom about five months before the big move versus banks. This cycle, BTCUSD made its most recent low in November 2022. Five months from then would be April 2023, and already we\u2019re seeing massive movements against the banking sector once again. Could the outperformance against banks signal a potential bottom in the crypto market?\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only way that the first ever crypto asset is beating banks. Even at prices of $25,000 per coin, Bitcoin has a larger market cap and total value than even the largest banks in the world, like JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America.\n\nWill the dominoes continue to fall across the banking sector? And could this be the start of a new bullish narrative in Bitcoin? The next month will be pivotal in changing the trend across crypto.\n\nFollow @TonyTheBullBTC on Twitter or join the TonyTradesBTC Telegram for exclusive daily market insights and technical analysis education.

ChatGPT-4 explains the need for Bitcoin, interestingly, when ChatGPT-4 was asked by Michael Saylor, the creator, and CEO of the enterprise analytics software MicroStrategy, why the world required Bitcoin, the AI platform responded in-depth with a list of eight reasons\n\nDecentralization, or the fact that no single organization, like a government or financial institution, can control it, provides more freedom, autonomy, and resistance to censorship and manipulation, and is the main justification for the principal digital asset, according to ChatGPT.

Furthermore, \u201ctransactions can be easily verified and traced, minimizing the danger of fraud and corruption\u201d because \u201cBitcoin transactions are recorded on a public, tamper-resistant ledger called the blockchain.\u201d\n\nThe chatbot also correctly noted that because there are only 21 million Bitcoins available, it acts as a deflationary currency and lowers the risk of inflation, which over time tends to \u201cundermine the purchasing value of traditional currencies.\u201d The better level of anonymity when transferring assets compared to regular transactions provided by crypto transfers being simply associated with a public address rather than sensitive personal data was the sixth pro-Bitcoin reason cited by GPT-4.\n\nThe value of Bitcoin as an investment and a means of diversifying financial portfolios comes in seventh position, according to the GPT-4, which observed that the largest DeFi asset by market size had shown its potential for significant growth in value over time. By the use of smart contracts, which may automate and expedite a variety of financial procedures and transactions, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies \u201callow programmable money, leading to enhanced efficiency and innovative business models.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "The Benefits and Drawbacks of Using Bitcoin for Online Gambling in 2023 - Punch Newspapers",
        "content": "As cryptocurrencies become more widely adopted and accepted, it has opened up a whole new world of possibilities for online gambling.\n\nAlthough this cryptocurrency has many uses in the online gambling industry, it does come with a few challenges that all businesses must tackle. Despite its rapid growth, Bitcoin remains an early-stage technology, and the market remains highly unpredictable.\n\nNow that blockchain technology has enabled cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to exist as a secure and reliable form of payment; online casinos can offer their customers a safer and more immersive experience when playing popular crypto slot games or betting on sports.\n\nThe Advantages of Using Bitcoin for Online Gambling\n\nCrypto-enabled online casinos provide an immersive and secure experience that traditional casinos cannot replicate. Although not the best crypto-currency for all types of gaming, Bitcoin does come with a few notable advantages:\n\nTransaction Speed\n\nOne of the main benefits of using Bitcoin for online gambling is its fast transaction speed. Traditional payment solutions can take days to process. However, it only takes a matter of minutes to complete Bitcoin transactions.\n\nRather than having to wait to receive winnings or worry about complicated currency conversions, Bitcoin transactions can be received almost instantly. This allows players to gain access to their funds right away.\n\nAnonymous Entries\n\nBitcoin payment information doesn\u2019t require customers to hand over their personal details to gaming platforms. As a result, players can stay completely anonymous on the web while still enjoying all of the perks associated with online casinos.\n\nAt the same time, customers don\u2019t have to worry about identity theft, as they don\u2019t have to submit any personal data in the first place.\n\nNo Refunds\n\nThe best thing about Bitcoin transactions is that the funds are immutable, meaning customers can\u2019t charge the merchants back. Transactions cannot undergo any altering on the public ledger. This provides security to both the merchant and the client.\n\nWholly Private\n\nCustomers can easily find their personal balances stated on the public ledger. However, no one else will know who purchased what from the gaming platform.\n\nLow Fees\n\nBitcoin transactions don\u2019t require human merchants or physical institutions to act as middlemen.\n\nAs a result, the transaction fees are always kept low. However, clients still have to pay some fees if they want to speed up the transaction process, but this is optional and not absolute for all online casinos.\n\nNot Always Taxed\n\nCustomers should always check in with the tax regulations stated by their government before betting with cryptocurrencies. Not all countries impose tax regulations on Bitcoin winnings and profits, but some nations still do.\n\nDecentralized\n\nNo one can \u201cfreeze\u201d your account and take your winnings. Bitcoin transactions are completely decentralized and public, meaning only you own your profits. Third-party institutions can never interfere with your withdrawals. In addition, here\u2019s a few hacks for slot game players on how to increase their game profits.\n\nUnlike other traditional currencies, Bitcoin is not regulated or controlled by any one organization or government.\n\nThis provides a secure, private layer of transactions to gamble with, making it a desirable means of payment for many users who are wary of government oversight and regulations.\n\nThe Disadvantages of Using Bitcoin for Online Gambling\n\nBitcoin is still considered the go-to payment option when it comes to online gambling for many, but there are a few drawbacks to using this cryptocurrency.\n\nVolatile\n\nUnlike other stable coins, Bitcoin is highly volatile and is occasionally subjected to market fluctuations. Due to its value being so sensitive, it can be difficult to make predictions about whether a transaction will be profitable or not.\n\nFurthermore, if Bitcoin were to suddenly collapse, it would leave gamers with little to no recourse for recovering their funds.\n\nBitcoin and blockchain technology are constantly undergoing changes and have experienced quite a few highs and lows. This has led to the currency\u2019s collapse in the past, along with the extra fees some countries levy on crypto transactions.\n\nUntraceable\n\nOn the flip side, Bitcoin\u2019s untraceable nature can also be problematic. Players don\u2019t have the same security as traditional payment solutions. As a result, there is always a risk of fraud and malicious software targeting Bitcoin gambling networks.\n\nHowever, by offering multiple crypto and digital solutions, online casinos can increase their customer base and keep up with the latest trends. It is important for each casino to understand and exploit the latest features available when integrating various cryptocurrencies for a secure gambling environment.\n\nBitcoin Payments and Transactions in a Nutshell\n\nLarge corporations and online casinos around the world are increasingly turning to Bitcoin as the go-to payment option.\n\nHowever, while the advantages of Bitcoin are numerous \u2013 including its decentralized, secure, private, and fast nature \u2013 there is also an undeniable downside to using this digital currency for online gambling.\n\nBeing a decentralized currency, Bitcoin is not subjected to the same regulations or taxes as other traditional currencies, making it attractive to businesses and players alike.\n\nUnfortunately, this lack of regulation also means that the value of Bitcoin can be highly volatile and that it might collapse in the blink of an eye.\n\nSince the currency does not have any physical form, users have no way of returning any assets. This means that those using Bitcoin for gambling could easily lose money if the currency depreciates.\n\nThe technology behind Bitcoin is still undergoing many changes. With new developments happening every day, it could be challenging for businesses and users to keep up with all the new features in the blockchain. This could eventually lead to a number of errors.\n\nFinal Words\n\nIn summary, while Bitcoin does have its advantages for online gambling, its decentralized system and market volatility also pose a risk for those financially involved with it.\n\nWhile Bitcoin does provide a secure, immersive, and fast way to conduct transactions, players and online casinos must stay aware of the ever-changing cryptocurrency environment and its potential pitfalls.\n\nIt is important to consider both the potential risks and rewards before undergoing any type of cryptocurrency gambling.\n\nHowever, as blockchain technology continues to progress and improve, crypto-based payments will likely become more popular in the world of online gambling and also a go-to option for most players and businesses."

Dank der dwpbank k\u00f6nnen bald 1.200 deutsche Banken und Sparkassen BTC und Co. anbieten.\n\nKrypto in Deutschland: Diese Banken bieten bald Bitcoin an\n\nKrypto in Deutschland: Diese Banken bieten bald Bitcoin an\n\nMit rund 1.200 deutschen Banken ist die Deutsche WertpapierService Bank AG (dwpbank) das f\u00fchrende Institut f\u00fcr Wertpapierdienstleistungen. Banken und Sparkassen greifen auf die Infrastruktur des Dienstleisters zur\u00fcck, um ihren Kunden Wertpapiere-Services anbieten zu k\u00f6nnen. In einer Pressekonferenz, die das Unternehmen am heutigen 23. M\u00e4rz abhielt, gab die dwpbank einen wichtigen Durchbruch bekannt: Mit ihrer neuen Plattform wpNex erm\u00f6glicht sie allen angeschlossenen Banken die M\u00f6glichkeit, ihren Kunden Bitcoin und perspektivisch diverse andere digitale Assets anzubieten.\n\nBitcoin bei der MLP Banking AG\n\nDen Start des Krypto-Angebotes macht die MLP Banking AG. So hei\u00dft es von Dr. Paul Utzat, dem Bereichsleiter Konto und Wertpapierabwicklung:\n\n\u201cIn Zusammenarbeit mit der dwpbank m\u00f6chten wir unseren Kunden zuk\u00fcnftig den Handel von Kryptow\u00e4hrungen anbieten. In unserem MLP-Kundenportal ist es eine logische Erg\u00e4nzung zum vorhandenen Angebot im Verm\u00f6gensmanagement.\u201d\n\nAuf Nachfrage gab Utzat bekannt, dass dieser Service f\u00fcr alle Retailkunden in der zweiten Jahresh\u00e4lfte geplant ist.\n\nKryptow\u00e4hrungen in gewohnter Umgebung\n\nMit der wpNEX-Plattform der dwpbank kann der Krypto-Handel gewohnt in das Online-Banking des Kunden integriert werden. Bank- und Sparkassenkunden sehen so neben ihrem Wertpapierdepot ein Kryptokonto, auf dem ihre Kryptow\u00e4hrungen verwahrt sind. Genauso wie beim Wertpapierdepot kann auch das Girokonto bei der Hausbank zur Verrechnung genutzt werden, sodass kein Pre-Funding notwendig ist. Auch eine zus\u00e4tzliche Verifizierung m\u00fcssen die Bankkunden bei ihrer Kryptokonto-Er\u00f6ffnung entsprechend nicht mehr durchlaufen.\n\nF\u00fcr die maximale Sicherheit sorgt der BaFin-regulierte Custody-Service Tangany (Verwahrung der Private Keys) und um die Ausf\u00fchrung der B\u00f6rsenorders sowie die Preisstellung k\u00fcmmert sich Bankhaus Scheich / tradias. Zus\u00e4tzlich unterst\u00fctzt der Software-Dienstleister Valantic.\n\nBitcoin bald bei allen Volksbanken?\n\nDie gro\u00dfe Frage lautet nat\u00fcrlich, wann die anderen Banken der MLP Banking AG folgen werden. So wurde auf der Pressekonferenz in Aussicht gestellt, dass die DZ Bank zum Jahreswechsel ein Bitcoin-Angebot f\u00fcr ihre Kunden plant \u2013 ein Paukenschlag f\u00fcr die Bitcoin-Etablierung in Deutschland. Schlie\u00dflich ist die DZ Bank das Zentralinstitut f\u00fcr alle rund 800 Volksbanken in Deutschland.\n\nAuf die Frage, wie es bei den Sparkassen aussieht, gab man sich bedeckter. Hier scheint es innerhalb der Sparkassenfinanzgruppe noch immer keine klare Linie zu geben. In dem Jahr 2023 ist jedenfalls nicht mehr damit zu rechnen.\n\ndwpbank legt die Weichen\n\nMit ihrer wpNex-Plattform legt die dwpbank die entscheidenden Weichen f\u00fcr den Krypto-Standort Deutschland. Mit dem neu geschaffenen Angebot erh\u00f6ht man den Druck auf Banken und Sparkassen, die Kundennachfrage nach Bitcoin und Co. zu bedienen.\n\nBitcoin ist dabei nur der Anfang, wie der Vorstandvorsitzende der dwpbank, Dr. Heiko Beck, betont. Zuk\u00fcnftig sollen diverse digitale Assets, neben Kryptow\u00e4hrungen also auch digitale Wertpapiere und sonstige tokenisierte Assets, hinzukommen."

        "title": "Bitcoin halving one year away; When will BTC price spike? - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has been recovering in the past few weeks against the backdrop of the widespread crisis in the banking sector, and its recovery has been led by Bitcoin (BTC), which is looking forward to a halving in a little over a year and a potential price hike that could be connected to it.\n\nIndeed, Bitcoin is estimated to go through another halving in the first half of 2024, specifically sometime in late April or early May, when BTC is set to reach 840,000 blocks, at which time the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks, which currently amounts to 6.25 BTC for each block mined, will be cut in half.\n\nThis process was introduced to control the supply of the maiden decentralized finance (DeFi) asset, as there can only ever be 21 million BTC in circulation, making it deflationary, as opposed to inflationary currencies like fiat money that can be printed in the amount and period decided by governments.\n\nBitcoin halving cycle patterns\n\nAs it happens, the previous halving events, the last of which occurred in May 2020, take place roughly every four years and have typically been followed by an increase in the price of Bitcoin, leading many crypto traders and analysts to expect no less from the future Bitcoin halving.\n\nWith this in mind, the pseudonymous crypto analyst therationalroot has compared the past Bitcoin halving cycles and the price of the flagship cryptocurrency on a chart with a focus on its all-time highs (ATHs). Upon comparison, some interesting similarities arise, such as the timing of the top formation after a similar number of days.\n\nBitcoin halving cycles. Source: therationalroot\n\nMore recently, the analyst also shared a chart that demonstrates the progress of the current Bitcoin halving cycle and BTC price compared to the historical trends, indicating that Bitcoin is now 72% into the current halving cycle as of March 20.\n\nThe chart is also useful in observing the timeline of the previous BTC price spikes, suggesting the next one could occur about a year after the fourth halving cycle date, taking into account that Bitcoin had the habit of spiking roughly 10-12 months after each of the halving events.\n\nBitcoin halving cycle progress. Source: therationalroot\n\nBitcoin price change\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin was at press time changing hands at the price of $27,757, which demonstrates a slight decrease of 2.05% over the last 24 hours but still a 14.12% gain across the previous seven days and 12.4% on its monthly chart, as per the latest CoinMarketCap data retrieved by Finbold on March 21.\n\nBitcoin 7-day price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nTaking into account its chart patterns surrounding the past halving events, it is safe to assume that the fourth Bitcoin halving in May 2024 will involve a significant price increase for the crypto industry representative and its largest asset by market capitalization.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nAs another one of its successes compared to traditional finance, the largest digital asset by market capitalization has added over $200 billion to its market cap in 2023, at the same time as the accumulated $100 billion was drained from five of the largest U.S. banks as the banking sector continued to suffer casualties.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

Purchasing $10 worth of Bitcoin every week would be a typical example of DCAing.
