        "title": "Bitcoin has shot up 50% since the new year, but here's why new lows are probably still ahead - The Conversation",
        "content": "To the delight of investors across the cryptosphere, the price of bitcoin (BTC) has rallied over 53% since its low of US$15,476 (\u00a312,519) in November. Now trading around US$23,000, there\u2019s much talk that the bottom has finally been reached for the leading cryptocurrency after a year of painful decline \u2013 in November 2021, the price peaked at almost US$70,000.\n\nIf so, it\u2019s not only good news for bitcoin but the whole market in cryptocurrencies, since the others broadly move in line with the leader. So is crypto back in business?\n\nDotcom lessons\n\nThe past is littered with various periods of market turmoil, from the global financial crisis of 2007-09 to the COVID-19 collapse in 2020. But neither of these is a particularly good comparison for our purposes because they both saw sharp drops and recoveries, as opposed to the slow unwinding of bitcoin. A better comparison would be the dotcom bubble burst in 2000-02, which you can see in the chart below (the Nasdaq is the index that tracks all tech stocks).\n\nNasdaq 100 index 1995-2005\n\nLook at the bitcoin chart since it peaked in November 2021 and the price action looks fairly similar:\n\nBitcoin bear market price chart 2021-23\n\nBoth charts show that bear markets go through various periods where prices rise but don\u2019t reach the same level as the previous peak \u2013 known as \u201clower highs\u201d. If bitcoin is following a similar trajectory to the early 2000s Nasdaq, it would make sense that the current price will be another lower high and that it will be followed by another lower low.\n\nThis is partly because like the 2000s Nasdaq, bitcoin seems to be following a pattern known as an Elliott Wave. Named after the renowned American stock market analyst Ralph Nelson Elliott, this essentially argues that during a bear phase, investors shift between different emotional states of disappointment and hope, before they finally despair and decide the market will never turn in their favour. This is a final wave of heavy selling known as capitulation.\n\nYou can see this idea on the chart below, where bitcoin is the green and red line and Z is the potential capitulation point at around US$13,000 (click on the chart to make it bigger). The black line is the path that the Nasdaq took in the early 2000s. The blue pointing finger above that line is potentially the equivalent place to where the bitcoin price is now.\n\nBitcoin now vs Nasdaq in the early 2000s\n\nAuthor provided\n\nThe one other thing to note on the chart is the wavy line that\u2019s moving horizontally along the bottom. This is the stochRSI or stochastic relative strength index, which is an indication of when the asset looks overbought (when the line is peaking) or oversold (when it\u2019s bottoming).\n\nA sign of a coming shift is when the stochRSI moves in the opposite direction to where the price is heading: so now the stochRSI is coming down but the price has held up around US$23,000. This too suggests a fall could be imminent.\n\nThe game of wealth transfer\n\nWithin markets, there is often a game that investors from institutions such as banks and hedge funds play with amateur (retail) investors. The aim is to transfer retail investors\u2019 wealth to these institutions.\n\nThis is particularly easy in an unregulated market like bitcoin, because it is easier for institutions to manipulate prices. They can also talk up (or talk down) prices to stir up retail investors\u2019 emotions, and get them to buy at the top and sell at the bottom. This \u201ctraps\u201d the irrational investors who buy at higher prices, transferring wealth by giving the institutions an opportunity to convert their holdings into cash.\n\nIt therefore makes sense to compare how the retail and institutional investors have been behaving lately. The following charts compare those crypto wallet addresses that hold 1 BTC or more (mostly retail investors) with those holding upwards of 1,000 BTC (institutional investors). In all three charts, the black line is the bitcoin price and the orange line is the number of wallets in that category.\n\nRetail investor behaviour\n\nInstitutional investor behaviour pt 1\n\nInstitutional investor behaviour pt 2\n\nThis shows that since the FTX scandal back in November, which led to the world\u2019s second-largest crypto exchange collapse, retail investors have been buying bitcoin aggressively, resulting in the highest number of addresses holding at least one BTC ever. On the other hand, the biggest institutional investors have been offloading. This suggests that the institutional investors agree with our analysis.\n\nWhere we\u2019re heading\n\nThere are those who argue that bitcoin is a bubble and that ultimately cryptocurrencies are worthless. That\u2019s a separate debate for another day. If we assume there is a future for blockchains, which are the online ledgers that enable cryptocurrencies, the key question is when bitcoin will reach the accumulation phase that typically ends a bear phase in any market.\n\nKnown as Wyckoff accumulation, this is where the price of the asset repeatedly tests two areas: the upper bound where traders previously sold heavily enough for the price to stop rising (known as resistance), and the lower bound where traders bought heavily enough that the price stopped going down (known as support).\n\nAt the point where institutional investors decide the lower bound has proved to be sufficiently resilient \u2013 in other words, they think the price is cheap at that level \u2013 they will start buying the asset again. That moment is only likely to come after there has been a capitulation.\n\nOf course, history does not repeat itself exactly. It may be this is the first time that retail investors have outsmarted the large institutions, and that the only way is now up.\n\nMore likely, however, there is more pain on the way. With a recession on the cards, unprecedented job layoffs and weak retail data coming out of the US, it doesn\u2019t point to the kind of optimism that tends to move markets higher. It would therefore make sense to brace yourself for another plunge in the price of bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market."

        "title": "More advisors are jumping on the bitcoin bandwagon - InvestmentNews",
        "content": "The crypto winter, the term often used to describe the dramatic collapse in cryptocurrency prices over the past year, is apparently having little impact on financial advisors determined to ride the waves in the fast-evolving digital currency space.\n\nEven with bicoin, the best-known cryptocurrency, down nearly 65% from its peak of just over $65,000 in November 2021, the true believers are determined to focus on the long term.\n\nA report out Friday from Bitwise and VettaFi shows 60% of financial advisors are long-term bullish on crypto.\n\nPerhaps what makes the findings so surprising is that the research was conducted prior to the recent rally that\u2019s seen the price of bitcoin jump nearly 40% over the past four weeks.\n\n\u201cI was surprised by the findings; I thought the downturn would have scared off advisors,\u201d said Todd Rosenbluth, director of research at VettaFi.\n\n\u201cAdvisors seem to be relatively loyal to the long-term view and potential benefits of crypto,\u201d he added. \u201cUsually when something sells off, people want to tell you they\u2019re concerned. I think that bodes well for future crypto investing.\u201d\n\nIf advisors are starting to show a new interest in crypto it could be, at least in part, to try and keep up with their clients. The survey showed that 14% of advisors say all of their clients are investing in crypto, which compares to 8% last year and 6% two years ago.\n\nForty-five percent of advisors said some of their clients are investing in crypto, which compares to 62% last year and 34% two years ago.\n\nWhen asked if they\u2019re investing in crypto in their personal accounts, 37% of advisors said yes, which compares to 47% last year and 24% two years ago.\n\nWhen it comes to accessing crypto, exchange-traded funds have become the most popular avenue, even though U.S. regulators have not yet permitted funds that invest directly in the digital currency.\n\nWhen asked how they gain exposure for clients, 25% said they use ETFs that invest in crypto companies. The second most popular way of gaining exposure, at 17%, is directly investing in various cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cI think ETFs are what advisors are most interested in because that\u2019s what\u2019s available,\u201d said Rosenbluth.\n\nAs an example of the appeal of crypto, Rosenbluth referenced the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO). At $786 million, BITO is the largest cryptocurrency ETF, and it had $161 million in net inflows last year despite recording a 64% decline. So far this year, the fund is up 41%, essentially tracking the price fluctuations of bitcoin.\n\nExtreme price volatility has become a trademark of cryptocurrencies, and some advisors have kept away for that reason. But after four peak-to-trough cycles over the past 12 years, even some naysayers are taking notice.\n\n\u201cFor the first time that I can recall, I came into 2023 being bullish on bitcoin,\u201d said Paul Schatz, president of Heritage Capital.\n\nSchatz said his clients have shown little interest and he thinks the existing ETFs are \u201cflawed and need more regulation,\u201d but he likes the price patterns he sees.\n\n\u201cI saw the downside as $14,000 to $15,000 and the upside to almost $30,000,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty good risk-reward.\u201d\n\nAt around $23,000, bitcoin is still well off its peak but the pattern moving toward the next reduction of the crypto payment awarded to miners of the digital currency in 2024 suggests another upcycle looming.\n\nRic Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, said the price of bitcoin has eventually doubled every time the payment to miners has been cut in half, which is why he expects bitcoin\u2019s price to reach $150,000 by the summer of 2025.\n\nOver its short history, since 2010, the price of bitcoin has suffered three negative years. But there have been big declines, including a 58% decline in 2014, a 73% decline in 2018, and a 65% decline in 2022.\n\nThe 11 positive years, meanwhile have ranged from 35% in 2015 to 9,900% in 2010.\n\nWith that in mind, it\u2019s not a surprise that price volatility was listed among the top reasons advisors are avoiding crypto currencies.\n\nAsked about their reasons for not investing in crypto, 65% of advisors listed regulatory issues as a top concern, followed by price volatility at 51%."

        "content": "Wendy Rogers, an Arizona state senator in the United States, has launched bills concerning cryptocurrency, including one that aims to make Bitcoin (BTC) legal tender in Arizona.\n\nIn a recent tweet, Rogers cited data from investment firm Goldman Sachs that BTC is the best-performing asset in the world and announced that she launched a set of crypto bills.\n\n\u201cBreaking: #Bitcoin is the best performing asset in the world this year according to data from Goldman Sachs.\u201d\n\n\n\nLaunched my #Crypto bills today, as well as Photo Radar Prohibition, which included nearly all my Republican senator colleagues as cosponsors @JeffWeninger @JDMesnard pic.twitter.com/ueUeFSEybo \u2014 Wendy Rogers (@WendyRogersAZ) January 25, 2023\n\nOne of the proposed bills focuses on making BTC legal tender in the U.S. state. If passed into law, BTC will have the same status as the U.S. dollar, becoming an accepted medium of exchange for debt payment, public charges, taxes and dues in the state.\n\nIn 2022, the state senator also introduced a similar bill without success. Despite this, Rogers still continues efforts to push BTC forward in the state. In April 2022, Rogers spoke against central banks and voiced her support for Bitcoin. She tweeted:\n\nCentralized digital money controlled by the central bankers is slavery. Decentralized #Bitcoin is freedom. \u2014 Wendy Rogers (@WendyRogersAZ) April 2, 2022\n\nApart from this, Rogers also participated in introducing a bill that seeks to make crypto a tax-exempt property. If approved, voters can decide in 2024 if they want tokens that do not represent foreign currencies or the U.S. dollar to be exempt from taxes.\n\nRelated: US Senator Ted Cruz pushes for crypto in Congress ... using snacks\n\nOn Sept. 7, 2021, El Salvador officially made Bitcoin a legal tender in the country. More than a year later, making Bitcoin legal tender in the country proved beneficial. El Salvador experienced increased tourism in 2022, with 1.1 million people visiting the country in the first half of the year.\n\nOn Jan. 22, Brazil and Argentina announced preparations to create a common currency parallel to the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso. Responding to this, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong suggested that moving to Bitcoin may be the right \u201clong-term bet\u201d for both countries."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s precipitous plunge in price helped it become the world\u2019s the most hated virtual currency in 2022, according to a survey by crypto education website Coin Kickoff.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market value was the most disliked coin in 16 countries, led by Canada, Qatar and Finland.\n\nEthereum and solana were the world\u2019s most loved, led by Indonesia, Russia and Uzbekistan.\n\nCoin Kickoff came up with its love/hate ranking by analyzing more than 835,000 Twitter posts with the artificial intelligence algorithm HuggingFace.\n\nBitcoin lost 70% of its value in 2022, causing investors to vent their frustration on social media. Ethereum, crypto\u2019s second-largest currency, fell almost as much, dropping by 67.5%, but was spared the backlash.\n\nCoin Kickoff noted, in contrast to bitcoin, many of ethereum\u2019s projects are based around decentralized finance (DeFi) \u2014 which aims to broaden the usage of cryptocurrencies for more complex transactions such as loans.\n\nSolana was also loved, despite losing 94% of its value. Its network suffered over five outages, numerous hacks and fallout from FTX\u2019s bankruptcy with FTX and sister company Alameda Trading holding 10.7% of its tokens, according to Coin Telegraph.\n\nBRUTAL YEAR FOR BITCOIN AND ALMOST $3B IN CRYPTO HACKS MARKED 2022: REPORT\n\nRecent rally\n\nSentiment for bitcoin may improve with its recent price recovery.\n\nIan Wright, the crypto expert behind Coin Kickoff, told FOX Business: \"While it is still 67% down on its all-time high, investors are confident that the current economic climate in the U.S. and bitcoin\u2019s standing as the pre-eminent crypto coin will yield further gains as the year progresses.\"\n\nFxPro senior market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich was more cautious. \"Despite the positive performance of the U.S. stock indices, bitcoin continued its unsuccessful attempts to consolidate above $23,000 on Wednesday. The crypto market has, at least, paused after rallying since the beginning of the year,\" he said.\n\nWright added that investors will look to see whether etherum can hit $5,000 in 2023.\n\n\"Like bitcoin, its value is rallying as a result of economic conditions. It is still highly regarded within the U.S. crypto community because of its long-term potential and the blockchain base for many of the industry\u2019s most exciting prospects,\" he told FOX Business.\n\nSolana is benefiting from bonk, a new coin launched on its blockchain in December. Bonk rocketed 5,000% by early January, but has since fallen back, though it was up 910% year-to-date as of last week.\n\nSurprisingly, bitcoin was not America\u2019s most hated virtual currency.\n\nHOUSE REPUBLICANS LAUNCHING DIGITAL ASSET SUBCOMMITTEE AFTER TROUBLED YEAR FOR CRYPTOCURRENCY INDUSTRY\n\nAmerica\u2019s Top 5 hated by percentage of negative tweets:\n\n1. Axie Infinity (32.34%) lost 90% of its value in 2022. Hackers stole $625 million from its Ronin Network and the player base for its games dwindled due to competition for virtual 3D worlds.\n\n2. 1inch Network (31.59%) saw its value peak in 2021 at almost $7.50 against the dollar. Its performance was much more sluggish in 2022 as a result of the wider turmoil in the crypto market.\n\n3. Terra (27.35%) was one of crypto\u2019s high-profile casualties of 2022. Despite a promising introduction where startup Terraform Labs secured $200 million in funding, the blockchain collapsed in May 2022 \u2014 wiping out $45 billion of market capitalization in a week. Its founders Do Kwon and Daniel Shin have been sued in Singapore, Korea and the U.S. for alleged financial irregularities, and authorities in Seoul issued an arrest warrant for Shin in November 2022.\n\n4. Uniswap (22.00%) peaked at $42 against the dollar and has yet to see its value move past the $10 mark.\n\n5. Holochain (21.24%) is billed as a more ethical alternative to the centralized crypto offerings. Holo allows customers to make their own choices and create more transparency around its blockchain technology. However, the coin is still valued at just $0.02 against the dollar.\n\nCRYPTO.COM CUTS 20% OF STAFF, CITING ECONOMIC HURDLES AND FTX COLLAPSE\n\nAmerica\u2019s Top 5 most loved by percentage of positive tweets\n\n1. Stellar (68.72%) partnered with Ukraine\u2019s government in 2021 to develop its digital infrastructure. The coin\u2019s value increased further when Franklin Templeton became the first investment firm to launch a \u2018tokenized\u2019 mutual fund in the U.S. using Stellar\u2019s blockchain.\n\n2. EOS (64.29%) gained popularity for its versatility, open-source capability and intuitive user-friendly platform that helps developers and investors. That transparency and accessibility makes it a favorite for investors.\n\n3. Decentraland (53.89%) has the largest metaverse currently online. Many predict that its coin will reach parity with the dollar in 2023. Mainstream interest in the platform from brands including Adidas, Dolce & Gabbana, Samsung, Sothebys, and Tommy Hilfiger make it feel more relatable as a concept for the wider public.\n\n4. NEAR Protocol (53.03%) reached record highs at the start of 2023. Many investors believe it has some of the most reliable technology on the market, with an active developer community and emphasis on security.\n\n5. Ravencoin (51.76%) as a peer-to-peer platform offers more coin versatility than its rivals.\n\nReuters contributed to this report."

        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rose 9.89% from Jan. 20 to Jan. 27, to US$23,003 at 4:30 p.m. on Friday afternoon in Hong Kong. Ether gained 2.26% in the same timeframe, to change hands at US$1,582.\n\n\u201cThe rally is driven by a broader sentiment in the financial markets. The belief is that inflation has peaked and the economic slowdown will force the Fed to soften its stance on interest rates. This might result in 1 or 2 quarters without any rate hike and help the general available liquidity in the market,\u201d Dinesh Goel, founder of play-to-earn ecosystem One World Nation told Forkast in a LinkedIn message.\n\n\u201cThis, however, is coupled with a looming fear of an impending recession. The mixed signals are prompting investors to divert a part of their wealth to gold or Bitcoin,\u201d said Goel, adding that Bitcoin\u2019s rally is also driven by investors who see it as a store of wealth.\n\nBonnie Cheung, head of strategy at Web3 communications protocol Sending Labs, attributes the crypto price rally this year to both macroeconomic factors and the removal of what she called crypto tourists.\n\n\u201cAside from the macros, where inflation fearmongers seem to have taken a backseat, don\u2019t forget that while the \u201ccrypto tourists\u201d have disappeared largely as a result of all the fallouts from centralized crypto finance players, the builders never stopped building,\u201c Cheung said in an email.\n\nKasper Vandeloock, the chief executive officer of quantitative trading firm Musca Capital, says the Bitcoin rally is due to short positions being liquidated and the industry recovering from FTX\u2019s collapse.\n\n\u201cAs you can see in the screenshot linked below, there have been quite some large liquidations and open interest wipes. Besides that, tech [equities] has been having some slight recoveries which has a strong correlation to crypto,\u201d wrote Vandeloock.\n\nPolygon\u2019s MATIC was the week\u2019s biggest gainer among the 10 largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, up 14.4% on the weekly chart, trading at US$1.08.\n\nThe global crypto market cap stood at US$1.05 trillion on Friday at 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, up 7.58% from US$976 billion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin\u2019s US$443 billion represented 42.37% of the market, while Ether took up 17.9%.\n\nSmart contract blockchains gain\n\nThe Threshold (T) token was this week\u2019s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market cap listed on CoinMarketCap, having rallied 129% to trade at US$0.050 after Coinbase added the token to its listings roadmap.\n\nAptos\u2019 APT token was this week\u2019s second biggest gainer, having rallied 118% to trade at US$17.69. Fantom\u2019s FTM had the third-best performance, up 53.5% to change hands at US$0.46.\n\n\u201cAptos has been doing a great job of speed-building a vibrant community and playing catch-up to early comers such as Solana, perhaps even replacing it as the new Ethereum killer,\u201d wrote Cheung.\n\n\u201cHowever, if you have successfully rode through the last two crypto market cycles, you know the two things you will look at first are the market capital vs fully diluted valuation (currently at 15.86%, meaning ~85% of APT tokens are still locked up), and the most active exchanges where the token is traded, which for APT is surprisingly not Binance but Upbit, one of Korea\u2019s largest exchanges. These two factors will help you gauge if the pump has a second act.\u201d\n\nVandeloock said it\u2019s unclear what triggered Aptos\u2019 rally, \u201cbut it later got a lot of traction from traders looking for volatility. Tens of millions of shorts also got liquidated in this leg up,\u201d said Vandeloock, referring to the screenshot below that he shared with Forkast.\n\nSee related article: Cold comfort: Is Crypto Winter the right time to invest in Web3?\n\nWhat\u2019s in store next week?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s relative strength index (RSI), a popular technical indicator for market analysts, reached 80 on the weekly chart, signaling that Bitcoin is \u201coverbought.\u201d One World Nation\u2019s Goel said that investors should be mindful of this metric and that \u201cwe should expect price correction within the next 2 weeks.\u201d\n\nVandeloock wasn\u2019t quite on board with that view, saying that RSI is based on historical volatility and \u201cat a moment of low volatility it adds little value to the overall events.\u201d He said he does expect a downward move in the short term, but remains bullish in the mid to long term.\n\nGoel said that investors should be mindful of the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s (FOMC) meeting at the end of January.\n\nSee related article: World Economic Forum\u2019s digital asset head expects real-world blockchain adoption in 2023\n\n\u201cThe trajectory of interest rates will govern the movement in the crypto market to a large extent. How the US government handles the FTX scam and the impending allegations against Binance will also play a crucial role in the overall market sentiment,\u201c Goel wrote.\n\nSending Labs\u2019 Cheung said that the crypto market is entering the accumulation stage of the four-year Bitcoin halving cycle.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hitting that up-ramp part of the four-year halving cycle. In the past, around 18 months ahead of the halving is when price starts to build out the bottom. This time, the 18-month period started in September 2022, when it was trading around 19K-20K,\u201d Cheung said.\n\n(Updates to change Bitcoin price comparison period in deck.)"

        "content": "The LOOP Design Awards reportedly recognized the Bitcoin City of El Salvador\u2019s government as one of the most outstanding projects in interior design and architecture.\n\nWhen completed, the metropolis will use the energy released from the Conchagua volcano to power itself and BTC as its currency.\n\nBukele\u2019s Dream City Gets an Award\n\nAccording to recent coverage, El Salvador\u2019s urban project stood out among 700 proposals. The jury outlined its innovative interior style, while the beautiful surrounding nature and the nearby volcanoes also attributed to the success. They also highlighted the work of the Mexican architect Fernando Romero who designed it.\n\nThe Bitcoin City will be built in the southeast of the Latin American country, close to two of the nation\u2019s biggest volcanoes \u2013 Conchagua and Tecapa. Romero\u2019s team said the future metropolis will be \u201cefficient and sustainable\u201d and will use geothermal energy from the volcanoes to power itself.\n\nIt will use bitcoin as its currency which could provide certain monetary benefits to the residents. \u201cThe new public space will be the culmination of decades of research into what humans need to live well in an anti-inflationary economy,\u201d the architect outlined.\n\nRomero designed the urban area in the shape of a circle so it could represent the logo of bitcoin when looked at from above.\n\nThe President of El Salvador \u2013 Nayib Bukele \u2013 was the first to present the project in 2021. The local government planned to raise a $1 billion bitcoin-backed bond to finance the construction, which was supposed to mature in 2032. However, the authorities postponed it in March 2022, citing unfavorable market conditions.\n\nBukele shed more light on the design in May last year, showing how the city will look when observed from the air, its modern airport, and its volcano watchtower.\n\nSo Many More Bitcoin Initiatives\n\nApart from becoming the first nation to embrace the primary cryptocurrency as a legal tender, El Salvador\u2019s government has also introduced several projects related to it in the past few years.\n\nIt built a massive vet hospital named Chivo Pets, where treatments are paid in BTC, and opened an education center that provides \u201cfree and accessible learning opportunities\u201d surrounding the asset for Salvadorans.\n\nThe authorities have also started accumulating bitcoin on a macroeconomic level, holding approximately $54 million of it (as of now). The amount, though, could be higher since Bukele announced in November that the government will purchase one BTC per day. It remains unknown whether the buying spree goes as promised."

He noted:\n\n\u201cIf history is any guide, then we should see the outperformance of layer 1 and altcoins relative to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWhile the report highlighted that news regarding other projects positively impacted token prices such as Lido DAO (LDO) and Aptos (APT), the crypto rally only started once the U.S. inflation data was released on Jan. 12.\n\nIt was also mentioned that Ether (ETH) appears to be performing well during U.S. hours, indicating \u201cinstitutional flows\u201d into the cryptocurrency, however, APT is doing well around the clock.\n\n\u201cAptos is seeing a mix of strong returns during U.S. trading hours AND during Asia trading hours.\u201d\n\nThe report concluded that this \u201cshould be a very positive sign for Bitcoin\u201d as institutional adoption continues.\n\nRelated: Data shows pro Bitcoin traders want to feel bullish, but the rally to $23K wasn\u2019t enough\n\nIn earlier comments to Cointelegraph, economist Lyn Alden believes that Bitcoin is currently playing \u201ca bit of catch-up,\u201d getting back to where it would have been without the FTX collapse occurring.\n\nAlden warned that there is \u201cconsiderable danger ahead\u201d for the second half of 2023, citing liquidity conditions being \u201cgood right now\u201d partly because of the U.S. as a significant factor.\n\nAlden explained that as the U.S. Treasury is drawing down its cash balance to keep the country\u2019s debt levels low, it pushes \u201cliquidity into the financial system.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, popular trader and market commentator TechDev posted a Twitter update on Jan. 26 showing the price correlation between Bitcoin and gold, stating that if Bitcoin continues to follow the price of gold, it might even \u201ccrack the $50,000 mark.\u201d"

        "title": "How Bitcoin mining saved Africa's oldest national park from bankruptcy - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has become the first national park in the world to run a Bitcoin (BTC) mine in an effort to protect its forests and wildlife. Cointelegraph spoke with S\u00e9bastien Gouspillou, CEO of Big Block Green Services, and the man who introduced Bitcoin mining to the park.\n\nSpeaking via video call, Gouspillou said with a smile: \u201cBitcoin mining saved the park from bankruptcy.\u201d\n\nVirunga is Africa's oldest protected park and a symbol of the continent's biodiversity. A report by journalist Adam Popescu, published in MIT Technology Review, explained that the region was plagued by issues prior to Bitcoin mining. From local militias that waged violent attacks on its animals and employees to outbreaks of Ebola to kidnappings, the emblematic national park has struggled for revenue in recent years.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its subsequent eradication of tourism was almost the nail in the coffin for the park, as visits to see the gorillas, other wildlife and waterfalls dried up. The article explained that tourism represented roughly 40% of the park\u2019s revenue.\n\nFrom left to right, JF Augusti Co-founder of Big Block Green Services, Seb Gouspillou and Emmanuel de Merode. Source: Gouspillou\n\nWhen Gouspillou learned of the park\u2019s strife, he felt compelled to help. He met with Emmanuel De Merode, the park\u2019s director \u2014 and a Belgian prince by bloodline \u2014 at a chateau in France at the tail end of 2019. Gouspillou explained that he immediately recognized the tremendous opportunity the park presented.\n\nThe park could monetize its abundant and untapped natural resources to preserve its existence. Gouspillou explained to De Merode how Virunga could turn to Bitcoin mining to generate income.\n\nThe conversation in the chateau was non-stop. \u201cIt must\u2019ve lasted hours,\u201d Gouspillou explained. The discussion, as well as follow-ups and a visit to Congo, eventually culminated in De Merode setting up the first portions of the mining operation in early 2020, which successfully mined the first coins in September of that year.\n\nBitcoin mines in Virunga set against the park backdrop. Source: Twitter\n\nAlmost three years later, the park earned significant income from Bitcoin. During some months of the 2021 bull run, the park was rewarded upwards of $150,000 a month \u2014 almost entirely offsetting lost tourist income.\n\nVirunga's Bitcoin mine is a unique solution to the problem of preserving the park's biodiversity while also generating revenue. Bitcoin mining is a highly energy-intensive process, but Virunga's mine is unique in that it runs on clean energy: It\u2019s green technology surrounded by green rainforest.\n\nThe mine is powered by one of three hydro plants within the park, a sustainable source of electricity that was already being used to power nearby towns. The site has hired nine full-time workers, who work in rotating shifts operating the miners in the jungle, to staff the facility. Fearless rangers protect the site \u2014 a story that inspired a Netflix documentary, among other things.\n\nThe facility has 10 shipping containers, with each container holding 250 to 500 rigs. Virunga owns three of these containers, Gouspillou the remaining seven. Gouspillou purchases energy from Virunga as part of the arrangement, while keeping the mined Bitcoin.\n\nPlus, as Gouspillou explains, the existing Bitcoin mining facility is part of a \u201cglobal plan,\u201d in which there will be further power-generating opportunities. Other power stations will be set up across the park, he explained, to connect local villages to electricity and, of course, mine more Bitcoin.\n\nDe Merode is steadfast that the project will be successful despite the ongoing bear market. Indeed, some Bitcoin miners fell victim to the 2022 bear market, but De Merode occupies a unique position: The park is not speculating on the value of Bitcoin, but generating Bitcoin using surplus energy to monetize something that otherwise has no value.\n\nVirunga National Park is known for its gorillas. Source: Virunga.org\n\nPlus, there is little risk of the Bitcoin (or private keys) disappearing if De Merode is killed in action. Over 200 of the park\u2019s security, or rangers have been killed since 1996 \u2014 and De Merode was shot twice while traveling to Goma in 2014, so it\u2019s a tragic but possible outcome that must be prepared for.\n\nThe park\u2019s finance team manages custody of the Bitcoin wallet, and funds generated by the mine are sold regularly to pay for the park\u2019s upkeep. In the MIT Technology Review article, De Merode is quoted as saying:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unlikely we sit on Bitcoin for more than a few weeks anyway, because we need the money to run the park. So if something happened to me or our CFO lost the password, we\u2019d give him a hard time\u2014but it wouldn\u2019t cost us much.\u201d\n\nSimilar to El Salvador\u2019s treatment in the mainstream media, the \u201cbet\u201d that De Merode made has invited skepticism from experts who wonder what crypto has to do with conservation. Gouspillou explained that it took some time for De Merode to refer to the project as a Bitcoin mining project, preferring to use the term \u201cblockchain mining,\u201d as it\u2019s more PR-friendly.\n\nThe hydroplant and Bitcoin mine are located among the dense rainforest. Source: Gouspillou\n\nFor Gouspillou, he hasn\u2019t been able to find a downside to the story of how a Bitcoin mine has saved a national park:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to find a negative side to this story. There\u2019s nothing. The energy is clean, even the ASICS \u2014 we will transport them to recycling centers at the end of their lifespan.\u201d\n\nASICS, or application-specific integrated circuits, are Bitcoin mining machines. Every 10 minutes, ASICS take part in a digital lottery to guess the next Bitcoin block on the Bitcoin time chain. As Gouspillou explains, these machines will be broken down and recycled, avoiding e-waste. The miners use excess, clean energy, and De Merode uses that funding to protect wildlife.\n\nBuoyed by the success in the Congo, Gouspillou has his eyes on other Bitcoin mining projects in Sub-Saharan Africa. He was part of the delegation that visited the Central African Republic \u2014 the second country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender.\n\nBitcoin mining projects in Africa using untapped and renewable energy appear to be a growing trend. From the mountains of Kenya to the tropical climes of Malawi, Bitcoin mining is cropping up in incongruous areas of the globe.\n\nMagdalena Gronowska, regular Cointelegraph contributor and and Bitcoin mining specialist, explained why:\n\n\u201cMiners are buyers of first resort (always want to run) and last resort for overproducing energy locations to become economically viable. As consumer demand grows in a community, Bitcoin mining can be decreased or removed entirely, but it enabled critical infrastructure to be built out.\u201d\n\nIn essence, if a region offers stranded or abundant, overproduced energy, a Bitcoin mine could be financially appealing.\n\nNonetheless, the park still needs funds and investment. The Congolese government provides just 1% of its operating budget while tourism will remain low while conflicts threaten safety. As Gouspillou explains, Bitcoin mining is one solution to the park\u2019s problems, as it provides a source of revenue that can be used to protect the park and its wildlife for years to come."

        "content": "Canada-based Bitcoin (BTC) miner Hut 8 Mining Corporation has ramped up its ongoing fight with its power supplier for one of its mining sites, filing a lawsuit in a Canadian court.\n\nHut 8 said on Jan. 26 that it had filed a Statement of Claim in the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario against Validus Power, an energy supplier for a Hut 8 mining facility in North Bay, Ontario.\n\nThe firms have been in an ongoing dispute since early November due to what Hut 8 alleges is a failure by Validus to \u201cmeet its contractual obligations\u201d for the power purchase agreement.\n\nIn its new lawsuit, Hut 8 is seeking \u201cmonetary damages incurred as a result of the dispute\u201d and enforcement of certain provisions as per the agreement signed by the two companies.\n\nHut 8 and Validus started working together in late 2021, with Validus initially set to provide 35 megawatts (MW) of power to North Bay, a figure set to increase to around 100 MW by the end of 2021. The site was operating at 20 MW by July 2022 according to Hut 8.\n\nA June photo from the North Bay facility showing multiple ASIC crypto miners. Source: Hut 8\n\nOn Nov. 9, Hut 8 issued a notice of default to Validus, alleging it failed to achieve milestones by the dates outlined in the power purchase agreement and claiming that the firm demanded Hut 8 pay for energy at a higher price than the agreement called for.\n\nAn update from Hut 8 later that month revealed Validus suspended the delivery of energy to its North Bay site. Validus fired back with its own default notice alleging that Hut 8 failed to pay for its power charges, a claim Hut 8 denies.\n\nTo this date, operations at the site remain suspended. Hut 8 said it is exploring alternatives to mitigate the impact of the dispute, including through \u201corganic and inorganic growth opportunities.\u201d\n\nRelated: Bitcoin miners\u2019 worst days may have passed, but a few key hurdles remain\n\nBefore it was taken offline, the North Bay site had 8,800 crypto mining rigs and a hash rate capacity of 0.84 exahashes per second (EH/s), accounting for over one-fourth of its total production capacity, according to a December investor deck.\n\nCointelegraph contacted Validus for comment but did not receive an immediate response."

        "content": "Despite the recent negative crypto and macroeconomic newsflow, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization broke above $1 trillion on Jan. 21. An encouraging sign is that derivatives metrics are not showing increased demand from bearish traders at the moment.\n\nTotal crypto market cap in USD, 1-day. Source: TradingView\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price gained 8% this week, stabilizing near the $23,100 level at 18:00 UTC on Jan. 27 as the markets weighed the potential impact of Genesis Global Capital\u2019s bankruptcy on Jan. 19.\n\nOne area of concern is Genesis Capital\u2019s largest debtor, the Digital Currency Group, its parent company. Consequently, Grayscale funds management could be at risk, with investors unsure if Grayscale Bitcoin Trust assets could face liquidation. The investment vehicle currently holds over $14 billion worth of Bitcoin positions for its holders.\n\nA United States appeals court is set to hear the arguments relating to Grayscale Investment\u2019s lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 8. The fund manager questioned the SEC\u2019s decision to deny their asset-backed exchange-traded fund launch.\n\nRegulatory concerns also negatively impacted the markets after South Korean prosecutors requested an arrest warrant for Bithumb exchange owner Kang Jong-Hyun. On Jan. 25, the Financial Investigation 2nd Division of the Seoul Southern District Prosecutor's Office sentenced Kang and two Bithumb executives on charges of conducting fraudulent illegal transactions.\n\nThe 7% weekly increase in total market capitalization was held back by Ether\u2019s (ETH) 0.3% negative price move. Still, the bullish sentiment significantly impacted altcoins, with 11 of the top 80 coins gaining 18% or more in the period.\n\nWeekly winners and losers among the top 80 coins. Source: Messari\n\nAptos (APT) gained 91% after the smart contract network total value locked reached a record-high $58 million, fueled by the PancakeSwap decentralized exchange.\n\nFantom (FTM) rallied 50% after the announcement of its new database system, Carmen and a new Fantom Virtual Machine, Tosca.\n\nOptimism (OP) saw 21% gains after a sharp increase in transaction volumes during a nonfungible token incentive program called Optimism Quest.\n\nLeverage demand slightly favors bulls\n\nPerpetual contracts, also known as inverse swaps, have an embedded rate usually charged every eight hours. Exchanges use this fee to avoid exchange risk imbalances.\n\nA positive funding rate indicates that longs (buyers) demand more leverage. However, the opposite situation occurs when shorts (sellers) require additional leverage, causing the funding rate to turn negative.\n\nPerpetual futures accumulated 7-day funding rate on Jan. 27. Source: Coinglass\n\nThe 7-day funding rate was positive for Bitcoin and Ethereum, meaning the data points to slightly higher demand for leverage longs (buyers) versus shorts (sellers). Still, a 0.25% weekly funding cost is not enough to discourage leverage buyers.\n\nInterestingly, Aptos was the only exception as the altcoin presented a negative 0.6% weekly funding cost, with short sellers paying to keep their positions open. This movement can be explained by the 91% rally in seven days and it suggests that sellers expect some sort of technical correction.\n\nThe options put/call ratio shows no signs of fear\n\nTraders can gauge the market\u2019s overall sentiment by measuring whether more activity is going through call (buy) options or put (sell) options. Generally speaking, call options are used for bullish strategies, whereas put options are for bearish ones.\n\nA 0.70 put-to-call ratio indicates that put options open interest lag the more bullish calls by 30% and is therefore bullish. In contrast, a 1.40 indicator favors put options by 40%, which can be deemed bearish.\n\nBTC options volume put-to-call ratio. Source: laevitas.ch\n\nEven though Bitcoin\u2019s price failed to break the $23,300 resistance, the demand for bullish call options has exceeded the neutral-to-bear puts since Jan. 6.\n\nPresently, the put-to-call volume ratio stands near 0.50 as the options market is more strongly populated by neutral-to-bullish strategies, favoring call (buy) options by 50%.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin will hit $200K before $70K \u2018bear market\u2019 next cycle \u2014 Forecast\n\nDerivatives markets point to further upside potential\n\nAfter the third consecutive week of gains, which totals 40% year-to-date when excluding stablecoins, there are no signs of demand from short sellers. More importantly, leverage indicators show bulls are not using excessive leverage.\n\nDerivatives markets point to further upside potential. Even if the market revisits the $950 billion market capitalization from Jan. 18, there is no reason for panic. Currently, Bitcoin option markets show whales and market makers favoring the neutral-to-bullish strategies.\n\nUltimately, the odds favor those betting that the $1 trillion total market cap will hold, opening room for further gains.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

He published a video on YouTube on May 9, 2013, asking investors to buy a minimum of $1 worth of BTC. 10 years later, the early Bitcoin adopter is possibly hinting that investors should pay attention to Shiba Inu.\n\nJeremie predicted 10 years ago that buying Bitcoin would change people\u2019s fortunes and deliver them life-changing gains. His prediction, of course, turned out to be true as BTC touched $69,000 in 2021.\n\nJeremie\u2019s remark on Shiba Inu came as a response to a user who asked \u201cWhich Altcoin should I spend my USDT on?\u201d. The early Bitcoin adopter swiftly replied, \u201cUmm SHIB\u201d.\n\nAlso Read: How Long Will Shiba Inu Take To Reach $0.01?

        "content": "The ATM industry is no stranger to high profile acquisitions and the bitcoin side of the industry has joined the trend. Bitstop, a bitcoin ATM provider, has acquired Genesis Coin, which powers more than 12,000 bitcoin ATMs in the U.S., and accounts for 31.9% of all such machines worldwide.\n\nThe ATM industry is no stranger to high profile acquisitions and the bitcoin side of the industry has joined the trend.\n\nOn Jan. 24, Bitstop, a bitcoin ATM provider, acquired Genesis Coin, which powers more than 12,000 bitcoin ATMs in the U.S., and accounts for 31.9% of all such machines worldwide, according to Coin ATM Radar.\n\nAndrew Barnard and Doug Carrillo, co-founders of Bitstop will take over as CEO and chief strategy officer respectively. Evan Rose, founder CEO of Genesis Coin, will transition as a technical advisor and current board member.\n\n\"Genesis Coin gave birth to the bitcoin ATM industry,\" Barnard said in a press release. \"It's the first and largest bitcoin ATM software platform in the world. Evan built a platform trusted by some of the largest bitcoin ATM operators in our industry, both domestically and internationally, including the Chivo network in partnership with the government of El Salvador.\"\n\nTo learn more about what the acquisition means for the industry, ATM Marketplace reached out to Andrew Barnard, co-founder and CEO of Bitstop, via an email interview.\n\nQ. Can you give a little background on the acquisition?\n\nA. Evan, Doug and I have known of each other since the beginning of the industry. We have been building this industry separately and now we are building it together. We explored a potential partnership in the past, but it was a little too early. We recently got together again to talk about the future at a high-level. The timing was right. The vision alignment felt good. The energy was all there. It felt natural. It came together effortlessly.\n\nQ. What does the geographic reach of the two companies look like?\n\nA.Bitstop and Genesis Coin both have robust coverage in the United States. Genesis Coin has more international presence especially in Latin America with Athena and the Chivo partnership with the government of El Salvador. Bitstop is beginning to establish international operations with strategic partners. We have operators in Europe, Australia and Asia. We plan to focus a lot more on international growth with the added resources we have and some of the partners we are talking to.\n\nQ. How will this improve bitcoin ATM services?\n\nA.Both companies will continue to build out a team. Genesis Coin is beginning to make key hires and grow its team. We believe in efficiency and running lean, but it's also important to make sure there is redundancy, continuity and legacy. You need a team to give operators a strong stable foundation if you want them to build bigger and scale without fear. That's the goal.\n\nIn the short-term we will continue to optimize and enhance current service. Over the long-term, we will evaluate technical synergies and make important strategic decisions about long-term infrastructure investments that support our plans for future growth.\n\nQ. What excites you the most about this acquisition?\n\nA. The opportunity is massive for Genesis Coin and Bitstop. We're the only major United States-based private and white-label platforms remaining that continue to remain independent and neutral. We do not operate machines. We have no operator ownership. We avoid conflicts of interest. We hyper-focus on building the best and most reliable software and supporting our operators' needs so they can deliver maximum value to their customers. We're working with the best operators worldwide both privately owned and publicly traded. Any organic M&A activity happening in this space almost exclusively happens on the Genesis Coin and Bitstop platforms for a reason. We have created a standard for the industry. The future is bright.\n\nQ. Can you share anything about your future plans with Genesis Coin?\n\nA. We can't say too much and we have some more exciting news coming. For now we can say we are evaluating technical synergies between both platforms. We want to help our operators become as hyper efficient as possible while making it easy to scale. There's still many pain points when it comes to operating which lead to excessive overhead. When you look at the traditional ATM space, many operators are still running up to five times the body count compared to a traditional ATM operation. We want to lower that inefficiency difference for Genesis Coin operators by at least 50% within the next two years. We have many ideas on how to accomplish this and believe that this will be a winning formula long-term."

        "content": "During the last few weeks of 2022, the vast majority of crypto analysts and industry experts explained that the first quarter of 2023 probably won\u2019t bring much novelty to the market. In fact, investors expected another downturn to take place.\n\nBut, as it so often happens with the crypto market, the complete opposite happened.\n\nBitcoin and the leading altcoins saw some impressive surges in January, with BTC successfully surpassing the $22,000 resistance once again and bringing around 36% returns.\n\nThe only question is\u2026 will Bitcoin reach $30,000 in 2023 and will it be able to match the growth of Meta Masters Guild (MEMAG), FightOut (FGHT), RobotEra (TARO), and C+Charge (CCHG).\n\n>>>Get the Best Presale Project Now<<<\n\nWill Bitcoin Hit $30,000 in 2023?\n\nIn 2022, Bitcoin lost more than 70% of its all-time high value from November 10th, 2021 ($69,045) and struggled throughout the whole year to maintain the $20,000 target.\n\nOn January 16th, the leading crypto asset finally broke the $23,000 mark, for the first time in the last five months, causing the rest of the market to enter a bullish rally as well.\n\nSome analysts pin this on the fact that there might be a possible pause in Fed rate hike\u2019s as inflation is finally being put under control, for the time being.\n\nHowever, there are some major issues with BTC that have to be addressed.\n\nFirstly, Bitcoin still hasn\u2019t really evolved into the widespread global payment system that everyone anticipated, in fact, it\u2019s being heavily outperformed by the likes of Ethereum and Solana.\n\nIt\u2019s still using the PoW system that most other altcoins are now leaving behind and transferring to the PoS module that\u2019s both faster and more eco-friendly.\n\nBut, the interesting thing about Bitcoin is that it holds the most authority in the market. While this might not make always sense investment-wise, it\u2019s one of the key reasons why it hasn\u2019t been surpassed by Ethereum which many call \u201cthe better cryptocurrency\u201d.\n\nBitcoin can certainly hit $30,000 in 2023 and it is one longer bullish rally away from this price, but it needs to incorporate some network changes to sustain the larger prices.\n\nLastly, it\u2019s worth mentioning that Bitcoin isn\u2019t a short-term profit type of coin. If you\u2019re looking to get much bigger returns quicker, here are the tokens you should focus on.\n\n>>>Get the Best Presale Project Now<<<\n\nMeta Masters Guild (MEMAG)\n\nMeta Masters Guild is a blockchain-based gaming guild that\u2019s looking to create the first mobile-based Web3 game for users.\n\nThe play-to-earn ecosystem is extremely advanced and unique, with $MEMAG, the native utility token, found at the forefront as the primary currency for all platform activities.\n\nBy participating in the gaming guild, players will be able to earn rewards and get a taste of numerous benefits.\n\nAside from $MEMAG, there\u2019s also GEMS that serve as the in-game currency and it will be used for reward distribution.\n\nWe can expect several games to be released in the ecosystem, with Meta Kart Racers, NFT Raid, and Meta masters World already in progress.\n\nYou can get in on this project early right now by joining the presale. According to numerous analysts, this project could easily bring 20-40x returns once it goes viral.\n\n>>>Buy MEMAG Now<<<\n\nFightOut (FGHT)\n\nFightOut is coming out as the most advanced Move-to-Earn (M2E) project we\u2019ve ever seen in this niche industry.\n\nFor starters, it provides personalized training and diet regimes for users that are created with the help of real-world trainers. These regimes are tailored to the user\u2019s body type and needs, and are one of the healthiest ways they can get in shape.\n\nThere\u2019s also a real-world gym chain that will be launched in several locations around the globe. Players will be able to use the state-of-the-art equipment and showcase their soulbound NFT avatars.\n\nThe whole industry is now talking about FightOut\u2019s amazing concept and the huge potential it has to explode in value in 2023.\n\nIf you want to take part in this hype and profit from it, you can join the presale right now and get tokens for a huge discount.\n\n>>>Buy FGHT Now<<<\n\nRobotEra (TARO)\n\nIf you ever wondered what our planet would look like if robots suddenly took over, well, RobotEra\u2019s immersive Metaverse will help you experience just that.\n\nRobotEra is a Metaverse-based P2E project that leverages blockchain and NFT technology to provide users with the best possible digital universe experience.\n\nIt functions as a shared multiverse, which means there will be several games featured in the TARO universe.\n\nPlayers can earn money in numerous ways, with land trading and mission completions being the most popular ones.\n\nTARO tokens are also on presale right now and, according to experts, it\u2019s the lowest price we\u2019ll probably ever see.\n\n>>>Buy TARO Now<<<\n\nC+Charge (CCHG)\n\nWhile the EV (electric vehicle) industry has been rapidly expanding in the past few years, there haven\u2019t really been any blockchain projects to take advantage of it and connect\u2026 until now.\n\nC+Charge works as a P2P (peer-to-peer) payment system that leverages carbon credits, NFTs, and blockchain technology to provide numerous perks to EV drivers.\n\nThe team is developing a mobile app that will showcase the nearest charging stations to users and also include details on whether there\u2019s a big waiting line.\n\nDrivers that charge their vehicles at some C+Charge pre-defined stations will be rewarded with carbon credits that they can later utilize with CCHG tokens and NFTs.\n\nOverall, C+Charge is being called the \u201cgreenest cryptocurrency of 2023\u201d and as such, we can expect at least 20-30x returns by Q4 2023.\n\n>>>Buy CCHG Now<<<\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nBitcoin has been looking great these last few weeks and has certainly made lots of investors regain trust in the crypto market.\n\nThe leading altcoins have followed in its footsteps and also recorded some solid returns, which is a trend that will likely continue at least until the end of January.\n\nIf global inflation somewhat stabilizes in the upcoming months and we don\u2019t experience any more enormous black swan events (e.g. FTX and Terra Luna), it\u2019s certainly possible for BTC to reach 30k or even more.\n\nHowever, we can\u2019t expect any larger returns for the time being. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for, it\u2019s much better to focus on presale projects like MEMAG, FGHT, TARO, and CCHG.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Ripple's former director of developer relations, Matt Hamilton, has expressed his position on why XRP has not gained the same popularity and acceptance as Bitcoin (BTC) after being asked by one of his followers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the moment, Bitcoin is in first place in the ranking of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap, and XRP is in sixth place.\n\nTwo reasons why XRP did not repeat Bitcoin's success\n\nHamilton responded based on two points, the first of which was that BTC had a first mover advantage. Recall that XRP was launched three years after BTC, in 2012, by David Schwartz, Arthur Britto and Jed McCaleb.\n\nAs Hamilton says, at that time, 11 years ago, no one understood anything about asset tokenization or decentralized exchanges, which were available in XRPL. \"XRP Ledger was ahead of its time,\" the developer concluded.\n\nThe second reason, according to Hamilton, is information attacks on XRP. First, fear, uncertainty and doubt about XRP were stirred up by Bitcoin maximalists, and then the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) got involved, he says.\n\nRecall that even before the SEC litigation, Ripple had been penalized by another regulator on charges of unregistered sales of XRP, as well as the violation of conducting an anti-money laundering program. The case then ended in a settlement in which Ripple Labs and the XRP II Foundation were fined $700,000."

        "content": "Bitcoin may regain some volatility to end the month as options expire.\n\nExchange reserves drop to a monthly low but some whales are still cashing out.\n\nThere are only a few days remaining until the month ends but this might be enough time for a major Bitcoin move. It has been losing volatility in the last few days but there is one event that can potentially trigger a resurgence of volatility.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nAccording to the latest Glassnode Alerts, Bitcoin holders net position change dropped to a new low of just over 30.5 million. This is confirmation that many BTC holders that bought in the last 30 days are still holding onto their coins.\n\n? #Bitcoin $BTC HODLer Net Position Change just reached a 1-month low of 30,563.076 Previous 1-month low of 31,267.601 was observed on 11 January 2023 View metric:https://t.co/CU3jPaaHXh pic.twitter.com/O8luRaHDiS \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) January 27, 2023\n\nWill Bitcoin options expiry trigger a volatility resurgence?\n\nA large amount of Bitcoin options were set to expire on 27 January. This means the holders of those options may exercise calls or put options worth millions, potentially triggering another major price move. The market may thus experience a bullish or a bearish outcome this weekend depending on which directions the options will favor.\n\nThe latest rally and the fact that many investors are choosing to HODL may catch the bears off-guard. Meanwhile, multiple indicators currently point towards a bullish bias. For example, the Bitcoin exchange reserve dropped to a new monthly low in the last 24 hours. This means more coins are flowing out of exchanges.\n\nThe market sentiment on the derivatives segment also looked bullish. The Bitcoin open interest metric registered additional upside in the last two days. This confirms a bit of a surge in demand from the derivatives.\n\nThe above observations align with Bitcoin\u2019s price action in the last 24 hours. BTC managed to push back above the $23,000 price level once again as the bulls regained control.\n\nDespite extending its upside, BTC\u2019s MFI suggests that money is flowing out of the coin. This is not the only indicator that is currently contradicting the price.\n\nAddresses holding over 1,000 BTC have been adding to their balances, for the most part, this month. There have been periods where there have been outflows, and this has been the case in the last two days.\n\nThe above chart suggests that the addresses holding over 1,000 BTC have been selling in The last 48 hours. This aligns with the MFI and may indicate a build-up of sell pressure even though the price rallied in the last 24 hours.\n\nAnother interesting observation is that Bitcoin miners have been trimming their reserves since 12 January. The same metric has been flat from 19 January to the present.\n\nOne would expect that miners would be hodling during the bull market but that does not seem to be the case. Nevertheless, the market appears to be going for another spike to end the month, although it would not be surprising if it closed lower."

        "content": "2023 started Bitcoin to peak at US$32,000, after experiencing the twirl in the crypto market in 2022.\n\nIt is challenging to make predictions regarding the future of Bitcoin because the technology is volatile. However, experts anticipate that over the coming years, Bitcoin\u2019s cryptocurrency value and appeal will increase. Bitcoin in 2023, may gain acceptance as a method of payment and perhaps enter the mainstream. In 2010 bitcoin mining, the token\u2019s price fluctuated between $0.0008 to $0.08. 2022 Bitcoin market pricing was at an average price of $16,793. The crypto pricing had an effect due to the FTX collapse, witnessing the bearish market last year. Besides the bearish BTC market, Bitcoin peaks now in 2023 and holds a value of US$22,961. With a promising future, Bitcoin to peak at US$32,000 in 2023.\n\nA study on the future price of bitcoin was undertaken by Finder.com with the help of around fifty industry professionals from the financial innovation and cryptocurrency sectors. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading for under $23,000 a unit on January 27, 2023, which is a good value after FTX plummeted in November 2022. According to the most recent BTC forecasts research from finder.com, bitcoin is expected to reach its all-time high of $29,095 in 2023.\n\nThe participants of finder predict that 21% of investors will switch to other asset sectors by end of this year and away from the cryptocurrency sector. Alexander Kuptsikevich, senior industry analyst at Fxpro, and almost 65% of experts think bitcoin is fairly priced. The most recent sales episode in cryptocurrencies has concluded. The year 2023 will see a cautious price recovery.\n\nIn 2025, bitcoin, according to a senior researcher and editor Damian Chmiel of Finance Magnates, would cost approximately US$70,000 per unit. However, Chmiel believes that two items must happen: Wall Street should once more be enthusiastic about digital currencies, and the U.S. Federal Reserve must cease its present economic strict policies. However, the senior analyst for Finance Magnates continued, over time, bitcoin will gain popularity among investors.\n\nTim Draper, a proponent of bitcoin, predicted that the orientation of females\u2019 crypto and retail spending patterns will indeed boost the uptake of wallets and push the price of bitcoin in 2023 to US$250,000. By the close of 2022, Draper anticipated that Bitcoin would reach a value of US$250,000. According to Carol Alexander, a professor at Sussex University, Bitcoin might reach $30,000 in the first half of 2023 and $50,000 in the second of 2023.\n\nAccording to analysts, there is a good possibility that Bitcoin will experience a bullish surge. As per experts, Bitcoin will keep growing in popularity in 2023, and if key factors stay the very same, this trend should continue into 2024. When Bitcoin hits its crucial support, it is known to recover. At the end of 2023, the price range of US$32,000 is anticipated to be broken.\n\nRealistic Bitcoin predictions based on past price patterns indicate that the currency may reach a new record by 2025, hitting US$70,000 and then declining to US$65,000. Additionally, a few analysts believe that a significant bull market following the economic rebound in 2023 would be able to drive Bitcoin above the $70,000 barrier by 2025.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Barry Silbert was bullish on Bitcoin BSV\u2014even in 2014 - CoinGeek",
        "content": "In the wake of Genesis Global Trading (and a bunch of their subsidiaries) filing for bankruptcy, we should revisit the history of Genesis\u2019 parent company: Digital Currency Group.\n\nDCG is an incubator and investment conglomerate founded by Barry Silbert. In the 2017-2022 era, Silbert transitioned to a heavily multi-chain and speculation/trading based investment strategy to take advantage of frothy markets which led to incredible profits and ended in one of the major bankruptcies of this bear market.\n\nJust a few years before, he was speaking a very different tune about bitcoin.\n\nIn 2014, Silbert gave an interview to NBC explaining why he was bullish on Bitcoin, and humorously enough, I agreed with all his points! It\u2019s a great illustration of my perpetual and ongoing point that Bitcoin is unchanged in BSV, but notably different in BTC as a product of The Bitcoin Civil War.\n\nFunny, this sounds like it could have been said by myself, the guys from Twetch or even Craig Wright. Instead, Bitcoin was hampered, Facebook is on its 3rd digital currency iteration, and both money and data silos in the social media space have only gotten worse in the meantime.\n\nToo bad we didn\u2019t adopt Bitcoin on Facebook in 2014!\n\nCurious timing for Barry to bring this up because, at the time, most bitcoiners thought this was inevitable. Bitcoin was an incredible payments technology, and by 2023, we probably would have seen Visa, MasterCard and PayPal adopt Bitcoin as the network upon which they ran their payments.\n\nHowever, less than a year from the time of this interview, Silbert accepted money from Mastercard Ventures which led to DCG investing in the creation of companies like Blockstream and Lightning Labs who were dedicated to hampering Bitcoin so that their side chain and \u201csecond layer\u201d solutions could be commercialized to the detriment of bitcoin adoption.\n\nSorry, \u201ccommerce on the internet,\u201d DCG took money from payments companies that had other plans for Bitcoin! And it all happened very rapidly in 2015\u2014which is curious.\n\nThis one is extra sad because global remittance was such an obvious use case for early Bitcoin adoption. MoneyGram and Western Union both could have used bitcoin as liquidity, transmission and settlement of global funds at any point in the last 10 years, and it would have worked famously.\n\nInstead, because of the Bitcoin Civil War, Ripple entered into an agreement with MoneyGram to offer their centralized (and DCG partnered) RippleNet solution which ultimately failed and was deprecated in 2021 with a brief press release.\n\nFurthermore, not only have MoneyGram and Western Union persisted in the vacuum that Bitcoin left open, but in the meantime, we have seen the rise of Venmo, Zelle, WeChat and innumerable national and regional payment and remittance solutions take rise around the world.\n\nFor the last entry, I have to agree with Silbert yet again. It\u2019s unfortunate, but because of his waffling on Bitcoin, he has not made any progress toward achieving these goals. His portfolio companies have, instead, heavily emphasized margin trading, lending, borrowing, yield farming and custodial services for the crypto casino economy.\n\nFolks like myself continue to focus on Silbert\u2019s original stated vision of Bitcoin. It was truly Satoshi\u2019s Vision when we were all bitcoiners, and only in BSV do we work toward these grand challenges in global finance.\n\nThe saddest part is that now we do it mostly alone and under public scrutiny under the presumption that Bitcoin was never intended for micropayents.\n\nWhat happened to you, Barry?\n\nRead the original interview here.\n\nFollow CoinGeek\u2019s Crypto Crime Cartel series, which delves into the stream of groups\u2014from BitMEX to Binance, Bitcoin.com, Blockstream, ShapeShift, Coinbase, Ripple, Ethereum, FTX and Tether\u2014who have co-opted the digital asset revolution and turned the industry into a minefield for na\u00efve (and even experienced) players in the market.\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "title": "Farida Nabourema is teaching people how to liberate themselves with Bitcoin - TechCabal",
        "content": "Farida Nabourema is a Togolese activist who was born and raised under a military regime. From the time she was a child, Nabourema watched her grandfather and father oppose the harsh dictatorship, occasionally landing in jail; and in no time, she found herself doing the same. Nabourema has been an activist for over 20 years now and is passionate about freeing people from unjust systems, this passion bringing her to bitcoin.\n\nNabourema was looking for a tool to help counter the government\u2019s surveillance of how activists and opposition leaders received money, which consequently led to confiscation to prevent them from operating\u2014something they had been doing for decades. In the process, she stumbled upon bitcoin. This currency, which provided a private way of moving money without government control, fascinated her so much that six years later, she is committed to working in the bitcoin space and helping other Africans explore this. According to Nabourema, bitcoin is political and is a tool to help facilitate human rights by liberating people from abusive and exploitative monetary systems. She believes that monetary independence is the beginning of a lot of political struggles and that a system that provides people with the ability to move money without government interference is a foundation for freedom.\n\nIn December 2022, Nabourema organised the Africa Bitcoin Conference, the first and largest major bitcoin event to take place in Africa. The three-day event saw some of the biggest names in the global bitcoin scene, including Twitter founder and ex-CEO Jack Dorsey, Ray Youssef, and Obi Nwosu converge in Accra, Ghana.\n\nTell me about the African Bitcoin Conference. How did the idea come about?\n\nI attend a lot of bitcoin conferences in the West and realised that there were not enough African voices in the space, even though Africa has the fastest adoption rate on the globe, and we\u2019re literally the ones propelling the currency. Africans were not adequately represented in those spaces for multiple reasons, a major one being that those Western countries typically required visas for entry, which they sometimes denied to African-passport-holders. This made me realise that we did not have to wait for others to organise their conferences and invite us, and we could organise ours and speak about the work that we are doing on our own soil.\n\nIt\u2019s essential for us to organise our own conferences on the continent that brings together the people working in this space, whether it is the technologists, the researchers, or the activists, putting them together to discuss challenges, opportunities, and innovations that are directly tailored to our realities in Africa.\n\nWould you say that you set out to achieve what you intended to with the conference?\n\nI believe I did. One of the things we wanted to achieve with this conference was to make people understand that bitcoin is serious business and not an online scam as some people portray it as. It is a technology on which multiple things can be built. We wanted to open people\u2019s minds to the reality of bitcoin as a legit technology with real people working every day to make it better and more flexible. From the feedback we received, people were impressed\u2014especially those who have never really been in the bitcoin space.\n\nAnother thing we wanted to achieve was to introduce bitcoin from an angle beyond what people hear about in the mainstream: the human angle. I am an activist, just like other members of my team and we wanted to focus more on the utility of bitcoin, and how people can use it to better their lives, not the price. We wanted to organise a conference that prioritised panels on its philosophy and why it is imperative to break free from exploitative monetary and financial systems, rather than just discussions on how much it costs and how much you can make from it. This is something we successfully accomplished and our participants really appreciated that.\n\nImage source: Africa Bitcoin Conference\n\nWhile Africa is leading in bitcoin adoption, a lot of it stems from a desire to grow money and invest. Is that good enough for a start? Or do you think that adoption that is hinged on profit is detrimental to the growth of bitcoin in the long run?\n\nHuman beings are naturally driven by interest regardless of what they do and there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with that. However, I come from a space where I believe people shouldn\u2019t bypass certain values and principles just for profit. In the work that we do to educate people on Bitcoin, it is important to us that we are able to communicate those values and principles to people so that they understand that for this currency to be sustainable and profitable in the long run, there are mistakes that we should avoid.\n\nSome of these mistakes include preying on vulnerable people by way of scams, and hoarding excessive wealth for yourself while everybody else gets poorer. It matters to me that we remind people of the good nature of bitcoin and that the reason it was invented was that the founder(s) wanted to put an end to some systemic exploitation. The thought of making a profit is a good reason to go into bitcoin, as long as you are not destroying our society and exploiting others.\n\nDo you see mass adoption of bitcoin across Africa? Do you think we can achieve decentralised bitcoin in Africa despite the heavy interference from middlemen and government institutions?\n\nThe reason we keep relying heavily on middlemen and government institutions today is that we haven\u2019t reached the point where everybody has enough to be able to exchange it directly. The more people use it, the more we get to the point where we no longer need those institutions to convert bitcoin to cash. It\u2019s going to take time, but we\u2019re going to get there. We keep expecting Bitcoin to do the same thing as cash, forgetting that cash has existed for hundreds of years while bitcoin has been in existence for less than 20 years. In terms of growth and adoption, bitcoin has experienced the fastest growth of any form of money that has been used in the world, including gold and cash, which is a positive sign. Bitcoin is growing, and we must give it space to fully form. I currently don\u2019t see the lack of financial infrastructures as being an impediment but an opportunity for us to create solutions and innovate ways to make it more accessible. We will get to the point where it will be as easy to use\u2014if not even easier to use\u2014than cash.\n\nBitcoin is simultaneously the innovation with one of the fastest rates of technological adoption in the world as well as the best-performing asset of the decade. The number of people using the currency is growing rapidly and is projected to reach 1 billion by 2025, with the speed of adoption being even higher than the internet.\n\nThere have been concerns surrounding the technical savviness that transacting in bitcoin requires. Do you think that will be a huge challenge for us in Africa?\n\nI think that is a huge misconception. I have taught people with no formal education how to use bitcoin and they understood it all within 30 minutes. People who aren\u2019t necessarily educated know how to use calculators in the market and how to count their money. They know how to use smartphones alongside apps like TikTok and Whatsapp, so why can\u2019t they use a bitcoin wallet? Bitcoin is just about as simple as having a smartphone, downloading a wallet, and scanning to make payments. It takes less than five seconds and you don\u2019t need to understand technology to do it.\n\nIt is important for people to understand how the technology of bitcoin works so as not to be exploited, but it should not deter anyone from using it. People use cash without knowing how the central banks work, or how and why money is being printed.\n\nShare this article"

        "content": "Looking at the 1-hour chart of Bitcoin/USDT displayed below, Bitcoin has been trading at $22987 as of press time. A breakout from the previous range bound pattern occurred, leading to a drop to the key support level at $22610.21.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-Hour Analysis (Source: TradingView)\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin is still above the 200-day moving average meaning that the bulls are still in control of the market although bears are sneaking to take the throne. However, they cannot resist the bull power at the moment.\n\nAdditionally, the Bull Bear Power (BBP) indicator displays a value of 24.45, indicating strong buying pressure pushing against the 200-day moving average. The Average True Range (ATR) for Bitcoin is currently at 152, with a downward-sloping trend, suggesting weaker volatility in the current market trend.\n\nCurrently, the 1-hour chart of Bitcoin/USDT is displaying key resistance levels at $23750 and $23850, while key support levels are located at $22610.21 and $22425.58. A breach below the current support zone could potentially lead to a breakdown of the 200-day moving average, providing a potential buying opportunity for investors. However, bullish sentiment remains strong as buyers maintain control of the market and defend against any bearish attempts to break through support levels.\n\nAnother important technical indicator to consider is the relative strength index (RSI). The RSI value for Bitcoin/USDT is currently at 49.53, indicating that the market is trading near support. Historically, RSI readings below 30 have signaled that the asset is oversold, while readings above 70 have indicated overbought conditions.\n\nIn the event of a breakout above the current resistance zone, we could potentially see a continuation of the uptrend, with Bitcoin potentially reaching new highs above $25,000. This could also have a positive impact on the overall cryptocurrency market. However, it is important for investors and traders to analyze multiple indicators and look for patterns within the current price range before making any trading decisions.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Tycoon pals of Prince Andrew hit by losses in Bitcoin firm - This is Money",
        "content": "Businessman Jonathan Rowland and his father David, who is famous for reportedly bankrolling Prince Andrew, have lost millions on a cryptocurrency venture that has gone to the wall. Jonathan, 47, is winding down much of Mode Global Holdings, a Bitcoin app he founded, after failing to secure the money it needed to survive.\n\nMode Global was the latest in a string of companies set up by the serial entrepreneur, with mixed success.\n\nHis father David, 77, a property tycoon and prominent donor to the Conservative party, had a stake in his son's venture. Rowland senior, who was nicknamed 'Spotty' for his relative youth when he floated his first company on the stock exchange aged 23, has accumulated vast wealth through property and banking.\n\nRoyal links: Jonathan Rowland and his then partner Anya at Princess Eugenie's wedding\n\nJonathan, keen to follow in the paternal footsteps, had grand ambitions for Mode. He wanted to transform it from a payments app to the 'most trusted' crypto company in the world. Christopher Isaac 'Biz' Stone, a US technology investor and co-founder of Twitter, also held shares.\n\nLess than two-and-a-half years since Mode was listed on the London Stock Exchange, those dreams are in tatters.\n\nInvestors have seen their holdings virtually wiped out as the share price nosedived from its 77p peak in February 2021, when Mode was estimated to be worth \u00a362 million, to half a penny last week.\n\nHowever, it is far from the first embarrassment for the father and son duo, including over their relationship with Prince Andrew.\n\nDavid Rowland \u2013 a long-time Guernsey resident who has been dubbed the 'tax haven tycoon' \u2013 has acted as the Duke of York's financial adviser. He had a front-row seat at his daughter Princess Eugenie's wedding in 2018.\n\nThe year before, Rowland senior reportedly paid off a \u00a31.5 million loan for Andrew through his Luxembourg bank, Banque Havilland. Leaked documents revealed that the Duke of York had also sought a \u00a3200,000 loan from Jonathan Rowland, who was at the time chief executive of the bank. On another occasion, David and Jonathan flew to North Korea, widely viewed as a pariah state under dictator Kim Jong Un, to look at an 'investment opportunity'.\n\nDavid owns a palatial estate on Guernsey called Havilland Hall \u2013 where in 2005 Prince Andrew unveiled a lifesize bronze statue of Rowland smoking a cigar.\n\nBacker: David Rowland paid off a \u00a31.5 million loan for the Duke of York\n\nJonathan has struggled to emerge from his father's shadow and emulate his success in business. After spending years as a racing driver, he first made headlines in his 20s, when he set up an internet investment company called Jellyworks. Its shares initially surged, and at its peak the firm was valued at \u00a3300 million.\n\nBut within six months it disappeared from the stock market amid difficulty raising fresh finance.More recently, he has co-founded a lender for small businesses called Redwood Bank, and was even linked to a bid for crisis-stricken football club Wigan Athletic.\n\nHis personal life has also been eventful. He once revealed he had a stroke while in bed with a woman he 'shouldn't have been with' \u2013 but joked that at least she was there to call an ambulance.\n\nJonathan is heir to a fortune believed to run into hundreds of millions of pounds.\n\nHe and his father held around 30 per cent of shares in Mode Global but clearly were unwilling to stake any more family wealth on the venture. Mode will this week start winding up large sections of the business \u2013 shutting its app in the coming weeks and closing down subsidiaries Fibere and JGOO.\n\nEarlier this month chief executive Rita Liu resigned.\n\nMode uses open banking to allow customers to transfer cash into their accounts, which they could then use to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It is also a payments app and customers could receive Bitcoin 'cashback' for purchases at its partner brands.\n\nThe group has urged customers to withdraw their cash but it is not clear if there is a deadline or how much money Mode is holding. The Bitcoin itself was held by a company called Bitgo.\n\nMode said that customers' cash and cryptocurrency assets 'will remain safe' and there are no restrictions on withdrawals.\n\nJonathan declined to comment."

        "title": "Technical analysis of Bitcoin and Ethereum - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a very positive moment, with the Fear&Greed Index marking 55 points, the first \u201cgreed\u201d signal since April 2022. This is a promising signal after months of fluctuations between fear and neutrality, confirming a promising start to the year for cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn less than a month, cryptocurrency capitalization has managed to recover more than 30%, rising from $797 billion at the end of 2022, to about $1,050 billion today.\n\nMost of the credit for this increase has gone to Bitcoin, which has surpassed $23k, recovering its August 2021 prices and wiping out the decline caused by the FTX crisis.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, is returning to the highs of early November 2022 at $1,600, maintaining a market share of 18%.\n\nAltcoins are also performing well, with some of the major and best-known ones such as Solana (SOL) and Decentraland (MANA) each gaining more than 120% since the beginning of the month. Over the past week, all of the top 50 cryptocurrencies by capitalization are on their way to closing with gains.\n\nIn particular, should Sunday night\u2019s close confirm current levels, it would be the fourth consecutive weekly close above par for Bitcoin, an event that has not occurred since August 2021.\n\nAlso noteworthy is the rise of XRP, a cryptocurrency launched in 2012, which has recovered 20% since the beginning of the new year, with current prices above $0.40 per token, allowing it to climb back to 6th position in the overall crypto capitalization ranking.\n\nHowever, the company behind XRP, Ripple Labs, is engaged in a legal dispute with the US SEC, which is objecting to the XRP token as a security, and the final ruling is expected to be published in the coming weeks.\n\nFinally, the Aptos (APT) token deserves mention, which is putting up another triple-digit weekly rise, gaining more than 400% since the beginning of the year and earning the top spot among the month\u2019s best rises. The Aptos blockchain was created in 2021 by a team of former developers of the Diem project (a payment system devised by Facebook in 2019) who decided to leverage their experience in building a decentralized and easily scalable payment network.\n\nIn the last week, the price of APT rose above $20 for the first time. At the opening on 1 January, the price of APT was $3.4 per token.\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nDespite the slowdown in its rise, the price of BTC remains firmly above $22,500. Signal of possible consolidation that will have to find confirmation until early next week.\n\nIf confirmed, the current levels will become the basis of a valid support to be stored for the coming weeks while waiting to see again the $25,500, historical resistance level.\n\nOtherwise, the decline should not extend below $20,500 in order not to jeopardize the excellent work done since the beginning of the year.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nThe queen of altcoins fails to keep up with BTC and stumbles with prices returning below $1,600 in recent hours.\n\nIt is important for ETH to get through the weekend unscathed with prices above $1,500 otherwise the bullish technical structure that began in early January will deteriorate.\n\nThe holding of the $1,500 in the coming days of the week could become the springboard to overcome the $1,680, resistance that coincides with the recent highs and early November."

        "title": "Institutions Driving 85% Of Bitcoin Buying, Signals New Bull Market - Matrixport Report - TronWeekly",
        "content": "According to the January 27th report, financial services firm Matrixport claimed that institutional investors are showing no signs of giving up on cryptocurrency, with data suggesting as much as 85% of Bitcoin buying is coming from American institutional players.\n\nMarkus Thielen, the chief strategist at Matrixport, said that the evidence indicates that institutions are not staying away from crypto and that this could be a sign of a new crypto bull market on the horizon.\n\nReport Reveals Bitcoin Bullish Market Indicators\n\nThe report revealed insights on how to determine the popularity of digital assets among retail or institutional investors. The report suggests that by analyzing the performance of assets during specific trading hours, such as in the United States or Asia, it can be determined which group of investors is showing more interest.\n\nSpecifically, the report states that if an asset sees strong performance during U.S. trading hours, it is likely being purchased by U.S. institutions, while growth during Asian trading hours indicates a preference among Asian retail investors.\n\nThe report also notes that Bitcoin has seen a 40% increase this year, with 35% of those returns happening during U.S. trading hours, indicating that U.S. institutions are currently driving most of the buying interest.\n\nThe report states that institutions often begin investing in Bitcoin before other cryptocurrencies and that this trend could lead to the outperformance of other coins, particularly those on the first layer of blockchain technology and alternative coins.\n\nThe report also notes that the recent surge in cryptocurrency prices may have been sparked by positive news about other projects, such as Lido DAO and Aptos, but that the rally was solidified by the release of U.S. inflation data.\n\nAdditionally, the report notes that Ethereum is seeing strong performance during U.S. trading hours, potentially due to institutional investors, while Aptos is seeing strong returns during both U.S. and Asia trading hours. Overall, the report suggests that this trend is positive for the continued adoption of Bitcoin by institutions.\n\nHowever, according to the price analysis, As of now, CoinMarketcap\u2019s data shows that Bitcoin (BTC) is being traded at $22,980.98. The daily and weekly charts both appear to be positive, showing increases of 1.02% and 9.74%, respectively.\n\nRelated Reading | Lil Pudgys Tokens Break Ethereum Boundaries with Pudgy Penguins\u2019 LayerZero & soulTransport"
