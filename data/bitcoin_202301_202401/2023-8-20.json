        "content": "The crypto market was lower to start the week after bitcoin posted its worst week since May.\n\nBitcoin was higher by just 0.02% at the $26,136.36, according to Coin Metrics. Last week, it lost 11% due to a sharp decline that began Wednesday afternoon. Ether was lower by 0.18% at $1,674\n\nAltcoins were making bigger moves to the downside on Monday, however. Ripple's XRP slid nearly 5%. Coins tied to Ethereum competitors Solana , Polygon and Cardano lost about 3% each. DeFi tokens fell also. The Cosmos token lost more than 3% and Uniswap's coin was 2% lower.\n\n\"External pressure in China is likely the biggest driver to the sell-offs,\" said Chris Martin, head of research at Amberdata. \"Asia plays a huge role in crypto, especially with Hong Kong and Singapore opening the door, but with a wider economic downturn, I don't think we'll see the bull market play out like we hoped or expected.\""

        "content": "Bitcoin edged up on Monday morning in Asia to trade slightly above the US$26,000 support level, after sliding over 10% for the week. Ether also moved higher but remained below US$1,700 following last week\u2019s losses. Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. XRP led the winners, despite the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) moving to challenge a June court ruling in favor of Ripple Labs. Meanwhile, the Forkast 500 NFT index dropped as NFT marketplace OpenSea said it will stop enforcing creator royalties from August 31. U.S. stock futures traded flat after Wall Street logged weekly losses at close of trading Friday.\n\nBaby steps upward for cryptos after painful few days\n\nBitcoin edged up 0.28% in the last 24 hours to US$26,178.36 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, logging a weekly loss of 10.68%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency hit a two-month low of US$25,409.11 on Friday, but held position above the US$26,000 support level over the weekend.\n\nA cool-off of Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) hype in the U.S. could be behind the retreat of the token. That\u2019s the view of James Butterfill, head of research at European alternative asset manager CoinShares.\n\n\u201cThe surge in June, spurred by BlackRock\u2019s application for SEC approval of a Bitcoin ETF, led to a noticeable spike in prices,\u201d said Butterfill in a report released Friday.\n\n\u201cHowever, markets are now coming to terms with the realization that an immediate SEC approval for a Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. is unlikely. It\u2019s noteworthy that current Bitcoin prices have stabilized around levels observed before this announcement,\u201d he added.\n\nThe low volume and volatility in Bitcoin, a rise in U.S. treasury yields, as well as concerns over China\u2019s ailing economy contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s sharp weekly decline, the CoinShares report found.\n\n\u201cThe outlook for the markets in the forthcoming months presents a blend of opportunities and challenges. It\u2019s anticipated that the U.S. Federal Reserve will refrain from hiking rates further in September,\u201d Butterfill said.\n\nStory continues\n\nA dovish shift in Fed policy could provide a boost to Bitcoin\u2019s prospects, he added.\n\n\u201cOn the flip side, investors are eagerly awaiting the SEC\u2019s verdict on the Grayscale ETF and BlackRock applications in September. Anticipations are that decisions on both applications might be postponed, potentially leading to investor disappointment,\u201d Butterfly said.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, Ether moved up 0.85% to US$1,683.57 but remained 8.50% lower for the past seven days.\n\nThe U.S. SEC could approve several ETFs based on Ethereum futures by October 2023, Bloomberg reported on Friday citing unnamed sources. Investment firms Volatility Shares, Bitwise, Roundhill and ProShares have all applied for Ethereum ETF licenses.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed over the past 24 hours, but all posted weekly losses. Cryptocurrencies have seen a total liquidation of US$24.91 million in the past 24 hours.\n\nThat\u2019s a considerable decrease on the daily losses posted last week during a calamitous downturn in the crypto market. On Friday alone, traders liquidated over US$1 billion in cryptocurrencies, including US$851.94 million in long positions \u2014 positions where investors bet the cryptocurrency price will rise. On Monday, long position liquidations stood at US$6.89 million for the past 24 hours, according to data from crypto information platform CoinGlass.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP token led the winners, gaining 3.96% to US$0.5408 but plunged 13.76% for the week.\n\nIn the on-going legal battle between Ripple Labs and the SEC, Judge Analisa Torres on Thursday granted the SEC permission to appeal an earlier judgement in favor of Ripple Labs. That ruling in late June found that the technology firm\u2019s programmatic sales of XRP did not violate securities laws.\n\nIn a Saturday tweet, Ripple\u2019s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz said the SEC should not be allowed to appeal until the conclusion of the case. He said that, even if an appeal is granted, \u201cthe case should still continue and the appeal should run in parallel.\u201d\n\nYes. A party that loses on any claim or issue in their suit is entitled to appeal any adverse rulings at the conclusion of the suit. The SEC is asking for permission to appeal here because the suit is not complete yet for any party.\n\n\n\nYou can see why there would be a rule like\u2026 \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) August 18, 2023\n\nRipple will have until September 1 to respond to the SEC\u2019s appeal motion.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization edged up 0.45% in the past 24 hours to US$1.06 trillion, while trading volume fell 13.09% to US$21.67 billion.\n\nOpenSea NFT marketplace to stop enforcing creator royalties\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 1.08% in the past 24 hours to 2,327.91 as of 10:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, and fell 5.94% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum Polygon and Cardano NFT indexes also logged losses, while the index for Solana moved higher.\n\n\u201cThe catalyst for this (NFT index drop) was OpenSea\u2019s decision to get rid of royalties,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs, in a YouTube video uploaded Sunday.\n\nOpenSea, one of the world\u2019s largest NFT marketplaces, announced on Thursday it would stop enforcing creator royalty fees, making them optional. The change will take effect from August 31. The platform will continue to charge a 2.5% fee for every transaction.\n\n\u201c(The mandatory royalty fee on OpenSea) was meant to empower creators with greater control over their Web3 business models, but it required the buy-in of everyone in the Web3 ecosystem, and unfortunately that has not happened,\u201d wrote OpenSea in the announcement.\n\nOpenSea\u2019s move received criticism from commentators. In a tweet Friday, Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team and an investor in OpenSea, described the decision as a \u201chuge mistake\u201d that would hurt the industry.\n\nNot collecting and paying royalties on NFT sales is a HUGE mistake by @opensea. It diminished trust in the platform and hurts the industry. And I say this as an @opensea investor @DevinFinzer \u2014 Mark Cuban (@mcuban) August 18, 2023\n\nYuga Labs, the creator of NFT collection Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), responded to the news in a tweet Saturday saying it will gradually wind down its support for OpenSea. \u201cYuga believes in protecting creator royalties so creators are properly compensated for their work,\u201d the company said.\n\nOn @opensea's decision to sunset their Operator Filter. pic.twitter.com/ahc155WWkX \u2014 Yuga Labs (@yugalabs) August 18, 2023\n\n\u201cWhat I think will happen is they either reverse their decision, or Yuga Labs may end up launching their own NFT marketplace,\u201d said Forkast Labs\u2019 Petscher on Sunday. While the impact of the decision is only just being felt, he added, it will \u201cchange the landscape of NFTs.\u201d\n\nTotal NFT trading volume gained 15.60% in the past 24 hours to US$14.76 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volumes on the Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana and Polygon blockchains all logged increases, while Cardano\u2019s volume dipped.\n\nAmong NFT collections, Ethereum-based BAYC saw the largest 24-hour sales volume, which rose 45.30% to US$2.02 million. Mythos Chain-based DMarket and Polygon-based DraftKings ranked as the second and third largest collections by 24-hour trading volume.\n\nIn terms of single NFT sales, BAYC #8585 sold at over US$255,000 on Sunday, making it the most expensive NFT traded in the past 24 hours. However, its former holder purchased the NFT at over US$1 million in October 2022.\n\n\u201cThis seller took a huge loss on this NFT,\u201d said Petscher. \u201cThat explains the rising average sale price but also the declining profits.\u201d\n\nChina policy stimulus lacks punch\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures edged higher as of 11:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, after the three major U.S. indexes closed mixed on Friday and booked losses for the week.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes traded mixed on Friday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng logged losses, while South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei moved up.\n\nIn the U.S., investors await Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s opening speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday. The Fed\u2019s annual summit is attended by central bank leaders from across the world. Powell\u2019s speech could provide insights into the Fed\u2019s thinking on monetary policy.\n\n\u201cWe view the event as a good opportunity for Powell to start laying the ground for the next step in the Fed\u2019s policy guidance: no longer focused on how many hikes to expect, but rather on rates remaining \u2018higher for longer,'\u201d analysts at Canadian investment bank TD Securities said in a note viewed by Reuters.\n\nIn July, the Fed raised the interest rate to between 5.25% and 5.50% \u2014 the highest level since January 2001. Powell said in a statement following the decision that the U.S. central bank will \u201ctake a data-dependent approach\u201d in determining its future monetary policies. It did not indicate if there are more hikes in the cards or how long the Fed would keep up its tightening cycle.\n\nThe Fed meets on Sep. 19 to make its next move on interest rates. Analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predict a 11.5% chance for another 25-basis-point increase.\n\nU.S. data to watch in the week ahead includes U.S. chipmaker Nvidia\u2019s second-quarter earnings report, as well as S&P Global\u2019s purchasing manager indexes (PMI). Both are set for release Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile in China, the country\u2019s central bank cut its one-year loan prime rate (LPR) to 3.45% from 3.55% on Monday morning. However, it kept the five-year LPR unchanged at 4.2%, according to the state media Xinhua News Agency.\n\nThe stimulus measure was smaller than the analyst expectation of two 15-basis-point cuts to both the one-year and five-year rates. Commentators said China\u2019s central bank may need to act more decisively to soothe growing fears of a recession.\n\n\u201cUntil more forceful policy responses are made available to backstop the contagion risk, we believe Chinese stocks will settle in a lower trading range than we previously envisaged,\u201d Goldman equity strategists wrote in a note viewed by Bloomberg.\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"

        "content": "World domination was not on the menu at this year\u2019s Summit at Sea, an invite-only cruise that convenes a \u201cglobal community of entrepreneurs, academics, athletes, artists, astronauts,\u201d and beyond.\n\nRelative to its past self, the vibe at the once ambitious floating Davos for millennial technocrats was muted against a backdrop of broader anxiety gripping Silicon \u00adValley as it navigates uncertain waters. Even for a gathering long interested in wellness, there was a telling number of powdered elixirs in Summit\u2019s swag bags, as well as an awful lot of seminars focusing on mental health, spirituality, and psychedelics\u2014and in Palo Alto demand for hallucinogenic mushrooms, ketamine, and LSD is running high, as the likes of Sergey Brin and Elon Musk evangelize about their healing qualities.\n\n\u201cPeople are not feeling as bullish,\u201d says one regular, who described attendees as seeking a break from reality, not a platform to \u201caccelerate their supercharged rocket startup.\u201d Supercharging is less important right now than stress management through breath work.\n\nBeyond the comforts of Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Voyages Scarlet Lady, where Summit took place en route to the Bahamas, high and rising interest rates have battered the sector\u2019s stocks and wiped out multiple lenders, such as Silicon Valley Bank. Venture funds are raising a fraction of what they previously raked in, so the startups they bankroll have gone from being awash in cash to having to hunt for it.\n\nAnadolu Agency // Getty Images FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried leaves from Manhattan Federal Court after court appearance in New York, United States on June 15, 2023.\n\nThe hardest hit sector back on land has been crypto. Bitcoin has plummeted from its 2021 peak, largely devastating its flash-in-the-pan billionaire class. Over the course of the past year: The exchange FTX went bankrupt, and its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, and colleagues were charged with orchestrating one of the biggest financial frauds ever. Do Kwon, whose currency Luna once commanded a fan base of self-\u00addescribed \u201cLunatics\u201d before its failure contributed to the industry\u2019s $2 trillion face-plant in 2022, was charged with fraud by federal prosecutors and arrested in Monte\u00adnegro. The Securities and Exchange Commission slapped two of the biggest remaining crypto companies, Binance and Coinbase, with a slew of charges. And the market for NFTs has become a ghost town of lawsuits, expensive regrets, and few true believers.\n\n\u201cThe mania has died down,\u201d says Molly White, a fellow at the Harvard Library Innovation Lab and creator of the site Web3 Is Going Just Great, a Bonfire of the Vanities\u2013style chronicle of the tech industry\u2019s excesses and pitfalls. \u201cPeople don\u2019t tell me, \u2018Have fun staying poor\u2019 as much as they used to.\u201d\n\nCrypto\u2019s early adopters were never quite so gauche. Even new money has old money, and those who bought Bitcoin when prices were so low it was basically Monopoly bills are discreetly hunkering down to weather the slump without attracting the attention of skeptics like White or SEC chairman Gary Gensler, the Inspector Javert of crypto regulation. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, founders of the exchange Gemini, are more likely these days to Instagram a pizza party than an NFT of their moon-bound astronaut avatars, as in 2021.\n\nJoe Raedle // Getty Images Bitcoin bros Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss in 2021 at a crypto conference in Miami.\n\nBack then all bets were off. More tech startups were valued north of $1 billion in 2021 than in the prior five years put together. But this year venture funds in the U.S. have had a harder time raising money than they have in a decade, according to \u00adPitchBook-NVCA. So far in 2023 such funds have gathered less than $30 billion, putting them on track to raise less than $55 billion for the year\u2014compared with $168 billion last year. The future was virtual then, and profits were infinite. One Bitcoin was worth $65,000. A JPEG collage of smaller JPEGs sold for $69 million at Christie\u2019s. The voice-only app Clubhouse was valued at $4 billion and NFT marketplace OpenSea at $13.3 billion. Facebook rebranded as Meta and breathlessly described our \u00adavatar-rich, legless future. Everyone was always in Aspen, or joining a crypto colony in Puerto Rico; everyone quit their jobs and got better ones, for so much more money. As a financial journalist, I saw the worst minds of my generation rolling in far too much disposable income. It was so, so goofy. It was not fun staying poor.\n\nJulia Love, a crypto consultant, won a McLaren at a conference in Miami and wrapped it in cartoon shiba inus, the symbol of the Bitcoin offshoot Dogecoin. \u201cI thought it would just be, like, ha-ha,\u201d she says. \u201cI did not do it for attention.\u201d In much the same way that Saul Steinberg\u2019s 50th birthday party marked the end of the go-go \u201980s, with its let-them-eat-cake obliviousness, and Stephen A. Schwarzman\u2019s 60th top-ticked an overheated 2007, Love\u2019s stunt epitomized the frenzy of the moment.\n\nThen the price of Bitcoin plummeted, at one point falling below $16,000. Crypto\u2019s rabid era seems in retrospect to have been a harbinger of high inflation, which the Federal Reserve has since been working to cool by hiking interest rates. \u201cThere\u2019s always this group of what I would call startup groupie people, who start something at whatever the hype is,\u201d says Tarun Chitra, founder of the crypto cybersecurity company Gauntlet. \u201cYou can tell a bubble is forming if you start meeting those people.\u201d\n\nWin McNamee // Getty Images Securities and Exchange Commission Chairmain Gary Gensler, the Inspector Javert of crypto regulation.\n\nStill, there\u2019s a saying you hear whenever the market is down: Time to build. Within the crypto industry the mood is refusing to go quietly. Some are hanging on to their coins because it feels better than selling and accepting the loss; a slim chance of a rebound is better than no chance. Others have staked too much of their reputation and time on it. And others are partying like it\u2019s 1999 and the dot-com bubble hasn\u2019t yet burst. Just look at the way the conference circuit is oontz-oontz-oontzing still: the Medici conference in Los Angeles, the Bitcoin confab in Miami, ETHDenver, Consensus in Austin, and Chain\u00adalysis\u2019s Links Amsterdam. And then there was Summit at Sea. Before the ship weighed anchor in May, for the first time since 2016, there was talk of trouble selling all the tickets, which started around $5,000. Once it was at sea, though, the scene raged like a euphoric post-pandemic reunion\u2014or a deliriously fun game of musical deck chairs aboard the Titanic of tech.\n\n\u201cThis cruise has everything,\u201d executive coach Naveen Ghushe posted on Instagram, referencing Saturday Night Live\u2019s Stefon. \u201cImpact investors who have never had jobs. Psychedelic shamans who are addicted to Elf Bars. And life coaches who don\u2019t have a life.\u201d\n\nIt helped that Bitcoin was beginning to recover\u2014prices hovered close to $30,000 in July\u2014and tech enthusiasts saw a bright spot on the horizon, something on its way to becoming a silver bullet for the entrepreneurial class, a deus ex machina that would solve all its problems: artificial intelligence. \u201cThere\u2019s a stream of crypto influencers who have rebranded as AI influencers,\u201d says White.\n\nUncertainty lingers, though. Over the summer the Biden administration was considering restrictions on the export of AI chips, which walloped shares of Wall Street\u2019s favorite new stock, the semiconductor company Nvidia. And Sam Altman, whose OpenAI is under FTC investigation, has testified before Congress about the risks of the technology\u2014for the planet. Such a murky outlook requires breathing through it. At least there is some good news: Days after returning to shore, Summit announced it will again set sail in 2024.\n\nThis story appears in the September 2023 issue of Town & Country under the headline Silicon Valley at Sea.

        "title": "How to buy Bitcoin with Cash App - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Cash App, a multipurpose financial app, offers various capabilities, including money transfers, investment options and cryptocurrency purchases. Serving as a comprehensive financial tool, Cash App provides users the capacity to handle transactions, invest in stocks, and explore digital currencies like Bitcoin (BTC). The app aims to streamline financial tasks and assist users in navigating the modern financial landscape.\n\nWhat is Cash App?\n\nCash App, created by Block Inc (formerly Square Inc), is a peer-to-peer (P2P) mobile payment service offering stored value services resembling deposit accounts. This innovative platform empowers users to access financial services without incurring the standard fees that accompany traditional banks.\n\nAs a non-banking financial solution, Cash App enables individuals to transfer and receive money, pay bills, file taxes and invest in stocks, complemented by the convenience of debit cards. With a sizable user base of 51 million individuals, Cash App offers an alternative to buying and selling Bitcoin on crypto exchanges.\n\nThe app\u2019s expansion began in 2018, opening the doors to cryptocurrency transactions limited solely to Bitcoin and cementing its place as one of the prominent mobile payment apps available in the United Kingdom and the United States. Starting from 2023, Cash App users can conveniently monitor their Bitcoin transactions to streamline tax reporting using the TaxBit integration, simplifying the process of calculating taxes for BTC holdings.\n\nBuy Bitcoin with Cash App\n\nBefore initiating the process of purchasing Bitcoin through Cash App, several preliminary steps are essential to ensure a smooth experience. Firstly, install the Cash App and create an account. Then, link the Cash App account to a checking or bank account. Once this link is established, Bitcoin purchases can be made. Additional security verification may be needed to enable investment features of Cash App, including buying Bitcoin.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to be aware that Cash App only enables Bitcoin transactions, and its investing balances are not Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)- and Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS)-insured. However, there is limited Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) coverage of fiat investing balances. As you embark on the journey to buy Bitcoin on Cash App, remember these fundamental prerequisites for a hassle-free transaction process.\n\nSteps to buy Bitcoin on Cash App\n\nLaunch Cash App and log in to your account.\n\nEnsure that your Cash App account has sufficient funds. You can add money to your account using your linked debit or credit card or receiving direct deposits.\n\nTap on the \u201cInvesting\u201d section located at the bottom of the screen.\n\nLook for the \u201cBuy Bitcoin\u201d option and tap it to proceed.\n\nEnter the amount of Bitcoin you wish to purchase or use the slider to select a specific amount.\n\nEnter your PIN and review the transaction details, including the current BTC price and any applicable fees.\n\nTap the \u201cBuy\u201d button to confirm your instant Bitcoin purchase.\n\nAuto Invest Bitcoin on Cash App\n\nThe Auto Invest feature can be utilized on Cash App to schedule recurring Bitcoin purchases that correspond to one\u2019s preferences. By streamlining the accumulation of BTC over time, this function eliminates the necessity for manual transactions. This feature allows users to allocate a portion of their paycheck to Bitcoin consistently and spread out Bitcoin purchases to mitigate price fluctuations.\n\nSteps to set up Auto Invest on Cash App:\n\nAccess the \u201cBitcoin Investing\u201d screen and tap \u201cBuy.\u201d\n\nClick the drop-down menu labeled \u201cChange Order Type.\u201d\n\nChoose a frequency \u2014 daily, weekly or every two weeks \u2014 and tap \u201cDone.\u201d\n\nOpt for a preset amount or customize by tapping \u201c...\u201d and entering your desired amount.\n\nPress \u201cNext,\u201d keeping in mind that there\u2019s a $10 minimum for Auto Invest purchases.\n\nConfirm your selection to set up automatic investments.\n\nCash App fees for purchasing Bitcoin\n\nCash App may impose fees for Bitcoin transactions depending on transaction size, and the current mid-market price of Bitcoin will apply to the purchase. The app also includes a spread, resulting in paying slightly more than the market value for the Bitcoin or selling slightly below market value.\n\nThe margin may differ when purchasing Bitcoin using Cash App compared to selling it. The margin and prices can also vary from what is advertised on other marketplaces.\n\nDuring transactions with Bitcoin, Cash App will impose two types of fees: One of them is the service fee, and the other is an extra fee based on the price volatility across exchanges in the United States. The fees will appear on the confirmation of the trade before completing the transaction. In this way, if there is a disagreement with the final price, the option not to proceed is available.\n\nWho can buy Bitcoin with Cash App?\n\nTo buy Bitcoin on Cash App, users must fulfill specific requirements. To use the application, a person needs to be at least 18 years old and over the age of maturity in their residence state. Additionally, they must be individuals, not businesses or other entities, and use the service for personal use only. Cash App is available in the U.K. and the U.S., and all 50 U.S. states can access the platform to purchase Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, complete anonymity might not always be attainable. Certain government-issued or digital currency transfers may request users to provide personal information, such as their name, phone number, address, taxpayer identification number, birth date, email, government identification number and bank account details. Additionally, users may also be asked to disclose their money source and employment information.\n\nGet Bitcoin with Cash app via Bitcoin Boost\n\nAnother way to get Bitcoin on Cash App is to earn it. The Bitcoin Boost function enables you to accumulate Bitcoin with each Cash Card transaction. Upon selecting a Bitcoin Boost and purchasing a Cash Card, the earned Bitcoin is automatically added to your Bitcoin balance.\n\nSteps to implement a Cash app Bitcoin Boost\n\nAccess the \u201cCash Card\u201d tab on your home screen.\n\nTap \u201cSave with Boost,\u201d choose a Boost and then click to add Boost.\n\nCash App does not charge any fees on Bitcoin Boost. For transaction-specific Bitcoin earnings, refer to your \u201cActivity\u201d tab and tap the relevant Cash Card transaction.\n\nSecurity and safety measures offered by Cash app\n\nCash App complies with PCI Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) Level 1, the highest security compliance standard for merchants that accept payments. As a user, this implies that your data is secured and encrypted.\n\nWhile Cash App provides a convenient way to buy Bitcoin, it\u2019s essential to prioritize security. Consider implementing two-factor authentication (2FA) and using a robust and unique password for your account to protect your Bitcoin wallet and transactions.\n\nBy enabling 2FA, requiring a PIN to transfer cash and activating alerts for account activity, you may increase the security of your Cash App account. If your card is lost or stolen, it\u2019s possible to deactivate it to prevent fraudulent charges. Also, avoid sharing sensitive information with anyone and be cautious of potential scams related to cryptocurrency purchases.\n\nDrawbacks to buying Bitcoin via Cash App\n\nWhile Cash App provides an alternative platform to buying Bitcoin, there are some drawbacks to consider. Firstly, if you are an investor interested in diversifying your crypto portfolio beyond Bitcoin, Cash App falls short, as it only offers the option to buy Bitcoin and does not support other cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional brokers, Cash App\u2019s investment options are limited, restricting your ability to explore various digital assets.\n\nMoreover, it is essential to note that, unlike traditional banks, Cash App\u2019s Bitcoin and investing balances are not insured by the FDIC or FSCS. This means that your funds held within the app are not protected in the same way as they would be in a bank account. However, investing balances may be covered by SIPC in some cases. Also, in the U.S., Cash Card offers your account benefits from FDIC coverage, ensuring security for up to $250,000 of your Cash App account balance.\n\nTherefore, exploring dedicated crypto exchanges may be more suitable for investors seeking a more comprehensive range of investment options and the security of FDIC insurance."

        "content": "Jacobi Asset Management\u2019s decision to launch a spot bitcoin ETF on Euronext Amsterdam this week has proved to be a stroke of marketing genius amid the ongoing heated debate in the US.\n\nThe Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF (BCOIN) is listed on Euronext Amsterdam and regulated by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC), which changed its rules to approve the structure in October 2021.\n\nIt is important to note that only professional investors in the UK and Netherlands with over $100,000 can access the bitcoin ETF, which is an alternative investment fund (AIF), and it will not enjoy the same distribution rules as other UCITS ETFs or exchange-traded products (ETPs).\n\n\u201cGuernsey is offshore so not as tightly regulated as the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) or Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF) but it has a strong history in financial services,\u201d Shane Coveney, partner at Dillon Eustace, told ETF Stream.\n\n\u201cIt is not a UCITS product but an AIF so professional investors will get direct exposure to spot bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHowever, this has not halted the deluge of media coverage over the past few days highlighting how Europe beat the US in launching the first spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nLast week, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) again delayed its decision to approve or reject a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s move to file for a spot bitcoin ETF in June led many industry commentators to predict the US regulator would greenlight the structure, however, investors must continue to wait.\n\nUS investors can only currently invest in bitcoin futures ETFs while European investors, in contrast, have been able to access spot bitcoin via exchange-traded notes (ETNs) since 2018.\n\n\u201cIt is exciting to see Europe moving ahead of the US in opening up bitcoin investing for institutional investors who want access to the benefits of digital assets,\u201d Martin Bednall, CEO of Jacobi Asset Management, said.\n\n\u201cUnlike other products in the European market which are debt instruments, our fund owns the underlying assets directly.\u201d\n\nThe announcement of the launch last year sparked a war of words between many crypto ETP issuers in Europe who warned the structure was created solely in order to gain a \u201cPR advantage\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is all a marketing ploy which plays off of the whole US saga,\u201d Townsend Lansing, head of product at CoinShares, told ETF Stream. \u201cThe Jacobi product is an AIF and therefore not available for general public distribution.\n\n\u201cThere is a reason why issuers do not select this product structure \u2013 whether for crypto or other ineligible assets such as gold. It does not offer any meaningful benefits, has limited chance of proper liquidity and is very difficult to distribute.\u201d\n\nHowever, Bednall said the AIF structure is a \u201cbetter product with greater investor protection\u201d.\n\n\u201cInvestors are free to choose between the different product structures, but, all else being equal, I know the majority would always choose a fund over a note,\u201d he added.\n\nJacobi AM\u2019s launch has certainly created a lot of media hype but time will tell whether its ETF will be a success. As always, investors will vote with their assets."

        "content": "Bitcoin's back to its volatile ways after its big move down late last week \u2014 but not for the reason investors expected. Volatility has been a defining characteristic of bitcoin in both positive and negative ways, but it's been almost completely absent from the market for several weeks. That was, until Thursday night, when the cryptocurrency suddenly tumbled as much as 9% . Aside from the mismanaged crypto lenders (and FTX) that plagued the crypto market in 2022, the Federal Reserve's inflation-fighting rate hiking campaign played a big part in bitcoin's downward price pressure. Though investors had started to think the Fed was done with rate hikes for the rest of this year, the minutes of the latest FOMC meeting released Wednesday showed central bank sees \"upside risks\" to inflation that could lead to more increases. That's when bitcoin's decline really began, and the volatility could linger, according to Mark Connors, head of research at Canadian investment fund manager 3iQ. \"The volatility will have a persistence if we're going to stay here at an elevated real rate environment,\" he told CNBC. \"We're not surprised when we see a stepwise function in yields, 25 basis points in a month to 4.25% on the 10-year \u2013 the highest in the long time. Mortgage rates are higher, the next hanging chads to drop is credit risk defaults.\" BTC.CM= 5D mountain Bitcoin (BTC) began falling after the July FOMC meeting minutes were released Wednesday. Market observers typically monitor where the benchmark fed funds rate is hovering, but \"real rates\" account for the difference between nominal rates and inflation indicators. Even if the Fed doesn't raise interest rates anymore, the crypto space seems more focused now on real rates and keeping them elevated to fight inflation. \"These are just normal developments that happen when we're stepping into a new rate regime,\" he said. \"This isn't like bad behavior from last year. The centralized, unregistered, unregulated bad actors and fraudsters hiding offshore entities \u2013 that was last year.\" A 'healthy bloodletting' Investors expected volatility would return when regulatory headwinds turned into tailwinds \u2014 by seeing an SEC-approved spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund or clear crypto legislation enacted in Congress. That would also usher in the return of liquidity, which left the market after the banking crisis in the spring, and help create a better functioning market. \"This is a healthy bloodletting of some of the active trade management and a reminder that we don't have liquidity and of why we need regulation,\" Connors said. \"We need to have more active engaged market makers in this space to absorb and provide liquidity with guidance from developed markets like the U.S.\" Crypto needs regulatory clarity so institutional buyers can own crypto assets, Connors explained, likening the situation to high-yield debt in the 1980s: It's still a core holding even though it had its own notorious bad actors that've gone away. \"The market and institutions own it. It's a stable market because you have long bias market,\" he said. \"If we get clarity \u2026 and we get the ability of institutions to just buy \u2026 then when you get these downdrafts of 10% or 15%, institutions won't rebalance their 1% to 2% holdings in bitcoin against equities, they'll add more.\" \"When Bitcoin goes up \u2026 there'll be selling into people buying it. That's a healthy ecosystem,\" he added. Having institutions with an established long core holding would act as a stabilizing force for Bitcoin, Connors added. But currently, institutions are one the sidelines until they get clarity from regulators on how they can bring crypto into their business. That's why this summer's bitcoin ETF filings from BlackRock, Fidelity and other institutions are so critical. \"Until this gets settled, capital can't go into the space to help provide that shock absorption,\" Connors said. \u2014CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed reporting."

        "title": "Bitcoin spot ETF: What are the odds of approval? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Questions are swirling about whether or not the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot bitcoin ETF (BTC-USD). Yahoo Finance Crypto Reporter David Hollerith explains that eight companies have filed for approval since BlackRock (BLK) did so back in June. Hollerith explains the situation, stating \"The SEC has several opportunities from here to either approve, deny or push off approval for these applications.\" Hollerith notes that many argue that Bitcoin is \"not regulated enough and too manipulatable\" as reasons for pushback against the potential spot ETF.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, a lot of speculation has surrounded the chances of a Bitcoin spot ETF being approved, given how much scrutiny the sector is feeling from regulators. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith to discuss this more. David, we know that-- we've been hearing a lot about the potential for this, but not seeing any companies quite make it to the finish line just yet.\n\nDAVID HOLLERITH: Hey, Rachelle. Since BlackRock's filing, which happened earlier this summer, there's been eight other companies who've refiled applications to list a spot Bitcoin ETF, and that's included ARK Invest, Bitwise, VanEck, WisdomTree, and Invesco.\n\nAnd now, the SEC has several opportunities from here to either approve, deny, or simply push off approval for these applications. They can't push off approval after six months from now. That's when we'll have a definite decision about whether or not the agency would be OK with listing these products.\n\nBut that being said, earlier this month, ARK Invest application was pushed off approval, and the deadline for these other applications from the other asset managers are coming at the beginning of September. And John Reed Stark, who is a former attorney for the SEC's enforcement division, weighed in on this at the beginning of-- or excuse me, the end of last week. And he had said, he puts the chances at slim to none.\n\nStory continues\n\nStark, obviously having worked for the agency, does know a lot about the enforcement division, and his thoughts are that the Bitcoin spot market is too-- it's a little bit too not regulated enough and a little bit too manipulable, which has been the argument in past years for a why there's been no approval.\n\nBut a lot of people have really come out around the BlackRock filing. And Bloomberg's ETF team-- Bloomberg Intelligence's ETF team, which has been more bullish on the prospects of approval in the coming six months has said, the question is really what could BlackRock know that these other filers didn't know at the time?\n\nThey added a surveillance sharing agreement, which has been taken as a new addition to this. And potentially, people have said that might be what will make the change for the SEC to approve it. But at this point, it is still pretty unclear about how things could go. We're looking at the Grayscale lawsuit with the SEC, which we're expecting a verdict on any week now. And that's expected usually on a Tuesday or a Friday is when these verdicts come out.\n\nAnd obviously, Grayscale is trying to convert their GBTC product into an ETF. And that's been a long battle. So we could see some more clarity into the SEC's thinking with that verdict or at least with what they have to do next, depending on the judge's interpretations. But we're not expecting it to be a clear path for ETFs either, given that the verdict could mean a few different things.\n\nBut that being said, Bloomberg's team, which again, I said, has been a little bit more bullish, has said the odds of a Bitcoin spot ETF, they've placed it at around 65% at this point. So that's much better than it was before BlackRock filed for the product.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, you figure if BlackRock can't make it, what chance does some of these smaller companies have indeed? But thank you for getting us up to speed. And we will be taking a look at those enforcement actions as well. Our very own David Hollerith. Thanks so much."

        "title": "Global Central Banks' Take on Bitcoin: Mixed Signals Abound - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "In the middle of the continuing fintech revolution, Bitcoin, the pioneering cryptocurrency, has caught the global financial community's fascination as well as anxiety. As the digital currency's popularity grows, central banks throughout the world are struggling with its ramifications, generating a variety of responses that reflect a landscape of contradictory signals.\n\nThe Bitcoin Evolution\n\nBitcoin has evolved from a fringe digital curiosity to a mainstream asset that occupies the attention of governments, organizations, and individual investors since its birth in 2009. Because of its decentralized structure, borderless transactions, and ability to disrupt traditional banking, Bitcoin is both a revolutionary technology and a source of worry.\n\nA Global Overview of Diverse Approaches\n\nCentral banks all across the world are looking at Bitcoin with a mix of interest, skepticism, and regulatory anxiety. These techniques represent the tangled web of technology, finance, and the regulatory structures that govern them.\n\nPositive Attitude: Possibilities and Innovation\n\nSome central banks see Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as symbols of technical development and creativity. They recognize the potential benefits of blockchain technology, which serves as the underlying infrastructure for cryptocurrencies, in improving financial efficiency and security. These financial institutions are investigating how blockchain might be used to speed payment systems, cut transaction costs, and increase transparency.\n\nPragmatic Regulation: Balancing Risk and Innovation\n\nOther central banks have taken a more cautious approach, focusing on regulatory frameworks that balance innovation and risk management. They recognize the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies while highlighting the importance of protecting consumers, ensuring market integrity, and preventing illegal activity such as money laundering and fraud. This strategy aims to capitalize on the beneficial characteristics of cryptocurrencies while limiting any negative implications.\n\nConcerns and Skepticism: Volatility and Stability\n\nCentral banks are concerned about Bitcoin's extraordinary price volatility. Bitcoin's volatile pricing makes it difficult to utilize it as a steady medium of exchange or a reliable store of wealth. This volatility can pose investment risks and impede its acceptance as a mainstream currency.\n\nFinancial Stability and Monetary Policy\n\nCentral banks are responsible for monetary policy and financial stability. Because of its decentralized design and limited supply, Bitcoin is impervious to standard monetary policy tools such as interest rate changes. This independence raises concerns about how central banks will govern their economies if Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies become popular.\n\nRegulatory Difficulties: A Global Patchwork\n\nThe global regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is anything but uniform. Central banks are navigating a wide range of legal and regulatory environments, from those that encourage cryptocurrency use to those that explicitly prohibit it. This hodgepodge of legislation makes cross-border commerce, international cooperation, and regulatory harmonization difficult.\n\nCentral Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are digital currencies issued by central banks.\n\nCentral banks are also investigating Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), which are digital representations of a country's national currency. The goal of CBDCs is to combine the efficiency of digital transactions with the stability and regulatory oversight provided by central banks. CBDCs, while not the same as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, have the potential to revolutionize the digital payments ecosystem.\n\nChina's Leadership in CBDCs\n\nChina has assumed a leading role in the CBDC space, piloting the digital yuan in multiple places. The digital yuan, also known as Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP), is a government-backed program aiming at increasing financial inclusion, lowering transaction costs, and consolidating the central bank's control over the monetary system.\n\nChina is \u201cleading the way\u201d when it comes to CBDCs, says Crypto Council for Innovation's Yaya Fanusie.\n\n\n\nHe speaks with @kaileyleinz on \u201cBloomberg Crypto\u201d https://t.co/ipX3d51wnU pic.twitter.com/Yqc5N0HoOp \u2014 Bloomberg TV (@BloombergTV) February 28, 2023\n\nThe Broader Consequences\n\nThe central banks' position on Bitcoin extends beyond the digital currency itself, touching on basic issues like as the future of money, financial stability, and the function of central banks in the digital era.\n\nThe Clash of Titans: Are CBDCs and BTC on a Collision Course?\n\nThe emergence of CBDCs is poised to reshape the landscape of digital finance, setting the stage for a potential showdown with the reigning titan of the cryptocurrency world, Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nCBDCs carry the weight of government backing and regulatory frameworks. Their introduction promises increased financial inclusion, streamlined transactions, and enhanced transparency. As governments worldwide explore CBDC implementation, they hold the potential to establish a more controlled and regulated digital currency ecosystem.\n\nOn the opposing side stands Bitcoin, the pioneer and poster child of decentralized cryptocurrencies. With its fixed supply, borderless nature, and independence from traditional financial systems, Bitcoin has earned the loyalty of a dedicated global community. Its unique attributes have positioned it as a store of value, an inflation hedge, and a hedge against traditional market volatility.\n\nThe impending clash between CBDCs and BTC revolves around centralization versus decentralization. CBDCs operate within existing financial frameworks, offering governments greater control over monetary policies and transactions. In contrast, Bitcoin's decentralized nature promotes financial autonomy and privacy, but also poses regulatory challenges.\n\nThe outcome of this clash remains uncertain. CBDCs possess the advantages of legitimacy and government backing, likely appealing to mainstream users and institutional investors. However, BTC's core value proposition lies in its independence from centralized control, making it a beacon for those who value financial sovereignty.\n\nAs both CBDCs and BTC continue to evolve, they could coexist as parallel options in the digital finance arena, catering to distinct preferences. Yet, the competition for dominance could intensify as governments seek to exert control over the digital financial landscape while Bitcoin loyalists advocate for decentralized freedoms.\n\nThe battle between CBDCs and BTC epitomizes the broader tension between centralized authority and decentralized innovation. Whether they converge, collaborate, or collide, their interaction will significantly influence the future of money, finance, and the very concept of value in our increasingly digital world.\n\nThe Transformation of Financial Landscapes\n\nThe rise of Bitcoin has compelled central banks to reconsider their duties and how they engage with traditional financial systems. The potential for digital currencies to transform payment systems, cross-border transactions, and government-citizen relationships is leading central banks to rethink how they can adapt and innovate.\n\nStandardization and global cooperation\n\nBecause cryptocurrencies are decentralized, global cooperation and regulatory standardization have become more difficult. Collaboration is essential for establishing standard policies that protect consumers, prohibit illegal activity, and facilitate cross-border trade. To ensure a peaceful and efficient global financial ecosystem, central banks must negotiate this problem.\n\nConclusion: An Exciting Journey Ahead\n\nThe worldwide central banking community's reaction to Bitcoin is varied, reflecting the many factors that go into welcoming innovation while maintaining stability. Central banks will continue to evolve their posture as the world grapples with the ramifications of digital currencies and blockchain technology, reacting to the dynamic interplay of technological breakthroughs, regulatory imperatives, and the ever-changing financial landscape.\n\nThe road ahead is fraught with uncertainty, but it also has the promise of reshaping finance for the better, ushering in a new era of digital innovation and financial inclusivity."

        "title": "Bitcoin recovers after falling below $26,000 as the ETF excitement bubble bursts - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin stabilized Tuesday morning in Asia after dropping below the key US$26,000 support level overnight. Ether also dipped but held the US$1,600 mark. All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded flat to lower, with Polygon\u2019s Matic leading the losers. Alternative asset manager CoinShares reported a US$55 million outflow in digital asset investment products last week. Analysts say disappointment from the stalemate on U.S. Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications has impacted sentiment. Meanwhile, the Forkast 500 NFT index continued its downward slide in the wake of NFT marketplace OpenSea\u2019s decision to stop enforcing creator royalties. U.S. stock futures traded lower after Wall Street closed mixed on Monday.\n\nETF logjam and low liquidity damaging sentiment\n\nBitcoin dipped 0.10% in the last 24 hours to US$26,133.35 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, expanding its weekly loss of 11.12%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency dropped to a low of US$25,846.09 just after midnight, but rallied to reclaim US$26,000 as the night progressed.\n\n\u201cAs the beginning of the week turned positive for traditional markets, crypto markets seem to \u2014 for now \u2014 be back in stagnation mode,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of Asia-Pacific business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock.\n\n\u201cMany investors were understandably spooked by last week\u2019s rapid rise in volatility and the subsequent price fall, which now means that a positive mood will only be just enough to keep crypto markets where they are.\u201d\n\nFor some analysts, last week\u2019s rapid decline in the price of Bitcoin is a correction for price increases since June caused by ETF hype in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe recent turmoil led BTC price to trading levels that mirror the ones preceding the Blackrock filing for their BTC Spot ETF,\u201d Matteo Greco, research analyst at Canada-based digital asset investment firm Fineqia International, said in an emailed note.\n\n\u201cThe fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) which lasted a few weeks after the filing seems to be now disappeared, waiting for news on the matter,\u201d Greco added.\n\nStory continues\n\nLow liquidity in the crypto market also contributed to last week\u2019s slide. Limited trading volume is driving market makers \u2014 which typically absorb sudden fluctuations in supply and demand and help provide a more predictable trading environment \u2014 to wind down their activities and wait for a better time to fully resume operations.\n\nGSR Markets, described by Greco as \u201cone of the most important market makers,\u201d has recently gone through two rounds of layoffs in response to worsening market conditions. Greco pointed out that before GSR, influential market makers Jane Street and Jump took similar actions citing difficulties with the state of the market.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, Ether dropped 0.84% to US$1,667.73 and moved down 9.55% for the past seven days.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded lower over the past 24 hours. Polygon\u2019s Matic token led the losers. It dropped 3.53% to US$0.5589 for a weekly loss of 17.81%.\n\nDigital asset investment products saw an outflow of US$55 million in the week ending August 18. That followed a US$29 million inflow the previous week, according to a CoinShares report released Monday.\n\n\u201cWe believe this is in reaction to recent media highlighting that a decision by the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission in allowing a U.S. spot-based ETF is not imminent,\u201d the company wrote in the report.\n\nBitcoin-linked investment products saw the majority of last week\u2019s outflow, totaling US$42 million. Ethereum, Polygon, Litecoin and Polkadot also recorded outflows, while XRP-linked inflows totaled US$1.2 million.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dipped 0.62% in the past 24 hours to US$1.05 trillion, while trading volume rose 35.31% to US$29.31 billion.\n\nNFT marketplace Recur to shut down\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 0.41% in the past 24 hours to 2,319.54 as of 10:10 a.m. in Hong Kong, falling 6.69% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum Solana and Cardano NFT indexes also logged losses, while the Polygon index moved higher.\n\n\u201cThe Forkast 500 NFT Index reflects a tremendous loss of value this year which has accelerated this week following OpenSea\u2019s announcement that they\u2019re moving away from forced royalties,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs.\n\nOpenSea, one of the world\u2019s largest NFT marketplaces, announced last week it will stop enforcing creator royalty fees from August 31, but will continue to charge a 2.5% fee for every transaction.\n\n\u201cYuga Labs, Animoca, and even Mark Cuban came out with statements calling the move a mistake for the digital economy and creators. Sentiment may be at a low point this year now and as one might expect, prices are tumbling,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nThe average NFT sales price in the week ending August 20 dropped to US$26.26, the lowest since August 2020 and down over 78% from the start of the year, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\n\u201cNow the flipside is that NFT transactions hit an all time high last week,\u201d said Petscher. Participation matters a lot to me, and seeing 3,702,180 transactions tells me NFTs have reached a new height.\u201d\n\nAmid rising transactions and sliding prices, sellers posted about US$9.5 million in losses last week, CryptoSlam data shows.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume edged up 0.49% in the past 24 hours to US$13.60 million. Volumes on the Ethereum, BNB Chain and Cardano blockchains logged increases, while the Solana, Polygon and Bitcoin volumes dropped.\n\nAmong NFT collections, Ethereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club saw the largest 24-hour sales volume. It rose 60.15% to over US$2.04 million. Mythos Chain-based DMarket and Ethereum-based Mutant Ape Yacht Club ranked as the second and third largest collections by 24-hour trading volume.\n\nElsewhere, NFT marketplace Recur announced on Saturday it would gradually shut down by November 16.\n\nToday, with heavy hearts, we must share some difficult news.\n\n\n\nAfter much contemplation and consideration, we\u2019ve decided to deprecate the RECUR platform, effective November 16, 2023.\n\n\n\nLearn more: https://t.co/5NbiTQSAGo \u2014 RECUR (@RecurForever) August 18, 2023\n\nThe decision came less than two years after a US$50 million funding round investment raised the platform\u2019s valuation to US$333 million.\n\n\u201cUnforeseen challenges and shifts in the business landscape have made it increasingly difficult for us to continue providing the level of service and dedication that we have always strived to maintain,\u201d said Recur in a Twitter thread on Saturday.\n\nAll eyes on Nvidia\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading lower as of 11:20 a.m. in Hong Kong. The three major U.S. indexes closed mixed at the end of regular session trading Monday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite logging gains, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average booked losses.\n\nMain stock indexes across Asia were mixed on Tuesday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index dipped, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei logged gains.\n\nAI chipmaker Nvidia spearheaded a rally in the technology sector on Monday. The U.S. tech giant posted gains of 8.5% after HSBC raised its price target for the U.S. firm\u2019s stock to US$780, the second highest on Wall Street.\n\nNvidia \u2014 whose share price has surged three times higher since the start of the year on the back of booming interest in artificial intelligence \u2014 will release its second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been covering tech since 1994 and I have never seen an environment where you are so dependent on one company to deliver,\u201d Inge Heydorn, partner at investment firm GP Bullhound, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cAI is really the last pillar of growth and everybody is depending on it. If Nvidia shows weakness, we could be in for quite a substantial correction in the market,\u201d Bullhound added.\n\nMeanwhile, investors await U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s opening speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday. The Fed-held annual summit will be attended by central bank leaders from across the world. Powell\u2019s speech could provide insights into the Fed\u2019s thinking on monetary policy.\n\n\u201cThe Fed and investors will soon pivot from a focus on how high the policy rate will go to a concern about how long they will stay at that level \u2014 and what the implications are for a \u2018higher for longer\u2019 scenario,\u201d Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at financial services firm Northern Trust, told Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cIn our view, Powell will want to stay on message, and will try to push back against a growing market consensus that rate cuts are on the 2024 horizon,\u201d said Nixon.\n\nThe U.S. interest rate currently sits between 5.25% and 5.50%, the highest level in the past 22 years. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 15.5% chance for a 25-basis-point rate hike at the Fed\u2019s next meeting in September, up from 11.5% on Monday.\n\nIn China, investors are assessing Beijing\u2019s latest round of policy stimulus. Analysts suspect Monday\u2019s smaller-than-expected interest rate cut by the central bank may not be enough to stop a slide toward recession.\n\n\u201cThe small injection of stimulus by China\u2019s central bank in the ailing economy has proved largely underwhelming given the scale of the challenges erupting across sectors, but it has given investors hope there could be more to come,\u201d Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at U.K.-based financial service firm Hargreaves Lansdown, told Reuters.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

Its counterpart is the long-term holder (LTH), more widely referred to as a classic \u201chodler.\u201d\n\n\u201cOut of the 2.56M BTC held by STHs, only 300k BTC (11.7%) is still in profit,\u201d the research states.\n\nBitcoin STH supply profit and loss chart (screenshot). Source: Glassnode\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, the overall share of the BTC supply in the hands of STHs is at multiyear lows. That said, the past week has dramatically reshaped profitability among the cohort, which previously functioned as a framework for the BTC trading range.\n\nThe STH aggregate breakeven point, known as realized price, currently sits above $28,500.\n\nBitcoin STH/LTH cost basis (realized price) chart.

        "title": "Hashed Timelock Contract (HTLC): Overview and Examples in Crypto - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is a Hashed Timelock Contract (HTLC)?\n\nA hashed timelock contract (HTLC) is a type of smart contract used in blockchain applications. It reduces counterparty risk by creating a time-based escrow that requires a cryptographic passphrase for unlocking.\n\nIn practical terms, this means that the person receiving the funds in a transaction has to perform two actions to access the funds: enter the correct passphrase and claim payment within a specific timeframe. If they enter an incorrect passphrase or do not claim the funds within the timeframe, they lose access to the payment.\n\nKey Takeaways A hashed timelock contract (HTLC) reduces counterparty risk in decentralized smart contracts by effectively creating a time-based escrow that utilizes a cryptographic passphrase.\n\nThis type of smart contract requires the receiver of a payment to acknowledge it within a certain period of time or forfeit it.\n\nPayments using HTLCs are conditional and so have efficiency benefits for blockchain transactions. This property makes HTLCs a fundamental tool used by the lightning network.\n\nUnderstanding Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLCs)\n\nA Hashed Timelock Contract (HTLC) uses several elements from existing cryptocurrency transactions. For example, HTLC transactions use multiple signatures consisting of a private and public key to verify and validate transactions. However, two elements distinguish HTLC from standard cryptocurrency transactions with smart contracts\u2014the hashlock and the time contract.\n\nHashlock\n\nThe first element is the hashlock. A hashlock is a hashed\u2014or cryptographically scrambled\u2014version of a public key generated by the person that initiated the transaction. The associated private key is then used to unlock the original hash.\n\nIn HTLC, the initiating party generates a key and hashes it. The hash is stored in a pre-image, which is revealed during the final transaction. HTLCs are programmed to expire after a certain period passes or a specific number of blocks are generated, creating a known termination date and time.\n\nTo conduct a transaction using HTLC, both parties need to open channels with each other. This is generally done using a wallet, an exchange, or both.\n\nTimelock\n\nThe second important element of HTLC is a timelock. Two different timelocks are used to set time constraints on contracts generated using HTLC. The first one is CheckLockTimeVerify (CLTV). It uses a time base to lock and release cryptocurrency. This means that time constraints are hardcoded, and coins are released only at a specific time and date or a specific height of block size.\n\nAtomic swaps\u2014cross-chain trading between cryptocurrencies\u2014 are often achieved using HTLCs. Additionally, Bitcoin\u2019s lightning network (LN) also employs HTLCs.\n\n\n\nThe second one is CheckSequenceVerify (CSV). It is not dependent on time; instead, it uses the number of blocks generated as a tracking measure to determine when to finalize a transaction.\n\nThe Process in a Hashed Timelock Contract\n\nSuppose Alice wants to exchange her Bitcoin for Litecoin from Bob. A typical HTLC transaction between them takes place as follows:\n\nAlice generates a hash from her Litecoin private key and sends it to Bob. She also generates a pre-image of the hash by creating a nominal transaction. This pre-image will help her validate and finalize the transaction. Bob also generates a hash from his key and sends it to Alice. In addition to this, he creates a pre-image by conducting a nominal transaction (in Litecoin). Once Alice receives Bob\u2019s Litecoin transaction, she signs it using the original key that is already available with her in the pre-image. Bob does likewise on his end, using his private key to unlock Alice\u2019s transaction. Once Alice and Bob enter their keys and agree to the transaction, the smart contract executes it. Neither can change the transaction once it executes, which removes the possibility that one could trick the other by quickly canceling the exchange.\n\nWhat Is a Timelock Contract? A timelock contract is a smart contract embedded in a blockchain that executes a transaction at a specific time. They are used in hashed timelock contracts and payment channels where specific payment times are needed.\n\nDoes Bitcoin Have Smart Contracts? Initially, Bitcoin's blockchain was not able to execute smart contracts. However, the Taproot upgrade in 2021 allowed the blockchain to use smart contracts in transactions.\n\nWhat Is a Smart Contract? A smart contract is a program stored on a blockchain that executes when specific conditions are met.\n\nHow Much Does a Smart Contract Cost? On the Ethereum blockchain, a smart contract deployment takes gas, which costs Gwei (a lower denomination of ether). Depending on the complexity of the contract, it can cost billions of Gwei to deploy a smart contract. Less complex contracts like a simple exchange are much cheaper.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (\u201cICOs\u201d) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

Through Bitcoin Standard BRC-69 & Recursive Inscriptions, Ordinals aims to empower developers on the chain to develop programs and databases to enable decentralized data storage and application.\n\n\u201cRecursive Inscriptions\u201d refers to the ability to utilize code within a block that may summon code from adjacent blocks on the chain. Blocks provide 4 Megabytes of storage, which would not normally provide ample space for developers to save code for complex programs.\n\nOrdinal developers mitigate the issue through recursive inscriptions, allowing developers to link data saved on multiple blocks, enabling the development of complex programs, such as AA games, on the chain.\n\nWTF are recursive inscriptions?

        "title": "Renewable energy Bitcoin mining company powers up in Sweden - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Sweden has welcomed a hydro-powered Bitcoin (BTC) mining data center.\n\nGenesis Digital Assets Limited (GDA), a mining and data center company with over 400 megawatts (MW) of power generation worldwide, has opened a new data center in Sweden, driven by the country\u2019s burgeoning renewable energy surplus.\n\nThe new operation is located in the far north of Sweden, where hydroelectric power dominates the grid. Abdumalik Mirakhmedov, founder and executive president of GDA, told Cointelegraph that the new data center is located near the Porjus Hydroelectric Power Station:\n\n\u201cGiven the proximity to the hydroelectric power station, we expect all of our electricity consumption to be powered by renewable energy.\u201d\n\nThe total capacity of the data center is approximately 8 MW and is expected to result in a hash rate of approximately 155 petahashes per second. GDA explained to Cointelegraph that there are 1,900 Bitcoin mining machines deployed in the Porjus data center.\n\nAs reported by Jaran Mellerud, a business developer at Luxor Mining and a frequent Cointelegraph contributor, Sweden produces almost all of its electricity from nuclear and hydropower, particularly in the north.\n\nMellerud, who hails from nearby Norway, explained that renewable energy is also abundant:\n\n\u201cSweden is an electricity powerhouse, generating the fifth-most electricity per capita globally in 2021.\u201d\n\nGDA\u2019s strategic expansion is part of a broader trend in the Northern European Bitcoin mining landscape. Christian Anders, founder of BT.CX \u2014 a Swedish Bitcoin exchange dating back to January 2012 \u2014 told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin mining is not very common due to high energy prices.\n\nHowever, the Nordics are a class apart, Anders told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cSweden, Finland and Norway have a surplus of energy and negative energy prices from time to time, and primarily renewable energy in the form of hydropower in a remote location which is hard to distribute.\u201d\n\nUntapped, stranded and renewable energy are popular ingredients for Bitcoin mining, as they tend to be the cheapest. Mirakhmedov explained, \u201cSweden also has abundant clean energy sources, which is an important factor we consider in our operations.\u201d\n\nPorjus is in the far north of Sweden where renewable energy is abundant.\n\nMoreover, while sentiment among some Scandinavians is negative toward Bitcoin, Anders told Cointelegraph that energy companies are coming around to Bitcoin mining\u2019s utility: \u201cThe CEO of the largest energy producer in Sweden, Vattenfall, is pro-Bitcoin mining and its use case for grid balancing.\u201d Stabilizing electricity grids with Bitcoin miners is also growing in the United States.\n\nTim Carra, head of Nordic at GDA, expanded on the point in correspondence with Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cWith abundant energy sources, a pro-innovation environment and a strong educational system that results in a great culture of innovation, we believe that Sweden is one of the best countries in the world to mine Bitcoin and expect to further invest in this beautiful region moving forward.\u201d\n\nGDA concentrates the majority of its power generation in Texas in the United States, where one facility consumes 300 MW of electricity. The new Swedish operations complement a new GDA facility in South Carolina and demonstrate that there are still some attractive, untapped potential mining destinations around the world. Anders chimed in:\n\n\u201cThere is also a market opportunity in Spain/Portugal, which gets cheap energy from Africa and its domestic solar production, where prices also are very cheap from time to time. BT.CX is working with renewable Bitcoin miners to offer a way to offset your Bitcoin holdings.\u201d\n\nAs Anders alludes to, the generation of new Bitcoin consumes considerable amounts of electricity. The European Central Bank has reported that Bitcoin mining has a significant carbon footprint.\n\nStats from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. Global energy consumption is estimated at 25,000 terawatt-hours, according to the IEA.\n\nHowever, while it\u2019s often portrayed as an energy-guzzling and carbon-intensive industry, Bitcoin mining consumes just 149.95 terawatt-hours of electricity per year, or less than 0.7% of global energy, according to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance.\n\nRelated: Tether invests in El Salvador\u2019s $1B renewable energy project\n\nMeanwhile, renewable energy, including hydro, continues to dominate the global Bitcoin mining energy mix. Neighboring Norway, for example, contributes roughly 1% of the Bitcoin hash rate and is 100% renewable, while the new GDA installation in Sweden is another green energy Bitcoin miner.\n\nUltimately, Anders concluded, \u201cIt\u2019s super cool that more miners are coming to the Nordic European countries to help us with this mission.\u201d\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with \u2018Net Zero\u2019 promises"

        "title": "Bitcoin, ether stabilise after last week\u2019s nosedive from ETF cool-off - South China Morning Post",
        "content": "\u201cThe surge in June, spurred by BlackRock\u2019s application for SEC approval of a bitcoin ETF, led to a noticeable spike in prices,\u201d said Butterfill in a report released Friday.\n\nA cool-off of bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) hype in the US could be behind the retreat of the token. That is the view of James Butterfill, head of research at European alternative asset manager CoinShares.\n\nBitcoin edged up 0.3 per cent in the last 24 hours to US$26,178 as of 07:30am in Hong Kong, logging a weekly loss of 10.7 per cent, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency hit a two-month low of US$25,409 on Friday, but held position above the US$26,000 support level over the weekend.\n\n\u201cHowever, markets are now coming to terms with the realisation that an immediate SEC approval for a bitcoin ETF in the US is unlikely. It\u2019s noteworthy that current bitcoin prices have stabilised around levels observed before this announcement,\u201d he added.\n\nThe low volume and volatility in bitcoin, a rise in US treasury yields, as well as concerns over China\u2019s ailing economy contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s sharp weekly decline, the CoinShares report found.\n\n\u201cThe outlook for the markets in the forthcoming months presents a blend of opportunities and challenges. It\u2019s anticipated that the US Federal Reserve will refrain from hiking rates further in September,\u201d Butterfill said.\n\nA dovish shift in Fed policy could provide a boost to Bitcoin\u2019s prospects, he added.\n\n\u201cOn the flip side, investors are eagerly awaiting the SEC\u2019s verdict on the Grayscale ETF and BlackRock applications in September. Anticipations are that decisions on both applications might be postponed, potentially leading to investor disappointment,\u201d Butterfly said.\n\nAlong with bitcoin, ether moved up 0.8 per cent to US$1,683 but remained 8.5 per cent lower for the past seven days.\n\nThe US SEC could approve several ETFs based on Ethereum futures by October 2023, Bloomberg reported on Friday citing unnamed sources. Investment firms Volatility Shares, Bitwise, Roundhill and ProShares have all applied for Ethereum ETF licenses.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed over the past 24 hours, but all posted weekly losses. Cryptocurrencies have seen a total liquidation of US$24.91 million in the past 24 hours.\n\nThat is a considerable decrease on the daily losses posted last week during a calamitous downturn in the cryptocurrency market. On Friday alone, traders liquidated over US$1 billion in cryptocurrencies, including US$851.94 million in long positions \u2013 positions where investors bet the cryptocurrency price will rise. On Monday, long position liquidations stood at US$6.89 million for the past 24 hours, according to data from cryptocurrency information platform CoinGlass\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP token led the winners, gaining almost 4 per cent to US$0.5408 but plunged 13.8 per cent for the week.\n\nIn the ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs and the SEC, Judge Analisa Torres on Thursday granted the SEC permission to appeal an earlier judgment in favour of Ripple Labs. That ruling in late June found that the technology firm\u2019s programmatic sales of XRP did not violate securities laws.\n\nIn a Saturday tweet, Ripple\u2019s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz said the SEC should not be allowed to appeal until the conclusion of the case. He said that, even if an appeal is granted, \u201cthe case should still continue and the appeal should run in parallel.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin price holds $26K as derivatives data hints at end of volatility spike - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "In the past few months, Bitcoin traders had grown used to less volatility, but historically, it\u2019s not uncommon for the cryptocurrency to see price swings of 10% in just two or three days. The recent 11.4% correction from $29,340 to $25,980 between Aug. 15 and Aug. 18 took many by surprise and led to the largest liquidation since the FTX collapse in November 2022. But the question remains: Was this correction significant in terms of the market structure?\n\nCertain experts point to reduced liquidity as the reason for the recent spikes in volatility, but is this truly the case?\n\nBTC surged 70%+ in 2023, yet the \"Alameda gap\" - liquidity dip post FTX and Alameda Research collapse - remains, supported by low volatility.\n\n\n\nRead full analysis here: https://t.co/kVslgLQtpL pic.twitter.com/g8Ac7udBl7 \u2014 Kaiko (@KaikoData) August 17, 2023\n\nAs indicated by the Kaiko Data chart, the decline of 2% in the Bitcoin (BTC) order book depth has mirrored the decrease in volatility. It\u2019s possible that market makers adjusted their algorithms to align with the prevailing market conditions.\n\nHence, delving into the derivatives market to assess the impact of the drop to $26,000 seems reasonable. This examination aims to determine whether whales and market makers have become bearish or if they\u2019re demanding higher premiums for protective hedge positions.\n\nTo begin, traders should identify similar instances in the recent past, and two events stand out:\n\nBitcoin/USD price index, 2023. Source: TradingView\n\nThe first decline took place from March 8 to March 10, causing Bitcoin to plummet by 11.4% to $19,600, marking its lowest point in over seven weeks at that time. This correction followed the liquidation of Silvergate Bank, a crucial operational partner for multiple cryptocurrency firms.\n\nThe subsequent significant move occurred between April 19 and April 21, resulting in a 10.4% drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price. It revisited the $27,250 level for the first time in more than three weeks after Gary Gensler, the chair of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, addressed the House Financial Services Committee. Gensler\u2019s statements provided little reassurance that the agency\u2019s enforcement-driven regulatory efforts would cease.\n\nNot every 10% Bitcoin price crash is the same\n\nBitcoin quarterly futures generally tend to trade with a slight premium when compared to spot markets. This reflects sellers\u2019 inclination to receive additional compensation in return for delaying the settlement. Healthy markets usually see BTC futures contracts being traded with an annualized premium ranging from 5 to 10%. This situation, termed \u201ccontango,\" is not unique to the cryptocurrency domain.\n\nBitcoin 3-month futures premium, March/April 2023. Source: Laevitas\n\nLeading up to the crash on March 8, Bitcoin\u2019s futures premium was at 3.5%, indicating a moderate level of comfort. However, when Bitcoin\u2019s price dipped below $20,000, there was an intensified sense of pessimism, causing the indicator to shift to a discount of 3.5%. This phenomenon, referred to as \"backwardation,\" is typical of bearish market conditions.\n\nConversely, the correction on April 19 had minimal impact on Bitcoin's futures main metric, with the premium remaining around 3.5% as the BTC price revisited $27,250. This could imply that professional traders were either highly confident in the soundness of the market structure or were well-prepared for the 10.4% correction.\n\nThe 11.4% BTC crash between Aug. 15 and Aug. 18, reveals distinct dissimilarities from previous instances. The starting point for Bitcoin\u2019s futures premium was higher, surpassing the 5% neutral threshold.\n\nBitcoin 3-month futures premium, August 2023. Source: Laevitas\n\nNotice how rapidly the derivatives market absorbed the shock on Aug. 18. The BTC futures premium swiftly returned to a 6% neutral-to-bullish position. This suggests that the decline to $26,000 did not significantly dampen the optimism of whales and market makers regarding the cryptocurrency.\n\nOptions markets confirm lack of bearish momentum\n\nTraders should also analyze options markets to understand whether the recent correction has caused pro traders to become more risk-averse. In short, if traders anticipate a Bitcoin price drop, the delta skew metric will rise above 7%, and phases of excitement tend to have a -7% skew.\n\nRelated: Why is the crypto market down today?\n\nBitcoin 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nData indicate excessive demand for call (buy) BTC options ahead of the Aug. 15 crash, with the indicator at -11%. This trend changed over the subsequent five days, though the metric remained within the neutral range and was unable to breach the 7% threshold.\n\nUltimately, both Bitcoin options and futures metrics reveal no signs of professional traders adopting a bearish stance. While this doesn\u2019t necessarily guarantee a swift return of BTC to the $29,000 support level, it does reduce the likelihood of an extended price correction.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "Is Bitcoin Ready to Go Parabolic? Price Action Mirrors Pre-2020 Surge - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nCredible Crypto pointed out the market fractals\n\nHowever, fractals are not adequate per our analysis\n\nBitcoin is likely headed further down in the near-term\n\nAfter reaching $31,400 the price of Bitcoin started moving sideways before making a sharp downturn of almost 20% in the recent market crash. Still, the price is up by 68% since November 21, and on a macro level, we are still in an uptrend.\n\nThis type of sharp downturn was seen in late February to early March, and yet the price made a new high. Looking at the market structure and some fundamentals, many have maintained their bullish outlook.\n\nAmong those is a crypto analysis, popular on Twitter, Credible Crypto , who took it to the platform to discuss his stance. According to him, the price structure is similar to that of March to August 2020, just right before Bitcoin took off to a new all-time high.\n\nIn this analysis, we will cover this possibility and re-examine his analysis.\n\nCrediBULL Crypto Analysis\n\nIn his Twitter post , Credible Crypto analyzed the market structure and pointed out the market fractality. First saying that both of these structures \u2013 from April to present, and from March to August 2020 are sideways in essence.\n\n\u201cRanging structures occurring after a clean/clear impulse (uptrend) and near vertical rally off a major low- which makes me believe that the goal here is re-accumulation- and so technical context is the same,\u201d Credible Crypto said in his Twitter post .\n\nHe interprets this as the accumulation range from which, if the price breakout, it will be poised for massive price spikes as we saw in 2020 when Bitcoin increased by 200% at first, to its $16,000 \u2013 $18,000 range, and then proceeded to make further advances.\n\nThis scenario will get invalidated if the price of Bitcoin continues to move to the downside below $24.800. If this level gets broken, lower targets could be seen, and the fractal structure he is referring to would be broken as well.\n\nBitcoin Price Analysis\n\nAs we have pointed out in our previous analyses, there are two scenarios in play for the price of Bitcoin, but in both, we are expecting near-term downside movement. We have either seen the start of the bull cycle on November 21, when this increase began, or we have seen a corrective three-wave move from June 18 last year. In both cases, this upward movement ended in July.\n\nThis is why we are either expecting a corrective ABC that will establish the first bull market higher low in the zone between $22,000 \u2013 $20,000, or a move for the final bear market low, potentially in the zone of $11,000.\n\nIn Elliott Wave theory, market fractality is highly important, and examining the mentioned fractals according to the Credible Crypto, they are not the same. His referred sideways zones are not to be compared, primarily because of their context. In March 2020, we saw a large 50% decrease following a recovery of 170% to the same levels, which all occurred in a matter of 66 days and formed a V shape which is usually seen in the market bottoms.\n\nIn contrast, the recent zone he pointed to be fractal with the mentioned one is after the rise of 100% and lasted for 145 days. This is more of a sign of struggle but also indecision, meaning that investors are slowly waiting to see a decisive move, but there isn\u2019t anyone pushing the price. This is why we have seen a sharp decline, amplified but long liquidations.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs per our chart analysis, we will see further lows, below the invalidation point of $24,800 of the Credible Crypto scenario. His fractal comparison is inadequate, and the likelihood of the price of Bitcoin heading for a 200% surge is very small, although not impossible.\n\nNow that the price is in a freefall, it first needs to establish strong support in order to shoot back up. From the support level it reaches, we are going to reexamine this possibility, but for now, the chance is slim to none.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "content": "Trader sentiment has turned bearish following Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) 11% slump this week. Although Bitcoin is taking support near $25,000, several analysts are factoring in another leg down toward the crucial $20,000 level.\n\nThe weakness is not limited to the cryptocurrency markets alone. United States equities markets also witnessed a losing week. The S&P 500 Index fell 2.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped about 2.6%, with both indexes recording a three-week losing streak. This suggests that traders are in a risk-off mode in the near term.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nThe fall in Bitcoin dragged several altcoins lower, indicating a broad-based sell-off. However, among the sea of red, there are a few altcoins that have stood out either by bouncing off strong support levels or by continuing their up-move.\n\nLet\u2019s study the charts of the top-five cryptocurrencies that may buck the negative trend and stay positive over the next few days.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin has been range-bound between $24,800 and $31,000 for the past several days. After failing to sustain above the resistance, the price has dipped near the support of the range.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe fall of the past few days has pulled the relative strength index (RSI) into the oversold territory, indicating that a recovery may be around the corner. If the price rises from the current level, it could reach the 20-day exponential moving average ($28,309). The bears are likely to sell the rallies to this level.\n\nIf the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the BTC/USDT pair may again drop to the crucial support at $24,800. If this support gives way, the pair may start a descent to $20,000.\n\nOn the upside, a break and close above the 20-day EMA will indicate that the pair may extend its stay inside the range for a few more days. The bulls will have to push and sustain the price above $31,000 to start a new up-move, but that looks a little far-fetched at the moment.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is in the oversold territory on the four-hour chart, indicating that bears are in command. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the pair may retest the support zone between $25,166 and $24,800.\n\nConversely, a break and close above the 20-day EMA could signal that the bears may be losing their grip. That could start a rally to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $27,200 and then to the 61.8% retracement level of $27,680.\n\nHedera price analysis\n\nHedera (HBAR) turned down from the overhead resistance at $0.078 on Aug. 15, indicating that bears are active at higher levels. However, a minor advantage in favor of the bulls is that the buyers purchased the dip to the 50-day SMA ($0.054).\n\nHBAR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive zone, indicating that the buyers have the upper hand. The bulls will again try to push the HBAR/USDT pair to the overhead resistance at $0.078. If this obstacle is surmounted, the pair may surge to $0.093 and, eventually, to $0.099.\n\nInstead, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that bears continue to sell on rallies. The pair could then retest the support at the uptrend line. A break below this level may open the gates for a decline to $0.045 and then $0.040.\n\nHBAR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe recovery is facing resistance near the overhead resistance at $0.070. This suggests that the bears have not given up and they continue to sell on rallies. The price has turned down to the moving averages, which is an important level to keep an eye on.\n\nIf the price turns up from the current level, it will suggest that the bulls are trying to flip the moving averages into support. Buyers will then make one more attempt to overcome the barrier at $0.070. If they do that, the rally may reach $0.075.\n\nIf the price plunges below the moving averages, the pair may collapse to the uptrend line, which is an important level for the bulls to defend.\n\nOptimism price analysis\n\nOptimism (OP) broke below the moving averages but found support at the uptrend line. This suggests demand at lower levels.\n\nOP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe price has bounced off the uptrend line but is facing resistance at the 20-day EMA ($1.51). If the price does not break below the uptrend line, it will increase the likelihood of a rally above the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the OP/USDT pair may rise to the overhead resistance at $1.88.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and plummets below the uptrend line, it will suggest that bears have seized control. The pair may first fall to $1.21 and then to $1.09.\n\nOP/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears are trying to stall the recovery at the 50-day SMA. If the price closes below the 20-day EMA, the next stop is likely to be the uptrend line. A break below this support could indicate the start of a deeper fall.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above the 50-day SMA, it will indicate the start of a relief rally to $1.61. If this level is crossed, the pair could reach $1.71.\n\nRelated: Ripple CTO clarifies on SEC appeal, highlights case complexity\n\nInjective price analysis\n\nInjective\u2019s (INJ) price action of the past few days has formed a bullish ascending triangle pattern, indicating that buyers have a slight edge.\n\nINJ/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears pulled the price below the uptrend line of the triangle on Aug. 17, but the long tail on the candlestick shows solid buying at lower levels. The bulls pushed the price above the 20-day EMA ($7.73) on Aug. 18 and have successfully held the level since then. This suggests that the bulls are trying to flip the 20-day EMA into support.\n\nA rise above the 50-day SMA ($8.16) could signal that the bulls are back in the driver\u2019s seat. That could clear the path for a potential rally to $10. This positive view could invalidate in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the uptrend line. The INJ/USDT pair may then slump to $5.40.\n\nINJ/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows a strong bounce off the uptrend line, indicating that the bulls are fiercely protecting this level. The recovery is likely to face selling at the overhead resistance at $8.33.\n\nIf the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance but rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that bulls continue to buy on dips. That will enhance the prospects of a break above $8.33. If this resistance is cleared, the pair may rise to $8.83 and then to $9.50.\n\nThe first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the 50-day SMA. That could sink the pair to the crucial level of the uptrend line. If this level cracks, the pair may tumble to $6.50.\n\nTHORChain price analysis\n\nWhile most altcoins are reeling under pressure, THORChain (RUNE) has been in an uptrend for the past few days.\n\nRUNE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe up-move is facing selling at the overhead resistance at $2, as seen from the long wick on the Aug. 19 candlestick. The sharp rally of the past few days has pushed the RSI into deeply overbought territory, indicating that a consolidation or a minor correction is possible.\n\nIf bulls do not give up much ground from the current level, it will increase the possibility of a break above $2. If that happens, the RUNE/USDT pair could start its march toward $2.30 and then $2.60.\n\nContrarily, if the price dips below $1.41, it will signal the start of a deeper correction to the 20-day EMA ($1.33).\n\nRUNE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages on the four-hour chart are sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought territory, indicating that bulls have the upper hand. If the price sustains above $1.80, the pair could retest the critical resistance at $2.\n\nContrarily, if the price skids below $1.80, a drop to the 20-day EMA is possible. A strong bounce off this level will indicate that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. That will increase the chances of a rally to $2.\n\nIf the price breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will signal that traders are selling on rallies. That may sink the pair to the 50-day SMA and then to $1.38.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Elon Musk's Bitcoin Sales Rock Crypto Stocks: What Happens Next? - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency-related stocks including Riot Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: RIOT), Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: MARA) and Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN) gapped down on August 18 on news that Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX had unloaded all its bitcoin.\n\nAll those stocks were already significantly lower for the month of August, as cryptocurrencies were falling. While some analysts expect a crypto rebound in the not-so-distant future, others see the stock languishing for longer.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price fell by 1.94% on August 18, to $26,109.90, after rallying in July.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Musk has sold bitcoin; last year, Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) sold $936 million of the digital currency. In the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings report, it said the value of its digital assets was $184 million, the same as in the previous two quarters.\n\nRiot Platforms, Marathon Digital and Coinbase have similar trading patterns: Each stock broke out of a base in June or July, rallied to its best levels in over a year, then began pulling back the week ended July 21 as the price of bitcoin fell.\n\nRiot Platforms\n\nBuried deep in the notes of Riot\u2019s 10Q, the official regulatory filing of its most recent quarterly results, you\u2019ll find details regarding a power supply contract with Texas energy provider TXU Energy Retail Co., to sell electricity to power the Lone Star State.\n\nThat\u2019s a small source of revenue, but it hints at the company\u2019s diversified operations, at a time when the crypto-mining industry is facing low prices for its core asset.\n\nThe company also derives revenue from providing engineered electrical equipment products to third-party customers, and offers data-center hosting for institutional customers.\n\nRiot, whose market capitalization is $1.938 billion, had a revenue increase of 5% in the most recent quarter, following three quarters of earnings declines. The company has not yet posted a profit, and analysts have no expectations of that in the next two years.\n\nMarathon Digital\n\nAccording to regulatory filings from the Fort Lauderdale, Florida company, Marathon\u2019s strategy is to produce and hold bitcoin, after paying for cash operating costs of production, as a long-term investment.\n\nLike Riot Platforms, Marathon is also looking to expand and diversify income sources.\n\n\u201cWe may also explore opportunities to become involved in businesses ancillary to our bitcoin mining business as favorable market conditions and opportunities arise,\u201d the company says.\n\nIn the most recent quarter, reported on August 8, Marathon significantly narrowed its loss to 13 cents a share, an improvement over the year-earlier loss of $1.94 a share.\n\nIn May, the company received a subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, pertaining to alleged securities laws violations. That news didn\u2019t appreciably harm the stock, which continued forming a base that it cleared on June 23.\n\nWith shares down 32.90% in the past month, the stock is not actionable at this time. Sure, value-seekers will eventually swoop in, but the timing of that could be tricky, as the stock\u2019s downside momentum is strong.\n\nCoinbase\n\nCoinbase, the largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, is the largest holding in two of Cathie Woods\u2019 Ark ETFs: The ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSE: ARKF) and the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEARCA: ARKW).\n\nThe latter fund has been selling shares in recent weeks, but Coinbase still comprises 8.73% of fund assets.\n\nWith a market capitalization of $17.36 billion, Coinbase is in a different position than smaller bitcoin companies. Its business model doesn\u2019t involve mining bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. That arguably allows it more flexibility and increased ability to weather downturns in the price of underlying digital assets.\n\nIts second-quarter earnings report, issued on August 3, showed the company has been trimming expenses, and emphasizing recurring revenue in the form of subscriptions and services. The latter includes custodial fees for holding assets, as well as interest income. It\u2019s the first time trading didn\u2019t constitute the bulk of quarterly revenue.\n\nWhile Coinbase successfully weathered the debacle facing fellow exchange FTX, it, too, has fallen under regulators\u2019 scrutiny. In January, it agreed to pay New York State $50 million to settle allegations that it violated money-laundering laws. As part of that deal, Coinbase also invested $50 million into a state regulatory compliance program aimed at stopping future incidents.\n\nThat\u2019s a hefty payment, as the company\u2019s most recent quarterly revenue totaled $707 million.\n\nAs with the smaller bitcoin-related stocks that tumbled on the SpaceX news, it\u2019s best to keep an eye on Coinbase if you\u2019re thinking about a purchase, and give yourself some extra insurance as it begins turning higher again.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

Some experts even claim that such approval could be a \"moon-worthy\" catalyst for crypto.\n\nAs Cointelegraph recently reported, research boutique Fundstrat believes that the coin value of Bitcoin \u201cwill surge past an eye-watering $150,000 by the end of 2024\u201d if the SEC does start approving spot-based Bitcoin ETFs."

The precious resource has fueled economic, financial, and political development across these nations.\n\nHowever, with an international shift toward renewable energy and sustainability, many Middle Eastern countries, such as the United Arab Emirates and Oman, are now shifting their economic powers towards the new age of trade.\n\nOman is now taking strides toward a shift to digital assets. The nation has recently announced its hefty investment in processing machines and mining centers, signaling a new dawn of economics in the nation.\n\nUAE Pushes Crypto Forward\n\nAs of April 17th, the Securities And Commodities Authority (SCA) AND UAE Central Bank started accepting applications from companies intending to provide cryptocurrency services within the country.\n\nFurthermore, the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), described as \u201cthe world\u2019s first, tailor-made Virtual Asset regime\u201d released its Full Market Product (FMP) Regulations.\n\nThe regulatory framework explains in detail how the government plans to govern crypto market conduct, licensing, company operations, and cybersecurity. Moreover, FMP regulations pinpoint regulations meant for VARA-licensed companies.\n\nNow, the UAE is on the hunt for crypto institutions that deviate from VARA regulations, tightening up control of the industry to protect local customers.\n\nDubai\u2019s crypto regulator struck a $2.7 million penalty on OPNX, a venture by Three Arrows Capital founders Kyle Davies and Su Zhu, for alleged violations in promoting virtual assets.\n\nOPNX was found to collect personal information on Emirati customers, which is not permitted under VARA. As a result, OPNX was served a cease and desist directive from the regulating body.\n\nHowever, OPNX UAE customers still found promotions and marketing messages from OPNX after the directive was served.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates and adjacent Middle Eastern nations such as Oman aim for an assertive entry into the digital asset space through a slew of vast investments and continuously updated market regulations.\n\n$370 Million For Hosting & Mining\n\nEngineer Said Hamoud, Oman\u2019s Minister of Transport, Communications, and Information Technology (MTCIT), led the inauguration of The Afaaq for Advanced Technologies data hosting and crypto mining center on August 13th.\n\nImplemented by Exahertz International, the center is valued at 135 million Omani Rials (about $370 million). The center is also the country\u2019s second-largest venture into the space, with the first being Al-Madina Al-Khadraa, which is valued at around 150 million Omani Rials.\n\nEngineer Hamoud highlighted the significance of the investments that total 285 Omani Rials as a \u201cmajor milestone\u201d in the country\u2019s journey towards digital transformation. The minister also pointed out the potential for job creation following the emergence of the industry in the Middle Eastern country.\n\nThe minister also commented on Afaaq, calling it \u201ca leading player in the data hosting and processing sector, and we are confident that they will be a valuable asset to Oman\u2019s digital economy\u201d.\n\nSam Ferdows, CEO of Moonwalk Systems and Strategic Partner of Exahertz International revealed plans to create a wider network of blockchain-based data centers in Oman. He also stated that operations have already reached 11 megawatts of power and over 2,000 machines. Finally, he predicts operations will reach 15,000 machines by October to cover different centers around Oman.\n\nFerdows also states that the company will be providing knowledge and expertise as part of the implementation process."

Discover SCENE\n\nIn an ongoing lawsuit filed by Craig Wright, self-proclaimed inventor of Bitcoin, attorneys for the 12 Bitcoin Core developers targeted by Wright filed a preliminary issue application with the UK High Court. The filing purports to dismantle many of the plaintiff's claims, the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund said in a statement on Monday.\n\nWright claims to own 111,000 Bitcoin that were allegedly stolen from the Mt Gox exchange. The defense notes that Wright lacks any documentation showing ownership of the missing Bitcoin, and accuse him of fabricating the limited documents provided to the court.\n\n\u201c[We] seek to have this claim struck out on the ground that it is a fraudulent claim and an abuse of process,\u201d Timothy Elliss, an attorney with Enyo Law LLP, said in the filing. \u201cThey seek disclosure and other case management directions to enable this threshold issue of fraud to be determined as a preliminary issue.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA preliminary issue application is a legal tool that aims to resolve specific issues before a trial by addressing key points and potentially saving time and money for those involved in the proceedings. The case is \u201cTulip Trading Limited v. Bitcoin Association For BSV & Others,\u201d the former being Wright's company\u2014the name of which references the tulip mania that gripped the Netherlands in the 1630s.\n\n\u201cThe application lists the evidence that Tulip Trading must present in a preliminary trial to demonstrate it owned the Bitcoins in question and also requests that Tulip Trading provide a security payment of $1.63 million to cover the cost of the case in the event that it is dismissed,\u201d the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund said.\n\nAttorneys for the Bitcoin Core developers argue that Wright and his company did not own the Bitcoin involved in the lawsuit. If the court sides with the Bitcoin Core developers, Tulip Trading Limited must prove its ownership of the digital assets before the case can continue.\n\nElliss further claims that if Wright is the owner, he is admitting to stealing 80,000 BTC\u2014worth around $2 billion today.\n\n\u201cIt is widely accepted in the cryptocurrency community that the Bitcoin in the 1Feex address originated from a well-publicized hack on a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange that occurred in March 2014,\u201d defense attorneys wrote. \u201cEssentially, it appears that if Dr. Wright is the owner of the Bitcoin in the 1Feex address (which is denied), he has effectively admitted to being the person who stole 80,000 BTC from Mt.

        "content": "Image: Shutterstock\n\nIn a recent turn of events, Bitcoin ordinals, a prominent type of non-fungible token (NFT), have faced a staggering drop in their trading activity. DappRadar, a leading analytics platform, revealed that Bitcoin ordinals transactions plummeted by a significant 97%, totalling 20,571 in mid-August. The NFT's trading volumes, a critical indicator of user engagement, experienced a jaw-dropping decline of 98% since May.DappRadar's data, disclosed on August 17, portrayed a grim picture of the Bitcoin ordinals market. The sales, which soared to a zenith of $452 million in May, dwindled to approximately $3 million by August 14. The situation raises concerns over the long-term viability of Bitcoin-based NFTs. While DappRadar highlighted the substantial decrease in sales volume and transaction count, it underscored the need for further analysis to determine whether this decline is merely a \"temporary setback\" or a systemic issue.However, DappRadar emphasised the need for additional time to gauge the implications of this decline accurately. While market dynamics can contribute to fluctuations in sales volume, the consistent decline in transaction count raises broader concerns. The report suggested that the dwindling transaction count might reflect reduced trader engagement with Bitcoin ordinals, potentially impacting the long-term relevance and sustainability of these NFTs in the growing NFT space.This sudden drop in Bitcoin ordinals NFT trading volume comes after a bustling second quarter, during which trading volumes and user activity experienced a substantial surge compared to this year's first quarter. However, the sustainability of the ordinals market is at a crossroads due to the divided outlook within the Bitcoin community regarding the role of NFTs on the network.While Ethereum and other blockchains have integrated NFTs with little controversy, the Bitcoin community appears divided. Some consider Bitcoin \"digital gold,\" emphasising its role as a store of value, while others question the integration of NFTs onto the Bitcoin network.The upcoming months are anticipated to play a pivotal role in determining the fate of Bitcoin-based NFTs. The industry will closely watch whether Bitcoin ordinals rebound from this setback, or the coin potentially reverts to its original function as a store of value as the NFT landscape evolves.As the crypto realm navigates these shifts, stakeholders and enthusiasts alike are left with crucial questions about the future trajectory of Bitcoin-based NFTs and their role in the rapidly transforming world of digital currencies and decentralised finance."

Discover SCENE\n\nInstitutions are \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the SEC\u2019s lack of decision-making regarding an ETF, according to the most recent report from CoinShares, prompting a widespread sell-off by large entities totalling an impressive $55 million worth of digital asset outflows in the past seven days.\n\nAs James Butterfill, head of research for CoinShares wrote, \u201cDisappointment from SEC ETF decisions has impacted sentiment,\u201d with Bitcoin\u2019s outflows reversing last week\u2019s purchases worth $27 million.\n\nButterfill explained to Decrypt that this sudden downturn appears to be caused by an \u201coverhyped market\u201d that realized a Bitcoin ETF isn\u2019t as imminent as it once seemed. He added that \u201cfears of a Chinese-based economic downturn\u201d haven\u2019t helped.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to the analyst, the summer doldrums are in full effect, with low trading volume plaguing the market. With $2.3 billion in daily volume versus $11 billion at the beginning of the year, these numbers have left the market \u201cmore vulnerable to larger trades,\u201d said Butterfill.\n\nCanada and Germany marked the week for solid selling by institutions in their territories, with $35 million and $11 million respectively. The sole exception was the land of the Red Cross, Switzerland, clocking $3.5 million worth of inflows.\n\nLast week\u2019s institutional outflows were not limited to only Bitcoin (BTC), which currently trades at $25,910 according to Coingecko.\n\nMost altcoins suffered a drop in buying interest by institutions, with Ethereum (ETH) witnessing $9 million worth of selling. Along with the second largest crypto by market capitalization, Polygon (MATIC), Litecoin (LTC), and Polkadot (DOT) suffered outflows of under $1 million.\n\nBulls continue to lead the way for Ripple (XRP), as the fifth largest cryptocurrency notches 17 straight weeks' worth of inflows, marking $1.2 million in the past seven days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe numbers provided by CoinShares align with the surprise flash crash in crypto prices last week.\n\nDigital assets saw blood in the streets after Bitcoin shed nearly 11% of its value, and dipped to prices it hadn\u2019t seen since the beginning of June. A cascade in liquidations ensued, with over $800 million wiped from the total market capitalization.\n\nAccording to Coingecko, Ethereum currently changes hands at $1,656, a 10.5% drop on the week, along with the majority of blue-chip crypto assets recording double digit losses for the past seven days.\n\nNevertheless, Butterfill told Decrypt he \u201cexpects volumes to rise\u201d with the Fed\u2019s Jackson Hole symposium and the Federal Reserve's potential decision on interest rates.\n\nIt definitely appears that Institutions are siding with the bears as the crypto market continues to hold its breath for a much-anticipated (and much-awaited) spot Bitcoin ETF, and for the markets to find something to hold onto."

        "content": "BTC\u2019s realized price of short-term holders was poised to fall below market value.\n\nShould this happen, BTC\u2019s price might suffer a further drop in value.\n\nIn the current market cycle, an unabated drop in Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] realized price of its short-term holders put the leading cryptocurrency at risk of a further decline in value, pseudonymous CryptoQuant analyst Crazzyblockk noted in a new report.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nBTC\u2019s realized price refers to the average price that all BTCs were last transacted on-chain. It is calculated by dividing the total value of all BTCs by the number of coins in circulation.\n\nThe metric is often deployed toward assessing the overall health of the BTC market.\n\nRising realized price indicates that investors are buying bitcoins at a higher price, which is a bullish signal. On the other hand, a falling realized price suggests that investors are selling bitcoins at a lower price, which is a bearish signal.\n\nShort-term holders to determine the next price direction?\n\nIn its report, the analyst compared BTC\u2019s realized price of short-term holders in the 2019-2020 price cycle and the current price cycle and found that when the realized price of short-term holders fell below the market price in the former cycle, the \u201cmaximum loss imposed on short-term holders of 1-6 months was about 40-45%.\u201d\n\nIn the current price cycle, the realized price of short-term holders remains above the market price. But it was much closer to the market price than it was in the 2019 price cycle.\n\nThe analyst noted that this meant short-term holders are not at as much of a loss as they were in the 2019 price cycle. This was because losses incurred by this investor cohort only ranged from 4% to 9% at press time.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nHowever, while current market conditions may not be as bearish as during the 2019 price cycle, the continued decline in the realized price of short-term holders puts them at risk of further losses. It also puts the general market at risk of suffering a further drop in the king coin\u2019s price.\n\nAccording to the analyst:\n\n\u201cFor the current market conditions, it is necessary that even in the face of a further drop in the price of Bitcoin, this realized value should increase. (This) will indicate a double interest in holding Bitcoins besides short-term losses for longer terms.\u201d\n\nTo avoid any \u201cbig price slump,\u201d the analyst opined further:"

        "title": "Bitcoin flash crash triggers $1.36 billion in crypto liquidations - The Straits Times",
        "content": "LONDON \u2013 Bitcoin has had a sleepy summer. Last week it was shaken awake.\n\nBitcoin plunged more than 8 per cent in the space of a few hours to a two-month low of US$25,314 on Thursday. The slump sparked a broad decline across all of crypto, leading to more than US$1 billion (S$1.36 billion) in liquidations and putting Bitcoin on pace for its worst week since November 2022 and crypto exchange FTX\u2019s collapse.\n\nThe carnage \u2013 fuelled by the prospect of prolonged high interest rates and exacerbated by thin crypto trading \u2013 was a reminder of the various threats that continue to stalk digital assets, from hostile regulators to a broader rout in risk assets. And even as Bitcoin has recovered smartly from 2022\u2019s lows, many investors are still sitting out, depriving the market of the breadth and depth that are key ingredients for a sustained bull run.\n\n\u201cThere are still significant amounts of macro uncertainty keeping investors away, and liquidity is still thin,\u201d said Ms Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter and former head of market insights at Genesis Trading. \u201cBottom line, there\u2019s not yet enough conviction.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s activity marked another entry in an emerging trendline for Bitcoin in 2023, with the token having already crashed to two similar low points in January and March. But every sharp decline in 2023 has been followed by recovery, said FRNT Financial\u2019s Stephane Oullette.\n\n\u201cThe next few days should give more clues to whether the sell-off will continue and we\u2019ll see a reversal of this year\u2019s trend,\u201d Mr Oullette said. Signs that Bitcoin is making a major divergence would be if the token were to make a decisive break below the US$25,000 mark, he added, or conversely, a sustained push beyond US$30,000. Its high for the year was US$31,818 in July.\n\nPart of the reason behind last week\u2019s plunge was the market\u2019s outsize exposure to larger trades. The last four months have had the lowest average daily volume of spot crypto transactions since October 2020, according to Mr Riyad Carey, a research analyst for blockchain data firm Kaiko.\n\nThe sector is also overly reliant on narrative to prop up prices, with hype around crypto\u2019s next buzzy project or a Wall Street firm buying cryptocurrencies among the things that spur on investors. A Wall Street Journal report that Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX had sold Bitcoin holdings worsened Thursday\u2019s decline.\n\nBut the narrative is unlikely to improve when these days, many of the biggest announcements to rock the world of digital assets come either from regulators in Washington or judges in the courtroom. The hangover from 2022\u2019s run of bankruptcies and fraud scandals continues to play out on the world stage, dampening optimism on crypto\u2019s recovery.\n\nJust this week, former FTX co-founder and alleged fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried was escorted to a Brooklyn penitentiary after his bail deal was revoked by a judge. Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to the multiple criminal charges he faces.\n\nRecent price declines can be partly attributed to US enforcement actions against crypto exchanges, CoinShares\u2019 James Butterfill said in a blog post on Friday, adding that a recent survey saw fund managers rank regulatory decisions as their key concern. The lingering threat of further lawsuits or penalties haunts the market, leaving investors wary of the safety of some of crypto\u2019s top venues.\n\nDespite this, Bitcoin has displayed a general resilience over the last few months when compared with global risk assets. Post crash, it is still up 58.1 per cent so far in 2023 \u2013 far higher than the S&P 500\u2019s 13.6 per cent gain. And while Bitcoin is likely to experience further downside if monetary conditions continue to deteriorate, Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Jamie Douglas Coutts reckons that hype around a potential US spot crypto exchange-traded fund may help it maintain that value.\n\nSome crypto bulls say the sector could benefit from situations such as China\u2019s deteriorating property sector, which has become a primary concern from a macro perspective. Stimulus measures implemented by the government have so far failed to provide enough economic relief, and Bitcoin\u2019s positioning as an alternative financial system has some believing it might benefit from any shocks.\n\nUltimately though, what is bad for the global economy is likely also bad for crypto.\n\n\u201cIf the stock market drops accelerate, crypto is also likely to suffer in sympathy as investors choose to lock in profits with whatever they can and sit in high-yielding cash until the dust settles,\u201d said Ms Acheson. \u201cThe dust will settle, however, most likely sooner in the crypto market than in the stock market as investors recalibrate the relative risk of each asset group.\u201d BLOOMBERG"

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Analysis: Do You Go for USD 20,000 or USD 30,000? - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In this article we analyze the situation of Bitcoin and see what the technical indicators are signaling about the future price of BTC in USD.\n\nAfter the latest dump that led BTC to register -7% in a single day, the outlook for the king of the crypto market seems to be less than reassuring.\n\nHowever, some data tell us that uncertainty still reigns in the air and there are still chances for a bullish rally.\n\nLet\u2019s look at all the details together.\n\nBitcoin price analysis: two downside factors for the crypto price in USD\n\nLast Thursday, Bitcoin recorded one of the largest daily declines of the entire 2023, losing 7.33% in 24 hours and seeing $2,100 evaporate from its price.\n\nAt the moment, the king of the crypto market scores around $26,000, with some technical indicators signaling the high probability of new declines to come.\n\nOf these, the most iconic and also the most fundamental is that of the 200-day moving average, which shows us that Bitcoin has closed below it for the first time in more than five months.\n\nUsually the upward or downward break of this indicator serves as a strong signal for the crypto\u2019s future price action.\n\nThe last time we witnessed BTC close below the 200 daily SMA, in December 2021, there were several weeks of dumps, with the average acting as resistance for brief bullish moves.\n\nHowever, when the indicator was broken to the upside with a daily close above 20,000 in January 2023, the bulls took over until July.\n\nLooking at the current situation, unless BTC quickly regains the lost ground by establishing the last movement as a \u201cfake,\u201d we can easily imagine new declines for the crypto asset\u2019s price.\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily chart of the price of Bitcoin (BTC/USDT)\n\nOn the derivatives market front, the indicators are no more positive than before.\n\nOn 17 August, the day of Bitcoin\u2019s big dump, more than $386 million in long positions were liquidated among the futures trading venues of the Binance, Bybit, Okx, Huobi, BitMex, Deribit, CoinEX, and Bitfinex exchanges.\n\nIf we take as reference not only BTC but all other cryptocurrencies we can observe liquidations of about $1 billion, higher even than those recorded during the collapse of FTX in November 2022.\n\nBitcoin just saw one of its largest daily liquidations by volume in history.\n\n\n\nStarting at 4:30 PM yesterday, #Bitcoin fell 7.5% in 20 MINUTES, erasing $42 billion in market cap.\n\n\n\nThis mass-liquidation event involved more outflows in 1 day than during the FTX collapse in November\u2026 pic.twitter.com/KmVNkXoOLw \u2014 The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) August 18, 2023\n\nOpen interest in digital gold has definitely shrunk since the last price slide, with the metric briefly falling from $10.53 billion to $8.38 billion, a difference of more than $2 billion in aggregate value.\n\nThis basically means that a lot of interest in managing highly speculative positions has waned after the latest burn taken by traders, who are most likely considering less risky investments.\n\nAlso very interesting to note is how since May 2022 the 10.5-11 billion open interest has acted as resistance for much of Bitcoin\u2019s bullish excursions, which was promptly pushed back to those levels resulting in subsequent declines in the metric.\n\nAt the same time, the 6.5 billion level proved to be good support for prices, which began to rise each time the value was touched.\n\nEven on the last occasion, after the BTC dump, the open interest was rejected strongly to the current $7.9 billion.\n\nSince there is still room, we will most likely see Bitcoin fall in price for the next few weeks with a parallel decline in the total value of open positions in derivative markets.\n\nThe trend should sooner or later mark an upward break.\n\nThe time frame, however, may still be very long before this happens.\n\n\n\nOpen interest chart on Bitcoin (BTC)\n\n\n\nA look at the dominance of the king of the market and on-chain data\n\nDespite the very delicate situation for Bitcoin, there is also some data that signal a positive environment for future prices of the cryptocurrency, which could likely remain below $25,000 until the end of 2023.\n\nFirst, BTC dominance moved in an unusual way during last week\u2019s price drop: usually when there are dumps of this type dominance tends to rise strongly.\n\nThis time we observed the exact opposite with the indicator losing 1% in a short time.\n\nThis means that altcoins have withstood the shock and that many investors are confident about movements in the coming months and have preferred to hold their positions.\n\nSupporting this argument is also the matter of market volumes: even though the liquidations in the crypto markets were comparable to what happened during the FTX crash, we cannot say the same about the capital moved in these trials, which were about 7 times lower.\n\nWhen the real money inflows arrive within the market, we may be able to decree with \u201ccertainty\u201d the future direction of BTC prices.\n\n\n\nDaily chart dominance Bitcoin (BTC)\n\n\n\nAnother positive factor for Bitcoin concerns a piece of on-chain data, namely that of the 7-day average of the network hash rate.\n\nIn fact, a few days ago we witnessed a new all-time high for this metric, which presents us with a positive context in the world of miners, who are increasingly increasing their share of computing power.\n\nThe more hashrate there is, the greater the security and stability of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.\n\nMoreover, a growth of this figure can be interpreted with a constant interest by certain players to grab a share of the network\u2019s power, aware that this could bring excellent profits in the future.\n\nMoreover, this morning the sum of all holders owning more than 1 BTC reached a new ATH according to Glassnode\u2019s data, reaching a total of 1,015,299 addresses.\n\nThis figure, like the previous one regarding the hash rate, is also illustrating a situation that is far from negative for the virtual currency, in which real smart money is accumulating market share ahead of the next bull run without taking current dollar prices into too much consideration.\n\nIf you are a true Bitcoiner, what matters at the end of all is not the profits and losses you are recording, but the amount of coins you possess within your wallets.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 #Bitcoin $BTC Number of Addresses Holding 1+ Coins just reached an ATH of 1,015,299\n\n\n\nPrevious ATH of 1,015,241 was observed on 20 August 2023\n\n\n\nView metric:https://t.co/s7tx1xxyz3 pic.twitter.com/DsYGzzLEhV \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) August 21, 2023\n\nBitcoin price: are we more likely to see $20,000 or $30,000 first?\n\nAfter analyzing the previous technical and on-chain indicators, we can try to draw conclusions about Bitcoin\u2019s overall situation on the future price front.\n\nThe question of whether we will see $20,000 or $30,000 first is not easy to give a definite answer.\n\nHowever, we can conclude on the fact that we will probably observe more declines in the short term.\n\nIn any case, we could easily hold well above $20,000, where there is a strong support area that converges near the January pump, where volumes and liquidity were far greater than current values.\n\nIndicatively, given the performance of the crypto markets as a whole, we can say that even on the other side of the coin we won\u2019t be seeing so easily $30,000 as the short-term price for Bitcoin.\n\nWhat seems more feasible is that until the end of the year, prices will fluctuate between the two extremes, never breaking up or down unless very important events occur.\n\nTo stay on track, it will be important to monitor developments in the Chinese markets, where after the collapse of Evergrande there could be other cascading defaults, as well as the upcoming decisions of the US Federal Reserve regarding interest rates on government bonds.\n\nUntil the end of 2023 we should not expect major gains from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but from 2024 onward we can finally smile again as we did in 2021."

        "title": "Will Bitcoin Price Take Bounce-Back After Recent Bearish Trend? - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) price is following a downward market trend that took its price to drop nearly 12% in one month. This recent month\u2019s downward trend is similar to last week\u2019s bearish trend which shows the increased bears\u2019 activity. Notably, in the recent week, BTC price further dropped over 11%, which is quite similar to its monthly price drop.\n\nDue to the current bearish market trend, BTC\u2019s price marked its 30-day low at $25,409.11 last week. However, its 30-day high was noted at $30,330.64, which is up over 14% from the current trading price of BTC. The market dominance of Bitcoin is currently 48.07%, with an almost null decrease over the day.\n\nBitcoin Price Analysis in A Month\n\nAccording to TradingView, a web-based social network for traders, Bitcoin\u2019s price is trading at $26,020.45 with a 24-hour trading volume of $9.33 Billion. BTC is down nearly 0.64% in the last 24 hours while having a current market cap of almost $506.45 Billion. The monthly price analysis of BTC further shows a downward trend that clearly shows its selloff in the last week.\n\nSource: BTC/USD by TradingView\n\nSince the beginning of last week, with the increased bears\u2019 dominance, BTC price dropped nearly from its 20-day moving average. At press time, the bearish trend has taken control over the BTC price due to which the RSI has reached slightly down from its oversold zone.\n\nNotably, increased bears\u2019 activity has also been observed that hampered the trading performance of Bitcoin.\n\nHow are Other Cryptocurrencies Performing?\n\nAs Bitcoin is the most-traded cryptocurrency by market cap, the present bearish trend in its price has also affected the rest of the cryptocurrencies. Due to this, the fear and greed index is also indicating \u201cfear\u201d at 35 out of 100, as per the data sourced from CoinMarketCap, a cryptocurrency price tracking site.\n\nThe global crypto market cap also shows a 0.25% decline as is at $1.05 Trillion over the last day. Moreover, the total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $23.02 Billion, which further records a 0.62% decrease.\n\nFurthermore, the other cryptocurrencies which also experienced almost similar price drops last week are XRP, DOGE, and SOL. The price of XRP fell over 16% in the last 7 days, while at press time, it is trading at $0.522 with a 1.08% decline in the last 24 hours.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) also showed over 15% price decline last week, while being down by 1.54% in the last 24 hours with a current trading price of $0.063183. Additionally, the price of Solana (SOL) also noted a more than 12% price decline in the last week. SOL also showed a downtrend with a 1.99% price decline in the last 24 hours, while it is trading at $21.34.\n\nAs per the following price analysis, it can be said that it would be quite tough for the Bitcoin price to take a bounce-back. However, it would require massive support from active bulls which once again take the crypto market to trade in a bullish zone.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views and opinions stated by the author, or any people named in this article, are for informational ideas only and do not establish financial, investment, or other advice.
