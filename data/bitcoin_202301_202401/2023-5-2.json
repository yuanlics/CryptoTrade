        "title": "Traders grow wary of 'unloved' bitcoin rally - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\n\nCryptocurrency trading activity has dwindled even as bitcoin enjoys its longest winning streak in more than two years, in a sign that many investors are increasingly reluctant to buy into the rebound after a string of collapses and scandals in 2022.\n\nThe price of bitcoin, the most popular token, has risen 70 per cent this year, helping the market regain some momentum following the failure of companies like exchange FTX.\n\nInvestors have shrugged off lawsuits from US regulators against companies such as Binance, the industry\u2019s largest exchange, and the collapsed stablecoin operator Terraform Labs, as authorities have sought to clamp down on activity they see as illegal.\n\nHowever, the price of bitcoin has since been stuck in a rut for more than a month, trading in a narrow range around $28,000. That pause has been accompanied by thinning volumes, with small trades increasingly able to move market prices.\n\n\u201cWhile bitcoin\u2019s recent performance is great on the face of it, many in crypto are calling this year an unloved rally,\u201d said Charles Storry, head of growth at Phuture, a crypto index provider.\n\n\u201cSentiment hasn\u2019t changed, and regulatory scrutiny is sidelining a lot of new money that might otherwise enter the space. Price movements don\u2019t mean much if the industry isn\u2019t making meaningful progress to regain trust and attract new investors,\u201d he added.\n\nA bruising 2022 has left investors nursing losses or funds trapped in limbo as failed cryptocurrency lenders and exchanges go through bankruptcy proceedings in the courts.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts also argued confidence has been renewed by the weakness in the global banking sector, and the vast outflow of deposits from banks such as the US\u2019s Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate, and Credit Suisse in Switzerland.\n\nDigital assets dashboard Click here for real-time data on crypto prices and insights\n\n\u201cThat rally we experienced after the banking crisis earlier this year seemed to be directly related to a flight for safety and self-custody of funds away from the dollar,\u201d said Edmond Goh, head of trading at crypto broker B2C2.\n\nBut that sentiment has been undermined by a host of signals coming from crypto markets. Analysts point out that the rally in cryptocurrency prices was already built on a thinly traded market.\n\nThe degree to which a market can absorb large orders without major changes to the price of bitcoin has declined since the start of the year, according to data provider CCData.\n\nIn January it would have required the purchase of more than 1,400 bitcoins, roughly equivalent to $23mn at the time, to move the price of the token by more than 1 per cent of its prevailing market value, CCData said.\n\nTowards the end of last month it would have taken only 462 bitcoins, worth about $13mn, to move market prices by 1 per cent, the lowest point of market depth for the bitcoin-tether trading pair since May 2022, when the industry plunged into crisis.\n\n\u201cPrices are recovering, but liquidity has yet to return. No exchange or market maker has yet to fill the space that FTX and [its sister trading arm] Alameda once encompassed,\u201d said Michael Safai, managing partner at crypto trading firm Dexterity Capital.\n\nInvestors who have bought into bitcoin in recent months are now holding on to their investments.\n\nGlassnode, a crypto data provider, said \u201cthere has been remarkably little expenditure\u201d by investors who bought bitcoin when it hit a two-year low after FTX\u2019s failure last November.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018FOMO\u2019 that drove a lot of first time institutional and retail investors last year is obviously not happening now, despite the fact the crypto markets have rallied significantly this year,\u201d said one crypto fund manager based in Dubai, referring to a fear of missing out.\n\nMoreover, there have been outflows of $72mn over the last two weeks in digital asset investments, ending a six-week run of consecutive inflows, according to CoinShares. The crypto investment group ascribed the trend to the likeliness of further interest rate increases by the US Federal Reserve.\n\nTraders are also worried that the heavy clouds that have overshadowed the industry for the past 12 months have not fully gone away. Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, is likely to be pulled into a drawn-out lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nAnother cloud is the fate of Genesis, one of the biggest lenders in the crypto market, which filed for bankruptcy in January owing more than $3bn after the implosion of FTX.\n\nOwner Digital Currency Group, one of the world\u2019s largest owner of bitcoins via its asset management arm, is looking to raise funds to pay back Genesis creditors. DCG said last week some Genesis creditors had walked away from a previously agreed restructuring deal.\n\nThe market appears to be \u201cin a holding pattern pending the resolution of DCG\u2019s debt payments\u201d, said Ram Ahluwalia, chief executive of investment adviser Lumida Wealth Management.\n\nThe uncertainty, along with the crisis in the US regional banking industry, has underscored for many that the market is still working through its many issues.\n\n\u201cThere still isn\u2019t a lot of organic momentum behind cryptocurrencies,\u201d said Safai. \u201cThe headline events that propel cryptocurrency prices past sticking points . . are few and far between.\u201d`"

        "title": "The DAME Tax: Making Cryptominers Pay for Costs They Impose on Others | CEA - The White House",
        "content": "Last month, the President released his Budget for Fiscal Year 2024, building on progress over the past two years to make critical investments to grow the economy, lower costs for families, protect and strengthen Medicare and Social Security, and reduce the deficit.\n\nOne new proposal in this year\u2019s Budget, the Digital Asset Mining Energy (DAME) excise tax, is an example of the President\u2019s commitment to addressing both long-standing national challenges as well as emerging risks \u2013 in this case, the economic and environmental costs of current practices for mining crypto assets (cryptomining, for short). After a phase-in period, firms would face a tax equal to 30 percent of the cost of the electricity they use in cryptomining.\n\nCryptomining is a process for validating transactions among holders of crypto assets to record and transfer cryptographically secured assets on a distributed ledger by, for example, using computing equipment to perform calculations to select the validator (White House 2022). Currently, cryptomining firms do not have to pay for the full cost they impose on others, in the form of local environmental pollution, higher energy prices, and the impacts of increased greenhouse gas emissions on the climate. The DAME tax encourages firms to start taking better account of the harms they impose on society.\n\nWhile crypto assets are virtual, the energy consumption tied to their computationally intensive production is very real and imposes very real costs, as highlighted in a chapter of this year\u2019s Economic Report of the President (entitled \u201cDigital Assets: Relearning Economic Principles\u201d). Recent reporting by the New York Times highlighted the scale of the power consumption associated with 34 of the largest cryptomining operations, which they calculated as equal to the power used by the surrounding 3 million homes. As shown in Figure 1, the amount of electricity used in cryptomining in the United States in 2022 was similar to what is used to power all the country\u2019s home computers or residential lighting.\n\nFigure 1: U.S. Residential and Cryptomining Electricity Usage (in Billions of kilowatt hours in 2022)\n\nCryptominers\u2019 high energy consumption has negative spillovers on the environment, quality of life, and electricity grids where these firms locate across the country (OSTP 2022). Pollution from electricity generation falls disproportionately on low-income neighborhoods and communities of color (Thind et al. 2019). Cryptominers\u2019 intensive and often volatile power consumption also can push up electricity prices for consumers and can increase risks for local electrical grids\u2014straining equipment, causing service interruptions and safety hazards (Chelan County 2018). Yet because cryptomining is geographically mobile and the stability of the business model remains unclear, local utilities also face financial risks if they invest in upgrading capacity that may not be needed if mining activity ceases or moves away.\n\nThe environmental impacts of cryptomining exist even when miners use existing clean power. For example, in the case of communities with hydropower where cryptomining operations are often located, increased electricity consumption by cryptominers reduces the amount of clean power available for other uses, raising prices and increasing overall reliance on dirtier sources of electricity.\n\nAlongside these known costs and risks, cryptomining does not generate the local and national economic benefits typically associated with businesses using similar amounts of electricity. Instead, the energy is used to generate digital assets whose broader social benefits have yet to materialize, as elaborated in the Economic Report of the President. There is little evidence of benefits to local communities in the form of employment or economic opportunity, and research has found that minor increases in local tax revenue are more than offset by increased energy prices for firms and households (Benneton, Compiani, and Morse 2021).\n\nAlthough the potential for cryptomining to relocate abroad\u2014such as to areas with dirtier energy production\u2014is a concern, other countries are also increasingly moving to restrict crypto asset mining. China banned such activity completely in 2021, as have eight other countries; three Canadian provinces also have announced or enacted cryptomining moratoriums. Similarly, some U.S. States and localities are now charging higher electricity prices for or restricting the activity.\n\nTo ensure that cryptomining is not simply pushed from one local community to another, a national policy is needed. Of course, the DAME tax is not a panacea\u2014it is only one example of the Administration\u2019s efforts to fight climate change, reduce energy prices, and increase access to electrified options for all Americans. Similarly, it is just one example of the President\u2019s larger efforts to ensure the responsible development of digital assets, modernize their tax treatment, and mitigate risks to financial stability. Estimated to raise $3.5 billion in revenue over 10 years, the primary goal of the DAME tax is to start having cryptominers pay their fair share of the costs imposed on local communities and the environment."

        "title": "$194 Million was Moved Using Bitcoin With $0.1 Fee, Potential of Crypto - CCN.com",
        "content": "On October 16, a Bitcoin user moved 29,999 BTC worth $194 million with a $0.1 fee, a transaction which with banks would cost tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nAn often pushed narrative against cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum is that it is expensive to clear transactions due to fees sent to miners. However, the $194 million payment on the Bitcoin blockchain demonstrates the potential of consensus currencies to optimize cross-border payments significantly.\n\n$1 Million Through a Bank Costs $10,000+\n\nTransferwise is a UK-based multi-billion dollar firm that eliminates hidden fees in bank transfers. On the platform, users can send small to large payments through bank accounts with substantially lower fees.\n\nHowever, even on a platform like Transferwise, to send over $1 million, it costs over $7,500 in transaction fees. That means, through wire transfers and conventional banking methods, tens of thousands of dollars are required to clear a transaction that is larger than $1 million.\n\nPercentage-wise, $7,500 is less than 1 percent of $1 million, and in that sense, a $7,500 fee is cheap. But, on the Bitcoin network, which is supposedly highly inefficient in processing payments, it costs less than $0.1 to clear a $194 million transaction.\n\nOn October 14, publicly acclaimed cryptocurrency critic Nouriel Roubini, an economist and professor at Stern School, claimed that it costs $60 to process a Bitcoin transaction and as such, it costs $63 to purchase a Starbucks latte that costs $3, using Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cSo the cost per transaction of bitcoin is literally $60. So if I were to buy a $3 latte at Starbucks I would have to pay $63 to get it! So the myth of a \u2018Brilliant new technology that reduces the vast fees of legacy financial systems!\u2019 turns out to be a Big Fat Lie!\u201d Nouriel claimed.\n\nIn response, respected cryptocurrency investor and Blocktower co-founder Ari Paul stated that the transaction fee of Bitcoin, which is less than $0.1, is publicly verifiable on the blockchain.\n\n\u201cBTC fees are less than $0.10, easily verifiable. If you value truth, you\u2019d provide a public correction. If your goal is to mislead people with simply false statements, carry on. There\u2019s nothing to research. Fees are publicly viewable from many sources (googling it works.) I find it better not to provide a specific source because then regardless of source, the source gets attacked,\u201d Paul noted.\n\nCrypto Could Crack Offshore Banking Market First\n\nAs the scalability of public blockchain networks improves with the integration of both on-chain and second-layer scaling solutions, cryptocurrencies will be able to handle small payments with higher efficiency.\n\nBut, in the mid-term, given the ability of the blockchain to process large-scale payments at the same cost of a small transaction, it is highly likely that cryptocurrencies will gain wide acceptance by investors and firms in the offshore banking market, a $30 trillion industry that relies on financial institutions to clear large transactions.\n\nSpending $0.1 to $1 for a $5 to $10 transaction could be inefficient and impractical. However, spending the same fee to process multi-million dollar transactions provide cryptocurrencies a clear edge over legacy systems.\n\nCrypto\u2019s Effect on Other Markets\n\nWith the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies, several industries face drastic changes. Let\u2019s look at gambling as an example: Crypto gambling platforms have emerged to cater to the growing demand for more secure and anonymous forms of gambling.\n\nThese crypto casinos offer a wide range of games, like crypto slots, crypto plinko, and crash gambling that can be played using digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others. The use of cryptocurrencies in gambling provides several benefits, and one of those is the previously mentioned low transaction fee.\n\nImages from Shutterstock"

        "title": "Crypto foes gird to stop mines from 'spreading like cancer' - E&E News by POLITICO",
        "content": "In the wake of a national surge in crypto mining, local activists are searching for ways to fight the energy-intensive industry\u2019s rapid growth \u2014 and calling on Congress for backup.\n\nCrypto mines \u2014 banks of computers that run to obtain digital currency \u2014 can operate as much as 24 hours per day, seven days a week and, depending on their energy source, can spew significant levels of planet-warming gases.\n\nAfter China cracked down on crypto mining within its borders a year and a half ago, the industry has become a growing presence in communities with cheap electricity from hydropower \u2014 and also from more carbon-intensive sources like natural gas and coal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese miners are moving to the United States and spreading like cancer across the country,\u201d said Yvonne Taylor, one of the founders of the National Coalition Against Cryptomining, a new advocacy group uniting activists from Georgia to Washington state.\n\nShe added: \u201cWe had to do something on a national level.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, before China\u2019s crackdown on crypto mining, the United States accounted for just 3.5 percent of global mining of bitcoin, the leading type of cryptocurrency.\n\nBy 2022, that figure had jumped to 38 percent, and the United States is now home to a third of global crypto mining assets, according to a report from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP).\n\nThe crypto boom has led to a tripling of energy usage since 2021 \u2014 matching the amount of power needed to turn on the lights in every home in the United States.\n\nCrypto mining uses so much energy because banks of small computers are competing to solve complex math puzzles to win digital currency. The more computers running, the better the odds of making a profit.\n\nThat energy consumption is still under 2 percent of total U.S. electricity use, but the White House report warned that crypto\u2019s boom-and-bust cycles could continue to strain the grid just as the nation is aiming to slash emissions from the power sector.\n\nFor climate activists who find themselves living near a crypto mine, the lack of U.S. law governing the industry is a critical challenge. Communities cannot get a clear picture of where the facilities are located, and estimates of the sites\u2019 cumulative climate impact is uncertain.\n\nIn some places, crypto mining opponents warn that the facilities are bringing fossil fuel power plants back online or delaying their retirement. In other cases, critics say the facilities are draining so much power from renewable sources like hydroelectric dams that residents are not able to take advantage of those sources and are instead getting energy derived from fossil fuels.\n\nThe disruptions reach beyond climate impacts: People living near the facilities say the mines also require noisy fans and massive amounts of water to keep their servers cool.\n\nIn the absence of federal crypto mining laws, people living near the sites are taking a multipronged approach to fighting the facilities. Their options are driven by local and state regulation and range from changing or enforcing zoning codes to hiking energy costs for the mines.\n\nWhile opponents aren\u2019t immediately removing the facilities, they are laying the groundwork for future legal challenges against crypto mining.\n\nCrypto mining pollution has drawn the attention of some lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, reintroduced legislation in February aimed at collecting nationwide data on the industry\u2019s environmental impacts.\n\nPassage of the \u201cCrypto Asset Environmental Transparency Act\u201d would allow the federal government to collect data necessary for it to potentially establish efficiency standards for the industry, like those that currently exist for everything from air conditioners to automobiles. Failure to comply with efficiency standards, in turn, could provide grounds for litigation from crypto mining opponents.\n\n\u201cThis is an emergency, an urgent issue, and Congress needs to be proactive,\u201d Markey said in a recent congressional hearing.\n\nFederal action is crucial, Taylor said.\n\n\u201cThis cannot be a town-by-town or even a state-by-state fight,\u201d she said. \u201cThese miners are just going to pick up their machines and move them to a more friendly state. And that doesn\u2019t solve our climate problem.\u201d\n\nHarnessing state climate power\n\nAs Congress mulls federal action, crypto opponents in environmentally conscious states are leveraging new climate tools in an effort to push out mining operations.\n\nNew York environmentalists, for example, are invoking the state\u2019s 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act in their effort to block a crypto mine in the Finger Lakes region.\n\nGreenidge Generation Holdings Inc.\u2019s Torrey, N.Y., facility is built on the site of a former coal plant on the shores of Seneca Lake that the company converted in 2017 to burn natural gas.\n\n\u201cTo resurrect old power plants and suck up a lot of energy and make us more reliant on fossil fuels in the middle of this [climate] crisis is literally insane,\u201d said Taylor, whose New York-based group, Seneca Lake Guardian, is fighting the Greenidge facility.\n\nNew York passed a moratorium last year blocking any new crypto mines while the state evaluates their environmental effects, but the ban did not apply to Greenidge and another facility that were already permitted to operate in the state.\n\nIn June 2022, New York\u2019s Department of Environmental Conservation denied Greenidge\u2019s application to renew the air permit for its 107-megawatt capacity plant, citing the state climate law, which requires 40 percent overall emissions cuts by 2030. The company is appealing the decision before an administrative law judge, and the mine is continuing to operate in the meantime.\n\nIn response to the permit denial, Greenidge said it would slash emissions by 40 percent by the end of 2025 and would become a zero-carbon-emitting facility by 2035.\n\n\u201cWe can absolutely meet important climate goals, while generating new careers and harnessing all the potential of this industry, and our New York operation shows the path,\u201d Greenidge President Dale Irwin said in a statement.\n\nMandy DeRoche, deputy managing attorney at Earthjustice, said in an email that Greenidge\u2019s proposal for emissions reductions is \u201cspeculative and non-binding\u201d and \u201cmeaningless in terms of actual air pollution.\u201d She noted that even if the company followed through on the plan, it would still be allowed to emit nearly 350,000 tons of carbon dioxide each year. That\u2019s equivalent to the emissions from the electricity used to power about 67,000 homes for one year, according to EPA.\n\nGreenidge\u2019s permit denial came after environmental challengers made a number of unsuccessful attempts to get a court to block the project\u2019s water permits and overturn the Torrey Planning Board\u2019s 2020 approval for the facility. Despite the earlier losses, environmental groups are continuing to fight the project in federal court, this time over an alleged violation of the Clean Water Act.\n\nSeneca Lake Guardian and other groups allege in a lawsuit filed in January that the company failed to properly submit a renewal application to state officials for a water discharge permit.\n\nGreenidge maintains the issue belongs in state court, which has already ruled in its favor.\n\nThe company told a federal judge that the challengers\u2019 \u201cattempts to distort\u201d New York\u2019s requirements and discredit state officials\u2019 determination of the project are \u201cinapt.\u201d\n\nCalls for stronger state laws\n\nOn the other side of the country, activists are turning to state lawmakers for help to drive up the costs of crypto mining \u2014 and make their communities less attractive hosts for the energy-hungry facilities.\n\nBenjamin Richards, a 47-year-old retired Army officer, said residents in Pend Oreille County in northeastern Washington want to see a crypto mine owned by Chinese technology company Bitmain Technologies Ltd. and investment firm Allrise Capital Inc. leave their quiet community.\n\nBitmain purchased the bankrupt Ponderay Newsprint mill in Usk, Wash., last March, inheriting its water use and electricity permits for the 100-MW crypto mining facility.\n\nRichards said the mine requires three times more power than all the county\u2019s residents and other businesses combined. Although the county receives hydropower from the nearby Boundary Dam, Richards contested developers\u2019 claims that the crypto mine is powered by renewable energy.\n\nThe crypto facility\u2019s high energy demand means the public utility district has to purchase additional power each month from the Mid Columbia hub, a regional wholesale electricity market, he said in an email.\n\nNeither Bitmain nor Allrise could be reached for comment about the Usk crypto mine.\n\nAfter failing to dissuade county officials from approving the Bitmain project, Richards and other activists are hoping Washington legislators will pass H.B. 1416, which would amend the state\u2019s 2019 Clean Energy Transformation Act. The law requires utilities to ramp up clean energy purchases until they achieve the law\u2019s target of 100 percent zero-emission energy by 2045.\n\nBut the law does not apply to customer-owned utilities, like the Pend Oreille County Public Utility District, which provide half the electricity sold in Washington state. This has allowed industrial customers like the Bitmain crypto mine to purchase non-compliant power from out of state, said Richards.\n\nH.B. 1416 stipulates that non-residential users of customer-owned utilities \u2014 like crypto mines \u2014 also meet the state\u2019s clean electricity purchasing requirements. The bill passed the state House and Senate and has been delivered to the governor\u2019s desk to be signed into law.\n\nThe legislation comes after at least two public utility districts took their own steps to curb costs from crypto mining.\n\n\u201cThe bill would require the bitcoin mining facility to purchase source-specified power on the market, which would increase their power costs going forward,\u201d Richards said.\n\nGlenn Blackmon, a manager of the energy policy office at the Washington Department of Commerce, said the need for H.B. 1416 became evident after the state\u2019s clean energy law went into effect.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years an increasing interest in large new uses of electricity for things like hydrogen production, data centers [and] crypto mining operations,\u201d he said, \u201cand we realized that if any of those were located in areas served by consumer-owned utilities, the clean energy law wouldn\u2019t apply to them.\u201d\n\nStates embracing crypto mining\n\nIn states that have thrown their support behind crypto mining, opponents face even more of an uphill battle.\n\nMissouri and Mississippi are passing \u201cright to mine\u201d bills actively encouraging development of the sector. Kentucky has also passed incentives for crypto mining.\n\nThe fight is particularly challenging in Texas, where crypto mining accounts for 3 percent of local peak electricity demand, according to the White House OSTP report. Over the next decade, that could become a third of existing peak power demand in the state, the report said, posing challenges to electricity reliability.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott (R) has called for the Lone Star State to become a global leader in the industry, and it could soon be home to a facility that has been touted as one of the top digital cryptocurrency mining operations in the world.\n\nNot all Texans are ready to roll out welcome mats.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t even produce anything,\u201d said Jackie Sawicky, founder of Concerned Citizens of Navarro County and a member of the National Coalition Against Cryptomining. \u201cThey\u2019re a digital lottery guessing game that is being heavily subsidized by taxpayers and energy consumers.\u201d\n\nSawicky\u2019s community, located in Navarro County in the Dallas-Fort Worth region, is the planned site for the $333 million Expansion project developed by Colorado-based bitcoin mining company Riot Platforms Inc. The facility will come online later this year with 400 MW of capacity, with another 600 MW planned for the second phase of construction.\n\nThe operation would be powered by the Navarro switch, a high-voltage transmission line near the Corsicana, Texas, project site.\n\nSawicky said she and other residents are concerned about how the crypto mine is being incentivized and what that will mean for their energy bills. Securities and Exchange Commission filings from 2021, for example, show that a 700-MW facility run by Riot in Rockdale, Texas, outside of Austin has a power agreement that has locked in low-cost electricity rates until April 2030.\n\nWhile Sawicky has repeatedly reached out to local officials and requested dozens of documents related to the Corsicana facility, she said she doesn\u2019t know how she would challenge the crypto mine in court.\n\nThe broader problem, from environmentalists\u2019 perspective, is the way cryptocurrency is designed based on a decentralized system of transactions, called a blockchain. Building new blocks of that chain is what requires all the energy-intensive problem solving.\n\n\u201cWe will never get off of fossil fuels as long as the bitcoin blockchain exists,\u201d Sawicky said.\n\nEven if companies are using renewable energy sources, that zero-emitting power \u201ccould be used to make our costs lower,\u201d she said.\n\nRiot declined to discuss the specific tax incentives it received for developing the Corsicana mine but said in an emailed statement that agreements like those in place for its Rockdale facility don\u2019t exempt the company from paying taxes and are important for attracting jobs to rural areas.\n\n\u201cBased on our projects, we expect the development of the Corsicana Facility to directly lead to the creation of at least 250 full-time, high-wage jobs and will position Riot as one of the largest employers \u2014 and taxpayers \u2014 in Corsicana,\u201d the company said.\n\nRiot said its new project would drive \u201csignificant positive economic benefits\u201d to Navarro County, just as the Rockdale facility did in its community.\n\nThe company also said it is working with the Electric Reliability Council of Texas to prevent overloading the grid, and the Rockdale facility is providing a market for wind and solar energy during off-peak times that \u201cwould otherwise be wasted.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about community members\u2019 concerns about emissions resulting from its mining operations, Riot said it has \u201cno ability to control\u201d the energy mix in the grid.\n\n\u201cFurther, the company is constantly exploring alternative energy sources, including wind and solar self-generation, as its long-term plans focus on reducing cost of power,\u201d Riot said, \u201cand alternative energy generation is projected to be more cost effective than fossil fuel generation in the long-term.\u201d\n\nPush for new federal law\n\nFrustrated with the patchwork of regulatory responses to crypto mining across the country, community activists in recent months have turned up the volume on their calls for Congress to step in and craft environmental standards that would apply to the sector nationwide.\n\nAt least some federal lawmakers are paying attention.\n\nThe legislation reintroduced in February by Markey and Rep. Jared Huffman, a California Democrat, would bolster EPA oversight of crypto mining.\n\nIf passed, the bill would require crypto miners to disclose their emissions to EPA\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, establishing a federal database of the impact of the facilities. The White House OSTP report estimates that crypto mining contributes to less than 1 percent of total U.S. emissions but warns that the assessment is uncertain due to rapid fluctuations in the industry\u2019s energy consumption.\n\nThe legislation could also address uncertainty about the whereabouts of crypto mines. Developers aren\u2019t always clear about what they are trying to build in their permitting applications, said activists from several states.\n\nRob Altenburg, senior director for energy and climate at PennFuture, told lawmakers during a March congressional hearing that some companies have been plugging crypto mines directly into natural gas wellheads without obtaining permits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve asked regulators where the crypto mines are, and they can\u2019t really say with any degree of certainty,\u201d he said.\n\nIn some instances, developers have presented the proposed facilities as data or science centers, and it wasn\u2019t until after they were approved that residents became aware that they were, in fact, more energy-thirsty crypto mines, Earthjustice\u2019s DeRoche said.\n\n\u201cWhere communities have found success is when they are able to quickly galvanize together and get a lot of community involvement right away, before a crypto mine sneaks in,\u201d said Taylor of the National Coalition Against Cryptomining.\n\nThe coalition has praised Markey\u2019s proposed bill as an important first step, but activists want to see lawmakers take regulation even further by setting requirements for how crypto miners build digital ledgers.\n\nThe coalition is calling on Congress to limit the amount of energy that crypto mines can use, for example, by requiring a different system for building new blocks on the blockchain that ensures transactions are secure and not fraudulent.\n\nThe most energy-intensive way to build the blockchain is through the puzzle-solving process called proof-of-work. But blockchains can also be built without the same need for computational firepower through another process called proof-of-stake, which takes a fraction of the energy use. Instead of solving trillions of math problems, miners validate each new block, and \u201cstake\u201d an amount of cryptocurrency that they will lose if they improperly validate a block. Miners recoup their stake and receive a fee for correctly validating a new block in the blockchain.\n\nAt least one blockchain platform, ethereum, made that exact switch last year.\n\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t move away from proof-of-work crypto mining to a different form, then perhaps it ought to be banned,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of where we\u2019re at.\u201d\n\nElliot David, head of climate strategy at Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol, said trying to shift the entire industry away from the more energy-intensive proof-of-work process does not make sense.\n\nProof-of-stake is useful for things like smart contracts or securities, he said in an email, but bitcoin is meant to serve as money, which means the standard for security has to be higher and free from corruption.\n\nThe question should instead be how to use the energy-intensive process for verifying cryptocurrency transactions to boost development of renewables, he said.\n\nAs for federal regulation, David said, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with wanting transparency in the sector, though it seems that this industry is being singled out.\u201d\n\nDavid suggested the industry could also adopt a voluntary reporting model like the certification system of renewable-powered mining established by Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol.\n\n\u201cTransparency and climate should be bipartisan issues, and we believe there are market solutions to that end,\u201d David said.\n\nBut during a March Senate subcommittee hearing on crypto mining\u2019s environmental impact, Markey repeatedly noted the importance of independent oversight for the evolving industry.\n\n\u201cPeople who profit from bitcoin can\u2019t be left to grade their own homework,\u201d Markey said."

        "title": "Can Bitcoin's Halving Events Point to a Future Cryptocurrency Market Rally? - Nasdaq",
        "content": "In a landscape as volatile as crypto, there are very few trends that investors can follow with any degree of certainty. Despite its erratic nature, one of the cryptocurrency ecosystem\u2019s strongest trends has revolved around Bitcoin\u2019s halving events every four years.\n\nThe coin went on to smash through its all-time high values in the months that followed its previous halving events, and now with the next one set for 2024, could investors expect a fresh rally?\n\nThere are many reasons for cryptocurrency market speculators to be excited for a prospective Bitcoin (BTC) halving event. The market dominance of BTC means that any price rallies for the world\u2019s most famous crypto asset means that the entirety of the market is likely to experience a major bull run.\n\nAs Bitcoin\u2019s stock-to-flow model (where stock is the total existing supply of a commodity\u2014or a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin and flow is the new supply of the commodity or crypto that is created each year) shows, the cryptocurrency peaks at roughly the same stage in its halving cycle.\n\nShould this trend continue, we may see BTC surpass its most recent all-time high market values of November 2021 and soar to a considerably higher market price. But just how reliable is this metric? And what does a halving event actually involve? Let\u2019s take a deeper look at Bitcoin\u2019s halving cycles and what they actually mean for investors:\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin Halving Event?\n\nBitcoin undergoes a halving event approximately every four years. This sees the block rewards distributed to Bitcoin miners halve, hence its name.\n\nThis process will continue for many years until around the year 2140, when the total supply of BTC of 21 million is finally reached.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s halving events are significant because they mark another drop in the rate of new Bitcoins being produced on the way to reaching its total supply. At present, the number of BTC in circulation stands at just over 19.3 million, indicating that there are fewer than 1.7 million left to mine.\n\nWhen Bitcoin was launched in 2009, the reward for each block mined was 50 BTC, but the first halving event in 2012 saw this supply halved to 25. Subsequently, the 2016 halving event saw rewards cut to 12.5, and finally 6.25 in the most recent halving event on May 11, 2020.\n\nHowever, as the chart shows, each halving event brought a fresh Bitcoin rally in its wake. Following Bitcoin\u2019s 2016 halving, months of accumulation resulted in a new all-time high of $19,783.21 on December 17, 2017.\n\nIn the wake of the 2017 rally, Bitcoin and the wider market descended into a crypto winter until the 2020 halving event, which ultimately paved the way for a fresh all-time high of $69,044.77 in November 2021.\n\nSince its most recent peak, Bitcoin has descended into another crypto winter with harsh economic headwinds forcing the cryptocurrency to retrace at a significant rate. But should investors be optimistic for 2024\u2019s next halving?\n\nWhile Bitcoin is often referred to as \u2018digital gold,\u2019 the notion of the supply of gold being halved every four years would lead to unimaginable price rises. Should demand for Bitcoin continue to grow, this would logically mean that Bitcoin would continue to become more scarce in the face of demand.\n\nIs Bitcoin Heading to the Moon?\n\nWhile there are certainly a number of caveats to keep in mind, there\u2019s plenty of optimism that market commentators are drawing from Bitcoin\u2019s halving events.\n\n\u201c$180k; that\u2019s the target,\u201d stated Decentrader Crypto Analytics Founder \u2018FilbFilb\u2019 on Twitter. The user, who has amassed a following of more than 85,000 on Twitter, has based their calculations heavily on the Bitcoin halving event, which they believe will be a catalyst for a fresh all-time high for the cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cBitcoin halving is due for March 2024. If history is anything to go off then you have 18 months absolute max\u2026before we start doing all sorts of crazy stuff above the all-time high again,\u201d FilbFilb added.\n\nThis sentiment has also been echoed by famous CryptoQuant Analyst \u2018Plan B.\u2019 As a user who frequently utilizes Bitcoin\u2019s stock-to-flow model, Plan B took to Twitter to say that their metrics indicated a BTC value of over $32,000 at the time of Bitcoin\u2019s 2024 halving event, and an eventual 2025 bull market which will see BTC reach values in excess of $100,000.\n\nGiven that Bitcoin hasn\u2019t attained a value of more than $30,000 since June 2022, predictions of beyond $100k appear ambitious at first glance, but they\u2019re shared across the crypto ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIf the block rewards get cut in half to 3.125 from 6.25, then the price has got to double-ish in order for the miners to continue to make money,\u201d said Hedge Fund Manager Mark Yusko. \u201cTraditional assets are driven by economic growth, Fed policies, inflation. Crypto is driven by the technology itself, millennial adoption,\u201d Yusko added, noting that \u2018the laws of math\u2019 dictates that the upcoming halving event can push Bitcoin beyond $100,000.\n\nEmbracing a Changing Market\n\nIn cryptocurrency, perhaps more so than anywhere else, past performance should never be a guarantee for future performance. Bitcoin\u2019s halving event has held a strong correlation with market-wide rallies, but the most recent path to a new Bitcoin all-time high was buoyed by remarkably low Fed interest rates moving away from the Covid-19 pandemic which led to far greater levels of liquidity among investors.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin\u2019s recent rally was less pronounced than those before it, indicating that halving events may be weakening.\n\nHistorically, the cryptocurrency markets have maintained a correlation with traditional tech stocks. With this in mind, traders can generally look to the Nasdaq-100\u2019s performance to anticipate a change of fortunes in the likes of Bitcoin.\n\nInstitutional adoption can help to stabilize the volatility of Bitcoin, leading to better market sentiment and higher price rallies. The arrival of more institutions into the crypto landscape will also demand a more sophisticated market, powered by decentralized finance applications. In turn, paving the way for crypto\u2019s transition into more mainstream markets.\n\nSKARB offers a driving force for change within the cryptocurrency landscape for institutions, mitigating the prospect of counterparty risk in an ecosystem that\u2019s been blighted by the high-profile collapses of exchanges like FTX. Should a counterparty fail for whatever reason, it can result in high-profile reputational and economic damage, as well as causing institutions to lose out in terms of time, effort and productivity.\n\nThe unified system offered by SKARB empowers institutions by acting as an all-in-one toolset for trading across several popular exchanges. While upholding maximum levels of encryption, institutions will have the freedom to utilize the SKARB terminal to execute trades via a vast range of market makers.\n\nThrough consolidating all trades within one single app-based terminal, SKARB also enables institutions to effectively audit themselves as they build into the cryptocurrency ecosystem, helping them to become more efficient and effective. It\u2019s through platforms like this that institutional acceptance and greater crypto market stability can be assured.\n\nLooking to 2024\n\nIt certainly pays to err on the side of caution when it comes to identifying trends in crypto. However, Bitcoin\u2019s halving cycles point to one of the only trends on the market that\u2019s occurred three times and delivered fresh all-time highs each time.\n\nAlthough times are changing at a rapid pace in the world of cryptocurrency, decentralized finance and Web 3.0, the prospect of Bitcoin\u2019s upcoming price accumulation could be worth exploring on a deeper scale for institutional investors. Although there\u2019s certainly risk, Bitcoin\u2019s continued ability to confound its critics deserves more attention.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Biden Wants 30% Crypto Mining Tax, But Can It Work? - Investopedia",
        "content": "President Joe Biden has proposed an up to 30% tax on cryptocurrency mining aimed at deterring economic and environmental concerns, but experts say the plan would be tough to implement.\n\nKey Takeaways President Biden wants to tax up to 30% of crypto miners' electricity costs in three years as part of his proposed 2024 federal budget.\n\nThe White House said the tax was aimed at curbing environmental and economic concerns.\n\nThe tax would mostly affect bitcoin miners, as other major crypto networks use proof-of-stake (PoS) rather than proof-of-work (PoW).\n\nCritics of the tax proposal say that miners could easily move offshore to avoid taxation.\n\nThe White House Wants To Make Miners Pay\n\nIntroduced in President Biden's 2024 federal budget, the proposal for the Digital Asset Mining Energy (DAME) excise tax would tax up to 30% of crypto miners' electricity costs\u2014in 10% increments spread over three years starting January 2024. The tax, expected to raise about $3.5 billion over 10 years, is geared toward combating climate change.\n\n\"Currently, crypto mining firms do not have to pay for the full cost they impose on others, in the form of local environmental pollution, higher energy prices, and the impacts of increased greenhouse gas emissions on the climate. The DAME tax encourages firms to start taking better account of the harms they impose on society,\" the President's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) wrote in a statement Tuesday.\n\nThe CEA estimates crypto mining in the United States consumed as much electricity in 2022 as all the country's home computers or residential lighting.\n\nNotably, Biden's proposed tax on crypto mining would affect bitcoin more than the rest of the crypto market, as it is the only major crypto network that uses proof-of-work (PoW) as its underlying mechanism for achieving consensus. Other networks, such as Ethereum and BNB Chain, use an alternative method known as proof-of-stake (PoS), which uses much less energy.\n\n\n\nThe crypto industry, however, contends a large share of crypto mining relies on sustainable energy sources.\n\nWhile proponents of cryptocurrency tout enhancing financial inclusion, security, and transparency as its benefits, the CEA said crypto's \"broader social benefits have yet to materialize.\"\n\nChallenges In Implementing Crypto Mining Tax\n\nOf course, a key issue with any crypto-related tax policy is this industry is a global phenomenon. If taxes on crypto mining in the United States are too high, then miners could move to a more favorable jurisdiction. Especially, as the limited supply of bitcoin increases competition among miners and the rewards for mining bitcoin diminish.\n\nWhile the administration's plan acknowledges the risk of miners moving abroad it does little to ensure that mining operations do not shuffle between states in search of the lowest tax rates,\n\nCastle Island Ventures Founding Partner Nic Carter tweeted. New York, for example, banned bitcoin mining operations that use carbon-based energy last year. Among countries, China banned crypto mining in 2021.\n\n\"To ensure that crypto mining is not simply pushed from one local community to another, a national policy is needed,\" the CEA said.\n\n"

        "title": "Why Is Bitcoin Going Back Up? - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Throughout 2022, the economy at large saw some turbulence. But the cryptocurrency market, in particular, experienced a downward slide from its epic heights in 2021. Even the oldest surviving cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, saw its value tumble from over $60,000 to under $17,000.\n\nInvestors interested in cryptocurrency couldn\u2019t help but wonder when Bitcoin\u2019s value would bounce back. That time seems to have finally come. Bitcoin saw its price surge 20% in March, leading many to wonder what changed. This article will explore why this reversal is happening and whether we think it will continue.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nCurrently trading around $28,000, Bitcoin has recovered almost $10,000 in value since its trough at the beginning of 2023.\n\nMany factors contributed to the falling price of Bitcoin, including generally adverse economic conditions.\n\nWith some of the factors that pushed the price down now reversed, the value of Bitcoin is rising. Only time will tell if the trend continues.\n\nA Short History of Bitcoin\n\nWhen Bitcoin hit the market in 2009, it was unclear what to expect from an investment perspective. However, that didn\u2019t stop investors who understood the cryptocurrency\u2019s potential from jumping in.\n\nIn July 2010, Bitcoin saw its first big jump in price to $0.09. But the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency led to significant swings along the way. When we fast forward to 2020, Bitcoin started climbing to an all-time high of $67,566 in November 2021.\n\nOf course, this extreme spike in value had many investors excited. After all, who wouldn\u2019t want to add such a high-performing asset to their portfolio? Unfortunately for some investors, jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon in 2021 would become a big mistake.\n\nBitcoin in 2022\n\nSince that peak of roughly $68,000, Bitcoin has taken a tumble. In mid-November 2022, the cryptocurrency\u2019s value fell to around $16,700. That meant Bitcoin had lost over 70% of its value from a year before.\n\nBitcoin prices seemed bleak in 2022 compared to the previous year\u2019s highs. But compared to prices from 2019, the asset had still increased in value even at its end-of-2022 low point.\n\nWhat Pushed Bitcoin Down?\n\nAlthough Bitcoin\u2019s value experienced such a dramatic tumble in 2022, many seasoned crypto investors were used to the extreme volatility of this asset class. And the reality is that Bitcoin was not the only asset to see shocking volatility amidst 2022\u2019s market conditions.\n\nIf you\u2019re not someone who keeps tabs on the general economy, 2022 was a wild ride. Many factors hurting stock investors and everyday households also contributed to the volatility in the crypto market.\n\nOne of the major issues facing the economy was high levels of inflation. Inflation is typically caused by a mismatch of supply and demand. Companies will raise prices if demand for goods is unusually high or something interrupts supply chains. When an increase in prices is widespread across the economy, the Federal Reserve steps in.\n\nThe Federal Reserve approved a series of aggressive rate hikes across 2022 to curb inflation. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive and reduce consumers\u2019 discretionary spending. People save more and often sell off investments, anticipating poor performance from companies.\n\nCryptocurrency suffered plenty of bad press in 2022 due to the fallout of FTX. The collapse of the crypto exchange led to a loss of over $1 billion in consumer funds. Whenever a failure like this happens, crypto markets tend to suffer as investors are increasingly skeptical of the asset\u2019s stability.\n\nThe war between Ukraine and Russia also strained the global political world in 2022. Plus, mid-term elections kept the U.S. political landscape uneasy. These factors contributed to the financial turmoil we saw, which likely caused the negative slide in Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nHowever, historically, there has been an underlying debate about the inherent value of Bitcoin. Some investors are wary of using Bitcoin as a long-term store of value, while others are more confident that another coin, like Ethereum, might surpass Bitcoin\u2019s usefulness at some point.\n\nThe Value of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency representing an alternative to \u201cnormal\u201d fiat currency. A central bank controls fiat money, and it has value because the government decrees it has value. Consumers widely use it, and its value isn\u2019t tied to a specific commodity, like the gold standard.\n\nDespite being located in a digital space, it\u2019s important to remember that Bitcoins are limited in their supply and have an associated cost of production. Some people compare Bitcoins to precious metals because of their limited economic use. For example, you can\u2019t use Bitcoin or physical gold to pay at most retail stores.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin does have certain advantages over other currencies. Bitcoin is more mobile than paper money or precious metals because it\u2019s not physical. Bitcoin\u2019s underlying technology is decentralized and validated by various independent nodes. This makes Bitcoin particularly resistant to fraud efforts like counterfeiting.\n\nUntil people use Bitcoin in more commercial activities, most consumers will likely be skeptical of its value as money. If you\u2019re interested in the debate surrounding Bitcoin\u2019s value, you may be interested in reading more about theories of currency and the switch from the gold standard to fiat currency.\n\nInvestors Look Forward to 2023\n\nAs with any stock, we can\u2019t be 100% certain why Bitcoin\u2019s value increases or decreases, but there are better and worse theories. In 2022, investors thought of several ways Bitcoin stock could experience a rebound. Some of these possibilities included:\n\nLower interest rates: If interest rates started to fall, investors thought it would encourage Bitcoin\u2019s price to rise. That\u2019s because investors would be more willing to invest in riskier assets.\n\nReduced threat of a recession: The danger of an economic downturn loomed large in everyone\u2019s minds in 2022. With economic uncertainty baked into every investor decision, opting for a risky asset like Bitcoin likely didn\u2019t seem feasible.\n\nChanges to the federal regulation: In 2022, the federal government took more interest in regulating the crypto market. Reports were submitted to the President suggesting ways to take advantage of the new technology\u2019s benefits while minimizing risks. Action taken by the federal government could\u2019ve affected the coin\u2019s price.\n\nWider acceptance of crypto: Even in 2023, many potential users are wary of the value of crypto. As more people begin to accept crypto as a way to store and transfer value, Bitcoin\u2019s value will continue to climb.\n\nSome major players in the banking industry foresaw a Bitcoin rebound. Earlier in 2022, Deutsche Bank analysts forecasted that Bitcoin would return to a value of $28,000 by the end of the year. The same bank also predicted that Bitcoin could be the digital gold of the 21st century.\n\nWhy Did Bitcoin\u2019s Value Go Back Up?\n\nNow that the rebound is finally happening, most analysts\u2019 explanations relate to easing macroeconomic conditions. While the Fed has not started lowering rates, they have slowed. Most experts anticipate just one more rate hike in 2023. This is positive news for the stock market generally, but especially for riskier assets like Bitcoin, which seem like more unnecessary expenses when inflation is high and borrowing is expensive.\n\nBanks have also recently experienced heavy losses on different bond holdings. This has contributed to the Federal Reserve being more moderate with rate hikes lately.\n\nCentralized banking has also recently faced some skepticism with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. SVB\u2019s failure was partly caused by the bank\u2019s investments losing value, which triggered depositors to withdraw significant amounts of their money. In the aftermath, some publications argued cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are better suited to running a financial system, which could have contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s rise in price.\n\nOn the other hand, many considered SVB the backbone of the tech start-up world, so its failure led some experts to predict investors would move away from crypto assets. Also, Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank, two of the biggest lenders in the crypto space, recently announced closures. This made the rise in Bitcoin\u2019s price somewhat surprising. It suggested recent events did not shake investor confidence so dramatically.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rebound has outpaced growth in the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which is only up around 18.5% this quarter. Ethereum and Solana have also seen significant growth so far this year. Where these cryptos will go in the coming months remains to be seen, but with inflation slowly cooling off and interest rates potentially lowering later this year, experts are hopeful.\n\nInvesting In Crypto\n\nAs a speculative and volatile asset, investors should prepare to lose any money they put into cryptocurrency. We\u2019ve seen many crypto crashes in the last few years, and investors shouldn\u2019t take any investment \u2013 especially with crypto \u2013 as a guaranteed success.\n\nHowever, if you are ready to take on some risk, you can earn passive income with your crypto tokens through features like crypto staking, crypto lending, and crypto royalties.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBitcoin might be the most well-known cryptocurrency, but it is still subject to the extensive volatility that investors have come to associate with the crypto markets. The economy suffered in 2022, and it hit cryptocurrencies especially hard. Bitcoin lost considerable value from its high at the end of 2021, hitting a trough near the end of 2022. It has since rebounded, probably because of easing macroeconomic conditions and recent troubles in the centralized banking world.\n\nIf you\u2019re an investor building a portfolio of individual cryptocurrencies, keep your eye on current events. Don\u2019t take any investment as a guaranteed success, and learn about ways you can invest smartly and defensively in these ground-breaking new assets.\n\nThe post Why Is Bitcoin Going Back Up? appeared first on Due.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "A pseudonymous leftist Twitter account won $1 million from crypto investor Balaji Srinivasan over a bet on US inflation.\n\n\n\nHolly Newman Kroft: Quartz Smart Investing Part 2 CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish view video Is it time to sell your tech stocks?\n\nThe account\u2019s handle, @jdcmedlock, is nominally assigned to one James Medlock, but that isn\u2019t the user\u2019s real name. To their 83,000-odd followers, Medlock tweets frequently about economics, which is how they became embroiled in their bet with Srinivasan in March.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bet was announced after Medlock tweeted that he\u2019d bet anyone $1 million that the US wouldn\u2019t enter hyperinflation. Srinivasan, who had been warning about the risk of hyperinflation, took him up on the bet, setting a term of 90 days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTechnically, the bet wasn\u2019t precisely based on US hyperinflation. Rather, Srinivasan bet that bitcoin\u2014which he views as a hedge against inflation\u2014would be worth $1 million at the end of 90 days, its value rising as inflation spiraled upwards. Srinivasan did not seem to consider the possibility that bitcoin\u2019s value might also be wiped out in a hyperinflationary environment, the economics writer Noah Smith wrote on his blog.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately for B alaji Srinivasan, inflation is headed down\n\n\n\nWith the Federal Reserve bent on taming prices and cooling the economy, hyperinflation was a distant prospect. T he bet was extremely unlikely to go in Srinivasan\u2019s favor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe joke itself was that, in the event of hyperinflation, the million dollars wouldn\u2019t be worth very much anyways, so it was a no-lose situation,\u201d Medlock told Quartz over email. \u201cBut hyperinflation is extremely rare, usually happening in times of conflict or institutional collapse. With the US dollar being the global reserve currency and our institutions being relatively stable, hyperinflation today would be without precedent. In fact, a banking crisis might end up being deflationary, as the loss of deposits would reduce demand.\u201d\n\nThe bet was set on March 17, but it was settled early. Srinivasan did not immediately respond to a request for comment about why he had paid out well before the 90-day term, but it appeared to be his way of making a point. \u201cI spent my own money to send a provably costly signal that there\u2019s something wrong with the economy, and that it\u2019s not going to be merely a financial crisis, but a fiat crisis,\u201d Srinivasan w rote in a blog post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMedlock, a self-described \u201ctax enthusiast,\u201d plans to pay an effective tax rate of 70%. Taxes on the winnings will only total $240,000, but Medlock has already given $500,000 of the money to Give Directly, a poverty charity. Srinivasan gave an additional $500,000 to bitcoin core developers, bringing the bet\u2019s total value to $1.5 million.\n\nMedlock has plans for the rest of the money. \u201cI\u2019ll pay off some debt, build a nice cat house for my neighborhood feral, and invest in a much better investment than BTC, namely low-fee index funds.\u201d"

        "title": "Is Block Stock a Buy After Diversifying Into Bitcoin Mining? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It's been a disappointing year so far for Block Inc. (SQ 4.91%). The year started with a mini-rally in January and February, but a controversial short-selling report from Hindenburg Research in March has weighed heavily on Block's fortunes. Heading into May, Block is basically back at square one. The stock started the year trading at $62.84 and currently trades at $60.79.\n\nBut Block now has a new plan to turn things around and woo back investors, and it involves Bitcoin (BTC 1.18%) mining. Yes, that's right, the company that is best known for its Square payments technology and the Cash App is now diversifying into Bitcoin mining. Given Bitcoin's epic rally this year (up about 70% year to date), there's certainly reason to be optimistic. So let's take a closer look.\n\nWhy Bitcoin mining?\n\nAt first glance, diversification into Bitcoin mining would not seem to offer any synergies with Block's existing product offerings. But dig a bit deeper, and the strategy actually starts to make more sense. For one, Block already holds a tremendous amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. According to CoinGecko, Block now holds nearly $230 million worth of Bitcoin, which ranks fourth among all publicly traded companies. To put that into context, Block holds almost as much Bitcoin as cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global.\n\nSecondly, the company's Cash App offers users the opportunity to buy, sell, send, or receive Bitcoin. While the bearish Hindenburg Research report questioned how many people were actually doing this, as well as the potentially nefarious uses for this app, it's easy to see that Block is no stranger to Bitcoin and crypto payments. With Bitcoin becoming more and more mainstream, it makes sense that Cash App stands to benefit from the current Bitcoin rally.\n\nBlock's Bitcoin mining strategy\n\nIt's important to note that Block only plans to manufacture the chips and related hardware for Bitcoin mining -- it does not plan to do the actual mining itself. While Block has been involved in a few high-profile Bitcoin mining projects, the ultimate goal is to become an Intel (INTC -4.44%) for Bitcoin mining chips. Block has plenty of experience designing chips for its Square payment processing solutions and says it has revolutionary new technology on deck that will soon be ready for custom-made Bitcoin chips.\n\nTo jump-start its Bitcoin mining strategy, Block recently bought a huge supply of Bitcoin mining chips from (who else?) Intel, which is winding down its operations. Intel plans to discontinue its Bitcoin mining chip operations by April 2024, and Block is more than happy to fill the void. Block plans to offer its own high-end Bitcoin mining chips and mining hardware by early next year. In doing so, it will go head-to-head with a handful of companies that dominate the space.\n\nPros and cons\n\nWill the potential synergies actually materialize? If you're an optimist, then you believe that Block can somehow integrate the new Bitcoin mining operations into its other core operations. Theoretically, the more that Block can do to boost Bitcoin adoption, the better it is for its stock price. In short, the logic goes something like this: Rising Bitcoin prices lead to rising fortunes for Bitcoin miners, who will be more likely to buy Bitcoin mining chips from Block. At the same time, rising Bitcoin prices will pump up the value of Bitcoin on Block's balance sheet and convince more people to use the Cash App for Bitcoin. This, too, should boost the overall value of Block stock.\n\nIf you're a pessimist, however, it's easy to see how things could go very wrong. Bitcoin mining is a cyclical business, and there's a good reason why Intel is getting out of the business of manufacturing Bitcoin chips. In good times, it's a good business to be in. But in bad times, not so much. So, if you believe in Bitcoin mining for Block, then you also have to believe that Block is smarter than Intel right now.\n\nShould you buy Block stock?\n\nRight now, there are too many questions swirling around Block to make it a buy. In my opinion, Block still hasn't fully addressed all of the questions in the controversial Hindenburg Research report. And, from my perspective, the claim that Block is going to somehow \"disrupt\" Bitcoin mining sounds a bit too hyperbolic. The fact that Intel got into and then out of the Bitcoin mining business in just 12 months should be a red flag for investors.\n\nFor that reason, I can not recommend Block as a buy right now. While I'm super-bullish on Bitcoin for the long term, I just don't think Bitcoin mining is the right strategy for Block right now."

Moroccan customs consider the use of cryptocurrency to be an illegal transfer of funds.\n\nHe was incarcerated in December 2021 for \"fraud\" and \"payment with foreign currency on Moroccan territory\" and sentenced last October to 18 months in prison \u2013 on top of which he received a fine of around \u20ac3.4 million.\n\nThe proceedings were initiated following a complaint of \"fraud\" filed by a French woman, resident in Casablanca, who had sold him a Ferrari in exchange for a Bitcoin payment worth \u20ac400,000.\n\nClausi was also the subject of another complaint, this time from a Moroccan citizen who accused him of signing a bad check in the name of a third person \u2013 obtained by the young Frenchman in exchange for Bitcoin \u2013 to buy three luxury watches. The court ordered him to compensate the owner of the watches to the tune of 40,000 dirhams (\u20ac3,900).\n\n\"He has one month and a few days left in prison\", noted Aghanaj.\n\nAccording to Clausi's father, the young man, who hails from Moselle in eastern France, had moved to Morocco with a plan to create a neobank in Africa.\n\nEarlier this year, Moroccan authorities extradited another French citizen to the US to face criminal charges related to cybercrimes.\n\nS\u00e9bastien Raoult is suspected of being a member of a hacker group known as ShinyHunters, a \"black hat\" group alleged to have stolen and sold data from numerous major companies."

As we look to the next few months, we expect Washington to be fully energized, which will bump our hashrate as we maintain our competitive edge in these tight market conditions. We are looking forward to sharing our quarterly performance in more detail, including some exciting updates on our expansion plans in Washington and Sandersville, on our earnings call next week.

We expect to maintain that edge as the pace of deliveries for the newly released S19J Pro+ machines ramp up and are installed at our Sandersville and Washington facilities. Later this year, Sandersville will also host the bulk of the XPs, 45,000 in total, that we announced a few weeks ago, accelerating important upgrades to our fleet efficiency.\u201d\n\nApril Bitcoin Mining Update (unaudited)\n\nBitcoin mined in April: 524\n\nCY2023 bitcoin mined: 2,395\n\nTotal BTC holdings as of April 30: 313\n\nTotal BTC converted for operations and growth in April: 407\n\nCurrently deployed fleet of about 67,700 latest-generation bitcoin miners with a hashrate of 6.7 EH/s\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Company funded growth and operations through the sale of 407 bitcoins in April 2023 at an average of approximately $29,000 per BTC.

        "content": "MicroStrategy hinted that it could sell some of its Bitcoin (BTC) holdings to fund its long-term debt obligations in the aggregate of $2.208 billion, whose principal is due by 2025.\n\nAccording to its May 1 filing, MicroStrategy has long-term cash requirements for obligations related to its operating leases, transition tax, and various purchase agreements. The firm added:\n\n\u201cWe have principal due upon maturity of our long-term debt instruments in the aggregate of $2.208 billion in addition to $2.4 million in coupon interest due each semi-annual period for the 2025 Convertible Notes, $15.3 million in coupon interest due each semi-annual period for the 2028 Secured Notes, and $0.1 million due monthly in principal and interest related to our other long-term secured debt.\u201d\n\nThe business intelligence platform said it does not expect the cash and equivalents generated by its enterprise analytics software business to be sufficient to satisfy these debt obligations.\n\nDue to this, the firm said it would explore different options, which include borrowing against its BTC or the outright sales of some of its holdings.\n\nOther options available to the firm include refinancing the debt obligations, sourcing cash from other sources like issuing and selling shares of its class A common stock, or even settling the Convertible Notes obligations under certain unnamed conditions.\n\nIn December 2022, MicroStrategy sold some of its BTC holdings for the first time since it began accumulating. At the time, the company said it sold the assets to generate tax benefits.\n\nHowever, it has since gone on an accumulation spree this year. During the first quarter, it purchased 7,500 BTC, pushing its total Bitcoin holding to 140,000 BTC \u2014 more than the bankrupt crypto exchange Mt. Gox.\n\nMeanwhile, MicroStrategy\u2019s BTC acquisition approach has enticed several traditional financial institutions to buy its stocks to gain indirect exposure to the flagship digital asset. According to chairman Michael Saylor, the company shares have risen by 166% since it adopted the BTC standard in 2020 \u2014 outperforming other assets like Gold, Nasdaq, S&P 500, etc.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Here's Why I Won't Stop Buying Bitcoin - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The Bitcoin halving is a process that occurs every four years, and involves cutting the number of Bitcoins that miners receive as rewards in half. The next Bitcoin halving is expected to occur in April or May 2024, roughly a year from now.\n\nWhile the event may seem insignificant, it has historically been followed by significant price increases in Bitcoin, and this presents an excellent opportunity for investors to buy Bitcoin today and potentially benefit from the price increase that follows.\n\nWhy the halving matters\n\nThe halving process is a critical part of what makes Bitcoin so unique and is used to manage the supply of coins entering circulation. Hardwired into its code, roughly every four years (or after 210,000 blocks have been added to the blockchain) this halving event takes place and reduces the number of Bitcoins awarded to miners, which is the primary way new coins are created.\n\nEssentially, the halving process creates scarcity of Bitcoin, which in turn drives up the price of the cryptocurrency. As the supply of Bitcoin becomes more limited, demand usually goes up, leading to an increase in price. This is very different from the process of splitting a stock, which simply divides the same asset into a larger number of smaller slices. Halving is a fundamental change to the relative value of each new Bitcoin in a strictly controlled total market.\n\nInitially, the mining reward was a whopping 50 Bitcoins. But since then, there have been two more halvings and today the mining reward sits at 6.25 Bitcoins. However, this number is set to change once again in about a year when Bitcoin undergoes its next halving -- and that's the main reason I won't stop buying Bitcoin today.\n\nWhat the numbers say\n\nBy looking at Bitcoin's historical price roughly a year before and after each halving event, you can see a pattern of significant price increases.\n\nWhile buying Bitcoin at the time of each halving would provide considerable returns, the most lucrative returns are made when buying in preparation for the halving, especially when it's a year away.\n\nIn the time between a year before and after the first halving in November 2012, it rose more than 43,000% when it climbed from roughly $2.50 to nearly $1,100. The next halving was in July 2016 and, while not as significant an increase, it was still extremely lucrative. As a result of this halving, Bitcoin increased from $280 to around $2,225, a 640% increase. And finally, the most recent halving. A year before May 2020, Bitcoin's price was a measly $6,975. But a year after the halving, it ascended 609% to reach a price of $49,500.\n\nWhile hindsight is always 20/20, the numbers don't lie. A year before an upcoming halving has proven to be a great time to buy Bitcoin while its price remains discounted. And it seems like this remains the case today. This is a planned event that adds a straightforward amount of value to existing Bitcoins, so I'm not trying to time an unpredictable market. Of course, the price trend could take different turns this time as investors adapt to the well-documented halving effect, but the larger point remains the same: Bitcoin should become more valuable over time due to its limited supply.\n\nThe game plan\n\nDespite its strong rally to start off 2023, rising more than 70%, Bitcoin's price is still a far cry from its all-time high of more than $68,000. While the first halving was likely an outlier due to its massive price appreciation (43,000%), if Bitcoin were to make a similar return to the last two halvings of around 600%, that would see it reach a price tag of more than $200,000.\n\nThis may sound like trying to time the market, but in reality, it's quite the opposite. While buying a year before the halving and selling a year after might seem like a foolproof way to generate some returns, there are potential gains missed out.\n\nIn reality, the true goal is to buy and hold for multiple halving cycles. If past trends continue, then the longer you hold on to those precious Bitcoins, the more likely they are to appreciate at a rate few other assets can even come close to. For that reason alone, Bitcoin is worth heavy consideration with its heavily discounted price and the next halving set for next year."

Under his view, investors will rush to secure the value of their rapidly-depreciating dollars in Bitcoin, rapidly driving the value of the asset to reach a price of $1 million.\n\nThe high-profile wager was initiated on March 17 following a disagreement between Srinivasan and pseudonymous Twitter user James Medlock. Medlock initially tweeted that he would bet someone $1 million that the U.S. dollar would not enter any state of hyperinflation.\n\nRelated: How can Bitcoin hold $28K amid the banking crisis?\n\nThe conditions of the bet stipulated that if Bitcoin\u2019s price failed to reach $1 million by June 17, Medlock would receive $1 million in the dollar-pegged stablecoin USD Coin (USDC) as well as an additional 1 BTC. On the contrary, if the price of an individual Bitcoin were to be valued at $1 million by the same date, then Balaji could keep the 1 BTC and the $1 million in USDC.\n\nI will take that bet.\n\nYou buy 1 BTC.\n\nI will send $1M USD.\n\nThis is ~40:1 odds as 1 BTC is worth ~$26k.\n\nThe term is 90 days.\n\nAll we need is a mutually agreed custodian who will still be there to settle this in the event of digital dollar devaluation.\n\nIf someone knows how to do this\u2026 https://t.co/hhPr522PQu pic.twitter.com/6Aav9KeJpe \u2014 Balaji (@balajis) March 17, 2023\n\nBitcoin is currently trading for just over $28,700 and has a market capitalization of $556 billion, according to Cointelegraph data.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin in Senegal: Why is this African country using BTC?"

The market cap of BRC-20 tokens has exploded over the past month and currently sits at $120 million, a 600% rise in the past week.\n\nBRC-20 tokens marketcap.

The number of BRC-20 transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain between April 29 and May 2 reached over 50%, outperforming regular BTC transactions.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin metrics to the moon: ATH for hash rate, daily transactions and Ordinals\n\nThe BRC-20 token volume peaked on May 1 at 366,000 transactions, with the total number of transactions on the network being 2.36 million.\n\nBRC-20 tokens transaction volume.

        "content": "The total fees paid for Ordinal inscriptions topped 272 BTC, around $7.6 million on Tuesday, according to a Dune Analytics dashboard. On Monday alone, over 372,000 inscriptions were created on the Bitcoin network\u2014contributing to a daily record 682,281 Bitcoin transactions\u2014with daily network fees hitting 23 BTC, or around $656,000.\n\nI can't believe my eyes BRC-20 demand leading to a 700% increase in fees AFTER what we've seen with Ordinal Inscriptions 12,800% increase in fees from BEFORE Ordinal Inscriptions launched 300,000 unconfirmed transactions in the mempool pic.twitter.com/oyLceu6ODe \u2014 trevor.btc @ NYC (@TO) May 2, 2023\n\n\u201cMost of the acceleration is BRC-20,\u201d Trevor Owens, Managing Partner at Bitcoin Frontier Fund, told Decrypt. The BRC-20 token standard made minting tokens and meme coins on the Bitcoin network possible, clearing the path for over 1 million more inscriptions to be added to the over 2.5 million already on the Bitcoin network in less than a week.\n\nIntroduced in March, BRC-20\u2014or Bitcoin Request for Comment number 20\u2014allowed the creation of fungible tokens using the Ordinals protocol launching a new wave of interest in minting NFT-like assets on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nBut while JPEGs are flooding the network, most inscriptions are still text-based.\n\n\u201cText inscriptions are lower cost since you pay based on the size of the data,\u201d Owens said. \u201cSo they are low-cost high volume, whereas JPEGs and digital media is high cost, low volume.\u201d\n\nCurrently, the memory usage on the Bitcoin network is over 650 MB, double the initial 300 MB capacity, indicating a higher demand for computer memory due to the increased transactions and fuller blocks, according to data from Mempool. This increase may make running a node more challenging, but Ordinals proponents say it secures and strengthens the network.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cAs long as the value gained from minting BRC-20 tokens is higher than the value lost to the inscription fees, we will see fees on Bitcoin continue to climb,\u201d pseudonymous Twitter user @LeonidasNFT said, adding that higher fees on Bitcoin are a very good thing.\n\n\u201cIt indicates strong demand for Bitcoin\u2019s block space, which is critical for the long-term success of the protocol,\u201d Leonidas said. \u201cThe days of only using Bitcoin to transfer BTC to your hardware wallet once every few years have come to an end.\u201d\n\nBitcoin NFT Mints Surpass 200K\u2014But Is Interest in Ordinals Fading?\n\nHigh fees benefit the Bitcoin blockchain by incentivizing miners, prioritizing valuable transactions, and enhancing network security. However, while loading up the Bitcoin blockchain with JPEGs and sending fees skyrocketing may be good for miners and the network\u2019s security, it puts a higher price tag on transactions on the network.\n\n\u201cIn February, we inscribed the Taproot Wizards collection, which took over 80MB of Bitcoin block space,\u201d Taproot Wizards tweeted. \u201cBut now bitcoin transaction fees are so high, that if we tried inscribing the 80MB of wizards today, the fees would\u2019ve cost us 32 BTC. Almost $1 million dollars.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think this is the best thing that could have happened to Bitcoin,\u201d Owens said, pointing out that the launch and development of Ordinals did not require changing the Bitcoin base protocol. \u201cWe\u2019ve unlocked new use cases to bring in liquidity, new users, and lots of developers making Bitcoin more valuable through better user experience and more use cases is what we need to reach mass adoption.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has room to drop below $25,000 to flush out a recent influx of speculators, research shows.\n\nIn the latest edition of its weekly newsletter, \u201cThe Week On-Chain,\u201d analytics firm Glassnode flagged the ongoing influence of \u201cshort-term holders\u201d (STHs) on BTC price action.\n\nProfitability reset point lies below $25,000\n\nBTC/USD has struggled to overcome $30,000 resistance in recent weeks, and multiple fakeouts have frustrated Bitcoin bulls.\n\nIn its latest investigation into on-chain activity, Glassnode revealed that market newcomers may be responsible \u2014 speculative behavior, including profit-taking, has become prevalent in 2023.\n\nAmong the metrics contributing evidence is market value to realized value (MVRV), which tracks spot price and the on-chain cost basis of specific investor segments. STH-MVRV reflects the relationship as it impacts STHs, defined as those hodling Bitcoin for 155 days or less.\n\n\u201cThe weekly average of this indicator, helps to identify the possibility of short-term corrections, typically seen when STH-MVRV is above 1.2, signalling a 20% unrealized profit.

Source: Glassnode\n\nFor that to complete, however, BTC/USD would need to fall to $24,400.\n\n\u201cRecent resistance was found at the $30k level, corresponding with STH-MVRV hitting 1.33, and putting new investors at an average 33% profit,\u201d Glassnode continued.\n\n\u201cShould a deeper market correction develop, a price of $24.4K level would bring a STH-MVRV back to a break-even value of 1.0, which has shown to be a point of support in up-trending markets.\u201d\n\nBacking up STH-MVRV is a similar trend in the ratio of short-term holder unrealized profit versus loss. This, too, favors $24,400 as a bullish inflection point.\n\nBitcoin STH supply profit/loss ratio annotated chart (screenshot).

As the photo suggests, Harmon spent part of those funds showing off at nightclubs in Miami and Northeast Ohio.\n\nclick to enlarge U.S. Department of Justice Screenshot showing Harmon's $100,000 withdrawal in single dollars, among other party plans.\n\nAfter laundering millions of dollars in stolen Bitcoin currency, souping up his Lamborghini, \"making it rain\" at strip clubs in Ohio and Florida and splurging on luxury real estate, Gary Harmon was sentenced to four years and three months in prison last Thursday, the Department of Justice announced.His brother, Larry Dean Harmon, was arrested in February 2020 for running a money laundering service on the Dark Web called Helix. Gary Harmon attempted to use keys to Helix's wallets to re-transfer the funds \u2014 712 Bitcoins \u2014 that were seized by the FBI and the IRS' Cyber Crime Unit in Washington, D.C.\"The defendant\u2019s actions in this case cannot be dismissed as a momentary lapse of judgment or a crime of opportunity,\" U.S. attorneys wrote in a sentencing memo filed in Federal court April 13th. Gary Harmon \"sat on the cryptocurrency for months, with ample time to return the funds\u2014whether by coming clean to the government directly, relaying the funds through his brother or his brother\u2019s attorney, or by anonymously remitting the assets to the government.When Gary Harmon was interrogated about the recovery attempt, he told agents, \u201cif I took it, why wouldn\u2019t I take it all,\u201d the memo said, \"and stated that he received a thumb drive from his brother containing partial recovery seed phrases and had flushed the thumb drive down a toilet.\"In August 2021, Larry Harmon pleaded guilty to operating a money laundering service for, the memo said, those entrenched in \"illegal goods and services.\" By charging a 2.5 percent fee per transaction, Larry accumulated 4,877 bitcoin in 16 wallets.In sum, the DOJ determined Helix laundered $311 million on behalf of its customers. Because Gary Harmon had knowledge of the keys needed to access those funds on his brother's Treznor device\u2014a sort of safe for Bitcoin enthusiasts\u2014he was in a position to effectively recreate the wallets seized by government agents.By day, it seems, Gary Harmon penchant for crypto seemed to contribute to an honest career in tech.According to a resum\u00e9 posted on LinkedIn , Harmon worked at CoinNinja , an Akron-based startup that aids in Bitcoin wallet security and management. He graduated from Kent State University in 2014,with a degree in exercise science.\"Highly motivated junior software engineer with two years of experience in both front-end and back-end web development,\" Harmon wrote on LinkedIn , suggesting he could \"help high performing teams build disruptive solutions.\"By the summer of 2021, months after his brother's conviction, Gary Harmon indulged in a high-rolling lifestyle. According to the DOJ, in one weekend in June, Harmon spent $25,000 to book a five-hour \"whale room\" at a Miami nightclub, put down $15,000 in dancer fees and bought $100,000 in single-dollar bills using the Bitcoin transfers. (Those he'd use to fill a bathtub, setting the stage for the photo at the top of this story.)But he was worried: \"Anxiety just went thru the rough [],\" Gary Harmon texted a friend on June 14, 2021.\"About what?\" the friend said.\"Just blowing money bring to [] much heat to me.\"Harmon was indicted 14 days later, on June 28, 2021, on eight counts of money laundering, one count of obstruction and one count of removing property to prevent seizure. He was arrested exactly a month later.Following the DOJ's recommendation to the court that Harmon be sentenced for \"51 to 63 months,\" he is set to finish his prison term in the summer of 2027."

        "title": "Combining ordinals with ZK technology: The future of 'smart' Bitcoin? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The rise of ordinals on Bitcoin (BTC) has opened many doors for developers and users. By permanently inscribing data on the Bitcoin blockchain, digital objects like art can have verifiable ownership. However, not only digital art objects can benefit from this development. Domain addresses are also possible using this technology.\n\nUntangling public wallet keys\n\nSending and receiving transactions over the blockchain has many advantages. Some of these include the verifiability of transactions and the immutability of the blockchain. Thanks to the blockchain, digital value can be transacted in perpetuity, like a person handing over a physical dollar bill to someone else.\n\nHowever, using the technology is not so simple for everyone. Users need a certain amount of knowledge about how blockchain and their wallets work, and they also need to know how to securely send crypto to a wallet.\n\nOne of the difficulties users might experience is that public keys can be quite intimidating. They are long strings of seemingly random numbers and letters. One mistake and the crypto is either lost or ends up in the wrong wallet. And with the immutability of the blockchain, there is no way to get it back.\n\nWhere there is a need, developers get to work. One of the popular projects that aim to make crypto transactions more user-friendly is Ethereum Name Service (ENS). This platform turns these complicated wallet addresses on Ethereum into easily readable domain names, just like any website.\n\nFor a long time, however, it was impossible to integrate a comparable solution for the Bitcoin network.\n\nA step toward \u2018smart\u2019 Bitcoin\n\nThis all changes with BTCDomain. The platform uses ordinals and zk-STARKs, short for \u201czero-knowledge Succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge,\u201d to generate unique domain addresses that can be used on the Bitcoin network. But how does it work under the hood?\n\nIn essence, ordinals are unique inscriptions in transactions on the Bitcoin network. In this way, ordinals are verifiable using a blockchain explorer. BTCDomain uses this approach to associate Bitcoin domain addresses. The platform contains all the necessary metadata within a Bitcoin transaction. When a user sends BTC to one of the registered domains, for example, \u201csatoshi.btc,\u201d the platform resolves the underlying public key so that the BTC ends up at the correct address.\n\nTo ensure that this happens correctly, users should be able to trust that the system is resolving the transaction correctly. This is where the zk-STARK technology comes in.\n\nOne of the options is for users to run a full Bitcoin node in combination with an ordinal database on their own machine. While this is possible, it requires some technical skills and time. BTCDomain solves this problem by resolving a transaction using the resources of the platform. It inspects each Bitcoin transaction and generates a zero-knowledge proof. Users can then confirm that the domain address holds the underlying public key they are sending BTC to.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, with the latest Miami update, BTCDomain now allows users to inscribe their own website on the Bitcoin network. Thanks to the update the platform can automatically resolve domain names to the dedicated web2 website. For example, if a user owns ordinal.btc and builds an html file and inscribes it on the Bitcoin network, BTCdomain can automatically show this website on ordinal.btc.page.\n\nCriticism against ordinals\n\nHowever, the use of ordinals on Bitcoin has drawn criticism. Due to its growing popularity, the network\u2019s activity increased significantly. In turn, this led to higher transaction fees, leading critics to oppose the use of the Bitcoin network for anything other than financial transactions. Founder of BTCDomain Jay Lee is a firm believer that it is everyone\u2019s own choice what they do with Bitcoin: \u201cEveryone could always use Bitcoin as a financial transaction chain. We (who believe in \u2018smart\u2019 Bitcoin) don\u2019t affect any original use of Bitcoin. Someone might argue ordinals have pushed transaction fees higher. But we are in a free market. Whoever pays the highest gas fee rate gets included in a block. It is fair.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lee, BTCDomain brings \u201csmart Bitcoin\u201d closer by showing developers that it is possible to build trustless applications that rely only on Bitcoin. This could lead to a thriving decentralized finance sector built on the Bitcoin blockchain in the future.\n\nLearn more about BTCDomain"

        "content": "Litecoin (LTC) can make some big gains versus Bitcoin (BTC), particularly as its August halving event gets closer, according to Litecoin\u2019s creator Charlie Lee.\n\nLitecoin up 85% since record lows versus Bitcoin\n\nLee argues that LTC/BTC could rally to 0.025 BTC, or over 700%, in the next bull cycle, with Litecoin having \u201chigher throughput by design, scalability with extension blocks, better fungibility and privacy from MWEB [MimbleWimble].\u201c\n\n\u201cI can see an upside target of 10% (0.025 LTC/BTC). In the next bull market, 5% (0.0125) shouldn\u2019t be too hard to achieve. I honestly don\u2019t see it going much below 1% (0.0025) on the downside. The next halving will be in ~92 days. This is going to be fun.\u201c\n\nHis statements appeared after Litecoin\u2019s 85% price recovery from its record low of 0.001716 BTC in June 2022. LTC is still down about 90% below its record high of 0.051 BTC from November 2013, owing to rising competition in the altcoin market.\n\nLTC/BTC daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nLitecoin halving looms\n\nLTC\u2019s recovery in recent months has been accompanied by growing buzz around its upcoming block reward halving.\n\nThe Litecoin block reward to miners will be cut by 50% from 12.5 LTC to 6.25 LTC sometime in August 2023.\n\nAs a result, new LTC supply will drop by 50%, which should, at least in theory, make LTC more scarce on the market and, therefore, drive up its price.\n\nHistorically, the months leading to Litecoin halving typically prompted traders to accumulate LTC. For instance, the first halving event in August 2015 preceded a 450% price rally versus Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, the months before the second halving event saw limited gains as Bitcoin\u2019s crypto dominance grew amid the United States-China trade war. But, as a rule, LTC/BTC falls sharply after halving events, and the same could happen after August 2023.\n\nLTC price technicals hint at a similar scenario, with LTC/BTC printing what appears to be a bear flag pattern, as shown below.\n\nLTC/BTC three-day price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe pair may bounce toward the upper trendline of its bear flag, which coincided with the 50-3D exponential moving average (50-3D EMA; the red wave) near 0.0035 BTC ahead of the halving. But its bear flag target sits around 0.0024 BTC, down 20% from current price levels.\n\nLitecoin price to $100 by June?\n\nLitecoin has fared better versus the U.S. dollar in the months leading up to the last two halvings. LTC\u2019s price grew about 250% ahead of the first halving and 500% ahead of the second when measured from their sessional lows, respectively.\n\nLTC/USD monthly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe price has undergone a similar upside trajectory ahead of the August halving, with LTC up 120% from its sessional low of around $40. And it may continue to rise in the coming months, based on a mix of technical and on-chain indicators.\n\nFor instance, Litecoin is undervalued relative to its fair value, according to Glassnode\u2019s MVRV-Z score of -0.139.\n\nRelated: Why is Litecoin price up today?\n\nThe MVRV-Z score represents the ratio between the market and realized cap. When the market value is significantly higher than realized value, it historically indicates a market top (red zone). Meanwhile, the opposite indicates market bottoms (green zone), as shown below.\n\nLitecoin MVRV-Z score. Source: Glassnode\n\nLitecoin has entered the green zone, which typically precedes strong bullish reversals.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, LTC\u2019s price is well-positioned for a rebound after retesting its multimonth ascending trendline as support.\n\nLTC/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIn this case, LTC/USD can climb toward its horizontal resistance level near $100, up about 20% from current prices.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Moreover, the number of transactions processed on the Bitcoin blockchain in one day exceeded 682,000, with over 300,000 Ordinals inscribed.\n\nThe hashrate, in orange, soars to 439 EH/s. Source: timechainstats.\n\nThese milestones demonstrate the network\u2019s strength and stability, and the increasing adoption of Bitcoin for various use cases, all while the United States banking sector fractures.\n\nThe Bitcoin hash rate, a measure of the computational power dedicated to securing the blockchain, has reached an all-time high, signifying increased confidence in the network\u2019s security. The hash rate is a crucial indicator of the network\u2019s health, with a higher hash rate meaning more miners are participating, thus making the network more resistant to attacks.\n\nThe surge in the hash rate reflects growing investments in mining infrastructure despite fluctuations in Bitcoin\u2019s price. More territories and regions around the world are mining Bitcoin \u2014 with increasing amounts of renewable energy \u2014 allaying fears of centralization or environmental impacts that have shrouded Bitcoin mining in the past.\n\nHowever, as Denver Bitcoin, a well-known Bitcoin miner with Upstream Data, highlighted, the hash rate surge may be short-lived. It\u2019s important to \u201cwatch 1500-block to 5k-block avg time to get an understanding of true hashrate,\u201d he shared in a tweet:\n\nSometimes 20-100 blocks get found in quick succession, \u201ccurrent hashrate\u201d readout on websites will show crazy number like 450Eh/s.\n\nAlways watch 1500-block to 5k-block avg time to get an understanding of true hashrate.\n\n\n\nAll based on blocktimes there\u2019s no query of \u201ctotal hashrate.\u201d pic.twitter.com/ijgNsrwzIX \u2014 Adam O (@denverbitcoin) May 2, 2023\n\nThe hash rate may be temporarily surging\u2013partly driven by a resurgence in the popularity of Bitcoin ordinal inscriptions. Bitcoin Ordinals are unique, nonfungible tokens built on the Bitcoin network, each representing a distinct position in the Bitcoin blockchain. Each ordinal is \u201cinscribed\u201d on a satoshi (the smallest denomination of Bitcoin), and owners can prove digital ownership of their sats.\n\nOrdinals have gained traction among collectors, investors and enthusiasts, offering a new way to engage with the Bitcoin ecosystem. For example, Bitcoin Ordinals fan Dan Held shares that altcoin advocates are engaging with Bitcoin for the first time due to the inscriptions.\n\nOrdinals reach 3 million inscriptions. Source: Dune\n\nThe number of inscriptions in a 24-hour period exceeded 350,000 on May 1, as the total number of Ordinals exceeded 3 million. Given that each Ordinal inscription also counts as a transaction, the number of Bitcoin transactions has also soared.\n\nDaily transactions reach 682,000. Source: timechainstats\n\nAs more people buy, sell and trade Bitcoin Ordinals, the number of daily transactions on the network has significantly increased to 682,000. The mempool, or the \u201cwaiting area\u201d for incoming transactions before they are confirmed, is currently very busy. The cheapest transaction fee sits at 8 satoshis per byte, about $0.30, which is well above its lows of 1 satoshi per byte. If users want to send money to wallets on the Bitcoin base chain, the costs are significantly higher than usual due to the surging number of Ordinal inscriptions.\n\nRelated: \u200b\u200bBitcoin Ordinals community debates fix after inscription validation bug\n\nFor some, Bitcoin Ordinals offer another role for the network that goes above its activities as a store of value and medium of exchange. For others, such as Adam Back, Ordinals are useless.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin in Senegal: Why is this African country using BTC?"

        "title": "The Fed has little ammo left as $30K Bitcoin price becomes key battle line - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Bitcoin price successfully defended the $28,000 support on May 2, but it has yet to prove the strength needed to reclaim the $29,200 level from April 30.\n\n$30K becomes crucial for Bitcoin bulls\n\nSome analysts will pin the recent downtrend on the expectation of an interest rate increase by the United States Federal Reserve on May 3, but in reality, the market is pricing 92% odds of a modest 25-basis-point increase to its highest level since September 2007.\n\n$DXY up/#Bitcoin down on yesterdays PMI data release.\n\n\n\nMarket is now pricing in a very high probability of 25bps raise at tomorrows #FOMC.\n\n\n\nThis is likely mostly priced in for BTC, but the comments afterwards (more rates/pause) will likely bring the volatility. https://t.co/H5qtGpd8gA pic.twitter.com/BmdsNRtb1f \u2014 Decentrader (@decentrader) May 2, 2023\n\nAs the market intelligence platform Decentrader pointed out, the comments from Fed chairman Jerome Powell are more likely to bring surprise elements, either pointing to further measures to slow down the economy or signaling higher odds of the terminal interest rate being close to 5%. Powell is set to hold a press conference at 2:30 pm Eastern Time.\n\nFrom an employment perspective, the central bank has reason to believe that the market continues to be overheated. The U.S. government reported 1.6 job openings for every unemployed worker in March. Moreover, according to the \u201cADP National Employment Report\u201d released on May 3, private payrolls increased by 296,000 jobs in April, well above the 148,000 market consensus.\n\nHowever, raising interest rates has negative consequences for families and small businesses in particular. Financing and mortgages become more costly, while investing in fixed income becomes more attractive. Such an undesired effect of curbing inflation could further shake the core of the financial system as shown by the latest bank failure, this time of First Republic Bank.\n\nTherefore, an eventual Bitcoin (BTC) price breakthrough above $30,000 could be a definitive sign of investors\u2019 perception shifting from seeing Bitcoin as a risk asset to a scarce digital asset that directly benefits from a weaker traditional banking system.\n\nBut to gauge whether Bitcoin\u2019s resilience above $28,000 is sustainable, an investor must analyze if excessive leverage has been used by buyers and whether professional traders are pricing higher odds of a market downturn using BTC derivatives.\n\nBitcoin futures show low demand from leverage buyers\n\nBitcoin quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement.\n\nAs a result, futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5 to 10% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin two-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe data suggests Bitcoin traders have been extra cautious over the past couple of weeks. Even as the BTC price flirted with $30,000 on April 26, there were no signs of demand for leveraged longs.\n\nRelated: Balaji pays out his crazy $1M Bitcoin bet, 97% under price target\n\nMoreover, the Bitcoin futures premium has stagnated near 2% since April 23, suggesting that buyers are unwilling to use leverage, which is healthy for the market. By avoiding futures contract exposure, it greatly reduces the risk of large liquidations during negative Bitcoin price moves.\n\nBitcoin options traders remain neutral\n\nThe Bitcoin options market can also help a trader understand whether a recent correction has caused investors to become more optimistic. The 25% delta skew is a telling sign when arbitrage desks and market makers overcharge for upside or downside protection.\n\nIn short, if traders anticipate a Bitcoin price drop, the skew metric will rise above 7%, and phases of excitement tend to have a negative 7% skew.\n\nBitcoin 60-day options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe option delta's 25% skew has shown balanced demand between call and put options for the past four weeks. That should come as a surprise given that the Bitcoin price rallied 10% between April 25 and April 30, when it last tested the $30,000 resistance.\n\nConsequently, Bitcoin options and futures markets suggest that professional traders are not placing their chips on the BTC price breaking above $30,000 anytime soon. On the other hand, those whales are pricing in similar odds of surprise positive and negative moves.\n\nUltimately, given that the Fed clearly has a limit to raising interest rates without causing a recession, Bitcoin\u2019s price should be positively impacted, regardless of the decision on May 3.\n\nFed chair Powell will ultimately force the U.S. Treasury to inject more money into the economy to contain the banking crisis, which will be beneficial for a scarce asset such as Bitcoin.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The company also announced new Online Portal features, including the ability to pay credit cards, taxes and other household bills directly with bitcoin, as well as purchase gift cards from hundreds of popular retailers with bitcoin.\n\n\n\nKey highlights\n\nGross profit of $1.1 million (Q1 2022 - $1 million) with a gross margin improvement to 9%. The increased gross margin is a result of a changing product mix, with more higher-margin ATM sales in Q1 2023 relative to prior periods. Bitcoin Well continued to see strong ATMs volumes throughout the quarter, with a company record number of ATM transactions in the month of March 2023.\n\nBitcoin Well recorded Adjusted EBITDA of negative $0.22 million (Q1 2022 - negative $1.5 million). Changes in the unrealized value of our cryptocurrency loans and digital assets may result in significant swings in net income which are not indicative of the underlying operational performance of the business. We present Adjusted EBITDA to exclude the variability caused by the revaluations and other items not expected to recur in normal operations.\n\nApproximately 3,800 unique users in the Online Portal (Q4 2022 - 2,500) an improvement of 52%. Associated Online monthly revenues exceeded $369,000 (Q4 2022 - $190,000), maintaining continued growth in the product since launched in Q4 2022.\n\nCanadians can now also buy gift cards and pay credit cards, taxes and household bills with bitcoin through the Online Portal at bitcoinwell.com/app\n\nFinancial overview\n\nFor the three months ended, March 31,\n\n2023 March 31,\n\n2022 % ($000s) ($000s) Change Revenue $12,417 $13,529 (8 %) Gross profit $1,086 $965 13 % Adjusted EBITDA1 $(217) $(1,494) 85 % Total comprehensive loss $(1,006) $(2,184) 54 %\n\n1 See Non-IFRS Measures.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Company\u2019s Q1 2023 revenue decreased to $12.4 million compared to $13.5 million in Q1 2022. Despite the decrease in revenue, gross profit increased to $1.1 million in Q1 2023, compared to $0.9 million in the same time period in the prior year, an improvement of 13%. Adjusted EBITDA improved to negative $0.2 million in Q1 2023 compared to negative $1.5 million in the prior year, an improvement of 71%.\n\nNotably, the Company achieved a 9% Gross Margin in Q1 2023 compared to a 7% Gross Margin in Q1 2022, resulting from a relative increase in higher-margin ATM sales in the quarter.\n\n\u201cWe have been working hard to maintain consistency across our existing cash flow generating business units, being ATMs and OTC (Bitcoin Well Infinite), despite the volatile crypto markets, all while still achieving strong growth in the Online Portal in terms of users and revenue. This is displayed in our Q1 2023 results, and we are staying committed to continuing this positive trend. We are also excited to see the impact of the planned expansion to the USA, announced March 28, 2023 , to our existing cash flowing units in the coming periods,\u201d said Luke Thibodeau, CFO.\n\nProduct advancements\n\nBitcoin Well has successfully incorporated the ability for users in Canada, USA, India, the EU and other countries around the world to purchase gift cards to popular retailers\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin Well has successfully incorporated the ability for users in Canada, USA, India, the EU and other countries around the world to purchase gift cards to popular retailers including Amazon, Uber, Air Canada and more using bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies into the Online Portal. This is done through a partnership where Bitcoin Well will receive a portion of the margin earned on each transaction.\n\n\u201cThe ability to use bitcoin to buy gift cards is an important part of bitcoin usability. We are a long ways away from merchants accepting bitcoin natively, and this helps bridge the gap and make bitcoin more usable in the meantime,\u201d said Adam O\u2019Brien, CEO of the Company. \u201cThis additional functionality cements us as a leader in giving people the convenience of modern banking (easy ways to use money) with the benefits of bitcoin (self custody).\u201d\n\nAlso released this month, Canadian users at bitcoinwell.com/app can now pay their household bills, taxes and credit cards with bitcoin.\n\nEffective immediately, any payee that accepts payment through the Canadian bill payment network can be paid with bitcoin through the Bitcoin Well Online Portal.\n\n\u201cThe Bitcoin Well Online Portal has the most functionality in the country!\u201d Adam O\u2019Brien continued. \u201cWith our bill payments and gift card functionality, bitcoin just got a whole lot more useful.\u201d\n\nOther updates\n\nLastly, on May 1, 2023, the Company agreed to amendments to the Convertible Debenture issued on February 23, 2022. Amendments include an adjustment to the conversion price, which is now $0.25 (from $0.30), an amended interest rate of Prime + 6.2% (formerly 10% per annum), and an amendment to the term of the loan, which now extends to five (5) years from the issue date (formerly three (3) years from the issue date). These amendments are subject to regulatory approval.\n\nNon-IFRS measures\n\nThe Company uses certain terms in this news release and within the MD&A, such as \u2018Adjusted EBITDA\u2019, which do not have a standardized or prescribed meaning under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and accordingly, these measurements may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measurements used by other companies.

And he\u2019s done it to prove a point, he says, that the U.S. economy is in such bad shape, people will flock to cryptocurrency instead.\n\nSrinivasan initially announced a $1 million bet in March, claiming that the global economy is on the edge of rapid change, and as a result, we will see the rapid adoption of Bitcoin\u2014which he calls \u201chyperbitcoinization.\u201d\n\nThe original bet was made with Twitter pundit James Medlock and stipulated that if Bitcoin failed to hit $1 million within 90 days, he would receive $1 million in Circles USDC stablecoin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nToday, he said the bet had been \u201cclosed out by mutual agreement\u201d and settled early, giving $500,000 to poverty charity Give Directly, $500,000 to Bitcoin core developers, and $500,000 to Medlock.\n\n\u201cSo, I settled the bet ahead of time and donated even more than I had committed,\u201d he wrote today on Twitter. \u201cI spent my own money to send a provably costly signal that there\u2019s something wrong with the economy, and that it's not going to be a \u2018soft landing\u2019 like Powell [Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell] promises\u2014but something much worse.\u201d\n\nWhile it could be viewed as ultimately conceding the bet, he claimed that his reasoning for donating the money before the 90-days were up is that he \u201cbelieves in the public good, but unfortunately we can't rely on the public sector anymore to tell us when something's wrong.\u201d\n\nI just burned a million to tell you they're printing trillions. pic.twitter.com/pX5622rjUO \u2014 Balaji (@balajis) May 2, 2023\n\nSrinivasan insists that the American economy will enter hyperinflation and Bitcoin will be a go-to safe haven\u2014eventually hitting a market cap of $19.3 trillion. Bitcoin now has a market cap of $555 billion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading for $28,827, according to CoinGecko, meaning it would have to shoot up in value by 3,369% to hit $1 million per coin.\n\nThe asset is currently vauled 58% less than its November 2021 all-time high of $69,044. But in May 2013, it was priced at $123.10, meaning that over a decade, the original digital currency has appreciated by 23,317%.\n\nSrinivasan went on to say that economic catastrophe was coming and that he made the donations to make the point that \u201cthings could unwind very fast.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany things are breaking at once,\u201d he continued, referring to the U.S. debt ceiling, the banking crisis, bonds losing value, and the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\n\u201cI just burned a million to tell you they\u2019re printing trillions.\u201d"

        "title": "Are Bitcoin Ordinals a boon or a drag on the network? - Forkast News",
        "content": "Over the last few months, a new development came to the Bitcoin network: Inscriptions. Dubbed Ordinals, these digital assets differ from their NFT counterparts, but the results are the same. Since its inception, the Bitcoin network has seen a massive spike in traffic, not unlike what Ethereum underwent during the 2021 NFT boom.\n\n\n\nThis increased activity has led to congestion on an already crowded network \u2014 sparking a heated debate about the potential impact of Ordinals on the future of Bitcoin. It also begs the question: Now the genie is out of the bottle, what\u2019s next? And, perhaps more importantly, how will the Bitcoin network cope with the on-chain strain?\n\nWhat are Ordinals?\n\nAt a high level, the Ordinals protocol enables users to send and receive Satoshis \u2014 the smallest monetary unit of a Bitcoin, or \u200b\u200bone-hundred-millionths of one BTC \u2014 that carry extra data connected to them. This data can be in the form of text, images, audio or other media. Adding data to a Satoshi is called an \u201cinscription,\u201d which is not dissimilar to NFTs.\n\nThis was all made possible with some significant upgrades to the network that have occurred. First was the SegWit update, which created a split data structure for all transactions. The second was Taproot, which allowed more data to be placed within transactions.\n\nUnlike most NFTs on Ethereum, which usually just include a link to the media, Bitcoin Ordinals are 100% on-chain. This is a major selling point for digital assets, but it also means these digital collectibles are expensive to create and that the transactions that do so tend to be rather large. Because of this, it has made some wary about the consequences of this protocol on the network as a whole.\n\nOrdinals have only been around for a few months, and over 3.2 million new assets have already been created in that short time. The Bitcoin network has also subsequently seen one of the largest blocks ever mined, 4 megabytes, as a direct result of Ordinal inscribing. Then there is the considerable impact these new types of NFTs have on network congestion and transaction fees, which have hit levels not seen since November 2022. This rise in transaction volume and average fees has also led to miners excluding many lower-fee transactions, raising the floor price for transacting on the network.\n\nA community divided\n\nA debate is currently raging about whether these Ordinals are good for Bitcoin. For one, some have pointed out that Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, didn\u2019t think Bitcoin should be used for anything other than the transaction of value. There\u2019s also a concern that continued adoption could further clog up the network and make it even more expensive. Some have even gone so far as to suggest that this development could harm the ability of marginalized people to use Bitcoin. Considering that many developing nations are the most prolific users of the network, this could potentially affect some jurisdictions more than others.\n\nOn the other side of the debate, many feel the panic over Bitcoin Ordinals is largely unwarranted. For one, the transaction-purging mentioned before only affects the lowest fee transactions, encouraging fee competition. Additionally, while inscriptions have taken up a considerable amount of every block as of late, not long ago, most blocks were 25% to 50% empty. Arguably, Ordinals are just using resources that otherwise would be wasted.\n\nIndeed, some schools of thought suggest adding value and utility to the Bitcoin network is essential for the network\u2019s longevity. For one, increasing the adoption of Bitcoin is vital for its legitimacy as a currency and store of value. The more people use it, the more valuable it becomes and the more stable its value can be.\n\nCombating congestion\n\nHowever, the congestion issue still persists. Now that Ordinals have opened the Bitcoin network to new possibilities, where does it end? Arguably, a solution needs to be found. The most likely solution is some form of layer-2 infrastructure that can take the bulk of transaction processing away from the main chain. This could allow Ordinals to proliferate on the Bitcoin network without threatening transactional use cases.\n\nOne potential solution in the long term is creating a ZK-rollup on BTC, storing proofs on Bitcoin where Ordinal images are stored. This would allow increased throughput without compromising on security. This would require a change to BTC to verify the proofs, which could take years.\n\nAnother potential solution is using side chains or layer-2 solutions. For example, the Bitcoin Lightning Network has proven to handle transactions quickly and cost-effectively. Alternatively, there\u2019s the Liquid Network, which similarly acts as a means to take traffic off the main network to allow for faster, cheaper trades.\n\nThe previously mentioned solutions would all increase the throughput of BTC, but still would not provide a smart contract layer to BTC. In addition, ideally, this should be done without invoking any risky technology like centralized bridges, which lost users almost US$3 billion last year. Recent developments allow the network to act as a smart contract layer for BTC while mitigating the potential risks of centralized cross-chain bridges and poorly designed wrapped tokens. Allowing Bitcoin to become programmable can also unlock a wide range of new DeFi-related use cases, including Bitcoin or Ordinal collateralized loans and staking.\n\nThe rise of Ordinals on the Bitcoin network is undeniable, and their impact is only set to grow in the coming years as more projects tap into the same utility. But it\u2019s clear that the current state of the network is not equipped to handle the influx of traffic that this may bring, and it\u2019s time to face the reality that Bitcoin needs to evolve to keep up. Turning to layer-2 infrastructure may be a critical part of the solution."

        "title": "How and why bitcoin ATMs help the underbanked - ATM Marketplace",
        "content": "Do bitcoin ATMs helped the unbanked and underbanked? And what role do regulations and cash usage play?\n\nOne topic that comes up at times with cryptocurrency is whether it will see widespread adoption among the underbanked. Since usually it requires some form of digital payment to purchase bitcoin, this could hold back the market for unbanked. However, bitcoin ATMs are providing a key service for this group.\n\nSince bitcoin ATMs often are cash only, they provide a simple tool for the unbanked and underbanked to use with cash payments. This is actually playing out when one looks at the data of countries that use a lot of cash and the number of bitcoin ATMs.\n\nTradingbrowser.com, a crypto trading guide and exchange reviews company, recently published a study that took a look at bitcoin ATMs and found that countries with high numbers of unbanked populations also had larger numbers cryptocurrency adoption and bitcoin ATMs.\n\nFor example, 42% of Romania's population is unbanked, but more than 300,000 residents own cryptocurrency and there are 156 bitcoin ATMs within the country. In addition, 9% of all payments in Romania are made with cash. In addition, Bulgaria, which has 74% cash payments has 33 bitcoin ATMs.\n\nHowever, the opposite was true in countries with low rates of cash payment, such as Sweden, where only 1% of all transactions are made in cash and the country has no bitcoin ATMs installed.\n\nThis trend doesn't follow every country, as Hong Kong has 147 bitcoin ATMs and only does 4% of payments in cash.\n\n\"The rise of bitcoin ATMs and cash payments as key drivers of adoption is a testament to the need for accessible and user-friendly infrastructure that can facilitate the seamless integration of cryptocurrency into everyday transactions,\" a spokesperson for Tradingbrowser said in an email. \"It is worth noting that the high rates of unbanked populations in certain countries are a major contributing factor to cryptocurrency adoption rates. This highlights the need for innovative and inclusive financial services that can cater to underserved populations and empower them with greater financial autonomy and flexibility.\"\n\nHowever, the data raises a number of questions, such as what other factors could be driving bitcoin and bitcoin ATM adoption in countries with large numbers of unbanked citizens? What role do regulations play? To learn more about this, ATM Marketplace reached out to Daniel Larsson, senior editor at Tradingbrowser.com in an email interview.\n\nQ. The data shows unbanked countries having a higher number of bitcoin ATMs. Why do you think this is the case?\n\nA. We think it's a lack of traditional banking infrastructure and the need for alternative financial solutions that have pushed the installation of these Bitcoin ATMs in highly unbanked countries. For nations that mostly depend on cash, Bitcoin ATMs seem to provide a more accessible and user-friendly way of transacting with cryptocurrencies.\n\nQ. How does bitcoin benefit the underbanked?\n\nA. Since blockchain is a decentralized network, unbanked people do not have to go through a centralized system such as a bank in order to transfer value in a secure way. Bitcoin transactions are also much faster and in many ways cheaper than traditional banking transactions, making it an easier way to conduct financial transactions.\n\nQ.Do regulations play a role here? In other words, are underbanked countries softer on crypto regulations?\n\nA. From our point of view, regulations may play a role in the adoption of cryptocurrency in unbanked countries since many of these nations have fewer regulations or more permissive regulations regarding blockchain and cryptocurrency. However, this depends on the nation as we've also seen highly unbanked countries with more strict regulations toward cryptocurrency to avoid fraud and money laundering.\n\nQ.Do you see bitcoin ATMs growing in underbanked countries? Why or why not?\n\nA. Yes, we do. If the trend persists and there are no barriers put in place by governments there should be no reason for these bitcoin ATMs to keep providing financial support in unbanked nations. Also, as more people become aware of these ATMs, the demand is likely to increase. Additionally, as the infrastructure for traditional banking in regions with highly unbanked populations does not change overnight we can speculate that in the growth of bitcoin ATMs will continue in the near term."

        "content": "The best advice you can get when buying bitcoin or investing in crypto (other than, you know, \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d) is the same advice you get when going to a casino: never bet more than you\u2019re willing to lose. Balaji Srinivasan, the former chief technical officer of Coinbase, must have been more than willing to part ways with fat stacks after he gave up on hopes bitcoin would ever reach prices equal to $1 million.\n\nCrypto Exchanges Restrict Withdrawals CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish view video Crypto Exchanges Restrict Withdrawals\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a trader, I\u2019m not John McAfee, and I\u2019m not in the bait of publicly burning a million bucks,\u201d Srinivasan wrote in a Tuesday tweet. Unfortunately, that\u2019s what he did, and more than a month earlier than he stated he originally intended to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSrinivasan, a former partner at venture capital kingmakers Andreesen Horowitz, made a public bet back in March that bitcoin would reach $1 million in value. His named his gamble shortly after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, predicting the economy would go bankrupt along with hyperinflation of the U.S. dollar, all of which would see the price of bitcoin skyrocket. Srinivasan originally predicted it would take 90 days for the value of bitcoin to balloon while the entire U.S. economy flatlined, though he later told CoinDesk it could take \u201c900 days or even 90 months\u2026 I don\u2019t have a 100% probability on it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis attempt to short the entire U.S. economy didn\u2019t exactly pan out, and he called his own bluff late on Tuesday. He said he donated $1.5 million in total, which amounted to $500,000 to three entities including the East African direct money nonprofit GiveDirectly, bitcoin node developers Bitcoin Core, and the Twitter user James Medlock. The account previously made its own $1 million bet that the economy would not enter hyperinflation, though the user admitted Tuesday that they made the tweet as a kind of joke.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, Srinivasan continued to claim that there was \u201csomething wrong with the economy, and the state isn\u2019t telling you about it.\u201d\n\nHis video explaining his reasoning is more like a hungover person trying to explain why they tried to drunkenly consume their friend\u2019s house plant than any cogent argument about the state of the economy. He referred to the run-ups of economic calamities of yesteryear, like the months before the start of the 2008 financial crisis and the start of the covid pandemic in 2020, for why he chose his few-month time frame. Then he cited a morass of articles pointing to economic fears of an incoming bond and banking crisis. He rambled on, citing the well-known prognosticator Elon Musk and the waning numbers of millionaires coming to the U.S. as signs of economic worry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a crystal ball,\u201d he said, and then claimed there\u2019s a 10% chance we\u2019d see an economic crisis in \u201cmonths.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not a small thing\u2026 it\u2019s not like the banking crisis is over,\u201d Srinivasan said, referring to the SVB collapse. That bank was one of the largest bank failures in U.S. history, though that hasn\u2019t stopped his former bosses at Andreessen Horowitz, also known as a16z, signing back on to the restored bank. Don\u2019t forget that part of the reason for SVB\u2019s immediate collapse was a bank run of startup founders and venture firms, many backed by a16z. The venture capital firm had reportedly messaged many of its startups telling them to get their funds out, decimating the bank in a number of hours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s also not forget where the price of bitcoin currently stands. The price of bitcoin saw highs of above $60,000 briefly in late 2021 before crashing precipitously over the course of the following year. According to CoinM arketC ap, the price currently sits below $30,000. If he truly thought the price of bitcoin would bounce $970,000 in price in just a few-months time frame, he would also have to confront the fact that bitcoin is only rarely used as a currency, and acts more as a volatile speculation that rarely leads to any sort of profit for base users."

More than 23,000 Russians have been granted residency in the country alongside a much smaller proportion of Ukrainians since Vladmir Putin\u2019s troops invaded Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nIn addition, more than 263,000 Russians entered Serbia alone in 2022, according to Ministry of Internal Affairs numbers reported by BBC Serbia.\n\nNOW READ: Pro-Russian neo-Nazis\u2019 Telegram campaigns raise $5m in crypto \u2013 but it\u2019s \u2018significantly harder\u2019\n\nUnlike the majority of Europe, Serbia has not imposed sanctions on Russia. It has even signed new gas deals since the invasion. Analysts note that the state-controlled Air Serbia airline has doubled its flights from Belgrade to Moscow, a sentiment that runs directly counter to the EU.\n\nOf these new arrivals, approximately 300 Russians have signed up to ECD and are chiefly users of the company\u2019s ATMs, where they can register to withdraw their crypto without needing a Serbian bank account, allowing quick access to funds, according to Matanovi\u0107.\n\nRussian customers\u2019 use of the ATMs are just an incidental drop in the bucket of the entrepreneur\u2019s total business volumes, according to Matanovi\u0107, but cast a curious light on how the country\u2019s new regulations on crypto are impacting the exchange.\n\nFrom e-gold to Bitcoin\n\nTall, slim and self-assured, Matanovi\u0107 is every inch the Bitcoin believer.\n\n\u201cI wish we had Bitcoin in the \u201890s,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cIt would have made our life much easier. Because as usual, politicians make a mess and then regular people suffer and it would be good for them to have the way around the regular financial system wherever they are,\u201d\n\nFrustrated with not being able to take full advantage of the internet revolution, Matanovi\u0107 discovered crypto precursor e-gold the early digital currency started in the US backed by gold \u2014 as a way to get access to a nascent e-commerce market \u2014 one that had been blocked to him due to sanctions.\n\n\u201cI recognised the value at first glance, because I knew the pain I had to go through for being from Serbia,\u201d he said. \u201cThere weren\u2019t many things you could buy, but I was hoping that would change with time.\u201d\n\nWith timing not on his side, Matanovi\u0107 started an e-gold exchange in 2007, just two years before being forced to shutter the platform after the asset was banned. Undeterred, the arrival of Bitcoin piqued his interest.\n\n\u2018I recognised the value at first glance, because I knew the pain I had to go through for being from Serbia\u2019\n\nArmed with only a few computers, he began an early Bitcoin mining operation after a suggestion from Nikola Cvijovi\u0107, his business partner and co-founder of ECD.\n\n\u201cI thought he was crazy. I was very sceptical. It was a small mining operation, just a few computers in a garage,\u201d he said. But it didn\u2019t take long for electricity bills to outweigh the profit.\n\nAnd like so many entrepreneurs, the exchange business was created to solve a problem.\n\n\u201cThere were very few Bitcoin exchanges globally. It was impossible to get money from those exchanges to Serbia regularly,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people opened bank accounts in Hungary, Austria, Slovakia, and then physically going there to bring it into Serbia, but it was not the perfect way.\u201d\n\nNOW READ: Lebanon\u2019s crypto brokers dodge turmoil and masked gunmen to serve clients\n\nBut it took years for the industry to be recognised officially \u2014 licences to trade crypto were only doled out last year following Serbia\u2019s new Digital Assets Law.\n\nOn the one hand, Matanovi\u0107 maintains the legislation has strengthened the business \u2014 accountants that were previously spooked by crypto have been assuaged.\n\nBut retail customers were drawn towards offshore exchanges.\n\n\u201cOnce the law was introduced, the legal entities felt much more comfortable in working with crypto. And that\u2019s the segment of the market that really has become much stronger,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere was a perception among the people that crypto is tax free, because most of the people didn\u2019t know how to report the tax,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Matanovi\u0107 is pushing for more efficiencies, citing Serbian know-your-customer, or KYC, procedures as outdated. Customer verification has to be done in person and is the biggest obstacle for his online business.\n\nAnti-money laundering laws hit Serbian crypto transactions in 2018, and significantly impacted the company\u2019s ATM transactions by raising the bar for KYC checks \u2014 causing a real disadvantage compared to exchanges abroad.\n\n\u201cWe are in an absurd situation where it is easier for people from Serbia to onboard on Binance on Kraken or some other foreign exchange than it is to onboard on Serbian exchange, and that shouldn\u2019t be the case,\u201d he said.\n\nBut while regulation has been broadly welcomed by local crypto analysts, Matanovi\u0107 almost shudders at the mention of the possibility a Serbian issued central bank currency CBDC.\n\n\u201cI will try to sabotage it,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope it never happens because I see huge potential for abuse\u2026 As a true crypto fan, what I would like to see is at some point is a total separation of money and state and not a tighter connection between them.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin and Altcoins Report \u2013 May Week 1 - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "As the debt ceiling crisis looms, bond and equity markets are feeling the jitters. Investors are anxious about the possibility of a historic default, but amidst the chaos, there may be a glimmer of hope for one asset: Bitcoin. Let\u2019s dive in!\n\nMarket Scene\n\nThe banking crisis shows no signs of abating, with First Republic Bank becoming the latest casualty, sending shockwaves through the market. However, to everyone\u2019s surprise, this bad news did not tank the market. Instead, it sparked a rally in the bitcoin and altcoins market, just like the last banking crisis.\n\nLast time, the feds intervened to save the day, but this time the US Government refused to step in, leaving everyone wondering how the banking crisis would play out.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty were concerns about several dormant BTC whales and ETH addresses that suddenly became active. While this is not uncommon, the sudden surge in activity raised suspicion.\n\nCould someone have found a way to compromise old wallets? Or were people arrested during the Silk Road era finally accessing their old funds?\n\nStaying vigilant about potential sell pressure and security risks is always essential.\n\nJust as the market seemed to be recovering midweek, a curious market dump occurred, attributed to alerts that Mt Gox and US Government wallets were moving funds, causing panic among investors. While it turned out to be a false alarm, the funds in question will eventually hit the market, leaving many wondering if another dump will follow.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will announce its latest interest rate decision on May 3rd, and investors anticipate a 0.25% increase. As this is the most probable outcome, we can expect it to have a neutral to positive impact on both the crypto and general financial markets.\n\nSource: The Block\n\nHowever, given the decreasing correlation between cryptocurrencies and major stock indices, the impact may be closer to neutral.\n\nOne area of concern we need to monitor closely is the amount of leverage in the crypto market. The recent sudden price dip was primarily caused by nearly $200 million of liquidations, mainly from leveraged long positions.\n\nThe crypto exchange, OKX, saw over $52 million in bitcoin futures liquidations on its platform, while Binance followed with $38 million in liquidations. Meanwhile, BitMEX witnessed the most significant single liquidation order, a bitcoin/tether trade worth $6 million.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nThe high level of leverage in the crypto market is a cause for concern because even minor positive or negative news can result in significant price fluctuations caused by cascading liquidations or massive short squeezes.\n\nThe Regulatory Scene\n\nThe regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the U.S. government is continuing its push to exert greater control over the industry.\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has warned that anonymity in crypto represents a national security threat, a stance that could signal future strict policies.\n\nBesides, the CFTC has also suggested a potential settlement in the ongoing lawsuit against Binance. However, many other players in the crypto space are also facing lawsuits, including Binance\u2019s CEO, CZ.\n\nMoreover, this heavy regulation is already significantly impacting industry players, with Binance.US pulling out of a deal with Voyager due to regulatory concerns. Circle\u2019s CEO has also hinted at the possibility of the company exiting the U.S. market, and Bybit has recently imposed mandatory KYC procedures.\n\nHowever, not all industry players are willing to submit to government overreach without a fight. Coinbase has filed a lawsuit against the SEC to obtain regulatory clarity on cryptocurrencies, and Bittrex has also indicated its intent to contest the SEC\u2019s charges against them.\n\nToday, we filed a narrow action in the U.S. Circuit Court to compel the SEC to respond \u201cyes or no\u201d to a rulemaking petition we filed with them last July asking them to provide regulatory guidance for the crypto industry. 1/4 https://t.co/rlsS1DIFfl \u2014 paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) April 25, 2023\n\nA South Korean court ruled Terra Classic not to be a security but has indicted Terra co-founder Daniel Shin. It suggests that both the U.S. and South Korea want to make an example out of Do Kwon and save face after many investors suffered losses on Luna.\n\nMeanwhile, Hong Kong is poised to issue crypto company licensing guidelines in May, though it\u2019s uncertain when exactly this will happen. Hong Kong has been rapidly moving towards crypto adoption, with officials recently reminding banks to offer services to crypto companies and issuing a demand for such services shortly after.\n\nIMF: The Villain\n\nThe IMF is arguably a controversial player in the global finance arena. Last year in May, the Central Bank of Argentina imposed a comprehensive ban on cryptocurrencies and prohibited institutional access to them.\n\nThis decision adversely affected the Argentine people, who rank 13th globally in crypto adoption due to high inflation and the need for a store of value. In isolation, the ban seems illogical, but Argentina is not operating in isolation. In March, the IMF approved a $45 billion loan to Argentina to tackle the country\u2019s fiscal challenges, with conditions that included a stance against crypto.\n\nEssentially, the IMF forced Argentina to choose between the loan and crypto, leaving them no choice. As a result, the Argentine Congress approved the IMF debt deal, discouraging crypto use. The IMF\u2019s actions demonstrate its reluctance to let countries break free from the fiat system for which it is responsible.\n\nThe government of Argentina recently published a Letter of Intent entitled \u201cStrengthening financial resilience,\u201d which discourages the use of cryptocurrencies to prevent money laundering, informality, and disintermediation. This provision appeases the IMF\u2019s demands, which come with a $45 billion loan to address the country\u2019s pressing fiscal challenges.\n\nArgentina has been a basket case for decades, because it\u2019s uniquely targeted by the US, IMF and the World Bank. Its economy is wrecked by ultimate debt traps, but the politicians and the elites keep making the same mistakes. Quite incredible! pic.twitter.com/s0RsFthf7s \u2014 S.L. Kanthan (@Kanthan2030) April 13, 2023\n\nHowever, this decision is devastating for the people of Argentina, where:\n\nOver 40% of the population lives below the poverty line.\n\nInflation reached as high as 103% in February of this year.\n\nMoreover, with prices of goods and services doubling annually and with crypto off the table, the IMF has prevented a desperate country from exploring new financial opportunities, trapping them as a fiat debt slave.\n\nThe IMF has made no secret of its stance on cryptocurrency.\n\nIn February, the organization voiced its concern about El Salvador\u2019s adoption of Bitcoin, warning against financing Bitcoin purchases through tokenized securities due to fiscal and legal risks.\n\nIt is not an isolated incident; the IMF has a history of targeting countries that turn to cryptocurrency as a solution to their financial woes. For example, a $1.3 billion loan to El Salvador has been stalled for over a year, potentially scrapped due to the country\u2019s adoption of Bitcoin.\n\nThe IMF\u2019s behavior suggests a desire to maintain a fiat monopoly, even at the expense of impoverished nations. The Central African Republic\u2019s adoption of Bitcoin was met with similar resistance from the IMF, citing legal, transparency, and economic policy concerns.\n\nHowever, the IMF\u2019s attempts to quash cryptocurrency adoption may prove futile in the long run. Undoubtedly, decentralized, digital, and immutable tech like Bitcoin will prevail against centralized institutions like the IMF.\n\nAlso a year ago, the IMF told El Salvador to stop using bitcoin and focus on fiat debt slavery. Yet it is Argentina that is defaulting today, while El Salvador paid off its bonds. pic.twitter.com/Z7PFT5yRz8 \u2014 Saifedean Ammous (@saifedean) April 24, 2023\n\nNow let\u2019s look at the on-chain data.\n\nStablecoin Market Cap Sees 13th Straight Month of Decline\n\nStablecoins experienced a decline in their market capitalization in April 2023. The total market cap decreased by 1.08% to $131bn, the lowest since September 2021. This trend of decline has persisted for thirteen consecutive months, indicating a sustained decrease in demand for stablecoins.\n\nDespite the decline in market capitalization, stablecoin trading volume grew by 13.6% in March 2023, reaching a value of $775bn.\n\nSource: CCData\n\nThis growth was primarily due to several stablecoins losing their peg during the month. However, trading volume for April 2023 seems to be on track for a lower monthly figure, with only $365bn traded.\n\nUSDT Dominates Stablecoin Trading Volume\n\nIn contrast to the overall decline in stablecoins market capitalisation, USDT, one of the most widely used stablecoins, experienced a rise in market cap in April 2023. Its market capitalisation increased by 2.03% to $81.5bn, bringing it closer to its all-time high of $83.7bn recorded in May 2022.\n\nSource:CCData\n\nFurthermore, USDT\u2019s market dominance continued to increase for the fifth consecutive month, reaching 62.1% in April \u2013 the highest since April 2021. This data suggests that USDT is gaining more traction in the stablecoin market than other stablecoins.\n\nMoreover, USDT\u2019s dominance is further reflected in its trading volume on centralized exchanges, accounting for 79.0% of all trading volume with stablecoins in April 2023. With 2,931 trading pairs, USDT is the largest counterparty on centralized exchanges, followed by USD with 2,246 trading pairs.\n\nAggregate Market Transitions to Unrealized Profit\n\nThe aggregate market has started 2023 on a solid note, moving out of a phase of unrealized losses and into one of unrealized profits.\n\nThe significant divergence between the amount of supply held in profit and loss indicates this scenario. As a result, there is a growing incentive to take profits.\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nThis shift is also evident in the ratio between the supply in profit and the supply in loss. Moreover, this oscillator has reached escape velocity this year, confirming the move away from a period of loss dominance, which occurred on only 415 out of 4638 trading days (9%).\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nThe price rising above the dense concentration of supply accumulated during the bottoming formation process has mechanically driven this rebound in unrealized profit. We can measure this phenomenon by looking at the 100-day change in profitable supply after major cycle lows in both BTC and the Percent of Circulating terms:\n\n2011 Cycle Low: +1.99M BTC (19.8%)\n\n2015 Cycle Low: +4.94M BTC (32.2%)\n\n2019 Cycle Low: +6.86M BTC (38.4%)\n\n2022 Cycle Low: +4.87M BTC (25.5%)\n\nThe current cycle has seen a comparable volume of supply re-entering a profitable position, indicating a similarly robust floor.\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nAs the market transitions towards a regime of unrealized profit, an increased incentive exists to take profits. Consequently, it may impact future market dynamics as investors decide whether to hold or sell their positions.\n\nReserve of Bitcoin in US Exchanges on the Decline\n\nThe data from CryptoQuant suggests that the Bitcoin reserve at American exchanges is declining, a trend observed across all CEXs in the long term.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nHowever, the decline in reserve appears to be more significant on American exchanges, which may be due to the recent regulatory demands of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe SEC\u2019s recent restrictions may have led American investors to lose confidence in the domestic exchanges, prompting them to shift their Bitcoin holdings to offshore exchanges or personal wallets.\n\nSo, if American policymakers continue to pressure the cryptocurrency industry, they risk hampering its growth and innovation. As the market becomes increasingly global, regulatory burdens in one country may push investors to seek more favorable jurisdictions elsewhere.\n\nTherefore, regulators must balance their oversight with support for the industry to prevent stifling innovation and investment.\n\nBTC Transaction Count Hit 22-Months High\n\nAccording to data from a 30-day moving average, the Transaction Count for Bitcoin has reached a 22-month high, exceeding 682K transactions.\n\nThis metric reflects the number of transactions on the Bitcoin network during a specific period. As such, it is helpful in assessing Bitcoin\u2019s growth and adoption and identifying trends and patterns in transaction activity.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nThe transaction count was low during Bitcoin\u2019s early days due to limited adoption and the network\u2019s infancy. However, as more people began to use Bitcoin, the transaction count snowballed.\n\nBesides, the transaction count is an essential metric for assessing the overall health and activity of the Bitcoin network.\n\nHigh transaction counts indicate a high demand for Bitcoin and show that users use it for various purposes, such as buying and selling goods and services, making investments, or transferring funds.\n\nMoreover, the recent increase in transaction count is significant because scaling solutions like Lightning network and SegWit have been implemented to alleviate pressure on the Bitcoin network and facilitate faster, more efficient transactions.\n\nUndoubtedly, the increase in transaction count is evidence of the success of these scaling solutions and the growing adoption of Bitcoin among users. It also suggests the potential for continued growth and expansion in the cryptocurrency market as more people become interested in Bitcoin.\n\nSell in May and Go Away?\n\nThe \u201cSell in May and go away\u201d principle has been a common practice in traditional finance, but history shows mixed results when it comes to Bitcoin.\n\nWhile the principle doesn\u2019t seem to work for Bitcoin directly, we can see some interesting observations.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nLooking at the chart of Bitcoin\u2019s monthly candles over the last 12 years, we see seven out of twelve May candles were green, indicating positive returns.\n\nHowever, the size of these green candles has been diminishing over time, which could suggest a decline in Bitcoin\u2019s maximum gains.\n\nFurthermore, the last two May candles have been red, indicating a sell-off in May.\n\nWhile this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the principle applies to Bitcoin, it does highlight the potential for some seasonality in the market.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the \u201cSell in May and go away\u201d principle doesn\u2019t just apply to May but suggests moving to cash or less risky assets for the summer months and returning to the market later in the year.\n\nMoreover, additional research into this strategy with Bitcoin may be worth exploring, but for now, it seems that the principle doesn\u2019t strongly impact Bitcoin\u2019s market behavior.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Our popular Altcoin Buzz Access group generates tons of alpha for our subscribers.

The crypto firm Grayscale has recently opened up on the same, stating that Bitcoin Ordinals represent a huge opportunity for Bitcoin adoption and could be an area of optimism.Those opposing Bitcoin Ordinals believe it could harm fungibility or bloat the blockchain. On the other hand, Grayscale believes that it could be an improvement to the Bitcoin network perceived to be rigid.Referring to the opposing views regarding Bitcoin Ordinals, Grayscale stated that even though the concerns were valid, and the original Bitcoin whitepaper did not account for unique digital assets, inscriptions that could reduce fungibility or extra data contributing to blockchain bloat, \u201cStill, ordinals are, in fact, a byproduct of utilizing the Bitcoin blockchain as it exists today and the subsequent crypto innovations that have come since, even if not initially envisioned by Bitcoin's creator.\"The crypto firm Grayscale then went on to detail two opportunities presented by Bitcoin Ordinals which could be beneficial for the Bitcoin network. Firstly, it said that the Bitcoin NFTs could help increase fees for Bitcoin miners.Grayscale mentioned how, once all tokens were mined, miners would not be able to maintain the required hash rate for securing the network since they won't derive enough rewards from the transaction activities. But Bitcoin Ordinals have helped in increasing the fees of such miners, which would enable them to maintain the level of security across the Bitcoin network forever.Grayscale also believes Bitcoin Ordinals could be instrumental in driving Bitcoin adoption by bringing a transformational change to the culture of the Bitcoin community. With increasing NFT adoption on the network, a development-led culture could be established like that in Ethereum. This could be a big change from its stagnant perception from certain quarters. Ordinals witnessed daily inscriptions going to 300,000 on April 30, while Bitcoin transactions have also increased."

        "title": "Bitcoin's tipping point - CoinGeek",
        "content": "In my quest to get inspiration from non-Bitcoin thinkers in the business world, I recently read The Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell. My goal is to see what ideas I may be overlooking as a Bitcoin-focused entrepreneur, writer, and accidental influencer. The book is a fascinating exploration of how ideas, products, and social behaviors spread like epidemics. While I love Gladwell\u2019s writing style, the book seemed almost painfully obvious in the points it was making, but it might be because his book worked as a template for formatting digital virality in the information age, and I am, myself, a product of the world created by this seminal work from about twenty years ago.\n\nGladwell identifies three key factors that contribute to the tipping point:\n\nThe Law of the Few: the impact of influencers. The Stickiness Factor: the impact of messaging and product desire on the market. The Power of Context: the impact of time and place or \u201cluck.\u201d\n\nBy understanding these principles, Gladwell predicted wisely that one could better predict and influence the factors that cause ideas and trends to go viral.\n\nMy thoughts on application to Bitcoin\n\nAs with any epidemic, Bitcoin has reached its tipping point, but not by solving real-world problems such as cross-border remittance, online paywalls, or login authorizations with any significant frequency. Instead, it spent over a decade in protocol and governance debate and morphed into a speculative bubble. We stand to lose the very essence of this ingenious creation if we don\u2019t address the issues that matter.\n\nThe Law of the Few: Bitcoin\u2019s initial adopters, innovators, and tech-savvy enthusiasts have been instrumental in introducing it to the masses. But as bitcoin gained popularity, a new group of influencers emerged: the crypto bros, the rent-seekers, and the speculators. These individuals, driven by the allure of quick profits or cushy consulting positions, have transformed the perception of Bitcoin into a speculative investment, causing drastic price swings and detaching it from its initial purpose. We need the visionaries and entrepreneurs to return to the forefront if we are ever to harness the true potential of Bitcoin. There is an opportunity here to encourage the creation of truly disruptive business.\n\nThe Stickiness Factor: Bitcoin\u2019s stickiness lies in its distributed nature, its cryptographic usefulness, competitive security model, provability of otherwise complex data, and its ability to bypass many inefficient systems. But are these features being fully utilized? Not yet. To ensure Bitcoin\u2019s longevity, entrepreneurs must tap into these attributes and build businesses that leverage the power of the blockchain. By creating solutions for cross-border remittance, online paywalls, and login authorizations, we can anchor Bitcoin\u2019s value in its utility, not just in the whims of the market. Another principle for determining if something is a Bitcoin opportunity is to ask \u201cdo I need to reduce payment friction or increase data integrity?\u201d If the answer is yes, you might have something sticky for Bitcoin.\n\nThe Power of Context: Bitcoin emerged amid the financial crisis of 2008, which eroded trust in centralized institutions, and people presumed it was a response to malpractice by the banks and the state. That defined much of the first half of Bitcoin\u2019s life, and it still informs a lot of the messaging for the \u201cstore of value\u201d people.\n\nToday, the context has shifted. The world is moving towards a borderless digital economy, and the need for more efficient and inclusive financial systems is growing. The factions of bitcoiners have split from each other, and the experiments in boundless payments, trade, identity, and tokenization continue to rage. The time has never been more ripe for businesses to use Bitcoin as a tool to revolutionize the way we transact and interact online.\n\nPrinciples and thoughts\n\nImagine a world where cross-border remittances are instant, cost-effective, and secure. Migrant workers could send money to their families without losing a significant portion to exorbitant fees, thus improving their living conditions and providing a lifeline to developing economies. Bitcoin-based businesses could create platforms that make this vision a reality, enhancing financial inclusion and reducing global inequality.\n\nEnvision a digital landscape where online paywalls no longer hamper access to knowledge and content. Instead, micropayments in Bitcoin could facilitate a fair exchange between creators and consumers. Such a system would encourage the production of high-quality content while ensuring that consumers only pay for what they truly value.\n\nConsider a digital world with a single, secure login authorization that grants access to all online services without the need to remember countless passwords or expose personal information. Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain technology could be the foundation for this revolutionary system, providing a secure, decentralized, and user-friendly authentication process.\n\nHow about tokenizing all assets so they can be more easily valued and traded?\n\nIt is time to shift the conversation from speculation to innovation. Let us not squander the potential of Bitcoin by confining it to the volatile world of market speculation. The power of Bitcoin lies in its ability to reshape the financial landscape, and we must nurture businesses that will turn this potential into reality. We must move beyond the tipping point and bring about a new era of technological and financial revolution.\n\nI am very excited about the Ordinals colored coin protocol that exploded into the bitcoin consciousness this year. It could very well be a uniting factor that brings together value creators on all UTXO chains to share and value real assets globally! But so far, speculation on memecoins and JPEGs has ruled the day. While it\u2019s great to make easy money shockingly fast, we need to be thinking harder about value creation too!\n\nA call to action\n\nLet us rally around the entrepreneurs who dare to challenge the status quo and build businesses that harness the true power of Bitcoin. And let us not forget the promise of a distributed financial future, where barriers are broken, opportunities are equalized, and trust is restored. By embracing this vision and taking decisive action, we can turn the fourteen-year long speculative bubble of Bitcoin into a transformative force that reshapes the world for the better.\n\nSo let us embark on this journey together, driven by the spirit of innovation and the conviction that Bitcoin is more than just a speculative asset\u2014it is the catalyst for change that we\u2019ve been waiting for. We just have to be bold enough to stop waiting.\n\nWhat are some other books I should read to understand virality, the business cycle, and economics, so I can learn more ways to think about bitcoin in their context?\n\nWatch: Kurt answers the viewers most urgent Blockchain and Bitcoin Questions\n\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "content": "Image: Shutterstock\n\nTo \"optimize innovation and enhance the scale of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem,\" the San Francisco-based startup wants to make Bitcoin mining technology \"open source\" wherever possible by selling standalone ASICs and other hardware components. The post claims that the steps taken over the past few months will allow the company to experiment with new designs and aid in delivering more efficient and inexpensive Bitcoin mining chips to the market.\n\nFormer Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's financial services and technology firm, Block, has announced that the prototype design of their new five-nanometer (5nm) Bitcoin (BTC) mining chip is complete. Block claims that this chip is necessary for decentralizing the supply of Bitcoin mining rigs. In a blog post dated April 28th, Block outlined the technical and financial difficulties of creating Bitcoin mining ASIC machines. This has led to what has been called \"the excessive concentration of specialized Bitcoin mining silicon\" within a small number of firms. Block claims that the resulting centralization is detrimental to Bitcoin's decentralized nature.In order to expedite this development drive, Block has acquired a large quantity of ASIC processors from Intel. Intel announced on April 18 that, as part of cost-cutting measures, the company would no longer ship or accept orders for Blockscale 1000 Series ASICs beyond April 2024. According to Block, this enormous influx of ASICs from Intel will expedite the creation of its 3nm processor, which will be the most advanced semiconductor to date upon release.The width of two silicon atoms is approximately similar to one nanometer (1nm). As chip components shrink, it becomes possible to fit more transistors onto a silicon die of the same size. By lowering the overall size, the electric current in the circuit must travel a shorter distance to make a calculation, resulting in an increase in overall efficiency and a decrease in the quantity of heat generated.Notably, 5 nanometer ASIC chips have existed for quite a while now, with the earliest known 5nm ASIC released in 2021 by the Chinese mining company Canaan. Currently, most Bitcoin mining ASICs utilize 5nm circuits, although no company has released the source code for their ASIC chip designs."

        "content": "Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nA town in Bhutan. Image credits: Pema Gyamtsho.\n\nWhen you read about Bhutan in the news, it\u2019s usually something to do with the environment or some progressive policies. Bhutan is famously the only carbon-negative country in the world \u2014 its lush forests sequester more greenhouse gas emissions than the country produces. It\u2019s also one of the countries most committed to environmental conservation, which the country considers one of the key pillars of \u201cGross National Happiness\u201d \u2014 an innovative index Bhutan uses to measure how well-off its citizens are. Bhutan also has remarkably vaccinated around 90% of its citizens against COVID-19 in a week.\n\nThis time, the country is involved in a different type of operation. Bhutan, whose population numbers just under 800,000 people, has been steadily investing in various ambitious projects. But this one is different.\n\nBhutan bullish on Bitcoin\n\nThe tiny kingdom of Bhutan has little natural resources, but it does have immense hydroelectricity potential. Hydroelectric plants have become a major driver of the country\u2019s economy, accounting for around a third of the country\u2019s GDP. In addition to powering the entire country, this hydroelectricity also nabs Bhutan a bit of profit.\n\nBhutan exports over 75% of its electricity (most of it to India). But for the past few years, the country\u2019s royal government has been stealthily devising a new way to generate income from this water: using it to mine Bitcoin. Forbes reports that for the first time, the government confirmed that it was using this electricity to mine crypto, with mining starting \u201ca few years ago as one of the early entrants when the price of Bitcoin was around USD 5,000.\u201d\n\nMining Bitcoin is a very energy-intensive process. According to some estimates, the emissions of Bitcoin are comparable to those of a small or medium-sized country. But if you have a steady supply of clean energy, it\u2019s a different matter. In addition, Bhutan\u2019s high mountains provide excellent air-conditioned places to set up digital asset mining operations which otherwise would consume a lot of power for air conditioning in warmer places.\n\nBhutan reportedly developed this plan in an attempt to generate positive, sustainable returns across a range of asset classes, including crypto. Speaking to local newspaper The Bhutanese, a government official said they\u2019re mining bitcoin in a bid to offset costs and environmental harms.\n\nBhutan is usually known for its rich culture and mountainous landscape. But now, the country wants to take a dive into crypto. Image credits: Aaron Santelices.\n\nA mysterious operation\n\nA representative from Druk Holding and Investments (DHI) said the first priority is Bhutan\u2019s energy requirements, so mining is slowed down or stopped when energy runs low. DHI is Bhutan\u2019s commercial and investment arm of the Royal Government. Nevertheless, the official said that this is a way for the country to diversify its income and establish itself as a player in the rapidly evolving technology landscape.\n\n\u201cWe are fostering relevant human capital for industries of the future, ensuring our citizens are equipped to participate in the modern global economy from within Bhutan. For example, DHI\u2019s investment in building the world\u2019s first Self-Sovereign National Digital Identity platform, which was designed and built locally, represents a significant step in the country\u2019s ongoing digital transformation. Such investments will ensure Bhutan is at the forefront of global innovation,\u201d said DHI.\n\n\u201cOur portfolio contains investments across a range of asset classes that deliver exposure to traditional sectors and the industries driving the modern economy. This includes global equities, fixed income and venture capital investments in promising startups; domestic and international real estate; renewable energy including hydropower generation; healthtech, biotech, life sciences and agritech; and digital asset mining and investment,\u201d said a statement from DHI.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s unclear when exactly the mining began and how profitable it is. The official said the project \u201cpays for itself\u201d, but that\u2019s relatively vague. Perhaps even more imrpotantly, it\u2019s unclear why Bhutan hid the project from its citizens and international partners.\n\nThis is all the more curious as Bhutan is in negotiations with Bitdeer. Bitdeer is a company founded by Chinese billionaire Wu Jihan. However, Bitdeer is listed on the American Nasdaq stock exchange. The company reportedly wants to secure energy for a data center in Bhutan, but this deal is shrouded in secrecy for now.\n\nSustainability and cryptocurrency\n\nBhutan is without a doubt one of the more interesting countries on the planet. A traditional society in a landlocked, mountainous country that embraced technology and progressive measures makes for a pretty unique mixture. But the country\u2019s demographics are in a precarious situation.\n\nEmigration is a big problem for Bhutan, particularly to (believe it or not) Australia. The two countries have thriving diplomatic relations, but Bhutan is seeing many of its educated people leaving the country.\n\nGranted, Bhutan is trying to improve the conditions. It\u2019s tried everything from agriculture and tourism to mines to achieve self-sufficiency. However, with its geography and limited resources, it\u2019s difficult for Bhutan to develop its own successful path. Focusing on environmental protection is a good place to start building a national identity. Can hi-tech elements like crypto mining be the missing puzzle piece?\n\nThe country\u2019s government seems to believe so. Over 10% of the country\u2019s budget in 2022 was invested in computer chips, so they\u2019re betting significantly on this. Mining is definitely a costly and risky endeavor in itself. But with a lot of hydropower on standby, Bhutan could get a chance to exploit this niche and establish itself as a major player in the Bitcoin game.\n\n\u201cThis maybe the first bold effort or experiment of its kind where a Least Developed Country with major developmental disadvantages aims to leap frog into the future using the fourth industrial revolution,\u201d Tenzing Lamsang concludes for The Bhutanese.\n\nWas this helpful?

        "title": "7 Ways To Get Free Bitcoin Now - GOBankingRates",
        "content": "24K-Production / Getty Images\n\nGetting your foot in the door with any investments is the first step in growing your portfolio. The high stakes of investing in cryptocurrency can be lowered if you know where to earn free bitcoin. Free rewards equal easy money, so maybe it is time for you to stop hesitating and start looking into small approachable ways to earn big.\n\nTry These 7 Ways To Get Free Bitcoin\n\nWhether you\u2019re a new investor or a seasoned professional, earning free cryptocurrency is a chance you shouldn\u2019t miss. No need to send in the canary as you won\u2019t need to become an actual miner to stack up some crypto rewards and free bitcoin in these seven ways:\n\n1. Airdrops\n\nMany crypto businesses give away an initial coin offering or a set number of tokens. These can be earned when you perform certain actions or meet specific requirements. Airdrops are the free distribution of these bitcoins or other cryptocurrency tokens. Simply put, it is a marketing tool that crypto companies use to entice you to sign up for the company\u2019s platform. When you satisfy the set requirements, you get a portion of that company\u2019s crypto shared with you, thus letting you earn free crypto.\n\n2. Bounty\n\nIt should be noted that bounties are more specific for those who work with a crypto company. But it is good to know that you can get free bitcoin or other crypto rewards when you complete tasks as a developer. It is usually no small pittance either as you can earn up to $200 in free tokens. In short, a bounty is a bonus given in tokens in exchange for specialized work.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\n3. Brave Browser\n\nOne way to earn free bitcoin is by using Brave Browser for your browsing activities. Brave is a web browser that focuses on your privacy and saves you from data-sucking ads and lower speeds. Another perk is you can earn bitcoin, crypto tokens or even gift cards just by browsing.\n\n4. Cloud Mining\n\nCloud mining is the process of mining cryptocurrency without owning the specific hardware. By renting cloud computing resources with certain companies, you can earn free bitcoin and become a bitcoin miner. For example, Bytebus is a cloud mining service that offers you a $10 sign-up bonus just for registering.\n\n5. CoinMarketCap\n\nCoinMarketCap offers you the opportunity to earn free crypto assets like bitcoin by taking lessons and then testing your knowledge. You simply watch videos about crypto projects, complete quizzes about the videos you watch and then collect your crypto rewards. This system is packed with both educational and financial bonuses.\n\n6. Faucets\n\nBitcoin faucets or crypto faucets are websites and apps that give away free bitcoin in exchange for completing tasks or actions. Though the amount you earn per task is small, it can add up, thus being referred to as a faucet as many small drops of water can add up to a large amount. Here are some examples of actions you can complete to earn free bitcoin:\n\nView ads\n\nWatch videos\n\nComplete a captcha\n\nSolve puzzles\n\nPlay games\n\n7. Staking\n\nStaking involves locking up your funds in your wallet or exchange for a set period of time to help secure the network. By doing this you can earn rewards such as free bitcoin. As you\u2019ll have to do without those funds for that set period make sure you understand what you are staking and that the risk doesn\u2019t outweigh the reward.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\nFinal Take To GO\n\nWhen dealing with bitcoin, keep in mind that at most you are typically dealing with extremely small fractions of a whole.

        "title": "Coach Such: Report suggests bitcoin to peak in 2024, but here's whether its winter over or not - CNBCTV18",
        "content": "As we approach the midpoint of 2023, many cryptocurrency investors and enthusiasts are wondering if the so-called \"crypto winter\" is over. For those unfamiliar with the term, the crypto winter refers to a prolonged period of decline in cryptocurrency prices that began in late 2017 and lasted well into 2018 and 2019.\n\nDuring this time, many cryptocurrencies lost over 90 percent of their value, and the overall market capitalisation of the crypto space shrank significantly. The crypto winter was a brutal time for investors and enthusiasts, and many people began to wonder if the entire crypto industry was doomed to fail.\n\nHowever, in 2020 and 2021, the crypto market began to rebound. Bitcoin, the largest and most well-known cryptocurrency, surpassed its previous all-time high of nearly $20,000 in late 2020 and went on to reach a new all-time high of over $60,000 in early 2021. Other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, also experienced significant gains during this time.\n\nValuation range\n\nA recent media wire reported that the popular cryptocurrency - bitcoin - could reach $100,000 by the end of 2024, according to Standard Chartered report.\n\nThe oscillations of valuations of the cryptocurrencies has been as volatile as your and my mood swings. No one seems to agree with anyone else on why the Crypto pricing is moving higher. Making a prediction on the value of a currency that is still seen as an outsider by global financial regulators is a challenge. At the same time this week, a senior US regulatory official was quoted mentioning that anonymity of Crypto assets is financing illegal activities.\n\nSo it\u2019s more confusing that there are regulatory concerns and open issues pending solutions. And parallely Crypto pricing is trending upward. On the one hand, the recent bull run has certainly been impressive, and many cryptocurrencies have seen significant gains over the past year or so. Bitcoin, in particular, has once again become a mainstream topic of conversation, with major corporations and institutional investors now getting involved in the space.\n\nInstitutional acceptance\n\nOne of the key indicators of a healthy market is the level of institutional adoption. While there has been some progress in this area, with major financial institutions and companies investing in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, there is still a long way to go.\n\nMany institutional investors remain hesitant to enter the market due to the lack of regulatory clarity and the high level of volatility. Until there is a more stable and regulated market, it is unlikely that there will be a significant increase in institutional adoption.\n\nLaw of Economics\n\nSpecifically, for Bitcoin, economics could help them with pricing booster. Bitcoin could be on the upswing due to the fact that in May 2024, the next Bitcoin-halving milestone occurs.\n\nBitcoin halving is when the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks is cut to half of current levels. This event has been programmed by the bitcoin founder to occur every 210,000 blocks ( averaging to every 4 years). This has been one of artificial inflationary adjustment that Bitcoin has in its algorithm. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have a limited supply,\n\nwith a maximum of 21 million Bitcoins that can ever exist. This scarcity can contribute to an increase in price as people compete to buy a limited amount of coins.\n\nThe most recent Bitcoin halving occurred in May 2020, and its impact on pricing has been a topic of much debate in the cryptocurrency community. Data shows that the previous two halvings have been followed by significant increases in Bitcoin prices Inflation\n\nInflation has been a major concern for many individuals and institutions around the world. As central banks continue to print money and inject it into the economy, the value of fiat currencies has been eroded. This has led many people to look for alternative stores of value, such as cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies are not subject to inflation because their supply is limited by design.\n\nOther forms of acceptance\n\nFurthermore, there are several factors that could suggest that the crypto market is entering a new phase of growth. For example, the recent surge in interest in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has demonstrated the potential for cryptocurrencies to be used in new and innovative ways. Additionally, the increasing number of countries and institutions exploring the creation of their own digital currencies could indicate a growing acceptance of cryptocurrency as a legitimate form of money.\n\nCryptocurrencies are seen by many as an attractive alternate against geopolitical risk. Because cryptocurrencies are decentralised and not subject to the actions of any particular government or institution, they can offer a degree of stability in uncertain times. This is a thesis that only few categories of investors with higher risk-perception can manage.\n\nOfficial acceptance ?\n\nBut is the regulatory concerns on the issue of cryptocurrencies over ?\n\nCryptocurrencies have been a hot topic in the financial world for the past few years, and for good reason. While some people view cryptocurrencies as a revolutionary new way to conduct transactions, others see them as a dangerous and unregulated market that could lead to financial instability. Regulatory concerns regarding cryptocurrencies have been voiced by many governments and financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the G20.\n\nOne of the biggest regulatory concerns regarding cryptocurrencies is their lack of transparency. Unlike traditional financial markets, which are regulated by various government agencies, cryptocurrencies are largely unregulated. This means that there is no one overseeing the market to ensure that it is fair and transparent.\n\nThe global financial regulators and institutions like IMF have warned that cryptocurrencies could pose a threat to financial stability if they were to become more widely used. It fears that cryptocurrencies being highly volatile and could lead to market instability, if their prices were to suddenly drop. Many have expressed concerns about the potential for cryptocurrencies to be used for illegal activities, and called for greater regulation of the market.\n\nSimilarly, the G20 has also expressed concerns about the regulatory implications of cryptocurrencies. In a recent statement, the G20 called for greater regulation of the market to ensure that it is fair and transparent. With cryptocurrencies still in their early stages of development, there is a need for greater clarity regarding their legal status and regulatory framework.\n\nWhile some countries, such as Japan and Switzerland, have taken steps to regulate the market, others have been more cautious. The United States, for example, has yet to provide clear guidance on the legal status of cryptocurrencies, leaving investors uncertain about their rights and responsibilities. Until there is greater clarity from regulators around the world, it will be difficult for the market to fully recover.\n\nGains\n\nThe crypto market is notoriously volatile, and prices can change rapidly and dramatically. Just because cryptocurrencies have seen gains recently doesn't mean that those gains will continue indefinitely. Additionally, there are still significant regulatory and security concerns surrounding cryptocurrencies that could hinder their long-term growth.\n\nit is important to consider the psychological impact of the most recent crypto winter. Many investors lost significant amounts of money during the market downturn, which could make them hesitant to re-enter the market. There is also a risk that the market could experience a \"dead cat bounce,\" where prices briefly rise before falling again. This could further erode investor confidence and make it more difficult for the market to recover.\n\nWhile there are certainly signs that the crypto market is entering a new phase of growth, there are also potential pitfalls that could derail that growth. As always, investors should approach the crypto market with caution and do their research before making any investment decisions.\n\n\u2014 The author, Dr. Srinath Sridharan, is a Policy Researcher & Corporate Advisor.

        "content": "Centbee users in Europe can now cash their Bitcoin directly to their euro bank accounts. The new feature gives Bitcoin users the most convenient way yet to spend their digital assets.\n\nWhile Bitcoin payments continue to take root across the globe, fiat is still king. For years, Bitcoin users have had to turn to off-ramp rails that can be inaccessible, unreliable, or costly to spend their Bitcoin. Not anymore.\n\nCentbee now allows its users to cash out their Bitcoin into their bank accounts.\n\nNeed physical cash? Now you can send money straight to your \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa Bank Account from #Centbee and get Euros! It's easy, fast and cheap. All you need is an IBAN number!

The wallet already allows its users to make payments directly with their Bitcoin to some of the world\u2019s biggest retailers, from Walmart (NASDAQ: WMT) to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Users in its native South Africa can pay for utilities, shop, pay for online subscriptions, and more directly with their Bitcoin.\n\nThe latest feature is the next step in the company\u2019s mission. As Gamaroff points out, it bridges the gap for users who wish to keep their cash digitally on the Centbee wallet but may need to draw physical cash at an ATM for offline payments.\n\n\u201cThis new development is a significant step for Centbee and a game-changer for Bitcoin SV holders in Europe. The ability to convert Bitcoin into Euros provides greater flexibility and less uncertainty for those looking to use their digital assets in their day-to-day lives,\u201d Gamaroff tells CoinGeek.\n\nThe new feature comes at a time when BSV has faced delistings from some major exchanges, including Bittrex, Bitvavo, and Robinhood (NASDAQ: HOOD). On the one hand, these delistings serve to unshackle BSV from the near-ubiquitous culture of token speculation prevalent in \u2018crypto circles.\u2019 However, they have also denied millions a convenient, easily-accessible platform to buy and sell Bitcoin.\n\nCentbee \u201caims to provide some much-needed relief\u201d with the new feature.\n\nThe support for European banks is just the start. Gamaroff disclosed that the company is working on bank transfers to several more countries over the coming weeks.\n\nMaking Bitcoin usable\n\nCentbee\u2019s mission is to make Bitcoin usable for day-to-day needs. This includes cross-border transfers, a sector that continues to be burdened by high costs, slow transactions, and overall inefficiency. The wallet offers a simple, intuitive, and cheap alternative to legacy financial systems.\n\n\u201cWith Centbee, users can send money with ease and confidence, knowing that their loved ones will receive it quickly and at a fraction of the cost charged by traditional money transfer operators,\u201d Gamaroff points out.\n\nThe era of utility is finally here. Gone are the days when scrappy white papers with a dash of \u201cto-the-moon\u201d pledges would birth a digital asset unicorn. Many companies that shot to the top based on hype are crumbling as the wheat and the chaff get separated.\n\nCentbee stands tall among the platforms offering users real utility. Gamaroff pledges to continue leveraging the massively scaling BSV blockchain to \u201coffer more efficient and cost-effective financial solutions to our users.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs more people begin to see the advantages of the BSV blockchain, we anticipate continued growth in the adoption of digital currencies and the realization of the transformative potential of blockchain technology.\u201d\n\nCoinGeek Weekly Livestream with Lorien Gamaroff: Enabling BSV Payments to major retailers\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "title": "Why is the Price of Bitcoin Different Across the Other Exchanges - Upstox",
        "content": "Bitcoin is one among the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world. Its value has skyrocketed in recent years. However, its price is often different on different exchanges, which is something most people do not fully understand. In this article, we glance at some reasons for this phenomenon.\n\nFirstly, it is essential to understand that Bitcoin is a decentralised currency. Unlike traditional currencies, which central banks control, Bitcoin is traded peer-to-peer, which means anyone can buy or sell it. As a result, the price of Bitcoin is determined by supply and demand on the open market.\n\nHowever, the supply and demand of Bitcoin may differ on different exchanges due to a variety of factors, such as:\n\nInvest Right, Invest Now Open a FREE*\n\nDemat + Trading account and enjoy Zero commission* on Mutual Funds and IPO \u20b920* per order on Equity, F&O, Commodity and Currency *By signing up you agree to our Terms and Conditions\n\nLiquidity\n\nLiquidity is a critical factor that affects the price of Bitcoin on different exchanges. In general, higher liquidity means more buyers and sellers, which leads to a fairer price. When there is more competition between buyers and sellers, there are tighter bid-ask spreads (the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept).\n\nIn contrast, lower liquidity can lead to higher price volatility, because there are fewer buyers and sellers to stabilise the price. This can create wider bid-ask spreads, so buyers may have to pay more to acquire Bitcoin, and sellers may receive less for selling Bitcoin.\n\nMarket demand\n\nMarket demand is another important factor that can impact the price of Bitcoin on different exchanges. If there is high demand for Bitcoin on a particular exchange, the price will likely be higher than on a deal with lower demand. This is because there are more buyers than sellers, meaning buyers are willing to pay a higher price to acquire Bitcoin.\n\nVarious factors, including media coverage, market sentiment, and global events, can influence demand for Bitcoin. For example, positive media coverage about Bitcoin can create a buzz around cryptocurrency and increase demand. Similarly, negative news about Bitcoin, such as a major hack or regulatory crackdown can lead to a decrease in the number of orders and a corresponding drop in price.\n\nRegulations\n\nRegulations can impact the price of Bitcoin on different exchanges too. Some countries have strict rules on using Bitcoin, which limits the number of available exchanges. This leads to higher prices on exchanges operating within those regulatory frameworks.\n\nFor example, in China, the government has cracked down on Bitcoin trading and mining, causing a decrease in demand for Bitcoin and a corresponding drop in price. Similarly, in the United States, there are strict regulations around Bitcoin exchanges, meaning businesses operating within those regulations may have higher liquidity and price.\n\nGeographical location\n\nGeographical location can play a role in the price of Bitcoin on different exchanges as well. This is because the cost of living can vary widely between countries, impacting the prices buyers and sellers are willing to pay for Bitcoin.\n\nFor example, in a country where the cost of living is high, like Switzerland, buyers may likely have more disposable income. Therefore, they may be willing to pay more for Bitcoin. On the flip side, in a country where the cost of living is low, such as India, buyers may be less willing to pay a high price for Bitcoin.\n\nExchange fees\n\nAnother factor that can impact the price of Bitcoin on different exchanges is the exchange fees. Buyers and sellers may be less inclined to use an exchange if the business has high costs, leading to lower liquidity and price. On the other hand, an exchange with low fees may attract more buyers and sellers, which can lead to higher liquidity and price.\n\nNow that you understand the factors that influence the price of Bitcoin on different exchanges, here are some examples of how this works in practice.\n\nSize of the market\n\nThe market size is another essential factor that can impact the price of Bitcoin on different exchanges. Larger markets tend to have higher liquidity and more stable prices, while smaller markets can be more volatile and have wider bid-ask spreads. This is because larger markets have more buyers and sellers, so there is more competition and a greater likelihood of finding a buyer or seller at a fair price.\n\nAdditionally, the market capitalisation of Bitcoin can impact the price on individual exchanges. If the market capitalisation of Bitcoin is large and growing, it can create positive sentiment around the cryptocurrency and lead to higher demand and prices on all exchanges.\n\nIf the market capitalisation is decreasing, it can lead to a decrease in the number of orders and a corresponding drop in price on all exchanges. For example, the Bitcoin market in the United States is generally more prominent than in many other countries, meaning Bitcoin tends to be priced higher on US exchanges.\n\nExample: Coinbase vs Binance\n\nCoinbase is one of the most popular Bitcoin exchanges in the United States. It has high liquidity and is regulated by the US government. Conversely, Binance is a popular exchange in Asia with lower fees, and it is not regulated by the US government.\n\nAt the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin on Coinbase was around $27,936, while the price on Binance was around $26,071. This is a significant difference that can be attributed to Coinbase having higher liquidity and being regulated by the US government, making it the more trusted exchange for American buyers.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the price of Bitcoin may vary widely between different exchanges due to a range of factors, including liquidity, market demand, regulations, geographical location, exchange fees, and the size of the market. By understanding these factors and carefully choosing which exchanges to buy and sell Bitcoin on, traders and investors can maximise their profits and minimise risks.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that the price of Bitcoin is inherently volatile and subject to change based on a wide range of factors, including global events, media coverage, and market sentiment. Therefore, it's vital to research and stay updated with the latest news and trends, so that you invest carefully and cautiously to avoid significant losses.\n\nUltimately, the success of your Bitcoin investments will depend on your ability to navigate these complex and ever-changing market conditions.\n\nNote: To help plan your trading activities and investment strategies, find here the NSE Holidays 2023, BSE Holidays 2023, MCX Holidays 2023, and Muhurat Trading 2023.

        "title": "Altcoins To Invest In As Bitcoin And Ethereum Surge: OKB, Polygon And Big Eyes Coin - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have experienced a surge in trading prices, with BTC rising to $29,035 and ETH just below $1,900. BTC volume also increased by 84.70% in the last 24 hours. Despite concerns over First Republic Bank, Bitcoin has been steadily rising since hitting a low of $27,217 the day before. The global cryptocurrency market cap also rose by 1.18% in the last 24 hours to around $1.20 trillion, with Bitcoin\u2019s market cap standing at $557 billion. While the market movement remains range bound, here are three altcoins to invest in for great returns: OKB, Polygon (MATIC) and Big Eyes Coin (BIG).\n\nOKB: The Utility Token\n\nOKB is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain that acts as a utility token for OKX exchange users. Traders can receive discounts, access token offerings, and earn interest on their savings depending on the number of OKB tokens held. Additionally, OKB is designed as a deflationary token through the \u201cBuy-Back & Burn\u201d protocol, which burns millions of dollars in OKB tokens every quarter, adding value to holders.\n\nPolygon\u2019s Current Decline A Minor Correction\n\nPolygon (MATIC) is currently below $1 as bears continue to pressure its price. Since April 19th, 2023, it has been on a gradual downtrend to its current price level of $0.966. Although recent price volatility and decline have affected other tokens in the market, MATIC has held onto most of its gains and remains above its January 1st price of $0.76. However, a sweep of previous lows remains possible if the bears maintain their charge, and the crypto market hopes the current decline is a minor correction rather than a downturn similar to the crypto winter of 2022.\n\nBig Eyes Coin To Launch On Top CEX, Uniswap\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) has raised an impressive $34.5 million in presale and is set to launch on a top-tier CEX on June 15th, after the presale ends on June 3rd. The team has not yet confirmed which exchange it will launch on, but speculations are already circulating within the crypto community. The team has developed a roadmap for the next six months explaining the future plans for one of the most-promising. BIG plans to be listed on several exchanges, including Gate.io, Bitget, BKEX, MEXC, LBank, CoinEx, BIT, BitMart, Deepcoin, XT.COM, BitUBU, Hotbit, and BitForex, as part of its exchange roadmap. The team is dedicated to keeping the community informed and engaged throughout the project\u2019s growth and development.\n\nBig Eyes Coin is gaining recognition not only in the cryptocurrency market but also in the non-fungible tokens (NFTs) space. The project team is currently working on developing its own line of NFTs, known as SushiCrew, featuring the project\u2019s iconic cat characters. Each SushiCrew NFT will be unique, with its own set of characteristics and traits, making them highly collectible. The introduction of these NFTs is expected to strengthen Big Eyes Coin\u2019s brand and provide a new revenue stream for the community. The team believes that the NFT market is growing, and by launching SushiCrew NFTs, Big Eyes Coin is well-positioned to take advantage of this trend and establish itself as a significant player in the crypto industry.\n\nThe Big Eyes team expresses gratitude to the CatCrew for their significant support in the Big Eyes Coin project, which has led to the impressive presale amount. With the end of the presale on June 3rd and the launch on a top-tier CEX set for June 15th, the team is confident that Big Eyes Coin is the project to watch in the crypto space.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nOpensea: https://opensea.io/collection/big-eyes-lootbox-cards\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Big Eyes Coin (BIG)has emerged as one of the most substantial and flourishing crypto presales in recent history. Although the presale is nearing its conclusion, investors still have some time left to invest before its closing. As Big Eyes Coin gains momentum in the crypto sector, Bitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin (LTC) are gearing up for halving events. The query arises as to whether these events will have any impact on the triumph of novel coins like Big Eyes Coin.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss Out On Big Eyes Coin\u2019s Presale Success \u2013 Join Now Before It Ends!\n\nThe presale of Big Eyes Coin has been highly successful, with investors eager to acquire this innovative digital asset. The presale has generated over $33 million, making it one of the most prosperous ones in recent times. However, potential investors only have a few days left to participate as the presale ends on June 3rd. Nevertheless, there is still an opportunity to take advantage of this chance and secure a profitable future with Big Eyes Coin. By using the code END300, investors can receive a 300% bonus, making it an even more lucrative venture.\n\nBig Eyes Coin is not just another ordinary cryptocurrency. It is a digital asset with a mission to create a positive impact on the world. The cryptocurrency has pledged to donate 5% of its total supply to support ocean conservation efforts, which not only benefits the planet but also strengthens the cryptocurrency\u2019s success. Big Eyes Coin also fosters a strong community through social media contests and events that create excitement and unity among supporters and investors. With these initiatives, Big Eyes Coin offers a unique investment opportunity that not only provides financial returns but also supports social and environmental causes.\n\nAn Analysis Of Litecoin\u2019s Future Value As The Halving Event Approaches\n\nThe upcoming halving event for Litecoin is scheduled to occur on August 2, 2023, and it takes place every five years. This event involves cutting the block reward for miners by 50%, resulting in them receiving half the number of coins for verifying transactions.\n\nThe purpose of the Litecoin halving is to regulate the supply of coins and prevent inflation. By reducing the block reward, the amount of Litecoin in circulation will decrease, making it scarcer and possibly increasing its value. This is viewed as a positive event that creates a feeling of rarity and demand for cryptocurrency.\n\nThe Most Anticipated Moment In Cryptocurrency History: The Upcoming Bitcoin Halving Event\n\nBitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the world, underwent its third crypto halving on May 11, 2020, marking a significant event in the cryptocurrency industry. The halving event, which happens every 210,000 blocks and reduces the block reward for miners by 50%, took place after approximately four years. Like Litecoin, the primary aim of Bitcoin halving is to control coin supply and prevent inflation. The reduction in block reward makes Bitcoin rarer and could potentially increase its value, creating a bullish scenario for the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe Litecoin and Bitcoin halving events are crucial moments in the cryptocurrency industry that could generate bullish momentum. A decrease in block reward reduces the coin supply, creating a sense of scarcity and demand for digital assets. However, mining profitability could be affected, which might impact the overall network hash rate.\n\nInvestors interested in Big Eyes Coin can leverage potential bullish momentum during the bull market and invest in a cryptocurrency with a high potential ROI, taking advantage of the halving events.\n\nGo to Big Eyes Coin\u2019s website or visit them on social media:\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Slips Below $30k While Binance Coin (BNB) And Collateral Network Prices Surge Upwards - TechCabal",
        "content": "The DeFi market recently experienced one of its largest price surges in over a year. Bitcoin (BTC) broke the $30k barrier, hitting $30,979 before decreasing in price over the past two weeks. While much of the market has also slowed, Binance Coin (BNB) and Collateral Network (COLT) have remained strong with the latter seeing a price increase of 40%.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Slips Below $30k\n\nAfter causing huge trading volume surges following its price increase, Bitcoin (BTC) has gradually decreased in value. As of April 25th, one Bitcoin (BTC) is selling for $27,337, and daily trading volume has dipped from over $20 billion to $15 billion.\n\nThis Bitcoin (BTC) decrease has caused many other cryptocurrencies to decline over the past two weeks, with some projects losing over 10% of their value. Nonetheless, Bitcoin (BTC) investors remain optimistic. This recent growth shows the crypto industry is back on the rise after the recent bear market.\n\nAdditionally, as investors continue to question the strength of the traditional banking system, the value of Bitcoin (BTC) is expected to spike several times over the next few months. As a result, some investors are using this recent decline as an opportunity to buy more Bitcoin (BTC) before it rises.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) Stays Green While The Market Declines\n\nDespite projects like Solana (SOL) losing over 6% of their value in the last five days, Binance Coin (BNB) is thriving. Binance Coin (BNB) increased in value by 1.70% to $329.98 in the last five days, and trading volume is also rising. This is refreshing news for holders after recent negative media attention around the Binance exchange.\n\nInvestors and analysts are now becoming more optimistic about Binance Coin (BNB), as it\u2019s shown that it\u2019s not reliant on Bitcoin (BTC) fluctuations. Furthermore, the Binance Chain recently announced that it will reduce gas fees from 5 gwei to 3 gwei. This is huge news for Binance Coin (BNB), as lower gas fees could lead to greater adoption. Therefore, analysts believe that Binance Coin (BNB) could experience additional price increases over the next few weeks.\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) Price Rises 40% In April\n\nMuch like Binance Coin (BNB), Collateral Network is outperforming Bitcoin. Over the past month, Collateral Network (COLT) has increased by 40%, supporting analysts\u2019 predictions that the project could surge 35x before its presale ends.\n\nCollateral Network is completely unique compared to other DeFi projects. It\u2019s designed to revolutionize crowdlending and disrupt traditional borrowing methods. Using Collateral Network\u2019s advanced DeFi platform, borrowers can unlock liquidity from high-value physical assets such as jewelry, fine art, vintage cars, and real estate.\n\nBorrowers\u2019 physical assets are first sent to Collateral Network (COLT) directly, which uses AI to accurately determine the assets\u2019 value. These are brought on-chain as NFTs, later fractionalized in pieces, allowing lenders to buy the number of fractions they wish and earn a passive income in return. The borrower is then required to pay back the loan with interest. If they miss their payments and default on returning the loan, the physical asset will be auctioned to Collateral Network token holders at private auctions.\n\nThis innovative application makes crowdlending more efficient, removes entry barriers, and guarantees the highest level of security with 2FA security options.\n\nWith its real-world use case, doxxed team (full KYC) and unique lending protocol disrupting a $trillion market, Collateral network has all the makings of a blue chip project that everybody can get involved with.\n\nCOLT tokens are selling fast at a current price of only $0.014, the price has already increased 40% with another increase imminent. Now could be a good time to take advantage and add a token to your portfolio that is estimated to grow by 3500%.\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://app.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nShare this article"
