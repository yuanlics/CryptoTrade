        "content": "The price of bitcoin fell Friday following a report that recent bitcoin filings from big names such as BlackRock and Fidelity have been deemed inadequate in the eyes of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nBitcoin finished the day below the flat line at $30,398.43, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier, it briefly fell under the $30,000 level, after rising as high as $31,260.52.\n\nBitcoin ended the week down 1.5%. Nevertheless, it finished the month up 12.3%, following a down month in May, which was the cryptocurrency's first losing month of the year and worst month since November 2022. June's positive performance brought its year-to-date gains to 83%.\n\nThe move came after The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that the SEC told Nasdaq and Cboe Global Markets, both of which filed bitcoin exchange-traded funds applications on behalf of various institutions this month, that the filings aren't sufficiently clear or comprehensive.\n\nSpecifically, the SEC said it returned the filings because they didn't name the spot bitcoin exchange that the Nasdaq and Cboe would have a \"surveillance-sharing agreement\" with or provide enough detail about the arrangement, according to the report.\n\nThe filings can be resubmitted. A Cboe spokesperson told CNBC that the exchange plans to update and refile."

        "content": "The price of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization slumped on Friday morning from above $31,000 to briefly below $30,000, dropping approximately 3% in a matter of minutes.\n\nThe sudden dip in Bitcoin follows a report from the Wall Street Journal that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission told securities exchanges Nasdaq and Cboe their applications for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund, which they submitted on behalf of asset managers like BlackRock, were \u201cinadequate.\u201d\n\nNasdaq and Cboe weren\u2019t specific enough in their filings, the U.S. regulatory agency said, pointing out that their ETF applications did not outline the nature of surveillance-sharing agreements\u2014key provisions to allay the SEC\u2019s concern over market manipulation\u2014that BlackRock, Fidelity, and other asset managers had touted. It also said the exchanges did not name the Bitcoin spot exchanges the asset managers planned to partner with in these agreements.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s reported comments may just be a temporary setback, however, as Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed to a section of the Journal\u2019s report in which the agency said the exchanges can update their applications and refile. Balchunas added the report is \u201carguably good news.\u201d\n\nThe drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price follows a weeks-long rally that saw the cryptocurrency reach its highest price in more than a year amid a flurry of ETF applications from big institutions.\n\nIn mid-June, BlackRock, the U.S.\u2019s largest asset manager, filed an application for a Bitcoin spot ETF. As of yet, no asset manager has successfully received the SEC\u2019s approval for such an ETF, which would expose Bitcoin to trillions in dollars from brokerage accounts and pension funds. (The SEC has approved, however, a Bitcoin futures ETF.)\n\nThe crypto market rallied on news of BlackRock\u2019s filing, optimistic that a firm of its stature would be the first to successfully pass the federal agency\u2019s muster and prove that, through a surveillance-sharing agreement with Nasdaq, it can weed out market manipulation, a reason the SEC has repeatedly cited in its denials of Bitcoin spot ETF applications.\n\nOther large asset managers, including WisdomTree, Invesco, Bitwise, ARK Invest, and Fidelity, followed BlackRock\u2019s lead, and either resubmitted or updated existing ETF applications with their own surveillance-sharing agreements.\n\nBitcoin responded accordingly and has consistently traded above $30,000 in the latter half of June, an almost 100% increase in price since January."

        "content": "Though the Securities and Exchange Commission has reportedly rejected filings for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund from BlackRock, Fidelity and a handful of other asset managers, crypto-enthusiasts are optimistic that the product will soon achieve approval.\n\nThe regulator informed exchanges that the filings weren\u2019t sufficiently clear or comprehensive, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday, citing unnamed sources. While there are already ETFs on the market tracking bitcoin futures or companies that work in the cryptocurrency space, the SEC has rejected around 30 applications for an ETF that tracks the actual price of bitcoin since 2017.\n\nCrypto-enthusiasts believe these products will increase participation in bitcoin investing by allowing investors and financial advisors to buy and sell using traditional brokerage accounts. Many hoped the backing of BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager and provider of ETFs, represented the best chance yet for a product to reach approval.\n\nThe fact that the SEC rejected the applications in just two weeks, rather than use more of the 45-day window it has to make a decision, is actually a good sign that the agency is ready to approve the product, said Steve Sanduski, a certified financial planner who coaches and trains advisors.\n\nPast products were rejected for worries about fraud and market manipulation, while this latest round was rejected for not providing enough information about the plans for \u201csurveillance-sharing agreements\u201d with a bitcoin exchange, according to the WSJ.\n\n\u201cBy telling the exchanges exactly what was missing in their filings, the applicants will simply answer those questions and resubmit their application,\u201d Sanduski said in an email. \u201cThis practically screams, \u2018We\u2019re ready to approve.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe SEC has cracked down on cryptocurrency players recently, including a lawsuit against Coinbase filed on June 8. By hammering rule-breakers in the space, the SEC is clearing the way for firms who operate within the law, Sanduski said.\n\n\u201cOnce the SEC gets comfortable that most market manipulation can be rooted out, and any remaining manipulation can be tracked and prosecuted, I think we\u2019ll see the ETFs get approved,\u201d he said.\n\nThe price of bitcoin has surged 20% since BlackRock announced its application. Shares of Coinbase, which is listed as the custodian for BlackRock\u2019s holdings, have climbed 30%.\n\nIn addition to Fidelity, Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Investment Management, Invesco, WisdomTree, Bitwise Asset Management and Valkyrie have refiled or amended their own applications for a spot bitcoin ETF, according to the WSJ.\n\nIt remains to be seen how much a product will encourage more financial advisors to recommend the asset to clients. Some view the risk of allocating to bitcoin as outweighing the reward \u2014 in terms of market volatility and client backlash \u2014 while there are also traditionalists who will never change their mind about cryptocurrencies, Sanduski said.\n\n\u201cOver time, as bitcoin continues to prove its resilience, I expect most advisors will get comfortable with it and it will become a rather common allocation,\u201d he said."

At this moment, with heat waves covering the southwest and wildfire smoke filling skies across the country, the need for urgent climate action is clear. Given Bitcoin\u2019s destructive climate record, BlackRock and its peers should engage in efforts to clean up the cryptocurrency. Instead, BlackRock is looking the other direction and actively promoting Bitcoin as a mainstream investment. This is accelerating the clock on the Bitcoin carbon time bomb by driving up its exchange value.\u201d\n\nGreenpeace USA\u2019s forthcoming analysis of major banks and asset managers reveals BlackRock as one of Bitcoin\u2019s biggest backers in the financial services industry. The asset manager is a leading investor in the Bitcoin mining industry and promotes Bitcoin adoption through its investment products and services. The energy-intensive nature of Bitcoin mining, coupled with BlackRock\u2019s investments in the sector, raises serious concerns about the company\u2019s contributions to environmental degradation, carbon emissions, and community impacts. Greenpeace USA continues to call on BlackRock to take meaningful action, including a meeting to address Bitcoin\u2019s climate impacts.\n\n###\n\nContact: Gigi Singh, Senior Communications Specialist at Greenpeace USA (+1) 631-404-9977, [email protected]\n\nGreenpeace USA is part of a global network of independent campaigning organizations that use peaceful protest and creative communication to expose global environmental problems and promote solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful future.

        "content": "This year has been a litmus test for the crypto market as it determines whether it can bounce back from a dismal 2022.\n\nIn June, bitcoin's price hit its highest point of the year thus far, topping out at around $31,200 per coin. But on Friday, bitcoin's price dipped below $30,000 once again before recovering some of the losses.\n\nMuch of the volatility is being attributed by market watchers to news that more traditional financial firms are looking for ways to be involved in the crypto market. Investment companies BlackRock and Fidelity both filed for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) this month, coinciding with the start of a bitcoin rally that brought the coin\u2019s price up by over $6,000 per coin.\n\nBut on Friday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) says those filings may not be adequate. Here's what investors need to know.\n\nWhat is a spot bitcoin ETF?\n\nBitcoin futures ETFs are already on the market, so you may be wondering what the difference is between a bitcoin futures ETF and a spot bitcoin ETF. Most simply, the difference is that a spot bitcoin ETF would directly follow the price of bitcoin, while bitcoin futures ETFs track the price of bitcoin futures contracts.\n\nAs Omid Malekan, adjunct professor at Columbia Business School explains, futures ETFs operate less efficiently than spot ETFs because they expire, and companies must roll their positions from contract to contract. This creates price friction and added costs that can be avoided by spot ETFs.\n\nMalekan says a spot ETF is likely what many bitcoin investors are really craving. Plenty of companies have tried to receive approval for spot bitcoin ETFs from the SEC. Asset manager Grayscale filed for one last year and, upon rejection, began a still-ongoing lawsuit against the agency for its ambiguity regarding the demands of a crypto spot fund.\n\nWhy has bitcoin's price been rallying?\n\nBlackRock's status makes its filing seem different from those previous in investors' eyes, Malekan says.\n\n\"It's the biggest asset manager, and it has a successful track record in getting ETFs approved,\" he says. \"There's a general perception that a company like BlackRock would not be doing this if they didn't think the regulatory environment in the U.S. was going to improve going forward.\"\n\nThere's also the fact that the crypto industry dealt with a lot of uncertainty in the industry last year, stemming from events like the implosion of the major crypto exchange FTX or the collapse of TerraUSD, a \"stablecoin.\"\n\nMalekan says that uncertainty could be cooling down, which is helping bitcoin's price.\n\n\"People have been expecting the worst about a lot of things including the regulatory crackdown, which is happening,\" Malekan says, referencing a recent lawsuit against Coinbase by the SEC as an example. \"Coinbase stock actually is now significantly higher than when the SEC revealed its lawsuit, and I think it's a case of the actual news being less bad than what was anticipated.\"\n\nWhy did bitcoin's price dip Friday?\n\nInvestors who were confident in the near-term potential of a bitcoin spot ETF should probably hold their confidence, though. Just two weeks after BlackRock's filing, a Friday report by the Wall Street Journal said that the SEC has already decided that recent ETF filings \u2014 including BlackRock, Fidelity and others \u2014 remain inadequate for approval. Specifically, the Journal reports that the agency says that filings are not clear nor comprehensive enough \u2014 a complaint it has made in many of its rejections of spot bitcoin ETFs over the years.\n\nOn Friday morning, bitcoin prices dropped by more than $1,200 following the report before recovering some of the losses.\n\nMore from Money:\n\nBitcoin Is Less Than a Year Away From a Much-Hyped Event That Has Historically Seen Its Price Soar\n\nInvestors Are Building up Their Cash Reserves \u2014 Millennials Especially\n\nHere\u2019s Where Investors Plan to Put More Money in the Early Days of the Bull Market"

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin was designed so that no one group or person could control it. Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized design has many advantages, but things can get tricky when there are disagreements with the community about the best way forward.\n\nSuch disagreements have led to more than 100 Bitcoin forks.\n\nNot all of those forks have led to new networks, but of those that have, Bitcoin Cash is probably the best known.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Cash?\n\nBitcoin Cash is a modified version of Bitcoin that runs on its own blockchain network. It works in almost the same way as Bitcoin, but there are several key differences.\n\nThe largest difference is block size, or how much transaction information a single block on each chain can handle.\n\nOn the Bitcoin network, each block is 1 MB in size. Immediately after the Bitcoin Cash fork, the Bitcoin Cash block size was 8 MB, eight times bigger than on the Bitcoin network. In May 2018, Bitcoin increased its block size again, this time to 32 MB.\n\nThis means that Bitcoin Cash can now process 32 times as much information per block as Bitcoin can. As a result, Bitcoin Cash transactions tend to be faster and have lower fees. Security may be lower on the Bitcoin Cash network, though, as less mining power goes into mining each Bitcoin Cash block.\n\nDid you know? Bitcoin Cash is sometimes abbreviated to Bcash.\n\nWho invented it?\n\nThe idea for Bitcoin Cash was put forward by a group of Bitcoin developers. However, the person most directly connected to the currency today is Roger Ver, an early Bitcoin adopter and investor.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA brief history\n\nJune 2017 - A group of developers and miners on Bitcoin put forward a proposal called Bitcoin ABC, which wanted to increase the block size.\n\n- A group of developers and miners on Bitcoin put forward a proposal called Bitcoin ABC, which wanted to increase the block size. July 2017 - Not everyone agreed on the proposed change.\n\n- Not everyone agreed on the proposed change. August 2017 - Bitcoin hard forks, leading to the creation of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.\n\n- Bitcoin hard forks, leading to the creation of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. March 2018 - Bitcoin Cash payments accepted on BitPay.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash payments accepted on BitPay. May 2018 - Bitcoin Cash increased block size from 8 MB to 32 MB.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash increased block size from 8 MB to 32 MB. November 2018 - Bitcoin Cash went through another hard fork, to create Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash went through another hard fork, to create Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV. November 2020 - Bitcoin Cash forked a third time, this time to Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN) and Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCHA), and Bitcoin Cash Node went on to be called Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\n\n- Bitcoin Cash forked a third time, this time to Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN) and Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCHA), and Bitcoin Cash Node went on to be called Bitcoin Cash (BCH). June 2021 - SmartBCH, a Bitcoin Cash sidechain, was launched.\n\n- SmartBCH, a Bitcoin Cash sidechain, was launched. May 2023 - Integration of Cashtokens, Allow Transactions to be smaller, P2SH32, Restrict Transaction Versions.\n\n- Integration of Cashtokens, Allow Transactions to be smaller, P2SH32, Restrict Transaction Versions. June 2023: EDX, the digital asset exchange backed by Wall Street giants Fidelity, Citadel and Charles Schwab, announces it will list BCH\n\nWhat\u2019s so special about it?\n\nBitcoin Cash shares many of the same features as Bitcoin, but has faster transaction times and lower fees. Though Bitcoin might be better known, Bitcoin Cash has supporters who believe that Bitcoin Cash is closer to the original purpose and vision of the Bitcoin project.\n\nDid you know? Bitcoin Cash was the first successful fork in Bitcoin, and it remains the one with the highest market cap except for Bitcoin itself.\n\nHow is Bitcoin Cash produced?\n\nBitcoin Cash, because it shares the same background as Bitcoin, is produced in the same way. Miners compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles through a proof-of-work process.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nIt operates in much the same way as Bitcoin\u2014the only differences for users are that the Bitcoin Cash network can verify transactions more quickly than Bitcoin, and it typically charges lower fees.\n\nYou need a Bitcoin Cash wallet to send and receive the currency, and it can be used to pay for a variety of goods and services."

        "content": "WisdomTree is attempting to launch a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund even though its peers have failed.\n\nThe firm filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last week, making it its second bitcoin ETF application after an initial rejection two years ago.\n\nHowever, WisdomTree's Jeremy Schwartz believes this time could be different.\n\n\"We've been able to successfully launch products in Europe,\" the firm's global chief investment officer said on CNBC's \"ETF Edge\" this week. \"The European regulators have been more friendly, and they've been able to get comfortable with the mechanisms, the custodians [and] how the markets work.\"\n\nThe SEC rejected WisdomTree's previous applications in 2021 and 2022 on the notion they came in short to protect investors and the public interest.\n\nSchwartz hopes the changes made in the firm's updated filing will satisfy regulators.\n\n\"Some of the new filings have these data sharing agreements, surveillance sharing, new ways of doing it,\" he said. \"Now the question is: Will that address the SEC's concern on market manipulation? But that is one of the things I think we're all trying to address.\"\n\nWisdomTree's latest launch effort comes during an increased appetite for bitcoin . As of late Friday, prices are up almost 84% so far this year.\n\n\"It's hard for me to comment too much about all the details while you're in these [filing] periods,\" Schwartz said when \"ETF Edge\" host Bob Pisani asked him why he thinks the SEC will approve the spot bitcoin ETF this time. \"But I think the key is, will the exchanges share data \u2026 and [will the SEC] have more comfort than what was previously done before? I think the data sharing agreements are the key element for that.\"\n\nIt appears interest is climbing.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing this week, Fidelity Investments is also trying to launch a spot bitcoin ETF despite its prior failures. It joins WisdomTree, BlackRock, VanEck and Invesco."

        "content": "Bitcoin rose 2.36% from June 23 to June 30 to US$30,802 at 7:30 p.m. Friday in Hong Kong. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been trading above US$30,000 since June 23. Ether rose 0.55% over the week to US$1,890.\n\ndOuePXPwA z4ORRoAMae66YAl51jC5\n\nThe growth of institutional interest in cryptocurrencies continued. After weeks of rumors and reports, asset management giant Fidelity submitted its spot Bitcoin ETF application, following the likes of BlackRock, Valkyrie Investments and WisdomTree.\n\nBitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, briefly rose to US$31,173 in the 24 hours following Fidelity\u2019s application.\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s recent positive momentum can be attributed to the buzz around institutional players preparing to set up traditional financial instruments such as exchange-traded funds for cryptocurrencies,\u201d Jonas Betz, crypto market analyst and founder of consultancy firm Betz Crypto, told Forkast.\n\n\u201cThis could potentially lead to increased buying pressure as new investors, previously wary of cryptocurrencies due to a lack of knowledge about how to facilitate direct crypto exposure, can easily enter these vehicles to gain exposure to crypto.\u201d\n\nMax Breus, the co-founder and chief executive officer of Ubix Network, a protocol that connects blockchains with different consensus mechanisms, said that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accepting a spot Bitcoin ETF application would bring significant upside for Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cEach new request to the SEC increases the chances of getting a positive decision\u2026 This will allow crypto to integrate deeper into global financial markets,\u201d said Breus in a statement shared with Forkast.\n\nBinance\u2019s troubles extended in Europe this week as the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange announced on Wednesday that it will be changing its euro banking partner from Sept. 25, after Paysafe Payment Solutions said it will stop offering euro payment support for the exchange. This came two weeks after reports surfaced of Binance France being investigated for money laundering and the illegal provision of digital asset services.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.2 trillion on Friday at 7:00 p.m. in Hong Kong, up 2.56% from US$ 1.17 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. With a market cap of US$597 billion, Bitcoin represented 50% of the market while Ether, valued at US$227 billion, accounted for 19%.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 50% dominance is its highest mark in over two years. Bitcoin last accounted for more than half of the crypto market on April 25, 2021, when it traded above US$53,000.\n\n\u201cMicroStrategy Inc. bought US$347 million of Bitcoin in the second quarter. Perhaps this explains the growing dominance of Bitcoin,\u201d said Breus.\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s hawkish remarks signaled two or more interest rate hikes towards the end of the year. Powell also warned that the U.S. banking turmoil may not be over, citing funding vulnerabilities.\n\nNotable Movers: BCH & COMP\n\nBitcoin Cash was this week\u2019s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins. Bitcoin Cash rose 115.15% to US$306.75, starting its uptrend after June 20, when EDX Markets, a crypto exchange backed by Citadel, Fidelity and Charles Schwab, listed the coin.\n\nAlgorithmic yield generator Compound\u2019s governance token, COMP, was this week\u2019s second biggest gainer in the top 100. The token rose 89.44% to US$57.14, picking up significant momentum on Thursday, a day after Compound CEO Robert Leshner announced the founding of a new company focused on creating regulated financial products bridging traditional markets and blockchain.\n\nAccording to on-chain intelligence firm Lookonchain, a whale wallet withdrew US$5.53 million worth of Comp tokens from Binance on Thursday, contributing to the token\u2019s price surge.\n\nSee related article: Why the US is waging war on Binance, Coinbase\n\nNext week: Can Bitcoin remain above US$30,500?\n\nNext week, investors will be looking for the release of the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s (FOMC) meeting, for hints on the Fed\u2019s future monetary policy. The minutes of the meeting are set to release on Wednesday, shortly before a speech from FOMC Member John Williams, followed by a speech from Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas CEO Lorie K. Logan on Thursday.\n\nThe U.S. non-farm payroll report for June is scheduled for next Friday. The report is used by investors to gauge the health of the labor market and offer indications on the Fed\u2019s upcoming interest rate decisions.\n\nMeanwhile, investors will be eagerly watching the SEC\u2019s response to the mounting spot Bitcoin ETF applications. According to Lucas Kiely, the chief investment officer of digital asset platform Yield App, a positive response could breathe life into the crypto market and attract more institutional investors.\n\n\u201cIf Bitcoin manages to remain above US$30,500 for numerous closes and maintains that support level, there is a significantly increased likelihood of a bullish trend continuing. Conversely, if Bitcoin fails to remain above this level or experiences a significant drop below US$25,000, it could signal a bearish trend,\u201d said Kiely.\n\nSee related article: Crypto firms eye Hong Kong amid tough US regulations, says fintech association chair"

U.S. GDP grew faster than expected in the first quarter and initial jobless claims came in at less than expected. Also, asset manager Fidelity Investments on Thursday filed to offer a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nAll top 10 cryptos rise\n\nBitcoin climbed 1.05% to US$30,453 over the last 24 hours to 6:40 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is up 1.43% over the past seven days.\n\nEther rose 1.28% to US$1,853, but is down 1.4% for the week.\n\nAll top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded higher. Solana led the gains on a 12.35% jump and a 7.56% weekly gain. This despite the Thursday announcement from Cardinal, a Solana non-fungible token (NFT) protocol, that it will be winding down operations due to what it called a challenging macroeconomic environment.\n\nCardinal tweeted on Thursday that the team will disable new deposit instructions on July 19 and cease operations on features including staking and new NFT rentals.\n\nElsewhere, Fidelity has refiled an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF. The Thursday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shows that the COBE exchange has proposed to list and trade shares of the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust. The SEC rejected a Bitcoin ETF application from Fidelity in 2021.\n\nFidelity\u2019s move follows a wave of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF applications submitted by asset managers this month, including BlackRock, WisdomTree, Invesco and Bitwise, indicating institutions are confident in the profit potential of digital assets and demand.\n\n\u201cTo this point, the lack of a spot Bitcoin ETP exposes U.S. investor assets to significant risk because investors that would otherwise seek crypto asset exposure through a spot Bitcoin ETP are forced to find alternative exposure through generally riskier means,\u201d the Fidelity filing said.\n\nOn Wednesday, investment management fund ARK Invest also filed an amendment to its April application for a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap rose 1.24% to US$1.17 trillion, with trading volume dropping 12.22% to US$29.96 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nLong-term Azuki collectors sell out\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the NFT market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.79% to 2,852.82 in the 24 hours to 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index is down 1.79% for the week.\n\nNFT trading volume on Ethereum dropped 19.79% to US$20.87 million over the past 24 hours, while volume on the Bitcoin network rose 357.82% to US$13.38 million, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nSales of Uncategorized Ordinals \u2014 CryptoSlam\u2019s category of Bitcoin Ordinals that are not part of one established collection \u2014 rose 7.22% to US$9.25 million, making it the most-sold collection in the past day.\n\nSolana-based SMB Barrel Raffle, which started public minting on Thursday, saw the second-largest daily volume of US$5.1 million.\n\nTrading volume of Azuki Elementals dropped 46.5% to US$2.95 million, and the original Azuki collection saw a 7.76% drop to US$2.79 million.\n\nWhile the new Azuki Elementals sold out its 20,000 NFTs within 15 minutes when it began minting on Tuesday, collectors were \u201cangry\u201d as the new NFTs looked almost identical to the original Azuki collection, according to Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. That could potentially devalue the NFT collection as a whole, he said.\n\n\u201cTonight [on Thursday] the founder of Azuki, Zagabond, is meeting with the community to discuss the week\u2019s mint, and likely address concerns,\u201d Petscher said.\n\nAccording to data analytics firm Nansen on Twitter on Thursday: \u201cAzuki and Beanz collectors that have held for over 1 year have been selling their NFTs post-Elementals mint.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, art auction house Sotheby\u2019s plans to launch a new generative art program, or work generated from algorithms. That will be in partnership with Art Blocks, which powers generative minting technology to brands and artists, according to a Wednesday statement shared with Forkast via email.\n\n\u201cThis will allow generative art long form collections to be minted right on Sotheby\u2019s own platform,\u201d Petscher said. \u201cGenerative art is really beginning to spread its wings following the sale of \u2018The Goose\u2019 \u2014 The Ringers #879 \u2014 for US$5.4 million (US$6.2 million with fees) on June 15.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s economy contracts for third month\n\nA steel factory oin Nantong, Jiangsu Province of China. Image: Getty Images\n\nAsia equity markets were mixed on the last day of the quarter as investors assessed fresh economic data from the U.S. and China.\n\nU.S. stock futures edged higher as of 11:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures edged up 0.01%, S&P 500 futures climbed 0.08%, and Nasdaq Futures added 0.19%.\n\nU.S. economic growth expanded faster than estimated in the first quarter, according to official data released Thursday. In the first quarter, the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) rose by an annualized rate of 2%, up from the previously estimated 1.3%.\n\nThe amount of initial jobless claims in the U.S. dropped by 26,000 to 239,000 for the week ended June 24, the largest decrease since October 2021.\n\nThe robust economic showing in the U.S. wasn\u2019t repeated in China, where the country\u2019s manufacturing activity contracted in June for the third month, the National Bureau of Statistics said Friday. The official manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index came in at 49.0 for the month, compared to 48.8 in May. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.\n\nChinese Premier Li Qiang said on Tuesday that China was still on track to meet its 5% annual growth target.\n\nInvestors, however, still need to contend with more interest rate hikes this year in the world\u2019s biggest economy. U.S. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly said the Fed may raise rates at the next two meetings and repeated that message at a central bank gathering in Portugal this week.\n\nU.S. interest rates are now between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts an 86.8% chance for a 25-basis-point rate hike at the Fed\u2019s next meeting on July 26. It predicts a 13.2% chance the Fed will leave rates unchanged.\n\n(Updates to add equities section.)"

        "title": "Why Ethereum, Shiba Inu, and Bitcoin Cash Are Rising Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nMost cryptocurrencies moved higher today, as more mainstream financial institutions filed to launch spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and as altcoins gained steam.\n\nSince late afternoon yesterday, the price of the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH -1.59%), traded 3.4% higher as of 10:35 a.m. ET today. Meanwhile, the price of the meme token Shiba Inu (SHIB 2.48%) traded 4.5% higher, while the price of Bitcoin Cash (BCH -1.17%) had jumped nearly 26%.\n\nSo what\n\nEver since the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF, cryptocurrencies have been rallying on the belief that more interest in the sector from mainstream financial giants will ultimately increase exposure.\n\nWhile other spot Bitcoin ETFs have been rejected by the SEC, BlackRock's filing seemed to change the game because it proposed a surveillance-sharing agreement with the Nasdaq, where it intends to list the ETF. This agreement would share information about trading activity and the identity of customers, which the SEC believes is necessary to prevent market manipulation.\n\nFollowing BlackRock, a swarm of other players have proposed Bitcoin ETFs with the SEC and the latest is Fidelity, which has also proposed to have a surveillance-sharing agreement. These ETFs would ultimately make it easier for investors to gain access to Bitcoin without having to buy the cryptocurrency itself.\n\nIn other news, Bitcoin Cash has been exploding higher all week, most recently on a ton of trading volume out of investors in South Korea. The excitement continues to be fueled by the news that Bitcoin Cash is one of four cryptocurrencies being listed by a new exchange called EDX Markets, which is backed by Fidelity, Charles Schwab, and Citadel.\n\nInterestingly, the exchange decided to list Bitcoin Cash because it believes regulators are likely to determine that the cryptocurrency is a commodity and not a security. Whether or not cryptocurrencies are commodities or securities is a big point of contention in the crypto ecosystem right now. Commodities would be regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, while securities would be overseen by what is presumed to be the much stricter SEC.\n\nIn more regulatory news today, a new bill that formally recognizes cryptocurrencies as a regulated financial instrument and investment was officially made a law today in the United Kingdom. Many believe that regulatory clarity is a necessity for crypto to be able to move forward.\n\nNow what\n\nNews regarding spot Bitcoin ETFs has been the biggest driver of cryptocurrencies in recent weeks, so it makes sense that the news regarding Fidelity continued to fuel the sector today.\n\nBut the fact that investors are pouring into Bitcoin Cash because they think the token is likely to be deemed a commodity instead of a security is interesting and could represent a newer trend in the industry.\n\nWith the SEC seemingly getting more aggressive in its attempts to bring more cryptocurrencies under its purview, investors may start to favor those that they view as commodities. While I still like Ethereum the best in this group of cryptocurrencies, this is certainly a trend that bears watching."

        "content": "Traditional financial firms finally believe that digital assets are here to stay. Or so one might conclude from the slew of announcements last week from some of the world\u2019s premiere financial players.\n\nAmong them is BlackRock \u2014 the world\u2019s largest asset manager with $9 trillion in assets under management (AUM) \u2014 filed for permission to build a \u201cspot market\u201d Bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) \u2014 something the United States Securities and Exchange Commission has resolutely resisted.\n\nOthers include Fidelity Investments, Charles Schwab and Citadel launching EDX, a new cryptocurrency exchange. In Germany, Deutsche Bank \u2014 boasting $1.4 trillion in balance sheet assets \u2014 applied for a license to custody crypto. There were others too.\n\nCollectively, these developments boosted crypto trading markets. Bitcoin (BTC) gained 20% in the week, surpassing the $30,000 mark for the first time since April. If allowed, a BlackRock Bitcoin ETF listing on the Nasdaq stock exchange would arguably make Bitcoin more accessible to a larger investing public.\n\nSome even anticipated a stampede to Bitcoin due to the BlackRock filing, as others followed with their own, including Invesco and WisdomTree. Fidelity Investments filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF on June 29.\n\n\u201cThe Great Accumulation has begun,\u201d declared Cameron Winklevoss on Twitter, while MicroStrategy\u2019s Michael Saylor added, \u201cThe window to front-run institutional demand for #Bitcoin is closing.\u201d\n\nThe Great Accumulation of bitcoin has begun. Anyone watching the flurry of ETF filings understands the window to purchase pre-IPO bitcoin before ETFs go live and open the floodgates is closing fast. If bitcoin was the most obvious and best investment of the previous decade, this\u2026 \u2014 Cameron Winklevoss (@cameron) June 21, 2023\n\nOthers professed little shock about these developments, however, even after a year of crypto-related scandals, bankruptcies, lawsuits and regulatory uncertainty in the United States. By this view, the institutions were just bowing to the inevitable.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised, since from a fundamental point of view, the movement of digital value is the next obvious evolution of the internet,\u201d Jim Kyung-Soo Liew, associate professor of finance at Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, told Cointelegraph. \u201cWhat is surprising is how the U.S. hasn\u2019t embraced it.\u201d\n\nLast week\u2019s events raise some questions: How enduring are Bitcoin\u2019s most recent price gains? There have been institutional investor sightings before. Will this time be different, or will Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies resume their sideways market activity?\n\nOn the other hand, a firm the size of BlackRock really could transform the BTC market, some believe.\n\nBitcoin has a fixed supply limit of 21 million BTC and its existing inventory is relatively illiquid. Sixty-eight percent of BTC in circulation hasn\u2019t moved at all in the past year, according to Glassnode. There isn\u2019t a lot of stock on the shelves for BlackRock and others to snap up, in other words. If demand exceeds supply, doesn\u2019t that inevitably mean price gains for BTC?\n\nMagazine: How smart people invest in dumb memecoins: 3-point plan for success\n\nAlso, where do retail investors fit in among the new institutional arrivals? Maybe ordinary crypto users are also needed to stabilize the price of Bitcoin.\n\nFinally, assuming the so-called Great Accumulation really is happening, how far can it go? The cryptoverse has a market capitalization of about $1 trillion today, roughly half of which is in Bitcoin. Could the crypto market cap reach a 10-fold increase of $10 trillion in five years?\n\nHas the \u201cgreat accumulation\u201d begun?\n\n\u201cAnyone watching the flurry of ETF filings understands the window to purchase pre-IPO bitcoin before ETFs go live and open the floodgates is closing fast,\u201d declared Winklevoss, adding: \u201cIf bitcoin was the most obvious and best investment of the previous decade, this [spot Bitcoin ETF] will likely be the most obvious and best trade of this decade.\u201d\n\nIs the co-founder of the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange right?\n\n\u201cClearly, there is significant investor demand for Bitcoin access through regulated investment funds from a broad spectrum of U.S. investors,\u201d Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks, told Cointelegraph, \u201cOtherwise, BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco and other major asset managers would not have filed S-1s for Bitcoin ETFs.\u201d\n\nThe entry of BlackRock and other investment managers into this new asset class isn\u2019t so unexpected, either. \u201cWe\u2019ve long known that BlackRock is enabling BTC investments for clients through their Aladdin platform and Bitcoin private fund,\u201d Doug Schwenk, CEO of Digital Asset Research, told Cointelegraph.\n\nThe recent negative news stories swirling around Binance and Coinbase \u201care not related to Bitcoin and may be seen as an opportune time for a better-known, more regulated brand to provide alternatives that end-buyers can trust. A BTC ETF is a natural step.\u201d\n\nWinklevoss, Saylor and others warn that retail investors had better buy Bitcoin now to get its ostensibly cheaper \u201cpre-IPO\u201d price before BTC\u2019s price skyrockets. Are they correct?\n\n\u201cThere is some truth to that given the finite supply of Bitcoin and increasingly low rate of supply growth,\u201d added Chung. \u201cHowever, plenty of investors bought in the $50k to $69k range and they are still underwater; on top of that, cash earns 5%+ at the moment. To me, trying to time the market, especially one as volatile as crypto, is a fool\u2019s errand.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the Winklevoss scenario \u201cdepends on how certain one is that institutions are truly coming and that the ETFs and other infrastructure plays by large institutions will play out,\u201d Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of business development for the Asia-Pacific region at Keyrock \u2014 a Europe-based digital asset market maker \u2014 told Cointelegraph.\n\n\u201cForward-looking investors will probably try to front-run that move and buy before any of this is truly released. I\u2019m personally a bit less certain about how soon this will happen, though,\u201d d\u2019Anethan added.\n\nAssuming BlackRock succeeds in its ETF quest and other institutional investors follow, would that stabilize the price of Bitcoin at a substantially higher level than the current $30,000? Or does long-term price stability also require broad retail participation?\n\n\u201cIt all depends how much AUM they can gather if they are approved,\u201d answered Chung. \u201cIf it\u2019s a substantial amount, then it stands to reason that it would lift the price substantially given the finite supply. Bitcoin and its price is agnostic as to who buys Bitcoin and through what means. Buying demand just has to outstrip selling demand and the price will appreciate.\u201d\n\nCarol Alexander, professor of finance at the University of Sussex Business School, told Cointelegraph that a slew of spot Bitcoin ETFs could actually make BTC less stable and more volatile. \u201cIf there\u2019s too many ETFs, all these market makers trying to hedge their positions could be selling at the same time or buying at the same time. It could increase volatility\u2026 I disagree with what Winklevoss said.\u201d\n\nAlexander has her own BTC price scenario, which assigns retail investors a key role. In March, when BTC was trading around $20,000, she predicted the coin would rise to $30,000 by June and move sideways through the summer. That has largely come to pass. \u201cSo the question is, what\u2019s going to be happening in September?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it will \u2014 but it could go up to around $50,000. That\u2019s because people come back after the summer, and there\u2019s more liquidity in the markets.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s also because retail investors are no longer scared after the long string of crypto drawdowns, scandals, bankruptcies and regulatory actions of the past year. The growing investment in the digital asset market by large financial institutions like Fidelity Investments and JPMorgan Chase has arguably had a calming effect on retail investors.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to be seeing much more acceptance from really ordinary people starting in September as you get some more regulatory clarity about things. That extra volume of trades could bring the price back up to \u2014 I\u2019m not saying $68,000 where it was, that would be too high [...] \u2014 but there\u2019s that sweet area around the $50,000 mark, which I think will be the next long-term resistance level.\u201d\n\nIn a June 19 global survey by Nomura Laser Digital, 90% of professional investors said it was \u201cimportant\u201d that any digital-asset funds or investments have the backing of a large traditional financial institution \u2014 at least before considering putting their clients\u2019 money into it. Maybe this past week\u2019s announcements by BlackRock, Fidelity, Deutsche Bank, et al. are the signal they were waiting for.\n\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Schwenk said. \u201cOnly time will tell. It\u2019s hard to pick when the tipping point will be. We have had participation from other large traditional firms \u2014 BNY Mellon, State Street, Standard Chartered, Franklin Templeton, etc. That hasn\u2019t been enough to satisfy the respondents in the survey yet, but eventually, they will see enough momentum.\u201d\n\nTen-fold growth over five years?\n\nIn the medium term, how high could things go? With the active participation of large TradFi firms like BlackRock, Fidelity and Deutsche Bank, could crypto market capitalization grow from $1 trillion to $10 trillion or more over the next five years, for instance?\n\n\u201cFive years ago, the entire market cap of liquid crypto, as measured by the CF Large Cap Index, was around $250 billion and hit a high of around $2.6 trillion in late 2021,\u201d said Chung. \u201cSo 10X would seem to be within the realms of possibility.\u201d\n\nMajor institutions putting their distribution networks to work to support further adoption would also provide \u201ca significant tailwind,\u201d he added. \u201cHowever, interest rates were not 5% in that previous five-year period \u2014 they are now. What impact that might have is impossible to know.\u201d\n\nRecent: Open source: Buzzword or real security for crypto wallets?\n\nAlexander was less bullish. \u201cA Bitcoin ETF \u2014 I don\u2019t even see that it\u2019s needed.\u201d Most ETFs are a basket of equities or a basket of currencies. An ETF with a basket of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether (ETH) and Solana (SOL) \u201cwould make a lot more sense,\u201d in her view.\n\n\u2018Exciting times\u2019 for Bitcoin?\n\nSightings of institutional investors just outside the boundaries of the cryptoverse have been reported before, but they have never quite entered en masse. Why might this time be different?\n\n\u201cInstitutional investors are very slow and thoughtful in their due diligence process,\u201d Johns Hopkins\u2019 Liew said, but \u201cthey have finally come to see the Bitcoin light. It\u2019s just too exciting to pass up and their customers are pushing them for products.\u201d From an empirical perspective, some crypto exposure is a good means of diversifying an investment portfolio, he noted, summarizing:\n\n\u201cIf institutional investors enter the party, their demand would certainly drive prices higher. It would definitely be exciting times for BTC.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe involvement of large financial institutions, whether it be for ETF applications or the new EDX exchanges, represent a significant shift and a decisive moment for crypto markets, in the U.S. and globally,\u201d concluded d\u2019Anethan."

        "content": "American investors are increasingly flocking to Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) as major financial institutions ramp up their engagement, bolstering the cryptocurrency's recent surge.\n\nThis information was highlighted by K33 Research, a cryptocurrency analytics firm, in one of their reports, Coindesk reported.\n\nBitcoin witnessed a remarkable 85% surge this year, outshining the majority of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThis positive trend is attributed to the growing involvement of financial giants such as BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), Fidelity and Citadel, which has been a catalyst in boosting investor confidence.\n\nOn the other hand, alternative cryptocurrencies have faced difficulties in the wake of heightened regulatory investigations, particularly concerning their status as unregistered securities.\n\nConsequently, trading platforms have exercised caution and limited the availability of popular tokens in order to circumvent potential risks.\n\nThe report also shed light on Bitcoin's appreciable gains during U.S. market hours, amassing approximately 30% in cumulative gains since plummeting to around $16,000.\n\nInterestingly, the U.S. market outperformed its Asian and European counterparts.\n\nThe activity in the U.S. witnessed a significant spike after BlackRock, the world-renowned asset management firm, submitted an application for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund on June 14.\n\nThe SEC rejected the application today (June 30) as being inadequate. BlackRock can resubmit if it wishes.\n\nAlso Read: The Tax Tides Turn As Slovakia Becomes A Crypto Dreamland\n\nBitcoin has also lately shown signs of disassociation from the U.S. stock markets, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.\n\nAccording to K33, Bitcoin's 30-day correlation with these markets turned negative last week, marking the first such instance since January 2021.\n\nVetle Lunde, a senior analyst at K33, mentioned that \"This illustrates that U.S. traders are allocating in BTC due to idiosyncratic reasons\" and suggested that this could be a move towards portfolio diversification.\n\nBlackRock's proactive steps have played a significant role in reinvigorating institutional participation in the Bitcoin market.\n\nThe Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), which is popular among seasoned investment companies, witnessed open interest approaching its peak, as indicated by K33's data.\n\nAdditionally, digital asset funds reported inflows of $199 million last week, the highest in nearly a year, with Bitcoin-focused funds accounting for 94% of these inflows.\n\nThis was revealed in a separate report by asset management company CoinShares.\n\nRead Next: Binance's Expansion Thwarted: German Regulator Denies Crypto Exchange License\n\nJoin Benzinga's Future of Crypto in New York City on Nov. 14, 2023, to stay updated on trends like AI, regulations, SEC actions & institutional adoption in the crypto space.

However, the SEC has approved various ETFs that own bitcoin futures, not the underlying coin itself.\n\nPart of the SEC's concern with the latest bitcoin ETF applications was that they didn't provide enough information about the \"surveillance-sharing agreement\" they would implement to ensure that the ETF was not susceptible to fraud.\n\nThe CBOE said it plans to revise and resubmit its bitcoin ETF filing, which would push back a potential approval by at least another week after the SEC receives the application, according to the WSJ report."

        "content": "Bitcoin was designed so that no one group or person could control it. Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized design has many advantages, but things can get tricky when there are disagreements with the community about the best way forward.\n\nSuch disagreements have led to more than 100 Bitcoin forks.\n\nNot all of those forks have led to new networks, but of those that have, Bitcoin Cash is probably the best known.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Cash?\n\nBitcoin Cash is a modified version of Bitcoin that runs on its own blockchain network. It works in almost the same way as Bitcoin, but there are several key differences.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) Surges 33.9% in 24 Hours on EDX Listing, S. Korean Trading Spike\n\nThe largest difference is block size, or how much transaction information a single block on each chain can handle.\n\nOn the Bitcoin network, each block is 1 MB in size. Immediately after the Bitcoin Cash fork, the Bitcoin Cash block size was 8 MB, eight times bigger than on the Bitcoin network. In May 2018, Bitcoin increased its block size again, this time to 32 MB.\n\nThis means that Bitcoin Cash can now process 32 times as much information per block as Bitcoin can. As a result, Bitcoin Cash transactions tend to be faster and have lower fees. Security may be lower on the Bitcoin Cash network, though, as less mining power goes into mining each Bitcoin Cash block.\n\nBitcoin Cash is sometimes abbreviated to Bcash.\n\nWho invented it?\n\nThe idea for Bitcoin Cash was put forward by a group of Bitcoin developers. However, the person most directly connected to the currency today is Roger Ver, an early Bitcoin adopter and investor.\n\nA brief history\n\nJune 2017 - A group of developers and miners on Bitcoin put forward a proposal called Bitcoin ABC, which wanted to increase the block size.\n\nJuly 2017 - Not everyone agreed on the proposed change.\n\nAugust 2017 - Bitcoin hard forks, leading to the creation of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nMarch 2018 - Bitcoin Cash payments accepted on BitPay.\n\nMay 2018 - Bitcoin Cash increased block size from 8 MB to 32 MB.\n\nNovember 2018 - Bitcoin Cash went through another hard fork, to create Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV.\n\nNovember 2020 - Bitcoin Cash forked a third time, this time to Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN) and Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCHA), and Bitcoin Cash Node went on to be called Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\n\nJune 2021 - SmartBCH, a Bitcoin Cash sidechain, was launched.\n\nMay 2023 - Integration of Cashtokens, Allow Transactions to be smaller, P2SH32, Restrict Transaction Versions.\n\nJune 2023: EDX, the digital asset exchange backed by Wall Street giants Fidelity, Citadel and Charles Schwab, announces it will list BCH\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat\u2019s so special about it?\n\nBitcoin Cash shares many of the same features as Bitcoin, but has faster transaction times and lower fees. Though Bitcoin might be better known, Bitcoin Cash has supporters who believe that Bitcoin Cash is closer to the original purpose and vision of the Bitcoin project.\n\nBitcoin Cash was the first successful fork in Bitcoin, and it remains the one with the highest market cap except for Bitcoin itself.\n\nHow is Bitcoin Cash produced?\n\nBitcoin Cash, because it shares the same background as Bitcoin, is produced in the same way. Miners compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles through a proof-of-work process.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nIt operates in much the same way as Bitcoin\u2014the only differences for users are that the Bitcoin Cash network can verify transactions more quickly than Bitcoin, and it typically charges lower fees.\n\nYou need a Bitcoin Cash wallet to send and receive the currency, and it can be used to pay for a variety of goods and services."

The deal, first reported in August 2022, cost $885 million and is expected to allow investors exposure to Bitcoin Depot on the Nasdaq starting July 3.\n\n$GSRM & Bitcoin Depot deal closing PR.

Investors will be able to find shares of Bitcoin Depot under the ticker symbols BTM and BTMWW for its common stock and public warrants, respectively.\n\nRelated: Net Bitcoin ATMs record an increase after 4 months of global downtrend\n\nThe announcement came amid regulatory scrutiny of firms in the U.S. offering crypto products or services.

        "content": "There is no doubt that BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application \u2014 and the flood of contenders that followed \u2014 has buoyed the bulls. It could signal the winds of change in the regulatory sphere, they say. It could bring Bitcoin exposure to the masses, they holler.\n\nWhile there might be some truth in these statements, we need to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. We should not be in a world where the mere possibility of a spot Bitcoin ETF coming to fruition in the United States sends markets into overdrive. BlackRock\u2019s potentially oversized impact on Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price trajectory should give everyone in the Bitcoin community pause for thought rather than be a cause of celebration.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF would clearly be a simple way for U.S. retirement funds to gain exposure to Bitcoin\u2019s upside, and it\u2019s very possible that an approved ETF in the U.S. would drive significant price appreciation in the years that follow. But what will it do to further Bitcoin\u2019s cause \u2014 to decentralize finance, empower the unbanked and revolutionize how we interact with money globally? Very little, if anything.\n\nThe TradFi invasion\n\nBlackRock\u2019s application and the discussions around it have certainly served as a reminder of the distrust that exists between some parts of the crypto community and the traditional finance world.\n\nRelated: Ripple verdict could spark a new bull market \u2014 or more malaise\n\nThe timing of BlackRock\u2019s foray into Bitcoin ETFs is particularly intriguing and has sent conspiracists wild. Given the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, some believe the agency is disarming crypto-native firms to pave the way for the likes of BlackRock to take over the crypto mantle.\n\nOf course, such claims are unsubstantiated speculation. However, they demonstrate how the more deeply involved traditional finance (TradFi) entities become in the digital assets space, the more we risk Bitcoin becoming just another asset class and losing sight of its intended purpose and true value proposition.\n\nThese are the key dates and timeline for the BlackRock Spot Bitcoin ETF\n\n\n\nThis is how I'm positioning over the coming weeks... pic.twitter.com/V1Kwvbh8Rc \u2014 \u039e huf (@hufhaus9) June 26, 2023\n\nWhen you delve further into the details of BlackRock\u2019s filing, the alarm bells start ringing louder. The filing makes a provision that in the event of a hard fork, BlackRock can \u201cuse its discretion to determine which network should be considered the appropriate network for the Trust\u2019s purposes.\u201d This could potentially be significant, enabling BlackRock to attempt to weigh in on Bitcoin\u2019s direction \u2014 or at least steer institutional allocations and mainstream uptake.\n\nOversized influence on what is intended to be a decentralized monetary system is clearly a cause for concern in and of itself, but the broader issue with ETFs is that investors cannot withdraw the underlying Bitcoin. It\u2019s in the ownership of Bitcoin that the true benefits lie.\n\nUpholding Bitcoin\u2019s ethos\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that Bitcoin was created as a direct response to the bailouts and quantitative easing that followed the 2008 financial crisis. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin has a limited supply, is genuinely scarce and operates with decentralized governance.\n\nFifteen years on from the crash, central banks around the world can still not break the habit of printing money, using it as a \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card. Except it is nothing but free. Ordinary, hard-working individuals the world over are paying the price as their currencies are debased, which is now exacerbated by soaring nontransitory inflation.\n\nRelated: Gary Gensler is hurting the little guys for Wall Street\n\nWhile central banks play Russian roulette with public finances, Bitcoin\u2019s ethos is to empower individuals by providing a censorship-resistant, borderless form of money. As an open-source monetary network, Bitcoin has the power to transform the way we interact with money. It could significantly reduce the importance of centralized institutions \u2014 perhaps even render them obsolete \u2014 which the conspiracists would say TradFi knows only too well.\n\nBitcoin ETFs seem at odds with this empowerment ethos. El Salvador \u2014 with its radical approach to Bitcoin adoption \u2014 is arguably more aligned with Bitcoin\u2019s core aims than any ETF could ever be. While El Salvador seeks to empower the unbanked through actively promoting Bitcoin ownership, Bitcoin ETF investors will be left without any of the benefits of Bitcoin while lining the pockets of \u2014 and cementing the status of \u2014 TradFi institutions.\n\nOwnership over price speculation\n\nBitcoin spot ETFs are likely to establish a stronger presence within the cryptocurrency ecosystem in the years to come and appeal to a certain class of investors, yet their role should not overshadow the trajectory of Bitcoin\u2019s future. If we only focus on giving people exposure to price movements without actual ownership, then we will have totally missed the point of what could be a revolutionary monetary system. And no, if a rule is ever proposed that demands retail can only invest via ETFs rather than through direct ownership, this is not \u201cconsumer protection.\u201d It spells their disempowerment.\n\nOur industry should maintain a cautious stance, understanding that the increasing involvement of ETFs and traditional finance in the cryptosphere could pose risks to the underlying purpose of Bitcoin. Being alert to these risks means not getting blinded by the hype, but remaining committed to the original ethos of Bitcoin \u2014 a tool to transform the world\u2019s financial systems, not merely an asset for speculation.\n\nBen Caselin is vice president and chief strategy officer at MaskEX, a digital assets trading platform headquartered in Dubai, UAE.

        "title": "Why approving a Bitcoin ETF might unleash $18B in sell-pressure - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The introduction of a spot-based Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) would make the asset more accessible to individual investors and mutual funds. What\u2019s more, unlike a futures-based Bitcoin ETF, a spot-based ETF involves actually buying BTC.\n\nSo, will the approval of the first Bitcoin ETF be a bullish event? Not necessarily.\n\nGBTC \u2018discount\u2019 remains in the double digits\n\nOver the years, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rejected every Bitcoin ETF applicant, with the latest denial issued to the VanEck Bitcoin Trust on March 10, 2023.\n\nThe SEC concluded that the offer did not have a \u201ccomprehensive surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size related to spot Bitcoin.\u201c Regulators are hesitant to release what many believe would be a more equitable and transparent Bitcoin product.\n\nInvestors now question whether the latest bids from ARK Invest and BlackRock to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs might be the solution to Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), an investment vehicle with shares traded on the stock exchange.\n\nInterestingly, the GBTC \u201cpremium\u201d jumped to its best levels in months after BlackRock announced its ETF filing.\n\nGrayscale GBTC premium/discount to net assets. Source: CoinGlass\n\nBut while the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF might seem bullish initially, its consequences for the BTC price can be negative, at least in the short term.\n\nWhat\u2019s an ETF?\n\nFirst, an ETF is a form of security that holds diverse underlying investments, such as commodities, stocks and bonds. The ETF may resemble a mutual fund because its issuer pools and manages the given assets.\n\nThe most well-known example of this instrument is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, which tracks the S&P 500 index. State Street manages the mutual fund\u2019s $436 billion worth of assets.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETF race gets hotter as ARK Invest adds surveillance agreement to application\n\nBuying an ETF grants the investor direct ownership of the fund\u2019s contents, resulting in different tax consequences than holding futures contracts or leveraged positions. While Bitcoin spot ETFs continue to be rejected, identical products have been available for decades for bonds, global currencies, gold, Chinese equities, real estate and oil.\n\n30% GBTC discount is likely justified\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust \u2014 an investment fund with $18.4 billion of assets under management \u2014 is currently trading at a -30% discount versus its Bitcoin holdings. This gap between their 626,778 Bitcoin at market value and the GBTC shares trading on regular stock exchanges reached as low as -49% in December 2022.\n\nConsequently, this discount is likely justified as the instrument lacks the tools to allow arbitrage. Grayscale\u2019s GBTC is the undisputed leader in the cryptocurrency market, despite being classified as a closed-end fund, which means that the number of available shares is limited.\n\nShares of GBTC are not freely created, nor do they have a redemption plan. Due to this inefficiency, there are large price differences when compared to the fund\u2019s actual Bitcoin holdings. In contrast, an ETF gives the market maker the ability to issue and redeem shares, ensuring that the premium or discount is typically small.\n\nGBTC charges a set 2% annual administrative fee; therefore, the discount may be acceptable given that the SEC continues to reject appeals and requests from all fund managers.\n\nOn the other hand, ETFs typically trade at par with net assets, as opposed to GBTC. For example, the Purpose Bitcoin ETF (BTCC.U) held a $5.63 net asset value per share on June 27, and the shares closed at $5.65 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\n\nSimilarly, the U.S. derivatives ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF underlying price was $16.89 on June 28, while its shares traded at $16.89.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF approval might initially pressure BTC\n\nEssentially, an investment trust product is considerably less desirable than an ETF, and Grayscale has done little to mitigate the impact on GBTC investors thus far. However, market sentiment improved modestly after the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, filed to launch a Bitcoin spot price ETF.\n\nThe share price discount versus its contents will eventually trend to zero as redemptions and arbitrage opportunities arise if the SEC grants the asset manager Grayscale permission to convert its GBTC Trust to a bonafide Bitcoin ETF.\n\nIn this scenario, the odds are that a considerable amount of BTC could enter the market as investors will finally be able to exit their position at par.\n\nThe only question is: how much of that $18 billion will flow into other Bitcoin-related instruments or get sold on exchanges?\n\nIn any case, there\u2019s a good chance that a spot Bitcoin ETF approval will produce significant sell-pressure from Grayscale\u2019s GBTC conversion as BTC that\u2019s been locked for three to eight years reenters the market.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "There may be a longer wait for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, as the Securities and Exchange Commission labeled investment managers\u2019 recent applications inadequate.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, the securities regulator told the Nasdaq and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) that their filings are not \u201csufficiently clear and comprehensive.\u201d These exchanges represent asset managers in the filing of the financial product.\n\nIn the eyes of the SEC, the exchanges should have named the spot Bitcoin exchange with which they would have a \"surveillance-sharing agreement\" or provided sufficient information about the details of those surveillance arrangements. However, asset managers can resubmit the filings after clarifying the information.\n\nA flurry of applications has been filed over the past few weeks since BlackRock joined the list of companies seeking to debut the first spot Bitcoin ETF of Wall Street. BlackRock\u2019s application introduced a \u201csurveillance sharing agreement,\u201d under which information about market trading and clearing activities are shared between entities to avoid the possibility of market manipulation.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s application led ARK Invest and 21Shares to amend their third application for a spot BTC ETF to include a similar surveillance agreement. Other asset managers that refiled or amended their applications in the past days include Invesco, WisdomTree, Valkyrie and Fidelity. ARK Invest, however, is reportedly a front-runner in this race.\n\nETFs track a specific index and are generally traded on exchanges. In the cryptocurrency market, a fund that tracks the price of one or multiple digital tokens and consists of various cryptocurrencies is called a cryptocurrency ETF.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs have been denied since 2017 by the SEC. In Canada, however, the financial product is already available.

        "content": "Fidelity Investments is the latest financial services heavyweight to throw its name into the race to offer the first U.S. exchange-traded fund investing directly in bitcoin.\n\nThe Boston-based asset manager, which has about $11 trillion in assets under administration and tens of millions of customers, refiled for the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, according to a document submitted Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Similar to previous U.S. spot bitcoin ETF filings in the past few weeks, the updated application says that Fidelity expects to enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement with a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest high-profile traditional finance firm to join the race, after BlackRock Inc. made a splash with its June 15 application for a spot ETF, which opened the floodgates for others to try their hand at it, as well. For crypto fans, it\u2019s been a significant string of developments given BlackRock\u2019s reputation on Wall Street, and the view held by some market-watchers that the asset manager wouldn\u2019t be making an attempt were it not confident it could get regulatory approval.\n\nThere have been about 30 tries for a spot-bitcoin product, according to a tally from Bloomberg Intelligence. But applications have faced opposition by regulators, who have in the past cited market concerns and a lack of investor protections, among other things. Fidelity originally filed for the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust in 2021, which was denied by the SEC in January 2022, according to a Fidelity spokesperson.\n\nEven so, BlackRock\u2019s move spurred a number of similar filings from other issuers, including by Invesco Ltd., WisdomTree, Valkyrie and Bitwise. Meanwhile, Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Investment Management has said that it believes it could be first in line to get any potential regulatory approval. ARK had in April, in conjunction with crypto-issuer 21Shares, refiled its application for one.\n\nTo be sure, this isn\u2019t the first hype cycle over a potential launch. Crypto fans, who have been yearning for a spot-bitcoin ETF for years, have been through periods of excitement before, only for regulators to ultimately rebuff all attempts.\n\nWhile BlackRock\u2019s filing was credited by observers for helping to push the price of bitcoin to a one-year high last week, the market reaction to the Fidelity refiling was fairly muted. Bitcoin was up about 1.5% to $30,500 as of 2:25 p.m. Thursday in New York, though off the highest level of the day.\n\n[More: Crypto exchange backed by Citadel Securities, Fidelity, Schwab starts up]"

EDXM will only allow the trade of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, LiteCoin, and Ethereum. These tokens are ones excluded from the war the SEC is waging against crypto.\n\nNaturally, the news caused Bitcoin Cash to witness a surge in its price, increasing by 24% overnight.\n\nNow, Upbit, a Korean crypto exchange, reports an increase in Bitcoin Cash trading volumes reaching $557.63 million in the past 24 hours. The sudden increase shows an almost 350% increase in the token\u2019s activity on Upbit.\n\nBCH now trades for ~$320, the highest price Bitcoin Cash has reached in over a year.\n\nLawrence Lewitinn, Director of Content for The Tie, a crypto data company, stated that \u201cthe BCH rally can be seen as a combination of hope and a touch of greed, two of the ingredients that often fuel market movements in the cryptocurrency space, regardless of underlying fundamentals,\u201d\n\nHowever, Lewitinn failed to mention one more key factor that may have influenced the support for Bitcoin Cash, governmental support.\n\nBitcoin Cash\u2019s SEC Clearance\n\nIt\u2019s no secret at this point that the US Securities and Exchange Commission is waging a serious war against crypto. The regulating body is battling against the world\u2019s biggest exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase, and Ripple.\n\nThe crux of the SEC\u2019s argument in each case is that these exchanges are trading in what the SEC recognizes as \u201cunregistered securities\u201d. However, these cases never include any mention of four specific tokens: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, LiteCoin, and Ethereum.\n\nGensler himself admitted, way before he became the SEC Chair, that these coins are \u201cnot securities\u201d, effectively recognizing them as \u201ccommodities\u201d. And, with that in mind, these tokens are immune to SEC attacks on the matter.\n\nFor that very reason, EDXM took the smart decision to only allow trading using those tokens. On top of that, asset management firms such as BlackRock and Fidelity are filing spot ETFs that only concern Bitcoin.\n\nIf Lewitinn is right, then BCH and Co should be on a steady trajectory towards much higher prices by the end of the year as they gain more and more interest from institutional investors."

        "content": "TOKYO -- Bitcoin's position as the top player in the cryptocurrency market is solidifying as the prospect of an inflow of money from institutional investors has lifted the virtual asset to its highest point in a year.\n\nBitcoin touched a year-to-date high above $31,000 last Saturday, amid a surge that followed BlackRock's June 15 application to U.S. regulators for an exchange-traded fund based on the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin's share of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrency assets topped 50% for the first time in more than two years, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission repeatedly rejected filings for bitcoin ETFs not based on futures contracts over the risk of manipulation in the spot bitcoin market.\n\nBlackRock aims to allay these concerns through an expected agreement with Nasdaq, where the fund would be listed, for \"surveillance-sharing\" of a bitcoin trading platform, though The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that the SEC said its filing remains inadequate.\n\nIf the regulator ultimately accepts this solution, hopes are high that it will open the door to more ETFs. BlackRock's filing was followed by a string of applications from other big institutions.\n\nThis month has also seen the launch of EDX Markets, a new digital asset exchange for accredited investors backed by Fidelity, Charles Schwab and Citadel Securities, that will enable trading of bitcoin and Ethereum, among other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe platform says it will follow best practices from traditional bourses, which had been an issue with other cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Binance, which was sued by the SEC this month.\n\nThese developments have reassured some market players that problems like the collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange have not turned institutional investors away from cryptocurrency. Spot bitcoin ETFs are expected to be used by financial institutions as a way to hold the asset with no need for a wallet.\n\nInstitutional money appears to already be moving back into the market. Trading of bitcoin futures contracts has picked up on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and nearly $200 million flowed into major bitcoin investment products last week, the most since July 2022, according to data from CoinShares.\n\n\"Hedge funds specializing in cryptocurrency have recently begun to trade more aggressively with our company,\" said Midori Kanemitsu at Japanese exchange operator bitFlyer.\n\nRetail investors, meanwhile, have been less than enthusiastic this year. The number of active addresses on the bitcoin network has stayed largely flat since late 2021, and the number of new addresses being created each month is down to less than a tenth of its peak that year.\n\nDespite the growing anticipation around bitcoin, \"there's no indication that individuals are starting to trade actively,\" Kanemitsu said.\n\nThis sluggish activity is hitting smaller cryptocurrencies like Cardano and Solana, which are seeing much slower growth than bitcoin. Trading platforms popular with retail investors, such as Robinhood, are moving to end support for trading these tokens, and the risk of an SEC crackdown has made institutional investors even more leery of them."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) continues its uptrend that started after its listing on Citadel Securities, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Charles Schwab Corp.,-backed EDX Markets on June 20.\n\nThe BCH token is the highest weekly gainer in the top 300 tokens by market capitalization on CoinGecko, with 114.3% gains.\n\nIn comparison, Bitcoin (BTC) recorded 2.4% gains in the same period, while Ethereum (ETH) traded at par with last week\u2019s price.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe latest 33.9% gain in BCH\u2019s price in the last 24 hours appears to be driven by excess negative bets in the derivatives market fueling an uptrend and heightened trading interest on a South Korean exchange.\n\nA vertical rise\n\nThe EDX Markets exchange listing is considered by some to be a good proxy for the state of BCH's regulatory clearance. Jamil Nazarali, CEO of EDX Markets, deemed that the four crypto tokens listed on EDX Markets (Bitcoin, Ether, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin) were safe bets in terms of compliance with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nBCH\u2019s price was heavily suppressed for the calendar year, ranging between $100 and $150. Nevertheless, it has risen vertically after its listing on EDX Markets. BCH was last trading at $308.72, levels last seen 14 months ago in May 2022.\n\nCrypto research outlet The Tie found that BCH trading volumes on Binance reached levels not seen in two years as trading interest returned toward BCH after EDX Markets listing.\n\nEDX is still new, and its trading volume is relatively small compared to major exchanges like Binance, however this new enthusiasm for $BCH is evident in trading volume on Binance as well. $BCH trading volume on Binance has reached levels unseen in the past two years. pic.twitter.com/TS4kkdpsQG \u2014 The Tie (@TheTieIO) June 29, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile the increase in trading volume after a positive catalyst is a sign of strong market participation and interest in the asset, the uptrend is partly driven by a short squeeze and a surprising volume spike on the South Korean exchange, Upbit.\n\nA short squeeze is a phenomenon that occurs when an asset's price rises, as most traders who had bet against its price are forced to buy at a loss or experience forced liquidation.\n\nThe price volatility took out $19 million in liquidations in the last 24 hours, with short orders accounting for 77% of the total amount, representing the highest liquidation levels in June 2023, per Coinglass data.\n\nBCH liquidations over the past 30 days. Source: Coinglass BCH liquidations over the past 30 days. Source: Coinglass\n\nThe token also witnessed a surge in trading on the South Korean exchange Upbit. CoinGecko data shows that the 24-hour trading volume of the BCH/KRW pair on Upbit at $685 million is twice that of BCH trading volumes on Binance.\n\nIn fact, the BCH/KRW trading volume of Upbit was comparable to the BTC/USD pair trading volume of $508 million on Coinbase, the largest U.S.-based exchange."

According to sources who shared information with The Wall Street Journal on Friday, the agency termed the applications as neither sufficiently clear nor comprehensive.\n\nSpecifically, the SEC commented about the applications filed by Nasdaq and Cboe Global Markets on behalf of the asset managers BlackRock and Fidelity, the sources familiar with the matter told the publication.\n\nSEC Is Under Pressure\n\nThe number of asset managers seeking approval to list spot Bitcoin ETFs has increased recently despite the fact that the regulator declined similar applications in the past. According to the SEC, such funds are vulnerable to fraud and market manipulation.\n\nThe recent filings, especially by the Wall Street giants, renewed hopes among investors that the SEC might soften its stance and approve the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the US. Nonetheless, there has been a record amount of funds channelled to existing ETFs, including the ProShares Bitcoin Bitcoin While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.In fact, we\u2019ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC\u2019s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John\u2019s.One could now argue that While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.In fact, we\u2019ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC\u2019s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John\u2019s.One could now argue that Read this Term Strategy ETF (BITO).\n\nKeep Reading South Africa Navigates Crypto Regulations: To License 60 Firms This Month\n\nFinance Magnates reported that for the week that ended on June 25, BITO recorded the largest amount of investments worth $65.3 million. Additionally, on Friday of the same week, the fund traded 500 million shares, something that has only happened five times since it was launched. The data also showed a shift in investors\u2019 behaviour where investments flowed from the Bitcoin cash market to the ETF market.\n\nBlackRock Leads the Pack\n\nThe situation was triggered when BlackRock submitted an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF on June 16. In the application, the leading global asset manager noted that it will use the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate to track the prices of Bitcoin. Several other asset managers followed, submitting similar applications to the regulator.\n\nIn a separate report, Finance Magnates reported that Invesco and WisdomTree sought similar regulatory approval to launch their spot Bitcoin ETFs. Based in Atlanta, Georgia, Invesco is an asset management company with Assets Under Management (AUM) worth $1.4 trillion. Initially, the company attempted to launch a spot bitcoin ETF in 2021 in partnership with Galaxy Digital but was unsuccessful.\n\nIn contrast, WisdomTree, one of the major ETF providers in the US with an AUM of $83 billion, plans to list an ETF dubbed WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust.

        "content": "Fidelity has joined other US companies to resubmit its application for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) called Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust. The asset management giant officially filed its paperwork for the spot Bitcoin ETF with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) yesterday (Thursday).\n\nA US Spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nThe application of Boston-headquartered Fidelity came only two weeks after its rival Blackrock filed for the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. Blackrock\u2019s application also encouraged other firms, including Invesco and WisdomTree, to seek the SEC\u2019s approval for the much-anticipated crypto investment instrument. Unlike Blackrock, all these companies filed for permission for a spot Bitcoin ETF, but their application was rejected.\n\nFidelity, a company with $4.5 trillion in assets under management (AUM), originally applied for its spot Bitcoin ETF in 2021 when the retail sentiment in the crypto market was high. However, the SEC rejected Fidility\u2019s application in 2022, which came a couple of months after Fidelity successfully launched a spot Bitcoin ETF in Canada.\n\nBringing Bitcoin to Mass Investors\n\nAn instrument like spot Bitcoin ETF will be listed on American stock exchanges, and retail investors can easily invest in the cryptocurrency from their brokerage accounts. It would eliminate the hassle of creating a separate crypto exchange account, setting up wallets, and other complex processes.\n\nKeep Reading South Africa Navigates Crypto Regulations: To License 60 Firms This Month\n\nIn the latest reapplication, Fidelity included a \u2018surveillance sharing agreement\u2019 with an unnamed US spot-based Bitcoin trading platform. This would eliminate the SEC\u2019s concerns over market manipulation.\n\nThough the SEC was reluctant to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs, the interest of Blackrock in the segment this time has raised hope. With over $10 trillion in AUM, BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the US. It has a significant influence in the financial services industry and also political backing, many media reports highlighted. Further, the market is optimistic about BlackRock\u2019s position, and speculations are mounting that its spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved. However, the SEC is yet to come up with anything official."

It peaked above $31,100 and bottomed below $29,900, but its variability was limited to less than 2% in any given 24-hour period. After surpassing 50% market dominance last week, the top cryptocurrency settled back to 47.9%, but still sustaining over $9 billion in trading volume.\n\nDespite this ultimately flat week, Bitcoin (BTC) is up 15% over the last two weeks and up 13% over the last month, with a one-year return of more than 50%, according to data from CoinGecko. It currently trades for $30,612, which is more or less where it was seven days ago.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe number one contender, Ethereum (ETH), added 1.9% over the seven days to trade at $1,923 on Saturday.\n\nEarlier in the week, several altcoins that had been labeled as securities by the SEC in its various lawsuits on the industry appeared to finally shake off the effects of the bad press. Polygon (MATIC) and Cardano (ADA) remain virtually unchanged from last week, but Solana (SOL) actually rallied and added 10% to change hands at $18.35.\n\nThere were no significant losses among leading coins but there were several notable rallies of more than 10% this week. Two classic proof-of-work coins ballooned after Wall Street-backed EDX Markets listed them last week: Litecoin (LTC) rallied 18% to $105.18, and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blew up a staggering 52.6% to hit $291.31.\n\nThe week in headlines\n\nOn Monday, Swiss National Bank Chairman Thomas Jordan\u2014speaking at the Point Zero Forum in Zurich\u2014said that a central bank digital currency (CBDC) will be tested on the country\u2019s first regulated crypto exchange called the SIX Digital Exchange (SDX). Jordan was adamant that it was more than a mere trial balloon.\n\n\u201cThis is not just an experiment, it will be real money equivalent to bank reserves,\u201d he told attendees. \u201cThe objective is to test real transactions with market participants.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat same day, HSBC Hong Kong customers became eligible to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum futures Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) on the bank\u2019s \u201cEasy Invest\u201d mobile app.\n\nOn Tuesday, the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs committee announced via Twitter that it reached a consensus on changes to the Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive, including new regulations for crypto assets. This move came in response to lawmakers' calls for stringent rules to prevent \u201cunbacked cryptocurrencies\u201d from infiltrating the traditional financial system.\n\nThe Bank of England\u2019s director of fintech said, meanwhile, that the British central bank was open to the possibility that a British CBDC (or \u201cBritcoin) may not be blockchain-based. The official added that there was conflict at a recent meeting of technologists hosted by the bank to discuss the matter.\n\n\u201cNone of them agreed with each other at any point,\u201d he said, adding that forum contributors \u201cwere not convinced that distributed ledgers offered more efficiency over conventional ledgers.\u201d\n\nOver in Canada, a group of thirty Canadian lawmakers published a report endorsing cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, with 16 recommendations for the country's government to create a national strategy for crypto. The group said the industry has \u201csignificant long-term economic and job creation opportunities.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 was granted Royal Assent by King Charles, officially enshrining new law, according to a press release by the UK government.\n\nUnder the reform bill, crypto trading is recognized as a regulated financial activity. The amended act defines crypto assets as \"cryptographically secured digital representation of value or contractual rights,\" considering them as regulated financial instruments, products, or investments.\n\nFinally, the industry is still reeling from the news a fortnight ago that the world\u2019s largest asset management company, BlackRock, has applied to the SEC for a spot Bitcoin ETF. BlackRock has applied to the SEC with ETF proposals 576 times and has only been rejected once so far.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis week, Fidelity and ARK Invest became the latest companies to redouble their efforts with their own ETF applications since the BlackRock news, joining companies like Invesco, Wisdom Tree, Valkyrie, and Bitwise. However, on Friday, reports appeared to indicate that insiders at the chief U.S. securities regulator believe BlackRock\u2019s and Fidelity\u2019s applications (and by extension, everyone else\u2019s) are inadequate."

Taking advantage of this positive trend, Bitcoin SV (BSV) has also joined the rally and surged by nearly 15%.\n\nIn 2018, Bitcoin SV (BSV) split from Bitcoin Cash (BCH), creating its own path. Now, BSV has become a significant player alongside Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Surprisingly, within just eight days, BSV\u2019s value doubled from a low of $27 on June 23rd and managed to recover over 55%, reaching $43.\n\nAs of now, the price of Bitcoin SV (BSV) is $42.2, and it has gained 14% in value overnight. However, the market capitalization of BSV has increased and is now in the range of $814 million, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nBitcoin SV\u2019s Resistance Test: Opportunity or Caution?\n\nThe price of Bitcoin SV (BSV) is currently trading well above the falling parallel channel, which is a positive sign. However, in mid-May, buyers got caught when the price broke out of this downward channel, leading to a significant sell-off.\n\nNow, BSV is approaching its highest point in June, which was $45. In order for the price to reach $50, the buyers need to push it past the key resistance range (represented by the red zone).\n\nThe trading volume for Bitcoin SV (BSV) has increased by 100% in the last 24 hours, reaching $136 million. However, it is still relatively low compared to the trading session on June 24th.\n\nAfter a period of 45 days, the bulls have managed to keep Bitcoin SV (BSV) above the 200-day simple moving average, creating a positive atmosphere. Now, the important moving averages such as EMS 20, 50, 100, and 200 have all turned into support levels. Additionally, the RSI indicator is approaching an extremely overbought region."

        "content": "June 30, 2023 01:21 pm | Updated 01:58 pm IST - Bengaluru\n\nBengaluru\n\nA 39-year-old businessman lost over \u20b952 lakh after participating in a cryptocurrency exchange task. He pledged gold, withdrew a fixed deposit, used business overdraft and borrowed money from friends to pay the fraudsters. An FIR was registered at South East CEN Crime Police Station.\n\nNalagani Gururaju runs two hair salons at Electronics City in Bengaluru. On May 29, an unknown person [phone number +1(6292742279)]contacted him on WhatsApp and asked him to take up a part-time job subscribing to YouTube channels. Gururaju was promised \u20b950 each for subscribing to multiple YouTube channels. Gururaju subscribed to three channels after clicking on the links sent by the unknown person. He received \u20b9150 in his bank account.\n\nLater, he was added to a Telegram group which included four members who were talking about crypto tasks. An admin of the group sent details of various packages to invest money in buying and selling Bitcoins (BTC).\n\nMembers were sending several messages and photos. The text on one photo shared on the group stated: Real Time Task Availability \u2014 Pay \u20b930,000 and withdraw \u20b943,500, or pay \u20b99,69,000 and withdraw \u20b913,08,150, or pay \u20b96,28,000 and withdraw \u20b99,10,600.\n\nGururaju was told to open an account on a website to transact in Bitcoins. The website was similar to that of a popular crypto exchange site bitFlyer.\n\n\u201cIn the Telegram group, other members were sharing screenshots of money received in their account. This made me confident about going ahead with the tasks,\u201d he told The Hindu.\n\nOnce Gururaju expressed an interest to trade, he was told to transfer money to various account numbers. He sent money to 7 different accounts. The fraudsters, who were posing as BTC brokers, claimed to be trading the coins he had bought, and that the same was reflected in the account (crypto wallet), which he had opened on their website.\n\nGururaju had transferred \u20b952 lakh to the accounts. As per his crypto account, he had a total of over \u20b965 lakh after including the profit. But, although Gururaju could see profits growing in the account, he did not have the option to withdraw the money.\n\nWhen he asked the admin of the Telegram group to allow him to withdraw the money, the admin claimed that he could withdraw his money if he paid tax on the same. Other members in the Telegram group posted messages saying that this is the rule of the company.\n\nGururaju entered into a personal chat with the admin and requested return of his money. The admin allegedly admitted that the whole scheme was a fraud and told him to pay \u20b93 lakh more to join the group, and become a partner. The admin claimed that they work from Mumbai.\n\nGururaju is now bankrupt. He does not have money even to pay the salaries of his salon staff.\n\nHe approached the bank with his complaint. The bank was unable to recover the money transferred by Gururaju to the accounts of the fraudsters, which had been opened in private banks in Delhi, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha."

        "content": "In the immediate term, Bitcoin dominance may consolidate around 52-53% where it can encounter resistance. The eventual target for dominance this year is around 56-60% before the market finds a low and becomes healthy. By this time, most altcoins will further lose 20-40% in value against BTC from current levels \u2013 this calls for prudence among investors to stick to Bitcoin and Ethereum for most of their crypto portfolio. Once Bitcoin dominance hits its cycle high, altcoins become favourable from a risk-reward perspective."

        "content": "As the majority of the cryptocurrency sector starts to move in a more bullish trend, its largest digital asset by market capitalization, Bitcoin (BTC), is no exception, with machine learning algorithms and important technological trends predicting more advances in the next couple of years.\n\nIndeed, the self-learning machine algorithm deployed by the crypto tracking platform CoinCodex set the price of Bitcoin at $38,183 on December 31, 2023, suggesting that its value would increase by close to 23% from its current figures, according to the information accessed on June 30.\n\nBitcoin 6-month price prediction. Source: CoinCodex\n\nFurthermore, if the price of Bitcoin moves in the same growth pattern as that of the internet, mobile technologies, and large tech companies like Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ: META), its average price by the end of 2024 could reach $62,193, an over 100% gain from its price at present.\n\nSpecifically, if followed the internet\u2019s path exclusively, it could reach the price of $38,887 by the end of 2024, following the growth of mobile tech could lead it to $38,233, mimicking Google\u2019s expansion could end up at $56,838, whereas taking Facebook\u2019s path could see it reach a whopping $114,812.\n\nAt the same time, the above logic indicates that the maiden cryptocurrency could reach an average price of $110,636 by the end of 2025 (up +256%), as its price based on the internet\u2019s growth could reach $50,202, $48,942 where mobile tech is concerned, $88,713 if Google is any indicator, or $254,687 if it took the same road as Facebook.\n\nBitcoin price prediction for 2024 and 2025. Source: CoinCodex\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, the current price of the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset is $31,067, which demonstrates an increase of 1.09% on the day, 3.15% across the week, and 14.62% on its monthly chart, as per the latest data retrieved on June 30.\n\nBitcoin 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nWhether Bitcoin indeed manages to follow the path of one of the above technologies and reach the prices predicted will depend on the positive indicators on its charts, such as the lack of resistance that could push it toward $35,000, as well as the general atmosphere on the wider crypto market.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "In order to better prepare for Bitcoin\u2019s next halving (the halving of miners\u2019 rewards per validated block of BTC), which is expected to take place around the beginning of 2024, this new article looks at recent movements in the crypto market to try and understand which sectors and tokens are delivering the best performance in this early part of the year.\n\nFigure 1 shows 25 of the top tokens in the crypto landscape. These are the most capitalised (excluding stablecoins) and belong to different sectors such as DeFi (AAVE), Gaming (AXS), Exchanges (BNB), Layer 2 (MATIC) and of course the two main cryptocurrencies BTC and ETH.\n\nFigure 1. Most capitalised crypto yields in early 2023\n\nThe last date taken into account for these calculations is 23/05/2023, while the first date is obviously 01/01/2023. In these first months, most of the stocks under consideration have shown a positive performance.\n\nIn fact, only APE and LUNC show negative returns of -8.73% and -40.54% respectively. We all know by now the sad epilogue of the LUNA project, which saw everything it had built destroyed in a matter of days, leaving many investors on the brink and triggering a chain reaction throughout the sector. APE, on the other hand, a project at the heart of the NFT sector, probably paid for the sharp rise seen in 2022 following its listing on Binance.\n\nCurrently, the best performing cryptocurrency in 2023 is Solana (SOL) with a performance of 98.6%, followed by Fantom (FTM) with a return of 83.6%. Also performing well are Curve (CRV) and Decentraland (MANA) with performances of 65.4% and 60.19% respectively.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) also performed very well, rising from $16607 to $27334 in 2023, a positive result of 64.6%. Ethereum (ETH) is a little further down the list, up a good 54.29%.\n\nScrolling down the list, a number of altcoins from different sectors stand out, such as Cardano (ADA) with 48.37%, SandBox (SAND) with 32.56% and so on.\n\nAmong the worst performers are Dogecoin (DOGE), which is hovering around parity (3.9% to be precise), Axie Infinity (AXS) with a slight increase (considering the volatility of the crypto sector) of 9.31% in 2023, and of course the aforementioned APE and LUNC.\n\nThese results might suggest that a new rally in cryptos is on the horizon, but in reality the road back to the highs of recent months is still a distant mirage for most of them. Indeed, in Figure 1, in the column labelled ATH (all-time high), it can be seen that the distance between the current price and the all-time high is still very large.\n\nSuffice it to say that despite bitcoin\u2019s recent rise of 64.6%, the distance from the all-time high is still very pronounced (-60.37%). For altcoins, the figure is even worse, with tokens well over 90% away from all-time highs.\n\nAll of this means that, as can be seen in Figure 2, to recover these drawdowns and return to historical highs, there needs to be a much bigger rally than we have seen so far. In fact, to recover a 50% drawdown would require a 100% positive performance. Similarly, to recover a 60% drawdown, a 150% performance is required, and so on down to 90%, where a 900% rally is required to return to historical highs.\n\nFigure 2. Summary table of the yield required to recover a drawdown\n\nThis period in history could certainly be a good time for those who believe in these projects to accumulate some cryptocurrencies, given the strong drawdowns and the imminent halving of bitcoin, but beware, it is by no means a given that cryptocurrencies that have experienced drawdowns of over 90% can definitively recover the lost ground.\n\nCryptocurrencies are a highly volatile market, as evidenced by the figures we have seen so far, and this implies that one should treat them with extreme caution, without committing too much of one\u2019s capital, or at least the percentage of one\u2019s account that one is willing to lose up to 90-95% of one\u2019s investment.\n\nAll in all, 2023 continues to recover from the strong drawdowns of 2022, but there is still a long way to go. So watch out for movements between now and early 2024, when we will see the halving of bitcoin, which historically has been the start of all rallies seen in bitcoin (and other cryptos as well) since its inception.\n\nUntil next time!\n\nAndrea Unger"
