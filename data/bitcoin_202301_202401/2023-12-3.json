        "title": "What\u2019s behind the Bitcoin price surge? Has surpassed $41,000 - The Associated Press",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Bitcoin is once again having a moment. On Monday, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency soared past $41,000 for the first time in over a year and a half \u2014 and marking a 150% rise so far this year.\n\nVolatile bitcoin rocketed from just over $5,000 at the start of the pandemic to nearly $68,000 in November 2021, according to FactSet, a period marked by a surge in demand for technology products. Prices fell back to earth during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes aimed at taming inflation and then the collapse of FTX, one of the biggest companies in crypto.\n\nWhen 2023 began, a single bitcoin could be had for less than $17,000 after losing more than 75% of its value. Investors, however, began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool. And the collapse of prominent tech-focused banks actually led more investors to turn to crypto as they bailed out of positions in Silicon Valley start-ups and other risky bets.\n\nBut fueling this latest rally are prospects for the possible approval of spot bitcoin exchange traded funds \u2014 a pooled investment security that can be bought and sold like stocks.\n\nIndustry advocates say this new way of investing in bitcoin at spot prices, instead of futures, could make it easier for anyone to enter the cryptoverse while lowering some of the well-documented risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies. Regulators have previously rejected bitcoin spot ETF applications, but recent wins for some crypto fund managers have improved odds for a first approval, perhaps as soon as next month.\n\n\u201cThe longer-term catalyst (for bitcoin) is a lot of optimism related to the potential approval of a spot ETF,\u201d Kaiko research analyst Riyad Carey said Monday. He noted, however, that a regulatory green light doesn\u2019t promise continued gains.\n\nWhile analysts expect the potential approval of spot bitcoin ETFs to create a much larger pool of crypto investors, future volumes could go either way, Carey added. That could either boost or undermine bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s current rally also arrives during an incredibly disruptive period for cryptocurrencies. Just last month, the U.S. government slapped Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, with a $4 billion fine as its founder Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to a felony charge.\n\nBut Binance continues to operate and maintain its market share, Carey noted. In some ways, the company\u2019s settlement \u201cpropelled the market forward more by removing one of the ... more ominous overhangs that was a sort of a big question mark,\u201d he said, noting bitcoin\u2019s gains in the two weeks since the settlement was announced.\n\nDespite the recent excitement around bitcoin, experts still maintain that crypto is a risky bet with wildly unpredictable fluctuations in value. In short, investors can lose money as quickly as they make it.\n\nLast year\u2019s collapse of crypto exchange giant FTX also \u201cleft a big scar\u201d on the public\u2019s confidence in the crypto industry and crushed retail investors, Edward Moya, a former senior market analyst at Oanda, previously told The Associated Press \u2014 noting that institutional money, like hedge funds, are behind the bulk of current crypto investing.\n\nCarey added that liquidity in cryptocurrency markets has yet to return to where it was before FTX collapsed, and lower liquidity can exacerbate price fluctuations.\n\n\u201cIn the past few months, that has normally been the price moving up \u2014 but people should always be aware it can go in the reverse and quickly,\u201d he said.\n\nAs of around 1:30 p.m. Eastern time Monday, the price of bitcoin stood at $41,709.\n\nThe stocks of some other crypto players have also seen rises over recent months, but not with the same speed or heights as bitcoin. Ethereum, for example, stood at $2,223 Monday afternoon, up 85% since the start of 2023. Meanwhile, Binance Coin and Dash are down about 5.25% and 24.37% for the year, respectively, with Monday afternoon prices of roughly $231 and $32."

        "content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nThe price of bitcoin soared above $40,000 on Monday, hitting its highest level in 18 months as investors look ahead to a lower interest rate environment and key regulatory approvals that could make the crypto asset more mainstream.\n\nBitcoin, the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency, was up more than 5% over the past 24 hours, trading at $41,600, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nOn Friday, Investors began piling on after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank\u2019s policy was \u201cwell into restrictive territory,\u201d words that some interpreted to mean that interest rate hikes were over, even though Powell underscored the Fed was prepared to raise rates again if needed.\n\n\u201cBitcoin breaking $40,000 isn\u2019t as juicy as the first time it happened in January 2021,\u201d said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of the crypto lender Nexo. \u201cYet consider where we were a year ago, at $15,500, and this is a significant upturn in fortunes for an asset that looked dead and buried.\u201d\n\nThe rally also reflects investors\u2019 eagerness to move on from crypto\u2019s most recent scandals. Last month, Changpeng Zhao, the billionaire founder of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, pleaded guilty to federal money-laundering charges and resigned from his role as CEO. That came just weeks after a jury convicted FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried of orchestrating a multibillion-dollar fraud.\n\nBitcoin is now up 150% for the year, though it remains far from its historical high of $69,000 in November of 2021.\n\nPart of the enthusiasm hinges on expectations that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a bitcoin-focused exchange-traded fund, or spot ETF. The SEC faces a January 10 deadline to approve applications for such funds.\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF would allow traditional investors to have exposure to the digital asset without actually owning it. The market has long desired a way to ride the digital asset\u2019s wild rallies, but its volatility has also made owning bitcoin unappealing outside of the digital asset community."

        "title": "What To Expect From Bitcoin and Crypto Markets In 2024 - Investopedia",
        "content": "KEY TAKEAWAYS The approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF has been the key area of focus for crypto investors, as it could broaden access to Bitcoin.\n\nOptimism surrounding the possible approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF helped contribute to a rally in the price of Bitcoin.\n\n\n\n2023 was a pivotal year in terms of crypto enforcement actions, with further regulatory clarity expected to arrive in 2024.\n\nAn end of policies focused on monetary tightening from central banks around the world could also lead to a positive outcomes for risk assets like cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin's recent rally may have taken it past the $42,000 market and helped put the crypto winter of 2022 far in the distance. However, it was also a year the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization started on shaky grounds at a mere $16,500 level.\n\nHere's what you need to know with the crypto markets looking ahead to the next year, standing at the cusp of important events such as the fate of the approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), Bitcoin halving, and developments in crypto regulation.\n\n\n\nThe Spot Bitcoin ETF Could Be a Game Changer\n\nEver since Blackrock (BLK) originally filed its spot Bitcoin ETF application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in June, the impending approval of such a financial product has been the key area of focus for the crypto market.\n\nSo far, retail investors can only gain cryptocurrency exposure through ETFs that trade in cryptocurrency futures. A spot Bitcoin ETF would allow investors, especially retail investors, to gain access to Bitcoin without needing to hold their investment in a Bitcoin wallet.\n\n\n\nAnalysts expect big money to flow into Bitcoin spot ETFs if the SEC gives its approval, and that optimism has helped boost the price of Bitcoin, with the spot Bitcoin ETF market anticipated to grow to $100 billion over time, according to a report by Bloomberg. A report from Galaxy estimates inflows in spot Bitcoin ETF products could rise from $14 billion in the first year to $39 billion within three years.\n\nThat said, there remains uncertainty around the SEC's decision. The SEC has reportedly held multiple rounds of talks with prospective ETF issuers, with issuers amending applications to meet regulators' expectations.\n\n\"I'm optimistic, but I think it's quite likely we have another round of rejections before we get the positive news,\" BitGo CEO Mike Belshe recently told Bloomberg.\n\nBlackrock and others have also filed for spot ether ETFs. However, the likelihood of approval for those products based around the alternative crypto asset is similarly unclear.\n\n\n\nWhy The Upcoming Bitcoin Halving Will Be Crucial\n\nBitcoin halving\u2014or an event that roughly cuts in half rewards to Bitcoin miners for successfully mining the cryptocurrency\u2014is expected to take place in 2024.\n\nWhy is it important? At 21 million, the supply of Bitcoin is finite making it harder to mine as more Bitcoins come into circulation. Bitcoin miners are rewarded for successfully mining a block. And the reward gets diminished with a halving, indirectly also impacting the number of Bitcoins in circulation. And price is inversely proportionate to supply.\n\nThe crypto market's boom and bust cycles have generally revolved around the Bitcoin halving event, which happens roughly every four years and involves a halving of the amount of new Bitcoin that is issued to miners on the network around every ten minutes.\n\nAccording to a report from crypto asset manager Grayscale, there is reason to believe this halving event (and any positive tailwinds from a spot Bitcoin ETF approval) could be more impactful than it was in the past. This is due to the current distribution of the Bitcoin supply, which is largely held by entities that tend to hold for long periods of time.\n\n\"If these trends continue, the Grayscale Research team anticipates that the dynamics of Bitcoin\u2019s ownership could increasingly amplify the impact of macro events, like evolving global policies and regulation (e.g., approval of US spot Bitcoin ETF), as well as crypto market developments, like the 2024 Bitcoin halving,\" said Grayscale Analyst Will Ogden Moore in the report.\n\nDespite the Bitcoin-denominated cut for miners related to the halving event, Sabre56 CEO Phil Harvey says the mining industry will be fine, even in a scenario where a spot Bitcoin ETF is not approved. \"In the absence of an ETF launch, the mining sector is likely to maintain its current state of health,\" Harvey told Investopedia. \"Present revenue metrics for miners with direct access to power and equipped with state-of-the-art power generation reveal a robust economic landscape. The current economics are expected to endure, ensuring sustained and healthy profit margins post-halving.\"\n\nClarity On Crypto Regulation In The Cards?\n\n2023 has been a massive year for crypto enforcement actions, with many of the biggest names in the industry, from Binance to Coinbase, facing lawsuits from the SEC or even the Department of Justice. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty of fraud and former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao is facing charges of violating the Bank Secrecy Act.\n\nAfter these recent events, it's becoming clear that the Wild West years of the crypto industry may be coming to an end. U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) recently shared her optimism that regulatory clarity may finally arrive in early 2024 due to the move of traditional financial titans into the crypto market.\n\nAdditionally, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chair Rostin Behnam has pointed to Congress's increased concerns regarding crypto's potential use in illicit finance as a reason behind the legislative body's renewed interest in the subject.\n\nIn terms of other areas of regulation and policy that could affect the crypto market in 2024, TradeStation Head of Brokerage Solutions Anthony Rousseau pointed to the Financial Account Standards Board's (FASB) rule change for valuing crypto assets and a potential end to the Federal Reserve and other central banks' policies of monetary tightening.\n\nThe FASB rule change \"opens the door for corporates now to have a path to add Bitcoin to the balance sheet as a reserve asset, as MicroStrategy has adopted,\" Rousseau told Investopedia. \"It\u2019s plausible to believe we have reached the heights of this [central bank] tightening cycle. For risk assets to get a sustained bid we will need to see a path forward with lower rates and an end to Quantitative Tightening.\"\n\n"

        "title": "Crypto execs say the bull run is underway and could lead to $100,000 bitcoin in 2024 - CNBC",
        "content": "In this article BTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nYuichiro Chino | Moment | Getty Images\n\nExecutives in the cryptocurrency industry called the start of a new bull run with a growing number of voices calling for fresh all-time highs for bitcoin in 2024 above $100,000. Bitcoin has rallied more than 120% this year, with many optimistic about the surge continuing into 2024. \"It feels that [2023]was a year to get ready for the bull run that is yet to come. But the sentiment is very hopeful for [2024] and 25,\" Pascal Gauthier, CEO of Ledger, told CNBC last week in an interview.\n\nThe digital currency's last record high of nearly $69,000 was hit in November 2021. Since then, the crypto industry has been hit with a litany of issues from the collapse of coins and projects to bankruptcies and criminal trials. FTX, once one of the world's biggest exchanges, collapsed with its founder Sam Bankman-Fried facing over 100 years in prison after he was found guilty on seven counts of criminal fraud. Meanwhile, Binance chief Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to criminal charges and stepped down as the company's CEO as part of a $4.3 billion settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice. Many in the industry see the two cases concluding as a line being drawn under issues that have plagued the crypto market. \"I think that once you get the speculative phase out of the way, which I think we're almost done with, probably not yet completely done, then you can get real builders focusing on the technology and the problems that can solve in the world, rather than just having a giant digital casino for people to trade,\" David Marcus, CEO of Lightspark, told CNBC last week in an interview. Marcus, the former leader of Facebook's failed Diem stablecoin project, is now working on technology to improve bitcoin as a payments network.\n\nwatch now\n\nNow that those issues are out the way, investors are focused on what the industry sees as positive developments. The first is the growing excitement that a bitcoin exchange-traded fund, or ETF, might be approved soon. This could bring in larger traditional investors who previously did not want to touch crypto. \"I think what the ETF means really is that bitcoin is going mainstream, and that's what people were waiting for,\" Gauthier said. The second development is the bitcoin halving, which takes place every four years and is scheduled for May 2024. Halving is when miners, which are entities who uphold the bitcoin network, see the rewards for their work cut in half. This keeps a cap on the supply of bitcoin \u2014 of which there will ever only be 21 million coins \u2014 and often is a factor behind a new rally. \"A number of market participants are expecting a bull run some time after the halving, but given the ETF news, we could very well have a run before that leaving most investors on the sidelines. That could cause a massive upward run in the price,\" Vijay Ayyar, vice president of international markets at cryptocurrency exchange CoinDCX, told CNBC.\n\nBitcoin at $100,000?\n\nThere have already been some bold calls for bitcoin in 2024. It began with Standard Chartered last week which reiterated an April price call that bitcoin would hit $100,000 by end of 2024. The bank said this will be driven by the approvals of numerous ETFs. That would mean a roughly 160% rally from Friday's price of around $38,413, according to CoinDesk data. Matrixport, which bills itself as a crypto financial services firm, released a note last week projecting bitcoin would reach $63,140 by April 2024 and $125,000 by the end of next year. \"Based on our inflation model, the macro environment is expected to remain a robust tailwind for crypto. Another decline in inflation is anticipated, prompting the Federal Reserve to likely initiate interest rate cuts,\" Matrixport said in its report. \"Combined with geopolitical crosscurrents, this healthy dose of monetary support should push Bitcoin to new highs in 2024.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nMany commentators see easing monetary policy as supportive for bitcoin which is viewed as a risky asset. Meanwhile, some see bitcoin as a sort of \"safe haven\" asset to pour money into in times of geopolitical strife. When asked if bitcoin would hit $100,000 in 2024, Gauthier said \"maybe,\" but declined to give a price prediction. \"What we see is strong fundamentals,\" he said. Ayyar said that the price of bitcoin is \"consolidating\" below a \"key level\" of $38,000, which is bullish for bitcoin. Once this level is broke, bitcoin could rally to between $45,000 and $48,000 next, he said. However, he warned the rally, which is in large part built on expectations of an ETF approval, could fail if the product is rejected by regulators again. \"An all out ETF rejection could play havoc to this run as well, hence definitely something to be mindful of,\" he said.\n\nwatch now"

        "content": "Although the cryptocurrency industry remains shadowed by recent blowups and controversy, the world's most important token \u2014 bitcoin \u2014 is making a comeback.\n\nThe value of bitcoin soared to nearly $42,000 on Monday, marking the first time the digital currency cracked $40,000 in 18 months, price tracker CoinDesk Indices shows.\n\nThe resurgence stands in contrast to the questions that have dogged the sector since last year's spectacular flameout of crypto exchange FTX, leading to the November conviction of founder Sam Bankman-Fried on seven counts of fraud. Also last month, Binance \u2014 the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange platform \u2014 agreed to pay $4.3 billion after admitting that it violated U.S. laws to prevent money laundering and sanctions violations, with CEO Changpeng Zhao pleading guilty to one federal charge.\n\nDespite such scandals, bitcoin's priced has soared 150% this year, although it remains down from a high of roughly $69,000 in late 2021.\n\nWhat is bitcoin again?\n\nBitcoin is the first cryptocurrency and was created in 2009. Cryptocurrencies are digital tokens that use peer-to-peer technology to facilitate instant payments without the need of a third party such as a bank or payment processor, according to bitcoin's pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nUnlike traditional money, cryptocurrencies can be used to purchase goods and services on the internet, in addition to being held as investments (like stocks). However, crypto prices are notoriously volatile, and investing in any kind of crypto can be risky, according to investment firm Charles Schwab.\n\nThere are more than 11,000 cryptocurrencies, but bitcoin is the most valuable (in dollar terms), in addition to having the largest market capitalization of any digital asset, data from crypto price tracker CoinGecko shows.\n\nWhy is bitcoin surging now?\n\nSeveral factors are fueling bitcoin's latest rally. Perhaps the most important are signs that major investment firms are set to get regulatory approval to offer spot bitcoin exchange traded funds \u2014 a pooled investment security that can be bought and sold like stocks. Federal regulators are expected to give the green light for several bitcoin ETFs as early as January, which could make investing in crypto more accessible to investors, Yiannis Giokas, a senior product director at Moody's, told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\n\"As more and more managers venture into the bitcoin spot ETF space, more retail and institutional investors, even the more conservative ones, will feel a higher degree of comfort investing in this space,\" he said.\n\nBitcoin prices are also benefiting from a growing conviction on Wall Street that the Federal Reserve is done hiking its benchmark interest rate now that inflation is receding and that the central bank could even start loosening monetary policy by mid-2024 to keep the economy on track.\n\nWhen interest rates fall, investors are more likely to pour money into riskier assets such as crypto.\n\n\"Lower rates are bullish for bitcoin,\" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at crypto data firm Amberdata, told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nGiokas thinks 2024 could be a banner year for bitcoin, a proxy for how well the crypto market as a whole is doing.\n\nBitcoin \"hit $40,000 for the first time in 2021, and every time it was followed by a bull run, so it's a logical expectation from the markets that another run is on its way,\" he said.\n\n\u2014 The Associated Press contributed reporting."

        "content": "Bitcoin, the first and largest cryptocurrency by market cap, rose to over $40,000 on Sunday, reaching a price not seen since April 2022.\n\nThe popular cryptocurrency, which was trading above $41,500 at time of publication, is often seen as an indicator of broader market sentiment in the digital asset space, with other tokens also rising in value, including Ether, which broke $2,200.\n\nAnalysts point to several factors behind the rally, including signs that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is poised to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs, including for the leading crypto asset manager Grayscale, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group.\n\nGrayscale won a landmark case against the SEC in August over its application to issue a spot Bitcoin ETF, which allows investors access to a fund that provides them with direct exposure to the current price of Bitcoin. Since the decision, which the SEC declined to appeal, Grayscale has met with representatives from the agency, including last week.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s next approval window is in early January. Other ETF applicants include TradFi giants such as Blackrock and Fidelity.\n\nAfter reaching an all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November 2021, Bitcoin plummeted in 2022 after the collapse of several well-known crypto projects, including the Do Kwon\u2013led Terra and the Sam Bankman-Fried\u2013led FTX. Bitcoin started 2023 under $17,000, with fears that more prominent crypto companies could fail, including the world's leading exchange, Binance.\n\nAfter a long-anticipated case by the Department of Justice, prosecutors finally reached a settlement with Binance founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao in November, with Zhao agreeing to step down and the company paying $4.3 billion in fines. Still, the firm will be allowed to keep operating, albeit with a U.S.-government-led monitorship, which is a better-than-expected outcome for many traders.\n\nA rising tide\n\nWhile crypto acolytes often portray Bitcoin as an alternative to the traditional financial system, its price still tracks the performance of overall markets. Analysts point to expectations that the Federal Reserve could begin cutting interest rates in 2024, leading to investors making riskier bets, as another factor driving Bitcoin's rally.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies are not the only assets buoyed by Bitcoin's rise. Coinbase, the leading U.S. crypto exchange, has seen its stock price rise by over 50% in the last month. MicroStrategy, a publicly traded software company led by Michael Saylor that owns over $5 billion in Bitcoin, announced on Thursday that it had acquired an additional $593.3 million in Bitcoin at an average price of nearly $37,000.\n\nLeading crypto industry figures are predicting the rally will continue, with Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz telling Bloomberg TV last week that the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. could drive billions of dollars into the sector."

        "content": "Many financial advisors remain wary of advising on crypto, but that might have to end.\n\nThe majority of American investors now own Bitcoin, more than a decade after the cryptocurrency first hit the market, according to a new report \u2014 albeit based on a small survey \u2014 by Unchained. Unchained is a financial services provider for Bitcoin.\n\nDue to bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature, owners of cryptocurrency are hard to track. However, according to Grayscale, a digital asset manager and one of the world\u2019s largest holders of Bitcoin, a significant majority of holders are small investors. According to the company, 74 percent of Bitcoin owners hold less than 0.01 worth of the currency. Additionally, the largest holders of Bitcoin are exchanges \u2014 like Binance and Robinhood \u2014 which represent millions of individual investors. According to 21Shares, one of the world\u2019s largest issuers of crypto ETPs, the number of retail investors holding bitcoin has increased 11 percent from one year ago and about 34 percent compared to two years ago.\n\nUnchained surveyed 402 U.S. residents between the ages of 18 and 78 who had a least one investment account. Thirty-nine percent of respondents were Millennials, 32 percent were Gen X, and 21 percent were Boomers. Seventy-one percent of respondents had at least $100,000 in investable assets.\n\nAccording to the survey, 95 percent of investors who owned Bitcoin said they would buy or strongly consider buying more of the cryptocurrency in 2024. Additionally, nearly half of those who did not currently own Bitcoin at the time of the survey in October said that they would strongly consider buying it next year.\n\nThe majority of investors (79 percent) believe that Bitcoin will eventually reach a new all-time high above $69,000 (it\u2019s now about $37,000), with about 55 percent of investors believing that will happen next year.\n\nAmong survey respondents, Bitcoin was selected by 34 percent of investors as the asset they believed would perform the best in 2024. This was followed by gold with 27 percent, the S&P 500 with 21 percent, and cash with 18 percent.\n\nDespite Bitcoin\u2019s growing prominence, an advising gap exists.\n\nAccording to Cerulli Associates, a wealth management research and consulting firm, just 1 percent of advisors report that they use cryptocurrency for some of their clients based on their own recommendations. An additional 26 percent of advisors do not currently use or discuss cryptocurrencies with their clients but expect to do so in the future.\n\nThat means the majority of advisors do not use or discuss crypto with their clients and do not plan to do so in the future.\n\nPart of the issue is the regulatory uncertainty surrounding crypto.\n\nOver the last year, the SEC has cracked down on the crypto industry in a bid to tighten regulation and safeguard investors, in part due to the increase in crypto-related fraud and the collapse of prominent crypto exchanges. However, many in the industry believe that a bitcoin spot ETF is inevitable.\n\nThis month, Anchorage Digital, the first and only federally chartered crypto bank, launched its first custody and separately managed account offerings specifically for RIAs, helping provide another compliant way to custody digital assets.\n\nIncreased regulatory clarity, SEC approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF, and a potential U.S. recession were the top reasons that were most likely to affect an investor\u2019s decision to buy Bitcoin. Forty-two percent of owners and 35 percent of non-owners said increased U.S. regulatory clarity would make them consider buying Bitcoin.\n\nAdditional rejections by the SEC of a Bitcoin spot ETF was the number one factor that would prompt an investor to decrease their Bitcoin holdings. In comparison, only 12 percent of all investors said they would decrease their position if their financial advisor or another trusted source told them to do so.\n\nTwenty-six percent of people that don\u2019t own Bitcoin said they would likely buy Bitcoin if their financial advisor or another trusted source recommended it."

This is the first time since April 2022 that bitcoin has breached the $40,000 level, according to LSEG. Bitcoin is now up more than 150% from the start of the year.\n\nThis comes after scandals rocked the market including the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November last year. Last month, FTX founder Bankman-Fried was found guilty of all seven criminal charges brought against him related to the collapse of his crypto empire.\n\n\"Now that $40,000 has been revisited for the first time in almost 19 months, $48,000 and $52,000 look to be the next significant lines in the sand,\" said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of digital asset company Nexo.\n\nCNBC reported last week that U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission officials met with representatives from Grayscale, BlackRock and the Nasdaq. In a memo, the SEC said it met with Grayscale on Thursday about the potential conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. The SEC had previously blocked this move, but Grayscale challenged that decision in court and won."

        "content": "Let the good times roll. After being stuck near the $38,000 mark for weeks, Bitcoin soared more than 5% on Sunday as it crossed $40,000 for the first time since April 2022. While this is still a ways from the currency\u2019s all-time high, the return of $40,000 Bitcoin is a significant psychological milestone and has triggered a wave of digital backslapping on the echo chamber known as Crypto Twitter, where too many of us spend far too much time.\n\nThe glee over $40,000 was tempered by warnings, however. Some longtime crypto watchers warned the recent price action will bring about the full-blown return of the hucksters and scammers who made the industry so notorious in the past. Crypto journalist and Fortune alum David Z. Morris put it this way: \u201cHope you guys enjoyed chilling, once we cross $40k the normies will be back and things will get stupid and mostly bad again. If history teaches us anything, the enforcement actions of the past two years will mean exactly nothing because a whole new crop of morons will arrive.\u201d\n\nMorris wasn\u2019t the only one making this observation. And it\u2019s a fair concern since previous booms have gone like this: Bitcoin goes on a run, leading to buzz on social media, which pulls in a new crop of green investors, 95% of whom eschew any basic research as they try to get a piece of the new thing. It\u2019s not long before a good number of them stray beyond the confines of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the handful of other reputable cryptocurrencies and\u2014egged on by financial predators\u2014purchase an \u201cup-and-coming\u201d token instead. Months later they find themselves holding a near worthless pool of BARF tokens and cursing the gym trainer or YouTube guy (hey there, Lark!) who persuaded them to set their modest savings on fire in the first place.\n\nI have no doubt these forces are already revving up and, if Bitcoin approaches its all-time high of nearly $69,000, the con artists will return en masse. But I\u2019m not quite as cynical as Morris. Despite the here-we-go-again sensation, there are three reasons to think this latest crypto bull market will be less driven by scams than the previous ones.\n\nThe first is regulators. Unlike the booms of 2017 and 2021, when the SEC and others sleepwalked through mind-boggling frauds, the agencies are hovering like a bad-tempered hawk looking to shred anything that even smells like crypto. Second is the industry itself. Those left standing, including Coinbase and some of the better venture capitalists, are sick of being pilloried for the sins of the crooks in their midst\u2014and just might be more forceful in denouncing the bad actors. Finally, after the myriad scams of the last go-round, many investors will have learned their lesson and only come back to crypto cautiously\u2014if they come back at all.\n\n\u201cThis time it\u2019s different\u201d is usually terrible investment advice (which this is not!), but there\u2019s no denying the crypto industry is older and wiser, which has to count for something. Time will tell if crypto\u2019s worst moments are in the past\u2014or if a new crop of Sam Bankman-Frieds and Do Kwons wait in the wings.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nA federal judge rebuked the SEC in regard to a crypto investigation, asking the agency to explain why it shouldn't be sanctioned for apparently lying in a recent application for a temporary restraining order.

However, our opinions are our own. See how we rate investing products to write unbiased product reviews.\n\nBitcoin investing involves picking an exchange, verifying identity, and withdrawing to a wallet.\n\nInvesting in bitcoin is risky since it's a volatile and speculative asset.\n\nExperts recommend a buy-and-hold strategy when buying bitcoin to average out rises and falls.\n\neToro is one of the best exchanges for buying cryptocurrency.\n\nMore than a decade into its existence, Bitcoin doesn't seem to be going away. The cryptocurrency has attracted good and bad headlines as it's worked its way through multiple peaks over the years, and despite a reputation for volatility, it continues to attract new investors with its promise of market-beating returns.\n\nHere's what to know about investing in Bitcoin.\n\nHow to buy bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency. This means it's a form of electronic money that secures and validates transactions via the use of cryptography. In Bitcoin's case, people and organizations known as \"miners\" use computing hardware to calculate a code \u2014 known as a \"hash\" \u2014 that encrypts the data contained in transactions. This data is collected into \"blocks,\" which are linked together in a blockchain that cannot, in theory, be changed once written.\n\nOn an economic level, Bitcoin's creator \u2014 the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto \u2014 created it in 2008 as a form of \"sound money,\" akin to digital gold.\n\n\"What makes Bitcoin so special is that it has a finite supply of 21 million coins, with only a couple million left to be mined,\" explains Edward Moya, chief market strategist at OANDA's MarketPulse. \"Simple supply and demand for Bitcoin is the main reason why prices have skyrocketed over the past year.\"\n\nDespite having a fixed maximum supply, Bitcoin has shown remarkable volatility throughout most of its life with major fluctuations in its price.\n\nSuch swings make Bitcoin a highly speculative asset, one that should be considered only by traders willing to stomach a fair amount of risk. That said, at least some analysts suspect that its volatility will gradually decline over time, as its market grows and reduces its destabilizing reliance on leverage.\n\n1. Choose a crypto exchange\n\nFor most people, the best place to buy Bitcoin is on a crypto exchange. These are online platforms dedicated to facilitating trades in cryptocurrency, usually by offering trading pairs (e.g., USD to Bitcoin) and usually by matching buyers with sellers.\n\nMore inexperienced traders may wish to try a more general trading platform such as Robinhood. These have the benefit of being more user-friendly than the average crypto exchange, although their major downside is that many don't let users withdraw their bitcoin.\n\nQuick tip: New investors should check the fees charged by exchanges, since these can vary quite widely. They should also check for the minimum account balance required by their chosen platform, since certain exchanges impose a minimum. Others also set minimums for account deposits via bank transfer.\n\n2. Choose a payment method\n\nExchanges also vary in terms of the payment methods they support. Most major platforms do offer the option of linking your bank account for wire and ACH transfers, as well as the option of linking a debit card. Some also let you pay via PayPal.\n\nRegardless of the option you choose, you will have to verify your identity when first signing up for an account and registering a payment method. In the US, you're usually required to submit a scan of a state-issued ID, such as a driver's license or identification card.\n\nDepending on where you are and on your chosen platform, you may also be required to provide scans of additional documentation (such as your passport), as well as being asked to submit a proof of address.\n\n3. Place your order\n\nOnce you're verified and have deposited cash into your account, you can then begin buying Bitcoin. This process varies according to the exchange you use, with some exchanges offering a process that simply involves clicking a Buy or Sell button and then specifying how much Bitcoin you want to buy (or sell).\n\nIn general, most crypto exchanges offer at least three basic order types:\n\nMarket order : the option to choose if you simply want to buy Bitcoin at its current price. This type of order is usually completed in a matter of seconds, depending on the time of day.\n\n: the option to choose if you simply want to buy Bitcoin at its current price. This type of order is usually completed in a matter of seconds, depending on the time of day. Stop order : an order where you specify the price at which you will buy or sell Bitcoin. This type is good if you want to make sure you sell Bitcoin before it falls too sharply. This type of order can take some time to execute, depending on how quickly the market moves.\n\n: an order where you specify the price at which you will buy or sell Bitcoin. This type is good if you want to make sure you sell Bitcoin before it falls too sharply. This type of order can take some time to execute, depending on how quickly the market moves. Limit order: instructs the exchange to execute a buy or sell order at a specific price or better. In contrast to stop orders, limit orders are visible to the market and can take longer to fill.\n\nAgain, executing any one of these options usually involves clicking a Buy, Trade, or New order button on an exchange's home screen. You'll then be able to choose from the above three (and more advanced) options, before clicking a Submit button or something equivalent.\n\nQuick tip: All exchanges will let you buy a fraction of a bitcoin (BTC). So while the price of 1 BTC may seem prohibitively expensive right now, you will be able to choose to buy 0.1 BTC, 0.01 BTC or whatever else you type into the exchange's interface.\n\n4. Store your crypto in a safe place\n\nWhile bigger exchanges are becoming safer, hacks and fraud remain a big problem for the industry. This is why investors with significant sums in Bitcoin are advised to consider storing their cryptocurrency themselves.\n\n\"Experienced traders that are very good with cybersecurity might prefer to own their wallets, as this gives you the ability to move your cryptocurrencies whenever you want to and not be subject to an exchange. The saying 'Not your keys, not your coins' was popular last year, as many exchanges got hacked or shut down,\" says Moya.\n\nThis means transferring your Bitcoin from the exchange you use to your own cryptocurrency wallet. Such wallets come in two forms:\n\nCold wallets: also known as hardware wallets, these are small devices that store your Bitcoin address' private key, which is necessary to transfer Bitcoin out of the address. They do not connect to the internet and are therefore considered safer than online, software-based alternatives.\n\nalso known as hardware wallets, these are small devices that store your Bitcoin address' private key, which is necessary to transfer Bitcoin out of the address. They do not connect to the internet and are therefore considered safer than online, software-based alternatives. Hot wallets: also known as software wallets, these are apps that can be used through your phone, desktop computer, or web browser. They also store the private key of your Bitcoin address, but because they do connect to the internet, they aren't considered quite as safe as hardware/cold wallets.\n\nSoftware wallets aren't quite as secure as hardware wallets, but the leading varieties do still offer a range of security features, such as two-factor authentication and compatibility with hardware wallets.\n\nSelling bitcoin\n\nWhile many traders turn to Bitcoin in the hope of making big money fast, pretty much every analyst advocates a long-term, buy-and-hold strategy. This is largely because holding for a longer period of time tends to average out gains and losses, providing a greater probability of a significant positive return by the time you sell your Bitcoin.\n\n\"In my opinion, it is better to buy and hold, perhaps allocating a small portion of your portfolio to cryptocurrencies, focusing on the ones typically held by institutional investors, such as Bitcoin at the moment,\" says Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nLikewise, many analysts also recommend adopting a dollar-cost-averaging (DCA) strategy, largely because this is another way of averaging out peaks and troughs.\n\n\"The best strategy for newcomers would be to [trade] Bitcoin on the DCA approach [...] you'll just buy a tiny bit on a monthly or weekly basis, not looking at the price movements at all,\" says Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, the CEO and founder of cryptocurrency consultancy, Eight.\n\nHowever, Moya warns that even with a long-term hold strategy, new traders are generally advised to enter the world of Bitcoin investing with the mindset that they could lose most of their money.\n\n\"A new investor should only apply a very low, single-digit percentage of their trading portfolio to cryptocurrencies. Despite the many bullish calls for Bitcoin or Ethereum, massive plunges have happened in minutes. New investors may want to consider buying and holding a basket of cryptocurrencies, with an approach of scaling into positions,\" he says.\n\nA longer-term approach is also beneficial from a tax perspective, since Bitcoin is classified as property in the US, and therefore liable to capital gains tax when sold.\n\nQuick tip: You'll have to pay capital gains tax if you sell bitcoin after holding it for more than one year. But if you hold for less than a year, your gains are taxed as ordinary income. Investors with an annual income of $40,000 or less pay no capital gains tax on Bitcoin profits, whereas those in the next bracket pay 15%.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nBitcoin is an interesting and exciting technological innovation, representing a form of decentralized electronic money that doesn't require a central authority (such as the Federal Reserve) to operate. It's also exciting from an investment perspective, with its high annual returns (in most years) making it one of the best-performing assets of the past decade, even if its volatility means it has suffered more than a few dramatic falls.\n\nWhile investing in Bitcoin may seem complicated, starting off is as simple as picking a reputable exchange and setting up an account. Once you've verified your identity and deposited some money, you're then good to go, with most exchanges offering a range of order types in addition to the ability to simply buy Bitcoin.\n\nWhen you've acquired a significant sum of Bitcoin, most experts recommend withdrawing it to your own cold (i.e., hardware) wallet. They also recommend a buy-and-hold strategy, so that you can iron out market dips and also avoid having your profits taxed as ordinary income."

It later fell back to $41,662, up 7.4 per cent on the previous day.\n\nGold rallied as much as 3 per cent to $2,135 per troy ounce on Monday, a new record, before slipping to $2,025 per troy ounce, according to LSEG data.\n\nThe moves follow a recent rush into stocks and bonds, fuelled by growing expectations that the US Federal Reserve will soon cut borrowing costs despite chair Jay Powell\u2019s assertion on Friday that it was \u201cpremature\u201d to conclude that the central bank has won its battle with inflation.\n\n\u201cYou look at bitcoin and gold and you see a very similar kind of evolution,\u201d said Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management. \u201cAll the asset classes that tend to do well when the Fed cuts rates aggressively are doing well.\u201d\n\nTraders are now betting the first rate reduction could come as soon as March after a sharp decline in government and corporate borrowing costs as US bond markets enjoyed their biggest monthly rally in nearly four decades in November.\n\nLower yields on ultra-safe US Treasury debt have made other assets relatively more attractive to investors. The S&P 500 index closed at its highest level since March 2022 last week, although it was down 0.6 per cent midway through Monday\u2019s session. Recent US economic data has been resilient even while inflation has fallen, further boosting risky assets such as stocks.\n\nMax Kettner, chief multi-asset strategist at HSBC, said markets were in the grip of an \u201ceveryone-is-happy-Goldilocks rally\u201d across \u201cvirtually all asset classes\u201d.\n\nTraders said the momentum to buy bitcoin, whose value has climbed more than a fifth in the past month, was also driven by growing interest among investors after the closure of two of the most high-profile criminal cases that had hung over the market for the past year.\n\nLast month the US successfully prosecuted Sam Bankman-Fried, former chief executive of FTX, and Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange. Bankman-Fried was convicted of fraud and Binance paid $4.3bn in penalties after pleading guilty to criminal charges related to money laundering and financial sanctions breaches.\n\nBut despite many traders\u2019 fears, US authorities did not shut down Binance. The cryptocurrency exchange continues to face a separate lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly violating securities laws.\n\n\u201cThe message from many institutional investors was that they needed two things before looking at the space again: closure on FTX and clarity around Binance,\u201d said Henri Arslanian, co-founder of Nine Blocks Management, a crypto hedge fund manager based in Dubai.\n\nEthereum, the second most actively traded cryptocurrency, also rose 8.3 per cent to $2,260 on Monday, its highest level since May last year.\n\nInvestors are also hopeful the SEC will approve an exchange traded fund for bitcoin in coming weeks. The regulator has refused for a decade to approve spot bitcoin ETFs, stock market funds that invest directly in the cryptocurrency.\n\nSome of Wall Street\u2019s largest investors, including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, have joined companies such as VanEck and WisdomTree in submitting filings with the SEC.\n\nThe market has long viewed spot bitcoin ETFs as a way to wrest control of digital assets from scandal-ridden crypto groups in favour of mainstream businesses such as BlackRock.\n\n\u201cETF speculation is going to continue to drive behaviour in the crypto market this week as investors buy into the narrative of the transformative impact opening the market to institutional investors will have on the ecosystem,\u201d said Simon Peters, market analyst at eToro.\n\nWhile the SEC has embarked on a year-long crackdown on crypto \u2014 including enforcement actions against groups such as US-listed exchange Coinbase \u2014 pressure is growing on the regulator to approve a bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nCrypto asset manager Grayscale scored a watershed legal victory this year when a federal appeals court ruled the SEC was wrong to reject its application to convert its flagship Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF."

The Block's data shows there is nearly $2.2 billion in bitcoin long open interest held by asset managers.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\n\"\n\nD'Anethan added that the current participation from sophisticated players \"is probably bolstered by the fact that a decision on spot bitcoin ETFs should happen by mid/end January.\"\n\nHe added that this is putting pressure on investors who have not yet tried to front run the flow of capital that could come into the bitcoin market after an easier investment vehicle is offered.\n\nHowever, d'Anethan gave a cautionary note, saying that crypto markets like to play games.\n\n\"When everyone is long, it's not inconceivable to imagine large players pushing prices lower, triggering leverage long liquidations on the down,\" he added.\n\nBitcoin was up 5.8% on Monday, trading for $41,875 at 3:47 p.m. ET."

        "content": "(Reuters) \u2014 Cryptocurrency-related stocks listed in the U.S. surged on Monday, looking to extend their strong November gains, as bitcoin topped $42,000 to hit a fresh high for the year.\n\nShares of companies whose fortunes are tied to the cryptocurrency have rallied in recent weeks, spurred by optimism about potential interest rate cuts in the U.S. as well as traders betting on the imminent approval of U.S. stock market-traded bitcoin funds.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) climbed 4.1% to $41,649, its highest since April 2022. It had hit $42,162 earlier in the session.\n\n\"The impact of an (ETF) approval is going to be big in terms of investment appetite because it's going to be more easily regulated, more attractive and easier to invest,\" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at Swissquote Bank.\n\n\"What we have right now is a risk rally, and bitcoin is also benefiting big time from falling yields. There is also this positive bullish sentiment into next year because it is going to be the year of halving.\"\n\nHalving is a process designed to slow the release of bitcoin, and bitcoin prices have typically rallied following halvings.\n\nCoinbase (COIN) was up 6.5%, paring an earlier jump of almost 9%. The stock rose nearly 62% in November, even as the crypto exchange reported a decline in third-quarter trading volumes.\n\nBitcoin investor MicroStrategy (MSTR), which bought bitcoins worth $593 million last month, gained 6.6%.\n\nMichael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, which has stepped up its bitcoin stake. REUTERS/ Marco Bello (Marco Bello / reuters)\n\nBitcoin miners such as Riot Platforms (RIOT), Marathon Digital (MARA) and CleanSpark (CLSK) jumped 10.3%, 8.3% and 11.8%, respectively, adding to their double-digit gains in November.\n\nThe ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which tracks bitcoin futures, rose 6.9%, while the ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITI) that allows traders to bet on a fall in bitcoin futures fell 7.1%.\n\nInvestor sentiment toward cryptocurrencies and related assets had been lukewarm earlier this year after a string of high-profile collapses in 2022 led to outflows of more than a trillion dollars from the sector.\n\nHowever, the recent rally has sent bitcoin up more than 150% so far in 2023, on course for its best annual performance since 2020.\n\n(Reporting by Sruthi Shankar and Amruta Khandekar in Bengaluru; Editing by Tasim Zahid)"

        "content": "The recent spike in Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC-USD) price above $38,000 has brought a fresh wave of crypto investors into the market. With the long-awaited Bitcoin ETF potentially going live in 2024, renewed optimism avails for a bull run.\n\nHowever, it goes far beyond the ETF. Bitcoin has major catalysts approaching, like the mining reward halving projected for mid-2024. This event occurs every few years, cutting the rewards that miners receive by half and significantly impacting supply and demand dynamics over the long run. Considering mining rewards are the only new bitcoins entering circulation, halvings tend to precede major bull runs.\n\nAlso, macroeconomic factors align to Bitcoin\u2019s favor. Interest rates are still painfully high but will likely decline in 2024 or early 2025. Lower rates combined with the ETF and halving could create a perfect storm for crypto.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLess risky crypto projects for newcomers are important for long-term staying power. Let\u2019s delve into three bigger cryptos that could perform well in the next bull market, especially if a Bitcoin ETF gets approved soon.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD)\n\nBitcoin cryptocurrency with pile of coins, Vector illustrator\n\nSource: Sittipong Phokawattana / Shutterstock.com\n\nBitcoin is the obvious top pick for any crypto portfolio right now. Since it has several major catalysts lining up in 2023 and 2024, it could kickstart the next major bull run. As digital gold, BTC has a built-in scarcity and capped supply that no other crypto can match. Specifically, only 21 million BTC will be in existence.\n\nOf course, Bitcoin has downsides too. The network is rather slow and inefficient for payments compared to newer cryptos. Transactions can take over an hour to process, and fees are high due to congestion issues.\n\nWhen adding crypto exposure or balancing a portfolio with some uncorrelated assets, Bitcoin should be the first token of choice right now. Unless something catastrophic happens to destroy trust in crypto entirely, Bitcoin has likely seen its final bear market bottom around $15,000-$17,000.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the macro backdrop improving in 2024, a crashing of Bitcoin seems unlikely. As noted in June 2022, Bitcoin was not expected to break below $15,000, even in a worst-case scenario. Indeed, it bottomed around that level. Further, $25,000 might possibly be the new floor once the ETF goes live.\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD)\n\nEtereum coin is in pocket. Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. ETH crypto\n\nSource: Thaninee Chuensomchit / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough Ethereum (ETH-USD) differs from Bitcoin, it\u2019s been an exceptional long-term investment nonetheless.\n\nAs the second largest crypto by market cap, Ethereum dominates the smart contracts and Web 3.0 spaces. It allows decentralized apps and services to run on its network via the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). In contrast, Bitcoin\u2019s capabilities are quite limited to maximize security. It only supports peer-to-peer payments out of the box.\n\nAlready, ETH supply has turned deflationary post-Merge. More ETH is now removed from circulation via network burns than issued as staking rewards. Supply is decreasing by 1.75% annually, far below the Bitcoin inflation rate.\n\nOf course, Ethereum lacks Bitcoin\u2019s hard cap on supply, which some investors see as a drawback. So, while unlimited supply may seem concerning theoretically, network activity and burn dynamics act as a \u201csoft cap,\u201d keeping inflation below Bitcoin\u2019s. Also, an unlimited supply future-proofs Ethereum, ensuring that stakers still receive adequate future rewards, long after further supply decreases.\n\nFinally, Ethereum stands to gain from accelerating Web 3.0 and crypto adoption. While Bitcoin operates as a relatively simple payment network, Ethereum is an entire ecosystem for decentralized computing. Notably, Ethereum\u2019s correlation to Bitcoin remains high. ETH initially massively outperformed BTC but has lagged recently as the crypto focus returned to being a hedge against inflation.\n\nHowever, if Bitcoin sees another parabolic bull run in 2024-2025 off the halving, ETF approval, and macro backdrop, Ethereum is likely to benefit, too. Similar to the 2017-2018 bull market, while BTC may rise faster early, ETH can often overtake its gains in the later speculative frenzy stages.\n\nLitecoin (LTC-USD)\n\nImage of one litecoin in front of many stacks of litecoins. Litecoin price predictions\n\nSource: Wit Olszewski / Shutterstock.com\n\nLitecoin (LTC-USD) can be seen as a smaller sibling to Bitcoin with higher risk and higher reward potential. One of the oldest and most established crypto projects, Litecoin is essentially a faster Bitcoin fork with lower fees and a few tweaks. It operates similarly, capped at 84 million LTC instead of 21 million BTC. The vast majority of its code is identical.\n\nThus, Litecoin\u2019s correlation to Bitcoin price action tends to be very high. However, LTC generally amplifies BTC moves in both directions. When Bitcoin rises or crashes, Litecoin usually does so even more dramatically as happened in 2013, 2017, and the recent 2022-2023 crash. With its smaller $5.3 billion market cap, LTC remains more volatile and speculative than the blue chip-like BTC.\n\nSo, if Bitcoin indeed kicks off a new bull market in 2024, Litecoin seems poised to massively outperform it. Plus, it could be a safer, smaller-cap play than 99% of altcoins. Although the use case remains questionable, the correlation and historical precedent remain.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the original cryptocurrency, is gaining momentum versus global large-cap stocks, overtaking the market value of American conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway. Its market cap breached $800 billion on Dec. 4 after nudging past billionaire investor Warren Buffet\u2019s company on Dec. 3.\n\nAs Bitcoin surged past $40,000 over the weekend, its market cap rose to above $780 billion, just beating out Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s $779 billion market cap it closed the market with on Dec. 1 (based on its class A stock, BRK.A).\n\nBRK.A has seen a slight decline recently, slipping around 1.3% over the past five days. Despite the recent drop, Berkshire Hathaway is still up 4.7% over the past 30 days and 14.7% year to date (YTD).\n\nThe volatility of BRK.A is nowhere near that of Bitcoin, which has surged 20% over the past month and almost 150% YTD, according to data from CoinGecko. The cryptocurrency has been steadily hitting multimonth highs recently, surpassing $41,000 on Dec. 4 for the first time since April 2022.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap amounts to $811 billion, or 4% higher than the market value of Berkshire Hathaway.

        "title": "Does Bitcoin guzzle swimming pools of water? Depends what you measure, say critics of new study - DLNews",
        "content": "A new study claimed the Bitcoin network uses a lot of water: roughly one swimming pool worth per transaction.\n\nCritics say the study's per-transaction methodology is flawed, and headlines that relied on it, misleading.\n\nBut one researcher says Bitcoin's overall water use is likely high.\n\nA longtime critic of Bitcoin\u2019s energy use found a new problem with the original cryptocurrency: It uses too much water.\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s growing water footprint,\u201d commentary published this week in online journal Cell Reports Sustainability, prompted a flurry of media responses.\n\nBut the industry cried foul, arguing the author \u2014 data scientist Alex de Vries, of the Netherlands\u2019 central bank \u2014 had flubbed a past prediction about Bitcoin\u2019s energy use and relied on a \u201cdebunked\u201d metric to make hair-raising claims.\n\nThe debate has profound consequences for Bitcoin. Alarm over its energy consumption, and, in turn, its greenhouse gas emissions, has prompted calls from politicians to regulate the cryptocurrency or ban it altogether.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nSwimming pools\n\nAccording to de Vries, the total \u201cwater footprint\u201d of Bitcoin in 2021 was 1,573.7 gigaliters. The Bitcoin network handled 96.7 million transactions that year, giving each transaction a water footprint of 16,279 litres.\n\nThat\u2019s enough to fill a backyard swimming pool, according to headlines in the BBC, Euronews, and New Scientist.\n\nThe methodology was straightforward: Facilities that secure the Bitcoin network in exchange for newly issued tokens, a process called \u201cmining,\u201d used a certain amount of power in 2021. Based on the geographic distribution of those facilities, de Vries estimated the source of their energy, and the amount of water those sources used.\n\nHe was, in other words, attempting to measure Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cindirect\u201d or \u201cscope 2\u2033 water use. \u201cDirect,\u201d or \u201cscope 1,\u2033 water use would involve the water used by the facility itself.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u2018Debunked\u2019\n\nCritics say de Vries\u2019 per-transaction methodology is flawed, and headlines that relied on it, misleading.\n\nBitcoin proponents such as Daniel Batten \u2014 an investor in Bitcoin mining operations powered by captured methane \u2014 point to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, which states that \u201cenergy cost per transaction is not a meaningful metric in the context of [proof-of-work] blockchains.\u201d\n\nProof-of-work is one of several technologies used to secure blockchains. In 2022, Ethereum switched to another mechanism, in part to reduce its energy consumption.\n\nA single Bitcoin transaction \u201ccan include thousands of payments,\u201d the Center for Alternative Finance said in a 2018 study. Additionally, \u201cenergy required for [proof-of-work] networks to function is independent from the number of processed transactions.\u201d\n\n\u201cDe Vries is neither a scientist, nor an energy or resource expert,\u201d Batten told DL News. \u201cHe is the employee of a Central Bank, and has had his methodology of \u2018per transaction\u2019 debunked.\u201d\n\nDe Vries defended his use of the per-transaction metric.\n\n\u201cNew environmental disclosure requirements for crypto assets that are being introduced in Europe with the MiCA regulation will also specifically require efficiency metrics such as the electricity, carbon and water footprints per transaction,\u201d he told DL News.\n\n\u201cOnly a very limited fraction of Bitcoin transactions are payments, so taking transactions as payments tends to make Bitcoin look better,\u201d he added. \u201cScaling solutions such [as] the Lightning network mentioned in the article have not had any meaningful impact in altering this.\u201d\n\nDirect, or indirect?\n\nBatten also took issue with the notion that Bitcoin\u2019s total water use was somehow problematic. Indirect water consumption is \u201cnot a meaningful metric,\u201d he and others have argued.\n\n\u201cYou could write an article saying that banking, AI, search engines, construction, media \u2014 any industry you wanted uses a lot of water using the methodology he uses,\u201d Batten said.\n\n\u201cThe actual direct water-usage of Bitcoin mining, which is what I would opine a piece of honest analysis would have focused on, is very low compared to other industries such as agriculture, pulp and paper, steam assisted oil recovery and extractive mining.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s just the standard across industries, according to Kaveh Madani, director of the United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health.\n\nMadani recently co-authored commentary on Bitcoin\u2019s environmental footprint, which included an estimate of its worldwide water use in 2020 and 2021. That estimate detailed Bitcoin\u2019s indirect water consumption \u2014 the water needed to generate the energy that Bitcoin used.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the correct way to do water impact calculations,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cTo calculate the water footprint of the burger you eat \u2026 we go across the supply chain: So we start from the grass, and then the cow and the truck that brings the meat to the store.\u201d\n\nDe Vries agreed.\n\n\u201cAssessing the water footprint in this way is no different than [how] we assess carbon footprints,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have defined scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions to obtain a comprehensive overview on how entities impact the climate. \u2026 \u2018It\u2019s not fair\u2019 is a lame excuse for avoiding taking any responsibility.\u201d\n\n\u2018Monitored and regulated\u2019\n\nAmong other solutions to Bitcoin\u2019s outsized water usage, de Vries suggested locating Bitcoin mining facilities in places with \u201cfavourable climate conditions to minimise direct water consumption\u201d; \u201cImmersing mining devices in a dielectric fluid\u201d that can \u201cprovide cooling without relying on water\u201d; and using power sources that don\u2019t require fresh water, such as solar and wind.\n\nLike de Vries, Madani says Bitcoiners should try to find ways to reduce the network\u2019s energy and water use.\n\nStill, he too had misgivings about de Vries\u2019 commentary: For example, terms like \u201cwater footprint\u201d and \u201cwater consumption\u201d seem to be used interchangeably even though they have different, and specific meanings in environmental research \u2014 a red flag, according to Madani. (De Vries said his commentary \u201cspecifies the definitions of water consumption and water footprint in this article, essentially limiting what is considered as the water footprint and making the two terms interchangeable. Considering the full water footprint as understood by common definitions may result in a larger number.\u201d)\n\nAnd he wants researchers to find a way to communicate without antagonising the industry, lest it alienate its natural audience.\n\n\u201cWe have to be extremely careful about the metrics that we present to the public, and the potential interpretation of those metrics,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cResearch like this should deliver the message in a way that people do not think scientists are against technological disruptions, especially the positive ones. The goal here is to highlight some impacts that need to be monitored and regulated.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) surged past $41,000 Monday morning, with some investors speculating the Federal Reserve could be done raising rates and hopes that a spot bitcoin ETF approval could cause the cryptocurrency to rise even further. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith breaks down the rally and the outlook for the cryptocurrency.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, taking a look at Bitcoin climbing higher today, jumping above $41,000 after briefly climbing as high as $42,000 as investors speculate the likelihood of a spot ETF and bet big on the end of rate hikes. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith is here to talk about these recent moves. So David, there is some positivity fueling the hype. But historically, how has Bitcoin performed to the closed out the year?\n\nDAVID HOLLERITH: Yeah. Rachelle, absolutely. You know, right now Bitcoin is up about 150% year-to-date. So it's on pace to have its second best year of performance for the past six years. So if we look back at 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, we're seeing in 2019, it was up about 90%. 2020 is obviously the biggest year on record for what we have.\n\nAnd then 2022, last year was the biggest drop. And Bitcoin has had bigger drops in the past, but it kind of highlights what 2023 has been. It's been sort of an outrageous recovery of the asset despite a lot of regulatory uncertainty at least in the US.\n\nSo right now, since Bitcoin has crossed the $42,000 mark earlier this morning, it's set to basically where the price was trading before a lot of the calamity in the industry took place in the spring of last year, which led to a number of blow ups and that sort of reset and also a lot of regulatory crackdowns in the US, which sort of started the beginning of this year of how we saw the market sort of changing.\n\nSo as far as what's going on next year, I think that there's a lot of hopes about next year in terms of the macroeconomic environment and also some industry-specific things a little bit less regulatory risks in some areas that are leading traders to be a lot more optimistic about it.\n\nStory continues\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: So David, can we talk about that optimism? I mean, there are some calls right now that are pretty bullish. $100,000 going into 2024?\n\nDAVID HOLLERITH: Yeah. I mean, I'm not sure about the calls. But you know, I think essentially what you have is you have this Bitcoin spot ETF, which has been the story for many months. And that's become increasingly optimistic, at least from a trader standpoint. And that's because the SEC is-- we have reports that the SEC is actually engaging with some of the people who are applying to issue.\n\nSo it looks like those conversations are still happening. So that might be on the table. Then we also have this everything rally that's happening across markets where people are getting more optimistic about the Federal Reserve being finished with interest rate hikes and the cuts could even be coming next year.\n\nAnd then we also have Binance recently had their settlement with the Justice Department. And that was hanging over the market as sort of one of the known last shoes to drop in the industry in terms of all the things that happened last year. FTX going bankrupt obviously being the largest sort of taking some of the risk out of the market. And so that's opening up more investors to look at crypto again and feel a little bit more comfortable with what's going on.\n\nAnd then the other thing Bitcoin has a supply cut that's coming next year too. So that means that the issuance will be cut. And this has usually preceded a rally in Bitcoin for the following year. So that's another thing that Bitcoin believers are really optimistic about.\n\nSo all that to say a lot of potential tailwinds, but then also too there's a lot of court cases still going on with the SEC and other companies. Coinbase and Binance both still in the courts. And you know, neither of those cases will be finished anytime soon. So plenty of uncertainty, but it seems like a lot more optimism in the recent weeks.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Uncertainty and volatility seems to be certainly the steady word there around Bitcoin. But we'll be watching. David Hollerith, thanks so much for that."

        "content": "So joining us now to discuss the crypto markets is innovating capital, general partner and Pastel Network co-founder, Anthony Georgiadis. Welcome back, Anthony, thanks for having me on. Glad to see you again. So Bitcoin breaking above uh that 40,000 mark now as a forehand uh last we checked uh what do you think is driving this year? Yeah, there's a, there's a lot going on right now. It's obviously exciting to see. I think first and foremost is, you know, you mentioned obviously the terror collapse of a couple of years ago and really how we haven't seen these prices since pre terror. But I think, you know, really what to go back in time a little bit here, what's been driving the price um downward and what we've seen in terms of a lot of the overall selling pressure over the last year or so. And really what drove the tar collapse has been obviously a lot of hawkish policy from the fed. I think over the last several months, it's become very, very clear that monetary policy has probably reached a point of of tapering. We're going to start to see potentially rating rate reductions and a couple, excuse me, couple rate reductions next year. Um With CP I and and corn actually really cooling off in a positive way in tandem with that. Um Obviously, you know, you can look at the price of gold in the last couple of days here, we have increasing global pressures around the world, increased macroeconomic strains and you know, in tandem with some of the shift in monetary policy, um a lot of institutional investors in sovereign states are looking towards more safe haven and deflationary assets in terms of overall portfolio allocation and broader diversification. The last point as well as obviously a lot of the broader sentiment. Um that's really kind of ramped up with regards to some of the ETF applications and potentially regulatory softening that will pave the way for those applications to really be pushed through and you know, to make it clear spot. ETF S not necessarily the traditional futures based ETF S that we've seen historically. So this is this is the part that I'm trying to grapple with here. Gold, as you mentioned all time, high gold is the ultimate safe haven since I don't know, uh Sumer Sumerian Times. I mean, this is this is where people went Bitcoin for several years was considered the ultimate risk on asset. It was a bet on the future of money, a different type of money. Yet they are both now at all that they're both now at highs. I don't want to say Bitcoins at an all time high, strip away the bubbles of, say US T and the bubble of FTX and all of a sudden you've got, yeah, one could argue that this is maybe more of a real high than those highs before I'll get to that in a second. How does that make sense though? Risk on versus safe haven both at highs at a time when the fed? Even though, uh, we're, we're talking about maybe this might be uh the, the rate hikes might have come to an end. We're not 100% certain because Powell said, don't take that off the table yet. It doesn't all jive does it, is there something else fundamentally happening in crypto other than the spot ETF argument? Because that, that's a different story as well? But is there something that has to do with the market structure of Bitcoin and how and how it's traded such as the change in what's going on in the largest centralized exchange? Binance having an effect on the price now? Mhm. Well, you know, first, even with an asset like gold, it's not as clear cut and dry as safe haven versus risk on right, in a lower interest rate environment, the opportunity cost of holding a non-interest bearing asset such as gold is dramatically reduced, which is why we've obviously seen historically speaking and right now, um with the forward looking forecast of potentially rate reductions, the spot gold prices reaching record highs. And you put that in tandem with obviously some of the global pressures that we discussed and really the appetite towards moving towards something that is very much so a safe haven asset. Now, with respect to Bitcoin, it does certainly demonstrate those very two distinct characteristics. When you're buying into Bitcoin, you're buying into the potential future growth that an asset such as this might hold, you know, the world of web three digital based economies, uh peer to peer transactions, whatever it might be. And obviously, that behaves very much similar to a tech equity with a certain level of risk on characteristics. And it's going to stand to benefit from monetary policy that's moving towards Dovish sentiment on the flip side. It's very clear that Bitcoin and it happens with, you know, every having as something that's actually coming up. Um in April of next year, Bitcoin has taken on the characteristics of truly being a deflationary asset and decentralized money. Um obviously on the backing of the financial banking coll that we saw earlier this year with continue global tensions across the world. Um whether it's in Asia or Europe or wherever it might be, there is a strong sentiment and demand to diversify away from sovereign bank based currencies directly. So I really think the important thing we had one whale by about half a bi it seems and this is from uh stuff that we've reported on coin desk, we had a whale by about half a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin. And I think this is what I'm getting at. Um That, that's, that's not small. It's on the other hand, relative to the rest of the assets in the world, half a billion dollars that, that's pocket change uh in, let's say treasuries nonetheless, in Bitcoin, that, that matters what is going on there. That's, that would cause one particular whale or, and by whale, it could be institution, it could be whatever, what would cause one individual buyer to go out and purchase that much Bitcoin unless there's something going on other than it doesn't seem to jive this idea. Well, it's macro it's micro like what's going on, do we know? Yeah. Well, I mean, listen, I mean, the the tip of the curve here is that we are looking like we're going to be seeing a 180 degree uh reaction in terms of monetary policy. So I think building up to that and obviously the anticipation, you know, if you look at where the yield curve is right now, it's very clear that we think and obviously private credit has been a tremendous beneficiary of this as well. Um It's very clear that rates are probably going to come down much faster than we anticipated and there is going to be massive risk on sentiment moving forward. You know, I do want to make a point though, you know, as you mentioned, with some of these whales that are going out and acquiring a ton of Bitcoin. What's unique about this is yes, there is that speculative component here. But I think that there is also the long term asset positioning in portfolios that is taking place today that may have not taken place in previous cycles. And what I mean by that is I am getting calls from some of our investors for the first time ever. Not asking me necessarily how to go buy Bitcoin, but how to actually self custody it because they're looking to acquire Bitcoin, they're looking to take it off exchanges and hold it in cold wallets with the purpose and intent of holding it really into perpetuity. And I think it's a very distinct phase that we're in right now in terms of how institutions and investors are obviously thinking through portfolio positioning, but also through the actual acquisition and long term exposure to this asset class. I want to talk about Ether quickly before we wrap this. It's also up almost 4% this morning, up over $2200. What do you think is driving interest in Ether? Especially since NFT indexes are down NFT volumes are down and during the last last bull market, the narrative between Ether and NFTS was very different. Mhm. Mhm. Well, one thing I do want to note is that the NFT market is seeing a bit of a resurgence specifically within the Solana ecosystem. So yes, there has been some contraction with respect to NFTS and the Ethereum ecosystem and has, as we know them today. Um you know, that being said in the world of Ethereum, um there has been a ton of innovation and marketable opportunities with respect to layer two scaling solutions um as well as a variety of web three applications. Ethereum is, you know, really this global computer of sorts that's gonna power the next wave of internet based businesses in this web three world. And I think for the most part, we've seen a tremendous amount of broader user growth, not necessarily specifically in NFTS, but across defi gaming, real world applications um as well as technological advancements that make a lot of these applications much more competitive with the broader web two world. So a lot of that is coming together right now and I think that the market is certainly paying attention to that."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin holdings are currently worth nearly $2B more than what the company paid.\n\nUnder CEO Michael Saylor\u2019s leadership, the company has been continuously stacking BTC since 2020.\n\nIn November, MicroStrategy bought 16,130 BTC at an average price of $36,785 per coin.\n\nWhen MicroStrategy started investing in Bitcoin in 2020, CEO Michael Saylor lauded the cryptocurrency as a \u201cdependable store of value and an attractive investment asset.\u201d\n\nAt the end of November, MicroStrategy was sitting on Bitcoin worth over $7.2B, nearly $2B more than what it paid, cementing the firm\u2019s position as the world\u2019s largest BTC whale and seeming to validate Saylor\u2019s enduring bullishness.\n\nMicroStrategy Keeps On Buying\n\nIn a recent post on X, Saylor revealed that Microstrategy purchased 16,130 BTC in November at an average price of $36,785 per coin. Since it started investing in the cryptocurrency, MicroStrategy has paid an average of $30,252 per BTC.\n\nMicroStrategy has acquired an additional 16,130 BTC for ~$593.3 million at an average price of $36,785 per #bitcoin . As of 11/29/23, @MicroStrategy now hodls 174,530 $BTC acquired for ~$5.28 billion at an average price of $30,252 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/hSEZyzGBsr \u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) November 30, 2023\n\nNovember\u2019s acquisitions represent Microstrategy\u2019s largest monthly BTC purchases since investing $1B in February 2021. The recent spending spree has been especially prominent, but month after month, through bull and bear markets, the company has rarely stopped buying Bitcoin, even borrowing hundreds of millions of dollars to fund its purchases.\n\nAfter crypto markets flatlined for most of the summer, at one point in September, Microstrategy had unrealized losses of around $500M from its Bitcoin investments.\n\nIn the long run, however, temporary losses could arguably be justified in the name of buying the dip. And for now, at least, Saylor\u2019s strategy has paid off, with investments made when BTC was trading below $30,000 up 30% or more.\n\nShare Price Rallies As MicroStrategy\u2019s BTC Holdings Swell\n\nMicroStrategy now owns so much BTC that it could soon control 1% of the total supply. According to Saylor\u2019s latest announcement, the company holds 144,530 coins, representing nearly 0.74% of the circulating supply of around 19.56M BTC on December 4.\n\nGiven its massive crypto hoard, MicroStrategy\u2019s share price has surged by around 275% in 2023, rising with the price of BTC.\n\nMicroStrategy share price.\n\nSignificantly, the company\u2019s stock market performance throughout the year closely tracks the ups and downs of the crypto market. For example, MicroStrategy stock witnessed a major jump as Bitcoin rallied in mid-October."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin Surged Higher This Weekend - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What a weekend it has been in the crypto world. Three of the world's largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC -4.36%), Ethereum (ETH -5.13%), and Dogecoin (DOGE 2.06%), have seen impressive rallies, with a few key psychological thresholds broken through. As of noon ET, these three tokens are up 5.8%, 6.4% and 6.4%, respectively, since Friday at 4 p.m. ET.\n\nGiven the rapidly changing economic backdrop and volatility we've seen in everything from bond yields (discount rates) to alternative asset prices, it's wroth diving into what's catalyzing these moves today.\n\nWhat's driving this rally?\n\nBitcoin's rally to more than $42,000 per token in early trading this morning represented the largest level the megacap cryptocurrency has seen since early 2022. Interestingly, this move in Bitcoin has been correlated to a surge in the price of spot gold, which recently broke through a record high of $2,100 earlier today, as investors appear to be increasing their bets that inflation could pick up.\n\nSinking bond yields and heightened geopolitical concerns appear to be driving investors to alternative assets, such as Bitcoin, propping up the entire sector today. Additional interest continues to form around Bitcoin due to its upcoming halving event, which is anticipated to take place in 2024, as well as capital inflows from incoming spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe direction Bitcoin moves often informs how Ethereum performs on a given day, and certainly some of Ether's recent rise can be attributed to this bullish narrative forming in alternative assets. However, Ethereum has also benefited from some token-specific catalysts worth pointing out. Most notably, Mantle has rolled out a liquid staking protocol on Ethereum's main network, suggesting that the Ethereum staking markets could become more decentralized. Ethereum's price has surged above $2,200 per token at the time of writing, marking a high not seen since mid-2022 as well.\n\nFinally, Dogecoin's rally appears to be closely correlated to the broader move in the overall sector, with speculators and traders continuing to focus on this meme coin as a way to play the crypto sector's momentum in either direction. This correlation can be seen in the liquidation data for Dogecoin, with roughly $2 million of perpetual futures contracts liquidated yesterday, one of the largest spikes we've seen in recent months.\n\nAre these cryptos worth buying into at year end?\n\nFor investors seeking diversification or are particularly interested in hedging some of their equity exposure with alternative assets, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum remain top of mind (in addition to gold, of course) as ways of both generating better alpha (higher returns) during bull markets, and potentially providing some downside protection via these assets' lower beta (lower correlation moves) in down cycles.\n\nThat said, the 2022 bear market highlighted some of the risks of putting cryptos in the same bucket as other alternative assets. Gold and other commodities performed much better than crypto last year, so betting on these digital assets as any sort of hedge against uncertainty is still a strategy that's unproven (considering the world's first crypto, Bitcoin, was conceived post-great financial crisis).\n\nOverall, these three tokens certainly appear to reflect a growing consensus that some sort of soft-ish landing is ahead. While I'm not as certain as many of the top economists and talking heads that such a landing can be achieved, it's possible. And for those looking for a way to ride any positive momentum right now, these three assets are certainly in high demand.\n\nI'm remaining cautious on crypto until there's more clarity, but I can also certainly see why investor positioning is favoring these assets right now."

        "content": "The price of bitcoin (BTC) climbed above $42,000 \u2013 a level not seen since before the crash of Terra \u2013 for the first time since April 2022 while ether (ETH) moved past $2,200. Bitcoin\u2019s price had been toying with the $40,000 level in recent days, and finally breached it Monday to trade above $41,600 as of press time, according to CoinDesk Indices data, a 24-hour rise of about 6%. Ether was trading around $2,240, a similar percentage gain. The advance spurred crypto stocks higher, too. Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) jumped almost 9% in pre-market trading, as did Microstrategy (MSTR). Crypto miners such as Marathon Digital (MARA) and Riot (RIOT) added more than 10%. The other top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization marked smaller gains, and BNB coin (BNB), a token affiliated with the Binance exchange, was little changed."

        "content": "Bitcoin Above $41K \u2013 Why Is It Going Up?\n\nBitcoin has put in another yearly high today and briefly crossed $42,000.\n\nWhy is Bitcoin up ~60% over the last two months? And where does this rally end?\n\nHere\u2019s all you need to know\u2026\n\nWhy Bitcoin Suddenly Catapulted to Highs\n\nThe last time Bitcoin traded above $40K was before the Terra crash.\n\nAnd there are several reasons for this sudden price explosion!\n\nThe biggest narrative is surely the spot Bitcoin ETF, which could unlock as much as $70B in new demand for Bitcoin.\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETF timeline indicates an approval could come between Jan 5 and Jan 10. Bloomberg senior analysts are putting the chances of approval at over 90%.\n\nBut Bitcoin is also benefiting from macro tailwinds. The inflation top seems to be in and the Fed has stopped hiking rates. In fact, the consensus opinion is that the Fed will cut rates in 2024 \u2013 and it could be as much as a 2.75% decrease over the year, according to UBS. Interest rates have a strong effect on crypto markets. The lower the interest rate, the better for crypto.\n\nRead also: Rate Hikes and the Fed \u2013 How Do They Affect Crypto Markets?\n\nAnd then there is the halving. This supply shock has traditionally been bullish for Bitcoin. With more demand from institutional investors and less supply thanks to the halving, the chances of a 2024 bull run look great.\n\nBut how long will this rally last?\n\n$45K By New Year?\n\nMarkus Thielen, research head at crypto services provider Matrixport and founder of analytics portal DeFi Research, told CoinDesk that Bitcoin could reach $45K by the end of the year. Options traders are positioned bullishly and futures markets have opened new premiums, which hints at potential short-term gains to come.\n\nTraders on Crypto Twitter are also mostly bullish. $46K seems to be in play, according to Bluntz Capital:\n\nPeter Schiff, who enjoyed a gold rally along with the Bitcoin rally is (of course) bearish. Another potential indicator for more gains?\n\nThe CMC Fear & Greed Index is at 75, indicating greed but not extreme greed just yet. There seems to be still a bit more room to run for Bitcoin:\n\nStory continues\n\nBut what happens next if the spot ETF gets approved?\n\nThe 2024 Outlook for Bitcoin\n\nThe consensus in the industry is that 2024 will be even more bullish than 2023.\n\nDebt burdens in several states are rising, which is prompting a flight into hard assets: gold, real estate and Bitcoin. In fact, Bitcoin already put in all-time highs in softer currencies like the Argentine Peso or the Turkish Lira. Talks of the Supercycle are back on the table on Crypto Twitter:\n\nBut could the spot ETF approval (if it is approved) be a \u2018sell the news\u2019 event?\n\nIt could, says venture capitalist Chris Burniske:\n\nFor starters, a spot ETF approval would not mean BlackRock and friends start buying Bitcoin right away. It would take some time to get the financial plumbing done for the funds to start allocating.\n\nFurthermore, we don\u2019t know how much BlackRock and other ETF issuers will allocate. It will be a sizeable position but just how much is guesswork on part of analysts. Once euphoria from the ETF subsides, market participants may find that allocations could take longer and be smaller than expected.\n\nEither way, Bitcoin and Ethereum look firmly bullish for 2024. Remember, BlackRock filed for an Ethereum ETF as well. Congrats to everybody who survived the bear market.\n\nWe are so back!"

        "content": "Bitcoin has experienced a 150% surge in value throughout the year, reaching over $42,000 early Monday morning. This explosive growth comes amidst mounting anticipation surrounding the potential launch of a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States.\n\nThe main contributing factor to Bitcoin's recent surge, in addition to the halving event approaching amongst other bullish developments, appears to be the mounting speculation surrounding the approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF by regulatory authorities in the United States. Such an ETF, if approved, would allow traditional investors to gain exposure to spot Bitcoin, potentially boosting the price of the asset.\n\n\"Money will flood into the industry with a Bitcoin ETF, it's just easy to buy it,\" said Tom Farley, the former President of the New York Stock Exchange on CNBC a couple weeks ago. \"People believe in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a great invention. It is a store of value.\"\n\nMarket analysts have been repeatedly beating the drum on that the introduction of an ETF would attract a fresh influx of institutional investments, further bolstering Bitcoin's position as a mainstream asset class.\n\nLast Thursday, $250 billion asset manager founder Ric Edelman said financial advisors are waiting for spot Bitcoin ETFs to be approved before providing their clients exposure to BTC.\n\nThis past Friday, Grayscale stated \"we believe that regulatory approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. is a matter of 'when', not a matter of 'if'.\" The next day, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted that the next window of potential ETF approvals is now January 5-10, 2024. \"Really this means that any potential approval orders are going to come on either Monday Jan 8, Tuesday Jan 9, or Wednesday Jan 10,\" he explained. \"Mark your calendars people.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

Meaning more short sellers could continue to suffer losses if they fail to reprice their bets.\n\nBinance saw the most action, with traders on the exchange suffering $120 million in liquidations across a slew of cryptocurrencies. Short sellers lost $66 million on Binance, $23 million of which were on their Bitcoin bets.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nLiquidations occur when traders make bets on leverage and can no longer meet the requirements of the trade. When this happens, the exchange closes the traders\u2019 position at a partial or full loss.\n\nThe largest single liquidation occurred on BitMEX, where one trader lost over $6 million trading Bitcoin perpetual futures, or perps.\n\nBitMEX pioneered the trading of perps in crypto, giving traders the opportunity to trade at 100x leverage \u2014 or 100 times their cash balance.\n\nUnlike other derivatives contracts, perps have no settlement date and trade in perpetuity, giving traders greater flexibility.\n\nLeverage is a high risk high reward strategy typically used by pro-traders.\n\nThe liquidations come as Bitcoin surged to levels last seen before the collapse of the Terra ecosystem.\n\nThe biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation traded around $42,000 on Monday morning, its highest price since April 2021.\n\nUpdate: A previous version of this article implied that Bitcoin\u2019s price has tripled.

WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SILVER LINING CONTINUES TO BE AI AND A $7 MILLION VALUATION. WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY'VE MANAGED TO BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME WITH THE RIGHT TECH. \u266a CAROLINE: A CLOUD COMPUTING PROVIDER IS ONE OF THE STOP -- HOTTEST STARTUPS IN THE AI RACE. OTHERS INCLUDING JP MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT, ALL PARTICIPATING THAT VALUES A COMPANY AT $7 BILLION ACCORDING TO SOURCES. SHE CAN GET A SOURCE VERY CLOSE TO THE DEAL NOW, NONE OTHER THAN THEIR CEO. IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY STORY OF CORE WE'VE GOING FROM ITS ORIGINS OF COMMODITIES TREATIES TO THE SPACE FOR CRYPTO. THEN YOU BECOME A SPECIALIZED CLOUD AI PROVIDER. WHAT MAKES YOUR OFFERING DIFFERENT FROM THE MORE GENERAL-PURPOSE LAB PROVIDERS OUT THERE? > > SHARE. FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, GREAT TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU. IT'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY EXCITING DAY OVER HERE. MY OWN TEAM IS VERY EXCITED ABOUT THESE TRANSACTIONS AS WE GOING TO THE END OF THE YEAR. LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING OFF THE NEXT YEAR IN THE SAME FOOTING. TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, WHAT WE MEAN BY THAT IS WE NEED EVERY DECISION FROM THE HARDWARE STACK ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE SOFTWARE STACK TO REALLY BUILD THE CLOUD THAT IS SPECIALIZED TO ADDRESS ANY OF THE COMPANIES WITH MASSIVE SCALE. WE ARE REALLY TALKING ABOUT THE THREE INDUSTRIES THAT WE ADDRESS. THE FIRST ONE IS MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT. IF YOU GO SEE A MARBLE MOVIE, THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE THAT SEVERAL OF THE STUDIOS WILL HAVE RENDERED THEIR IMAGE. BASIC SCIENCE, SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY. THINK ABOUT IS DRUG DISCOVERY AND PROTEIN FORM. AND FINALLY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY RIGHT NOW, OBVIOUSLY IS THE BUILDOUT OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS VERY, VERY APPROPRIATE FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING. ED: I KEEP HEARING ABOUT THE SORT OF BOOMING GROWTH THAT YOU'VE EXPERIENCED. I THINK YOU STARTED THE YEAR DISCLOSING YOU HAD THREE DATA CENTERS ONLINE. NOW I BELIEVE IT OR SOMEWHERE NEAR 14 AND 18. HOW HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO MOVE SO QUICKLY ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE? > > GREAT TEAMS ALL ACROSS THE INFRASTRUCTURE. JUST INCREDIBLE COORDINATION, AUTOMATION TO ALLOW US TO KIND OF BUILD AND SCALE THAT. WE ALSO HAVE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS OF THROUGH THE SUPPLY CHAINS THAT HAVE BEEN SO DIFFICULT FOR EVERYONE TO NAVIGATE. SUPPORT FROM THEIR PARTNERS ALTER THE SUPPLY CHAIN HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE. WE'VE MADE A MASSIVE PUSH IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF DATA CENTERS THAT WE ARE IN. IT PUTS US IN A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO SERVE THE LARGEST, MOST IMPORTANT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MODELS THAT ARE BEING SERVED TO THE PUBLIC RIGHT NOW. IT'S VERY EXCITING. GOT A LOT MORE WORK TO DO, BUT DEFINITELY IMPROVING AND INCREASING OUR FOOTPRINT EVERY DAY. ED: ONE OF THOSE PARTNERS IS NVIDIA. SHOWING SOME OF YOUR KEY CUSTOMERS ON THE SCREEN. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU ARE ACTUALLY HELPING THEM, YOU YOURSELVES TO BUILD THEIR OWN NEXT-GENERATION SUPERCOMPUTER. WHAT DO YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT PROJECT? > > NVIDIA IS A WONDERFUL PARTNER OF OURS. THEY INVESTED ALONGSIDE MAGNA TAR AND K2 IN OUR B ROUND WHICH IS WHERE WE RAISED $420 MILLION IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR. IT WAS A MASSIVE STEP FOR US AS WE BEGIN TO ACCELERATE OUR GROWTH THROUGH THE YEAR, AND SO BY HAVING A PARTNER LIKE NVIDIA INVEST IN THE COMPANY, IT MADE VERY CLEAR TO ALL THE PARTNERS ACROSS THE DEBT SPACE, ACROSS THE EQUITY SPACE THAT THEY HAD LOOKED AT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND WERE COMFORTABLE WITH THE WAY THAT WE BUILT IT IN ORDER TO DELIVER THE MOST PERFORMING CONFIGURATION OF THE ACCELERATED COMPUTING DEFINED BY THEIR GP. CAROLINE: YOU'VE BEEN RAISING MONEY, WHETHER IT BE EQUITY OR DEBT A QUITE A PACE BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE DOING NEEDS A LOT OF MONEY. WHEN YOU TAP THE PUBLIC MARKETS, YOU THINK ABOUT GOING PUBLIC AS SOON AS 2024? > > AS YOU SAID, WE REALLY NEED THREE DIFFERENT TRANSACTIONS THIS YEAR. WE DID AROUND EARLY ON THAT WAS 21 MILLION RAISE. WE CAME BACK AND WE DID A VERY, VERY LARGE DEBT FACILITY THAT WAS $2.3 MILLION THAT WAS REALLY DEDICATED TO PURCHASING THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS REQUIRED. THE SECONDARY TRANSACTION IS THE FINAL TRANSACTION FOR US OF THE YEAR. WE ARE NOT COMMITTED OR HAVE NO REAL COMMENT AROUND THE CONCEPT OF GOING INTO THE PUBLIC MARKETS OTHER THAN TO SAY WE ARE CAPITAL INTENSIVE BUSINESS AND WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO CONTINUE TO ACCESS CAPITAL MARKETS AND THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY POSSIBLE. AS FAR AS THAT GOES, ALL OPTIONS ARE ABSOLUTELY ON THE TABLE FOR US AS WE LOOK INTO THE FUTURE. ED: QUICKLY, YOU BUILD ON H 100, BUT AMD IS COMING WITH MI 300. HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THAT? > > WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME RESEARCHING ALL THE DIFFERENT LOOK AND ALTERNATIVES IN THE MARKET. RIGHT NOW THE FOCUS IS ON THE H 100. I WOULD ARGUE THAT AS YOU LOOK ACROSS THE AI SPACE AT LARGE, THE FOCUS IS ON THE H 100. IT IS AN AMAZING PIECE OF SILICON, DOES INCREDIBLE THINGS IN TERMS OF MOVING THE AI SPACE FORWARD. IT HAS REALLY BEEN THE MAJORITY OF OUR EFFORT. WE DO MONITOR ALL OF THE DIFFERENCE LOOK AT ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE OUT THERE. ED: COREWEAVE'S CEO, NICE TO CATCH UP WITH YOU. SELLING MINORITY STAKE AT A BIG VALUATION. COMING UP, LARRY SUMMERS WEIGHS IN ON WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A MEMBER OF OPENAI'S NEWLY FORMED BOARD. WE ARE GOING TO BRING YOU THOSE DETAILS NEXT. \u266a ED: TIME FOR TALKING TECH, AND FIRST UP, GINA RAIMONDO SAYS IF THE U.S. TRULY WANTS TO STOP CHINA FROM MAKING CUTTING EDGE SEMICONDUCTORS, THAT HER DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO NEED MORE FUNDING. ON SATURDAY, SHE ALSO URGED AMERICAN CHIP COMPANIES TO PRIORITIZE NATIONAL SECURITY OVER THERE REVENUE. IN ONE OF THE CHIPMAKING INDUSTRY'S MOST VALUABLE SUPPLIERS IS SINKING DEEPER INTO DEBT DESPITE HOLDING MORE THAN 90% SHARE. THE CHEMICAL BASED IN JAPAN HAS NOT LISTED PRICES BECAUSE OF FEARS IT WOULD SCOURGE RELATIONSHIPS WITH -- SEMICONDUCTORS. PLUS, CALIFORNIA'S PRIVATE THE AGENCY HAS DRAFTED A SET OF RULES THAT AIM TO GIVE RESIDENTS MORE AGENCY OVER HOW THEIR PERSONAL DATA IS USED BY AUTOMATED TOOLS. IF ADOPTED, THE PROPOSAL WOULD AFFECT OUR TECH COMPANIES DEVELOP AI, WHICH RELAYS HEAVILY ON DATA AT THE TRAIN ITSELF. BOARD MEMBERS WILL DISCUSS THE DRAFT ON SATURDAY THOUGH ENFORCEMENT ISN'T LIKELY TO START ANYTIME SOON. CAROLINE: STICK ON AI BECAUSE LARRY SUMMERS IS HOPING TO GET SETTLED INTO HIS NEW ROLE AS A BOARD MEMBER OF THE SO-CALLED INTERIM BOARD OF OPENAI. OF COURSE, THE KEY STARTUP. HE SHARED HIS THOUGHTS ON THE MATTER ON WALL STREET WEEK WITH DAVID WESTIN. TAKE A LISTEN. > > THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT. NO ONE CAN BE CERTAIN WHETHER THIS WAS ONCE A DECADE, ONCE A HALF-CENTURY, ONCE A CENTURY OR ONCE A MILLENNIUM. NO ONE COULD KNOW THAT FOR SURE. BUT IT SURE LOOKS LIKE IT IS AWFULLY IMPORTANT TO DEVELOP RAPIDLY AND SAFELY AND TO DISSEMINATE EFFECTIVELY AND WELL. SO WHEN I WAS OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE PART OF CONTRIBUTING TO THAT OVERSEEING TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS EFFECTIVELY DONE AND TO DO WOODWORKING WITH SOME VERY GREAT PEOPLE, I THOUGHT IT WAS A REAL OPPORTUNITY AND I WAS GLAD TO DO IT. > > I DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM YOUR TECHNOLOGICAL EXPERTISE FOR WHAT YOU JUST SAID SAFELY STRIKES ME AS PART OF WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON AND THAT GETS TO QUESTIONS OF GOVERNANCE, ABOUT HOW YOU HANDLE THIS TECHNOLOGY. DO YOU HAVE AN OVERALL SENSE OF WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO GET THAT \"SAFELY\" PART RIGHT? > > THEY ARE GOING TO SEND ME THE ONBOARDING PACKET FOR THE BOARD ON SUNDAY. SO I SHOULDN'T BE SAYING TOO MUCH AT ALL BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH. HERE'S SOME THINGS I THINK I KNOW. I THINK I KNOW THAT A COMPANY LIKE THIS HAS TO BE PREPARED TO COOPERATE. THAT DOESN'T MEAN ALWAYS AGREEING WITH, BUT COOPERATING WITH KEY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ON REGULATORY ISSUES, ON NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES, ON DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGY ISSUES. I THINK I KNOW ALSO, AND THIS IS INTEGRAL TO THE STRUCTURE OF OPENAI, THE ENTITY ITSELF IS A CREATURE OF A NOT-FOR-PROFIT ENTITY THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE A CORPORATION WITH A CONSCIENCE. AND THAT WE NEED TO BE ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT THE MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS TECHNOLOGY AND AS A BOARD MEMBER, THAT WILL BE PART OF MY RESPONSIBILITY WORKING WITH OTHER BOARD MEMBERS TO MAKE THAT CERTAIN. MY COLLEAGUE AT HARVARD, LATE COLLEAGUE SAID CONSCIENCE IS THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SOMEONE IS WATCHING. AND I THINK IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED IN THIS TO BE THINKING VERY CAREFULLY ALWAYS ABOUT BOTH OPPORTUNITIES AND UNCERTAINTIES, AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ARE BALANCED IN THE BEST WAY THAT IS POSSIBLE. ED: THAT WAS FORMER U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY LARRY SUMMERS SITTING DOWN WITH DAVID WESTIN. WE SHOULD ALSO KNOW THAT LARRY SUMMERS A HARVARD UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR AND A PAID CONTRIBUTOR TO BLOOMBERG TV AND WALL STREET WEEK. NOW, AS WE KEEP AN EYE ON THE SITUATION WITH THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR, THE SITUATION IS ALSO ONE THAT HAS BEEN HARD TO MANAGE ONLINE. TIKTOK IS HAVING A HARD TIME MODERATING DEEPFAKE VIDEOS OF HAMAS VICTIMS AND OTHER PRIVATE CITIZENS. EVEN THOUGH THESE VIDEOS VIOLATE THEIR CONTENT MODERATION POLICIES WHICH BAN AI-GENERATED VIDEOS, AND YET THESE VIDEOS ARE RACKING UP THOUSANDS TO MILLIONS OF VIEWS. I WANT TO BRING IN ALEX WHO HAS BEEN WRITING ABOUT THIS THIS MORNING ON BLOOMBERG. THAT IS THE STRUGGLE. THEY ARE IN CONTRAVENTION OF THE POLICY BEING SEEN BY MILLIONS. > > IN THE DAYS AFTER THE OCTOBER 7 ATTACK IN ISRAEL ON THAT MUSIC FESTIVAL, I WAS LOOKING ON THE AVENUE FOR SOME OF THE NAMES OF SOME OF THE BELIEVED VICTIMS AND SOME OF THE TOP VIDEOS WERE AI- GENERATED VIDEOS THAT PURPORTED TO AND SHOWED FOLKS LIKE THE 22-YEAR-OLD NOW KNOWN TO BE DEAD GERMAN-ISRAELI WOMAN WHO YOU SAW HER FACE, YOU SAW AN IMAGE LIKE HER STANDING IN FRONT OF FOLKS IN MILITARY GARB HOLDING GUNS TALKING ABOUT HER THOUGHTS ON THE ATTACK, TALKING ABOUT HER MOTHER, BUT THIS WAS NOT, IN FACT, HER. THIS WAS A DIGITAL RESURRECTION AS EXPERTS CALL IT, WHERE SOMEBODY WENT ONLINE, USED ONE OF THESE INCREASINGLY INEXPENSIVE TOOLS TO TAKE SOME PHOTOS OF HER FROM THE INTERNET AND TURN IT INTO AN AI-GENERATED VIDEO. NOW, THESE VIDEOS ARE AGAINST THE CONTENT GUIDELINES TIKTOK. PRIVATE CITIZENS AND MINORS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BE PORTRAYED IN WHAT TIKTOK BECAUSE SYNTHETIC MEDIA WHICH INCLUDES AI-VIDEOS, BUT THAT VIDEO RACKED UP 7 MILLION VIEWS ALONE BEFORE I SEND IT TO TIKTOK AND THEY TOOK IT DOWN. THERE ARE DOZENS OF ADDITIONAL VIDEOS LIKE THIS PORTRAYING BOTH VICTIMS OF HAMAS, TH REE-YOUR-OLD MURDER VICTIMS OF A CHILD'S VOICE TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY DIED AND THE INJURIES SUSTAINED AND THESE VIDEOS ARE LIVE AND AGAIN, RACKING UP THOUSANDS TO MILLIONS OF VIEWS AND SOMETIMES GOING VIRAL. THIS IS JUST AN INDICATOR TO ME AT THIS EARLY WAVE OF WHERE AI IS SITTING REAL PEOPLE AND IN PARTICULAR, PEOPLE WHO CANNOT ACTUALLY DEFEND THEMSELVES WHEN THEY SEE THEIR LIKENESS OUT THERE ON SOCIAL MEDIA. CAROLINE: SO DEEPLY EMOTIVE. JUST TO SAY WHAT TIKTOK HAS COME BACK WITH, THEY CONTINUE TO INVEST IN DETECTION AND TRANSPARENCY TO ADDRESS THIS RAPIDLY EVOLVING TECHNOLOGY, BUT THEREIN LIES THE ISSUE. IT IS A RAPIDLY EVOLVING TECHNOLOGY. DO YOU THINK MORE COULD BE DONE INTERNALLY BY TIKTOK AND INDEED, THE OTHER KEY SOCIAL MEDIA PLAYERS OUT HERE? > > THEY'VE ALREADY ROLLED OUT TOOLS TO ASK USERS TO OPT INTO LABEL AI ON VIDEOS THAT USE AI, BUT MOST OF THESE VIDEOS THAT I CAME ACROSS DIDN'T HAVE THAT LABEL. IT'S CLEAR THEY NEED TO BE DOING MORE BEHIND THE SCENES WITH THEIR INCREDIBLY POWERFUL ALGORITHMS, WITH HUMAN MODERATORS TO BE PICKING UP ON THE STUFF. BUT EXPERTS ARE ALREADY RAISING A FLAG NOT JUST IN THESE RESURRECTIONS, BUT ALSO LOOKING FORWARD TO THINGS LIKE THE ELECTION. RIGHT NOW A LOT OF THESE VIDEOS HAVE THIS UNCANNY VALLEY FEELING. THEY ARE GOING TO GET MORE REALISTIC AND THE APPS ARE GOING TO NEED TO DO MORE TO DETECT THEM. ED: WELCOME BACK TO \"BLOOMBERG TECHNOLOGY.\" CAROLINE: AFTER HAVING THE BIGGEST SELLOFF IN MORE THAN A MONTH NOW, WE\u2019RE OFF BY MORE THAN A PERCENTAGE POINT. IS IT PROFIT TAKING AFTER THE RUNUP THAT WE\u2019VE HAD THROUGHOUT THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER? IS IT A LITTLE BIT OF CAUTION THAT\u2019S PERHAPS WE\u2019RE BAKING IN TOO MUCH? THE SELLOFF OF STOCKS AND THE SELLOFF OF BONDS AS WELL, THE TWO-YEAR YIELD SPIKING AS WELL. I\u2019M LOOKING AT IN SPITE OF THE SELLOFF IN RISK ASSETS, ONE STANDS OUT. BITCOIN POWERING UP, UP $42,000 AND WE\u2019RE STILL ON THE HIGH SIDE. YOU KNOW THE DRIVING FORCES. WE\u2019RE STILL TALKING ABOUT E.T.F., WILL WE GET, WHAT WE KNOW IS GOING TO COME NEXT YEAR, BUT WHAT WILL MACRO POLICY MEAN FOR BITCOIN INTO 2024? STILL ON THE HIGH SIDE. LET\u2019S LOOK AT SOME OF THE INDIVIDUAL MOVERS TODAY. UBER, THAT\u2019S WHAT\u2019S DRIVING IT HIGHER, UP 5% ON THE DIE. ACTUALLY YOU WANT ONLY FIELDS OF GREEN. LET\u2019S GO TO SOME OF THE LOSERS. SOME INSIDE SELLING HAPPENING. IN NVIDIA, 370,000 SHARES WERE EITHER SOLD OR FILED TO BE SOLD BY INTERNAL CANDIDATES, OF COURSE, EXECUTIVES AT THEIR COMPANY. SO IT\u2019S OFF BY 2.4% AFTER CAUSING A MASSIVE RUN FOR 2023. META, MARK ZUCKERBERG, FIRST TIME IN YEARS HE\u2019S SELLING HIS OWN SHARES. BUT WE\u2019VE GOT TO SOMETHING ELSE TO TALK ABOUT NEXT. ED: AND WE\u2019RE GOING PRIVATE THIS TIME. A NEW AUTONOMOUS AIR VEHICLE, ROAD RUNNER, IS AKIN TO A MINI REUSABLE FIGHTER JET THAT BLOWS UP DRONES, AND THE STARTUPLESS THE U.S. WILL DEPLOY IN THE FIELD NEXT YEAR. WE JUST SHOWED IMAGES OF IT. FROM A TECHNOLOGY PERSPECTIVE, YOU\u2019VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS IN SECRET FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS. WHAT IS NEW HERE? WHAT IS THE TECHNOLOGY AT PLAY? > > ROAD RUNNER IS AN A.I. PILOTED AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE. IT\u2019S POWERED BY TWO TWIN TURBO THRUST ENGINES, VERY, VERY FAST. CARRIES A SIGNIFICANT PAY LOAD. IT\u2019S VERY MANEUVERABILITY. BUT THE REALLY COOL THING ABOUT IT IS THAT IT CAN BE REUSED. IT\u2019S A VERTICAL TAKEOFF AND LANDING VEHICLE. THAT MEANS WITH CERTAIN PAY LOADS, YOU CAN GO OUT THERE, PERFORM THE MISSION, COME BACK, RELAND, AND THEN REFUEL, REARM, AND USE IT AGAIN. WITH OTHER PAY LOADS, LET\u2019S SAY A ONE-WAY WAR HEAD TO GO UP AGAINST A LARGE AIRCRAFT, I CAN SEND A WHOLE SWARM OF ROAD RUNNERS OUT THERE, AND ONLY THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY ENGAGE THE TARGET ARE CONSUMED. EVERYONE ELSE CAN COME HOME. THAT ALLOWS YOU TO HAVE MUCH GREATER EFFECTIVE MAGAZINE DEPTH AND TO USE THESE THINGS IN A WAY THAT YOU CAN\u2019T USE TRADITIONAL ONE-WAY MISSILES. ONCE YOU LAUNCH IT, IT\u2019S GONE. WHETHER YOU LAUNCH A BUNCH OF THEM OR ONE OF THEM. ED: WE SHARE WITH OUR AUDIENCE A STORY THAT THE U.S. PLANS TO PUT THIS TO DEPLOYMENT NEXT YEAR. SO MUCH OF THE NEWS FLOW AROUND DRONES HAS BEEN IN THE CONTEXT OF THE WAR IN UKRAINE. DRONES ARE A KEY STRATEGY FOR BOTH SIDES IT SEEMS. DO YOU SEE ROAD RUNNER BEING DEPLOYED IN UKRAINE IN THE NEAR TERM? WHAT KIND OF TALKS HAVE YOU HAD AROUND THAT? > > I SEE IT IN MY MIND\u2019S EYE. BUT WHETHER IT GOES THERE ISN\u2019T UP TO MITCHELL IT\u2019S UP TO A BUNCH OF PEOPLE IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. THE PROCESS IS GOVERNMENT-DRIVEN RATHER THAN COMPANY-DRIVEN, THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE TIME. WE\u2019VE BEEN IN UKRAINE SINCE THE SECOND WORK OF THE WAR, NOT JUST WITH OUR PRODUCTS, BUT SENDING PEOPLE OVER THERE. I WAS IN KYIV TO MEET WITH ZELENSKYY FOR THE SECOND TIME. I MET WITH HIM AHEAD OF THE WAR BECAUSE HE WAS INTERESTED IN PURCHASING SOME OF OUR SECURITY. UNFORTUNATELY THAT WASN\u2019T SOMETHING WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE HAPPEN BECAUSE OF THE RESTRICTIONS I MENTIONED EARLIER. IT\u2019S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE PERSONALLY. CAROLINE: WHAT ABOUT DEMAND FROM EUROPE? > > I MEAN, WE HAVE A LOT OF EUROPEAN CUSTOMERS. WE DO A LOT OF WORK IN PARTICULAR WITH THE UNITED KINGDOM AND U.K. ROYAL MARINES ESPECIALLY. BUT THERE\u2019S A LITTLE BIT OF A TRICKY DYNAMIC WITH SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES REALLY SEE THEIR DEFENSE APPARATUS AS A WAY TO RUN A JOBS PROGRAM, AND THEY ARE FORCING US, COMPANIES LIKE ANDURIL, TO COMPETE WITH THEIR OWN DOMESTIC CAPABILITIES. IT MIGHT BE YEARS HINTED OR MORE EXPENSIVE, BUT IT\u2019S HARD FOR THEM TO GET OVER THE FACT THAT THEY WOULD BE DROPPING THAT INTERNAL PROGRAM TO BUY SOMETHING FROM AN AMERICAN COMPANY. IT\u2019S A DIFFICULT PILL TO SWALLOW FOR SOME OF THE COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY ONES THAT DO HAVE WHAT ANYONE WOULD CONSIDER A PRETTY STRONG DEFENSE INDUSTRY OF THEIR OWN. CAROLINE: ONE COUNTRY THAT HAS A STRONG DEFENSE INDUSTRY OF THEIR OWN IS CHINA. YOU\u2019VE BEEN OUTSPOKEN ON THIS. WE\u2019VE HEARD NOT ONLY ABOUT CHINA\u2019S STRENGTH IN DEFENSE, BUT ALSO THEIR STRENGTH IN A.I. I\u2019M INTERESTED AS TO HOW MUCH THOSE CONVERSATIONS SURROUNDING TAIWAN, THE CONCERNS THERE, ARE BUILDING AND WHETHER OR NOT IT\u2019S ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE D.O.D. ABOUT. > > IT\u2019S ALL ABOUT THAT. EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THE CAPABILITIES THAT WE\u2019RE BUILDING TODAY ARE READY TO GO FOR A FIGHT IN THE PACIFIC IN 2027 OR EARLIER. BECAUSE THAT IS THE LATEST THAT WE SEE CHINA TRYING TO LAUNCH AN OFFENSIVE, FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, THAT\u2019S THE TIMING FOR SOME KIND OF ACTION AGAINST TAIWAN, WHICH IS CRITICAL TO OUR ECONOMY. THERE\u2019S A LOT OF PLACES AROUND THE WORLD WE CALL PARTNERS. THERE\u2019S A LOT OF PLACES WE SAY ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR INTERESTS. TAIWAN AND THEIR SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY IS AS IMPORTANT AS IT GETS, ESPECIALLY FOR SUCH A SMALL COUNTRY, SO CLOSE TO CHINA. THE GOOD NEWS IS PEOPLE ARE RECOGNIZING THIS THREAT. BIG TECH COMPANIES YEARS AGO THOUGHT THAT CHINA WAS SOMEONE THAT WAS GOING TO BE A HUGE GROWTH MARKET FOR THEM. THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO GET IN AND SELL THEM SOCIAL MEDIA, SELL THEM SERVICES. I THINK PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO REALIZE THAT\u2019S NOT WHAT\u2019S HAPPENING. THEY\u2019RE COMING HERE AND EATING OUR LUNCH. THAT IS, I THINK, POSITIVE FOR TECH COMPANIES\u2019 DECISIONS TO START WORKING WITH THE D.O.D. AGAIN. ED: THERE\u2019S AN INTENSE INTEREST IN ANDURIL. PEOPLE DON\u2019T KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT THE COMPANY F. WE TAKE THE KIND OF TAIWAN CASE STUDY, ROAD RUNNER ASIDE, WHAT ARE THE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT YOU CAN OFFER THAT YOU WOULD DEPLOY IN A HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIO LIKE THAT? > > OUR CORE PRODUCT IS SOMETHING CALLED LATTICE A.I. IT POWERS ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS. WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE WORKING ON SOFTWARE THAN HARDWARE, EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE OVER A DOZEN HARDWARE PRODUCTS. THAT\u2019S BECAUSE LATTICE IS SOMETHING, OUR SOFTWARE INVESTMENT IS SOMETHING WE CAN REACH ACROSS ALL THESE SYSTEMS. LATTICE A.I. IS INTEGRATED WITH MORE THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS THAN ANDURIL-MADE PRODUCTS. WE MAKE UNDERWATER VEHICLES LIKE THE DIVE SUBMARINE. WE MAKE ELECTRONIC WARFARE SYSTEMS, SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS, TACTICAL SYSTEMS LIKE THE GHOST HELICOPTER DRONE. WE\u2019VE GOT A LOT OF THINGS THAT COULD MAKE A REALLY BIG DIFFERENCE. AGAIN, EVERYTHING THAT WE\u2019RE DOING, AND MOST OF WHAT THE D.O.D. IS DOING IS PREPARING FOR A CONFLICT WITH A GREAT POWER LIKE CHINA IN THE PACIFIC ON A NEAR-TERM TIME FRAME. ANYTHING THAT WE MAKE TALLAHASSEE NOT GOING TO BE READY TO GO INTO THAT TYPE OF FIGHT, WHETHER LITTLE A BLOCKADE OR A REAL INVASION IS NOT SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS PARTICULARLY RELEVANT OR WORTH HEAVY INVESTMENT. ED: WHEN I POSTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA YOU WERE COMING ON THE SHOW, THE MOST COMMON QUESTION WAS ABOUT MANUFACTURING. IF YOU TAKE ROAD RUNNER AS AN EXAMPLE, THEY KNOW IT\u2019S A CUTTING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY. BUT THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU SCALE THE OUTPUT THAT HAVE PRODUCT. > > THERE\u2019S A FEW THINGS THAT GO INTO THAT. ANDURIL IS A DEFENSE PRODUCT COMPANY. WE USE OUR OWN MONEY TO DECIDE WHAT TO BUILD, HOW TO BUILD IT, AND THEN WE BUILD IT AND SELL IT WHEN IT\u2019S DONE. THAT\u2019S DIFFERENT THAN COMPANIES THAT GET PAID MORE WHEN THEY HAVE, LET\u2019S SAY, AN INEFFICIENT MANUFACTURING PROCESS OR LONGER MANUFACTURING PROCESS. BECAUSE THEY\u2019RE ON A COST PLUS CONTRACT. AND OUR HEAD OF MANUFACTURING COMES FROM TESLA, WHERE HE SCALED SEVERAL LINES TO VERY, VERY LARGE NUMBERS OF VEHICLES. WE HAVE A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE MAKING CONSUMER ELECTRONICS ON A VERY TIGHT SCHEDULE. WE\u2019VE DONE FIVE NEW REVISIONS OF CENTURY TOWER, FOUR NEW REVISIONS OF OUR GHOST DRONE IN JUST FIVE OR SIX YEARS. SO WE\u2019RE ON MORE OF A CONSUMER ELECTRONICS MANUFACTURING AND ITERATION CYCLE THAN ANY COMPANY WOULD BE. MY PREVIOUS COMPANY WAS OCULUS V.R. I STARTED THAT WHEN I WAS 19 YEARS OLD, SOLD IT TO FOOTBALL FOR A FEW BILLION DOLLARS. WAS THERE FOR A FEW YEARS BEFORE GETTING FIRED. WHILE I WAS THERE, WE MADE MILLION OF VIRTUALLY REALITY HEAD SETS IN CHINA. I KNOW HOW CHINA DOES THINGS. I KNOW HOW THESE THINGS CAN BE DONE. I\u2019M TRYING TO BRING A LITTLE BIT OF THAT CHINESE ENERGY HERE TO U.S. MANUFACTURING, ABSENT ALL THE STUFF THAT I HATE ABOUT CHINA. CAROLINE: JUST TO PUT PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT YOU CAN LEARN, PERHAPS YOU DISLIKE PARTS OF WHAT\u2019S EVIDENT. TO THAT POINT, EVERYONE IS CURRENTLY HAND WRINGING ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, U.S. VERSUS CHINA, CHINA VERSUS EVERYONE. YOU WERE JUST IN THE U.K. SAYING YOU\u2019VE BEEN BUILDING RELATIONSHIP THERE. WE THINK ABOUT THE U.K. A.I. SUMMIT. 31 COUNTRIES SIGNED UP TO SOME SORT OF GUARD RAILS WHEN IT COMES TO THE ACCELERATION OF DEPLOYMENT OF A.I. IN THE MILITARY. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THESE MOVES TO PUTTING GUARD RAILS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IF USED WITHIN MILITARY? > > A LOT OF THESE ARE DECADES BEHIND. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS FOR DECADES. IT BOTHERS ME WHEN PEOPLE SAY WE NEED TO COME ONE RULES THAT TELL THE D.O.D. WHAT TO DO. THEY HAVEN\u2019T BEEN THINKING ABOUT THESE THINGS. THEY DON\u2019T UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT AUTONOMOUS WEAPONS ARE. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN DEPLOYING AUTONOMOUS WEAPONS LIKE RADAR-SEEKING MISSILES FOR DECADES NOW. LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE A C-RAM, THE AUTOMATED GUNS PROTECTING OUR BASES AND SHIPS FROM INCOMING MORTAR FIRE, INCOMING MISSILE AND ROCKET FIRE. THOSE ARE AUTONOMOUS WEAPONS. THEY\u2019RE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT TO SHOOT DOWN AND WHAT TO NOT WITHOUT A PERSON MANUALLY DECIDING WHAT TO DO BEYOND DECIDING TO TURN ON THE SYSTEM AND ALOCAL LOU IT TO ENGAGE TARGETS PERIOD. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS VERY STRONG DOCTRINE AROUND THIS THAT REALLY BOILS DOWN TO MAKING SURE A HUMAN IS ALWAYS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DECISION. THAT DOESN\u2019T MEAN THAT THE PERSON IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PULLING THE TRIGGER. I HATE THIS IDEA, PEOPLE SAY CAN\u2019T AGREE THAT AN A.I. SHOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO DECIDE WHEN TO PULL THE TRIGGER. I DON\u2019T AGREE WITH THAT, BECAUSE I DON\u2019T THINK THERE\u2019S ANY MORAL HIGH GROUND IN MAKING A LANDMINE THAT CAN\u2019T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SCHOOL BUS FULL OF CHILDREN AND A RUSSIAN TANK COLUMN. I THINK IT IS GOOD FOR IT TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE WHEN TO PULL THE TRIGGER, AS LONG AS A PERSON IS TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT DEPLOYMENT AND WHATEVER GOES WRONG IN THE END. I\u2019D SAY A LOT IS PERFORM AACTIVE. THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT A.I. OR WEAPONS UNTIL VERY RECENTLY. THEY\u2019RE NOW DECLARING THEMSELVES TO BE A.I. SAFETY EXPERTS. THEY ARE DECADES BEHIND THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN WORKING ON AUTONOMOUS POLICY AND WEAPONS AND GUIDELINES. I THINK THE UNITED STATES IS CLEARLY FAR AND AWAY THE LEADER IN THIS SPACE. ED: I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT, WHEN I PUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA YOU WERE COMING ON THE SHOW, THERE WERE PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT DON\u2019T AGREE WITH THE USE OF ANY TECHNOLOGY IN THE CONTEXT OF WAR. BECAUSE THEY DON\u2019T WANT ANY CONSIDERATION OF WAR. THEY BELIEVE IN PEACE, FRANKLY. IT WOULD BE REMISS OF ME NOT TO ASK YOU AS WELL ABOUT OCULUS. YOU MENTIONED IT. I THINK WE\u2019RE ALMOST AT THE 10-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THEN FACEBOOK ACQUIRING YOUR COMPANY, OCULUS. OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS, WHERE HAVE WE LANDED IN V.R. AND A.R.? THIS YEAR WE HAD MET AQUEST AND VISION FROM APPLE. GIVE ME YOUR ASSESSMENT OF THE TECHNOLOGY FIELD FOR HEAD SETS. > > THE PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT WE SHOULDN\u2019T BE USING TECH IN ANY OF THE STUFF, I\u2019D SAY LET\u2019S ARM NATO WITH STICKS AND STONES AND SEE HOW IT GOES. V.R., I\u2019M REALLY EXCITED WITH HOW IT\u2019S GOING. I AM HAPPY TO SEE A LOT OF MY DEEPLY HELD TECHNICAL BELIEFS PLAYING OUT IN THE MARKET. ONE EXAMPLE IS THE APPLE VISION PRO BEING KIND OF AN AUGMENT THE REALITY, MIXED REALITY COMBO HEAD SET THAT IS DOING A FULL PROJECTION OF THE WORLD. IT IS USING ALL NEW PPHOTONS TO PROJECT IN YOUR EYES. I\u2019VE ALWAYS BEEN ON THE HARD A.R. FULL SIDE. HAPPY TO SEE THAT KIND OF PANNING OUT WITH APPLE. I\u2019VE USE WANTED THE NEW APPLE HEAD SET. IT\u2019S AMAZING. PROBABLY THE BEST ACCOMPLISHMENT THAT I\u2019VE DONE ON THE V.R. SIDE WAS MAKING SURE THAT V.R. CAME BACK FROM THE DEAD AND IS NOW SOMETHING THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE WORKING ON. FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, I\u2019M GOING BUY REALLY NICE HEAD SETS WITHOUT HAVING TO DO IT MYSELF, WHICH IS WHAT I WAS DOING WHEN I WAS 15 AND 16 STARTING OCULUS. ED: GOOD TO CATCH YOU. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US HERE ON BLOOMBERG TECHNOLOGY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. COMING UP ON THE SHOW, THE CRYPTO RALLY GATHERED STEAM AS BITCOIN TOPS $42,000 U.S. WE\u2019RE GOING TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION GOING AND DISCUSS INVESTING IN THE DIGITAL CURRENCY ECOSYSTEM MORE BROADLY. THAT\u2019S THE SPOTLIGHT NEXT. CAROLINE: BITCOIN, IF YOU HADN\u2019T NOTICED, HAS SURGED PAST $42,000 AGAIN, EXTENDING THE RALLY TO MORE THAN 150% SO FAR THIS YEAR. FAR OUTPACING STOCKS AND OTHER RISK ASSETS. WE\u2019RE GOING TO BE INVESTING AND LOOKING AT THE RETURN OF DIGITAL CURRENCY ECOSYSTEM AND THE STARTUPS WITHIN IT. MORGAN IS WITH US. YOU INVEST IN A WHOLE BROAD REMITT OF COMPANIES. WHAT WE LOVE IS YOUR BACKGROUND AND THE FACT YOU WERE THERE BUILDING ONE OF THE FIRST STABLE COINS. YOU INVEST IN COMPANIES SUCH AS RAMP, WHICH IS ABOUT FEAR AND CRYPTO. THIS EXUBERANCE SEEMS TO BE ABOUT INSTITUTIONAL ACCESS, WHETHER OR NOT WE GET A BITCOIN E.T.F. WHERE DO YOU THINK THAT REALLY WORKS FOR THE ECOSYSTEM AT LARGE? > > THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING ME. SEEING THIS TURN IS EXCITING, ALTHOUGH I\u2019M CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC. I THINK THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL, LIKE SCHROEDER\u2019S CATS, IS IT DEAD, IS IT ALIVE? AND I THINK WE\u2019RE TURNING A CORNER, KNOCK ON ALL THE WOOD THAT IT MIGHT FINALLY ACTUALLY BE HAPPENING, WHICH WOULD BE HUGE, IF NOT THE LARGEST IMPACT THAT COULD BE HAD ON INSTITUTIONAL ADOPTION. AND THE SECOND CAT WAS FINANCE. PEOPLE WERE WORRIED ABOUT BINANCE, WHAT WAS AND WASN\u2019T GOING TO HAPPEN. WHAT I THINK WE SAW HAPPEN A FEW WEEKS AGO WAS MINIMAL IMPACT ON THE SPACE. I THINK THOSE ARE TWO HUGE UNKNOWNS THAT I THINK ARE NOW BECOMING KNOWN IN A POSITIVE WAY. SO THAT\u2019S EXCITING FOR THE SPACE. ED: CAROLINE AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW WHEN BITCOIN GOES UP, PUBLICLY TRADELY, CRYPTO-RELATED STOCKS ALSO GO UP, EITHER BECAUSE IT\u2019S A PROXY FOR EXPOSURE IF YOU\u2019RE NOT INVESTED IN A DIGITAL CURRENCY. OR IT\u2019S A LOGIC IF BITCOIN IS DOING WELL, THAT\u2019S THE THING THAT UNDERPINS ALL OF THOSE COMPANIES SO THEY DO WELL AS WELL. SPIN THAT FORWARD TO THE V.C. CONTEXT. IS BITCOIN BEING UP GOOD FOR YOU WHEN YOU DECIDE TO INVEST HERE, HERE OR THERE? > > I LIKE THAT I STAY SOBER ENOUGH THAT IT DOESN\u2019T MATTER, BUT IN REALITY IT PROBABLY DOES AFFECT MINE AND OTHERS\u2019 PSYCHES. I THINK I\u2019VE SAID IT BEFORE, BUT FOR ME THERE\u2019S ALWAYS THREE QUESTIONS, WHICH IS ONE, IS IT COMPANY SOLVING A PROBLEM FOR ANYONE? TWO, IS ANYONE USING THIS THING? AND THREE, IS THIS PRODUCT OR COMPANY MAKING MONEY OR HAS ANY POTENTIAL TO MAKE MONEY? AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF CRYPTO AND CRYPTO STARTUPS, THERE\u2019S VERY FEW THAT ACTUALLY CHECK ALL THREE OF THOSE BOXES, LET ALONE ONE OR TWO. AND BITCOIN IS ONE OF THE FEW CASES THAT CHECKS ALL THE BOXES AND IS REAL. IT\u2019S DEFINITELY A CASE STUDY FOR POTENTIALLY OTHER INVESTMENTS. BUT AT THE OTHER STAGE, I TRY TO NOT LOOK AT THE PRICE OF BITCOIN. CAROLINE: WHAT YOU LOOK AT IS PROBABLY THE GENERAL ENERGY OF BUILDING IN THE SEED STAGE RIGHT NOW. TO THAT END, AMID WHAT HAS BEEN TERMED YET ANOTHER CRYPTO WINTER, HAS THE BUILDING STILL BEEN GOING? ARE THERE PROBLEMS BEING SOLVED WHEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT PRICES AND ACTUALLY LOOK AT WHAT FUNDAMENTALLY IS BEING BUILT? > > BUILDING IS STILL GOING. WHEN THE MARKET WAS NUTS, YOU HAD WHAT MY PARTNER JAMES CALLED THE FRUIT FLIES COMING IN, SO THE FOUNDERS WHO THOUGHT IT WAS JUST LIKE THE SEXIEST ACCESSORY TO HAVE A CRYPTO COMPANY AND THOUGHT OVERNIGHT THEY WOULD BE WORTH A LOT ON PAPER. AND WHAT THE MARKET COOLING DOWN, IS FILTERED THE FOUNDERS OUT. NOW YOU ONLY HAVE FOUNDERS COMING IN WHO ACTUALLY HAVE A PROBLEM TO SOLVE. IN A WEIRD WAY, THE BEAR MARKET IS VERY NICE, BECAUSE IT AUTOMATICALLY APPLIES A FILTER, AT LEAST TO THE TOP OF THE FUNNEL STARTUPS. THAT ISN\u2019T NECESSARILY THERE IN A BULL MARKET.

With historical trends of post-bear market bull cycles and upcoming Bitcoin halving events as a backdrop, projections place Bitcoin at over $60,000 by April next year and as high as $125,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nRelated: BTC price models hint at $130K target after 2024 Bitcoin halving\n\nSuch predictions rest on the historic pattern of price increases preceding halving events, with an expected surge of over 200%.\n\n\"On the eve of a spot Bitcoin ETF\"\n\nThe speculative winds are further fanned by the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States.\n\nWith 13 bidders, including industry giants like BlackRock and Grayscale, the anticipation is building toward a decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nBloomberg\u2019s ETF analysts see a high probability of simultaneous approvals for all pending bids by Jan. 10, which would mark not only a new era of institutional participation and investment in Bitcoin, but likely a boost for BTC price as well.\n\n\u201cIt's very likely we are on the eve of a Bitcoin spot ETF,\u201d commented Bitcoin analyst Willy Woo on X about the new highs in gold price. \u201cThe first commodity ETF was SPDR Gold Trust. It provided a simple way for investors to access gold in their portfolio.\u201d\n\nWoo added:\n\n\u201cWhen it launched, gold went on to an 8-year rally with no single down year between 2005 - 2012.\u201d\n\nTherefore, Bitcoin's latest move above the psychological $40,000 level reflects bullish market sentiment fueled by the likely approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in January and the prospect of regulatory advancements in general. Bitcoin's halving event, meanwhile, is only expected to provide additional tailwinds for BTC price over the next five months.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "The United States needs to formally investigate using proof-of-work networks such as Bitcoin (BTC) to protect the country from cyber-inflicted warfare, according to Jason Lowery, a member of the United States Space Force.\n\nIn a four-page letter to the U.S. Defense Innovation Board on Dec. 2, Lowery explained that while Bitcoin is mostly seen as a \u201cmonetary system\u201d to secure funds, few know that Bitcoin can be used to secure \u201call forms of data, messages or command signals.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a result, this misconception underplays the technology\u2019s broad strategic significance for cybersecurity, and consequently, national security.\u201d\n\nThe Defense Innovation Board is an independent advisory board set up to bring the technological innovation and best practices of Silicon Valley to the U.S. Military. Lowery used the letter to urge the board to advise the Secretary of Defense to investigate the \"national strategic importance\" of PoW systems like Bitcoin.\n\nLowery used the letter to urge the board to advise the Secretary of Defense to investigate the \"national strategic importance\u201d of PoW systems like Bitcoin.\n\nIn his letter, Lowery explained that a proof-of-work system like Bitcoin could work to deter adversaries from cyberattacks due to the \u201csteep costs\u201d of a physically resource-intensive computer in the same way military assets help to deter military attacks against the country.\n\n\u201cProof-of-work mirrors the physical security and deterrence strategies utilized in other domains like land, sea, air, and space,\u201d but instead, it does it in the digital domain, Lowery explained.\n\nBREAKING: US Space Force Major, Jason Lowery sends open letter about #Bitcoin to DOD\u2019s Defense Innovation Board.\n\n\n\n\u201cI contend that reusable proof-of-work networks like #Bitcoin represent an offset strategy for the 21st century.\u201d pic.twitter.com/qiLZ71S5MN \u2014 Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) December 3, 2023\n\nBitcoin\u2019s potential cybersecurity applications are huge, according to Lowery, and could play an important role in the U.S. maintaining its position as the world leader.\n\n\u201cAddressing this could be vital for the US to maintain its positions as a global superpower and leader among nations, especially in an increasingly digital and interconnected world plagued by security vulnerabilities.\u201d\n\nLowery says it has the potential to kickstart the \u201ccybersecurity revolution\u201d too.\n\n\u201c[It is] the beginning of a cybersecurity revolution. It converts the global electric power grid into a large, physically costly computer, or \u2018macrochip,\u2019 and uses it to physically constrain malicious actors and safeguard a wide range of data and messages traversing the internet.\u201d\n\nLowery concluded Bitcoin\u2019s cybersecurity application aligns \u201cperfectly with a strategic offset\u201d and that the U.S. Department of Defense may have already \u201clost valuable time\u201d by not implementing it into its arsenal.\n\nLowery is also a national defense fellow at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and previously proposed a cybersecurity tool on the Bitcoin base layer in March, which he claims is capable of transforming the country\u2019s national security.\n\nBitcoin \u201cbest defender\u201d of U.S. interests: Coinbase CEO\n\nMeanwhile, in a separate thread on X, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong argued that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies could play a pivotal role in helping the United States maintain its dominance with the U.S. dollar, according to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.\n\n\u201cOne idea I\u2019ve been contemplating is that Bitcoin may be the key to extending western civilization,\u201d said Armstrong in a Dec. 3 post, explaining that cryptocurrencies can work in tandem with the U.S. dollar instead of dethroning it.\n\n\u201cI think it will be a natural check and balance that will complement the dollar and be the best defender of long term American interests,\u201d Armstrong added.\n\nOne idea I\u2019ve been contemplating is that Bitcoin may be the key to extending western civilization.\n\n\n\nThe natural trend of whichever country has the reserve currency is to inflate the money supply and increase deficit spending until it loses that advantage. The U.S. is somewhere on\u2026 \u2014 Brian Armstrong \ufe0f (@brian_armstrong) December 3, 2023\n\nHe explained that world leaders often fail to retain the reserve currency by inflating its money supply and increasing its deficit spending.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is somewhere on this journey,\u201d Armstrong explained but stressed the Chinese yuan and Euro aren\u2019t viable alternatives at the moment as they have issues of their own.\n\nRelated: US Senate approves national defense bill that also targets crypto mixers\n\nInstead, cryptocurrencies have the potential to be the alternative currency in the event of a U.S. dollar downfall:\n\n\u201cWhat I think many haven\u2019t considered is that people have an alternative now with crypto. They may start moving fiat into crypto, as an antidote to inflation.\u201d\n\nArmstrong stressed it\u2019s better to move from dollars to cryptocurrencies than another country\u2019s fiat currency if the U.S. dollar loses its dominance.\n\nHe added that U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins like USD Coin (USDC) and the emergence of flat coins will play a \u201cmajor role in unifying these worlds.\u201d\n\nMagazine: Big Questions: Did the NSA create Bitcoin?"

        "content": "Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, surged past the $42,000 mark for the first time since April 2022. This represents a year-over-year increase of 142% in the cryptocurrency value. The milestone came on the back of broad enthusiasm about U.S. interest rate cuts and the imminent regulatory approval for Bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\n\nThe solid trading has spread to the ETF world as well. While most of the ETFs have returned handsomely, a few have more than doubled so far this year. These include Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF WGMI, Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF BITQ, Blockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF BITS, First Trust SkyBridge Crypto Industry & Digital Economy ETF CRPT and iShares Blockchain and Tech ETF IBLC.\n\n\n\nInvestors' growing belief that the Federal Reserve will halt rate hikes amid cooling inflation is turning attention to potential rate cuts in the upcoming year. The move could push the Bitcoin rally to $44,000 before the spot Bitcoin ETF approval. According to CME\u2019s FedWatch tool, traders are now pricing in a 70% chance for a rate cut by the U.S. central bank by next March (read: 5 ETFs Set to Gain as Inflation Cools Down).\n\n\n\nThe crypto industry is keenly awaiting the SEC's decision on applications for the first U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, with firms like BlackRock Inc. in the forefront. Bloomberg Intelligence suggests that a series of these products could receive approval by January 2024. Such a development would not only legitimize Bitcoin in the eyes of mainstream investors but also provide a more accessible avenue for investment, thereby potentially attracting a fresh influx of capital into the crypto market.\n\n\n\nThe combination of factors has rekindled interest in the crypto market, signaling positive sentiment among retail and institutional investors. With expectations of interest rate cuts and greater demand from ETFs, most traders anticipate the rally to continue, betting on bitcoin\u2019s eventual rise to $45,000 by the end of March 2024.\n\n\n\nBitcoin's performance in 2023 has outpaced other assets like global stocks and gold. The derivative market has also seen significant interest, with record levels of open interest in Bitcoin futures and options. Additionally, the upcoming Bitcoin halving, which reduces the reward for Bitcoin mining and caps the supply, historically leads to price increases.\n\nStory continues\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI) \u2013 Up 181.9%\n\n\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF is an actively managed ETF that will invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus borrowings for investment purposes) in securities of companies that derive at least 50% of their revenues or profits from bitcoin mining operations, and from providing specialized chips, hardware and software or other services to companies engaged in bitcoin mining. Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF holds 22 stocks in its basket, with a double-digit concentration on the top four firms.\n\n\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF has amassed $25.7 million in its asset base, while trading in an average daily volume of 161,000 shares. It charges 75 bps in annual fees.\n\n\n\nBitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ) \u2013 Up 164.3%\n\n\n\nBitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF helps investors capitalize on the wave of innovation. It tracks the Bitwise Crypto Innovators 30 Index, which measures the performance of the companies involved in servicing the cryptocurrency markets, including crypto mining firms, crypto mining equipment suppliers, crypto financial services companies, or other financial institutions servicing primarily crypto-related clientele (read: Bitcoin Up Triple-Digits This Year: ETFs in Focus).\n\n\n\nHolding 29 stocks in its basket, Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF is concentrated on the top three firms. It charges 85 bps in annual fees from investors and trades in an average daily volume of 93,000 shares. Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF has attracted $102.2 million in its asset base.\n\n\n\nBlockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITS) \u2013 Up 153.3%\n\n\n\nBlockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF is an actively managed fund that seeks to capture the long-term growth potential of the blockchain and digital asset theme. It takes long positions in U.S. listed bitcoin futures contracts and invests, directly and indirectly, in companies positioned to benefit from the increased adoption of blockchain technology. Blockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF will not invest directly in Bitcoin. It currently delivers exposure to blockchain companies through other ETFs, including the affiliated Global X Blockchain ETF.\n\n\n\nBlockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF has attracted $16.4 million in its asset base.

        "content": "00:00\n\nIt's about the move in bitcoin. Having a look at 42 k. Hi John. It did hit 42,000, which is the highest level since April 2022, but now it's pared back some of those gains but still up it's now at around 41,500. And of course this enthusiasm is really fuelled by the speculation that the US FCC will approve a spot Bitcoin ETF by next year and that includes from the likes of BlackRock. And of course if the Fed is done hiking interest rates. So the last time this level was seen was around April 2022 when we saw the collapse of the US, the STABLECOIN. And if this rally holds, this will be the biggest yearly gain for Bitcoin since 2020. So it's going to be three years since then. And while 42,000 is a big round number, crypto investors are happy. It's still a far cry from the nearly 69,000 all time high that we've seen a few years back. We're still around 39% from there. And if you look at Bitcoin's weekly relative strength index, so that's a momentum gauge. Bitcoin is hovering around overbought levels. So we'll see if this rally holds. But across the board, it's a green on the screen for the crypto universe. We have Bitcoin up ether up, Dogecoin also up and Bitcoin cash. And of course that's really banking on the fact that there's a cross at a rally gold this up and even assets and money market funds are also up John."

The world's largest cryptocurrency was lifted by hopes of approval for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund and growing bets on U.S. interest rate cuts. Spot gold prices touched $2,100 an ounce, hitting a record high as investors rushed into the safe-haven asset.\n\nWall Street catches a breath\n\nU.S. stocks markets slipped Monday, with investors questioning if markets climbed too fast, too soon following five straight weeks of gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched 0.11% at close. The S&P 500 dropped 0.54% and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.84% amid a Big Tech shares selloff.

The price of bitcoin has jumped to a 20-month high of $42,000 amid expectation of the imminent launch of US exchange traded funds directly tracking the world\u2019s largest digital token.\n\nThe mania has spread to a host of private trusts operated by Grayscale. The company\u2019s Filecoin Trust is trading at $34.25, 721 per cent above its net asset value of $4.17, having hit a premium of more than 1,000 per cent in November.\n\nIts trust tracking solana, the third-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin and ether, is at a premium of 302 per cent, while those investing in chainlink, livepeer, lumens and Decentraland\u2019s mana token are priced at between twice and four times their NAV.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absurd. I feel the investor doesn\u2019t really understand what they are getting into,\u201d said Bradley Duke, chief strategist of ETC Group, which runs more than $1bn in European-listed crypto exchange traded products.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know what [investors] could be thinking buying at these prices,\u201d said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research, North America, at Morningstar. \u201cA lack of understanding can easily be part of it.\u201d\n\nThe funds can only be traded via OTC Markets Group, formerly known as the \u201cpink sheets\u201d market, where over-the-counter secondary trading in pre-existing shares takes place. Shares cannot be redeemed, while new shares can only be created if Grayscale carries out a private placement exercise, meaning there is no arbitrage mechanism to bring prices back in line with the underlying holdings.\n\nHowever, most of the premiums only emerged, or widened sharply, in November, coinciding with a rally in the price of many cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cThere is a very strong appetite for crypto products at the moment as the crypto winter has melted. Investors are allocating to crypto in larger allocations and also diversifying from bitcoin and ethereum,\u201d said Michael Sonnenshein, chief executive of Grayscale.\n\nHe believed some investors may be willing to pay well over the odds for Grayscale\u2019s trusts in order to access cryptocurrencies \u201cthrough a product wrapper that is known to them, is familiar and gives them added protections that they are used to seeing when they invest in any other asset\u201d. The alternative is to trade via an unregulated crypto exchange.\n\nFor many of these tokens, Grayscale\u2019s funds are the only regulated products available to US retail investors.\n\n\u201cBecause there are so few regulated products out there, the investors who don\u2019t want to, or can\u2019t, invest directly in these assets have little choice,\u201d said Duke. \u201cAs a result, these products end up trading at these huge premiums. It\u2019s a function of the structure of the products.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s down to accessibility,\u201d said Armour, although he added that cryptocurrencies \u201chave such high volatility it might be [that investors] don\u2019t even care\u201d at what price they are buying.\n\nAnother contributory factor may be limited liquidity, given the small size of some of the trusts. The Filecoin Trust has assets of just $464,000 and the solana vehicle, the largest currently trading at a significant premium, at $10.8mn.\n\n\u201cThese are fairly illiquid products and, as solana spot has seen, these illiquid products are seen as proxies by those who can\u2019t buy solana directly in their funds or prefer not to,\u201d said Gautam Chhugani, senior analyst, global digital assets at AB Bernstein.\n\nDuke argued that the large departures from net asset value showed the benefit of the European model. According to this, in contrast, scores of exchange traded products that invest directly in a rich array of cryptocurrencies \u2014 including those operated by ETC Group \u2014 \u201ctrack the underlying almost perfectly\u201d.\n\nThey are analogous to ETFs in the US but need to call themselves ETPs because they fail to meet European Ucits regulations on portfolio diversification.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has so far not permitted any such \u201cspot\u201d cryptocurrency ETFs in the US. Instead it only allows ETFs that invest in the futures market. Expectation is widespread that BlackRock and rival operators will be given the green light early next year.\n\n\u201cWithout regulated products these kinds of [price] anomalies are likely to exist,\u201d Duke said. \u201cI think we are very lucky in Europe . . . the ETP wrapper is far more efficient with the ETPs trading at or very close to NAV.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, the US private trust structure \u201cis problematic. And Grayscale recognise it\u2019s problematic,\u201d he added.\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit the ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools helping you to understand everything from performance to ESG ratings\n\nGrayscale has fought a long battle with the SEC to allow it to convert its flagship Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), at $24.1bn the world\u2019s largest bitcoin fund, into an ETF. In August, a federal appeals court in Washington DC ruled that the SEC was wrong to reject Grayscale\u2019s application to convert GBTC.\n\nAlthough this trust still trades at a discount to NAV, this discount has narrowed to a 28-month low of 8.7 per cent \u2014 from a nadir of almost 50 per cent in December 2022 \u2014 in anticipation of the likelihood of Grayscale being given the go-ahead to convert it into an ETF.\n\nThe company has also filed with the SEC to transform its $6.2bn Ethereum Trust (ETHE), again the largest such vehicle in the world, into an ETF. This trades at a discount of 14.6 per cent, a far cry from the near-60 per cent level seen at the turn of the year.\n\nSonnenshein said that, in the fullness of time, he would like to see the rest of Grayscale\u2019s 17-strong product suite follow suit. \u201cThe goal would be to uplift all these products to ETFs,\u201d he said."

        "title": "Too Fast, Too Furious? Cryptocurrency as Legal Tender | Royal United Services Institute - RUSI Analysis",
        "content": "Currently, only a handful of countries have decided to adopt cryptocurrency as a legal tender, most prominently among them El Salvador and the Central African Republic (CAR). While attracted by the potential economic and monetary incentives that this move has to offer, both countries have faced significant implementation challenges, threatening to undermine their objectives and any foreseeable economic benefits.\n\nAs more countries \u2013 and developing economies in particular \u2013 have begun to consider integrating cryptocurrency into their national financial systems, these experiments highlight that adopting cryptocurrency as a national legal tender necessitates a certain level of preparedness, including appropriate infrastructure, public education, building trust and \u2013 last but not least \u2013 the establishment of robust financial crime prevention measures.\n\nTwo Routes\n\nWhile El Salvador and the CAR sought to adopt cryptocurrency for similar reasons, their national experiences have been quite different.\n\nEl Salvador took the step of adopting Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, with the goal of increasing investment and assisting citizens that lack access to traditional financial services. Initially, to integrate Bitcoin into its economy, the country contracted third-party companies to develop centralised cryptocurrency wallets known as \u2018Chivo Wallets\u2019 and cryptocurrency ATMs. This government-funded project allows citizens to transfer funds quickly through the use of the \u2018lightning network\u2019 \u2013 a solution that increased the speed of Bitcoin transactions \u2013 and without commission fees.\n\nThe CAR moved to adopt Bitcoin in April 2022, but the government reversed its decision when the Constitutional Court declared the proposal unlawful a month after it was introduced. After this reversal, the government took a different route and created a partially Bitcoin-backed cryptocurrency, known as the Sango Coin, to be introduced in phases. The first phase would allow the public to buy into the crypto-backed currency, while the subsequent phases would allow the use of the currency for certain government services, like purchasing citizenship, e-residency and land. The CAR\u2019s Constitutional Court ultimately rejected a scheme that would have allowed foreign investors to acquire citizenship for $60,000 worth of Sango Coins or a 250 square metre plot for $10,000 worth of Sango Coins, ruling that nationality cannot be priced in a market and that residency requires physical presence in the country.\n\nAt the onset of the project, the coin also promoted the tokenisation of natural resources within the country. Despite the project not initially gaining traction, as of July 2023, the CAR National Assembly revisited the concept and passed a law allowing the tokenisation of land and natural resources.\n\nSame Motives, Different Challenges?\n\nThe countries\u2019 respective political leaders generally cited the potential economic benefits as their underlying rationale for promoting cryptocurrency as a national legal tender. Both countries regard this as an innovative solution to economic stagnation, poor revenue and foreign direct investment, and a reliance on third country-backed currencies. In the CAR, for example, its national currency \u2013 the CFA Franc \u2013 is backed by France and pegged to the Euro, with several restrictions in place, such as keeping 50% of the CAR\u2019s foreign assets with the French Treasury. Some saw the CAR\u2019s interest in cryptocurrencies as a political move away from France in an effort to lessen reliance."

        "content": "Crypto fund inflows at asset managers such as CoinShares, Bitwise, Grayscale, ProShares and 21Shares added $176 million last week, reaching a 10-week streak of $1.76 billion, according to CoinShares\u2019 latest report.\n\nThe run represents the largest since U.S. futures-based bitcoin ETF products launched in October 2021 and is equivalent to 4% of the current $46.2 billion worth of assets under management, CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill said.\n\nTrading volumes also remained high at $2.6 billion last week, representing 12% of total bitcoin volume, Butterfill added. However, although assets under management have risen over 100% for the year, they remain 47% below the all-time high of $86.6 billion in 2021.\n\nRegionally, Canada, Germany and the U.S. accounted for the most substantial inflows, adding $79 million, $57 million and $54 million, respectively.

        "title": "With Bitcoin and Gold Prices Rising, Wall Street Gets Greedy - New York Magazine",
        "content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nThe past five weeks were great ones on Wall Street. Since the end of October, the Dow Jones Industrial Average went on a furious rally, climbing more than 11 percent. The bond markets \u2014 which, for much of the year, had been reflecting a darker image of the economy \u2014 gave up much of their pessimism about inflation and went on a frolic of their own. The thinking behind all this was that, finally, the Federal Reserve would start cutting interest rates soon, and it was better to buy, buy, buy just about everything that could be gotten before it was too late. But on Monday, with stocks faltering and bond markets starting to backtrack, the rally didn\u2019t so much fizzle out as move elsewhere: to bitcoin and gold. The daily fluctuations at this point probably aren\u2019t that important \u2014 what matters is that investors seem to be choosing to send as many assets as they can higher and higher: an all-of-the-above holiday rally to finally close out two years of economic misery. On Wall Street, it looks as though it\u2019s finally \u2014 finally! \u2014 time to get greedy again.\n\nOn Monday, bitcoin touched $42,000, a price it hadn\u2019t seen since the early stages of the crypto collapse in the spring of 2022. At the same time, an ounce of gold reached $2,100 \u2014 an all-time high. But why? As much as these two assets tend to be prized by an overlapping group of people who tend to worry about things like inflation and national debt and de-dollarization, the digital currency also tends to rise when speculation is rampant. For its part, gold is prized when there\u2019s chaos, fear, and geopolitical turmoil \u2014 and there\u2019s a bit of that happening right now.\n\nThe bitcoin rally is something of a fluke of timing. For the past year, the industry has been under a pall caused by last year\u2019s calamitous blowups of FTX, Three Arrows Capital, and the many, many frauds that came to define the market. But the past few months have been something of a cleansing. Sam Bankman-Fried saw a swift conviction on seven counts of fraud, and Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to failing to prevent money laundering on his industry-leading exchange, Binance. Even the Winklevoss twins are fighting fraud charges against their exchange, Gemini. At around the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commission plotzed when it came to preventing a bitcoin exchange-traded fund \u2014 an investment that would make it easier for anyone to invest in the digital currency, from institutions to their 401(k) savers. To the crypto world, it feels like the bear market is over, or just about. The entire market is up to $1.6 trillion, about 50 percent higher than it was just a few months ago.\n\nAll that should make for a pretty optimistic time in crypto land, but what\u2019s really adding gasoline to the speculation for everything from bitcoin to ten-year treasury bonds (which have seen a face-melting rally of their own in recent weeks) is the Fed. Jerome Powell, the central bank\u2019s chairman, has recently failed to convince Wall Street that he will do anything but start cutting interest rates next year, likely beginning in March. And as the industry learned the hard way last year, interest rates appear to have a very direct relationship with the price of digital currencies: When money gets tight, people tend to sell their crypto and drop the speculative mania. But if rates are going to start falling soon, the opposite could very well be in the offing. As crypto journalist David Z. Morris pointed out, that could even bring back some of the bizarro-land shitcoin zaniness that defined the pandemic-era bubble.\n\nHope you guys enjoyed chilling, once we cross $40k the normies will be back and things will get stupid and mostly bad again. If history teaches us anything, the enforcement actions of the past two years will mean exactly nothing because a whole new crop of morons will arrive. \u2014 David Z. Morris (d/acc) (@davidzmorris) December 3, 2023\n\nThis widely held view that the Fed is about to start cutting rates is also helping to drive the rise in gold prices. When the Fed starts cutting, the markets expect the value of the dollar to fall against other currencies \u2014 including gold. (Central banks own about 35,000 tons of gold, or about a fifth of the world\u2019s total supply, according to the World Gold Council. Countries use the metal to help back the value of their currencies.) As the expectations of the Fed cutting rates became more widespread, the value of the dollar fell. What this means is that currency investors will likely start selling dollars rather than hoarding them to pay for things like oil or grain, and that could trigger further weakening in the currency. In other words, the absolute dominance of the U.S. dollar has made it increasingly valuable around the globe as rates shot up \u2014 and could have the opposite effect on the way down.\n\nOf course, none of these things happen in a straight line. Later on Monday, the value of the dollar ticked up again, and gold fell a bit from its highs. But the dip was read by many observers as just standard volatility in the markets. \u201cInvestors are basically just digesting some of the recent gains,\u201d Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, told CNBC. In other words, Wall Street is trying to make a nice profit before traders close their desks for the year and go on an extended ski vacation in the Alps.\n\nFor all the bulls in equities, gold and crypto who have all had a very good year\n\n\ud83d\ude05\u270c\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/NSTb0qlaLy \u2014 Santiago Capital (@SantiagoAuFund) December 3, 2023"

This greater regulatory scrutiny is seemingly appealing to investors who are piling into the likes of Bitcoin. \u201cIt would also be attractive to institutional investors who bring with them huge amounts of capital.\u201d\n\nIn addition to regulatory approval and a clearing of the market, another key factor driving investor confidence is an upcoming halving event.\n\nHalving expected\n\nScarcity is a key monetary policy of Bitcoin, with the total number of Bitcoins that can ever exist capped at 21 million. The rate of issuance of total circulating Bitcoins is designed to decrease over time.\n\nEarly miners of Bitcoin were rewarded with 50 Bitcoins for each block they mined, however, this reward is decreased by half approximately every four years.\n\nHistorically, the lead-up time to a halving event is the most profitable time for crypto investors; the next halving event is expected to occur in April 2024.\n\nAs of 11:45 GMT Bitcoin is trading at $41,609.30\n\nLead image: fabrikasimf"

        "content": "Bitcoin spot ETF has been approved outside the US, but the SEC is yet to approve one in the country. After BlackRock filed for a Bitcoin spot ETF on June 15, the interest surrounding crypto ETFs has been renewed. Grayscale \u2013 whose application for a Bitcoin spot ETF was initially rejected by the SEC \u2013 got a victory in court, forcing the US regulator to review its proposal again. The SEC\u2019s loss in this lawsuit has fueled hopes that a Bitcoin spot ETF might be approved by the end of the year.\n\nYes. The first Bitcoin futures ETF in the US was approved by the US Securities & Exchange Commission in October 2021. A total of seven Bitcoin futures ETFs have been approved, with more than 20 still waiting for the regulator\u2019s permission. The SEC says that the cryptocurrency industry is new and subject to manipulation, which is why it has been delaying crypto-related futures ETFs for the last few years.\n\nAn Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is an investment vehicle or an index that tracks the price of an underlying asset. ETFs can not only track a single asset, but a group of assets and sectors. For example, a Bitcoin ETF tracks Bitcoin\u2019s price. ETF is a tool used by investors to gain exposure to a certain asset.\n\nCrypto analyst @Pentosh1\u2019s prediction supports @rektcapital. The analyst has identified the $40,000 to $42,000 level as the most important one for Bitcoin, marking it as range highs in the ongoing cycle. The analyst believes $36,300 is the mid resistance level and BTC price could find support between $31,000 and $32,500.\n\nCrypto analyst behind the X handle @rektcapital evaluated the Bitcoin price trend and predicted that BTC price could revisit the $45,000 level prior to the fourth halving event, scheduled for April 2024. The analyst notes the trend that repeated in the past three cycles and predicted a pullback to the $42,000 level after BTC touches $45,000.\n\nBitcoin price crossed the $41,400 mark on Binance, in its ongoing uptrend, on December 5. BTC price rally is likely driven by the anticipation of Spot Bitcoin ETF approval. There are more catalysts driving BTC price gains in the current cycle.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

        "content": "Bitcoin price remains bullish, up almost 60% since mid-September, confirming the \u201cQ4 is the best month for BTC\u201d narrative.\n\nBTC could extend to tag the $40,000 psychological level before a bigger dip to give late and sidelined investors buy opportunity.\n\nWith strong downward support, GIOM shows there is one major area of interest between $42,556 to $67,413 threatening upside potential.\n\nInvalidation of the bullish thesis will occur the king of crypto breaks and closes below the $37,500 resistance level.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is trading with a bullish bias, riding on three themes. First, the fourth quarter has historically proven to be a good month for BTC. Secondly, there is strong anticipation for the approval of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with experts marking the calendar for between January 5 and 10. Third, the Bitcoin halving event slated for April 2024 remains something to look forward to.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price rally to $45,000 likely ahead of fourth BTC halving event\n\nBitcoin price could scrape $40,000\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is eyeing the $40,000 psychological level and could scrape it before a correction. Several bullish drivers, including the Relative Strength Index (RSI), bolster this outlook. For the RSI, this momentum indicator shows momentum is rising, with its position at 68 showing there is still more room to the north before the king of cryptocurrency can be considered overbought.\n\nFurther, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) is in the positive territory, with green histogram bars, suggesting the bulls are leading the market. Increased buying pressure, therefore, could see Bitcoin price extend from the current price of $39,462 (as of 8:00 AM GMT), and clear the $39,778 range high before scrapping the $40,000 psychological level.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn-chain metrics to support Bitcoin bullish outlook\n\nOn-chain aggregator IntoTheBlock\u2019s Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) metric shows there is no supply barrier that will prevent the largest crypto by market cap from achieving its upside potential. Based on this on-chain metric, there is only one major area of interest between $38,670 and $39,701 that is filled by a high number of investors that had previously purchased BTC around this price level. Here, roughly 860,540 addresses are holding nearly 324,370 BTC tokens.\n\nThe next crucial resistance extends from $42,556 to $67,413 where 5.64 million addresses or investors had previously purchased 2.11 million BTC tokens at an average price of $52,282.\n\nThe representation also shows that at current prices, 85.60% of BTC holders are sitting on unrealized profit (in the money) while only 12.74% are sitting on unrealized losses (out of the money). Meanwhile, a negligible 1.66% of token holders are breaking even (at the money).\n\nGIOM BTC\n\nAlso, the exchange inflows metric shows a declining trend, meaning the overall intention among token holders to sell BTC is reducing even as more continue to sit on unrealized profits. It points to a commitment to riding the uptrend, effectively giving Bitcoin price an abundance of buying pressure over seller momentum.\n\nBTC exchange inflows\n\nOn the flip side, if profit-taking begins, with traders cashing in for quick gains, Bitcoin price could move south, with key levels to watch, including $37,500, $35,000, $32,500, $31,529, and in the dire case, the $30,000 psychological level. Such a move would constitute a 25% drop from current levels."

During Bukele\u2019s first term as president, the Central American country purchased BTC via its national treasury, starting in September 2021, with an initial investment of $10.3 million. However, the price of Bitcoin soon collapsed by more than 50% amid the bear market.\n\nDespite this, Bukele continued to dollar-cost-average the country\u2019s Bitcoin investments, making repeated purchases throughout 2022. At one point in time, the country\u2019s Bitcoin portfolio fell as low as $45 million from a book value of $103.9 million.\n\nIn 2021, El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. The International Monetary Fund has since warned that Bitcoin\u2019s risks to El Salvador have \u201cnot materialized\u201d due to limited adoption in the country. Last December, Cointelegraph reporter Joe Hall traveled to El Salvador and attempted to pay for everyday services using Bitcoin, with disappointing results. By next year, El Salvador plans to introduce Bitcoin education in state-run schools.\n\nRelated: Salvadoran pro-Bitcoin President Nayib Bukele launches reelection bid"

The responsible thing to do would be for them to issue retractions, offer apologies, or, at the very least, acknowledge that El Salvador is now yielding a profit, just as they repeatedly reported that we were incurring losses,\" President Nayib Bukele added.\n\nBitcoin surges to highest levels since April 2022\n\nBitcoin prices experienced a 4% surge on Monday, reaching $41,598.0, its highest value since April 2022. This upward trajectory can be attributed to growing optimism surrounding potential reductions in US interest rates, coupled with speculation among traders anticipating the imminent approval of Bitcoin funds traded on the US stock market.\n\n\"The impact of an (ETF) approval is going to be big in terms of investment appetite because it's going to be more easily regulated, more attractive and easier to invest,\" Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at Swissquote Bank told news agency Reuters.\n\n\"What we have right now is a risk rally, and bitcoin is also benefiting big time by falling yields. There is also this positive bullish sentiment into next year because it is going to be the year of halving,\" Ozkardeskaya added.\n\nMilestone Alert!

Getty Images\n\nBitcoin touched a 20-month high at $42,000 on Monday before paring back gains.\n\nThe cryptocurrency is riding hopes about Fed rate cuts, helping investors turn to riskier assets.\n\nA spot ETF approval and the scheduled halving in 2024 are also boosting the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe crypto rally is marching on, and it's pushed the price of bitcoin to a 20-month high.\n\nBitcoin touched $42,000 on Monday before paring back gains at $41,616. The currency has been rising at a fast clip in recent months, putting year-to-date gains at over 150%. That's more than the S&P 500 (20%), Nasdaq (47%), and gold (14%).\n\nThe bitcoin surge has also helped crypto stocks like Coinbase, Riot Platforms, and Microstrategy witness triple-digit rallies this year.\n\nFueling the momentum in both the broader market and cryptos is a growing conviction that the Federal Reserve is not only done with rate hikes but ready to pivot to rate cuts next year.\n\nAfter a benign inflation report in November, stocks took off on an eye-watering rally, with the S&P 500 gaining about 9% last month. Those hopes about a Fed policy pivot have helped bitcoin maintain gains as well, as investors returned to riskier assets.\n\nCrypto bull Mike Novogratz said last week that rate cuts from the central bank would release \"animal spirits\" on financial markets, and an upside is coming for bitcoin.\n\nOptimism surrounding a potential spot bitcoin ETF approval is another piece helping thaw the ice from the crypto winter of 2022. Markets have been rallying on the prospect of a regulatory green light after an August court ruling in favor of Grayscale Investments' ETF plan.\n\nBlackRock, VanEck, Invesco and Fidelity are among other Wall Street heavyweights that have an ETF application in the SEC approval pipeline.\n\nThen there's the upcoming halving cycle scheduled for April that poses a bullish tailwind for bitcoin. That's because it foreshadows increasing scarcity in the bitcoin market, propping up prices.\n\nSome experts see crypto soaring to $100,000 in 2024 citing the huge gains bitcoin has seen in the year following a halving. That would surpass bitcoin's record high of $69,000 set in 2021.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

        "content": "In the past seven days, Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a whopping 14.5% surge, hitting a 20-month high at $41,130 by Dec. 4. Traders and analysts have been abuzz with speculation, especially in the wake of the $100 million liquidation of short (bearish) Bitcoin futures within just 24 hours. However, when we dive into BTC derivatives data, a different story unfolds\u2014one that places the spotlight on spot market action.\n\nBTC liquidation map\n\n\n\nEnough shorts to run it up all the way to $45-46k pic.twitter.com/7O2zYD4j8Q \u2014 Nik Algo (@nik_algo) December 4, 2023\n\nThe impact of the recent liquidations in Bitcoin futures markets\n\nWhile the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) trades USD-settled contracts for Bitcoin futures, where no physical Bitcoin changes hands, these futures markets undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping spot prices. The sheer scale of Bitcoin futures, with an aggregate open interest of $20 billion, underscores the keen interest of professional investors.\n\nIn the same seven-day period, a mere $200 million worth of BTC futures shorts were liquidated, representing only 1% of the total outstanding contracts. This figure pales in comparison to the substantial $190 billion in trading volume during the same timeframe.\n\nBitcoin futures aggregate open interest and volume, USD. Source: Coinglass\n\nEven when focusing solely on the CME, which is known for potential trading volume inflation, its daily volume of $2.67 billion should have readily absorbed a $100 million 24-hour liquidation. This has led investors to ponder whether the recent Bitcoin rally might be attributed to the targeting of a few whales within the futures markets.\n\n$BTC Next Possible Plan\n\n\n\nA Quick Wick to 42k-42.5k To Hunt BSL Of Shorts then A Quick Flushout of the Long's & We Might see $BTC Pullback down to 39k-38.5k\n\n\n\nRetracement to 39k-38.5k Will be good Buying Opportunity For the Last Leg upto 45k-47k Before ETF Approval pic.twitter.com/yc7k0hOBpZ \u2014 VeLLa Crypto (@VellaCryptoX) December 4, 2023\n\nOne could attempt to gauge the extent of liquidations at different price levels using tape reading techniques. However, this approach fails to consider whether whales and market makers are adequately hedged or have the capacity to deposit additional margin.\n\nDespite Bitcoin's surge to a 20-month high, futures and options markets appear relatively subdued. In fact, three key pieces of evidence suggest that there is no compelling reason to anticipate a cascade of short contract liquidations should Bitcoin surpass the $43,500 threshold.\n\nBitcoin derivatives show no signs of excessive optimism\n\nPerpetual contracts, also known as inverse swaps, incorporate an embedded rate that is typically recalculated every eight hours. A positive funding rate indicates an increased demand for leverage among long positions, while a negative rate signals the need for additional leverage among short positions.\n\nBitcoin perpetual 8-hour average funding rate. Source: Laevitas.ch\n\nData reveals a peak of 0.04% per eight hours earlier on Dec. 4, but this level, equivalent to 0.9% per week, proved short-lived. The current 0.4% weekly rate places minimal pressure on leverage-seeking longs, indicating a lack of urgency among retail traders. Conversely, there is no sign of exhaustion among bears.\n\nTo evaluate whether Bitcoin perpetual swaps represent an anomaly, attention turns to BTC monthly futures contracts, favored by professional traders for their fixed funding rate. Typically, these contracts trade at a premium of 5% to 10% to account for their extended settlement period.\n\nRelated: How to prepare for the next crypto bull market - 5 simple steps\n\nBitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.ch\n\nBTC fixed-term futures contracts data reveals a peak premium of 12% on Dec. 4, presently resting at 11%. This level remains reasonable, especially given the prevailing bullish momentum. Historical rallies in 2021 witnessed premiums surging beyond 30%, further challenging the notion of a rally predominantly driven by Bitcoin derivatives.\n\nUltimately, with Bitcoin's price soaring by 14.5% in just seven days and only $200 million worth of short futures contracts liquidated, questions arise regarding whether bears employed conservative leverage or diligently increased margin deposits to safeguard their positions.\n\nWhen considering the funding rate and futures basis rate, there is no clear indication that surpassing the $43,000 mark would trigger substantial stock losses.\n\nIn essence, the recent surge finds support in spot market accumulation and a decline in the available supply of coins on exchanges. Over the past week, exchanges recorded a net outflow of 8,275 BTC, according to Coinglass.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Earlier on Monday, BitCoin, and other crypto currencies surged to their highest value in 2023. Crypto in particular stood at over $42,000, with investors expecting it to hit $45,000 by March 2024. Here\u2019s why investing in BitCoins should be avoided\n\nBitcoin surged past the $41,000 mark on Monday during the Asian business day, reaching levels not seen since April 2022 before the Terra crash, while Ether also climbed above $2,200.\n\nThe move came after Bitcoin touched the $40,000 threshold in recent days, finally surpassing it and trading at over $41,400 at press time, indicating a 24-hour increase of approximately 5 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin pulls other cryptos as well Ether, too, experienced a similar percentage rise, reaching $2,240 within the same timeframe. Other top-ten cryptocurrencies witnessed more modest gains, with BNB coin, linked to the Binance exchange, showing a marginal 0.1 per cent decline over the past day.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, had dropped below $40,000 in April 2022 but has been on an upward trajectory in recent months, fueled by optimistic remarks from U.S. central bankers and anticipation surrounding the potential approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States.\n\nEther had not surpassed the $2,200 mark since May 2022 but achieved this milestone on Monday, marking a departure from its recent trading patterns.\n\nDirect custody growing Between November 17 and December 1, Bitcoin holders withdrew 37,000 BTC, indicating a trend toward direct custody of their coins. The surge in Bitcoin\u2019s value coincided with gold reaching a record high of over $2,100 per ounce during early Asian trading hours, driven by dovish comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnalysts, such as Lucy Hu, Senior Analyst at Metalpha, noted that the market is increasingly optimistic about a rate cut in the coming year, with growing bullish sentiment regarding Bitcoin ETF applications from major asset management firms.\n\nTraders hope for better climb Federal Reserve Chairman Powell\u2019s recent statement that interest rates are now in restrictive territory has contributed to the perception that the tightening cycle has peaked, putting downward pressure on Treasury yields.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTraders have been actively engaging in topside option plays, anticipating Bitcoin\u2019s potential rise to $45,000 by the end of March 2024.\n\nLooking ahead, the upcoming week will feature U.S. ISM services PMI data and non-farm payrolls for December.\n\nA strong non-farm payrolls figure could lead to a reassessment of Fed rate cut expectations for 2024, potentially slowing Bitcoin\u2019s ascent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShould one invest now? Although Bitcoin has broken the $40,000 mark after a really long time, now would not be the time to invest in it.\n\nIf we are to look at the historic values of Bitcoin, they tend to go up towards the end of the year and typically start rallying upwards in October.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo accurate has been this trend that serious investors even have a name for this phenomenon \u2014 Uptober.\n\nUsually, by the time January rolls around, the value of Bitcoin tends to stay high.\n\nHistorical data suggests that if one were to get into Bitcoin at the end of the year, they usually enter the market at a high. Yes, there is a chance that the value may go up, but the highest that Bitcoin has ever gone is around $67,567 on November 8th, 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, on average, Bitcoin had an average value of $36,000 in 2023, and went as low as $25,000 this year. Again, historical data suggests that this dip usually comes around the summer months, and is mainly fuelled by people selling their holdings in a state of panic. Long term investors, tend to favour this period for buying up more bitcoins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(With inputs from agencies)"

This move could eliminate the current 8.09% discount of approximately $1.89 billion, aligning GBTC\u2019s price more closely with the actual value of Bitcoin, offering significant benefits for investors.\n\nThe company\u2019s chief legal officer, Craig Salm and chief financial officer, Edward McGee, revealed the details. Pending approval from the United States Securities Exchange Commission, GBTC is set to transition from its current platform, OTCQX, to the esteemed NYSE Arca exchange. This move seeks to better synchronize GBTC\u2019s shares with the real Bitcoin price and introduce a streamlined mechanism for investors to create or redeem shares effortlessly.\n\nETF analyst Eric Balchunas from Bloomberg observed the notable dependence on Regulation M (Reg M) relief. He references past conversations suggesting that the SEC might use Reg M to possibly impede or postpone specific procedures, although he refrains from affirming this. Balchunas notes the intriguing timing of Regulation M being mentioned immediately after Grayscale\u2019s meeting with the SEC, hinting at its potential significance or impact in their deliberations.\n\nRelated: SEC solicits comments on Fidelity\u2019s spot Ether ETF application\n\nWith Bitcoin (BTC) currently priced at $39,481 and a surge in trading volume indicating heightened trader interest, the prospect of a spot Bitcoin ETF ensures investors a more precise representation of Bitcoin\u2019s value through GBTC and establishes a safer avenue for institutional investors to engage with Bitcoin. This development has already led to a 3% increase in Bitcoin\u2019s value in the last 24 hours, accompanied by a remarkable surge in trading volume, signaling widespread interest.\n\nIn a Nov. 28 X (formerly Twitter) post, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said the SEC delayed its decision on the applications 34 days earlier than the Jan. 1, 2024, decision deadline. Seyffart and his colleague Eric Balchunas had placed 90% odds on spot Bitcoin ETF approvals by Jan. 10, 2024, and the twin delays \u201call but confirms for me that this was likely a move to line every applicant up for potential approval by the Jan 10, 2024 deadline,\u201d Seyffart said.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin ETF optimist and Worldcoin skeptic Gracy Chen: Hall of Flame"

        "content": "DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc.\n\nVANCOUVER, British Columbia, Dec. 05, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc. (TSX-V: DMGI) (OTCQB US: DMGGF) (FRANKFURT: 6AX) (\u201cDMG\u201d), a vertically integrated blockchain and cryptocurrency technology company, announces it has signed an agreement with Bitmain Technologies to purchase 4,550 T21 190 TH/s bitcoin miners for US$12,103,000 (US$14/TH/s). Financing of the purchase may be through existing cash/liquidated bitcoin, debt or a combination of both.\n\n\n\nDMG Purchases Bitmain T21 Bitcoin Miners for up to 1 EH/s of New Hashrate\n\nDMG expects shipment of its T21 miners in the March quarter of 2024; terms of the purchase are 10% downpayment (already paid) with the balance due in the month prior to shipment. As the T21 natively supports a high-energy (overclocked) mode to 233 TH/s (with a modest decrease in efficiency from 19 J/TH to 22 J/TH), which DMG expects to utilize, the Company may be able to realize from this purchase up to 1.06 EH/s (subject to equipment receipt, installation and full operation), which is comparable with DMG\u2019s current hashrate. Delivery to DMG\u2019s Christina Lake data center facility is subject to change given macro factors including but not limited to shipping logistics and customs processing.\n\nDMG is planning to utilize its previously purchased mining containers, which are in the process of being installed at its Christina Lake facility in advance of taking delivery of the T21 miners. This new fleet, in combination with expected rationalization of its existing fleet, will help DMG improve its overall fleet efficiency anticipated to be below 25 J/TH post-halvening, which is expected in April 2024.\n\nNovember 2023 Preliminary Mining Results\n\nIn November 2023, DMG mined 64.7 bitcoin with 0.97 EH/s realized hashrate. DMG\u2019s bitcoin balance as of November 30, 2023 was 429 bitcoin. DMG exited November with 1.07 EH/s of realized hashrate. The Company is working to improve the operation of its fleet so that its realized hashrate is closer to its fleet nameplate hashrate of 1.2 EH/s in the coming months.\n\nStory continues\n\nAbout DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc.\n\nDMG is an environmentally friendly vertically integrated blockchain and cryptocurrency company that manages, operates, and develops end-to-end digital solutions to monetize the blockchain ecosystem. DMG\u2019s sustainable businesses are segmented into two business lines under the Core and Core+ strategies and unified through DMG\u2019s vertical integration.\n\nFor more information on DMG Blockchain Solutions visit: www.dmgblockchain.com\n\nFollow @dmgblockchain on Twitter and subscribe to DMG\u2019s YouTube channel.\n\nFor further information, please contact:\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors,\n\nSheldon Bennett, CEO & Director\n\nTel: 516-222-2560\n\nEmail: investors@dmgblockchain.com\n\nWeb: www.dmgblockchain.com\n\nInvestor Relations Contact\n\nCORE IR 516-222-2560\n\nFor Media Inquiries\n\nJules Abraham\n\nCORE IR\n\n917-885-7378\n\njulesa@coreir.com\n\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Service Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news release.\n\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information\n\nThis news release contains forward-looking information or statements based on current expectations.

        "content": "Bitcoin has jumped more than 140% this year to outstrip other investments like stocks and gold, and optimism for further gains is high.\n\nIts stellar performance comes after a turbulent period for the token. Following a crash in cryptocurrencies last year, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is now in jail for fraud, while top exchange Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao recently pleaded guilty to US anti-money-laundering and sanctions violations and were hit with fines of $4.3 billion and $50 million, respectively.\n\nIs Bitcoin\u2019s return to the $40,000 level a sign the industry is maturing and another bull run is underway, or will the token be derailed again?\n\nHere\u2019s all you need to know:\n\nWhy has Bitcoin just hit a 19-month high of almost $41,000?\n\nThe token has rebounded on expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates and hopes of greater demand from exchange-traded funds. The last time Bitcoin was at this level was in April last year \u2014 before the TerraUSD stablecoin collapse.\n\nThe industry is waiting for the outcome of applications from the likes of BlackRock Inc. to roll out the first US spot Bitcoin ETFs. Bloomberg Intelligence expects a batch of such funds to win regulatory approval by January.\n\nAnd there\u2019s another factor driving the price: Bitcoin halving, which is due to happen next year. More on that shortly.\n\nWhat\u2019s a spot Bitcoin ETF?\n\nIt\u2019s much like any other ETF, but it invests directly in Bitcoin. That will be a first for the US, which to date offers ETFs investing in Bitcoin futures rather than the spot market for the asset.\n\nIt means investors get direct exposure to the current market price of the token.\n\nAnd what is Bitcoin halving?\n\nIt\u2019s where the amount of tokens that Bitcoin miners receive as reward for their work is cut in half. The event happens every four years and is part of the process of capping Bitcoin supply at 21 million tokens. The coin hit records after each of the last three halvings.\n\nFor a fuller explanation of halving click here.\n\nAlso read: Why Stamping Out Crypto Bros Could Help Bitcoin\n\nWhat\u2019s the outlook for the price of Bitcoin?\n\nThere\u2019s a powerful tailwind behind the token. Optimists point to the drive to curb questionable practices and the flurry of ETF applications as a sign the industry is maturing, and that there\u2019s potential for a wider investor base for digital assets.\n\nMeanwhile, investors are increasingly convinced the Fed is done with rate hikes, which has fueled a rally across global markets.\n\nBut a reset in rate bets or unexpected snarls for the planned ETFs could yet derail Bitcoin. Some technical chart patterns, like the weekly relative-strength index, signal \u201coverbought\" conditions.\n\nWhat do the experts say?\n\nMichael Novogratz, the founder and chief executive officer of Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd., predicts that Bitcoin is poised to reach its former peak a year from now. Bitcoin reached a high of almost $69,000 in November 2021, before retreating 64% last year.\n\nOnce the Bitcoin ETF starts trading, Novogratz said that billions of dollars should flow into the ETF space within the first year, if not more.\n\nOf course, not everyone\u2019s a fan. Charlie Munger, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\u2019s vice chairman who died last week aged 99, called Bitcoin \u201cnoxious poison\" and warned that digital assets were \u201cpartly fraud and partly delusion.\"\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a bad combination,\" Munger said in a 2022 interview with CNBC. \u201cI don\u2019t like either fraud or delusion. And the delusion may be more extreme than the fraud.\"\n\nMilestone Alert!

The agency has rejected spot bitcoin ETF applications in the past, but experts predict a different outcome this time, as the regulatory mood appears to be shifting.\n\nStill, the price of bitcoin is down more than 40% from its all-time high in 2021.\n\nLast week, Anthony Rousseau, the head of brokerage solutions at TradeStation, told MarketWatch that bitcoin is setting up to hit a new high in 2024, thanks to the expected ETF approval and a halving event likely coming in April. Bitcoin hit new highs after three previous halvings.\n\nIn November, AllianceBernstein analysts said bitcoin could soar to as high as $150,000 in 2025, as it rides a new bull cycle.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies rode bitcoin's coattails higher, including ethereum (ETHUSD), Bitcoin Cash (BCHUSD) and Litecoin (LTCUSD).\n\nBy Mike Murphy\n\nBarbara Kollmeyer contributed to this report\n\nThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.
