        "title": "Unveiling Bitcoin\u2019s Water Consumption with Alex de Vries - greenpeace.org",
        "content": "Unveiling Bitcoin\u2019s Water Consumption with Alex de Vries\n\nAlex de Vries, the researcher behind a groundbreaking report that exposes Bitcoin\u2019s water consumption, spoke with Greenpeace USA to discuss the findings of this hidden ecological cost of Bitcoin mining. De Vries\u2019s research highlights substantial water usage associated with Bitcoin mining. The water consumption of U.S. Bitcoin miners alone could be on par with the average annual water consumption of approximately 300,000 U.S. households, equivalent to that of a city like Washington, DC.\n\nWith climate disasters plaguing the planet, including drought and scarcity of clean drinking water, consuming water at this scale for the \u201cnumber-guessing game\u201d that powers the Bitcoin network puts additional strain on a precious resource. De Vries\u2019s research indicates that Bitcoin\u2019s water consumption will soon rival that of the entire traditional financial system. Paired with its contribution to global carbon emissions, Bitcoin as it functions today threatens our progress on addressing the climate crisis and averting its worst consequences.\n\nThis report should prompt additional discussion on how Bitcoin is impacting the climate and endangering access to water. As evidence mounts of the Bitcoin mining industry\u2019s current and potential future role in exacerbating the climate crisis, it is imperative for users of Bitcoin, industry leaders, policymakers, financial institutions, and the global community to develop a solution to the technology\u2019s carbon emissions and resource consumption problem. Our campaign is urging the financial institutions driving Bitcoin\u2019s value growth to acknowledge the impacts of their direct investments in dirty mining and accept responsibility in the development and implementation of solutions.\n\nGreenpeace USA: What led you to research Bitcoin\u2019s water footprint?\n\nAlex de Vries: This dimension of Bitcoin mining has been under examined for years, but as climate change is worsening and water scarcity is becoming an increasingly pressing issue around the world, it also becomes more important to be aware of how much water is used by Bitcoin. Given the work I have previously done with regard to the electricity consumption of Bitcoin mining it\u2019s subsequently only a small step to the water footprint related to electricity consumption.\n\nGreenpeace USA: How did you conduct your research?\n\nAlex de Vries: There is a lot of data available on where miners are using electricity and how much electricity they may be using. These inputs were previously used to determine the carbon footprint of Bitcoin mining. The methodologies for doing so are well established. We combine the data on miner locations and their power demand with the carbon intensity of the electricity they are consuming.\n\nTo get to the water footprint of Bitcoin mining, we only have to replace the carbon intensity of electricity with the respective water intensity. It\u2019s worth noting miners also require water for onsite cooling, which has to be added on top of the water from electricity generation. For this part I looked into how regular large scale data centers are performing in areas where miners are located. The latter analysis was only done for the US, where I found that direct water consumption represents 10-20 percent of the total water footprint of Bitcoin mining.\n\nGreenpeace USA: How and why does Bitcoin use so much water?\n\nAlex de Vries: First of all we have to realize that there are millions of Bitcoin mining devices around the world generating 500 quintillion random numbers in what is effectively a massive game of \u201cguess the number\u201d every single second of the day. Only once every 10 minutes one participant guesses correctly and then gets to create the next block for the blockchain, which includes a reward of 6.25 Bitcoins. This process requires vast quantities of electricity, currently more than half a percent of our global electricity consumption is related to Bitcoin mining.\n\nGiven that we also require water for cooling purposes in thermoelectric power generation, plus the fact that water evaporates from the hydroelectric reservoirs, a lot of water is consumed to satisfy the power demand of miners. Of course, mining devices are operating 24/7 and generating a lot of heat in the process, so cooling systems are also required to keep the devices at optimal temperatures. As mentioned before, this onsite cooling is only a limited part of the total water footprint, which is also the case for regular data centers.\n\nGreenpeace USA: What is the scale of Bitcoin\u2019s water consumption?\n\nAlex de Vries: In total it can be estimated that Bitcoin consumed more than 1600 gigaliters (GL) of water in 2021 and is likely consuming more than 2200 GL of water in 2023. To put this into perspective; another recent study quantified that the traditional financial system (i.e., bank notes + bank branches + ATMs + cashless transactions) combined consumes close to 1800 GL of water per year. Bitcoin\u2019s total water footprint therefore could exceed that of the entire traditional financial system.\n\nWe also have to realize that while the traditional financial system handles over 2 trillion cashless transactions per year, Bitcoin is stuck at just 100 million transactions a year. The network is capped at handling a handful of transactions per second; a single block simply cannot fit more data. That means that while an average cashless transaction such as a credit card swipe will only consume about 2.6 milliliters of water, the average per Bitcoin transaction exceeds 16,000 liters. That may be enough water to fill a backyard swimming pool and it\u2019s roughly 6.2 million times more than what we need for a typical cashless transaction.\n\nGreenpeace USA: How much water is used by Bitcoin mining operations in the U.S.? How does this compare to other countries?\n\nAlex de Vries: Bitcoin miners in the US currently consume up to 120 GL of fresh water per year. This is enough to supply 300,000 households. However, Bitcoin miners in the US are not responsible for the largest share of the worldwide network\u2019s water footprint. Kazakhstan is actually the biggest contributor, with miners in the country consuming almost 1,000 GL per year. Even though there are less miners in Kazakhstan than in the US, geographical (climate) conditions significantly increase the local water consumption. This could be a serious cause for concern, as the country is already facing an expected shortfall of about 75 GL of water by the year 2030.\n\nGreenpeace USA: What are the major takeaways you would want readers to have from your new research article about Bitcoin\u2019s water footprint?\n\nAlex de Vries: I\u2019m firstly trying to make people aware of this dimension of Bitcoin mining. I am assuming readers will find that the water footprint of the network is larger than they could have ever imagined. I also hope readers will realize that simply putting more renewables in the Bitcoin network is not a way to make this problem go away. In fact, as renewables include hydroelectric power (the power source with the largest water consumption per kWh generated), this would only make the water footprint worse.\n\nGreenpeace USA: What could be done to reduce Bitcoin\u2019s water footprint?\n\nAlex de Vries: You could advocate for using wind and solar power specifically to power these operations, while also trying to lower direct water consumption through, for example, immersion cooling. At the same time, using our limited wind and solar supply for Bitcoin mining just means we\u2019ll have to use other power sources to power something else somewhere else. There is a big opportunity cost here if we keep using limited resources for the sole purpose of making useless computations in Bitcoin mining. All of the output (nothing more than random numbers in a massive guessing game) is immediately discarded.\n\nThe best solution would therefore be to get rid of this energy-intensive process altogether, which was already shown to be possible by the second largest cryptocurrency Ethereum. Last year September (2022) Ethereum cut their total power demand by replacing their own mining mechanism with a more sustainable alternative. There is no technical reason why this would not be possible in Bitcoin. Almost all of the electricity consumption, water consumption, carbon emissions and electronic waste generation would simply disappear overnight. There is no better solution than this.\n\nTo read the full report click here."

        "title": "Analysis: Don\u2019t count on bitcoin, gold or the Fed - CNN",
        "content": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business\u2019 Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.\n\nNew York CNN \u2014\n\nIt\u2019s already been a heck of a week for alternative assets, as gold and bitcoin surge. But analysts are cautioning investors to be wary of rushing in. All that glitters, after all, isn\u2019t gold.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening: The price of bitcoin surged past $44,000 early on Wednesday. It hasn\u2019t been close to this level since spring 2022. That\u2019s when Terra \u2014 a popular \u201cstablecoin\u201d that was meant to retain a $1 price point \u2014 lost its peg, and when the connected Luna cryptocurrency dropped 99% in a matter of days, bringing down most of the crypto market.\n\nThe recent swell in crypto is a result of investor optimism that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in 2024 and that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a bitcoin-focused exchange-traded fund, making it easier for mainstream investors to get involved. The SEC faces a January 10 deadline to approve the application.\n\nGold prices, meanwhile, rose to a never-before-seen high of $2,135.40 on Monday as investors price in larger rate cuts by the Fed. Prices fell on Tuesday, but bullion\u2019s value remains elevated.\n\nCrypto and precious metal advocates were gung-ho on Tuesday, claiming that this could be the dawn of a new era, a resurgence in alternative assets.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is so back,\u201d Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of crypto exchange Gemini, posted on X. \u201cBitcoin at 42k is the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything.\u201d\n\nJohn Reade, a market strategist at the World Gold Council, an association of gold producers, told CNN that, with investors predicting several rate cuts over the next year, gold prices could \u201cquite possibly\u201d shoot above Monday\u2019s record high.\n\nBut a few days does not a sea change make. Advocates may be getting a bit ahead of themselves.\n\nHere\u2019s why.\n\nNo interest paid on gold: Yes, gold technically hit an all-time high this week, but there\u2019s some context that needs to come with that statement.\n\nGold doesn\u2019t pay any interest, so \u201calthough we have hit all time highs in nominal terms, we are over 20% below the inflation-adjusted peak seen in 1980,\u201d wrote Jim Reid at Deutsche Bank in a note Tuesday.\n\nSo while gold may seem like a great way to hedge inflation, \u201cit only keeps pace with inflation if you buy it at the correct time,\u201d said Reid. \u201cIn reality, it trails traditional assets over almost all medium- to long-term time periods.\u201d\n\nA recent study by Deutsche Bank found that since 1800, gold has had an inflation-adjusted return of 0.32% a year. That\u2019s compared to a 3.07% return on Treasuries and a 6.83% return on equities.\n\n\u201cIt struggles on a competitive basis,\u201d said Reid. \u201cYou can be a long-run inflationist but still be a bit underwhelmed by Gold as an investment.\u201d\n\nCrypto uncertainty: Despite the buzz around the expected green light of a spot bitcoin ETF in January, there\u2019s no guarantee that the SEC will give its nod of approval. And even if it does, there\u2019s no guarantee it will send digital currencies soaring.\n\nWhile bitcoin has not approached its all-time record of near $69,000, set in November 2021, much of the price inflation comes from investors front-running the SEC\u2019s likely approval, said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner of the crypto lender Nexo. That begs the question of whether this is a \u201cbuy-the-rumor, sell-the-news event\u201d he said.\n\nThere\u2019s a danger that investors will \u201crush for the exit when it happens,\u201d he said, similar to when the first ETF for bitcoin futures was approved in the fall of 2021 and prices quickly plunged 87%.\n\nTrenchev also pointed out that bitcoin often goes \u201cinto reverse\u201d after it breaks key thresholds. \u201cTwo weeks after bitcoin pierced $40,000 for the first time during the last bull market in 2021 it sunk below $30,000,\u201d he said.\n\nA cautious Fed: The Fed is probably done hiking interest rates to fight elevated inflation, at least for this cycle. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s necessarily cutting them anytime soon.\n\nA number of Fed officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, have indicated in recent weeks that it\u2019s still too early to debate rate cuts. Instead, policymakers will focus on whether the current fund rate is sufficiently restrictive.\n\n\u201cIt would be premature to conclude with confidence that we have achieved a sufficiently restrictive stance, or to speculate on when policy might ease. We are prepared to tighten policy further if it becomes appropriate to do so,\u201d said Powell during a discussion at Spelman College last week.\n\nOther Fed officials have backed that stance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not thinking about rate cuts at all right now. I\u2019m thinking about whether we have enough tightening in the system and are sufficiently restrictive to restore price stability,\u201d said Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly in an interview last week. \u201cDiscussion about interest rate cuts is not particularly helpful at the moment. We should continue to focus on lowering inflation.\u201d\n\nCOP out?\n\nPeople walk through the COP28 U.N. Climate Summit, Monday, Dec. 4, 2023, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Peter Dejong/AP\n\nCOP28, the annual international climate summit convened by the United Nations in Dubai, is well underway, and it appears that big energy companies are making sure their voices are heard as pressure builds for the phasing down, or even out, of fossil fuels.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening: More than 2,400 people connected to the fossil fuel industry registered to attend the event, nearly four times the number that signed up for last year\u2019s climate gathering, according to an analysis published Tuesday.\n\nFossil fuel employees and representatives will outnumber every country\u2019s delegation except for the United Arab Emirates, the host of COP28, and Brazil, according to the report from a coalition of corporate watchdog and climate advocacy groups, including Global Witness.\n\nSultan Al Jaber, the oil executive who is leading the climate summit, meanwhile, shocked crowds when he said ahead of the meeting that there is \u201cno science\u201d that says phasing out fossil fuels is necessary to keep global warming under a critical threshold. Al Jaber says that his comments were misinterpreted.\n\n\u201cThe real outcome of COP28 is that the major crude oil and natural gas producers intend to control carbon capture, green hydrogen production, and alternative energy generation,\u201d said Louis Navellier of Navellier & Associates in a note on Tuesday. \u201cEssentially,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe pace of the green transition will be controlled by major energy producers.\u201d\n\nNaming names: That\u2019s not to say energy companies were totally in the clear. John Kerry, the US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, was critical of energy companies and even singled out Chevron after the company opted out of a pledge to reduce methane emissions.\n\n\u201cWe have no real evidence that [Chevron] and a lot of others are doing what every company needs to do,\u201d he said at the Bloomberg Green summit on Tuesday.\n\nAl Gore was also critical of the fossil fuel industry and called out Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods at the summit. \u201cHe should not be taken seriously. He\u2019s protecting his profits and placing them in a higher priority than the survival of the human civilization,\u201d he said of Woods.\n\nStill, said Navellier, \u201cthe bottom line is green energy is very expensive and the fossil fuel industry will make just enough green energy to appease government regulators, but fossil fuels will persist for the rest of our lifetimes.\u201d\n\nAluminum tariffs have cost the US beer industry $2.2 billion\n\nNew research by the aptly-named Beer Institute, a beer industry advocacy group, found that aluminum tariffs have cost the US beverage industry nearly $2.2 billion over the last six years.\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump instituted a 10% tax on aluminum imports from most countries in 2018 under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act.\n\nMore than 74% of all beer produced in the United States is packaged in aluminum cans and bottles, and aluminum is the single most significant input cost in American beer manufacturing, according to the Beer Institute.\n\n\u201cBrewers and countless hardworking Americans in industries that depend on aluminum have been taking it on the chin for far too long,\u201d said Brian Crawford, president and CEO of the Beer Institute, in a statement. \u201cThe reality is that [these] tariffs hurt far more than they help, and they hurt consumers who are already feeling the effects of inflation at the register.\u201d\n\nThere are more than 6,600 breweries in the United States. The industry supports about 2.4 million jobs and contributes $409 billion annually to the US economy.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated bitcoin\u2019s record. It was near $69,000."

The price of the biggest cryptocurrency has surged past $42,000 and is up more than 150% this year.\n\nWith the price recovery, we\u2019ve seen the reemergence of a certain kind of financial media character: the shill, the opportunist, the tout, the pumper.\n\nThey were everywhere when bitcoin was climbing to record highs in 2021. When Americans were getting government checks, sitting at home, and looking to strike it rich, crypto seemed like a no-brainer, driven in no small part by FOMO \u2014 and these hype men saying it was the future of finance.\n\nThe voices got quieter when the price crashed from above $60,000 to below $20,000, although the faithful insisted this was part of bitcoin\u2019s \u201ctypical cycle.\u201d That quiet turned to embarrassment for some with the collapse of the Terra stablecoin, the implosion of FTX (with whom many had financial relationships), and the arrest of Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nBut another characteristic of some of this cohort is their lack of shame. So even as all of those events were unfolding, it wasn\u2019t difficult to find them on Twitter, hewing fast to their stated belief that bitcoin was the answer \u2014 to getting rich, to finance, to whatever.\n\nWill retail investors get caught up in FOMO once again? Signs point to yes. The first leg of the latest rally seems to have been driven in part by predictions (once again) for institutional investment in crypto, tied in part to the anticipation of SEC approval for spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWith price action comes renewed retail interest. Robinhood just reported that November crypto trading volumes surged by 75% compared to October. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi that price appreciation begets media interest begets retail investment:\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cYou are starting to see retail investors wake up to certain segments of the rally. What tends to happen is, we've seen in the past as the price of bitcoin approaches all-time highs, the media coverage and intensity increases. And I think that plays a role as well. If people are just hearing more about crypto around them, they tend to become more interested, and you start to see that reflected in trading activity, at least in the past.\u201d\n\nAll of this is not to say that bitcoin won\u2019t keep going up, or that it couldn't indeed play some role in the future of finance. But I\u2019ve been at this long enough to be suspicious when a bet on an asset starts to sound like a religious belief \u2014 especially when the belief is intertwined with profit and depends on you also shelling out cash.\n\nThere are rational voices in the crypto universe who don\u2019t seem to just be relying on the greater fool theory. One of them is Devin Ryan, who covers the fintech industry for Citizens JMP Securities. He\u2019s looking at the sheer scale of the ETF industry, and the giant asset managers like BlackRock who are sure to allocate to their Bitcoin ETF if it is indeed approved.\n\n\u201cPeople are getting a bit ahead of the ETFs,\u201d Ryan told Yahoo Finance Live. But just \"a very small fraction\" of asset managers' trillions would in fact be enormous. Just think of all the private clients allocating a few million here, a few there.\n\n\"That could be hundreds of billions of market cap expansion,\" Ryan said.\n\nIt may not be the moon, but it's something.\n\nmorning brief image\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

The report suggested Bitcoin\u2019s target price range could be $50,000 to $53,000 early next year.\n\n\"Bitcoin may be targeting $50,000 to $53,000 based on the network activity valuation perspective,\" CryptoQuant analysts said.\n\nSell pressure may be rising\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nThe report referenced the \u201cbitcoin bull-bear market cycle indicator,\u201d indicating a current bull market but nearing an \u201coverheated bull phase\u201d which historically aligns with price rally pauses or corrections.\n\n\n\nCryptoQuant analysts noted that Bitcoin\u2019s supply in profit is above 88%, and sell pressure may be increasing as a significant portion of circulating supply is in profit. The report, therefore, cautioned of potential short-term corrections, noting that high levels of circulating supply in profit often align with local market tops.\n\n\"Caution is advised due to the possibility of a short-term correction, given that 86% of the circulating supply is currently in profit and funding rates are noticeably elevated,\" the report said. Current data from CryptoQuant shows that the circulating supply of bitcoin in profit has now increased to over 88%. The report added that such high levels of circulating supply in profit \"have historically coincided with local tops.\"\n\nBitcoin fell by over 2% on Thursday, trading for $43,100 at 7:10 a.m. ET. The entire cryptocurrency market capitalization is down nearly 1% today, now valued at $1.64 trillion.\n\nNmerous analysts maintain a positive outlook for 2024, a sentiment reflected in the recent surge in prices. This is attributed to a couple of key factors that may be driving the uptrend: the anticipated Bitcoin halving event scheduled for April 2024 and the possibility of approving a spot Bitcoin ETF."

        "content": "This year was a bloodbath for the crypto industry\u2014and for several of its biggest names, including Sam Bankman-Fried and Changpeng Zhao\u2014but it\u2019s become a victory lap for supporters of Bitcoin, which not only survived the calamity but ended the year with a spectacular rally.\n\nSwan, a leader among financial firms in the Bitcoin space, today announced an expansion of services that includes a foray into institutional products like Bitcoin-backed lending, along with $40 million in funding raised in 2023 for expansion efforts and another $205 million deployed across venture and private equity investments, a new hedge fund, and a credit fund.\n\nCory Klippsten founded Swan in 2019 as an investment platform focused solely on Bitcoin, offering basic asset management services to investors, including buying and selling crypto as well as crypto custody.\n\nKlippsten has also been a frequent critic of the rest of the crypto industry, pointing to the failures of firms such as FTX as an example of why the sector should focus on Bitcoin and move away from risky practices like rehypothecation, or using other investors\u2019 collateral for investments, which ultimately sunk other banklike platforms such as BlockFi, Celsius, and Genesis. He is also a visible figure in the Bitcoin community, with Swan opening a Bitcoin-dedicated house in El Salvador in the fall. El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021.\n\nIn an interview with Fortune, Klippsten said Swan\u2019s resilience in the wake of so many industry failures drove the firm toward offering institutional services. \u201cWe had a thesis that with the destruction of capital and all the fraud and all the other crypto shenanigans\u2026that a lot of companies and family offices around the world still needed those types of services, and there weren\u2019t enough providers,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople trust us, and people like our brands.\u201d\n\nSwan 2.0\n\nSwan has not been free of controversy. The firm relied on Prime Trust for custody services, with the Nevada-based company filing for bankruptcy in August alongside allegations of mismanaging assets. Swan then turned to Fortress, which was founded by the former CEO of Prime Trust, before Fortress faced a hacking incident in early September, along with a failed acquisition by XRP issuer Ripple\u2014the very type of blockchain firm Klippsten often criticizes.\n\nSwan is now working with another custodial firm, BitGo, to launch a joint venture trust company, which would be the first Bitcoin-only trust in the U.S. Klippsten declined to say where they are applying for a charter but says that he hopes to launch it by the third quarter of 2024. Until then, Swan relies on a combination of Fortress, Bakkt, and BitGo. \u201cI could\u2019ve wished for better outcomes with those guys,\u201d he said of Fortress, although he noted that he still believes in the model of separating brokerage from custody.\n\nSwan\u2019s entrance into the crypto lending space is sure to evoke bad memories of failed platforms like Celsius and Genesis. Klippsten said Swan\u2019s differentiation is twofold: It will not rehypothecate customer assets, and it will only offer Bitcoin-backed loans. He pointed to a similar product from Silvergate, a crypto bank that collapsed in March but never lost customer funds for its asset-backed loans.\n\nWith the lending product, Swan users can deposit Bitcoin as collateral and receive around 50% back in dollar-denominated loans at an interest rate in the \u201clow double digits.\u201d On the other side, Swan will find creditors to loan capital, taking an origination fee and spread at their borrowing and lending rates. Klippsten said the lending product will launch in the next couple of weeks, with $20 million ready to deploy.\n\nSwan has raised around $165 million in equity funding in 2023, with $125 million for private equity and venture investments. An additional $50 million was raised for Swan\u2019s first hedge fund, as well as $30 million for credit funding that will go to its lending services. While Klippsten declined to share details on the spending, he said Swan\u2019s investments are focused on the Bitcoin ecosystem. Klippsten said Swan plans to raise another $150 million in 2024 to fund expansion.\n\nSwan\u2019s revenue streams are also quickly expanding, buoyed by other institutional offerings such as advisor services and asset management for investors. According to Klippsten, Swan had annualized revenue of $125 million in November and expects to cross the $200 million mark in the first quarter of next year."

Leverage is a double-edged sword, magnifying both profits and losses. It also exposes traders to liquidations, or forced unwinding, due to margin shortfalls. Furthermore, mass liquidations often lead to exaggerated bullish or bearish moves, so the greater the use of leverage, the higher the probability of liquidations injecting volatility into the market."

        "content": "The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission could serve as \u201cthe final seal of approval\u201d for institutions considering involvement in the crypto space, according to Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood.\n\nArk Invest, in partnership with 21Shares, has a live filing in front of the agency for such a product. The deadline for the SEC to rule on the proposed Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) is Jan. 10.\n\nThe SEC allowed bitcoin futures ETFs to start trading in October 2021. Wood said during a Wednesday webinar those approvals were \u201cinteresting\u201d given the counterparty risk for those funds \u2014 compared to a spot product backed by bitcoin held in cold storage. Most issuers seeking to launch bitcoin ETFs have named Coinbase as custodian of the funds\u2019 BTC.\n\nGrayscale Investments notched a court victory against the SEC in August. Judges ruled that the commission denying the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF (GBTC) to an ETF, but allowing futures-based funds, was \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s all coming together, and if you look at our appreciation expectations for bitcoin, the biggest part of the appreciation during the next five to 10 years we think will come from institutional,\u201d Wood added.\n\nThe executive has said the price of one bitcoin could hit $1 million or more in the long term.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analysts put the odds of spot bitcoin ETF approval, by Jan. 10, at 90%.\n\nRead more: Industry watchers pin down possible bitcoin ETF approval dates\n\nApproval would be a change in stance for a securities regulator that has blocked dozens of spot bitcoin ETF proposals over the last decade.\n\n\n\nBut 21Shares President Ophelia Snyder reiterated previous comments Wednesday that there have been \u201cpattern breaks\u201d in recent months as issuers look to get these funds approved.\n\n\u201cIf everything goes the way it always goes, you\u2019re going to end up with the same result,\u201d she said on the webinar alongside Wood. \u201cI think the fact we\u2019re seeing very material differences in this round of the spot process versus prior rounds is a very promising indication of a different outcome.\u201d\n\nThe changes include issuers continuously updating their Bitcoin ETF filings. Industry watchers noted that this activity may signal ongoing dialogue with the SEC. BlackRock and Bitwise, for example, updated their S-1 forms Monday.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nAmong the additions in BlackRock\u2019s amendment was the language around the firm raising $100,000 of seed capital for the fund. Such capital is used to fund creation units that allow shares to be offered and traded in the open market.\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s] meaningful because it shows they are doing everything needed to launch,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart told Blockworks. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it means much more than that.\u201d\n\nOther amendments have been more technical, including disclosure language around electricity usage of bitcoin mining or the impact of a digital asset being deemed a security in the future.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThe latest bitcoin ETF filing from Ark and 21Shares came in April, which was a couple months before BlackRock entered the picture \u2014 a move that spurred Fidelity, Invesco and a range of others to re-up their own bitcoin ETF efforts.\n\n\u201cWe do think while we\u2019re first in line that a number of the firms will be approved at the same time,\u201d Wood said. \u201cDepending on exactly how they filed, it could be that more than a half dozen are approved in the first go.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

More recently, the SEC has met with issuers like BlackRock and Grayscale. Topics focused on regulatory specifics like BlackRock\u2019s proposed in-kind creation and redemption model (where investors can redeem shares directly for bitcoin). The SEC has pushed for a cash creation and redemption model, which is safer from a regulatory standpoint. BlackRock has made some revisions to its model but has kept it as an in-kind model.

Most of these issuers are already active in the crypto ETF space. They either have a bitcoin or ether futures ETF product or a crypto industry ETF product.\n\nWhile the spot bitcoin ETF market seems oversaturated, several large issuers are missing. ProShares, which has been well-known in the crypto space for its Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) has not filed for a spot bitcoin ETF. Other crypto equity ETF issuers like First Trust, Schwab, and Amplify also have not filed for a spot bitcoin ETF. The reasons are unclear but could have to do with resources (staff, time, funds) for spot bitcoin ETFs (similar to commodities) versus resources for equity ETFs. Issuers may also not want to cannibalize their own products.\n\nProShares, which has been well-known in the crypto space for its Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) has not filed for a spot bitcoin ETF.

Prior to the release of BITO and its other bitcoin futures ETF peers, ETF investors were using industry crypto or thematic blockchain ETFs to access the cryptomarket. Currently, the top 10 sector ETFs YTD are all crypto or blockchain thematic ETFs. The Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI) has been a top performer, returning over 200% YTD. It has been followed closely behind by the VanEck Digital Transformation ETF (DAPP). These ETFs have been performing well since the beginning of the year due to lower prices at the end of 2022, particularly after the FTX fallout. Toward the end of 2023, these ETFs have seen even higher prices. That has been due to bitcoin prices rising on positive news from spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe biggest selling point of many crypto equity ETFs has been a close correlation to bitcoin prices. The funds all boast other advantages like supporting the digital disruption megatrend. But the blockchain story is still vague and foreign for many investors. And many of the individual stocks (particularly the miners) are volatile stocks.With crypto equity ETFs, the correlation with bitcoin prices is much higher than it is for crypto stocks and bitcoin prices. These ETFs may not be as good of a proxy for bitcoin prices after the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs. But they will still serve as high-risk/high-return options for investors who may want to capture potential large returns related to the cryptomarket.\n\nFor more news, information, and strategy, visit the Crypto Channel."

Since the beginning of the month, exchanges have registered $614 million in short liquidations.\n\nTrading volume has also witnessed an uptick in the past month, according to The Block's Data Dashboard. In November the trading volume of bitcoin futures came in at $888 billion. Bitcoin futures trading volume has demonstrated a robust start to December, currently standing at $213 billion, just six days into the month.\n\nBitcoin has appreciated by almost 175% since the beginning of the year. The world's largest digital asset was up as much as 5% on Wednesday, trading for $43,659 at 7:30 a.m. ET."

        "content": "Block, the payments company led by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, announced on Thursday that Bitkey, a physical device on which customers can store Bitcoin, was officially open for preorders in more than 95 countries.\n\nThe Bitcoin wallet will ship in early 2024 and cost $150 in the U.S., a purchase price that includes the actual wallet, a charging cable, a mobile app, as well as recovery tools.\n\nIn an interview with Fortune, Lindsey Grossman, the business lead for Bitkey, touted the wide international availability of the hardware wallet but said that Block was focusing on a select number of countries to promote its new device. She pointed to the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Nigeria, Argentina, Mexico, and India as key markets where Block believes customers would use Bitcoin for both long-term savings as well as cross-border payments.\n\nShe declined to specify any internal sales projections for the hardware wallet and said that, currently, Bitkey is not available in any brick-and-mortar stores. However, Block is \u201cdefinitely open to partnerships and exploring that,\u201d she added.\n\nThe opening of Bitkey to the general public follows an open beta for the device announced in June, and it continues Dorsey and Block\u2019s commitment to Bitcoin across the company\u2019s business verticals, despite the cryptocurrency\u2019s lack of centrality to Block\u2019s current quarterly revenue.\n\nFormerly known as Square, Block derives the majority of its profits from its digital wallet Cash App as well as its payments offering for businesses, Square. In the third quarter of 2023, Dorsey\u2019s firm generated a gross profit of $1.9 billion. The profit derived from customers\u2019 purchase and sale of Bitcoin, which Dorsey integrated into Cash App in 2018, was only $45 million.\n\nThat said, Dorsey is a noted Bitcoin evangelist, and in 2021, he changed the name of his payments company to Block to signify the firm\u2019s commitment to integrating Bitcoin into its core business.\n\nSince then, Dorsey himself has led a number of investments in Bitcoin-specific enterprises, including mining enterprises. Part of his Bitcoin boosterism is predicated on his belief\u2014one that many in the Bitcoin community share\u2014that the cryptocurrency is a means to open up the world\u2019s financial system to those in developing countries who often struggle to gain access to banks.\n\nAccordingly, Bitkey\u2019s availability in more than 95 countries echoes that ideology, beliefs that trickle down to Dorsey\u2019s employees. \u201cWe think that Bitcoin has the highest chance of actually solving true payments and economic problems for the world,\u201d Grossman, the Bitkey business lead, said."

Elizabeth Warren, D.-Mass., about the use of cryptocurrencies by terrorists, drug traffickers and rogue nations to finance their activities. \"If I was the governments, I'd close it down.\"\n\nDimon, regarded by many as America's most prominent banker, said bad actors use digital currencies to launder money and dodge taxes, noting that cryptocurrency remains largely unregulated and hard to trace. He has long criticized the emerging crypto sector, once calling it a \"fraud\" and likening it to historical financial manias.\n\nWarren said the nation's banking laws need to be updated, but that lobbyists for the crypto industry are working to block legislation to tighten rules on digital currencies, including compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act.\n\nDimon's comments follow a tumultuous year for the crypto industry, including the November conviction of Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of bankrupt exchange FTC on multiple counts of fraud, and a $4.3 billion settlement with another major exchange, Binance, for its violation of anti-money laundering and U.S. government sanctions.\n\nDimon and other leading bank CEOs, who were on Capitol Hill Wednesday for a Senate hearing on regulating Wall Street, testified that their institutions have controls in place to detect and halt illicit crypto transactions.\n\nWarren, a noted critic of Wall Street, urged the assembled financial executives to support the \"Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2023,\" a bill that would extend and toughen banking laws to prevent the use of crypto for money laundering, ransomware attacks, financial fraud and other illegal activities.\n\nDespite calls for a government crackdown, the price of the world's most important cryptocurrency \u2014 bitcoin \u2014 has surged more than 150% this year to nearly $44,000, according to price tracker CoinDesk."

        "content": "Bitcoin traded close to $44,000 after notching its longest winning streak since May, a rally driven in part by expectations of looser monetary policy.\n\nThe largest digital asset climbed for six days through Tuesday, advancing roughly 16% to as high as $44,491 before giving up some gains. Its 2023 rebound from last year\u2019s crypto rout now stands at 163%.\n\nBitcoin is up almost 80% since mid-September, a rally that saw it take out the $30,000 and $40,000 levels in quick succession. Along with wagers that the Federal Reserve may start cutting interest rates next year, its rise has also been fueled by speculation that the the US may be close to allowing its first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.\n\nBlackRock Inc. filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in June to launch such a product, suggesting crypto could soon gain wider appeal as an asset class.\n\n\u201cSurely the ETF story is well and truly priced?\u201d said Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG Australia Pty. The recent high volatility and \u201cjet-fueled\u201d move up in Bitcoin is instead a reminder that crypto is \u201cmore responsive to a Fed pivot and policy than other asset classes,\u201d he said.\n\nFor now Bitcoin momentum is overshadowing any concerns that the surge is at risk of becoming too stretched. Smaller virtual currencies such as Avalanche and meme-crowd favorite Dogecoin have also been advancing.\n\n\u2018KIMCHI PREMIUM\u2019\n\nThe bullish overall mood is evident across a range of countries. Bitcoin on South Korea\u2019s Upbit and Bithumb exchanges at one point was trading about 4% above the prevailing global price on Wednesday, a return of the so-called \u201ckimchi premium\u201d that made headlines during the pandemic-era bull run in digital assets.\n\nIn Abu Dhabi, crypto mining hardware retailer Phoenix Group Plc jumped 35% on its debut on Tuesday. The firm is the first crypto-related listing in the Middle East. In El Salvador, Nayib Bukele said in a posting on X this week that the nation\u2019s Bitcoin investments had turned profitable. He\u2019s running for reelection after stepping down as president last week.\n\nAnother prop for sentiment is the so-called Bitcoin halving due next year, which will cut in half the amount of tokens that Bitcoin miners receive as reward for their work. The quadrennial event is part of the process of capping Bitcoin supply at 21 million tokens. The coin hit records after the last three halvings.\n\n\u201cBoth micro and macro factors are currently lining up for Bitcoin,\u201d said Zach Pandl, managing director of research at crypto fund provider Grayscale Investments LLC.\n\nBitcoin traded at $44,004 at 10:07 a.m. in London. It peaked at close to $69,000 in November 2021."

        "content": "Bug Fix on Bitcoin Core Could End Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20 Token, According to Bitcoin Developer\n\nA bug fix on the Bitcoin Core network in the v27 upgrade could reportedly halt the creation of new Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, which have been causing network congestion due to their exploitation of a vulnerability, according to a prominent Bitcoin Core developer.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals, introduced in January 2023 by Casey Rodarmor, are satoshis (sats) that have been inscribed with a piece of information, such as text or an image. This piece of information makes the sat unique and turns it into a de-facto NFT.\n\nLuke Dashjr, founder and CTO of OCEAN mining pool, claimed that inscriptions used by Ordinals and BRC-20 creators to embed data on satoshis are \u201cexploiting a vulnerability\u201d in the Bitcoin Core network, resulting in \"spamming the blockchain.\"\n\nDashjr explained that the Bitcoin Core code has allowed users to set limits on the size of extra data in transactions since 2013, but inscriptions bypass this limit by obfuscating their data as program code.\n\nThe bug that allows inscriptions to bypass this limit was recently fixed in the latest update to Bitcoin Knots, a derivative of Bitcoin Core.\n\nWhen asked if Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens would cease to exist once the vulnerability is fixed, Dashjr confirmed that they would no longer be operational. However, existing inscriptions would still remain.\n\nDashjr has strongly opposed Ordinal inscriptions since its onset, claiming that they are causing significant and irreversible damage to Bitcoin and its users. Earlier in May, he proposed to ban BRC-20s by extending spam filtration to Bitcoin\u2019s recently introduced Taproot transactions.\n\nRecently, Ordinals have experienced a resurgence in activity, causing the transaction fee on Bitcoin to surpass Ethereum\u2019s. According to Bitinfo, the average BTC transaction fee is currently $19.48. During the Ordinals frenzy in May this year, transaction fees reached a high of over $31."

The cryptocurrency surging as of late now trading near $44,000. That's its highest level in nearly two years. One of the drivers of the recent rally has been optimism over regulatory approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Our next guest runs one of the companies waiting to hear from the Securities and Exchange. Joining us now Michael Sonnenshein, Grayscale CEO. Good to see you, Michael. Thanks for coming in.\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: It's great to be here.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: So I guess, let's start with price here. What do you make of this latest surge? A lot of it does seem to be overanticipation that you guys and others are going to get approvals. Is the market setting itself up for disappointment here?\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: Well, there's been a lot of optimism in the market. I think a lot of that started earlier this year when our court case came to fruition. We won against the SEC, vacated that denial order of GBTC to uplist as a spot Bitcoin ETF. I think since that time, the macro environment, because bitcoin means different things to different folks, you have seen some investors flocking to bitcoin, flocking to gold, in a rising rate environment as an inflation hedge for their portfolios.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut maybe now as we're kind of turning the chapter into the new year, we're seeing the Fed may be going to start cutting rates. You could see us move into a more risk-on environment. And some investors allocating to Bitcoin thinking more about it as a technology investment or a risk asset.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: And, Michael, as you said, bitcoin means different things to different folks. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has a view. You won't be surprised, he didn't mince words. That bank here on Capitol Hill today, he spoke about it. Let's take a listen to that, get your reaction.\n\nJAMIE DIMON: We've been deeply opposed to crypto, bitcoin, et cetera. You pointed out, the only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, anti-money laundering, tax avoidance. And that is a use case. Because it is somewhat anonymous, not fully, and because you can move money instantaneously, and because it doesn't go through, as you mentioned, all these systems have built up over many years, know your customer, sanctions, OFAC. It's-- they can get bypassed all of that. If I were the governments, I'd close it down.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: So listen, I mean, in some sense, Michael, you know, Jamie Dimon kind of echoing some comments he's made in the past. He's been a skeptical. He doesn't mince words. But let's get your response to his response there.\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: Well, listen, I think every executive, particularly in the financial services space, is going to have their own opinions on new technologies and whether that's crypto or bitcoin specifically. But if you take a big step back, there is no question that this asset class is here to stay, that investor interest in this asset class is only growing. And it is these exact types of entities, these legacy institutions, these banks, that are already well underway on evolving their business models to account for these new technologies.\n\nSo regardless of the opinions that some of these executives may have, these banks and these large institutions have to position themselves for the modern-day investor. And that includes adopting new technologies like crypto."

        "content": "The price of Bitcoin has seen its biggest value boost since the 2022 cryptocurrency market crash.\n\nOn Wednesday (Dec. 6) Bitcoin was trading above $44,000, a far cry away from the $17,000 it was trading at during early 2023 \u2013 after the collapse of the Terra LUNA cryptocurrency ignited the biggest sell-off in the history of the sector last November. Leading many in the industry to wonder if crypto would ever recover from the crash.\n\nThe price surge for Bitcoin comes amidst boosts for other cryptocurrencies \u2013 with Ethereum (ETH) up 10% in the last week, Solano (SOL), Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) up between 7% and 27% in the last week as well. This surge comes alongside blockchain messaging service Wormside receiving $225m in funding \u2013 the largest market raise of 2023 for crypto.\n\nThe recovery has been welcome news for many, but especially the country of El Salvador \u2013 which yields the most federal holdings of bitcoin in the world \u2013 which now looks at a profit from its investment in the market for the first time since 2021.\n\nHope of US ETF approval drives Bitcoin price\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price has been reinforced by renewed calls for the US to approve a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) \u2013 which would invite more mainstream investment into the crypto sphere.\n\nApproval would be a milestone achievement for Bitcoin and validation it is a conventional asset. However, there have been discussions for years on this topic with nothing having been motioned so far.\n\nAlthough analysts do warn that failure to approve an ETF for cryptocurrencies, by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), could result in another crash for the bitcoin market.\n\nSpeaking to The Independent, research analyst for the investment firm Fineqia International Matteo Greco said:\n\n\u201cAn approval (from the SEC) is expected to bring short-term capital influx from the traditional finance investors, fuelling the uptrend, while a rejection might trigger a short-term negative price action due to high expectations of approval by market participants.\u201d\n\n\u201cA rejection could prompt market participants to adjust their positions, potentially leading to a downward trend in January. Analysts remain confident, however, maintaining a 90% probability of approval.\u201d\n\nFeatured image:"

And can the good vibes continue into the new year?\n\n\u201cThe main impetus for the bitcoin price rise seems to be the upcoming approval of the [spot] bitcoin ETF and the additional capital flows that will follow after the ETF is live,\u201d said Tegan Kline, CEO of Edge & Node, a company that is behind a protocol for organizing blockchain data.\n\nLuke Nolan, a research associate at CoinShares, thinks the \u201ckick-off\u201d of this Bitcoin rally came on the back of the mid-October ruling from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals that closed the June 2022 suit between the SEC and digital asset manager Grayscale. The federal court issued a final ruling that ordered the SEC to rescind its rejection of the firm\u2019s Bitcoin spot ETF application.\n\n\u201cWe have seen tremendous buying for two reasons as a result of this,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cPeople front-running what they believe will be significant flows stemming from the potential launches of the ETFs [and] if the SEC approves a spot bitcoin ETF, there is a \u2018stamp of approval\u2019 for the asset class from the largest capital market regulator in the world.\u201d If that happens, bitcoin could see more capital inflows, potentially boosting its value.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price surge into year-end has been exceptionally encouraging, as it has been accompanied by the highest trading volume it has seen since November 2022, said Joel Kruger, LMAX Group currency strategist.\n\n\u201cOf course, one of the main fundamental catalysts is coming from anticipation of mass institutional and mainstream adoption in 2024 as channels are opened up that will allow for easier access to bitcoin exposure,\u201d Kruger said.\n\nWhile ETF excitement is the driver being cited most frequently right now, it is unlikely that near-term demand for an ETF will be large enough to justify these price moves alone, said Wolf CEO Kelly Brewster.\n\n\u201cWhat seems substantially different this cycle is that there is a lot of activity happening around Bitcoin beyond those simply buying the asset expecting that it will appreciate,\u201d Brewster said. \u201cThere has been significant growth in layer-2 technologies such as the Lightning Network, collectibles and NFT projects that leverage the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol, and exciting new innovations like Taproot Assets from Lightning Labs, which is making Bitcoin a multi-asset network.\u201d\n\nMomentum has been \u201cconsistently building\u201d for Bitcoin-focused builders this year, said Muneeb Ali, CEO and co-founder of Trust Machines. \u201cWe are entering an era of Bitcoin that we have never seen before. One where scaling the usability of Bitcoin unlocks billions in untapped value.\u201d\n\nAnd the weekly crypto asset flows data from CoinShares supports that, Nolan noted. \u201cFor the last several weeks we have seen consistently high inflows into crypto funds,\u201d he said. The 10-week total was $1.76 billion, taking the total for the year to $1.84 billion in crypto asset flows. That amount has been \u201clargely dominated\u201d by bitcoin with year-to-date flows of $1.68 billion.\n\nOf course, other factors are contributing to this rally, too. For example, there seems to be a renewed appreciation for Bitcoin\u2019s security model and simplicity, and what is clearly different for Bitcoin this time around is that a lot of the things piloted on other blockchains during the last bull market are now being rebuilt on Bitcoin.\n\nWhat should we expect for Bitcoin in 2024?\n\n\u201cBitcoin is a very volatile asset, and so in the short term it would not be surprising to see $50,000 on the back of the technical factors that contribute to an upside squeeze,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cConversely, in every significant rally for bitcoin, prices can retrace 20%+ before resuming a longer positive trend. Looking at the weekly chart, we have seen eight green candles in a row. It would be largely unsurprising to see prices cool down in the near term and pull back 10\u201315%. But bitcoin often doesn\u2019t act the way it should.\u201d\n\nGiven that trends have a way of pushing into year-end, Kruger thinks it\u2019s quite possible the upside pressure will persist throughout December with \u201csetbacks exceptionally well supported into dips.\u201d\n\nThe rapid pace of this price movement is \u201cnot uncommon in the crypto space,\u201d Edge & Node\u2019s Kline said. \u201cWhile price corrections can happen, the current rally appears to be underpinned by strong fundamental factors, suggesting that the upside potential may be greater than in previous instances.\u201d\n\nKruger said he wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised to see Bitcoin close out 2023 in the \u201cnext big resistance zone, which we see in the $48,000 to $53,000 area.\u201d\n\nIn the long-term, if the easing of financial conditions plays out the way the market is expecting, and there are rate cuts in the middle of next year, as well as an increase of global liquidity, which seems likely, these factors would be positive to support a sustained rally and we very well could see Bitcoin at $70,000 by the end of 2024 \u201cas a conservative estimate,\u201d Nolan said.\n\nKruger expects more bullish price action, too, predicting that Bitcoin\u2019s price will push to a \u201cfresh record high\u201d and potentially \u201cchallenge the major psychological barrier at $100,000.\u201d\n\nOptimism is seemingly back in crypto markets, especially for Bitcoin, and if the momentum keeps up long-term, 2024 can be a strong year for the industry, startup activity and market players alike."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) options open interest reached an unprecedented milestone, surging to a staggering $20.5 billion on Dec. 7. This signifies the active involvement of institutional investors in the cryptocurrency space. Unlike futures contracts, BTC options have predetermined expiration prices, offering valuable insights into traders\u2019 expectations and market sentiment.\n\nAt the forefront of the Bitcoin options market stands Deribit, boasting a 90% market share. The exchange currently holds a substantial $2.05 billion open interest for options expiring on Jan. 26. However, many of these bets may lose their value as the deadline approaches.\n\nDeribit BTC options open interest for Jan. 26, BTC terms. Source: Deribit\n\nNonetheless, with the prospect of a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) gaining regulatory approval, previously sidelined bullish bets are reentering the playing field.\n\nHow costly is a Bitcoin call (buy) option?\n\nPresently, the $54,000 call option set to expire on Jan. 26 is trading at 0.02 BTC or $880 at current market prices. This option necessitates a 25% increase in Bitcoin\u2019s value over the next 49 days for the buyer to turn a profit. Sellers can hedge their positions using BTC futures while pocketing the options premium, mitigating some of the perceived risk of this trade.\n\nAnalysts have emphasized the significance of the $250 million open interest stemming from the $50,000 call options on Deribit. At the current price of $44,000, these options are collectively valued at $8.8 million. This valuation could experience considerable growth if regulatory authorities greenlight the spot ETF plans. However, it remains uncertain whether the buyers of these $50,000 call options intend to employ them for bullish strategies.\n\nThe relatively modest demand for call options within the $70,000 to $80,000 range, accounting for less than 20% of the open interest, suggests a lack of exuberance among bulls. With an exposure of $285 million, these options are currently valued at just $1.2 million. In comparison, the open interest for $60,000 and $65,000 call options set to expire on Dec. 29 amounts to $250 million.\n\nTurning to the put options, traders appear to have positioned themselves cautiously for the January expiry, with 97% of bets placed at $42,000 or lower. Unless the current price trajectory reverses, the $568 million open interest in put options may face bleak prospects. Nevertheless, selling put options can offer traders a means to gain positive exposure to Bitcoin above specific price levels, though estimating the exact impact remains challenging.\n\nRelated: SEC discussing \u2018key technical details\u2019 with spot crypto ETF applicants- Report\n\nBitcoin put options should not be dismissed \u2014 yet\n\nThe open interest in Jan. 26 call options surpasses that of put options on Deribit by a factor of 2.6, signaling a greater demand for neutral-to-bullish strategies. While the allure of the $50,000 call options is undeniable and holds the potential to drive Bitcoin\u2019s price higher, it\u2019s essential to remember that the expiration price is determined solely at 8:00 am UTC on Jan. 26, making it premature to expend substantial efforts at this stage.\n\nFor Bitcoin bears, the ideal scenario hinges on the ETF proposal being rejected. However, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission may request additional time to reach a final decision, especially considering recent amendments to many filings. Presently, industry experts, including senior ETF analysts at Bloomberg, estimate a 90% likelihood of approval in 2024, a projection extending beyond January.\n\nWith 49 days remaining until the Jan. 26 expiry, prematurely dismissing the 97% of put options as worthless seems unwarranted. Additionally, bears have the regulatory landscape on their side, as the trial involving Binance and its founder, Changzeng Zhao, has only just commenced.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Babylon, a bitcoin staking protocol under development, has raised $18 million in a Series A funding round co-led by Polychain Capital and Hack VC.\n\nOther investors in the round include Framework Ventures, Polygon MATIC -8.58% Ventures, Castle Island Ventures, OKX Ventures and Symbolic Capital, Babylon said Thursday. The project began raising for the round at the end of July and \"just closed it,\" David Tse, co-founder of Babylon and an engineering professor at Stanford University, told The Block.\n\nIt was an equity plus token warrant round \u2014 the same structure as Babylon's $8 million seed funding round disclosed in March \u2014 Tse said. He declined to comment on Babylon's valuation with the round.\n\nWhat is Babylon?\n\nThe Babylon protocol will allow bitcoin holders to stake their coins on proof-of-stake blockchains and earn yield. The protocol will essentially allow PoS chains to introduce bitcoin as a staking asset on their networks. Babylon aims to use Bitcoin BTC -5.35% 's security to enhance the security of PoS chains.\n\nPoS chains are currently secured by capital from their native tokens. Still, that capital can be costly, especially for emerging chains, as high inflation rates are required to pay high staking yields to attract such capital. The Cosmos Hub ATOM -5.39% community, for instance, recently approved a proposal to reduce the maximum inflation rate of its native token Atom from about 14% to 10%. The approved change would bring Atom's annualized staking yield from approximately 19% to about 13.4%.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nBabylon is already in talks to support the Cosmos Hub and Polygon networks, Tse said. \"Babylon is becoming a contributor to Polygon CDK [Chain Development Kit ] and the Polygon ecosystem more broadly,\" Polygon co-founder of Polygon Sandeep Nailwal said in a statement. \"Babylon integrating their solution into Polygon's staking hub not only bolsters the security of emerging chains but also addresses inflationary pressures inherent in traditional staking models.\"\n\nBabylon launch\n\nThe Babylon protocol is expected to launch \"around the next Bitcoin halving,\" Tse said. The halving is expected to occur in April 2024. Once launched, the Babylon chain protocol will \"serve as the control plane\" between Bitcoin and PoS chains, Tse said.\n\nWith the fresh capital in hand, Babylon looks to expand its current team of about 15 people and grow its ecosystem, Tse added."

According to Wikipedia, a cryptocurrency is \u201ca digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.\u201d Cryptocurrency is a young asset class that has developed a reputation for price volatility however there are ETFs that could help mitigate risk for those investors seeking crypto exposure. During VettaFi\u2019s Alternatives Symposium on November 28th, industry experts discussed their positive outlook for crypto in 2024.\n\nBitcoin was the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Ether is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three with its launch in July 2015. XRP, which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We\u2019ve included it here for reference.\n\nThe third-largest market share of cryptocurrency, tether, is a token \u201cbacked by actual assets.\u201d This includes one US dollar, one euro, or loans to affiliate companies and is controlled by the owners of Bitfinex. It\u2019s a controversial cryptocurrency due to its alleged manipulation of crypto pricing. It is called a \u201cstable coin\u201d because it was designed to always be worth $1.00.

The rally began on September 11, when Bitcoin hit a three-month low of $25,152, and since then, the coin has surged by an impressive 75% to its current price of $43,975. This unexpected rise has caught short sellers off guard.\n\nCrypto stocks, such as Coinbase and MicroStrategy, tend to correlate with the broader crypto market and have experienced significant gains due to Bitcoin's improving fortunes. Coinbase stock alone has surged by 51% in the past month, reaching $143.63. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy, which holds approximately $6.6 billion worth of Bitcoin, has seen an 82% increase since October, with its stock now valued at $568.88.\n\nAs a result of these substantial upswings, short sellers of crypto stocks have incurred losses of $2.656 billion over the past three months. More than half of these losses were generated from shorting Coinbase stock, with an additional 25% arising from shorting MicroStrategy stock.\n\nShort sellers in the crypto market have experienced significant losses since January, totaling around $6.05 billion. The situation worsened on Tuesday when they lost over $387 million in just 24 hours, setting the stage for a potential short squeeze where struggling short sellers purchase stocks to cover their losses, further driving up stock prices.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

As this is energy-intensive, water is used to cool the computer servers that run them as well as air-conditioning systems. Water is also indirectly consumed as it's used to cool power plants that provide electricity for miners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese uses cause water loss through evaporation, while adding pressure on groundwater supplies.\n\nTo estimate the indirect use, De Vries relied on Cambridge data of the large-scale bitcoin operations in the US, and compared it with the water intensity of electric generation on each specific grid.\n\nWhen adding direct usage, \"the total water footprint of US Bitcoin miners could be equivalent to the average annual water consumption of around 300,000 US households, comparable with a city such as Washington, DC,\" De Vries wrote.\n\nTo lessen mining's water impact, he suggested that miners center operations in areas that rely on renewable energy sources.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, some uncertainty remains, as the Cambridge data sample represents only 44% of the global total in bitcoin mining.\n\nMeanwhile, a UN study from October that relied on different data found that mining resulted in a 255 billion-gallon footprint in 2021, much less than De Vries' estimate of 415 billion for that year."

        "title": "The Next Bitcoin Halving Is Coming! 3 Crypto Stocks to Reap the Most Rewards. - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "If history is any guide, the crypto market is poised for a major rally in the months leading up to the next Bitcoin (BTC-USD) halving event. As we approach the new year, speculators could push up the prices of cryptocurrencies, benefiting traditional stocks with crypto exposure. In the past, crypto stocks appreciated in the months leading up and after Bitcoin halvings.\n\nThe first Bitcoin halving occurred in 2012 when mining rewards halved from 50 BTC per block to 25. In fact, the Bitcoin halving occurs in 4-year cycles to help maintain scarcity and counteract inflation by cutting miner rewards. Following the Bitcoin halving of 2024, the next cycle will see the block reward for miners fall from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.\n\nThe upcoming Bitcoin halving event is estimated to occur in April or May 2024. It presents a golden opportunity for savvy investors to capitalize on the likely appreciation of crypto stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTo position a portfolio for maximum gains around the next Bitcoin halving, these three crypto stocks tied to blockchain technology are poised to reap the most rewards.\n\nRiot Blockchain (RIOT)\n\nIn this photo illustration, the Riot Platforms (RIOT) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the next Bitcoin halving approaches, efficiency will be the key to the drop in mining rewards from the Bitcoin halving. Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT), one of the largest crypto miners in the world, is leading the low-cost mining of Bitcoins.\n\nRIOT recently invested $162.9 million to triple its mining capacity ahead of the Bitcoin halving event. The company acquired 33,280 \u201cnext-generation\u201d Bitcoin miners in June and should be able to maintain and even increase its Bitcoin production.\n\nThe company mined 1,100 BTC in the third quarter, producing revenue of $51.9 million. At the time of reporting, it had around $290 million in cash, with over 7,300 BTC in its cryptocurrency wallets (worth around $275 million). RIOT even saw its adjusted EBITDA soaring 7-fold to $31.6 million from $4.3 million last year and is well-positioned to benefit from the upcoming halving.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoinbase (COIN)\n\nThe app for Coinbase (COIN) displayed on an iPhone screen.\n\nSource: OpturaDesign / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrypto exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) also tends to rally around the Bitcoin halving events. Although it doesn\u2019t mine BTC, it provides technology and financial infrastructure for the crypto economy. More specifically, it provides a marketplace and a liquidity pool to maintain crypto transactions for individuals and institutions.\n\nAs BTC rises before and after the Bitcoin halving, Coinbase\u2019s transaction fees, a percentage of trade volumes, should also increase. Since the company earns money on every trade, it implies higher revenue and profits, making Coinbase a smart crypto stock proxy play.\n\nThe company has $5.5 billion in cash, and in its third-quarter earnings report, it raised its outlook for adjusted EBITDA for the full year. Its net revenue saw sustained growth over the last year, rising from $576 million to $623 million in the third quarter.\n\nInteractive Brokers (IBKR)\n\nFuturistic stock exchange (cryptocurrency) with chart, numbers and BUY and SELL options (3D illustration). Under-the-Radar Cryptos\n\nSource: 0pen / Shutterstock.com\n\nInteractive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) is a global broker providing trading and exchange accounts for clients with exposure to cryptocurrencies. However, it also has its own futures trading desk to supply crypto derivatives to clients. Besides Bitcoin, the company provides financial services for other markets. Its diversified portfolio isn\u2019t exclusively reliant on cryptocurrencies, making it a solid defensive play.\n\nAdditionally, IBKR launched a new product last year to allow customers to custody cryptocurrencies. And the company offered it in integration with traditional financial instruments in a single account. This innovative offering makes it simpler and more convenient for investors to gain cryptocurrency exposure. So, when the next wave of adoption begins, it should attract greater interest to IBKR\u2019s platform.\n\nIBRK trades at a P/E ratio of 28.8x, with a forward dividend yield of 0.5% and a market capitalization of $34.1 billion. Its latest report showed that it had $404 billion in client equity, up 27% from last year. Additionally, the company increased the number of clients holding accounts by 21% to 2.4 million last quarter, suggesting continued growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "ECB research explores Bitcoin's popularity in emerging markets - Ledger Insights",
        "content": "The European Central Bank (ECB) published a working paper exploring the popularity of Bitcoin in emerging economies. It found speculation impacts cryptocurrency prices worldwide. However, in emerging economies, the instability of the local fiat currency is an additional driver of demand. Despite the price volatility, Bitcoin may be viewed as a store of value by those holding unstable local currencies.\n\nFluctuating advanced economy currencies did not impact cryptocurrency activity. For example, during the period the Australian Dollar, British Pound and Japanese Yen were relatively unstable, but didn\u2019t impact crypto demand.\n\nThe research also found that Bitcoin is used for payment transactions in some emerging economies. That\u2019s particularly true for cross border payments where economies have capital controls or for receiving remittances at a lower cost. Our own cursory analysis below indicates remittances could be a major factor.\n\nAdditionally, the research found a correlation in payment usage in countries that have underdeveloped traditional finance systems. Plus countries with younger, less risk averse populations also use Bitcoin more.\n\nRather than basing conclusions on anecdotal evidence, it looked at transactions against Bitcoin in local currencies. It used off-chain data from popular P2P exchanges rather than cryptocurrency exchanges which are more likely to have wash trades.\n\nThe IMF previously expressed concerns regarding the potential of cryptocurrency to impact economies with volatile countries and as a means to circumvent controls. In 2019, 90% of IMF member countries had capital controls.\n\n\u201cOur findings clearly point to potential financial stability risks in EMDEs with low levels of financial development and unstable fiat currencies,\u201d the ECB report concludes. It notes that the price volatility of Bitcoin could discourage some, but stablecoins based on reserve currencies might become more widely used.\n\nA crossover with remittances?\n\nGiven two of the key drivers are unstable currencies and the need for cross border remittances, in our view, it is worthwhile determining which is a bigger influence. That\u2019s because the G20 is trying to address remittance costs, whereas volatile currencies are a far trickier issue.\n\nA quick (admittedly cursory) analysis indicates that remittances could be a major factor. Four of the top eight economies with the most inbound remittances are in the top ten for crypto. Regarding local fiat currency instability, only one of the top ten most volatile jurisdictions appears on the list. However, if you look further down the list, several others are big crypto users.\n\nChainalysis ranked countries in terms of cryptocurrency adoption. The top ten are:\n\nIndia Nigeria Vietnam USA Ukraine Philippines Indonesia Pakistan Brazil Thailand\n\nAccording to World Bank research, these are the top eight countries for inbound remittances:\n\nBelow is data on fiat currency volatility from the ECB report:\n\n\n\nThe ECB research\u2019s findings were particularly during and post COVID, when migrant workers may have been stuck offshore.\n\n\n\nMexico has both a volatile currency and considerable inbound remittances. Yet it only ranks in 16th spot on the Chainalysis list. There are two potential explanations. Firstly, crypto is banned, similar to 11th-ranked China. Secondly, while Mexico is not considered dollarized, the U.S. dollar is widely used, so there is an alternative store of value and medium of exchange."

        "title": "Analyst Who Predicted Bitcoin Reaching $45K Explains Key Drivers Behind Latest Bull Run - CoinDesk",
        "content": "The state of crypto is presented by Tron connecting the world to the power of Cryptocurrency. Matrix Sport anticipates Bitcoin climbing up to $63,000 by April 2024. Why should you care? Well, a month ago, they predicted Bitcoin would hit $45,000. Guess where it is? Yeah, it hit that just a couple of days ago. Joining us now to discuss the next move in crypto is Matrix Support, head of research and strategy, Marcus Sten. Welcome back, Marcus. Thanks for having me. Glad to see you again. So as as I said, a month ago, you said $45,000 was imminent. You weren't kidding? And I was skeptical. So I think we all were Marcus. Yeah, I was like, ok, yeah, that's, that's all right. Have fun with that Marcus. And sure enough here we are 4040 change, we hit 45,000. Um What do you think is driving this bull run? Um And don't just say I told you so because you told us so, but also what's the underlying factors in this latest bull run? Well, when you look at February 1st, there's actually a a coin desk article where we already predicted by December this year 45,000. So we have been working with this 45,000 level for literally the whole year. But you know, this year we have seen actually four legs or five legs with the latest one of this bull market, right? The first one started in January based on lower inflation numbers. Uh The second one was in March. On the one side, we got, of course, the three banks that were dismantled. Bitcoin is a new financial system basically. Uh We also had, of course, b using moving a lot of B US D into Bitcoin during this time. Then of course, in June, we had the Blackrock announcement about the potential ETF F. And then I think what people, what a lot of people missed actually in October, we had then a 50 60% rally on the back of power actually started to turn do. And I think this was actually a big trigger. Um It was only really like the last 23 weeks where people became more confident about the Bitcoin ETF potentially being approved in January. Um But I think it was actually in, in October when Fetcher Powell turned Dovish that we started to have a, a monster rally and we were just really pushing the market. And, you know, we were on top of this. And last time we spoke, you know, we also talked about the miners, the miners are exploding. So we are really happy right now. So, so you, you mentioned the B US D to Bitcoin rally and we of course, saw this uh settlement now with uh finance and the US government which uh would cause CZ to uh spend uh uh uh a few days uh getting three hots and a cot from, from the federal government. So, um did that have any, did that play any factor? Do we know of anything uh in terms of movements involving B into in and the price of Bitcoin? Uh ha has there been any linkage if you will in this latest rally? Some, some people try to argue this way. I mean, I doubt it. I don't think there's anybody out there who has been like sitting on the sidelines and waiting until basically the, you know, the US government goes after Binance. I don't think this was the trigger. I mean, the only positive news there was that people expected something like 6 to 10 billion uh fines or 4 billion. Sounds a lot more positive. But I think the key thing that, that I didn't hear anybody talking about is that since, since October, we have seen $7 billion of uh new market cap in US CT and tethers. So this just shows there is a large investor or large investors, institutional investors are sending money to tether, minting tether and really moving money probably from US dollar into crypto and I think that's a big driver. This is like $7 billion of fresh money that's coming in. That's, you know, much bigger than ETP, that, you know, people try to quote or name. Um, so, yeah, so I don't think that's, that's the driver. I think the driver is something else. Well, where, where is that source of tether? Where is it coming from? Obviously, Tether is notorious about its opaqueness. But do we have any sense of what drove that amount of money going into tether? Which I mean, let's be honest, is barely redeemable if at all, unless you are, I don't know, Saman man freed uh who apparently had some ability to do some redeeming. But other than that, why did we have those purchases of tether? It doesn't say that's not a US gov that's not a US institutional play. Well, on the one side, you know, we have a lot of struggles still in China. And as you might know that uh you know, the most tethers being issued are actually on throne, not on this year. So and Tron is of course, you know, to some extent linked to emerging markets linked to China. You know, we we have heard of course the property uh vo still continue in China, you know, gold prices are also going up, which is also probably linked to China. The PB OC has been really starting to buy gold over the last three or four months. So we would assume that's probably, you know, the population also starts to buy gold and probably other assets as well. So I would really think, uh you know, you look at the market cap of tether, which started to really, really since uh since Powell's speech. So I think there is somebody believing in the market that this Darvish flip really that you have seen from the central bank is really driving a lot of asset inflows. And you know, Bitcoin is a key beneficiary here, but it could, it, I mean, it's not internal issues going on in China for instance, or, or what have you uh people trying to get money out and uh you know, we we we do know of some, let's just say questionable movements in the past involving China and uh and funds and tether. Yeah, of course, we don't know. Right. We don't know, but we know that the market cap is going up. We also know a lot of other historical analysis. For example, when the, when the CME listed the Bitcoin futures in 2017, from the moment they announced it until the futures were actually listed. Bitcoin went up 180%. So, you know, we can assume that the market uh you know, uh the animal spirits are really taking over now where people are kind of just really trying to front from this part as well. But I think it's really like the mixture of really, you know, positive news from the central bank. You know, a lot of money suddenly becoming, you know, free and going into crypto. Uh and I think this is something really happening under the hood without people really noticing it. Marcus. We uh we got to get your comments on this clip. Everyone's talking about Jamie Dimond JP Morgan Chase CEO and chairman. He was on Capitol Hill yesterday talking about Bitcoin. Let's take a listen. I've always been deeply opposed to crypto, Bitcoin et cetera. You pointed out the only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, antimo laundering, tax avoidance. And that is a use case uh because it is somewhat anonymous, not fully and because you can move money instantaneously and because it doesn't go through, as you mentioned, all these systems have built up over many years. No, your customers sanctions. Of fact, it's didn't get bypass all of that. I, if I was the government's, I'd close it down. All right, Marcus, we have those comments from Jamie Dimond that's up against uh massive asset managers like black rock racing towards the spot. Bitcoin ETF. What do you make of that? Well, I think it's a, it's a comment from the past, right? I mean, this comment we have heard, you know, 5678 years ago already, you know, from, from Jamie Diamond, you know, we know that JP Morgan internally has been active on crypto the last kind of like, you know, 67 years, really, they have their own crypto internal team. So, you know, I think that the banks are trying to just fight a little bit back here, but I think it's still that this universe is getting like bigger and bigger. And I think we just have to see how crypto develops. Now. Just before we wrap, we got to talk about matrix ports predictions for next year. Since your 2023 predictions have kind of come in spot on. We have a chart here from your latest report that shows Bitcoin hitting 100 and $25,000. Talk to us about what factors went into uh this prediction. Why are we expecting it to hit 125 next year? Yeah. So the 30 the 63,000 target is actually from last year end of October, which is like the myth having low and then the projection, you know how it's like played out. And this really put us on a really bullish map this year. Um You know, the other factor is that um in, in June this year, we had the one year new high making for the first time in a year. And historically, we have seen like a 300% increase from there, you know, from that moment on. But also when you look at the, the three halving years, 2012, 2016, 2020 the average return is 200%. So where we are right now, you know, around like 40,000 or 45,000. I think you could really project another, you know, uh 200% from here, which would get us to 100 and 20,000. I know it sounds quite optimistic, but I think, uh we'd be probably gonna make our move towards 100,000 next year, for sure. All right, Marcus, I think there's a lot of people watching that are really hoping that prediction comes true. Thanks so much for joining us. It's always a pleasure having you on the show and happy holidays. Thank you. You too. That was Matrix four, head of research and strategy. Marcus Thin."

        "title": "What the Bitcoin Halving Means for Investors - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe next Bitcoin halving is fast approaching. And though this seismic event has happened three times before, and it's been baked into Bitcoin's code since birth, it once again has observers wondering: What does that mean for me?\n\nThe halving is first and foremost an important event for Bitcoin miners, who will see the fruits of their labor slashed in half once again. But it also has meaning for BTC investors\u2014if for no other reason than market sentiment and the attention that the halving typically brings.\n\n\u201cThe halving hype is loud and big because people listen and only that\u2014this halving has more people listening,\u201d Scott Norris, co-founder of Bitcoin miner LSJ Ops, told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo what does the Bitcoin halving really mean for retail traders? Should they be paying attention?\n\nBitcoin halving: the nuts and bolts\n\nAfter the next Bitcoin halving, which should take place next April, miners will be rewarded with 3.125 BTC for each block they process. That's half the current rate of 6.25 BTC. The reason for this is to keep Bitcoin inflation in check.\n\nThere will only ever be 21 million BTC minted, but the rate at which new coins are created is slowed down every four years.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to predict the exact date of the halving because it\u2019s scheduled to occur once per 210,000 blocks mined. The rate at which new Bitcoin is mined fluctuates depending on network activity.\n\nBut other than the amount of BTC being rewarded to miners changing, some say this halving will be different from previous ones\u2014simply because more people are now talking about it. There's more interest today in the cryptocurrency industry\u2014especially from institutions\u2014than ever before.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSince Bitcoin\u2019s last halving back in 2020, a lot has happened. The price of the biggest digital asset is now more than four times what it was ahead of the last halving; the coin went on a massive bull run in 2021 when it touched its all-time high of $69,044, before dropping down again. Bitcoin has also become far more mainstream and big money from traditional and respected firms has poured in.\n\nThe last three halvings have led to a price surge following the event: Before the first halving of 2012, BTC was priced at $12.35; one year later the price of the coin stood at $964.\n\nThe next halving on July 9, 2016, BTC was trading hands for $663. Again, one year later, it had shot up in value and was priced at $2,500.\n\nAnd at the latest halving, which took place on May 11, 2020, BTC was valued at $8,500. A bull run followed the next year and the biggest digital coin exploded to an all-time high the next year.\n\nFor that reason, retail investors\u2014and not just miners\u2014should be paying attention to the next halving, industry insiders say. \u201cThere are more people focused on Bitcoin now, more people building on Bitcoin now than ever before,\u201d Bob Bodily, CEO of Ordinals marketplace Bioniq, told Decrypt.\n\nBodily added that the halving mixed in with a potential approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), interest from venture capitalists, and developers building on the blockchain could lead to the \u201ccraziest bull run of all time.\u201d\n\nHyperbole? Maybe, but those predictions are supported from even the likes of British multinational Standard Chartered. The bank's analysts say they expect the combination of miner rewards getting cut in half plus the potential approval of an ETF could lead to Bitcoin hitting $100,000 per coin next year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPerhaps the biggest Bitcoin bull of them all, MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor, has also said the halving combined with the potential approval of several Bitcoin ETFs could lead to a flood of money into the market like never before. And he's put his money where his mouth is: MicroStrategy now holds $6.6 billion in Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin halving: what does it mean for BTC price?\n\nDoes that mean retail investors will come rushing in as the halving draws closer? Bitcoin fans don't need any further convincing, says Bodily. They're likely to keep buying. But for traditional investors who haven't yet stepped into crypto, the play might not be as obvious, given the associated risks.\n\nBitcoin is a notoriously volatile asset, and the relatively illiquid market\u2014when compared to traditional stock assets\u2014is prone to wild swings. An ETF should help stabilize things, analysts say, if it is indeed approved for trading and large amounts of capital enter the market as they expect. But mom and pop retail buyers might still be hesitant, given the events of the last year.\n\nBitcoin crashed spectacularly after peaking at an all-time high of $69,000 in November 2021. A number of factors contributed to its fall, including the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, the contagion that spread throughout the industry, and macroeconomic shifts like the U.S. Federal Reserve raising interest rates to record levels as inflation soared.\n\nThe digital asset then hit a multi-year low of around $15,000 a year later following the implosion of FTX and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried\u2014a saga that only recently reached its climax after the former billionaire was convicted of multiple federal crimes. Lawmakers and regulators are now more closely scrutinizing crypto markets, so it's reasonable to think that your typical Fidelity client might be apprehensive about diving back into crypto.\n\nShort of an ETF, more traditional investors can still gain exposure to Bitcoin through proxies such as publicly traded mining companies. Nishant Sharma, founder of Bitcoin mining industry public relations firm BlocksBridge Consulting, told Decrypt that investors who want to get exposure to mining company stocks should pay attention to metrics that tell how efficient and reliable a mining company\u2019s operations are.\n\n\u201cAn example of such a metric is the hash rate realization of a company, which shows how much of a company\u2019s installed hash rate was used by it to mine bitcoin in the past month,\u201d he said. \u201cBy checking the [hash rate] of a company over the past year or more, one can also get an idea of the company\u2019s softer aspects that cannot be measured, such as, the foresight of a company to plan for regulatory or environmental disruptions, etc.\u201d\n\nStill, when it comes to how investors should consider the Bitcoin halving, not everyone is convinced that the event has a bullish effect on BTC's price necessarily, despite how previous halvings have played out.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no proof it has an effect on price,\u201d Scott Norris, co-founder of Bitcoin miner LSJ Ops, told Decrypt. But it's \u201cgreat for hype,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hype machine loves it and it sparks the FOMO [fear of missing out].\"\n\nLong-time pseudonymous contributor to Bitcoin privacy wallet Wasabi, who goes by the name Rafe, said that the halving is \u201ca known change\u201d but traditional investors who aren\u2019t yet \u201cdeep in the Bitcoin rabbit hole\u201d will take more note of this one.\n\nMost of all, it\u2019s likely that the halving will be what it\u2019s always been: an event for miners. With Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate higher than ever, miners are having to work harder\u2014and this could put some out of the business altogether. For that reason, those minting the coins are the ones who will be closely watching next year\u2019s event.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

Bitkey will feature a two-of-three multi-signature wallet consisting of a mobile key, a hardware key and a server key, with a secure hardware device alongside recovery tools in the event of loss. It will require both the user\u2019s fingerprint and phone to approve transactions.

It\u2019s set for pre-order only, with rollouts expected in early 2024.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2023, Block recorded $5.62 billion in revenue on the back of solid sales growth for payment processors Cash App and Square. The firm also realized a $44-million profit on its Bitcoin investments due to BTC\u2019s recent price recovery. Meanwhile, Bitcoin transaction gross profit stood at $45 million, up by 22% year-over-year, with the firm selling $2.42 billion worth of BTC to customers via Cash App.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin is up 170% since the ECB called its \u2018last gasp\u2019 at $16.4K"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is lining up an \u201cearly bull market\u201d as a unique chart feature plays out for the first time in history.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Dec. 7, entrepreneur Alistair Milne drew attention to Bitcoin\u2019s first ever weekly golden cross.\n\nBitcoin goes from death cross to golden cross in 10 months\n\nRecent BTC price upside has delivered considerable profits to various Bitcoin investor cohorts, but 165% year-to-date gains are now significant for another reason.\n\nShould current performance continue, Bitcoin will witness a crossover of two weekly moving averages (MAs), which have never delivered such a bull signal before.\n\nThe 50-week and 200-week MAs are key trendlines for Bitcoin traders and analysts alike. The latter is the ultimate bear market support level, and it has so far never decreased in value.\n\nThe 200-week MA made headlines earlier this year when the spot price fell below it in an unprecedented move.\n\nNow back above, BTC price strength is on the way to taking the 50-week MA trendline above the 200-week counterpart. Known as a \u201cgolden cross,\u201d on lower timeframes, this is considered a classic bullish signal, and for Milne, the impetus is that considerable upside could be in store should the phenomenon play out.\n\n\u201cThis bear market was the \u2018worst\u2019 in that we spent time under the 200-week moving average price (red) for the 1st time in Bitcoin\u2019s history,\u201d he commented.\n\n\u201cThe 50-week moving average will now soon cross back above the 200-week MA making a \u2018golden cross\u2019 for the 1st time. QED: Early bull market.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD 1-week chart with 50, 200MA. Source: TradingView\n\nData from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView suggests that BTC/USD could even achieve the weekly golden cross before the end of 2023.\n\nBearish BTC price predictions endure\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, not every popular market commentator is bullish on Bitcoin after its swift march to $44,000 this week.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin HODL Waves: 2020 bull market buyers now control 16% of supply\n\nSome believe that buyer momentum is exhausted and that powerful, large-volume sellers are still able to drive the market significantly lower.\n\nAmong them is popular trader Crypto Chase, who revealed a short BTC position as Bitcoin crossed $43,000. What comes next, he warned, could involve a trip all the way to the low $20,000 range.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not changed bias. I\u2019m still bearish from the 40\u2019s looking for low 30\u2019s or even low 20\u2019s before new ATH\u2019s, and that\u2019s where I\u2019m at atm,\u201d part of X analysis read on the day.\n\nCrypto Chase added that only a move to new all-time highs, or ATHs, would change the prognosis, but that he \u201cdid not believe\u201d this to be on the way.\n\nHe is not alone. Still holding firm on this even more bearish BTC price prediction is controversial trader Il Capo of Crypto, who maintains that $12,000 is Bitcoin\u2019s true bottom target.\n\nIn a post to Telegram channel subscribers on Dec. 1, he called for a \u201cbig dump to $30k\u201331k with altcoins dumping about 30\u201340%.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would be the beginning of the capitulation event,\u201d he claimed.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a remarkable 15.7% price surge in the first six days of December. This surge has been heavily influenced by the anticipation of an imminent approval of a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. Senior Bloomberg ETF analysts have expressed a 90% probability for approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which is expected before Jan. 10.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin\u2019s recent price surge may not be as straightforward as it seems. Analysts have failed to consider the multiple rejections at $37,500 and $38,500 during the second half of November. These rejections have left professional traders, including market makers, questioning the market\u2019s strength, particularly from the perspective of derivatives metrics.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s inherent volatility explains pro traders\u2019 reduced appetite\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 7.6% rally to $37,965 on Nov. 15 resulted in disappointment as the movement fully retracted the following day. Similarly, between Nov. 20 and Nov. 21, Bitcoin's price declined by 5.3% after the $37,500 resistance proved more formidable than anticipated.\n\nWhile corrections are natural even during bullish markets, they explain why whales and market makers are avoiding leveraged long positions in these volatile conditions. Surprisingly, despite positive daily candles throughout this period, buyers using long leverage were forcefully liquidated, with losses totaling a staggering $390 million in the past five days.\n\nAlthough the Bitcoin futures premium on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) reached its highest level in two years, indicating excessive demand for long positions, this trend doesn't necessarily apply to all exchanges and client profiles. In some cases, top traders have reduced their long-to-short leverage ratio to the lowest levels seen in 30 days. This indicates a profit-taking movement and reduced demand for bullish bets above $40,000.\n\nBy consolidating positions across perpetual and quarterly futures contracts, a clearer insight can be gained into whether professional traders are leaning toward a bullish or bearish stance.\n\nExchanges\u2019 top traders BTC long-to-short ratio. Source: Coinglass\n\nStarting on Dec. 1, OKX's top traders favored long positions with a strong 3.8 ratio. However, as the price surged above $40,000, those long positions were closed. Currently, the ratio heavily favors shorts by 38%, marking the lowest level in over 30 days. This shift suggests that some significant players have stepped back from the current rally.\n\nHowever, the entire market doesn't share this sentiment. Binance's top traders have shown an opposing movement. On Dec. 1, their ratio favored longs by 16%, which has since increased to a 29% position skewed towards the bullish side. Nevertheless, the absence of leveraged longs among top traders is a positive sign, confirming that the rally has primarily been driven by spot market accumulation.\n\nRelated: Canadian crypto exchanges reach $1B in assets under management\n\nOptions data confirms that some whales are not buying into the rally\n\nTo determine whether traders were caught off-guard and currently hold short positions underwater, analysts should examine the balance between call (buy) and put (sell) options. A growing demand for put options typically indicates traders focusing on neutral-to-bearish price strategies.\n\nBTC options put-to-call volumes at OKX. Source: Laevitas.ch\n\nData from Bitcoin options at OKX reveals an increasing demand for puts relative to calls. This suggests that these whales and market makers might not have anticipated the price rally. Still, traders were not betting on a price decline as the indicator favored the call options in terms of volume. An excess demand for put (sell) options would have moved the metric above 1.0.\n\nBitcoin's rally toward $44,000 appears healthy, as no excessive leverage has been deployed. However, some significant players were taken by surprise, reducing their leverage longs and showing increased demand for put options simultaneously.\n\nAs Bitcoin's price remains above $42,000 in anticipation of a potential spot ETF approval in early January, the incentives for bulls to pressure those whales who chose not to participate in the recent rally grow stronger.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Price of Bitcoin has risen nearly 25% in the past month. And it seems crypto traders in South Korea could be playing a bigger role in the recent rally. Joining us now is Coindesk, executive Director of Global Content, Emily Parker. Emily, we miss you. Hi Jen, miss, you too. Hi, Lawrence, miss, you too. Thank you, miss you too, of course. All right, Evan Lee, talk to us about uh what's going on in the Korean market. What are some of the recent market trends we're seeing? Sure. So Korea is always a really important player in crypto. I think it doesn't get enough attention considering how important it is, but there's just been a few interesting trends recently that seem that the recent kind of rally and the recent, you know, they have a lot of people are saying crypto winter is finally over. Um Korea is a big part of that. Korea is an important player and you know, we've seen a few interesting data points about uh Korea playing an important part in this, I mean, one was this recent data point from CC data that was also reported by Bloomberg saying that the one recently overtook the dollar as the largest fiat trading pair, which is obviously very interesting. But I think, yeah, we're also seeing an very important trend of Korean retail traders pushing up the price of various all coins, those Korean retail traders from what I remember, it used to be that the Korean housewives trading on their apps uh playing around in in crypto uh from what I remember uh is that still the case where, where, who are these retail traders or are there any institutions involved as well? OK. So the institutional question is really interesting. Um The Korean market, the Korean crypto exchange market is basically retail, it's a retail spot market. Um It's not that there's like a specific law that restricts institutional trading. But yes, it's a largely retail market. And I think this is a really interesting point because um it's so big even though it's only retail, right? So like imagine what would happen if institutions got into the game. But yes, what we are seeing is retail trading. That's what this is. And do we know anything about those retail traders? I mean, is it, is it hobbyist? Is it like, do we know any anything at all yet? I'd have to look more closely at the data they give you like less than an anecdotal answer to that question. Let, let's talk about these alt coins and the significance in the Korean market. What alt coins are we seeing? The Korean retail traders uh interested in right now. Yeah. So I mean, this is something we've talked about before on the show and something that I think is really worth paying attention to that occasionally you'll see the world will see a surge in a specific coin. For example, we saw this with XRP. I remember we talked about this quite a lot and at first it's like, wait, what's going on with XRP? Why is it surging? Did something specific happen with XRP? And then you look at Korean exchange data and you realize that Korea is a big source for this surge. So this is not, this has been the case with various coins in the past, but there's charts that I want to just quickly pull up. So the first one just shows kind of how, you know, a lot of the retail trading energy in the Korean market is not based on Bitcoin and Ethereum only. You can see that there's um I don't know if we can pull that chart up real quick if we can, if we can see how much other coins other than Bitcoin and Ethereum have been playing a role in that. And then secondly, yeah, that, that one right there, that's by um Ko looking at daily trade volume on Korean exchanges. And again, and you can see a lot of action outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum. So, you know, all coins are a big part of sort of Korean trading culture. But I want to actually look at one other chart which looks specifically at blur. So I just want to quickly shout out to our friends at Dread that provided this chart and have been very helpful in analyzing the Korean market. But this is a chart showing Korea at the forefront of blur trading. Now, just to be clear, this is just one example of kind of the dominance of Korean retail traders in a specific token. And you know, I asked dread specifically why they think blur is surging like that. They said that the answers that they provided were basically that it has to do with the announcement of blur's blast project along with the announcement of the third staking program for the airdrop. But again, that doesn't really explain why Korea specifically is so enthusiastic about blur. But again, you can see why um Korea is so important in this in, in sort of the movement of the specific token. I I thought they were, they were enthusiastic about the nineties brit pop band blur. But OK, the um what, what is ultimately getting people in Korea? All the retail trader excited all of a sudden, what's bringing them to market? Has there been any regulatory changes specifically that you could pinpoint and say that's it, that's what caused it? No, a very simple answer. So I don't, I don't think the Korean regulatory environment is complicated and it sort of depends, there's different there's different opinions on it. Um, it's somewhere I wouldn't say it's extremely friendly. I wouldn't say it's extremely unfriendly and I would not say that the, the surge is due to, um, some recent regulatory change. I think it's just due to the fact that there is just such strong retail interest in the Korean crypto market. Um, and that's what's, what's, what's, what's, what's pushing this. So it's basically, I think we're seeing just a reflection of the overall global trend, this kind of, you know, which, which coin desk has written about the, the FOMO trend, the YOLO trend, you know, the, the idea that crypto winter is, is finally yielding to, to Crypto Spring. I think Korean retails are just retail traders are just getting in on that action. But no, I don't think there's been any significant recent regulatory change that would, that would explain what we're seeing on these charts. All right, Emily, we are gonna have to leave it there. Thank you for joining us and unpacking the significance of the Korean markets in this recent rally. And hopefully we will see you again."

The open interest surge has run parallel to Bitcoin\u2019s 26% gain over the same time, with Bitcoin currently trading at just over $44,000.\n\nCME\u2019s Bitcoin futures open interest reached $5.2 billion on Dec. 6. Source: Coinglass\n\nFrom Oct. 1\u201321, 2021, open interest in CME\u2019s Bitcoin futures surged from $1.46 billion to $5.45 billion.\n\nThe rapid uptick in open interest also coincided with a drastic price jump for Bitcoin, from $45,000 to $66,000.\n\nIG Australia analyst Tony Sycamore told Cointelegraph the open interest uptick shows a renewed interest in Bitcoin, but it doesn\u2019t explain how CME traders are positioned.\n\nSycamore pointed to CME\u2019s Nov. 28 report to the United States Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which showed the \u201cbig players\u201d on its platform were sitting net short at the time, with 20,724 short positions compared to 18,979 longs, Sycamore explained.\n\nFutures positions on CME had been net short as of Nov. 28. Source: CFTC\n\nUntil CME\u2019s latest report comes through on Tuesday, Dec. 12, Sycamore said investors won\u2019t be able to see exactly how the players at CME are positioned.\n\n\u201cWhat we can\u2019t see right now is whether the big players have gone from a net short to a net long, Sycamore said. \u201cIf we saw the market getting extremely long, you\u2019d be very worried about a snapback.

A decision on the ETFs is pinned for early January.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s got to be more driving this now. It\u2019s not just the ETF or halving speculation anymore. This is starting to take on a life of its own.\u201d\n\nSycamore said the recent Bitcoin rally could more closely be attributed to crypto\u2019s relationship with the macro environment, looking to the Federal Reserve\u2019s signal to begin cutting interest rates as a more significant driver of price action.\n\nIn November, CME nabbed the top spot in Bitcoin futures open interest from Binance, which many interpreted as a signal that traditional finance institutions were beginning to show a greater appetite for crypto products.\n\nMany analysts believe a spot ETF approval will result in a rapid upward price tick for Bitcoin, but not everyone is convinced the current rally can stick, with some predicting a \u201csell the news\u201d style event in the days and weeks following a potential approval.\n\nMagazine: This is your brain on crypto \u2014 Substance abuse grows among crypto traders"

        "content": "After spending much of 2023 stuck near $30,000, bitcoin broke above $40,000 last weekend and has remained above that level for much of this week. Now the next stop could be close to $50,000. Bitcoin has been moving more quickly and persistently for several weeks, notching new 2023 highs more frequently. After beginning November at about $34,000, it's kicked off December above $40,000 for the first time since April 2022 and is already up 16% for the month already. Chart analysts say the next level of resistance to watch is at about $48,000. \"Bitcoin seems to shoot past each resistance level we identify,\" said Rob Ginsberg, chart analyst at Wolfe Research. \"$48,000 is next on the list. As momentum turns positive again and overbought conditions remain sticky, we feel that level also puts up little fight.\" Other analysts identified similar levels. Julius de Kempenaer, senior technical analyst at StockCharts.com, is also eyeing $48,000 as the next level up. Will Tamplin, senior analyst at Fairlead Strategies, called it $48,600 \u2013 if bitcoin can successfully close above $42,200 two weeks in a row. On the downside, as a group the analysts are looking at a new support level of about $38,000. The price of bitcoin has continued to climb in recent weeks in large part on optimism surrounding a bitcoin ETF, which would lead to more maturation and institutionalization of the crypto asset class. Specifically, hype is growing as ETF issuers like BlackRock and Grayscale meet with the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2013 which has been rejecting bitcoin ETF applications for 10 years \u2013 and implement agency feedback into updated filings. \"Whether it's the macro backdrop, ETF excitement, geopolitical developments, FOMO or all the above, there is simply a level of momentum propelling these moves that we have not seen in awhile,\" Ginsberg said, referencing the \"fear of missing out.\" \"Bitcoin is out to 20-month highs relative to the top stocks in the market,\" Ginsberg said. \"We see this ratio pushing higher into year end as the likes of the Mag 7 continue to cool off and [cryptos] stay hot.\" The so-called Magnificent 7 stocks are Apple, Tesla, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.com. \"We'll be closely monitoring how much steam this rally has left,\" he added. \"For the time being, it looks like there's plenty.\" \u2014CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting"

Recent data from Capriole Investments underscores the severity of this change, with current Bitcoin electrical and production costs estimated at around $28,500 and $47,655, respectively, against Bitcoin\u2019s current median price of $43,000.\n\nHistorical analysis of the previous halvings in July 2016 and May 2020 reveals a consistent trend \u2013 both electrical and production costs doubled from their pre-halving bottom levels, setting a theoretical floor price for Bitcoin at about $41,000 in the upcoming cycle.\n\nAdditionally, the pattern of diminishing severity and volatility in the drawdown from all-time highs across Bitcoin\u2019s price cycles suggests a potential theoretical ceiling of $133k per Bitcoin, assuming a 70% drawdown from the top.\n\nThis information presents the potential for advantageous strategic planning for both miners and investors as they navigate the complexities of the rapidly approaching halving year."

The market cap for meme coins specifically is up 11% over 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin on Wednesday breached the $44,000 mark for the first time since April 2022 to bring its year-to-date gain to 165%. Optimism around potential regulatory approval for a spot bitcoin ETF has fueled the world's largest cryptocurrency, and its ripple effects have lifted the entire digital asset market. Ether, while not up with the rest of the market Wednesday, has gained 88% in 2023.\n\nDogecoin, meanwhile, jumped 17% in early trading to touch $0.10, with December 6 marking the 10-year anniversary of the shiba inu-themed coin's creation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe last time the token was trading at that level was almost exactly a year ago, on December 7, 2022, per CoinGecko.\n\nIt's not just the crypto stalwarts that are rallying. Meme tokens are also up, with Shiba Inu, Pepe, and Bonk have all seeing rallies in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe bullish sentiment has carried over into crypto-linked stocks, too. Shares of firm including Coinbase, MicroStrategy, Riot Platforms, and Marathon Digital have all seen triple-digit returns this year, above those of bitcoin.\n\nIn early trading Wednesday, MicroStrategy and Marathon Digital climbed more than 2.5%, while Riot Platforms moved nearly 1% higher.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe enthusiasm for bitcoin in particular is also coming in anticipation of next year's bitcoin halving event, expected to take place in April. The amount of bitcoin rewarded to miners will be cut in half at that time. In the 12 months following the last three halvings in 2012, 2016, and 2020, bitcoin skyrocketed 8,069%, 284%, and 559%, respectively.\n\nGiven the bullishness around coming spot ETFs and the halving, some industry veterans have forecasted that bitcoin can surpass the six-figure mark next year."

        "content": "The recovery of the bitcoin price to all-time highs will be \u201csignificantly quicker\u201d this cycle, according to the latest K33 Research report.\n\nThe drawdown has lasted for 755 days so far, currently around 36% off bitcoin\u2019s all-time high of around $69,000 set in November 2021. That compares to the 1,178 days spent before recovery post-2013 and the 1,092 days post-2017, K33 Senior Analyst Vetle Lunde and Vice President Anders Helseth noted.\n\n\u201cNeither of the past cycles saw institutional demand comparable to the current, with major financial institutions both participating in the space and vocally vouching for BTC -5.40% in public,\u201d the analysts said. \u201cIn 36 days, U.S. ETFs will receive their final verdict, and the market shows considerable demand to accumulate exposure ahead of anticipated launches,\u201d they added \u2014 arguing that the current run-up is caused by a real and compelling narrative.\n\nHowever, \u201cWhether we revisit the $69,000 all-time high or not depends on the genuine flows the actual ETF will bring in the first few weeks of trading. Otherwise, this sets things up for the classic \u2018sell-the-news\u2019 moment next year,\u201d analysts at QCP Capital warned today.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to approve a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S., having previously approved futures-based funds in 2021. The next deadlines for the SEC\u2019s decision to approve, reject or delay applications from firms including BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, WisdomTree, Invesco, Fidelity and Valkyrie fall in mid-January. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart recently said the window for potential spot bitcoin ETF approval was looking like it would fall between Jan. 5 and Jan. 10.\n\nData from institutional traders on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange also suggests they are not taking profit yet, with annualized premiums above 17% for bitcoin and ether and open interest at all-time highs, Lunde and Helseth noted. The premium is the difference between the spot price of an asset and the price of its futures.\n\nRetail traders 'not wild yet'\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 164% year-to-date price rise has not been mirrored by an increase in retail participation, Lunde and Helseth said. Website traffic data and exchange reports show retail demand is lower now than Q3 2022, they added.\n\nVisitors to crypto websites, often used as a proxy for retail interest, have declined about 50% compared to a year ago, aligning with Coinbase\u2019s Q3 report highlighting trading volume had continued to slide since 2021.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nGoogle search volumes for Bitcoin, Ethereum and other crypto-related terms show a similar trend, according to The Block\u2019s data dashboard.\n\nCrypto-native derivative trading in the offshore market is not showing signs of \u201cretail froth\u201d either, the analysts said, with funding rates still at neutral. Though there are some signs of increased retail appetite building long exposure, they are \u201ccertainly not at alarming levels yet,\u201d the K33 analysts added.\n\n\u201cThe fact that retail participation remains shallow points towards BTC having a substantial ability to gear up further if crypto again finds its way into the limelight,\u201d Lunde and Helseth argued.\n\nBitcoin's price rally continues\n\nBitcoin is currently trading at $43,747, according to The Block\u2019s price data. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap is now up over 16% over the last week and 25% over the past month, having returned to levels not seen since the Terra ecosystem crash in May 2022.\n\nIn terms of altcoins, ether is up 10% over the last week to more than $2,260 \u2014 an 86% rise year-to-date. Solana rose 5% over the same period \u2014 now up over 500% this year. Meanwhile, BNB traded flat last week amid Binance\u2019s legal and regulatory troubles, which have seen the cryptocurrency fall in 2023; it is down 6% year-to-date."

Traders purchasing the right to buy bitcoin at that level suggest they could be expecting the market price to keep rising.\n\nDeribit Chief Commercial Officer Luuk Strijers said the open contracts could have been sold as part of a $50,000 to $75,000 January call spread. \"This means that the traders may be expecting the market to expire anywhere between those strikes,\" Strijers told The Block.\n\nAccording to Deribit data, the derivatives exchange now has 3,684 bitcoin option calls outstanding for the $75,000 strike price, which have a notional value of around $162 million. This group of calls still outstanding is second only to those for the $50,000 strike price.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nThe aggregated open interest of bitcoin options across all major centralized crypto derivatives exchanges has reached an all-time high of $17.3 billion, according to The Block's Data Dashboard.\n\nAn increase in open interest suggests that new money is entering the market, indicating growing participation and potential liquidity.\n\nIn reference to the recent rally in the bitcoin market, Strijers said he attributes the surge to a confluence of factors including widespread optimism in anticipation of a possible decision from Securities and Exchange Commission about a spot bitcoin ETF, easing concerns following the settlement of Binance's legal matters, escalating geopolitical tensions, easing of inflation and the steady increase in institutional engagement."

        "title": "Self-Custody Bitcoin Wallet Bitkey, Built by Block, Inc., Launches Globally, Widening Access to True Financial Ownership - Business Wire",
        "content": "DISTRIBUTED-WORK-MODEL/OAKLAND, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bitkey, the self-custody bitcoin wallet built by Block, Inc. (NYSE: SQ), launched today in more than 95 countries across six continents, widening access to self-custody and empowering people around the world to truly own and manage their bitcoin easily and safely. Today, the vast majority of the millions of bitcoin owners1 keep their bitcoin in the custodial platforms or exchanges where they bought it, leaving them under the control of the custodian. Accessing self-custody solutions where people can truly own the keys to their bitcoin still often relies on a complex set of devices or long passwords that people need to remember to be able to recover their money in case of loss.\n\nBitkey includes a mobile app, hardware device, and a set of recovery tools in case the customer loses the phone, their hardware, or both. Built by the Proto team at Block, Bitkey is now available for pre-orders2 at bitkey.world, with shipping starting in early 2024. Thomas Templeton, who leads the Proto team, said:\n\n\u201cThe bitcoin decentralized payments network has the potential to create a more inclusive financial system for all, especially those who have traditionally been underserved. In the future, we believe customers will demand ownership and self-custody because it brings peace of mind, reduces dependence on any one entity, and puts individuals in control of their own bitcoin. With Bitkey, we are building a safe and easy way for people all around the world with different levels of experiences with bitcoin to take control of their finances on their terms.\u201d\n\nEase of use and peace of mind\n\nGareth is one of the customers part of Bitkey\u2019s external beta program, based in South Africa. He works in the banking sector and has some previous experience with other self-custody wallets as well as exchange-hosted wallets.\n\nAccording to Gareth, \u201cThe major benefit is that this is the first time my family would be comfortable engaging in self-custody. It is an experience that makes a healthy set of trade-offs to make bitcoin self custody accessible to all for the first time. There is still a huge amount of work to be done in terms of convincing and educating people that they should be self custodying their bitcoin, but this product certainly removes the most significant barrier to entry - complexity.\u201d\n\nA critical part of making self-custody more accessible is providing forgiving recovery experiences that prioritize both simple and secure paths to help customers recover their money when something goes wrong, without the burden of having to remember long passwords. According to Lindsey Grossman, Business Lead for Bitkey:\n\n\u201cPeople holding bitcoin on exchanges and custodial platforms today are often hesitant to move to self-custody wallets because they are nervous about making mistakes, especially with the historical requirement that you must safely guard 12 or 24-word long passwords called \u2018seed phrases\u2019. People have often felt stuck: worried about the lack of control they might experience on a custodial platform or exchange, yet also anxious about the unforgiving product experiences that exist in other self-custody wallets historically available. With Bitkey, we wanted to build a product that helps bring everyone to self-custody, combining robust security and recovery options, with a simple customer experience that puts them in control of their money.\u201d\n\nBitkey addresses this with a unique 2-of-3 multi-signature design that doesn\u2019t require customers to remember long passwords or seed phrases: it uses three keys to secure bitcoin, and any two keys working together are needed to move bitcoin or approve other security-related actions like initiating recovery or modifying security settings.\n\nBitkey puts two keys in customers\u2019 hands: one is in the mobile app, which enables customers to make bitcoin transactions easily on their mobile phone, track their balance, and manage security preferences; and the second customer-held key is in the hardware device, securely stored offline. The hardware key serves two main purposes: an extra layer of security to co-sign money movements (based on a customer-set limit); and enables recovery when customers lose their phone.\n\nA third key is on Bitkey\u2019s server and is used for only two things: to help customers move bitcoin with just their phone for the transactions they choose to make on the go without their hardware device, and to help customers recover their wallet if they lose their phone or hardware - or even both. Importantly, because Bitkey only has access to one, not two or three keys in this 2-of-3 multi-signature wallet, Bitkey cannot access or move a customer\u2019s bitcoin without them. This puts customers in true control of their money, while giving them peace of mind that they can recover their money if they lose something (for more information on how Bitkey\u2019s 2-of-3 multi-signature design and recovery tools works, read \u2018How it works page\u2019).\n\nHelping bring more bitcoin to self-custody\n\nPart of Bitkey\u2019s mission relies on connecting people across two worlds: the world of today\u2019s domestic or regional centralized fiat monetary systems, and bitcoin\u2019s distributed, borderless financial system. In June 2023, coinciding with the kick-off of the external beta program that launched that month, Bitkey announced its first two partnerships with Coinbase, a leading global exchange, and Cash App, a leading financial services app and part of the Block ecosystem, to help people easily and transfer their bitcoin off exchanges and custodial platforms, making the journey to self-custody easier.\n\nThanks to these partnerships, Bitkey customers are able to choose a partner they would like to transfer or buy bitcoin with and then initiate a transfer from that partner to self-custody in their Bitkey wallet - all through a seamless integration. The transfer and buy+transfer features will roll out in a staggered approach, starting with the ability to transfer existing bitcoin from Coinbase and Cash App available immediately upon the product\u2019s launch. These two partnerships are the first of more to come globally. More information on our partner integrations can be found in our blogpost \u2018Welcoming our first global partners: Coinbase and Cash App\u2019.\n\nAbout Bitkey\n\nBitkey is a self-custody bitcoin wallet with three parts \u2014 a mobile app to make transactions easily on the phone, a hardware device to protect savings securely offline, and a set of recovery tools in case customers lose their phone, hardware, or both. As an innovative multi-signature self-custody wallet, Bitkey provides innovative recovery tools that give customers multiple ways to recover their money, so they can take their bitcoin off exchanges and truly own and control it themselves, without the anxiety of guarding a long complex seed phrase. Bitkey provides the convenience of a mobile app, the security of hardware, and peace of mind that in case they lose something, customers can still recover their money. Bitkey is built by the Proto Team at Block, Inc. Proto\u2019s mission is to help accelerate the world\u2019s transition to a more open economy by making products that increase access and independence for everyone. Bitkey is the first of these.

        "content": "ORDI's price is up big time.\n\nORDI trading has also made the Bitcoin network more congested.\n\nORDI, a buzzy token on the Bitcoin blockchain, has registered a 204% gain since the start of December, placing it among the top performing crypto assets so far this month.\n\nThe reason? Growing enthusiasm for the Ordinals protocol \u2014 a way to give normally interchangeable micro units of Bitcoin unique identifiers \u2014 allowing them to be tracked, transferred, and imbued with individual meanings.\n\nThe growing interest in ORDI is mirrored in Bitcoin network\u2019s transaction fees. They\u2019re at their highest point in over two years as traders speculate on assets within the network\u2019s Ordinals ecosystem.\n\nAnd ORDI is at the centre of such speculation.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nORDI's price\n\nORDI is a BRC-20 token, a token standard made possible by the Ordinals protocol.\n\nBRC-20 tokens are similar to the ERC-20 standard which lets users create fungible tokens on Ethereum. Uniswap\u2019s governance token, UNI, is an example of an ERC-20 token.\n\nORDI was the first BRC-20 token created, and just like Bitcoin, it has a total supply of 21 million coins.\n\nOther major BRC-20 tokens include SATS, named after the smallest possible denomination of Bitcoin \u2014 a Satoshi \u2014 and DOMO, named after the pseudonymous developer who created the BRC-20 token standard.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nAlthough ORDI doesn\u2019t do anything at the moment, other BRC-20 tokens are starting to incorporate utility, such as token voting.\n\nBut ORDI has become the main proxy for the success of other assets built on the Ordinals protocol, and the potential the new technology brings to the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nTop crypto exchange Binance\u2019s decision to list ORDI for trading in early November has also contributed to its rise in popularity.\n\nORDI currently sits at a $1.4 billion market capitalisation, making it the 52nd-biggest crypto asset.\n\nWhat are Ordinals?\n\nThe Ordinals protocol was created by software engineer Casey Rodarmor in January. The protocol helps generate eponymous Ordinals, or also called Inscriptions. They represent the closest counterpart to Ethereum\u2019s non-fungible tokens within the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nUnlike many NFTs on Ethereum, Ordinals inscribe their data directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain, making them immutable.\n\nBut the protocol has split opinions within the Bitcoin community.\n\nSupporters say it heralds new use cases for the Bitcoin blockchain, which has received criticism in recent years due to its limited functionality compared to other blockchains such as Ethereum and Solana.\n\nBut detractors argue that Ordinals clog Bitcoin with excess data, and detract from Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s original vision of the blockchain as a payments network.\n\nBitcoin Frogs is currently the top-traded Ordinals collection, with an all time trading volume of over 935 BTC \u2014 or about $41 million.\n\nSo far, Bitcoin users have created over 46 million unique inscriptions through the Ordinals protocol, according to data from Ordinals blockchain explorer Ordiscan.\n\nAnd they\u2019re starting to receive mainstream attention.\n\nThis month, Sotheby\u2019s is auctioning artwork from BitcoinShrooms, a project on the Bitcoin Ordinals created by the artist known as Shroomtoshi.\n\nORDI drives Bitcoin fees \u2014 and congestion \u2014 higher\n\nSince ORDI lives on the Bitcoin blockchain, traders must pay fees in Bitcoin to buy and sell it.\n\nThe increased ORDI trading has made Bitcoin more congested, causing transaction fees to rise substantially. The cost to use Bitcoin now consistently sits at its highest level since 2021, according to data from BitInfoCharts.\n\nOver the past week, Bitcoin has generated $26.4 million from transaction fees according to DefiLlama data. That puts it ahead of popular DeFi protocols like Uniswap and Lido.\n\nData from mempool.space shows that there are currently over 245,000 unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions waiting to be processed.\n\nBut every day users of Bitcoin \u2014 like those in El Salvador where it\u2019s legal tender \u2014 typically rely on a scaling solution called the Lightning network. That makes Bitcoin transactions much faster and cheaper."

        "title": "BRC-20 style tokens are spreading to chains beyond Bitcoin. But why? - The Block",
        "content": "When the ORDI -8.33% token temporarily crossed a $1 billion market cap earlier this week, it became the first BRC-20 token to hit this milestone.\n\nFollowing in its wake are a number of other BRC-20 tokens, all hoping to be the next hyped up memecoin or coin du jour. Yet what\u2019s peculiar is that these tokens \u2014 which were created on Bitcoin through a workaround because it doesn\u2019t have native support for tokens \u2014 are now expanding to other chains that do support native tokens.\n\nOn Bitcoin, an inscription is where an individual satoshi \u2014 the smallest unit of bitcoin \u2014 gets associated with a piece of data, such as an image for an NFT or a token. This is done using a small amount of data storage space that\u2019s available when making transactions. Tokens made in this way on Bitcoin are called BRC-20 tokens and each token is part of its own collection.\n\nWhen brought to other chains, these token standards are given their own names, like PRC-20 on Polygon PoS, but it\u2019s the same core idea. Such tokens include Ethscriptions on Ethereum, Doginals on Dogecoin and Solana Inscriptions on Solana.\n\nThe blockchains Celo, Avalanche and Fantom have each seen more than 20 million inscriptions on their networks, while Polygon PoS counts 109 million inscriptions, according to a Dune Analytics dashboard created by Hildobby, a pseudonymous researcher at VC firm Dragonfly. In total there have been more than 200 million inscriptions for thousands of tokens across 11 blockchains other than Bitcoin.\n\nThis is also causing huge spikes in network activity on these chains. These blockchains are seeing major surges in the number of transactions made per day as users mint and transfer these tokens. For instance, the number of transactions being made per day on the Celo blockchain, as a seven-day moving average, has risen from 277,000 transactions per day to 3.7 million.\n\nThis activity has even caught the eye of Tron founder Justin Sun. He posted on X asking for community feedback on bringing support for inscriptions to Tron and enabling the creation of BRC-20 tokens on the network.\n\nBeyond this, NFTs are also being launched on other blockchains \u2014 that again, have native NFT support \u2014 using the same approach. For instance, Ethereum Punks has recreated the original CryptoPunk collection but using inscriptions.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nThe development has raised questions over why these tokens are spreading to other chains. These chains have their own native support for creating tokens so they don\u2019t need to apply this workaround. Plus, these tokens are arguably bad for the network since they aggressively expand the blockchain\u2019s data requirements, making it harder for those running nodes or validators on the networks \u2014 a reason why some Bitcoin developers are trying to get rid of inscriptions.\n\nEric Wall, co-founder of Bitcoin NFT collection Taproot Wizards, reckoned that these kinds of tokens are proving popular because they enable wider participation in the token mining process. He said this is somewhat similar to proof-of-work mining that is used for Bitcoin \u2014 something that\u2019s no longer particularly accessible to the average person.\n\n\u201cIf you make it so that the issuance of 100% of the coin supply of a BRC-20, SLP-20 or [Ethereum Virtual Machine]-equivalent derivative requires you to spam not one, not two, but several days (or even months!) of full blocks in any of these chains it means you now have [an] open-to-anyone issuance mechanism. A bit similar to Proof-of-Work mining issuance; we can call it \u201dProof-of-Wasted-Blockspace.\u201d he said on X.\n\nHedgedHog, a high-profile crypto trader and co-founder of eGirl Capital, said that speculation is likely taking place because these tokens are a new vertical with no previous pricing metrics or point of reference. \u201cI kind of think it's just flavor of the month,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are taking off but it's all speculation.\u201d\n\nAnother element is that transacting with inscription-based tokens can be cheaper than with tokens built natively on blockchains. This is because it's cheaper to move, for instance, Ethereum's native coin ether (ETH) \u2014 and the inscription-based token along with it \u2014 than using a token built natively on Ethereum using smart contracts.\n\n\"Inscription-based tokens are expanding to chains that have native token support because the inscriptions approach is 10x+ cheaper than using Smart Contracts and just as decentralized,\" said Tom Lehman, creator of Ethscriptions, claiming that smart contracts are unnecessary and a waste of money.\n\n"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin has continued its surge this week and is now trading for just under $44,000 a nearly 16% rise over the week. In the past month, it\u2019s up 25%\u2014enough of a jump that \u201cdigital gold\u201d has now flipped Meta to become the world\u2019s ninth most valuable asset by market capitalization.\n\nBut this is just the beginning, according to the analysts who spoke with Decrypt.\n\nThe asset\u2019s current movements are \u201ctypical of bull markets\u201d\u2014just like the one of 2020, Amberdata\u2019s director of derivatives Greg Magadini told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe reason for the quick price action, he added, is mainly down to excitement surrounding the potential launch of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF): every day, news drops about the process of the long-awaited investment vehicle.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence and Grayscale analysts have said that it\u2019s just a matter of time before a Bitcoin ETF finally hits the U.S. market. If it happens, a Bitcoin ETF would at last provide an easy way for traditional investors to gain exposure to BTC without directly buying and holding digital coins\u2014something that promises to bring an influx of fresh capital to Bitcoin.\n\nBut it isn't just ETF hype driving the rally; there are other factors at play. The prospect of falling interest rates\u2014which stood at historic highs last year and are soon expected to drop\u2014are helping, too.\n\n\u201cFundamentally speaking, lower interest rates helps Bitcoin gain value as well, since the opportunity cost of holding Bitcoin (a non-interest bearing asset) is diminished,\u201d said Magadini.\n\nThe U.S. central bank last year started aggressively hiking interest rates to get sky-high inflation under control. The actions had a negative impact on risk-on assets like stocks and crypto, which typically experience big price movements. That\u2019s because as interest rates rise, and money in a sense becomes more expensive to borrow, investors are more likely to hold onto their dollars instead of parking them in stocks or other similar assets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the beast might be tamed: Last week, Fed governor Christopher J. Waller said he was \u201cincreasingly confident\u201d things were on the right track, hinting that the central bank might start slashing rates soon.\n\nAnd this is likely working in Bitcoin\u2019s favor, OANDA senior market analyst Craig Erlam told Decrypt.\n\nAnd big money from institutional investors is helping push up the price, Messari research analyst Toe Bautista told Decrypt\u2014noting that the nearly $20 billion in total futures open interest for Bitcoin is closing in on the peak levels of November 2021.\n\n\u201cThe Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) leads this trend with an open interest of $5.1 billion, suggesting strong institutional engagement, as evidenced by the increase in options\u2019 open interest and inflows into traditional financial crypto instruments reaching yearly highs,\u201d he said.\n\nSo, where does it go from here? As Decrypt previously reported, analysts say that a recession next year or spot Bitcoin ETF denials could slow things down and reverse gains.\n\nBut experts are optimistic. \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen before, once Bitcoin gets moving, it can be hard to stop,\u201d OANDA's Erlam said.\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "content": "The potential approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the looming BTC mining reward halving and major regulatory and enforcement actions have a profound psychological effect on market prices.\n\nThis is a key takeaway from the Next Block Expo conference in Berlin, just as Bitcoin tipped past $42,000 for the first time in over a year.\n\nAnimoca Brands CEO Robby Yung, gumi Cryptos Capital managing partner Miko Matsumura, Binance regional manager Jonas J\u00fcnger, and Polkastarter business development lead Jo\u00e3o Leite weighed in on whether the current cryptocurrency bear market was coming to an end in a conversation with Cointelegraph.\n\nBitcoin halving is a psychological phenomenon\n\nConsidering the influence of the four-year cycle between Bitcoin (BTC) mining reward halvings, Matsumura likens the rhythm to that of a medieval battering ram.\n\n\u201cEvery four years, we swing the ram, and we smash. Four years is long enough that the people inside the castle think we\u2019ve gone away,\u201d the venture capitalist explains.\n\nRelated: Animoca\u2019s Yat Siu bullish on TON partnership as Bitcoin sets strong foundation for 2024\n\nMatsumura says that the halving cycle involves an inherent Schelling focal point mechanism, which is a game theory concept and social phenomenon where people or organizations can coordinate without communication.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to think about it as a psychological training phenomenon because each time it works, it inclines people to go with it the next time it happens.\u201d\n\nHe also suggests that Bitcoin\u2019s stock-to-flow model clearly shows that the actual cut in BTC supply is getting smaller with each halving, which means \u201cthe actual mathematical economic effect is smaller.\u201d\n\nCointelegraph\u2019s Gareth Jenkinson alongside Matsumura, Yung, J\u00fcnger and Leite during the Next Block Expo in Berlin. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nJ\u00fcnger echoes these sentiments by highlighting the deflationary mechanism of the Bitcoin protocol and that there\u2019s never talk of halving the fiat money supply.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just such a foreign concept to everything with fiat money that every time it occurs, it\u2019s just such a celebration of we\u2019re doing something completely different here.\u201d\n\nYung provides another interesting perspective, noting that while Animoca Brands has just two projects that directly work in the Bitcoin ecosystem out of some 500 investments, the preeminent blockchain remains \u201cvery impactful\u201d in what it does.\n\nThe Animoca CEO says the effect is similar to any business where interest rates, employment figures and other big macroeconomic signals have an impact even if they\u2019re not directly impacting you.\n\n\u201cSo, for us, I think Bitcoin is our central bank. With that in mind, I think of Ethereum as our investment bank.\u201d\n\nAfter all these years, I finally met @mikojava IRL when we got a chance to do a panel today at @nextblockexpo in Berlin. TL;DR? We're emerging from the bear market, and the honey badger is getting fat (ask Miko). pic.twitter.com/h0PslG3DK9 \u2014 Robby Yung \u29bf\u29bf\u29bf (@viewfromhk) December 5, 2023\n\nBitcoin ETFs and consumer protection\n\nThe pending approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States is being widely cited as a significant driver of BTC\u2019s recent appreciation in value into the mid $40,000 range. Yung offers a very short takeaway as to why this is the case:\n\n\u201cThe potential income from bitcoin ETFs is estimated to be $10 to $12 billion.\u201d\n\nFor an exchange like Binance, the potential for an immediate price spike is another important consideration that could test the systems of a number of global exchange operators.\n\n\u201cThese kinds of events are critical in running the exchange. It\u2019s a matter of succeed or fail in terms of providing the underlying infrastructure when the news goes out and you see that green wick,\u201d J\u00fcnger explains.\n\nRelated: Binance is now \u2018totally different\u2019: Interview with CEO Richard Teng\n\nBinance\u2019s regional director adds that consumer protection is set to fundamentally change with the provision of a spot Bitcoin ETF, which provides a compelling proposition that will drive investment into the asset class:\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, with this ETF vehicle, you will no longer have synthetic financial instruments that reflect the price of Bitcoin. You have an actual spot. It\u2019s all secured. It\u2019s all in custody.\u201d\n\nA cautious approach\n\nWhile there is a sense of euphoria and talk of crypto winter beginning to thaw, Leite offers a sobering perspective given Polkastarter\u2019s role in incubating and guiding cryptocurrency startups through a tough two years.\n\n\u201cDuring the bull market euphoria, a lot of companies overspent; they didn\u2019t build a treasury, which is super important,\u201d Leite explains. While those that have survived are looking ahead to better times, he advocates for a cautious approach:\n\n\u201cWe still advise them not to mind that everyone is excited. You must have a long-term intelligence; make sure that you have a runway for a few years.\u201d\n\nThe recent enforcement action against Binance and its subsequent $4.3 billion settlement with the U.S. Justice Department was also described as a positive development for the wider industry that assuages any fears of the future operations of the world\u2019s largest exchange by transaction volume.\n\nMagazine: The truth behind Cuba\u2019s Bitcoin revolution: An on-the-ground report"

Having faced unprecedented challenges and many powerful and vocal proponents to its uses and use cases with the latest being JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who stated he is deeply opposed to crypto. His argument being the same as countless others who attribute crime, money laundering and tax evasion which is ironic considering the US dollars role in crime across the globe. A story for another time.\n\nOf course, Bitcoin does have its vocal supporters with the likes of ARKS Cathy Wood and MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor. The failure of US banks this year may have been a blessing in disguise for the crypto industry. There are still clouds hovering over the industry, but this is becoming a normality with market participants hardly taking notice anymore, or so it may seem.\n\nBlackRock announce seed funding for Spot ETF of $100k which is small but it is just a first step with cash likely to change hands a lot quicker once an approval occurs. This shows commitment by BlackRock is ensuring that they are ready for a potential approval.\n\nBitcoin price outlook\n\nFrom a technical standpoint BTCUSD is approaching a key area of resistance around the $45k mark. However, options markets are hinting that Bitcoin will hit $50k by January with the Spot Bitcoin ETF expected to be approved early in January as well. The question I am grappling with is what will come first? A test of the $50k mark or the spot Bitcoin ETF approval?\n\nOpen interest for Bitcoin $50,000 strike calls is massive, as displayed in the chart below with options also suggesting the recent rally is just the beginning.\n\nOpen interest chart for Bitcoin"

        "title": "Polychain Capital and Hack VC Lead $18 Million Funding Round for Bitcoin Staking Protocol Babylon - Business Wire",
        "content": "PALO ALTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Babylon, the project that aims to build a Bitcoin-secured decentralized world, today announced the close of its $18 million funding round. The round was co-led by Polychain Capital and Hack VC, with participation from Framework Ventures, Polygon Ventures, Castle Island Ventures, OKX Ventures, Finality Capital, Breyer Capital, Symbolic Capital, IOSG Ventures and many other investors. The funds will be used to bolster the advancement of Babylon's Bitcoin Staking protocol, which converts the 21 million bitcoins into a decentralized staking asset for the Proof-of-Stake economy in a trustless way.\n\nProof-of-Stake (PoS) chains have historically been tethered to their native assets for security. However, as the majority of capital gravitates to established protocols, emerging chains often grapple with limited staked resources, undermining their security. In addition, to attract staking, chains typically have to implement very high inflation to pay for high staking rewards, which affects its token utility and economic health. This has resulted in a fragmented ecosystem where networks are forced to compete for a limited pool of staked capital.\n\nBabylon is the first marketplace to offer Bitcoin, the world\u2019s most decentralized asset, to the PoS world. Babylon\u2019s Bitcoin Staking Protocol provides a way for PoS chains to introduce Bitcoin as a staking asset. This allows PoS chains to acquire staking capital from the largest crypto asset in the world and enjoy high crypto-economic security that could be much higher than what the native token alone can achieve. In addition, since Bitcoin has been serving as a store of value without much yield, using Bitcoin as a staking asset can greatly reduce PoS chains\u2019 inflation pressure.\n\nIn July this year, Babylon published a litepaper outlining its pioneering concept of native trustless Bitcoin Staking. This concept allows Bitcoin holders to provide crypto-economic security to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) systems and earn PoS yields by staking their bitcoins. This innovation follows Nakamoto's spirit and does not require any soft/hard fork of the Bitcoin chain, nor any bridging, wrapping, and third party custody of the bitcoins. Recent data reinforces the pressing need for such an innovation and is highlighted in a recent Glassnode report, which found that a staggering 66% of Bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply, equivalent to 12.26 million BTC, remained dormant for a year. This indicates vast untapped potential, and the opportunity for positioning idle bitcoins to boost the economic security of PoS chains and decentralized applications (dApps) that rely on staking.\n\nWhat investors are saying\n\nLuke Pearson, General Partner at Polychain:\n\n\u201cPolychain is pleased to announce our participation in Babylon\u2019s recent funding round. Babylon boasts a world-class team with strong technical and academic expertise. We are thrilled to support them in creating Bitcoin staking, unlocking the largest digital asset to further blockchain security as a whole. Babylon's introduction of a Bitcoin staking protocol not only unlocks Bitcoin's potential but also paves the way for innovative Bitcoin-backed services and native blockchain advancements. We eagerly anticipate the ripple effects Babylon will create, positively influencing new chains and enhancing security across the entire blockchain landscape.\u201d\n\nAlex Pack, Managing Partner at HackVC:\n\n\u201c We are thrilled to have co-led Babylon\u2019s current round. Babylon is a significant development in the Bitcoin ecosystem. By creating the first protocol for Bitcoin staking and restaking, Babylon not only unlocks the largest blockchain asset, but can also make Bitcoin-backed security services (such as data availability service) possible for the broader blockchain ecosystem\"\n\nVance Spencer, co-founder Framework Ventures:\n\n\" We are incredibly excited to back Babylon and stake our BTC through their staking and restaking protocol. Staking is the next evolution for BTC and will bring native yield, utility, and an expansive market to its doorstep. Babylon's team is boldly pushing the frontier of what is possible for BTC forward\"\n\nSandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon:\n\n\" At Polygon, we are dedicated to supporting initiatives that tackle crucial challenges within the blockchain ecosystem and allow builders to build the next billion dollar companies. Babylon plays a crucial role as a marketplace connecting decentralized trust to yield, revolutionizing the staking landscape by enabling Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chains to stake not only native tokens but also Bitcoin as well. With Polygon zk proving technology those chains can get settlement on Ethereum and interconnectivity with multiple layer2 ecosystem. Babylon is becoming a contributor to Polygon CDK and the Polygon ecosystem more broadly. Babylon integrating their solution into Polygon's staking hub not only bolsters the security of emerging chains but also addresses inflationary pressures inherent in traditional staking models. This integration allows for a more equitable and efficient token economy. Developers will be able to use Babylon's solution by launching a CDK chain using Polygon CDK.\n\nOur mission at Polygon is to facilitate the creation of decentralized ecosystems atop Ethereum for any community. Babylon's vision aligns with our commitment to fostering decentralized ecosystems by offering diverse options for communities to seamlessly choose from. We are enthusiastic about the positive impact this collaboration will bring to the wider blockchain community.\"\n\nNic Carter, Founding Partner at Castle Island Ventures:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to be investing in Babylon and helping the team realize their vision. Babylon is a world class technical and academic team and we believe their innovations in Bitcoin restaking are a fundamental development in blockchain security. Bitcoin\u2019s Proof of Work security remains the gold standard among blockchains, and Babylon for the first time makes it available to other protocols. We\u2019ve seen the success of restaking elsewhere, and now Babylon unlocks the \u2018dry powder\u2019 of idle Bitcoin to provide trustless economic security to other blockchains. This is a significant positive development both for Bitcoin itself and other protocols aiming to inherit its security. At Castle Island we are excited to be witnessing a resurgence in Bitcoin-native innovation, and Babylon is emblematic of that vision.\u201d\n\nJeff Ren, Partner of OKX Ventures:\n\n\" OKX Ventures is excited about our investment in Babylon, a timely and pivotal innovator in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Our commitment reflects our support for groundbreaking developments and visionary founders in the industry. OKX has been a steadfast supporter and leader in the BTC and BRC20 ecosystems, and we see Babylon's approach to Bitcoin staking and restaking as a significant game-changer. We're looking forward to collaborating with them, leveraging their innovations to enhance BTC's utility and impact, particularly as the market shows renewed energy.\"\n\nIn 2022, Babylon successfully concluded its initial seed funding round, securing investments from IDG, DHVC, Breyer Capital, and other contributors.\n\nAbout Babylon\n\nBabylon is a blockchain project that designs security sharing protocols for the decentralized economy, founded in 2022 by Stanford Professor David Tse and Dr. Fisher Yu. Professor Tse is a member of the U.S. Academy of Engineering. He is renowned as the inventor of the legendary proportional-fair scheduling algorithm for wireless communications, and is the recipient of prestigious awards such as the IEEE Claude E. Shannon Award and the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal. The project is led by a team of consensus protocol researchers and experienced layer 1 engineers from around the world.\n\nBabylon's mission is to scale Bitcoin to secure the decentralized economy. To achieve this, Babylon utilizes the three primary facets of Bitcoin: its asset, its reliable timestamping service, and its most censorship-resistant blockspace in the world. To leverage these facets, Babylon is developing three innovative security-sharing protocols: Bitcoin Staking Protocol, Bitcoin Timestamping Protocol, and Bitcoin Data Availability Protocol. Through these pioneering protocols, Babylon envisions a more secure and decentralized future.\n\nFor more information about the Babylon project, please visit:\n\nWebsite: www.babylonchain.io I Twitter: https://twitter.com/babylon_chain\n\nDavid Tse, Co-founder: Acclaimed Professor of Engineering at Stanford University, whose previous work underpins the protocols of 3G/4G/5G networks.

Thanks to the legends @mfigge and @huuep for providing an early insight to me months ago about\u2026 pic.twitter.com/V6cOmY3sLF \u2014 OG General (@TheOG_General) December 8, 2023\n\nMagic Eden added support for BRC-20 tokens in June. The BRC-20 protocol lets Ordinals enthusiasts not only create inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain but also meme coins.\n\nOrdinals inscriptions\u2014similar to NFTs\u2014are digital assets inscribed on a satoshi, the smallest denomination of a Bitcoin. Inscribing media, including artwork, text, videos, and even video games on satoshis, is possible thanks to the Taproot upgrade launched on the Bitcoin network in November 2021.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to a Dune report, over 46 million Ordinals inscriptions have been created on the Bitcoin blockchain since Casey Rodarmor launched the Ordinals project in January.\n\nImage: @dataalways\n\nOn Wednesday, famed auction house Sotheby\u2019s announced the first sale of an Ordinals collection called \u201cBitcoin Shrooms\u201d by pseudonymous artist Shroomtoshi. Shroomtoshi called the collection a \u201cpixelated recap\u201d of the 13-year history of Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to Dune, over $106 million has been spent on fees related to Ordinals inscriptions. Similar projects have now popped up on other blockchains, like Ethscriptions on Ethereum and TON20 on the TON blockchain.\n\nThe popularity of Ordinals, however\u2014coupled with the associated increase in network traffic and fees\u2014has led to calls for their removal.\n\nOn Tuesday, Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr again decried Ordinals inscriptions, calling them spam on the Bitcoin network.\n\n\u201c\u2018Inscriptions\u2019 are exploiting a vulnerability in Bitcoin Core to spam the blockchain,\u201d Dashjr wrote on Twitter, adding that Bitcoin Core lets users limit the size of extra transaction data. \u201cBy obfuscating their data as program code, inscriptions bypass this limit.\u201d\n\nBitcoin purists like Dashjr are clearly not fans of stunts like filling block space with the classic video game Doom, which is well outside their conception of the number one blockchain by market capitalization. Even so, miners are reaping the benefits of the increase in demand.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pro-use of block space, and Ordinals right now seemed like a very good way for you to get that block space utilization because that's critical for my customers, who are miners,\u201d Luxor Technology founder and CEO Nick Hansen told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

Some investors even refer to the cryptocurrency as \u2018digital gold\u2019.\n\nView more\n\nOther cryptocurrencies have also seen significant price increases in recent days, with Ethereum (ETH) up more than 10 per cent over the last week, while Solano (SOL), Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) all up by between seven and 27 per cent in the last seven days.\n\nThe recovery has seen El Salvador \u2013 the country with the highest federal holdings of bitcoin \u2013 see its investment return a profit for the first time since 2021.\n\n\u201cEl Salvador\u2019s bitcoin investments are in the black,\u201d President Nayib Bukele posted on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n\u201cOf course, we have no intention of selling; that has never been our objective. We are fully aware that the price will continue to fluctuate in the future, this doesn\u2019t affect our long-term strategy.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price has been buoyed by hopes that a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) will be approved in the US, bringing larger institutional investors to the crypto space.\n\nSuch a move would be a validation of bitcoin as a mainstream asset, though rumours have been circulating for years without any bitcoin ETF being approved to date.\n\nShould the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fail to approve an ETF for the cryptocurrency, analysts warn it could send bitcoin tumbling down again.\n\n\u201cAn approval [from the SEC] is expected to bring short-term capital influx from the traditional finance investors, fueling the uptrend, while a rejection might trigger a short-term negative price action due to high expectations of approval by market participants,\u201d Matteo Greco, a research analyst at the digital asset investment firm Fineqia International, told The Independent.\n\n\u201cA rejection could prompt market participants to adjust their positions, potentially leading to a downward trend in January. Analysts remain confident, however, maintaining a 90 per cent probability of approval.\u201d"
