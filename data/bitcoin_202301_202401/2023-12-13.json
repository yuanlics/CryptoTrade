        "content": "While many investors have rejoiced at Bitcoin\u2019s recent price upswings, others are betting that crypto\u2019s second fiddle, Ether, will actually be the big winner of 2024.\n\nWhile loud voices on Crypto Twitter have predicted the start of another bull run with Bitcoin\u2019s recent resurgence, JPMorgan analysts just wrote in a new report that the coin is overbought.\n\nThe report took aim at one of the biggest drivers of Bitcoin\u2019s recent rosy performance: the possibility that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve several spot Bitcoin ETFs in early January.\n\nSome have predicted that the approval of spot ETFs from TradFi firms like BlackRock and Fidelity will drive billions of dollars of inflows to Bitcoin, but JPMorgan said this optimism is misplaced.\n\nThe bank pointed to weak demand for existing spot Bitcoin ETFs in Europe and Canada as evidence that the investment vehicle could fail to garner significant traction in the U.S. Instead of bringing in fresh capital, spot ETFs are likely to instead draw from capital already invested in Bitcoin-backed vehicles such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Bitcoin futures ETFs, or Bitcoin mining companies.\n\nIf the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin fund, in particular, is allowed to become a spot ETF, existing investors could take profits and remove as much as $2.7 billion from the exchange-traded fund. That could severely dent prices, the report said.\n\n\u2018Recapture market share\u2019\n\nThe report also claims that the upcoming Bitcoin halving, which will cut the mining reward in half, has already been priced in and will not give the coin the boost some expect.\n\nOn the other hand, the JPMorgan report said Ether could outperform Bitcoin in 2024 owing in part to an upcoming upgrade to the underlying Ethereum blockchain dubbed EIP-4844 or proto-danksharding. The update is meant to increase throughput and decrease gas fees charged to those who execute transactions on the network.\n\n\u201cWe believe that next year Ethereum will reassert itself and recapture market share within the crypto ecosystem,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nAs crypto prices have fallen over the past several months, funding dollars have dried up, and some VCs have cut the valuations of some of their biggest crypto bets by double digits. JPMorgan said it\u2019s seen a \u201creinvigoration\u201d of VC funding this quarter, although it still looks preliminary.\n\nStill, analysts think a revival in venture capital activity in the crypto industry could make a meaningful difference. \u201cTo the extent this improvement continues into the first quarter of 2024,\u201d the report continued, \u201cthat would represent a significant development that would herald in our opinion the end of the Crypto Winter.\u201d"

        "content": "If you\u2019re considering accepting cryptocurrency at your venture, it's important to know the benefits and disadvantages to offering this payment option. \u2014 Getty Images/ svetikd\n\nEl Salvador made headlines in September 2021 as the first country to accept bitcoin as its official legal tender. The announcement is a new milestone in the widespread adoption of cryptocurrency.\n\nSince then, however, the results have been mixed. On one hand, the IMF noted that risks related to the experiment have not been realized. On the other hand, the adoption of bitcoin by the Salvadoran population remains low\u2014and the country has lost around $60 million, according to CNBC.\n\nThese results suggest that cryptocurrency is still struggling to become mainstream. While more people are familiar with the concept of cryptocurrency, only a small number of customers feel confident using bitcoin and its counterparts for daily expenses. If you\u2019re considering accepting cryptocurrency at your venture, here are some benefits and disadvantages to offering this payment option.\n\n[Read more: How to Accept Bitcoin Payments]\n\nCryptocurrency offers better payment security\n\nThe pandemic led to a surge in credit card fraud, and since then, that type of fraud has continued to rise. Credit card fraud was the most common type of identity theft in 2022. And, unfortunately, small businesses are often the target of payment fraud and data breaches.\n\nCryptocurrency is considered more secure than credit and debit card payments. This is because cryptocurrencies do not need third-party verification. When a customer pays with cryptocurrency, their data isn\u2019t stored in a centralized hub where data breaches commonly occur. Rather, their information is stored in their crypto wallet. Plus, the blockchain general ledger is used to verify and record every transaction, making it very difficult, if not impossible, to steal someone\u2019s identity.\n\n[Read more: What Small Businesses Need to Know About Blockchain]\n\nCryptocurrency transactions are irreversible\n\nOnce a cryptocurrency payment goes through, it is permanent. This can be a double-edged sword for small businesses. \u201cTransactions can be refunded only by the party receiving the funds. Businesses that accept Bitcoin should be prepared for the possibility of customers requesting refunds, and keep track of how much money each customer has paid,\u201d wrote Inc.\n\nOn one hand, cryptocurrency\u2019s irreversibility helps business owners better manage their cash flow. There are no chargebacks to worry about, and if someone requires a refund, the retailer has to manually pay them back. This forces your team to keep immaculate records.\n\nHowever, this process can also create inefficiency in your business operations and lots of additional work for your employees. If you have a ton of refunds during the holiday season, for instance, your team will need to divert time and attention toward returning payments individually.\n\nYou may consider accepting cryptocurrency for items over a certain dollar value, rather than for daily sales.\n\nPay lower fees\n\nMerchants are responsible for paying transaction fees, as well as setup fees for many payment processors. PayPal, for instance, charges close to 4% per transaction (and sometimes more). Cryptocurrencies charge much lower fees, if any. Some bitcoin exchanges offer fees under 1%.\n\nLikewise, if your business serves customers overseas, cryptocurrencies can help avoid international currency payment fees. This is because cryptocurrencies aren\u2019t tied to a country of origin or national bank. As a result, businesses don\u2019t wait for payments to clear a foreign bank or pay the costs.\n\nThere are tax implications\n\nThe IRS considers cryptocurrency to be \u201cproperty\u201d for tax purposes. This means that if you accept cryptocurrency, you must report it as gross income based on its fair market value when it was received. \u201cIn other words, each time you sell, buy, or use Bitcoin, you're subject to a capital gains tax,\u201d wrote Inc.\n\nThe IRS rules for accepting cryptocurrency also mean that you must keep track of the value for each cryptocurrency on the day it was received and the day it was sold. This can quickly get complicated, especially when you\u2019re managing several transactions a day. You may consider accepting cryptocurrency for items over a certain dollar value, rather than for daily sales.\n\nIt\u2019s still considered extremely risky\n\nCrypto fans appreciate that this currency is considered immune from inflation. Governments can\u2019t manipulate the value of cryptocurrencies, which is both a risk and a benefit. On one hand, cryptocurrencies are a hedge against monetary inflation. On the other hand, the value of bitcoin and other crypto is extremely volatile. In a three-month span, the volatility of bitcoin reached nearly 8%. For many business owners, that level of unpredictability makes cryptocurrency simply untenable.\n\nCO\u2014 aims to bring you inspiration from leading respected experts.

        "content": "JPMorgan expects ether to outperform bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in 2024, although the bank remains generally \"cautious\" about crypto markets in the coming year.\n\n\"We believe that next year Ethereum ETH -6.09% will re-assert itself and recapture market share within the crypto ecosystem,\" JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note on Wednesday. \"The main catalyst is the EIP-4844 upgrade or Protodanksharding, which is expected to take place during the first half of 2024. We believe that this upgrade will likely prove a bigger step towards improving Ethereum network activity, thus helping Ethereum to outperform.\"\n\nProtodanksharding is an initial step toward the full implementation of Danksharding, a more efficient form of sharding for Ethereum. Unlike the originally planned sharding technique, Danksharding avoids the complex process of splitting Ethereum into multiple shard chains. Instead, it introduces data blobs, temporary data packets attached to blocks, capable of holding more data than blocks but not permanently stored or accessed by the Ethereum virtual machine.\n\nThe upgrade is particularly beneficial for Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism, JPMorgan analysts reiterated, as it provides an additional temporary data space to increase network throughput and reduce transaction fees for Layer 2 networks on Ethereum. In essence, data blobs enhance the efficiency of Layer 2 networks without altering the Ethereum block size.\n\nBitcoin halving priced in\n\nJPMorgan analysts say factors that are seen to be bullish for bitcoin next year, including the possible approval of spot ETFs and upcoming halving, are already priced in.\n\nThe analysts mentioned that after the 2020 halving, the ratio of bitcoin's market price to production cost decreased and said a similar move after the 2024 halving would be reasonable.\n\n\"And given the current ratio of the bitcoin price to production cost is around x2.0 at the moment, this would imply that the 2024 bitcoin halving event is largely in the price,\" the analysts concluded.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nDeFi's 'biggest disappointment'\n\nThe \"biggest disappointment\" of decentralized finance continues to be its inability to encroach into the traditional financial system, which is necessary for the crypto ecosystem to transition from crypto native to real world applications, according to JPMorgan analysts.\n\n\"The biggest applications of blockchain to traditional finance, i.e. overnight repo transactions via smart contracts in blockchain platforms hosted by companies such as Broadridge and JPMorgan, take place outside public blockchains,\" the analysts said. In addition, tokenization is evolving \"rather slowly,\" and it remains at a \"largely experimental stage hindered by fragmentation, lack of cooperation and interoperability between platforms, delays in the introduction of central bank digital currencies by the Fed and the ECB and lack of regulations,\" they added.\n\nCrypto VC funding outlook\n\nWhile venture capital funding in the crypto space in the fourth quarter of this year has improved compared to a rather subdued rest of the year, the improvement appears \"rather tentative\" to JPMorgan analysts.\n\n\"That said, to the extent this improvement continues into the first quarter of 2024 that would represent a significant development that would herald in our opinion the end of the crypto winter,\" the analysts said."

Todaro had a Hold rating on Robinhood Markets, Inc (NASDAQ: HOOD).\n\nThe analyst surveyed over 20 financial and wealth advisors (RIAs), 75 Coinbase users, and over 200 individuals to determine who would buy a bitcoin ETF if approved and whether they would prefer bitcoin exposure via an ETF, bitcoin-linked stocks, trusts, or buying bitcoin directly on a crypto platform such as Coinbase and Robinhood.\n\nTodaro's survey results indicate that RIAs currently have limited bitcoin offerings for their clients; the majority answered their current bitcoin strategy is to guide clients to buy directly via crypto exchange (25%), crypto stocks (15%), or GBTC (10%), but most would favor an ETF if one existed, the majority of advisors expect 5-10% of their clients to own a bitcoin ETF is available in 2024 and 2025.\n\nAdvisors are seeing mostly disinterest from clients around bitcoin and an ETF, but nearly all expect interest to pick up if bitcoin prices continue to increase.\n\nTodaro's survey results found that anyone who has not already purchased Bitcoin is unlikely to buy a Bitcoin ETF. Only 11% of respondents who have not previously owned bitcoin described themselves as very likely or somewhat likely to buy a bitcoin ETF.\n\nTodaro's results indicate that an ETF launch is unlikely to bring in more capital flows unless this coincides with higher bitcoin prices/and other engagements, which spurs greater retail interest in the asset.\n\nAmong individuals who have owned bitcoin, respondents slightly preferred to buy bitcoin on a crypto exchange/platform than a prospective ETF through an equity brokerage, although this is age-dependent.\n\n40% would choose to purchase an ETF, while 49% preferred using a crypto platform, which suggests that an ETF will unlikely cannibalize COIN's higher-margin trading business.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Actions: COIN shares traded higher by 5.56% at $147.30 on the last check Wednesday.

        "content": "The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is Bitcoin (BTC -5.83%). And it's gotten a whole lot bigger in 2023. As of this writing, Bitcoin has a market cap of over $860 billion and the price is up 160% year to date.\n\nWhile a 160% gain is extraordinary, it's not necessarily surprising -- Bitcoin is following a pattern that's been going on for over a decade. Investors should first try to understand why there's a pattern. But once understood, there's reason to believe Bitcoin could double again in 2024, with an important caveat.\n\nWhy is there a Bitcoin pattern?\n\nInvestors in stocks would do well to disregard patterns. Stocks represent real-world businesses, and long-term price movements reflect what's going on in the business. There's no way some lines on a chart can predict the future for what these companies will do.\n\nBitcoin's pattern, however, is based on something going on in real life -- something that is predictable. And I'll explain. But I have to start at the top.\n\nAs a currency, Bitcoin is meant to change hands, paying for goods or services in theory. But because it's digital, computers have to process the transactions and keep track of it all.\n\nBitcoin is decentralized, which means there's no single centralized owner. Therefore, the computers processing transactions are doing so voluntarily. The process is called mining. And these volunteers do it because the system is set up to pay them Bitcoins for their efforts.\n\nThe Bitcoin network issues new Bitcoins to these miners, so there is modest inflation built into the network. There are over 19.5 million Bitcoins in circulation today. And at the current mining pace, about 900 new Bitcoins enter circulation daily.\n\nHowever, roughly every four years, the mining reward is cut by 50% -- this is known as the halving event. Therefore, there's a huge, sudden shock to the system. And this disruption is what has caused the aforementioned pattern in the past.\n\nWhy Bitcoin could double again in 2024\n\nThe next Bitcoin halving event should happen in the first half of 2024 based on the current pace of mining.\n\nIn past cycles, Bitcoin has seen huge gains in the year before the halving, the year of the halving, and the year after the halving. The second year after a halving has historically had a drop of 60% or more, as seen below.\n\nThis year is the year before the halving, and Bitcoin has followed the pattern with big gains. And that's why one would expect Bitcoin to continue its surge with big gains and new all-time highs in 2024.\n\nHow the entire pattern could fall apart\n\nI wouldn't be doing readers any service by simply pointing out a historical pattern and calling it a day. Even though Bitcoin's pattern has been predictable, there's something that could cause it to utterly disintegrate.\n\nI always talk about this in terms of supply and demand. The price of Bitcoin is rising, indicating that there are more buyers than sellers and that demand is higher than supply. When the supply gets cut in half, the imbalance is exacerbated and the price soars even more.\n\nBitcoin could skyrocket in 2024. This assumes that there will be consistently strong demand from investors. But this very human element is the thing that could unexpectedly change on a dime.\n\nI personally own some Bitcoin and I've been happy with my investment. But I'm still not satisfied with my ability to predict the human element. To best predict future demand, I wanted to see people actually using the cryptocurrency as, well, a currency. But it seems that for most, it's an investment.\n\nIf increasingly more people and businesses were adopting Bitcoin as a currency, I'd feel good about long-term demand. But as an investment, I'm much less sure. Changes in investors' perception could totally change market sentiment and the past Bitcoin pattern would fall apart.\n\nNo matter your personal view on the future of Bitcoin, I believe all investors can recognize things are volatile and subject to change. As mentioned, I do own some Bitcoin. But I believe all investors should still have a healthy appreciation of the risks, even though past cycles point to big gains for Bitcoin in 2024."

        "title": "Tesla and Block among Bitcoin-holding firms to get boost from accounting rule change in late 2024 - Fortune",
        "content": "The Financial Accounting Standards Board, an outfit known as FASB that helps create rules for corporate bookkeeping, published a bulletin on Wednesday about implementing a long-awaited rule change that will benefit firms that hold Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nUnder the current accounting regime, firms such as Tesla and Block that hold Bitcoin must report a loss in earnings reports if the digital asset drops in value during a given time. At the same time, they can\u2019t record a profit if the price goes up. In practice, this means that a company that bought Bitcoin at $25,000 and saw it dip to $20,000 must maintain the lower value on its balance sheet\u2014even if the price soars to $40,000 right after.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin, which jumped on the FASB news, was a little over $42,000 at midday on Wednesday. Tesla owns around 10,000 while Block has about 8,000, and as both firms acquired most or all of their Bitcoin holdings at a lower price, they stand to reap a gain when the new rules are enacted, according to FASB, \u201cfor fiscal years beginning after Dec. 15, 2024.\u201d\n\nThe biggest beneficiary of the rule change is set to be MicroStrategy, a onetime cybersecurity firm that pivoted to acquiring large amounts of Bitcoin several years ago. The firm says it currently owns nearly 160,000, which it acquired at an average cost of just under $30,000\u2014which at current prices would be a net of almost $2 billion.\n\nThe forthcoming rule changes have been expected for months, but the share price of MicroStrategy nonetheless jumped 5% on the news. Shares of Tesla and Block, whose Bitcoin holdings represent only a small portion of the value, were down slightly.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin, historically volatile, is up around 180% this year as the crypto market appears to be recovering from a wave of scandals and ongoing regulatory scrutiny. Bitcoin fell to a low of around $16,000 last December after reaching its all-time high of roughly $69,000 in the fall of 2021.\n\nThe FASB announcement also may encourage other corporations to include crypto as part of their corporate treasuries since the ability to record it at fair market value will eliminate a significant impediment to holding it.\n\n\u201cThis upgrade to accounting standards will facilitate the adoption of [Bitcoin] as a treasury reserve asset by corporations worldwide,\u201d MicroStrategy cofounder Michael Saylor wrote in response to the news.\n\nFASB\u2019s forthcoming update will be the first it\u2019s issued for crypto in nearly a decade. When the body first issued guidance for crypto, it classified digital assets as \u201cintangible\u201d and in the same category of trademarks and goodwill, which likewise are marked down in the event of a drop in value but not marked up if the value rises."

If you want to skip our discussion on the bitcoin industry, head directly to 5 Best Bitcoin Stocks To Invest In.\n\nIn November this year, bitcoin reached new highs and other top cryptocurrencies also experienced gains. The spike in cryptocurrency investments is attributed to the expectation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) potentially approving the first spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF) on a major U.S. exchange. At the same time, global regulators including the SEC are actively cracking down on digital assets, targeting crypto exchanges and high-profile executives such as Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX and Changpeng Zhao of Binance. However, with the historic settlement imposed by the U.S. Department of Justice on Binance, the cryptocurrency industry can potentially bring an end to a series of scandals and issues, according to Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN). Armstrong commented during an interview with CNBC\u2019s Joumanna Bercetche:\n\n\u201cThe enforcement action against Binance, that\u2019s allowing us to kind of turn the page on that and hopefully close that chapter of history. There are many crypto companies that are helping build the crypto economy and change our financial system globally. But many of them are still small startups. I think that regulatory clarity is going to help bring in more investment, especially from institutions.\"\n\nDon't Miss: 11 Most Profitable Cryptocurrency Stocks\n\nExperts in the cryptocurrency space predict a new bullish phase, as an increasing number of individuals express expectations for bitcoin to reach record levels in 2024, surpassing $100,000. Bitcoin has experienced a surge of over 120% in 2023, leading to widespread optimism that this momentum will persist into 2024. Pascal Gauthier, CEO of Ledger, told CNBC recently:\n\n\u201cIt feels that [2023] was a year to get ready for the bull run that is yet to come. But the sentiment is very hopeful for [2024] and 25.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nSimilarly, Vijay Ayyar, who serves as the vice president of international markets at the cryptocurrency exchange CoinDCX, shared with CNBC:\n\n\u201cA number of market participants are expecting a bull run some time after the halving, but given the ETF news, we could very well have a run before that leaving most investors on the sidelines. That could cause a massive upward run in the price.\u201d\n\nSee also: 12 Best Cryptocurrency Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nOn another positive note, Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD) is expanding its cryptocurrency trading feature to the European Union, aiming to tap into international markets for growth. The new crypto product enables customers to trade over 25 tokens, including popular ones like bitcoin, ether, ripple, cardano, solana, and polkadot. Robinhood plans to add more tokens and introduce features such as transfer and \"staking\" for earning crypto rewards in 2024. This move follows the company's recent announcement about launching stock trades for U.K. customers by early 2024, with a waitlist already open and promising yields of up to 5% on deposits.\n\nAt the end of October 2023, Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani expressed optimism about a bitcoin exchange-traded fund and said that the price of bitcoin could consequently reach $150,000 by 2025. The positive projection is approximately five times the present price and over twice the previous all-time high for bitcoin in November 2021. Chhugani also expects that the approval of the ETF would result in the allocation of up to 10% of bitcoin's circulating supply to ETFs. This approval would enable traditional investors to gain direct exposure to bitcoin through their investment portfolios.\n\nNevertheless, there are still individuals who heavily criticize cryptocurrencies. For example, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon on December 6 strongly criticized bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, stating during a Senate Banking Committee hearing that he has always been vehemently against crypto. Dimon expressed the view that cryptocurrencies should be banned, emphasizing concerns about their primary utility being linked to criminal activities such as money laundering, tax evasion, and drug trafficking. Despite his stance against cryptocurrencies, it's noteworthy that JPMorgan is actively engaged in blockchain, the underlying technology supporting the $1.6 trillion crypto industry.\n\nSome of the best crypto stocks include CME Group Inc.

        "content": "Finally, it's crucial to note that the implied volatility option traders are willing to pay is closely tied to the actual volatility that BTC is experiencing (realized volatility), which has hit new lows in 2023. This connection is often referred to as the Variance Risk Premium (VRP), and it has been widening since mid-October. Recently option traders have consistently been willing to pay a significant premium over realized volatility in BTC, anticipating the possibility of explosive movements."

        "title": "Accounting change makes it easier for companies to hold Bitcoin\u2014but will any do so? - Fortune",
        "content": "One of the fun parts of reporting on finance is that the subject is so broad and full of wonky niches that there is always something new to learn. Recently, this has included the process for \u201cuplisting\u201d a stock, which I wrote about last month, and this month it meant looking under the hood of corporate treasuries. As it turns out, treasury management is about much more than just keeping track of a company\u2019s incoming cash and paying the bills\u2014that\u2019s the accountant\u2019s job\u2014and instead involves strategic decisions about how to optimize the use of cash through short- and longer-term investments. Fortune 500\u2013style companies typically employ entire teams who do nothing but that. Which brings us to Bitcoin.\n\nRight now, there are only a handful of companies that include Bitcoin in their corporate treasuries alongside T-bills, commercial paper, foreign exchange, and whatever else. One reason for this is that right now crypto, from an accounting perspective, is poison on the balance sheet since firms can record losses but not gains. In practice, this means that if a company bought Bitcoin at $20,000 and it dropped to $15,000, it must announce an impairment\u2014a nasty sounding word\u2014that never goes away, even if Bitcoin shoots up to $50,000 the same year. Even if holding Bitcoin actually increases a firm\u2019s wealth, the PR and financial headaches that go with impairments mean it\u2019s likely not worth it.\n\nAll of this is about to change, though, since the body that sets standards for the accounting profession just updated the rules for crypto so that, as of next December, firms can mark Bitcoin gains on their balance sheet. If current crypto prices hold up, this is going to deliver a windfall to Tesla, Block, and the tiny number of firms that have been unafraid to hold Bitcoin. The question now is whether the new accounting rule will lead other big companies\u2014maybe from the finance or tech industry\u2014to put some of their treasury holdings into crypto.\n\nThere are reasons to be skeptical. In an insightful thread, accountant and former hedge fund guy James Lavish noted that, even if the accounting concern is no longer an issue, Bitcoin still remains very volatile, so most CEOs will stay away for fear of telling their shareholders the company\u2019s crypto holdings are down 30% (even if they double in value the next year). The only CEOs to buck this trend are founding executives who hold large blocks of shares, which makes them unafraid to make unconventional decisions\u2014as Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk and Block\u2019s Jack Dorsey did with their Bitcoin bets (which have paid off handsomely, by the way).\n\nThis perspective makes it hard to share the rah-rah enthusiasm of Michael Saylor, cofounder of MicroStrategy, whose corporate treasury of 174,500 Bitcoins makes it by far the biggest public company that holds crypto. Saylor\u2014whose social media profile is awash in bling and laser eyes\u2014on Wednesday predicted the new accounting ruling will \u201cfacilitate the adoption of $BTC as a treasury reserve asset by corporations worldwide.\u201d\n\nThat sounds overly optimistic, but at the same time, the accountant Lavish says we are likely to see the emergence of more top executives who like the idea of adding Bitcoin to their treasuries. That doesn\u2019t sound far-fetched\u2014and if even another 5% of big companies embrace Bitcoin, that would be a major validation of crypto. We will likely find out a year from now.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nWorldcoin has expanded its authentication program\u2014which has three tiers, with the iris-scanning orb at the top\u2014to more platforms, including Reddit and Shopify.

        "title": "Cardano (ADA): What It Is, How It Differs From Bitcoin - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is Cardano (ADA)?\n\nCardano (ADA) is a decentralized proof of stake (PoS) blockchain designed to be a more efficient alternative to proof of work (PoW) networks. It is intended to evolve into a system with multiple use cases, governed by those who have staked their cryptocurrency.\n\nCardano\u2019s cryptocurrency is named Ada after Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (1815\u20131852), commonly regarded as the first computer programmer. Ada is used in the blockchain\u2019s PoS consensus mechanism. It is given as a reward for work done for the blockchain or can be purchased on exchanges.\n\nKey Takeaways Cardano is a blockchain platform that was founded in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson. It was launched in 2017.\n\nCardano aims to be a decentralized application (dApp) development platform with a multi-asset ledger and verifiable smart contracts.\n\nCardano runs on the proof-of-stake Ouroboros consensus protocol using its native token, Ada.\n\nHistory of Cardano (ADA)\n\nCharles Hoskinson, an Ethereum co-founder, began developing Cardano in 2015 and launched the platform in 2017. Cardano has positioned itself as an alternative to Ethereum. Both platforms are used for similar applications, such as smart contracts, and aim to build a connected and decentralized system.\n\nCardano considers itself an updated version of Ethereum and has anointed itself a \u201cthird-generation\u201d platform compared with Ethereum\u2019s \u201csecond-generation\u201d credentials. The blockchain platform also has a goal of providing banking services to the world\u2019s unbanked.\n\nCardano vs. Bitcoin\n\nThere are several key differences between Bitcoin and Cardano. Bitcoin was developed to be a peer-to-peer payment system. Cardano is an ecosystem that allows other developers to create tokens, decentralized applications (dApps), or any other uses a scalable blockchain network can host.\n\nThe Cardano platform runs on the Ouroboros consensus protocol. Ouroboros, created by Cardano in its foundation phase, was the first proof of stake (PoS) protocol designed to reduce the energy expenditure required by proof of work (PoW) mining. It does this by eliminating the massive computing resources that the proof of work algorithm uses.\n\nCardano doesn\u2019t reward its cryptocurrency as an incentive in a competitive mining process like Bitcoin. This reduces the energy and waste footprints by not requiring large amounts of electricity to power computers specifically designed for mining. Cardano users can install compatible wallet software on their computers or devices, stake their Ada, and begin earning rewards for participating.\n\n\n\nAda is Cardano\u2019s digital currency, named after Augusta Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century countess and English mathematician recognized as the first computer programmer.\n\nWhat Is Cardano Staking?\n\nIn Cardano\u2019s PoS system, staking determines a node\u2019s capability to open blocks on the blockchain. A node\u2019s stake is equal to the amount of Ada it holds over the long term. A stake is an interest a pool participant holds, secured with Ada that is pledged. Pledged Ada cannot be used or spent by the holder because it is held as collateral for honest validation behavior. Users with pledged Ada are given rewards based on the amount of Ada they have staked.\n\nUsers join or create staking pools\u2014groups of Ada holders who have pledged their coins\u2014and work together to update the ledger, open new blocks, and earn rewards.\n\nHow Do Cardano Staking Pools Work?\n\nCardano uses the PoS consensus mechanism, in which users \u201cstake\u201d a coin for the opportunity to become a validator. Users can participate in the staking and validation process in two ways: You can stake your Ada in a pool or create your own. Stake pools are trusted server nodes that conduct the work of validating transactions. These pools can be either public or private. Public pools distribute rewards to members based on how much Ada they have staked. Private pools, as the name suggests, give rewards to the owner(s).\n\nA stake pool must be run by an operator with the knowledge and skills to maintain the stake pool by renting servers, monitoring the node, holding the pool key, and conducting other pool administration tasks.\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nCardano implemented smart contract support in 2021 with its Alonzo update. This testnet update was the first iteration of bringing the promised scalability and use cases to users. This update allowed users to create smart contracts and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and manage multiple assets. Future releases and forks will bring more capabilities to the mainnet.\n\nWhat Is the Best Place to Stake Cardano?\n\nThere are several staking pools you can choose from to stake your Ada. It\u2019s essential to thoroughly read through a pool\u2019s website, user reviews, complaints, or issues to be sure that you\u2019re joining a reputable pool.\n\nYou can also use the community-built tools ADApools.org, Cardanoscan.io, Pool.pm, Poolstats.org, or Pooltool.io to help you select a pool. You can also use the Yoroi, Exodus, or Binance wallets to stake your Ada. You can also use Daedalus, a full desktop application developed by IOHK that downloads a copy of the blockchain. Daedalus is a full node that acts as a wallet that verifies all transactions in its history and lets you choose a pool to join.\n\n\n\nFuture of Cardano\n\nCardano is designed to be developed in \u201ceras\u201d named after notable figures in poetry and computer science history: Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire. Basho is the era of scaling and optimization, intended to bring more capabilities to Cardano. As of 2023, Cardano is anticipating the transition from Basho to Voltaire.\n\nVoltaire is the final era for Cardano development, intended to bring voting and treasury management of the blockchain and network through previously introduced smart contract functionality and system improvements. When Voltaire is complete, IOHK\u2019s goal is to release the blockchain and network to the community, as it will be fully decentralized and able to be developed, maintained, and kept secure.\n\n\n\nWhere Do I Get Cardano (ADA)? You can buy Cardano (ADA) on cryptocurrency exchanges or by participating in the network.\n\nHow Do I Mine Cardano (ADA)? Cardano cannot be mined in the way that other cryptocurrencies can. Instead, it must be purchased on a cryptocurrency exchange or earned.\n\nWhat Is the Cardano (ADA) Market Cap? Cardano (ADA) had a market capitalization of about $22.2 billion on Dec. 13, 2023.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCardano is a decentralized PoS blockchain founded in 2015 and launched in 2017. It has positioned itself as an alternative to PoW blockchains like Bitcoin because it is more energy-efficient and scalable.\n\nThe plans behind Cardano\u2019s development are ambitious. Its developers see Cardano as eventually becoming fully decentralized when voting and treasury management of blockchain are added to its capabilities in the future.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have rallied this year, and the bull run is expected to continue into 2024 as investor sentiment remains high. Although Bitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s most prominent cryptocurrency, has declined more than 5% since Dec 11, it is still trading above the $41,000 mark.\n\nLast week, Bitcoin rallied briefly above $44,000 before hovering around the $42,000 mark on renewed optimism. On Dec 12, it surged above $42,000 briefly, following the release of the consumer price index (CPI) data before settling slightly above $41,000.\n\nLast year saw the crypto market taking a hit, primarily because of a couple of unfortunate events, namely the FTX bankruptcy following a major fraud and the Tera Luna crash.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE) and BNB (BNB) have staged a solid rebound this year. Year to date, Bitcoin has rallied more than 147%, while Ethereum, Cardano and Dogecoin have rallied 80.8%, 125.6% and 29.7%, respectively.\n\nThe rally continued for the first seven months of the year before stalling in August as investors failed to get a clear picture of the Federal Reserve\u2019s next course of action on interest rate hikes.\n\nAn increase in interest rates usually has a detrimental effect on growth-oriented sectors, which include technology, consumer discretionary industries and cryptocurrencies.\n\nHowever, the rally resumed in late October on renewed optimism that a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval for a Bitcoin ETF is on the anvil. This could play a key role in giving the crypto market a fresh boost.\n\nInvestors are presently anticipating the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the SEC, with expectations for this approval in as early as the first half of 2024.\n\nAlso, inflation has been steadily declining over the past several months. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 3.1% year over year in November, slower than October\u2019s jump of 3.2%. This has raised hopes that the Fed may likely end its monetary tightening campaign soon and start cutting rates in the first half of 2024, which definitely bodes well for the crypto market.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Choices\n\nBlock Inc.

        "title": "Bitcoin's Price Briefly Tops $43K as Federal Reserve Signals Rate Cuts Next Year - CoinDesk",
        "content": "Bitcoin popped above 43,000 very briefly after the Federal Reserve held its benchmark, fed funds rate steady for the third consecutive time. Joining us now to discuss is new edge wealth senior portfolio strategist and Principal Ben Emmons. Welcome back, Ben. Good morning Lawrence. Good to be back. Glad to see you. So, uh you know, we, we had the fed, keep its rates steady. But the real excitement happened afterwards when Fed chair, Jerome Powell spoke to the press spoke to everybody gave out a statement. Let's let's go over that because that seemed to really change the tone if you will about how the fed or it sounds as if the Fed might be changing its approach with inflation. Uh go in a little bit on that there. Tell us a little bit more about what Powell said and why it matters. Yeah, it was, I think very historic Lawrence because, you know, two weeks ago, he was at the Spelman College doing the speech and he in that speech on the record pushed back on speculation of rate cuts, you know, simply saying like this is premature and we're still much in the, in the stage here thinking of sufficiently restrictive policy to get inflation under control. But that first part of, of restrictive policy remained a bit in the press conference too. But when he went on, he said that, you know, they basically were discussing rate cuts at the FO MC meeting. They were also discussing that they should cut well before the inflation reaches 2%. And they were growing more confident in that inflation is going to get to that target. And then last year, he said also that the fat sugar rates, otherwise they would be too late if they get, if they wait too long and inflation reaches closer to 2% and then the count rate, it would be too late. So that's what we would call a pivot. And then that's that you, if you first say that you're going to not cut rates and then you're saying you're openly discussing rate cuts and that was the major change. I think that is why markets reacted so strongly seeing yields declining sharply, dollar weaker equity markets up, commodity markets up. So this is a very classic historic moment for markets where FED chair says like we do X but we actually are discussing why and this is the pivot and it changes a bunch of things we're seeing. For instance, this idea that the, the Fed might have conquered inflation without causing a recession and that it's even looking as you mentioned before to cutting rates. It looks like it's gonna be probably three rate cuts, uh, at least 75 basis points. Correct. Yeah, it's at least 75. That's in the forecast. That was a change too because before in September they only a forecast of 50 basis points. And you're right, like the, the, the fed feels comfortable to say that they can cut rates because they're getting close to their objectives. You know, both employment and inflation moving in the trajectory that they are forecasting. And therefore this recession isn't happening really because they kept rates long enough restrictive that they can, they can now start lowering them again next year. Now, some of this has been out there before that the New York fed Williams started that discussion and uh fed Governor Waller came about later and really infused that buzz around his rate cut. But ultimately that the fed puts it back into the, into the top block with more rate cuts. And then talking about that, they're open to rate cuts in the discussion that gives the market a lot of fuel to pricing even more. I think what will happen now. And this was the other interesting question at the press conference is about, you know, we're in an election year, right? And cutting rates in election year may be politically sensitive. Of course, Paul said that we're gonna do what's, what's the writing for the economy? Uh They're getting a forecast, right? So they can cut rates but then you get this term called front loading. And one of the reporters asked him about that, he stayed politically neutral, but he didn't dismiss and didn't push back on that either. So the market is taking this as a cue to say, you're not only going to cut rates, but you may be front loading them too and, and by front loading them, you mean allowing it to kind of go into detail by what that, what that means and, and it's, and tie it in to the, the election and, and what Powell might be trying to do here potentially or the fed rather. Yeah, if you go back in time. So it's starting in March of 2022 when they did the first rate hike the following month, the the term front loading came really quickly that narrative because they recognized inflation was running away from them going up too quickly. And so they started ratcheting up the rate during that summer of 2022. And board was really out with that term. We have to front load policy. We have to hike more quicker, faster to get a restrictive rate and put pressure on inflation. Now, it's the opposite situation. And so if inflation is moving now faster than what they had anticipating, they have to do also this front loading of, of rate cuts because otherwise they may undershoot the inflation target. Ironically, after all the inflation that we have, we may not get a potential undershoot of the inflation target. And so in a political year, like next year, I think the two dynamics there, Lawrence one. Yeah, you do. What's right for the economy, right? Because if you get inflation, it gets too low, it cannot be a good thing either for the economy. So you cut rates. Secondly, it probably has something to do with the election if you're cutting right in front of the presidential election, that probably is not a very good thing to do. So that gives you some reason to do it sooner. So I think if you summarize it all together, you say front loading means in this context, they're gonna start lightly cutting rates by either in March or May and may do that with, with an increment of of 50 basis points instead of 25 and then maybe do it out of 20 or 25 in the summer. And that it means that front loading, the easing, meaning all those rates that they forecast are coming sooner in the year than, than rather than later. Well, you kind of answered the, the question I was going to ask you about, you know, before this recent move, Goldman Sachs said they were predicting two rate cuts for next year. Now this morning, we're hearing some analysts say uh three, where do you think we're going to land? Yeah. So the market is very extended now, right? And, and, and the economist jump on board with the market because they're looking at this and is getting off the message from power. So I think what I come down to is that the fed will probably meet at least three rate cuts that are priced in but potentially one more thereafter. Because back in June, in that forecast, they had 100 base points of cuts originally forecasted in, in their, in their outlook. I think that's where they ultimately land at 100 basis points. And I think this is probably, you know, also the, the the best middle of the road solution for this inflation rate as it starts declining, that they don't want this inflation rate to decline too fast and then they're too late. So I think 100 basis points is likely next year. So of course, our viewers are interested in crypto. How does let's tie this back into crypto because of course, Bitcoin is a risk on asset at least for now. Uh How do we, how should traders invest now in crypto? Should they invest? What, how, how should they approach crypto with this sort of pet fed pivot? Yeah, if you think of, of crypto and, and I'm gonna put a little bit maybe in the commodity space, all commodities are sensitive to interest rates, whether that's gold and metals or, or energy crypto is in that, in that similar sort of vein, it's very sensitive to interest rates and that has to do with just, I think money in itself, it also has to do with that. People connect Bitcoin with an alternative currency and that's always related to interest rates. So I think as rates go down, crypto prices go up as do gold prices go up as silver as it, as en energy going up as we speak. The other side of that, of course, is that you have the dollar which now start to weaken and if the fed does deliver 100 basis points of cuts, then the dollar will be weaker against most major currencies. And I think that too lifts crypto to a higher level. Lastly, I think it's also about financing in itself. So anything that you, you, you need to finance money with, you get a lower interest on that you can put into risky assets like crypto that will benefit that I think too that if you, you know the, the, the pending ETF for Bitcoin spot Bitcoin probably is boosted by this idea too, a lower rate environment is beneficial for a spot. Bitcoin ETF. I think so that I think all leads to this idea of that. Yeah, crypto reacts to interest rates quite sensitively and we could probably see, you know, maybe go back to 50 60,000 on Bitcoin. All right. And Ben, we can't stop talking about the spot, Bitcoin ETF here on the show and in the industry, uh JP Morgan recently said that if a spot Bitcoin ETF is approved, it's unlikely to spur major gains. That's, of course, the opposite of what a lot of the asset managers who have skin in the game are saying. And a lot of industry watchers. What do you think? Yeah, I think it's, it's coming, it's really, it's almost here if you will. Right. Like, there's been such a back and forth on between the SEC and, and the industry and the SEC is also recognizing that that Bitcoin and crypto is a real financial asset and people want to trade it, they want to transact in it, they want to use it, they want to have it as part of their portfolio. So it always has been about finding the right framework around an asset like crypto in order then to have ETF S based on Spot Bitcoin to really be available to the general public. So I think it's about here, there's some speculation when exactly I don't have insight on that. It's myself, but that it makes sense because we already seen, I believe spot Coin Bit Bitcoin, ETF S in Canada and have worked there to an extent that to that extent, it can work here too, it can work anywhere, right? It's just a matter of having the right framework of regulation around this, around Bitcoin, how it has to be, you know, operating just the same way as it would be for equity or bounty TF And I think this is where we, we're heading. So II I would say within the next year this, this Bitcoin ETF will be here. Do you think the price will rally on an approval or do you, do you think it's already priced in it? It could still rally more because once you have an actual ETF and the info start to come into that and we know that Bitcoin is a, is a basically a limited currency, right? It's limited supply. Yeah, then you're getting more buying. So it, it should drive up the price. How far? I don't know, but I definitely think it, it will underpin the price and it is therefore not fully priced. In. On the other hand, Bitcoin ETF will start trading kind of like a commodity ETF like I think of God as a gold ETF people buy it and trade it and go in and out. So you also get people who show it obviously and, and you get some flows. But I think initially to the to the run up of the actual launch, those those issuers think Blackrock think a lot of big issuers would have to accumulate Bitcoin in order to back it, right? So that's, I think why the price gets driven up. All right, Ben, we are going to have to leave it there. Thank you very much for joining us this morning. It's always a pleasure having you on the show. Thank you. It's great to be here. That was new edge wealth. Senior portfolio strategist and Principal Ben Emmons."

The currency now sits at $2,270. But its gains have lagged behind bitcoin, which has rocketed by around 154%.\n\nThe rally has largely been buttressed by optimism that a spot bitcoin ETF will get regulatory approval soon. But JPMorgan analysts are more skeptical about the bullish bets on bitcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrypto optimists believe a spot ETF approval would improve liquidity and lower the barrier of entry for more investors to invest in bitcoin without owning the currency. JPMorgan, however, thinks it's not so much new capital that would flow into the crypto as much as it is re-shuffled money from other crypto assets.\n\nAlso fueling the hype in bitcoin is the halving event scheduled for April next year, which tends to reduce the supply of the currency and lift prices. But the more bearish take by JPMorgan analysts is that the quadrennial event has been \"well factored\" into the current price, and the currency won't rally post-halving.\n\n\"We instead look for around 20% drop in the hash rate post halving as miners in higher cost locations or with less efficient hardware would be forced to exit the market,\" they wrote. \"This scenario would be more consistent with around $35k bitcoin price post halving.\""

Where spot bitcoin ETF proposals stand ahead of judgment day\n\nGrayscale itself said that it would be \u201cworking collaboratively and expeditiously with the SEC\u201d to achieve the regulatory approval needed.\n\nA potential Grayscale ETF would join other applicants in the race to get a bitcoin ETF out the door. Even traditional asset managers like BlackRock have tossed its hat in the ring, hoping to be one of the first.\n\nAt this point, there\u2019s a lot of optimism around the ETF decision, with Seyffart narrowing down a timetable for a potential decision. The SEC has until January 10 to make a decision on Ark and 21Shares\u2019 proposal, meaning that the window is centered around the days leading up.\n\nAs for the hope, Bloomberg analysts peg the chances of an approval by the January date to sit around 90%. Though some, notably ex-SEC staffer John Reed Stark, think that such a high likelihood is \u201cabsurd.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

The memos have pointed to discussions about redemption models to fund the exchange-traded fund.

        "content": "El Salvador says it's now making a profit on the Bitcoin investments at the center of President Nayib Bukele's economic and social reforms, a surprising turnaround for a country with a decades-long reputation for rampant gang violence and one of the highest homicide rates in the world.\n\nBukele said last week that the country is profiting from the investments he initiated over two years ago, posting on X, \"With the current #Bitcoin market price, if we were to sell our #Bitcoin, we would not only recover 100% of our investment but also make a profit of $3,620, 277.13 USD (as of this moment).\"\n\nIn 2021, El Salvador passed legislation to adopt Bitcoin as their legal tender, becoming the first country in the world to do so. The move became a key part of Bukele's dramatic social and economic reforms, with the president saying that the adoption of Bitcoin would \"grow the country's economy, providing access to credit, savings, investment and secure transactions.\"\n\nBukele tweeted in September 2021 that the country held 400 Bitcoin and announced that the country will be \"buying one #Bitcoin every day starting tomorrow.\"\n\nSome experts, however, have cautioned that Bitcoin's volatility makes it difficult to mitigate risk.\n\nBitcoin reached its all-time high in November 2021 at $68,789.63 -- two months after Bukele's initial investment into the coin. Nearly a year later, the coin's value plummeted nearly 75% to around $16,000, according to Coinbase, a popular cryptocurrency exchange platform. Bitcoin's value is currently about $41,000.\n\n\"Given the risks involved, you really would expect to have to double your money every year in cryptocurrency to justify the underlying risk,\" David Yermack, a professor of finance at NYU's Stern School of Business, told ABC News. \"They've really had very bad timing in the whole thing, and have only clawed their way back to even basically.\"\n\nDespite its apparent risk, the country has continued pushing cryptocurrency as a means toward economic reform, recently rolling out a new \"Freedom Visa\" program that would grant residency and a potential passport to 1,000 individuals per year that meet certain financial requirements.\n\nThe program is \"primarily designed for high-net-worth individuals or investors interested in contributing to building Bitcoin Country\" who have a \"financial threshold of $1 million in Bitcoin or USD,\" according to a government statement.\n\nMeanwhile, El Salvador's social reforms have also raised concerns that they've \"restricted and violated fundamental rights,\" according to a recent Amnesty International report.\n\nAn attendee wearing a Bitcoin necklace during the Adopting Bitcoin 2023 Summit in San Salvador, El Salvador, Nov. 7, 2023. Camilo Freedman/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nIn response to over 80 gang-related homicides in a three day period in March 2022, the country's \"security forces were empowered to arrest anyone suspected of belonging to a gang or providing support to gangs\" and \"suspended the rights to be informed immediately of the reason for detention,\" according to a 2022 U.S. State Department report.\n\nAccording to the U.S. report, over 52,000 individuals were \"arrested in the first six months of the state of exception, leading to allegations of overcrowding and inhuman treatment in the prisons.\"\n\nMari I, a 42-year-old El Salvadoran who declined to give her last name, told ABC News, \"We are talking about a real purge. El Salvador arrested more than 70,000 people including thousands of children,\" she said. \"[Bukele] has no idea what human rights means.\"\n\nFollowing the crackdown on crime, El Salvador reported 7.8 murders per 100,000 in 2022, one of the lowest in Latin America, down from 103.6 murders in 2015, one of the highest in the world.\n\nSome observers say the efforts have done little to enact meaningful change in the country.\n\nA second group of 2,000 detainees are moved to the mega-prison Terrorist Confinement Centre (CECOT), March 15, 2023, in Tecoluca, El Salvador. Presidencia El Salvador via Getty Images\n\n\"Because there's so much joy around being able to feel safe right now people don't want to think about what else might be happening behind the scenes that might really be mostly about supporting those who have always been in power in the country,\" said UCLA Professor Leisy Abrego, who was born in El Salvador.\n\nBukele has previously defended his administration from accusations he is governing in an authoritarian manner. Amid criticism from the Biden administration over his dismissal of judges on the Constitutional Court, Bukele tweeted \"[to] our friends in the International Community ... with all respect, we are cleaning our house ... and that's none of your business.\"\n\nA spokesperson's for Bukele's office did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.\n\nThe changes have drawn praise from some investors. Jack Mallers, the founder of Bitcoin payment provider Strike, says he believes the country is full of potential. Mallers says he advised Bukele on the country's cryptocurrency initiatives and Strike's global operations are based out of El Salvador.\n\n\"I liked the analogy that El Salvador is attempting to become, maybe the Latin American Singapore of sorts,\" he said. \"They're very tough on crime. They're very pro technology and innovation. They want to harbor entrepreneurs, businesses to innovate to create, they're very naturally rich and their resources, they're right on the water, they have beautiful land, they have a lot of natural resources they can utilize, and they've become an attraction to those that believe deeply in Bitcoin.\"\n\nPeople dance at Liberty Square in San Salvador, El Salvador, Dec. 1, 2023. Camilo Freedman/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe country recently attracted the 2023 Miss Universe pageant to the country's capital, San Salvador.\n\n\"I was skeptical when they first approached us, particularly about safety. We've all seen the news stories in the United States,\" Miss Universe CEO Amy Emmerich told ABC News. \"But they just kept saying that we need to come and see what we're doing here for yourselves.\"\n\nEmmerich added that the government of El Salvador \"more than proved themselves as a partner.\"\n\nBut Bukele has continued raising concerns among his critics. He is currently on a six month leave from the presidency to campaign for reelection, despite a previous constitutional prohibition that forbids a president from running a second consecutive term. In 2021, El Salvador's Supreme Court's Constitutional Chamber removed this ban, paving the way for Bukele to seek reelection.\n\nRoger Milano, a 36-year-old engineer in El Salvador, defended the government's reforms, telling ABC News, \"People can criticize as much as they want. I can walk freely in my city. It was not the case before. Bukele makes the difference between a criminal and a victim.\"\n\nABC News' Aicha El Hammar contributed to this report."

Bloomberg analysts give a 90% chance of a spot bitcoin ETF approval by Jan. 10.\n\nHougan said that he has met with regulators to discuss the firm\u2019s spot bitcoin filing in past months and that \u201call the firms\u201d are meeting with the SEC regularly.\n\nIndustry experts predict investors will pour billions into the funds once they are approved. Aspiring issuer VanEck, predicted $2.4 billion would flow in the first quarter after the funds' approval. Hougan sees more than $50 billion in the assets in the first five years after the ETFs launch and projected the funds will become among the \u201cmost successful ETF launches of all time.\u201d\n\nYet Hougan noted that as opposed to the launch of bitcoin futures ETFs, a few players will win the vast majority of market share, not just one firm.\n\n\u201cThere's this perception in ETF land that it's winner take all and that\u2019s built on a history where an ETF came to market first,\u201d he said. \u201c[But what] are the examples where ETFs lined up in Washington all at the same time? \u201cNone.\u201d\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF Race\n\nHougan expressed confidence that Bitwise, which has $10 million in assets under management in four ETFs, can compete with big firms such as BlackRock and Fidelity, saying that Bitwise\u2019s crypto-centric approach and work with financial advisors will set it apart.\n\nStory continues\n\nHougan added he would be surprised if every firm filing with the SEC actually launches a product\u2014even if they are all approved\u2014pointing to formidable infrastructure and legal hurdles.\n\n\u201cIt's pretty easy to file, but it's not as easy to launch, and it's not as easy to sustain,\" he said.\n\nThe biggest Bitwise ETF that trades on U.S. markets is the Bitwise Bitcoin Strategy Optimum Roll ETF (BITC) with $4.6 million under management.\n\nContact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2023 etf.com.

Considering that growth trend, he predicted that stablecoins in 2024 would only witness more trading volume and utility.\n\nBitwise isn\u2019t alone in its stablecoin-oriented bullishness.\n\nIn a Dec. 13 interview with CNBC, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said the demand for stablecoins is going to explode over the next few years as investors seek the safety of internet-enabled digital dollars.\n\n\u201cHuge appetite for dollars on the internet. That\u2019s a very big thing, and that\u2019s distinct from people who want a currency hedge, so to speak, or a store-of-value hedge.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, asset manager Van Eck predicted that the total stablecoin market cap would grow to reach $200 billion by the end of 2024.\n\nRelated: \u2018I\u2019m a big fan\u2019: Cantor Fitzgerald CEO praises Tether and Bitcoin\n\nRasmussen also sees a strong year ahead for Bitcoin, which he predicts will trade above $80,000 in 2024, with the expected launch of the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund and April\u2019s halving event acting as major catalysts for price growth.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin predictions for 2024 have varied widely across analysts and market commentators. In November, Bitcoin commentator Plan B said he expected the average price of Bitcoin to be at least $100,000 between 2024 and 2028. BitQuant, meanwhile, set a target price of around $250,000 after the halving in 2024. Some commentators even see the possibility of Bitcoin eventually going to $1 million.\n\nPrediction #1: Bitcoin will trade above $80,000, setting a new all-time high.\n\n\n\nThere are two major catalysts that will help get us there: the anticipated launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF in early 2024 and the halving of new bitcoin supply around the end of April. pic.twitter.com/KvHNx9XINz \u2014 Ryan Rasmussen (@RasterlyRock) December 13, 2023\n\nBitwise speculates that not only will the spot Bitcoin ETF be approved, but its launch will be the most successful ETF launch of all time, capturing $72 billion in assets under management within the next five years.\n\nBitwise is among 13 financial institutions applying for an approved spot Bitcoin ETF with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nEthereum is also predicted to improve significantly in 2024, with Bitwise betting on a 100% increase in revenue to $5 billion, adding that the EIP-4484 upgrade could bring gas costs to below $0.01 on the main network.\n\nOutside of crypto assets, Coinbase stands as the top TradFi contender to gain the most from the expected bull market of 2024, with Bitwise forecasting a 100% growth in revenue next year, something that will see it beat Wall Street expectations 10 times over.\n\nAI Eye: Deepfake K-Pop porn, woke Grok, \u2018OpenAI has a problem,\u2019 Fetch.AI"

        "title": "Are your lost bitcoins gone forever? Here's how you might be able to recover them - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "While Bitcoin spent the last decade soaring and making millionaires out of many people, other owners of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency have missed out. Why? One major reason: they\u2019ve lost access to their account. In fact, more than $100 billion in Bitcoin is estimated to be lost \u2013 but some is recoverable, says at least one firm.\n\nA 2020 report from Chainalysis, a forensics company, estimated that about 3.7 million bitcoins have been lost. That\u2019s out of a total of about 19.6 million in existence today, and a maximum supply of 21 million tokens when Bitcoin is fully mined. At the high end, that could be about 19 percent of today\u2019s supply that is gone forever. Or is it?\n\nTraders who have lost access to their Bitcoin or other digital currencies and assets may have the ability to recover them, at least with the help of one high-tech firm.\n\nBitcoins may be recoverable\n\nBitcoin\u2019s vaunted security cuts both ways, preventing the bad guys from getting your stash but also \u2013 and often \u2013 you, too!\n\nOne of the most highly touted aspects of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is their security. Not only are they nearly impossible to counterfeit, but transactions are almost irrevocable. Once someone has your bitcoins, they own them for keeps. It\u2019s a similar situation if you forget your password, it gets tossed out as part of a move or you throw away a hard drive holding the coins.\n\nBut Chris and Charlie Brooks, father-and-son founders of CryptoAssetRecovery.com, have been recovering Bitcoin and other digital assets since 2017 for people who have lost their passwords, despite the high security.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that about 2.5 percent of that approximately 20 percent of lost coins could still be recovered,\u201d says Chris Brooks. The figure amounts to as much as $4 billion in recoverable assets with Bitcoin trading near $44,000, he says.\n\nOf course, not all digital assets are recoverable. Corrupted hard drives or those that were thrown away are likely gone for good. But Crypto Asset Recovery says it has a decent chance of getting your lost loot back if you had encrypted private keys but forgot your password or if you had a failed hard drive with private keys.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, even if you have a wallet and they are able to pry it open, you may not have any coins in it at all. Former Bitcoin owners who dabbled in the cryptocurrency years ago may simply be hoping that they had long-lost treasure left on that old hard drive but weren\u2019t certain and decided to have a look just in case.\n\n\u201cAbout half the wallets we crack are empty,\u201d according to Chris and Charlie.\n\nHow your trapped crypto can be retrieved from a locked digital wallet\n\nAll kinds of digital assets could be trapped on a hard drive somewhere \u2013 Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin or any number of popular cryptocurrencies. But also increasingly trapped are NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, which might be digital art, a collectible, music or something else. These are all potentially recoverable.\n\nThe typical success story at Crypto Asset Recovery involves \u201can early Bitcoin adopter with a Blockchain crypto wallet,\u201d says Charlie Brooks. These wallets are more than half of what they see. An early enthusiast may have purchased a few coins and then forgotten about them. But now with a single bitcoin trading for big money, even just a few coins could be a nice haul.\n\nOnce they\u2019ve been contacted, Crypto Asset Recovery consults with customers, asks their best guesses for passwords and gets to work. Even if you only know part of your password or have a general idea of what it might be, the odds of accessing your lost crypto assets go up significantly.\n\nFrom there the team tries to \u201cbrute force\u201d your account, trying all kinds of potential passwords based on your suggestions.\n\n\u201cWe might run tens of millions to hundreds of billions of password variations before we get it, or we decide that it\u2019s not worth putting more computational resources into it,\u201d says Chris Brooks.\n\nWatch out for scammers advertising asset recovery services\n\nGiven the sensitive nature of the work, you may have to trust an asset recovery firm with potential passwords to your crypto account, which you may also be using elsewhere.\n\nThe promise of getting access to your lost bitcoins may entice even the most cynical owner to let down their guard around those who promise to help them retrieve their money. That\u2019s easy to do if you may have hundreds of thousands, even millions of dollars, locked in a digital wallet somewhere.\n\nBut officials caution consumers to carefully verify any asset recovery firm they hire. Many supposed firms are simply scammers who access your account and then run off with the proceeds, if they can even access your account. They may ask for a fee upfront to do the work, with the promise that you\u2019ll eventually get your cryptocurrency and then run off with that cash.\n\nThe scams are highly sophisticated, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Scammers may even issue press releases and fake testimonials that seem to vouch for their asset recovery services.\n\nOfficials point to several red flags that consumers should pay attention to:\n\nYou\u2019re charged a fee before any services are provided.\n\nThe physical address for the firm is not provided or it\u2019s located outside the U.S.\n\nThe firm does not have a phone number and you\u2019re asked to communicate through chat apps.\n\nThe firm asks for your bank account details so that the recovered money can be deposited there.\n\nThose are some of the most important signs, though the CFTC offers other warning signs and tips to stay safe.\n\n3 common ways crypto traders lose access to their coins\n\nCryptocurrency has grown immensely popular over the last few years, and it\u2019s a trendy trading vehicle for many young people who are new to investing. A 2021 Bankrate survey revealed that nearly half of millennial Americans were at least somewhat comfortable with owning cryptocurrencies. But regardless of age, crypto traders may be unfamiliar with the different ways these digital assets can be held, meaning they could lock themselves out of their account.\n\nCryptocurrency owners can lose access to their assets in a variety of ways, and here are some of the biggest.\n\n1. Not fully understanding how custody works\n\nUnlike traditional assets such as stocks or bonds that are always held for you at a brokerage, cryptocurrency can be held directly by owners using a cryptocurrency wallet or a trading firm may hold them on your behalf. But this difference is crucial to recovering your assets.\n\nIf a firm has custody of digital assets for you, then you can work through its system to recover access to your assets. So it\u2019s like a traditional investment firm in this way. You can verify your identity and the company will reset your password, and you\u2019re ready to roll again.\n\nBut if you take custody of your digital assets, you won\u2019t have that luxury. Unfortunately, many of those who are new to cryptocurrency don\u2019t understand when they\u2019ve taken custody of their assets and the responsibilities that entails. To access your self-custodied assets you\u2019ll need your seed phrase, a collection of 12 to 24 words generated by your crypto wallet.\n\nBecause of the potential dangers of holding assets yourself, Chris and Charlie Brooks strongly recommend that those new to cryptocurrency sign up with a custodial wallet. With a custodial wallet, you could contact your trading firm and access your cryptocurrency relatively easily.\n\n\u201cUnderstand what is required to manage a Bitcoin wallet before diving in,\u201d says Charlie.\n\n2. Losing your seed phrase\n\nPeople misunderstand the risks with crypto, says Charlie. \u201cThe much more likely risk for most people is that they lose their seed phrase \u2013 not that it\u2019s stolen from a hacker, though that happens, of course.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe largest misconception that gets people into trouble is not understanding that the seed phrase is a representation of your private key,\u201d says Chris Brooks. \u201cIf you lose that, you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d Many people don\u2019t realize that the seed phrase is that important, he says.\n\nThe seed phrase unlocks your wallet as well as all your crypto in the wallet. So it\u2019s vital that you maintain access to this seed phrase. \u201cIt\u2019s not like a bank account with a password that they can just reset,\u201d says Chris.\n\nMoving is a really common time for someone to lose their seed phrases, they say, but there\u2019s a simple solution.\n\n\u201cBuy a $30 safe from Amazon and store your seed phrases in there,\u201d says Charlie. \u201cYou need a place to keep them so that no one will think \u2018Hey, I need to throw this away.\u2019\u201d\n\n3. Self-sabotage\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest hurdles we face is that clients self-sabotage,\u201d says Chris.\n\nSelf-sabotage occurs when people try to fix the issues themselves and only succeed in making things worse.\n\n\u201cAbout 30 to 40 percent of the folks that we can work with have hard drive issues from an old laptop,\u201d says Chris. \u201cThey reformatted it or gave it away, for example.\u201d\n\nBut the solution here is relatively simple: \u201cStop touching stuff \u2013 don\u2019t reformat or reinstall a wallet,\u201d says Chris. Resist the urge to try to fix something, because you will likely end up making it worse.\n\nBottom line\n\nWhile it appears that a substantial portion of Bitcoin is lost to the sands of time, your crypto stash may not be a casualty. So it may be worth your time to see if you can recover your lost assets. And it\u2019s certainly always worthwhile to understand what you need to do to correctly manage your account so that you don\u2019t run into trouble in the future."

        "content": "This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin and ether. We\u2019ve also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia, a cryptocurrency is \u201ca digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.\u201d Cryptocurrency is a young asset class that has developed a reputation for price volatility however there are ETFs that could help mitigate risk for those investors seeking crypto exposure. During VettaFi\u2019s Alternatives Symposium on November 28th, industry experts discussed their positive outlook for crypto in 2024.\n\nBitcoin was the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Ether is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three with its launch in July 2015. XRP, which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We\u2019ve included it here for reference.\n\nThe third-largest market share of cryptocurrency, tether, is a token \u201cbacked by actual assets\u201d which includes one US dollar, one euro, or loans to affiliate companies and is controlled by the owners of Bitfinex. It\u2019s a controversial cryptocurrency due to its alleged manipulation of crypto pricing. It is called a \u201cstable coin\u201d because it was designed to always be worth $1.00. We do not chart it because its price rarely changes.\n\nFor a better understanding of crypto market cycles, read more here.\n\nThe Latest Cryptocurrencies Data (through December 12, 2023)\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price slipped to $41,000 over the last few days but remains up ~150% year to date. Explore two of the factors behind Bitcoin\u2019s recent surge.\n\nXRP\u2019s current price is little changed compared to last week and is currently up ~82% year to date.\n\nEther\u2019s price jumped during the past week, reaching almost as high as $2,400, but has since fallen to ~$2,200. ETH is now up ~83% year to date.\n\nAn index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. Ether tops the chart, i.e., the price of an ether has changed the most out of all three cryptocurrencies.\n\nETFs associated with cryptocurrencies include: ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITI), VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), and Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH).\n\nOriginally published on Advisor Perspectives.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel."

        "title": "1 Top Cryptocurrency to Buy Before It Soars 3,400%, According to Cathie Wood's Ark Invest - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Cathie Wood is the founder and chief executive officer of Ark Invest, an asset management company focused on disruptive technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrency. Wood and her team are optimistic about the decentralized finance market, in general, but they're especially bullish on Bitcoin (BTC -5.77%).\n\nArk published a Bitcoin valuation model earlier this year that outlined three price trajectories the digital currency could follow through the end of the decade. The bull case prices Bitcoin at $1.48 million (per coin) in 2030, implying more than 3,400% upside from its price of about $42,000 at the time this article was written.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\nThe investment thesis for Bitcoin\n\nThe investment thesis for Bitcoin is based on good old-fashioned supply and demand. Its source code limits supply to 21 million coins, and that scarcity is partially responsible for its value. Gold and other finite assets have value for the same reason. In fact, Bitcoin is sometimes called digital gold.\n\nThe other half of the equation is demand. When supply is fixed or highly constrained, the price of an asset moves in tandem with demand. Well, another word for demand is popularity, and Bitcoin has that in spades. It was the first widely adopted crypto asset and remains the most valuable by a wide margin. Bitcoin currently accounts for more than 50% of the collective value of all cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe real question is, in which direction will Bitcoin demand trend in the future: higher or lower? Cathie Wood sees demand intensifying in the years ahead.\n\nArk Invest's Bitcoin valuation model\n\nArk Invest recently published a Bitcoin valuation model that presents three possible price targets in 2030, as detailed below:\n\nBear case: $258,500, implying 515% upside\n\n$258,500, implying 515% upside Base case: $682,800, implying 1,525% upside\n\n$682,800, implying 1,525% upside Bull case: $1.48 million, implying 3,425% upside\n\nAll three scenarios are based on Bitcoin's ability to disrupt eight markets to varying degrees. In other words, Ark identifies eight sources of potential demand that could make Bitcoin more valuable in the future, as detailed below:\n\nCorporate treasuries: The cash and cash equivalents held by public and private companies. Ark believes Bitcoin will account for somewhere between 0% (bear) to 5% (bull) of corporate treasury holdings in 2030. Remittances: Funds sent from one person to another. The term is often used to describe money sent between family members in different countries. Ark believes Bitcoin will account for 5% (bear) to 25% (bull) of global remittance volume in 2030. Nation state treasuries: Financial assets owned by governments and primarily used to balance payments. Ark believes Bitcoin will account for 0% (bear) to 5% (bull) of global treasury reserves in 2030. Emerging market currencies: Money systems in countries undergoing robust economic expansion but don't yet possess all the qualities of a developed country. Ark believes Bitcoin will account for 0.5% (bear) to 10% (bull) of currency in emerging markets in 2030. Economic settlement: The sum of money used to settle transactions between clients of different financial institutions. Ark measures this opportunity against U.S. bank settlement volume, anticipating that Bitcoin will account for 1% (bear) to 10% (bull) of that total in 2030. HNWI assets: Financial assets owned by high-net-worth individuals (HNWI), a term usually applied to people with at least $1 million in investments. Ark believes Bitcoin will account for 1% (bear) to 5% (bull) of HNWI assets in 2030. Institutional assets: Invested assets managed by financial advisors, hedge funds, and endowments, among other types of institutional investors. Ark believes Bitcoin will account for 1% (bear) to 6.5% (bull) of institutional assets in 2030. Gold: Ark believes Bitcoin will be treated much like physical gold as a store of value, siphoning off 20% (bear) to 50% (bull) of funds that would have otherwise been invested in gold in 2030.\n\nOf those eight markets, Ark projects the largest opportunities as (1) institutional assets, (2) emerging market currencies, (3) gold alternatives, and (4) HNWI assets. Bitcoin is far from satisfying the base case estimates across those categories, let alone the bull case estimates. But some of Ark's assumptions appear plausible.\n\nFor instance, several large public companies have already incorporated Bitcoin into their treasury strategies, including Tesla, Block, MercadoLibre, and MicroStrategy. Several national governments also own Bitcoin.\n\nAdditionally, a recent survey from Fidelity found that, while penetration remains low among hedge funds and endowments, most financial advisors and HNWIs have purchased Bitcoin. Some analysts see that trend intensifying in the years ahead.\n\nPaul Maley, Deutsche Bank's global head of securities services, recently told Reuters that Bitcoin was \"bound to be seen as one of the priorities for investors and companies.\"\n\nBitcoin is worth buying for some investors, but with tempered expectations\n\nAttempting to value Bitcoin is difficult. Cryptocurrencies aren't the same as companies that generate cash or fixed-income securities, so they can't be evaluated in the same way as either. Ultimately, the extent to which Bitcoin disrupts the markets identified by Ark will depend on sentiment.\n\nHow popular will Bitcoin be with investors, companies, governments, and consumers in seven years? Answering that question with any degree of certainty is impossible. Bitcoin has only been around since 2009, so there's next to no historical precedent. For that reason, if forced to choose between Ark's three scenarios, I would choose the most conservative one.\n\nThe bear case hinges almost entirely on the idea that Bitcoin can disrupt the status quo with institutional assets and gold. That seems more likely than Bitcoin being widely adopted as an emerging market currency, settlement currency, or nation state reserve currency. To be clear, I'm not saying the 515% upside implied by the bear case is money in the bank, but rather, I'm identifying the scenario I see as most probable.\n\nHere's the bottom line: Cryptocurrency is a risky asset class. But I think investors should consider buying a small position in Bitcoin if they can (1) tolerate substantial volatility, (2) handle losing money, and (3) commit to holding their Bitcoin for at least five to seven years."

        "title": "2 Crypto Stocks to Snag Now Before They Really Take Off - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Heading into 2024, the biggest story in crypto continues to be Bitcoin (BTC -5.77%), which is up more than 150% this year. But the best may be yet to come. The arrival of the first spot Bitcoin ETF is now expected in the first quarter of 2024, and that will be followed by one of the most highly anticipated events in the crypto industry: the Bitcoin halving.\n\nWhile it's not a guarantee that these two catalysts will extend the Bitcoin rally into 2024, there is one way that you can get access to the potential upside of Bitcoin without having to deal with the risk and volatility of the crypto market. And that's by buying crypto stocks that are highly correlated with Bitcoin's price. Two of the best options right now are MicroStrategy (MSTR -5.06%) and Riot Platforms (RIOT -6.82%).\n\nMicroStrategy\n\nLet's start with MicroStrategy, which is the largest public holder of Bitcoin in the world, by a long shot. About 0.75% of the entire Bitcoin supply in the world is now on MicroStrategy's balance sheet.\n\nAt the end of November, MicroStrategy scooped up another 16,130 Bitcoins and now holds 174,530 Bitcoins. By way of comparison, that's 12 times more Bitcoin than held by Marathon Digital Holdings, the largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining company. And it's 17 times more Bitcoin than held by Coinbase Global, the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world.\n\nIn short, MicroStrategy is just about as good of a proxy for Bitcoin as you're going to get in the stock market. Right now, the market values MicroStrategy at about $9 billion. The amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet is valued at $7.5 billion. So most of the value of the company is based on the value of Bitcoin! This explains why MicroStrategy is up more than 300% this year. As long as the company continues to add to its Bitcoin position in 2024, its value should also continue to skyrocket.\n\nRiot Platforms\n\nWhile Riot Platforms is not the largest Bitcoin mining stock, it's generally acknowledged as among the best run and the most cost effective. In large part, this is due to Riot's strategy of continually upgrading to the most efficient and powerful Bitcoin mining rigs.\n\nEvery month, Riot Platforms releases a Bitcoin production update, and the numbers continue to look good. In November 2023, the amount of Bitcoin mined increased 21% on a month-over-month basis. At the same time, the number of mining rigs deployed increased by 6% on a month-over-month basis. There are plans to deploy even more mining rigs in 2024, and all signs point to Riot Platforms going all in on the Bitcoin halving next year.\n\nWhile Riot Platforms is up more than 350% this year, there may still be more room to run. According to J.P. Morgan, analyst price forecasts for Riot range as high as $23. That would be a 50% increase from today's price of a little moire than $15.\n\nAnd if you look at how Riot Platforms performed during the last Bitcoin halving in 2020, there's even more room for hope. The stock went from $2 in May 2020 to $10 by year-end. And then, in 2021, the stock went parabolic, more than quadrupling in value. Just keep in mind, though, that past results are no guarantee of future performance. But it's certainly instructive for seeing just how much of an impact the Bitcoin halving might have on Riot's price.\n\nBut is it too late?\n\nThe main caveat, of course, is that these stocks are not hidden gems. Everybody in the crypto industry knows about them. That's why both are up so much this year. So it could be the case that they have already gone up too far, too fast, and won't be able to replicate the same type of performance in 2024.\n\nBut I don't think that's the case. There are two strong catalysts in place for Bitcoin next year, and it's likely that Bitcoin will continue to gain in value next year. That's why I've specifically highlighted two stocks that are directly tied to Bitcoin's price. If Bitcoin is ready to rise even higher next year, then these two stocks are likely to go along for the ride."

        "title": "Is El Salvador's Bitcoin gambit finally paying off? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "El Salvador\u2019s controversial $117.5 million Bitcoin investment briefly swung into profitability this past week for the first time in two years.\n\nThis was a milestone of sorts because, until then, not much had gone right crypto-wise for the impoverished Central American nation.\n\nEl Salvador still hasn\u2019t come close to making Bitcoin (BTC) a medium of exchange as was anticipated when it made Bitcoin legal tender in September 2021, the world\u2019s first nation to take such a step.\n\nMoreover, it endured scathing criticism from many quarters, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as crypto prices worldwide plunged. In January 2022, the fund urged El Salvador to end its recognition of Bitcoin as legal tender.\n\nBut President Nayib Bukele simply dug in deeper during the crypto winter, making repeated BTC purchases throughout 2022. He followed a disciplined \u2014 or foolhardy, according to critics \u2014 dollar-cost-averaging strategy.\n\nIn early December, Bukele took a leave of absence to prepare for his 2024 election campaign, but he hopped on X last week for a victory lap of sorts and to take a jab at his \u201cnaysayers\u201d:\n\nEl Salvador's #Bitcoin investments are in the black!\n\n\n\nAfter literally thousands of articles and hit pieces that ridiculed our supposed losses, all of which were calculated based on #Bitcoin\u2019s market price at the time...\n\n\n\nWith the current #Bitcoin market price, if we were to sell\u2026 pic.twitter.com/gvl2GfQMfb \u2014 Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) December 4, 2023\n\nIt was a diverting sideshow, but it raised some real questions: Is the former president justified in declaring vindication given that El Salvador\u2019s BTC investment was only marginally profitable? (On Dec. 11, it slipped into the red again.)\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin still hasn\u2019t been widely adopted by the Salvadoran public to pay for goods and services, nor is it used by Salvadorans working overseas to send money home through remittances.\n\nRecent: How the crypto bull run can impact Web3 gaming beyond play-to-earn\n\nFinally, given that El Salvador remains a small, indebted, poor country, was it really responsible for its leaders to gamble taxpayer money on high-risk Bitcoin purchases?\n\n\u201cA bold and unprecedented move\u201d\n\nBukele has his defenders. El Salvador was in desperate economic straits back in 2021, and nothing seemed to be working.\n\n\u201cEl Salvador took a bold and unprecedented move in adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, which was roundly criticized by the IMF, among others,\u201d Nigel Green, CEO of the deVere Group, told Cointelegraph, adding:\n\n\u201cSomething new had to be done to end decades of financial instability and reliance on the U.S. dollar in the country. Nothing else has previously been successful in this regard.\u201d\n\nBukele \u201cdeclared Bitcoin legal tender and provided the citizens of El Salvador the opportunity to adopt an alternative financial system that is different from the dollar,\u201d Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether and chief technology officer at Bitfinex, told Cointelegraph. \u201cIt takes a lot of confidence and belief to withstand the pressure of international creditors and economic policymakers to stick with that resolve.\u201d\n\nAt one point in 2022, El Salvador\u2019s BTC investment portfolio was underwater by more than 50%. However, Bukele \u201cstuck to his guns, and he made it through,\u201d added David Tawil, president of ProChain Capital. Tawil expects other economically struggling nations to emulate El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin example. Argentina could be next.\n\nAt the time of writing, El Salvador has purchased 2,770 BTC in total at an average price of $42,436.22 per coin for a portfolio cost of $117.5 million, according to the \u201cNayib Bukele Portfolio Tracker,\u201d which follows the changes in El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin stash.\n\nIt was running an overall profit of $4.16 million \u2014 up 3.54% \u2014 as recently as Dec. 9, when BTC was selling for about $44,000. Bukele\u2019s first bulk BTC purchase was made on Sept. 6, 2021; his last was on Nov. 18, 2022, shortly after FTX imploded. There were 12 bulk purchases in all, after which Bukele still committed to buying 1 BTC per day.\n\nBut on Dec. 11, the portfolio dropped underwater again \u2014 down 1.15% \u2014 as BTC dipped below $42,000.\n\nIrresponsible governance?\n\nGiven the ongoing crypto market volatility, it isn\u2019t surprising that some ask whether Bitcoin is an appropriate investment for a sovereign government, let alone one so heavily indebted.\n\n\u201cSpeculating with public resources in a context in which extreme poverty and food insecurity are increasing is irresponsible,\u201d Lourdes Molina, senior economist at the Central American Institute for Fiscal Studies, told Cointelegraph. \u201cThe taxpayers\u2019 money allocated to the implementation of the Bitcoin Law has had a high opportunity cost for Salvadoran citizens.\u201d\n\nThose funds invested in Bitcoin should have been used instead to finance public goods and services, Molina added. The new law has had other unforeseen effects, too:\n\n\u201cThe economic risks derived from the implementation of the Bitcoin Law persist, particularly those linked to the possibility of turning the country into a tax haven and facilitating money laundering. Other risks have been contained by the non-mass use of the currency.\u201d\n\nGeorge Selgin, senior fellow and director emeritus of the Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives at the Cato Institute and professor emeritus of economics at the University of Georgia, told Cointelegraph that the country\u2019s monetary experiment, as initially conceived, went well beyond a big crypto investment:\n\n\u201cEl Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin scheme wasn\u2019t sold as a risky investment gambit \u2014 though it was certainly that. It was an attempt to achieve the \u2018Bitcoinization\u2019 of El Salvador\u2019s dollarized economy. And with respect to that end, it has been a complete flop.\u201d\n\nIn late 2022, Cointelegraph reporter Joseph Hall traveled to El Salvador to see if he could survive in the country using Bitcoin alone for payments. For two weeks, \u201cI tried to pay for every single thing with Bitcoin, or satoshis \u2014 small amounts of Bitcoin. Spoiler alert: I failed.\u201d\n\nIn El Salvador, the U.S. dollar remains the overwhelming payment \u201cmedium of choice,\u201d Selgin noted, \u201cfor all, save some Bitcoin tourists.\u201d It isn\u2019t used by Salvadorans living overseas to send money home, though remittances were billed as a natural use case for Bitcoin. \u201cWhy any other country would wish to follow such an example is beyond me,\u201d Selgin said.\n\nPart of a bigger plan\n\nStill, it\u2019s important to put the country\u2019s Bitcoin expenditures into a larger context. It is just one element in a plan to make El Salvador economically independent. Bukele also implemented a number of bond buyback programs to restore the country\u2019s debt profile and expanded the tax base \u201cby welcoming immigration and returning citizens to the country,\u201d Ardoino told Cointelegraph, adding:\n\n\u201cEl Salvador now has among the best-performing bonds among emerging market countries and is seen as a safe and attractive place to visit. The country\u2019s decision to adopt Bitcoin has brought them investment, tourism and international recognition.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn order for the project to get off the ground, [Bukele] had to pitch it with high \u2014 maybe excessive \u2014 expectations,\u201d Tawil told Cointelegraph. \u201cNo one really expected that it [BTC] would be a medium of exchange in the short term.\u201d\n\nThat part of the experiment was \u201cpremature,\u201d Tawil continued, mostly because Bitcoin still has usability shortcomings. \u201cIt\u2019s not simple enough yet \u2014 it\u2019s not as easy as a credit card.[...] But it will get easier,\u201d he predicted.\n\nIn the meantime, the positive return on El Salvador\u2019s BTC investment portfolio \u2014 if it persists \u2014 will likely catch the eye of other sovereign nations. Inflation-wracked Argentina, for one, has a new president, Javier Milei, who is well-disposed toward crypto, and he could borrow some elements from El Salvador\u2019s BTC pioneer program. Many people remain unbanked in Argentina, so Bitcoin could be helpful.\n\nFailure as a medium of exchange?\n\nThe lack of retail usage remains a sore point. Much was made two years back about El Salvador\u2019s efforts to encourage its citizens to use Bitcoin for retail purchases. The government spent millions distributing Chivo wallets and small amounts of (free) BTC to citizens, and in the end, the results were disappointing. Doesn\u2019t that detract from Bukele\u2019s legacy?\n\n\u201cWhenever you introduce something very different, you cannot expect instant success and instant results,\u201d answered Ardoino. \u201cPeople forget that when credit cards and debit cards were first introduced, it took 10 years for them to gain acceptance in Europe, and it was not until 20 years later that we saw full coverage.\u201d\n\nAs for investing in risky assets, \u201cGovernments make investments all the time, of course they do,\u201d said Green. \u201cBut El Salvador experienced significant ire \u2014 more than for anything else \u2014 for investing in Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWhy the IMF, an organization whose mission is to \u201cachieve sustainable growth and prosperity,\u201d fears a future-focused solution is \u201cbaffling,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe S&P 500 entered a bear market for the first time since March 2020,\u201d continued Green. \u201cMany investments were underwater,\u201d but \u201csavvy investors do not just panic sell during bear markets.\u201d\n\nA work in progress?\n\nOverall, is it still too early to say whether El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin journey is a success or failure?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mixed report, but then it always would be when launching a new legal and digital tender with no roadmap to do so,\u201d commented Green.\n\nTawil called the country\u2019s BTC gamble a \u201c100% success.\u201d Look at the cost basis for its BTC purchases \u2014 those \u201cmay never be seen again,\u201d at least by any sovereign nation. El Salvador was prescient, he believes.\n\nConversely, economist Selgin argued that the small profit made so far on El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin splurge is largely irrelevant. Things could have easily gone south:\n\n\u201cNo responsible government places risky bets with tax funds, and it is utterly irresponsible for a poor country to do so. Whether the gamble pays off or not is really beside the point.\u201d\n\nMolina also gave El Salvador low marks for its Bitcoin venture. \u201cTo this day, the arguments of attracting investment, generating employment or promoting financial inclusion have not been fulfilled. The only thing that has been socialized is the cost that citizens have had to assume,\u201d she said.\n\nMagazine: Terrorism & Israel-Gaza war weaponized to destroy crypto\n\nArdoino, by contrast, judged El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin pivot a \u201csuccess so far.\u201d Bitcoin has brought the country ancillary benefits in tourism and investment, \u201cand now El Salvador is developing an entire financial industry based on digital assets.[...] On the current trajectory, El Salvador is poised to be the new financial center for Latin America.\u201d\n\nGreen referenced a Sept. 8 report from Spanish banking giant Santander that lauded El Salvador for its new \u201cmarket friendly approach on policy management\u201d and an increasing willingness to repay debt. The rise in Salvadoran bond prices \u201calmost defies gravity,\u201d commented Santander, and the country may soon be able to access Eurobond capital markets.\n\nIt should also be remembered that El Salvador \u201chas a bleak history of defaulting on its international debt obligations,\u201d Green added, but \u201cis now unlikely to do so until at least 2029, according to most experts, which is pretty remarkable considering the history.\u201d"

        "content": "While Bitcoin\u2019s decentralization gives many the freedom to transfer assets without the risk of censorship, malicious actors are also taking advantage of the network\u2019s inherent privacy to move stolen funds.\n\nBefore being sanctioned by the United States Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in 2022, Tornado Cash was the prominent choice for hackers to launder stolen crypto. According to OFAC, over $7 billion in crypto assets have been laundered using the mixer since 2019. However, new findings from blockchain security firm CertiK show that there\u2019s been a shift in 2023.\n\nData analyzed by CertiK shows that more than $300 million in the stolen proceeds from 50 of the largest exploits of 2023 ended up in Bitcoin, as hackers try to find other places to move their ill-gotten gains after the increased regulatory scrutiny toward Tornado Cash.\n\nFunds lost from 50 of the largest crypto exploits in 2023. Source: CertiK\n\nCrypto mixers are protocols that are used to keep crypto transactions private. The tool mixes potentially identifiable funds with vast sums of other funds to anonymize transfers between wallet addresses.\n\nJoe Green, CertiK\u2019s quick response team head, told Cointelegraph that while decentralization and privacy in Bitcoin empower legitimate users, malicious actors can also exploit it for their gain. Green explained:\n\n\u201cThe Bitcoin ecosystem hosts a variety of privacy mixers that serve both privacy-conscious users and those with nefarious intentions. [...] While this scenario presents a challenge, it\u2019s important to recognize it as an intrinsic aspect of decentralized systems.\u201d\n\nThe shift into Bitcoin (BTC) mixers means that malicious actors are trying to find a way to ditch Tornado Cash because of regulatory sanctions. CertiK\u2019s analysis showed that Bitcoin mixers like Sinbad, which was sanctioned and shut down by U.S. authorities, have been the tool of choice for the infamous crypto hacker group Lazarus in 2023.\n\nRelated: KyberSwap hacker demands complete control over Kyber company\n\nAccording to CertiK, Bitcoin mixers employ a different approach to anonymizing transactions. With mixers like Tornado Cash, the mixer obfuscates the link between the sender and the receiver. However, the user can only withdraw the same amount they inserted into a new wallet, minus a fee.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin mixers allow users to deposit Bitcoin and distribute it across multiple wallets in different percentages, which further complicates tracking.\n\nHow Bitcoin mixers work. Source: CertiK\n\nWhile Tornado Cash remains a \u201cgo-to\u201d mixer for smaller-scale cybercrimes, CeriK highlighted that incidents involving $50 million and above have been pivoting toward Bitcoin-based laundering solutions. CertiK believes that this may be a trend and a preview of the challenges ahead for the crypto space.\n\nAs crypto laundering tactics evolve, there is an urgent need for more dynamic countermeasures in the battle against blockchain-based financial crime. Green explained:\n\n\u201cPerhaps the most effective countermeasure is comprehensive tracing of movements of \u2018dirty\u2019 funds. The sharing of information with relevant parties such as exchanges is an important step as well.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the security professional also believes that it\u2019s essential for stakeholders to be aware of the tactics that criminals employ so that they can combat them.\n\nMagazine: HTX hacked again for $30M, 100K Koreans test CBDC, Binance 2.0: Asia Express"

        "content": "Today, Bitcoin exchange River has unveiled its latest product, River Link, aiming to transform the way Bitcoin is sent and received on a global scale. River Link facilitates the seamless transfer of Bitcoin through text messages, offering users a straightforward and user-friendly experience that eliminates the complexities often associated with Bitcoin transactions.\n\nTraditionally, sending Bitcoin to new users involves the creation and exchange of a public address, a process that can be cumbersome for non-technical users. River Link seeks to overcome these challenges by leveraging the widespread use of messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, as well as social media websites such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok. With River Link, users can now send Bitcoin effortlessly to anyone, anywhere in the world, regardless of their technical understanding.\n\n\"River Link aims to build on the incredible rails that Bitcoin offers by allowing you to send Bitcoin to anyone over a text message, email, or direct message,\" said River CEO Alex Leishman. \u201cWe reimagined the Bitcoin transaction experience \u2014 embracing the simplicity of a user-centric app with Bitcoin\u2019s ethos of an open network.\u201d This flexibility ensures that recipients can claim their Bitcoin securely and conveniently, regardless of their jurisdiction or technical know-how.\n\nRiver envisions River Link as a significant step toward realizing its goal of positioning Bitcoin as the premier medium of exchange worldwide. \u201cThe traditional Bitcoin transaction experience is clunky. Other companies have attempted to solve this with siloed features that require both parties to use the same app,\u201d says Leishman. \u201cThis improves the transaction experience, but restricts user choice and dictates where people need to hold their Bitcoin.\u201d By providing a user-friendly and accessible platform for Bitcoin transactions, River aims to bring the benefits of Bitcoin to a broader audience, making it easier for individuals to engage in transactions.\n\nAddressing the common challenges associated with Bitcoin transactions, River's Chief Operating Officer, Julia Duzon, notes that River Link simplifies the multi-step process of paying or gifting Bitcoin. Duzon emphasizes the practical applications of River Link, stating, \"There is now an easier way to give your friend a birthday gift, pay a co-worker for lunch, or simply get your family into Bitcoin. With River Link, Bitcoin is another step closer to our vision of being the best medium of exchange in the world.\"\n\n\u201cSimply enter the amount of the River Link, text it to your friend, and they can claim the Bitcoin to any wallet,\u201d says Duzon. \u201cThis experience is truly frictionless, interoperable, and open \u2014 the way Bitcoin was always intended to be.\u201d\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "What to Expect from Bitcoin in 2024 - Morningstar",
        "content": "Valerio Baselli: Hello and welcome to Morningstar. 2024 could be a breakthrough year for digital assets and cryptocurrencies. To talk about that, today I'm joined by Ophelia Snyder. She is president and co-founder of 21Shares, the world's largest issuer of crypto exchange-traded products.\n\nSo, Ophelia, after the crypto winter experience in 2022, the crypto space has rebounded sharply, with Bitcoin up 140% for the year-to-date. Now, as 2024 approaches, investors are wondering whether this is just a flash in the pan or whether something fundamental has changed. What is your take on that? Do you think this positive trend on Bitcoin will continue overall next year?\n\nOphelia Snyder: I do. The market overall has changed quite significantly. There are a number of catalysts as we're heading into next year, which really do change the way crypto markets work and the Bitcoin order book and how we look at Bitcoin markets. Bitcoin halving is being coupled with an already quite illiquid supply, at the same point in time where we are expecting increased institutional adoption through the spot Bitcoin ETF, as well as increased adoption, potentially through another nation state, namely Argentina, incorporating Bitcoin more fully into their monetary policy. That combination of features is quite bullish in terms of providing both regulatory clarity as well as increased demand. The regulatory clarity is coming in a couple of formats. It's both a cleanup of some of the overhang from black swan events in the prior year, whether that's FTX and Binance. A lot of those situations are now becoming resolved. And I think that's kept a real dampener on sentiment in the market, which we're now seeing come off as a lot of those actions are now reaching their end. And it's positioning the market for a really interesting 2024.\n\nBaselli: Of course. You mentioned it, along with ARK Invest, 21Shares has the first application in the latest batch of bids to get a landmark spot Bitcoin ETF in the US, with BlackRock, Fidelity and others following. So, why would such approval be so important for the market? And what about being possibly the first issuer?\n\nSnyder: So, from a market perspective, the ETF is a really easy, simple to use on-ramp. And we've had them in other jurisdictions, especially in Europe for many years. Actually, the company is celebrating five years of offering these types of products. So, this is absolutely not our first try in this product category. And then, we're obviously a market leader in Europe.\n\nOne of the reasons this is such a big deal is that it helps provide both some of that regulatory clarity that I just mentioned, but also just an easier way for people to buy these products. And I think there's been a lot of focus on retail in the context of these ETFs. But actually, these are really important institutional tools. It provides simple solutions to custody, to trading, to tax, to tax reporting, to advisors' fiduciary obligations in America around how they do these allocations. That's a very, very big structural change.\n\nI think we'll likely see multiple issuers come to market hopefully early next year with products like these. And I think it's going to be very important to look at how these different issuers position themselves. I mean, for us, we've been doing this for many years. We were bringing that operational expertise to market and we're quite excited about it and hopefully seeing some real changes here.\n\nBaselli: Right. So institutional investment, regulation, artificial intelligence, which one of these trends will be dominant in the crypto space next year, in your view? And do you see any other possible drivers?\n\nSnyder: Regulations are an interesting one because I actually think that's a lot of what's happening right now. I think in the coming months we'll see that come to a head and complete its current cycle. But I think it's one of those things that once it's done, it's not going to be an ongoing driver of valuation. I think AI is really interesting because essentially AI and blockchain are very important compliments to each other and I think AI is taking over the world.\n\nThe reason I see them as so complimentary is that it's suddenly going to become really important to be able to prove that you're a person, to prove that you are who you say you are, to prove you aren't a machine, to ascertain ownership of certain things, or even as simply as to allow two computers to enter into a legally binding agreement together without a human being involved in that interaction. All of those types of things can really be enabled through blockchain tech. And I think that's going to be a big question we as a society need to answer in the coming months and years. And I think blockchain will play an important role in that discussion.\n\nBaselli: Very interesting. Finally, after that, the US authorities filed a lawsuit against Binance and other exchanges in June. A couple of weeks ago, Binance basically pleaded guilty and agreed to pay a roughly $4 billion settlement. Is this a watershed for the future of crypto world in your view? And more broadly, what is your judgment on the whole thing?\n\nSnyder: Maybe it's a contrarian opinion. I actually think it's great. Goes to regulatory clarity. I think the situation with Binance, and these lawsuits has been an overhang on the market for quite some time and a preoccupation of the market given some of the broken trust with other major institutions in the crypto space from the year prior. And I think this resolution is helpful. It's helpful for the market to move forward.\n\nI think we'll see more of that. I think a lot of these lawsuits are beginning to get cleaned up. Some of the stuff that's happening with XRP, you're seeing some early indications from the discussions with Coinbase and the SEC \u2013 I imagine also with Binance and the SEC who haven't settled yet in terms of providing that regulatory clarity. It's going to be an important component of the path forward. I think Binance is one piece of this, but if you take all the different elements of regulatory action that we've seen over the last 18 months and all the different events in crypto, I think together they make a watershed moment. I think they make for a change in how this market approaches regulation, approaches transparency and approaches its commitment to customers. I think that's a really positive thing for the industry as a whole.\n\nBaselli: Very clear. Thank you so much, Ophelia, for your time. For Morningstar, I'm Valerio Baselli. Thanks for watching."

        "content": "BlackRock has revised its spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) application to make it easier for Wall Street banks to participate by creating new shares in the fund with cash rather than just crypto.\n\nThe new in-kind redemption \u201cprepay\u201d model will allow banking giants such as JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs to act as authorized participants for the fund, letting them circumvent restrictions that prevent them from holding Bitcoin or crypto directly on their balance sheets.\n\nThe new model was presented by six members of BlackRock and three from Nasdaq in a Nov. 28 meeting with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nIf approved, the move could be a game-changer for Wall Street banks with trillion-dollar balance sheets looking to get involved, as many highly regulated banks can\u2019t hold Bitcoin themselves.\n\nUnder the revised model, authorized participants (APs) would transfer cash to a broker-dealer, which converts it into Bitcoin, before storing it with the ETF\u2019s custody provider \u2014 Coinbase Custody, in BlackRock\u2019s case.\n\nThe new structure also works by shifting risk away from APs and placing it more in the hands of market makers.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s revised in-kind redemption model presented to the SEC on Nov. 28. Source: SEC\n\nBlackRock said the new model also offers \u201csuperior resistance to market manipulation,\u201d which has been one of the primary reasons the SEC has repeatedly denied all prior spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nAdditionally, BlackRock claimed the new ETF structure would strengthen investor protections, lower transaction costs, and increase \u201csimplicity and harmonization\u201d across the wider Bitcoin ETF ecosystem.\n\nBlackRock meets with SEC for the third time\n\nAccording to a SEC filing, BlackRock met with the Gary Gensler-led SEC for the third time on Dec. 11.\n\nDamn, the SEC is busier than Santa's elves. BlackRock's third meeting with them yesterday is the most notable IMO as everyone is waiting to see if they can convince SEC to allow in-kind creations in the first run of approvals. https://t.co/r2jqgpg87m \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 12, 2023\n\nBlackRock and Nasdaq\u2019s second meeting with the SEC on Nov. 28 was a follow-up from the first with the securities regulator on Nov. 20, where it presented its original in-kind redemption model.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETFs will drive institutional adoption in 2024 \u2014 Galaxy Digital\u2019s Mike Novogratz\n\nThe SEC must make a decision on BlackRock\u2019s application by Jan. 15, with the final deadline scheduled for March 15.\n\nMeanwhile, ETF analysts predict the SEC will issue a decision on several pending spot Bitcoin ETF applicants sometime between Jan. 5\u201310.\n\nGrayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, WisdomTree, Invesco Galaxy, Fidelity, and Hashdex are among the other financial firms awaiting a decision by the SEC between those dates.\n\nMagazine: Expect \u2018records broken\u2019 by Bitcoin ETF: Brett Harrison (ex-FTX US), X Hall of Flame"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto may soon see another mass wave of adoption by United States-based firms after a new accounting rule change that lets companies more accurately reflect the value of their crypto holdings.\n\nCory Klippsten, the CEO of Bitcoin-only exchange Swan Bitcoin, told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin-holding companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla, which both had to report impairment on their holdings, \u201ccan now more accurately reflect their Bitcoin investments\u2019 true value.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis change is crucial for a broad range of companies, not just those primarily focused on Bitcoin, encouraging more mainstream corporate adoption.\u201d\n\nThe new Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rules released on Dec. 13 that come into effect in December 2024 see the estimated market value of crypto held by companies represented accurately on companies\u2019 accounting books by allowing them to record when they\u2019re holding assets at a gain.\n\nPreviously, crypto held by companies was subject to impairment only when the value of crypto decreased on the books, which could not be increased until sold, even if its value increased while being held.\n\nKlippsten added that companies could now use Bitcoin as a \u201cstrategic financial asset,\u201d as they would be able to report on their value gains and losses, a feature that could help drive adoption.\n\nMatrixport research head and Crypto Titans author Markus Thielen told Cointelegraph that the rule change \u201cunderscores the palpable corporate demand\u201d for incorporating crypto into a firm\u2019s accounting.\n\nRelated: BlackRock revises spot Bitcoin ETF to enable easier access for banks\n\n\u201cDigital assets are increasingly becoming a crucial component of financial statements,\u201d said Thielen, adding that companies will now have more confidence when valuing their crypto holdings.\n\n\u201cThis signals a resounding confirmation that digital assets have firmly established themselves in the financial landscape.\u201d\n\nOthers were also excited by the rule change. David Marcus, co-creator of Facebook\u2019s binned stablecoin project Diem, posted to X (formerly Twitter) on Dec. 13, saying the new rules are \u201cactually a big deal,\u201d which remove \u201ca large obstacle standing in the way of corporations holding Bitcoin on their balance sheet.\u201d\n\nYou may think this is a small accounting change that doesn\u2019t mean much. It\u2019s actually a big deal. This removes a large obstacle standing in the way of corporations holding #Bitcoin on their balance sheet. 2024 will be a landmark year for $BTC. https://t.co/gV0KRISt8B \u2014 David Marcus (@davidmarcus) December 13, 2023\n\nIn a Sept. 6 note following the FASB\u2019s approval of the rules, Berenberg Capital\u2019s senior equity research analyst Mark Palmer said crypto-holding companies could \u201celiminate the poor optics that have been created by impairment losses under the rules that the FASB has had in place.\u201d\n\nMagazine: X Hall of Flame: Expect \u2018records broken\u2019 by Bitcoin ETF: Brett Harrison (ex-FTX US)"

        "content": "Lolli, a bitcoin and cashback rewards application, has raised an $8 million Series B round, TechCrunch has exclusively learned.\n\nThe company\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Alex Adelman, said the fresh capital will be used to roll out Lolli\u2019s rewards program to enterprise partners like exchanges, neobanks, banks, payment companies and browsers.\n\nTo date, Lolli has raised over $28 million. \u201cWe have historically raised the amount needed to win,\u201d Adelman said. \u201cWe don\u2019t take more money than we need to support our next phase of growth, and are very focused on operating efficiently and proving out our business model.\u201d\n\nThe Series B round was led by BITKRAFT Ventures, with participation from Sfermion, Ulta Beauty\u2019s Prisma Ventures, Hypersphere Ventures, ZebPay\u2019s CEO Rahul Pagidipati, 2 Punks Capital, MZ Web3 Fund and others. Previous investors Seven Seven Six, Founders Fund\u2019s Pathfinder Ventures, Bain Capital Ventures, Serena Williams\u2019 Serena Ventures, Logan Paul and MrBeast\u2019s Night Media also invested.\n\nSince launching in 2018, the app has grown substantially and currently partners with more than 25,000 stores. Its rewards program awards its users with bitcoin or cashback when they shop online or in person at restaurants and stores. \u201cLolli is on track to expand the number of stores where users can shop to over 100,000 by 2025,\u201d Adelman said.\n\nThe app gives up to 30% back on purchases, with an average of 7% back in bitcoin or cashback rewards. Since its inception, Lolli has given over $10 million in bitcoin rewards, in addition to cashback rewards, Adelman said.\n\nLast year, the company launched Card Boosts, which lets users add bitcoin rewards to their debit or credit cards when they shop. Adelman called the product a \u201ctremendous growth-driver\u201d that helped users earn over five times the rewards on daily purchases like coffee, gas or groceries. As of October 2023, Lolli\u2019s active shoppers have increased by more than 35% year-over-year, he added.\n\n\u201cMany of our users know the value of \u2018earning the dip\u2019 and have seen the benefits of earning bitcoin rewards with Lolli when the market is down,\u201d Adelman said.\n\nThis means users who earned rewards when bitcoin was at $20,000 or lower in the beginning of 2023 have seen the value of their rewards double, given that bitcoin is over $40,000 today. \u201cThe earliest Lolli users who earned bitcoin when it was at around $3,000 have seen their rewards increase in worth by more than 10X today,\u201d Adelman said.\n\nAs market players anticipate a greater breakout from bitcoin rising over 12% on the month, Lolli is also preparing by building new ways for users to earn rewards. The company plans to use the momentum in the markets to \u201cdrive more revenue to partners and bring more major companies into offering bitcoin rewards,\u201d Adelman said. In 2024, Lolli plans to roll out more products, \u201cbig partnerships\u201d and financial education, he added.\n\n\u201cWe are growing quickly, and over the next few months, we\u2019ll be rolling out new features and merchant partnerships that we think our users will love,\u201d Adelman said. \u201cAs crypto adoption keeps rising, we are focused on becoming a holistic solution for our users to earn money every day, multiple times a day, and to learn about and earn bitcoin.\u201d"

Existing investors, including Alexis Ohanian's Seven Seven Six, Founders Fund's Pathfinder Ventures, Bain Capital Ventures, Serena Williams' Serena Ventures and Logan Paul, also backed the round.\n\nThe funding comes two and a half years after Lolli's Series A round, with an amount lower than that round, which was sized at $10 million. Lolli founder and CEO Alex Adelman said the firm has historically been \"very intentional\" in raising just the amount needed to reach its next growth phase. \"With this round, we have just the right amount needed to win without diluting our existing investors and team,\" Adelman told The Block.\n\nLolli started the fundraising process in early 2023 while getting \"significant M&A interest\" in parallel throughout the year, Adelman said \u2014 adding that the firm decided to go the fundraising path to remain independent and closed the round in November. He declined to comment on Lolli's valuation with Series B but said it was all equity financing.\n\nAs part of the deal, Bitkraft Ventures partner Carlos Pereira has joined Lolli's board, Adelman said \u2014 adding that the Bitkraft team's expertise across gaming and immersive technology will help Lolli bring bitcoin to more people through \"gamified earning experiences.\"\n\nLolli's growth plans\n\nFounded in 2018, Lolli gives shoppers bitcoin or cashback rewards on everyday purchases. The firm says its users have earned more than $10 million in bitcoin rewards to date. Adelman declined to comment on the amount of cashback rewards to date but said Lolli's user base continued to grow over 35% year-over-year as of October. \"We also saw a record-breaking holiday season, with an increase in spending on Lolli that surpassed the national average,\" he said.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nTo bring more users into crypto, Lolli now plans to tie up with enterprises, similar to how it has partnered with merchants and other companies over the years. \"We will be working closely with exchanges, neobanks, banks, payment companies, and browsers to drive increased sales, revenue, and engagement with Lolli's patented rewards technology,\" Adelman said.\n\nInternational expansion has also been on Lolli's roadmap since at least 2021. Adelman said the firm will explore those markets next year \"when the market is right for global bitcoin rewards adoption.\"\n\nLolli Card Boosts\n\nLast year, Lolli also launched an in-store rewards program called Card Boosts. Adelman said the number of stores Lolli users can earn from is currently 25,000, but that is \"on track to reach over 100,000 by 2025.\"\n\nThere are currently 20 people working for Lolli, and Adelman looks to expand the team strategically in the new year across various functions. Lolli remains focused on bitcoin rewards but is open to exploring other cryptocurrencies if there is strong user demand, Adelman said."

        "content": "Bitwise believes crypto is on the cusp of entering its \u201cmainstream era\u201d as we enter 2024 and outlined ten predictions of what\u2019s to come in the year ahead.\n\nHaving outperformed major asset classes in 2023 \u2014 up over 150% year-to-date compared to 22% for the S&P, 40% for the Nasdaq and 12% for gold \u2014 Bitwise analysts expect bitcoin to continue that trend, reaching an all-time high above $80,000 in 2024, according to a report.\n\nThe analysts cite two main catalysts for this. Firstly, a wave of new capital following anticipated spot bitcoin ETF approvals on the demand side \u2014 potentially capturing 1% of the $7.2 trillion U.S. ETF market, or $72 billion, within five years. Secondly, on the supply side, the Bitcoin BTC -5.59% halving event (when the block reward gets cut in half) is expected to fall in April. Bitwise said this was equivalent to a $6.2 billion reduction in new bitcoin entering the market each year.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to approve a spot bitcoin ETF in the United States, having previously approved futures-based funds in 2021. The next deadlines for the SEC\u2019s decision to approve, reject or delay applications from firms \u2014 including Bitwise, as well as VanEck, BlackRock, WisdomTree, Invesco, Fidelity and Valkyrie \u2014 fall in mid-January. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart recently said the window for potential spot bitcoin ETF approval was looking like it would fall between Jan. 5 and Jan. 10, with a 90% probability of success.\n\nBitcoin currently trades at $42,409 \u2014 up 18% over the past month, according to The Block\u2019s price data.\n\nEthereum revenue to double and average transaction fees to fall below one cent\n\nOne criticism of blockchains is that they don\u2019t generate cash flow in the traditional sense. Bitwise says that\u2019s wrong, with Ethereum ETH -6.13% hosting thousands of crypto applications generating fees.\n\nThe analysts said Ethereum is on track to generate around $2.3 billion in fees this year and expects that to more than double in 2024 to over $5 billion as crypto apps go mainstream \u2014 making Ethereum one of the fastest-growing tech platforms in the world.\n\nAt the same time, Bitwise expects a major upgrade to Ethereum to significantly drive down the average fees paid by users. The analysts said the EIP-4844 upgrade, also known as Proto-Danksharding, could push fees paid on Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 chains (like Arbitrum, Base and Optimism) below $0.01 from around $0.14 \u2014 though fees on Ethereum\u2019s base layer remain substantially higher.\n\nBitwise said this could open up additional use cases like micropayments, social media and large-scale gaming applications, paving the way for mainstream adoption.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nTaylor Swift launching NFTs to connect with fans in new ways\n\nPop star Taylor Swift, whose Eras Tour recently became the first to gross over $1 billion, may also launch NFTs to connect with fans in new ways in 2024, according to Bitwise \u2014 claiming she has a reputation for uniquely engaging with fans and is a \u201cstaunch believer in artists owning and monetizing their music.\u201d\n\nThe analysts said NFTs could provide a new medium for just that, from offering exclusive access to concerts, experiences and new music to providing fans partial ownership of their songs via royalties. \u201cMajor bands and artists, ranging from Snoop Dogg and Eminem to Kings of Leon and The Chainsmokers, have already embraced NFTs in one way or another,\u201d they added.\n\nBitwise also highlighted Spotify \u2014 where Swift is the most streamed artist this year \u2014 experimenting with token-gated playlists that require certain NFTs to unlock access as one avenue for the singer.\n\nLast year, Swift was one celebrity influencer who managed to dodge a bullet on partnering with the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX, though later reports suggested she was not the one to have shaken off a deal.\n\nBitwise\u2019s other predictions for the year ahead\n\nThe Bitwise analysts anticipate crypto exchange Coinbase\u2019s revenue to double next year from $2.8 billion to $5.7 billion \u2014 more than ten times average Wall Street expectations \u2014 as a bull market unfolds, Coinbase expands its products and the company positions itself to be the prime custodian for spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe asset manager also expects stablecoins to settle more money than Visa next year, JPMorgan to tokenize a fund and launch it on-chain as Wall Street gears up to tokenize real-world assets, and one in four financial advisors to allocate to crypto in client accounts by the end of 2024.\n\nAdditionally, Bitwise sees AI assistants beginning to use crypto to pay for things online as it becomes the \"native currency of the internet,\" and more than $100 million staked in prediction markets as they become the next \u201ckiller apps\u201d in crypto.\n\nLast year, despite correctly predicting the crypto market recovery, Coinbase\u2019s market cap doubling and the amount of staked ether rising over 50%, Bitwise was wrong in expecting USDC to surpass USDT as the world\u2019s largest stablecoin and in predicting the U.S. Congress would pass at least one piece of significant crypto legislation in 2023.\n\nLast week, fellow asset managers VanEck published its predictions for the year ahead. VanEck expects a long-awaited U.S. recession to finally arrive in 2024 but still anticipates spot bitcoin ETF approvals and the halving event to spur bitcoin to all-time highs by Q4."

        "title": "Native Bitcoin Staking on Ethereum and Solana Could Soon Be a Reality - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThere are a few essential truths that govern accepted thinking about blockchain networks. One such truth is that, without compromises like wrapped tokens and blockchain bridges, proof-of-stake networks like Ethereum and proof-of-work networks like Bitcoin are tantamount to water and oil: They just don\u2019t mix.\n\nNow, a new startup led by a Stanford professor and a former Dolby engineer is attempting to disprove that. Babylon, a project that seeks to allow users to stake Bitcoin (BTC) to validate nodes on a variety of proof-of-stake networks including Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon, is already well on its way to achieving its improbable-sounding goal.\n\nThe company just raised an $18 million funding round co-led by Polychain Capital and Hack VC, with participation from funds including Framework Ventures, Polygon Ventures, OKX Ventures, and Castle Island Ventures. It is also in ongoing conversations with multiple blockchain networks about integrating its services, including Polygon, a Polygon Labs spokesperson confirmed to Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHow could it be possible, even theoretically, for someone to stake BTC\u2014actual BTC, not a wrapped token that utilizes a blockchain bridge\u2014on a proof-of-stake network? Proof-of-stake networks like Ethereum utilize smart contracts to govern the staking process, which rewards users who deposit a certain amount of ETH with rewards accrued over time.\n\nIn return, these ETH deposits are used to validate transactions on the Ethereum network. The entire staking process represents an intricate web of if/then conditions executed automatically by a smart contract.\n\nSmart contracts, however, are not natively supported on the Bitcoin blockchain\u2014but Babylon says it\u2019s found a workaround.\n\nThe solution relies in part on Bitcoin\u2019s \u201ctime lock\u201d mechanism, which allows users to deposit a certain amount of BTC for a certain period, then withdraw it after that period without depending on a third party. But Babylon also had to find a way to get around the pesky smart contract problem.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge for staking is that the stake is a collateral,\u201d David Tse, an engineering professor at Stanford who co-founded Babylon, told Decrypt. \u201cIn other words, I have to be able to slash the Bitcoin when the validator on the proof-of-stake chain is doing something bad.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTypically, a smart contract would either release collateralized funds to a staker if all conditions were met, or burn (or slash) those funds if they hadn\u2019t been. Tse says his team has been able to replicate that process on the Bitcoin network without smart contracts.\n\n\u201cWe came up with a way to use the existing Bitcoin scripting language to effect the slashing,\u201d Tse said. \u201cThat is the main innovation of the project.\u201d\n\nIf Tse and his team have in fact gotten this right\u2014he says they still have a bit of final tweaking to do on the technology\u2014then the potential upside is enormous.\n\nProof-of-stake blockchains of all sorts could tap into the $838 billion worth of incredibly secure Bitcoin already in circulation to validate their transactions. That innovation would be an all-but-certain path to deflation for any proof-of-stake network, that would no longer have to issue so many new tokens in order to incentivize validation.\n\n\u201cThe Cosmos hub is paying about 10%\u2014inflating the token 10%\u2014to pay for Cosmos\u2019 security,\u201d Tse said, giving an example. \u201cBy bringing in Bitcoin, it can potentially lower the cost of security quite a bit, because Bitcoin is a much larger supply of capital.\u201d\n\nBabylon won\u2019t be able to provide its technology to any given proof-of-stake blockchain ecosystem until that blockchain\u2019s governance gives consent. So, at the moment, the company\u2019s vision is still theoretical.\n\nBut Babylon is, as mentioned above, currently in serious conversations with major proof-of-stake blockchains like Polygon\u2014and also has already received the blessing of industry leaders including Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal.\n\n\u201cBabylon's vision aligns with our commitment to fostering decentralized ecosystems by offering diverse options for communities to seamlessly choose from,\u201d Nailwal said in a statement. \u201cWe are enthusiastic about the positive impact this collaboration will bring to the wider blockchain community.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf (or when) proof-of-stake networks like Polygon begin adopting Babylon\u2019s novel technology, they may create new parameters for what it means to stake BTC on their chain as opposed to the network\u2019s native token.\n\nEthereum, for example, may not require the minimum amount of BTC needed to stake on the network to equal 32 ETH, the system\u2019s current requirement. It might also elect to offer a lower rewards return rate for BTC stakers.\n\nEven if proof-of-stake networks that eventually work with Babylon opt to make such choices, though, the demand for receiving any sort of passive, guaranteed return on Bitcoin will likely be immensely attractive to BTC holders around the world.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "Blockstream targets continued Bitcoin miner surplus with Series 2 BASIC Note - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Blockstream will look to raise more capital to buy Bitcoin (BTC) mining hardware through a second series of its Blockstream ASIC (BASIC) Note offering, which aims to accumulate and sell ASICs based on the predicted demand for miners over the next two years.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Cointelegraph, Blockstream CEO Adam Back highlighted a surplus of Bitcoin mining hardware on the secondary market as a critical driver for a second series of its investment offering.\n\nSeries 1 sells out\n\nBlockstream wound up an initial $5-million raise, which saw the firm purchase unused, boxed Antminer S19k Pro ASIC miners for $4.87 million. The company managed to secure the hardware, one of the Chinese manufacturer\u2019s most popular miners, through SunnySide Digital.\n\n\u201cIt presents an opportunity because the Bitcoin price is up 2.8 times, and the miner price is down. Regarding a reference point, ASICs were selling at $35 per terahash at the beginning of the year and now $13.5 per TH on this purchase,\u201d Back explained.\n\nRelated: Perfect storm for undervalued ASICs: Blockstream plans $50M raise to buy miners\n\nThe CEO added that ASIC prices are down 2.6 times their dollar cost from January 2023 and 6.6 times in Bitcoin. The latter is what matters to Back, who said Blockstream will store the hardware in warehouses and sell it on the market as miners look to bring more hardware online as profitability increases alongside the projected upside value of Bitcoin:\n\n\u201cThe fund is not looking for the highest dollar price for the miner; it is looking for the highest Bitcoin price for the miner.\u201d\n\nBlockstream bought Antminer S19k Pro ASIC miners on Nov. 29 for a weighted dollar average of $38,596 per BTC. Source: Blockstream/Luxor data\n\n\u201cAccidental beneficiaries\u201d of BASIC Note\u2019s strategy\n\nTiming the sale of miners is another consideration altogether, which will have to factor in several metrics. One potential tipping point could be the reduction of available miners on second-hand markets. Back said this will force buyers to go directly to manufacturers, driving the price per terahash of units to rise.\n\nBlockstream experienced this firsthand in 2021 when it acquired miners for its hosting service. However, the company ran out of capacity to run the hardware for clients and eventually sold some surplus miners for \u201cthree to four times\u201d higher than it had bought the miners.\n\nRelated: Blockstream CEO Adam Back talks Bitcoin over a game of Jenga\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t our plan to get into the miner reselling game, but we had more inventory than hosting, so we sold off the surplus. That opened our eyes to this dynamic between ASIC and Bitcoin prices,\u201d Back explained.\n\nThe Bitcoin bull run effect\n\nBecoming \u201caccidental beneficiaries\u201d of the strategy underpinning the BASIC Note also highlights the importance of the \u201ctime value\u201d of money and why the price of Bitcoin remains crucial in selling Bitcoin mining hardware for profit.\n\nThe BASIC Note is a #bitcoin-denominated vehicle that leverages Blockstream's expertise in the Bitcoin mining sector to capitalize on historically low ASIC prices and the promising signs of recovery, anchored by the upcoming Bitcoin halving in 2024.https://t.co/mx9QJ9STun \u2014 Blockstream (@Blockstream) December 13, 2023\n\nBack explained that miners typically buy hardware for a dollar amount and calculate how much Bitcoin they can mine from that point. However, one has to factor in shipping times from a manufacturer, which means that the investment only begins to generate value once it arrives and is powered up.\n\n\u201cWe said to people, \u2018You can pay the manufacturer $60 a terahash, for example, but you\u2019ll lose $50 waiting for it to arrive. Or you can pay us $100 per terahash. That\u2019s a win for you because we can give it to you immediately,\u2019\u201d Back said.\n\nRelated: Venture capital\u2019s ICO gambits left Bitcoin ecosystem underfunded \u2014 Adam Back\n\nThe Blockstream CEO said that previous Bitcoin bull runs have resulted in situations where the electricity cost of mining drastically drops in percentage due to the increase in BTC\u2019s value.\n\n\u201cThe profit is like three times higher when the price doubles. In that situation, people go from being willing to pay $30 to $40 per terahash to being willing to pay between $100 to $130 per terahash, which is what happened last year,\u201d Back recalled.\n\nThis presents the \u201ctail end\u201d opportunity to sell Bitcoin mining hardware that Blockstream has acquired.\n\nBASIC Note will be reactive going forward\n\nBlockstream\u2019s BASIC Note Series 2 offering will likely be reactive to market conditions and demand from investors. Back noted that gauging how much hardware is available to buy on secondary markets is not so clear-cut despite depressed prices suggesting a surplus of inventory.\n\nLuxembourg-based security tokens platform STOKR will manage the second series, which is set to go live around the turn of the new year. The product is available to accredited non-United States investors and requires a minimum $115,000 investment paid in BTC, Liquid Bitcoin (L-BTC) or Tether (USDT).\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin 2023 in Miami comes to grips with \u2018shitcoins on Bitcoin\u2019"

He also allegedly begged her for an open relationship in weeks worth of deranged, unanswered messages, and offered her 10 Bitcoin (almost $430,000) if she so much as texted him back.\n\nTurns out, it was all a little too perfect.\n\nDays after rapper and model Rubi Rose went viral for posting a string of text messages on Twitter that were purportedly from a desperate crypto whale\u2014who oscillated between professing \u201cI love you more than Bitcoin,\u201d screaming at her, and offering to follow her commands while wearing a \u201csissy maid outfit\u201d\u2014said lovestruck fan has now finally surfaced.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd his side of the story sounds quite different from Rose's narrative.\n\ni ran into my #1 spender on onlyfans \ud83d\ude2d pic.twitter.com/5hH8b3IjqA \u2014 Rubi Rose (@RubiRose) December 1, 2023\n\nThe man, who also appeared in a photo with Rose tagged as her \u201c#1 spender,\u201d says he does not own thousands of Bitcoins, nor is he particularly wealthy. He\u2019s also never texted Rubi Rose in his life.\n\nHis name is Lamar, and he dogsits for porn stars.\n\nOn a podcast appearance yesterday, Lamar\u2014who didn\u2019t offer his last name due to privacy concerns\u2014claimed that he had never once used OnlyFans or engaged with Rubi Rose until weeks ago, when the rapper\u2019s agents approached him through mutual friends in the modeling industry and asked if he would be willing to take a photo with Rose for unknown purposes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLamar conceded he might have been offered the gig because he \u201clooks like a guy who would spend $63,000\" on a person he wasn't in a relationship with. But he says he engaged anyway after being offered an undisclosed payment. Soon after, he said he showed up at the Mondrian Hotel in West Hollywood to snap dozens of photos with Rose, before getting smoked out and sent on his way.\n\nDays later, Lamar says, Rose\u2019s agents got back in touch, curious if he was willing to up the ante. Both parties eventually agreed that Lamar would get Rose\u2019s face tattooed on his leg, in exchange for a second, larger payment.\n\nLamar did not disclose the size of that follow-up fee, saying only that, in hindsight, he should have asked for more. Apparently in the midst of negotiations, Lamar sought the counsel of porn star Gina Valentina, whose one cat and four dogs he often watches. She reportedly told him to ask for no less than $15,000.\n\nLamar claims he got the tattoo, sent a video of it to the agents, and pushed the whole thing out of his mind.\n\nThen Rose made the post.\n\nTat my face on u so i know it\u2019s real pic.twitter.com/lE8pQrtwLx \u2014 Rubi Rose (@RubiRose) December 5, 2023\n\nRose\u2019s team inserted the real video of Lamar\u2019s tattoo together into a string of unhinged text messages that Lamar says he never wrote, triggering a viral phenomenon that whipped up outrage at wealth inequality, at male stalkers and sexual violence, and of course, at crypto. At writing, Rose\u2019s Twitter posts about Lamar have been viewed a total of 221 million times.\n\nLamar says he had no idea what Rose\u2019s team was planning to do with the content he made for them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know exactly what the storyline was,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I was some \u2018Bitcoin billionaire.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut the novelty of the experiment soon wore off, once he started being identified on the streets of Los Angeles as the supposed porn addict who said he\u2019d give up his crypto millions to be Rubi Rose\u2019s pet cuckold.\n\nHis friends\u2014many of whom work in the modeling and porn industries\u2014started asking him about the post, and questioning his character. Lamar says he couldn\u2019t sleep for days on end after the post was published.\n\nDecrypt reached out to Rose's representatives for comment, but did not immediately hear back.\n\nIt\u2019s not all bad news for the dogsitter. He says he\u2019s since made peace with the ordeal, has no bitterness towards Rose, and that he intends to keep her face on his leg. And though he didn\u2019t make nearly as much as she presumably did off the Twitter posts, he\u2019s already cooking up ways to capitalize on his 15 minutes of fame.\n\nThe hosts of the \u201cUgly Inside\u201d podcast\u2014on which Lamar appeared\u2014suggested Tuesday that he should double down on the crypto angle of the whole saga, and start selling trading courses.\n\n\u201cYou should scam them all,\u201d one host suggested. \u201cSay \u2018This is King Cuck, the Bitcoin guy,\u2019 sign them up [for] $10,000 each\u2026 and then just copy a course from YouTube.\u201d\n\n\u201cI actually already started that,\u201d Lamar replied.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nJP Morgan has poured cold water on hopes of a crypto bull run next year, with the bank\u2019s analysts taking a \u201ccautious\u201d stance in their 2024 crypto outlook.\n\nAnalysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said in a newly published report that the Bitcoin halving is \u201clargely priced in,\u201d since the halving event and its effect on the Bitcoin supply are \u201cpredictable and in our opinion are well factored into the current bitcoin price.\u201d\n\nThe team argued that based on the current Bitcoin hash rate and mining difficulty, that the production cost for miners would rise from around $22,000 at present to around $44,000 post-halving.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin\u2019s current price of around $42,000 is consistent with a 5% drop in the post-halving hash rate, which \u201cseems too low,\u201d with the team anticipating a 20% drop in the hash rate and miners with higher overheads exiting the market.\n\nSince the 2020 halving brought Bitcoin's price to a 1:1 ratio with miners\u2019 production cost, and the current Bitcoin price is around twice the production cost, it implies that the 2024 halving is largely priced in, the report suggested.\n\nEthereum could \u201coutperform\u201d Bitcoin in 2024, the report said, pointing to the EIP-4844 \u201cProtodanksharding\u201d upgrade as a potential catalyst, but raised concerns about centralization of staking on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe report cautioned that it is \u201ctoo early to be getting excited\u201d about a revival of DeFi and NFT activity, while pointing to the \u201cencouraging\u201d rise of new DeFi chains including Aptos, SUI and Pulsechain, and the \u201crenewed interest\u201d in NFTs prompted by the emergence of Bitcoin Ordinals.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF flop?\n\nJP Morgan analysts also expressed skepticism that the long-anticipated approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF would bring fresh capital to the market.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe report cited both the lack of interest from investors in already-approved spot ETFs in Canada and Europe, and the likelihood that capital would move into spot Bitcoin ETFs from existing Bitcoin products, such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Bitcoin futures ETFs and Bitcoin mining companies.\n\nThe report argued that as much as $2.7 billion could exit GBTC following its conversion to a spot Bitcoin ETF, as investors take profit. Were those funds to exit the market rather than moving into other Bitcoin instruments, it would put \u201csevere downward pressure\u201d on the price of Bitcoin, analysts said.\n\nJP Morgan and crypto\n\nThe JP Morgan report comes just a week after the firms\u2019 CEO, Jamie Dimon, took aim at crypto in a Senate Banking Committee hearing, saying that he would \u201cclose it down\u201d if he were the U.S. government.\n\nDimon claimed that, \u201cThe true use case for it [crypto] is criminals, drug traffickers, money laundering, tax avoidance,\u201d adding that, \u201cI\u2019ve always been opposed to crypto, Bitcoin, etcetera.\u201d"

        "content": "Gemini Earn creditors are fuming over a proposed reorganization plan that could see their promised Bitcoin (BTC) payouts effectively slashed to about 30% of what they\u2019re worth at current market rates.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter), Gemini Trust revealed it sent creditors an email on Dec. 13 outlining the proposed plan, which has now been put up for a vote.\n\nUnder the proposed plan, creditors will receive a payout equal to their Earn crypto balances as of Jan. 19, 2023 \u2014 the date that Gemini\u2019s cryptocurrency lending partner Genesis Global Capital filed for bankruptcy.\n\nSome observers, including Bloomberg exchange-traded fund analyst James Seyffart, described the plan as \u201cbrutal,\u201d given that the prices of Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) were only $20,940 and $1,545 at the time. The assets have since rallied to $42,750 and $2,250, respectively, at the time of writing.\n\nThis could be brutal. Granted seems to be worst case scenario but Gemini Earn users could be getting potentially just 61% of the value of their crypto from Jan 19, 2023. WOOF.\n\n\n\nEven at 100% it stings based on current prices.

Absolute disgrace.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou stole our money. Give it ALL back, every single dollar,\u201d said another user, Leslie, in response to Gemini Trust\u2019s post. She added:\n\n\u201cHow can any of your customers believe a single word you say when you have deceived and lied to us for WELL over a year.\u201d Leslie\u2019s comments were made in reference to Gemini reassuring customers that it would not be subject to counterparty risk from Genesis.\n\nAnother X user, BC, said everyone should be paid back in full. \u201cAnything less is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nAfter a year this is absolutely insane. You killed our souls. You damaged our hearts and health. We give you crypto coins and want our crypto back. The same amount. DCG forced you to do what ever they want. You couldn\u2019t do anything!!! Unbelievable \u2014 ANNA (@AvaAzadpour) December 14, 2023\n\nGemini Earn was a program where users earned interest in cryptocurrencies. Gemini withdrew hundreds of millions of dollars from Genesis to facilitate the program before Genesis went bankrupt.\n\nThe cryptocurrency exchange is now seeking to recover $1.6 billion from Genesis for Earn users.\n\nRelated: New York Attorney General sues Gemini, Genesis, DCG for allegedly defrauding investors\n\nCreditors have until Jan. 10, 2024, at 4 pm Eastern Time to accept or reject Gemini\u2019s plan.\n\nIf the plan is accepted, the bankruptcy court overlooking the case will decide whether it gives final approval on Feb. 14, 2024.\n\nMagazine: Blockchain detectives: Mt.

        "content": "Bitcoin has topped $40,000 for the first time since April 2022. Photo: CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images.\n\nCryptocurrency bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price has fallen 3.5% since Friday (8 December) to $41,676 at the time of writing (12 December) but remains above the $40,000 valuation that made headlines at the beginning of this month.\n\nThe currency has risen by over 150% since the start of 2023, aided by rumours of exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval and uncertainty in other markets. It was last above the $40k threshold in April 2022 \u2013 after which it plunged 50% by June of that year.\n\nThat led to the major crypto lender Celsius freezing withdrawals and filing for bankruptcy in July 2022, while FTX\u2019s collapse four months later in November tanked prices further and could have spelt the end of BTC as a trusted asset. But, for good or ill, the currency proved more durable than some critics gave it credit for.\n\nBTC is volatile, underregulated and still not widely accepted as a form of payment. In normal circumstances, these would not be appealing traits in an asset but there are benefits to sitting outside the traditional financial system.\n\nBitcoin operates in its own cycles of growth and shrinkage that is largely unaffected by the geopolitical considerations that threaten physical assets or foreign currencies. It had only negligible price deviations following the spread of Covid-19 and the war in Ukraine, the former of which tanked global stock markets.\n\nIn this way it can act similarly to an asset like gold, offering a hedge against inflation or greater returns than banks when interest rates are low. It is also more insulated from industry shocks than other crypto. A Reuters graph shows that the failure of Genesis, another crypto lender, the conviction of Sam Bankman-Fried and the guilty plea of Binance\u2019s CEO have all had limited effects on BTC\u2019s price.\n\nHow well do you really know your competitors?

        "content": "The crypto market, especially Bitcoin (BTC), has recently declined. Amid these fluctuations, the flagship cryptocurrency has been intensely scrutinized.\n\nDespite its decline from the recent peak of $44,000, a crypto analyst urged the community not to \u201csuccumb to panic.\u201d The current market situation reflects a typical correction phase rather than a long-term bearish trend.\n\nAccording to Ali Charts, a prominent crypto analyst, Bitcoin has established a \u201crobust\u201d support zone between $37,150 and $38,360. This critical range is bolstered by the activity of approximately 1.52 million addresses that collectively purchased roughly 534,000 BTC at that price point, as indicated by Ali.\n\nThe analyst suggests that the significant accumulation forms a \u201cstrong\u201d foundation, potentially preventing further declines in Bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Resistance And The Road Ahead\n\nDespite the recent market downturn, Bitcoin\u2019s potential for recovery and continued growth remains a subject of interest. Ali has also identified two key resistance levels at $43,850 and $46,400 that could challenge Bitcoin\u2019s upward momentum.\n\nThese points represent significant thresholds where selling pressure may intensify, potentially hindering Bitcoin\u2019s ability to reclaim its recent highs.\n\nIn case of a deeper correction, #Bitcoin finds solid support between $37,150 and $38,360. This zone is backed by 1.52 million addresses holding 534,000 $BTC. Also, watch out for two resistance walls that could keep the #BTC uptrend at bay: one at $43,850 and another at $46,400. pic.twitter.com/NGm1XpMOLf \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) December 11, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, the past 24 hours have seen Bitcoin\u2019s price dip by 0.3% with a price below $42,000, continuing its retreat from the $44,000 mark. This reduction in value is mirrored in the crypto\u2019s trading volume, which has fallen from $37 billion to $21 billion. This decline indicates a decreased trading activity, suggesting a cooling-off period following the recent market rally.\n\nThe Positive Side Of The Bitcoin Pullback\n\nAmid concerns over Bitcoin\u2019s price fluctuations, experts like William Clemente, co-founder of Reflexivity Research, offer a different perspective. Clemente emphasizes that the current pullback, potentially bringing Bitcoin\u2019s price to around $40,000, is not necessarily a negative development.\n\nClemente argues that this correction is essential for \u201cshaking out weak hands\u201d and reducing leverage in the market, ultimately laying a more solid foundation for future growth.\n\nThe Co-founder of Reflexivity Research further noted that \u201cBitcoin\u2019s volatility is a feature, not a bug.\u201d\n\nBTC just ~doubled in 2 months with no pull backs, a correction is not that surprising. Corrections shake out \u201cweak hands\u201d and leverage, allowing for a stronger foundation for eventual moves higher. Bitcoin\u2019s volatility is a feature, not a bug.

Once identified, Bitcoin 360 claims that it can execute a trade from start to finish automatically on a trader\u2019s behalf.\n\nThis means that traders don\u2019t have to do much in order to trade with Bitcoin 360 AI.

Traders are encouraged to take advantage of the demo account to learn how to use the platform effectively before risking real money.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin 360 AI\u2019s website states that the platform is completely free to use. Traders must make a minimum deposit of $250, money that is used to start trading cryptocurrencies on a user\u2019s behalf.\n\nAccording to the site, Bitcoin 360 AI does not charge deposit or withdrawal fees or even take commissions on successful trades.\n\nBitcoin 360 AI Pros & Cons\n\nHere are the main benefits and drawbacks of the Bitcoin 360 AI app, according to the claims made on its website.\n\nPros:\n\nClaims to automate crypto trades for dozens of popular tokens\n\nAlgorithm can trade 24/7 according to the website\n\nNo deposit, withdrawal, or trading fees according to the website\n\nClaims to offer a demo account\n\nClaims to offer 24/7 customer support\n\nCons:\n\nDoes not provide information about the historical success rate\n\nRequires a $250 minimum deposit\n\nHow Does Bitcoin 360 AI Work?\n\nAccording to the Bitcoin 360 AI website, the platform uses artificial intelligence (AI) in order to detect profitable trading setups in the crypto market. While the details of its AI algorithm are not revealed, it is likely that the algorithm has been trained on several years\u2019 worth of crypto price data. Using this data, the algorithm can learn what price patterns often precede large upward or downward price movements.\n\nBitcoin 360 AI claims that it uses the money within traders\u2019 accounts to place live trades once it recognizes a signal pattern. The platform opens a position according to the direction of the signal. It then automatically closes it at some point, likely based on a profit target, stop loss, or another price pattern for that signal.\n\nAccording to the platform\u2019s website, traders\u2019 money is then returned to their accounts along with any profit. Bitcoin 360 AI can then use the money again to place additional trades. Traders can withdraw funds from their accounts at any time with no withdrawal fees.\n\nThe Bitcoin 360 AI website does not provide information about the likelihood of success or the past win rate for trades that its system has executed.\n\nCryptocurrencies are unregulated. Trading with unregulated brokers will not qualify for investor protection.\n\nBitcoin 360 AI Key Features\n\nOur Bitcoin 360 AI review identified several key features of this platform, according to the claims made by the platform\u2019s developers.\n\nDozens of Crypto Markets\n\nAccording to the Bitcoin 360 AI website, this automated trading platform is capable of trading dozens of top crypto tokens. Those include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Binance Coin, Dash, and many more. It is not clear if Bitcoin 360 AI trades the tokens directly or trades through crypto CFDs, which are offered by many brokers.\n\nTrading multiple cryptocurrencies can be advantageous because they provide more opportunities to trade. In addition, not all coins move in the same direction at the same time, creating opportunities to hedge against the market overall.\n\nDemo Trading Account\n\nBitcoin 360 AI claims to offer a demo trading account that traders can activate at any time. This account enables traders to monitor the platform\u2019s trades and profit or loss without risking real money. It can be a good way for traders to evaluate Bitcoin 360 AI and learn how to use the platform safely.\n\nTraders must create a Bitcoin 360 AI account in order to access the demo trading platform.\n\nBeginner-friendly\n\nBitcoin 360 AI app claims that its platform can be used by any traders, including beginners who have never previously traded cryptocurrencies.

This is important since traders need to trust that they can make deposits and withdrawals to the platform securely.\n\nBitcoin 360 AI Fees\n\nBitcoin 360 AI claims to be completely free to use. According to the platform\u2019s website, there are no deposit or withdrawal fees, no commissions on trades, and no account fees.

This is something that other automated trading platforms claim to do as well and is ultimately the goal of most traders.\n\nBitcoin 360 AI doesn\u2019t provide much information about how its algorithm works or its past success rate. However, this is common among automated trading platforms since the algorithms are trade secrets. The platform claims to provide a demo account that traders can use to test out Bitcoin 360 AI\u2019s performance for themselves.\n\nThe Bitcoin 360 AI website does not provide testimonials or reviews from current users. Bitcoin 360 AI reviews on sites like Trustpilot are generally positive, but there is little information about the reviewers.\n\nBitcoin 360 AI is completely free to use according to the website.

        "title": "The biggest crypto risers of the year revealed - This is Money",
        "content": "Crypto has found its feet in 2023 once again after a brutal 2022. Excitement is building among proponents and investors over the prospects for next year.\n\nBitcoin, the original crypto and most valuable by a distance still, has had a great year. After plummeting to around $15,000 per coin in November 2022, it nearly trebled to $42,000 as the year-end approaches (5-year performance: 1,150 per cent).\n\nEthereum, the second of the big two and also a leading smart contract platform, has also seen a strong recovery in 2023 to reach the $2,220 level, having fallen as low as $895 last year (5-year performance: 1,500 per cent).\n\nMost major cryptoassets are up significantly from their low points, but some have done better than others.\n\nThe optimism building over what 2024 may bring has many different aspects to it, but there are two in particular capturing the imagination.\n\nCrypto has found its feet in 2023 once again after a brutal 2022\n\nFirstly, the next bitcoin 'halving' is due in April 2024. This occurs approximately every four years. Emissions of new bitcoin paid to the 'miners' of the network will be cut in half. This increases scarcity and helps support price rises.\n\nDuring the months before and after a halving, large rises in bitcoin's price have occurred historically.\n\nSecond, several bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are expected to be approved by US financial watchdog the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nGiant investment firms like BlackRock will be able to directly offer bitcoin investment to their millions of clients, following the approvals. This could vastly expand the pool of potential investors in crypto.\n\nThere will continue to be wild swings in price and crypto will remain high risk, but the potential for big profits is there.\n\nSimon Peters, an analyst at eToro , says: '2024 has the potential to be one of the biggest years we've seen for crypto asset prices.'\n\nSimon Peters, an analyst at eToro, says: '2024 has the potential to be one of the biggest years we've seen for crypto asset prices, if the bitcoin four year cycle is anything to go by, as well as potentially more robust regulation which could give investors confidence to invest into the crypto space.'\n\n'Focusing on the four-year cycle, historically the crypto bull and bear markets revolve around the bitcoin block reward halving.\n\n'There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin mined into existence. With decreasing new issuance, if demand increases then bitcoin prices should go up,' Peters continued.\n\n'The supply shock will come from the block reward halving which will take the reward per block down from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, and the annual inflation rate from around 1.7 per cent down to around 0.85 per cent.\n\n'The demand shock could come from a wave of retail and institutional investors gaining exposure to the space via an approved bitcoin spot ETF for example.'\n\nThe biggest crypto risers of 2023\n\nSo which are the biggest crypto risers of 2023 so far?\n\nTurning back to what we have seen in 2023 so far, it is not bitcoin that has risen the most, despite the hopes of what next year will bring.\n\nHere are the top ten cryptos by market cap ranked by the amount they have risen year to date.\n\n'Stablecoins' which do not move in price have been excluded. It should also be noted that some other cryptoassets outside the top ten in total size have risen by much more.\n\n1. Solana\n\nSolana is up 560 per cent year to date to $68 for a market cap of $29 billion (5-year performance: 4,700 per cent). It is the native token of the Solana blockchain, an alternative smart contract platform that offers similar functionality to Ethereum. It was dragged down heavily by the collapse of the FTX exchange last year but has since recovered strongly.\n\n2. Chainlink\n\nChainlink is up 145 per cent this year to $14.50 for a market cap of $8 billion (5-year performance: 18,000 per cent). Chainlink is a network of 'oracles' which provide real word information to blockchains, such as the price of gold for example.\n\n3. Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is 148 per cent higher year to date at $41,250 for a market cap of $807 billion. The original crypto then kicked the whole thing off. Many expect 2024 to be a great year for BTC for the reasons discussed earlier.\n\n4. Avalanche\n\nAvalanche is up 157 per cent year to date at $38 for a market cap of $14 billion (3-year performance: 829 per cent). A smart contract platform that aims to be faster and cheaper than Ethereum while offering similar applications.\n\n5. Tron\n\nTron is up 86 per cent to 10 cents for a market cap of $9.5 billion (5-year performance: 670 per cent). Another smart contract platform. Tron was founded by Chinese businessman and investor Justin Sun in May 2018.\n\n6. XRP\n\nXRP is up 69 per cent this year to 61 cents for a market cap of $33 billion (5-year performance: 100 per cent). This is a coin distributed by software company Ripple as a vehicle for making international bank transfers. It is yet to be widely used in this way but has a loyal following.\n\n7. Ethereum\n\nEther is up 75 per cent year to date to $2,200 for a market cap of $264 billion. The first and most widely used smart contract platform. The decentralised finance space (DeFi) and non-fungible token industry (NFTs) began life on Ethereum.\n\n8. Cardano\n\nCardano is 116 per cent higher in 2023 so far to hit 57 cents for a market cap of $19.5 billion (5-year performance: 2,600 per cent). An alternative smart contract platform. Adoption of Cardano remains light years behind Ethereum but its has a dedicated community of supporters.\n\n9. Dogecoin\n\nDogecoin is up 50 per cent in 2023 so far to 9.4 cents for a market cap of $13.3 billion (5-year performance: 2,149 per cent). The original 'memecoin.' Doge was started as a joke and has no real use but its price rises have been powered by internet virality - and kind words from Elon Musk.\n\n10. Binance Coin\n\nBinance Coin is the one top tenner down for 2023 so far. It is 5 per cent lower at $256 for a market cap of $38 billion (5-year performance: 4,755 per cent). The native coin of the Binance crypto exchange and smart contract blockchain. The coin has struggled this year due in part to legal troubles in America.\n\nWant to explore crypto investing?

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Has Hit New all-Time Highs In Six Countries | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "The Bitcoin price has risen around 80% this year, bringing it to its highest levels of 2023. However, the leading cryptocurrency has still not reached its all-time high of $69,000. Nevertheless, this has not stopped the asset from hitting multiple new all-time high prices in as many as six countries.\n\nSix Countries See New Bitcoin All-Time Highs\n\nThe official X (formerly Twitter) account of Middle-Eastern restaurant Tahini\u2019s, which has been a staunch supporter of Bitcoin, took to the social media platform to share an interesting development. Tahini\u2019s post which came with multiple screenshots showed how Bitcoin has risen to new all-time highs across six countries.\n\nThis is what #Bitcoin looks like for the citizens of Turkey, Egypt, Nigeria, Argentina, Lebanon and Pakistan.\n\nA combined population of\n\n725 MILLION people\n\nTry to convince them Bitcoin is not useful. Good luck \ud83d\ude09 pic.twitter.com/z8poh2C7Wb \u2014 Tahini\u2019s (@TheRealTahinis) December 13, 2023\n\nThe charts shared carried the all-time performance of Bitcoin against the local currencies of these countries which were identified to be Egypt, Nigeria, Lebanon, Pakistan, Turkey, and Argentina. In every single one of these countries, the Bitcoin price has rallied continuously. Where Bitcoin has failed to reclaim its all-time high in terms of dollar value, it has reached new ATHs against the Egyptian Pound, Nigerian Naira, Lebanese pound, Pakistani Rupee, Turkish lira, and Argentine Peso.\n\nTahini\u2019s post showed the BTC price had hit new all-time highs in these countries in a single day on December 12. But one interesting fact from the post was about the Argentine peso. At the time of the initial post, one BTC was worth 15,176,100 Argentine pesos. However, following Argentina\u2019s currency debasement, it surged more than 100% again to reach a new high of 33,677,222 Argentine pesos.\n\nBTC price still trending below $43,000 | Source: BTCUSD On Tradingview.com\n\nWhat Is Driving This Increase?\n\nThe significant Bitcoin price increase being experienced in these countries is a result of the high inflation rates that are currently plaguing these countries. As inflation takes hold and these currencies fall against the US dollar, the price of Bitcoin rises drastically.\n\nFor example, Lebanon\u2019s inflation rate is currently sitting at 208%, one of the highest in the world. Argentina\u2019s inflation rate is the second-highest on this list at 135%. This is why President-Elect Javier Milei seems to take a strong stance on Bitcoin as he aims to combat these high inflation rates during his time in office.\n\nIn the same vein, all of the other countries on this list are also seeing inflation rates of at least 29%. Egypt is sitting at 35.7%, Nigeria, at 30.6%, Turkey At 64%, and Pakistan at 29.4%.\n\nGiven this data, perhaps it is also not surprising that these countries also boast some of the highest crypto adoption rates in the world as residents try to protect their wealth. Argentina, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Turkey all appear in the top 20 of the Global Crypto Adoption Index released by Chainalysis in 2023.\n\nFeatured image from Crypto News, chart from Tradingview.com"
