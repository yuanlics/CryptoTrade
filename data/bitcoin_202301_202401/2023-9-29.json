        "title": "Bitcoin ETFs: A $600B tipping point for crypto - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "A United States appellate court directed the Securities and Exchange Commission in August to reassess its denial of Grayscale\u2019s application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). A little-noted consequence of that decision is that it could open the floodgates for $600 billion in new cash to enter the cryptocurrency market.\n\nETFs provide investors with a regulated way to gain exposure to different asset classes, including Bitcoin (BTC). The approval of a Bitcoin ETF could democratize investment in the cryptocurrency sector, drawing parallels to how the iShares MSCI Brazil ETF and the VanEck Brazil Small-Cap ETF have democratized investing in the Brazilian market.\n\nDespite some hurdles, market analysts anticipate potential Bitcoin ETF approval by early 2024. A Bitcoin ETF could unlock an estimated $600 billion in new demand, according to a September report by analysts at Bernstein, more than doubling the approximately $550 billion fully diluted market cap at which Bitcoin stands today.\n\nRelated: 10 years later, still no Bitcoin ETF \u2014 but who cares?\n\nHowever, these predictions are speculative, with the actual outcome depending on various factors such as market dynamics, company strategies and regulatory responses. Notably, the SEC has delayed the decision on Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF application several times already. In August, Wood expressed her expectation for these delays, stating that she believed the SEC would approve multiple Bitcoin ETFs simultaneously. But on Sept. 26, the SEC extended the decision period further, to Jan. 10.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s delays and rejections of Bitcoin ETF applications have drawn criticism and fueled investor frustration. A bipartisan group of lawmakers urged Gensler this month to grant immediate approval for an ETF, arguing that post-Grayscale court decision, there\u2019s no reason to deny spot crypto ETFs, which they believe would enhance investor safeguards. This congressional pressure further complicates the path to Bitcoin ETF approval, adding to the uncertainty as the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF decision date approaches.\n\nIn tandem with the SEC\u2019s deliberations over Bitcoin ETFs, major players in the crypto industry are actively lobbying for new rules. Coinbase, for instance, is spearheading one of the largest lobbying pushes in the crypto industry, aiming to garner support among lawmakers for the introduction of new regulations. As we continue to observe these unfolding developments, it becomes increasingly clear that the future of crypto regulations is being hotly contested.\n\nRecent developments suggest more potential delays in the approval of Bitcoin ETFs on the whole. James Seyffart, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, speculated that the SEC\u2019s recent decisions may have dampened prospects for ETF approval in 2023. Filings from major players such as BlackRock, Bitwise and Wisdomtree are slated for review in the third week of October. However, the SEC\u2019s recent actions on ARK 21Shares have sparked speculation that other filings due for review in mid-October \u2014 including those from VanEck, Invesco, Fidelity and Valkyrie \u2014 could also experience delays. So, it remains to be seen whether there will be any significant updates on these applications soon.\n\nTo better understand the implications of these ETFs, let\u2019s delve into the concept of assets under management (AUM), which represents the total market value of the financial assets an entity or adviser manages on behalf of their clients. This crucial metric in the investment world serves as an indicator of performance. Consider the following table for more insight.\n\nFinancial institutions with higher AUM, like BlackRock, could generate more revenue from management fees if they successfully launch a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nAs competition in the Bitcoin ETF market intensifies, it may drive down management fees, impacting revenue.\n\nInvestment firms charge these fees for managing funds, typically ranging from 0.2% to 2%. A trend of decreasing management fees has been observed recently due to increased competition, cost-effective investment strategies and investor demand for transparency.\n\nHow does Grayscale generate revenue from ETFs?\n\nGrayscale generates its revenue from its exchange-traded funds, such as the proposed Bitcoin ETF, through management fees. These fees are calculated as a percentage of the total AUM.\n\nFor its existing product, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the company charges an annual fee of 2%.\n\nLet\u2019s break down how this works with some real numbers. If we take the reported $16.2 billion in assets in the Bitcoin Trust and apply the 2% management fee, it means that Grayscale would generate $324 million per year in management fees from the Bitcoin Trust alone.\n\nIf Grayscale succeeds in converting GBTC to a Bitcoin ETF, the AUM could potentially increase due to the appeal of ETFs to institutional investors, boosting management fees. However, Grayscale plans to lower fees upon conversion to an ETF, although specific figures have not been provided.\n\nRelated: BlackRock\u2019s misguided effort to create \u2018Crypto for Dummies\u2019\n\nThe conversion is subject to SEC approval. Grayscale recently won a legal case against the SEC, paving the way for spot Bitcoin ETF approval. Simultaneously, the SEC extended its decision-making period on ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF.\n\nBitcoin ETF approval would be a significant step toward mainstream crypto acceptance. The court ruling questions the SEC\u2019s sole authority over digital assets, suggesting other entities like courts and Congress can influence crypto regulations. This could lead to wider crypto acceptance, making Bitcoin investing more accessible and regulated, attracting more capital to the crypto market.\n\nThe potential approval could also have geopolitical implications, setting a precedent for other countries and accelerating global adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nOf course, numerous hurdles remain, notwithstanding the court\u2019s ruling. But it signified progress, and rewards await those ready to embrace change.\n\nConstantin Kogan is a co-founder of BullPerks and GamesPad, a partner at BitBull Capital, the founder of Adwivo and a former managing director at Wave Financial.

        "title": "What Historically Happens to Bitcoin During a US Government Shutdown? - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Bitcoin is a digital asset that is well-known for its durability and independence from traditional financial systems. However, even this decentralized powerhouse is vulnerable to the effects of big external events, such as US government shutdowns. We'll look at previous occurrences, the cryptocurrency's behavior, and the lessons learnt from these events to better understand the historical relationships between Bitcoin and US government shutdowns.\n\nThe Coincidence of Bitcoin and Government Shutdowns\n\nWhen the US Congress fails to pass legislation funding federal agencies and services, the government shuts down. Non-essential government services are temporarily halted during such times, and federal employees may be furloughed or work without pay. These occurrences are frequently the result of political deadlock and fiscal conflicts.\n\nAs a decentralized digital money, Bitcoin works independently of government control. Market forces, supply and demand dynamics, and investor mood all influence its value. The bitcoin market, however, is not insulated from the broader financial environment, and events such as government shutdowns can have repercussions.\n\nGovernment shutdowns and market turpitude\n\nIncreased market uncertainty is one prominent characteristic of Bitcoin's behavior during US government shutdowns. As the shutdown's duration and possible economic consequences remain unknown, investors and traders may become more risk-averse. This sentiment may spread to the bitcoin market, increasing price volatility.\n\nBitcoin has historically seen price changes during government shutdowns, with both upward and downward moves. The magnitude and direction of these price swings are frequently determined by a variety of factors, such as global economic conditions, investor sentiment, and the overall stability of financial markets.\n\nIs Bitcoin a Safe Haven?\n\nDuring times of economic and political crisis, Bitcoin has been promoted as a \"safe haven\" asset, similar to gold. Proponents believe that because of its decentralized nature and limited supply, it is an appealing store of value when traditional assets, such as fiat currencies or stocks, confront uncertainty.\n\nSome investors may flock to Bitcoin during government shutdowns as a hedge against potential economic disruptions. This inflow of cash has the potential to enhance demand and, as a result, put upward pressure on Bitcoin's price. However, it is important to emphasize that Bitcoin's designation as a safe haven asset is debatable, and its behavior can vary from crisis to crisis.\n\nA potential surge?\n\nThe looming threat of a United States government shutdown and debt ceiling standoff has once again sparked interest in Bitcoin's price performance. Historically, Bitcoin has responded positively to economic uncertainties, particularly during government shutdowns, witnessing price increases. However, the question on many minds is whether the current political deadlock will lead to a significant Bitcoin price surge.\n\nBitcoin's response to past government shutdowns has been mixed. For example, during the 2013 shutdown, Bitcoin's price surged over 80%, while during the 2018-2019 shutdown, its gains were more modest. The 2013 rally saw Bitcoin's price jump from around $133 to over $1,000, while during the 2018-2019 shutdown, its price increased from $3,207 to $4,244, but with higher volatility.\n\nBitcoin's price behavior during government shutdowns remains uncertain, but its potential as a safe-haven asset during times of economic uncertainty continues to attract attention and speculation from investors worldwide. As the U.S. grapples with its current challenges, all eyes are on Bitcoin to see how it responds to the evolving economic landscape.\n\nHistorical Illustrations\n\nTo obtain insight on Bitcoin's behavior during government shutdowns, let's look at two recent shutdowns:\n\n1. The Government Shutdown of 2013:\n\nDue to differences over the federal budget, the US government shut down for 16 days in 2013. During this time, Bitcoin saw significant price volatility. The price of cryptocurrencies fluctuated significantly, initially rising to record highs as some investors sought refuge in digital assets. However, as the closure continued, Bitcoin's price retraced, reflecting the concern in the broader market.\n\n2. The Government Shutdown of 2018-2019:\n\nThe 35-day government shutdown, which began in December 2018 and lasted until January 2019, was the longest in US history. During this time, Bitcoin's behavior was more nuanced. While there was fluctuation, there was no continuous trend. Some investors viewed Bitcoin as a viable hedge, while others remained cautious in the face of persistent economic concerns.\n\nImportant Takeaways\n\nSeveral major takeaways may be drawn from past data on Bitcoin's performance during US government shutdowns:\n\nIncreased Volatility: During government shutdowns, Bitcoin's price volatility often spikes, indicating market uncertainty and shifting investor opinion.\n\nMixed Reaction: The cryptocurrency's reaction to government shutdowns is not consistent. Depending on the circumstances, it might exhibit both upward and downward price swings.\n\nBitcoin is occasionally regarded as a potential hedge against economic turbulence, drawing investors looking for alternative assets during times of crisis.\n\nMarket Independence: Because Bitcoin is decentralized, it can operate independently of government activities, giving it some independence from existing financial institutions.\n\nBitcoin may reflect certain patterns during government shutdowns, but there are no certainties about how it will react in future occurrences. A complicated combination of factors influences the bitcoin market.\n\nLooking Forward\n\nAs the cryptocurrency world evolves, it is critical for investors and traders to approach Bitcoin and other digital assets with a comprehensive grasp of their distinct qualities. While past data might provide insights, it's crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency market is still in its early stages and can be influenced by a variety of internal and external factors.\n\nPrudent risk management measures are essential for people contemplating Bitcoin as part of their investing portfolio. Diversification, rigorous study, and a long-term view are useful strategies for navigating the volatility and flexibility of the bitcoin market.\n\nFinally, Bitcoin's interaction with US government shutdowns highlights its status as a dynamic and changing asset class. While it may show signs of resilience and hedging potential, it is nevertheless vulnerable to the broader dynamics that affect financial markets. As government shutdowns and other external events continue, the cryptocurrency market's reaction will be widely followed, providing vital insight into Bitcoin's increasing role in the global financial scene."

        "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States have already witnessed tremendous growth, and now there\u2019s an increasing number of solid applications to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs by some of the largest traditional financial institutions.\n\nBy taking those two factors into account, along with Grayscale's recent court battle win and Franklin Templeton's spot Bitcoin ETF application, it seems that it\u2019s a matter of when spot Bitcoin ETFs will be available to investors rather than if this will happen.\n\nWhen they\u2019re available, they will help to streamline and facilitate mainstream institutional adoption of digital assets in the United States.\n\nETF Growth in the United States and World\n\nETFs can be a logical choice for investors: cost-efficient and easily accessible. As a quick overview, total U.S. ETF net assets under management (AUM) have exploded from $102B in 2002 to $6.44T in 2022.\n\nProjected growth hasn\u2019t stagnated, either. According to BlackRock\u2014which shows a global total of $10T USD in ETFs in 2022\u2014this financial product could reach $14T in value, worldwide, by the end of 2024.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs are a natural progression in this financial product.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs\n\nAlthough debate still exists about whether a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States would create a pathway to mainstream crypto adoption, many people in the digital asset world are increasingly optimistic\u2014both about the potential for approval and its impact.\n\nWe believe this approval will help to bring fresh capital into the market through demand for the product. Spot Bitcoin ETFs allow people to directly invest in Bitcoin in simplified ways. Investments are based on current market prices with the owners holding the crypto like they would a stock within the fund, which would make it feel familiar to people who are used to investing but new to crypto.\n\nThese opportunities already exist in Canada and are launching in Europe; currently, though, eyes are on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the spot Bitcoin ETF application from BlackRock\u2014which was quickly followed up by applications from additional traditional finance mainstays; the following have filed for a Nasdaq spot Bitcoin ETF listing: Fidelity, VanEck, Invesco, WisdomTree, Valkyrie, and Bitwise.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo date, the SEC has not approved any spot Bitcoin ETF applications, citing market manipulation of Bitcoin prices as the primary reason for most rejections. BlackRock\u2019s (BLK) iShares Bitcoin Trust application, though, contains an element that may cause the SEC to agree to the fund\u2019s creation: a proposed surveillance-sharing agreement with Nasdaq and a large U.S. digital asset exchange that will serve as a barrier against market manipulation.\n\nThis surveillance-sharing agreement would provide transparency in market trading and clearing activities as well as customer identification. Plus, if this approach meets the SEC\u2019s approval, it would serve as a guidebook for other companies to follow.\n\nOnce these spot ETFs are available, providing ease of investing in Bitcoin, it will naturally lead to more institutional flows of funds\u2014especially as the number of distribution sources increases. Because Bitcoin supply is limited to 21MM, this capped availability could provide a positive price action as increasing numbers of institutional investors have more seamless access to the coins.\n\nBecause the likelihood of SEC approval seems high, several major asset managers have recently applied to offer Ethereum ETFs: Van Eck, Volatility Shares, Bitwise, Grayscale, Roundhill, and Proshares.\n\nHedge Funds Increasing Exposure to Digital Assets\n\nOn a related topic, \u201cRebuilding confidence in crypto: 5th Annual Global Crypto Hedge Fund Report (2023)\u201d notes how traditional hedge funds have continued to look at increasing their digital asset exposure despite the volatile 2022 environment.\n\nMore than half of the traditional hedge funds currently investing in crypto-assets intend to maintain the same levels of capital deployed this year while nearly half (46 percent) intend to deploy more capital into this asset class by the end of 2023. Notably, none of the respondents said they planned to reduce their exposure.\n\nCrypto curiosity has edged up among those funds not yet investing in crypto-assets. More than one-third (37 percent) of survey respondents confirm that they\u2019re simply waiting for further maturity before investing\u2014with more than two-thirds (69 percent) of the curious survey participants being hedge funds managing over a billion dollars.\n\nOptimism about the future reigns: 93 percent of crypto hedge funds expect crypto-asset market capitalization to be higher at the end of 2023 than it was at the end of 2022.\n\nAs for the investors in crypto hedge funds, they want the following: mandatory asset segregation; mandatory financial audits; independent statements of reserve assets; and platform security. To further build confidence with these investors, the hedge fund industry is increasing their use of standard liquidity management tools and enhancing their counterparty risk management policies. They\u2019re focusing on optimal custody solutions, and use for third-party custodians is strong with 80 percent of crypto and traditional hedge funds selecting this as their primary custody route.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s proposed rule on qualified custodians would further regulations in that direction, appropriately segregating assets and otherwise protecting investors\u2014which meshes with what the hedge fund industry and its investors desire in risk management.\n\nETFs Offer the Best Avenue to Traditional Financial Adoption Today\n\nSpot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs available through trusted traditional financial institutions will break down barriers and streamline mainstream adoption, helping investors navigate a crypto ecosystem that might seem complex and feel intimidating.\n\nOnce available through familiar traditional financial institutions, the process will feel more comfortable and welcoming. Some investors may limit digital asset exposure to ETFs while others may ultimately expand beyond that into the broader world of crypto investing. Traditional asset managers increasing allocations to digital assets will also help to drive mainstream adoption going forward.\n\nAdam Sporn is BitGo\u2019s Head of Prime Brokerage and US Institutional Sales.\n\nRead the original post on The Defiant"

        "title": "$3 Billion in Bitcoin Options Expire Today\u2014What Will That Do to BTC's Price? - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nGet ready: Roughly $3 billion in Bitcoin options contracts will expire later today. But what does that mean for the price of the biggest cryptocurrency?\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin was up 0.2% in the past 24 hours\u2014trading hands for $26,921, according to CoinGecko. The asset has brought the rest of the market with it, with most digital coins and tokens in the green.\n\nBut with Bitcoin options contracts set to expire, the price of cryptocurrency could dip or swing up even higher, right?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNot necessarily. According to experts who spoke to Decrypt, it\u2019s unlikely the price of Bitcoin will budge that much.\n\nData from CME Group shows that $9 billion worth of open interest\u2014or unexpired options contracts. And of those, $3 billion will expire today.\n\nA Bitcoin options contract is a deal that lets buyers snap up Bitcoin at an agreed-upon price\u2014regardless of whether the price changes by the time the contract expires, which can be many months later.\n\nThis means traders don\u2019t have to buy the Bitcoin when the contract expires\u2014they just can if they want to.\n\nThis means that if all that Bitcoin isn\u2019t bought by Friday, it will be either held or dumped. This would lead one to believe that it could cause price volatility.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t usually happen. Anders Helseth, head of research at K33, told Decrypt that \u201cin general, options expiries in crypto don\u2019t affect prices much.\u201d\n\nWhile CryptoQuant contributing analyst BaroVirtual added that the current data \u201cindicates no clear bullish or bearish sentiment.\u201d\n\nHe added that it \u201cwas likely\u201d Bitcoin would continue to trade between $26,500 and $27,250 in October.\n\n\u201cThe tiny options volume by expiration also confirms the thesis that Bitcoin will probably not expect large-scale price spikes in the coming days,\u201d he noted.\n\nAlthough the price of Bitcoin has historically been volatile, that looks like it is changing. And it doesn\u2019t look like $3 billion in options contracts will make much of a difference, either."

        "title": "Quarterly Investment Guide 4Q 2023: Bitcoin outlook - CNBC",
        "content": "Patient bitcoin investors may have to hold their composure for at least another quarter as the Federal Reserve's outlook on interest rate policy dampens what might have been an even stronger month for the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has had a difficult but decent year so far. The flagship cryptocurrency is up more than 60% for the year, according to Coin Metrics, thanks to a big run up in the first quarter. Not much has happened since, however. Bitcoin is down about 5% since April 1, and subsequent gains from any of several positive developments in the industry this year \u2013 like Ripple's win in the SEC's lawsuit against it, Grayscale's victory in its SEC suit, and several financial giants putting their names in the hat for a bitcoin ETF \u2013 have failed to hold. In the final quarter of the year, bitcoin is likely to see continued chop and although there's room for some upside, it may be limited. \"If we have positive ETF developments, I could see us going back to the top of the range that we saw this year,\" said Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at crypto data provider Amberdata. Bitcoin has traded in a narrow range of between $25,000 and $30,000 since about March. A bitcoin ETF getting the green light is widely regarded as a key event that would push bitcoin to a new high and bring liquidity and trading volumes back into crypto. Read more from CNBC Pro's Quarterly Investment Guide Wall Street sees the market's bumpy ride continuing in the 4th quarter. Here are the risks in store Danger, 'pothole' ahead: Economic growth slowing to a near-halt to end the year Oil prices and the dollar surged in the third quarter. These ETFs can help you reset your portfolio After a rough third quarter, here's what to expect from technology stocks into the end of 2023 These underperforming stocks are due for a fourth-quarter comeback, according to Wall Street Supply cuts from Saudi Arabia remain price drivers for oil heading into the fourth quarter \"One of the big problems with us breaking out into new high territories is we still have this backdrop of a hawkish Fed that's dragging on risk assets across the board,\" he added. \"A crypto-specific catalyst could bring us up to the top of that range, but the macro is still a headwind. That probably prevents us from breaking to new highs on the year.\" Last week, at the conclusion of the Federal Reserve's September policy meeting, the central bank hit pause on rate hikes but indicated it could hold rates at higher levels for longer than previously thought. Rob Ginsberg, a chart analyst at Wolfe Research, said he wouldn't be surprised to see bitcoin break below $25,000, a key support level for the cryptocurrency, when rates break out to new cycle highs. When the Fed pivots on rate hikes, investors could expect a \"violent\" rotation back into risk , he said. Still, bitcoin is currently on pace to end September, typically its worst month of the year, up more than 3%. That would mark its first positive month in the quarter. Typically, it has ended the month in the red in eight of the last 10 years, according to CoinGlass. Despite this, it remains on pace for an 11% decline in the third quarter, historically a weaker quarter for the cryptocurrency. That would make it its sixth third-quarter loss in 11 years. Bitcoin is entering a historically upbeat period. The cryptocurrency has posted a monthly gain in eight out of the last 10 Octobers and a fourth-quarter gain in six of the last 10 years. Blame it on interest rates In a year when the Fed has continued to raise rates \u2013 and following a year when its rate hiking drove much of bitcoin's price \u2013 inflation data and monetary policy haven't been big drivers for bitcoin the way industry-specific catalysts have been. That influence may be back in play in Q4, however, after it hinted at higher rates for longer last week. \"The Fed has put markets and the economy in conservation mode by forcing investors to make hard choices with their money, and it reminded us last week that they may not switch back to innovation mode any time soon,\" said Callie Cox, analyst at investment company eToro. \"People are more concerned about protecting their portfolios than taking a shot at the next, hot thing in crypto. That's weighed on trading volumes, liquidity and speculation within the industry.\" With bitcoin as the digital gold play for investors and ether as the crypto tech play, higher rates could continue to weigh more heavily on ether, which is up about half as much as bitcoin in 2023 and on pace to post a more than 13% loss for the quarter. Meanwhile, holding a non-yielding asset like gold or bitcoin could become \"less interesting\" as rates go higher, Amberdata's Magadini said. BTC.CM= ETH.CM= YTD mountain Bitcoin's biggest gains may be in for the year, but there's still some room for more limited upside in Q4. But that could be good for bitcoin, which is sitting in the middle of a shift from speculative to quality investments, according to Cox. While bitcoin as a risky investment to traditional-minded investors lining it up against stocks and bonds, for the crypto-focused investor, bitcoin is a relatively stable store of value and a hedge against the traditional financial system, which has shown cracks this year that supported that narrative. There's a significant crowd on both sides, Cox said \u2013 \"that's why bitcoin is up 60% in a year when the Fed has hiked interest rates so aggressively.\" \"Bitcoin is at levels where it could struggle technically, but in a weird way, you may continue to see money flow into well-known cryptocurrencies because of the focus on quality,\" said Cox. \"That's the story of the fourth quarter: how does the appetite for quality collide with the appetite for speculation? The answer to that depends on interest rates, which will probably stay high.\""

        "title": "Bitcoin's inflation-hedge theory tested as rising interest rates bring turbulence to markets - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The United States economy has been facing turbulent times lately, with the U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) inflation index rising by a significant 3.5% over the past 12 months. Even when excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, it\u2019s evident that the efforts made by the U.S. Federal Reserve to curb inflation have fallen short of their 2% target rate.\n\nU.S. Treasurys have lost a staggering $1.5 trillion in value, primarily due to these rate hikes. This has led investors to question whether Bitcoin (BTC) and risk-on assets, including the stock market, will succumb to heightened interest rates and a monetary policy aimed at cooling economic growth.\n\nTheoretical losses of U.S. Treasury holders, USD. Source: Joe Consorti\n\nAs the U.S. Treasury keeps flooding the market with debt, there\u2019s a real risk that rates could climb even higher, exacerbating the losses to fixed-income investors. An additional $8 trillion in government debt is expected to mature in the next 12 months, further contributing to financial instability.\n\nAs Daniel Porto, the head of Deaglo London, pointed out in remarks to Reuters:\n\n\u201c(The Fed) are going to play a game where inflation is going to lead, but the real question is can we sustain this course without doing a lot of damage?\u201d\n\nPorto's comments resonate with a growing concern in financial circles \u2014 a fear that the central bank might tighten its policies to the point where it causes severe disruptions to the financial system.\n\nHigh interest rates eventually have devastating consequences\n\nOne of the primary drivers behind the recent turmoil in financial markets is the rise in interest rates. As rates increase, the prices of existing bonds fall, a phenomenon known as interest rate risk or duration. This risk isn\u2019t limited to specific groups \u2014 it affects countries, banks, companies, individuals and anyone holding fixed-income instruments.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Index has experienced a 6.6% drop in September alone. Additionally, the yield on the U.S. 10-year bonds climbed to 4.7% on Sept. 28, marking its highest level since August 2007. This surge in yields demonstrates that investors are becoming increasingly hesitant to take the risk of holding long-term bonds, even those issued by the government itself.\n\nBanks, which typically borrow short-term instruments and lend for the long term, are especially vulnerable in this environment. They rely on deposits and often hold Treasurys as reserve assets.\n\nWhen Treasurys lose value, banks may find themselves short of the necessary funds to meet withdrawal requests. This compels them to sell Treasurys and other assets, pushing them dangerously close to insolvency and requiring rescue by institutions like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or larger banks. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic Bank and Signature Bank serves as a warning of the financial system instability.\n\nFederal Reserve shadow intervention could near exhaustion\n\nWhile emergency mechanisms such as the Federal Reserve's emergency loan Bank Term Funding Program can provide some relief by allowing banks to post impaired Treasurys as collateral, these measures do not make the losses magically disappear.\n\nBanks are increasingly offloading their holdings to private credit and hedge funds, flooding these sectors with rate-sensitive assets. This trend is poised to worsen if the debt ceiling is increased to avoid a government shutdown, further raising yields and amplifying losses in the fixed-income markets.\n\nAs long as interest rates remain high, the risk of financial instability grows, prompting the Federal Reserve to support the financial system using emergency credit lines. That is highly beneficial for scarce assets like Bitcoin, given the increasing inflation and the worsening profile of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet as measured by the $1.5 trillion paper losses in U.S Treasurys.\n\nTiming this event is almost impossible, let alone what would happen if larger banks consolidate the financial system or if the Federal Reserve effectively guarantees liquidity for troubled financial institutions. Still, there\u2019s hardly a scenario where one would be pessimistic with Bitcoin under those circumstances.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "SEC drags on with spot Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum futures get a nod - InvestmentNews",
        "content": "The SEC gave a big present to crypto ETF firms late last week ahead of the government shutdown that appeared inevitable, reportedly granting approval for a number of ethereum futures strategies that could start trading soon.\n\nFirst on its list appears to be Valkyrie Funds, which had filed with the regulator to add ethereum futures to its existing Bitcoin Strategy ETF. Another firm, VanEck, announced Thursday that it would soon launch its Ethereum Futures ETF, declining to give a precise date. And according to reporting by Reuters, the biggest bitcoin futures ETF shop, ProShares, was also granted approval. That firm similarly announced on its site that its three ETFs featuring ethereum futures would be available soon.\n\nThe development, much as any previous indications that the SEC might be moving forward with approval of crypto-themed funds, led to a mass of additional filings for products. Other firms that essentially got in line for approval by the SEC include Kelly ETFs and Bitwise.\n\nBut the apparent approvals of ethereum futures ETF followed news that likely upset crypto fund proponents, with the SEC indicating a further delay in approving spot bitcoin products. Since Grayscale Investments\u2019 recent court win over the SEC\u2019s denial of its application, there has been mounting pressure on the agency to begin approving spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\u201cThe SEC has been clearing their desks ahead of the possible government shutdown, which means issuing delays for spot bitcoin ETF filings while likely allowing ether future ETFs to potentially begin trading early next week,\u201d Roxanna Islam, head of sector and industry research at VettaFi, said in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that these products will be accelerated to launch sooner than later before the government shutdown occurs.\u201d\n\nThat shutdown was temporarily averted on Saturday, with Congress approving a spending bill that will continue to keep the government open for 45 days.\n\nOn Friday, Valkyrie filed an update with the SEC in which it appeared to back away from an immediate launch of an ethereum futures strategy within its bitcoin ETF.\n\n\u201cEffectively immediately, the fund will not purchase ether futures contracts until the effectiveness of an amendment to the fund\u2019s registration statement contemplating the addition of ether futures contracts to the principal investment strategy of the fund. Until such time, the fund will unwind any existing positions in ether futures contracts,\u201d the company stated.\n\nWhile the approvals are a step forward for crypto ETF providers, it\u2019s only a minor development compared with the eventual launch of spot products, demand for which is expected to quickly eclipse that of crypto futures ETFs.\n\nAlthough there has been significant interest in the biggest bitcoin futures ETF, the $952 million ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, advisors who want crypto funds are waiting for spot products, said Tyrone Ross, CEO and co-founder of Turnqey Labs.\n\n\u201cFinancial advisors have no interest in futures ETFs. Most advisors want a spot bitcoin or spot ethereum ETF,\u201d Ross said. \u201cAs far as advisors go, it\u2019s a miss.\u201d\n\nThere could be demand among retail investors and hedge funds, but the complicated nature of futures products, on top of the crypto asset class that many people do not understand, make them a tough sell to advisors, he said.\n\n\u201cCrypto is hard enough. But now I have to explain a crypto futures product?\u201d Ross said, adding that the fees for the products can also be discouraging. \u201cFrom a compliance standpoint, it\u2019s going to be hard to get a futures product [approved].\u201d\n\nRoss is not a fan of ETFs for crypto in any form, but said that the \u201cbroader wealth management space is a little giddy\u201d as the ethereum futures ETF approvals \u201cmeans more pressure is being put on [SEC Chair] Gary Gensler and that we are closer to approval of a spot ETF.\u201d\n\nGiven that anyone who wants to hold ethereum can do so through a U.S. exchange, the futures ETFs approval \u201cis kind of a nothingburger,\u201d said Mike Alfred, whose hedge fund Alpine Fox focuses on bitcoin and bitcoin-related equities.\n\n\u201cIt may be bullish for ethereum traders in the short term,\u201d as the approvals mean another avenue of quasi access to it, he said.\n\nSpot products will offer lower fees compared with those of futures products, Alfred said.\n\n\u201cThe real embedded cost of owning a futures product is a lot higher,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the risk of underperforming the actual asset is high.\u201d\n\nFor example, while the price of bitcoin has increased by 62% so far this year, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF has returned less than 32%.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think an ethereum futures [ETF] approval is much of a watershed moment,\u201d Alfred said. \u201cIf anything, it shows how backwards-thinking the SEC is on this.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story was updated to reflect the temporary spending bill passed on Saturday by Congress."

        "title": "How to start mining cryptocurrency: A beginner's guide - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency mining has become a popular way for individuals to make money online by confirming transactions on blockchain networks. In exchange for completing complex mathematical challenges, miners are rewarded with newly minted currency.\n\nThe proof-of-work (PoW) consensus method is used in cryptocurrency mining, which requires miners to solve challenging mathematical puzzles, making it difficult for malicious actors and preserving the integrity of the network.\n\nThis comprehensive guide will explain how to start mining different cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), Ether (ETH), Zcash (ZEC), and Monero (XMR).\n\nHow to mine Bitcoin\n\nThe process of creating new Bitcoin and adding transactions to the blockchain is known as Bitcoin mining. In exchange for using computing power to crack complex mathematical puzzles, miners receive newly created BTC and transaction fees.\n\nTo mine Bitcoin, the first crucial step is acquiring the proper hardware. The use of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) is the most popular and effective method of mining Bitcoin. These are specialist devices created just for mining Bitcoin. They are more powerful than general-purpose CPUs or GPUs.\n\nBitcoin miners have two main options for mining the cryptocurrency: solo mining and pool mining. Solo mining is the act of mining alone and making an autonomous attempt to break blocks. Although a successful miner may receive the entire block reward with this strategy, it has become more difficult due to the enormous processing power needed to compete in the current mining environment.\n\nHowever, pool mining is the most popular and practical option for most miners. In pool mining, individuals join a collective group in which their combined processing capacity is used. Blocks are solved by the mining pool as a whole, and rewards are distributed based on the computational power of the individual pool members. Even though the incentives are smaller than solo mining, pool mining lowers the volatility in earnings and makes it a more reliable option for miners to receive rewards.\n\nMiners must download and set up mining software suitable for their hardware and preferred mining pool after deciding on the mining strategy that works best for them. CGMiner, BFGMiner and BitMinter are a few examples of mining software. Once set up, miners can watch for the efficiency and revenue of their mining operation, ensuring that their hardware is adequately powered and vented.\n\nMoreover, miners should carefully analyze the costs of Bitcoin mining, including electricity and hardware expenditures, in addition to knowing the technical aspects of mining. As the environment evolves, staying updated on modifications to mining equipment, wallets, software and the Bitcoin network is critical. Finally, to ensure compliance, miners should always abide by local laws and rules around cryptocurrency mining.\n\nHow to mine Litecoin\n\nLitecoin mining entails verifying transactions on the Litecoin blockchain while earning rewards in the form of newly generated Litecoin and transaction fees. Miners must first purchase specialized hardware, such as ASIC miners, which are made for Scrypt-based cryptocurrencies like Litecoin, to start mining.\n\nNext, choose an appropriate mining pool since solo mining can be very complex. Litecoin mining pools like LTC.top, F2Pool and Antpool allow miners to pool their computing power and raise their chances of winning rewards.\n\nThe next step is for miners to download and set up mining software, such as CGMiner and BFGMiner, that is compatible with their selected hardware and pool. Once everything is set up, miners start working and adding to the combined computational power. When the pool successfully mines a block, rewards are earned.\n\nThese rewards are then divided among participants according to each miner\u2019s contributions. It\u2019s essential to safely store earned LTC in a reliable wallet, keep an eye on mining activity, and stay updated on changes to the network and advancements in the Litecoin ecosystem.\n\nHow to mine Dogecoin\n\nDogecoin mining validates transactions on the Dogecoin blockchain, with miners getting compensated with new Dogecoin and transaction fees. Miners must purchase specialized Scrypt-based ASIC mining equipment made for Dogecoin before choosing between pool and solo mining.\n\nThe next step is to set up appropriate mining software and join a Dogecoin mining pool. Input pool details and worker credentials into the software. A worker is a separate mining instance with its own credentials.\n\nSince each worker has its own set of credentials, it is essentially a distinct mining instance. Miners assign a unique name and password to each worker for identification. One can now start mining and add to the power of the pool. When the pool successfully mines a block, rewards are distributed based on contribution.\n\nCan Shiba Inu (SHIB) be mined like DOGE? It is important to note that traditional mining is not possible with SHIB. It is an Ethereum-based token, not a PoW cryptocurrency that can be mined. One may use exchanges or decentralized platforms to buy, sell or participate in decentralized finance yield farming to obtain SHIB.\n\nHow to mine Ethereum\n\nEthereum has shifted from a PoW consensus process to a proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism. Mining operations have been discontinued under this new arrangement, and validators contribute to the security of Ethereum by staking their Ether holdings.\n\nWith the Merge, Ethereum Classic became the largest PoW smart contract platform. Since both employ the same ETHash algorithm, it inherits miners from Ethereum, making switching to ETC mining pools straightforward. As Ethereum Classic (ETC) is still proof-of-work, miners can contribute hashing power and earn ETC in return.\n\nHow to mine Zcash\n\nMining Zcash involves utilizing computing power to solve challenging mathematical puzzles on the Zcash blockchain network. Due to its use of the Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge, or zk-SNARK, cryptographic technology, which enables anonymous transactions, ZEC is known for its emphasis on privacy.\n\nAn individual requires the appropriate hardware and software to mine Zcash. ASIC miners are often the most effective mining hardware for ZEC because they efficiently carry out the computational processes necessary for mining Zcash.\n\nThe miner must decide whether to mine alone or in an appropriate mining pool, such as Flypool, Nanopool or Slushpool. Many miners prefer mining pools because they provide a more steady revenue stream. Like mining other cryptocurrencies, miners must download and set up mining software compatible with their hardware and decide on a mining pool.\n\nThe address of the pool and the miners\u2019 individual worker credentials must be entered into the mining software to start mining as soon as the setup is complete. Newly produced ZEC and transaction fees are rewards for successfully mining a Zcash block. These incentives are divided among the pool\u2019s members based on their provided computational capacity. To hold ZEC, miners need a secure Zcash wallet.\n\nHow to mine Monero\n\nTo mine Monero, miners must use a computer\u2019s processing capacity to solve challenging mathematical puzzles, adding protection and privacy to Monero transactions. In 2014, Monero adopted the CryptoNight proof-of-work algorithm. Over time, Monero made deliberate changes to the algorithm to purposefully break compatibility with existing ASICs. As a result, three different variants\u2014CryptoNightv1, CryptoNightv2, and Cryptonight-R\u2014emerged.\n\nIt's crucial to note that Monero has subsequently moved away from CryptoNight and its variants. Monero made a huge update in November 2019 by switching its mining algorithm to RandomX. CryptoNight prioritized ASIC resistance, while RandomX focuses on CPU efficiency, making it less susceptible to specialized mining hardware.\n\nIndividuals require hardware and software tools like lXMRig, and CSminer to start mining XMR. Monero mining supports a range of configurations, enabling efficient participation using both CPU and GPU miners. Consistent returns are more likely when miners pool their resources in mining pools. However, according to the Monero Project, solo mining with Monero software helps strengthen the network.\n\nAdditionally, miners can use P2Pool, which offers a cutting-edge method for mining XMR that enables miners to take advantage of frequent rewards while preserving decentralization. Since it functions as a peer-to-peer mining pool, miners have complete control over their Monero nodes and mining operations. The superior block templates from P2Pool add to its blockchain and act as \u201cshares\u201d for miners.\n\nAfter choosing a mining pool, users download and set up mining software specific to their hardware and the specified pool. The pool mining options available to mine XMR include nanopool.org and supportxmr.com, among others. During configuration, miners provide the location of the pool and the credentials of the workers.\n\nTo contribute processing power to the pool\u2019s joint efforts to validate Monero transactions, miners activate their mining software. Successful miners receive XMR, which is allocated according to how much they contributed to the pool, as compensation. After mining XMR, it is crucial to safely store earned XMR in a reliable wallet.\n\nKey risks associated with crypto mining and how to address them\n\nCryptocurrency mining entails risks that miners and organizations should be aware of and successfully manage. First, as countries worldwide develop cryptocurrency legislation, regulatory uncertainty poses a problem. To lessen this, miners should be aware of local laws, pay taxes and consider mining in areas with established crypto legislation.\n\nAnother significant issue is price volatility in cryptocurrencies. Extreme price swings in cryptocurrencies might affect profitability. Miners can deal with this by investing a portion of their earnings in secure assets to lower their exposure to market volatility.\n\nSecurity is also an issue, as hackers target miners to steal cryptocurrencies. Security can be improved by establishing strict security controls, employing reliable mining pool services and keeping offsite backups.\n\nFurthermore, electricity prices, in particular, might reduce earnings. Miners should evaluate the cost-effectiveness of their setup, look into renewable energy sources and choose efficient hardware to reduce this risk.\n\nLast but not least, mining is a highly competitive industry. Earnings are impacted by the gradual increase in mining difficulty.

        "title": "Expect new crypto regulations to follow Bitcoin ETFs - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Aside from liquidity, what do institutions bring to crypto? What precisely is their value? This is an instructive question to ponder because there is little consensus on what deeper institutional participation means for an industry that is riven with contradictions.\n\nThe long-running wait for Bitcoin ETF approval \u2014 giving pensions and funds exposure to BTC \u2014 may well prove to be a positive catalyst for industry growth. But, in focusing on price action, observers are missing out on the real benefit of broadscale institutional adoption. The greatest benefit of deepening institutional adoption may be the regulatory certainty it ushers in.\n\nTax and compliance\n\nThere are a number of areas where institutional involvement is forcing regulators to give straight answers. Chief among these are taxation and compliance. What trades can a business legally make, how should they be disclosed on its balance sheet, and what steps must it take to report these activities?\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETFs: A $600B tipping point for crypto\n\nDetermining what constitutes a taxable event in crypto depends on your dominion. While United States-based traders are required to calculate profit and loss on every trade on a decentralized exchange, perps position and on-chain events, other countries take a less rigorous approach, while a few don\u2019t bother to tax it at all.\n\n#Bitcoin ETFs will be Delayed until the Final Deadline\n\n\n\nThe SEC is trying to show that they are not interested and attempting to push the dates until the final deadline, even though both the SEC and BlackRock know the inevitable outcome.\n\n\n\nBlackRock's ETF should be the first one\u2026 pic.twitter.com/6ZkfUf9WPR \u2014 Mags (@thescalpingpro) September 29, 2023\n\nRegardless of where you reside, determining your obligations when buying, selling and storing digital assets can be a headache. But it could be worse: imagine how much more is at stake for businesses whose public accounts must be scrutinized and which typically require permission to list Bitcoin (BTC) on their balance sheet.\n\nThere are good reasons why a higher bar is set for enterprises in terms of compliance, disclosure, reporting and taxation compared to consumers. It\u2019s a primary reason why it\u2019s taken so long for serious institutional adoption to manifest. But as the trickle of financial firms gaining a foothold in the space turns into a flow, the retinue of lawyers and lobbyists in tow has begun to yield dividends. When BlackRock starts beating the drum for a Bitcoin ETF, even the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has to sit up and take notice.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s favorable court ruling against the SEC on Aug. 29 has shown the power institutions can muster in forcing regulators to renegotiate. The precedent this appeals decision sets will further increase the confidence of institutions in their ability to reframe legislation in their favor.\n\nSeeking regulatory clarity\n\nFor those who already have skin in the game \u2014 sole traders, trading firms, family funds and venture capitalists \u2014 greater institutional involvement can only be a good thing. When the largest institutions decide they want in, it forces regulators to play ball. Not every provision that\u2019s consequently pushed through the statute books will aid the industry \u2014 some will be asinine \u2014 but collectively they provide something that\u2019s been missing for years: clarity.\n\nIs Bitcoin a security? What about Ether (ETH) or Solana (SOL)? The answer, at present, depends on who you ask. Some agencies seem intent on declaring everything bar Bitcoin a security; others take a more measured approach, focusing their enforcement efforts on the most egregious token sales and shills.\n\nRelated: 10 years later, still no Bitcoin ETF \u2014 but who cares?\n\nInstitutions can\u2019t trade assets that lie in regulatory no man\u2019s land: they need black and white, not shades of gray. Their increasing participation in the market is bound to provide clearer answers in terms of crypto classification, which will benefit the entire industry.\n\nIn addition, greater institutional involvement is legitimizing digital assets by making them less exotic to those tasked with regulating them. Crypto opponents can\u2019t justifiably claim the industry to be a hotbed of money laundering and wash trading when its most active participants include the world\u2019s leading trading firms.\n\nSigns of institutional adoption\n\nToday, businesses and governments are pressing ahead with blockchain-based initiatives such as CBDC pilots. In Asia alone, Hong Kong and the Bank of Japan are exploring programs involving digital currencies.\n\nMeanwhile, banks from the U.S. to Europe are introducing crypto custody and trading services for their clients. And in August, Europe\u2019s first spot Bitcoin ETF listed in Amsterdam, proving that institutional willpower eventually gets things done.\n\nRegulators and institutional players are still catching up in terms of expertise to those who helped build the industry from the ground up in its early days through hands-on participation. No one has complete mastery. But as a rising tide lifts all ships, greater institutional involvement will bring benefit to all players, from the humblest yield farmer to the richest whale. Rather than assume any one group has it all figured out, an open and collaborative dialogue is most likely to lead to positive outcomes. Regulators, institutions and early adopters each offer unique insights.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to thank them, but big institutions are a net positive for the industry. Bigger players produce better rules \u2014 and better outcomes for everyone.\n\nGracy Chen is the managing director of the crypto derivatives exchange Bitget, where she oversees market expansion, business strategy, and corporate development.

        "title": "Costo sells out of gold bars, but is it a better investment than Bitcoin? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Costco has made headlines this week after it rapidly sold out of gold bars. In times of economic uncertainty and rising inflation, it's no surprise that investors are turning to traditional safe-haven assets like gold. The question is whether gold\u2019s performance will eventually catapult its price above $2,050, a level last seen in early May.\n\nIn the past 12 months, the price of gold has surged by an impressive 12%. This rally has been partially fueled by the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to combat inflation by maintaining higher interest rates, a move that benefits scarce assets like gold. While gold\u2019s performance is commendable, it\u2019s essential to put it into perspective.\n\nGold (yellow) vs. Bitcoin (orange), S&P 500 (green) and WTI oil (black), last 12 months. Source: TradingView\n\nOver the same period, gold\u2019s returns have roughly matched those of the S&P 500, which saw a gain of 15.4%, and WTI oil, which increased by 12%. However, these gains pale in comparison to Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) staggering 39.5% rise. Still, it\u2019s important to note that gold\u2019s lower volatility at 12% makes it an attractive choice for investors looking to manage risk.\n\nRisk-reward scenarios favor gold\n\nOne of gold\u2019s strongest selling points is its reliability as a store of value during times of crisis and uncertainty. Gold\u2019s status as the world\u2019s largest tradable asset, valued at over $12 trillion, positions it as the primary candidate to benefit from capital inflows whenever investors exit traditional markets like stocks and real estate.\n\nGold (yellow) vs. Bitcoin (orange), S&P 500 (green) and WTI oil (black), Feb/Mar 2020. Source: TradingView\n\nFor example, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, gold only dipped by 2.2% in the 30 days leading up to March 24, 2020.\n\nAccording to data from the World Gold Council, central banks have been net buyers of gold for the second consecutive month, adding 55 tons to their reserves, with notable purchases by China, Poland and Turkey.\n\nBloomberg reported that Russia plans to bolster its gold reserves by an additional $433 million to shield its economy from the volatility of commodity markets, especially in the oil and gas industries.\n\n200 years of gold production. Source: Visual Capitalist\n\nTaking a closer look at production figures, Visual Capitalist estimates that approximately 3,100 tonnes of gold were produced in 2022, with Russia and China accounting for 650 tonnes of this total. The World Gold Council also predicted that if gold prices continue to rise, total production could reach a record high of 3,300 tonnes in 2023.\n\nOne crucial metric to consider when evaluating gold\u2019s investment potential is its stock-to-flow ratio, which measures the production of a commodity relative to the total quantity in existence.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price holds steady as S&P 500 plunges to 110-day low\n\nGold\u2019s stock-to-flow has remained stable at around 67 for the past 12 years. In contrast, Bitcoin has experienced three scheduled halvings, effectively reducing its issuance, and currently boasts a stock-to-flow ratio of 59. This suggests that Bitcoin has a lower equivalent inflation rate compared to the precious metal.\n\nBitcoin can outperform gold even with lower inflows\n\nBitcoin\u2019s performance could surpass gold\u2019s as the U.S. government approaches a shutdown due to reaching the debt limit, causing investors to seek alternative scarce assets. Bitcoin\u2019s $500 billion market capitalization makes it easier for the price to jump even if its inflow is much smaller. Additionally, central banks could be compelled to sell their gold holdings to cover expenses, further boosting Bitcoin\u2019s appeal.\n\nThere\u2019s also the possibility of new gold discoveries. While gold remains a stalwart in the world of safe-haven assets, Bitcoin\u2019s impressive gains and lower equivalent inflation rate make it a strong contender for investors seeking alternative stores of value. Despite this, the ongoing economic uncertainty and the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policies will continue to benefit both assets.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nWith each passing week, it\u2019s getting easier to talk about crypto\u2019s relative stability compared to its performance in recent history\u2014even just a year ago. A cursory glance at some of the headlines of this column over the year reveals we\u2019ve had more slow news weeks than otherwise in 2023.\n\nHowever, we\u2019ve still come a long way since New Year\u2019s Day, when market leader Bitcoin (BTC) sold for roughly $16.5K. The world\u2019s favorite cryptocurrency begins the last weekend of September at a significantly higher price: $26,972. While that's only 2% higher than last week, it's about 60% more valuable than at the start of the year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe market\u2019s biggest contender, Ethereum (ETH), added 4.7% over the last seven days and currently trades for $1,672, or about 40% higher than its New Year's Day price of $1,200.\n\nThis week, the added boost to Ether\u2019s price likely had something to do with the fact that VanEck\u2019s Ethereum Futures Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) was officially confirmed on Thursday.\n\nETFs are regulated investment products that allow investors to gain exposure to crypto without the risks of directly purchasing and storing it. To date, not a single crypto spot ETF has been approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). That\u2019s because spot ETFs are tied to the underlying assets, which are so far unregulated, but various Bitcoin and Ethereum futures ETFs that utilize derivatives are currently trading.\n\nOn Thursday, the SEC delayed delivering a verdict on two pending Ethereum spot ETF applications until after Christmas: Ark Invest and VanEck. The agency also announced that it was putting four major Bitcoin spot ETFs on the backburner: BlackRock, Bitwise, Invesco Galaxy Digital, and Valkyrie.\n\nThe only notable price movements among the thirty biggest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization this week were those of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which rallied 11.8% to $234.13, and Chainlink (LINK), which surged 14% to $7.72.\n\nLINK\u2019s rally was catalyzed by the news that the network has extended cross-chain capabilities to Coinbase\u2019s Ethereum layer-2 network Base. By integrating its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) with Base, the two networks can now interact, send messages, transfer tokens, and perform other functions. Chainlink is also the primary oracle for the Base network.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn other news...\n\nIt was another slow week with relatively few political or institutional developments vis-\u00e0-vis crypto regulation and adoption.\n\nOn Monday, Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) announced new measures to enhance transparency and security in the cryptocurrency space. The initiative comes as authorities in the semi-autonomous city-state grapple with the JPEX incident: a case of suspected fraud involving a Dubai-based crypto exchange operating in Hong Kong\u2019s turf without licensing.\n\nThere are thought to be at least 2,305 victims of the incident, who collectively have been defrauded of HK$1.43 billion ($182.9 million), making JPEX one of the largest cases of financial fraud in Hong Kong history.\n\nFinally, Stablecoin issuer Circle launched its fiat-backed euro-pegged EURC stablecoin on Stellar, the third blockchain to host the coin after Ethereum and Avalanche."

Both drops coincided with the removal of zero fees for the largest BTC trading pairs. However, this time, the decline seems to align more closely with the broad market,\" Ianeva posted on X on Friday.Users left the exchange in April after it cancelled the trading incentives associated with its Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin due to regulatory issues.The exchange's trading volume had dropped by nearly 70 per cent during the second quarter at the time.A similar situation occurred earlier this month when the exchange discontinued the zero-trading-fee incentives for its TrueUSD (TUSD) and BTC trading pairs, causing traders to migrate to other platforms.While the removal of free trading incentives contributed to Binance's declining volume, the exchange has also faced increased regulatory issues in various jurisdictions, including the US and Europe, which has harmed its overall market share.US regulators sued Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao in June this year for allegedly operating a \"web of deception\" and filed 13 charges in a federal court.Binance was also ordered by Belgium's Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA) to immediately cease all offers of virtual currency services in the country.Several crypto companies have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in recent months like Genesis Global Trading (a subsidiary of the crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group (DCG), FTX, BlockFi, Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network and Voyager."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Takeaways\n\nGlobal interest rates are finally reaching their peak, presenting a more favorable backdrop for cryptoassets in Q4 and beyond.\n\nMarket internals show the market is poised for a new bullish cycle if a catalyst emerges.\n\nBitcoin remains relatively strong vs. Ethereum, but both are generally consolidating within their mid-year ranges.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum Fundamental Analysis\n\n\u201cThe opposite of love isn\u2019t hate; it\u2019s indifference.\u201d \u2013 Elie Wiesel\n\nDespite a dramatically fluctuatuating macroeconomic outlook, the highest interest rates seen in decades, and a complicated regulatory backdrop, Bitcoin and Ethereum have spent the last 6+ months consolidating within a few thousand points on either side of the $28K level. More to the point, all speculative interest in the entire cryptoasset space has been gobbled up by the latest investment theme du jour, Artificial Intelligence.\n\nIn other words, traders have gone from loving Bitcoin and Ethereum two years ago, to hating them at this time last year, to being completely indifferent to them today.\n\nUnder the surface though, there are signs that the cryptoasset space may be ever so gradually entering a new bullish cycle. From a monetary policy perspective, global central banks appear to be approaching their peak interest rates, barring a surprise resurgence of inflation, with fewer and fewer central banks raising interest rates each month:\n\nSource: Alphacast\n\nEven if the Fed or Bank of England is able to squeeze in another rate hike this quarter, it would likely be a \u201cone and done\u201d scenario before a longer period of either holding interest rates steady or outright cutting them if economic growth stumbles.\n\nKeying in on crypto market internals, the proportion of Bitcoin\u2019s supply that is held by long-term holders (>155 days) is approaching record highs above 75%. In contrast to short-term traders who try to capture quick moves, these investors tend to be \u201ctrue believers\u201d who rarely ever sell their coins, suggesting that the true supply of Bitcoin available to buy and sell may be lower than it has been in nearly a decade:\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nLike a pile of dry kindling, this situation sets the stage for a potential \u201csupply shock\u201d if there is a catalyst that leads to an increase in Bitcoin demand. Meanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cdominance,\u201d or Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization relative to the total market cap of all cryptoassets, continues to trend higher above 50%. Traders will be watching for this ratio to roll over to signal increasing speculative appetite in the crypto market and the next bull market to start in earnest:\n\nSource: TradingView, StoneX\n\nBitcoin Technical Analysis \u2013 BTC/USD Daily Chart\n\nSource: TradingView, StoneX\n\nTurning our attention to Bitcoin itself, prices remain within the broad $25K-32K range as we go to press. Looking ahead, the first zone of support to watch will be from $25,000-25,500, which has put a floor under prices multiple times already this year; a break below this zone exposes the Fibonacci retracements at $23,700 and $21,700 next. To the topside, there\u2019s little in the way of resistance until the top of the 6-month range in the $31,000-32,000 area, and on the off chance that resistance zone is overcome this year, the next level to watch will be closer to $36,000, the 38.2% retracement of the 2021-2022 drop.\n\nEthereum Technical Analysis \u2013 ETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nSource: TradingView, StoneX\n\nLooking at Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptoasset has trailed Bitcoin of late. Ether is arguably in a bearish channel since peaking for the year in early April, with prices failing to exceed $2,000 since then (though bulls are putting up a fight to defend support in the $1,500-1,550 area as of writing at the end of September. Looking ahead, a break below $1,500 support would leave little in the way of nearby support until the Q4 2022 lows around $1,150. In terms of levels to watch on the topside, a recovery back to $2,000 would certainly satisfy many bulls after starting the year below $1,200, and a move much beyond that may be too much to ask in the current environment.\n\n-- Written by Matt Weller, Global Head of Research\n\nFollow Matt on Twitter: @MWellerFX"
