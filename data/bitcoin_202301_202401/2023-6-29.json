        "title": "Bitcoin briefly falls after SEC reportedly calls ETF filings inadequate, but posts a winning month - CNBC",
        "content": "The price of bitcoin fell Friday following a report that recent bitcoin filings from big names such as BlackRock and Fidelity have been deemed inadequate in the eyes of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nBitcoin finished the day below the flat line at $30,398.43, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier, it briefly fell under the $30,000 level, after rising as high as $31,260.52.\n\nBitcoin ended the week down 1.5%. Nevertheless, it finished the month up 12.3%, following a down month in May, which was the cryptocurrency's first losing month of the year and worst month since November 2022. June's positive performance brought its year-to-date gains to 83%.\n\nThe move came after The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that the SEC told Nasdaq and Cboe Global Markets, both of which filed bitcoin exchange-traded funds applications on behalf of various institutions this month, that the filings aren't sufficiently clear or comprehensive.\n\nSpecifically, the SEC said it returned the filings because they didn't name the spot bitcoin exchange that the Nasdaq and Cboe would have a \"surveillance-sharing agreement\" with or provide enough detail about the arrangement, according to the report.\n\nThe filings can be resubmitted. A Cboe spokesperson told CNBC that the exchange plans to update and refile."

        "content": "The price of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization slumped on Friday morning from above $31,000 to briefly below $30,000, dropping approximately 3% in a matter of minutes.\n\nThe sudden dip in Bitcoin follows a report from the Wall Street Journal that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission told securities exchanges Nasdaq and Cboe their applications for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund, which they submitted on behalf of asset managers like BlackRock, were \u201cinadequate.\u201d\n\nNasdaq and Cboe weren\u2019t specific enough in their filings, the U.S. regulatory agency said, pointing out that their ETF applications did not outline the nature of surveillance-sharing agreements\u2014key provisions to allay the SEC\u2019s concern over market manipulation\u2014that BlackRock, Fidelity, and other asset managers had touted. It also said the exchanges did not name the Bitcoin spot exchanges the asset managers planned to partner with in these agreements.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s reported comments may just be a temporary setback, however, as Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed to a section of the Journal\u2019s report in which the agency said the exchanges can update their applications and refile. Balchunas added the report is \u201carguably good news.\u201d\n\nThe drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price follows a weeks-long rally that saw the cryptocurrency reach its highest price in more than a year amid a flurry of ETF applications from big institutions.\n\nIn mid-June, BlackRock, the U.S.\u2019s largest asset manager, filed an application for a Bitcoin spot ETF. As of yet, no asset manager has successfully received the SEC\u2019s approval for such an ETF, which would expose Bitcoin to trillions in dollars from brokerage accounts and pension funds. (The SEC has approved, however, a Bitcoin futures ETF.)\n\nThe crypto market rallied on news of BlackRock\u2019s filing, optimistic that a firm of its stature would be the first to successfully pass the federal agency\u2019s muster and prove that, through a surveillance-sharing agreement with Nasdaq, it can weed out market manipulation, a reason the SEC has repeatedly cited in its denials of Bitcoin spot ETF applications.\n\nOther large asset managers, including WisdomTree, Invesco, Bitwise, ARK Invest, and Fidelity, followed BlackRock\u2019s lead, and either resubmitted or updated existing ETF applications with their own surveillance-sharing agreements.\n\nBitcoin responded accordingly and has consistently traded above $30,000 in the latter half of June, an almost 100% increase in price since January."

Investors too, have taken the cue, driving bitcoin prices to fresh highs.\n\nThere have been dozens of attempts to launch a spot-bitcoin product in the past, but many have faced opposition from regulators citing market concerns and investor protection.\n\nOne of the reasons commentators have been bullish on the prospect of BlackRock's bitcoin spot ETF approval is that it includes a surveillance sharing agreement with an unnamed bitcoin exchange based in the U.S., and this sort of arrangement is also mentioned in Cboe's recent filing.\n\n\n\nOther issuers, which include Valkyrie, Bitwise, VanEck, and ARK Investment Management, remain hopeful of securing regulatory approval this time around. Notably, this isn't the only area of crypto where traditional financial powerhouses are getting involved, as a new crypto asset exchange backed by Charles Schwab (SCHW), Fidelity, and others also recently launched.\n\nThis new interest from traditional financial institutions has clearly breathed new life into the crypto market after the industry had been shaken by SEC lawsuits against crypto exchange giants Binance and Coinbase (COIN)."

        "content": "What Is a Bitcoin Mixer?\n\nBy Lipsa Das\n\nRead 6 min Medium\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS: \u2014 Bitcoin mixers are software or third-party services that mix up your Bitcoin funds with other users\u2019 funds to reduce the tracing of transactions.\n\n\n\n\u2014 There are two types of mixers: centralized mixers and decentralized mixers. Centralized mixers use a third party, while decentralized mixers use open-source protocols to mix transactions.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Crypto mixers offer users anonymity which can be integral to those living under oppressive regimes, but it can also open the door for criminal activity.\n\n\n\n\u2014 There are many potential risks of using mixers, such as violating local laws, receiving wallet flags, platform bans and more.\n\nFirst introduced in 2009, Bitcoin allows users to transact and trust each other across borders without needing banks 24/7. If that seems unfamiliar to you, make sure to read the guide on what Bitcoin is. However, for the purposes of this article, it\u2019s important to understand that these benefits come with a trade-off.\n\nOne of the core concepts of what blockchain is offering \u2014 transparency \u2014 is not exactly privacy-friendly. To explain, the blockchain is freely available to everyone, and you can read every transaction on sites like block explorers. With this information and additional external data, you can link an arbitrary Bitcoin address to its owner. So, what do you do when you\u2019d prefer not to share this information?\n\nMost people will never need to hide their blockchain transactions. However, for those living under oppressive regimes and require the freedom of moving their assets where they like, tools to protect users\u2019 identities become imperative. But unfortunately, the very same tools that help such people survive also encourage bad actors.\n\nSpecifically, these tools are named crypto tumblers, or mixers and let you make anonymous transactions on the blockchain.\n\nBut what is a Bitcoin mixer exactly; how do they work, and are they even legal?\n\nLet\u2019s dive in.\n\nWhat Is a Bitcoin Mixer?\n\nBitcoin mixers, also known as tumblers, are services that receive cryptocurrencies from users, pool them together, and then send the amounts to their corresponding recipient addresses. This is an effort to obfuscate the transaction trail.\n\nTo explain, if you\u2019re using a mixer, the mixer\u2019s address becomes the recipient of any outgoing transactions from your wallet instead of a specific Bitcoin address. Similarly, in the case of a recipient\u2019s address, the address is again that of the Bitcoin mixer. If you want to see this in action, here\u2019s how to read blockchain transactions.\n\nMixing funds hides the original sources, making it difficult for external observers to identify the specific senders or recipients.\n\nDepending on the mixer, service fees are generally quite low, ranging from 0.5% to 7% of the transaction.\n\nWhat Is a Bitcoin Mixer For?\n\nBitcoin mixers make crypto transactions harder to trace, thus preserving privacy and hiding the sender\u2019s identity. Essentially, they serve as a way to anonymize crypto transactions.\n\nSo why would you want to use a crypto mixer?\n\nFirstly, many people using mixers live in countries with oppressive regimes. Not every country gives its citizens the same rights, meaning outspoken journalists, members of opposition parties, or even normal civilians may be in danger for expressing opposing views or beliefs. If citizens of such countries use a transparent transaction on the blockchain, they could be putting themselves at risk.\n\nSecondly, whistleblowers and investigative journalists can also benefit from this tool. Using a crypto mixer means they can pay and get paid for information across borders, but without revealing their sources.\n\nOf course, \u2018anonymity\u2019 also encourages bad actors to exist. Scammers often want to hide their identities, and crypto mixers are their tools of choice.\n\nFor instance, Bitcoin tumblers have a long history of money laundering and scams, with the first notable case in December 2013. Just four years after Bitcoin\u2019s launch, the mixer Bitcoin Fog was used to launder 96000 BTC from a marketplace. These incidents continued well into 2021, with Bitcoin Fog allegedly funneling over $1.3 million BTC. US authorities finally arrested the founder of this tumbler, Roman Sterlingov, in 2021.\n\nSince then, US authorities have sanctioned many high-profile mixers, namely Blender.io and Tornado Cash. Similarly, German authorities also took down the infamous Chipmixer, and seized over $46 million in cryptocurrency.\n\nHow Do Crypto Mixers Work?\n\nCrypto mixers collect Bitcoin from their users, merge their transactions, and redistribute it.\n\nTo better understand this concept, let us take the example of a charity receiving donations anonymously. Instead of directly donating, multiple donors could pool their funds together and designate a third party to complete the actual transaction. As a result, the charity receives the donation without knowing the specific source.\n\nReplace this third party with a smart contract, and that\u2019s essentially the foundation of a Bitcoin mixer. Usually, mixers also incorporate a slight delay in sending the Bitcoin to the destination address to avoid further detection.\n\nBitcoin mixers are of two types: centralized mixers and decentralized mixers.\n\nCentralized Mixers vs. Decentralized Mixers\n\nCentralized mixers are operated by private third-party services that users trust to mix their Bitcoin, while decentralized mixers are peer-to-peer protocols with an automatic mixing process.\n\nUsing centralized mixers, users send their funds to wallet addresses owned by these mixers, pay a service fee and mention where they want to send it. Once the mixer receives these funds, they combine them with other users\u2019 funds in a pool and redistribute them. Good examples of centralized mixers include Yo!Mix and Mixtura.\n\nCentralized mixers, particularly, carry the additional risk of trusting a third party. You could potentially lose your funds if the network or the company shuts down. Since these mixers handle a large amount of money, they become attractive targets for hackers and pose risks of potential malicious intent from the company itself. Some centralized mixers might also save your info privately and tie you back to these transactions\u2014and that defeats their whole purpose.\n\nOn the other hand, decentralized mixers use an open-source protocol, such as CoinJoin, to create an automatic permissionless mixing process. Essentially, they bank on multiple users using the protocol. Then, they consolidate their funds to a single large transaction, and route different Bitcoins to the destination addresses. The more people that use a decentralized mixer, the more efficient they become. That\u2019s because an increased number of users reduces the odds of detection. A good example of a decentralized crypto mixer that uses CoinJoin includes JoinMarket.\n\nThe Wider Risks of Crypto Mixers\n\nWhile crypto mixers offer a degree of anonymity, it\u2019s important to note that it\u2019s not impossible to find out who sends and receives funds in this manner. Unfortunately, some crypto mixers aren\u2019t as anonymous as they claim, and some are subject to local laws and regulations.\n\nFor example, Law enforcement agencies (such as the FBI) have sophisticated tools to trace the origin of funds sent through crypto mixers. This is easier to discover on mixers with limited users, or when tracking large sums of value.\n\nIn the case of fewer people participating in the service, tracing funds is simple. Since it\u2019s less likely another user sent a similar amount of Bitcoin as yours, working out the source is entirely plausible. This can be particularly useful when trying to catch bad actors, but it also leaves people living under oppressive regimes vulnerable.\n\nFurther, some exchanges actively block these \u201cmixed\u201d tokens and coins due to security and compliance concerns. Thus, if using a crypto mixer, you might face similar issues across major exchanges, limiting how you can use crypto assets. So, while there are countless legitimate reasons to obfuscate your transactions, it\u2019s often simply not that easy.\n\nBitcoin Mixers: Are They Illegal?\n\nWhile Bitcoin mixers are not illegal everywhere, many countries do limit their use, or even ban them entirely. Plus, since these mixing services can lend themselves to money laundering, they often attract increased scrutiny from regulators. Regulatory authorities often view mixers with suspicion, as they can hinder law enforcement efforts to track and trace suspicious transactions.\n\nTo combat this, countries like the US have placed restrictions on crypto mixers since they deal with money transfers. The US financial law enforcement agency, FinCEN, requires all mixers to register under the Bank Secrecy Act.\n\nFurther, in 2022, the US placed sanctions on major crypto mixers like Tornado Cash and Blender.io. The US Treasury held that Tornado Cash had been used for laundering over 7 billion dollars since its creation. Similarly, Blender.io helped a North Korean hacker group launder money.\n\nThese sanctions prohibit U.S. persons from doing business with both these services and freeze any assets they may have in the United States.\n\nSince many countries handle crypto mixers differently, consult your local crypto laws before using them.\n\nCan I Use a Crypto Mixer?\n\nSo, crypto mixers offer a novel way to benefit from the security and accessibility of the blockchain, without the burden of revealing your identity. For those under oppressive regimes or with political difficulties, this may be the only option. However, if you decide to use a crypto or Bitcoin mixer, it\u2019s important to understand the risk involved. Before using any service that may obfuscate the origin of a specific set of funds, make sure you check your local laws and abide by them. You don\u2019t want to use a crypto mixer and pay the price for it later.\n\nIf you want to keep your anonymity in crypto though, using a crypto mixer can be an interesting option. Only you know if using a crypto mixer is right for you. Now you know about how they work, you can navigate the market and decide whether that\u2019s the right choice\u2014because that\u2019s the whole point of self-custody."

Since then, WisdomTree, VanEck and Invesco have taken the initial steps toward their own funds. Cathie Wood's Ark Invest filed for changes to its proposed bitcoin fund Wednesday that brought it closer in line with BlackRock's application.\n\nThursday's filing is a proposed rule from the Cboe BZX Exchange to list the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, the name of Fidelity's previously proposed bitcoin ETF that was denied by the SEC. The exchange has made similar filings for other firms over the past two weeks.\n\nThe SEC has so far rejected every spot bitcoin fund application on which it has made a decision. The commission is in a legal battle with Grayscale about its decision to block the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. A decision in that case is expected later this year.\n\nOne of the SEC's key concerns about a spot bitcoin product is transparency in the market and the potential for manipulation. The BlackRock filing includes a proposed surveillance-sharing agreement that could alleviate those concerns. The subsequent filings have similar proposals.\n\nThe SEC has already allowed the creation of ETFs that track bitcoin futures contracts, including the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) that has more than $1 billion in assets. The first leveraged bitcoin futures fund hit the market Tuesday.\n\nThe new rush for ETFs appears to have buoyed prices for bitcoin. The digital currency was trading near $30,500 Thursday afternoon, up from below $26,000 prior to the BlackRock filing."

        "title": "Rural Arkansas 'crypto mines' prompt noise complaints from residents - KUAR",
        "content": "Last month, Gladys Anderson, who lives in the Bono community in Greenbrier, started hearing a loud, unbearable sound.\n\nA constant high-pitched hum, ranging from 60 to 70 decibels, is coming from a cryptocurrency mine built less than a half-mile away from her house.\n\n\u201cYou can hear it, especially at night,\u201d she said, gesturing at the corner of her house where the bedrooms are located.\n\nCrypto mines are large collections of computers built to harvest cryptocurrency, a completely digital form of money not reliant on any central authority. The computers in Greenbrier are surrounded by a tall, opaque orange fence and signs that say \u201cno trespassing.\u201d\n\nThe mines are loud because of the fans needed to keep their hardware cool. In Greenbrier they generally run 24/7, staying on even at night.\n\nAnderson says she hears the ringing fan noise in every part of her large house, from the outdoor pool to the garage, to the guest house where her mother lives. When she isn't home, she says the sound is still \"burned into her brain.\"\n\nCarol Goforth is a professor of law at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, and has been studying the rise of cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cThere's no coin behind Bitcoin,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s bits of data. There is nothing tangible, nothing physical. It's just alphanumeric sequences stored on computers.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to owning Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, Goforth says its value only comes from a belief in its worth by people who own it.\n\n\u201cIf I stop being willing to pay for it, it has no value.\u201d\n\nIn some sense that's true of any form of currency. Dollars and cents only have value because society has agreed to give money value. Crypto is entirely electronic, as are most transactions done with actual currency. But with dollars, you can buy almost everything. Goforth says with Bitcoin, you can buy very little and it can be difficult to exchange it for actual currency.\n\nA new state law, Act 851, opened the door for more crypto mines to be built in Arkansas. Rep. Rick McClure, R-Malvern, presented the bill in committee on April 3 and it was signed into law about a week later.\n\n\u201cAs long as a data center is operating within the zoning laws, they shouldn't be singled out if they are in compliance with the ordinances that are already there,\u201d McClure said in a legislative committee meeting.\n\nThe law prevents any kind of zoning or sound ordinance laws designed to \u201cdiscriminate\u201d against crypto mines and data centers. No one spoke for or against the bill, and only two lawmakers voted against it.\n\nA company called Green Digital LLC is drafting plans to build a crypto mine in the small town of Vilonia. According to a city councilman, the site would mimic the one in Greenbrier. Company representatives did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAccording to an administrator in Faulkner County, the mines in Greenbrier are owned by an LLC called New Rays. When asked for comment on this story, CEO Ethan Wang said journalists are \u201cfake news\u201d and voiced his disappointment in the coverage he has seen so far.\n\nAt a Vilonia city council meeting last week, an ordinance was passed to cap noise in the town at 60 decibels, about the sound of a conversation.\n\nMellissa Blackwell, who lives just outside the Vilonia city limits, voiced her concern about the potential health effects on humans and wildlife in the area.\n\n\u201cWhen living things are exposed to noise, it changes us,\u201d she said.\n\nCity Councilman Steven Craig said he was indifferent about the mine.\n\n\u201cI am open for any type of business coming to town, as long as you abide by zoning regulations. And that's where I see it might become an issue,\u201d he said.\n\nA big argument for the mines is that they create jobs. Craig said the mine will create at most five new positions, which will probably be outsourced from Little Rock.\n\n\u201cI am all for entrepreneurship and starting a business. If it creates one job, great. If it creates 100 jobs, even better,\" he said. \"Do I think those jobs are going to be coming from citizens within Vilonia? Probably not.\u201d\n\nIn addition to noise complaints, law professor Carol Goforth says crypto mines use too much energy and are bad for the environment.\n\n\u201cBitcoin mines consume on an annual basis about the total energy consumption Ukraine had before the war.\u201d\n\nBack in Greenbrier, Gladys Anderson says her family is struggling. Her son has autism and is nonverbal. She says he struggles to cope with the noise, but that it would be too much of an ordeal to move.\n\n\u201cEven if I had the funds to do that, my kids have buried pets here. We have planted baby trees,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd why should I have to move? I was here first, and I'm not disturbing anybody in the community.\u201d\n\nRepublican state Sen. Bryan King told Fayetteville station KUAF he\u2019s considering drafting legislation to stop crypto mining in Arkansas. The north Arkansas city of Harrison has already put its plans for a crypto mine on hold.\n\nIn Vilonia, members of the city\u2019s planning committee will meet Thursday to talk about the next steps of whether to approve plans for a new crypto mine."

        "content": "Though the Securities and Exchange Commission has reportedly rejected filings for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund from BlackRock, Fidelity and a handful of other asset managers, crypto-enthusiasts are optimistic that the product will soon achieve approval.\n\nThe regulator informed exchanges that the filings weren\u2019t sufficiently clear or comprehensive, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday, citing unnamed sources. While there are already ETFs on the market tracking bitcoin futures or companies that work in the cryptocurrency space, the SEC has rejected around 30 applications for an ETF that tracks the actual price of bitcoin since 2017.\n\nCrypto-enthusiasts believe these products will increase participation in bitcoin investing by allowing investors and financial advisors to buy and sell using traditional brokerage accounts. Many hoped the backing of BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager and provider of ETFs, represented the best chance yet for a product to reach approval.\n\nThe fact that the SEC rejected the applications in just two weeks, rather than use more of the 45-day window it has to make a decision, is actually a good sign that the agency is ready to approve the product, said Steve Sanduski, a certified financial planner who coaches and trains advisors.\n\nPast products were rejected for worries about fraud and market manipulation, while this latest round was rejected for not providing enough information about the plans for \u201csurveillance-sharing agreements\u201d with a bitcoin exchange, according to the WSJ.\n\n\u201cBy telling the exchanges exactly what was missing in their filings, the applicants will simply answer those questions and resubmit their application,\u201d Sanduski said in an email. \u201cThis practically screams, \u2018We\u2019re ready to approve.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe SEC has cracked down on cryptocurrency players recently, including a lawsuit against Coinbase filed on June 8. By hammering rule-breakers in the space, the SEC is clearing the way for firms who operate within the law, Sanduski said.\n\n\u201cOnce the SEC gets comfortable that most market manipulation can be rooted out, and any remaining manipulation can be tracked and prosecuted, I think we\u2019ll see the ETFs get approved,\u201d he said.\n\nThe price of bitcoin has surged 20% since BlackRock announced its application. Shares of Coinbase, which is listed as the custodian for BlackRock\u2019s holdings, have climbed 30%.\n\nIn addition to Fidelity, Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Investment Management, Invesco, WisdomTree, Bitwise Asset Management and Valkyrie have refiled or amended their own applications for a spot bitcoin ETF, according to the WSJ.\n\nIt remains to be seen how much a product will encourage more financial advisors to recommend the asset to clients. Some view the risk of allocating to bitcoin as outweighing the reward \u2014 in terms of market volatility and client backlash \u2014 while there are also traditionalists who will never change their mind about cryptocurrencies, Sanduski said.\n\n\u201cOver time, as bitcoin continues to prove its resilience, I expect most advisors will get comfortable with it and it will become a rather common allocation,\u201d he said."

At this moment, with heat waves covering the southwest and wildfire smoke filling skies across the country, the need for urgent climate action is clear. Given Bitcoin\u2019s destructive climate record, BlackRock and its peers should engage in efforts to clean up the cryptocurrency. Instead, BlackRock is looking the other direction and actively promoting Bitcoin as a mainstream investment. This is accelerating the clock on the Bitcoin carbon time bomb by driving up its exchange value.\u201d\n\nGreenpeace USA\u2019s forthcoming analysis of major banks and asset managers reveals BlackRock as one of Bitcoin\u2019s biggest backers in the financial services industry. The asset manager is a leading investor in the Bitcoin mining industry and promotes Bitcoin adoption through its investment products and services. The energy-intensive nature of Bitcoin mining, coupled with BlackRock\u2019s investments in the sector, raises serious concerns about the company\u2019s contributions to environmental degradation, carbon emissions, and community impacts. Greenpeace USA continues to call on BlackRock to take meaningful action, including a meeting to address Bitcoin\u2019s climate impacts.\n\n###\n\nContact: Gigi Singh, Senior Communications Specialist at Greenpeace USA (+1) 631-404-9977, [email protected]\n\nGreenpeace USA is part of a global network of independent campaigning organizations that use peaceful protest and creative communication to expose global environmental problems and promote solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful future.

        "content": "This year has been a litmus test for the crypto market as it determines whether it can bounce back from a dismal 2022.\n\nIn June, bitcoin's price hit its highest point of the year thus far, topping out at around $31,200 per coin. But on Friday, bitcoin's price dipped below $30,000 once again before recovering some of the losses.\n\nMuch of the volatility is being attributed by market watchers to news that more traditional financial firms are looking for ways to be involved in the crypto market. Investment companies BlackRock and Fidelity both filed for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) this month, coinciding with the start of a bitcoin rally that brought the coin\u2019s price up by over $6,000 per coin.\n\nBut on Friday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) says those filings may not be adequate. Here's what investors need to know.\n\nWhat is a spot bitcoin ETF?\n\nBitcoin futures ETFs are already on the market, so you may be wondering what the difference is between a bitcoin futures ETF and a spot bitcoin ETF. Most simply, the difference is that a spot bitcoin ETF would directly follow the price of bitcoin, while bitcoin futures ETFs track the price of bitcoin futures contracts.\n\nAs Omid Malekan, adjunct professor at Columbia Business School explains, futures ETFs operate less efficiently than spot ETFs because they expire, and companies must roll their positions from contract to contract. This creates price friction and added costs that can be avoided by spot ETFs.\n\nMalekan says a spot ETF is likely what many bitcoin investors are really craving. Plenty of companies have tried to receive approval for spot bitcoin ETFs from the SEC. Asset manager Grayscale filed for one last year and, upon rejection, began a still-ongoing lawsuit against the agency for its ambiguity regarding the demands of a crypto spot fund.\n\nWhy has bitcoin's price been rallying?\n\nBlackRock's status makes its filing seem different from those previous in investors' eyes, Malekan says.\n\n\"It's the biggest asset manager, and it has a successful track record in getting ETFs approved,\" he says. \"There's a general perception that a company like BlackRock would not be doing this if they didn't think the regulatory environment in the U.S. was going to improve going forward.\"\n\nThere's also the fact that the crypto industry dealt with a lot of uncertainty in the industry last year, stemming from events like the implosion of the major crypto exchange FTX or the collapse of TerraUSD, a \"stablecoin.\"\n\nMalekan says that uncertainty could be cooling down, which is helping bitcoin's price.\n\n\"People have been expecting the worst about a lot of things including the regulatory crackdown, which is happening,\" Malekan says, referencing a recent lawsuit against Coinbase by the SEC as an example. \"Coinbase stock actually is now significantly higher than when the SEC revealed its lawsuit, and I think it's a case of the actual news being less bad than what was anticipated.\"\n\nWhy did bitcoin's price dip Friday?\n\nInvestors who were confident in the near-term potential of a bitcoin spot ETF should probably hold their confidence, though. Just two weeks after BlackRock's filing, a Friday report by the Wall Street Journal said that the SEC has already decided that recent ETF filings \u2014 including BlackRock, Fidelity and others \u2014 remain inadequate for approval. Specifically, the Journal reports that the agency says that filings are not clear nor comprehensive enough \u2014 a complaint it has made in many of its rejections of spot bitcoin ETFs over the years.\n\nOn Friday morning, bitcoin prices dropped by more than $1,200 following the report before recovering some of the losses.\n\nMore from Money:\n\nBitcoin Is Less Than a Year Away From a Much-Hyped Event That Has Historically Seen Its Price Soar\n\nInvestors Are Building up Their Cash Reserves \u2014 Millennials Especially\n\nHere\u2019s Where Investors Plan to Put More Money in the Early Days of the Bull Market"

Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized design has many advantages, but things can get tricky when there are disagreements with the community about the best way forward.\n\nSuch disagreements have led to more than 100 Bitcoin forks.\n\nNot all of those forks have led to new networks, but of those that have, Bitcoin Cash is probably the best known.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Cash?\n\nBitcoin Cash is a modified version of Bitcoin that runs on its own blockchain network. It works in almost the same way as Bitcoin, but there are several key differences.\n\nThe largest difference is block size, or how much transaction information a single block on each chain can handle.\n\nOn the Bitcoin network, each block is 1 MB in size. Immediately after the Bitcoin Cash fork, the Bitcoin Cash block size was 8 MB, eight times bigger than on the Bitcoin network. In May 2018, Bitcoin increased its block size again, this time to 32 MB.\n\nThis means that Bitcoin Cash can now process 32 times as much information per block as Bitcoin can. As a result, Bitcoin Cash transactions tend to be faster and have lower fees. Security may be lower on the Bitcoin Cash network, though, as less mining power goes into mining each Bitcoin Cash block.\n\nDid you know? Bitcoin Cash is sometimes abbreviated to Bcash.\n\nWho invented it?\n\nThe idea for Bitcoin Cash was put forward by a group of Bitcoin developers. However, the person most directly connected to the currency today is Roger Ver, an early Bitcoin adopter and investor.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA brief history\n\nJune 2017 - A group of developers and miners on Bitcoin put forward a proposal called Bitcoin ABC, which wanted to increase the block size.\n\n- A group of developers and miners on Bitcoin put forward a proposal called Bitcoin ABC, which wanted to increase the block size.

The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been trading above US$30,000 since June 23. Ether rose 0.55% over the week to US$1,890.\n\ndOuePXPwA z4ORRoAMae66YAl51jC5\n\nThe growth of institutional interest in cryptocurrencies continued. After weeks of rumors and reports, asset management giant Fidelity submitted its spot Bitcoin ETF application, following the likes of BlackRock, Valkyrie Investments and WisdomTree.\n\nBitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, briefly rose to US$31,173 in the 24 hours following Fidelity\u2019s application.\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s recent positive momentum can be attributed to the buzz around institutional players preparing to set up traditional financial instruments such as exchange-traded funds for cryptocurrencies,\u201d Jonas Betz, crypto market analyst and founder of consultancy firm Betz Crypto, told Forkast.\n\n\u201cThis could potentially lead to increased buying pressure as new investors, previously wary of cryptocurrencies due to a lack of knowledge about how to facilitate direct crypto exposure, can easily enter these vehicles to gain exposure to crypto.\u201d\n\nMax Breus, the co-founder and chief executive officer of Ubix Network, a protocol that connects blockchains with different consensus mechanisms, said that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accepting a spot Bitcoin ETF application would bring significant upside for Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cEach new request to the SEC increases the chances of getting a positive decision\u2026 This will allow crypto to integrate deeper into global financial markets,\u201d said Breus in a statement shared with Forkast.\n\nBinance\u2019s troubles extended in Europe this week as the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange announced on Wednesday that it will be changing its euro banking partner from Sept. 25, after Paysafe Payment Solutions said it will stop offering euro payment support for the exchange. This came two weeks after reports surfaced of Binance France being investigated for money laundering and the illegal provision of digital asset services.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.2 trillion on Friday at 7:00 p.m. in Hong Kong, up 2.56% from US$ 1.17 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. With a market cap of US$597 billion, Bitcoin represented 50% of the market while Ether, valued at US$227 billion, accounted for 19%.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 50% dominance is its highest mark in over two years. Bitcoin last accounted for more than half of the crypto market on April 25, 2021, when it traded above US$53,000.\n\n\u201cMicroStrategy Inc. bought US$347 million of Bitcoin in the second quarter. Perhaps this explains the growing dominance of Bitcoin,\u201d said Breus.\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s hawkish remarks signaled two or more interest rate hikes towards the end of the year. Powell also warned that the U.S. banking turmoil may not be over, citing funding vulnerabilities.\n\nNotable Movers: BCH & COMP\n\nBitcoin Cash was this week\u2019s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins. Bitcoin Cash rose 115.15% to US$306.75, starting its uptrend after June 20, when EDX Markets, a crypto exchange backed by Citadel, Fidelity and Charles Schwab, listed the coin.\n\nAlgorithmic yield generator Compound\u2019s governance token, COMP, was this week\u2019s second biggest gainer in the top 100. The token rose 89.44% to US$57.14, picking up significant momentum on Thursday, a day after Compound CEO Robert Leshner announced the founding of a new company focused on creating regulated financial products bridging traditional markets and blockchain.\n\nAccording to on-chain intelligence firm Lookonchain, a whale wallet withdrew US$5.53 million worth of Comp tokens from Binance on Thursday, contributing to the token\u2019s price surge.\n\nSee related article: Why the US is waging war on Binance, Coinbase\n\nNext week: Can Bitcoin remain above US$30,500?\n\nNext week, investors will be looking for the release of the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s (FOMC) meeting, for hints on the Fed\u2019s future monetary policy. The minutes of the meeting are set to release on Wednesday, shortly before a speech from FOMC Member John Williams, followed by a speech from Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas CEO Lorie K. Logan on Thursday.\n\nThe U.S. non-farm payroll report for June is scheduled for next Friday. The report is used by investors to gauge the health of the labor market and offer indications on the Fed\u2019s upcoming interest rate decisions.\n\nMeanwhile, investors will be eagerly watching the SEC\u2019s response to the mounting spot Bitcoin ETF applications. According to Lucas Kiely, the chief investment officer of digital asset platform Yield App, a positive response could breathe life into the crypto market and attract more institutional investors.\n\n\u201cIf Bitcoin manages to remain above US$30,500 for numerous closes and maintains that support level, there is a significantly increased likelihood of a bullish trend continuing. Conversely, if Bitcoin fails to remain above this level or experiences a significant drop below US$25,000, it could signal a bearish trend,\u201d said Kiely.\n\nSee related article: Crypto firms eye Hong Kong amid tough US regulations, says fintech association chair"

U.S. GDP grew faster than expected in the first quarter and initial jobless claims came in at less than expected. Also, asset manager Fidelity Investments on Thursday filed to offer a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nAll top 10 cryptos rise\n\nBitcoin climbed 1.05% to US$30,453 over the last 24 hours to 6:40 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is up 1.43% over the past seven days.\n\nEther rose 1.28% to US$1,853, but is down 1.4% for the week.\n\nAll top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded higher. Solana led the gains on a 12.35% jump and a 7.56% weekly gain. This despite the Thursday announcement from Cardinal, a Solana non-fungible token (NFT) protocol, that it will be winding down operations due to what it called a challenging macroeconomic environment.\n\nCardinal tweeted on Thursday that the team will disable new deposit instructions on July 19 and cease operations on features including staking and new NFT rentals.\n\nElsewhere, Fidelity has refiled an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF. The Thursday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shows that the COBE exchange has proposed to list and trade shares of the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust. The SEC rejected a Bitcoin ETF application from Fidelity in 2021.\n\nFidelity\u2019s move follows a wave of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF applications submitted by asset managers this month, including BlackRock, WisdomTree, Invesco and Bitwise, indicating institutions are confident in the profit potential of digital assets and demand.\n\n\u201cTo this point, the lack of a spot Bitcoin ETP exposes U.S. investor assets to significant risk because investors that would otherwise seek crypto asset exposure through a spot Bitcoin ETP are forced to find alternative exposure through generally riskier means,\u201d the Fidelity filing said.\n\nOn Wednesday, investment management fund ARK Invest also filed an amendment to its April application for a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap rose 1.24% to US$1.17 trillion, with trading volume dropping 12.22% to US$29.96 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nLong-term Azuki collectors sell out\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market.

That could potentially devalue the NFT collection as a whole, he said.\n\n\u201cTonight [on Thursday] the founder of Azuki, Zagabond, is meeting with the community to discuss the week\u2019s mint, and likely address concerns,\u201d Petscher said.\n\nAccording to data analytics firm Nansen on Twitter on Thursday: \u201cAzuki and Beanz collectors that have held for over 1 year have been selling their NFTs post-Elementals mint.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, art auction house Sotheby\u2019s plans to launch a new generative art program, or work generated from algorithms. That will be in partnership with Art Blocks, which powers generative minting technology to brands and artists, according to a Wednesday statement shared with Forkast via email.\n\n\u201cThis will allow generative art long form collections to be minted right on Sotheby\u2019s own platform,\u201d Petscher said. \u201cGenerative art is really beginning to spread its wings following the sale of \u2018The Goose\u2019 \u2014 The Ringers #879 \u2014 for US$5.4 million (US$6.2 million with fees) on June 15.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s economy contracts for third month\n\nA steel factory oin Nantong, Jiangsu Province of China.

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures edged up 0.01%, S&P 500 futures climbed 0.08%, and Nasdaq Futures added 0.19%.\n\nU.S. economic growth expanded faster than estimated in the first quarter, according to official data released Thursday. In the first quarter, the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) rose by an annualized rate of 2%, up from the previously estimated 1.3%.\n\nThe amount of initial jobless claims in the U.S. dropped by 26,000 to 239,000 for the week ended June 24, the largest decrease since October 2021.\n\nThe robust economic showing in the U.S. wasn\u2019t repeated in China, where the country\u2019s manufacturing activity contracted in June for the third month, the National Bureau of Statistics said Friday. The official manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index came in at 49.0 for the month, compared to 48.8 in May. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.\n\nChinese Premier Li Qiang said on Tuesday that China was still on track to meet its 5% annual growth target.\n\nInvestors, however, still need to contend with more interest rate hikes this year in the world\u2019s biggest economy. U.S. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly said the Fed may raise rates at the next two meetings and repeated that message at a central bank gathering in Portugal this week.\n\nU.S. interest rates are now between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts an 86.8% chance for a 25-basis-point rate hike at the Fed\u2019s next meeting on July 26. It predicts a 13.2% chance the Fed will leave rates unchanged.\n\n(Updates to add equities section.)"

        "content": "Earlier this month, BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, with approximately $10 trillion under management, applied to launch an ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) that tracks Bitcoin. If the request is approved, it will allow institutional investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without actually purchasing it.\n\nOver the past six years, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has repeatedly denied such requests, even from large and well-known institutional players like Kathy Wood's technology-focused hedge fund firm Ark. Grayscale, a major player in the crypto market, even sued the SEC last October for refusing to approve a similar product. While it is still unclear whether BlackRock will receive the long-awaited approval, the mere possibility of institutional entities investing in the asset caused the price of bitcoin to increase by about 15% to a one-and-a-half-year high, surpassing $30,000. However, the current price is still about 53% lower than the currency's all-time high of over $65,000 in November 2021.\n\n1 View gallery Larry Fink, BlackRock CEO. ( Photo: AP )\n\nAccording to the application submitted to the SEC, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust fund will utilize the platform of the American trading exchange Coinbase and its Coinbase Custody services. If approved, the ETF is expected to be traded on the Nasdaq. BlackRock, whose founder and CEO Larry Fink once referred to bitcoin as an \"index for money laundering\" and claimed that the company's clients had no interest in the field, took a different approach in the summer of 2022. BlackRock established a connection with Coinbase to allow its private clients access to the crypto market, citing growing customer interest in the field in a letter to investors.\n\nBlackRock is an investment house that manages money for the general public worldwide. In Israel, operations are managed by Anath Levin, former deputy CEO of Bank Hapoalim and a senior executive at Clal Insurance and Migdal Insurance. BlackRock offers investors a wide variety of products, including many passive ones like ETFs. Additionally, it manages hedge funds, private equity funds, and debt funds.\n\nBlackRock has made its move at a time when the crypto market is trying to recover from months of distress. Last summer, several companies in the industry went bankrupt, leaving investors without access to their funds. Furthermore, BlackRock's ETF application comes after the SEC's recent enforcement actions against Binance and Coinbase for various securities law violations and, in some cases, defrauding investors.\n\nInterestingly, the man who once mocked bitcoin, Larry Fink, has now become the darling of the community, or at least significant parts of it. Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz, a long-time crypto investor, expressed that the launch of BlackRock's ETF \"will be the best thing that could happen to bitcoin.\"\n\nAn ETF on bitcoin would provide exposure to the currency without actual ownership. Instead of cumbersome purchases or using dubious platforms, investors would be able to buy shares that track the asset's price. For the past six years, the SEC has rejected requests to create such funds, except for those related to futures contracts. The SEC's rejections are based on various reasons, but a consistent and central concern is the potential for price manipulation on unsupervised platforms. The SEC has cited evidence of fake trading (wash trading) in the market and the ability of large players to manipulate bitcoin's price for personal gain. The lack of supervision and transparency in the crypto market makes it challenging for the SEC to monitor and detect fraud. Approving the requested ETF would raise concerns about investor protection.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlackRock addresses the SEC's concerns through a \"surveillance-sharing agreement\" between different exchanges, which is a first-of-its-kind effort in the crypto field. This, combined with BlackRock's positive track record of gaining SEC approval for similar products, leads some commentators to believe that BlackRock has a higher chance of success compared to previous applicants.\n\nBlackRock's move aligns with a trend of increasing institutional involvement in the crypto market. Last week, hedge fund Citadel, financial giant Fidelity, and investment bank Charles Schwab launched EDX Markets, a new crypto exchange targeting established players seeking distance from regulatory enforcement issues. Unlike traditional crypto exchanges, EDX does not offer custodial services, meaning it does not hold cryptographic assets itself. Instead, it serves as a platform where parties agree on prices and close transactions. Compared to existing exchanges, which have been associated with frauds and scams, EDX aims to reduce risk by trading only four cryptocurrencies that the SEC has not classified as securities."

Meanwhile, the price of the meme token Shiba Inu (SHIB 2.48%) traded 4.5% higher, while the price of Bitcoin Cash (BCH -1.17%) had jumped nearly 26%.\n\nSo what\n\nEver since the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF, cryptocurrencies have been rallying on the belief that more interest in the sector from mainstream financial giants will ultimately increase exposure.\n\nWhile other spot Bitcoin ETFs have been rejected by the SEC, BlackRock's filing seemed to change the game because it proposed a surveillance-sharing agreement with the Nasdaq, where it intends to list the ETF. This agreement would share information about trading activity and the identity of customers, which the SEC believes is necessary to prevent market manipulation.\n\nFollowing BlackRock, a swarm of other players have proposed Bitcoin ETFs with the SEC and the latest is Fidelity, which has also proposed to have a surveillance-sharing agreement. These ETFs would ultimately make it easier for investors to gain access to Bitcoin without having to buy the cryptocurrency itself.\n\nIn other news, Bitcoin Cash has been exploding higher all week, most recently on a ton of trading volume out of investors in South Korea. The excitement continues to be fueled by the news that Bitcoin Cash is one of four cryptocurrencies being listed by a new exchange called EDX Markets, which is backed by Fidelity, Charles Schwab, and Citadel.\n\nInterestingly, the exchange decided to list Bitcoin Cash because it believes regulators are likely to determine that the cryptocurrency is a commodity and not a security. Whether or not cryptocurrencies are commodities or securities is a big point of contention in the crypto ecosystem right now. Commodities would be regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, while securities would be overseen by what is presumed to be the much stricter SEC.\n\nIn more regulatory news today, a new bill that formally recognizes cryptocurrencies as a regulated financial instrument and investment was officially made a law today in the United Kingdom. Many believe that regulatory clarity is a necessity for crypto to be able to move forward.\n\nNow what\n\nNews regarding spot Bitcoin ETFs has been the biggest driver of cryptocurrencies in recent weeks, so it makes sense that the news regarding Fidelity continued to fuel the sector today.\n\nBut the fact that investors are pouring into Bitcoin Cash because they think the token is likely to be deemed a commodity instead of a security is interesting and could represent a newer trend in the industry.\n\nWith the SEC seemingly getting more aggressive in its attempts to bring more cryptocurrencies under its purview, investors may start to favor those that they view as commodities. While I still like Ethereum the best in this group of cryptocurrencies, this is certainly a trend that bears watching."

        "content": "Traditional financial firms finally believe that digital assets are here to stay. Or so one might conclude from the slew of announcements last week from some of the world\u2019s premiere financial players.\n\nAmong them is BlackRock \u2014 the world\u2019s largest asset manager with $9 trillion in assets under management (AUM) \u2014 filed for permission to build a \u201cspot market\u201d Bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) \u2014 something the United States Securities and Exchange Commission has resolutely resisted.\n\nOthers include Fidelity Investments, Charles Schwab and Citadel launching EDX, a new cryptocurrency exchange. In Germany, Deutsche Bank \u2014 boasting $1.4 trillion in balance sheet assets \u2014 applied for a license to custody crypto. There were others too.\n\nCollectively, these developments boosted crypto trading markets. Bitcoin (BTC) gained 20% in the week, surpassing the $30,000 mark for the first time since April. If allowed, a BlackRock Bitcoin ETF listing on the Nasdaq stock exchange would arguably make Bitcoin more accessible to a larger investing public.\n\nSome even anticipated a stampede to Bitcoin due to the BlackRock filing, as others followed with their own, including Invesco and WisdomTree. Fidelity Investments filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF on June 29.\n\n\u201cThe Great Accumulation has begun,\u201d declared Cameron Winklevoss on Twitter, while MicroStrategy\u2019s Michael Saylor added, \u201cThe window to front-run institutional demand for #Bitcoin is closing.\u201d\n\nThe Great Accumulation of bitcoin has begun. Anyone watching the flurry of ETF filings understands the window to purchase pre-IPO bitcoin before ETFs go live and open the floodgates is closing fast. If bitcoin was the most obvious and best investment of the previous decade, this\u2026 \u2014 Cameron Winklevoss (@cameron) June 21, 2023\n\nOthers professed little shock about these developments, however, even after a year of crypto-related scandals, bankruptcies, lawsuits and regulatory uncertainty in the United States. By this view, the institutions were just bowing to the inevitable.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised, since from a fundamental point of view, the movement of digital value is the next obvious evolution of the internet,\u201d Jim Kyung-Soo Liew, associate professor of finance at Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, told Cointelegraph. \u201cWhat is surprising is how the U.S. hasn\u2019t embraced it.\u201d\n\nLast week\u2019s events raise some questions: How enduring are Bitcoin\u2019s most recent price gains? There have been institutional investor sightings before. Will this time be different, or will Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies resume their sideways market activity?\n\nOn the other hand, a firm the size of BlackRock really could transform the BTC market, some believe.\n\nBitcoin has a fixed supply limit of 21 million BTC and its existing inventory is relatively illiquid. Sixty-eight percent of BTC in circulation hasn\u2019t moved at all in the past year, according to Glassnode. There isn\u2019t a lot of stock on the shelves for BlackRock and others to snap up, in other words. If demand exceeds supply, doesn\u2019t that inevitably mean price gains for BTC?\n\nMagazine: How smart people invest in dumb memecoins: 3-point plan for success\n\nAlso, where do retail investors fit in among the new institutional arrivals? Maybe ordinary crypto users are also needed to stabilize the price of Bitcoin.\n\nFinally, assuming the so-called Great Accumulation really is happening, how far can it go? The cryptoverse has a market capitalization of about $1 trillion today, roughly half of which is in Bitcoin. Could the crypto market cap reach a 10-fold increase of $10 trillion in five years?\n\nHas the \u201cgreat accumulation\u201d begun?\n\n\u201cAnyone watching the flurry of ETF filings understands the window to purchase pre-IPO bitcoin before ETFs go live and open the floodgates is closing fast,\u201d declared Winklevoss, adding: \u201cIf bitcoin was the most obvious and best investment of the previous decade, this [spot Bitcoin ETF] will likely be the most obvious and best trade of this decade.\u201d\n\nIs the co-founder of the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange right?\n\n\u201cClearly, there is significant investor demand for Bitcoin access through regulated investment funds from a broad spectrum of U.S. investors,\u201d Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks, told Cointelegraph, \u201cOtherwise, BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco and other major asset managers would not have filed S-1s for Bitcoin ETFs.\u201d\n\nThe entry of BlackRock and other investment managers into this new asset class isn\u2019t so unexpected, either. \u201cWe\u2019ve long known that BlackRock is enabling BTC investments for clients through their Aladdin platform and Bitcoin private fund,\u201d Doug Schwenk, CEO of Digital Asset Research, told Cointelegraph.\n\nThe recent negative news stories swirling around Binance and Coinbase \u201care not related to Bitcoin and may be seen as an opportune time for a better-known, more regulated brand to provide alternatives that end-buyers can trust. A BTC ETF is a natural step.\u201d\n\nWinklevoss, Saylor and others warn that retail investors had better buy Bitcoin now to get its ostensibly cheaper \u201cpre-IPO\u201d price before BTC\u2019s price skyrockets. Are they correct?\n\n\u201cThere is some truth to that given the finite supply of Bitcoin and increasingly low rate of supply growth,\u201d added Chung. \u201cHowever, plenty of investors bought in the $50k to $69k range and they are still underwater; on top of that, cash earns 5%+ at the moment. To me, trying to time the market, especially one as volatile as crypto, is a fool\u2019s errand.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the Winklevoss scenario \u201cdepends on how certain one is that institutions are truly coming and that the ETFs and other infrastructure plays by large institutions will play out,\u201d Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of business development for the Asia-Pacific region at Keyrock \u2014 a Europe-based digital asset market maker \u2014 told Cointelegraph.\n\n\u201cForward-looking investors will probably try to front-run that move and buy before any of this is truly released. I\u2019m personally a bit less certain about how soon this will happen, though,\u201d d\u2019Anethan added.\n\nAssuming BlackRock succeeds in its ETF quest and other institutional investors follow, would that stabilize the price of Bitcoin at a substantially higher level than the current $30,000? Or does long-term price stability also require broad retail participation?\n\n\u201cIt all depends how much AUM they can gather if they are approved,\u201d answered Chung. \u201cIf it\u2019s a substantial amount, then it stands to reason that it would lift the price substantially given the finite supply. Bitcoin and its price is agnostic as to who buys Bitcoin and through what means. Buying demand just has to outstrip selling demand and the price will appreciate.\u201d\n\nCarol Alexander, professor of finance at the University of Sussex Business School, told Cointelegraph that a slew of spot Bitcoin ETFs could actually make BTC less stable and more volatile. \u201cIf there\u2019s too many ETFs, all these market makers trying to hedge their positions could be selling at the same time or buying at the same time. It could increase volatility\u2026 I disagree with what Winklevoss said.\u201d\n\nAlexander has her own BTC price scenario, which assigns retail investors a key role. In March, when BTC was trading around $20,000, she predicted the coin would rise to $30,000 by June and move sideways through the summer. That has largely come to pass. \u201cSo the question is, what\u2019s going to be happening in September?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it will \u2014 but it could go up to around $50,000. That\u2019s because people come back after the summer, and there\u2019s more liquidity in the markets.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s also because retail investors are no longer scared after the long string of crypto drawdowns, scandals, bankruptcies and regulatory actions of the past year. The growing investment in the digital asset market by large financial institutions like Fidelity Investments and JPMorgan Chase has arguably had a calming effect on retail investors.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to be seeing much more acceptance from really ordinary people starting in September as you get some more regulatory clarity about things. That extra volume of trades could bring the price back up to \u2014 I\u2019m not saying $68,000 where it was, that would be too high [...] \u2014 but there\u2019s that sweet area around the $50,000 mark, which I think will be the next long-term resistance level.\u201d\n\nIn a June 19 global survey by Nomura Laser Digital, 90% of professional investors said it was \u201cimportant\u201d that any digital-asset funds or investments have the backing of a large traditional financial institution \u2014 at least before considering putting their clients\u2019 money into it. Maybe this past week\u2019s announcements by BlackRock, Fidelity, Deutsche Bank, et al. are the signal they were waiting for.\n\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Schwenk said. \u201cOnly time will tell. It\u2019s hard to pick when the tipping point will be. We have had participation from other large traditional firms \u2014 BNY Mellon, State Street, Standard Chartered, Franklin Templeton, etc. That hasn\u2019t been enough to satisfy the respondents in the survey yet, but eventually, they will see enough momentum.\u201d\n\nTen-fold growth over five years?\n\nIn the medium term, how high could things go? With the active participation of large TradFi firms like BlackRock, Fidelity and Deutsche Bank, could crypto market capitalization grow from $1 trillion to $10 trillion or more over the next five years, for instance?\n\n\u201cFive years ago, the entire market cap of liquid crypto, as measured by the CF Large Cap Index, was around $250 billion and hit a high of around $2.6 trillion in late 2021,\u201d said Chung. \u201cSo 10X would seem to be within the realms of possibility.\u201d\n\nMajor institutions putting their distribution networks to work to support further adoption would also provide \u201ca significant tailwind,\u201d he added. \u201cHowever, interest rates were not 5% in that previous five-year period \u2014 they are now. What impact that might have is impossible to know.\u201d\n\nRecent: Open source: Buzzword or real security for crypto wallets?\n\nAlexander was less bullish. \u201cA Bitcoin ETF \u2014 I don\u2019t even see that it\u2019s needed.\u201d Most ETFs are a basket of equities or a basket of currencies. An ETF with a basket of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether (ETH) and Solana (SOL) \u201cwould make a lot more sense,\u201d in her view.\n\n\u2018Exciting times\u2019 for Bitcoin?\n\nSightings of institutional investors just outside the boundaries of the cryptoverse have been reported before, but they have never quite entered en masse. Why might this time be different?\n\n\u201cInstitutional investors are very slow and thoughtful in their due diligence process,\u201d Johns Hopkins\u2019 Liew said, but \u201cthey have finally come to see the Bitcoin light. It\u2019s just too exciting to pass up and their customers are pushing them for products.\u201d From an empirical perspective, some crypto exposure is a good means of diversifying an investment portfolio, he noted, summarizing:\n\n\u201cIf institutional investors enter the party, their demand would certainly drive prices higher. It would definitely be exciting times for BTC.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe involvement of large financial institutions, whether it be for ETF applications or the new EDX exchanges, represent a significant shift and a decisive moment for crypto markets, in the U.S. and globally,\u201d concluded d\u2019Anethan."

        "content": "With more mainstream popularity than ever, many new people are interested in acquiring some Bitcoin. But many of the crypto-curious still view buying Bitcoin from a crypto exchange as an intimidating and opaque process. The technical aspects of holding Bitcoin\u2014such as crypto wallets, Bitcoin addresses and private keys\u2014are confusing to newcomers, and scare some investors away.\n\nAll of this has intensified the appeal of a Bitcoin ETF, or exchange-traded fund. Major financial institutions like Blackrock, Fidelity, and Invesco have applied with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch ETFs.\n\nWhat is an ETF?\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 An ETF is an investment vehicle that is publicly traded, like a stock, but tracks the performance of an underlying asset or index, rather than one company.\n\n\ud83d\udee2\ufe0f An ETF is a way for investors to get exposure to the value of its underlying asset, like gold or oil.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 ETFs trade on a traditional stock exchange, and their value should rise when the asset increases in price, and fall when it decreases.\n\nSEC Approves First Leveraged Bitcoin Futures ETF\n\nThe first ETF launched in 1993, and they became popular as a way for retail investors to invest in a basket of assets at once. If you wanted to invest in 500 of the largest companies in America at once, you could buy shares in a S&P 500 ETF.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF works in much the same way as any other ETF. Investors buy shares in the ETF through whatever brokerage they buy stocks, and can trade them the same way they'd trade shares in Apple or Tesla.\n\nThe 2x bitcoin ETF $BITX has become effective, scheduled to launch Tuesday. I was doubtful it would happen but looks like it\u2019s official. Could this be early sign of SEC lightening up? After $BITO launch I believe they made earlier 2x filers withdraw pic.twitter.com/XXxSt9xypu \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 23, 2023\n\nBitcoin ETFs track the current price of Bitcoin, and should act in lockstep with Bitcoin's price swings.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy the need for a Bitcoin ETF?\n\nSo, why wouldn\u2019t investors just buy Bitcoin?\n\nFor most regular retail investors, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general still look risky.\n\nBesides having unclear regulations around them, owning Bitcoin requires keeping a Bitcoin wallet and trusting crypto exchanges, which are still uncharted territory for people unfamiliar with the space and require a certain level of self-education.\n\nHolding Bitcoin places the burden of security squarely on you, making you responsible for keeping your own private keys safe (unless you want to entrust them to the exchange). This may mean buying a hardware wallet to protect purchased Bitcoin, or storing private keys in a secure manner. You\u2019d also have to work out how to file taxes for sales of Bitcoin that resulted in capital gains.\n\nHow To File Your Crypto Taxes In The U.S.\n\nWith a Bitcoin ETF, investors need not worry about private keys, storage, or security. They own shares in the ETF just like their shares of stock, and can gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market without having to go through the hoops of purchasing and holding crypto.\n\nAnd to put it plainly, that is an extremely appealing proposition for many regular folks\u2014as well as sophisticated institutional investors.\n\nThat's why so many hedge funds and other investment firms have filed applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for Bitcoin ETFs. Gemini founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss were first out of the gate with an application for the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust in 2013. In 2018, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office awarded the Winklevoss brothers a patent for \u201cexchange-traded products.\" But the SEC still hasn't approved their ETF\u2014or any others.\n\nHow does a Bitcoin ETF work?\n\nA Bitcoin ETF is managed by a firm that buys and holds the actual Bitcoin; the price is pegged to the Bitcoin held in the fund. The firm lists the ETF on a traditional stock exchange, and you, the investor, trade the ETF just as you would any other stock. Bitcoin ETFs also offer new types of trading opportunities, including short-selling, where investors can bet against Bitcoin.\n\nBut there are also some key differences between a Bitcoin ETF and other ETFs.\n\nFirst, some ETFs, like those that track the S&P 500, represent equity shares, so you get a cut of the dividends that any company in the ETF pay to their shareholders. When Tesla pays a dividend and you have shares in an ETF that includes Tesla, you get a (smaller) dividend. Bitcoin is decentralized, so that won't happen with a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nSecond, just like with other ETFs, you have to pay fees to the company offering the ETF. But with a Bitcoin ETF, some portion of your fees would go to paying the custody and management fees for the purchase and storage of the Bitcoin that underlies the ETF.\n\nA brief history of Bitcoin ETF progress\n\nWhat\u2019s so special about a Bitcoin ETF?\n\nA Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. is expected to bring a new level of mainstream trustworthiness and acceptance to Bitcoin investing. In 2020 and 2021, big publicly traded companies including Square and Tesla bought Bitcoin as an investment for their balance sheets, which spurred new adoption\u2014but the cryptocurrency is still seen by many conservative investors as a risky bet or even a gimmick.\n\nThe approval of a Bitcoin ETF by the SEC would mean that institutional investors can more easily speculate on the price of Bitcoin. It would functionally bring Bitcoin to Wall Street, with the Bitcoin ETF traded through the same places as Tesla stock, bonds, gold, oil, or any other traditional assets.\n\nAnd it would likely be a huge boost to the price of Bitcoin.\n\nCannabis ETFs have become popular for many of the same reasons that Bitcoin ETFs have. Just like crypto, the marijuana industry is viewed as risky and uncertain by traditional investors who still want the opportunity to profit from it.\n\nBitcoin Price Stable Despite BitMEX Arrests and Trump's COVID Diagnosis"

        "content": "American investors are increasingly flocking to Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) as major financial institutions ramp up their engagement, bolstering the cryptocurrency's recent surge.\n\nThis information was highlighted by K33 Research, a cryptocurrency analytics firm, in one of their reports, Coindesk reported.\n\nBitcoin witnessed a remarkable 85% surge this year, outshining the majority of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThis positive trend is attributed to the growing involvement of financial giants such as BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), Fidelity and Citadel, which has been a catalyst in boosting investor confidence.\n\nOn the other hand, alternative cryptocurrencies have faced difficulties in the wake of heightened regulatory investigations, particularly concerning their status as unregistered securities.\n\nConsequently, trading platforms have exercised caution and limited the availability of popular tokens in order to circumvent potential risks.\n\nThe report also shed light on Bitcoin's appreciable gains during U.S. market hours, amassing approximately 30% in cumulative gains since plummeting to around $16,000.\n\nInterestingly, the U.S. market outperformed its Asian and European counterparts.\n\nThe activity in the U.S. witnessed a significant spike after BlackRock, the world-renowned asset management firm, submitted an application for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund on June 14.\n\nThe SEC rejected the application today (June 30) as being inadequate. BlackRock can resubmit if it wishes.\n\nAlso Read: The Tax Tides Turn As Slovakia Becomes A Crypto Dreamland\n\nBitcoin has also lately shown signs of disassociation from the U.S. stock markets, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.\n\nAccording to K33, Bitcoin's 30-day correlation with these markets turned negative last week, marking the first such instance since January 2021.\n\nVetle Lunde, a senior analyst at K33, mentioned that \"This illustrates that U.S. traders are allocating in BTC due to idiosyncratic reasons\" and suggested that this could be a move towards portfolio diversification.\n\nBlackRock's proactive steps have played a significant role in reinvigorating institutional participation in the Bitcoin market.\n\nThe Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), which is popular among seasoned investment companies, witnessed open interest approaching its peak, as indicated by K33's data.\n\nAdditionally, digital asset funds reported inflows of $199 million last week, the highest in nearly a year, with Bitcoin-focused funds accounting for 94% of these inflows.\n\nThis was revealed in a separate report by asset management company CoinShares.\n\nRead Next: Binance's Expansion Thwarted: German Regulator Denies Crypto Exchange License\n\nJoin Benzinga's Future of Crypto in New York City on Nov. 14, 2023, to stay updated on trends like AI, regulations, SEC actions & institutional adoption in the crypto space.

However, the SEC has approved various ETFs that own bitcoin futures, not the underlying coin itself.\n\nPart of the SEC's concern with the latest bitcoin ETF applications was that they didn't provide enough information about the \"surveillance-sharing agreement\" they would implement to ensure that the ETF was not susceptible to fraud.\n\nThe CBOE said it plans to revise and resubmit its bitcoin ETF filing, which would push back a potential approval by at least another week after the SEC receives the application, according to the WSJ report."

        "content": "The $4.7 billion Bitcoin (BTC) monthly options expiry on June 30 might play a decisive role in determining whether the $30,000 price will consolidate as long-term support and open room for further bullish momentum.\n\nWhy is Bitcoin breaking yearly highs?\n\nMany analysts consider Bitcoin\u2019s recent breakout above $27,000 to be a bet on the multiple spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications, including those of BlackRock and ARK Invest.\n\nThe news also fueled expectations for Grayscale to be able to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to a Bitcoin ETF.\n\n$31,000 caps Bitcoin price gains for now\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin bears will try to take advantage of macroeconomic and regulatory headwinds, including exchanges implementing mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures.\n\nOn June 28, KuCoin announced an upcoming KYC system upgrade in a move to increase compliance with global Anti-Money Laundering regulations.\n\nMoreover, there\u2019s increasing concern over the impact of miners\u2019 sell pressure, with the network hash rate reaching 400 exahashes per second. Analytics firm Glassnode noted that miners sent an all-time high percentage of their BTC revenue to exchanges over the past week, totaling $128 million. Curiously, the movement mimics spikes seen during the 2021 bull run as miners took profits.\n\nAdditionally, during the European Central Bank Forum on Central Banking in Portugal, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that most policymakers expect two more rate hikes this year. According to the CME's FedWatch Tool, investors are pricing in 82% odds of a 25-basis-point interest rate increase on July 26.\n\nBitcoin 4-hour price movements during option expiries. Source: TradingView\n\nBitcoin price last flirted with the $31,000 level on June 27, but the resistance proved stronger than anticipated. The subsequent correction to $30,000 supports the thesis of sideways trading in the short term as investors evaluate the impacts of additional interest rate increases by the Fed.\n\nSuch a restrictive scenario for the global economy might explain why some Bitcoin traders decided to take profits, which limited the price upside.\n\n$4.7 billion out of reach \u2014 bulls were too optimistic\n\nThe open interest for the June 30 options expiry is $4.7 billion, but the actual figure will be lower since bulls were expecting price levels of $32,000 or higher. These traders got excessively optimistic after Bitcoin\u2019s price rallied 25.5% between June 15 and June 23, testing the $31,000 resistance.\n\nDeribit Bitcoin options aggregate open interest for June 30. Source: Deribit\n\nThe 0.56 put-to-call ratio reflects the imbalance between the $3.1 million in call (buy) open interest and the $1.7 million in put (sell) options.\n\nBut if Bitcoin\u2019s price remains near $30,500 at 8:00 am UTC on June 30, only $630 million worth of these call (buy) options will be available. This difference happens because the right to buy Bitcoin at $31,000 or $32,000 is useless if BTC trades below that level on expiry.\n\nBitcoin bears aim for sub-$30,000 to balance the scales\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on June 30 for call (bull) and put (bear) instruments varies depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit.\n\nBetween $28,000 and $29,000: 7,200 calls vs. 16,200 puts. Bears are in control, profiting $250 million.\n\n7,200 calls vs. 16,200 puts. Bears are in control, profiting $250 million. Between $29,000 and $30,000: 13,000 calls vs. 12,600 puts. The result is balanced between put and call options.\n\n13,000 calls vs. 12,600 puts. The result is balanced between put and call options. Between $30,000 and $31,000: 1,500 calls vs. 2,100 puts. The net result favors the call instruments by $440 million.\n\n1,500 calls vs. 2,100 puts. The net result favors the call instruments by $440 million. Between $31,000 and $32,000: 3,300 calls vs. 800 puts. The net result favors the call instruments by $670 million.\n\nThis crude estimate considers the call options used in bullish bets and the put options exclusively in neutral-to-bearish trades. Even so, this oversimplification disregards more complex investment strategies.\n\nFor instance, a trader could have sold a put option, effectively gaining positive exposure to Bitcoin above a specific price. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no easy way to estimate this effect.\n\nRelated: Will $30K be a new springboard for Bitcoin bulls?\n\nConsequently, it will come down to whether BTC price bears are willing to risk exposure while a potential spot Bitcoin ETF approval is being analyzed by the SEC.\n\nAlthough it is impossible to estimate the potential inflow or the timing of such an event, it paves the way for bulls to secure a $440 million profit by keeping Bitcoin price above $30,000 in the short term.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "There is no doubt that BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application \u2014 and the flood of contenders that followed \u2014 has buoyed the bulls. It could signal the winds of change in the regulatory sphere, they say. It could bring Bitcoin exposure to the masses, they holler.\n\nWhile there might be some truth in these statements, we need to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. We should not be in a world where the mere possibility of a spot Bitcoin ETF coming to fruition in the United States sends markets into overdrive. BlackRock\u2019s potentially oversized impact on Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price trajectory should give everyone in the Bitcoin community pause for thought rather than be a cause of celebration.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF would clearly be a simple way for U.S. retirement funds to gain exposure to Bitcoin\u2019s upside, and it\u2019s very possible that an approved ETF in the U.S. would drive significant price appreciation in the years that follow. But what will it do to further Bitcoin\u2019s cause \u2014 to decentralize finance, empower the unbanked and revolutionize how we interact with money globally? Very little, if anything.\n\nThe TradFi invasion\n\nBlackRock\u2019s application and the discussions around it have certainly served as a reminder of the distrust that exists between some parts of the crypto community and the traditional finance world.\n\nRelated: Ripple verdict could spark a new bull market \u2014 or more malaise\n\nThe timing of BlackRock\u2019s foray into Bitcoin ETFs is particularly intriguing and has sent conspiracists wild. Given the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, some believe the agency is disarming crypto-native firms to pave the way for the likes of BlackRock to take over the crypto mantle.\n\nOf course, such claims are unsubstantiated speculation. However, they demonstrate how the more deeply involved traditional finance (TradFi) entities become in the digital assets space, the more we risk Bitcoin becoming just another asset class and losing sight of its intended purpose and true value proposition.\n\nThese are the key dates and timeline for the BlackRock Spot Bitcoin ETF\n\n\n\nThis is how I'm positioning over the coming weeks... pic.twitter.com/V1Kwvbh8Rc \u2014 \u039e huf (@hufhaus9) June 26, 2023\n\nWhen you delve further into the details of BlackRock\u2019s filing, the alarm bells start ringing louder. The filing makes a provision that in the event of a hard fork, BlackRock can \u201cuse its discretion to determine which network should be considered the appropriate network for the Trust\u2019s purposes.\u201d This could potentially be significant, enabling BlackRock to attempt to weigh in on Bitcoin\u2019s direction \u2014 or at least steer institutional allocations and mainstream uptake.\n\nOversized influence on what is intended to be a decentralized monetary system is clearly a cause for concern in and of itself, but the broader issue with ETFs is that investors cannot withdraw the underlying Bitcoin. It\u2019s in the ownership of Bitcoin that the true benefits lie.\n\nUpholding Bitcoin\u2019s ethos\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that Bitcoin was created as a direct response to the bailouts and quantitative easing that followed the 2008 financial crisis. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin has a limited supply, is genuinely scarce and operates with decentralized governance.\n\nFifteen years on from the crash, central banks around the world can still not break the habit of printing money, using it as a \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card. Except it is nothing but free. Ordinary, hard-working individuals the world over are paying the price as their currencies are debased, which is now exacerbated by soaring nontransitory inflation.\n\nRelated: Gary Gensler is hurting the little guys for Wall Street\n\nWhile central banks play Russian roulette with public finances, Bitcoin\u2019s ethos is to empower individuals by providing a censorship-resistant, borderless form of money. As an open-source monetary network, Bitcoin has the power to transform the way we interact with money. It could significantly reduce the importance of centralized institutions \u2014 perhaps even render them obsolete \u2014 which the conspiracists would say TradFi knows only too well.\n\nBitcoin ETFs seem at odds with this empowerment ethos. El Salvador \u2014 with its radical approach to Bitcoin adoption \u2014 is arguably more aligned with Bitcoin\u2019s core aims than any ETF could ever be. While El Salvador seeks to empower the unbanked through actively promoting Bitcoin ownership, Bitcoin ETF investors will be left without any of the benefits of Bitcoin while lining the pockets of \u2014 and cementing the status of \u2014 TradFi institutions.\n\nOwnership over price speculation\n\nBitcoin spot ETFs are likely to establish a stronger presence within the cryptocurrency ecosystem in the years to come and appeal to a certain class of investors, yet their role should not overshadow the trajectory of Bitcoin\u2019s future. If we only focus on giving people exposure to price movements without actual ownership, then we will have totally missed the point of what could be a revolutionary monetary system. And no, if a rule is ever proposed that demands retail can only invest via ETFs rather than through direct ownership, this is not \u201cconsumer protection.\u201d It spells their disempowerment.\n\nOur industry should maintain a cautious stance, understanding that the increasing involvement of ETFs and traditional finance in the cryptosphere could pose risks to the underlying purpose of Bitcoin. Being alert to these risks means not getting blinded by the hype, but remaining committed to the original ethos of Bitcoin \u2014 a tool to transform the world\u2019s financial systems, not merely an asset for speculation.\n\nBen Caselin is vice president and chief strategy officer at MaskEX, a digital assets trading platform headquartered in Dubai, UAE.

        "title": "Why approving a Bitcoin ETF might unleash $18B in sell-pressure - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The introduction of a spot-based Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) would make the asset more accessible to individual investors and mutual funds. What\u2019s more, unlike a futures-based Bitcoin ETF, a spot-based ETF involves actually buying BTC.\n\nSo, will the approval of the first Bitcoin ETF be a bullish event? Not necessarily.\n\nGBTC \u2018discount\u2019 remains in the double digits\n\nOver the years, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rejected every Bitcoin ETF applicant, with the latest denial issued to the VanEck Bitcoin Trust on March 10, 2023.\n\nThe SEC concluded that the offer did not have a \u201ccomprehensive surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size related to spot Bitcoin.\u201c Regulators are hesitant to release what many believe would be a more equitable and transparent Bitcoin product.\n\nInvestors now question whether the latest bids from ARK Invest and BlackRock to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs might be the solution to Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), an investment vehicle with shares traded on the stock exchange.\n\nInterestingly, the GBTC \u201cpremium\u201d jumped to its best levels in months after BlackRock announced its ETF filing.\n\nGrayscale GBTC premium/discount to net assets. Source: CoinGlass\n\nBut while the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF might seem bullish initially, its consequences for the BTC price can be negative, at least in the short term.\n\nWhat\u2019s an ETF?\n\nFirst, an ETF is a form of security that holds diverse underlying investments, such as commodities, stocks and bonds. The ETF may resemble a mutual fund because its issuer pools and manages the given assets.\n\nThe most well-known example of this instrument is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, which tracks the S&P 500 index. State Street manages the mutual fund\u2019s $436 billion worth of assets.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETF race gets hotter as ARK Invest adds surveillance agreement to application\n\nBuying an ETF grants the investor direct ownership of the fund\u2019s contents, resulting in different tax consequences than holding futures contracts or leveraged positions. While Bitcoin spot ETFs continue to be rejected, identical products have been available for decades for bonds, global currencies, gold, Chinese equities, real estate and oil.\n\n30% GBTC discount is likely justified\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust \u2014 an investment fund with $18.4 billion of assets under management \u2014 is currently trading at a -30% discount versus its Bitcoin holdings. This gap between their 626,778 Bitcoin at market value and the GBTC shares trading on regular stock exchanges reached as low as -49% in December 2022.\n\nConsequently, this discount is likely justified as the instrument lacks the tools to allow arbitrage. Grayscale\u2019s GBTC is the undisputed leader in the cryptocurrency market, despite being classified as a closed-end fund, which means that the number of available shares is limited.\n\nShares of GBTC are not freely created, nor do they have a redemption plan. Due to this inefficiency, there are large price differences when compared to the fund\u2019s actual Bitcoin holdings. In contrast, an ETF gives the market maker the ability to issue and redeem shares, ensuring that the premium or discount is typically small.\n\nGBTC charges a set 2% annual administrative fee; therefore, the discount may be acceptable given that the SEC continues to reject appeals and requests from all fund managers.\n\nOn the other hand, ETFs typically trade at par with net assets, as opposed to GBTC. For example, the Purpose Bitcoin ETF (BTCC.U) held a $5.63 net asset value per share on June 27, and the shares closed at $5.65 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\n\nSimilarly, the U.S. derivatives ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF underlying price was $16.89 on June 28, while its shares traded at $16.89.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF approval might initially pressure BTC\n\nEssentially, an investment trust product is considerably less desirable than an ETF, and Grayscale has done little to mitigate the impact on GBTC investors thus far. However, market sentiment improved modestly after the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, filed to launch a Bitcoin spot price ETF.\n\nThe share price discount versus its contents will eventually trend to zero as redemptions and arbitrage opportunities arise if the SEC grants the asset manager Grayscale permission to convert its GBTC Trust to a bonafide Bitcoin ETF.\n\nIn this scenario, the odds are that a considerable amount of BTC could enter the market as investors will finally be able to exit their position at par.\n\nThe only question is: how much of that $18 billion will flow into other Bitcoin-related instruments or get sold on exchanges?\n\nIn any case, there\u2019s a good chance that a spot Bitcoin ETF approval will produce significant sell-pressure from Grayscale\u2019s GBTC conversion as BTC that\u2019s been locked for three to eight years reenters the market.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "There may be a longer wait for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, as the Securities and Exchange Commission labeled investment managers\u2019 recent applications inadequate.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, the securities regulator told the Nasdaq and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) that their filings are not \u201csufficiently clear and comprehensive.\u201d These exchanges represent asset managers in the filing of the financial product.\n\nIn the eyes of the SEC, the exchanges should have named the spot Bitcoin exchange with which they would have a \"surveillance-sharing agreement\" or provided sufficient information about the details of those surveillance arrangements. However, asset managers can resubmit the filings after clarifying the information.\n\nA flurry of applications has been filed over the past few weeks since BlackRock joined the list of companies seeking to debut the first spot Bitcoin ETF of Wall Street. BlackRock\u2019s application introduced a \u201csurveillance sharing agreement,\u201d under which information about market trading and clearing activities are shared between entities to avoid the possibility of market manipulation.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s application led ARK Invest and 21Shares to amend their third application for a spot BTC ETF to include a similar surveillance agreement. Other asset managers that refiled or amended their applications in the past days include Invesco, WisdomTree, Valkyrie and Fidelity. ARK Invest, however, is reportedly a front-runner in this race.\n\nETFs track a specific index and are generally traded on exchanges. In the cryptocurrency market, a fund that tracks the price of one or multiple digital tokens and consists of various cryptocurrencies is called a cryptocurrency ETF.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs have been denied since 2017 by the SEC. In Canada, however, the financial product is already available. Three significant funds \u2014 Purpose Bitcoin, 3iQ CoinShares and CI Galaxy Bitcoin \u2014 are all directly invested in spot Bitcoin.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with \u2018Net Zero\u2019 promises"

        "content": "Fidelity Investments is the latest financial services heavyweight to throw its name into the race to offer the first U.S. exchange-traded fund investing directly in bitcoin.\n\nThe Boston-based asset manager, which has about $11 trillion in assets under administration and tens of millions of customers, refiled for the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, according to a document submitted Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Similar to previous U.S. spot bitcoin ETF filings in the past few weeks, the updated application says that Fidelity expects to enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement with a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest high-profile traditional finance firm to join the race, after BlackRock Inc. made a splash with its June 15 application for a spot ETF, which opened the floodgates for others to try their hand at it, as well. For crypto fans, it\u2019s been a significant string of developments given BlackRock\u2019s reputation on Wall Street, and the view held by some market-watchers that the asset manager wouldn\u2019t be making an attempt were it not confident it could get regulatory approval.\n\nThere have been about 30 tries for a spot-bitcoin product, according to a tally from Bloomberg Intelligence. But applications have faced opposition by regulators, who have in the past cited market concerns and a lack of investor protections, among other things. Fidelity originally filed for the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust in 2021, which was denied by the SEC in January 2022, according to a Fidelity spokesperson.\n\nEven so, BlackRock\u2019s move spurred a number of similar filings from other issuers, including by Invesco Ltd., WisdomTree, Valkyrie and Bitwise. Meanwhile, Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Investment Management has said that it believes it could be first in line to get any potential regulatory approval. ARK had in April, in conjunction with crypto-issuer 21Shares, refiled its application for one.\n\nTo be sure, this isn\u2019t the first hype cycle over a potential launch. Crypto fans, who have been yearning for a spot-bitcoin ETF for years, have been through periods of excitement before, only for regulators to ultimately rebuff all attempts.\n\nWhile BlackRock\u2019s filing was credited by observers for helping to push the price of bitcoin to a one-year high last week, the market reaction to the Fidelity refiling was fairly muted. Bitcoin was up about 1.5% to $30,500 as of 2:25 p.m. Thursday in New York, though off the highest level of the day.\n\n[More: Crypto exchange backed by Citadel Securities, Fidelity, Schwab starts up]"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitcoin Cash price reaches a 14-month high following an international trading rally\n\nThe \u2018next big\u2019 crypto exchange endorses Bitcoin Cash\n\nUS officials support BCH as a viable payment option\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) continues to rise in value following the news of surging activity in the Bitcoin cash-Korean won (BCH/KRW) pair on Upbit, a South Korean cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nThe Bitcoin fork was already performing splendidly due to the news of EDX Markets, a new exchange backed by Fidelity, Citadel Security, and Charles Schwab, allowing the trade of the cryptocurrency on its platform.\n\nBCH Surges\n\nOn June 20th, EDX Markets, a new exchange backed by a few of the wealthiest financial institutions in the US, announced its launch. EDXM will only allow the trade of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, LiteCoin, and Ethereum. These tokens are ones excluded from the war the SEC is waging against crypto.\n\nNaturally, the news caused Bitcoin Cash to witness a surge in its price, increasing by 24% overnight.\n\nNow, Upbit, a Korean crypto exchange, reports an increase in Bitcoin Cash trading volumes reaching $557.63 million in the past 24 hours. The sudden increase shows an almost 350% increase in the token\u2019s activity on Upbit.\n\nBCH now trades for ~$320, the highest price Bitcoin Cash has reached in over a year.\n\nLawrence Lewitinn, Director of Content for The Tie, a crypto data company, stated that \u201cthe BCH rally can be seen as a combination of hope and a touch of greed, two of the ingredients that often fuel market movements in the cryptocurrency space, regardless of underlying fundamentals,\u201d\n\nHowever, Lewitinn failed to mention one more key factor that may have influenced the support for Bitcoin Cash, governmental support.\n\nBitcoin Cash\u2019s SEC Clearance\n\nIt\u2019s no secret at this point that the US Securities and Exchange Commission is waging a serious war against crypto. The regulating body is battling against the world\u2019s biggest exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase, and Ripple.\n\nThe crux of the SEC\u2019s argument in each case is that these exchanges are trading in what the SEC recognizes as \u201cunregistered securities\u201d. However, these cases never include any mention of four specific tokens: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, LiteCoin, and Ethereum.\n\nGensler himself admitted, way before he became the SEC Chair, that these coins are \u201cnot securities\u201d, effectively recognizing them as \u201ccommodities\u201d. And, with that in mind, these tokens are immune to SEC attacks on the matter.\n\nFor that very reason, EDXM took the smart decision to only allow trading using those tokens. On top of that, asset management firms such as BlackRock and Fidelity are filing spot ETFs that only concern Bitcoin.\n\nIf Lewitinn is right, then BCH and Co should be on a steady trajectory towards much higher prices by the end of the year as they gain more and more interest from institutional investors."

The coin is one of the lucky four chosen for EDX Markets, a new crypto exchange backed by major Wall Street players Charles Schwab, Citadel Securities, and Fidelity Digital Assets.\n\nEDX, which launched last week, decided to let its traders\u2014institutional investors only\u2014start off with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nThe reason is simple: regulatory clarity.\n\n\u201cThese specific cryptocurrencies are generally perceived as commodities by regulatory bodies, which significantly mitigates potential legal challenges,\u201d Sei Labs co-founder Jeff Feng told Decrypt.\n\nYouwei Yang, Chief Economist at BTCM, added that the four assets are \u201cwidely regarded as digital commodities, making them relatively safe\u201d from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission because they are made with electricity\u2014a commodity.\n\nIn perhaps its toughest regulatory crackdown yet, the SEC has gone after a number of major crypto brands for allegedly flogging unregistered securities. Earlier this month, it went after Coinbase for allegedly offering and selling unregistered securities via its staking service. It also targeted Binance, the world\u2019s biggest exchange, with a massive lawsuit for allegedly \u201coperating as a fking [sic] unlicensed securities exchange in the U.S.A. bro,\u201d according to the SEC.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn February, it hit Kraken with a $30 million fine for allegedly failing to register the offer and sale of its crypto asset staking-as-a-service program.\n\nThese regulatory enforcements are all because SEC Chairman Gary Gensler thinks\u2014and has said for years\u2014that most cryptocurrencies are unregistered securities.\n\nBut he has made it clear that Bitcoin is a commodity. He has been less clear on Ethereum, but the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CTFC) has said the asset is a commodity.\n\nAnd Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin are both Bitcoin forks\u2014new cryptocurrencies that emerged from the asset\u2019s original code\u2014meaning they are likely to have the same status in the eyes of regulators.\n\nGreg Moritz, Co-Founder at the crypto hedge fund AltTab Capital, said that \u201cnone have been listed by the SEC as unregistered securities,\u201d adding that all four assets are established and have history, \u201ckey factors in the decision-making process of EDX\u2019s backers.\u201d\n\nEDX Markets CEO Jamil Nazarali also said that he felt \u201cvery comfortable\u201d that the four assets weren\u2019t securities.\n\nFor now, these four \u201cold school\u201d cryptocurrencies will give \u201cold school\u201d investors a taste of the crypto world. But things could change, Feng noted. \u201cAs regulations evolve and the understanding of different cryptocurrencies becomes more nuanced, we could anticipate exchanges like EDX broadening their offerings,\u201d he added.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) continues its uptrend that started after its listing on Citadel Securities, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Charles Schwab Corp.,-backed EDX Markets on June 20.\n\nThe BCH token is the highest weekly gainer in the top 300 tokens by market capitalization on CoinGecko, with 114.3% gains.\n\nIn comparison, Bitcoin (BTC) recorded 2.4% gains in the same period, while Ethereum (ETH) traded at par with last week\u2019s price.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe latest 33.9% gain in BCH\u2019s price in the last 24 hours appears to be driven by excess negative bets in the derivatives market fueling an uptrend and heightened trading interest on a South Korean exchange.\n\nA vertical rise\n\nThe EDX Markets exchange listing is considered by some to be a good proxy for the state of BCH's regulatory clearance. Jamil Nazarali, CEO of EDX Markets, deemed that the four crypto tokens listed on EDX Markets (Bitcoin, Ether, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin) were safe bets in terms of compliance with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nBCH\u2019s price was heavily suppressed for the calendar year, ranging between $100 and $150. Nevertheless, it has risen vertically after its listing on EDX Markets. BCH was last trading at $308.72, levels last seen 14 months ago in May 2022.\n\nCrypto research outlet The Tie found that BCH trading volumes on Binance reached levels not seen in two years as trading interest returned toward BCH after EDX Markets listing.\n\nEDX is still new, and its trading volume is relatively small compared to major exchanges like Binance, however this new enthusiasm for $BCH is evident in trading volume on Binance as well. $BCH trading volume on Binance has reached levels unseen in the past two years. pic.twitter.com/TS4kkdpsQG \u2014 The Tie (@TheTieIO) June 29, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile the increase in trading volume after a positive catalyst is a sign of strong market participation and interest in the asset, the uptrend is partly driven by a short squeeze and a surprising volume spike on the South Korean exchange, Upbit.\n\nA short squeeze is a phenomenon that occurs when an asset's price rises, as most traders who had bet against its price are forced to buy at a loss or experience forced liquidation.\n\nThe price volatility took out $19 million in liquidations in the last 24 hours, with short orders accounting for 77% of the total amount, representing the highest liquidation levels in June 2023, per Coinglass data.\n\nBCH liquidations over the past 30 days. Source: Coinglass BCH liquidations over the past 30 days. Source: Coinglass\n\nThe token also witnessed a surge in trading on the South Korean exchange Upbit. CoinGecko data shows that the 24-hour trading volume of the BCH/KRW pair on Upbit at $685 million is twice that of BCH trading volumes on Binance.\n\nIn fact, the BCH/KRW trading volume of Upbit was comparable to the BTC/USD pair trading volume of $508 million on Coinbase, the largest U.S.-based exchange."

        "title": "Reports of Fidelity's imminent Bitcoin spot ETF filing boosts crypto - Forkast News",
        "content": "In this issue\n\nFidelity: Close to filing its own Bitcoin ETF Forkast 500 NFT Index: Azuki disappoints Asset tokenization in Singapore: One step closer\n\nFrom the Editor\u2019s Desk Dear Reader, There\u2019s a saying in gambling circles that the house always wins. It\u2019s not an unreasonable supposition, given the fact that if casino operators didn\u2019t bring in more cash than they paid out, they\u2019d be forced to shut up shop. Some in the crypto community might be applying that same saying to the bastions of traditional finance this week as Wall Street appears to be putting another move on cryptocurrencies in which the ultimate winner seems set to be itself. Fidelity, one of the world\u2019s biggest asset managers, is reportedly preparing to file an application to establish a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. That would be a big bet on crypto \u2014 or at least on the coin that started it all. Almost by definition, it would also be a bet against the hostility to crypto shown by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission since the collapse of the FTX exchange last year. The regulator\u2019s apparent distaste for crypto has made casualties of many companies in the sector that have bet against it in recent times. Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Genesis and Gemini have all been on the receiving end of enforcement action, and the commission has set its sights on cryptocurrencies. Traditional finance firms have also bet against the SEC and lost, although only in terms of commercial opportunities that have gone untapped rather than actual penalties, losses and business closures. As we note in this week\u2019s edition of The Current Forkast, Fidelity\u2019s application for a spot Bitcoin ETF isn\u2019t the company\u2019s first. Indeed, the SEC has turned down every application for such a fund to date. But traditional finance sector players such as Fidelity and BlackRock, which lodged a spot Bitcoin ETF application a fortnight ago, are now showing increased confidence about their prospects of gaining the regulator\u2019s favor. Perhaps it\u2019s because they\u2019re buoyed by judicial skepticism about the SEC\u2019s reasoning in denying a spot Bitcoin ETF license to crypto asset manager Grayscale. Perhaps it\u2019s also because they sense the pendulum might have swung too far against crypto and that the regulator may be minded to offer the industry a concession in the form of a vanilla financial product. Overall, the house needs to win to keep the tables open. Yet the original question posed by crypto was: Who runs the house? Given that the SEC appears unilaterally to have made up its mind, it feels like high time others started asking that question once again. Until the next time, Angie Lau,\n\nFounder and Editor-in-Chief\n\nForkast.News\n\n1. Bull run\n\nFidelity joins a list of financial institutions that in June submitted or updated their applications to issue spot Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock, WisdomTree, Invesco, Valkyrie and Bitwise. Image: Fidelity Investments/Canva\n\nCryptocurrencies are receiving a significant push as Fidelity Investments is reportedly nearing the filing of its own spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the Block reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe move would not be Fidelity\u2019s first attempt to file for a Bitcoin-backed ETF. In March 2021, the Wall Street giant filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF named the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, which was rejected by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in January 2022. But it launched the Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF in Canada in December 2021, which has risen 75% since the beginning of this year.\n\nAccording to the Block, Fidelity\u2019s application will join the list of financial institutions that have recently submitted or updated their applications to issue spot Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock, WisdomTree, Invesco, Valkyrie and Bitwise.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF is a publicly traded investment vehicle tracking Bitcoin price, which allows investors to have Bitcoin exposure without directly handling the underlying cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cBitcoin ETF applications have supported investors\u2019 sentiment as institutional and retail investors could show increasing interest in the market through such investment vehicles,\u201d said Denys Peleshok, head of Asia at Belize-based financial brokerage CPT Markets, in email comments.\n\n\u201cIf the SEC approves new applications, the market could record a surge in demand and in the number of buyers,\u201d said Peleshok. \u201cDue to the SEC\u2019s legal stance over cryptocurrencies, the market could further concentrate on Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest assets in the market.\u201d\n\nSince BlackRock filed for its Bitcoin ETF on June 15, Bitcoin is up by more than 22%, peaking at US$31,389 on June 23, the highest since June 2022. Bitcoin traded at US$30,433, at press time, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nForkast.Insights | What does it mean? The potential foray of Fidelity, globally recognized as the third largest asset manager, into the ETF domain hardly raises eyebrows among those tuned in to the vibrant buzz of Twitter\u2019s rumor universe. In the wake of the ETF application of the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, industry watchers projected that Fidelity, the Bostonian investment giant with US$4.2 trillion in assets under management, would be the subsequent contender to lodge and apply for a spot Bitcoin ETF. This topic also fuelled speculation that Fidelity might put in a bid for Grayscale, the digital asset manager responsible for the US$13.5 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, the world\u2019s biggest Bitcoin fund. So far, there has been no substantial evidence for the buyout. Fidelity has taken a proactive stance in embracing Bitcoin and other digital assets, eclipsing many of its traditional finance contemporaries. The firm claims that its research on the asset class dates back to 2014. In 2018, the firm launched an institutional trading platform for Bitcoin and Ethereum. A year later, in 2019, it expanded its venture into the Bitcoin mining business through Bitcoin technology firm Blockstream\u2019s institutional mining service. Last year, it even joined the lengthy list of firms whose Bitcoin ETF applications got rejected by the SEC. And last week, EDX Markets, a non-custodial crypto exchange backed by Fidelity and other Wall Street titans, went live. In addition, Fidelity has shown an assertive drive in obtaining indirect exposure to Bitcoin via Microstrategy, the preeminent corporate Bitcoin holder globally. Fidelity has secured its position as Microstrategy\u2019s third largest shareholder, possessing 6.7% of the stock, valued at over US$225 million. BlackRock follows as the fourth largest owner with 5.58%, approximating around US$185 million. Despite the entrance of these behemoth asset managers into the U.S. ETF race, the waiting list is long. ARK Invest Chief Executive Officer Cathy Wood claims that her firm is in position to launch the first spot-Bitcoin ETF in the world\u2019s largest economy.\n\n2. Liquid dreams\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe NFT markets saw another week of decline, and again, Ethereum\u2019s NFT ecosystem is dragging the broader market down. The Forkast 500 NFT Index is down 1.32%, as Ethereum\u2019s decline of 1.51% stands in stark contrast to Solana, Polygon, and Cardano\u2019s gains in value of 1.7%, 1.23% and 5.75%, respectively.\n\nEthereum sales volume rose 318% on Thursday following Azuki\u2019s Elementals mint, which brought in US$38 million to the Azuki team in just 15 minutes.\n\nAzuki\u2019s floor price decreased 45% to 9 Ether following the Elementals mint, and the average sales price declined to US$23,000, down from US$39,000 the previous seven days.\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club\u2019s average sales price is up in the past seven days to US$79,214. However large BAYC holders like Machi Big Brother and Franklin have combined to sell over 60 Bored Apes, applying downward pressure on the collection.\n\nSolana\u2019s 98,917 transactions on June 25 were its single highest daily total of NFT transactions in over eight months. September 2022 was the last time the blockchain had this level of activity, when the Y00ts were still surging on Solana.\n\nSeven-day sales volume was up across several blockchains with Ethereum up 105%, Bitcoin 22%, Solana 24%, and Polygon 10%. Mythos Chain, BNB, and Flow were down 18%, 20% and 23%, respectively.\n\nDeGods is now the third most expensive PFP based on floor price following Azuki\u2019s falling prices. Azuki\u2019s cheapest NFTs are selling for as low as 8.5 ETH, while DeGods is nearly 1 ETH higher at 9.5 ETH.\n\nForkast.Insights | What does it mean? This year\u2019s biggest new NFT mint took place on Tuesday, as one of the top NFT projects, Azuki, delivered a new collection called Elementals. While some were hopeful the new collection would breathe life into the NFT markets, it instead drained liquidity from traders who sold assets across projects to afford the hefty 2 ETH mint price. The impact was visible on the Forkast 500 NFT Index even in the midst of Ethereum NFTs having its single highest day of sales volume this year with US$58 million. Azuki\u2019s Elementals did provide some lucky traders with rare Elementals NFTs that were flipped for over 30 ETH, but most secondary sales are taking place well below the collection\u2019s 2 ETH mint price. Instead of Azuki\u2019s Elementals helping the broader NFT ecosystem, it instead sucked liquidity from holders, and almost across the board, brought other collections\u2019 sales prices down with it. What went wrong with Azuki\u2019s mint is a familiar story, and shows that the NFT space may not be as mature as some would like to believe. Starting from the initial sale that left many Azuki and Beanz holders stuck on a loading page, and ultimately unable to mint, to the massively underwhelming art reveal that almost looks like duplicates of the main Azuki collection, NFT projects talk about innovation, yet time after time, fail to deliver it. For all the talk of innovation, we have witnessed few examples of it, and other than functioning as \u2018meme coins\u2019, traders shouldn\u2019t expect another NFT boom until we see actual innovation. If the Azuki team can turn around the current negative sentiment in their project and help foster the higher floor prices that their holders have come to expect, we may then see sales with profits that roll into existing collections floors. We\u2019ll be watching.\n\n3. Singapore calling\n\nMAS\u2019 move comes as Singapore seeks to utilize the power of blockchains in its financial system, while minimizing risks of crypto assets. Image: Fidelity Investments/Canva\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the city state\u2019s central bank, has proposed a framework to design open and interoperable networks for digital assets, as the country seeks to harness the power of asset tokenization to improve its traditional financial services.\n\n\u201cThe real value in the digital asset ecosystem\u201d lies in the tokenization of real-world and financial assets through distributed ledger technologies and smart contracts, which could \u201cenhance the efficiency, accessibility, and affordability of financial services,\u201d MAS wrote in its report.\n\n\u201cUnless digital asset networks are interoperable, both with each other and with traditional financial market infrastructures, fragmentation would reduce the network benefits and can create frictions such as inaccessibility, increased liquidity requirements due to separation of liquidity pools, and pricing arbitrage,\u201d noted MAS.\n\nMAS\u2019 proposal \u2013 jointly developed with the Bank for International Settlements and other financial institutions \u2013 is part of Singapore\u2019s Project Guardian initiatives announced in May 2022 to explore the adoption of asset tokenization and decentralized finance in the city state\u2019s financial industry.\n\nMAS also announced an expansion of Project Guardian to test the potential of asset tokenization across more financial asset classes, enlisting 11 financial institutions \u2014 including banking giants Citi, HSBC, DBS and Standard Chartered \u2014 to form the Project Guardian Industry Group to lead industry pilots in asset and wealth management, foreign exchange and fixed income.\n\nJapan Financial Services Agency, the first overseas financial regulator to join Project Guardian, will work with MAS on digital asset innovation while safeguarding against risks to financial stability and integrity.\n\nMAS\u2019 move comes as Singapore seeks to utilize the power of blockchains in its financial system, while minimizing risks of crypto assets. Last Thursday, The Asia-Pacific branch of technology firm Ripple Labs said it would start offering crypto-enabled digital payment services in Singapore after receiving in-principle approval from the MAS.\n\nAlso on Thursday, MAS released a whitepaper \u2013 jointly developed by the International Monetary Fund, Amazon, DBS Bank, and multiple other industry players.\u2013 for \u201cpurpose-bound\u201d money, detailing a technical overview of digital currencies designed for specific purposes."

        "title": "Up More Than 240% in 2023, This Bitcoin Mining Stock Is Still a Screaming Buy - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "As the competition in the Bitcoin (BTC 0.60%) mining industry intensifies, one company stands out in a crowded field. Already recognized as one of the premier Bitcoin mining companies, Riot Platforms (RIOT 0.95%) is on the verge of extending its lead and solidifying its position as the industry leader.\n\nThanks to a groundbreaking agreement and ambitious expansion plans, Riot is positioned for long-term success and poised to capitalize on the growing profitability of Bitcoin mining.\n\nThe game-changing announcement\n\nOn June 26, Riot made headlines when the company announced its agreement to purchase 33,280 mining rigs from MicroBT, an up-and-coming manufacturer of Bitcoin mining equipment. With a total cost of $162.9 million, the state-of-the-art miners will be manufactured in the U.S. and are expected to nearly double Riot's mining capacity of 10.5 exahashes per second (EH/s), reaching an impressive 20.1 EH/s. These cutting-edge machines will be deployed at Riot's new facility in Corsicana, Texas, with delivery scheduled by the end of the year and operation commencing in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nFurthermore, Riot has secured an option to purchase an additional 66,560 miners, which, if exercised, would elevate its hash rate capacity to a staggering 35.4 EH/s, positioning it to become the leading Bitcoin miner by hash rate.\n\nHash rate refers to the computational power a Bitcoin mining company contributes to the network and represents its effective mining capacity. Simply put, the greater the hash rate, the greater the ability to mine Bitcoin.\n\nStrengthening its leadership position\n\nThe added benefits of a more streamlined domestic supply chain and additional miners coming online will likely only add to Riot's dominance of Bitcoin mining production. Year to date in 2023 the company ranks third in total bitcoins mined and finished 2022 as second overall.\n\nThe company has also demonstrated remarkable efficiency by keeping mining expenses minimized. Riot ranks as the second most cost-effective miner in terms of cost per bitcoin mined and also boasts a near unheard-of financial position with virtually no debt.\n\nHowever, one of Riot's most advantageous factors is its ability to offset electricity costs. This is made possible by its strategic location in Texas, where it takes advantage of the unique flexibility offered by the Texas power grid. Unlike other regions, the Lone Star State has an independent power grid infrastructure that grants Riot the opportunity to sell excess electricity back to the grid during periods of high demand, further contributing to its profitability.\n\nEmbracing the future\n\nWhile the announcement of additional miners is advantageous in itself, when considering the current landscape of the crypto economy, Riot's upside looks even more compelling.\n\nDespite a challenging second half of 2022, when Bitcoin's price plummeted by 70%, Riot demonstrated its resilience by weathering the worst of the bear market and strategically managing its reserves. Now, as Bitcoin regains momentum, Riot is poised to capitalize on revived profitability and potentially surpass the cryptocurrency's performance itself if a bull market returns. This year alone serves as evidence, with Riot's stock surging over 245% year to date, outpacing Bitcoin's more modest 75% gain.\n\nAchieving success as a Bitcoin miner lies in its ability to maximize machine power and efficiently manage costs. This rare combination is precisely what sets Riot apart from its competitors. Based on its track record and plans to increase mining production, Riot is in a position to cement itself as the leader of Bitcoin mining for years to come."

Discover SCENE\n\nEarlier today, it was Bitcoin Cash\u2014now, it's Litecoin.\n\nThe two cryptocurrencies have received renewed interest from investors since Wall Street-backed EDX Markets listed them last week.\n\nBoth were arguably fading into obscurity but are now soaring\u2014especially Litecoin, which just reentered the top 10 biggest digital assets by market cap.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Bitcoin fork is up 23.6% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko, trading hands for $104.63. That makes it one of the best-performing digital assets right now.\n\nAnd in the past seven days, it has shot up by 15% in value, meaning that it has regained its spot in the top 10 digital assets, with a market cap of $7.7 billion.\n\nOne likely reason for the renewed interest in Litecoin is that it's one of just four cryptocurrencies chosen by the Citadel Securities and Fidelity-backed EDX Markets to trade on its exchange. This is because\u2014along with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum\u2014regulators are unlikely to target it for being an unregistered security, experts told Decrypt.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission this year has launched a tough crackdown on the crypto industry\u2014particularly coins and tokens it considers unregistered securities.\n\nEDX CEO Jamil Nazarali said that he felt \"very comfortable\" the four assets listed on EDX weren't securities.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEDX is a new exchange backed by \"TradFi\" heavyweights Charles Schwab, Citadel Securities, and Fidelity Digital Assets.\n\nThe launch of the exchange has led investors to plug cash into crypto, leading to a bit of a bull run. But it's not just Wall Street that's likely responsible for this sudden jump.\n\nLitecoin is also due for its \"halving\" later next month, when the supply of coins for mining rewards will be cut in half, meaning fewer of the digital coins will be created. Such events have previously given rise to bullish price action for coins, such as during the run-up to recent Bitcoin halvings.\n\nANDDD THERE'S LITECOIN WAKING UP pic.twitter.com/DXa2LEvvBk \u2014 K A L E O (@CryptoKaleo) June 30, 2023\n\nLitecoin was launched in 2011 by ex-Google employee Charlie Lee. He wanted to create a faster, cheaper version of Bitcoin and so forked the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe objective was to make a peer-to-peer cash system cheaper than the oldest and most well-known digital currency: a \"silver\" to Bitcoin's \"digital gold.\" But the asset hasn't been successful at beating Bitcoin in terms of adoption and has fallen out of favor among investors in recent years. Until now, it seems.\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

Several other firms like WisdomTree and Invesco followed BlackRock in applying for a spot Bitcoin ETF, and on Tuesday, the Block reported that Fidelity would soon file for its own.\n\nLast week also saw nearly $200 million worth of inflows pour into digital asset investment products\u2014the highest weekly inflows in nearly a year, according to a report by CoinShares."

All top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded lower after MicroStrategy, the world\u2019s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, said Wednesday it has acquired 12,333 Bitcoin for $347 million over the past two months. Additionally, traditional financial institutions continue to show interest in venturing into the U.S. digital asset industry, with ARK Invest amending its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application to enhance the chance for regulatory approval.\n\nBitcoin, altcoins lose ground\n\nBitcoin dropped 1.57% to US$30,103 over the last 24 hours to 7:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is down 0.12% over the past seven days.\n\nEther fell 3.12% to US$1,827 for a loss of 3.51% for the week.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded lower. Cardano was the biggest loser among the top 10, logging a 6.49% 24-hour fall and a 6.65% weekly loss.\n\nOn Wednesday, business analytics firm MicroStrategy said in an exchange filing that between April 29 and June 27, the company and its subsidiaries together acquired roughly 12,333 Bitcoin for US$347 million in cash at an average price of US$28,136 per Bitcoin.\n\nThat purchase took its total Bitcoin holdings to 152,333 Bitcoin as of Tuesday, the company said.\n\nMeanwhile, on Wednesday, investment management fund ARK Invest filed an amendment to its April application for a spot Bitcoin ETF. The application \u2014 which would see the firm partner with crypto exchange-traded product provider 21Shares \u2014 now includes a proposed surveillance-sharing agreement.\n\nAs seen in the ETF application made by investment firm BlackRock earlier this month, an agreement of that kind is seen as a way to prevent market manipulation, increasing the application\u2019s chances of success.

According to Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News, that could potentially devalue the NFT industry as a whole.\n\n\u201cLenders are taking a hit on Azuki NFTs as the prices have fallen, borrowers default on loan, and then new owner immediately sells to recover what they can before the price falls even further,\u201d Petscher said. \u201cIt\u2019s a vicious cycle that has yet to find the bottom.\u201d\n\nThe floor price of Azuki Elementals dropped to 1.38 Ether (US$2,530) on Thursday morning in Asia from its mint price of 2 Ether, according to data from NFT tracker NFTpricefloor.com.

While BlackRock filed with Nasdaq, the other companies are working with Cboe.\n\nOn Friday, the SEC told some both Nasdaq and Cboe that their applications were \"inadequate\" because they didn't name the market that the fund sponsors are working with on their surveillance-sharing agreements, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn its refiled applications, Cboe said Coinbase's platform \"represents a substantial portion of U.S.-based and USD denominated Bitcoin trading\" as it named the U.S. crypto exchange as its partner for these surveillance-sharing agreements.\n\n\"The Spot BTC SSA [surveillance-sharing agreement] is expected to have the hallmarks of a surveillance-sharing agreement between two members of the ISG, which would give the Exchange supplemental access to data regarding spot Bitcoin trades occurring on Coinbase if the Exchange determines it is necessary as part of its surveillance program for the Commodity-Based Trust Shares in a manner similar to the way that exchanges share information as part of ISG,\" the filing said.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Tumbles on Report of SEC Saying Spot BTC ETF Filings Inadequate\n\nThe SEC has called for surveillance-sharing agreements with markets of \"significant size\" in the past, arguing that this is necessary to prevent market manipulation or other unwanted behaviors and protect consumers. The lack of these agreements figured heavily into many of the SEC's prior rejections of bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe regulator still has to formally acknowledge it is reviewing the applications. The SEC will kick off an initial 45-day review period when it publishes the filings in the Federal Register \u2013 the national logbook \u2013 but can extend this to a total of 240 days.\n\nComplicating the SEC's calculus may be the fact that it sued Coinbase earlier this month on allegations of operating an unregistered securities exchange, broker and clearinghouse \u2013 though the SEC is not alleging that Bitcoin itself is a security, and SEC Chair Gary Gensler has often referred to it as an example of a digital asset that is not a security.\n\nIt also remains to be seen whether the SEC will agree that Coinbase is a significant, regulated market for bitcoin.\n\nRead more: A Straightforward Explanation for Why Financial Giants Want to Issue a Spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nUPDATE (June 30, 2023, 20:55 UTC): Adds additional detail.\n\nUPDATE (June 30, 2023, 21:22 UTC): Updates to say Coinbase will be surveillance-sharing partner for all the spot bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nUPDATE (June 30, 2023, 21:50 UTC): Clarifies details."

        "title": "Volatility Shares unveils first US-listed leveraged bitcoin ETF - ETF Strategy",
        "content": "Volatility Shares has introduced the first ETF in the US providing leveraged exposure to bitcoin.\n\nThe 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX US) has been listed on Cboe BZX Exchange with an expense ratio of 1.85%.\n\nThe fund provides twice the daily performance of the S&P CME Bitcoin Futures Daily Roll Index which tracks the value of cash-settled, front-month bitcoin futures linked to the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate, an aggregate of bitcoin prices across multiple eligible cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nThe bitcoin futures contracts underlying the index are partially rolled into the following month on a daily basis.\n\nThe price of bitcoin has increased by roughly 85% year-to-date, from circa $16,500 at the end of 2022 to $30,600 on 29 June. This marks a notable turnaround for the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency which lost nearly 65% of its market value last year amid gloomy macroeconomic conditions, rapidly rising interest rates, and a host of negative crypto industry-related events such as the Terra Luna crash and the implosion of FTX, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange.\n\nAnalysts have attributed the current rally to a general weakening of the US dollar, a cooling of inflation, and the Federal Reserve slowing and most recently halting their interest rate hikes. A banking crisis that saw three small- to mid-size US banks fail over a week in March also helped to shine a light on the crypto industry\u2019s potential advantages over the traditional financial sector.\n\nVolatility Shares\u2019 introduction of a leveraged bitcoin ETF in the US enables sophisticated investors to amplify returns from further increases in the price of bitcoin. Leveraged ETFs do come with significant risks, however, which is why they are generally not suitable for a retail audience. Specifically, these funds are not appropriate as buy-and-hold investments as they tend to decay in value if held for an extended period of time, potentially leading to large losses, especially in volatile but range-bound markets.\n\nThe launch of BITX marks another milestone in the crypto industry\u2019s march into the mainstream. The US market is already home to inverse bitcoin ETFs as well as several ETFs providing traditional, unleveraged exposure to bitcoin.\n\nAll of the above funds deliver their exposure to bitcoin by way of futures contracts. While many issuers have sought to launch directly replicating bitcoin ETFs, the SEC has consistently refused to greenlight these applications, citing concerns regarding validating the ownership of these funds\u2019 underlying tokens.\n\nMany analysts have noted, however, that the SEC\u2019s stance may be softening, leading many big-name institutions including BlackRock and Fidelity to suddenly throw their hat into the ring and file for their own spot bitcoin ETFs."

Additionally, on Friday of the same week, the fund traded 500 million shares, something that has only happened five times since it was launched. The data also showed a shift in investors\u2019 behaviour where investments flowed from the Bitcoin cash market to the ETF market.\n\nBlackRock Leads the Pack\n\nThe situation was triggered when BlackRock submitted an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF on June 16. In the application, the leading global asset manager noted that it will use the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate to track the prices of Bitcoin. Several other asset managers followed, submitting similar applications to the regulator.\n\nIn a separate report, Finance Magnates reported that Invesco and WisdomTree sought similar regulatory approval to launch their spot Bitcoin ETFs. Based in Atlanta, Georgia, Invesco is an asset management company with Assets Under Management (AUM) worth $1.4 trillion. Initially, the company attempted to launch a spot bitcoin ETF in 2021 in partnership with Galaxy Digital but was unsuccessful.\n\nIn contrast, WisdomTree, one of the major ETF providers in the US with an AUM of $83 billion, plans to list an ETF dubbed WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust.

        "content": "Fidelity has joined other US companies to resubmit its application for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) called Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust. The asset management giant officially filed its paperwork for the spot Bitcoin ETF with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) yesterday (Thursday).\n\nA US Spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nThe application of Boston-headquartered Fidelity came only two weeks after its rival Blackrock filed for the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. Blackrock\u2019s application also encouraged other firms, including Invesco and WisdomTree, to seek the SEC\u2019s approval for the much-anticipated crypto investment instrument. Unlike Blackrock, all these companies filed for permission for a spot Bitcoin ETF, but their application was rejected.\n\nFidelity, a company with $4.5 trillion in assets under management (AUM), originally applied for its spot Bitcoin ETF in 2021 when the retail sentiment in the crypto market was high. However, the SEC rejected Fidility\u2019s application in 2022, which came a couple of months after Fidelity successfully launched a spot Bitcoin ETF in Canada.\n\nBringing Bitcoin to Mass Investors\n\nAn instrument like spot Bitcoin ETF will be listed on American stock exchanges, and retail investors can easily invest in the cryptocurrency from their brokerage accounts. It would eliminate the hassle of creating a separate crypto exchange account, setting up wallets, and other complex processes.\n\nKeep Reading South Africa Navigates Crypto Regulations: To License 60 Firms This Month\n\nIn the latest reapplication, Fidelity included a \u2018surveillance sharing agreement\u2019 with an unnamed US spot-based Bitcoin trading platform.

With over $10 trillion in AUM, BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the US. It has a significant influence in the financial services industry and also political backing, many media reports highlighted. Further, the market is optimistic about BlackRock\u2019s position, and speculations are mounting that its spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved. However, the SEC is yet to come up with anything official."

        "title": "Bitcoin To Explode by Up to 1,400% Amid Institutional Interest \u2013 Here\u2019s the Timeline: Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "Crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe is expressing bullish sentiment on Bitcoin (BTC) amid growing interest from institutional investors.\n\nVan de Poppe tells his 162,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin could rally by up to 15x in the run-up to the halvening and for several months after.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re most likely going to have a cycle that\u2019s comparable to 2015 to 2017, which also had a phase where a big group of people were jumping into the markets. And this time it\u2019s the next flow which is institutional investors, more retail coming in, and more governments jumping in. It\u2019s very likely that we\u2019re going to have that in this cycle.\n\nWe just gradually go up in terms of adoption, in terms of price growth, through which an expectation of Bitcoin to do a 10x, or maybe a 15x, is not strange to expect in this cycle. Especially since the market cap of crypto is around $1.2 trillion\u2026\u201d\n\nAccording to Van de Poppe, crypto assets are likely to mimic the dot-com stock market bubble of the late 1990s.\n\n\u201cThe dot-com bubble was approximately $10 to $15 trillion which also collapsed afterward as price and hype always starts to accelerate which inevitably will happen to crypto too\u2026\n\nYou can assume that this cycle will bring crypto to between $10 to $20 trillion and peak from there. And then have this slow gradual adoption taking place in slower cycles afterward.\u201d\n\nOver the short term, the crypto trader says that if Bitcoin were to undergo a correction, the pivot point would be around $42,000.\n\n\u201cThe next target is breaking these highs [around $40,000] and getting it towards $50,000 in the next round pre-halving. That is still a very likely case. It is also still a very likely case that altcoins can continue pushing.\n\nBut for this run, given that we are at this point [just above $30,000], it\u2019s still up for debate whether we\u2019re going to have a correction taking place. But I\u2019m marking $42,000 as the potential end of the run for this current rally of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies must reach mass adoption to unlock their maximum potential as a network technology and their value as financial assets.\n\nAs with other technologies, the adoption of crypto follows a classic bell curve: Starting from a small number of innovators, it grows as early adopters embrace it, moving into mass adoption as it expands to the early and late majority. Finally, it reaches those lagging behind in its final phase.\n\nSince its launch 14 years ago, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) adoption has dramatically increased. The cryptocurrency has gone from being a fringe technology discussed by a small group of cypherpunks and nerds to being known worldwide, with some nation-states even adopting it as legal tender.\n\nAccording to most estimates, though, crypto\u2019s global adoption rate is still in the single digits, which means it still remains in the \u201cearly majority\u201d phase of global adoption.\n\nTo grow further and reach true mass adoption, crypto will need to overcome the \u201cchasm\u201d \u2014 the gap separating the early adopters from the early majority. To do so, certain catalysts may be required.\n\nWhat are those catalysts, and how far is crypto from reaching mass adoption?

        "title": "Fidelity Joins Spot-Bitcoin ETF Race With Fresh SEC Filing - FA Mag",
        "content": "June 29, 2023\n\nFidelity Investments is the latest financial services heavyweight to throw its name into the race to offer the first US exchange-traded fund investing directly in Bitcoin.\n\nThe Boston-based asset manager, which has about $11 trillion in assets under administration and has tens of millions of customers, re-filed for the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, according to a document submitted Thursday with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Similar to previous US spot Bitcoin ETF filings in the past few weeks, the updated application says that Fidelity expects to enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement with a US cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest high-profile traditional-finance firm to join the race after BlackRock Inc. made a splash with its June 15 application for a spot ETF, which opened the floodgates for others to try their hand at it, as well. For crypto fans, it\u2019s been a significant string of developments given BlackRock\u2019s reputation on Wall Street, and the view by some market-watchers that the asset manager wouldn\u2019t be making an attempt were it not confident it could get regulatory approval.\n\nThere have been about 30 tries for a spot-Bitcoin product, according to a tally from Bloomberg Intelligence. But applications have faced opposition by regulators, who have in the past cited market concerns and a lack of investor protections, among other things. Fidelity originally filed for the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust in 2021, which was denied by the SEC in January 2022, according to a Fidelity spokesperson.\n\nEven so, BlackRock\u2019s move spurred a number of similar filings from other issuers, including by Invesco Ltd., WisdomTree, Valkyrie and Bitwise. Meanwhile, Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Investment Management has said that it believes it could be first in line to get any potential regulatory approval. ARK had in April, in conjunction with crypto-issuer 21Shares, re-filed its application for one.\n\nFans of digital assets are excited about the prospect of crypto potentially becoming more easily accessible to everyday investors, and the wave of filings has been a boon for token prices. Bitcoin jumped back above $30,000 in June and is trading at its highest levels in about a year. The token on Thursday traded around $30,500. That\u2019s still less than half the record of almost $69,000 reached in November 2021.\n\nTo be sure, this isn\u2019t the first hype-cycle over a potential launch. Crypto fans, who have been yearning for a spot-Bitcoin ETF for years, have been through periods of excitement before, only for regulators to ultimately rebuff all attempts.\n\nWhile BlackRock\u2019s filing was credited by observers for helping to push the price of Bitcoin to a one-year high last week, the market reaction to the Fidelity refiling was fairly muted. Bitcoin was up about 1.5% to $30,500 as of 2:25 p.m. in New York, though off the highest level of the day.\n\n--With assistance from Tom Maloney.\n\nThis article was provided by Bloomberg News."

That\u2019s one downside I see of institutional involvement if a manager of BlackRock\u2019s scale, balance sheet, or funds under management is treating this as another investible asset class,\u201d Mr Bishop said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe think of bitcoin as digital gold and ethereum as digital oil. Bitcoin is not programmable like ethereum, but it\u2019s exceptionally good at doing its job, which is value transfer in a hyper, hyper-secure way. But that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nThe institutional adoption of bitcoin widens its divergence from its original conception as a decentralised, apolitical cryptocurrency first adopted in a counter-culture world, where value could be transferred free from political or commercial control, Mr Bishop added. \u201cA lot of the decentralised maxis will be appalled by this [BlackRock\u2019s] involvement, and we have conversations often with some early adopters, but it\u2019s hypocritical to say this technology is the best in the world, and then to decry the involvement of these institutions. You can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d he said.\n\nProfessional investors, asset managers and traders remain uncertain how to value bitcoin or predict its future direction. Some claim it is a Ponzi scheme as it has no intrinsic value, while others like Ms Wood boast their analysis shows it could reach $US1 million by 2030.\n\nMr Bishop said the correlation between bitcoin and other risk assets will be strengthened if BlackRock and other traditional finance powerhouses launch ETFs.\n\n\u201cBitcoin doesn\u2019t offer an equity ownership stake and when you buy bitcoin you\u2019re not exposing yourself to any one operating or business model, or margin stream,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one potential downside [from institutional promotion] that it gets cemented into a bucket of other digital risk assets.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin Mining Boom Continues in Texas as State Shatters Energy Records - WhoWhatWhy",
        "content": "The Texas Lege\u2019s failure to restrain incentivized energy-demanding bitcoin mining in Texas means the industry will continue to expand alongside record-setting grid strain.\n\nListen To This Story\n\nThis story by Paul Krantz was originally published by Deceleration and is part of Covering Climate Now, a global journalism collaboration strengthening coverage of the climate story.\n\n\u2022\n\nAll is not well in rural Corsicana, Texas. The city and surrounding county have fallen into a state of disrepair, according to local resident Jackie Sawicky.\n\n\u201cOur roads are terrible, this week we were having brownouts, and as of this minute, my water is out,\u201d Sawicky told Deceleration. \u201cOur infrastructure is absolutely on the brink of failure \u2026 and what are they doing? They\u2019re going to bring in the world\u2019s largest bitcoin mine.\u201d\n\nA recent report from the American Society of Civil Engineers supports Sawicky\u2019s observations, grading Texas overall with barely passing marks for the state of its roadways, wastewater systems, and levees and dams.\n\nConcerned about social and environmental impacts, Sawicky founded the Texas Coalition Against Bitcoin Mining and launched an online petition warning about noise pollution, rising water and energy costs, and more. At the time of this writing, it has garnered 1,180 signatures from residents opposing what is expected to be the state\u2019s largest bitcoin mine to date.\n\n\u201cWe do not want the increase in environmental temperature in the immediate vicinity of the factory-that-produces-nothing,\u201d the petition reads.\n\nFaced with escalating extreme weather due to climate change, Texas needs to upgrade infrastructure and transition away from fossil fuel use. The urgency of this need was felt keenly in 2021 when winter storm Uri cut power to millions across Texas for days on end and claimed hundreds of lives. Yet efforts intended to make the state more energy efficient withered during the last session of the Texas Legislature as lobbyists for environmental and traditional energy interests spent much of the session playing defense against bills seeking to kill renewable power and directing billions of dollars of tax revenue toward new, unnecessary gas-fueled power plants (See: \u201cGarbage In, Garbage Out\u201d).\n\nAs the state struggles to keep up with the energy demands driven by rapid population growth and rising temperatures, bitcoin mining continues to add further demand to the system, encouraged along by elected Republican leadership.\n\nPower Use\n\nAccording to a report by the Energy Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the state\u2019s electric grid manager, crypto mining consumed more than 3,300 Gigawatt/hours of Texas grid energy in 2022, more than double the amount used 2021.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s total energy consumption in Texas is only increasing. Further mining projects amounting to 39 gigawatts in demand are proposed by 2027, with at least 2.5 gigawatts already approved and 6 gigawatts more that have met planning requirements.\n\nThe daily energy demand for all of Texas is currently about 80 gigawatts.\n\nIf only the bitcoin projects that have already met planning requirements are approved, mining for digital currencies could increase energy demand on the grid by 10 percent within four years.\n\nA statement released by the grid manager said, \u201cERCOT will not allow the interconnection of load that would be expected to result in any violation of reliability criteria.\u201d\n\nAs opposed to other energy-intensive industries, none of these projects offer tangible value to most Texas residents.\n\nRiot Platforms (formerly Riot Blockchain), is the company planning to bring an industrial bitcoin mine to Corsicana, potentially \u201cthe first one gigawatt load ever approved by ERCOT.\u201d Riot already operates a 450-megawatt facility near Rockdale, Texas, reportedly the largest single bitcoin mine in North America. One megawatt of electricity powers about 200 Texas homes during periods of peak demand, according to ERCOT. So Riot\u2019s new gigawatt plant, at peak capacity, could consume as much power as 200,000 Texas homes.\n\nRiot failed to respond to requests for comment from Deceleration.\n\nTo \u201cmine\u201d bitcoin, computers solve complex math equations (up to trillions per second) to identify a series of numbers that validates the next block on the blockchain. A miner is rewarded for solving the block with bitcoin currency. Due to the ever-increasing difficulty of solving these equations, the amount of energy required to power the network has exploded to exorbitant levels.\n\nThe Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) monitors bitcoin\u2019s global electricity demand. At time of writing, it estimates that the global bitcoin network is using 144 terra-watt hours (TWh) annually. To put that number in perspective, gold mining is estimated to use 131 TWh worldwide and data centers were estimated to use 200 TWh as of 2018. The CBECI\u2019s estimates that the bitcoin network currently pollutes more than the country of Austria, about 71.5 million tons of CO2 per year.\n\nThe New York Times found that the two bitcoin mines in Rockdale consume more energy than all of the homes in a 40-mile radius.\n\nBitcoin advocates highlight projects powered by renewable energy, such as one of Marathon Digital Holding\u2019s mines near McCamey, Texas, which draws power from a wind farm. But many mining projects draw electricity directly from the grid, a mix of power sources that averages out to include roughly 60 percent of electrons derived from combusting coal and gas; still others are directly attached to fossil fuel power plants. Before constructing the mine in McCamey, Marathon cut a deal with a coal plant that was due to close and kept it operating for months longer.\n\nBeside energy, water is also a crucial resource for crypto mining. It\u2019s needed to cool the computers, and in a hot Texas summer that can amount to millions of gallons per day. Navarro Mills Lake, which is to be the primary source for Riot\u2019s planned facility, was in stage one drought this January and stressed in recent years.\n\n\u201cLast year, a record number of cattle ranchers had to sell their herds early because the drought was so bad that it was spiking the cost of hay and they couldn\u2019t afford to feed their cattle,\u201d Sawicky said.\n\nCorsicana residents will also be subjected to the unending drone of thousands of mining computers buzzing. The sound of one mine built in a rural town has been described as \u201ca small jet that never leaves.\u201d\n\n\u2018Freedom Money\u2019\n\nPierre Rochard, vice president of research at Riot Platforms, told members of the Texas Senate Committee on Business and Commerce that bitcoin brings jobs to Texas, and called bitcoin \u201cfreedom money.\u201d\n\nLee Bratcher, president of the bitcoin lobbying group Texas Blockchain Council, said in the same hearing that bitcoin miners in Texas employ around 2,000 ongoing employees, and have employed around 20,000 contractors. Out of nearly 15 million workers in Texas, those are not big numbers. Once bitcoin mining centers are built, they require a very slim workforce to maintain. Bratcher also declined to comment for this article.\n\nERCOT classifies bitcoin mines as \u201clarge flexible loads,\u201d because they draw a lot of power and are able to power down or reduce their energy use quickly. Bigger bitcoin mines typically have a curtailment clause in their energy contracts with ERCOT, meaning they agree to power down during moments of emergency energy demand.\n\nBitcoin miners have a business incentive to power down when demand spikes and energy prices go up, but by participating in \u201cresponsive reserve service\u201d with ERCOT, miners collect energy credits for energy they don\u2019t use.\n\nRiot, for instance, reported $9.5 million in energy credits from the state last July for powering down during a heatwave, and a total of $27.3 million in energy credit payouts that year, according to a recent earnings report.\n\nRecently, the proposed Texas Senate Bill 1751, sponsored by state senators Kolkhorst, Campbell, and Nichols aimed to stop bitcoin miners from gaining ERCOT energy credits. The bill passed the Senate, but failed to make it to the voting floor of the House.\n\nThe bill\u2019s sponsors said it was not a punitive measure, but meant to eliminate unnecessary incentives for a rapidly growing industry. Bitcoin miners celebrated the death of what they called the \u201canti-mining\u201d bill when they learned it would not make it to the Governor\u2019s desk.\n\nCan Bitcoin Be Tamed?\n\nThe too often ignored reality of mitigating climate change is that humankind needs to reduce energy and resource use overall. To merely swap today\u2019s fossil power for a renewable grid would lead to further constraints and environmentally devastating impacts. The challenge is in maintaining good living standards while reducing energy demand. Doing so requires rethinking virtually every aspect of society, including \u201clow-energy housing, widespread public transport, and diets low in animal-based foods,\u201d one recent assessment found. It\u2019s safe to say that bitcoin\u2019s terawatts don\u2019t fit within the proposed framework.\n\nEven for those who believe in the importance of alternatives to fiat currency, there are options besides bitcoin with a significantly lower energy impact. The second most popular cryptocurrency, Ethereum, cut network greenhouse gas emissions 99 percent last year by switching from a proof-of-work algorithm to proof-of-stake. Proof-of-stake is an alternative model for maintaining a cryptocurrency that doesn\u2019t require mining.\n\nTake a bird's-eye view of our #Bitcoin mining operations in McCamey, TX. This is one of the four quadrants that make up the site. In total, there are over 60,000 miners at the site, working together to secure the Bitcoin network. pic.twitter.com/jIUZrRCbYv \u2014 Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA) (@MarathonDH) April 25, 2023\n\nEnergy and water commitments now being captured by bitcoin could edge out alternative projects more capable of helping Texas navigate the energy transition, like green hydrogen fuel production, in the years ahead.\n\n\u201cElectrolyzers \u2026 store energy in the form of hydrogen that can then be used for other applications, such as transport, industrial uses, or more simply to reuse it for power plants,\u201d Olivier Beaufils, Market Lead for ERCOT at Aurora Energy Research, told Deceleration.\n\n\u201cA lot of these hydrogen projects are still in early stages,\u201d Beaufils said, noting that competition with other users hasn\u2019t manifested yet. \u201cNow three to five years ahead, that might be a different story.\u201d\n\nCharlie Schumacher, Marathon\u2019s corporate communications VP, said that bitcoin miners help rural renewables stay profitable and \u201csoak up\u201d electricity that may not reach users otherwise. But Adrian Shelley, Texas director of the advocacy organization Public Citizen, contends that bitcoin mining is not a viable solution to transmission issues.\n\n\u201cYou may have a glut of wind energy over here that, within a couple of years, ERCOT sees and invests in transmission that brings more of it to people where it\u2019s needed,\u201d Shelley said. \u201cBut if you mine bitcoin, ERCOT will never see that constraint, and is never going to make the investment.\u201d\n\nMolly White, who has a Harvard University fellowship to research crypto and publishes a blog called Web3 is Going Just Great, cautions against taking pro-bitcoin claims at face value.\n\n\u201cBitcoin miners\u2019 claims are pretty nakedly self-serving,\u201d White told Deceleration. She added that the more computers mine bitcoin, the more difficult mining becomes, increasing power use for the network overall. \u201cSo even [miners] using so-called waste energy from renewables are still contributing to the overall energy footprint of Bitcoin \u2026 much of which is not renewable.\u201d\n\nHow ERCOT and political leaders prioritize these projects will have a tremendous impact on the state\u2019s energy grid.\n\nBut for now, a pro-bitcoin lobby has gained influence in Texas. Governor Gregory Abbott has previously hosted the Texas Blockchain Council at the governor\u2019s mansion, and Senator Ted Cruz has openly supported the currency. Also, former interim president and CEO of ERCOT, Brad Jones, became the first member of Riot\u2019s advisory board this year.\n\nTexas\u2019s 88th legislative session confirmed that the state\u2019s bitcoin mining industry will continue to be propped up by incentives. Three bills that passed are being celebrated by bitcoin miners, including HB 591 which will introduce tax incentives for powering crypto mining with flared gas.\n\nIn adding further tax incentives, and failing to cut existing ones, the state legislature appears to have sent a clear signal that Texas is open for bitcoin business, and the expanding peak energy demands that it entails.\n\nWhile bitcoin miners continue to profit from access to cheap energy and tax breaks, residents of communities across Texas will continue to experience increasing energy bills and the continued risk of power outages in yet another summer of record-breaking energy demands.\n\n\u201cWhen I go grocery shopping, I ask people, \u2018Have you heard about the bitcoin mine?\u2019\u201d said Jackie Sawicky. \u201cI have talked to hundreds of people in Corsicana and Navarro County, and I can count on both hands the people who have shown positive favor.\u201d\n\nFor the residents of Corsicana, it looks like a very noisy, thirsty, and power-hungry neighbor is coming to town."

        "title": "Bitcoin SV (BSV) Doubles in Value, Rocketes Up 55% - Crypto Times",
        "content": "On Friday, the cryptocurrency market as a whole is experiencing a rise in prices. This is mainly due to two major cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, making significant gains. Bitcoin has gone up by 3.1% and is now valued above $31,000, while Ethereum has increased by 3.4% and reached $1,900. Taking advantage of this positive trend, Bitcoin SV (BSV) has also joined the rally and surged by nearly 15%.\n\nIn 2018, Bitcoin SV (BSV) split from Bitcoin Cash (BCH), creating its own path. Now, BSV has become a significant player alongside Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Surprisingly, within just eight days, BSV\u2019s value doubled from a low of $27 on June 23rd and managed to recover over 55%, reaching $43.\n\nAs of now, the price of Bitcoin SV (BSV) is $42.2, and it has gained 14% in value overnight. However, the market capitalization of BSV has increased and is now in the range of $814 million, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nBitcoin SV\u2019s Resistance Test: Opportunity or Caution?\n\nThe price of Bitcoin SV (BSV) is currently trading well above the falling parallel channel, which is a positive sign. However, in mid-May, buyers got caught when the price broke out of this downward channel, leading to a significant sell-off.\n\nNow, BSV is approaching its highest point in June, which was $45. In order for the price to reach $50, the buyers need to push it past the key resistance range (represented by the red zone).\n\nThe trading volume for Bitcoin SV (BSV) has increased by 100% in the last 24 hours, reaching $136 million. However, it is still relatively low compared to the trading session on June 24th.\n\nAfter a period of 45 days, the bulls have managed to keep Bitcoin SV (BSV) above the 200-day simple moving average, creating a positive atmosphere. Now, the important moving averages such as EMS 20, 50, 100, and 200 have all turned into support levels. Additionally, the RSI indicator is approaching an extremely overbought region."

        "content": "June 30, 2023 01:21 pm | Updated 01:58 pm IST - Bengaluru\n\nBengaluru\n\nA 39-year-old businessman lost over \u20b952 lakh after participating in a cryptocurrency exchange task. He pledged gold, withdrew a fixed deposit, used business overdraft and borrowed money from friends to pay the fraudsters. An FIR was registered at South East CEN Crime Police Station.\n\nNalagani Gururaju runs two hair salons at Electronics City in Bengaluru. On May 29, an unknown person [phone number +1(6292742279)]contacted him on WhatsApp and asked him to take up a part-time job subscribing to YouTube channels. Gururaju was promised \u20b950 each for subscribing to multiple YouTube channels. Gururaju subscribed to three channels after clicking on the links sent by the unknown person. He received \u20b9150 in his bank account.\n\nLater, he was added to a Telegram group which included four members who were talking about crypto tasks. An admin of the group sent details of various packages to invest money in buying and selling Bitcoins (BTC).\n\nMembers were sending several messages and photos. The text on one photo shared on the group stated: Real Time Task Availability \u2014 Pay \u20b930,000 and withdraw \u20b943,500, or pay \u20b99,69,000 and withdraw \u20b913,08,150, or pay \u20b96,28,000 and withdraw \u20b99,10,600.\n\nGururaju was told to open an account on a website to transact in Bitcoins. The website was similar to that of a popular crypto exchange site bitFlyer.\n\n\u201cIn the Telegram group, other members were sharing screenshots of money received in their account. This made me confident about going ahead with the tasks,\u201d he told The Hindu.\n\nOnce Gururaju expressed an interest to trade, he was told to transfer money to various account numbers. He sent money to 7 different accounts. The fraudsters, who were posing as BTC brokers, claimed to be trading the coins he had bought, and that the same was reflected in the account (crypto wallet), which he had opened on their website.\n\nGururaju had transferred \u20b952 lakh to the accounts. As per his crypto account, he had a total of over \u20b965 lakh after including the profit. But, although Gururaju could see profits growing in the account, he did not have the option to withdraw the money.\n\nWhen he asked the admin of the Telegram group to allow him to withdraw the money, the admin claimed that he could withdraw his money if he paid tax on the same. Other members in the Telegram group posted messages saying that this is the rule of the company.\n\nGururaju entered into a personal chat with the admin and requested return of his money. The admin allegedly admitted that the whole scheme was a fraud and told him to pay \u20b93 lakh more to join the group, and become a partner. The admin claimed that they work from Mumbai.\n\nGururaju is now bankrupt. He does not have money even to pay the salaries of his salon staff.\n\nHe approached the bank with his complaint. The bank was unable to recover the money transferred by Gururaju to the accounts of the fraudsters, which had been opened in private banks in Delhi, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha."
