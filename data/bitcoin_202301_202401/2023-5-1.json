        "title": "Invest in Bitcoin? I'm a Bitcoin Loser and I Won't Be Going Near It Again - Kiplinger's Personal Finance",
        "content": "Should you invest in Bitcoin is a common question posed by many who have witnessed the cryptocurrency\u2019s rollercoaster ride over recent years.\n\nEach Bitcoin is now worth about $30,000 after a year of gains for the cryptocurrency, but the last five years have seen it swing from $3,000 to $65,000, which shows the seesaw it\u2019s been on. That has led not just to a surge in Bitcoin investing but also in Bitcoin mining .\n\nI have tried my luck at it, albeit with rather small sums compared to some, but it taught me that seeing it as an investment is the wrong course of action for most. Unless you really, really know what you are doing, then it\u2019s a gamble, akin to playing the tables in Vegas.\n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance Be a smarter, better informed investor.

Sign up\n\nThat means it really should be viewed as something only to dabble in if you can afford to lose that cash, so something to have fun with rather than truly invest in. That\u2019s my view, and you may disagree, but here\u2019s why I think so.\n\nWhy Bitcoin is closer to gambling than investing\n\nWhen you invest in the stock market or in commodities you can at least do some research to help inform your decision. How has this fund manager performed? What is this company\u2019s growth plans? Or, what do experts think will happen to the price of gold?\n\nThese are all questions you can answer using research to help inform you of potential outcomes. You can also get financial advice from experts who know the markets and the system.\n\nOf course, most investors know that there is always the risk of their investment tanking due to big world events such as COVID-19, or due to more localized or company-specific issues.\n\nYet few stocks or commodities have experienced the white-knuckle ride of Bitcoin, and that propensity for it to move suddenly, sometimes seemingly with no warning, is why it is so much harder to predict, and why it is closer to gambling than investing in my view.\n\nOne reason Bitcoin is hard to predict is because the mechanics behind it are so complex that most people don\u2019t understand them and therefore don\u2019t have the same knowledge they have of more traditional investments.\n\nI suspect die-hard crypto experts who do nothing but study Bitcoin and other similar currencies such as Ethereum will disagree with me, but this article isn\u2019t aimed at them, but at the less-well-informed majority.\n\nMy Bitcoin loss\n\nA few years ago when everyone seemed to be talking Bitcoin up during one of its highs, I bought $300 of it. I saw it rise to about $500, then drop suddenly, only to go back up again.\n\nAfter a few months later, I withdrew it all at a loss of $50. I could swallow a $50 hit and I saw the experience as a bit of fun to see what would happen to the $300.\n\nThe problem is, I had no idea why it was going up or down and saw no way to even remotely forecast which way it would go. I didn\u2019t like the feeling that I had no control at all.\n\nDon\u2019t get into Bitcoin unless you understand the risks\n\nBitcoin is having a good 2023, with its value up 75% year-to-date. That may encourage some people to try their luck.\n\nI say go for it if you want to have some fun, but only with money you can afford to lose, unless you really consider yourself a cryptocurrency expert.\n\nBut please beware the many companies out there trying to sell you a Bitcoin \u201cinvestment\u201d as a sure-fire way to make money. You may get lucky but you may as easily get burnt.\n\nWhether you agree or disagree, feel free to tweet me @guyanker."

        "title": "The DAME Tax: Making Cryptominers Pay for Costs They Impose on Others | CEA - The White House",
        "content": "Last month, the President released his Budget for Fiscal Year 2024, building on progress over the past two years to make critical investments to grow the economy, lower costs for families, protect and strengthen Medicare and Social Security, and reduce the deficit.\n\nOne new proposal in this year\u2019s Budget, the Digital Asset Mining Energy (DAME) excise tax, is an example of the President\u2019s commitment to addressing both long-standing national challenges as well as emerging risks \u2013 in this case, the economic and environmental costs of current practices for mining crypto assets (cryptomining, for short). After a phase-in period, firms would face a tax equal to 30 percent of the cost of the electricity they use in cryptomining.\n\nCryptomining is a process for validating transactions among holders of crypto assets to record and transfer cryptographically secured assets on a distributed ledger by, for example, using computing equipment to perform calculations to select the validator (White House 2022). Currently, cryptomining firms do not have to pay for the full cost they impose on others, in the form of local environmental pollution, higher energy prices, and the impacts of increased greenhouse gas emissions on the climate. The DAME tax encourages firms to start taking better account of the harms they impose on society.\n\nWhile crypto assets are virtual, the energy consumption tied to their computationally intensive production is very real and imposes very real costs, as highlighted in a chapter of this year\u2019s Economic Report of the President (entitled \u201cDigital Assets: Relearning Economic Principles\u201d). Recent reporting by the New York Times highlighted the scale of the power consumption associated with 34 of the largest cryptomining operations, which they calculated as equal to the power used by the surrounding 3 million homes. As shown in Figure 1, the amount of electricity used in cryptomining in the United States in 2022 was similar to what is used to power all the country\u2019s home computers or residential lighting.\n\nFigure 1: U.S. Residential and Cryptomining Electricity Usage (in Billions of kilowatt hours in 2022)\n\nCryptominers\u2019 high energy consumption has negative spillovers on the environment, quality of life, and electricity grids where these firms locate across the country (OSTP 2022). Pollution from electricity generation falls disproportionately on low-income neighborhoods and communities of color (Thind et al. 2019). Cryptominers\u2019 intensive and often volatile power consumption also can push up electricity prices for consumers and can increase risks for local electrical grids\u2014straining equipment, causing service interruptions and safety hazards (Chelan County 2018). Yet because cryptomining is geographically mobile and the stability of the business model remains unclear, local utilities also face financial risks if they invest in upgrading capacity that may not be needed if mining activity ceases or moves away.\n\nThe environmental impacts of cryptomining exist even when miners use existing clean power. For example, in the case of communities with hydropower where cryptomining operations are often located, increased electricity consumption by cryptominers reduces the amount of clean power available for other uses, raising prices and increasing overall reliance on dirtier sources of electricity.\n\nAlongside these known costs and risks, cryptomining does not generate the local and national economic benefits typically associated with businesses using similar amounts of electricity. Instead, the energy is used to generate digital assets whose broader social benefits have yet to materialize, as elaborated in the Economic Report of the President. There is little evidence of benefits to local communities in the form of employment or economic opportunity, and research has found that minor increases in local tax revenue are more than offset by increased energy prices for firms and households (Benneton, Compiani, and Morse 2021).\n\nAlthough the potential for cryptomining to relocate abroad\u2014such as to areas with dirtier energy production\u2014is a concern, other countries are also increasingly moving to restrict crypto asset mining. China banned such activity completely in 2021, as have eight other countries; three Canadian provinces also have announced or enacted cryptomining moratoriums. Similarly, some U.S. States and localities are now charging higher electricity prices for or restricting the activity.\n\nTo ensure that cryptomining is not simply pushed from one local community to another, a national policy is needed. Of course, the DAME tax is not a panacea\u2014it is only one example of the Administration\u2019s efforts to fight climate change, reduce energy prices, and increase access to electrified options for all Americans. Similarly, it is just one example of the President\u2019s larger efforts to ensure the responsible development of digital assets, modernize their tax treatment, and mitigate risks to financial stability. Estimated to raise $3.5 billion in revenue over 10 years, the primary goal of the DAME tax is to start having cryptominers pay their fair share of the costs imposed on local communities and the environment."

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies took a dip on Monday to start the week and new month as investors bet the takeover of First Republic Bank could put an end to the financial crisis, which has been the biggest driver of this year's bitcoin rally.\n\nBitcoin fell about 4.2% to 28,137.76 to start the week and new month, according to Coin Metrics. Ether lost 4% to 1,828.81.\n\nOn Monday regulators took possession of First Republic, making it the third U.S. bank failure this year and the biggest one since the 2008 financial crisis. JPMorgan Chase will acquire most of its deposits and assets.\n\nLast week, the price of bitcoin rallied in the final week of April as troubles at the bank unfolded. Trading of the cryptocurrency has been choppy, however, as investors straddle the effects of the banking crisis on crypto with high inflation, Federal Reserve policy, a potential recession and an increasingly bearish narrative building around the U.S. dollar.\n\n\"It's unclear whether the banking crisis narrative can continue to be a boon for bitcoin,\" said Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy. \"Overall, the market lacks clear positive near-term catalysts, with supply issues overhanging bitcoin \u2026 That being said, bitcoin accumulation by small addresses is outpacing issuance, and we expect Ethereum staking to increase, each of which provides a supportive supply narrative.\"\n\n\"Outside of crypto-native factors, we expect a back-of-the-year macro environment to be characterized by tightening, recession, and an expanding multipolarity in the global economy, all of which can be supportive of gold and bitcoin,\" he added.\n\nInvestors have been expecting a slowdown from bitcoin's first-quarter rally, although cryptocurrency remains on its upward trend and has gained about 70% for the year, after finishing down more than 60%. April marked the first time in two years that bitcoin notched a fourth consecutive positive month.\n\n\"Bitcoin and ether started 2023 inorganically cheap, allowing for plenty of room to move higher off a low-base effect,\" Thorn said. \"A widening banking crisis became evident in March and the contrast with Bitcoin's transparent and decentralized nature provided a further leg up for bitcoin, while Ethereum's successful Shanghai upgrade provided a catalyst for ethereum.\""

        "title": "$194 Million was Moved Using Bitcoin With $0.1 Fee, Potential of Crypto - CCN.com",
        "content": "On October 16, a Bitcoin user moved 29,999 BTC worth $194 million with a $0.1 fee, a transaction which with banks would cost tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nAn often pushed narrative against cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum is that it is expensive to clear transactions due to fees sent to miners. However, the $194 million payment on the Bitcoin blockchain demonstrates the potential of consensus currencies to optimize cross-border payments significantly.\n\n$1 Million Through a Bank Costs $10,000+\n\nTransferwise is a UK-based multi-billion dollar firm that eliminates hidden fees in bank transfers. On the platform, users can send small to large payments through bank accounts with substantially lower fees.\n\nHowever, even on a platform like Transferwise, to send over $1 million, it costs over $7,500 in transaction fees. That means, through wire transfers and conventional banking methods, tens of thousands of dollars are required to clear a transaction that is larger than $1 million.\n\nPercentage-wise, $7,500 is less than 1 percent of $1 million, and in that sense, a $7,500 fee is cheap. But, on the Bitcoin network, which is supposedly highly inefficient in processing payments, it costs less than $0.1 to clear a $194 million transaction.\n\nOn October 14, publicly acclaimed cryptocurrency critic Nouriel Roubini, an economist and professor at Stern School, claimed that it costs $60 to process a Bitcoin transaction and as such, it costs $63 to purchase a Starbucks latte that costs $3, using Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cSo the cost per transaction of bitcoin is literally $60. So if I were to buy a $3 latte at Starbucks I would have to pay $63 to get it! So the myth of a \u2018Brilliant new technology that reduces the vast fees of legacy financial systems!\u2019 turns out to be a Big Fat Lie!\u201d Nouriel claimed.\n\nIn response, respected cryptocurrency investor and Blocktower co-founder Ari Paul stated that the transaction fee of Bitcoin, which is less than $0.1, is publicly verifiable on the blockchain.\n\n\u201cBTC fees are less than $0.10, easily verifiable. If you value truth, you\u2019d provide a public correction. If your goal is to mislead people with simply false statements, carry on. There\u2019s nothing to research. Fees are publicly viewable from many sources (googling it works.) I find it better not to provide a specific source because then regardless of source, the source gets attacked,\u201d Paul noted.\n\nCrypto Could Crack Offshore Banking Market First\n\nAs the scalability of public blockchain networks improves with the integration of both on-chain and second-layer scaling solutions, cryptocurrencies will be able to handle small payments with higher efficiency.\n\nBut, in the mid-term, given the ability of the blockchain to process large-scale payments at the same cost of a small transaction, it is highly likely that cryptocurrencies will gain wide acceptance by investors and firms in the offshore banking market, a $30 trillion industry that relies on financial institutions to clear large transactions.\n\nSpending $0.1 to $1 for a $5 to $10 transaction could be inefficient and impractical. However, spending the same fee to process multi-million dollar transactions provide cryptocurrencies a clear edge over legacy systems.\n\nCrypto\u2019s Effect on Other Markets\n\nWith the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies, several industries face drastic changes. Let\u2019s look at gambling as an example: Crypto gambling platforms have emerged to cater to the growing demand for more secure and anonymous forms of gambling.\n\nThese crypto casinos offer a wide range of games, like crypto slots, crypto plinko, and crash gambling that can be played using digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others. The use of cryptocurrencies in gambling provides several benefits, and one of those is the previously mentioned low transaction fee.\n\nImages from Shutterstock"

        "title": "Crypto foes gird to stop mines from 'spreading like cancer' - E&E News by POLITICO",
        "content": "In the wake of a national surge in crypto mining, local activists are searching for ways to fight the energy-intensive industry\u2019s rapid growth \u2014 and calling on Congress for backup.\n\nCrypto mines \u2014 banks of computers that run to obtain digital currency \u2014 can operate as much as 24 hours per day, seven days a week and, depending on their energy source, can spew significant levels of planet-warming gases.\n\nAfter China cracked down on crypto mining within its borders a year and a half ago, the industry has become a growing presence in communities with cheap electricity from hydropower \u2014 and also from more carbon-intensive sources like natural gas and coal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese miners are moving to the United States and spreading like cancer across the country,\u201d said Yvonne Taylor, one of the founders of the National Coalition Against Cryptomining, a new advocacy group uniting activists from Georgia to Washington state.\n\nShe added: \u201cWe had to do something on a national level.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, before China\u2019s crackdown on crypto mining, the United States accounted for just 3.5 percent of global mining of bitcoin, the leading type of cryptocurrency.\n\nBy 2022, that figure had jumped to 38 percent, and the United States is now home to a third of global crypto mining assets, according to a report from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP).\n\nThe crypto boom has led to a tripling of energy usage since 2021 \u2014 matching the amount of power needed to turn on the lights in every home in the United States.\n\nCrypto mining uses so much energy because banks of small computers are competing to solve complex math puzzles to win digital currency. The more computers running, the better the odds of making a profit.\n\nThat energy consumption is still under 2 percent of total U.S. electricity use, but the White House report warned that crypto\u2019s boom-and-bust cycles could continue to strain the grid just as the nation is aiming to slash emissions from the power sector.\n\nFor climate activists who find themselves living near a crypto mine, the lack of U.S. law governing the industry is a critical challenge. Communities cannot get a clear picture of where the facilities are located, and estimates of the sites\u2019 cumulative climate impact is uncertain.\n\nIn some places, crypto mining opponents warn that the facilities are bringing fossil fuel power plants back online or delaying their retirement. In other cases, critics say the facilities are draining so much power from renewable sources like hydroelectric dams that residents are not able to take advantage of those sources and are instead getting energy derived from fossil fuels.\n\nThe disruptions reach beyond climate impacts: People living near the facilities say the mines also require noisy fans and massive amounts of water to keep their servers cool.\n\nIn the absence of federal crypto mining laws, people living near the sites are taking a multipronged approach to fighting the facilities. Their options are driven by local and state regulation and range from changing or enforcing zoning codes to hiking energy costs for the mines.\n\nWhile opponents aren\u2019t immediately removing the facilities, they are laying the groundwork for future legal challenges against crypto mining.\n\nCrypto mining pollution has drawn the attention of some lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, reintroduced legislation in February aimed at collecting nationwide data on the industry\u2019s environmental impacts.\n\nPassage of the \u201cCrypto Asset Environmental Transparency Act\u201d would allow the federal government to collect data necessary for it to potentially establish efficiency standards for the industry, like those that currently exist for everything from air conditioners to automobiles. Failure to comply with efficiency standards, in turn, could provide grounds for litigation from crypto mining opponents.\n\n\u201cThis is an emergency, an urgent issue, and Congress needs to be proactive,\u201d Markey said in a recent congressional hearing.\n\nFederal action is crucial, Taylor said.\n\n\u201cThis cannot be a town-by-town or even a state-by-state fight,\u201d she said. \u201cThese miners are just going to pick up their machines and move them to a more friendly state. And that doesn\u2019t solve our climate problem.\u201d\n\nHarnessing state climate power\n\nAs Congress mulls federal action, crypto opponents in environmentally conscious states are leveraging new climate tools in an effort to push out mining operations.\n\nNew York environmentalists, for example, are invoking the state\u2019s 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act in their effort to block a crypto mine in the Finger Lakes region.\n\nGreenidge Generation Holdings Inc.\u2019s Torrey, N.Y., facility is built on the site of a former coal plant on the shores of Seneca Lake that the company converted in 2017 to burn natural gas.\n\n\u201cTo resurrect old power plants and suck up a lot of energy and make us more reliant on fossil fuels in the middle of this [climate] crisis is literally insane,\u201d said Taylor, whose New York-based group, Seneca Lake Guardian, is fighting the Greenidge facility.\n\nNew York passed a moratorium last year blocking any new crypto mines while the state evaluates their environmental effects, but the ban did not apply to Greenidge and another facility that were already permitted to operate in the state.\n\nIn June 2022, New York\u2019s Department of Environmental Conservation denied Greenidge\u2019s application to renew the air permit for its 107-megawatt capacity plant, citing the state climate law, which requires 40 percent overall emissions cuts by 2030. The company is appealing the decision before an administrative law judge, and the mine is continuing to operate in the meantime.\n\nIn response to the permit denial, Greenidge said it would slash emissions by 40 percent by the end of 2025 and would become a zero-carbon-emitting facility by 2035.\n\n\u201cWe can absolutely meet important climate goals, while generating new careers and harnessing all the potential of this industry, and our New York operation shows the path,\u201d Greenidge President Dale Irwin said in a statement.\n\nMandy DeRoche, deputy managing attorney at Earthjustice, said in an email that Greenidge\u2019s proposal for emissions reductions is \u201cspeculative and non-binding\u201d and \u201cmeaningless in terms of actual air pollution.\u201d She noted that even if the company followed through on the plan, it would still be allowed to emit nearly 350,000 tons of carbon dioxide each year. That\u2019s equivalent to the emissions from the electricity used to power about 67,000 homes for one year, according to EPA.\n\nGreenidge\u2019s permit denial came after environmental challengers made a number of unsuccessful attempts to get a court to block the project\u2019s water permits and overturn the Torrey Planning Board\u2019s 2020 approval for the facility. Despite the earlier losses, environmental groups are continuing to fight the project in federal court, this time over an alleged violation of the Clean Water Act.\n\nSeneca Lake Guardian and other groups allege in a lawsuit filed in January that the company failed to properly submit a renewal application to state officials for a water discharge permit.\n\nGreenidge maintains the issue belongs in state court, which has already ruled in its favor.\n\nThe company told a federal judge that the challengers\u2019 \u201cattempts to distort\u201d New York\u2019s requirements and discredit state officials\u2019 determination of the project are \u201cinapt.\u201d\n\nCalls for stronger state laws\n\nOn the other side of the country, activists are turning to state lawmakers for help to drive up the costs of crypto mining \u2014 and make their communities less attractive hosts for the energy-hungry facilities.\n\nBenjamin Richards, a 47-year-old retired Army officer, said residents in Pend Oreille County in northeastern Washington want to see a crypto mine owned by Chinese technology company Bitmain Technologies Ltd. and investment firm Allrise Capital Inc. leave their quiet community.\n\nBitmain purchased the bankrupt Ponderay Newsprint mill in Usk, Wash., last March, inheriting its water use and electricity permits for the 100-MW crypto mining facility.\n\nRichards said the mine requires three times more power than all the county\u2019s residents and other businesses combined. Although the county receives hydropower from the nearby Boundary Dam, Richards contested developers\u2019 claims that the crypto mine is powered by renewable energy.\n\nThe crypto facility\u2019s high energy demand means the public utility district has to purchase additional power each month from the Mid Columbia hub, a regional wholesale electricity market, he said in an email.\n\nNeither Bitmain nor Allrise could be reached for comment about the Usk crypto mine.\n\nAfter failing to dissuade county officials from approving the Bitmain project, Richards and other activists are hoping Washington legislators will pass H.B. 1416, which would amend the state\u2019s 2019 Clean Energy Transformation Act. The law requires utilities to ramp up clean energy purchases until they achieve the law\u2019s target of 100 percent zero-emission energy by 2045.\n\nBut the law does not apply to customer-owned utilities, like the Pend Oreille County Public Utility District, which provide half the electricity sold in Washington state. This has allowed industrial customers like the Bitmain crypto mine to purchase non-compliant power from out of state, said Richards.\n\nH.B. 1416 stipulates that non-residential users of customer-owned utilities \u2014 like crypto mines \u2014 also meet the state\u2019s clean electricity purchasing requirements. The bill passed the state House and Senate and has been delivered to the governor\u2019s desk to be signed into law.\n\nThe legislation comes after at least two public utility districts took their own steps to curb costs from crypto mining.\n\n\u201cThe bill would require the bitcoin mining facility to purchase source-specified power on the market, which would increase their power costs going forward,\u201d Richards said.\n\nGlenn Blackmon, a manager of the energy policy office at the Washington Department of Commerce, said the need for H.B. 1416 became evident after the state\u2019s clean energy law went into effect.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years an increasing interest in large new uses of electricity for things like hydrogen production, data centers [and] crypto mining operations,\u201d he said, \u201cand we realized that if any of those were located in areas served by consumer-owned utilities, the clean energy law wouldn\u2019t apply to them.\u201d\n\nStates embracing crypto mining\n\nIn states that have thrown their support behind crypto mining, opponents face even more of an uphill battle.\n\nMissouri and Mississippi are passing \u201cright to mine\u201d bills actively encouraging development of the sector. Kentucky has also passed incentives for crypto mining.\n\nThe fight is particularly challenging in Texas, where crypto mining accounts for 3 percent of local peak electricity demand, according to the White House OSTP report. Over the next decade, that could become a third of existing peak power demand in the state, the report said, posing challenges to electricity reliability.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott (R) has called for the Lone Star State to become a global leader in the industry, and it could soon be home to a facility that has been touted as one of the top digital cryptocurrency mining operations in the world.\n\nNot all Texans are ready to roll out welcome mats.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t even produce anything,\u201d said Jackie Sawicky, founder of Concerned Citizens of Navarro County and a member of the National Coalition Against Cryptomining. \u201cThey\u2019re a digital lottery guessing game that is being heavily subsidized by taxpayers and energy consumers.\u201d\n\nSawicky\u2019s community, located in Navarro County in the Dallas-Fort Worth region, is the planned site for the $333 million Expansion project developed by Colorado-based bitcoin mining company Riot Platforms Inc. The facility will come online later this year with 400 MW of capacity, with another 600 MW planned for the second phase of construction.\n\nThe operation would be powered by the Navarro switch, a high-voltage transmission line near the Corsicana, Texas, project site.\n\nSawicky said she and other residents are concerned about how the crypto mine is being incentivized and what that will mean for their energy bills. Securities and Exchange Commission filings from 2021, for example, show that a 700-MW facility run by Riot in Rockdale, Texas, outside of Austin has a power agreement that has locked in low-cost electricity rates until April 2030.\n\nWhile Sawicky has repeatedly reached out to local officials and requested dozens of documents related to the Corsicana facility, she said she doesn\u2019t know how she would challenge the crypto mine in court.\n\nThe broader problem, from environmentalists\u2019 perspective, is the way cryptocurrency is designed based on a decentralized system of transactions, called a blockchain. Building new blocks of that chain is what requires all the energy-intensive problem solving.\n\n\u201cWe will never get off of fossil fuels as long as the bitcoin blockchain exists,\u201d Sawicky said.\n\nEven if companies are using renewable energy sources, that zero-emitting power \u201ccould be used to make our costs lower,\u201d she said.\n\nRiot declined to discuss the specific tax incentives it received for developing the Corsicana mine but said in an emailed statement that agreements like those in place for its Rockdale facility don\u2019t exempt the company from paying taxes and are important for attracting jobs to rural areas.\n\n\u201cBased on our projects, we expect the development of the Corsicana Facility to directly lead to the creation of at least 250 full-time, high-wage jobs and will position Riot as one of the largest employers \u2014 and taxpayers \u2014 in Corsicana,\u201d the company said.\n\nRiot said its new project would drive \u201csignificant positive economic benefits\u201d to Navarro County, just as the Rockdale facility did in its community.\n\nThe company also said it is working with the Electric Reliability Council of Texas to prevent overloading the grid, and the Rockdale facility is providing a market for wind and solar energy during off-peak times that \u201cwould otherwise be wasted.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about community members\u2019 concerns about emissions resulting from its mining operations, Riot said it has \u201cno ability to control\u201d the energy mix in the grid.\n\n\u201cFurther, the company is constantly exploring alternative energy sources, including wind and solar self-generation, as its long-term plans focus on reducing cost of power,\u201d Riot said, \u201cand alternative energy generation is projected to be more cost effective than fossil fuel generation in the long-term.\u201d\n\nPush for new federal law\n\nFrustrated with the patchwork of regulatory responses to crypto mining across the country, community activists in recent months have turned up the volume on their calls for Congress to step in and craft environmental standards that would apply to the sector nationwide.\n\nAt least some federal lawmakers are paying attention.\n\nThe legislation reintroduced in February by Markey and Rep. Jared Huffman, a California Democrat, would bolster EPA oversight of crypto mining.\n\nIf passed, the bill would require crypto miners to disclose their emissions to EPA\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, establishing a federal database of the impact of the facilities. The White House OSTP report estimates that crypto mining contributes to less than 1 percent of total U.S. emissions but warns that the assessment is uncertain due to rapid fluctuations in the industry\u2019s energy consumption.\n\nThe legislation could also address uncertainty about the whereabouts of crypto mines. Developers aren\u2019t always clear about what they are trying to build in their permitting applications, said activists from several states.\n\nRob Altenburg, senior director for energy and climate at PennFuture, told lawmakers during a March congressional hearing that some companies have been plugging crypto mines directly into natural gas wellheads without obtaining permits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve asked regulators where the crypto mines are, and they can\u2019t really say with any degree of certainty,\u201d he said.\n\nIn some instances, developers have presented the proposed facilities as data or science centers, and it wasn\u2019t until after they were approved that residents became aware that they were, in fact, more energy-thirsty crypto mines, Earthjustice\u2019s DeRoche said.\n\n\u201cWhere communities have found success is when they are able to quickly galvanize together and get a lot of community involvement right away, before a crypto mine sneaks in,\u201d said Taylor of the National Coalition Against Cryptomining.\n\nThe coalition has praised Markey\u2019s proposed bill as an important first step, but activists want to see lawmakers take regulation even further by setting requirements for how crypto miners build digital ledgers.\n\nThe coalition is calling on Congress to limit the amount of energy that crypto mines can use, for example, by requiring a different system for building new blocks on the blockchain that ensures transactions are secure and not fraudulent.\n\nThe most energy-intensive way to build the blockchain is through the puzzle-solving process called proof-of-work. But blockchains can also be built without the same need for computational firepower through another process called proof-of-stake, which takes a fraction of the energy use. Instead of solving trillions of math problems, miners validate each new block, and \u201cstake\u201d an amount of cryptocurrency that they will lose if they improperly validate a block. Miners recoup their stake and receive a fee for correctly validating a new block in the blockchain.\n\nAt least one blockchain platform, ethereum, made that exact switch last year.\n\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t move away from proof-of-work crypto mining to a different form, then perhaps it ought to be banned,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of where we\u2019re at.\u201d\n\nElliot David, head of climate strategy at Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol, said trying to shift the entire industry away from the more energy-intensive proof-of-work process does not make sense.\n\nProof-of-stake is useful for things like smart contracts or securities, he said in an email, but bitcoin is meant to serve as money, which means the standard for security has to be higher and free from corruption.\n\nThe question should instead be how to use the energy-intensive process for verifying cryptocurrency transactions to boost development of renewables, he said.\n\nAs for federal regulation, David said, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with wanting transparency in the sector, though it seems that this industry is being singled out.\u201d\n\nDavid suggested the industry could also adopt a voluntary reporting model like the certification system of renewable-powered mining established by Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol.\n\n\u201cTransparency and climate should be bipartisan issues, and we believe there are market solutions to that end,\u201d David said.\n\nBut during a March Senate subcommittee hearing on crypto mining\u2019s environmental impact, Markey repeatedly noted the importance of independent oversight for the evolving industry.\n\n\u201cPeople who profit from bitcoin can\u2019t be left to grade their own homework,\u201d Markey said."

        "title": "Can Bitcoin's Halving Events Point to a Future Cryptocurrency Market Rally? - Nasdaq",
        "content": "In a landscape as volatile as crypto, there are very few trends that investors can follow with any degree of certainty. Despite its erratic nature, one of the cryptocurrency ecosystem\u2019s strongest trends has revolved around Bitcoin\u2019s halving events every four years.\n\nThe coin went on to smash through its all-time high values in the months that followed its previous halving events, and now with the next one set for 2024, could investors expect a fresh rally?\n\nThere are many reasons for cryptocurrency market speculators to be excited for a prospective Bitcoin (BTC) halving event. The market dominance of BTC means that any price rallies for the world\u2019s most famous crypto asset means that the entirety of the market is likely to experience a major bull run.\n\nAs Bitcoin\u2019s stock-to-flow model (where stock is the total existing supply of a commodity\u2014or a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin and flow is the new supply of the commodity or crypto that is created each year) shows, the cryptocurrency peaks at roughly the same stage in its halving cycle.\n\nShould this trend continue, we may see BTC surpass its most recent all-time high market values of November 2021 and soar to a considerably higher market price. But just how reliable is this metric? And what does a halving event actually involve? Let\u2019s take a deeper look at Bitcoin\u2019s halving cycles and what they actually mean for investors:\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin Halving Event?\n\nBitcoin undergoes a halving event approximately every four years. This sees the block rewards distributed to Bitcoin miners halve, hence its name.\n\nThis process will continue for many years until around the year 2140, when the total supply of BTC of 21 million is finally reached.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s halving events are significant because they mark another drop in the rate of new Bitcoins being produced on the way to reaching its total supply. At present, the number of BTC in circulation stands at just over 19.3 million, indicating that there are fewer than 1.7 million left to mine.\n\nWhen Bitcoin was launched in 2009, the reward for each block mined was 50 BTC, but the first halving event in 2012 saw this supply halved to 25. Subsequently, the 2016 halving event saw rewards cut to 12.5, and finally 6.25 in the most recent halving event on May 11, 2020.\n\nHowever, as the chart shows, each halving event brought a fresh Bitcoin rally in its wake. Following Bitcoin\u2019s 2016 halving, months of accumulation resulted in a new all-time high of $19,783.21 on December 17, 2017.\n\nIn the wake of the 2017 rally, Bitcoin and the wider market descended into a crypto winter until the 2020 halving event, which ultimately paved the way for a fresh all-time high of $69,044.77 in November 2021.\n\nSince its most recent peak, Bitcoin has descended into another crypto winter with harsh economic headwinds forcing the cryptocurrency to retrace at a significant rate. But should investors be optimistic for 2024\u2019s next halving?\n\nWhile Bitcoin is often referred to as \u2018digital gold,\u2019 the notion of the supply of gold being halved every four years would lead to unimaginable price rises. Should demand for Bitcoin continue to grow, this would logically mean that Bitcoin would continue to become more scarce in the face of demand.\n\nIs Bitcoin Heading to the Moon?\n\nWhile there are certainly a number of caveats to keep in mind, there\u2019s plenty of optimism that market commentators are drawing from Bitcoin\u2019s halving events.\n\n\u201c$180k; that\u2019s the target,\u201d stated Decentrader Crypto Analytics Founder \u2018FilbFilb\u2019 on Twitter. The user, who has amassed a following of more than 85,000 on Twitter, has based their calculations heavily on the Bitcoin halving event, which they believe will be a catalyst for a fresh all-time high for the cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cBitcoin halving is due for March 2024. If history is anything to go off then you have 18 months absolute max\u2026before we start doing all sorts of crazy stuff above the all-time high again,\u201d FilbFilb added.\n\nThis sentiment has also been echoed by famous CryptoQuant Analyst \u2018Plan B.\u2019 As a user who frequently utilizes Bitcoin\u2019s stock-to-flow model, Plan B took to Twitter to say that their metrics indicated a BTC value of over $32,000 at the time of Bitcoin\u2019s 2024 halving event, and an eventual 2025 bull market which will see BTC reach values in excess of $100,000.\n\nGiven that Bitcoin hasn\u2019t attained a value of more than $30,000 since June 2022, predictions of beyond $100k appear ambitious at first glance, but they\u2019re shared across the crypto ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIf the block rewards get cut in half to 3.125 from 6.25, then the price has got to double-ish in order for the miners to continue to make money,\u201d said Hedge Fund Manager Mark Yusko. \u201cTraditional assets are driven by economic growth, Fed policies, inflation. Crypto is driven by the technology itself, millennial adoption,\u201d Yusko added, noting that \u2018the laws of math\u2019 dictates that the upcoming halving event can push Bitcoin beyond $100,000.\n\nEmbracing a Changing Market\n\nIn cryptocurrency, perhaps more so than anywhere else, past performance should never be a guarantee for future performance. Bitcoin\u2019s halving event has held a strong correlation with market-wide rallies, but the most recent path to a new Bitcoin all-time high was buoyed by remarkably low Fed interest rates moving away from the Covid-19 pandemic which led to far greater levels of liquidity among investors.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin\u2019s recent rally was less pronounced than those before it, indicating that halving events may be weakening.\n\nHistorically, the cryptocurrency markets have maintained a correlation with traditional tech stocks. With this in mind, traders can generally look to the Nasdaq-100\u2019s performance to anticipate a change of fortunes in the likes of Bitcoin.\n\nInstitutional adoption can help to stabilize the volatility of Bitcoin, leading to better market sentiment and higher price rallies. The arrival of more institutions into the crypto landscape will also demand a more sophisticated market, powered by decentralized finance applications. In turn, paving the way for crypto\u2019s transition into more mainstream markets.\n\nSKARB offers a driving force for change within the cryptocurrency landscape for institutions, mitigating the prospect of counterparty risk in an ecosystem that\u2019s been blighted by the high-profile collapses of exchanges like FTX. Should a counterparty fail for whatever reason, it can result in high-profile reputational and economic damage, as well as causing institutions to lose out in terms of time, effort and productivity.\n\nThe unified system offered by SKARB empowers institutions by acting as an all-in-one toolset for trading across several popular exchanges. While upholding maximum levels of encryption, institutions will have the freedom to utilize the SKARB terminal to execute trades via a vast range of market makers.\n\nThrough consolidating all trades within one single app-based terminal, SKARB also enables institutions to effectively audit themselves as they build into the cryptocurrency ecosystem, helping them to become more efficient and effective. It\u2019s through platforms like this that institutional acceptance and greater crypto market stability can be assured.\n\nLooking to 2024\n\nIt certainly pays to err on the side of caution when it comes to identifying trends in crypto. However, Bitcoin\u2019s halving cycles point to one of the only trends on the market that\u2019s occurred three times and delivered fresh all-time highs each time.\n\nAlthough times are changing at a rapid pace in the world of cryptocurrency, decentralized finance and Web 3.0, the prospect of Bitcoin\u2019s upcoming price accumulation could be worth exploring on a deeper scale for institutional investors. Although there\u2019s certainly risk, Bitcoin\u2019s continued ability to confound its critics deserves more attention.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Why Is Bitcoin Going Back Up? - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Throughout 2022, the economy at large saw some turbulence. But the cryptocurrency market, in particular, experienced a downward slide from its epic heights in 2021. Even the oldest surviving cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, saw its value tumble from over $60,000 to under $17,000.\n\nInvestors interested in cryptocurrency couldn\u2019t help but wonder when Bitcoin\u2019s value would bounce back. That time seems to have finally come. Bitcoin saw its price surge 20% in March, leading many to wonder what changed. This article will explore why this reversal is happening and whether we think it will continue.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nCurrently trading around $28,000, Bitcoin has recovered almost $10,000 in value since its trough at the beginning of 2023.\n\nMany factors contributed to the falling price of Bitcoin, including generally adverse economic conditions.\n\nWith some of the factors that pushed the price down now reversed, the value of Bitcoin is rising. Only time will tell if the trend continues.\n\nA Short History of Bitcoin\n\nWhen Bitcoin hit the market in 2009, it was unclear what to expect from an investment perspective. However, that didn\u2019t stop investors who understood the cryptocurrency\u2019s potential from jumping in.\n\nIn July 2010, Bitcoin saw its first big jump in price to $0.09. But the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency led to significant swings along the way. When we fast forward to 2020, Bitcoin started climbing to an all-time high of $67,566 in November 2021.\n\nOf course, this extreme spike in value had many investors excited. After all, who wouldn\u2019t want to add such a high-performing asset to their portfolio? Unfortunately for some investors, jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon in 2021 would become a big mistake.\n\nBitcoin in 2022\n\nSince that peak of roughly $68,000, Bitcoin has taken a tumble. In mid-November 2022, the cryptocurrency\u2019s value fell to around $16,700. That meant Bitcoin had lost over 70% of its value from a year before.\n\nBitcoin prices seemed bleak in 2022 compared to the previous year\u2019s highs. But compared to prices from 2019, the asset had still increased in value even at its end-of-2022 low point.\n\nWhat Pushed Bitcoin Down?\n\nAlthough Bitcoin\u2019s value experienced such a dramatic tumble in 2022, many seasoned crypto investors were used to the extreme volatility of this asset class. And the reality is that Bitcoin was not the only asset to see shocking volatility amidst 2022\u2019s market conditions.\n\nIf you\u2019re not someone who keeps tabs on the general economy, 2022 was a wild ride. Many factors hurting stock investors and everyday households also contributed to the volatility in the crypto market.\n\nOne of the major issues facing the economy was high levels of inflation. Inflation is typically caused by a mismatch of supply and demand. Companies will raise prices if demand for goods is unusually high or something interrupts supply chains. When an increase in prices is widespread across the economy, the Federal Reserve steps in.\n\nThe Federal Reserve approved a series of aggressive rate hikes across 2022 to curb inflation. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive and reduce consumers\u2019 discretionary spending. People save more and often sell off investments, anticipating poor performance from companies.\n\nCryptocurrency suffered plenty of bad press in 2022 due to the fallout of FTX. The collapse of the crypto exchange led to a loss of over $1 billion in consumer funds. Whenever a failure like this happens, crypto markets tend to suffer as investors are increasingly skeptical of the asset\u2019s stability.\n\nThe war between Ukraine and Russia also strained the global political world in 2022. Plus, mid-term elections kept the U.S. political landscape uneasy. These factors contributed to the financial turmoil we saw, which likely caused the negative slide in Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nHowever, historically, there has been an underlying debate about the inherent value of Bitcoin. Some investors are wary of using Bitcoin as a long-term store of value, while others are more confident that another coin, like Ethereum, might surpass Bitcoin\u2019s usefulness at some point.\n\nThe Value of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency representing an alternative to \u201cnormal\u201d fiat currency. A central bank controls fiat money, and it has value because the government decrees it has value. Consumers widely use it, and its value isn\u2019t tied to a specific commodity, like the gold standard.\n\nDespite being located in a digital space, it\u2019s important to remember that Bitcoins are limited in their supply and have an associated cost of production. Some people compare Bitcoins to precious metals because of their limited economic use. For example, you can\u2019t use Bitcoin or physical gold to pay at most retail stores.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin does have certain advantages over other currencies. Bitcoin is more mobile than paper money or precious metals because it\u2019s not physical. Bitcoin\u2019s underlying technology is decentralized and validated by various independent nodes. This makes Bitcoin particularly resistant to fraud efforts like counterfeiting.\n\nUntil people use Bitcoin in more commercial activities, most consumers will likely be skeptical of its value as money. If you\u2019re interested in the debate surrounding Bitcoin\u2019s value, you may be interested in reading more about theories of currency and the switch from the gold standard to fiat currency.\n\nInvestors Look Forward to 2023\n\nAs with any stock, we can\u2019t be 100% certain why Bitcoin\u2019s value increases or decreases, but there are better and worse theories. In 2022, investors thought of several ways Bitcoin stock could experience a rebound. Some of these possibilities included:\n\nLower interest rates: If interest rates started to fall, investors thought it would encourage Bitcoin\u2019s price to rise. That\u2019s because investors would be more willing to invest in riskier assets.\n\nReduced threat of a recession: The danger of an economic downturn loomed large in everyone\u2019s minds in 2022. With economic uncertainty baked into every investor decision, opting for a risky asset like Bitcoin likely didn\u2019t seem feasible.\n\nChanges to the federal regulation: In 2022, the federal government took more interest in regulating the crypto market. Reports were submitted to the President suggesting ways to take advantage of the new technology\u2019s benefits while minimizing risks. Action taken by the federal government could\u2019ve affected the coin\u2019s price.\n\nWider acceptance of crypto: Even in 2023, many potential users are wary of the value of crypto. As more people begin to accept crypto as a way to store and transfer value, Bitcoin\u2019s value will continue to climb.\n\nSome major players in the banking industry foresaw a Bitcoin rebound. Earlier in 2022, Deutsche Bank analysts forecasted that Bitcoin would return to a value of $28,000 by the end of the year. The same bank also predicted that Bitcoin could be the digital gold of the 21st century.\n\nWhy Did Bitcoin\u2019s Value Go Back Up?\n\nNow that the rebound is finally happening, most analysts\u2019 explanations relate to easing macroeconomic conditions. While the Fed has not started lowering rates, they have slowed. Most experts anticipate just one more rate hike in 2023. This is positive news for the stock market generally, but especially for riskier assets like Bitcoin, which seem like more unnecessary expenses when inflation is high and borrowing is expensive.\n\nBanks have also recently experienced heavy losses on different bond holdings. This has contributed to the Federal Reserve being more moderate with rate hikes lately.\n\nCentralized banking has also recently faced some skepticism with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. SVB\u2019s failure was partly caused by the bank\u2019s investments losing value, which triggered depositors to withdraw significant amounts of their money. In the aftermath, some publications argued cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are better suited to running a financial system, which could have contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s rise in price.\n\nOn the other hand, many considered SVB the backbone of the tech start-up world, so its failure led some experts to predict investors would move away from crypto assets. Also, Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank, two of the biggest lenders in the crypto space, recently announced closures. This made the rise in Bitcoin\u2019s price somewhat surprising. It suggested recent events did not shake investor confidence so dramatically.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rebound has outpaced growth in the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which is only up around 18.5% this quarter. Ethereum and Solana have also seen significant growth so far this year. Where these cryptos will go in the coming months remains to be seen, but with inflation slowly cooling off and interest rates potentially lowering later this year, experts are hopeful.\n\nInvesting In Crypto\n\nAs a speculative and volatile asset, investors should prepare to lose any money they put into cryptocurrency. We\u2019ve seen many crypto crashes in the last few years, and investors shouldn\u2019t take any investment \u2013 especially with crypto \u2013 as a guaranteed success.\n\nHowever, if you are ready to take on some risk, you can earn passive income with your crypto tokens through features like crypto staking, crypto lending, and crypto royalties.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBitcoin might be the most well-known cryptocurrency, but it is still subject to the extensive volatility that investors have come to associate with the crypto markets. The economy suffered in 2022, and it hit cryptocurrencies especially hard. Bitcoin lost considerable value from its high at the end of 2021, hitting a trough near the end of 2022. It has since rebounded, probably because of easing macroeconomic conditions and recent troubles in the centralized banking world.\n\nIf you\u2019re an investor building a portfolio of individual cryptocurrencies, keep your eye on current events. Don\u2019t take any investment as a guaranteed success, and learn about ways you can invest smartly and defensively in these ground-breaking new assets.\n\nThe post Why Is Bitcoin Going Back Up? appeared first on Due.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Bhutan is bullish on Bitcoin (BTC). Following the revelation that the small Himalayan kingdom has been quietly accumulating crypto, the country is also mining Bitcoin. Moreover, the country of less than 800,000 people leverages green energy to power its Bitcoin mining operations.\n\nKnown for its focus on \u201cGross National Happiness\u201d and picturesque landscapes, Bhutan has found ways to harness its immense hydroelectric potential, which accounts for 30% of its gross domestic product.\n\nFirst reported in an expos\u00e9 in local Bhutanese news and followed by inquiries from Forbes, Bhutanese officials confirmed that mining began when the price of Bitcoin was around $5,000 in April 2019. The price per Bitcoin has since soared to roughly $28,000 per coin at the time of writing.\n\nThe kingdom has reportedly explored partnerships to expand its mining operations further. Notably, it is negotiating with Nasdaq-listed mining company Bitdeer to secure 100 megawatts of power for a Bitcoin mining data center in Bhutan. This partnership would increase Bitdeer\u2019s mining capacity by about 12%.\n\nThe scale of Bhutan\u2019s mining operations remains a mystery, with little information available about the location, size and profitability of its mining farms. Some Druk Holding and Investments (DHI) employees have listed \u201ccrypto mining\u201d as their tasks and skills on their LinkedIn profiles.\n\nIt is also unclear why the government chose not to disclose this project to its citizens or international partners. However, it is known that the state-owned holding company DHI has invested millions of dollars in cryptocurrency holdings, with the funds managed on behalf of its people.\n\nAlthough mainstream media would indicate the contrary, Bitcoin mining is the world\u2019s cleanest industry, with more than 50% of its energy sources being renewable or clean energy. Bitcoin mining advocates, such as MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor, explain that \u201c99.92% of carbon emissions in the world are due to industrial uses of energy other than Bitcoin mining.\u201c Due to cheap, abundant hydroelectric power, DHI reported that Bhutan is an ideal destination for mining Bitcoin.\n\nRelated: How Bitcoin mining saved Africa's oldest national park from bankruptcy\n\nBhutan adds to a long list of regions from East Africa to Scandinavia mining Bitcoin with hydropower, one of the cheapest clean energy sources.\n\nCointelegraph reached out to Druk Holding and Investments and will update the article when a comment is received.\n\nCointelegraph Magazine: Bitcoin in Senegal: Why is this African country using BTC?"

        "title": "Is Block Stock a Buy After Diversifying Into Bitcoin Mining? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It's been a disappointing year so far for Block Inc. (SQ 4.91%). The year started with a mini-rally in January and February, but a controversial short-selling report from Hindenburg Research in March has weighed heavily on Block's fortunes. Heading into May, Block is basically back at square one. The stock started the year trading at $62.84 and currently trades at $60.79.\n\nBut Block now has a new plan to turn things around and woo back investors, and it involves Bitcoin (BTC 1.18%) mining. Yes, that's right, the company that is best known for its Square payments technology and the Cash App is now diversifying into Bitcoin mining. Given Bitcoin's epic rally this year (up about 70% year to date), there's certainly reason to be optimistic. So let's take a closer look.\n\nWhy Bitcoin mining?\n\nAt first glance, diversification into Bitcoin mining would not seem to offer any synergies with Block's existing product offerings. But dig a bit deeper, and the strategy actually starts to make more sense. For one, Block already holds a tremendous amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. According to CoinGecko, Block now holds nearly $230 million worth of Bitcoin, which ranks fourth among all publicly traded companies. To put that into context, Block holds almost as much Bitcoin as cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global.\n\nSecondly, the company's Cash App offers users the opportunity to buy, sell, send, or receive Bitcoin. While the bearish Hindenburg Research report questioned how many people were actually doing this, as well as the potentially nefarious uses for this app, it's easy to see that Block is no stranger to Bitcoin and crypto payments. With Bitcoin becoming more and more mainstream, it makes sense that Cash App stands to benefit from the current Bitcoin rally.\n\nBlock's Bitcoin mining strategy\n\nIt's important to note that Block only plans to manufacture the chips and related hardware for Bitcoin mining -- it does not plan to do the actual mining itself. While Block has been involved in a few high-profile Bitcoin mining projects, the ultimate goal is to become an Intel (INTC -4.44%) for Bitcoin mining chips. Block has plenty of experience designing chips for its Square payment processing solutions and says it has revolutionary new technology on deck that will soon be ready for custom-made Bitcoin chips.\n\nTo jump-start its Bitcoin mining strategy, Block recently bought a huge supply of Bitcoin mining chips from (who else?) Intel, which is winding down its operations. Intel plans to discontinue its Bitcoin mining chip operations by April 2024, and Block is more than happy to fill the void. Block plans to offer its own high-end Bitcoin mining chips and mining hardware by early next year. In doing so, it will go head-to-head with a handful of companies that dominate the space.\n\nPros and cons\n\nWill the potential synergies actually materialize? If you're an optimist, then you believe that Block can somehow integrate the new Bitcoin mining operations into its other core operations. Theoretically, the more that Block can do to boost Bitcoin adoption, the better it is for its stock price. In short, the logic goes something like this: Rising Bitcoin prices lead to rising fortunes for Bitcoin miners, who will be more likely to buy Bitcoin mining chips from Block. At the same time, rising Bitcoin prices will pump up the value of Bitcoin on Block's balance sheet and convince more people to use the Cash App for Bitcoin. This, too, should boost the overall value of Block stock.\n\nIf you're a pessimist, however, it's easy to see how things could go very wrong. Bitcoin mining is a cyclical business, and there's a good reason why Intel is getting out of the business of manufacturing Bitcoin chips. In good times, it's a good business to be in. But in bad times, not so much. So, if you believe in Bitcoin mining for Block, then you also have to believe that Block is smarter than Intel right now.\n\nShould you buy Block stock?\n\nRight now, there are too many questions swirling around Block to make it a buy. In my opinion, Block still hasn't fully addressed all of the questions in the controversial Hindenburg Research report. And, from my perspective, the claim that Block is going to somehow \"disrupt\" Bitcoin mining sounds a bit too hyperbolic. The fact that Intel got into and then out of the Bitcoin mining business in just 12 months should be a red flag for investors.\n\nFor that reason, I can not recommend Block as a buy right now. While I'm super-bullish on Bitcoin for the long term, I just don't think Bitcoin mining is the right strategy for Block right now."

The firm added:\n\n\u201cWe have principal due upon maturity of our long-term debt instruments in the aggregate of $2.208 billion in addition to $2.4 million in coupon interest due each semi-annual period for the 2025 Convertible Notes, $15.3 million in coupon interest due each semi-annual period for the 2028 Secured Notes, and $0.1 million due monthly in principal and interest related to our other long-term secured debt.\u201d\n\nThe business intelligence platform said it does not expect the cash and equivalents generated by its enterprise analytics software business to be sufficient to satisfy these debt obligations.\n\nDue to this, the firm said it would explore different options, which include borrowing against its BTC or the outright sales of some of its holdings.\n\nOther options available to the firm include refinancing the debt obligations, sourcing cash from other sources like issuing and selling shares of its class A common stock, or even settling the Convertible Notes obligations under certain unnamed conditions.\n\nIn December 2022, MicroStrategy sold some of its BTC holdings for the first time since it began accumulating. At the time, the company said it sold the assets to generate tax benefits.\n\nHowever, it has since gone on an accumulation spree this year. During the first quarter, it purchased 7,500 BTC, pushing its total Bitcoin holding to 140,000 BTC \u2014 more than the bankrupt crypto exchange Mt. Gox.\n\nMeanwhile, MicroStrategy\u2019s BTC acquisition approach has enticed several traditional financial institutions to buy its stocks to gain indirect exposure to the flagship digital asset. According to chairman Michael Saylor, the company shares have risen by 166% since it adopted the BTC standard in 2020 \u2014 outperforming other assets like Gold, Nasdaq, S&P 500, etc.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Are Stocks, Bonds, Bitcoin, or Your Humble Home the Best Investment Today? - Realtor.com News",
        "content": "In these financially fraught times, just about everyone is struggling to figure out the best way to keep their money safe\u2014and, more importantly, to make it grow. Are homebuying and selling the best investments you can make? Does it make sense to stash as much cash as you can into the stock market? Is it a bad time to flip a home, or a good one? And why are financial gurus suddenly so gung-ho on CDs?\n\nThat\u2019s an awful lot for the average investor to consider. That\u2019s why Realtor.com\u00ae wanted to see just how the American dream of homeownership compared with other common investments. So we took a look at nine real estate and other financial investments to see how they have performed over the past five years.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s hiking of interest rates, to tame inflation, has changed the financial landscape dramatically. As a result of the Fed increases, the housing market has been upended by higher mortgage interest rates and there have been several prominent bank failures, including First Republic Bank. The stock market has had some big swings, while other more overlooked investments like money market funds, certificates of deposit, and even humble savings accounts have suddenly become sought-after, more profitable places to stash some cash.\n\nUnfortunately, the landscape has shifted enough that past returns might no longer be a good predictor of future profits. These investments are highly sensitive to what the Fed does with rates, so their profitability might hinge largely on whether interest rates rise or fall.\n\n\u201cEach investment has its own unique risks, potential rewards, and barriers to entry,\u201d says Anna Sergunina, president and CEO of MainStreet Financial Planning. \u201cHomeownership and flipping require significant capital and expertise, while stocks, REITs, and bitcoin can be more volatile. Bonds, CDs, and money market accounts offer lower risk, but potentially lower returns.\u201d\n\nNo matter what\u2019s going on in the financial markets, most planners recommend folks spread their money around in different investments. This protects them so that if the stock market is down, their bond investments are still strong, or vice versa.\n\nWatch: Mortgage Rates Are a \u2018Wild Card\u2019 for Both Homebuyers and Sellers: April 2023 Real Estate and Economy Update\n\nFinancial experts also caution against investing just for the short term, and advise also taking a more long-term view of their investments. And perhaps the biggest consideration of all, they warn their clients not to invest any money that they wouldn\u2019t be comfortable losing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to predict the future,\u201d says Cynthia Meyer, a financial planner at Real Life Planning in Gladstone, NJ. \u201cIf you take the long view and you\u2019re really well diversified across investments, so you don\u2019t own one stock, you own hundreds of stocks \u2026 some of those cylinders are always going to be firing.\u201d\n\nMost financial professionals also strongly caution against get-rich-quick schemes and investments such as putting all of their savings into cryptocurrency or meme stocks like GameStop.\n\n\u201cThat mentality was ill-advised,\u201d says Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf it was so easy to generate large returns based on fads, then we\u2019d know a lot more people who became wealthy overnight.\u201d\n\n1. Home price appreciation*\n\nOne-year returns: 6.26%\n\nThree-year returns: 32.88%\n\nFive-year returns: 48.95%\n\nHomeownership is a core tenet of the American dream for a good reason.\n\nHistorically, prices have risen over the long term, catapulting scores of Americans into the middle class and providing wealth that can be passed down through generations. Plus, homeowners can live in\u2014and enjoy\u2014their investments. (You don\u2019t get that from CDs.)\n\nThe challenge right now for many first-time buyers is to find a home they can afford. A shortage of homes for sale has kept prices high in many markets, and higher mortgage rates have pushed many would-be buyers out of the market.\n\nAnd even those who can make the numbers work aren\u2019t protected from downturns in the housing market. During the Great Recession, home prices plummeted, plunging many homeowners under water on their mortgages. Millions of Americans lost their homes to foreclosure.\n\nBut those who were able to hold on to their properties have seen prices rebound and then some over the past 15 or so years. And while many real estate professionals predict prices will dip in the months ahead, they\u2019re not predicting any catastrophic drop. Many markets are still seeing prices increase, and most experts believe prices will recover nationally by next year or 2025.\n\n\u201cHomeownership is the greatest generator of wealth for most Americans,\u201d says Bankrate\u2019s Hamrick. \u201cOver a long period, that should work well for most people and it generally does.\u201d\n\n2. Stock market*\n\nOne-year returns: -2.9%\n\nThree-year returns: 40.9%\n\nFive-year returns: 51.9%\n\nInvesting in the stock market isn\u2019t for the faint of heart. After what seemed like meteoric growth during the COVID-19 pandemic, the S&P 500 has since had a few headline-making drops before recovering some of those losses. But while the market is risky\u2014and plenty of folks have lost their shirts in it\u2014it\u2019s generally considered a good long-term investment.\n\nThe key is to play the long game and not focus on the day-to-day or week-to-week fluctuations, say financial planners.\n\nThose who are nearing retirement and may need that money sooner might want to put less money in the stock market because of that volatility. They might want to invest more in bonds, mutual funds (which are collections of stocks), and certificates of deposits, which are considered to be safer investments.\n\n\n\n\"The market is going to go up and it\u2019s going to go down. Over the long term, it\u2019s going to be very important just to have had held on to those investments,\" says Daniel Johnson, a financial planner at RE|Focus Financial Planning based in Winston-Salem, NC.\n\n3. Bonds*\n\n2023 average 10-year U.S. Treasury bond rate: 3.6%\n\n2020 average 10-year U.S. Treasury bond rate: 0.89%\n\n2018 average 10-year U.S. Treasury bond rate: 2.91%\n\nBonds have always been considered a safer, more stable, vanilla type of investment. But higher interest rates are changing that calculus.\n\n\"It's very exciting right now,\" says Vance Barse, a financial planner at Your Dedicated Fiduciary based in San Diego. \"You can earn a much higher interest rate than you could [previously].\"\n\nInvestors who opt for shorter-term bonds, with terms of a year or less, can find rates above 5%.\n\nBonds are loans made to companies and to federal, state, and local governments for a pre-determined length of time, typically ranging from a single month to 30 years. Investors earn interest on bonds and then receive their money back when the bonds mature.\n\nWhile higher rates mean more profitability, the downside is that bonds purchased when rates were lower aren\u2019t as attractive to invest in as the newer ones with higher interest rates. So if someone needs to sell a bond before it matures, they could lose money on that sale. And they might not get their full investment back if they don\u2019t wait until the end of their term.\n\nThat\u2019s how Silicon Valley Bank got itself in trouble and ultimately collapsed. The failed financial institution had bought up a lot of bonds that were worth less as interest rates increased.\n\nThis explains why the returns for bonds, which is what investors will make if they sell early, were down 1.51% over one year, down 9.26% over three years, and up 6.24% over five years as of April 25, according to Morningstar Direct.**\n\n\"But all of these losses are unrealized until someone decides to exit their exposure to the investment,\" says Bankrate's Hamrick. \"These losses are essentially on paper.\"\n\n4. Bitcoin*\n\nOne-year returns: -27.4%\n\nThree-year returns: 270.6%\n\nFive-year returns: 218.3%\n\nThe spectacular rise of cryptocurrency has been well documented\u2014as has its even more tremendous fall. The industry has been reeling since the large crypto exchange FTX collapsed late last year and its charismatic founder Sam Bankman-Fried was hit with 13 criminal counts, including securities fraud and money laundering. The repercussions have been felt throughout the digital currency landscape.\n\nInvestors who still want to put their money in bitcoin, the OG of digital currency, must accept the high amount of volatility. The market can plunge at any moment, which has happened, costing many investors their savings. There are no government insurance protections if something goes wrong. Investors who forget their credentials for their bitcoin wallet, where they can store the cryptocurrency, can lose everything. And transactions are irreversible.\n\n\"It\u2019s not something I ever advocate investing in if you\u2019re not willing to lose that investment,\" says Johnson, with RE|Focus Financial Planning.\n\n5. Home flipping*\n\nGross returns in 2022: 26.9%\n\nGross returns in 2019: 40%\n\nGross returns in 2017: 47.3%\n\nHome flipping might seem glamorous\u2014and lucrative\u2014on HGTV. But the reality is that flipping a home takes a lot of money and work, and investors can wind up losing quite a bit in the process.\n\nInvestors made about $67,900 per flip last year, according to real estate data firm ATTOM. That was down from the previous year. And that figure doesn't capture what flippers sunk into the home for maintenance and renovations. The gross return on investment numbers factored in only the difference between the initial price the home was purchased for and how much it sold for after it was renovated within a 12-month period.\n\nTypically, flippers should expect that about 20% to 30% of their profits will be spent on renovations. And that's if nothing goes terribly wrong during construction, such as an unexpected structural or plumbing issue, or home prices fall.\n\n\n\n\"The main risks are renovation budgets and schedules that fall short of reality, contractors who take longer than expected or do shoddy work, and potential delays in getting renovations approved by building inspectors,\" says ATTOM CEO Rob Barber.\n\nInvestors also need to be cognizant of what's going on in the market. Many flippers got themselves into financial trouble when they assume that home prices will keep rising indefinitely. During the Great Recession, many lost money when the market crashed and they couldn't recoup what they had put into these homes.\n\n\"Home flipping is really great in the good times,\" says RE|Focus Financial Planning's Johnson. \"But it can be really, really bad in the bad times because you\u2019re stuck with a house that you can\u2019t sell for what you\u2019ve invested in it.\n\n\"It can come with a lot of risk if the housing market turns on you very quickly,\" he adds.\n\n6. Real estate investment trusts*\n\nOne-year returns: -19.78%\n\nThree-year returns: 34.22%\n\nFive-year returns: 31.71%\n\nFor investors who would like to own a lot of real estate\u2014but simply don't have the funds to start buying up lots of property\u2014real estate investment trusts might be something to consider. They allow regular Joes an affordable way to invest in commercial real estate, such as apartment buildings, warehouses, and other types of property, on the cheap.\n\nInvestors buy shares in REITs, which are companies that own real estate, and then receive quarterly dividend payments. They can also buy and sell their shares on an exchange, potentially for a profit.\n\n\"For the average person, you're not going to have access to owning that business all by yourself,\" says Meyer, with Real Life Planning. \"Owning REITs gives you access ... without having to have a billion dollars.\"\n\nHowever, REITs are risky. The rise in mortgage interest rates hammered just about every real estate category investors can purchase REITs in. Those concentrated in the office sector took a heavy beating last year as the rise of remote and hybrid work resulted in many companies breaking leases or cutting their office space. Returns in this sector fell 37.6% in 2022, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. Apartments, manufactured homes, and single-family rentals also saw steep declines.\n\nThe good news for investors: In the first three months of this year, returns on REITs focused on industrial, self-storage, and data storage real estate have been climbing.\n\nThe value of REITs is \"going to go up and down with the economy,\" says Meyer.\n\n7. Money market funds*\n\nOne-year returns: 2.5%\n\nThree-year returns: 2.57%\n\nFive-year returns: 5.86%\n\nMoney market funds have recently been enjoying a rare moment in the spotlight thanks to higher interest rates. The average seven-day yield on these funds is now about 4%, according to Morningstar Direct.\n\nThese funds are popular with investors who value liquidity and stability over higher returns. The low-risk mutual funds typically invest in short-term U.S. Treasury and other less volatile bonds. While these funds are not completely risk-free, they're considered to be pretty close. And investors can sell shares in them at any time.\n\n\"We\u2019ve entered a new paradigm,\" says Barse, with Your Dedicated Fiduciary. \"Given where interest rates are, many of the banks are paying a fraction of what you can get in a money market fund ... or an FDIC-insured CD.\"\n\n8. Certificates of deposit*\n\nOne-year yield: 1.68%\n\nThree-year yield: 1.21%\n\nFive-year yield: 1.23%\n\nCertificates of deposit, better known as CDs, have become much more attractive to investors who don't mind tying up their money for a few months to a few years. Most banks offer the investments, which require folks to fork over a set amount of money for a predetermined period of time at a fixed rate. Once the CD matures, the investor gets the money back plus interest.\n\nSome financial institutions are offering rates above 5% for CDs with roughly one-year terms. So if you invest $1,000 in a 12-month CD, you'll walk away with $50 once it matures. That's not too shabby.\n\nThe downside is that if you need to take the money out early, you'll pay a penalty for doing so.\n\n\u201cThere are no guarantees that interest rates will stay where they are today,\" says Johnson, with RE|Focus Financial Planning. With a CD, \"you have a bank that's guaranteeing you that rate for a period of time.\"\n\n9. Savings accounts*\n\nCurrent average annual percentage yield: 0.24%\n\n2020 average APY: 0.09%\n\n2018 average APY: 0.09%\n\nMany folks will probably find savings accounts a surprising addition to this list\u2014especially with such low yields. That's because many of the larger banks have kept rates low on most savings accounts.\n\nHowever, savvy individuals who shop around can find accounts, many at online banks that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., offering rates 20 times as high, according to Bankrate's Hamrick. He notes there were accounts offering roughly 4.8% yields last week.\n\nThe higher rates are a result of the Fed hiking interest rates.\n\n\"The world got flipped upside down with the most aggressive Federal Reserve in 40 years, resulting in the best savings account [yields] in a decade,\" adds Hamrick.\n\n* Home price appreciation is based on Realtor.com median home list prices in March 2023 compared with March 2022, March 2020, and March 2018.

        "content": "Bitcoin edged up on Monday morning in Asia on the first trading day of May to hold above the US$29,000 mark as worries about the U.S. banking system resurfaced and amid bullish price forecasts for the token. Ether dipped below US$1,900, paring its 5% gain in April. Most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded lower, though Binance\u2019s BNB gained after the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange added the Sui blockchain to its Launchpool. Litecoin led the losers. U.S. equity futures traded flat to lower in Asia ahead of the Fed interest rate decision this week.

This could foreshadow a surge in 2023 that could send Bitcoin to US$105,000, according to a Bloomberg analyst report on Sunday.\n\nBitcoin could attract investment from global bond investors due to negative real rates and real returns, according to Jamie Coutts, a senior market structure analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nEther dipped 0.81% to US$1,884, but was trading 0.34% higher for the week. The world\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency gained over 5% for the month of April.\n\nBinance\u2019s BNB jumped 5.56% to US$339.09, logging a weekly gain of 2.05%. Binance introduced Sui blockchain\u2019s SUI token to its Launchpool on Monday, allowing Binance users to stake their BNB and TrueUSD (TUSD) to farm the recently launched SUI, whose price jumped over 20% in the past 24 hours.\n\nBNB also received a boost from Binance\u2019s return to Japan. Sakura Exchange BitCoin (SEBC), a regulated crypto exchange platform in Japan that was acquired by Binance in November 2022, will end its domestic services by the end of May and start a new service under the name \u201cBinance Japan\u201d from June 2023, according to a notice by SEBC on Friday.\n\nLitecoin led the losers, falling 2.33% to US$88.67 but adding 1.56% for the week.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization edged up 0.09% in the past 24 hours to US$1.20 trillion.

They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index edged up 0.37% to 3,757.67 in the 24 hours to 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, but remained 0.55% lower for the week. The index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts. It is managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nMad Lads, a Solana-based NFT first minted on April 21, logged the largest seven-day sales volume across the market of over US$7.63 million, beating Bored Ape Yacht Club\u2019s (BAYC) US$7.04 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. The floor price of the NFT was 63.75 SOL as of 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, almost 10 times higher than the first token minted at 6.9 SOL.\n\nBAYC, one of the biggest NFT collections by market cap, also saw a surge in sales volume in the past 24 hours, jumping 170.22% to US$1.05 million, the largest volume across the NFT market.\n\nEquities\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded flat to lower as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong.

The share price of U.S.-based First Republic Bank plunged 43.20% on Friday after the lender reported a 40.8% drop in deposits, or around US$100 billion, since the start of the year. Regulators are preparing to take over and sell the embattled bank, with multiple large financial institutions having submitted bids, according to the Wall Street Journal on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nMeanwhile in China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, the purchasing managers manufacturing index for April unexpectedly fell to 49.2 on month, missing expectations of a 51.4 gain, pointing to slower growth in the country, according to Reuters on Monday.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s next move on interest rates is due on May 3. The Fed has repeatedly raised rates over the past year to bring inflation down to its target range of 2%. With U.S. inflation still trending at around 5%, analysts at the CME Group now expect an 85.5% chance the Fed will raise rates by 25 basis points this week.\n\nU.S. interest rates are currently between 4.75% to 5%, the highest since June 2006.\n\nSee related article: Coinbase says SEC\u2019s legal threats punish transparency, undermine public listing process"

        "title": "Bitcoin hash rates threaten blockchain decentralization - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Blockchain technology was introduced in 2008 as a decentralized, secure, transparent system for managing digital transactions. Its primary aim was to provide a solution to major problems with traditional transactional systems, including trust, security, decentralization and efficiency. Blockchain has since expanded beyond finance and has been used in supply chain management, healthcare, games, digital media and social media, among others.\n\nHowever, the blockchain industry is still facing significant challenges \u2014 such as a lack of diversity, wealth control by a few holders, hash rate problems and a loss of the promise of decentralization.\n\nHash rate and why it\u2019s a problem\n\nThe cryptocurrency on everyone\u2019s mind \u2014 and in the digital wallets of more than 400 million people around the world \u2014 is Bitcoin (BTC). Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate is the computing power required to validate transactions and produce new blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain. A high hash rate is necessary to maintain the integrity of the Bitcoin network, but it also presents some significant challenges.\n\nHash rate distribution among the largest mining pools for the six months ending April 25, 2023.\n\nOne of the most pressing issues is the high energy consumption required to maintain a high hash rate. As more miners join the network, the hash rate increases \u2014 and so does the energy consumption required to sustain it. The environmental impact of BTC mining has led to concerns throughout Bitcoin\u2019s volatile history and rise to mainstream fame.\n\nAnother challenge with Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate is the centralization of mining power in a few large mining pools. As the hash rate has increased over time, it has become increasingly difficult for individual miners to compete with these large pools, leading to concerns about the potential for these pools to monopolize the network and control the direction of Bitcoin\u2019s development.\n\nRelated: Elizabeth Warren wants the police at your door in 2024\n\nThere is also the potential for 51% attacks by mining pools that control the majority of the hash rate. If a single mining pool or a group of mining pools controls over 50% of the hash rate, they could potentially control the network and carry out malicious activities, such as double-spend attacks or rewriting transaction histories. This presents a significant threat to the security and integrity of the Bitcoin network.\n\nFinally, the limited scalability of the Bitcoin network is another challenge associated with its hash rate. As more users join the network and the number of transactions increases, the network can become congested, leading to slow transaction times and high fees. This can limit its utility as a viable payment system and has led to ongoing debates within the Bitcoin community about how to address these scalability challenges.\n\nPhantom decentralization comes in many forms\n\nThe blockchain industry has quickly fallen into a massive imbalance of power, mirroring the traditional finance industry. The concentration of wealth and power within a small group of individuals has created an industry that is far from decentralized. Those who were early adopters of blockchain technology, particularly Bitcoin, were able to accumulate large amounts of wealth through mining, investing and trading.\n\nThis has led to a concentration of wealth and power within a small group of individuals. The complexity of blockchain further limited early adoption to a minuscule percentage of people in the tech world. This concentration of power and wealth has made it difficult for new players to enter the market and challenge the dominance of established players.\n\nBitcoin ownership concentration, 2021 v. 2023. Source: Glassnode\n\nThe high barriers to entry have also contributed to the imbalance of power in the blockchain industry. The cost of setting up and running a successful blockchain project can be significant, and not everyone has the resources or expertise to do so. This has made it difficult for new startups to enter the market and challenge the dominance of established players.\n\nNetwork effects also play a role in the imbalance of power in the blockchain industry. Blockchain networks rely on network effects, which means that the value of the network increases as more people use it. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where established networks become increasingly dominant, making it harder for new networks to gain traction.\n\nFrom phantom decentralization to the real thing\n\nDespite the challenges facing the blockchain industry, there are ways to address these issues and create a more sustainable, equitable system.\n\nOne of the most pressing issues with Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate is its high energy consumption. To address this, the industry could move toward using renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar power, to power mining operations. This would not only reduce the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining but also make it more sustainable in the long run.\n\nRelated: CBDCs will lead to absolute government control\n\nTo address the issue of limited scalability in the Bitcoin network, efforts should be made to improve the underlying technology. This could include the development of new protocols or the adoption of existing protocols, such as the Lightning Network, which could significantly improve the speed and efficiency of Bitcoin transactions.\n\nFinally, greater efforts should be made to educate people about blockchain technology and its potential. This could be achieved by providing greater access to information and resources, offering training programs and workshops, and working with educational institutions to integrate blockchain into their curricula.\n\nAlexa Karp is head of marketing at Lumerin and a former founding marketing manager at Metaplex.

The result of this has been \u201cthe excessive concentration of custom bitcoin mining silicon\u201d in the hands of a select few companies. Block deems this centralization harmful to both miners and the Bitcoin network as a whole.\n\nWe have an update on our mining initiative. This one is about ASICshttps://t.co/bJOM9YNxfl \u2014 Thomas Templeton (@TempletonThomas) April 28, 2023\n\nNotably, the San Francisco headquartered company wrote that it plans to make Bitcoin mining technology \u201copen source\u201d where possible by selling standalone ASICs and other hardware components to \u201coptimize innovation and maximize the size of the Bitcoin mining hardware ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe post adds that the steps taken over the past few months will allow the firm to experiment with new designs and aid them in bringing more efficient and affordable Bitcoin mining chips to market. In order to fast-track this development push, Block added that it has purchased a large batch of ASIC chips from Intel.\n\nOn April 18, Intel announced that it would halt taking new orders for its Blockscale 1000 Series ASICs by Oct. 20 and end shipping in April 2024 as part of cost-cutting measures. Block says this large intake of ASICs from Intel will help accelerate the development of its proprietary 3nm chip, which it claims upon its release, would be the most advanced chip to date.\n\n\u201cWe can now focus our design team exclusively on cutting edge three nanometer ASIC development.\u201d\n\nThe scale of a nanometer (1nm) is approximately equivalent to the width of two silicon atoms. As parts of the chips become smaller, it allows for more transistors to fit into a silicon die of the same size. By reducing the overall size, the electric current travels less distance in the circuit to perform a calculation, which means that overall efficiency is improved and the amount of heat produced is decreased.\n\nRelated: Mineflation: Cost to mine one Bitcoin in the US rises from $5K to $17K in 2023\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that 5 nanometre ASIC chips have been around for some time, with the earliest 5nm ASIC being released in 2021 from Chinese mining firm Canaan. Currently, most Bitcoin mining ASICs run on 5nm chips; however, no company has made their ASIC chip designs open source.\n\nBitmain S19 ASIC mining rig.

On Monday alone, over 372,000 inscriptions were created on the Bitcoin network\u2014contributing to a daily record 682,281 Bitcoin transactions\u2014with daily network fees hitting 23 BTC, or around $656,000.\n\nI can't believe my eyes BRC-20 demand leading to a 700% increase in fees AFTER what we've seen with Ordinal Inscriptions 12,800% increase in fees from BEFORE Ordinal Inscriptions launched 300,000 unconfirmed transactions in the mempool pic.twitter.com/oyLceu6ODe \u2014 trevor.btc @ NYC (@TO) May 2, 2023\n\n\u201cMost of the acceleration is BRC-20,\u201d Trevor Owens, Managing Partner at Bitcoin Frontier Fund, told Decrypt. The BRC-20 token standard made minting tokens and meme coins on the Bitcoin network possible, clearing the path for over 1 million more inscriptions to be added to the over 2.5 million already on the Bitcoin network in less than a week.\n\nIntroduced in March, BRC-20\u2014or Bitcoin Request for Comment number 20\u2014allowed the creation of fungible tokens using the Ordinals protocol launching a new wave of interest in minting NFT-like assets on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nBut while JPEGs are flooding the network, most inscriptions are still text-based.\n\n\u201cText inscriptions are lower cost since you pay based on the size of the data,\u201d Owens said. \u201cSo they are low-cost high volume, whereas JPEGs and digital media is high cost, low volume.\u201d\n\nCurrently, the memory usage on the Bitcoin network is over 650 MB, double the initial 300 MB capacity, indicating a higher demand for computer memory due to the increased transactions and fuller blocks, according to data from Mempool. This increase may make running a node more challenging, but Ordinals proponents say it secures and strengthens the network.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cAs long as the value gained from minting BRC-20 tokens is higher than the value lost to the inscription fees, we will see fees on Bitcoin continue to climb,\u201d pseudonymous Twitter user @LeonidasNFT said, adding that higher fees on Bitcoin are a very good thing.\n\n\u201cIt indicates strong demand for Bitcoin\u2019s block space, which is critical for the long-term success of the protocol,\u201d Leonidas said. \u201cThe days of only using Bitcoin to transfer BTC to your hardware wallet once every few years have come to an end.\u201d\n\nBitcoin NFT Mints Surpass 200K\u2014But Is Interest in Ordinals Fading?\n\nHigh fees benefit the Bitcoin blockchain by incentivizing miners, prioritizing valuable transactions, and enhancing network security. However, while loading up the Bitcoin blockchain with JPEGs and sending fees skyrocketing may be good for miners and the network\u2019s security, it puts a higher price tag on transactions on the network.\n\n\u201cIn February, we inscribed the Taproot Wizards collection, which took over 80MB of Bitcoin block space,\u201d Taproot Wizards tweeted. \u201cBut now bitcoin transaction fees are so high, that if we tried inscribing the 80MB of wizards today, the fees would\u2019ve cost us 32 BTC. Almost $1 million dollars.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think this is the best thing that could have happened to Bitcoin,\u201d Owens said, pointing out that the launch and development of Ordinals did not require changing the Bitcoin base protocol. \u201cWe\u2019ve unlocked new use cases to bring in liquidity, new users, and lots of developers making Bitcoin more valuable through better user experience and more use cases is what we need to reach mass adoption.\u201d"

As the photo suggests, Harmon spent part of those funds showing off at nightclubs in Miami and Northeast Ohio.\n\nclick to enlarge U.S. Department of Justice Screenshot showing Harmon's $100,000 withdrawal in single dollars, among other party plans.\n\nAfter laundering millions of dollars in stolen Bitcoin currency, souping up his Lamborghini, \"making it rain\" at strip clubs in Ohio and Florida and splurging on luxury real estate, Gary Harmon was sentenced to four years and three months in prison last Thursday, the Department of Justice announced.His brother, Larry Dean Harmon, was arrested in February 2020 for running a money laundering service on the Dark Web called Helix. Gary Harmon attempted to use keys to Helix's wallets to re-transfer the funds \u2014 712 Bitcoins \u2014 that were seized by the FBI and the IRS' Cyber Crime Unit in Washington, D.C.\"The defendant\u2019s actions in this case cannot be dismissed as a momentary lapse of judgment or a crime of opportunity,\" U.S. attorneys wrote in a sentencing memo filed in Federal court April 13th. Gary Harmon \"sat on the cryptocurrency for months, with ample time to return the funds\u2014whether by coming clean to the government directly, relaying the funds through his brother or his brother\u2019s attorney, or by anonymously remitting the assets to the government.When Gary Harmon was interrogated about the recovery attempt, he told agents, \u201cif I took it, why wouldn\u2019t I take it all,\u201d the memo said, \"and stated that he received a thumb drive from his brother containing partial recovery seed phrases and had flushed the thumb drive down a toilet.\"In August 2021, Larry Harmon pleaded guilty to operating a money laundering service for, the memo said, those entrenched in \"illegal goods and services.\" By charging a 2.5 percent fee per transaction, Larry accumulated 4,877 bitcoin in 16 wallets.In sum, the DOJ determined Helix laundered $311 million on behalf of its customers. Because Gary Harmon had knowledge of the keys needed to access those funds on his brother's Treznor device\u2014a sort of safe for Bitcoin enthusiasts\u2014he was in a position to effectively recreate the wallets seized by government agents.By day, it seems, Gary Harmon penchant for crypto seemed to contribute to an honest career in tech.According to a resum\u00e9 posted on LinkedIn , Harmon worked at CoinNinja , an Akron-based startup that aids in Bitcoin wallet security and management. He graduated from Kent State University in 2014,with a degree in exercise science.\"Highly motivated junior software engineer with two years of experience in both front-end and back-end web development,\" Harmon wrote on LinkedIn , suggesting he could \"help high performing teams build disruptive solutions.\"By the summer of 2021, months after his brother's conviction, Gary Harmon indulged in a high-rolling lifestyle. According to the DOJ, in one weekend in June, Harmon spent $25,000 to book a five-hour \"whale room\" at a Miami nightclub, put down $15,000 in dancer fees and bought $100,000 in single-dollar bills using the Bitcoin transfers. (Those he'd use to fill a bathtub, setting the stage for the photo at the top of this story.)But he was worried: \"Anxiety just went thru the rough [],\" Gary Harmon texted a friend on June 14, 2021.\"About what?\" the friend said.\"Just blowing money bring to [] much heat to me.\"Harmon was indicted 14 days later, on June 28, 2021, on eight counts of money laundering, one count of obstruction and one count of removing property to prevent seizure. He was arrested exactly a month later.Following the DOJ's recommendation to the court that Harmon be sentenced for \"51 to 63 months,\" he is set to finish his prison term in the summer of 2027."

On the other hand, Bitcoin borrowers can only bet on the decline of the cryptocurrency's price.\n\nOKX stablecoin/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nThe above chart shows that OKX traders' margin lending ratio increased between April 17 and April 30. That is somewhat concerning, as it shows that leverage has been used to support the Bitcoin price gains.\n\nMoreover, the 43% ratio favoring BTC longs on April 27 was the highest level in 40 days, indicating overexcitement as Bitcoin flirted with $30,000, which adjusted to 32% after the latest correction to $28,400.\n\nTo exclude externalities that might have solely impacted the margin markets, traders should analyze the long-to-short metric. The metric gathers data from exchange clients\u2019 positions on the spot, perpetual and quarterly futures contracts, thus offering better information on how pro traders are positioned.\n\nRelated: What the Gensler hearing means for US crypto regulation and policy\n\nBTC derivatives markets show no signs of bearishness\n\nThere are occasional methodological discrepancies between different exchanges, so readers should monitor changes instead of absolute figures.\n\nExchanges' top traders Bitcoin long-to-short ratio. Source: Coinglass\n\nEven though Bitcoin failed to break the $30,000 resistance, professional traders have increased their leveraged long positions using futures, according to the long-to-short indicator.\n\nAt crypto exchange OKX, the long-to-short ratio sharply increased, from 0.66 on April 27 to 0.93 on May 1. Moreover, at Binance, the long-to-short ratio also increased, favoring longs, moving from 1.12 on April 25 to a 1.26 peak on April 30.\n\nTherefore, despite the 5% price decline from a high of $29,970 on April 30, the bears using futures contracts were not confident enough to add leveraged shorts. Simply put, even if Bitcoin retests $28,000, bulls should not yet throw in the towel, as both margin and futures market indicators remain healthy.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Combining ordinals with ZK technology: The future of 'smart' Bitcoin? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The rise of ordinals on Bitcoin (BTC) has opened many doors for developers and users. By permanently inscribing data on the Bitcoin blockchain, digital objects like art can have verifiable ownership. However, not only digital art objects can benefit from this development. Domain addresses are also possible using this technology.\n\nUntangling public wallet keys\n\nSending and receiving transactions over the blockchain has many advantages. Some of these include the verifiability of transactions and the immutability of the blockchain. Thanks to the blockchain, digital value can be transacted in perpetuity, like a person handing over a physical dollar bill to someone else.\n\nHowever, using the technology is not so simple for everyone. Users need a certain amount of knowledge about how blockchain and their wallets work, and they also need to know how to securely send crypto to a wallet.\n\nOne of the difficulties users might experience is that public keys can be quite intimidating. They are long strings of seemingly random numbers and letters. One mistake and the crypto is either lost or ends up in the wrong wallet. And with the immutability of the blockchain, there is no way to get it back.\n\nWhere there is a need, developers get to work. One of the popular projects that aim to make crypto transactions more user-friendly is Ethereum Name Service (ENS). This platform turns these complicated wallet addresses on Ethereum into easily readable domain names, just like any website.\n\nFor a long time, however, it was impossible to integrate a comparable solution for the Bitcoin network.\n\nA step toward \u2018smart\u2019 Bitcoin\n\nThis all changes with BTCDomain. The platform uses ordinals and zk-STARKs, short for \u201czero-knowledge Succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge,\u201d to generate unique domain addresses that can be used on the Bitcoin network. But how does it work under the hood?\n\nIn essence, ordinals are unique inscriptions in transactions on the Bitcoin network. In this way, ordinals are verifiable using a blockchain explorer. BTCDomain uses this approach to associate Bitcoin domain addresses. The platform contains all the necessary metadata within a Bitcoin transaction. When a user sends BTC to one of the registered domains, for example, \u201csatoshi.btc,\u201d the platform resolves the underlying public key so that the BTC ends up at the correct address.\n\nTo ensure that this happens correctly, users should be able to trust that the system is resolving the transaction correctly. This is where the zk-STARK technology comes in.\n\nOne of the options is for users to run a full Bitcoin node in combination with an ordinal database on their own machine. While this is possible, it requires some technical skills and time. BTCDomain solves this problem by resolving a transaction using the resources of the platform. It inspects each Bitcoin transaction and generates a zero-knowledge proof. Users can then confirm that the domain address holds the underlying public key they are sending BTC to.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, with the latest Miami update, BTCDomain now allows users to inscribe their own website on the Bitcoin network. Thanks to the update the platform can automatically resolve domain names to the dedicated web2 website. For example, if a user owns ordinal.btc and builds an html file and inscribes it on the Bitcoin network, BTCdomain can automatically show this website on ordinal.btc.page.\n\nCriticism against ordinals\n\nHowever, the use of ordinals on Bitcoin has drawn criticism. Due to its growing popularity, the network\u2019s activity increased significantly. In turn, this led to higher transaction fees, leading critics to oppose the use of the Bitcoin network for anything other than financial transactions. Founder of BTCDomain Jay Lee is a firm believer that it is everyone\u2019s own choice what they do with Bitcoin: \u201cEveryone could always use Bitcoin as a financial transaction chain. We (who believe in \u2018smart\u2019 Bitcoin) don\u2019t affect any original use of Bitcoin. Someone might argue ordinals have pushed transaction fees higher. But we are in a free market. Whoever pays the highest gas fee rate gets included in a block. It is fair.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lee, BTCDomain brings \u201csmart Bitcoin\u201d closer by showing developers that it is possible to build trustless applications that rely only on Bitcoin. This could lead to a thriving decentralized finance sector built on the Bitcoin blockchain in the future.\n\nLearn more about BTCDomain"

        "title": "Bitcoin metrics to the moon: ATH for hash rate, daily transactions and Ordinals - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "A lot of Bitcoin (BTC) miners just came online. The Bitcoin hash rate, or the total computing power of the Bitcoin blockchain, just soared to 439 exahashes per second (EH/s). Moreover, the number of transactions processed on the Bitcoin blockchain in one day exceeded 682,000, with over 300,000 Ordinals inscribed.\n\nThe hashrate, in orange, soars to 439 EH/s. Source: timechainstats.\n\nThese milestones demonstrate the network\u2019s strength and stability, and the increasing adoption of Bitcoin for various use cases, all while the United States banking sector fractures.\n\nThe Bitcoin hash rate, a measure of the computational power dedicated to securing the blockchain, has reached an all-time high, signifying increased confidence in the network\u2019s security. The hash rate is a crucial indicator of the network\u2019s health, with a higher hash rate meaning more miners are participating, thus making the network more resistant to attacks.\n\nThe surge in the hash rate reflects growing investments in mining infrastructure despite fluctuations in Bitcoin\u2019s price. More territories and regions around the world are mining Bitcoin \u2014 with increasing amounts of renewable energy \u2014 allaying fears of centralization or environmental impacts that have shrouded Bitcoin mining in the past.\n\nHowever, as Denver Bitcoin, a well-known Bitcoin miner with Upstream Data, highlighted, the hash rate surge may be short-lived. It\u2019s important to \u201cwatch 1500-block to 5k-block avg time to get an understanding of true hashrate,\u201d he shared in a tweet:\n\nSometimes 20-100 blocks get found in quick succession, \u201ccurrent hashrate\u201d readout on websites will show crazy number like 450Eh/s.\n\nAlways watch 1500-block to 5k-block avg time to get an understanding of true hashrate.\n\n\n\nAll based on blocktimes there\u2019s no query of \u201ctotal hashrate.\u201d pic.twitter.com/ijgNsrwzIX \u2014 Adam O (@denverbitcoin) May 2, 2023\n\nThe hash rate may be temporarily surging\u2013partly driven by a resurgence in the popularity of Bitcoin ordinal inscriptions. Bitcoin Ordinals are unique, nonfungible tokens built on the Bitcoin network, each representing a distinct position in the Bitcoin blockchain. Each ordinal is \u201cinscribed\u201d on a satoshi (the smallest denomination of Bitcoin), and owners can prove digital ownership of their sats.\n\nOrdinals have gained traction among collectors, investors and enthusiasts, offering a new way to engage with the Bitcoin ecosystem. For example, Bitcoin Ordinals fan Dan Held shares that altcoin advocates are engaging with Bitcoin for the first time due to the inscriptions.\n\nOrdinals reach 3 million inscriptions. Source: Dune\n\nThe number of inscriptions in a 24-hour period exceeded 350,000 on May 1, as the total number of Ordinals exceeded 3 million. Given that each Ordinal inscription also counts as a transaction, the number of Bitcoin transactions has also soared.\n\nDaily transactions reach 682,000. Source: timechainstats\n\nAs more people buy, sell and trade Bitcoin Ordinals, the number of daily transactions on the network has significantly increased to 682,000. The mempool, or the \u201cwaiting area\u201d for incoming transactions before they are confirmed, is currently very busy. The cheapest transaction fee sits at 8 satoshis per byte, about $0.30, which is well above its lows of 1 satoshi per byte. If users want to send money to wallets on the Bitcoin base chain, the costs are significantly higher than usual due to the surging number of Ordinal inscriptions.\n\nRelated: \u200b\u200bBitcoin Ordinals community debates fix after inscription validation bug\n\nFor some, Bitcoin Ordinals offer another role for the network that goes above its activities as a store of value and medium of exchange. For others, such as Adam Back, Ordinals are useless.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin in Senegal: Why is this African country using BTC?"

As of the time of publication, that figure now exceeds the $6.5 million mark.\n\nFees spent on inscribing Ordinal NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain. Source: Dune Analytics\n\nThe investment firm also believes that Ordinals and the \u201cvelocity of NFT adoption\u201d could also attract new Bitcoin users and spark more development on the Bitcoin network.\n\n\u201cWe believe the emergence of ordinals is likely to promote a development-oriented community and culture in support of the Bitcoin network.\u201d\n\nOn April 30, Ordinals reached a new record, with the number of daily inscriptions topping 300,000.\n\nAround the same time, the number of Bitcoin transactions neared peaks not seen in a number of years, according to blockchain data firm IntoTheBlock.\n\nRelated: Magic Eden launches marketplace for Bitcoin Ordinals\n\nThe meteoric rise of Ordinals has been a controversial topic in the wider Bitcoin community, with Bitcoin maximalists extensively criticizing them for straying from the original purpose of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic currency and clogging up valuable block space.\n\nOne such critic is Blockstream CEO Adam Back, who has declared Ordinals to be \u201cuseless\u201d and saythat he is \u201cmore into Bitcoin as a currency.\u201d"

The company also announced new Online Portal features, including the ability to pay credit cards, taxes and other household bills directly with bitcoin, as well as purchase gift cards from hundreds of popular retailers with bitcoin.\n\n\n\nKey highlights\n\nGross profit of $1.1 million (Q1 2022 - $1 million) with a gross margin improvement to 9%. The increased gross margin is a result of a changing product mix, with more higher-margin ATM sales in Q1 2023 relative to prior periods. Bitcoin Well continued to see strong ATMs volumes throughout the quarter, with a company record number of ATM transactions in the month of March 2023.\n\nBitcoin Well recorded Adjusted EBITDA of negative $0.22 million (Q1 2022 - negative $1.5 million). Changes in the unrealized value of our cryptocurrency loans and digital assets may result in significant swings in net income which are not indicative of the underlying operational performance of the business. We present Adjusted EBITDA to exclude the variability caused by the revaluations and other items not expected to recur in normal operations.\n\nApproximately 3,800 unique users in the Online Portal (Q4 2022 - 2,500) an improvement of 52%. Associated Online monthly revenues exceeded $369,000 (Q4 2022 - $190,000), maintaining continued growth in the product since launched in Q4 2022.\n\nCanadians can now also buy gift cards and pay credit cards, taxes and household bills with bitcoin through the Online Portal at bitcoinwell.com/app\n\nFinancial overview\n\nFor the three months ended, March 31,\n\n2023 March 31,\n\n2022 % ($000s) ($000s) Change Revenue $12,417 $13,529 (8 %) Gross profit $1,086 $965 13 % Adjusted EBITDA1 $(217) $(1,494) 85 % Total comprehensive loss $(1,006) $(2,184) 54 %\n\n1 See Non-IFRS Measures.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Company\u2019s Q1 2023 revenue decreased to $12.4 million compared to $13.5 million in Q1 2022. Despite the decrease in revenue, gross profit increased to $1.1 million in Q1 2023, compared to $0.9 million in the same time period in the prior year, an improvement of 13%. Adjusted EBITDA improved to negative $0.2 million in Q1 2023 compared to negative $1.5 million in the prior year, an improvement of 71%.\n\nNotably, the Company achieved a 9% Gross Margin in Q1 2023 compared to a 7% Gross Margin in Q1 2022, resulting from a relative increase in higher-margin ATM sales in the quarter.\n\n\u201cWe have been working hard to maintain consistency across our existing cash flow generating business units, being ATMs and OTC (Bitcoin Well Infinite), despite the volatile crypto markets, all while still achieving strong growth in the Online Portal in terms of users and revenue. This is displayed in our Q1 2023 results, and we are staying committed to continuing this positive trend. We are also excited to see the impact of the planned expansion to the USA, announced March 28, 2023 , to our existing cash flowing units in the coming periods,\u201d said Luke Thibodeau, CFO.\n\nProduct advancements\n\nBitcoin Well has successfully incorporated the ability for users in Canada, USA, India, the EU and other countries around the world to purchase gift cards to popular retailers\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin Well has successfully incorporated the ability for users in Canada, USA, India, the EU and other countries around the world to purchase gift cards to popular retailers including Amazon, Uber, Air Canada and more using bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies into the Online Portal. This is done through a partnership where Bitcoin Well will receive a portion of the margin earned on each transaction.\n\n\u201cThe ability to use bitcoin to buy gift cards is an important part of bitcoin usability. We are a long ways away from merchants accepting bitcoin natively, and this helps bridge the gap and make bitcoin more usable in the meantime,\u201d said Adam O\u2019Brien, CEO of the Company. \u201cThis additional functionality cements us as a leader in giving people the convenience of modern banking (easy ways to use money) with the benefits of bitcoin (self custody).\u201d\n\nAlso released this month, Canadian users at bitcoinwell.com/app can now pay their household bills, taxes and credit cards with bitcoin.\n\nEffective immediately, any payee that accepts payment through the Canadian bill payment network can be paid with bitcoin through the Bitcoin Well Online Portal.\n\n\u201cThe Bitcoin Well Online Portal has the most functionality in the country!\u201d Adam O\u2019Brien continued. \u201cWith our bill payments and gift card functionality, bitcoin just got a whole lot more useful.\u201d\n\nOther updates\n\nLastly, on May 1, 2023, the Company agreed to amendments to the Convertible Debenture issued on February 23, 2022. Amendments include an adjustment to the conversion price, which is now $0.25 (from $0.30), an amended interest rate of Prime + 6.2% (formerly 10% per annum), and an amendment to the term of the loan, which now extends to five (5) years from the issue date (formerly three (3) years from the issue date). These amendments are subject to regulatory approval.\n\nNon-IFRS measures\n\nThe Company uses certain terms in this news release and within the MD&A, such as \u2018Adjusted EBITDA\u2019, which do not have a standardized or prescribed meaning under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and accordingly, these measurements may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measurements used by other companies.

Discover SCENE\n\nEx-Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan today said that he has now settled a high-profile Bitcoin bet made in March by donating $1.5 million of his own money. And he\u2019s done it to prove a point, he says, that the U.S. economy is in such bad shape, people will flock to cryptocurrency instead.\n\nSrinivasan initially announced a $1 million bet in March, claiming that the global economy is on the edge of rapid change, and as a result, we will see the rapid adoption of Bitcoin\u2014which he calls \u201chyperbitcoinization.\u201d\n\nThe original bet was made with Twitter pundit James Medlock and stipulated that if Bitcoin failed to hit $1 million within 90 days, he would receive $1 million in Circles USDC stablecoin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nToday, he said the bet had been \u201cclosed out by mutual agreement\u201d and settled early, giving $500,000 to poverty charity Give Directly, $500,000 to Bitcoin core developers, and $500,000 to Medlock.\n\n\u201cSo, I settled the bet ahead of time and donated even more than I had committed,\u201d he wrote today on Twitter. \u201cI spent my own money to send a provably costly signal that there\u2019s something wrong with the economy, and that it's not going to be a \u2018soft landing\u2019 like Powell [Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell] promises\u2014but something much worse.\u201d\n\nWhile it could be viewed as ultimately conceding the bet, he claimed that his reasoning for donating the money before the 90-days were up is that he \u201cbelieves in the public good, but unfortunately we can't rely on the public sector anymore to tell us when something's wrong.\u201d\n\nI just burned a million to tell you they're printing trillions. pic.twitter.com/pX5622rjUO \u2014 Balaji (@balajis) May 2, 2023\n\nSrinivasan insists that the American economy will enter hyperinflation and Bitcoin will be a go-to safe haven\u2014eventually hitting a market cap of $19.3 trillion. Bitcoin now has a market cap of $555 billion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading for $28,827, according to CoinGecko, meaning it would have to shoot up in value by 3,369% to hit $1 million per coin.\n\nThe asset is currently vauled 58% less than its November 2021 all-time high of $69,044. But in May 2013, it was priced at $123.10, meaning that over a decade, the original digital currency has appreciated by 23,317%.\n\nSrinivasan went on to say that economic catastrophe was coming and that he made the donations to make the point that \u201cthings could unwind very fast.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany things are breaking at once,\u201d he continued, referring to the U.S. debt ceiling, the banking crisis, bonds losing value, and the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\n\u201cI just burned a million to tell you they\u2019re printing trillions.\u201d"

        "content": "Two high profile cryptocurrency exchanges, Coinbase and Gemini, have both gone live with offshore cryptocurrency derivatives platforms. The platforms are not available to U.S.-based clients, and both have been accused by the U.S. regulator, the SEC, of trading unregistered securities. Coinbase\u2019s approach is considerably more conservative.\n\nYesterday Gemini said that Gemini Foundation is now live and trading dollar-based perpetual futures for Bitcoin with up to 100 times leverage. According to the fine print, Gemini Foundation is governed by Singapore law, although Gemini has no Singapore licenses. Singapore does not have a licensing regime for crypto derivatives, but spot trading is a different matter. Notably, the futures are not available in Europe or the U.K.\n\nTurning to Coinbase, it said it landed a license in Bermuda last month and today announced its Coinbase International Exchange is now live and supports perpetual futures for Bitcoin and Ethereum. By crypto standards, the leverage it initially offers of 5x is conservative compared to Gemini\u2019s and Binance\u2019s of up to 125x. It also is currently restricting access to institutional clients.\n\nCoinbase positioned its launch as part of its \u2018Go Broad, Go Deep\u2019 strategy, unveiled almost a year ago, aiming to offer a crypto gateway in every country.\n\nThe exchange was keen to emphasize that it was not involved in proprietary trading on the platform, only market makers.\n\nCrypto derivatives dwarf the spot market\n\nWhen FTX collapsed last year, it was one of the biggest players in the derivatives market, where Binance has long held the first position. Coinbase is currently the second largest spot crypto exchange, with daily turnover of around $1 billion in the past 24 hours. Binance\u2019s normalized daily spot turnover is $4 billion, but its derivatives figure is almost $37 billion.\n\nSEC Wells notice to Coinbase\n\nFollowing the collapse of FTX and other crypto organizations last year, the SEC has ramped up enforcement activities, especially as it now has some useful legal precedents.\n\nThe SEC sent Coinbase a Wells notice, a warning of potential legal action. That\u2019s because Coinbase is not a regulated exchange but, in the SEC\u2019s view, it trades securities. The SEC considers most cryptocurrencies as securities. The crypto exchange responded publicly last week.\n\n\u201cWe want to see a clear market structure for trading crypto securities. Not all crypto assets are securities,\u201d said Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work with multiple regulators to make this industry safe and trusted. And a Well\u2019s notice at this stage, when there is not a clear rulebook, is not constructive. And it\u2019s not good for America. We are prepared to defend that position in court.\u201d\n\nChief Legal Officer said it has repeatedly asked the SEC for its views on how securities laws apply to Coinbase but said it had \u2018mostly\u2019 had no response."

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoiners are eying up crypto held by the feds.\n\nOn Wednesday, the price of Bitcoin took a sharp nosedive\u2014plunging 7% in an hour. It took most of the crypto market with it, too.\n\nThe dip came shortly before erroneous reports claimed blockchain analytics firm Arkham had said wallets linked to defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox and the U.S. government had moved large amounts of Bitcoin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt turned out to be a false alarm as a result of the DB Newswire account on Twitter mislabelling wallets on Arkham's platform, the company later said in a statement. But it led some to believe that the dip in prices came because the government started dumping large amounts of Bitcoin into the market.\n\nToday we fixed a bug related to Bitcoin alerts that caused us to no longer under-send alerts to a small subset of user\u2019s private labels. This was one of them. This fix won\u2019t affect any additional users, and was unrelated to labels generated by Arkham \u2014 we understand the impact\u2026 https://t.co/VqbX04J2bM \u2014 Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) April 26, 2023\n\nBut the fact remains that the government-owned Bitcoin and Mt. Gox coins are intriguing to investors: On Thursday, another blockchain analytics firm, Glassnode, said that the American government and the Mt. Gox trustee hold 205,514 and 137,890 Bitcoins respectively (over $10 billion in crypto)\u2014and advised investors to keep an eye on the funds.\n\nThis is because when such large amounts of Bitcoin get transferred, it's market moving, according to experts.\n\nBut first, why does the U.S. government hold Bitcoin? And what\u2019s Mt. Gox?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Department of Justice last year seized more than $3 billion worth of Bitcoin affiliated with the dark net marketplace Silk Road. They then sold a huge chunk of it\u2014and said they plan to sell more.\n\nMt. Gox, on the other hand, was a popular Bitcoin exchange that was forced to shut down eight years ago after a crippling hack. Once one of the biggest exchanges in the world, it closed in 2014 after losing 850,000 Bitcoins (today worth $24.9 billion) in the massive exploit.\n\nAccording to our data, the US government and the Mt. Gox trustee hold 205,514 and 137,890 #BTC, respectively. Monitor their balances and set alerts for coin movements in Studio. US government chart: https://t.co/cfQFqSfN0m\n\nMt.

Or sell them off? If so, will they do it in a manner that reduces impact on the market or just dump in one go? Or auction them off? Who knows.\u201d\n\nThe fascination with watching the wallets where Mt. Gox funds are being held is similar, he added. \u201cI believe Mt. Gox is somewhat similar in that there are various unknowns,\" Ono said. \"At some point the coins will be released into the wild but no one really knows when and how.\u201d\n\nWhile Glassnode lead analyst James Check said that big investors may be interested in government coins.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPeriodically, the U.S. government auctions off these coins, which institutions in particular often find quite attractive, since they are in theory blessed and cleared by the U.S. government,\u201d he said. In the past, some institutions have fretted over the provenance of crypto assets when buying them and worried they could be unknowingly buying from bad actors.\n\nWhatever happens, investors are always keeping an eye on big HODLers\u2014known as whales\u2014especially unorthodox ones like the U.S. government.\n\n\u201cRoughly 10 billion dollars of bitcoin is an immense amount for the market to absorb,\u201d Evan Kaloudis, the developer behind Zeus, a non-custodial Lightning wallet, told Decrypt. \u201cI for one, though, am excited for the government to offload them to the market to circulate to new holders.\u201d\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to clarify that the \"Mt. Gox alert\" was the result of user error and not a \"bug fix\" by Arkham as initially reported."

        "title": "How and why bitcoin ATMs help the underbanked - ATM Marketplace",
        "content": "Do bitcoin ATMs helped the unbanked and underbanked? And what role do regulations and cash usage play?\n\nOne topic that comes up at times with cryptocurrency is whether it will see widespread adoption among the underbanked. Since usually it requires some form of digital payment to purchase bitcoin, this could hold back the market for unbanked. However, bitcoin ATMs are providing a key service for this group.\n\nSince bitcoin ATMs often are cash only, they provide a simple tool for the unbanked and underbanked to use with cash payments. This is actually playing out when one looks at the data of countries that use a lot of cash and the number of bitcoin ATMs.\n\nTradingbrowser.com, a crypto trading guide and exchange reviews company, recently published a study that took a look at bitcoin ATMs and found that countries with high numbers of unbanked populations also had larger numbers cryptocurrency adoption and bitcoin ATMs.\n\nFor example, 42% of Romania's population is unbanked, but more than 300,000 residents own cryptocurrency and there are 156 bitcoin ATMs within the country. In addition, 9% of all payments in Romania are made with cash. In addition, Bulgaria, which has 74% cash payments has 33 bitcoin ATMs.\n\nHowever, the opposite was true in countries with low rates of cash payment, such as Sweden, where only 1% of all transactions are made in cash and the country has no bitcoin ATMs installed.\n\nThis trend doesn't follow every country, as Hong Kong has 147 bitcoin ATMs and only does 4% of payments in cash.\n\n\"The rise of bitcoin ATMs and cash payments as key drivers of adoption is a testament to the need for accessible and user-friendly infrastructure that can facilitate the seamless integration of cryptocurrency into everyday transactions,\" a spokesperson for Tradingbrowser said in an email. \"It is worth noting that the high rates of unbanked populations in certain countries are a major contributing factor to cryptocurrency adoption rates. This highlights the need for innovative and inclusive financial services that can cater to underserved populations and empower them with greater financial autonomy and flexibility.\"\n\nHowever, the data raises a number of questions, such as what other factors could be driving bitcoin and bitcoin ATM adoption in countries with large numbers of unbanked citizens? What role do regulations play? To learn more about this, ATM Marketplace reached out to Daniel Larsson, senior editor at Tradingbrowser.com in an email interview.\n\nQ. The data shows unbanked countries having a higher number of bitcoin ATMs. Why do you think this is the case?\n\nA. We think it's a lack of traditional banking infrastructure and the need for alternative financial solutions that have pushed the installation of these Bitcoin ATMs in highly unbanked countries. For nations that mostly depend on cash, Bitcoin ATMs seem to provide a more accessible and user-friendly way of transacting with cryptocurrencies.\n\nQ. How does bitcoin benefit the underbanked?\n\nA. Since blockchain is a decentralized network, unbanked people do not have to go through a centralized system such as a bank in order to transfer value in a secure way. Bitcoin transactions are also much faster and in many ways cheaper than traditional banking transactions, making it an easier way to conduct financial transactions.\n\nQ.Do regulations play a role here? In other words, are underbanked countries softer on crypto regulations?\n\nA. From our point of view, regulations may play a role in the adoption of cryptocurrency in unbanked countries since many of these nations have fewer regulations or more permissive regulations regarding blockchain and cryptocurrency. However, this depends on the nation as we've also seen highly unbanked countries with more strict regulations toward cryptocurrency to avoid fraud and money laundering.\n\nQ.Do you see bitcoin ATMs growing in underbanked countries? Why or why not?\n\nA. Yes, we do. If the trend persists and there are no barriers put in place by governments there should be no reason for these bitcoin ATMs to keep providing financial support in unbanked nations. Also, as more people become aware of these ATMs, the demand is likely to increase. Additionally, as the infrastructure for traditional banking in regions with highly unbanked populations does not change overnight we can speculate that in the growth of bitcoin ATMs will continue in the near term."

The Fed is hiking rates despite increasing signs of an inbound recession, while a more pressing danger comes in the form of the lingering banking crisis from March.\n\nAs of May 1, First Republic Bank (FRB), shares of which plunged 75% in April alone, is being placed under public receivership by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Lenders, including PNC Financial Services Group, JPMorgan Chase and Citizens Financial Group, were among the banks bidding for FRB, with JPMorgan ultimately taking over.\n\nReports previously indicated that the deal should have been completed and announced before the start of Asia trading, but this took longer, being announced at approximately 8:00 am UTC.\n\nFirst Republic seized by California regulator, JPMorgan to assume all deposits.

        "content": "As the debt ceiling crisis looms, bond and equity markets are feeling the jitters. Investors are anxious about the possibility of a historic default, but amidst the chaos, there may be a glimmer of hope for one asset: Bitcoin. Let\u2019s dive in!\n\nMarket Scene\n\nThe banking crisis shows no signs of abating, with First Republic Bank becoming the latest casualty, sending shockwaves through the market. However, to everyone\u2019s surprise, this bad news did not tank the market. Instead, it sparked a rally in the bitcoin and altcoins market, just like the last banking crisis.\n\nLast time, the feds intervened to save the day, but this time the US Government refused to step in, leaving everyone wondering how the banking crisis would play out.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty were concerns about several dormant BTC whales and ETH addresses that suddenly became active. While this is not uncommon, the sudden surge in activity raised suspicion.\n\nCould someone have found a way to compromise old wallets? Or were people arrested during the Silk Road era finally accessing their old funds?\n\nStaying vigilant about potential sell pressure and security risks is always essential.\n\nJust as the market seemed to be recovering midweek, a curious market dump occurred, attributed to alerts that Mt Gox and US Government wallets were moving funds, causing panic among investors. While it turned out to be a false alarm, the funds in question will eventually hit the market, leaving many wondering if another dump will follow.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will announce its latest interest rate decision on May 3rd, and investors anticipate a 0.25% increase. As this is the most probable outcome, we can expect it to have a neutral to positive impact on both the crypto and general financial markets.\n\nSource: The Block\n\nHowever, given the decreasing correlation between cryptocurrencies and major stock indices, the impact may be closer to neutral.\n\nOne area of concern we need to monitor closely is the amount of leverage in the crypto market. The recent sudden price dip was primarily caused by nearly $200 million of liquidations, mainly from leveraged long positions.\n\nThe crypto exchange, OKX, saw over $52 million in bitcoin futures liquidations on its platform, while Binance followed with $38 million in liquidations. Meanwhile, BitMEX witnessed the most significant single liquidation order, a bitcoin/tether trade worth $6 million.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nThe high level of leverage in the crypto market is a cause for concern because even minor positive or negative news can result in significant price fluctuations caused by cascading liquidations or massive short squeezes.\n\nThe Regulatory Scene\n\nThe regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the U.S. government is continuing its push to exert greater control over the industry.\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has warned that anonymity in crypto represents a national security threat, a stance that could signal future strict policies.\n\nBesides, the CFTC has also suggested a potential settlement in the ongoing lawsuit against Binance. However, many other players in the crypto space are also facing lawsuits, including Binance\u2019s CEO, CZ.\n\nMoreover, this heavy regulation is already significantly impacting industry players, with Binance.US pulling out of a deal with Voyager due to regulatory concerns. Circle\u2019s CEO has also hinted at the possibility of the company exiting the U.S. market, and Bybit has recently imposed mandatory KYC procedures.\n\nHowever, not all industry players are willing to submit to government overreach without a fight. Coinbase has filed a lawsuit against the SEC to obtain regulatory clarity on cryptocurrencies, and Bittrex has also indicated its intent to contest the SEC\u2019s charges against them.\n\nToday, we filed a narrow action in the U.S. Circuit Court to compel the SEC to respond \u201cyes or no\u201d to a rulemaking petition we filed with them last July asking them to provide regulatory guidance for the crypto industry. 1/4 https://t.co/rlsS1DIFfl \u2014 paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) April 25, 2023\n\nA South Korean court ruled Terra Classic not to be a security but has indicted Terra co-founder Daniel Shin. It suggests that both the U.S. and South Korea want to make an example out of Do Kwon and save face after many investors suffered losses on Luna.\n\nMeanwhile, Hong Kong is poised to issue crypto company licensing guidelines in May, though it\u2019s uncertain when exactly this will happen. Hong Kong has been rapidly moving towards crypto adoption, with officials recently reminding banks to offer services to crypto companies and issuing a demand for such services shortly after.\n\nIMF: The Villain\n\nThe IMF is arguably a controversial player in the global finance arena. Last year in May, the Central Bank of Argentina imposed a comprehensive ban on cryptocurrencies and prohibited institutional access to them.\n\nThis decision adversely affected the Argentine people, who rank 13th globally in crypto adoption due to high inflation and the need for a store of value. In isolation, the ban seems illogical, but Argentina is not operating in isolation. In March, the IMF approved a $45 billion loan to Argentina to tackle the country\u2019s fiscal challenges, with conditions that included a stance against crypto.\n\nEssentially, the IMF forced Argentina to choose between the loan and crypto, leaving them no choice. As a result, the Argentine Congress approved the IMF debt deal, discouraging crypto use. The IMF\u2019s actions demonstrate its reluctance to let countries break free from the fiat system for which it is responsible.\n\nThe government of Argentina recently published a Letter of Intent entitled \u201cStrengthening financial resilience,\u201d which discourages the use of cryptocurrencies to prevent money laundering, informality, and disintermediation. This provision appeases the IMF\u2019s demands, which come with a $45 billion loan to address the country\u2019s pressing fiscal challenges.\n\nArgentina has been a basket case for decades, because it\u2019s uniquely targeted by the US, IMF and the World Bank. Its economy is wrecked by ultimate debt traps, but the politicians and the elites keep making the same mistakes. Quite incredible! pic.twitter.com/s0RsFthf7s \u2014 S.L. Kanthan (@Kanthan2030) April 13, 2023\n\nHowever, this decision is devastating for the people of Argentina, where:\n\nOver 40% of the population lives below the poverty line.\n\nInflation reached as high as 103% in February of this year.\n\nMoreover, with prices of goods and services doubling annually and with crypto off the table, the IMF has prevented a desperate country from exploring new financial opportunities, trapping them as a fiat debt slave.\n\nThe IMF has made no secret of its stance on cryptocurrency.\n\nIn February, the organization voiced its concern about El Salvador\u2019s adoption of Bitcoin, warning against financing Bitcoin purchases through tokenized securities due to fiscal and legal risks.\n\nIt is not an isolated incident; the IMF has a history of targeting countries that turn to cryptocurrency as a solution to their financial woes. For example, a $1.3 billion loan to El Salvador has been stalled for over a year, potentially scrapped due to the country\u2019s adoption of Bitcoin.\n\nThe IMF\u2019s behavior suggests a desire to maintain a fiat monopoly, even at the expense of impoverished nations. The Central African Republic\u2019s adoption of Bitcoin was met with similar resistance from the IMF, citing legal, transparency, and economic policy concerns.\n\nHowever, the IMF\u2019s attempts to quash cryptocurrency adoption may prove futile in the long run. Undoubtedly, decentralized, digital, and immutable tech like Bitcoin will prevail against centralized institutions like the IMF.\n\nAlso a year ago, the IMF told El Salvador to stop using bitcoin and focus on fiat debt slavery. Yet it is Argentina that is defaulting today, while El Salvador paid off its bonds. pic.twitter.com/Z7PFT5yRz8 \u2014 Saifedean Ammous (@saifedean) April 24, 2023\n\nNow let\u2019s look at the on-chain data.\n\nStablecoin Market Cap Sees 13th Straight Month of Decline\n\nStablecoins experienced a decline in their market capitalization in April 2023. The total market cap decreased by 1.08% to $131bn, the lowest since September 2021. This trend of decline has persisted for thirteen consecutive months, indicating a sustained decrease in demand for stablecoins.\n\nDespite the decline in market capitalization, stablecoin trading volume grew by 13.6% in March 2023, reaching a value of $775bn.\n\nSource: CCData\n\nThis growth was primarily due to several stablecoins losing their peg during the month. However, trading volume for April 2023 seems to be on track for a lower monthly figure, with only $365bn traded.\n\nUSDT Dominates Stablecoin Trading Volume\n\nIn contrast to the overall decline in stablecoins market capitalisation, USDT, one of the most widely used stablecoins, experienced a rise in market cap in April 2023. Its market capitalisation increased by 2.03% to $81.5bn, bringing it closer to its all-time high of $83.7bn recorded in May 2022.\n\nSource:CCData\n\nFurthermore, USDT\u2019s market dominance continued to increase for the fifth consecutive month, reaching 62.1% in April \u2013 the highest since April 2021. This data suggests that USDT is gaining more traction in the stablecoin market than other stablecoins.\n\nMoreover, USDT\u2019s dominance is further reflected in its trading volume on centralized exchanges, accounting for 79.0% of all trading volume with stablecoins in April 2023. With 2,931 trading pairs, USDT is the largest counterparty on centralized exchanges, followed by USD with 2,246 trading pairs.\n\nAggregate Market Transitions to Unrealized Profit\n\nThe aggregate market has started 2023 on a solid note, moving out of a phase of unrealized losses and into one of unrealized profits.\n\nThe significant divergence between the amount of supply held in profit and loss indicates this scenario. As a result, there is a growing incentive to take profits.\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nThis shift is also evident in the ratio between the supply in profit and the supply in loss. Moreover, this oscillator has reached escape velocity this year, confirming the move away from a period of loss dominance, which occurred on only 415 out of 4638 trading days (9%).\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nThe price rising above the dense concentration of supply accumulated during the bottoming formation process has mechanically driven this rebound in unrealized profit. We can measure this phenomenon by looking at the 100-day change in profitable supply after major cycle lows in both BTC and the Percent of Circulating terms:\n\n2011 Cycle Low: +1.99M BTC (19.8%)\n\n2015 Cycle Low: +4.94M BTC (32.2%)\n\n2019 Cycle Low: +6.86M BTC (38.4%)\n\n2022 Cycle Low: +4.87M BTC (25.5%)\n\nThe current cycle has seen a comparable volume of supply re-entering a profitable position, indicating a similarly robust floor.\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nAs the market transitions towards a regime of unrealized profit, an increased incentive exists to take profits. Consequently, it may impact future market dynamics as investors decide whether to hold or sell their positions.\n\nReserve of Bitcoin in US Exchanges on the Decline\n\nThe data from CryptoQuant suggests that the Bitcoin reserve at American exchanges is declining, a trend observed across all CEXs in the long term.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nHowever, the decline in reserve appears to be more significant on American exchanges, which may be due to the recent regulatory demands of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe SEC\u2019s recent restrictions may have led American investors to lose confidence in the domestic exchanges, prompting them to shift their Bitcoin holdings to offshore exchanges or personal wallets.\n\nSo, if American policymakers continue to pressure the cryptocurrency industry, they risk hampering its growth and innovation. As the market becomes increasingly global, regulatory burdens in one country may push investors to seek more favorable jurisdictions elsewhere.\n\nTherefore, regulators must balance their oversight with support for the industry to prevent stifling innovation and investment.\n\nBTC Transaction Count Hit 22-Months High\n\nAccording to data from a 30-day moving average, the Transaction Count for Bitcoin has reached a 22-month high, exceeding 682K transactions.\n\nThis metric reflects the number of transactions on the Bitcoin network during a specific period. As such, it is helpful in assessing Bitcoin\u2019s growth and adoption and identifying trends and patterns in transaction activity.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nThe transaction count was low during Bitcoin\u2019s early days due to limited adoption and the network\u2019s infancy. However, as more people began to use Bitcoin, the transaction count snowballed.\n\nBesides, the transaction count is an essential metric for assessing the overall health and activity of the Bitcoin network.\n\nHigh transaction counts indicate a high demand for Bitcoin and show that users use it for various purposes, such as buying and selling goods and services, making investments, or transferring funds.\n\nMoreover, the recent increase in transaction count is significant because scaling solutions like Lightning network and SegWit have been implemented to alleviate pressure on the Bitcoin network and facilitate faster, more efficient transactions.\n\nUndoubtedly, the increase in transaction count is evidence of the success of these scaling solutions and the growing adoption of Bitcoin among users. It also suggests the potential for continued growth and expansion in the cryptocurrency market as more people become interested in Bitcoin.\n\nSell in May and Go Away?\n\nThe \u201cSell in May and go away\u201d principle has been a common practice in traditional finance, but history shows mixed results when it comes to Bitcoin.\n\nWhile the principle doesn\u2019t seem to work for Bitcoin directly, we can see some interesting observations.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nLooking at the chart of Bitcoin\u2019s monthly candles over the last 12 years, we see seven out of twelve May candles were green, indicating positive returns.\n\nHowever, the size of these green candles has been diminishing over time, which could suggest a decline in Bitcoin\u2019s maximum gains.\n\nFurthermore, the last two May candles have been red, indicating a sell-off in May.\n\nWhile this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the principle applies to Bitcoin, it does highlight the potential for some seasonality in the market.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the \u201cSell in May and go away\u201d principle doesn\u2019t just apply to May but suggests moving to cash or less risky assets for the summer months and returning to the market later in the year.\n\nMoreover, additional research into this strategy with Bitcoin may be worth exploring, but for now, it seems that the principle doesn\u2019t strongly impact Bitcoin\u2019s market behavior.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Our popular Altcoin Buzz Access group generates tons of alpha for our subscribers.

        "content": "\n\n\n\nAlso called Bitcoin NFTs, Bitcoin Ordinals, started in December 2022, has been inviting opposing views in the crypto space. The crypto firm Grayscale has recently opened up on the same, stating that Bitcoin Ordinals represent a huge opportunity for Bitcoin adoption and could be an area of optimism.Those opposing Bitcoin Ordinals believe it could harm fungibility or bloat the blockchain. On the other hand, Grayscale believes that it could be an improvement to the Bitcoin network perceived to be rigid.Referring to the opposing views regarding Bitcoin Ordinals, Grayscale stated that even though the concerns were valid, and the original Bitcoin whitepaper did not account for unique digital assets, inscriptions that could reduce fungibility or extra data contributing to blockchain bloat, \u201cStill, ordinals are, in fact, a byproduct of utilizing the Bitcoin blockchain as it exists today and the subsequent crypto innovations that have come since, even if not initially envisioned by Bitcoin's creator.\"The crypto firm Grayscale then went on to detail two opportunities presented by Bitcoin Ordinals which could be beneficial for the Bitcoin network. Firstly, it said that the Bitcoin NFTs could help increase fees for Bitcoin miners.Grayscale mentioned how, once all tokens were mined, miners would not be able to maintain the required hash rate for securing the network since they won't derive enough rewards from the transaction activities. But Bitcoin Ordinals have helped in increasing the fees of such miners, which would enable them to maintain the level of security across the Bitcoin network forever.Grayscale also believes Bitcoin Ordinals could be instrumental in driving Bitcoin adoption by bringing a transformational change to the culture of the Bitcoin community. With increasing NFT adoption on the network, a development-led culture could be established like that in Ethereum. This could be a big change from its stagnant perception from certain quarters. Ordinals witnessed daily inscriptions going to 300,000 on April 30, while Bitcoin transactions have also increased."

        "content": "While Bitcoin (BTC) has continued a downtrend, the asset has recently recorded a high volume in daily transactions nearing its all-time high. According to a report by on-chain analytics provider Glassnode, \u201cBitcoin daily transaction counts are approaching All-time-highs, seeing an explosive uptick in 2023.\u2019\n\nRegardless of this news, Bitcoin has continued to move downward after its weekend plateau of trading at just between $29,300. The asset trading volume has also surged slightly indicating a possible violent sell-off.\n\nBitcoin Records Daily Transactions Nearing Peak Levels\n\nAccording to Glassnode, on the 30-day moving average, Bitcoin daily transactions have reached an amount of 348,700. While the peak level which was seen in 2017 remains at 379,000 transactions per day. This has proved Bitcoin\u2019s daily transactions are beginning to near the all-time high last seen about 5 years ago.\n\nFurthermore, according to the Glassnode report, this surge in Bitcoin daily transactions is thanks to the Ordinal inscriptions. The Ordinal inscriptions also known as Bitcoin non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or Ordinals, are inscriptions (digital artifacts) inscribed on satoshis (sats) \u2013 little units of Bitcoin.\n\nGlassnode noted the inscription accounts for approximately 30% to 40% of mined transactions and 10% to 20% of fees paid. Meanwhile, the remaining majority of transactions are monetary in nature, frequently conducted through exchanges.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, compared to Ordinals activity on the Bitcoin blockchain, BTC exchange activity is relatively low, representing roughly 30% of fees and transactions.\n\nThe trend of creating inscriptions initially gained popularity in February when users started inscribing NFTs on satoshis. However, the recent resurgence has been dominated by inscriptions that are based on text.\n\nGlassnode noted:\n\nBitcoin transaction counts, address activity, Inscriptions, and Mempool congestion are all elevated. As is the degree of HODLing, and supply acquired below $30k. Conviction remains.\n\nBTC Continues Downtrend\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is yet to make any significant move in the past few days. Instead, it has only seemed to pick up from where it left off in its downward trend in recent weeks. Over the past 24 hours, the top crypto has plummeted nearly 4% with a market price of $28,435, at the time of writing.\n\nThis downtrend follows a notable fall from the $30,000 region in recent weeks. So far, Bitcoin has a 24-hour range between a low of $28,315 and a high of $29,944.\n\nMeanwhile, the BTC market cap is still in the green while its trading volume signals selling pressure, indicating a possible continuous bearish trend.\n\nOver the past week, Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization has surged from a low of $528 billion on April 24 to as high as $550 billion as of today. Its trading volume has also spiked from a daily trading volume of $15.4 billion to $19.8 billion, over the same time period.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Pepe coin is the most talked about asset in the crypto market right now. The less than one-month-old meme token has nothing at all to do with Bitcoin, yet shockingly is displaying nearly exact price patterns.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this incredible and unusual chart comparison between BTCUSD and PEPEUSDC.\n\nA Quick Recap Of Pepe Coin And Its Runaway Crypto Success\n\nPepe coin is one of the biggest new meme coins, prompting a massive wave of more meme tokens of all kinds. If you couldn\u2019t tell by the name, much like Dogecoin is associated with the Doge meme, this one features the Matt Furie-created Pepe the Frog.\n\nAnyone who invested in Pepe coin over the last couple of weeks \u201cfeels good, man.\u201d That is because it has risen in value by over 2,500% in 14 days \u2014 numbers that are high even by crypto standards. Most of the supply of holders at this point is in substantial profit. But if the Bitcoin chart is any indication of what\u2019s to come, some serious profit taking could be ahead.\n\nIn the comparison below, we have put the 4-hour PEPEUSDC chart up against the weekly BTCUSD chart. The left chart features two weeks of price action, while the chart on the right shows four full years. Yet they are extremely similar.\n\nBitcoin versus the frog king of the memes | PEPEUSDC on TradingView.com\n\nThe Unusual Bitcoin Comparison Explained\n\nAccording to study of Elliott Wave Principle, markets are fractal and form self-similar, repeating patterns across various degrees of timeframes. Simply put, the same price action and behavior can appear on an hourly or 4H chart as it does on a much higher timeframe.\n\nThe study focuses on mass crowd behavior and human psychology, particularly how it can create clearly definable turning points in financial markets. The two charts looking and behaving so similarly could be due to the same type of speculative behavior.\n\nImportantly, if the comparison is accurate for the reasons discussed, it could indicate that Pepe coin is due for some profit-taking and a correction soon enough. Of course, the meme coin could be nowhere near done and anyone who sells now could be a very, very sad frog.\n\nDid you buy Pepe? Tell us on Twitter.\n\nDid you buy #PEPE?

        "content": "A Bitcoin ATM machine, very much like a traditional ATM, is a physical kiosk. A Bitcoin ATM allows you to purchase Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies using fiat money or a debit card easily and conveniently.\n\nThere are two types of Bitcoin ATMs, unidirectional (one-way) \u2013 one that allows you to only buy Bitcoins and other supported cryptocurrencies, and bi-directional (two-way) \u2013 one that allows you to buy and also sell Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies in exchange for fiat money. Not all Bitcoin ATMs are bi-directional, so you should make sure to check before you use one in case you want to sell Bitcoins.\n\nAlthough they look like traditional ATMs, a Bitcoin ATM is not connected to any bank. They do not allow you to directly withdraw cash from your bank account or deposit fiat money into your bank account.\n\nBitcoin ATMs are connected to the internet and directly create transactions on the blockchain. When you buy Bitcoins (or another cryptocurrency) using fiat money, a transaction is recorded on the blockchain, and the Bitcoins are added to your crypto wallet. When you choose to sell Bitcoins via the ATM, the Bitcoins are removed from your wallet, and the machine dispenses fiat currency."

        "content": "As we approach the midpoint of 2023, many cryptocurrency investors and enthusiasts are wondering if the so-called \"crypto winter\" is over. For those unfamiliar with the term, the crypto winter refers to a prolonged period of decline in cryptocurrency prices that began in late 2017 and lasted well into 2018 and 2019.\n\nDuring this time, many cryptocurrencies lost over 90 percent of their value, and the overall market capitalisation of the crypto space shrank significantly. The crypto winter was a brutal time for investors and enthusiasts, and many people began to wonder if the entire crypto industry was doomed to fail.\n\nHowever, in 2020 and 2021, the crypto market began to rebound. Bitcoin, the largest and most well-known cryptocurrency, surpassed its previous all-time high of nearly $20,000 in late 2020 and went on to reach a new all-time high of over $60,000 in early 2021. Other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, also experienced significant gains during this time.\n\nValuation range\n\nA recent media wire reported that the popular cryptocurrency - bitcoin - could reach $100,000 by the end of 2024, according to Standard Chartered report.\n\nThe oscillations of valuations of the cryptocurrencies has been as volatile as your and my mood swings. No one seems to agree with anyone else on why the Crypto pricing is moving higher. Making a prediction on the value of a currency that is still seen as an outsider by global financial regulators is a challenge. At the same time this week, a senior US regulatory official was quoted mentioning that anonymity of Crypto assets is financing illegal activities.\n\nSo it\u2019s more confusing that there are regulatory concerns and open issues pending solutions. And parallely Crypto pricing is trending upward. On the one hand, the recent bull run has certainly been impressive, and many cryptocurrencies have seen significant gains over the past year or so. Bitcoin, in particular, has once again become a mainstream topic of conversation, with major corporations and institutional investors now getting involved in the space.\n\nInstitutional acceptance\n\nOne of the key indicators of a healthy market is the level of institutional adoption. While there has been some progress in this area, with major financial institutions and companies investing in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, there is still a long way to go.\n\nMany institutional investors remain hesitant to enter the market due to the lack of regulatory clarity and the high level of volatility. Until there is a more stable and regulated market, it is unlikely that there will be a significant increase in institutional adoption.\n\nLaw of Economics\n\nSpecifically, for Bitcoin, economics could help them with pricing booster. Bitcoin could be on the upswing due to the fact that in May 2024, the next Bitcoin-halving milestone occurs.\n\nBitcoin halving is when the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks is cut to half of current levels. This event has been programmed by the bitcoin founder to occur every 210,000 blocks ( averaging to every 4 years). This has been one of artificial inflationary adjustment that Bitcoin has in its algorithm. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have a limited supply,\n\nwith a maximum of 21 million Bitcoins that can ever exist. This scarcity can contribute to an increase in price as people compete to buy a limited amount of coins.\n\nThe most recent Bitcoin halving occurred in May 2020, and its impact on pricing has been a topic of much debate in the cryptocurrency community. Data shows that the previous two halvings have been followed by significant increases in Bitcoin prices Inflation\n\nInflation has been a major concern for many individuals and institutions around the world. As central banks continue to print money and inject it into the economy, the value of fiat currencies has been eroded. This has led many people to look for alternative stores of value, such as cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies are not subject to inflation because their supply is limited by design.\n\nOther forms of acceptance\n\nFurthermore, there are several factors that could suggest that the crypto market is entering a new phase of growth. For example, the recent surge in interest in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has demonstrated the potential for cryptocurrencies to be used in new and innovative ways. Additionally, the increasing number of countries and institutions exploring the creation of their own digital currencies could indicate a growing acceptance of cryptocurrency as a legitimate form of money.\n\nCryptocurrencies are seen by many as an attractive alternate against geopolitical risk. Because cryptocurrencies are decentralised and not subject to the actions of any particular government or institution, they can offer a degree of stability in uncertain times. This is a thesis that only few categories of investors with higher risk-perception can manage.\n\nOfficial acceptance ?\n\nBut is the regulatory concerns on the issue of cryptocurrencies over ?\n\nCryptocurrencies have been a hot topic in the financial world for the past few years, and for good reason. While some people view cryptocurrencies as a revolutionary new way to conduct transactions, others see them as a dangerous and unregulated market that could lead to financial instability. Regulatory concerns regarding cryptocurrencies have been voiced by many governments and financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the G20.\n\nOne of the biggest regulatory concerns regarding cryptocurrencies is their lack of transparency. Unlike traditional financial markets, which are regulated by various government agencies, cryptocurrencies are largely unregulated. This means that there is no one overseeing the market to ensure that it is fair and transparent.\n\nThe global financial regulators and institutions like IMF have warned that cryptocurrencies could pose a threat to financial stability if they were to become more widely used. It fears that cryptocurrencies being highly volatile and could lead to market instability, if their prices were to suddenly drop. Many have expressed concerns about the potential for cryptocurrencies to be used for illegal activities, and called for greater regulation of the market.\n\nSimilarly, the G20 has also expressed concerns about the regulatory implications of cryptocurrencies. In a recent statement, the G20 called for greater regulation of the market to ensure that it is fair and transparent. With cryptocurrencies still in their early stages of development, there is a need for greater clarity regarding their legal status and regulatory framework.\n\nWhile some countries, such as Japan and Switzerland, have taken steps to regulate the market, others have been more cautious. The United States, for example, has yet to provide clear guidance on the legal status of cryptocurrencies, leaving investors uncertain about their rights and responsibilities. Until there is greater clarity from regulators around the world, it will be difficult for the market to fully recover.\n\nGains\n\nThe crypto market is notoriously volatile, and prices can change rapidly and dramatically. Just because cryptocurrencies have seen gains recently doesn't mean that those gains will continue indefinitely. Additionally, there are still significant regulatory and security concerns surrounding cryptocurrencies that could hinder their long-term growth.\n\nit is important to consider the psychological impact of the most recent crypto winter. Many investors lost significant amounts of money during the market downturn, which could make them hesitant to re-enter the market. There is also a risk that the market could experience a \"dead cat bounce,\" where prices briefly rise before falling again. This could further erode investor confidence and make it more difficult for the market to recover.\n\nWhile there are certainly signs that the crypto market is entering a new phase of growth, there are also potential pitfalls that could derail that growth. As always, investors should approach the crypto market with caution and do their research before making any investment decisions.\n\n\u2014 The author, Dr. Srinath Sridharan, is a Policy Researcher & Corporate Advisor.

Almost every other month in recent years, hackers have targeted and stolen millions of dollars in crypto. But what a mysterious hacker recently did, is something we seldom hear of.\n\nA mysterious hacker gained access and stole $300,000 worth of bitcoin belonging to various Russian govt agencies. But that's not it. Instead of using the stolen crypto money, the hacker reportedly donated it to the war-hit nation of Ukraine.\n\nHacker Donates Stolen Crypto To Ukraine\n\nindiatimes\n\nThe crypto experts say that the hacker has transferred the stolen bitcoins to the addresses of Ukrainian volunteers, as per CoinDesk report citing Chainalysis, a cryptocurrency monitoring company that works with the U.S. government.\n\n\n\nThe mystery hacker seems to have been able to put blockchain and bitcoin technologies to work against the aggressor state. Using their arcane skills, the hacker gained access to hundreds of crypto wallets, which likely belonged to Russian law enforcement agencies.\n\nChainalysis analysts reportedly believe that the hacker used a feature of documenting transactions in the bitcoin blockchain to identify 986 wallets controlled by the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (GRU), the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), and the Federal Security Service (FSB), as per a report in The New Voice Of Ukraine, a daily premier news firm in the war-hit country.\n\nAlso Read: 5 Crypto Firms That Filed For Bankruptcy Besides FTX\n\nWhat The Hacker Said In His Messages\n\nThe hacker left messages in Russian to the owners of the wallets, in which he states that these wallets were used to pay for the services of hackers working for Russia.\n\nshutterstock\n\nIt is not known to what extent these allegations are true. Western analysts reportedly consider it indisputable that Russian intelligence services use hackers to conduct numerous operations.\n\n\n\nThey note that at least three of the allegedly Russian wallets have already been linked to Russia by third parties. Two of them were allegedly involved in the Solar winds attack, and the third paid for servers used in Russia's disinformation campaign in the 2016 elections.\n\n\n\nHacking Through 'Inside Work'?\n\nThe hacker seems to have gained control of the wallets, which he claims were controlled by Russian intelligence services, not through hacking, but through \"inside work\".\n\n\"Simply put, this person could have infiltrated the structure of hackers working for Russia, or he could have been an employee of the Russian special services who later became a defector.\n\nThe first hacks were carried out a few weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nThe hacker was initially determined to simply destroy the stolen funds in the wallets of the Russian special services.\n\nHowever, when Russia's war with Ukraine began, the hacker changed tactics. Since the first days of the war, the Ukrainian government has used cryptocurrency to raise millions of dollars for military and charitable purposes.

Basically, the mysterious hacker stopped burning money and started sending it to help Ukraine, Chainalysis said, as per the report.\n\n\n\n\"The fact that the OP_RETURN sender was both willing and able to burn hundreds of thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of bitcoin in order to spread their message makes it more likely in our opinion that their information is accurate,\" the analysts concluded.\n\nAlso Read: 22-YO Shubham Saini's Tea Stall Accepts Crypto Payments\n\nFor more such interesting content and the latest financial news, keep reading Worth.

        "content": "Jack Dorsey, after resigning as Twitter CEO in 2021, shifted his focus toward building Block, a Web3-friendly financial services company. In a fresh update from Dorsey's Block, the Bitcoin mining chip that this newly founded company has been working on, has entered the prototype stage. The former Twitter chief is hinged at decentralising Bitcoin mining and taking it out of the hands of a few established platers. This chip being designed by Block will make Bitcoin mining easily accessible for more individual miners, as well as up and coming crypto mining firms.\n\nDorsey's prototype design showcases a new five-nanometre (5nm) Bitcoin mining chip. When this project started, Dorsey's focus was to develop custom silicon that is essential to facilitate Bitcoin mining and he is marching ahead towards launching this chip soon.\n\n\u201cWe plan to make our Bitcoin mining technology open source where we can. We intend to make it possible for third parties to use our hardware and software solutions for their own further development, by selling standalone application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and hardware components, and providing extensive support and reference resources. We seek to optimise for innovation and maximise the size of the bitcoin mining hardware ecosystem,\u201d said an official blog post from Block.\n\nA team of ASIC designers has been assembled to develop the initial design of the Bitcoin mining chip. Now that this chip has entered its prototype mode, the team behind it has called it a \u2018milestone development'.\n\n\u201cThis is an exciting milestone which will allow us to experiment with design variants, validate our design work, and calibrate our testing on real silicon. We expect to receive the prototypes back this fall. They will be a valuable input into our three nanometer ASIC development work,\u201d Block's post added.\n\nIn recent years, the process of mining Bitcoin has become more difficult with more advanced computers operated by mining companies and independent miners having joined the system.\n\nMiners have to solve complex algorithms on advanced computers to mine a Bitcoin. The mining chips for Bitcoin came into existence to make the otherwise power intensive process, energy efficient.\n\nDorsey's Block is among other tech companies that are now dabbling in the creation of Bitcoin mining chips to slash the high level of centralisation on bitcoin mining ASICs supply, that has been deemed detrimental to Bitcoin miners as well as the network resiliency of the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nLast year in June, Samsung started trials of its three nanometre (nm) foundry processing chip, that would be able to facilitate the mining of Bitcoin.\n\nUS-based chipmaker Qualcomm has also shown interest in taking advantage of Samsung's ASIC chips, Bitcoin Magazine reported.\n\nGaana, JioSaavn, Google Podcasts, Apple Podcasts,\n\nThe Vivo X90 Pro has finally made its debut in India, but is the company's flagship smartphone for 2023 equipped with enough upgrades over its predecessor? We discuss this and more on Orbital , the Gadgets 360 podcast.

        "content": "As we close out Q1 of the year, looking at the crypto market\u2019s performance is important. Crypto has had a great start in 2023, which could indicate what is to come. Some of the major assets on the market are showing positive trends, and if these continue, investors can expect good returns.\n\nDespite various challenges, Bitcoin (BTC) has remained the leading crypto and is currently experiencing an upward trend, surpassing its value from a year ago, further proving its dominance.\n\nHowever, other cryptocurrencies have demonstrated their potential for growth in 2023, and it is worth noting them. Three such coins are Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), and Big Eyes Coin (BIG).\n\nSolana and Avalanche\u2019s 2023 Plans\n\nThis year, the cryptocurrency market has seen an impressive rise from Solana and Avalanche. Within a month at the beginning of the year, Solana and Avalanche witnessed an extraordinary surge, with Solana up by 140% and Avalanche up by 82%.\n\nThese two coins are already considered major players in the crypto market and are expected to launch exciting new plans shortly. Solana has been gaining recognition for its innovative features, including its proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, which ensures network security while allowing for fast transaction processing.Additionally, the platform\u2019s unique architecture allows for horizontal scaling, which means it can handle high transaction volumes without compromising speed or security.\n\nSolana has recently announced a new initiative called \u201cIgnition\u201d, which aims to support the growth and development of projects built on the Solana blockchain. The program will provide funding, technical support, and marketing assistance to promising projects to drive innovation and growth on the Solana platform.\n\nMeanwhile, Avalanche quickly gained popularity for its high transaction speeds and low fees. The platform\u2019s native token, AVAX, has seen significant growth in value since its launch, making it one of the most promising cryptocurrencies in the market. Avalanche\u2019s unique consensus algorithm, Avalanche-X, allows for high-speed transactions while maintaining security and decentralization.\n\nRecently, Avalanche announced its plans to launch a new cross-chain bridge called \u201cAvalanche Bridge,\u201d allowing users to seamlessly move assets between different blockchain networks. The bridge will support various assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others, making it easier for users to move their assets across different networks.\n\nBig Eyes Prepares to Launch\n\nBig Eyes is one of the newest meme coins in the space, but it feels long-established despite still being on the market. Its popularity based on the large community it has already built can be seen from its incredible success in presale alone.\n\nBig Eyes has attractive tokenomics, with 70% of the 200 trillion supply sold to the general public and 5% reserved for charitable purposes in a charity wallet. This unique combination of features has resulted in one of the market\u2019s largest presales for a meme coin ever seen.\n\nInvestors and traders should pay close attention to Big Eyes as the project\u2019s presale will soon end after raising over $34 million, becoming the most significant presale result in recent years. The project is set to launch officially on June 3rd, which has generated considerable anticipation among its fan base. To celebrate this milestone, those who have yet to purchase Big Eyes can take advantage of a limited-time offer of 300% extra tokens using the code END300.\n\nFor All Things Big Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Shalom,\n\nIt's a new week and month! Trust you\u2019re prepared for May because it holds many exciting opportunities. \ud83e\udd17\n\nToday is International Workers' Day, also known as Labour Day or Mayday in some countries.\n\nIt\u2019s a day to recognise your hard work and dedication as a working-class citizen, raise awareness about your rights, and protect you from exploitation.\n\nConsequently, if you have a 9-5 or work remotely in Africa, I'm seizing this moment to appreciate your efforts and wish you a wonderful time and a great workplace culture to thrive and become the best you can be.\n\nEnjoy your holiday as you reflect on your career goals and how far you've come as a worker. \u263a\ufe0f\n\nHere's what I've got for you today:\n\nKenya's Communications Authority's battle to detect fake phones\n\nMTI's CEO to pay $3.4b for Bitcoin fraud\n\nSEC launches Regulatory portal for fintech startups\n\nKenya's Communications Authority's battle to detect fake phones\n\nThe Supreme Court has given the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) permission to revive the device management system (DMS) implementation to detect and combat fake phones.\n\nThis means the communications regulator will install a device on mobile phone networks to detect fakes.\n\nBe the smartest in the room Join 30,000 subscribers who receive Techpoint Digest, a fun week-daily 5-minute roundup of happenings in African and global tech, directly in your inbox, hours before everyone else. Digest Subscription Email First Name Subscribe Give it a try, you can unsubscribe anytime. Privacy Policy.\n\nIn October 2022, the watchdog asked the court to lift the ban that blocked the launch of the DMS in 2018 amid concerns that reviving it would give the government access to more customer data, including calls, messages, and financial activity.\n\nAlso, the apex court dismissed a second appeal from the Law Society of Kenya (LSK) to stop the implementation of the DMS.\n\nThe Society argued that intercepting and recording communications and mobile data would usher in an era of increased governmental control and invasion of personal privacy. However, it could not persuade the Supreme Court to halt its implementation.\n\nA five-judge panel of the Supreme Court ruled that the court does not have jurisdiction to \u201chear and determine the instant petition of appeal.\"\n\nIn 2020, the Court of Appeal permitted the CA to continue developing the DMS. But it stated that the rules or regulations governing its installation should be open to public input.\n\nInsisting that the technology can only detect and record the unique identification number of mobile phones and assigned subscriber numbers, the regulator disputed claims that the DMS can access subscriber phone records, location data, and mobile money transaction information.\n\nThe CA defended the device's installation, claiming it was intended to combat counterfeits by establishing an Equipment Identification Register (EIR).\n\nThe EIR will detect all devices, isolate the illicit ones, and refuse services to fake ones.\n\nThe watchdog also argued that the manufacturers of fake devices had advanced in technology and began attaching genuine International Mobile Equipment Identification (IMEI) numbers to the fakes, which made detection more difficult.\n\nThe CA stated that, in addition to cloning real IMEIs, the next front in the fight against fake devices is SIM boxing.\n\nMTI's CEO to pay $3.4b for bitcoin fraud\n\nCornelius Steynberg. Image source: Criptomercato.it\n\nI mentioned last week that an Acting High Court Judge, Alma de Wet, called South African company, Mirror Trading International (MTI), a \"fraudulent investing scheme.\"\n\nWell, a United States court has directed that Cornelius Johannes Steynberg, the CEO of MTI, pay a total of $3.4 billion \u2014 $1.7 billion in restitution to victims of the fraud scheme and another $1.7 billion as a civil penalty.\n\nAccording to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), that amount represents the highest fraud case involving Bitcoin.\n\nJudge Lee Yeakel in the Western District of Texas authorised the default judgment against Steynberg.\n\nThe CFTC charged Steynberg in 2022 with soliciting Bitcoin from thousands of people online to supposedly run a commodity pool through Mirror Trading.\n\nThe regulator said that the company made claims regarding off-exchange, retail foreign currency trading with participants who were ineligible to trade.\n\nPer the CFTC, Steynberg accepted and misappropriated at least 29,421 Bitcoins from over 1,300 participants in Texas between May 2018 and March 2021, totalling over $1.7 billion in value by the end of the time frame.\n\nAbout 23,000 participants were from the United States overall.\n\nMTI is being liquidated in South Africa, and Steynberg has been imprisoned in Brazil since December 2021, despite being wanted by South African authorities.\n\nPer the court's ruling, MTI is \"liable for fraud in connection with retail foreign currency (forex) transactions, fraud by an associated person with a commodity pool operator (CPO), registration violations, and failure to comply with CPO regulations.\"\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Steynberg is permanently barred from registering with the CFTC and trading in any market the watchdog regulates.\n\nSEC launches Regulatory portal for fintech startups\n\nOn April 28, 2023, the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched the Regulatory Incubation (RI) portal for fintech startups planning to or operating in the Nigerian Capital Market.\n\nAlso, unregistered innovators who need regulation in the fintech space can apply for the RI programme. The deadline for application is May 26, 2023.\n\nStartups focusing on crowdfunding, robo advisory/digital investment advisory, and sub-broker serving multiple brokers via digital platforms can not apply because they fall under different regulations.\n\nAlso, fintech companies that want to apply must have solutions that are applicable to the Nigerian Capital Market and be safe for investors.\n\nThey must also present a genuine innovation that introduces a new product or process to meet specific investor needs, address any current compliance or supervisory issues (optional), and is ready for testing.The decision to open a portal stems from a 2021 agreement announcing the RI programme for fintech companies interested in participating in the Nigerian Capital Market.\n\nLast week on Techpoint Africa\n\nWhat I'm reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nClevertech is looking for a remote Mobile Engineer.

As we approach a critical juncture in the market, a variety of experts have been consulted to provide their insights on the matter.\n\n32 fintech and crypto experts were asked to give their end-of-year price predictions for BTC, suggesting that the asset is expected to perform positively as per a Finder study.\n\nAccording to the results shared with Finbold, the experts suggest that Bitcoin is set to rise as the year progresses, although it will not come close to its all-time high of over $69,000. Indeed the polled finance professionals believe that BTC could reach its peak in 2023 at $35,459.\n\nBitcoin 2023 price prediction.

They predict that Bitcoin will reach $99,781 by 2025 and $297,848 by 2030, which represent a 29% and 58% increase, respectively, from the estimates made by the panelists in January 2023.\n\nWhat the experts say on BTC\n\nAs per the findings of a recent survey, industry experts predict that Bitcoin\u2019s price will continue to surge in the short to medium term.\n\nThe surveyed panelists estimate that Bitcoin\u2019s peak price in 2023 will average around $42,225, with some experts forecasting that it could surpass $50,000. On the other hand, the lowest price Bitcoin could hit in 2023 is expected to average around $17,026, with some panelists projecting it could fall as low as $15,000 or below.\n\nFinance Magnates senior analyst and editor, Damian Chmiel, the expert\u2019s prevailing sentiment is that a higher Bitcoin price is highly likely in the short to midterm.\n\n\u201cAn increase to $50K seems not a bold prediction but rather just a formality,\u201d Chmiel said. \u201cThe recent banking crisis has indeed shown that Bitcoin can be a safe haven in times of uncertainty.

        "content": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC), after a sharp increase on April 25 and 26, BTC underwent days of relative stability, only to drop by over 4% as last weekend came to a close.\n\nIn a tweet on April 30, crypto analyst Ali Martinez put forward an observation regarding Bitcoin\u2019s price direction, highlighting two critical levels that may play a role. Martinez notes that a significant support level is evident, with 1.85 million addresses purchasing 650,000 BTC between the price range of $27,440 and $28,315.\n\nAdditionally, Martinez identifies a key resistance level, with 1.37 million addresses having acquired 530,000 BTC between $29,260 and $30,130. These levels could potentially influence Bitcoin\u2019s future price action.\n\nTo determine the direction of #Bitcoin, keep an eye on these two key levels:\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 1.85M addresses bought 650K $BTC between $27,440 and $28,315, which acts as support.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd34 1.37M addresses bought 530K #BTC between $29,260 and $30,130, which acts as resistance. pic.twitter.com/z3gzPoe0vw \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) April 30, 2023\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin\u2019s price sits at $28,551, placing the digital asset just above the support level mentioned in the tweet.\n\nBitcoin price drops with the start of May\n\nAfter initially rising from $27,400 on April 25, Bitcoin reached a resistance just below $30,000 on April 26, and the coin spent the weekend trying to breach the resistance at $29,260. BTC reached the height of $29,800 on three occasions over the past week \u2014 Once on April 26, another time on April 27, and one last time on April 30.\n\nHowever, with the arrival of the new week, Bitcoin\u2019s price dropped to roughly $28,500, which is where it sits at the time of writing. In the past 7 days, BTC price has grown by 4.13%, but on a 24-hour chart, it is 2.35% down.\n\nBitcoin price chart (last 7 days). Source: Finbold.com\n\nThe price drop comes ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy decision, which is expected to be made on Wednesday, May 3. The uncertainty has caused the majority of crypto assets to trade in the red, moving toward neutralizing the weekly gains seen in the final days of April.\n\nFor now, traders are waiting for one of the levels to break. However, it remains to be seen which level will break first.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice. Investing is speculative.
