        "content": "Crypto asset management company Hashdex has joined the competition for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. The firm has submitted an application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a Bitcoin futures ETF that will hold spot Bitcoin.\n\nETFs are investment funds that trade on a stock market, with their value derived from an underlying basket of assets such as stocks, bonds, commodities and other financial instruments. Similarly, Bitcoin ETFs track BTC\u2019s value and trade on traditional stock exchanges rather than crypto exchanges.\n\nHashdex\u2019s approach differs from recent filings as it won\u2019t depend on the Coinbase surveillance sharing agreement, opting to acquire spot Bitcoin from physical exchanges within the CME market.

        "title": "Bitcoin Miners Look To Coal Ash As Power Demand Surges - OilPrice.com",
        "content": "The Bitcoin market has had a wild ride over the past year. Prices have plummeted, sharply recovered, and then plummeted again over the last ten months, and the future is uncertain for cryptocurrencies overall in the context of an ambivalent regulatory and policy landscape. Amidst all the chaos, one thing about Bitcoin has been steady since the beginning: its ever-expanding energy use and resulting carbon footprint.\n\nThe cryptocurrency world has been in crisis recovery mode since the downfall of FTX, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, toward the end of last year. Since then, regulatory bodies around the world have escalated a crackdown on digital currency firms, while other sectors worried about \u201ccrypto contagion\u201d leading to a widespread economic fallout. Despite the extreme crypto-anxiety and price volatility of the last year, however, Bitcoin has managed an impressive rebound, recently staying steady at about $26,000 \u2013 for now. But just when things have been looking up, crypto markets took an unexpected dive this week, and experts suggest that there may be another crash coming in September.\n\nDespite the volatility, Bitcoin\u2019s energy use is at an all time high \u2013 and so are its carbon emissions. According to the Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, created and maintained by the University of Cambridge, Bitcoin\u2019s estimated network power demand is currently clocking in at around 16 gigawatts, or about 138 TWh per year \u2013 approximately the equivalent of the entire country of Pakistan, home to 231.4 million people.\n\nThe issue is the way that Bitcoins are mined. As more and more miners try to produce Bitcoins through solving complex proof-of-work problems, the problems get increasingly difficult to solve, thereby requiring more and more computing power to produce the same amount of Bitcoin. This is done to prevent the depression of the currency's value \u2013 in order to maintain a steady currency, each Bitcoin is designed to take about ten minutes to mine, no matter how much computing power is thrown at it. For this reason, it now takes about 9 years\u2019 worth of household electricity to mine a single Bitcoin, whereas in 2009, it required just a few seconds\u2019 worth.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just an issue for the environment, it's also an issue for Bitcoin miners, who have to secure more and more energy to keep their Bitcoin mining operations afloat. For this reason, lots of Bitcoin miners are trying to get more creative with sourcing cheap energy or energy industry byproducts, employing innovative approaches such as setting up in poor countries with heavily subsidized energy prices or using energy that would otherwise be wasted, such as coal ash \u2013 and natural gas vented during drilling on oilfields.\n\nCoal ash, in particular, has been touted by some as a potentially elegant solution to some of Bitcoin\u2019s problems. It makes use of a byproduct that poses an environmental and health problem to the communities where it has been dumped and stored, and in doing so, recovers that land for other more productive uses. One of the biggest proponents of this approach is Stronghold, a publicly traded bitcoin mining firm operating in Pennsylvania, where coal ash is a readily available commodity thanks to widespread coal usage for steel production, among other uses, not to mention an ongoing environmental woe. Stronghold is \u201cvertically integrated\u201d as a Bitcoin company, with ownership of its own energy sources as well as its mining rigs. Those energy sources are two coal ash sites with a combined capacity of 165 MW.\n\nWhile Stronghold presents the plan as a win-win for bitcoin and for the environment, however, critics argue that it\u2019s not actually such a clean solution. While coal ash does need to be cleaned up and processed, environmentalists argue that burning coal ash is not a good option, as it creates considerable greenhouse gas emissions. Put simply, it just moves the coal ash pollution from the ground to the air.\n\nAnd the issue is not just the irresponsible use of waste coal, it's the increasing demand for energy generated from fossil fuels in general. In a number of locations, we\u2019ve already seen Bitcoin operations extending the life and spiking the emissions of coal and gas plants that were already on track to be shut down. A recent report from US NGO Global Energy Monitor found that all coal plants worldwide need to be shuttered by 2040 or face \u2018climate chaos\u2019. The threat that the coal-powered Bitcoin trend poses to decarbonization pathways is considerable and is increasingly garnering attention. New York recently imposed a 2-year moratorium on new permits for fossil fuel plants seeking to mine cryptocurrencies. While New York has acted swiftly to protect its climate goals, it is an outlier.\n\nBy Haley Zaremba for Oilprice.com\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Bitcoin's most faithful are staying put despite the crypto market's recent weakness - CNBC",
        "content": "Even after a big correction, which followed weeks of almost complete inactivity, and a new focus on real rates, bitcoin's most patient investors are still holding onto their coins. The cryptocurrency closed at $25,972.52 on Friday and lost 0.25% for the week \u2013 its eight negative week in the past nine, according to Coin Metrics. It had posted an 11% decline for the previous week. Coin Metrics measures a week in crypto, which trades 24 hours a day, from the 4:00 p.m. ET stock market close one Friday to the next. Bitcoin had been almost completely inactive for several weeks leading up to its violent sell-off on Aug. 17 and many investors expected any of several tailwinds the market has been monitoring to eventually push its price higher. Instead, inflation updates and the possibility of more rate hikes have brought more uncertainty into crypto. \"There is uncertainty ahead, and the Fed will act if inflation data warrants it,\" Oppenheimer's Owen Lau said following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming , Friday. \"The part that could upset the crypto market is if interest rates stay higher for longer, which disappoints the expectation that the rate could be lowered in the first half of 2024. Until the Fed sees a sustained progress, not just the inflation reaches 2%, it appears that the Fed will continue to be restrictive.\" Nevertheless, the market has appeared relatively calm. The August dive was the biggest one-day sell-off since the height of the FTX fallout in November. However, an Indicia Labs analysis of social media chatter about crypto shows sentiment only dipped into neutral territory from positive seven full days after the price drop. That decline pales in comparison to the drop that took place in November, when sentiment dropped from positive to neutral in the days leading up to the crash, and slid into \"very negative\" territory four days later. \"There hasn't really been a big change in fundamentals,\" said Gustavo Schwenkler, associate professor at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University and cofounder of Indicia Labs. \"Right now what's really happening is people are just waiting it out. We don't know what's going to happen with the SEC or if there will be new policies potentially. It's been unclear where crypto is going to go in the U.S.\" from a regulatory perspective. On top of the regulatory overhang, JPMorgan said Thursday the bitcoin correction could be \"partly attributed to the broader correction in risk assets such as equities and in particular tech, which in turn appear to have been induced by frothy positioning in tech, higher U.S. real yields and growth concerns about China ,\" but that it \" sees limited downside for crypto markets over the near term.\" Trading data also shows long-term investors haven't been easily shaken by the recent weakness. Investors that have held on to their bitcoin for a year or longer, now make up nearly 70% of bitcoin holders, according to Glassnode. The newest group of long-term holders \u2014 specifically, those who have held their bitcoin for one to two years \u2014 have fallen (36%) since the beginning of the year, but the number of people who bought between two and three years ago has grown (85.8%). \"The number and percentage of bitcoins that have been held for greater than a year is hovering near all-time highs. This tells us that despite the price volatility and recent downdraft in prices, long-term holders are unwavering. This fact, combined with next April's reward halving, may be the springboard for higher prices in the future,\" Greg Cipolaro, global head of research at NYDIG, the crypto subsidiary of Stone Ridge Asset Management, told CNBC. He added that while it's unclear what exactly accounts for traders' resilience, maturing crypto investors are becoming more \"aware of the cycles associated with bitcoin's halving and are expecting it to repeat, leading to price appreciation.\" \u2014CNBC's Michael Bloom and Nick Wells contributed reporting."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), a term that has become synonymous with the buzzword \u201ccryptocurrency,\u201d has garnered significant attention since its inception in 2008.\n\nIts popularity has prompted many to question: What does a Bitcoin look like Does it have a physical form? How can you conduct transactions?\n\nThis article delves into the digital world of Bitcoin and provides comprehensive insights into its workings.\n\nWhat does Bitcoin look like?\n\nBitcoin, a digital currency, doesn\u2019t have a physical form like traditional coins or notes. Instead, it exists solely in a digital format. It is represented by a string of alphanumeric characters, typically starting with the number \u201c1\u201d or \u201c0\u201d.\n\nThese characters serve as a unique identifier for each Bitcoin wallet. Bitcoin transactions involve transferring ownership of these digital tokens from one wallet to another, recorded on the blockchain.\n\nWhile Bitcoin itself doesn\u2019t have a physical appearance, its symbol \u2013 \u20bf \u2013 is commonly used to represent it. The symbol is similar to the letter \u201cB\u201d with two vertical lines through it.\n\nBitcoin uses this symbol in graphics, logos, and designs associated with Bitcoin.\n\nIn essence, Bitcoin\u2019s \u201clook\u201d is the arrangement of characters and numbers in its wallet addresses and its symbolic representation, which have become recognizable in the digital financial world.\n\nThe absence of a physical presence is a defining characteristic of cryptocurrencies, highlighting their digital nature and decentralized functionality.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin: A virtual asset\n\nThe first thing to comprehend about Bitcoin is that it is not a physical entity but a completely digital asset. It functions as an electronic cash system developed by an anonymous individual or group of people known as Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThe primary intention behind Bitcoin\u2019s creation was to establish a monetary system that operated independently of any government, authority, or middleman, such as banks.\n\nBitcoin is essentially an open-source software that allows users to perform transactions using digitally signed codes.\n\nThese codes represent the conditional statements of Bitcoin. Therefore, the first and foremost answer to the question, \u201cWhat does Bitcoin look like?\u201d is that it appears as numerous lines of code.\n\nBlockchain: The Visual Ledger of Transactions\n\nAt the heart of Bitcoin lies the blockchain, a decentralized and distributed ledger that logs all transactions across a network of computers.\n\nEvery block within the blockchain comprises a roster of transactions, and when connected, they create a visible chain.\n\nExamining the blockchain visually unveils the transparency and immutability that define Bitcoin transactions.\n\nThe Mysterious Origins of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin was launched in 2009 by an individual or group operating under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The true identity of Nakamoto remains a mystery, adding to the enigma surrounding Bitcoin.\n\nDespite this mystery, the open-source nature of Bitcoin\u2019s software means that anyone can view, use, or contribute to the code.\n\nBitcoin transactions: The underlying mechanism\n\nWhile Bitcoin transactions may seem straightforward at first glance, they involve a complex process. When a user initiates a payment, the network and the Bitcoin wallet undergo a series of steps to ensure the accurate amount reaches the recipient\u2019s wallet.\n\nA typical Bitcoin transaction comprises three main elements:\n\nA transaction input: The Bitcoin address from which helps to send the BTC.\n\nA transaction output: The Bitcoin address to which helps to send the BTC.\n\nThe amount: The quantity of Bitcoins involved in the transaction.\n\nThe transaction input and output are essentially Bitcoin addresses, and these addresses are lines of alphanumeric codes. Each address is unique and tied to a specific Bitcoin wallet.\n\nThe genesis of Bitcoin mining: The first block\n\nBlockchain technology is the foundation of Bitcoin. Using this technology, a decentralized, open ledger can create Bitcoin transactions. A network of nodes computers running the Bitcoin software\u2014maintains this ledger.\n\nThe Genesis Block also referred to as Block 0, is the first Bitcoin block ever mined and is the base of the Bitcoin trading system.\n\nIt was developed in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto and established the standard for trading Bitcoin. Models of subsequent blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain after the Genesis Block.\n\nBitcoin wallet: Your digital vault\n\nIn the Bitcoin universe, a digital wallet plays a crucial role. It is essentially a software where you store Bitcoins. The wallet facilitates the sending and receiving of Bitcoins and grants the user ownership of the Bitcoin balance.\n\nA Bitcoin wallet can exist in various forms \u2013 desktop wallets installed on a computer, mobile wallets on smartphones, web wallets accessible via a browser, and hardware wallets that store Bitcoins on a physical device.\n\nEvery Bitcoin wallet has a unique string of 26-35 alphanumeric characters known as the wallet address. This address can transfer Bitcoins to another address on the network.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s environmental impact: A growing concern\n\nOne of the criticisms that Bitcoin often faces pertains to its environmental impact. The Bitcoin mining process can consume a significant amount of energy.\n\nSome estimates equate the amount of CO2 generated by the Bitcoin network to that of a large Western city or an entire developing country.\n\nSafety and security of Bitcoins\n\nBitcoin transactions rely on the SHA-256 algorithm, designed by the US National Security Agency. The cryptographic nature of Bitcoin makes it virtually impossible to crack.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin operates without any central authority, which means there is no recourse in case of an error with a transaction or loss of password.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nQ: Is Bitcoin real money?\n\nA: Even though Bitcoin doesn\u2019t exist in physical form, it can effectively operate as real money and is recognized as legal tender in certain countries, like El Salvador.\n\nHowever, in many parts of the world, you can\u2019t simply stroll into any store or caf\u00e9 and use your Bitcoin wallet for transactions.\n\nNevertheless, the acceptance of Bitcoin is expanding, and it\u2019s increasingly common to find merchants and service providers embracing Bitcoin payments.\n\nQ: How can you tell a fake Bitcoin?\n\nA: The possibility exists that someone might create a malicious fork of the Bitcoin blockchain, attempting to present it as a genuine article to unsuspecting users.\n\nIf you harbor suspicions about the authenticity of your Bitcoin wallet, consider creating a new one and conducting a test transaction. If the transaction goes through and is visible on a Bitcoin block explorer, you\u2019re dealing with authentic Bitcoin.\n\nEncountering fake Bitcoin is highly improbable. In reality, most cryptocurrency scams employ different tactics to pilfer funds from unsuspecting users.\n\nCommonly, scammers persuade users to deposit their Bitcoin into an \u201cinvestment platform,\u201d promising significant returns. Once the Bitcoin is deposited, the scammers vanish, leaving the victim with stolen funds.\n\nBe wary of promises of guaranteed returns in exchange for sending Bitcoin \u2013 such propositions are almost certainly scams.\n\nQ: What does the code for Bitcoin look like?\n\nA: Bitcoin implementations can be coded in various programming languages. Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s initial Bitcoin implementation was crafted in C++, and this programming language is also employed by Bitcoin Core, recognized as the primary implementation of Bitcoin.\n\nSumming up\n\nDespite its complexities and criticisms, Bitcoin continues to thrive and revolutionize the financial landscape. It has paved the way for other cryptocurrencies and has even garnered the attention of prominent businesses and financial institutions. With its growing acceptance, Bitcoin can redefine the concept of currency in the digital age.\n\nIn conclusion, BTC is a revolutionary digital currency that challenges traditional notions of transactions and economies.\n\nHowever, it doesn\u2019t have a physical form but exists as lines of code in a decentralized network. Furthermore, while it can be complex to understand, it represents a gigantic step towards a future where financial systems are more transparent, efficient, and inclusive."

Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nThis week markets appeared grateful for the dearth of news\u2014\"no news is good news,\" as the saying goes. Most leading cryptocurrencies recovered their losses over the week after last Thursday's flash crash sank virtually all leading cryptocurrencies by double-digit percentages.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) currently holds the fort at $26,015, about 0.4% cheaper than it was this time last week. A lot of Bitcoin mining machinery came online this week, as evinced by the fact that the network on Wednesday hit a new all-time high for mining difficulty alongside a corresponding spike in hash rate, or computational power.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, matched Bitcoin\u2019s pace. At its current price of $1,647, it is down 1.6% from last week.\n\nBroadly speaking, most top thirty cryptocurrencies retained their value. The only notable depreciation over the last seven days fell upon holders of Uniswap (UNI) and Avalanche (AVAX). AVAX fell 7.2% to $10.02, while UNI crashed 7.9% to $4.58.\n\nMeme coin PEPE is still in freefall. On Monday it posted intraweek losses of over 20% as it slid from 71st to 84th place. It now enters the weekend at $0.000000865154\u2014the 98th biggest cryptocurrency by market cap\u2014or about 23.3% lower than it was a week ago.\n\nAdding to its generally poor performance, the PepeCoin team\u2019s multi-sig Ethereum address transferred 16.045 trillion PEPE\u2014worth $16.85 million at the time\u2014to four exchanges: Binance, OKX, KuCoin, and Bybit, on Thursday.\n\nThe lack of communication from the team about these transfers contributed to some heated panic selling.\n\nCapital cities were silent about crypto this week. There were only a few stories of any note.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the news...\n\nThe Kenyan government on Monday established a committee to inquire into OpenAI CEO Sam Altman\u2019s crypto project Worldcoin\u2014a controversial project which offers people around the world free crypto if they visit their nearest \u201cOrb\u201d and supply it with biometric data (a snapshot of their eyeballs). Kenya\u2019s move came three weeks after the country suspended Worldcoin\u2019s activities within its borders.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Justice arrested Tornado Cash founder Roman Storm and charged him with crimes related to money laundering. Co-founder Roman Semenov, who was also named in the indictment, remains at large in Dubai.\n\nLast year, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) banned Americans from using privacy mixer Tornado Cash, claiming that criminals had used it to launder money\u2014specifically naming the North Korean state-sponsored hacker organization Lazarus Group.\n\nEarlier this week, the legislative body of the Central African Republic (CAR) granted approval for the tokenization of land and natural resources to help the government position the country as an up-and-coming business destination in Africa.\n\nThe project launched last year with resource tokenization in mind; it is meant to facilitate investment in CAR through Sango Coin, a state-issued token\u2014though not a Central Bank Digital Currency\u2014backed by Bitcoin on a sidechain network.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has gone silent over the weekend. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said, in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), that Bitcoin\u2019s velocity has declined to a three-year low. He said this could either be considered positive, as whales were holding on to their positions, or negative because the transfer to new investors was not happening.\n\nThe range-bound action continues to perplex investors with regard to the next possible trending move. In that respect, there was positive commentary from JPMorgan analysts who said that Bitcoin\u2019s downtrend could be ending. They believe that the declining open interest in Bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange suggests that the long liquidation is over.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nAs Bitcoin decides its next move, select altcoins are showing signs of strength. These altcoins could turn negative if Bitcoin\u2019s range resolves to the downside, but if Bitcoin turns up or stays in a range, then they may offer a short-term trading opportunity.\n\nLet\u2019s study the charts of the top-five cryptocurrencies that may move up in the near term and identify the levels that need to be crossed for the bulls to take charge.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin formed an inside-day candlestick pattern on Aug. 26, indicating indecision between the bulls and the bears about the next directional move.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe downsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($27,222) and the relative strength index (RSI) in the oversold zone indicate that bears are in command. However, the bulls are unlikely to give up without a fight. They will try to defend the $24,800 level with all their might.\n\nThe BTC/USDT pair may start a stronger recovery if buyers thrust the price above the 20-day EMA. That could open the doors for a possible rally to the 50-day simple moving average ($28,888).\n\nIf bears want to strengthen their position, they will have to pull the price below $24,800. If they do that, the pair could start a downtrend to $20,000.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA is flattening out, and the RSI is near the midpoint on the four-hour chart. This suggests a balance between supply and demand. If the price crumbles below $25,700, the pair could fall to $25,166 and then to $24,800.\n\nOn the contrary, if the pair sustains above the moving averages, it will signal that the bulls have absorbed the selling. There is a minor resistance at $26,314, but if this crossed, the pair could climb to $26,610 and, later, to $26,833.\n\nToncoin price analysis\n\nToncoin (TON) is forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which will complete on a break and close above $1.53.\n\nTON/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe gradually upsloping 20-day EMA ($1.38) and the RSI in the positive zone indicate that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers drive the price above $1.53, the TON/USDT pair could start a new uptrend toward the pattern target of $1.91.\n\nThe bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to guard the $1.53 level and tug the price below the moving averages. If they manage to do that, the pair could decline to $1.25 and, eventually, to $1.15.\n\nTON/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the $1.53 level may prove to be a stiff barrier for the buyers to cross. If the price turns down from this level but rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls are buying on minor dips. That could improve the odds of a break above $1.53. The pair may then rally to $1.70.\n\nInstead, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will signal that traders are booking profits near $1.53. The pair may then drop to the 50-day SMA and, subsequently, to $1.33.\n\nMonero price analysis\n\nMonero\u2019s (XMR) sharp rebound off the uptrend line for the second time in the past few days shows that the bulls are fiercely defending the level.\n\nXMR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe XMR/USDT pair could reach the 20-day EMA ($148), which is likely to act as a formidable hurdle. If bulls do not give up much ground from this level, the prospects of a rally above the 20-day EMA increase. The pair may then climb to the 50-day SMA ($157), which could attract selling by the bears.\n\nIf the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that bears continue to sell on rallies. The pair could then retest the uptrend line. The repeated retest of a support level tends to weaken it. If this level gives in, the pair may collapse to $125 and then to $115.\n\nXMR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls pushed the price above the moving averages on the four-hour chart, indicating that the bears may be losing their grip. There is a strong resistance at $150, but if this level is scaled, the pair may reach $160. The rising 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate a minor advantage to buyers.\n\nThe first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the moving averages. That could pull the price to the uptrend line. A break below this support could send the pair tumbling to $125.\n\nRelated: FTX suspends user accounts amid Kroll cyber breach concerns\n\nMantle price analysis\n\nMantle (MNT) has been in a strong downtrend since topping out at $0.60 on July 20. The sharp downtrend sent the RSI into oversold territory, indicating that a relief rally was possible.\n\nMNT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe outside-day candlestick pattern on Aug. 25 suggests that the buyers are attempting to seize control. The MNT/USDT pair could first rise to the 20-day EMA ($0.45), which is an important level to watch out for. If buyers overcome this obstacle, the pair could rise to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.48.\n\nContrarily, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bears continue to sell on every minor rally. That could result in a retest of the support at $0.41. If this level cracks, the pair may slide to $0.35.\n\nMNT/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bulls have pushed the price above the moving averages but are struggling to start a runaway rally. This suggests that the bears have not given up, and they may pose a challenge at higher levels.\n\nIf the price breaks below the moving averages, it will signal advantage to bears. That will increase the possibility of a break below $0.41.\n\nAlternatively, if the price sustains above the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that the bulls are buying the minor dips. The pair may then attempt a rally to $0.47 and, subsequently, to $0.52.\n\nQuant price analysis\n\nQuant (QNT) rebounded off the strong support at $95 on Aug. 17 and rose above the moving averages on Aug. 26. This shows a strong demand at higher levels.\n\nQNT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls will try to sustain the momentum and push the price to the downtrend line. This level is likely to witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears. If the price turns down from this level but rebounds off the 20-day EMA ($101), it will signal a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips.\n\nThat could increase the likelihood of a rally above the downtrend line. If that happens, the QNT/USDT pair could start a rally to $120. This positive view could invalidate in the near term if the price turns down and plummets below the moving averages. The pair may then slide to the support at $95.\n\nQNT/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages on the four-hour chart have turned up and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that bulls are on a comeback. The pair could rally to the downtrend line, where the bears may again mount a stiff resistance.\n\nOn the downside, the moving averages are expected to act as strong supports. A break and close below the 50-day SMA will indicate that the recovery may be over. The pair may then slump to $98.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAmid a protracted bear market, a new conceptual framework for understanding the Bitcoin economy was launched Thursday.\n\nDavid Puell, research associate for ARK Invest, and James Check, lead analyst for Glassnode, co-authored a whitepaper dubbed \u201cCointime Economics: A New Framework For Bitcoin On-chain Analysis.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt provides a toolkit to properly understand the economic realities of Bitcoin,\u201d Check told Decrypt, detailing that it \u201cadds a new lens to assess the market.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe whitepaper provides insight into the differences between the current unspent transaction (UTXO) a new \"cointime \" model for understanding what the authors call the \u201creal economic weight of a Bitcoin.\"\n\n\n\nCointime economics approaches Bitcoin from a time-based perspective, proposing that the importance of Bitcoin is based on the last time a coin moved. The model introduces a new concept called a \"coinblock,\" which essentially multiplies the number of Bitcoin and the number of blocks produced while the Bitcoin remains unmoved.\n\nFor example, 10 coins held during the time necessary to produce 10 blocks represents 100 coinblocks.\n\n\u201cHeavy coinblock destruction suggests that long-term holders are selling,\" the report explains. Bitcoin\u2019s \u201csmart money,\u201d in other words, and they \u201ctypically hold larger bitcoin balances and trade from lower cost bases, generating higher profits.\"\n\nAccording to the document, two new metrics can also be used to analyze Bitcoin\u2019s economic state.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"Liveliness\" refers to how active or alive the network is, or how often coins have been \u201cdestroyed\u201d or moved. \"Vaultedness\" measures coins that are stored, alluding to how \u201cinactive\u201d the protocol is.\n\n\u201cWe believe the Cointime framework provides a highly consistent, mathematical framework measuring the economic importance of each bitcoin through time,\u201d the report read.\n\nFor Check, unlike the traditional UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) analysis\u2014which he says is \u201cvery granular and requires bespoke data engineering\u201d\u2014Cointime offers a \u201cmacro view.\u201d\n\nHe explained to Decrypt that \u201cit is simple to calculate and easy to replicate without proprietary data science.\u201d\n\nJames Check, co-author and Glassnode\u2019s lead analyst, told Decrypt that under this framing, \u201cthe bear market is much worse than expected.\u201d\n\nIn the Cointime\u2019s model, \u201csince lost coins were largely in the early years, they hold tremendous unrealized profits (over $35 billion),\u201d said Check. \u201cHowever, when we use 'cost basis' models like realized price, the losses held by active investors are masked by the profits held by lost coins.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder this framework, the true cost basis of the market is actually at around $32,000, which we are still underneath,\u201d Check added.\n\nPuell and Check highlight several value propositions of cointime economics, including reassessing Bitcoin\u2019s inflation rate and the network\u2019s valuation. Check suggested that cointime economics has two possible areas of use.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOn-chain analysts who are deep in the field and will use it to inspire new ideas,\u201d he said, and \u201cinstitutional investors looking for simpler models with higher signal.\u201d\n\nThe co-authors concluded that \u201cat the core, we have a simple mathematics toolkit to achieve vastly superior economic and valuation models which account for both the supply and demand side of the market.\u201d"

        "content": "Paolo Ardoino, the chief technology officer of stablecoin issuer Tether, recently found himself addressing rumors about images of large industrial containers online, leading him to reject questions about where Tether is mining Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIn an Aug. 26 X (formerly Twitter) post, Ardoino shed light on the curiosity sparked by the photo he shared on Aug. 24. The image displayed a container with a photoshopped Tether Energy logo, leaving many people pondering over what it\u2019s all about.\n\nOne of #Tether energy production and #Bitcoin mining sites coming along well. pic.twitter.com/6Z8o6A5OaE \u2014 Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) August 24, 2023\n\nHe clarified that the photo shows a control room at one of Tether\u2019s Bitcoin mining sites that it is currently completing and will soon begin operations at.\n\nHowever, Ardoino firmly stated he would not disclose the location, responding to numerous users who have inquired about it.\n\nWhile he did mention that the site is somewhere in the continent of South America, he added no further details due to security reasons.\n\n\u201cWhere? In LATAM. We tend to not share exact locations to avoid personnel harassment, a valid concern given the amount of detractors obsessed with Tether,\u201d he declared, admitting that it has led to many Tether skeptics questioning its legitimacy:\n\n\u201cYou can almost hear some of them screaming: \u2018NOOOOOOOO if you don\u2019t tell us the address, zip code, surname of the cow that is eating the grass nearby, then it\u2019s not real!!!!!\u2018\u201d\n\nHe addressed doubters who were curious about the photoshopped logo appearing on the containers, explaining that it was a deliberate media decision.\n\n\u201cWe thought that the photo would have been shared on newspapers so the team wanted to brand it,\u201d Ardoino noted. However, he believes having logos displayed at the mining sites would not be a wise approach from a security standpoint:\n\n\u201cMoreover, putting gigantic Tether logos would not be great from physical privacy of the site point of view.\u201d\n\nHe anticipates operations to commence sometime in September.\n\n\u201cThe site is progressing well, everyone in the team is super excited and working around the clock to start operations in the next few weeks,\u201d he declared.\n\nRelated: Mining 1 BTC in Lebanon is 783x cheaper than Italy: CoinGecko report\n\nThis comes after news that Tether is developing mining software aimed at providing more transparency within the Bitcoin mining industry.\n\nIn an interview with Cointelegraph on Aug. 17, Ardoino explained that Tether is working on a mining software called Moria that provides more comprehensive data analytics on energy production at Bitcoin mining sites.\n\nArdoino highlighted the need for better analytics and performance review in Bitcoin mining. He believes Moria will assist with evaluating the site\u2019s performance and surrounding environment:\n\n\u201cIf energy used by the mining site is wind or solar, there are optimization parameters, like predicted speed of wind for a specific day or a specific hour of the day, that could be used to overclock some of the miners and boost the production.\u201d\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin miner gets life in prison, China offers bounties for crypto firms: Asia Express"

        "title": "Bitcoin to hit $50,000 by the end of 2023 if this pattern is repeated - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "As Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price continues to grapple with uncertainty regarding its next movement, the market remains uncertain whether the asset will experience an upward or downward momentum. Amidst this uncertainty, historical price patterns suggest the potential for the asset to rally by over 90% from its current value by the end of the year.\n\nIn this line, an analysis posted on TradingView by TradingShot on August 25 suggested that Bitcoin could reach a value of $50,000 by the conclusion of 2023. The analysis centers around the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) bullish cross that took place in the one-month timeframe around two months ago. This cross sheds light on historical parallels that might indicate a significant rally in the future.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView\n\nAccording to the analyst, the pattern mirrors a historical context dating back to 2014, identifying three prior instances when the one-month MACD formed a bullish cross. On these occasions, the price action was notable for hitting the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level shortly before or after the Bullish Cross, except for the strange June 2019 period during the Libra hype.\n\nFurthermore, the analyst highlighted the symmetrical support level derived from the last lower high of the bear cycle. This support level has demonstrated resilience by consistently closing all 1-month candles above it, barring the irregular disruption due to the pandemic-inspired flash crash in March 2020.\n\n\u201cThis is the position that the recent price decline has brought us to, testing that Symmetrical Support, which has held twice already in June and May 2023. The situation is more like the December 2015 1M MACD Bullish Cross, which took 6 months until it reached the 0.786 Fibonacci level. This time range is completed in 4 months, which means that by December 2023, BTC can reach the 0.786 Fib, which is at $50000,\u201d he said.\n\nBitcoin price remains in consolidation\n\nHowever, in the present instance, this time frame appears to be condensed, potentially culminating in four months. This suggests that Bitcoin could possibly reach the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level at $50,000 by December 2023.\n\nIndeed, if this pattern repeats, it will relieve the crypto community, especially considering that Bitcoin has predominantly traded below the $30,000 mark in recent times. It\u2019s worth noting that market observers believe Bitcoin is poised to reach another high, with catalysts such as the upcoming halving event and the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).\n\nAt the same time, as Bitcoin trades in a consolidated phase, there seems to be increasing demand for the maiden cryptocurrency. As reported by Finbold, over the past 12 months, there has been an uptick in demand for the keyword \u2018buy Bitcoin\u2019 on Google Trends.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBy press time, Bitcoin was trading at $26,067, having undergone a 0.21% rise in the last 24 hours. Over the past week, Bitcoin\u2019s performance has been characterized by consolidation, with a minor decrease of nearly 0.3%.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nFrom a technical analysis standpoint, the primary sentiment surrounding Bitcoin remains bearish. An overview of the one-day indicators suggests a \u2018sell\u2019 stance at 14, while the moving averages advocate a \u2018strong sell\u2019 position at 13. Meanwhile, the oscillators stand neutral at 7.\n\nBitcoin technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nOverall, the ability of Bitcoin to regain the $50,000 mark will depend on other elements, such as macroeconomic factors, including inflation and interest rates.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
