        "content": "Bitcoin's value could jump to as much as $100,000 by the end of 2024, Standard Chartered said in a note published Monday.\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and other mid-tier U.S. lenders has solidified the case for bitcoin as a \"decentralised, trustless and scarce digital asset,\" Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick said in the note.\n\n\"We see potential for Bitcoin (BTC) to reach the USD 100,000 level by end-2024, as we believe the much-touted 'crypto winter' is finally over,\" Kendrick said in the report, titled \"Bitcoin \u2014 Pathway to the USD 100,000 level.\"\n\n\"The current stress in the traditional banking sector is highly conducive to BTC outperformance \u2013 and validates the original premise for Bitcoin as a decentralised, trustless and scarce digital asset,\" Kendrick added.\n\n\"Given these advantages, we think BTC's share of total digital assets market cap could move into the 50-60% range in the next few months (from around 45% currently).\"\n\nBitcoin was trading at $27,601.55 as of 9:40 a.m. ET, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nThe woes of Circle's USD Coin and other so-called stablecoins, which aim to achieve a 1-to-1 peg to the U.S. dollar, has also benefited bitcoin, Kendrick said.\n\nUSDC lost its peg to the dollar after its issuer Circle revealed exposure to SVB. The coin has since regained its $1 value, however its total market value has fallen to $30.7 billion from more than $43 billion since Mar. 10 when the bank was placed into receivership by the U.S. government, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nThis, coupled with a stabilization of risk assets and speculation that the Federal Reserve will ease monetary tightening further, means the \"pathway to the USD 100,000 level is becoming clearer,\" Kendrick said.\n\nProponents of bitcoin maintain the digital currency is an asset worth diversifying into in times of economic distress. As the theory goes, bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million bitcoins, meaning it should appreciate as demand for alternative assets grows to avoid the effects of high inflation."

        "title": "Analysis | What Is Bitcoin 'Halving' and Will It Push Up the Cryptocurrency's Price? - The Washington Post",
        "content": "Bitcoin is notoriously volatile, prone to sudden price surges and swift reversals that can wipe out millions of dollars of value in a matter of minutes. Those changes are often mysterious to market observers, given the digital currency\u2019s lack of fundamentals, or ties to the real economy. Bitcoin has another quirk, one that was built into the code that gave it birth: every so often, the formula that governs the rate at which new tokens are created changes. As another such event \u2014 called a halving \u2014 approaches, Bitcoin supporters and skeptics are debating what kind of impact it may have on the coin\u2019s value.\n\n1. Where do baby Bitcoin come from, anyway?\n\nOne of the characteristics that gave rise to a fascination with Bitcoin is the way its pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, tied the creation of coins to the work needed to prevent counterfeiting. Bitcoin is generated by so-called miners whose computers perform complex calculations that validate the transactions on what\u2019s known as the blockchain, a public digital ledger. The miners compete with each other to earn newly issued tokens known as a block reward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. What is a Bitcoin halving?\n\nA halving \u2013 sometimes referred to as halvening \u2013 is a planned reduction in rewards miners receive (the term is mentioned in Bitcoin\u2019s code). Halvings happen once every four years or so \u2013 more precisely, every 210,000 blocks of transactions. As the name suggests, each one cuts the amount of Bitcoin miners receive per block reward in half. At Bitcoin\u2019s launch in 2009, miners received 50 Bitcoin per block, but that reward was reduced to 25 in the first halving, in 2012, to 12.5 in 2016, 6.25 tokens in 2020 and is scheduled to drop to 3.125 coins in 2024.\n\n3. What\u2019s the point?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s issuance is limited in several ways. For one thing, according to its founding protocol, just 21 million will ever be in circulation. That\u2019s appealing to many who fear that fiat money \u2014 the kind issued by governments \u2014 can lose its value to inflation if too much is printed. Supporters argue that Bitcoin, by contrast, will be guaranteed to increase. Halving also prevents inflation by acting to periodically slow the pace at which Bitcoin are created, so as to not outstrip demand. To other observers, halvings can serve as a hurry-up-and-buy signal by suggesting that slower growth could be accompanied by a bump in price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. When is Bitcoin\u2019s halving happening?\n\nShare this article Share\n\nThe quadrennial event is due next around April 2024. In general, predicting the exact date is hard because the time it takes to generate new blocks can slow down or speed up depending on a number of factors. Going by most estimates, there will be 64 Bitcoin halvings before that 21 million maximum is reached sometime around 2140, at which point halvings will stop. Once that happens, miners will no longer collect rewards and are expected to rely on charging fees for handling transactions, similar to what credit card companies do.\n\n5. Do halvings boost Bitcoin\u2019s price?\n\nThat\u2019s a matter of heated debate. In 2012, for instance, Bitcoin gained about 8,000% in the 12 months following the cut in rewards, and again rose almost 1,000% in the wake of the 2016 cut. The last halving, in May of 2020, was followed by a bull run that ended in a record Bitcoin price of almost $69,000 in November 2021. As of mid-April this year, Bitcoin has revived about 67% from an epic rout in 2022, to around $30,000. The next halving holds the potential to trigger an advance of at least 81%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence and Matrixport. Skeptics, on the other hand, argue that attributing price hikes to halving is specious, at best. The second halving, for example, came at a time when Bitcoin was already gaining greater mainstream recognition, and coincided with the boom in initial coin offerings, many of which had to be bought with Bitcoin. But the bounce has sputtered of late, restrained by cooling expectations of US Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts. A regulatory crackdown on crypto in the wake of the FTX exchange\u2019s collapse in November 2022 also threatens the market outlook.\n\n6. If I own Bitcoin, will anything change for me after the halving?\n\nNo, except inasmuch as any subsequent price change would leave you richer or poorer. But it will be impossible to know how much of the change is due directly to the halving.\n\n--With assistance from Sidhartha Shukla and Brandon Kochkodin.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com"

        "content": "Prices of bitcoin and ether\u2014the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization\u2014are usually closely correlated, but that's changing after Ethereum's Shanghai Upgrade, and it could affect investments and risk management for cryptocurrency investors.\n\nKey Takeaways Ether and Bitcoin have moved together in the past, with the exception of the time period around The Merge.\n\nThe lack of correlation increased after Ethereum's Shanghai (Shapella) hard fork.\n\nAt the same time, bitcoin has continued its correlation with the Nasdaq.\n\nEther and Bitcoin's Correlation\n\nAccording to a recent report by Coinbase, the correlation between bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) has been declining since the beginning of 2023 and the rift widened after Ethereum's Shanghai (Shapella) hard fork. The upgrade, completed on April 12, allowed users to withdraw staked ether for the first time.\n\nThe BTC-ETH correlation based on a 40-day rolling window has fallen from 0.95 to 0.82 during that time. In the past, these two crypto assets have mostly moved lockstep.\n\n\n\nThe report attributes this trend to several factors, such as the increasing adoption of Ethereum-based decentralized applications (DApps), the growing popularity of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and the transition of the network from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\nHow Declining Correlation Impacts Investments\n\nLower BTC-ETH correlation could have implications for portfolio diversification and risk management. For institutional investors, it could mean a change in their hedging strategies.\n\n\"The relevance of this falling correlation for institutional investors is that it can affect quantitative strategies that rely on cross hedging one asset for the other (or using ETH as a hedge for less liquid altcoins),\" said Coinbase analysts.\n\nFor investors who want to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market, holding both BTC and ETH could provide more benefits than holding either one alone, as they could reduce the overall volatility and increase the potential returns of their portfolio.\n\nHowever, the report cautions that correlation is not a static measure and could change over time depending on market conditions and developments in both networks.\n\nBitcoin Still Correlated with Nasdaq\n\nBitcoin is often touted as a hedge against inflation and a safe haven asset in times of economic turmoil. However, a recent analysis by CoinDesk shows that the cryptocurrency's correlation with the ratio of Nasdaq 100 to S&P 500 index has increased significantly since late 2020, suggesting that bitcoin may be more sensitive to shifts in market sentiment and risk appetite than previously thought.\n\n\n\nThe ratio of Nasdaq 100 to S&P 500 reflects the relative performance of growth stocks versus value stocks. Growth stocks are typically associated with higher earnings growth potential and higher valuations, while value stocks are seen as undervalued and often pay dividends.\n\n\n\nAccording to CoinDesk, bitcoin's 90-day correlation coefficient with the Nasdaq-to-S&P 500 ratio rose to a record high of 0.79 in March 2021, up from -0.06 in September 2020.\n\n"

        "content": "When Sarah Meiklejohn first discovered cryptocurrency, she was a grad student in computer science at University of California, San Diego.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning we all were just like \u2018whoa, Bitcoin what\u2019s anyone doing with it,\u201d she said.\n\nThis was back in 2013, four years after Bitcoin was dreamed up in a white paper by someone named Satoshi Nakamoto, and back then it was generally accepted that Bitcoin was untraceable, which was odd because Bitcoin transactions are public.\n\nThey are all represented by a meaningless string of characters \u2014 or hashes \u2014 on a digital ledger called the blockchain.\n\nMeiklejohn believed once a cryptocurrency transaction touched the real world, the supposed meaninglessness of those hashes would fall away, and the transactions would reveal a lot about the people who made them.\n\n\u201cI kind of knew beyond any shadow of a doubt that Bitcoin was not anonymous,\u201d she said.\n\nIt turns out you could figure out a lot by seeing how Bitcoin transactions are related to each other. At the simplest level, if a string of Bitcoin characters is initiating lots of crypto transactions and another string, or wallet, is receiving them, that gives you a relationship to work with. So Meiklejohn decided to prove that in an unusual way: by shopping.\n\nStefan Savage was her thesis advisor at UCSD. He still has a lot of the stuff she bought, and he went through it. \u201cSo we have a Guy Fawkes mask \u2014 very on brand for the time \u2014 some earrings, organic Colombian coffee beans, I\u2019m sure those are still good after fifteen years,\u201d he said.\n\nThis was part of the collection of things he and Meiklejohn bought with crypto to watch the transactions go from buyer to seller.\n\n\u201cIt was, I need to get a purchase from some wallet in this cluster that my algorithm has identified,\u201d Savage said, explaining how they came to choose their purchases. \u201cLet me go and see things that are likely to get me there.\u201d\n\nWhat Meiklejohn didn\u2019t know at the time was that a man named Michael Gronager was following her project and had read her research paper. He was writing an algorithm that would allow him to trace transactions at scale.\n\nIn fact, he used that algorithm to figure out where a bunch of stolen Bitcoin had gone when a crypto exchange called Mt. Gox went bankrupt in 2014. He eventually turned all this into the company Chainalysis.\n\nHe said his algorithm essentially automated and sweetened Meiklejohn\u2019s tracing process. \u201cI can see an automated pattern that is running all the time,\u201d he said. Now he\u2019s using it to help financial institutions and governments track stolen money and identify bad players in the crypto world.\n\nAn earlier version of this story appeared on the Click Here podcast from Recorded Future News.

        "title": "A Seized Bitcoin Stack Could Be Bulgaria's Golden Ticket - Nasdaq",
        "content": "This is an opinion editorial by Ahmed Botan, a marketing professional with a focus on Bitcoin-based projects.\n\nBulgaria, a small country located in Southeast Europe, nestled between Romania and Greece, is set to become one of the wealthiest countries in the world.\n\nThe reason for this is its possession of 213,000 bitcoin, which its authorities seized from a group they labeled as criminals in 2017. According to the South East European Law Enforcement Center (SELC), the group hacked the Bulgarian customs agency\u2019s computers and made changes to the system so that their partner companies could import goods while avoiding paying taxes on them.\n\nImmediately following the crackdown, the bitcoin seized was worth about $500,000, however, it would now be worth closer to $6 billion dollars, as of April 2023. While the details around the BTC seizure are unclear, and it is not totally clear whether the country still holds that bitcoin or what it plans to do with the stack if it does, the potential of a nation like Bulgaria holding this much BTC is worth exploring.\n\nAs the value of bitcoin is, in the view of many, set to go up a lot higher still in the coming years, Bulgaria could stand to become very wealthy.\n\nThe Rising Price Of Bulgaria\u2019s Bitcoin\n\nWhile the future price of bitcoin is impossible to predict, there are some prominent examples of experts explaining why they are confident Bulgaria\u2019s bitcoin holdings will grow exponentially in value.\n\nJesse Meyers, the COO of Onramp Bitcoin who holds an MBA from Stanford University, has predicted that the bitcoin price will hit $10 million in the coming decades. Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood has predicted bitcoin will reach $1 million by 2030 in a bullish scenario. Similarly, Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMex believes that bitcoin could hit $1 million by 2026.\n\nMost recently, the former CTO of Coinbase, Balji Srinivasan, has predicted that bitcoin would hit $1 million by June 15, 2023, wagering $2 million to that effect.\n\nWhile most people don't believe that thebitcoin pricecan reach $1 million by then, anything is possible. For example, if there was an extended banking crisis and hyperinflation of the U.S. dollar, as predicted by Srinivasan, who knows how valuable Bulgaria\u2019s bitcoin stack will become?\n\nFor instance, shortly after Srinivasan\u2019s bet (although this was certainly unrelated), several nations, including China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kenya and more began moving away from using the U.S. dollar in their trades, With the Kenyan president warning citizens to get rid of their dollar holdings.\n\nThe United States government has measures in place to prevent further bank runs, like the Federal Reserve's $25 billion bank-term funding program (BTFP) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\u2019s (FDIC\u2019s) openness to cover all deposits.\n\nI think, if the FDIC decides to insure all deposits, that will be enough to deter true bank runs, but it\u2019s clear that the U.S. dollar is not as strong as it used to be. And that opens the door for a decentralized, global monetary unit like bitcoin to rise.\n\nAs a result, if Bulgaria holds onto its BTC stash, it could amass more value relative to the holdings of other countries around the world and become one of the world\u2019s richest.\n\nSo, What Will Bulgaria Do With Its Bitcoin?\n\nBulgaria could use future bitcoin gains to invest in its economy, but it will have to pay off national debts first. As of 2022, Bulgaria\u2019s national government debt reached $20 billion in 2022.\n\nBy 2030, if thebitcoin pricehits $1 million and it still holds its seized, 213,000 BTC stash, its holdings could be worth $213 billion.\n\nAfter paying off its debt, Bulgaria could use the funds generated from selling the 231,000 BTC to invest in various industries, such as technology or real estate. Moreover, the Bulgarian government could use the funds generated from the sale of its bitcoin to improve the country's infrastructure, education and healthcare. By investing in these essential sectors, Bulgaria could attract foreign investment, and this would further boost the country's economy.\n\nBulgaria has a significant opportunity to become one of the wealthiest countries in the world if it HODLs its bitcoin and sells some at the right time. But it seems wise for the country to keep a significant portion of bitcoin in reserve in perpetuity, as fiat currencies like the dollar continue to deteriorate.\n\nThis is a guest post by Ahmed Botan.

In June, real estate in \"other select states\" will be listed by agents, brokers, and sellers. The company in its statement didn't specify which states will carry listings.\n\nTransactions can be closed within one business day, which is about 50 times faster than current averages, the company said. The marketplace is open to people worldwide and is integrated with Coinbase Commerce, a section of the crypto exchange that allows merchants to accept digital coin payments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe platform will push innovation in both the crypto and real estate industries, Caleb Richter, MyEListing.com's CEO, said in a statement.\n\n\"Real estate commerce needs to be changed. It's hard enough as it is to buy property in your local neighborhood, let alone in another state or country,\" he said.\n\nBitcoin Magazine noted that other real estate firms elsewhere in the world were accepting bitcoin as payment.\n\nThe launch arrives during a tumultuous period for the US housing and commercial property markets, with interest rates rapidly rising while a potential recession is brewing. Median home prices in March fell by the most since 2012, by 3.3% annually, according to Redfin. Meanwhile, lending standards for commercial real estate loans were expected to tighter further with a credit crunch forming, Bank of America said last month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin, pushing through a so-called crypto winter, has jumped by 65% this year. It traded down slightly on Friday to $27,511. Roughly 20% of Americans own cryptocurrencies, according to a Coinbase study carried out by Morning Consult published earlier this year."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC -0.21%) has long been criticized for its high volatility, which is often cited as a major barrier to adopting the cryptocurrency as a legitimate investment. However, in recent years, its volatility has been steadily decreasing, and this trend looks poised to continue in the future.\n\nHere's why this shift could be the under-the-radar catalyst that leads to Bitcoin's continued success in the coming years and decades.\n\nWhy Bitcoin is volatile\n\nTo start, let's look at why Bitcoin experiences such dramatic price fluctuations. First, it is traded internationally 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It isn't limited to set hours like the stock market. With people all over the world trading at all hours of the day, substantial swings can and do occur.\n\nSecond, Bitcoin is a relatively new asset. With limited historical data, the market struggles to assign an accurate price, which can also lead to sudden price swings. Unlike traditional assets, which have a history of finding fair value in particular economic conditions, Bitcoin is constantly under pressure to find a more accurate valuation depending on market sentiment, recent news events, and investor behavior.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin remains more volatile than traditional assets like stocks or bonds, there is a clear trend that its volatility has been tempering since the cryptocurrency was invented in 2009, with a considerable decline since 2022.\n\nBut why is this and how can it benefit investors?\n\nA substantial shift\n\nThere may be several reasons Bitcoin is becoming less volatile.\n\nOne of the primary draws of Bitcoin for investors is its use as a store of value. Many investors are now treating Bitcoin as a long-term investment option, rather than a short-term speculative asset. As more people start holding on to their Bitcoin for longer periods of time, the demand for Bitcoin will become more stable, resulting in less price volatility.\n\nIn addition, the Bitcoin market is maturing. The world's first cryptocurrency is no longer just a niche investment alternative for a few tech-savvy investors. It's now a mainstream investment option for millions of people and even some institutions.\n\nThe combination of these factors helped Bitcoin's total market cap rebound and stabilize after plunging last year. The market cap size alone -- now at almost $600 billion, bigger than all but a handful of companies -- makes it harder for large traders or institutional investors to swing the price of Bitcoin, which in turn has reduced its volatility. In other words, the larger Bitcoin's market cap becomes, the harder it is for large buy or sell orders to have an effect on the price.\n\nThe opportunity at hand\n\nSo why is the decreasing volatility of Bitcoin a good thing for investors? Well, quite simply, it turns the narrative of high volatility on its head. Rapidly fluctuating prices have been one of the primary reasons risk-averse investors shied away, but as Bitcoin's volatility decreases, its risk profile becomes more akin to that of other traditional assets that are found in most portfolios. In time, the cryptocurrency could become a more attractive option for portfolios of all risk levels.\n\nEven better, as more investors begin to see Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, the demand for the cryptocurrency should continue to grow, which will in turn not only help to stabilize its price but cause it to rise as the pressures of increased demand meets Bitcoin's finite supply of 21 million coins.\n\nThis won't happen overnight, but data show Bitcoin's volatility has been diminishing over the years. Ahead of the day when Bitcoin becomes a legitimate asset for investors of all risk levels, it makes investing today a promising opportunity with the cryptocurrency still almost 60% below its all-time high."

        "title": "Halvings Seem to Move Bitcoin and Litecoin in Very Different Ways - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ask superstitious Bitcoin fans about halvings and they\u2019ll say they\u2019re outrageously bullish, historically marking the onset of monumental price rallies.\n\nWhat about Litecoin halvings?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s fourth halving event \u2014 which will again slash BTC issuance by 50% \u2014 is expected to hit this time next year. But spinoff blockchain Litecoin (LTC) will see its own halving in 100 days.\n\nHalvings occur every four years (every 210,000 blocks for Bitcoin, 840,000 blocks for Litecoin). Bitcoin\u2019s issuance will drop from 6.25 BTC ($171,000) per block to 3.125 BTC ($85,400), while Litecoin\u2019s will go from 12.5 LTC ($1,100) to 6.25 ($550).\n\nAll Bitcoin and Litecoin halvings have coincided with epic bull markets. Blockworks analyzed price data starting six months before each halving and encompassing up to one year after. BTC exploded up to:\n\n20,000% around the 2012 event;\n\n560% across the 2016 halving and;\n\n780% over the 2020 episode.\n\nMost of BTC\u2019s gains were seen almost a full year after each halving took place. Litecoin halvings have also aligned with similar bullishness, but in a very different pattern.\n\nUnlike bitcoin\u2019s after-the-fact rallies, LTC has pumped the hardest in the six months before its halvings occurred.\n\nThere does not appear to be a distinct pattern in LTC\u2019s price performance in the year following each event. But the six months leading up to both halvings were eerily similar.\n\nLTC peaked at about 320% gains roughly 45 days out from each halving.\n\nIt gave up most of those returns in the month directly after.\n\nLTC rounded out the year after each event up between 80% and 110%.\n\nSelect the log view to better compare Bitcoin halvings\n\nBitcoin and Litecoin share source code (and halvings)\n\nRiyad Carey, research analyst at Kaiko, told Blockworks that halvings have been historically bullish catalysts for both BTC and LTC.\n\n\u201cThe timing of these halvings is quite interesting: ETH recently moved away from proof-of-work, which helped propel both Bitcoin and Litecoin\u2019s hash rates to all-time highs as miners looked for alternatives,\u201d Carey said.\n\nThere are other concerns: Bitcoin mining profitability tends to shrink after each block reward reduction, as miners are increasingly relying on transaction fees for revenue as they wait for speculative market prices to catch up to profitability.\n\nCarey continued: \u201cLitecoin was for many years a top-five token but has since lost that position to newer, primarily Layer-1, tokens. A pre-halving price rally could generate some excitement and potentially attract miners if they look for alternatives to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHalvings are indeed just one factor impacting price, alongside macroeconomic environment, correlation with tech stocks, trends in investor adoption and, increasingly, the business savvy of major crypto companies (or the lack thereof).\n\nIt is also worth stressing that the sample size of Bitcoin and Litecoin halvings are incredibly small, which renders realistic conclusions difficult to grasp.\n\nLitecoin launched in 2011, not by hard forking the Bitcoin blockchain (as is the case with Bitcoin Cash and the like), but by creating a direct fork of its source code.\n\nLitecoin developers, led by founder Charlie Lee, made small changes to Bitcoin\u2019s original codebase. Namely faster block times (every 2.5 minutes compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 10 minutes, on average) and a higher supply cap (84 million to Bitcoin\u2019s 21 million).\n\nLitecoin\u2019s value proposition was once that it could serve, in some sense, as a spiritual sister network, handling smaller transactions faster and cheaper than Bitcoin, while also acting as a store of value.\n\nThe advent of the Lightning Network shifted that narrative somewhat. Litecoin eventually grew to be a primary testing ground for potential Bitcoin upgrades \u2014 privacy focused technology MimbleWimble being one example.\n\nLitecoin\u2019s price is so far tracking its 2015 halving\n\nThere are differences, but the general concept is the same: Distribute cryptocurrency to proof-of-work miners as payment for validating transactions and securing the network against 51% attacks.\n\nDifferent crypto, different investors\n\nHalvings cut those miners\u2019 block rewards in half, leading to a boost to scarcity. As Kaiko\u2019s Carey mentioned, mining profit margins are simultaneously narrowed, especially in Bitcoin\u2019s case; there are less rewards for the same energy-intensive operations.\n\nUnless, of course, prices surge dramatically to make up the difference.\n\n\u201cThere clearly are speculators who dabble in Bitcoin in a big way, just as they dabble in Litecoin and other coins, but I would argue that the fundamentals of BTC are the strongest,\u201d Bob Ras, co-founder at tokenized security startup Sologenic, told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cAnd because the fundamentals are strong with BTC, this means that it\u2019s only natural the impact from the halving is experienced afterwards instead of before.\u201d\n\nLitecoin tends to rally hard leading up to its halvings because its users are mostly speculators, Ras reasoned, \u201cplaying ping pong of sorts\u201d until LTC whales begin dumping after the halving.\n\nBitcoin sees \u201cmega surges\u201d following its own halvings due to their \u201cdramatic impact on supply and scarcity,\u201d Ras said.\n\n\u201cAfter all, a lot of Bitcoin is self-custodied and therefore the availability of BTC on exchanges is relatively less on a proportional basis. So when that supply shock kicks in, and if demand stays the same or increases, then the only option is that of fireworks.\u201d\n\nAs tempting as it is to see the face of god in market reactions to halvings, correlation does not necessarily imply causation, and these milestones are no different \u2014 be they Bitcoin or Litecoin.\n\nStill, a wise investor would strap in for increased volatility. The halvings are coming.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Tech investor Chamath Palihapitiya, who said two years ago that bitcoin has replaced gold and predicted the digital currency would climb to $200,000, has a much more cautious view on cryptocurrencies these days.\n\n\"Crypto is dead in America,\" Palihapitiya said in the latest episode of the All-In podcast.\n\nPalihapitiya blamed crypto's demise largely on regulators, who have gotten much more aggressive in their pursuit of bad actors in the industry. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler has said crypto trading platforms should abide by strict U.S. securities laws.\n\nIn answering questions in front of lawmakers recently, Gensler connected the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank with the crypto industry.\n\n\"You had Gensler even blaming the banking crisis on crypto,\" Palihapitiya said. \"The United States authorities have firmly pointed their guns at crypto.\"\n\nThe SEC has ramped up its enforcement of the crypto industry, bearing down on companies and projects that the regulator alleges were selling unregistered securities.\n\nIn February, the agency proposed rules that would change which crypto firms can custody customer assets. In March, the SEC issued crypto exchange Coinbase a Wells notice \u2014 typically one of the final steps before it files charges \u2014 warning the company that it identified potential violations of U.S. securities law. Last week, the SEC charged the crypto asset trading platform Bittrex and its ex-CEO with operating an unregistered exchange.\n\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong told CNBC that his company is preparing for a yearslong court battle with the commission, and is also considering relocating outside the U.S. if it doesn't get improved regulatory clarity. Meanwhile, Bittrex has already announced it would wind down U.S. operations specifically due to \"continued regulatory uncertainty.\"\n\nThey \"were probably the ones that were the most threatening to the establishment,\" said Palihapitiya, referring to crypto companies. \"And they were the ones that, in fairness to the regulators, did push the boundaries more than any other sector of the startup economy.\"\n\n\"Now they're paying the price for that,\" he said. \"The bill has come due for them.\"\n\nGensler faced similar criticism from House Republicans over the agency's crackdown on cryptocurrency platforms during four hours of congressional testimony last week.\n\n\"Regulation by enforcement is not sufficient nor sustainable,\" said House Financial Services Committee Chairman Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C. \"You're punishing digital asset firms for allegedly not adhering to the law when they don't know it will apply to them.\"\n\nMcHenry said the SEC's approach was \"driving innovation overseas and endangering American competitiveness.\"\n\nGensler defended the agency's actions.\n\n\"We have a clear regulatory framework built up over 90 years,\" he said, adding that the exchanges \"are \"noncompliant generally, and they need to come into compliance.\"\n\nBitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, reached a record of about $69,000 in November 2021, when the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate was near zero and investors were flooding into risk. The market changed in a hurry last year, as the Fed began steadily raising rates to fight inflation.\n\nIn early 2021, Palihapitiya predicted on CNBC that bitcoin would rise from $39,000 at the time to $100,000 and then up to $200,000.\n\n\"In what period, I don't know,\" he said. \"Five years, 10 years, but it's going there. And the reason is because every time you see all of this stuff happening, it just reminds you that, wow, our leaders are not as trustworthy and reliable as they used to be.\"\n\nLater in 2021, just before the peak, he said bitcoin had \"effectively replaced gold.\"\n\nBitcoin is currently trading at just over $27,300, down 60% from its all-time high."

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe crypto winter has melted away, and bitcoin is set to flourish, a Standard Chartered note forecasted on Monday.\n\nThe world's biggest digital currency by market cap could surge to $100,000 by the end of 2024, the bank said, representing a 268% increase from current levels.\n\n\"We see potential for Bitcoin to reach the USD 100,000 level by end-2024, as we believe the much-touted 'crypto winter' is finally over,\" wrote Standard Chartered's Geoff Kendrick.\n\nOne of the reasons for the bullish outlook is the turmoil caused by Silicon Valley Bank's collapse last month. As worries of a banking contagion spread, bitcoin re-established its use case as a \"decentralized, trustless and scarce digital asset,\" according to the note.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the same time, key rivals to bitcoin lost ground, especially stablecoins, some of which lost their peg to the US dollar. In fact, some of the assets that backed their value were held in SVB.\n\n\"Against this backdrop, Bitcoin has benefited from its status as a branded safe haven, a perceived relative store of value and a means of remittance,\" Kendrick added.\n\nStandard Chartered now sees bitcoin's share of the total crypto market cap rising to the 50%-60% range, up from 45% today and from 40% before the SVB collapse.\n\nIn addition, the note said bitcoin's recent rebound back above $30,000 also represented a turnaround for crypto miners, who previously had seen mining margins get squeezed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin has since dipped below $30,000, but Kendrick said if prices remain well above mining costs ($15,000), miners will likely hold onto what they mine instead of selling.\n\n\"This creates price upside, in our view. In addition, with energy prices likely having peaked, the structural profitability backdrop for miners should improve, adding further upside,\" he wrote.\n\nBitcoin is also set to trade better in the future as the Federal Reserve is nearing the end of its tightening cycle, Kendrick said, noting that its correlation with the Nasdaq suggests the crypto should trade better if risk-on assets improve broadly.\n\nAnother tailwind is the coin's upcoming halving in 2024, which is when the reward given to miners is cut in half. This is to cap the supply of bitcoins, and has historically led to price increases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin could also see upswings thanks to regulatory changes that promote investor access to the market \u2014 such as the creation of digital asset ETFs and stablecoin regulation. Already, some proposals that have been passed in Europe hold positive implications on crypto volatility.\n\n\"While sources of uncertainty remain, we think the pathway to the USD 100,000 level is becoming clearer,\" Kendrick said."

However, even with its rising popularity, the sector has many obstacles to overcome before mass adoption is possible.\n\nThe rise of DeFi\n\nThe growth of DeFi\u2019s popularity was volatile and quick, which follows suit with the overall development of the crypto industry.

The DeFi space rose $29.6 billion in value, making the sector stand out against the performances of major asset classes like gold and oil.\n\nThe popularity of DeFi can be attributed to the increasing amount of decentralized applications (DApps) and the flow of users from centralized to decentralized exchanges, among other reasons. However, while the increasing popularity is a positive development, there are some caveats.\n\nRise in transaction costs\n\nOne of the caveats is the rising transaction costs once more users start using a network. Investors experienced this during the bull market in 2021; the Ethereum (ETH) network saw a large influx of transactions, mainly happening within the DeFi space. The result was steeply rising transaction costs on the network. Sending crypto became so expensive that users faced a significant barrier to interacting with DeFi DApps.\n\nAnother risk is that of vulnerabilities such as smart contract back door keys, massive centralization on single contracts, and counter-party risks of custodial stablecoins. With numerous bridge hacks plaguing the space, and failures of algorithmic protocols such as Terra, using DeFi DApps is certainly not without risk. However, the industry keeps evolving, with many new platforms aiming to improve the issues and challenges current DApps deal with.\n\nDeFi on Bitcoin Cash\n\nThanks to the continuous development since its foundation in 2017, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) can also perform as a vibrant environment for smart contract deployment and the creation of DeFi DApps on its UTXO mainchain. One new project that has recently launched is BCH Bull.\n\nWith the help of the AnyHedge protocol, BCH Bull lets users create long or hedge positions on several assets, such as the United States dollar, Bitcoin (BTC) and gold. Users can even add leverage to their on-chain trades. Roger Ver, a well-known Bitcoin Cash supporter and early investor in AnyHedge, said about this use case: \u201cAllowing people to permissionlessly lock the value of their Bitcoin Cash to the price of external legacy currencies is an incredibly useful tool for people who don\u2019t want to deal with cryptocurrency price volatility. That\u2019s why I chose to invest in AnyHedge.\u201d\n\nSource: BCH Bull\n\nScalable and no centralized smart contract risks\n\nThe main difference between comparable apps on Ethereum is that each trade has its own independent smart contract. Once two traders agree on the terms, the smart contract is initiated. This eliminates centralized security risks for smart contracts.\n\nFurthermore, the UTXO-based protocol of Bitcoin Cash prevents high transaction fees and makes the chain scalable, meaning fees don\u2019t increase even if the transaction volume on the network increases.\n\nSince October 2022, BCH Bull has been in beta, in which it has already created and redeemed over 3,000 smart contracts. The project has now been released into full production mode this month. Its growing user base can now initiate up to 90-day-long contracts at 2~3x the previous contract size, enjoying the security and scalability that Bitcoin Cash offers.\n\nLearn more about BCH Bull"

The original digital coin is currently trading around $27,400, after briefly topping $30,000 earlier in April. It finished last year near $16,500.\n\nThe world's most traded cryptocurrency has soared after each of the last three 'halvings' that have taken place since 2012, according to data from Bloomberg Intelligence and Matrixport. The process could help the coin gain at least 81%, the outlet reported.\n\nBitcoin 'halving' happens roughly every four years and is due next in April 2024. It's done to eventually cap the token's total supply at 21 million units, and cuts in half the rate at which new coins are released as well as the reward given to miners for their work in processing transactions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarkus Thielen, head of research and strategy at the digital-asset investment firm Matrixport, predicts that bitcoin will more than double its current price and reach around $65,623 by next April, Bloomberg reported. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jamie Douglas Coutts told the outlet he thinks the market has priced in 50% of the expected halving that's expected next year.\n\n\"Bitcoin cycles bottom around 12-18 months prior to the halving and this cycle structure looks similar to the past ones, albeit many things have changed \u2014 while the network is vastly stronger, bitcoin has never endured a prolonged severe economic contraction,\" Coutts told the publication.\n\nThe coin was trading at 27,618.70 at last check Monday, down from an all time high of almost $69,000 reached in November 2021.\n\nThe crypto industry took a hit in 2022 \u2014 a year dubbed a \"crypto winter\" \u2014 that saw overall market cap crash by more than $1.4 trillion, and bitcoin lose 64% of its value as the sector suffered a string of high-profile crypto bankruptcies including FTX and Three Arrows Capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If the collapse of FTX was indeed the bottom of this cycle, then history would suggest that we still have approximately 350 days of 'accumulation' before witnessing the characteristic post-halving breakout price action,\" said Jacob Joseph, an analyst at CCData, according to the Bloomberg report."

        "content": "Twelve years ago, on April 23, 2011, the world of cryptocurrency witnessed a cryptic milestone when Satoshi Nakamoto, the elusive mastermind behind Bitcoin, penned one of the final correspondences to software developer Mike Hearn. The mysterious individual, who never revealed his real identity to the world, stated that he had \"moved on to other things\" and asserted that the project (Bitcoin) was in \"good hands.\" Since then, Nakamoto's identity has been the subject of much speculation. Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto statue in Budapest features a reflective face(expansion.mx)\n\nIn December 2010, after the creation and initial implementation of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto vanished from the public eye. The last public message from this innovator was issued on December 12th, in which Nakamoto emphasized the need to work on denial-of-service (DoS) protection.\n\nHindustan Times - your fastest source for breaking news! Read now.\n\nAccording to Bitcoin.com, on April 23rd, 2011, Hearn received an email from Nakamoto in which he maintained that they had \"moved on to other things\" and expressed confidence in the project being in \"good hands with Gavin and everyone.\" Nakamoto also expressed hope for the continued development of Bitcoinj, Mike Hearn's Java version of Bitcoin, as it would provide Java developers with a project to work on. The email was titled, \"Holding coins in an unspendable state for a rolling time window.\"\n\nBitcoin.com then unveils another email from Nakamoto, \"I wish you wouldn't keep talking about me as a mysterious shadowy figure,\" and urged Andresen to focus on the open-source project and give more credit to the dev contributors, as it would help motivate them.\n\nIn March 2014, a Newsweek article claimed that creator of Bitcoin was a 64-year-old Japanese-American named Dorian Nakamoto. As a response message allegedly authored by Satoshi Nakamoto appeared on the P2P Foundation's online forum, stating, \"I am not Dorian Nakamoto.\"\n\nYears later technologist Andy Baio, in his blogpost claimed, to have stumbled upon a copy of Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin white paper on his Mac computer which may have revealed his true identity. Since then several theories have been floating whether the man behind world's biggest cryptocurrency was none other than Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.\n\nBaio's discovery sparked fresh speculation that Nakamoto could have been Steve Jobs. \"Was Steve Jobs actually Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of #bitcoin?\" tweeted Lark Davis, a Bitcoin investor and blogger with 1.1 million followers. \"Plus, Satoshi disappeared in December 2010, and then Jobs passed in October 2011. The timelines fit...\"\n\nThere is no concrete evidence linking Jobs to the creation of Bitcoin, and the appearance of the Bitcoin white paper on Mac computers seven years after Jobs' death makes it difficult to draw a direct connection.\n\nWhile the timelines of Nakamoto's disappearance and Jobs' passing do overlap, correlation does not necessarily imply causation. It's essential to consider that many individuals in the tech industry have been speculated to be Nakamoto, but none have been definitively confirmed. The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains one of the most intriguing mysteries in the world of cryptocurrency.\n\nThe debate over Nakamoto's identity continues, with some users agreeing with the theory, while others remain skeptical. As the enigma of Satoshi Nakamoto deepens, fans are left to wonder whether the mastermind behind Bitcoin was truly the late Apple co-founder, Steve Jobs. Regardless of the outcome, the mystery surrounding Nakamoto adds an intriguing layer to the already captivating world of cryptocurrency."

As an industry first, this new service allows customers to buy and invest in bitcoin while avoiding the hassle and risks associated with using a cryptocurrency exchange. After placing an order on Ballet's website, customers will be sent a cold storage card loaded with the purchased bitcoin. The seamless retail experience can be compared to buying gold and silver coins from an online precious metals retailer, with the gold and silver shipped to the customer.\n\nBallet Crypto Inc., Monday, April 24, 2023, Press release picture\n\n\"With our new service, we're offering a fundamentally new way to buy bitcoin that mimics the simplicity and convenience of buying gold and silver coins, while allowing customers to tap into the extraordinary investment potential of bitcoin,\" said Ballet founder and CEO Bobby Lee. \"We believe this service will make bitcoin accessible to hundreds of millions of new investors, and it will appeal to experienced users as well, as this is a great way to allow their friends and family members to easily buy and hold bitcoin,\" said Lee.\n\nThe purchased bitcoin will be delivered on Ballet's patented physical storage card, PURE Bitcoin, a variation of Ballet's flagship REAL Series cryptocurrency wallet. Similar to the REAL Series wallet, PURE Bitcoin is a stainless steel card that holds the bitcoin in cold storage, with the specific bitcoin denomination clearly shown on each card. This makes each loaded PURE Bitcoin card a physical bearer asset for bitcoin. There are no electronic components, providing superior durability and protection from cybersecurity threats such as hackers and malware. It's designed with tamper-evident security and anti-counterfeiting measures, and just like the REAL Series, it's incredibly easy to use. Once the customer receives their loaded PURE Bitcoin card, they can easily move the bitcoin on-chain to their wallet of choice. Alternatively, customers can choose to leave the bitcoin on the PURE Bitcoin cold storage card for long-term safekeeping. The bitcoins are held safely in cold storage on this physical card using Ballet's patented 2FKG implementation of the open-source BIP38 industry standard, which allows the user to generate the private keys to their digital bitcoins privately, at the time and location of their choosing.\n\nStory continues\n\nBy offering a retail experience similar to purchasing gold and silver coins, Ballet's new service aims to bridge the gap between traditional investment options and the surging demand for bitcoin. For the first time ever, customers can place an order on Ballet's website and then take physical delivery of their bitcoin securely, all without the need to use an online cryptocurrency exchange. By eliminating the need for an exchange, this service minimizes potential exposure to cybersecurity threats and reduces the learning curve for new Bitcoin users. Ballet is currently selling physical PURE Bitcoin cards in denominations of 0.1, 0.025, 0.01, and 0.005 BTC.\n\nThe innovative, user-friendly design of PURE Bitcoin cards makes them an ideal gift option for those looking to introduce friends and family to the world of bitcoin investing. They can also be advantageous for inheritance purposes, because unlike other cryptocurrency storage methods, heirs would not need technical expertise to access private keys or encrypted digital wallets.\n\nBallet is currently offering bitcoin for sale in the United States in states where regulations allow, with work ongoing to expand availability into more jurisdictions.\n\nBitcoin for physical delivery can be purchased at: https://bitcoin.ballet.com/\n\nAbout Ballet:\n\nBallet is a US-based cryptocurrency wallet company founded in 2019 by Bobby Lee, the former CEO of BTCC, one of the world's first and largest Bitcoin exchanges.

        "title": "Bitcoin NFTs on the Rise: The Impact of Ordinals on the Bitcoin Network - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "It all started with Taproot, the most ambitious upgrade in Bitcoin's history that went live in November 2021, the first major upgrade since the Segregated Witness (SegWit) update in 2017.\n\nThe Taproot upgrade significantly improved the efficiency, scalability, and privacy of the Bitcoin network and allowed for more sophisticated smart contracts and transactions to be created.\n\nHowever, this upgrade didn't really take off until this year when a project called Ordinals introduced a new use case to the Bitcoin network \u2014 NFTs.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals: The Idea and the Base\n\nNFTs saw an explosion in popularity in 2020, but they were mostly minted and traded on the Ethereum blockchain. With the release of Ordinals from ex-Bitcoin Core collaborator, Casey Rodarmor, NFTs are finally appearing on Bitcoin.\n\nKeep Reading Nigeria Presses Binance amid Economic Turmoil and Detains Executives\n\nOrdinals use Bitcoin's scripting language and Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) to build a new kind of Non-fungible Token.\n\nWhile the ordinal inscriptions first began in mid-Dec. 2022, they didn't catch on until late January this year. According to Dune Analytics, 641,143 ordinals have been inscribed to date.\n\nBut, What Is It Exactly?\n\nOrdinal Theory is a numbering scheme that assigns a number to each Satoshi (or sats which is 1/100,000,000 of a whole Bitcoin), allowing each sat to be tracked and transferred. These numbers are referred to as Ordinals.\n\nEach Ordinal is numbered in the sequence they are mined. The creation of Ordinals allows for digital assets, such as NFTs and stablecoins, to be attached to the Ordinal.\n\nOrdinals can further be engraved with content, such as images or video files, through a process called inscription. This creates collectibles or on-chain cryptographic artifacts, now commonly known as Bitcoin NFTs.\n\nThe difference between these NFTs and the NFTs typically found on Ethereum is that this new kind of Bitcoin NFT is stored permanently directly in the Bitcoin Blockchain, while the traditional NFT is stored on third-party databases, with the collectors in possession of only a link to that file within their digital wallet.\n\nThis makes Bitcoin Ordinal NFTs far more attractive for collectors looking to store their NFTs for an extended time without worrying about their NFTs disappearing. In February, Ordinal NFT popularity skyrocketed, increasing 25% in the average network fees per block, consuming nearly 30% of the maximum block space.\n\nWhile Ordinal NFT activity has grown tremendously, some groups in the Bitcoin community are against this new use case as they believe it would harm Bitcoin's financial and transactional uses.\n\nAdam Back, the CEO of Blockstream, went so far as calling for censorship \"as a form of discouragement\" in a now-deleted tweet. However, creator Rodarmor, believes that his project is simply an extension of Satoshi's original vision for Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals Landscape\n\nEver since Ordinals' entry into the Bitcoin community, more and more members have been inscribing media onto the Bitcoin blockchain. And, the hype surrounding Ordinals is getting bigger and crazier with each passing day.\n\nRecently, 'BRC-20' was launched, allowing people to mint and transfer any tokens they want through the Bitcoin blockchain. This latest development, which is still in its very early stages, has got a lot of creators and collectors excited and is now being used as an equivalent of Ethereum's ERC-20 token standard. Besides 'BRC-20', some notable Bitcoin NFT collections include Bitcoin Rocks, Ordinal Loops, and OnChain Monkey.\n\nTaproot Wizards is another popular project that involves a hand-drawn collection of 2,101 Wizards created by developer Udi Wertheimer in cooperation with Bitcoin mining company Luxor. This collection is known for the largest transaction ever processed on the Bitcoin network, with the first entry, inscription 652, taking up a 4MB space.\n\nBitcoin shrooms is yet another one, with the first shroom being Inscription 19, created by an unknown group of individuals. Currently, there are only 210 bitcoin shrooms inscribed into Bitcoin Blockchain. Popular NFT project Crypto Punks has also made its way to Bitcoin in the form of Ordinal Punks. These are 100 distinct punk characters, with the first one recorded as inscription 642 on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nEven the creators of Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Yuga Labs, have sold their original art collection through Ordinals. The collection, called 'TwelveFold', debuted at the end of February and comprised 300 generative art pieces, limited in number, and each one inscribed to the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIt is one of the highest-profile launches through Ordinal so far. All the pieces of the collection are arranged on 12x12 grids, which is a nod to how the Bitcoin blockchain stores its data. The art collection blends 3D graphics with hand-drawn features.\n\nIn an early-March auction, the Bitcoin NFT set attracted 3,246 bids over a period of 24 hours. It concluded with 288 successful bidders spending a combined $16.49 million in BTC. Of these, the highest bid was for 7.1159 BTC (about $159,500), while the lowest successful bid was for 2.2501 BTC (about $50k). The remaining 12 pieces were held for contributors to be distributed through Yugas charity programs.\n\nThe Ecosystem Evolves\n\nBitcoin's ability to execute smart contracts is much more limited than Ethereum and other blockchains that feature established NFT markets, as is its product stack, including infrastructure, tools, and platforms. However, the hype surrounding Ordinals is growing each day, which can see the largest cryptocurrency emerging as an Ethereum rival in the world of NFTs.\n\nNot to mention, the Bitcoin blockchain now has a purpose beyond peer-to-peer payments. This has enabled the Bitcoin blockchain to engage with digital content creators, the mainstay of the Internet economy, which can unlock a flood of new creative innovations across the space. As this happens, it will push others within the crypto community to create economically viable protocols on Bitcoin.\n\nOn top of that, Ordinals could improve the security budget scenario that may come up in the future, as mining rewards decline amid subsequent halvings. After all, growing demand for Bitcoin ordinals would incentivize miners to keep the network secure.\n\nWith Casey Rodamor's Ordinal project growing from a niche interest into accelerated technology capturing the attention of collectors and developers alike, Bitcoin's ecosystem could finally see all the developments to drive not just NFT but also DeFi to flourish on the Bitcoin network."

        "title": "What Is Proof-of-work (PoW)? All You Need to Know - Blockworks",
        "content": "Proof-of-work (PoW) is a blockchain consensus mechanism that incentivizes network validation by rewarding miners for adding computational power and difficulty to the network. It is a lottery system where miners increase their likelihood of receiving the reward the more power they add.\n\nThe consensus mechanism represents about 60% of the total crypto market capitalization.\n\nThe history of proof-of-work\n\nThe origin of proof-of-work can be traced back to 1993 when Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor were looking for a solution to deter email spam and DoS attacks. Their paper on pricing via processing outlined the basics of proof-of-work.\n\nIn 1997, Adam Black integrated their idea into Hashcash. His algorithm made it difficult for spammers to send large volumes of emails by requiring senders to include a computationally expensive string of characters in the email.\n\nThe solution to spam was essentially increasing the cost to send individual emails. This experiment proved that you could use computational difficulty to represent the value of something online. This inspired others to see if they could use the same idea to make a digital representation of cash.\n\nThe idea made an appearance again in Nick Szabo\u2019s so-called \u2018Theory of Collectibles\u2019 and the paper \u201cShelling Out: The Origins of Money.\u201d In 2004, these ideas inspired Hal Finney to create a version of it called reusable proof-of-work. And in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto famously created the proof-of-work consensus mechanism for Bitcoin. It was the first decentralized implementation that solved the double spending problem and made bitcoin the first successful form of digital cash.\n\nWhat made proof-of-work different?\n\nPrevious iterations before Bitcoin failed because they required centralized entities to prevent the double spending of digital tokens.\n\nSatoshi\u2019s improvements to proof-of-work used game theory to solve this problem. It made a way to incentivize anonymous volunteers called miners to verify the validity of all Bitcoin transactions \u2013 ensuring that no one is double-spending. This invention was the first time a decentralized network of participants could secure trust without a centralized intermediary.\n\nThis gamification incentivizes network participation so well that nation-states such as El Salvador use bitcoin as a reserve currency. But as the cryptocurrency currently employs approximately 99 terawatt hours of electricity per year, many believe this growth is unsustainable.\n\nThe \u201cwork\u201d in the proof-of-work consensus mechanism is the source of these unsustainability concerns. To explain, let\u2019s first outline the fundamentals.\n\nRead More: The Beginner\u2019s Guide to Consensus Mechanisms\n\nProof-of-work (PoW) fundamentals\n\nMaintaining the integrity and security of all transactions in the network is the ultimate objective behind the proof-of-work consensus mechanism. Here is a breakdown:\n\nThe work(ers)\n\nProof-of-work blockchains are supported through a network of decentralized computers called nodes. They are tasked with two things: accepting batches of transactions from other nodes and validating (or proposing) new blocks of transactions to the network.\n\nThese nodes are also called miners because they spend computing power and resources in return for the network\u2019s underlying cryptocurrency.\n\nThe \u201cwork\u201d in proof-of-work is the computational power nodes have to contribute in validating a new block of transactions. This power is represented by the SHA-256 cryptographic hash function, and it sets this consensus mechanisms apart from its counterparts.\n\nAn algorithm called the difficulty adjustment ensures that it will take the entire network a fixed set of time to validate new blocks of transactions. The difficulty adjustment occurs approximately every 2,016 blocks (about once every two weeks) to maintain the target block time of 10 minutes. Miners coming and going from the network on an individual basis do nothing to affect difficulty level minute to minute, or day to day.\n\nMiners win the reward when they guess a hash that falls below the threshold provided by the network. Once a miner finds the valid block hash, it broadcasts this information to other miners who can quickly validate and add the new block to their blockchain copies. This validation process eliminates the possibility of miners including malicious transactions, such as an attempt by a user to double-spend coins.\n\nThe reward\n\nThere is an encoded rule regarding the amount paid to the miner who completes the proof-of-work. At the time of writing, miners earn a fixed 6.25 BTC per block, plus any user transaction fees. This reward potential incentivizes miners to compete in the proof-of-work and remain honest, as any attempt to cheat the system would waste resources.\n\nThe reward amount is set to half every 210,000 blocks (approximately four years). This deflation rate is referred to as the halving cycle. Many fear that if bitcoin\u2019s price fails to keep pace, miners will lose the incentive to participate. But as miners disconnect from the network, the difficulty level drops accordingly. This balancing act makes the cost to mine bitcoin drop as well.\n\nThe economics of bitcoin mining though are not straight forward. There are many financing factors that drive miners to stay online even when they are unprofitable.\n\nRead more: Is Bitcoin Mining Still Profitable? The Economics Explained\n\nThe difference between proof-of-work and proof-of-stake\n\nThe main difference between proof-of-work and proof-of-stake is the difficulty requirement. In proof-of-stake, validating nodes compete for blocks by locking or delegating more of the network\u2019s token to the network. This requires less energy but can make the entry barrier more expensive.\n\nA proof-of-work consensus model is used more for cryptocurrency networks focused on payment and monetary use cases. Other blockchains, such as Ethereum, Cardano and Solana, focus on powering decentralized applications and utilize the proof-of-stake (PoS) model.\n\nRead More: Proof-of-work vs. Proof-of-Stake\n\nProof-of-work examples\n\nMore than 60% of the cryptocurrency market capitalization utilizes proof-of-work algorithms. However, the most valuable networks implementing the consensus model are as follows:\n\nBitcoin: The network is the world\u2019s most secure and decentralized PoW system. Bitcoin\u2019s success has primarily been attributed to Satoshi\u2019s ingenious PoW engineering, which beyond security, provides sustainable economics for network participants. Litecoin: Litecoin launched in 2011 as a Bitcoin fork, copying aspects of the legacy network, such as its PoW consensus model. Litecoin is often called the silver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold and remains among the top crypto assets by market value. Dogecoin: Meme-inspired cryptocurrency Dogecoin launched in 2013, implementing a PoW technology with roots traceable to Litecoin. Dogecoin and Litecoin enable faster transactions but are generally less secure than Bitcoin. Monero: Monero is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that implements a proof-of-work algorithm. Its unique features, including ring signatures and stealth addresses, make it difficult to trace transactions on the blockchain. Monero\u2019s proof-of-work algorithm is designed to be ASIC-resistant, meaning it is more accessible to individual miners rather than large mining operations. Bitcoin Cash: Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency that was created in 2017 as a result of a hard fork from the Bitcoin blockchain. It utilizes a proof-of-work consensus algorithm, similar to Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash aims to improve on the scalability and transaction speed of Bitcoin by increasing the block size limit to 32 MB. However, it has faced criticism for centralization due to the dominance of a few mining pools in its network.\n\nHow proof-of-work works\n\nBitcoin mining through proof-of-work works similarly to buying lottery tickets with a prize draw every 10 minutes. Anyone can participate by purchasing a Bitcoin mining machine and plugging it into the network. Although everyone has the same odds of being drawn, buying more tickets increases the statistical likelihood of winning the lottery.\n\nIn the above example, the lottery tickets represent the hash rate deployed, while the prize is the BTC reward paid for successfully creating a Bitcoin block. Hash rate is the number of hashes per second mining equipment can carry out to find the above-noted cryptographic hash function. The more efficient a mining device is, the higher chances a miner has of winning the block rewards. For instance, An S19j Pro machine can perform 104 terahashes per second (TH/s), the equivalent of 104 trillion guesses or tickets per second.\n\nMeanwhile, users can join mining pools; comparable to office pools or syndicates. Joining the pool voluntarily would increase their chances of winning the lottery, unlike solo mining, where the odds of winning a Bitcoin block today are extremely rare.\n\nHowever, every win on a public mining pool is split among the members in proportion to their hashrate. Mining pool participants are not obligated to remain in the pool. Many criticize pools for being a centralizing force in the network. But individual participants provide a counterweight to that centralization. They can leave the pool or syndicate and do so very easily, a feature that comes in handy if the pool attempts to become dishonest.\n\nLike the lottery, the rules of participation and potential rewards are encoded in the Bitcoin software. Anyone can verify these rules and agree to play by them if they choose to set up a Bitcoin mining operation.\n\nProof-of-work and mining\n\nProof-of-work is closely intertwined with mining. PoW defines the exact process through which miners show peers that they have performed the required computation by generating a hash that matches the target for the block. On the other hand, mining focuses on adding a new block to the blockchain and receiving the associated coin rewards.\n\nConsidering how Bitcoin transactions are processed provides a clear insight into the relationship between PoW and mining. All user transactions on the Bitcoin network end up in a memory pool (mempool) from which miners select transactions to add to the next Bitcoin block. Every miner enters the race to create a new block for the Bitcoin blockchain, picking several transactions from the mempool and bundling them into a candidate block.\n\nHowever, before a candidate block becomes accepted as valid, the miner must perform computations that generate a hash below the target set by the Bitcoin proof-of-work algorithm. The first miner to produce a matching hash for their candidate block broadcasts it to other miners, who can easily verify and validate its addition to the blockchain record.\n\nThe successful miner receives the block rewards and associated transaction fees, having added a new valid block to the blockchain. Thus, the Bitcoin blockchain height grows while the race for mining the next block begins.\n\nWhy is proof-of-work important?\n\nThe proof-of-work algorithm is vital for several reasons. The most compelling is that it provides a secure and decentralized mechanism for network participants to maintain the integrity of the blockchain ledger. PoW incentivizes miners worldwide to expend computing power to validate blocks, thus filling the role usually played by a central entity such as a bank.\n\nAnother primary benefit of a PoW is that it regulates the creation of new coins. In Bitcoin\u2019s case, the algorithm includes a mining difficulty adjustment that stabilizes the rate miners can produce new blocks. Bitcoin\u2019s code specifies a target of 10 minutes per block, with the algorithm designed to increase the difficulty of finding a new block hash if the hash rate grows to a point where miners produce blocks faster than the average.\n\nWithout the PoW-linked mining difficulty adjustment, miners can drain the BTC supply faster than required for a sustainable economy. Moreover, as the network\u2019s hashrate on a PoW chain grows, it becomes impractical for a bad actor to attack the system.\n\nA Braiins study puts the conservative cost of attacking the Bitcoin network through physical hashrate at $5.5 billion. However, such an operation is impractical to execute in the real world because the cost attack outweighs any perceived benefits. Besides that, a prospective attacker can immediately receive rewards for acting honestly and contributing hash power to Bitcoin.\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages\n\nBeing the earliest consensus model for blockchains, the pros and cons of proof-of-work systems have only become evident as the industry matures. Despite newer innovations, PoW remains the most proven, time-tested method for achieving consensus on a public blockchain.\n\nAdvantages Disadvantages \u2013 High level of security and decentralization\n\n\u2013 Censorship resistant\n\n\u2013 Economically incentivizes miners to protect the network\n\n\u2013 Promotes the adoption of renewable energy sources \u2013 Slower transaction speed and high fees\n\n\u2013 Mining requires high capital and operational expenses compared to newer consensus models\n\nProblems with proof-of-work\n\nEnergy usage\n\nThe most prevalent criticism of proof-of-work is that it wastes energy. Multiple research estimates that Bitcoin uses more energy than several midsized countries such as Norway and Argentina. Still, other findings assume that the Bitcoin network significantly contributes to climate change and will continue to do so as adoption grows.\n\nNonetheless, evidence points to the contrary regarding the impact of Bitcoin and its novel proof-of-work system. The Bitcoin network consumes significantly less energy than existing monetary systems and other major industries, including gold mining and financial sectors.\n\nAnother vital point to consider is that energy being the only variable in Bitcoin mining, incentivizes miners to seek out the cheapest methods, such as renewable sources. Over time, miners are adopting these cost-friendly energy channels to maximize profits. Industry estimates reveal that nearly 59% of bitcoin mining utilizes environment-friendly energy sources, much higher than other sectors and countries.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin\u2019s PoW technology allows individuals and organizations to tap into the energy that may otherwise be wasted. This is especially true for power generated in locations such as oil drilling sites producing flare gas, agricultural regions harnessing biomass energy or jurisdictions where it is impracticable to transport such energy. The portability of Bitcoin mining machines allows miners to monetize such power and provide economic value to the local communities.\n\nScalability\n\nAnother common criticism against PoW systems such as Bitcoin is that they do not scale as efficiently as newer consensus models. Bitcoin advocates argue that Bitcoin\u2019s unique positioning as a global monetary system means the delayed confirmation time contributes immensely to the network\u2019s security. PoW systems are optimized for security and scale on secondary layers such as the Lightning Network implementations on Bitcoin and Litecoin.\n\nCentralization\n\nLastly, critics also argue that proof-of-work consensus algorithms have become more centralized over the years. The increasing cost to entry and computing difficulty has consolidated network consensus decisions around a handful of major mining pools.\n\nThese pools largely control the consensus decisions of the network because they collectively have more hashing power than individual miners. But a lot of this power is contingent that the pools act in good faith \u2014 as contributors can exit the pool at any time.\n\nFor example, Bitmain, one of the largest manufacturers of cryptocurrency mining hardware, controlled several mining pools that had more than 43% of the hashing power in 2018. With a few strategic moves, Bitmain may have been able to execute a double spend attack. The damage that would have had on the network and their reputation probably prevented them from executing the attack.\n\nWhat this means for investors\n\nContrary to the mainstream notion that PoW systems are harmful to the environment, the Bitcoin mining industry\u2019s push toward renewable energy sources reveals that the technology may not have the impact they think. Advocates even argue that Bitcoin has the potential to be a net positive to the planet.\n\nTying the Bitcoin network\u2019s security to a tangible real-world asset like energy makes the network more robust, especially at optimum hash rate. It also lets investors get exposure to the underlying BTC asset through mining stocks such as Riot Blockchain, Hive, Marathon Digital, and Hut8. Additionally, while other faster and more innovative consensus models have emerged in recent years, the underlying networks tend to become increasingly centralized.\n\nBeing a time-tested model for securing public blockchains means that PoW will likely continue to play a key role as the industry onboards more mainstream audiences. Rather than supersede the legacy consensus model, newer systems highlight the unique properties of PoW and make it more attractive to investors that prioritize security and censorship resistance.\n\nThe future of proof-of-work\n\nProof-of-work introduced the world to blockchains. Miners compete in a never-ending race to produce new blocks and collect associated rewards, thus making it increasingly difficult for bad actors to compromise the network. The novel consensus mechanism provides unparalleled security by incentivizing the use of computing power to protect the integrity of the underlying ledger.\n\nThe PoW consensus algorithm aims to provide a stable economy by regulating the coin\u2019s issuance using the difficulty adjustment implementation. The coin\u2019s supply is distributed more efficiently as miners cannot automatically boost their holdings or stake on the network by accumulating more tokens.\n\nThe legacy consensus model continues to power the largest market share of public blockchains and will likely always remain the most secure option for establishing consensus among decentralized networks.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

The selling could pick up further if the 50-day SMA cracks.\n\nThe BTC/USDT pair could then tumble to the breakout level of $25,250. This is an important level to keep an eye on because if this support crumbles, the pair may plunge to $20,000.\n\nBuyers will have to push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA to signal a comeback. That could attract buying and push the price toward the $31,000\u2013$32,500 resistance zone.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe pair bounced off $27,125 and reached the 20-day EMA. This is the first hurdle that the bulls need to cross to start a strong recovery. The pair may then reach the 50-day SMA, where the bears will again try to mount a strong defense.\n\nIf the price turns down from the current level and slides below $27,125, it will suggest that the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on every minor rally. That will increase the likelihood of a fall to $26,500 and eventually to $25,250.\n\nBNB price analysis\n\nBNB (BNB) is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears. Sellers are active above $338, while the bulls are fiercely defending the 50-day SMA ($316).\n\nBNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe BNB/USDT pair rebounded off the 50-day SMA on April 21, and the bulls are attempting to clear the hurdle at $338. If they succeed, it will enhance the prospects of a rally above $346. The pair may then soar toward $400. The gradually upsloping 20-day EMA ($325) and the RSI in the positive territory indicate that bulls have a slight edge.\n\nIf bears want to prevent the up-move, they will have to yank the price back below the 50-day SMA. That could accelerate selling and sink the pair to $300 and thereafter toward $280.\n\nBNB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the price rebounded off the support near $316 and has reached the 50-SMA. If bulls overcome this obstacle, the pair will try to rise to $338 and subsequently to $346. A break above this level could witness a pick-up in bullish momentum.\n\nThe first support to watch on the downside is the 20-day EMA. If this support gives way, it will suggest that the pair may consolidate between $315 and $335 for some time. The advantage will tilt in favor of the bears if the $315 support gives way.\n\nCardano price analysis\n\nCardano\u2019s ADA (ADA) turned down and plunged back below the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern on April 20. This indicates that the bears are trying to trap the aggressive bulls. A minor positive in favor of the buyers is that they are trying to guard the 50-day SMA ($0.37).\n\nADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($0.40) has turned down, and the RSI is just below the midpoint, indicating that sellers are trying to seize control. If the price plummets below the 50-day SMA, it will suggest that the bears are in the driver\u2019s seat. The ADA/USDT pair could then collapse to $0.30.\n\nConversely, if buyers want to retain their supremacy, they will have to quickly thrust the price back above the neckline. If they manage to do that, the pair could witness solid buying. The pair may then surge to $0.46.\n\nADA/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears pulled the price below the uptrend line and are trying to flip the level into resistance on a retest. The downsloping 20-EMA and the RSI in the negative territory indicate that bears have the upper hand. If the price slips below $0.38, the selling could intensify, and the pair may plunge to $0.34.\n\nThis negative view will invalidate in the near term if buyers propel the price back above the uptrend line. Such a move will suggest that the recent breakdown may have been a bear trap. The recovery is likely to pick up momentum after buyers push the price above the 50-SMA.\n\nRelated: Chinese city public servants to receive digital yuan salaries starting May\n\nMonero price analysis\n\nMonero (XMR) turned down from the neckline of the developing inverse H&S pattern, but the sharp recovery from lower levels indicates aggressive buying on dips.\n\nXMR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBuyers have pushed the price back above the 20-day EMA ($157) and will again try to challenge the neckline. If this level is scaled, it will complete the bullish setup, clearing the path for a potential rise to $185 and thereafter to the pattern target of $199.\n\nIf the price turns down from the current level or the neckline, it will signal that bears are selling on rallies. A break and close below $149 will signal that bears have seized control. The XMR/USDT pair may then slump to $145 and later to $140.\n\nXMR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe pair is trading inside a descending channel pattern on the four-hour chart. The snapback from the support line of the channel shows solid buying at lower levels. If buyers sustain the price above the 50-SMA, the pair could rally to the resistance line of the channel.\n\nContrarily, if the price continues lower and slides below the 20-EMA, it will suggest that the pair may remain stuck inside the channel for some more time. The bears will gain the upper hand on a break below the channel.\n\nToncoin price analysis\n\nToncoin (TON) has formed a bearish descending triangle pattern, but a positive sign in favor of the buyers is that the price has been trading near the resistance line of the triangle for the past few days.\n\nTON/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls will try to drive and sustain the price above the resistance line, which will invalidate the bearish setup. A breakdown of a negative pattern usually results in an up-move because aggressive traders who may have gone short in anticipation of a decline cover their positions.\n\nAdditionally, bullish traders who have been sitting on the sidelines due to the negative setup jump in to buy. Above the resistance line, the TON/USDT pair could rally to $2.64 and thereafter to $2.90.\n\nThis positive view will invalidate in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below $2.20.\n\nTON/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the pair is rising inside an ascending channel pattern. In the near term, the bears are trying to protect the $2.33 level, but the bulls continue to attack the level with vigor.\n\nIf the $2.33 level gives way, the pair may start its journey toward the resistance line of the channel near $2.45. Alternatively, if the price once again turns down from $2.33, the bears will try to sink the pair to the support line of the channel.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

But elevated borrowing costs can also lead to a slump in demand for goods and services, slowing the economy and dragging down stocks and other assets."

        "content": "The whales keep waking up. Today, another sleeping HODLer moved 400 Bitcoin\u2014worth nearly $11 million at current prices\u2014after not having transacted for nearly 12 years.\n\nMonday\u2019s movements showed the whale moved 360 BTC ($9.8 million) to one wallet while the remaining 40 BTC to a number of other locations.\n\nThe term \u201cwhale\u201d refers to Bitcoin investors who have more of the cryptocurrency than others. The hoarders often sit on their millions of dollars in digital assets, and sometimes reemerge after a long stretch of time to move their investment to other addresses.\n\nSuch movements are becoming more commonplace: Just last week, a whale moved over 279 BTC, or $7.6 million, to new wallets after a decade of inactivity.\n\nAnd in February, an old BTC address that had not budged in 11 years made a transaction by moving $9.6 million worth of the cryptocurrency. The coins had appreciated by 120,000,000% over the years, with the lucky investor having first received the Bitcoin when it was worth $8 a coin.\n\nBut although large movements do happen regularly, according to an analyst who spoke to Decrypt, an investor who hasn\u2019t budged their coins in a decade isn\u2019t too common.\n\nKirill Kretov, a developer of tools for automated trading, said: \u201cAn awakening of 2011 is rather rare, but we don\u2019t know how much their owner has in total. It might be that recent large awakenings could also be attributed to the same entity.\u201d\n\nWhales are by far the most successful investors: Bitcoin is up over 40,000% in the past 10 years. Those who sit on the cryptocurrency for the long-term make the biggest profits, while inexperienced retail investors who buy and sell crypto in the short-term tend to lose out, research shows.\n\nToday\u2019s whale made a number of large transactions to move the cryptocurrency.\n\nNumber of Bitcoin Whales Drops to Lowest Level Since 2019\n\nBitcoin right now is trading for about $27,280, according to CoinGecko, down more than10% in the past week, and 1.3% in the past 24 hours."

        "title": "7 Things That Need to Happen for Crypto to Rebound - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The crypto market has been a wild ride so far, and the road got even bumpier than usual in 2022. A lot of folks are left wondering what it would take for the sector to bounce back for real. The glory days of 2021, where Bitcoin (BTC -0.21%) nearly reached $70,000 per digital coin and Ethereum (ETH -1.09%) peaked just below $4,900, almost feel like a fever dream. Were those soaring prices ever real?\n\nNow that things are starting to calm down a bit, there are a few crucial factors that could steer the market's course. I believe that blockchain tech and cryptos will hit the mainstream eventually, but in terms of exact timing, we're all just throwing darts at the calendar.\n\nThe future of crypto investments depends on so many factors, seemingly unrelated, that add up to a massive speed bump at the moment. Settling all of these issues at once would release a bull run worthy of a sweltering summer in Pamplona, but we are far more likely to see a gradual process of steps forward and then back again.\n\nSevillian Flamenco, anyone? Follow the beat!\n\nLet me count the ways\n\nAhem. Not sure why I'm daydreaming about summer in Spain when discussing the future of crypto. I guess I'm getting excited about the game-changing promise and pulse-pounding risks of cryptocurrencies. So let's explore the factors that could reduce the risks and release the crushing pressure on crypto prices.\n\nRegulatory clarity: One of the primary challenges facing the crypto market is the lack of a clear regulatory framework. I mean, this is Step #1 for good reason -- most of the improvements below can't move forward until we have firmer laws and regulations around ownership, taxation, and trading of cryptocurrencies. Governments and regulatory bodies -- in America and around the world -- need to establish well-defined rules and guidelines for the industry to foster innovation while also ensuring consumer protection. Scalability solutions: Scalability has long been a hurdle for cryptocurrencies, especially for widely used networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Using effective performance-boosting solutions such as the Lightning Network and Optimism could significantly improve transaction speeds and lower fees, making cryptocurrencies more attractive for everyday use. Institutional adoption: For cryptocurrencies to rebound, institutional investors must continue embracing digital assets. As more corporations and financial institutions invest in cryptocurrencies and incorporate them into their operations, this could create a ripple effect, ultimately boosting the entire market. Enhanced security: As cyberattacks and fraud continue to plague the crypto space, enhancing security measures is crucial. I mean, the cryptocurrencies themselves are often quite robust, but the trading exchanges and other institutions that manage them have not always held up to scrutiny. More robust security protocols and tools on this level will help protect investors and instill greater confidence in digital assets. Education and awareness: The general public's understanding of cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology remains limited. For crypto to rebound, it's essential to raise awareness and educate people about the benefits, risks, and potential applications of digital assets. Lots of people are under the impression that serious wealth management tools like Bitcoin and advanced financial transaction systems such as Ethereum are immature playthings or outright scams. In reality, these innovative assets will probably change the nature of money, payments, ownership, and transactions on a global scale. Yes, that's serious business. I am not exaggerating the long-term promise of properly regulated cryptocurrencies. A more informed public is more likely to embrace and adopt crypto-based financial concepts. Mainstream integration: And the educational requirement dovetails neatly with my next point. The whole reason why cryptocurrencies are valuable in the first place is because they can help billions of people do many things in a cheaper, faster, more reliable way. But first, the consumer-facing tools that make it happen must be invented, developed, and cleared of showstopping bugs. In other words, digital assets must become more seamlessly integrated into everyday life. From using cryptocurrencies for daily transactions to implementing blockchain technology in various industries, making crypto more accessible and user-friendly will encourage broader adoption. Market stability: Finally, for cryptocurrencies to regain their footing, the market needs to stabilize. Calmer volatility and a more mature crypto market would go a long way toward inviting more risk-averse investors into the crypto space. That includes the deep-pocketed financial institutions mentioned earlier.\n\nSo there you have it, folks! While these factors could set the stage for a crypto rebound, remember that it's up to us investors to keep our wits about us and make educated decisions before jumping in. The market's future might be shrouded in mystery, but all you need is some patience, knowledge, and a dash of courage. With those wealth-building tools in your pocket, you could witness cryptocurrencies going mainstream and early crypto investors reaping the rewards in the market."

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin outflows hit $53.1 million last week\u2014meaning that, for the first time in six weeks, more funds flowed out of digital asset investment products than in.\n\nProfit-taking is largely to blame, especially considering there were few macroeconomic triggers that could influence BTC's price, says a new report from digital asset investment firm CoinShares.\n\nAnd that would suggest that meaningfully staying above the psychologically significant threshold of $30,000 could be a tough nut to crack for bulls. As of Monday morning, Bitcoin was sliding towards $27,000 and down 9% from the last week, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOverall, digital asset investment products saw total outflows of $30 million in the seven days through April 21\u2014with CoinShares XBT, ProShares, and 3iQ the hardest-hit providers. The providers all manage exchange-traded products pegged to cryptocurrencies, an indirect way for institutional investors to get exposure to crypto markets without actually holding it.\n\nBut the devil's in the details. According to CoinShares head of research James Butterfill, there's one cryptocurrency that's bucking the trend in a big way.\n\nBasking in the glow of the successful \"Shapella\" upgrade, Ethereum actually enjoyed inflows of $17 million last week\u2014putting it far ahead of major altcoins, like Solana, Cardano, XRP, and Litecoin, which were mostly flat.\n\nThis indicates investors are feeling confident now that validators on Ethereum's proof-of-stake network can withdraw staked ETH if they so wish.\n\nButterfill also revealed that inflows into ETH-based funds came solely from Europe, which is fresh from approving much-welcomed, landmark legislation on cryptocurrencies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAll of this comes as regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. casts a long shadow over American crypto firms\u2014with the SEC's crackdown potentially prompting investors to sit on the sidelines.\n\nThere was also a clear continental divide when it came to Bitcoin.\n\n\"Regionally, the profit-taking was almost solely from North America, which saw outflows totaling $54 million,\" Butterfill wrote. \"This was offset by the continued optimistic sentiment in Germany which saw inflows totalling $29 million.\"\n\nThat optimism in Germany has undoubtedly been driven by the country's friendly tax regime, which states that cryptocurrency offloaded after 12 months isn't subject to capital gains."

        "title": "Do bitcoin developers owe fiduciary duties to the true owners of a defrauded cryptoasset owner? - Outer Temple Chambers",
        "content": "Do bitcoin developers owe fiduciary duties to the true owners of a defrauded cryptoasset owner?\n\nOuter Temple\u2019s Anson Cheung comments on the case of Tulip Trading which was first heard in the High Court. This case generated much interest in being the first case to argue that bitcoin developers owed fiduciary duties to the true owners of a defrauded cryptoasset owner.\n\nThat argument was quickly shot down in the High Court for having no prospects of success, but has now been resuscitated by the Court of Appeal.\n\nBackground\n\nFollowing an alleged hacking and subsequent theft of keys controlling approximately \u00a33b in cryptoassets, Tulip Trading Limited (Tulip) issued proceedings against certain crypto developers who it claimed controlled and ran 4 different bitcoin networks.\n\nTulip claimed that the developers owed it a fiduciary duty and/or tortious duty of care, such that the developers were obliged to assist Tulip in regaining control and use of the cryptoassets. In a novel argument, Tulip argued the fiduciary duties owed should extend to implementing the necessary software patch which would have the effect of transferring the digital assets to which access has been lost to a new address.\n\nAll the developers were out of jurisdiction, and jurisdiction was so challenged. Therefore the proceedings before the first instance judge and the Court of Appeal proceeded in the context of the first limb of the jurisdiction test, being whether that there is a serious issue to be tried.\n\nThe first instance judge held that the second and third limb of the jurisdiction test had been established, but that Tulip could not establish the first limb \u2013 i.e. there was no realistic prospect of establishing that the facts pleaded amount to a breach of fiduciary or tortious duty owed by the defendants to Tulip.\n\nCase Comment\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal was outstandingly clear. There are three interesting observations that are worth bearing in mind:\n\nFirst, Birss LJ recognised that any recognition that the developers owed a fiduciary duty to bitcoin owners would be a significant development in the law (at [86]). However, he noted that there was often frequent warning in the authorities against deciding controversial points of law in a developing area on assumed or hypothetical facts rather than on the basis of actual factual findings. Therefore, whether or not there was a fiduciary duty in law in the circumstances alleged by Tulip ought to be decided \u201conce the facts are established\u201d (at [91]). This is particularly relevant given that there was dispute between Tulip and the developers as to whether it was the miners who controlled the software in a decentralised manner by creating a \u2018fork\u2019 in the software, or whether it was the developers who would create such a \u2018fork\u2019 by producing rival protocols.\n\nSecond, Birss LJ noted that applying common law principles on fiduciary duties \u2013 particularly, the classic definition of a fiduciary as set out in Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew [1998] Ch 1 \u2013 were capable of applying to developers:\n\n\u201cThe developers of a given network are a sufficiently well-defined group to be capable of being subject to fiduciary duties. Viewed objectively the developers have undertaken a role which involves making discretionary decisions and exercising power for and on behalf of other people, in relation to property owned by those other people. That property has been entrusted into the care of the developers. The developers therefore are fiduciaries[\u2026] The content of the duties includes a duty not to act in their own self interest and also involves a duty to act in positive ways in certain circumstances. It may also, realistically, include a duty to act to introduce code so that an owner\u2019s bitcoin can be transferred to safety in the circumstances alleged by Tulip.\u201d\n\nSuch an approach highlights the incremental approach of courts of England and Wales to blockchain technology and cryptoassets more generally: the courts apply the usual common law principles \u201cby analogy with existing cases\u201d, for example by considering whether bitcoin (itself a new and novel concept) fits the classic definitions of \u2018property\u2019. (at [71])\n\nThird, Birss LJ\u2019s analysis of how fiduciary duties would function in the context of bitcoin network developers was enlightening. He noted that the developers control the software which creates bitcoins, much like banks but \u2018the bank\u2019s developers have nothing like the control over the customer\u2019s assets which Tulip alleges the bitcoin developers have over bitcoin\u201d (at [72]). Such control involved taking active steps to update, or to decline an update to the code, and such decisions ultimately involved an exercise of authority which were entrusted to them by bitcoin owners, much as beneficiaries would entrust decisions to trustees. In making such decisions, the developers would owe duties to bitcoin owners \u201cnot to compromise the owners\u2019 security in that way. It would be a duty which involves abnegation of the developer\u2019s self-interest. It arises from their role as developers and shows that the role involves acting on behalf of bitcoin owners to maintain the bitcoin software.\u201d (at [76])\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, the argument proceeds to a full trial. If it succeeds and the courts of England and Wales do impose such a fiduciary duty on the developers, it will undermine the notion of decentralised governance of bitcoin, and one of the fundamental tenets behind blockchain technology and cryptoassets. Indeed, as the Court of Appeal concluded in its final paragraph, \u201cif the decentralised governance of bitcoin really is a myth, then in my judgment there is much to be said for the submission that bitcoin developers, while acting as developers, owe fiduciary duties to the true owners of that property\u201d.\n\nTo view the judgment from the High Court, click here.\n\nThe Court of Appeal judgment can be found here.\n\nFind out more\n\nAnson Cheung practices in international arbitration, construction and commercial litigation, financial services, professional negligence and pensions.\n\nPrior to starting the BPTC, Anson worked in the Legal Office of the UN World Food Programme in Rome.

        "content": "Andrey Danilovich / iStock.com\n\nInvesting in bitcoin has never been more popular, and while there are hundreds of places that let you buy bitcoin, not all of them are created equal.\n\nSome charge high fees, while others, sadly, are at risk of bankruptcy, or worse.\n\nFinding a time-tested, secure place to buy bitcoin is more important than ever, especially with the recent news of several crypto exchanges and investing platforms freezing customer assets.\n\nBest Places To Buy Bitcoin in 2023\n\nGOBankingRates has reviewed dozens of the top crypto exchanges and investing platforms to find the best places to buy bitcoin in 2023. Here are the top picks:\n\nCoinbase \u2014 Best place for security\n\n\u2014 Best place for security Binance.US \u2014 Best place for low fees\n\n\u2014 Best place for low fees Robinhood \u2014 Best for beginners\n\n\u2014 Best for beginners eToro \u2014 Best for bitcoin social trading\n\n\u2014 Best for bitcoin social trading Cash App \u2014 Best payment app for buying bitcoin\n\n1. Coinbase\n\nCoinbase is the most popular crypto exchange in the U.S., and it boasts over 100 million users globally. Coinbase has been around since 2012 and is one of the longest-standing crypto exchanges available.\n\nCoinbase allows you to quickly buy bitcoin with its super simple mobile app design, quickly connecting your bank account and letting you begin trading right away. The fees can be high (up to 0.60% plus a spread fee), but the platform is one of the safest places to buy bitcoin.\n\nPlus, you can transfer your bitcoin off the Coinbase platform into a hardware wallet of your choosing, further securing your digital assets.\n\n2. Binance.US\n\nBinance is the largest crypto exchange in the world, and Binance.US is the U.S.-regulated arm of this massive exchange. With access to rock-bottom trading fees and even the ability to buy bitcoin without any fees, Binance.US is one of the cheapest ways to buy bitcoin.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\nBinance.US also carries over 150 other cryptocurrencies for trading, including ethereum, solana and dogecoin. With robust security and a built-in educational platform, Binance.US is ideal for new crypto traders who want access to the best low-fee crypto exchange around.\n\nAs with Coinbase, Binance.US also allows you to withdraw your crypto to your own hardware wallet for safekeeping.\n\n3. Robinhood\n\nRobinhood is a stock trading platform that offers commission-free trading and a slick mobile app. But it also offers access to bitcoin and a few other cryptocurrencies, and it does not charge any commissions on crypto trades.\n\nRobinhood became popular with traders as it doesn\u2019t charge fees for most trades, and beginners are able to quickly get set up and start trading without the complicated charting and trading tools of other brokerages. Once it added crypto, Robinhood became a one-stop shop for beginners investors.\n\nRobinhood is regulated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and offers FDIC insurance on cash balances. However, Robinhood Crypto does not insure cryptocurrencies and is not regulated by FINRA.\n\nRobinhood has had its share of controversy surrounding halting stock trading and the way it gets paid (order routing), but it is still a solid way to buy crypto for beginners. And it recently became one of the first U.S. brokers to offer a digital crypto wallet, allowing you to actually take custody of your bitcoin.\n\n4. eToro\n\nEToro is another popular trading app that offers access to stocks, options, ETFs and cryptocurrencies. Users can also sign up for its CopyTrader feature, allowing them to automatically copy the trades of popular investors on the website.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\nEToro lets you invest in bitcoin and a handful of other cryptocurrencies with a flat 1% trading fee for buying and selling. Its mobile app is easy to use, but for more experienced traders, eToro offers a desktop platform with charting tools and advanced order types.\n\nEToro also allows you to transfer bitcoin off its platform, but it is a bit of a cumbersome process, requiring an interim eToro digital wallet.\n\n5. Cash App\n\nCash App is a popular payment app that now allows you to buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly within the app. Purchases can be made with your Cash App balance or linked bank account, and you can even send bitcoin to other Cash App users for free.\n\nCash App fees vary when buying bitcoin and include a spread fee as well. It may not be the most economical way to buy large amounts of bitcoin, but it is a very convenient way for Cash App users to invest in crypto.\n\nAnd unlike Venmo, Cash App lets you transfer your bitcoin off the platform to your own digital wallet, with no network fees unless you pay for an expedited transfer.\n\nWhere Can You Safely Buy Bitcoin in 2023?\n\nThere are several ways to buy bitcoin, but not all of them are safe. Here are the three safest ways to buy bitcoin online:\n\nCrypto exchange: While some crypto exchanges, such as FTX, have been shut down in recent years, there are several U.S.-regulated exchanges that offer a safe and secure way to buy bitcoin. These exchanges typically offer easy-to-use mobile apps, great liquidity (usually low spread fees), and an easy way to exchange U.S. dollars for crypto.\n\nWhile some crypto exchanges, such as FTX, have been shut down in recent years, there are several U.S.-regulated exchanges that offer a safe and secure way to buy bitcoin.

Most brokerage firms are FDIC insured and can be found through the FDIC\u2019s BankFind Suite, making them a safe place to use your cash to invest in crypto.\n\nSome traditional brokerage accounts now offer access to bitcoin investing.

But with so many crypto platforms going bankrupt and pausing customer withdrawals, it is more important than ever to find a quality place to buy and sell bitcoin.\n\nAnd of course, if you want to further secure your cryptocurrency, it is recommended that you transfer your crypto assets off any platform and onto a secure hardware wallet. This gives you complete custody of your coins and takes away the risk of any platform disappearing with your crypto."

Bitcoin is currently trading at $27,290 (\u00a321,888) dollars.\n\nTrillions of dollars were wiped from the market in 2022 after rate hikes triggered a rush back to safer ground and a string of crypto firms imploded.\n\nPredictions of sky-high valuations have been commonplace during bitcoin\u2019s past rallies. A Citi analyst said in November 2020 that bitcoin could climb as high as $318,000 (\u00a3255,055). It closed last year down about 65 per cent at $16,500 (\u00a313,234).\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters"

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Worries Traders As BTC Posts 10% Weekly Losses - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Bitcoin price struggles to hold above $27,000 as the second daily trading session in the red leaves investors concerned about deeper corrections. BTC is trading at $27,391, 9.92% below last week\u2019s opening at $29,250 and 1.04% down in the last 24 hours.\n\nDown around 12% from the highs of $31,50 set on April 14, the big crypto remains on traders\u2019 radar as a potential short opportunity into the weekly trading session looms.\n\nBitcoin Needs To Hold Above The 50 SMA To Avoid Further Losses\n\nData from TradingView and Coinbase shows that BTC has been struggling to hold above the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) over the last five days, where the downturn was stopped on April 21. Bitcoin bulls were required to aggressively defend this level as a daily close below this it would lead to a massive downturn.\n\nTherefore, a daily candlestick close below the 50-day SMA, currently sitting at $27,120 would trigger massive sell orders that would see the pioneer cryptocurrency drop first toward the $26,000 psychological level and later to the 100-day SMA at $25,030.\n\nMarket participants could expect the downside for the pioneer cryptocurrency to be capped here, in the short term. This would give buyers an opportunity to regroup and late investors to buy BTC at a discount, before another recovery is initiated.\n\nBTC/USD Daily Chart\n\nSupporting this move in Bitcoin is the downward facing Relative Strength Index (RSI). The position of this trend-following indicator at 43, below the midline, is an indication that there are more buyers than sellers in the market.\n\nIn addition, the daily chart above showed that BTC faced a stiff resistance area on the upside. This is a major supply zone stretching from $28,500 to $32,000, represented by the orange lines. Note that the price was rejected from the same zone in June last year, and went on to tank 44% to set a swinglow below $18,000.\n\nIf a similar move were recorded, the flagship crypto would even extend the correction below $25,000 to revisit the 200-day SMA at $21,972 or the local low at $19,568. This would represent a 28% drop from the current price.\n\nOn the upside, Bitcoin still looked strong as it traded above all the major SMAs on the daily timeframe. The 50-, 100-, and 200-day SMAs were all facing upward, an indication that the market still favoured the upside.\n\nDemand pressure from these SMAs could propel Bitcoin upward to tag the lower limit of the supply zone at $28,500. A further ascent above the local high at $31,050 would see the bellwether cryptocurrency rise to confront resistance from the upper limit of the supplier congestion area at $32,000. This is where BTC\u2019s upside could be capped in the long term.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "The Impact of Cryptocurrency on the Stock Market - ClearTax",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency has had a significant impact on the stock market since its inception. Bitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, was created in 2009, and since then, it has grown in popularity and value. As the value of cryptocurrencies continues to rise, it is important to understand their impact on the stock market and how they affect traditional investments.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are the two largest cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization, and their impact on the stock market has been a topic of interest for investors and analysts alike. Here's a historical analysis of their impact on the stock market in the past few years:\n\nBitcoin: Bitcoin's impact on the stock market has been limited, with little correlation between the two markets. However, there have been instances of Bitcoin's price movements affecting investor sentiment in the stock market. For example, in December 2017, Bitcoin's price surged to nearly $20,000, and some analysts speculated that the surge was partly due to investors selling off stocks to invest in Bitcoin. Additionally, in March 2020, Bitcoin's price plummeted amid the COVID-19 pandemic, causing a sell-off in global stock markets. Ethereum: Ethereum's impact on the stock market has been even less pronounced than Bitcoin's. However, some analysts have noted that Ethereum's underlying technology, blockchain, has the potential to disrupt traditional financial systems, which could have a long-term impact on the stock market. In addition, the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications built on the Ethereum network could lead to increased investment in related stocks.\n\nOverall, while cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have made headlines for their price volatility and potential to disrupt traditional financial systems, their impact on the stock market has been limited thus far. However, as the crypto market continues to evolve and mature, it remains to be seen how it will impact the stock market in the future.\n\nHere are some notable footprints that cryptocurrency has created on the stock market:\n\nIncreased Market Volatility\n\nOne of the most significant impacts of cryptocurrency on the stock market is increased volatility. Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, and their value can fluctuate rapidly. This volatility can spill over into the stock market and cause fluctuations in stock prices. The high volatility of cryptocurrencies is often attributed to a variety of factors, including their lack of regulation, the absence of fundamental metrics to evaluate their value, and their susceptibility to market manipulation. As a result, cryptocurrencies are prone to sudden price swings, which can lead to significant gains or losses for investors.\n\nOverall, while the volatility of cryptocurrencies has the potential to generate significant returns for investors, it also poses significant risks to the stability of financial markets. As the crypto market continues to evolve and mature, it will be important for regulators and investors to carefully monitor and manage these risks to ensure the long-term stability of the broader financial system.\n\nIncreased Investment Opportunities\n\nThe emergence of cryptocurrencies has created new investment opportunities for investors looking to diversify their portfolios and potentially earn higher returns. In addition to investing directly in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, investors can also invest in companies that are involved in the crypto market, such as cryptocurrency exchanges, mining companies, and blockchain technology providers.\n\nMoreover, the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications built on blockchain technology has also opened up new investment opportunities. DeFi applications are designed to provide traditional financial services, such as lending, borrowing, and trading, without the need for intermediaries like banks. These applications often rely on cryptocurrencies as their native currency, creating new opportunities for investors to participate in the emerging DeFi ecosystem.\n\nIn addition, the rise of cryptocurrency trading and investment has led to the development of new financial products, such as futures contracts and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which allow investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly owning them. These financial products can provide investors with a more accessible and regulated way to invest in cryptocurrencies.\n\nRise of Blockchain Technology\n\nBlockchain is a distributed ledger technology that allows for secure and transparent record-keeping. It provides a decentralised system that enables secure and transparent transactions without the need for intermediaries.\n\nThe potential applications of blockchain technology are vast and extend beyond the cryptocurrency space. In the financial sector, blockchain technology has the potential to streamline and automate many processes, including trade settlement, clearing, and payments. It could also enable faster and more secure cross-border transactions and reduce the need for intermediaries like banks and clearinghouses.\n\nThe increasing adoption of blockchain technology has also led to the development of new business models and opportunities. Companies that are early adopters of blockchain technology could see significant gains in the coming years. As the technology continues to mature, it will be important for companies to stay abreast of new developments and potential applications.\n\nRisks of Hype and Speculation\n\nThe hype and speculation surrounding cryptocurrency can lead to increased market volatility, as investors make speculative bets on the future price of cryptocurrencies. This can result in significant price swings, which can lead to losses for investors who enter the market at the wrong time or invest in risky assets.\n\nMoreover, the lack of regulation in the cryptocurrency market can create additional risks for investors. Many cryptocurrencies are not subject to the same regulatory oversight as traditional investments, which can make it difficult for investors to assess the risks associated with these assets.\n\nAnother risk associated with cryptocurrency is the potential for fraud and scams. The lack of regulation in the market has created an environment where unscrupulous actors can prey on unsuspecting investors. This can make it challenging for investors to make informed investment decisions and avoid risky assets.\n\nRegulatory Uncertainty\n\nRegulatory uncertainty is a significant challenge for the cryptocurrency market. Cryptocurrencies are not currently subject to the same regulatory oversight as traditional financial instruments, such as stocks and bonds. This lack of regulation can create uncertainty and risks for investors who may not fully understand the potential risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe lack of clarity around regulation can create challenges for companies operating in the cryptocurrency space. Companies may find it difficult to comply with existing regulations or may face new regulations that could impact their business models.\n\nFurthermore, regulatory uncertainty can also impact the broader adoption of cryptocurrencies. Some institutional investors may be hesitant to invest in cryptocurrencies due to regulatory uncertainty, which could slow down the development of the market.\n\nConclusion\n\nCryptocurrency has created a significant impact on the stock market, both in terms of increased investment opportunities and increased volatility. While there are risks associated with investing in cryptocurrency, there are also opportunities for investors who are willing to do their research and understand the risks involved. As blockchain technology becomes more mainstream, it is likely that we will see more companies adopt it and potentially benefit from the increased efficiency and security it offers. Ultimately, it is important for investors to weigh the potential benefits and risks of investing in cryptocurrency and make informed decisions based on their own risk tolerance and investment goals."

        "content": "INVESTORS have been warned about a fake Martin Lewis bitcoin scam which cost one elderly couple their life savings.\n\nRetired Barbara and Ewan Atkins (not their real names) lost \u00a380,000 to the fraudster who pretended to be endorsed by the money saving expert.\n\n2 The MoneySavingExpert website says it nor Martin Lewis ever endorse a product or investment Credit: Rex\n\nThe conman convinced the pair, both 78, to use popular e-money platform Revolut to avoid fraud checks.\n\nHe explained how to set up accounts with Wise, Binance and Revolut, which the couple had not heard of, before giving them details on how to avoid triggering fraud prevention processes.\n\nBut when the attempted to withdraw their money and were told they needed to make more payments, they realised they had been scammed.\n\nThey told their daughter and son-in-law, who contacted the banks in order to report the fraud.\n\nThe family say though Revolut\u2019s response was not sufficient, particularly when they were contacted about their complaint and it included links to a foodbank website and Age UK.\n\nConcerns about Revolut\u2019s ability to deal with fraud cases and money laundering have been raised by senior industry insiders who say the e-money institution, which is not a bank in the UK, is the \u201cvehicle of choice\u201d for fraudsters.\n\nHaving moved back to the UK from France, they spotted an advert for Bitcoin online in late February.\n\nIt appeared to be backed by the consumer champion Martin Lewis and thought it would be a good way to stretch out their savings.\n\nHaving clicked on the link, they were then called by a man calling himself Michael Hampton whose apparent online profile made him out to be some \u201cdynamic international investor\u201d.\n\nHe convinced them that their bank, Barclays, would question their large transactions and that they should tell them they were planning a big purchase.\n\nBarclays did flag the payments as being unusual and contacted the couple to make sure they were happy to move the money.\n\nThe conman then told the pair how to create an account with Wise, a foreign exchange service started in 2011, so they could invest in Bitcoin.\n\nThey transferred \u00a310,000 to the account, which was flagged by Wise and the account was closed.\n\nSET UP REVOLUT ACCOUNT\n\nThe scammer then talked the couple into setting up a Revolut account, saying that only the first payment would be flagged on the system.\n\nThey made 14 transactions of between \u00a33,000 and \u00a35,000 over the next few days, encouraged by the \u201cinvestment manager\u201d who phoned them repeatedly each day.\n\nWhile the first transaction did prompt a warning message from Revolut none of the other transactions were challenged.\n\nThe elderly couple got daily updates on their nearly \u00a365,000 \u201cinvestment\u201d which they were told had almost doubled in just four weeks.\n\nHowever, when they attempted to withdraw the money, the fraudsters told them they had to pay \u00a310,000 for capital gains tax.\n\nIt was then they realised they had been conned and told their daughter and son-in-law.\n\nWhen they got in touch with Barclays fraud team that they realised just how much money had been lost.\n\nThe bank said that because it has warned them about the payments and called them before the money left their account it would not refund the money they had lost.\n\nRevolut initially told the couple there had been \u201cno trace\u201d of fraudulent activity and then said they would not reimburse them.\n\nIt sent a number of links, in the hope that \u201cthis information helps you understand the situation and stay safe in the future\u201d.\n\n'DISGUSTED'\n\nTheir son-in-law and daughter told the MailOnline they were \u201cdisgusted\u201d at how dismissive Revolut had been.\n\nThey said they were amazed the fraud processes at the online platform hadn\u2019t picked up the unusual payments quicker and the initial response from Revolut said they weren\u2019t fraudulent.\n\nTheir daughter said: \u201cIt\u2019s a permanent weight on our minds. We were shell-shocked as well that my parents had been scammed like that.\u201d\n\nShe added that sending a link to a foodbank showed Revolut\u2019s lack of interest, insensitivity and lackadaisical approach.\n\nShe said: \u201cEverybody knows about foodbanks, so we didn\u2019t need to see that as a link from Revolut.\u201d\n\nThe pensioners have now taken their case to the financial ombudsman.\n\nA senior industry insider, a director of compliance at a large firm, said Revolut was the \u201cvehicle of choice\u201d for money launderers and fraudsters.\n\nFigures quoted by the news outlet suggest Revolut has been struggling with protecting customers against fraud, with the number of crime reports made to Action Fraud rising from 3,975 in 2021 to 7,198 last year, an increase of 81 per cent.\n\nThose figures also account for cases where the fraudsters funnel money through Revolut accounts, or when an identity has been stolen and fake account created.\n\nIn early March, Revolut, which offers current account services but is not a bank in the UK, said it would be getting its banking licence \u201cimminently\u201d.\n\nRevolut is not signed up to the Contingent Reimbursement Model (CFM) in the UK, which is a voluntary agreement between banks that they will repay victims of some kinds of fraud.\n\nA Wise spokesman said: \u201cWe are truly sorry to learn of the scam Mr and Mrs Atkins have fallen victim to.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently investigating the case and will be in touch with them directly regarding updates on the remaining funds.\u201d\n\nGareth Shaw, deputy editor at Martin Lewis's website MoneySavingExpert.com, said: \u201cSadly, this is similar to scams we\u2019ve been seeing for years.\n\nHere at MSE, we find it so frustrating and disheartening that many scammers get away with it Gareth Shaw deputy editor at MoneySavingExpert\n\n\u201cPlease know \u2013 and spread the word if you can \u2013 that neither MoneySavingExpert nor Martin Lewis ever endorse products or investments.\n\n\u201cHere at MSE, we find it so frustrating and disheartening that many scammers get away with it.\n\n\u201cIt's why MSE and Martin Lewis have always tried to close down their routes to the general public and create awareness through campaigning.\u201d\n\nA Barclays spokesperson said: \u201cWe have every sympathy with our customer who was a victim of a sophisticated investment scam.\n\n\u201cWe urge everyone to stay vigilant to fraudulent investment opportunities.\n\n\u201cPlease take steps to satisfy yourself that the person or business you are investing through is legitimate and who you think it is, and check the FCA website and warning list to ensure they are a regulated financial firm before transferring any funds.\n\n\u201cRemember, if the investment seems too good to be true, it probably is.'\n\nA Revolut spokesman said: \u201cWe are very sorry that Mr and Mrs Atkins were targeted by ruthless and highly sophisticated criminals.\n\n\u201cWe take our responsibility to protect and support our customers extremely seriously and have made significant investments in our systems, processes and people to ensure that our customers are safe.\n\n\u201cWhen making an investment, we urge everyone to take steps to satisfy themselves that the person they are sending money to is legitimate.\n\n\u201cWe encourage customers to check the investment company is genuine and a regulated firm. If in doubt, seek trusted independent financial advice first.\u201d\n\nIt said it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about fraud involving fake social media ads and fake phone calls."

        "title": "Most Common 3 Methods Of Converting Bitcoin To Naira in 2023 - THISDAY Newspapers",
        "content": "Looking for ways to convert Bitcoin to Naira in 2023? Well, you\u2019ve come to the right place.\n\nAs you and I may know, to get the value of your Bitcoin, most times, crypto traders will have to convert their Bitcoin to fiat currency for them to be able to use it.\n\nIn Nigeria, cryptocurrency is undoubtedly the talk of the town, and many also want to be involved. But trading cryptocurrency in Nigeria is quite difficult due to the crypto ban in Nigeria by the Central Bank. And this regulation also affects crypto trading when converting Bitcoin to Naira.\n\nSo now that there\u2019s a crypto ban in Nigeria, how can one convert Bitcoin in Nigeria? In this article, I will be sharing 3 common ways to convert Bitcoin to Naira in 2023 without violating the crypto rules in Nigeria.\n\n3 Most Popular Ways To Convert Bitcoin To Naira In 2023\n\nHere are 3 common ways to change your Bitcoin to Naira despite the crypto ban in Nigeria:\n\n1. P2P Trading\n\nP2P trading allows you to exchange Bitcoin for Naira by selling your Bitcoins to a buyer directly. Typically, a crypto trading platform like Binance or Localbitcoins is used for this, as it links buyers and sellers.\n\nIn the cryptocurrency industry, peer-to-peer trading is frequently referred to as P2P trading. Users can immediately trade their cryptocurrencies for cash by engaging in this type of trading. P2P trading occurs when user \u201cA\u201d has some cryptocurrency and sets a price to sell it, and when user \u201cB\u201d sees the listing in the market chart, they both decide to purchase from \u201cA.\u201d\n\nYou have some influence over who buys your cryptocurrency and who you buy it from, as well as the price and settlement time when you trade it from peer to peer. Peer-to-peer trading gives customers some degree of control over the process, but it should be noted that there are certain hazards involved.\n\nP2P trading, however, might potentially have certain disadvantages. For instance, because you are working with a private individual rather than a licensed broker, there is a possibility of fraud or fraud. Additionally, the exchange rate may be lower than the market rate as you are negotiating with the buyer.\n\n2. OTC Trading (Breet)\n\nOTC trading is a way to exchange crypto like Bitcoin for Naira via a seasoned broker like Breet. In this method, you work with the broker to sell your Bitcoins and receive payment in Naira.\n\nOTC means Over-The-Counter. So, as I explained about peer-to-peer exchange, you work with a third party via an escrow system. But with OTC exchange, you can convert Bitcoin to Naira without any other party. It is direct and automatic.\n\nOne of the main advantages of OTC trading is that you can get a higher exchange rate than you might through other methods. Although one of the downsides of OTC exchange is that the exchange rate is fixed, so you cannot negotiate for a better deal.\n\nBreet is one of the best OTC exchanges out there. Breet is an OTC crypto exchange platform that allows users and businesses who simply want to receive crypto and get a flat equivalent of their coin to convert their crypto to cash money immediately.\n\nBreet enables users to securely convert and withdraw their crypto coin to cash money in less than five(5) minutes without the use of peer-to-peer trading or any third-party agent.\n\n3. Use Bitcoin ATM\n\nUsing a Bitcoin ATM is a method of converting Bitcoin to Naira by using a machine that dispenses cash in exchange for Bitcoin. This is a relatively new method, and there is currently only one Bitcoin ATM in Nigeria, located in Dazey Lounge and Bar, Lagos State.\n\nBitcoin ATMs provide various benefits, with the principal one being its rapid and simple transaction process. By inputting your digital currency, you can instantly acquire cash without any cumbersome dealings or intermediary interference. Furthermore, there is no requirement for bargaining or mediation with another party in this seamless procedure.\n\nHowever, there are also some potential drawbacks to using a Bitcoin ATM. For example, the fees can be high, and you may end up paying more than you would with other methods. Additionally, you need to physically go to the ATM, which may not be convenient for everyone. Finally, the ATM is only located in Lagos, so if you live outside of Lagos, this method may not be suitable for you.\n\nWhy OTC Trading Is Better Than Other Options\n\nWhile each method of converting Bitcoin to Naira has its own advantages and disadvantages, there are several reasons why OTC trading is often considered to be the best option, particularly for larger trades.\n\nFirst and foremost, OTC trading allows for a higher exchange rate than other methods. This is because the broker is buying a large amount of Bitcoin at once, which can be more valuable than small individual transactions. This means that you can potentially receive more Naira for your Bitcoin than you would through other methods, such as P2P trading or using a Bitcoin ATM.\n\nIn addition to the higher exchange rate, OTC trading also offers a greater level of convenience and security. When you use a professional broker like Breet for OTC trading, you don\u2019t need to worry about negotiating with individual buyers or dealing with potential fraud or scams. The broker handles all of the transactions and ensures that everything is done securely and safely.\n\nAn additional benefit of OTC trading pertains to its swiftness in comparison with other approaches. Though P2P transactions can occasionally be expeditious, they may require an investment of time and effort in searching for a potential buyer as well as engaging in negotiations. In contrast, the broker engaged in OTC trading is primed to purchase your Bitcoin immediately upon request; thereby enabling prompt completion of the transaction which leads to earlier disbursement of payment.\n\nFinally, OTC trading is often the best option for larger trades. When you are dealing with a large amount of Bitcoin, you want to make sure that the transaction is handled professionally and efficiently. OTC trading offers a level of expertise and experience that may not be available through other methods, making it the best choice for larger trades.\n\nOf course, there are also some potential drawbacks to OTC trading. For example, the process can be slow and may take several days to complete. Additionally, the exchange rate is fixed, so you cannot negotiate for a better deal. Finally, there is often a minimum amount of Bitcoin required for OTC trading, so this method may not be suitable for smaller traders.\n\nOverall, however, OTC trading is often considered to be the best option for converting Bitcoin to Naira, particularly for larger trades. With its higher exchange rate, greater convenience and security, and faster transaction times, OTC trading offers a level of professionalism and expertise that is hard to match with other methods.\n\nSo whenever you want to convert Bitcoin to Naira, don\u2019t forget to use the Breet app. Breet is available on all Android and iPhone devices. You can access it via the web, available on the Breet web version."

        "title": "Bitcoin's next all-time high identified as BTC follows pre-halving pattern like 'clockwork' - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "With about one year left until Bitcoin (BTC) goes through its next halving, after which the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks will reduce in half as part of capping the supply to 21 million BTC, the flagship cryptocurrency is repeating its pre-halving pattern, indicating the time range for its next all-time high (ATH).\n\nAs it happens, Bitcoin is currently moving in the same chart pattern in which the ATH is followed by accumulation and then entrance into a pre-halving zone, succeeded by a rapid incline toward the next ATH, \u201clike a clockwork,\u201d according to the observations published by the pseudonymous crypto market analyst Stockmoney Lizards on April 24.\n\nNew ATH in 2025?\n\nSpecifically, with its price at press time standing at $27,478, the maiden decentralized finance (DeFi) asset seems to be entering the pre-halving zone, where the expert believes it could reach up to around $53,000. If the pattern sticks, this means that Bitcoin could rapidly climb toward $225,000 or its next ATH in late 2025 or early 2026.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s historical pre-halving behavior. Source: Stockmoney Lizards\n\nEarlier, Finbold reported on another pseudonymous crypto analyst, therationalroot, comparing the past Bitcoin halving cycles with a focus on its ATHs, suggesting that Bitcoin had the habit of spiking roughly 10-12 months after each of the halving events.\n\nThis means that the next ATH could occur in April 2025, slightly earlier than Stockmoney Lizards\u2019 predictions. More recently, therationalroot has noted the progress of the halving cycle progress, indicating that the maiden digital asset was 74% into the current halving cycle as of April 18.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAs things stand, Bitcoin is currently trading at the price of $27,478, down 0.55% in the last 24 hours, as well as dropping 9.33% in the past week and 0.42% across the previous 30 days, according to the latest data retrieved by Finbold on April 24.\n\nBitcoin 7-day price chart.

        "content": "Since the turn of the year Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) rally has taken some investors by surprise, particularly following the prolonged bear market of 2022. While some are optimistic that this signals the start of the next bull run for Bitcoin, others are skeptical and question the sustainability of the momentum.\n\nOne person who remains bearish on Bitcoin is Peter Schiff, chief global strategist of Euro Pacific Capital. Despite the gains, Schiff considers the rally to be temporary and views it as an opportunity to exit the market.\n\nOn January 12, Peter Schiff took to Twitter to express his opinion on Bitcoin\u2019s price. With the cryptocurrency trading above $18,000, Schiff saw it as an ideal moment for investors to sell the digital asset.\n\nThe chief global strategist had predicted a potential market crash ahead of the release of the United States Consumer Price Index (CPI) also citing gold\u2019s 8-month high, which he thought could impact Bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\nDespite Schiff\u2019s recommendation to sell Bitcoin, the opposite outcome has come to pass. Contrary to his prediction, the cryptocurrency\u2019s value has continued to climb, reaching $27,450 at press time, and representing a significant 54% increase since Schiff urged investors to sell.\n\nBitcoin since Schiff\u2019s prediciton. Source: @BTC_Archive\n\nSchiff follows Jim Cramer curse\n\nThe market\u2019s reaction to Schiff\u2019s advice shows the unpredictability of cryptocurrency and its resistance to conventional market analysis.\n\nIn a similar case, host of TV show \u201cMad Money,\u201d Jim Cramer, urged investors to sell Bitcoin at $24,000 back in March. Since his call, the leading cryptocurrency rallied over 20% to where it stands today.\n\nWhere will Bitcoin trend next?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price has recently stabilized above the $27,000 threshold, facing strong resistance at $28,377.\n\nBitcoin 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAccording to a recent analysis from Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, Bitcoin has the potential to increase its value if it successfully surpasses the $27,800-$28,000 range. If this occurs, Bitcoin could potentially accelerate towards $29,200. However, the cryptocurrency\u2019s upward momentum depends on whether it can sustain the breakout above the resistance level.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
