The currency broke into mainstream consciousness in 2017, as its price ran up thousands of dollars over the course of the year. More recently, it skyrocketed in 2020 and 2021, as traders saw it as a way to get rich quickly, before plummeting massively in 2022.\n\nBitcoin has created much controversy, from proponents who say it\u2019s the future of currency to those who decry it as a speculative bubble. Here\u2019s what you need to know about Bitcoin, how it works and some of its drawbacks.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin and how does it work?\n\nBitcoin debuted in 2009, when the software underpinning the currency was released. Its origins are a bit mysterious, however, and a person (or perhaps group) known as Satoshi Nakamoto claims the credit for unveiling the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin operates on a decentralized computer network or distributed ledger using blockchain technology, which manages and tracks the currency. Think of the distributed ledger like a huge public record of transactions taking place in the currency. The networked computers verify the transactions, ensuring the integrity of the data and the ownership of bitcoins, and they\u2019re rewarded with bitcoins for doing so.\n\nThis decentralized network is a huge part of the appeal of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Users can transfer money to each other, and the lack of a central bank to manage the currency makes the currency almost autonomous. This autonomy means that the currency, at least theoretically, can avoid the interference of governments and central banks.\n\nBitcoin can operate mostly anonymously. While transactions might be traceable to certain users, the person\u2019s name is not immediately tied to the transaction, even if the transaction is processed publicly. However, authorities have become better at tracking the movements of bitcoins, because the ledger of bitcoin transactions is publicly available.\n\nWhere do bitcoins come from?\n\nBitcoins are created, or \u201cmined,\u201d when computers on the network verify and process transactions in the currency. Some computers called miners are specially outfitted with high-powered processors that can chew through transactions and earn a part of a bitcoin. So Bitcoin requires a lot of processing power to maintain the network and a lot of electricity to run those computers.\n\nBitcoins aren\u2019t created infinitely, however, and the currency is limited to 21 million whole units. Experts expect the remaining number of bitcoins to be mined out around the year 2140. When this occurs, miners will be rewarded solely with a fee for processing transactions.\n\nWhile the number of bitcoins may be limited, each whole bitcoin can be split into much smaller units. In practice, bitcoins are divided into fractions of a coin to facilitate payments of very small amounts of real currency. A bitcoin can be officially divided into as many as one hundred million parts, which are called satoshi in honor of the mysterious founder.\n\nBitcoin is just one type of cryptocurrency, and literally thousands more have been created. Some of the most popular include Ethereum, Solana and XRP.\n\nUsers can hold and spend bitcoins from a cryptocurrency wallet. A wallet is like a personalized location on the distributed ledger that refers to only your currency holdings. When you acquire bitcoins, your wallet provides a unique cryptographic address to the sender. To spend or send bitcoins, you might scan a retailer\u2019s QR code or direct money to its public address.\n\nAdvantages of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin has some advantages as a currency and is popular for many reasons, ranging from the utopian to the capitalistic.\n\n1. Decentralized currency management\n\nThrough its decentralized network and limited number of coins, Bitcoin promises a kind of utopian version of currency. Proponents say that by getting central banks and governments out of the currency game, the currency will maintain its value better over time. By extricating these entities, some say that Bitcoin returns power to the people.\n\n2. Anonymous or semi-anonymous transactions\n\nThe relative anonymity of Bitcoin is also a huge feature for many. Some proponents (such as certain libertarians) like that the government or other authorities cannot easily track who uses the currency. However, such anonymity means that the currency can also be used for criminal activities.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that every transaction is tracked and can be used to reconstruct a given wallet\u2019s spending. It\u2019s all public, allowing any entity to track spending, creating further privacy concerns, even if it\u2019s finally not clear who owns a given wallet.\n\n3. Hard or impossible to counterfeit\n\nBitcoin\u2019s popularity is also due to an entirely practical matter, though. It\u2019s tough to counterfeit, because of the blockchain ledger system that verifies transactions over and over.\n\n4. Surging popularity\n\nBitcoin is also popular because the hype surrounding the cryptocurrency has made it a trendy trading vehicle. Because the value of the currency fluctuates so much, traders can jump in and make (or lose) money. This hype and the perceived limited nature of coins has driven the price of bitcoins much higher over the last decade, though it continues to fluctuate significantly.\n\nDisadvantages of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin suffers from some significant drawbacks that are intrinsic to its design, notably its limit on the number of coins in circulation and its general volatility.\n\n1. Bitcoin is an energy hog\n\nBig computer miners require a lot of energy to operate. Producing the electricity is expensive and pollutes the environment, for what some detractors say is a currency project with little feasibility.\n\nJust how much electricity does Bitcoin use and how much greenhouse gas does it emit? According to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, Bitcoin would rank as the 27th highest user of electricity, if it were a country as of April 2023. It would rank 70th in terms of its greenhouse gas emissions. Those are huge numbers for a rarely used digital currency.\n\n2. The number of coins is limited\n\nBy its very nature, the number of coins is limited, and that poses a serious problem on using Bitcoin as a currency. In effect, this limit does not allow the money supply to be increased, which is valuable when an economy experiences recession. If used throughout an economy, Bitcoin could create destructive deflationary spirals, which were more typical when economies ran on the gold standard. In fact, this concern is a key reason why the gold standard was eliminated.\n\nA challenging situation arises when consumers and others hoard currency during tough economic times. When money doesn\u2019t flow, it slows the economy. Without a central authority such as a bank to stoke the economy or offer credit, the economy could move into a deflationary spiral. So consumers don\u2019t spend because goods will be cheaper tomorrow, creating a destructive spiral.\n\nWith a fixed number of units, Bitcoin doesn\u2019t provide the flexibility needed to manage a system-wide currency.\n\n3. A volatile currency is useless\n\nImagine going to a restaurant where the prices moved up or down every day, sometimes by 10 percent or more. If this sounds like an unattractive prospect, then it\u2019s exactly what makes Bitcoin virtually useless as a currency. While volatility makes Bitcoin attractive for traders, it renders it all but worthless as a medium of exchange.\n\nConsumers need to know what a currency can buy when they make spending decisions. If they expect the currency to rise \u2013 or even skyrocket \u2013 there\u2019s little incentive for them to use it as currency.\n\n4. Government regulation is coming\n\nGovernments have been relatively slow to react to the advent of cryptocurrency, but many have now woken up and are beginning to study how to regulate it. Some countries, such as China, have banned it outright, while others are considering doing so. Still others, such as the United States, are examining how they might regulate cryptocurrency more effectively.\n\nWhat form the U.S. regulation takes remains unclear, though President Joe Biden has tasked the federal government with studying cryptocurrencies, the risks to financial stability and national security, the environmental impact and even the creation of a digital dollar.\n\nThe move to a clear regulatory framework is vital in light of the high-profile blow-up of TerraUSD, a stablecoin cryptocurrency that\u2019s meant to hold a fixed value. The creation of a digital dollar, with the stability of real dollars, may make private cryptocurrencies less attractive.\n\n5. Any transaction is reportable to the IRS\n\nThe laws surrounding cryptocurrency are onerous for consumers, making it tough to use.\n\nThe IRS now requires you to declare on your annual tax return if you\u2019ve had any transaction in a cryptocurrency in the current tax year. And if you sell crypto assets or make a transaction with one, you could create a tax liability. So you\u2019ll need to keep clear records of your buy and sell prices if you\u2019re using the digital currency, lest you run afoul of the law and run up a tax bill.\n\nHere\u2019s the full rundown on what you need to know about cryptocurrency taxes.\n\nBottom line\n\nWhile Bitcoin is an interesting experiment, it has serious drawbacks that make it difficult to achieve the stated mission of being a medium of exchange or even a store of value. In fact, one of the world\u2019s greatest investors, Warren Buffett, has called the currency \u201cprobably rat poison squared\u201d and has said that it\u2019s not the kind of thing he considers an investment. Add on the fact that governments could potentially shut down the currency, and it\u2019s a risky investment at best. Still, if you\u2019re looking to get started trading cryptocurrency, here are the key things you need to know."

        "content": "Today, Majority Whip Tom Emmer (MN-06) and Representative French Hill (AR-02) sent a letter to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler regarding Chair Gensler\u2019s regulatory hypocrisy and inconsistency in his treatment of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETP) applications.\n\nOver the last decade, over twenty spot bitcoin ETP applications have been filed with the SEC, but none have been approved. Chair Gensler has denied all bitcoin spot ETP applications in the United States, citing concerns over fraud and manipulation in the market. Chair Gensler, however, has authorized bitcoin futures ETPs to trade, even though the pricing for those futures contracts is derived entirely from the same market he claims is fraught with fraud and manipulation.\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s approach to cryptocurrency regulation has been unacceptable,\u201d said Emmer. \u201cChair Gensler has exhibited regulatory inconsistency between his treatment of bitcoin futures ETPs, which he has allowed to trade in the United States, and bitcoin spot ETPs, which he continually denies the American people from accessing. The SEC must provide consistency of treatment to the marketplace and retail investors in the United States are worse off because of the Chair\u2019s decision to deny all bitcoin spot ETP applications. We look forward to the SEC\u2019s response to our concerns.\u201d\n\nHill said, \u201cThe reasoning behind the SEC\u2019s continued refusal to approve a spot bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) appears to be inconsistent and doesn\u2019t take into account what we know from other jurisdictions where regulators have approved similar products. We look forward to Chair Gensler\u2019s appearance before the Financial Services Committee today and his response to our letter.\u201d\n\nBoth Emmer and Hill serve as members of the House Financial Services Committee.\n\nText of the letter is available here.\n\n###"

        "title": "Newton grandmother scammed out of $20,000, used Bitcoin ATMs to send money - CBS Boston",
        "content": "NEWTON - It's a phone call that a Newton grandmother would give anything to go back and not answer. It happened last week; the caller said he was a federal law enforcement official, and he feared she was the victim of identity theft.\n\n\"He said, 'Alright, are you ready to go to the bank?' I said yes,\" the woman who did not want to be identified said. \"He spelled his name for me and he actually had me put his phone number into Google. It took me directly to the US Marshals Service website.\"\n\nElsewhere on the actual US Marshals Service website, there is a warning for this exact scam.\n\nDistracted on the phone call, the Newton victim didn't go digging. And unlike other popular schemes, there was no urgency, and no threatening tone. The caller calmly offered options for moving her money temporarily until a new Social Security number could be issued.\n\nShe told WBZ she began to let her guard down, as the man pretended to help her. \"Then you're going to go and use that money to buy Bitcoin. It'll go into a wallet that is strictly yours. Your name is on it; it's your money,\" she recalled him advising her, so that her savings wouldn't be inaccessible in a frozen account.\n\nOver the next 24 hours, the woman visited four local Citizens Bank branches and withdrew $30,000 in cash. She said no one ever questioned her.\n\n\"The teller said, 'We don't carry that kind of money. The best we can do is give you $9000 and small bills. He called over and found out the branch in Needham could give me $10,000,\" the woman recalled.\n\nShe spent hours on the phone with the man, as she drove to banks in Newton Centre, Needham, Chestnut Hill, and Newtonville. She used Bitcoin ATMs in Waltham and Newton, and after sending the first $20,000 she drove to her attorney's office. \"I wasn't two sentences into the story when he said that's a scam,\" she recalled.\n\nCitizens Bank wrote in a statement: \"We are sorry to hear that one of our customers may have been the victim of a scam...we do work closely with law enforcement when incidents occur and provide training for our colleagues in order to help detect such incidents.\"\n\nBack in February WBZ reported on a thwarted scheme in Norwood; an alert teller at Rockland Trust called police, concerned for a senior customer trying to take out $9000. That victim kept their money, but personal finance experts say it's a slippery slope.\n\n\"Do we really want bank tellers screening us and asking, how much money? What are you going to use this money for? Is this a legitimate purpose? I think we're invading privacy at this point,\" said Professor Jay Zagorsky of Boston University's Questrom School of Business.\n\nNewton Police are investigating, but this victim's $20,000 is long gone.\n\n\"I'm just pulling myself together now. It was just a terrible ordeal. This can happen to you. It doesn't matter how smart you are. It doesn't matter how skeptical you are. You can be had. They're very good at what they do,\" the victim said."

        "title": "The Best Bitcoin Loan Platforms of 2023 - Blockworks",
        "content": "A bitcoin loan is money, property or goods lent to a borrower using BTC as collateral. It is the permabull\u2019s ultimate hack for using BTC without the FOMO and tax burden that comes with selling.\n\nAlthough the term \u201cbitcoin loan\u201d might be unclear to some, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the loan is made in bitcoin. It is only considered a bitcoin loan if the collateral backing the loan is denominated in BTC.\n\nAdditionally, these loans are overcollateralized, which means that the value of the collateralized bitcoin exceeds the loan\u2019s value. For instance, some lenders allow borrowers to borrow up to 50% of the deposited collateral\u2019s USD value. As with traditional loans, borrowers receive their collateral back once they pay off the loan and interest in full.\n\nSo, what is the point if borrowers get back less than what they put in? This article in our series on crypto and bitcoin loans will explain the appeal and the pros and cons of different bitcoin loan platforms.\n\nWhy get a bitcoin-backed loan?\n\nLike all loans, bitcoin-backed loans aim to make the inaccessible or illiquid value of something more accessible in an open market. Traditional lenders do this by making the value of your future work or endeavors available in cash or a line of credit.\n\nBitcoin is more liquid than future work but less accessible than a common medium of exchange. First, only a few merchants and sellers accept bitcoin as payment. But more importantly, because the IRS classifies bitcoin as property, you create a taxable event every time you sell it or exchange it.\n\nThirdly, if you view your BTC holdings as an investment, you want to wait to sell until you have made a return. And if you are a bitcoin permabull, you want to avoid selling BTC for as long as possible. So while bitcoin is considered more liquid than most assets such as property and stocks, it is still less liquid than the cash in your pocket.\n\nHow it saves money\n\nA bitcoin-backed loan makes a portion of that investment available without selling bitcoin, thus retaining any potential upside and avoiding a taxable event. There are many instances where this loan would save the borrower money and even make a profit off the initial investment.\n\nSuppose a borrower uses it to buy a house, flip a used car or even buy more bitcoin. In that case, they can use the investment proceeds to repay the loan without selling any collateral. This strategy is called a leveraged investment and always comes with a degree of risk. For example, if the price of bitcoin drops during the loan duration and the borrower cannot satisfy the collateral requirement, they could lose their initial investment. Borrowers amplify this risk when they use it to buy more bitcoin.\n\nBut if the second investment pays off and the price of bitcoin increases, an investor can pay off the borrowed amount without selling their collateral and paying capital gains. And if bitcoin doubled in price, the investor can avoid selling bitcoin to pay off the loan by using that collateral to take out another bitcoin loan. This process is called rolling your debt, and it can get risky if investors do not save enough capital on the side to account for price volatility.\n\nWhen is the best time to buy?\n\nThe best time to buy BTC used as collateral for a bitcoin loan is after a significant market drawdown. Bitcoin\u2019s historical chart reveals that the leading cryptocurrency has suffered severe pullbacks of over 80% after hitting a new all-time high in a bullish market cycle.\n\nBuying BTC close to a bear market bottom allows investors to maximize the benefits of a bitcoin loan while minimizing the risk of being margin called on their position. However, the difficulty in timing the bottom of a bear market means investors using bitcoin as collateral must be wary of a continued downtrend and hedge against such an outcome. A good rule of thumb is to over-collateralize so that an 80% drawdown from the most recent all-time high won\u2019t liquidate your collateral. Considering a move where the investor uses the credit line to acquire more bitcoin, their portfolio gains substantially as the market trends upwards following a market bottom.\n\nBenefits vs. risks\n\nA bitcoin-backed loan may be a no-brainer given BTC\u2019s historical performance and ability to recover from severe drawdowns. Yet, these loans come with risks that investors must recognize before using the option. This section discusses the benefits and risks when you borrow against BTC.\n\nBenefits\n\nInstant liquidity: Bitcoin is a highly liquid asset compared to other assets such as real estate, bonds, and stocks. A bitcoin loan allows investors to tap into bitcoin\u2019s highly liquid nature within same-day funding. Since loans are overcollateralized, most platforms do not subject users to credit checks and paper filings that could delay access to liquidity as with other financial assets.\n\nGreater returns: Since bitcoin loans allow investors to borrow money without spending their bitcoins, they can generate greater returns as the value of their collateral increases. For example, if the value of the collateral doubles, the investors can sell half of it to pay off the loan. This would still incur similar and possibly greater capital gains to selling the same amount of BTC prior to the loan. But in this case, the investor nets a greater profit because they avoided selling BTC at half the price.\n\nTax benefits: Bitcoin loans can save investors from the tax headaches associated with selling bitcoins to book profits or losses. The borrowing transaction is not a taxable event in most jurisdictions. Users do not need to file tax returns until they choose to sell the BTC collateral in the future.\n\nCollateral/token value: During severe market downturns, BTC historically records less volatility compared to other crypto assets. Thus, a loan backed by bitcoin can better weather market pullbacks while saving investors from platform risks associated with using altcoins as collateral.\n\nRisks\n\nCollateral liquidation: Investors risk losing their BTC collateral if the asset\u2019s price drops substantially below capital requirements. Failure to supply additional collateral upon a margin call will cause the bitcoin loan platform to liquidate deposited BTC to cover the borrowed amount. Bitcoin\u2019s volatile nature also means that such drops could happen quickly, catching investors off guard.\n\nTechnology risks: Blockchain technology and underpinning technologies such as smart contracts, cross-chain bridge protocols, and currency peg mechanisms are still in their infancy. Users risk losing funds to technology risks such as bugs and security breaches. Even simpler risks, such as transferring funds to the wrong addresses, could lead to permanent losses due to the irreversibility of blockchain transactions.\n\nThird-party risks: Investors take on several counterparty risks when they obtain bitcoin loans through a platform that requires the transfer of assets to the centralized entity. The platform could rehypothecate user deposits for personal interests or suffer a security breach. In some cases, the bitcoin loan platform is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), meaning investors cannot pursue legal recourse in the event of a loss.\n\nHow does it work\n\nWhen borrowers take out a Bitcoin loan, they use their deposited bitcoins as collateral for the amount they borrow in fiat currency. The loan-to-value (LTV) ratio sets the maximum USD value the borrower can borrow. Also, it determines the price at which the deposited assets may be sold to cover the borrowed amount.\n\nCustomers are incentivized to add more collateral to avoid an impending liquidation. For example, consider a user that deposits $1,000 worth of BTC with a 50% LTV. They can borrow up to 50% of the deposited amount, $500 in fiat USD or stablecoins. Assuming the bitcoin loan platform stipulates an 80% LTV threshold for liquidation, the user risks losing their BTC collateral if its value drops by 80% of the borrowed amount (which amounts to $400 in our example).\n\nBitcoin loan categories\n\nIrrespective of the model used to generate profit from loan issuance, bitcoin loan providers usually fall into two categories: decentralized and centralized platforms. The primary difference is in where the platform stores deposited bitcoins.\n\nDeFi protocols: Investors can borrow against BTC using DeFi protocols built on layer-2 bitcoin network solutions such as RSK, Stacks, Liquid and Fedimints. Users usually retain self-custody while lending or locking assets on autonomous protocols. Here are some popular options on each network.\n\nRSK \u2013 Sovryn, Tropykus\n\n\u2013 Sovryn, Tropykus Stacks \u2013 ALEX\n\n\u2013 ALEX Liquid \u2013 Lend at Hodl Hodl\n\n\u2013 Lend at Hodl Hodl Fedimints\n\nCeFi lenders: are centralized bitcoin loan issuers that hold custody over user assets. They typically require users to complete an identity verification process and may impose limits on user accounts. Popular cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance and Bitfinex are examples of CeFi lenders that offer bitcoin loan services.\n\nWhere to get a Bitcoin-backed loan\n\nInvestors can get a bitcoin-backed loan using any lending platform in this section. Readers must weigh the risks and benefits of each platform and choose one based on their portfolio size and investment objectives.\n\nPros Cons No tokenomics\n\nNo fractional reserve banking as all loans are backed 1:1\n\nNo derivatives product to drive irresponsible trading\n\nNo rehypothecation of user assets.\n\nNo yield product, which adds additional risk to the business.\n\nOn-chain proof of reserves via BitGo.\n\nEmail & SMS notifications if the threshold is in danger of being breached No self-custody solution yet\n\nManual application process and KYC requirements\n\nVerify 21 embraces the tried and tested model of bitcoin-only backed loans and narrows the main risks for the client down to the liquidation price of the loan and the custody of collateral. Clients maintain complete control over their LTV ratio as they may add or remove collateral to match their loan profile.\n\nMeanwhile, Verify 21 secures user funds by adopting cold wallets provided by leading custodian service BitGo and proof of reserves scheme to imbibe user trust. Verify 21\u2019s traditional approach poses minimal risks compared to DeFi lenders or centralized entities with a mix of tokenomics and yield generation activities. The company\u2019s business model is more similar to a traditional bank, giving people an extremely secure way to borrow, which does not exist in most parts of the world.\n\nPros Cons No interest rates.\n\nNon-custodial contracts handle loan issuance, repayment and liquidations.\n\nNo KYC requirements\n\nHigh collateralization and a Stability Pool mechanism lower the risk of loan default. Vulnerable to smart contract bugs\n\nUsers risk losing funds to an RBTC depeg.\n\nSovryn Zero is a decentralized trading and lending protocol built on Rootstock (RSK). This bitcoin sidechain relies on the legacy Bitcoin network for security. Users must bridge BTC to RBTC (a pegged version of Bitcoin on RSK) to access the Sovryn Zero protocol and borrow against BTC.\n\nSovryn Zero requires a 110% over-collateralization for loans, meaning users must always hold a BTC amount higher than they borrow. The protocol issues loans in its ZUSD stablecoin, which users can convert to cash or RBTC after paying the loan origination fee. While Sovryn features an SOV token used for protocol governance, users must not hold them to access Bitcoin loans.\n\nPros Cons No interest rates or origination fees\n\nLightning Network support for BTC deposits\n\nThe platform is non-custodial, meaning users can automatically redeem their capital by repaying their loan.\n\nNo rehypothecation as funds are managed on-chain via smart contracts LBTC and the addition of synthetic assets impose a depeg risk.\n\nUsers also run the risk of oracle manipulation and smart contract bugs\n\nFuji Finance is a decentralized and non-custodial protocol built on the layer-2 Bitcoin network, Liquid. Fuji enables users to lock Liquid BTC (LBTC) \u2013 a version of bitcoin on the Liquid network \u2013 as collateral to borrow synthetic assets such as its FUSD stablecoin, stocks, and bonds. The platform mints $1 in FUSD for every $1.5 in BTC deposited, ensuring an over-collateralization of user deposits.\n\nFuji charges a fixed 0.25% fee on loan repayments but no interest rate or loan origination fees. There is no time limit for repayments. The platform also supports Lightning Network deposits, making fast deposits and withdrawals convenient.\n\nPros Cons Non-custodial access as users hold keys to escrowed funds.\n\nNo KYC requirementsInvestors have greater flexibility on loan offersSupports USD withdrawal via multiple stablecoins Interest rates on stablecoin borrowing is higher compared to other bitcoin loan platforms\n\nHodl Hodl is a non-custodial and peer-to-peer focused cryptocurrency protocol built on Liquid Network. Hodl Hodl offers a unique lending product for users to borrow against BTC in a peer-to-peer fashion. Investors can browse a list of Open Borrow offers or create a new borrowing request with their preferred terms, such as loan duration, interest rate, asset, etc.\n\nHodl Hodl matches user requests by having the lender and borrower transfer their assets to a multisig address. The borrower commits to repaying the loan and interest within the agreed timeline to receive their BTC held as collateral. They risk liquidation if the position falls below an agreed LTV threshold or they fail to repay the loan within the timeline.\n\nPros Cons No tokenomics\n\nNo rehypothecation of user deposits\n\nTransparent fees and repayment schedule\n\nOn-chain proof of reservesIdeal for institutional borrowers with high liquidity demands.\n\nLive client support team Manual approval process\n\nHigh-interest rate on USD borrows\n\nUnchained capital is a popular crypto financial services company that offers bitcoin-backed loans alongside its products. Users can access bitcoin loans on Unchained by completing an online application and signing the contracts upon receiving a loan offer from the company.\n\nUnchained capital requires users to pay monthly interest on the loans during its duration, with the principal due to be repaid at the end of the period (usually 6 or 12 months). Users receive a unique address on the blockchain to monitor their collateral and can redeem them upon complete repayment of the loan.\n\nPros Cons Non-custodial access to bitcoin loans\n\nBorrowers are subject to rigorous checks to lower the possibility of defaults\n\nAudited smart contracts\n\nZest Protocol provides user support via its Discord community. Yield generation activities mean greater risk for lenders.\n\nInvestors risk losing collateral to an sBTC depeg.\n\nZest Protocol brands itself as the first on-chain bitcoin capital market for institutional borrowers. Zest is built on the Stacks blockchain and provides access to bitcoin loans through a liquidity pool seeded by lenders seeking yield on BTC. Lenders receive periodic payouts (between 4-7%) APY for providing liquidity.\n\nInvestors must convert BTC to sBTC (Stacks pegged bitcoin version) to interact with the Zest Protocol. At the time of writing, Zest Protocol is available in early access following the completion of security audits and the testnet phase.\n\nPros Cons Secure storage of user funds using industry-standard practice.\n\nCoinbase offers a competitive 8% interest rate of USD borrows\n\nOnly interest payment is mandated during loan durationInvestors can borrow anywhere between $100,000 to $1,000,000 depending on their portfolio size Users can only borrow up to 30% of deposited BTC Lack of self-custody\n\nPopular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase offers a bitcoin loan service, allowing users to borrow up to 40% of their collateral amount in USD. Users can instantly withdraw the credit line via PayPal or ACH wire transfers.\n\nCoinbase loan users may opt for a 12-month fixed term with the option to pay only the interest rate during the loan duration ($10 minimum). They can also extend the fixed term for 12 months, with full repayment only mandatory at the end of the tenure.\n\nMaking the most of bitcoin loans\n\nIn conclusion, bitcoin loans offer a promising way for investors to increase their BTC holdings, acquire new assets, or address cash flow needs while maintaining their investment\u2019s potential upside. However, the permabull mindset and dogma that bitcoin will only ever continue to increase in price can lead many to take extreme risks with these financial instruments. Even if bitcoin wins the world over as the supreme reserve asset for nation states, its volatile price swings can still leave many bitcoin backed loan borrowers out to dry. Users must understand the risks and thoroughly research before selecting a bitcoin loan platform.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "This analysis is by Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Market Structure Analyst Jamie Douglas Coutts. It appeared first on the Bloomberg Terminal.\n\nWith debt levels at extremes and monetary debasement unlikely to slow in coming years, investors may start to view Bitcoin as a suitable portfolio asset \u2014 most likely at the expense of a small portion of fixed-income allocations.\n\nDebasement undercutting asset returns\n\nThe problem with measuring nominal returns of assets is that it obfuscates debasement by monetary inflation. In a fiat system, the monetary base via private credit and central-bank balance sheets must continually expand to ensure the nominal value of collateral backing debt in the system also rises. Sustained periods of nominal price declines (deflation) would ultimately collapse the entire system."

        "content": "The chill of Crypto Winter and the contagion of FTX, the now-bankrupt exchange, felled a series of crypto lenders in 2022. Unchained Capital, a Bitcoin financial services firm that lets customers put up Bitcoin as collateral for loans, is not one of them.\n\nThe company, which also provides Bitcoin custodial services, allows customers to buy Bitcoin, and has a Bitcoin IRA product, announced on Tuesday that it had raised $60 million in a Series B funding round led by Valor Equity Partners.\n\nOther investors include NYDIG, Trammell Venture Partners, Ecliptic Capital, and Highland Capital Partners. A spokesperson for Unchained declined to provide the company\u2019s implied valuation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to show how, if you do it right, cryptocurrency lending is not like the Wild West of broken promises,\u201d Dhruv Bansal, cofounder and chief strategy officer at Unchained, told Fortune in an interview.\n\nThe firm\u2019s funding announcement is rare in a landscape where, in less than a year, a suite of crypto lenders once valued in the billions, including Voyager, Celsius, and BlockFi, declared bankruptcy as the bottom fell out of the crypto bull market in 2022.\n\n\u201cParticularly in lending, [Unchained] has differentiated itself by minimizing risk to both the lender and the borrower,\u201d Vivek Pattipati, a partner at Valor Equity who also will be joining Unchained\u2019s board, said in a statement.\n\nFounded by Bansal and CEO Joe Kelly in 2017, Unchained originally began as a Bitcoin custodial firm where users\u2019 cryptocurrency was kept in \u201ccold\u201d storage, or on a hard drive not connected to the internet. As opposed to other crypto custodians, it has what it calls \u201ccollaborative custody,\u201d or a system in which Unchained can\u2019t access customers\u2019 Bitcoin without explicit permission.\n\nWhen Unchained launched a lending product where customers could secure cash if they offer up Bitcoin as collateral, it continued its cautious approach to deposits. Their \u201ccollaborative custody\u201d system, cofounders Bansal and Kelly say, prevents rehypothecation, or when firms use customers\u2019 collateral to give out loans, make investments, or pay out interest. This strategy can help financial institutions reap outsize rewards, or in the case of Lehman Brothers during the Great Recession, fail precipitously.\n\nWhile Voyager, Celsius, and BlockFi collapsed for myriad reasons, each firm repurposed customer collateral, according to their websites and public documents. \u201cHistorically, that\u2019s what our industry does,\u201d Bansal, in reference to rehypothecation, told Fortune. \u201cWe\u2019re contrarian. That\u2019s not what we do.\u201d\n\nWith their new injection of capital, Bansal and Kelly say that they\u2019re looking to expand Unchained beyond Bitcoin custody, trading, IRAs, and lending to mirror the offerings of a traditional financial services provider. That means, for example, exploring the possibility of creating checking and savings accounts for customers. Bansal and Kelly are also looking to add to their current team of 87 employees in a \u201cdisciplined manner.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of just being a Bitcoin company,\u201d Bansal told Fortune, \u201cwe\u2019re growing into a broader financial services company.\u201d"

        "title": "One Metric That Shows Bitcoin Is Becoming a Store of Value - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It might come as a surprise, but Bitcoin (BTC -0.68%) could finally be fulfilling its potential as a store of value. Since its creation, many have struggled to categorize exactly what Bitcoin is and what purpose it serves. The digital currency has been viewed by some as a viable method of payment, a hedge against inflation, an alternative to fiat currencies, and even digital gold.\n\nWhile it might actually be an amalgam of all these, now more so than ever, it looks like Bitcoin is acting like a traditional safe-haven asset.\n\nAlthough gold is touted as the premier safe haven asset in the face of economic uncertainty, the prices of Bitcoin and gold are actually at some of their highest levels of correlation today and could be a sign that the narrative around Bitcoin might be changing.\n\nThe current landscape\n\nAlthough Bitcoin's main purpose remains slightly ambiguous, it has performed surprisingly well in the last month as turmoil swept through the banking industry in the U.S. and Europe. Since banks such as Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse (CS) toppled in early March, Bitcoin is up more than 25%.\n\nIn similar fashion, when news broke of the banking failures the price of gold skyrocketed as well. Gold has risen nearly 10% since March, and is at an all-time high of more than $2,000 an ounce.\n\nYet, while Bitcoin's price isn't near the all-time highs that gold is, both have traded in a surprisingly similar fashion. Today, the correlation coefficient between the two is about 0.94. Consider that the scale ranges from 1 (perfect correlation and moving in lockstep) to -1 (negative correlation and moving in opposition). There has only been one other time in history that the two have traded at such high levels, and that was back in 2020.\n\nWith Bitcoin having long been criticized for its volatility and lack of intrinsic value, this high level of correlation is a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency. During much of the past year, it moved more in line with the stock market, and specifically tech stocks. But now that seems to be changing.\n\nIt might be a stretch, but perhaps this could mark the beginning of Bitcoin's legitimization as a viable safe haven in the face of economic turbulence.\n\nWhy Bitcoin\n\nOne of the key reasons Bitcoin is proving to be a legitimate store of value is its scarcity. Unlike traditional currencies, which can be printed at will by central banks, the supply of bitcoins is strictly limited. There will only ever be 21 million tokens in circulation, which means that its value is unlikely to be eroded by inflation in the same way that fiat currencies can.\n\nFurthermore, its decentralized nature means that it is not subject to the same kind of political or economic pressures that can affect traditional currencies. Although central banks can be subject to political pressures, Bitcoin operates outside of this system entirely. This gives it an independence and security that traditional currencies simply cannot match.\n\nMore people will likely come to this realization, although it might only come if additional economic pressures cause other institutions to fall. Should this be the case, it would provide a compelling argument to have some exposure to Bitcoin.\n\nWith its price still well off its all-time high, buying today seems as alluring. Simply put, Bitcoin's potentially lucrative future seems to outweigh the risk that is often associated with cryptocurrencies."

        "content": "Australia-based information services platform Finder said it ran a survey in April of 32 crypto industry specialists for views on the price outlook for Bitcoin in the coming decade. According to the average predictions for 2023, Bitcoin will hit a high of US$42,225, a low of US$17,026, and close the year at US$35,485.\n\nSee related article: Bitcoin reclaims US$30,000, Ether heads higher after SEC\u2019s Gensler grilling; Polkadot leads winners\n\nFast facts\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price will be closely related to developments in the banking industry, according to Ben Ritchie, director of Digital Capital Management AU. \u201cA shakeout in the banking industry could demonstrate Bitcoin\u2019s ability to store value, offering an alternative investment option free from government and central bank controls,\u201d he said. But the downside is dwindling liquidity and regulations that choke off access to banks for the crypto sector, he added.\n\nThe lack of confidence in the traditional banking system is seen as the biggest factor behind Bitcoin\u2019s surge in March, which witnessed the collapses of three U.S. banks and the takeover of Switzerland\u2019s Credit Suisse, according to the survey.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has proven to be negatively correlated with the failure of traditional financial institutions. While the banks have collapsed, Bitcoin adoption is increasing amongst institutions and retail investors,\u201d said Rishabh Gupta, director of crypto incubator and consulting company TDeFi, who predicted Bitcoin to reach US$75,000 in 2023.\n\n\u201cPension funds have started allocating 2-3% capital to Bitcoin and other digital assets. Post 2024 halving, Bitcoin supply will become more scarce leaving a positive impact on the price,\u201d Gupta said.\n\nMost of the survey\u2019s respondents are bullish about the current trend in Bitcoin, with 52% saying now is a good time to buy, 32% saying good time to hold, and 16% seeing a sell opportunity.\n\nHowever, 72% of those questioned said the collapse of crypto-friendly banks in the U.S. can hinder cryptocurrency adoption as U.S. digital asset firms struggle to find bank partners.\n\nFinder\u2019s survey predicts Bitcoin\u2019s price will reach US$99,781 by 2025 and US$297,848 by 2030, which are 29% and 58% higher than the survey in January 2023.\n\n\u201cBTC will get quite significant capital inflows from institutional investors following the decrease in interest rates. At the same time, [the market] capitalization of BTC is still very small [and] new money will easily push the price up.\u201d said Ilya Volkov, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange and lender YouHodler.\n\nRecent slowing economic indicators in the U.S. have added to optimism the Federal Reserve could soon end its year-long cycle of raising interest rates to curb inflation. Analysts at CME group expect an 84.6% chance of a 25-basis-point increase in interest rates in May, followed by a rate cut by the end of 2023.\n\nHowever, Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic said on Tuesday it was still too early to consider rate cuts given the stubbornly high inflation rate, according to CNBC on Tuesday. The inflation rate stands at around 5%, compared to the Fed\u2019s target of 2%.\n\nSee related article: United Arab Emirates opens licensing applications for cryptocurrency companies"

Perhaps: Intel dodged a question from Tom\u2019s Hardware about whether it\u2019d exit the Bitcoin ASIC business, saying only, \u201cWe continue to monitor market opportunities.\u201d\n\nIntel\u2019s timing seems to have been... unfortunate. Between the time Intel announced the chip and the time it shipped, Bitcoin had fallen by more than half \u2014 from a high of over $47,000 per coin to under $19,000 each. That said, Bitcoin is back over $30,000 just today after a five-month climb from November lows.\n\nBut a resurgent Bitcoin might not be enough. We live in a very different tech industry than we did in mid-2022: the larger crypto winter has shaken a lot of faith in blockchain tech, AI has become the hot new investment instead, and it seems like practically every tech company is tightening its belts and shaking off less-than-core businesses \u2014 including Intel."

        "content": "\"We believe the pullback we're seeing is more a function of an overdue correction following some impressive moves and possible profit taking on broader risk-off flow in global markets than anything crypto specific,\" said Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group.\n\nThe drop comes after ether rallied 12% over the course of last week and pushed above the $2,000 for the first time since August. That helped drive bitcoin higher by 8% to above the $30,000 mark.\n\nThe price of bitcoin was last lower by 3.22% and trading at $29,227.24, while ether fell 4.82% to $1,980.68, according to Coin Metrics.\n\nBitcoin slid toward $29,000 on Wednesday as traders mulled over the likelihood that Federal Reserve rate cuts may be further away than they thought.\n\nInvestors Wednesday morning were taking in new U.K. inflation data, which showed consumer prices unexpectedly held above 10% in March. That fueled expectations that the Bank of England could hike rates by 25 basis points at its May meeting.\n\nMeanwhile in the U.S., Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic said Tuesday that he anticipates one more 25 basis point interest rate increase and then a hold \"for quite some time.\" Bostic spoke to CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\"\n\n\"There have been some signs the Fed could be more aggressive towards higher interest rate policy than what the market is pricing, which has been driving yield differentials in the U.S. dollar's favor, while weighing on sentiment,\" Kruger said.\n\nMarket participants had expected a pullback in crypto prices this week as investors moved attention away from Ethereum's latest technical upgrade and toward the potential that the Fed could push the economy into a recession with its rate hikes \u2014 which would give bitcoin a new proving ground at a time when investors are just warming to the diversity of the crypto asset's potential.\n\nClara Medalie, head of research at crypto data provider Kaiko, noted that liquidity in the crypto market remains low after the U.S. lost two of its biggest fiat-to-crypto on-ramps in the banking crisis earlier this year \u2013 the networks provided by Silvergate and Signature Bank.\n\n\"Overall, volatility can be expected both towards the upside and downside due to a prolonged bout of thin liquidity in crypto markets, which has hit bitcoin and ether particularly hard,\" she said. \"It is hard to trust any crypto rally with the state of market liquidity, so a sharp drop towards the downside is hardly a surprise.\"\n\nTraders were also digesting Tuesday's contentious congressional hearing with Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who defended his agency's crackdown on cryptocurrency trading platforms and failed to provide a clear answer on whether ether is a security. Gensler has long maintained that all crypto assets other than bitcoin should be deemed securities."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency ecosystem has enjoyed a buoyant start to the year as Bitcoin (BTC) and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols surge in market capitalization through the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThese are the key takeaways from the \u201c2023 Q1 Crypto Industry Report\u201d published by CoinGecko on April 18. BTC emerged as the best-performing asset of Q1 2023, with gains of 72.4%, outperforming the likes of the Nasdaq index and gold, which marked 15.7% and 8.4% gains, respectively.\n\nThe report highlights that all major asset classes saw gains through the first quarter of the year, barring crude oil, which dropped by 6.1%. This decline was attributed to United States inflation data, which cited a reduction in oil demand and the ill effects of the U.S. banking crisis.\n\nBitcoin has been the best-performing asset through the first three months of 2023. Source: CoinGecko\n\nThe wider cryptocurrency markets have enjoyed a quarter of resurgence, with the overall market capitalization reaching $1.2 trillion at the end of Q1. CoinGecko highlights a 48.9%, $406 billion gain from the cryptocurrency market cap of $829 billion at the end of 2022.\n\nThe DeFi space was another standout performer, rising by $29.6 billion in value through the first quarter. The report cites the impressive performance of liquid staking governance tokens, which saw a 210% increase in market cap since the start of 2023.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade played a major role in driving the increase of capital flows into liquid staking pools, with the network\u2019s upgrade finally unlocking ETH staking reward withdrawals. The report notes that liquid staking is now the third-largest category in the DeFi sector.\n\nRelated: Ether hits 11-month high as post-Shapella withdrawals pass 1M ETH\n\nWhile Bitcoin and DeFi have been major movers thus far this year, the top 15 stablecoins saw their market cap drop by $6.2 billion. CoinGecko attributes this 4.5% drop in market cap to the shutdown of Binance USD (BUSD) by Paxos and the temporary depeg of USD Coin (USDC) during the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023.\n\nTether (USDT) strengthened its position as the largest stablecoin by market cap in 2023, adding $13.6 billion since the start of the year, while USDC and BUSD recorded market cap losses of 26.9% and 54.5%, respectively.\n\nNonfungible token trading volume has also surged again in 2023, marking a 68% rise from Q4 2022 to $4.5 billion during the first quarter of 2023. NFT marketplace newcomer Blur accounted for the majority of NFT trading volume since its launch in October 2022, accounting for 71.8% of the market share in March 2023.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin in Senegal: Why is this African country using BTC?"

        "content": "Bitcoin is already on a torrid pace through the first three and a half months of 2023, but some crypto market observers believe that the largest digital currency is poised to rocket higher over the next several weeks. Should that move materialize, it could facilitate upside for crypto-correlated, equity-based exchange traded funds such as the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) .\n\nHome to 36 stocks as well as a 13.27% stake in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), SATO makes for an ideal avenue for participating in possible bitcoin upside without having to directly own the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn an interview with Barron\u2019s, Vetle Lund, an analyst at crypto research group K33, highlighted bitcoin\u2019s near-term technical picture, which indicates that sizable gains could be afoot over the next month.\n\n\u201cWhile no one should expect a one-to-one mirroring of the current drawdown to previous drawdowns, the resemblance to the 2018 drawdown is staggering,\u201d Lund said. \u201cIf history repeats, Bitcoin will peak around May 20 at $45,000.\u201d\n\nBitcoin was trading around $30,340 late Tuesday, indicating that a move to $45,000 over a month would undoubtedly be impressive. The last time bitcoin traded around that level was in early 2022, but that was as it was selling off from its November 2021 level as the crypto winter of 2022 set in.\n\nA nearly 50% move in a matter of weeks, even for bitcoin, is a tough road for any asset. However, it\u2019s not completely out of the realm of possibility for bitcoin because there are potential catalysts looming, including the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on May 3.\n\n\u201cThe rally across cryptos this year has largely come amid expectations that the Fed will soon become more accommodative on monetary policy\u2014a narrative that will continue to shift ahead of the central bank\u2019s next decision on May 3,\u201d according to Barron\u2019s.\n\nAs for SATO, the Invesco ETF\u2019s leverage to bitcoin price action beyond GBTC is clear. Many of the ETF\u2019s other holdings are crypto miners \u2014 an asset class highly tethered to goings-on in spot crypto prices. SATO\u2019s sensitivity to bitcoin prices has been on full display in recent weeks, as the ETF is higher by 30% over the past 90 days. Roughly 84% of the fund\u2019s equity holdings reside in mid- and small-cap territory.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel .\n\nThe opinions and forecasts expressed herein are solely those of Tom Lydon, and may not actually come to pass.

Around 90 per cent of Deribit\u2019s customers are institutional clients.\n\nPopular coins such as bitcoin and ether have outperformed assets such as stocks and commodities this year, rising 50 per cent and 65 per cent respectively.\n\nIt also comes a month after Binance, the world\u2019s largest marketplace for crypto trading, ended a six-month foray into zero-fee trading, a move that accelerated its market share.\n\nLuuk Strijers, chief commercial officer at Deribit, said the exchange\u2019s move into spot trading was driven by customer demand.\n\n\u201cYou would have to buy ether on Binance instead of Deribit,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIf you want to convert $5mn [into bitcoin], for example, we would have to tell you to go elsewhere, which is terrible customer service.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn order to have a proper derivatives offering you also need to have spot,\u201d he added.\n\nBig-name money managers have continued to explore digital assets and monetise investor interest in the past year, even as the industry suffered a confidence crisis and many companies failed.\n\n\u201cSerious institutional players remain committed and, in fact, see the open space after the demise of multiple crypto-native players as an opportunity.\u201d Bernstein analysts wrote this week.\n\nDeribit will offer free trading in pairs of ether and bitcoin, and ether and bitcoin against the stablecoin USDC, which is operated by Circle. US-listed Coinbase charges up to 0.6 per cent for a trade, for example.\n\nStrijers added that trading on the three pairs would remain free to trade \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d and that future tokens that might be added would have a charge.\n\nThe market share of Binance soared by a fifth after launching fee-free trading in 13 coins and at reached nearly two-thirds of total volume on the exchange, according to data provider Kaiko. However the exchange\u2019s lead fell back after it reintroduced charges.\n\nDeribit added that it was looking to use spot trading as an entry for customers to trade options and futures. Strijers said this would \u201cservice our existing client base and potentially attract some new clients who then . . . will also trade options, futures or perpetual [futures]\u201d.\n\nDeribit was founded in 2016 and is backed by investors including crypto venture firm 10T Holdings and trading firm Akuna Capital."

Many still believe in the traditional legacy financial system of stocks and bonds, but Bitcoin has grown to a point where some professional athletes are taking multi-million-dollar contracts in Bitcoin instead of a check.\n\nIn short, Bitcoin has become much more than its original intent in Satoshi\u2019s 2008 whitepaper. Below, I\u2019ll discuss what Bitcoin means now and the value it holds for investors at every level.\n\nThe value of decentralization\n\nBitcoin\u2019s core value and most significant characteristic are that no person can control it independently. Because the rules of the original Bitcoin whitepaper written in 2008 cannot be edited, it is considered the most decentralized digital currency. Users and developers can propose changes but cannot force the nodes that run the software to adopt them.\n\nAlso written into the Bitcoin code as a distinctive characteristic is a \u201chard cap\u201d \u2014 or limit \u2014 on the number of Bitcoins that can ever exist, which is 21 million. Bitcoin can also never be controlled by one single entity, unlike fiat currencies in developed countries where the government can control the amount distributed to the open market. This lends a tremendous \u201cstore of value\u201d for Bitcoin, defined as \u201can asset, commodity, or currency that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged in the future without deteriorating in value.\u201d\n\nIn underdeveloped countries, where currency volatility is higher than in developed economies, Bitcoin has a much more significant impact than a typical store of value. For example, Bitcoin is considered legal tender in El Salvador and the Central African Republic. Bitcoin\u2019s unique decentralized nature could help preserve its value even in the future. Because of that core value, Bitcoin may become more utilized than a store of value in many different areas.\n\nThe future of Bitcoin\n\nFor the near future, Bitcoin will likely co-exist, as it has for years, with traditional financial systems to help offset the pain points of fiat currencies. While fiat currencies offer economic stability, growth potential and ubiquity in international trade, they are rife with issues. Fiat currencies are susceptible to inflation, reliant on government stability and have significant fees for withdrawals and transfers. This is where Bitcoin offers an attractive alternative because no one entity can control its characteristics.\n\nAt the same time, a double-edged sword exists: governments are more likely to intervene to suppress Bitcoin activity to support traditional financial markets and control the number of currencies in circulation. Since there is no central governing authority for Bitcoin, it is much more susceptible to the whims of financial regulators in some jurisdictions. As Bitcoin continues to exist alongside traditional currencies and attempts to operate within the legacy financial system, it will be affected by market factors and competition. For example, the crypto winter of 2022 significantly impacted Bitcoin prices, as its value dropped 65% from November 2021 to September 2022.\n\nOne of the disadvantages of Bitcoin, as opposed to more modern blockchain-based currencies, is its slower rate of technical growth and processing speeds. As the original cryptocurrency with such massive global usage, the system lacks scalability. Another issue that Bitcoin faces is that competitors continue to expand their use cases. Ethereum continues to grow its impact beyond strict cryptocurrency transactions via its ability to enable smart contracts.\n\nGovernment regulation can also serve as a roadblock, slowing down speeds and limiting the reach of rapidly growing industries. Governments are stuck in the middle of wanting to curb the illegal use of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies while not completely halting the growth of a lucrative industry that has positively impacted countless lives.\n\nGeorgetown University professor Linda Jeng recently told the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs that a lack of a digital asset regulatory foundation puts American businesses, consumers and the economy as a whole at a \u201ccompetitive disadvantage\u201d relative to other nations. This is a problem that doesn\u2019t only face the United States. But, when the regulations are implemented and have time to take effect, they can work as a foundation for a thriving modern digital currency industry.\n\nBitcoin remains king\n\nNo system is perfect, and despite its faults and the threat of regulation, Bitcoin remains as a worthy option for a potential investment. While the crypto winter caused many people to shy away, it\u2019s not apparent that there is a direct correlation between the selloff and Bitcoin\u2019s long-term viability. Rather, Bitcoin offers a trustless alternative to the moral hazard and eroding trust surrounding traditional banking.\n\nThe bottom line is this: Since its introduction in 2009, Bitcoin has produced fairly consistent profits for mid- to long-term investment. This shows little signs of changings. As investment in and popularity of decentralized technologies continues to grow, Bitcoin could continue to exceed the original scope and expectations outlined by Satoshi Nakamoto 15 years ago.\n\nThe information provided here is not investment, tax or financial advice.

Won\u2019t that tank ETH\u2019s price? It didn\u2019t happen. In the initial moments after the upgrade went live, the cryptocurrency held steady just above $1,900. Hours later, ETH zoomed above $2,100 . What\u2019s more, there\u2019s evidence there was an inflow , not outflow, of money into ETH in the aftermath. This raises a question: Does the ability to stake and then unstake any time improve the case for investing in ETH?

        "content": "United States Senator Elizabeth Warren blamed the Bitcoin (BTC) mining industry for rising energy prices in American households based on unverified mainstream reporting. However, Crypto Twitter was not ready to let it slide and unanimously decided to clarify the disinformation.\n\nWhile Senator Warren has prominently spoken against the crypto ecosystem, the latest dig at Bitcoin mining comes based on a New York Times article. The report accuses Bitcoin miners of cashing in on electricity and indirectly forcing the public to pay the price. The narrative fit Warren\u2019s perception of the crypto industry as she stated:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been ringing the alarm about the risks that Bitcoin poses to our power grids and climate. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy should use their authority to require cryptominers to disclose their energy use and emissions.\u201d\n\nTo help Warren rethink and make an informed decision, numerous entrepreneurs responded, trying to fix the misconception. Bitcoin podcaster Stephan Livera straight up dismissed the NYT report, stating that the \u201cNYT report is filled with disinformation.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, MicroStrategy founder and chairman Michael Saylor contradicted Warren\u2019s statement. He explained how Bitcoin mining does not contribute to pollution but helps decrease energy bills.\n\n#Bitcoin miners decrease the energy bill for millions of American families and do not create pollution. They are data centers running on excess electricity that would otherwise be wasted, and perform the vital role of powering the most secure computer network in the world. \u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) April 18, 2023\n\nOthers from the Crypto Twitter community sought to tag Tesla CEO and Dogecoin (DOGE) supporter Elon Musk in the conversation, who has been actively trying to eradicate disinformation campaigns on his newly-owned social media platform.\n\nCanadian Broadcasting Corp said they\u2019re \u201cless than 70% government-funded\u201d, so we corrected the label pic.twitter.com/lU1EWf76Zu \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 18, 2023\n\nThe New York Times was one of the first news publications to become a victim of Musk\u2019s attack against disinformation and propaganda. Twitter recently stripped the verified blue mark from NYT\u2019s primary account after the organization refused to comply with the subscription requirement. Cointelegraph reported on a method to find out who paid for Twitter Blue verification.\n\nRelated: Elon Musk reportedly buys thousands of GPUs for Twitter AI project\n\nIn a recent FOX interview, Musk revealed the development of a ChatGPT rival known as TruthGPT. According to the entrepreneur, TruthGPT is a large language model that will be trained to explore the mysteries of the universe. In his words:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to start something which I call TruthGPT, or a maximum truth-seeking AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe.\u201d\n\nIn the interview, Musk told Fox anchor Tucker Carlson that ChatGPT \u201cis programmed by left-wing experts, which train the chatbots to lie.\u201d\n\nMagazine: US enforcement agencies are turning up the heat on crypto-related crime"

        "content": "'Meltdown to zero': Kevin O'Leary says there's a 100% chance of another crypto debacle \u2014 and it will happen 'over and over' again. Here's what he likes instead\n\nBitcoin is on another wild ride.\n\nLate last year, the downfall of cryptocurrency exchange FTX sent investors running for the exits. But now, bitcoin is up 80% in 2023.\n\nDon't miss\n\nStill, Shark Tank star Kevin O\u2019Leary warns that there could be more fiascos in the crypto world.\n\nWhen asked whether he believed there would be another FTX during a Kitco News interview, O\u2019Leary\u2019s response was affirmative.\n\n\u201cIf you're asking me will there be another meltdown to zero? Absolutely, 100% it'll happen and it'll keep happening over and over and over again,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAll the unregulated exchanges are having massive outflows right now. The smart money has got the joke. They saw what happened in FTX. They're not sitting around for an explanation.\u201d\n\nSimply put, institutional investors won\u2019t put their money in unregulated crypto exchanges.\n\n\u201cIf you're not willing to be audited, and I'm speaking about any exchange, if you don't have an auditor, you don't want to be transparent, you don't want to disclose ownership, why should institutional capital stay there? Of course it's not going to.\u201d\n\nThat said, O\u2019Leary isn\u2019t bailing on bitcoin.\n\nKeeping it safe\n\nMr. Wonderful has been buying the dip.\n\n\u201cI have been going back into the crypto markets lately. Anytime bitcoin drops below $17,000, I add to our positions there.\u201d\n\nAnd where does O\u2019Leary keep his crypto investments these days?\n\nUp north.\n\n\u201cThe only place I have any crypto right now is up in the Canadian market, which is 100% regulated. They have a broker-dealer attached to an exchange regulated by the OSC [Ontario Securities Commission], all kinds of rules, you can't commingle,\u201d he tells Kitco News.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIt's called Bitbuy and I've got my money there. It's owned by WonderFi, a public company. I\u2019ve got lots of capital tied up in there \u2014 it's the only place.\u201d\n\nAs you\u2019d expect, O\u2019Leary is not going to put his money in unregulated exchanges.\n\n\u201cForget it, never again.\u201d\n\nRead more: Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market \u2014 and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds\n\nGold\n\nSome say that bitcoin is the new gold. While O\u2019Leary has been one of the more outspoken proponents of bitcoin, he still likes the original yellow metal.\n\nO\u2019Leary tells Kitco News that to hedge against inflation, he has a 5% weighting in gold and a 5% weighting in bitcoin.\n\nIndeed, gold can\u2019t be printed out of thin air like fiat money. And its value tends to stay resilient even in times of crisis.\n\nThere are many ways to gain exposure to gold. O\u2019Leary uses two methods for his 5% exposure.\n\n\u201cI have half of that \u2014 two and a half percent \u2014 in physical gold that I pay for storage. And I use various ETFs for the rest so I can rebalance every quarter.\u201d\n\nSome gold investors also own shares of gold mining companies, but O\u2019Leary is not one of them.\n\n\u201cI don't own the miners because over a long period of time, 25 years, you want to get the idiot management out of the equation,\u201d he says. \u201cAll they're doing for you is mining it out of the ground. You might as well just own the commodity.\u201d\n\nStocks\n\nAt the end of the day, O\u2019Leary\u2019s portfolio doesn\u2019t consist mostly of gold or bitcoin. He\u2019s still an equity investor above all else.\n\n\u201cI've got a large allocation to equities,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd like most smart investors, O\u2019Leary is not putting all the eggs in one basket.\n\n\u201cNo equity more than 5%. No sector more than 20%. So it's very diversified.\u201d\n\nOf course, even a diversified portfolio can have its ups and downs. In 2022, the S&P 500 tumbled 19.4%. So what should investors look for in a company in today\u2019s market?\n\n\u201cNow I'm looking for companies that, A, are cash flow positive, B, do distributions of profits. So in other words, they take the cash and they distribute it through dividends. Some of them will do share buybacks, but not now that's being taxed, I think that the dividend is going to be more popular,\u201d he says.\n\nAt the same time, O\u2019Leary emphasizes that it\u2019s important for companies to do this \u201cwithout taking on debt.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo if you have a clean balance sheet, not too much debt, and you're distributing profits, well, that's a good place to invest.\u201d\n\nWhat to read next\n\n60% of working Americans aren't confident about retiring one day. Put those nagging thoughts to rest \u2014 in as little as 3 minutes heading into a recession\n\nUBS says 61% of millionaire collectors allocate up to 30% of their overall portfolio to this exclusive asset class\n\nThe average home insurance policy is nearly 40% higher than it was 12 years ago \u2014 here's how to spend less on peace of mind\n\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

The idea that every government, private company, every individual hacker in the world is going to sign and agree to, like, slow down AI research is jokingly nice. And it's very scary to me that people would rather hand over control of all this development to some sort of, you know, vague, global body that controls how we can develop and interact with AI systems \u2013 that would make decisions for the rest of humanity. Now this is out of the box, I don't think it's possible to stop, we can sort of predict the way things will go. Some trends are kind of obvious: There's going to be automation of a large swath of the current \u201cwhite-collar labor market.\u201d Consumer AI systems are really just better and more efficient versions of mental labor. But when it comes to longer-term trends, whether AI will destroy us \u2013 these things are fascinating. Through prompting AI you can actually get it to write software, explain to you how to download it and get it running on your machine \u2013 that\u2019s how it escapes the box, right? It\u2019ll become very tricky to discern, like, what is human and AI, or what was augmented. The weird effects here are emergent and hard to predict. When I think about it as an investor, and see algorithms that are trained on specific data, maybe the algorithm itself ends up being a commodity, which I think is something nobody exactly saw. You know, there's this sort of interface and application layer that actually ends up being the most valuable components themselves. I do think it's possible this is one of the singularity technologies where we create an AI to write code to create a better AI and it's like a recursive loop, which may lead to recursive loops with other novel technologies."

For example, he said it knowingly allowed U.S. citizens to trade on the exchange through the use of obfuscation tools. The comments stem from the CFTC\u2019s March 27 lawsuit against Binance and its CEO, Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao, for alleged trading violations.\n\nAlso on April 14, in an open meeting with U.S. Securities and Exchange commissioners and staff, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said the agency will be revisiting the proposed redefinition of an \u201cexchange.\u201d The SEC intends to bring certain brokers under additional regulatory scrutiny, and explicitly include decentralized applications.\n\nOn April 17, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged crypto asset trading platform Bittrex and former CEO William Shihara with allegedly operating an unregistered securities exchange, broker and clearing agency. Separately, Bittrex Global is being charged witoperating a shared order book with Bittrex.\n\nBittrex had already announced its intention of closing down U.S. operations on April 30 after reportedly receiving a Wells notice in March warning about the impending regulatory action.\n\nOther countries are taking different approaches\n\nThe regulatory environment in Hong Kong seems to have improved after China\u2019s state-affiliated banks began to onboard crypto companies. In addition to the Bank of Communications, ZA Bank \u2014 Hong Kong\u2019s largest virtual bank controlled by a Chinese internet insurer \u2014 will also act as the settlement bank for some crypto companies.\n\nAccording to a Wall Street Journal report, these banks will serve as settlement banks to enable token deposits at authorized exchanges to be withdrawn in Hong Kong dollars, Chinese yuan and U.S. dollars.\n\nThe securities regulator of Argentina also approved a Bitcoin-based futures index on April 12. The regulated derivatives contract will offer qualified investors a safe and regulated way to gain BTC exposure. All trades will be settled in the national fiat currency, with traders required to deposit Argentine pesos through bank transfer.\n\nTo understand how professional traders are positioned, traders should analyze the options markets.\n\nOptions traders are leaning toward bearish structures\n\nTraders can gauge the market's sentiment by measuring whether more activity is going through call (buy) options or put (sell) options. Generally speaking, call options are used for bullish strategies, whereas put options are for bearish ones.\n\nA put-to-call ratio of 0.70 indicates that put option open interest lags behind the greater number of call options. In contrast, a 1.40 indicator favors put options, which is a bearish sign.\n\nBTC options volume put-to-call ratio. Source: Laevitas\n\nSince April 5, Bitcoin's put-to-call ratio has been either balanced or favoring protective put options. The current 0.60 indicator slightly shows higher demand for neutral-to-bearish option strategies, although there is nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nTo confirm whether traders effectively became bearish, one should also analyze the Bitcoin futures markets.\n\nBitcoin futures metrics remain neutral-to-bearish\n\nBitcoin quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. These fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement for a longer period of time.\n\nAs a result, futures contracts on healthy markets should trade at a 5% to 10% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin 'mega whales' send BTC price to $30K as volatility hits crypto\n\nBitcoin 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.ch\n\nThe chart shows traders have been neutral-to-bearish for the past two weeks as the basis indicator oscillated between 2.4% and 4.3%. This data should not come as a surprise given that Bitcoin price remains 56% below its $69,000 all-time high.\n\nBitcoin's margin and futures markets reflect a neutral to bearish sentiment, but nothing exaggerated. The reduction in demand from bullish strategies is likely reflecting the 50% Bitcoin price gains since March 11.\n\nHowever, investors fear regulatory action could dim the demand for retail and institutional clients, so unless there's more clarity on that front, the odds of Bitcoin breaking above $31,000 remain slim.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Bitcoin Store Launches Innovative Walk-in Exchanges - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "SPLIT, CROATIA, April 19, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bitcoin Store disrupts the cryptocurrency landscape with innovative walk-in exchanges for easy and secure trading. In the picturesque city of Split, Croatia, The Bitcoin Store is leading the charge in transforming the cryptocurrency landscape with their groundbreaking in-person trading platform. Established by cryptocurrency pioneers, the platform aims to bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds of cryptocurrency, democratizing the industry and making it accessible to everyone - regardless of their background or experience. With their game-changing approach, The Bitcoin Store is set to revolutionize personal finance and create a trustworthy space for secure transactions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Birth of a Vision: A World Where Crypto Is Accessible to All\n\nIn 2013, a pair of long-time friends Tomislav V. and Sime B. identified the enormous promise of cryptocurrencies. Observing the challenges many individuals faced when it came to handling or liquidating their digital assets, they established Bitkonan.com, one of the earliest European cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nLater in 2018 after the bull run, when crypto became more \"mainstream,\" they were surprised that the space still appeared daunting and out of reach for many potential users, especially non-tech individuals.\n\nIn response, they started working on a new idea called \"Bitcoin Store\" - a unique concept that merges the convenience of online exchanges with the accessibility of walk-in stores.\n\n\"Our goal was to create an environment where even the least tech-savvy individuals could manage cryptocurrencies with just a few clicks,\" says Tomislav, CEO of Bitcoin Store.\n\n\"By introducing a chain of walk-in cryptocurency exchanges in major cities alongside an online platform, we make it possible for anyone to buy, sell, and top up their accounts with cash or crypto instantly. Most importantly, we wanted to become a trustworthy crypto companion for non-tech users in a space that still lacks constructive customer support.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nA Platform Built on Accessibility, Convenience, and Education\n\nThe Bitcoin Store is more than just a trading platform. It's a movement designed to empower individuals to easily navigate the complex world of digital currencies.\n\nBy developing an approachable and friendly brand personality, the company seeks to foster a strong community and establish trust among its users. Ultimately, The Bitcoin Store aims to make the world of cryptocurrency and fintech accessible to all.\n\nBrick and mortar cryptocurrency exchange: A Safe Haven in a Landscape Seeking Enhanced Customer Experiences\n\nA non-tech user who is unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies may have experienced a sense of confusion or overwhelm, not knowing where to begin when entering the world of crypto.\n\nEven with advancements in user experience and abundant knowledge resources, blockchain technology's technical and economic aspects can still be overwhelming.\n\nFurthermore, despite all these improvements, majority of users report cases of bad customer support with cold or non-existing communication efforts from exchanges.\n\nPhysical cryptocurrency exchanges serve as an ideal starting point for those new to blockchain technology. These exchanges not only facilitate trading but also function as educational centers.\n\nRather than navigating the complexities of an online exchange, a user can receive guidance from an exchange agent who can help set up a digital wallet and explain the various types of cryptocurrency storage and their differences.\n\nRegular users can also benefit from the convenience of visiting a nearby branch for direct support and prompt resolution of potential issues, which is a rarity in the online realm.\n\nFor instance, when encountering a problem on an online exchange, the only available option is usually contacting customer service and potentially waiting hours for a response.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin Store walk-in cryptocurrency exchanges instill trust and security in their users. Before committing to any transactions, a simple internet search can confirm that the exchange is a regulated company adhering to the highest security standards.\n\nThe Future of Personal Finance: Expanding Services and the Store Finance (SEF) Token\n\nThe Bitcoin Store plans to introduce new features such as unique IBAN accounts, physical/virtual credit cards, staking, lending, and loans to further its mission.\n\nAt the heart of this evolving ecosystem will be their new project - Store Finance (SEF), a new feature designed to be the dedicated utility token within the Bitcoin Store network.\n\nBy holding and using SEF tokens, users will enjoy numerous benefits, including:\n\nFee reduction\n\nSEF staking rewards\n\nCashback on a physical VISA credit card\n\nEarly access to new crypto projects via the Bitcoin Store launchpad\n\nRecommendation program benefits\n\nCrypto lending and loan program benefits\n\nJoin the Revolution: The Store Finance (SEF) Presale\n\nThe second round of the Store Finance (SEF) presale is set to commence on April 18, 2023, and will run until April 25, 2023.\n\nThe pre-sale price of tokens will be a fixed 0.2\u20ac per token.\n\nBitcoin Store guarantees a redemption price of 0.1\u20ac per token in the next 2 years!\n\nThe token will be available for purchase exclusively on the Bitcoin Store launchpad site.\n\nDon't miss out on the opportunity to join this groundbreaking ecosystem and help shape the future of personal finance.\n\nAbout The Bitcoin Store\n\nFounded in 2018 in Split, Croatia, The Bitcoin Store is a pioneering brand that connects the physical and online worlds of cryptocurrency trading. With five walk-in stores in major Croatian cities and plans to expand the network across Europe, the company is focused on making the world of cryptocurrency and fintech accessible to users of all backgrounds and experience levels.

        "title": "Intel Kills 'Blockscale' Bitcoin Chip - HPCwire",
        "content": "An interview with Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger from just last year already hasn\u2019t aged well. In the interview, Gelsinger decries the energy consumption of Bitcoin mining (\u201ca climate crisis\u201d) moments before announcing Intel\u2019s own Bitcoin mining product, Blockscale 1000, which Gelsinger claims is \u201cdramatically better\u201d than other power-guzzling chips that take over energy grids. Now, Blockscale is no more, with Gelsinger chopping off the product as part of its cost-cutting efforts to save $10 billion by 2025. The news was originally reported by Tom\u2019s Hardware.\n\n\u201cAs we prioritize our investments in IDM 2.0, we have end-of-lifed the Intel Blockscale 1000 Series ASIC while we continue to support our Blockscale customers,\u201d Intel told HPCwire in an email.\n\nThe Blockscale chip was released last year with expectations that it would serve the fast-growing mining and digital transactions market. Intel sold its chips to infrastructure companies like Argo Blockchain, GRIID Infrastructure and Block.The blockchain chip received support from Raja Koduri, who formerly led Intel\u2019s accelerated computing division, but resigned late last year.\n\nIntel has now posted a document notifying customers of Blockscale\u2019s cancellation.\n\nThe last orders for the product will be taken in October this year, with the last shipments going out in April next year. The document also revealed that Intel had three versions of the Blockscale chip.\n\nCryptocurrencies like Ethereum have converted to a proof-of-stake model, which reduces the strain on GPUs to mine cryptocurrencies. It was a shift from the older proof-of-work model, which awarded coins to the most powerful miners throwing the most hardware resources to solve complex math. That resulted in the buildup of GPU factories to mine cryptocurrency. The proof-of-stake model and its lower reliance on hardware led many miners to repurpose existing GPUs for the purposes of cloud and acceleration of applications.\n\nIn a way, Gelsinger has righted the ship by cutting the Bitcoin chip, which stood out like a sore thumb in Intel\u2019s chip lineup. It was introduced almost as an afterthought to serve a highly volatile market, and it went against Gelsinger\u2019s resolve to focus on engineering and a renewed focus on highly targeted markets.\n\nHive Blockchain, a company that mines bitcoins, in a March filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it expected to receive 645 mining devices called BuzzMiners, and also mentioned the devices were powered by the Intel Blockscale ASIC. It said the number of BuzzMiners in its arsenal would total 6,300 in the coming months. This week, a filing from Hive said the company had received 5,600 BuzzMiners, but made no mention of Intel Blockscale. It also did not mention the number of chips it expected to receive.\n\nHive also uses GPUs for Bitcoin mining, but given the energy prices and difficulty mining Bitcoin, Hive is trying to broaden its GPUs in data centers to run cloud and accelerated computing applications. The company is running a GPU high-performance computing pilot that is \u201cgenerating approximately $1,800/MWh of revenue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese advancements and agility allow us to generate positive gross mining margin during a crypto mining bear market,\u201d Hive wrote in the April filing.\n\nThe market volatility also affected Nvidia and AMD, which could not forecast GPU revenue because of the boom-and-bust nature of the crypto market. During the GPU shortage and Bitcoin boom, miners scalped up most of the available GPUs, which caused prices to skyrocket. Nvidia and AMD were trying to target GPUs at gamers and business users, and ultimately locked out the mining features from its GPUs."

        "title": "Intel Discontinues Bitcoin-Mining Blockscale Chips, No Future Gens Announced - Tom's Hardware",
        "content": "(Image credit: Intel)\n\nIt's been just a year since Intel officially announced its Bitcoin-mining Blockscale ASICs, but today the company announced the end of life of its first-gen Blockscale 1000-series chips without announcing any follow-up generations of the chips. We spoke with Intel on the matter, and the company told Tom's Hardware that \u201cAs we prioritize our investments in IDM 2.0, we have end-of-lifed the Intel Blockscale 1000 Series ASIC while we continue to support our Blockscale customers.\u201d\n\n\n\nIntel's statement cites the company's tighter focus on its IDM 2.0 operations as the reason for ending the Blockscale ASICs, a frequent refrain in many of its statements as it has exited several businesses amid company-wide belt-tightening. We also asked Intel if it planned to exit the Bitcoin ASIC business entirely, but the company responded, \"We continue to monitor market opportunities.\"\n\nIn the original announcement that the company would enter the blockchain market, then-graphics-chief Raja Koduri noted that the company had created a Custom Compute Group within the AXG graphics unit to support the Bitcoin ASICs and \"additional emerging technology.\" However, Intel recently restructured the AXG group, and Koduri left the company shortly thereafter. We asked Intel about the fate of the Custom Compute Group, but it says it has no organizational changes to share at this time.\n\n(Image credit: Intel)\n\nIntel hasn't announced any next-gen Bitcoin mining products and its Blockscale ASIC landing pages are now all inactive, but its statement implies that it is leaving the door open for future opportunities if they arise. Intel's initial entry into the market for bitcoin-mining chips came at an inopportune time, as its chips finally became available right as Bitcoin valuations crashed at the end of the last crypto craze, and Intel's apparent exit from the market comes as Bitcoin is back on the upswing \u2014 it recently cleared $30,000 for the first time in nearly a year.\n\n\n\nIntel's Bitcoin-mining chips initially came into the public eye under the Bonanza Mine codename it used for its R&D chips that were never commercialized, but the company later announced it would enter the blockchain market and summarily launched a second-gen model named 'Blockscale\" to select large-scale mining companies like BLOCK, GRIID Infrastructure, and Argo Blockchain, among others.\n\n\n\nAside from exceptionally competitive performance relative to competing Bitcoin-mining chips, Blockscale's big value prop stemmed from the stability of Intel's chip-fabbing resources. Several large industrial mining companies signed large long-term deals for a steady supply of Blockscale ASICs, thus circumventing the volatility with the mostly China-based manufacturers that engaged in wild pricing manipulations based on Bitcoin valuations, were subject to tariffs, and suffered from supply disruptions and shortages, not to mention the increased costs of logistics and shipping from China.\n\n(Image credit: Intel)\n\nIntel tells us that it will continue to serve its existing Boockscale customers, implying it will satisfy its existing long-term contracts. Intel's customers have until October 2023 to order new chips, and shipments will end in April 2024. Meanwhile, Intel has scrubbed nearly all of the landing and product pages for the Blockscale chips from its website.\n\n\n\nIntel's latest move comes on the heels of a cost-cutting spree \u2014 the company sold off its server-building business last week, killed off its networking switch business, ended its 5G modems, wound down its Optane Memory production, jettisoned the company's drone business and sold its SSD storage unit to SK Hynix.\n\n\n\nIntel's cost-cutting also applies to numerous other projects, as Intel has also shelved plans for a mega-lab in Oregon and canceled its planned development center in Haifa. The company has also trimmed some programs, like its RISC-V pathfinder program, and streamlined its data center graphics roadmap by axing the Rialto Bridge GPUs and delaying its Falcon Shores chips to 2025.\n\nIt's unclear it Intel will continue to make further cuts to its far-flung businesses, but it is clear that the company is committed to slimming down to increase its focus on its core competencies as it weathers some of the worst market conditions in decades, not to mention intense competition from multiple foes."

Intel reportedly said the move was aimed at a strategy of prioritizing the manufacturing of certain chips to outside customers, cutting overall costs.\n\nIntel launched the Blockscale mining chips in April 2022, saying at the time the ASIC hardware would have a hash rate of up to 580 gigahash per second, with each chip capable of being combined and merged into a single mining unit. Mining firms Argo Blockchain, Block, Hive Blockchain Technologies and GRIID Infrastructure were among the first companies to integrate the technology into their operations.\n\nRelated: The economics of cryptocurrency mining: Costs, revenues and market trends\n\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger reportedly took a 25% pay cut in February, with the company projecting annual cost reductions of up to $10 billion due to cost-cutting initiatives and efficiency gains by 2026.

        "content": "In April 2022, Intel announced a new Blockscale series of application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) meant for \"energy-efficient blockchain hashing.\" In other words, chips designed for mining bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The company positioned the Blockscale 1000-series ASICs to lower power usage and help ease the then-ongoing shortage of GPUs.\n\n\u201cFor proof-of-work algorithms that are compatible with ASIC-based systems and SHA-256 hashing, the Intel Blockscale ASIC will provide the energy efficiency and computing power needed to achieve scalability and sustainability,\" reads an unsigned Intel blog post. \"And given the nature of the silicon powering this technology, Intel will be able to supply it in volume without compromising the supply of new CPUs or GPUs.\u201d\n\nToday, Intel quietly discontinued the Blockscale 1000 chips, and the company told Tom\u2019s Hardware that it has no immediate plans to introduce any upgrades or replacements. The company will \"continue to support\" companies that have already purchased Blockscale chips, but it looks like the project is fading away barely a year after its original announcement.\n\nRegarding blockchain hashing operations like bitcoin mining, ASICs are better than GPUs, just as GPUs are better than CPUs. The hardware is more specialized, making it less flexible\u2014I can mine or play a game with my GPU, while an ASIC is really only good for one thing. But in exchange, it can deliver faster hash rates with lower power usage than a GPU.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Blockscale project came from Intel's \"Custom Compute Group,\" a specialized team inside Intel's Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics Group (AXG), announced by AXG manager Raja Koduri in February 2022. But by December, AXG had been split up and folded into Intel's existing client computing and data center teams, and Koduri left the company at the end of March.\n\nIntel introduced the Blockscale chips just as bitcoin's value was cratering; the value of the currency slid from nearly $46,000 in April 2022 to less than $17,000 in December, and the less the currency is worth, the harder it is to justify the hardware investment and the power use necessary to run a mining operation. The currency has ticked back up to just over $30,000 in 2023, though that's still down substantially from its $64,000 peak in late 2021.\n\nIntel told Tom's Hardware that it was discontinuing Blockscale chips partly to focus on its nascent foundry business and \"IDF 2.0\" strategy, an attempt to make more money by letting third parties use Intel's fabs. Intel and Arm announced earlier this month that companies would be able to design and manufacture Arm chips using Intel's upcoming 18A process."

        "content": "The bear market grind has not deterred a $60 million raise from a Bitcoin-only company.\n\nUnchained, a financial services provider for Bitcoin (BTC) holders, has announced a $60 million Series B funding round led by Valor Equity Partners. NYDIG, Trammell Venture Partners, Ecliptic Capital and Highland Capital Partners also participated.\n\nUnchained Capital provides a more secure way to hold fees than storing crypto on centralized exchanges or on a single key solution. The custody model leverages the Bitcoin network's native multi-signature capabilities in that clients share control of their Bitcoin between private keys they hold themselves and private keys held by Unchained or other financial services companies.\n\nMultisignature solutions eliminate single points of failure and mitigate counterparty risk by sharing it between multiple parties. Simply put, compare the multi-sig process to a safe deposit box with two keys, one held by the customer and the other by the bank.\n\nSingle points of failure were a recurring theme during the 2022 crypto collapses: From BlockFi to Celsius to Three Arrows Capital, an array of centralized solutions collapsed, taking users\u2019 funds along the way. Multisig radically reduces risk as no one party can run off with the funds.\n\nThe CEO of Unchained Capital, Joe Kelly, explained:\n\n\u201cMultisig is one of the most important technologies in the ecosystem that can be taken mainstream. It helps to protect individuals from loss and theft, two of the biggest issues for the industry.\u201d\n\nTo date, Unchained secures over $2 billion in Bitcoin across thousands of keys globally. Casa, a competitor crypto security company, recently announced it would add Ethereum (ETH) to its suite of products.\n\nRelated: 6M Bitcoin Are Secured by Shared Custody\n\nAccording to the announcement, the $60 million in funding will be used to expand the client base and product offering further. Kelly told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cUsing this fresh capital investment to expand our reach and suite of services, we hope to enable new entrants to Bitcoin to leapfrog centralized custodians into our safer collaborative custody model.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the group will hope to further the mantra \u201cnot your keys, not your coins.\u201d In light of centralized exchange collapses, greater numbers of Bitcoin and crypto enthusiasts learn to take custody of their assets, and multisig will undoubtedly play a greater role."

It mirrored Bitcoin\u2019s 90% YTD gains, maintaining a strong positive correlation with the top cryptocurrency.\n\nMSTR daily price chart featuring its daily correlation with BTC. Source: TradingView\n\nProxy Bitcoin investment boom\n\nTo recap, MicroStrategy is essentially a proxy for direct BTC investment without a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. It holds 140,000 BTC worth $4.26 billion, the most by a publicly traded company as a part of its treasury strategy.\n\nMSTR investors typically get their buying or selling cues from the same catalysts that drive Bitcoin market trends.\n\nAs a result, the stock has mirrored the BTC price uptrend so far in 2023, led by rush-to-safety trades amid the U.S. banking crisis and anticipation that the Federal Reserve would stop hiking rates.\n\nBTC/USD daily price chart.

Similarly, Fidelity purchased 97,199 MSTR shares throughout 2022, suggesting growing institutional interest in proxy Bitcoin investments.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s COIN, another stock offering indirect crypto exposure, has doubled in value this year as well.\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s core business is unhealthy\n\nMicroStrategy is essentially an enterprise software solution company and generates its revenue from software licensing and subscription services.\n\nThe firm realized a net loss of $193.7 million during Q4 2022, up from $137.5 million a year ago, led by a Bitcoin impairment loss of $197.6 million. Furthermore, its operating cash flow was $18.2 million compared to a positive cash flow of $3.2 million in the same quarter a year ago.\n\nRevenue isn't what you're making it out to be. If a lemonade stand does $100M in revenue and spends $99,999,999 to generate that revenue, then a $1.00 profit isn't all that amazing.\n\n\n\nMicrostrategy isnt far from that example. Their expense to generate that revenue leaves them with\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ZhA80tWn3J \u2014 Alby (@albyva) April 2, 2023\n\nOf course, MicroStrategy could sell its Bitcoin holdings to boost its balance sheet reserves. But the company said it would not alter its BTC buying strategy under financial stress. Instead, it employs strategies like share dilutions and debt offerings to raise capital to buy BTC.\n\n\u201cThe risk here will come from its inability to buy Bitcoin with positive cash flows in future quarters as per its strategy,\u201d said Pacifica Yield, a financial blogger at Seeking Alpha, adding:\n\n\u201cDilution to buy assets that you lose money on if Bitcoin returns to its near-term lows would not be a shareholder-friendly strategy.\u201d\n\n20% correction for MSTR stock in Q2?\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, MSTR has a high probability of a 20% price correction in Q2.\n\nRelated: MicroStrategy\u2019s Saylor fuses work email address with Bitcoin Lightning\n\nThe stock\u2019s yearly rally has landed its price near a resistance range \u2014 between $320 and $340 \u2014 notorious for capping breakout attempts.

This update may have boosted ETH\u2019s appeal compared to BTC, beating anticipations that a freshly unlocked Ether supply would increase sell pressure.\n\nStakers have withdrawn 574,700 ETH \u2014 worth about $1.21 billion \u2014 since the Shapella upgrades on April 12, according to data fetched by Nansen. Interestingly, Ether\u2019s price in U.S. dollar terms has increased by 14.25% in the same period.\n\nETH deposits vs. withdrawals. Source: Nansen\n\nIt means that many stakers have decided to hold onto their Ether rewards. On the other hand, Bitcoin has failed to log a decisive breakout above its technical resistance of $30,000, possibly making ETH a more attractive short-term bet for traders.\n\nWeak institutional inflows versus Bitcoin\n\nInstitutional investors have shown more interest in Bitcoin than Ether in the past week, according to CoinShares\u2019 weekly report.\n\nFor instance, Bitcoin-based investment vehicles witnessed $103.8 million in inflows in the week ending April 14. In comparison, Ethereum funds attracted $300,000, showing that mainstream investors may have followed the \u201csell the news\u201d strategy after the Shapella upgrades.\n\nNet flows into crypto funds.

        "content": "AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Unchained, the leader in financial services for bitcoin holders, has announced its $60 million Series B funding round led by Valor Equity Partners. The initial close, completed on April 11, included participation from existing investors NYDIG, Trammell Venture Partners, Ecliptic Capital, and Highland Capital Partners. The Series B builds further momentum following a $15 million financing led by Ten31 that was completed last fall.\n\n\u201cIn the midst of market chaos, Unchained has emerged as a highly trusted provider of bitcoin custody and financial services through superior technology, risk management, regulatory compliance, and client service,\u201d said Vivek Pattipati, a Partner at Valor who will be joining Unchained\u2019s Board of Directors. \u201cParticularly in lending, the company has differentiated itself by minimizing risk to both the lender and the borrower, leading to resilience and an extraordinary opportunity to capture market share.\"\n\nUnchained\u2019s collaborative custody model uses bitcoin\u2019s native multisignature capabilities to provide the benefits of self-custody while mitigating its risks. Clients share control of their bitcoin between private keys they hold themselves and private keys held by Unchained and other financial services companies. This not only eliminates single points of failure, through loss or theft of keys, but also mitigates counterparty risk by sharing it between multiple people and companies. The underlying causes of recent collapses at FTX or BlockFi cannot happen to Unchained\u2019s clients because the company is not able to singularly move or rehypothecate client funds and clients can verify this for themselves at any time.\n\nUnchained\u2019s collaborative custody platform secures over $2 billion in bitcoin across thousands of keys around the globe. The company has originated over $500 million in bitcoin-collateralized loans since 2017, while experiencing zero loan losses. The Unchained trading desk allows clients to buy bitcoin directly to cold storage, and its IRA offering allows clients to hold keys to their bitcoin within tax-advantaged retirement accounts \u2013 an industry first.\n\nUnchained plans to use the new funding to grow its client base and improve upon its core suite of financial services delivered through collaborative custody, as well as expand its product offerings. Unchained believes that while bitcoin continues to grow in adoption, there is a tremendous opportunity for products that bridge into the traditional dollar ecosystem around credit, trading, investment, and other financial services.\n\nToday\u2019s macroeconomic climate is such that new bitcoiners are being created every day \u2013 they just don\u2019t know it yet. Unchained is already well-known for bitcoin education and thought leadership. \u201cUsing this fresh capital investment to expand our reach and suite of services,\u201d said Unchained CEO Joe Kelly, \u201cwe hope to enable new entrants to bitcoin to leapfrog centralized custodians into our safer collaborative custody model.\u201d\n\nAbout Unchained\n\nFounded in 2016, Unchained is a top 10 bitcoin platform in the US by assets and has helped thousands of individuals and businesses truly own their wealth by holding bitcoin keys. Unchained's collaborative custody model allows clients to access financial services while continuing to have the benefits of self-custody, the ultimate consumer protection in these uncertain times. For more information on Unchained, please visit unchained.com.\n\nAbout Valor Equity Partners\n\nValor Equity Partners is an operational growth investment firm focused on investing in high-growth companies and entrepreneurs with the courage to transform their industries. For decades, Valor has served companies such as SpaceX, Tesla, Lightning Labs, and BitGo with unique expertise to solve the challenges of growth and scale.

He was sentenced to a year and a day in federal prison on Friday by a judge in New York.\n\nThe raid on Zhong's home in November 2021 resulted in the largest cryptocurrency seizure ever and the second-largest financial seizure by authorities.\n\nAnd DailyMail.com can reveal the US government is now in the process of offloading the stolen gains after a judge told the US Marshals Service to liquidate the crypto currency.\n\nJames Zhong, 32, of Gainesville, Georgia, was sentenced to a year and one day in prison last week after pleading guilty to wire fraud for the theft of $3.36billion in Bitcoin, admitting he thought the appeal of cash would help him score women\n\nIn a 2021 raid, law enforcement recovered over 50,000 Bitcoin, worth $3.36billion, including Casascius coins - or physical bitcoin - from Zhong's home\n\nThey also seized $662,600 in cash and 11 one-ounce bars of silver and gold\n\nZhong had asked for no jail time, and the Justice Department agreed on the lenient sentence for the 32-year-old due in part to his autism diagnosis, his young age, and his help recovering the billions in Bitcoin.\n\nZhong wanted the money for sex, according to charging documents prepared by assistant US attorney David Felton.\n\nHe converted $700,000 to cash so he could have a 'case full of money like in the movies', a psychological assessment filed with the federal court said.\n\n'He hoped the visual appeal of the cash would impress a female into having sexual relations with him,' Felton wrote.\n\n'He stated his plan did not work.'\n\nProsecutors said Zhong spent 'lavishly on real estate investments, luxury products, travel, hotels, nightclubs, and other expenses.'\n\nPhotos from Zhong's social media show him posing with bikini-clad girls on a yacht in a city marina and dressed in a suit with two other women in front of a stretch limousine.\n\nProperty records show he owned at least seven power boats, including a 23ft 2009 Yamaha.\n\nIn a statement filed with the court, Zhong said he 'always hated school' and was a victim of bullying, including kids pulling down his pants at a football game.\n\nHe said he found solace at home on his computer.\n\nZhong had obtained millions in cryptocurrencies while studying at the University of Georgia from 2008 to 2014. During that time he drank excessively and used cocaine.\n\nWhen cops raided his lakeside home in Gainesville, Georgia, in November 2021 they found a hard drive containing thousands of Bitcoin stashed in a Cheetos popcorn tin, wrapped in a towel.\n\nProsecutors said Zhong spent 'lavishly on real estate investments, luxury products, travel, hotels, nightclubs, and other expenses', and photos from his social media show him dressed in a suit with two other women in front of a stretch limousine\n\nWhen cops raided his lakeside home in Gainesville they found a hard drive containing thousands of Bitcoin stashed in a Cheetos popcorn tin, wrapped in a towel\n\nThe digital tokens were hidden in a 'single board computer' found inside the tin and stored in a bathroom close of Zhong's home\n\nThey also seized $662,000 in cash and 11 one-ounce bars of silver and gold.\n\nHe had stolen Bitcoin in 2012 from the infamous dark web marketplace Silk Road.\n\nDailyMail.com can reveal the government is trading the seized Bitcoin \u2013 billions of dollars of it \u2013 through a crypto exchange that it is investigating for a crime.\n\nAccording to a court filing by New York prosecutors, the first US Marshals sale of the Bitcoin was on March 14.\n\nThe government sold it on cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase \u2013 just like millions of other crypto traders, who have been characterized as 'degenerates' and basement-dwelling geeks in the past three years since digital currencies took off in popularity.\n\nThe only difference was size. The government's transaction was for 9,861 Bitcoin, sold for a total $215,738,155.\n\n'There remains approximately 41,490.72 BTC, which the Government understands is expected to be liquidated in four more batches over the course of this calendar year,' Felton wrote in a sentencing memo for Zhong filed on March 31.\n\nBut Wall Street veterans and crypto entrepreneurs may be unimpressed at the feds' trading abilities.\n\nTheir March sell-off achieved an average price of $21,878 per Bitcoin, though the official Bitcoin price on the 14th ranged from $24,052 to $26,553.90, according to figures from Coinbase \u2013 meaning the government missed out on up to $46million by selling below the market price that day.\n\nProsecutors' court filings said the government also spent $215,738.15 in transaction fees (a rate of 0.1%) to make the sale, which will have been paid to Coinbase.\n\nThe fee represents a special deal for the Marshals Service, as Coinbase's headline rate is 0.5% for its normal customers' Bitcoin trades.\n\nZhong, who has autism and was bullied as a child, said he wanted the money for sex, according to charging documents prepared by assistant US attorney David Felton\n\nZhong's house in Gainesville, Georgia, where agents conducted the raid in November 2021\n\nThe sale could also prove to be controversial, as the Marshals Service revealed it is using Coinbase to sell its Bitcoin, even while the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is preparing to sue the crypto exchange company for allegedly violating investor protection laws.\n\nLast month Coinbase said it received a 'Wells notice', warning of impending litigation by the SEC.\n\n'It's ironic that the US government recently used Coinbase to liquidate some of its bitcoin stack from Silk Road, at the same time as a different arm of the US government (the SEC) is pursuing an enforcement action against Coinbase,' Crypto and banking expert Caitlin Long told DailyMail.com.\n\nCoinbase has been involved in a slew of other law enforcement actions in the past two years.\n\nJust last year the Commission charged a manager at the company with a $1.1million insider trading scheme.\n\nIn March 2021 the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ordered Coinbase to pay a $6.5million fine for 'reckless false, misleading, or inaccurate reporting'.\n\nAnd in January 2023 Coinbase agreed to pay a $50million fine to New York regulators for letting customers open accounts with few background checks.\n\n'The US government doesn't really care, they just want to get their money,' Steven Lubka, managing director of the Bitcoin-only crypto company Swan Bitcoin, told DailyMail.com.\n\n'But it is a tacit endorsement. They are at least endorsing Coinbase instead of the competition, even if they're not explicitly saying they agree with this stuff.'\n\nThe NASDAQ-listed crypto exchange has thrown millions at lobbying the SEC, the Treasury Department which ultimately decided on the use of Coinbase to flog its seized coins, and other government departments.\n\nSenate records show Coinbase spent $7.3million on lobbying since 2015 directly and via eight lobby firms, including $6,565,000 since 2021.\n\nAccording to the sentencing memo, the fraudster had sat on up to $3.36billion of Bitcoin for 10 years \u2013 but had spent less than 5% of it\n\nLubka said he didn't think Coinbase's lobbying had been very effective.\n\n'What they really want is regulation that's good for crypto, and it's hard to look at anything and feel like they've gotten that,' he said.\n\nIn his sentencing, US District Judge Paul Gardephe noted the 'highly sophisticated nature of the crime' but granted a shorter sentence compared to a 27-33 month guideline due to the 'truly unique circumstances' of the case.\n\nThe DoJ's sentencing memo said Zhong had sat on up to $3.36billion of Bitcoin for 10 years \u2013 but had spent less than 5% of it, a relatively tiny slice totaling $16million.\n\n'I always knew what I did was wrong,' the fraudster told the judge. 'I think I buried my head in the sand\u2026 It made me feel important and worth something.'\n\nHe set up a real estate investing company with a business partner which owned two commercial properties worth a total $5.15 million, Tennessee bankruptcy filings said.\n\nZhong forfeited his 80% stake in the company as part of his plea deal.\n\nZhong stole the majority of the Bitcoin from the Silk Road dark web marketplace when he was just 22.\n\nHe created a computer program that deposited Bitcoin in a Silk Road account then submitted several withdrawal requests so quickly it bamboozled the site's system into giving him back more coins than he put in.\n\nHe used the scheme to steal approximately 50,000 BTC.\n\nThe government's recent selling of Zhong's ill-gotten gains comes amid a crypto crackdown by regulators.\n\nIn January the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fined crypto lender Nexo $45million and charged another, Genesis, with offering unregistered securities.\n\nIn February the SEC forced crypto exchange Kraken to end its popular interest-paying program, and warned Paxos it faces a potential lawsuit over its 'stablecoin' currencies pegged to the US dollar.\n\nNBA star Paul Pierce paid the commission $1.4million to settle charges he plugged a cryptocurrency without proper disclosures.\n\nThree top financial regulators, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), wrote to American banks warning of 'key risks associated with crypto-assets' \u2013 though adding that 'banking organizations are neither prohibited nor discouraged from providing banking services to customers of any specific class or type, as permitted by law or regulation.'\n\n'I've been referring to it as the crypto carpet bombing,' Kristin Smith, the executive director of the Blockchain Association, a crypto industry trade group, told the New York Times in February. 'Every couple hours we hear of some new enforcement action.'\n\nThe government's dump of almost 10,000 Bitcoin did appear to have an impact on the cryptocurrency price on March 14.\n\nBitcoin began the early hours that day at around $24,500, rising to $26,554 by 9am East Coast time. But as soon as the working day started in Washington DC, selling began and the price crashed down over 9% to $24,052 at 5pm.\n\nAccording to statistics from Bitcoinity.org, the government activity could have constituted up to 20% of the roughly 50,000 BTC traded that day.\n\nHowever, in a statement to DailyMail.com, and in contrast to federal prosecutors' filings, the Marshals Service said the sale was actually conducted over six days.\n\n'In general, the USMS no longer auctions cryptocurrency but instead liquidates via a secure online platform for buying, selling, transferring, and storing cryptocurrency,' a spokesman said, alluding to Coinbase.\n\n'In the case in question, the USMS liquidated the bitcoin over a six-day period last month using the method previously mentioned.\n\n'The USMS will not comment on the timing of future liquidations.'\n\nPublicly available transaction data showed 9,826 Bitcoin was sent from a government-controlled crypto wallet to one of Coinbase's wallets on March 7.\n\nThe sell-off was not particularly large by the standards of the wild rollercoaster crypto markets.\n\nTrading volumes reached 182,000 in one day as recently as November 9, and on March 13, 2020 more than 481,000 Bitcoin were traded in one day according to Bitcoinity.org.\n\nThe highest volume day was on January 5, 2017, when 14.1 million Bitcoin changed hands."

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Prediction, is $50,000 possible this year? Experts are backing this token over BTC for better returns in 2023 - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The world of cryptocurrencies has been unpredictable over the past few years, with prices rising and falling on a whim. Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has seen its fair share of volatility, with prices reaching an all-time high of nearly $69,000 in 2021, before dropping to under $30,000 just a few months later. But what does the future hold for Bitcoin? Is it possible for the cryptocurrency to reach $50,000 this year?\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nWhile no one can accurately predict the future price of Bitcoin, experts believe that $50,000 is a realistic target for the cryptocurrency in 2023. According to experts, the possibility of Bitcoin reaching $50,000 this year is realistic.\n\nThey predict that this price could be reached again in the middle of the year, specifically at the end of the second quarter or the beginning of the third quarter of 2023. Even if there were another market crash, a spike to that level could still be possible during the summer.\n\nThis prediction is based on several factors, including the increasing mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, the growing number of institutional investors entering the market, and the limited supply of Bitcoin.\n\nOne of the key drivers of Bitcoin\u2019s price is its scarcity. The cryptocurrency has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, with around 19.3 million already in circulation. This limited supply has made Bitcoin a popular store of value, with investors looking to buy and hold the cryptocurrency as a long-term investment.\n\nAnother factor that could increase Bitcoin\u2019s price is the increasing mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. In recent years, we have seen a growing number of companies and financial institutions embracing cryptocurrencies, with some even accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment. This increased adoption could lead to a surge in demand for Bitcoin, which could, in turn, drive up its price.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset, and its price can fluctuate dramatically in a short time. While $50,000 may be a realistic target for Bitcoin in 2023, there is no guarantee that the cryptocurrency will reach this level.\n\nBacking a Token Over Bitcoin\n\nWhile Bitcoin has traditionally been the go-to cryptocurrency for investors, there are now several other tokens that are starting to gain traction. One such token is RenQ Finance (RENQ), which has been tipped by experts as a potentially better investment option than Bitcoin in 2023.\n\nRenQ Finance is a DeFi token that has been gaining traction due to its innovative features and strong community support. The project aims to establish a cross-chain asset exchange network, connecting all isolated blockchains and providing all necessary underlying support for the DeFi ecosystem. This unique approach has led to much interest in the project, with some of the top investors and big whales of other cryptocurrencies also investing in RenQ Finance.\n\nThe success of RenQ Finance is evident in its ongoing presale, which has already raised $10.6 million in the fastest time ever recorded for a presale. This achievement has been backed by industry experts, who have recognized the potential of the project.\n\nWhile Bitcoin may be the more well-known cryptocurrency, RenQ Finance has the potential to provide better returns in 2023. The project\u2019s innovative features and strong community support make it a potentially safer investment option, particularly for those looking to diversify their portfolio.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe future of Bitcoin is uncertain, with its price likely to continue fluctuating in the coming months and years. While $50,000 may be a realistic target for Bitcoin in 2023, investors should consider diversifying their portfolio and looking at other potentially profitable investment options.\n\nRenQ Finance is a DeFi token that has been gaining traction due to its innovative features and strong community support. The project\u2019s ongoing presale success and backing by industry experts make it a potentially better investment option than Bitcoin in 2023. However, as with any investment, it\u2019s important to do your research and consider the risks involved before investing in any cryptocurrency.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nWebsite: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Australia, the country that hosts the third-largest network of Bitcoin (BTC) ATMs, surpassed the continent of Asia in terms of the total number of crypto ATMs installed.\n\nSince the beginning of 2023, Australia has been on a crypto ATM installation spree, climbing from fifth to third in January alone. Data from Coin ATM Radar confirms that the country has kept up the effort to install avenues for fiat-to-crypto conversions.\n\nCrypto ATM distribution by countries and continents. Source: Coin ATM Radar\n\nOver the last eight months, Australia consistently added Bitcoin ATMs, unlike leading European nations and the United States, which reported a reduction in ATM installations during that timeline.\n\nAsia, which includes major economies such as China, Japan, Singapore and India, hosts 355 crypto machines, representing 1% of the total crypto ATMs installed worldwide. After months of additions, Australia recorded 364 crypto ATMs.\n\nMonthly crypto ATM installations in Australia. Source: Coin ATM Radar\n\nContradicting Australia\u2019s crypto ATM growth, the total crypto ATMs installed worldwide showed a consistent decline. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, in the first two months of 2023, the net cryptocurrency ATMs installed globally reduced by 412 machines.\n\nRelated: Australian crypto scams increased by over 162% with nearly $150M lost\n\nComplementing the country\u2019s massive increase in crypto ATMs, leaked internal documents from Australia\u2019s Department of the Treasury revealed crypto legislation is on the horizon.\n\nAs reported by Cointelegraph, the Australian government plans to release consultation papers in the second quarter of 2023. The move seems plausible as the treasury had officially released a token mapping consultation paper, forming the basis of upcoming crypto regulations.\n\nConsultation open!

        "title": "Did Any Coloradans Pay Their State Income Taxes in Crypto? - 5280 - 5280 | The Denver Magazine",
        "content": "This year\u2019s Tax Day isn\u2019t just the deadline for individuals to submit income tax returns and their associated payments. It also marks the closing of a unique tax season in Colorado history: the first in which the state accepted digital assets.\n\nLast September, Governor Jared Polis kicked things off when he announced that, effective immediately, Colorado would begin accepting cryptocurrencies as payments for a number of different taxes, most notably state income taxes. The move wasn\u2019t entirely surprising for Polis, who has been a noted fan of blockchain technology since before he became Colorado\u2019s governor and who has since made multiple appearances at ETHDenver, the annual crypto conference that\u2019s hosted in the Mile High City.\n\nWhat is surprising is just how few Coloradans actually did it: As of April 14, only 11 people paid their state income taxes using crypto, according to the Colorado Department of Revenue. Of the roughly 3.1 million individual tax returns Colorado can expect to receive this year, that represents just 0.00035 percent. To put that return rate into context, a person faces roughly the same odds of getting struck by lightning in a year as the state of Colorado had in receiving a tax payment in crypto.\n\nBut Daniel Carr, communications director at the Department of Revenue, says the state isn\u2019t losing sleep over the low rate of crypto participation. \u201c[It\u2019s] just another option for our taxpayers,\u201d he wrote 5280 in an emailed statement. \u201cWe like to promote a culture of voluntary compliance, and the more options you give people, the better and easier it is for them to do their civic duty. We don\u2019t really see a downside as there is no ongoing cost or risk to the Department of Revenue.\u201d\n\nColorado uses PayPal to handle all cryptocurrency payments from taxpayers, which converts users\u2019 crypto into U.S. dollars before it hits the state treasury. Hence, Carr says, no risk to the state.\n\nBut according to a couple of experts in Colorado\u2019s cryptocurrency community, PayPal is the problem\u2014and it\u2019s why hardly anyone paid their taxes in crypto this tax season.\n\n\u201cMost people I know won\u2019t use PayPal,\u201d says John Paller, founder of ETHDenver. \u201cCrypto is supposed to decentralize our commercial activities, not replicate old systems with new payment assets. The fact that there are additional steps doesn\u2019t make any sense, and we have provided this feedback to Governor Polis.\u201d\n\nThe extra steps that Paller is referring to stem from the fact that PayPal introduces fees and requires additional actions on the part of taxpayers. To start, PayPal adds a surcharge of between 1.5 and 1.8 percent on top of all crypto payments, so there\u2019s an additional expense. Crypto users must also take the step to either buy crypto on PayPal or transfer assets into PayPal from other digital wallets (and transfers have fees, too). And crypto enthusiasts say that perhaps the most significant issue with PayPal is that the platform only accepts four kinds of currencies\u2014Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Ethereum\u2014and all of those have values that fluctuate wildly with the market.\n\nBitcoin, for example, was valued at around $20,000 last September when Polis announced the crypto tax option, but is currently hovering around $30,000. That means that, if it was used to pay, say, a $1,000 state tax, the taxpayer would need roughly 0.033 Bitcoin today. But if you tried to pay that same $1,000 state tax last September when Bitcoin was valued a third lower? You would have needed 0.05 Bitcoin.\n\nTom Koceja, a Greenwood Village\u2013based accountant who specializes in crypto taxes, says most of his clients prefer to pay for services (including paying him) using a different kind of cryptocurrency called stablecoins, many of which mimic the U.S. dollar and are pegged to $1 each. The other class of fluctuating cryptocurrencies, like the four that PayPal accepts, necessitate a gain or loss calculation because PayPal essentially sells the asset when users make a payment, Koceja says.\n\nIn other words, there could be an additional capital gains tax. If the crypto asset has appreciated in value since the time a user originally bought it\u2014say, Bitcoin that\u2019s gone from $20,000 to $30,000\u2014that filer is subject to capital gains tax when PayPal sells the asset during a payment transaction. \u201cAnd most people aren\u2019t going to pay in [a currency] that creates another tax obligation for them,\u201d Koceja says.\n\nAnd if an asset has depreciated? A person might also be reluctant to sell it at a loss (which, following a down year for crypto last year, could explain why so few Coloradans paid their state taxes in crypto).\n\nLike Paller of ETHDenver, Koceja says the state\u2019s system needs improvement in order to increase participation among crypto users. \u201cIt\u2019s convoluted,\u201d he says of the current option. But of the future, the accountant says, \u201cI think it\u2019s cool that the Department of Revenue did this. To see them start this is neat.\u201d\n\nWith some changes, he adds, he thinks Colorado will see more crypto users pay their taxes in blockchain assets. \u201cI think with payment in stablecoins, more marketing around it, and maybe a wallet address [operated by the state] where people could directly send their crypto, we\u2019re not that far off,\u201d he says. And pretty soon, Koceja says it won\u2019t just be Colorado that we\u2019re sending stablecoins to to pay for things like income taxes. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see this kind of thing all over the place, and it\u2019ll be preferable,\u201d he promises."

        "title": "Postage Prices Just Went Up Again. Here's How Much Stamps Cost Now - CNET",
        "content": "What's happening The price of first-class stamps, packages and other services went up on Jan. 22. Why it matters The rate hike is due partly to the US Postal Service's massive debt: The agency has an annual budget deficit of $10 billion.\n\nThe US Postal Service raised the price of stamps on Sunday, with a first-class stamp going from 60 to 63 cents.\n\nPrices for international mail and metered letters also rose, as did fees for post office boxes, money orders and other special services.\n\nStamps just rose to 60 cents in July 2022, up from 58 cents. The National Postal Policy Council, a trade association for corporations that use stamped mail, called the back-to-back increases \"unwelcome burdens.\"\n\nBut the Postal Service says the new rates are still \"competitive.\"\n\n\"Prices of the US Postal Service remain among the most affordable in the world,\" the agency said in a statement in October.\n\nHere's what you need to know about stamp prices, including what the new rates are and what you can do to delay paying more.\n\nRead more: What's the Cheapest Way to Ship: UPS, FedEx or US Postal Service?\n\nHow much is the price of stamps going up?\n\nThe cost of first-class mail went up about 4.2% on average. First-class stamps increased from 60 cents to 63 cents, while international letters and postcards jumped from $1.40 to $1.45.\n\nProduct Previous price Current price Letters (1 ounce) 60 cents 63 cents Letters (metered 1 ounce) 57 cents 60 cents Domestic postcards 44 cents 48 cents International postcards $1.40 $1.45 International letter (1 ounce) $1.40 $1.45\n\n\n\nYou can buy stamps at online retailers like Amazon or directly at the US Postal Service website.\n\nDid shipping rates increase, too?\n\nThe US Postal Service increased the cost of sending packages via Priority Mail by about 5.5%. Priority Mail Express became 6.6% more expensive, First Class Package Service prices were bumped up by 7.8% and Priority Mail commercial rates increased by about 3.6%.\n\nThe new rates are still \"well below the rate of inflation,\" the Postal Service said in a statement.\n\nThere was no price increase for Parcel Select Ground or USPS Connect Local, which allows businesses to offer same-day and next-day delivery for local customers.\n\nMore detailed pricing information can be found on the Postal Service's Postal Explorer website.\n\nDomestic Priority Mail Flat Rate changes Product Previous New Small flat-rate box $10.40 $10.20 Medium flat-rate box $17.05 $17.10 Large flat-rate box $22.45 $22.80 APO/FPO large flat-rate box $20.95 $21.20 Regular flat-rate envelope $9.90 $9.65 Legal flat-rate envelope $10.20 $9.95 Padded flat-rate envelope $10.60 $10.40\n\nWill the post office raise prices again?\n\nIt's definitely possible. The rate hikes are part of Postmaster General Louis DeJoy's 10-year Delivering for America plan, intended to chip away at the Postal Service's mammoth debt.\n\nThe agency has an annual budget deficit of $10 billion and, at the end of fiscal year 2020, was carrying $188 billion in debts and unfunded liabilities, the Government Accountability Office reported -- mostly from underfunding of workers' pensions and retiree health care benefits.\n\nThe Postal Service generally receives no tax dollars for operating expenses, relying on the sale of postage, products and services to fund its operations.\n\nDeJoy's plans include increasing postage rates, lengthening delivery times and reducing post office hours. In October 2021, the Postal Service started lengthening delivery times for about a third of its volume, meaning that letters, parcels and magazines that took two or three days can now take up to five to arrive.\n\nThe nonprofit NPCC urged the Postal Regulatory Commission to consider whether it could discourage the Postal Service from filing multiple rate changes in a 12-month period. The Commission countered that \"nothing in the statute or regulations dictates the frequency of price adjustments or the timing of when they are to occur.\"\n\nIt encouraged the Postal Service to set a schedule for price adjustments \"that minimizes costs and disruptions.\""

        "content": "We are currently experiencing market conditions we have not seen since we first started to come out of the pandemic. 2023 has truly been a blessing for the market after it experienced one of its worst periods ever at the back end of 2022.\n\nThe new year began with a bull run and it has been a case of start as you mean to go on for the market as a whole. Sure there have been some blips along the way but generally things have been pointing upward. The emergence of presales as successful as Love Hate Inu (LHINU) and the recovery of traditional giants Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) shows how the growth is really market-wide and indicates this is not a flash in the pan thing and should continue through Q2 and beyond.\n\nThere was a lot of caution preached after the first bull run of the year that it likely wasn\u2019t sustainable and even as Bitcoin and Ethereum continued to grow after the run on traditional banks some experts were still saying the growth would slow due to interest rate hikes. Well, that hasn\u2019t been the case and even though news coming from the feds suggests rates will still not be slashed by Q3 there is still positive buzz around the market.\n\n>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now!<<<\n\nWhy BTC and ETH will not stop pumping\n\nNow even the most skeptical of analysts are starting to change their tone. There has been too much growth market-wide to dismiss it as anything other than real. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are the market\u2019s two biggest currencies so their price movement tends to be mirrored by the market as a whole. It is their continued positive movement that has won over the doubters.\n\nIn the chart above we can see Bitcoin\u2019s growth over the last 3 months. This is the reason many believe it can return to the heights of 2021 and finally break $60,000 again. It has already seen growth of over 55% since the start of the year and that\u2019s even after the disappointment of interest not being slashed as they were predicted to be at the start of the year.\n\nSo imagine what will happen to the price once these rates finally slow and are cut? The price will likely go through the roof! This is on top of the news that has been consistently flowing in from around the world about countries softening their views of Bitcoin and many taking steps toward hiring regulators so as to introduce it to their markets in the future.\n\nWhen we take all the above into consideration and the fact that eventually, inflation rates will have to stop, we think $60,000 might even be a modest marker for Bitcoin in the next few years.\n\n>>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now!<<<\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum has been experiencing growth due to events happening within the ecosystem. On April 12th the long-awaited Shanghai upgrade took place. This was the first time ETH holders could finally withdraw the native currency and any rewards they had incurred.\n\nSome experts feared this would plummet the price of ETH due to a mass withdrawal of funds but it looks like it has mostly been the rewards that have been withdrawn. This of course strengthens Ethereum\u2019s position as clearly, their holders believe in the project long-term.\n\nJust looking at the chart above we can see nearly 75% growth in just the last 3 months alone. Just like with Bitcoin, the $6k barrier actually feels like it will be broken by Ethereum a lot sooner than many would have thought a little while ago.\n\nWhile these traditional giants look set to continue to pump the presale of Love Hate Inu (LHINU) is gathering a similar amount of attention, let\u2019s see why!\n\n>>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now!<<<\n\nLove Hate Inu- Meme coin set to break $2 once launched\n\nIt is nearly unheard of that a presale coin would be in the news as much as coins like Ethereum and Bitcoin, but Love Hate Inu (LHINU) is no ordinary coin and it represents the most exciting project on the market right now.\n\n>>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now!<<<\n\nThe presale is still not even two months old and already it has raised over $4.5 million. Why is this the best investment opportunity right now? Well, firstly it\u2019s the very first meme coin/V2E platform meaning it will have the virality of a meme coin and the utility of a staking coin. We think that once launched it will easily pump to $2 and beyond.\n\nOne look at the site now and you will see why experts and influencers can\u2019t dedicate enough words to this crypto. For example, it is showing its future users the kind of polls they will be able to vote on, they have a \u2018do you love or hate celebrity x\u2019 poll currently to view. Each celebrity is represented by a hilarious angel and devil meme version of themselves.\n\n>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now!<<<\n\nThis of course will draw in the influencers but the experts have been drawn in by the very comprehensive white paper. Love Hate Inu is really thinking about the future and security of their project. 90 percent of the total coin allocation will be sold at presale to prevent a dodgy rug pull from happening once the coin goes to its CEX listings, this also ensures only the real LHINU lovers will have a say in any future company decisions.\n\n>>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now!<<<\n\nIf you weren\u2019t sold on Love Hate Inu being the best investment opportunity on the market they also put their user\u2019s experience to the forefront. A stake-2-vote system will be implemented that requires users to stake LHINU for 30 days before they can vote. This in turn ensures a voter\u2019s anonymity which will also be useful in the discussion platform that will be available under polls.\n\nThe more you stake the more control you will have over these polls. Also, in the future, users will be able to suggest and run their own polls. This is to harvest a community vibe and the users will need to put forward their own LHINU to run the poll. There can then be a lively discussion about what polls should go on the site, giving a lot of the power to the users.\n\nThe price of LHINU once launched will be $0.000145 so predicting a growth spurt to $2 is ambitious. However, the market has not seen a meem coin with its capabilities before so we think it will blow the competition out of the market and soar past $2 in the future.\n\n>>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now!<<<\n\nConclusion\n\nIt seems to be good news all around for the crypto market, we have incredibly successful presales like Love Hate Inu ongoing, and traditional giants Bitcoin and Ethereum look set to reach previous highs. Of all 3 Love Hate Inu is by far the best investment opportunity, its room to grow is far bigger than the other two and it can be bought at a rock bottom price meaning investors can stockpile it before it pumps.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Love Hate Inu Expected to Rise to $10 Million as BTC Surges\n\nBitcoin (BTC) continues its journey on a slightly choppy rally after Bitcoin recently crossed the $25k mark.

As a meme coin, it separates itself from the rest of the pack by providing a unique platform for expressing opinions.\n\nIn an age where people are increasingly being censored on social media and other outlets, a project like Love Hate Inu aims to use decentralisation to get rid of the overwhelming control that censors have nowadays.\n\nLove Hate Inu holds several polls where users can express their opinions on numerous topics such as politics, entertainment and other social issues without the fear of being censored. The voting system is built using blockchain technology, which makes the whole process, transparent, fair and secure.\n\nWhen it comes to the platform, it is a well-designed meme poll creator with several fun elements added to the mix.

        "content": "While many investors and enthusiasts have been asking, \"Is crypto dead?\", much of the focus is on the role of regulatory measures in the United States. In fact, billionaire tech investor Chamath Palihapitiya claims that \"crypto is dead in America\" due to strict regulations imposed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nSEC Chairman Gary Gensler has been quite vocal about his concerns over the crypto industry. He believes that crypto trading platforms should adhere to strict U.S. securities laws, emphasizing the need for stringent regulatory measures. Palihapitiya critiqued Gensler's stance, saying, \"The United States authorities have firmly pointed their guns at crypto,\" attributing this aggressive approach to the perceived threat that cryptocurrencies pose to the traditional financial establishment.\n\nThat said, Palihapitiya also acknowledges that some blame lies with the crypto sector, stating, \"In fairness to the regulators, [the crypto sector] did push the boundaries more than any other sector of the startup economy.\" As a result, good actors in the industry are now \"paying the price\" for the actions of those who pushed the boundaries.\n\nThe impact of U.S. regulations on cryptocurrencies can be seen in the growing list of enforcement actions taken against various crypto firms. For example, the SEC has issued warnings to Coinbase and charged the crypto trading platform Bittrex and its ex-CEO with operating an unregistered exchange. These actions, along with the proposed rules changing the way crypto firms can custody customer assets, have caused significant uncertainty in the industry.\n\nOn the other hand, critics argue that these stringent regulations are driving innovation overseas and endangering American competitiveness. With influential figures like Chamath Palihapitiya raising concerns over the future of cryptocurrencies in the U.S., it's clear that the regulatory landscape will have a significant impact on whether or not crypto can recover.\n\nIt's important to note that despite the current challenges, the possibility of crypto recovering and achieving new heights cannot be ruled out. As the regulatory environment evolves and becomes more accommodating, the potential for a resurgence in the crypto market remains ever-present. Until then, investors and enthusiasts alike continue to ponder the question: \"Is crypto dead?\""

        "title": "Doctors should embrace bitcoin, says cancer surgeon - The Australian Financial Review",
        "content": "The price of the divisive digital asset has surged 80 per cent this year and was traded at $US29,410 on Tuesday morning, thumping the returns of other asset classes. Over the past five years, it has returned 255.8 per cent as an eclectic mix of professionals, tradies, speculators, mum-and-dad investors, libertarians, and nihilists embrace the mania.\n\nDr Sammour first bought \u201ca few bitcoin in 2015\u201d and has actively bought more since then, but he declined to specifically recommend that healthcare professionals invest in the cryptocurrency.\n\nAlternative option\n\n\u201cMost surgeons will spend their money on more houses or shares,\u201d he said. \u201cThe system teaches them to speculate and I think it\u2019s destructive as it raises house prices for people that don\u2019t have lots of money. Bitcoin might be an alternative option to store wealth without the deleterious societal consequences.\u201d\n\nAustralian doctors are considered to be among the most engaged investors among non-financial professions. According to Australian Taxation Office data, surgeons are Australia\u2019s most prolific real estate speculators, with at least 43 per cent owning an investment property.\n\nDr Sammour said bitcoin should appeal to doctors, given they are being hit with a slew of rising professional costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe British-born bitcoin apostle said US Bureau of Labour Statistics data backed his claim that the average cost of US hospital services had soared 10 per cent per year since 2000 because scarce assets such as hospital beds or luxury properties rose in price faster than assets that were easy to mass-produce such as televisions.\n\nAs a consequence, he said Royal Adelaide Hospital now offered fewer beds per head of population than at any time in history.\n\n\u201cA 2 to 3 per cent increase in [government] funding per year is unlikely to keep up with the cost of delivering the service. That\u2019s why hospital beds are going down, elective surgery lists are getting longer, and ambulance ramping is increasing even though we spend more.\n\n\u201cMedicare and the healthcare system need more funding because the current model is not keeping pace with healthcare inflation or the price of healthcare,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you see how far house prices go up compared to CPI, you can imagine a hospital bed is more expensive than an apartment bed because it requires a lot of additional resources to staff. If an apartment bed goes up a certain amount per year, you can expect a hospital bed to go up even faster because they\u2019re harder to make.\u201d\n\nTo back up his argument, Dr Sammour said the construction cost of the Royal Adelaide Hospital blew out to $2.4 billion, making it the third most expensive building in history at the time, ahead of more famous global landmarks including the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, London\u2019s The Shard and the Taipei 101 building.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe hospital, which spans three city blocks, provides 800 beds to a South Australian catchment area of 1.6 million people at a ratio of one bed to 2000 people.\n\nThis compares with the prior Royal Adelaide Hospital, which was completed in 1967 at the cost of $100 million, and provided 900 beds for a population of 600,000 on a ratio of 1 bed to 800 people.\n\nGoing back to 1877, the city\u2019s hospital cost \u00a350,000 and provided 200 beds for a population of 100,000 on a ratio of 1 bed to 500 people, Dr Sammour said.\n\nThe bitcoin evangelist said central banks\u2019 loose monetary policies had resulted in a misallocation of resources, which rewarded financiers, bankers and asset managers close to the funding source, but harmed unionised healthcare professionals.\n\nThe cryptocurrency\u2019s emergence as a new asset class remains controversial because of its huge energy usage, relatively slow processing times, and claims that it relies on the greater fool theory to attract new buyers as early promoters sell out."

These chips, which were specifically created for mining purposes, were introduced to the market around a year ago. Moreover, the company's final product shipment is scheduled to take place no later than April 20, 2024.\n\nIntel has announced that it will stop taking orders for its Blockscale series by October 20 of this year, with shipping expected to end by April 20 of next year.\n\n\"As we prioritise our investments in IDM 2.0, we have end-of-life the Intel Blockscale 1000 Series ASIC while we continue to support our Blockscale customers,\" a company spokesperson said, reported by Tom\u2019s Hardware.\n\nIntel's latest move, IDM 2.0, involves the outsourcing of its chip-making to external customers, while simultaneously increasing its production of smaller and faster chips.\n\nIntel's foray into the world of crypto mining chips began with the Bonanza Mine codename for its R&D chips, which never made it to the commercial market. However, the tech firm later cleared its intentions to enter the blockchain market and subsequently unveiled a second-generation model called 'Blockscale'. This new offering was made available exclusively to a select group of large-scale mining companies, including BLOCK, GRIID Infrastructure, and Argo Blockchain, among others.\n\nAccording to the report, several major industrial mining companies have secured significant long-term contracts for a reliable supply of Blockscale ASICs. This move is seen as a strategic measure to avoid the volatility associated with Chinese manufacturers who have been known to engage in pricing manipulations based on Bitcoin valuations. These manufacturers have also been subject to tariffs, supply disruptions, and shortages, which have resulted in increased logistics and shipping costs from China.\n\nHowever, Intel remains optimistic about the cryptocurrency industry and said, they will continue to \u201cmonitor market opportunities in the cryptocurrency space.\u201d\n\nThe recent cryptocurrency market downturn has harmed several chip companies, including Nvidia Corp, and the decision to discontinue mining operations from Intel is a direct response to that.\n\nLeading cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, are transitioning towards a Proof of Stake (POS) mechanism, which discourages mining. In addition to a significant shift in point-of-sale technology, the cryptocurrency markets are currently grappling with a high degree of uncertainty, with many digital currencies hitting their lowest values in the previous year."

        "content": "SINGAPORE \u2013 Bitcoin appears to be back in favour with investors after the popular cryptocurrency pushed past US$30,000 last week \u2013 the first time it has hit that level since June 10, 2022.\n\nThe largest digital currency by market capitalisation has risen by more than 70 per cent since January, outstripping an 8 per cent climb in global stocks, noted Bloomberg.\n\nThere has been a marked turnaround after a series of high-profile bankruptcies in the sector sent Bitcoin\u2019s price tumbling from a peak of around US$68,000 in November 2021 to just over US$15,000 in November 2022.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rebound also follows 2023\u2019s failure of Swiss bank Credit Suisse and three United States banks, two that did business extensively with the crypto sector.\n\nThe events have revived the case for crypto as an alternative, decentralised banking system unhampered by financial intermediaries like banks. They are also testing the US Federal Reserve\u2019s resolve to keep interest rates high.\n\nThe Fed started hiking rates to tame inflation in 2022, a move that triggered an outflow of cash from risky assets like crypto, but has since hurt parts of the economy.\n\nAny U-turn could once again raise crypto\u2019s appeal as an alternative investment class.\n\nDBS chief economist Taimur Baig said: \u201cWe associate this year\u2019s rebound in cryptocurrencies with expectations of a peak in the global monetary policy cycle and as an expression of risk diversification by investors.\u201d\n\nInterest in crypto investing remains high in Singapore despite a general lack of understanding about the sector, said consultancy CT Group.\n\nIts online poll of 1,057 Singaporeans in March showed that about 60 per cent are likely to buy crypto in the next few years, believing it can help them get ahead. But nearly 50 per cent said they were not confident in explaining what crypto is to others, revealing a poor understanding of the product.\n\nIf crypto is on your radar, here\u2019s what to know before hopping on board."

        "title": "Investing in crypto ETFs // The Motley Fool Australia - The Motley Fool Australia",
        "content": "Love it or hate it, cryptocurrency is becoming more mainstream. Crypto ETFs are one option to investigate if you want to add some crypto exposure to your investment portfolio.\n\nWhat are crypto ETFs?\n\nThey are a type of exchange-traded fund (ETF) that invests in cryptocurrencies or companies operating in the crypto sector. Funds that invest directly in cryptocurrencies may invest exclusively in just one token (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) or buy a basket of digital tokens instead.\n\nCrypto ETFs can provide investors a low-cost way to gain exposure to cryptos and the crypto industry. And outsourcing investment decision-making to a fund manager massively reduces the time investors need to devote to researching cryptos.\n\nThis gives ETFs a clear advantage over direct crypto investment, especially considering how opaque and volatile the crypto space can be.\n\nBut this doesn't mean crypto ETFs don't also come with some significant risks that you need to be aware of. So, before getting on with our discussion of ASX crypto ETFs, let's cover off some basics.\n\nSo, what exactly are cryptocurrencies?\n\nCryptocurrencies are a type of digital asset. Unlike fiat currencies (such as the Australian or United States dollars), central banks do not issue cryptos. Instead, they are created via blockchain technology through a process called mining. You can check out our article on cryptocurrencies if you want to get into the weeds of blockchain technology.\n\nOnce created, we can trade cryptos just like other assets. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency created, and it remains the most valuable. As people have found more applications for blockchain technology, the number of different cryptos has rapidly increased. However, after peaking at more than 10,000 listed cryptocurrencies in February 2022, that number had fallen to around 8600 by February 2023.1\n\nAnd how about ETFs?\n\nETFs are a type of investment vehicle similar to a mutual fund. However, unlike a mutual fund, an ETF trades on the stock market just like ordinary shares.\n\nETF managers pool together money from many investors and then use that money to make investments according to a particular fund mandate or strategy. Many ETFs are passively managed funds. They might replicate the returns of an index, such as the S&P/ASX 200 (ASX: XJO), a market sector (like tech or healthcare), or even a commodity (gold or oil).\n\nHow to invest in ETFs in Australia\n\nPlenty of ETFs trade on the Australian Securities Exchange, pursuing different investment strategies. They provide a low-cost way to diversify your investments across multiple shares and asset classes.\n\nYou can invest in a portfolio of international technology shares, high-dividend ASX stocks, or even a basket of different commodities in a single trade.\n\nThe best thing about ETFs is you can buy and sell units in the fund just as you would ordinary shares. Simply lodge a trade with your preferred broker.\n\nInvesting in international funds\n\nThere are two ways to gain international exposure through ETF investing. One is to buy units in an ETF trading on the ASX that already invests in international shares. For example, the iShares Global 100 ETF AUD (ASX: IOO) offers exposure to the world's top 100 companies, ranked by market capitalisation.\n\nThe second way is to invest directly in ETFs that trade on overseas stock exchanges. More and more brokers (particularly new digital broker start-ups like Stake) allow you to invest in overseas stock markets at relatively low costs. This offers up a whole new universe of ETFs to invest in \u2013 many of which pursue different investment strategies to those listed on the ASX.\n\nExtra choice is particularly attractive for investors seeking crypto exposure, given the limited range of Australian crypto ETFs.\n\nThe easiest overseas share markets for Australians to invest in are usually those located in the United States. Thousands of ETFs are trading on US equities markets like the NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchange, many of which provide crypto exposure.\n\nFor example, the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NASDAQ: BTF) aims to track the price of Bitcoin by investing in Bitcoin futures contracts.\n\nWhy invest in crypto ETFs?\n\nMany cryptocurrencies have a finite supply written into their digital code. Some, like Bitcoin, become increasingly difficult to mine over time until, eventually, their supply will run out.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts argue that this inbuilt scarcity gives crypto an inherent value, much like precious metals. In fact, Bitcoin's greatest supporters believe the token could one day become a new 'digital gold' \u2013 a safe haven asset that investors can turn to as a store of value in troubled economic times.\n\nSome investors are also just naturally drawn to the libertarian ideals of crypto. Unlike fiat currencies, central banks can't control the supply of cryptocurrencies. They exist beyond the reach of government regulations and traditional monetary policy. This can make crypto pretty alluring to those with a rebellious spirit.\n\nCrypto's anti-establishment streak comes from the underlying blockchain technology. Blockchain's decentralised structure has the potential to utterly transform many industries \u2013 particularly banking and financial services \u2013 by removing the need for trusted intermediaries. Investing in crypto is the best way to gain exposure to this potentially revolutionary tech.\n\nAs we've already mentioned, a cryptocurrency ETF can be a low-hassle, low-cost way to gain exposure to the crypto industry. Many crypto ETFs provide broad exposure to cryptocurrencies and companies involved in the crypto space. Accessing this sort of diversification cheaply also reduces some risks in investing in crypto.\n\nTop options\n\nThe only option currently available to Australian investors who want to invest in crypto ETFs on the ASX is the BetaShares Crypto Innovators ETF (ASX: CRYP), which invests in companies operating in the crypto space rather than cryptocurrencies themselves.\n\nYou will have to look overseas if you want an ETF that tracks the prices of actual cryptocurrencies. There are a few funds trading on stock exchanges in the US that offer more direct exposure to cryptos themselves.\n\nName Description Betashares Crypto Innovators ETF\n\n\n\n(ASX: CRYP) The only crypto fund currently listed on the ASX ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF\n\n\n\n(NYSEARCA: BITO) The world's biggest crypto ETF, investing in Bitcoin futures contracts Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Units\n\n\n\n(OTC: BITW) A fund tracking an index of the 10 largest cryptocurrencies\n\n\n\nby market capitalisation\n\nBetaShares Crypto Innovators\n\nThe BetaShares Crypto Innovators fund invests in the companies that build crypto mining equipment, like high-powered computer hardware, as well as other companies that support the crypto industry. The fund is well diversified, with holdings in up to 50 crypto companies.\n\nThe fund is currently the best and only option for ASX investors seeking crypto exposure. Its largest holdings include Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: MARA) and Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: RIOT), crypto mining companies, and Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ: COIN), the operator of one of the most popular crypto trading platforms.\n\nProShares Bitcoin Strategy\n\nWith well over US$500 million in net assets, ProShares Bitcoin Strategy claims to be the world's largest and most actively traded Bitcoin ETF. However, it doesn't invest directly in cryptocurrency. Instead, the fund uses futures contracts to try and replicate the price performance of Bitcoin.\n\nIt is still a good option for investors seeking Bitcoin exposure. The fund has actually managed to track the price of Bitcoin quite closely since its inception back in October 2021. Unfortunately, the price of Bitcoin has declined by more than 60% in that timeframe.\n\nBitwise 10 Crypto Index Units\n\nThe Bitwise fund tracks an index of the 10 largest cryptocurrencies, as measured by their market capitalisations. Units in the fund can be bought and sold over the counter in the US.\n\nAs the values of cryptocurrencies can fluctuate rapidly, the fund is rebalanced monthly. This active management comes at a substantial cost, with annual fees totalling 2.5%, or $25 for every $1,000 invested. This can quickly eat into your potential returns.\n\nEven so, Bitwise is probably the best crypto ETF for investors seeking exposure to the crypto market. Roughly 60% of the fund's holdings are in Bitcoin, 30% are in Ethereum, and the remaining 10% are split between other altcoins.\n\nPros and cons of investing in crypto ETFs\n\nWe have already discussed some of the benefits of investing in crypto.\n\nCrypto acolytes claim that the scarcity of some digital tokens gives them an inherent value. If this proves true, it could make some cryptocurrencies \u2013 particularly Bitcoin \u2013 viable alternatives to traditional safe-haven assets. It may even make crypto an inflation hedge.\n\nThe blockchain technology that makes crypto possible also has the potential to revolutionise many industries. Companies continue to experiment with blockchains and are continually coming up with new and exciting applications for the technology. Of course, not all of these ventures will succeed, but those that do could become genuine game changers.\n\nInvestors should always approach crypto investments cautiously. The crypto markets are volatile and incredibly risky. Just last year, FTX \u2013 at the time the world's largest crypto exchange \u2013 collapsed amid allegations of fraud. And that's just one of many frauds and thefts that have plagued the crypto industry in its short history.\n\nThis is enough to turn some investors off crypto for good. In fact, crypto's greatest detractors will tell you it's all a giant Ponzi scheme. That sooner or later, the world will realise that the emperor has no clothes and these digital tokens are worthless.\n\nGiven the risks, do plenty of research before investing in crypto, even through a large, diversified ETF. And never invest any money you can't afford to lose.\n\nHow have global events impacted crypto markets?\n\nThe collapse of the FTX exchange rattled crypto markets, with billions wiped off the market caps of some of the leading cryptocurrencies. However, markets had already been in decline before the FTX debacle.\n\nRunaway inflation, rising interest rates, and fears of a recession caused investors to dump riskier assets. Bitcoin has yet to live up to its promise as a digital alternative to gold and other safe-haven assets.\n\nMarkets have stabilised more recently, but the damage to the crypto industry from the collapse of FTX could be long-lasting. It reminded investors of the risks of putting money into an unregulated industry.\n\nAre crypto ETFs right for you?\n\nCrypto ETFs can be an easy, low-cost way for everyday investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies and the crypto industry. This may particularly suit a growth investor with a fondness for tech shares, as it can provide exposure to companies building new blockchain applications.\n\nAlthough the potential payoff could be enormous, investing in crypto is still incredibly risky, as the FTX collapse shows. This means investing in crypto won't suit all investors.\n\nSo, before adding crypto ETFs to your portfolio, consider your financial situation carefully. It's vital to ensure crypto investing aligns with your personal investment goals and risk appetite."

        "content": "After crossing the psychological threshold at $30,000 earlier in April, Bitcoin (BTC) is back to trading below this key level once again, leaving investors and financial experts trying to gauge the movements of the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) by the end of the year.\n\nIndeed, a panel of 32 financial technology and cryptocurrency specialists has projected that the price of Bitcoin would grow during 2023, peaking at $42,225 before finally ending the year at $35,459, according to the results of a poll carried out by the investment platform Finder and shared with Finbold on April 19.\n\nBitcoin year-end price predictions for 2023, 2025, and 2030. Source: Finder\n\nWhat do the experts say?\n\nAs a bullish case for Bitcoin, GroveToken COO Carlo Di Clemente used the fact that having lost trust in banks, people have started to look at the maiden crypto asset as a practical alternative to traditional banking, which \u201chas had a positive effect on Bitcoin adoption in 2023.\u201d\n\nAs he added:\n\n\u201cBitcoin could also continue to experience significant price appreciation over the next decade as more institutional investors and corporations adopt [an] increasing mainstream acceptance [of] Bitcoin as a form of payment.\u201d\n\nHis views are shared by Tommy Honan, head of commercial operations at Swyftx, who stressed Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cmany sought-after properties for institutional and retail investors alike,\u201d as well as its finite supply, which \u201ccould lead to an increase in price as supply shock is felt.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, John Hawkins, senior lecturer at the University of Canberra, isn\u2019t optimistic about the future of Bitcoin, arguing that:\n\n\u201cBitcoin is a speculative bubble, which I expect to burst. (\u2026) Although predicting when is very hard. It has failed as a payment instrument or currency, failed as an inflation hedge or store of value, and failed as a diversification asset.\u201d\n\nIs it time to buy Bitcoin now?\n\nThat said, 52% of Finder\u2019s panel believe that now is a good time to buy Bitcoin, whereas 32% suggest holding. On the opposite side of the spectrum is the 16% of panelists who recommend selling the largest digital asset by market capitalization.\n\nPanel\u2019s opinions on buying, selling, or holding BTC. Source: Finder\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that more than half of panelists believe that President Joe Biden\u2019s plan to close the \u2018wash trading\u2019 loophole for digital assets would create a certain amount of negative effect on Bitcoin.\n\nSpecifically, 22% have stated it will have a \u201cminimal effect,\u201d another 22% say that it will have a \u201cmoderate effect,\u201d and 19% believe it will have a \u201csignificant effect.\u201d In contrast, 28% of panelists are skeptical that President Biden\u2019s \u2018wash trading\u2019 rule would have any effect on Bitcoin or the broader crypto market.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAs things stand, Bitcoin is currently changing hands at the price of $29,281, recording a decline of 2.39% on the day, as well as decreasing 3.24% over the last week, while still retaining the 3.88% gains it has accumulated over the past month, according to the data retrieved on April 19.\n\nBitcoin 30-day price chart.

        "title": "Analysis and comparison of Bitcoin and Gold - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Bitcoin and Gold have always been considered \u201cstore of value\u201d assets, able to serve as safe haven assets in times of market uncertainty or difficult macroeconomic situations.\n\nBitcoin is often referred to as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d precisely because it is considered the virtual version of the classic gold bar.\n\nWe will attempt to analyze as best we can what kind of relationship there is between these two assets and whether they are really correlated with each other.\n\nBitcoin and the correlation relationship with Gold\n\nIn recent months Bitcoin and gold seem to be moving hand in hand as fears of a US recession increased when Silicon Valley Bank failed bringing uncertainty and fear to the markets.\n\nThe collapse of the US bank brought back memories of the Lehman Brothers collapse on 15 September 2008 and the subsequent subprime mortgage crisis in the United States, which caused disastrous damage to the world economy.\n\nThe losers in that context were first and foremost investors and savers, who saw the sacrifices of a lifetime disappear because of the manipulation of a corrupt financial system.\n\nAt that time in history, gold was registering one of its biggest price rallies, and in parallel Bitcoin was about to be released to the world, putting itself forward as a decentralized exchange currency capable of staying outside the perverse mechanism of traditional finance.\n\nHowever, over the years Bitcoin has become less and less established as a currency, given its difficulty in use and high transaction costs, while it has grown stronger and stronger as a value reserve asset.\n\nPerhaps with the expansion of the Lightning Network, Bitcoin will be able to make its case as a trading currency but that is a different story.\n\nBitcoin is currently seen as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d performing the same functions as gold, but in a virtual and decentralized version.\n\nThe first quarter of 2023 was largely positive for BTC just as it was for the world\u2019s most famous commodity asset, while the stock market sector failed to keep pace.\n\nIn particular, Bitcoin rose from $16,500 to the current $30,000 recording an increase of about 82%. Gold began the year with a price of $1823 an ounce and now sits very close to all-time highs at $1993 marking a 9.3% rise.\n\nAccording to Glassnode\u2018s on-chain data, there has been a strong correlation between the price of the two assets over the past 12 months.\n\nThe term \u201cBuy Bitcoin\u201d is more searched on google than \u201cBuy Gold\u201d in Nigeria\n\nBitcoin seems to be more valued in those countries in the world where there is more poverty and where there is an absence of a strong central currency capable of addressing the economic needs of citizens.\n\nDeveloping countries such as El Salvador have embraced the decentralization philosophy inherent in Bitcoin by electing the cryptocurrency as a state currency.\n\nIn this regard, a plan was recently approved in El Salvador to remove the inherent taxation on all technological innovations, including Bitcoin.\n\nAnother country where the central currency is struggling to bear the brunt of inflation is Nigeria.\n\nAs of June 2016, the Nigerian Naira has lost more than half of its countervalue against the Euro.\n\nOver the years, Nigerian savers have been adversely affected by the weakness of their currency, which is worth less and less abroad, hence they have become increasingly interested in assets that serve as safe-haven assets such as Gold and Bitcoin.\n\nTruth be told, Bitcoin seems to be more highly valued than Gold by the Central African population: analyzing data from Google Trends it is possible to observe that, as of 2016 the term \u201cBuy Bitcoin\u201d was much more searched on the search engine than \u201cBuy Gold\u201d\n\nBitcoin: is the bear market over?\n\nWhile gold seems to be approaching new price highs, Bitcoin remains midway between its bottom of the last bear cycle at around $15,500 and its high touched in the last bull cycle at $69,000.\n\nMany are wondering if the bear market is behind us or if future price corrections will cause the leading cryptocurrency to have to revisit its local lows.\n\nThe answer is by no means a foregone conclusion and could also depend on the state of the US economy, which seems to be in oblivion between recession risk and market recovery.\n\nIn the meantime, inflation seems to have stabilized in the US and the March CPI (consumer price index) data show us that goods prices in America rose less than expected (+0.1% versus expectations of +0.2%).\n\nThis means that perhaps inflation may have reached a level that is easily controlled by the Fed and that markets may resume their upward race in 2024 when the US central bank stops its economic slowdown policies.\n\nMeanwhile, returning to Bitcoin, it is interesting to note that stablecoin holdings on cryptocurrency exchanges are falling dramatically, giving a positive signal for the immediate future.\n\nThe previous bull market started precisely when stablecoin reserves on exchanges had reached a very low level, around $2 billion in countervalue.\n\nAnother very interesting on-chain data to analyze concerns the percentage of BTC held in profit versus those held at a loss.\n\nIn 2023, a total of 6.2 million BTC returned to profit, a highly encouraging sign for a bull continuation.\n\nSimplifying, this data tells us that below $30,000 there are many coins that act as support, making it more difficult for a break of that level and consequently a return to a bear market"
