        "title": "Has El Salvador's bitcoin gamble paid off? - Marketplace",
        "content": "A sign outside the Good Beans coffee shop in San Salvador advertises that it accepts bitcoin. (BBC)\n\nAt a small coffee shop in San Salvador, the capital of El Salvador, customers come for freshly made coffee and packets of high-quality beans. And some pay in bitcoin.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has been legal tender in the Central American country for more than two years. Businesses are officially required to accept bitcoin, but patchy technology, limited internet access and a lack of enforcement means that only some do.\n\nCoffee shop owner Gabe Gutierrez believes taking bitcoin payments has helped him attract customers.\n\n\u201cIn a normal month, 5% to 10% of our sales are in bitcoin. The business impact has been very positive in that sense,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously it\u2019s bringing in revenue, but it\u2019s not only that. It\u2019s more convenient.\u201c\n\nPresident Nayib Bukele argued that adopting bitcoin would reduce dependence on the country\u2019s other currency, the U.S. dollar, and make it cheaper to send and receive remittances \u2014 when migrants send home money to their family.\n\nBut in the first six months of 2023, according to El Salvador\u2019s central bank, only around 1% of received remittances were in bitcoin. Many Salvadorans, like Delmy Bran, aren\u2019t using the currency.\n\n\u201cIf they educated the people in how to use the currency, then maybe we could,\u201d he said.\n\nOthers like Bea Tenorio think the government\u2019s decision was irresponsible. \u201cA country needs medicine in the hospitals, resources in the schools. I don\u2019t think those of us at the bottom will see the benefits of it.\u201d\n\nEl Salvador has lost an estimated $40 million of its total investment in bitcoin since 2021 due to a decline in the value of the cryptocurrency. Carlos Acevedo, an economist and former president of El Salvador\u2019s Central Reserve Bank, doesn\u2019t think bitcoin is suitable as legal tender.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like playing Monopoly in the casino. You can win, you can lose \u2014 and we have had bad luck so far \u2014 but for people who are poor, they cannot afford to take a drop in 5%, 10% in one day.\u201d\n\nBut the government is continuing to push bitcoin. It recently announced that bitcoin education would be compulsory in schools starting next year. People from other countries are also moving to El Salvador to use the cryptocurrency, like James Turner and Nicky Malcom of New Zealand.\n\n\u201cSo I receive 100% of my income at the moment as bitcoin, which we then manage that to live our life here,\u201d Turner said. \u201cWe use it to buy our groceries,\u201d added Malcom.\n\nCharlie Stevens moved here from Ireland. \u201cI use bitcoin to trim my beard, for coffees, for gas, for cooking, I use it for my motorbike, and that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg.\u201d\n\nWhile some say El Salvador\u2019s bitcoin project hasn\u2019t succeeded, others believe it\u2019s only just beginning."

        "title": "Bitcoin life insurance company sees beauty in boring - Axios",
        "content": "Zac Townsend, CEO of Meanwhile. Photo illustration: Axios Visuals. Photo: Paige Newton, courtesy of Meanwhile\n\nLife insurance is boring, which is just what bitcoin needs, according to Zac Townsend, the CEO of Meanwhile. Why it matters: Building classic financial services on newfangled digital assets is a road to building out crypto's original vision: An alternative financial system based on a monetary system that's not subject to the whims of politicians.\n\nWhat they're saying: \"Bitcoin has this culture of HODLing (a crypto meme for holding through price swings) and has this culture of long-term store of value, and that's really what life insurance is about,\" Townsend says.\n\nHow it works: Meanwhile is a life insurance company that does everything in bitcoin, while still offering tax advantages that customers might expect for products they're considering for estate planning.\n\nSpeaking very broadly, a customer that gives Meanwhile 10 BTC can expect a beneficiary to receive 20 BTC after the customer dies (precise terms are subject to actuarial analysis, etc., but that's been a rough idea of the deal, here in the early days).\n\nTownsend called that price a \"ballpark.\" The minimum buy-in, for now, is five bitcoin over five years (roughly $175,000).\n\nTo meet its obligations, the company runs a conservative credit desk, targeting a 3% return in bitcoin (2% is all it needs to pay death benefits).\n\nA selling point is that, over time, users can borrow against their benefit tax-free, Townsend explained.\n\nThe intrigue: \"We accept all our premiums in bitcoin. We pay all our claims in bitcoin,\" Townsend says. \"Because all our assets and liabilities are in bitcoin, the price of bitcoin doesn't matter.\"\n\nState of play: In June, Meanwhile announced it raised $19 million at a reported $100 million valuation.\n\nThat raise reached a little over $20 million now, with Stillmark \u2014 a Bitcoin-focused fund \u2014 joining later, Townsend tells Axios.\n\nThe company got its sandbox license with the Bermuda Monetary Authority at the end of last year. (Bermuda is a leading nation for domiciling insurance companies)\n\n\"The way we talked to them about it was, 'We're going to build a boring life insurance company,'\" he said.\n\nTownsend declined to disclose numbers but says Meanwhile is selling policies. Right now, it's only available in the U.S.\n\nHis goal is to offer it in places where saving is harder, such as Argentina, Zimbabwe and Nigeria.\n\nZoom out: The company runs with seven people now, but Townsend thinks a large insurance company can be built with low overhead by using artificial intelligence to do jobs like customer service.\n\nThe bottom line: \"We have already worked on policies right now that are going to outlive me,\" he says.\n\nGo deeper: Bitcoin ETF approvals are still no slam dunk"

        "content": "A different kind of ATM is setting up shop in your local convenience store.\n\nThese machines look like traditional banking kiosks, but they allow customers to buy bitcoin in cash.\n\nBitcoin ATMs, or BTMs, exploded in popularity between 2020 and mid-2022, at the height of the crypto craze. At their peak, BTMs totaled 34,000 across the U.S., according to Coin ATM Radar.\n\nMore and more people are using bitcoin ATMs to send money at lightning speed. A study from Bitcoin Depot, the company with the largest share of BTMs across the U.S., found that two-thirds of their customers use the machines for remittances and online purchases. But these machines have also gained a reputation as a vehicle for crime. Scammers can send their victims to these kiosks to take advantage of the faster transaction speeds.\n\nWatch the video above to learn more about what's driving the BTM boom, why these machines attract crime, and how prosecutors plan to fight back."

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe supply of freely circulating bitcoin has tightened to historic lows, as long-term investors are stashing an all-time high amount of the cryptocurrency, according to data from Glassnode.\n\nBy one measure, the amount of held bitcoin in wallets with minimal spending history hit a record of over 15.4 million tokens, the blockchain data platform said. Similar trends can be seen in the net position change of long-term holders, with inflow levels steadily climbing.\n\nAn all-time high is also forming in the spread between long-term holder (LTH) and short-term holder (STH) supply, Glassnode said. It's a sign of how tight the market is becoming, demonstrating that short-term buyers are unlikely to find many sellers willing to part with their holdings.\n\n\"LTHs historically wait for the market to break to new price [all-time highs] before ramping up their distribution,\" the report said. \"This process can be seen by the large scale decline in their supply during the 2021 bull run, which is matched by an uptick in STH Supply, as well as Exchange inflow volumes.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis resistance to selling comes on expectations that bitcoin will eventually breach earlier price highs. That comes as possible regulatory approval of a spot bitcoin ETF as well as bitcoin's April halving are fueling investor optimism.\n\nThese same factors are driving increasingly bullish calls on bitcoin's trajectory, with investing firm Bernstein recently projecting the token to hit $150,000 by mid-2025.\n\nGlassnode suggested that bitcoin's current price levels are of interest, given that most short-term held coins have become profitable since the token breached $30,000. This may fuel a transfer of coins to new investors, especially if the price declines from its current $35,000 level."

Analysis of investor cost basis for various cohorts suggests that this $30,000 level is an important zone of interest for the bulls,\" the Glassnode analysis said.\n\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization increased by over 1.3% in the past 24 hours to $35,272 at 9:48 a.m. in New York, according to CoinGecko."

The Miner Mag\n\n\"While some of these companies consistently sell all of their mined bitcoin every month, others adopt a hybrid treasury strategy such as Marathon, Hut 8, Cipher, CleanSpark, Bit Digital \u2013 and it was them who liquidated more in October than in previous months,\" the post stated.\n\nUsually, miners sell minted coins to replenish their cash flows or take advantage of rallying crypto prices. Riding on a wave of optimism around an expected approval of a spot bitcoin ETF, prices surged to months-long highs. The currency is currently trading at $35,746, up 115% year-to-date.\n\nAnother possible reason why producers were cashing in on tokens is to get ahead of the next bitcoin halving in 2024. That's when the reward for mining is cut in half, and miners may have been trying to dampen the upcoming blow by selling.\n\nThe sale of tokens helps with bitcoin supply in what's currently a tight market. Last month, a Forex.com analyst warned that bitcoin may see a supply shock, with tradeable tokens on crypto exchanges at their lowest since 2018."

        "content": "This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin and ether. We\u2019ve also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia, a cryptocurrency is \u201ca digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.\u201d Cryptocurrency is a young asset class that has developed a reputation for price volatility; however, there are ETFs that could help mitigate risk for those investors seeking crypto exposure.\n\nBitcoin was the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Ether is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three with its launch in July 2015. XRP, which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We\u2019ve included it here for reference.\n\nThe third-largest market share of cryptocurrency, tether, is a token \u201cbacked by actual assets\u201d which includes one U.S. dollar, one euro, or loans to affiliate companies, and is controlled by the owners of Bitfinex. It\u2019s a controversial cryptocurrency due to its alleged manipulation of crypto pricing. It is called a \u201cstable coin\u201d because it was designed to always be worth $1.00. We do not chart it because its price rarely changes.\n\nFor a better understanding of crypto market cycles, read more here.\n\nThe Latest Cryptocurrencies Data (through November 7, 2023)\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price continued to rise this week, breaking $35,000 for the first time since May 2022. BTC is now up ~111% year to date. Some cryptomarket observers believe this year\u2019s rally is the start of something even greater and that Bitcoin could continue this momentum over the next few years.\n\nXRP\u2019s price rose sharply this week as it briefly ticked above $0.70 for the first time since August. XRP is now up over 100% year to date.\n\nEther posted its highest close in over three months, finishing just under $1,900. ETH is now up ~56% year to date.\n\nAn index has been created to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. Ether tops the chart, i.e., the price of an ether has changed the most out of all three cryptocurrencies.\n\nETFs associated with cryptocurrencies include: ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITI), VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), and Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH).\n\nWhat\u2019s next in the crypto ETF market?

        "content": "Bitcoin wallet and API platform Blink, formerly known as Bitcoin Beach Wallet, has announced a new partnership with Distribuidora Moraz\u00e1n, the second-largest distributor of consumer goods in El Salvador, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nThis collaboration between Blink and Distribuidora Moraz\u00e1n has paved the way for a pilot program that allows the distributor to accept bitcoin from a select segment of its extensive customer base, which includes over 40,000 merchants. Furthermore, Distribuidora Moraz\u00e1n is actively encouraging and supporting these merchants in integrating Bitcoin as a payment option in their retail locations. This move by Distribuidora Moraz\u00e1n is a strategic endeavor to promote and foster business-to-business (B2B) Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador.\n\n\"Our distribution operation, until today, has been predominantly managed in cash and this presents a series of logistical, time, and operational difficulties that slow our day-to-day ability to visit more points of sale. Bitcoin solves that,\" said Distribuidora Moraz\u00e1n CEO Rodrigo Jacir Garcia-Prieto. \"The vast majority of our customers do not have access to banking services and this is the perfect way to introduce them to their first financial tool. We want to take full advantage of what bitcoin can do for us and our customers by enabling cash management efficiency, reducing operational expenditures, and increasing our ability to expand our reach within Central America while using a secure payment method such as Blink.\"\n\nThe pilot program has already been rolled out to 30 of the target 80 Phase I merchants, with plans to onboard up to 3% of Distribuidora Moraz\u00e1n's customers, equivalent to 1,000 merchants, in 2024.\n\n\"Our collaboration with Distribuidora Moraz\u00e1n isn't just about a feature or a program. It's about catalyzing a nation's shift to embrace Bitcoin from the ground up,\" said Noor El Bawab, CEO of Blink.\n\nThis partnership, along with Blink's new 'Buy & Sell Bitcoin' feature, marks a substantial step forward in normalizing Bitcoin transactions in everyday life in El Salvador. These initiatives exemplify a concerted effort to harness Bitcoin's potential for efficient business operations and inclusive economic growth among communities and small businesses.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "It\u2019s felt like old times in the crypto markets as traders celebrated the first proper \u201cUptober\u201d (October in crypto speak) in a while, with Bitcoin gaining around 28% by month\u2019s end. Meanwhile, the start of November has seen altcoins get a piece of the action with XRP rising around 20% over the past week as Dogecoin and Cardano have likewise posted double digit gains.\n\nAll of this reflects the return of what market watchers like to call \u201crisk on\u201d behavior\u2014or what skeptics might prefer to call \u201cLet\u2019s hit the casino, boys!\u201d The basic idea is that, as the vibe around crypto improves, more traders are willing to seek out investments that offer high risk but the potential for high rewards.\n\nAs analyst Noelle Acheson has noted, the recent rally has been fueled by the return of leverage as more traders borrow money to supersize their bet on a variety of exotic tokens. Meanwhile, the crypto derivatives market is humming again as people are buying stablecoins from DeFi platforms to try their luck on perpetual futures contracts and similar bets that those of us without a Ph.D. in math would be crazy to go near.\n\nThe question is what this all means. As is the case with most crypto market price swings, there appears to be no single cause to explain the current rally. Instead, there is a series of potential factors driving the current mini-boom\u2014including a growing consensus that Crypto Winter is over at last and that better times are on the way. Don\u2019t underestimate how much sentiment, bad or good, drives the market\u2014and especially the crypto markets.\n\nIf the current altcoin rally lasts, though, the thing I am most curious to see is if traders put a new premium on fundamentals\u2014however you want to define that term when it comes to crypto. In past bull markets, few investors bothered to look for anything resembling empirical evidence to justify throwing their money at the fly-by-night coin du jour. Instead, they relied on half-baked advice from their taxi driver or personal trainer, or accepted the claims of bag holders and bot armies on X. Number go up and all that.\n\nThis time around, it would be nice to see crypto traders return to the market older and wiser after the many debacles of the last cycle. And just maybe the price of altcoins will rise because they have found a novel application or because a critical mass of people are using them for something beyond blind speculation. That\u2019s the optimistic case. But if this new cycle proves to be driven again by mindless gambling, we can look forward to the same bad hangover that\u2019s become a defining feature of the crypto industry.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nKraken plans to follow Coinbase's lead and launch its own layer-2 blockchain, possibly built on the tech stack of Polygon or Matter Labs.

        "title": "This 1 Catalyst Could Send Bitcoin Soaring Back to Its All-Time High of $69,000 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "There's a good reason why Bitcoin (BTC -3.82%) has earned a reputation as a tremendously volatile asset. It typically moves in dramatic boom-and-bust cycles, sometimes without any apparent rhyme or reason. After a huge \"bust\" year in 2022, when it lost 65% of its value, Bitcoin has entered a new \"boom\" phase and is up more than 110% for the year.\n\nWhat makes this year's boom so remarkable is that it is not being driven by retail investors. Instead, the driving catalyst for this year's rally appears to be large institutional investors, many of whom are embracing Bitcoin for the first time. And that is leading to some tremendously bullish predictions about where Bitcoin could be headed next, including a potential rally back to its all-time high of $69,000.\n\nSigns of institutional investor bullishness\n\nThe signs of a dramatic change in investor sentiment are everywhere these days. Wall Street giant Morgan Stanley recently opined that \"crypto winter\" could finally be over. A top market strategist at Fidelity Investments recently outlined a new investment thesis calling Bitcoin \"exponential gold.\" Even some top hedge fund managers, who never before invested in crypto, are now waxing poetic about the allure of Bitcoin. Legendary billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller, for example, recently said in a Robinhood Fireside Chat, \"I don't own any Bitcoin, to be frank, but I should.\"\n\nWhat's driving the new enthusiasm for Bitcoin?\n\nThere are at least three good reasons for the change in sentiment. The most obvious one is the enthusiasm over the imminent arrival of the first-ever spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). When this product launches, it could result in a tsunami of new money into Bitcoin. Some of the largest institutional investors -- including BlackRock (BLK -2.08%), the largest asset manager in the world -- are behind this surge in new interest in Bitcoin. The conventional wisdom is that even if large institutional investors allocate just 1% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, then it could push up its price significantly.\n\nThe other big reason for the change in sentiment is the overall macroeconomic outlook. Institutional investors are always on the lookout for a hedge against bad things happening in the broader economy, and have settled on Bitcoin as a potential hedge. Bitcoin has been widely touted as a potential hedge against inflation, which is what has earned it the moniker of \"digital gold.\" And earlier this year, the string of regional bank failures led to many institutional investors moving their money into Bitcoin, all in the hopes of avoiding the pain and upheaval happening in the traditional banking system.\n\nAnd, finally, there's building excitement over the Bitcoin halving in April 2024. This unique event, which happens only once every four years, results in the mining reward for Bitcoin miners being cut by one-half. This might sound like a highly technical event, but it has rather profound implications for the future price of Bitcoin. It makes Bitcoin a more deflationary asset (by reducing the rate at which new Bitcoin is being created), and it creates a \"scarcity effect\" around Bitcoin. In three previous halving cycles, Bitcoin has rallied to new all-time highs, and the expectation is for a similar outcome in 2024.\n\nSo what could go wrong?\n\nGiven all of the above, it might seem obvious that Bitcoin has nowhere to go but up. But don't forget: Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset. Put another way, Bitcoin is unlikely to march upward in any kind of obvious pattern. There will be zigs and zags along the way. Some analysts predict that Bitcoin might drop back to $25,000 or even $20,000 from its current level of $35,000. And, when you add in macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, Bitcoin could end up disappointing a lot of bulls over the next 12 months.\n\nThat being said, I remain bullish on Bitcoin over the long haul. The arrival of institutional investors to the Bitcoin party is long overdue, and should continue to push up the price of the world's most valuable cryptocurrency for years, if not decades, to come."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading within a narrow 4.5% range over the past two weeks, indicating a level of consolidation around the $34,700 mark.\n\nDespite the stagnant prices, the 24.2% gains since Oct. 7 instill confidence, driven by the impending effects of the 2024 halving and the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States.\n\nInvestors worry about the bearish global economic outlook\n\nBears expect further macroeconomic data supporting a global economic contraction as the U.S. Federal Reserve holds its interest rate above 5.25% in order to curb inflation. For instance, on Nov. 6, Chinese exports shrank 6.4% from a year earlier in October. Furthermore, Germany reported October industrial production down 1.4% versus the prior month on Nov. 7.\n\nThe weaker global economic activity has led to WTI oil prices dipping below $78 for the first time since late July, despite the potential for supply cuts from major oil producers. U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari\u2019s remarks on Nov. 6 set a bearish tone, prompting a \u201cflight-to-quality\u201d response.\n\nKashkari stated:\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t completely solved the inflation problem. We still have more work ahead of us to get it done.\u201d\n\nInvestors have sought refuge in U.S. Treasurys, resulting in the 10-year note yield dropping to 4.55%, its lowest level in six weeks. Curiously, the S&P 500 stock market index has reached 4,383 points, its highest level in nearly seven weeks, defying expectations during a global economic slowdown.\n\nThis phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that the firms within the S&P 500 collectively hold $2.6 trillion in cash and equivalents, offering some protection as interest rates remain high. Despite increasing exposure to major tech companies, the stock market provides both scarcity and dividend yield, aligning with investor preferences during times of uncertainty.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s futures open interest has reached its highest level since April 2022, standing at $16.3 billion. This milestone gains even more significance as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange solidifies its position as the second-largest market for BTC derivatives.\n\nHealthy demand for Bitcoin options and futures\n\nThe recent use of Bitcoin futures and options has made media headlines. The demand for leverage is likely fueled by what investors believe are the two most bullish catalysts for 2024: the potential for a spot BTC ETF and the Bitcoin halving.\n\nOne way to gauge market health is by examining the Bitcoin futures premium, which measures the difference between two-month futures contracts and the current spot price. In a robust market, the annualized premium, also known as the basis rate, should typically fall within the 5%\u201310% range.\n\nBitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium (basis). Source: Laevitas\n\nNotice how this indicator has reached its highest level in over a year, at 11%. This indicates a strong demand for Bitcoin futures primarily driven by leveraged long positions. If the opposite were true, with investors heavily betting on Bitcoin\u2019s price decline, the premium would have remained at 5% or lower.\n\nAnother piece of evidence can be derived from the Bitcoin options markets, comparing the demand between call (buy) and put (sell) options. While this analysis doesn\u2019t encompass more intricate strategies, it offers a broad context for understanding investor sentiment.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin Ordinals see resurgence from Binance listing\n\nDeribit BTC options put-to-call 24h volume ratio. Source: Laevitas\n\nOver the past week, this indicator has averaged 0.60, reflecting a 40% bias favoring call (buy) options. Interestingly, Bitcoin options open interest has seen a 51% increase over the past 30 days, reaching $15.6 billion, and this growth has also been driven by bullish instruments, as indicated by the put-to-call volume data.\n\nAs Bitcoin\u2019s price reaches its highest level in 18 months, some degree of skepticism and hedging might be expected. However, the current conditions in the derivatives market reveal healthy growth with no signs of excessive optimism, aligning with the bullish outlook targeting prices of $40,000 and higher by year-end.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Chart of the days presented by crypto dot com. The leading crypto platform trusted by over 80 million users worldwide. All right, let's take a look at the chart of the day. Bitcoin's volatility in 2023 is at its lowest in over a decade. That's according to E coin Metris. The term volatility which measures how much the price of an asset fluctuates often comes with a negative connotation, but that's not always the case investors can experience swings up or down. It's important to remember that there is up potential too. This chart shows Bitcoin's average monthly volatility since 2014. The largest Cryptocurrency by market cap has doubled in value and soared above the $35,000 mark this year. Amid weak liquidity conditions. Yet volatility has been largely absent from the market with rates ranging predominantly between 20 to 40%. It appears Bitcoin investors in 2023 are seeing more payoff compared to previous years. Though perhaps macro and leverage traders are continuing to sit on the fence. Bitcoin is currently trading hands at around $35,200. That's it for today's chart of the day. I'm Jen Sasi we'll see you next time to unpack more of the data behind top news stories."

        "content": "What we are seeing right now is a good old bump in open interest on the CME futures. And the chart we have here is for the standard contract, which is sized at 55 BDC per contract. And it's kind of considered a proxy for institutional activity and the open interest or as they say, you know, the notional dollar value locked in the number of active contracts, it has gone up by something like 30% in just four weeks. And popular inference is that the open interest is rising. It means traders are taking bullish bets, but that's not necessarily the case because you open interest doesn't tell you anything about the positioning of traders. Yeah, that they could be taking shots, they could be taking loans or, you know, they, they, they might be taking delta neutral trades like they might be selling futures against long position in the spot market right here. What's happening, you know, is the, as we can see on the chart, the open interest every time the open interest rises by double digits within just a few weeks, we tend to get a turnaround in the Bitcoin spot price. It happened in uh I think in late 2022 it marked the bottom, the July talk that we saw early this year was also accompanied by a sharp uptick in the CME open interest. So the similar pattern is likely to play out. Now, now that we have such a sharp rise in open interest. It's kind of, you know, if you're a bullish trader, it's kind of the right time to maybe scale back your risk and anticipate healthy price pullback."

        "content": "One of the most frequently mentioned criticisms of bitcoin mining is that it\u2019s energy-intensive. Making that matter worse is that the industry is a massive consumer of fossil fuels, arguably inviting that criticism. Indeed, data supports the notion that there\u2019s ample room for bitcoin miners to increase usage of renewable energy.\n\nSome companies are getting that memo. As the groups\u2019 green energy consumption increases, assets such as the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) could benefit. The equity sleeve of the fund\u2019s portfolio heavily tilts toward cryptocurrency miners. That\u2019s an asset class that isn\u2019t highly correlated to crypto prices. But it\u2019s one that\u2019s also drawn the ire of policymakers and regulators for elevated dependence on fossil fuels.\n\nGreenfield of Green Energy Opportunity for SATO\n\nData confirms the point that the bitcoin mining industry, including SATO member firms, have plenty of room to improve renewable energy consumption. According to BanklessTimes.com, two-thirds of the energy consumed by bitcoin miners is fossil fuels, including coal and natural gas.\n\n\u201cThe choice of energy for Bitcoin mining has become a topic for debate. There is increasing evidence indicating that a significant amount of Bitcoin mining relies on fossil energies. This information is causing concerns about the impact of Bitcoin and how it could contribute to climate change,\u201d noted analyst Alice Leetham.\n\nSome bitcoin miners are awakening to the benefits of broadening use of renewables. If nothing else, by boosting use of green energy, cryptocurrency miners can appease regulators while reducing criticism of their energy choices. Additionally, reduced dependence on fossil fuels could, over time, boost profitability in the industry.\n\nData indicates some operators are already seizing the benefits of renewables. Thirty-seven percent of the energy consumer by bitcoin miners is derived from hydro or wind power, according to BanklessTimes. Nearly 13% is either nuclear or solar. Those percentages aren\u2019t staggering, but they imply room for growth and that some miners are taking seriously environmental stewardship.\n\n\u201cBitcoin mining companies, investors and enthusiasts have a shared responsibility to lead the industry towards friendly practices. It is essential to invest in energy infrastructure, promote research and development of energy technologies and advocate for strict regulations. These measures are crucial for reducing the impact of Bitcoin mining,\u201d concluded BanklessTimes."

This surprising turn of events has stirred controversy, with Binance co-founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao expressing his disapproval.\n\nWhat Happened: Roubini, who once labeled Bitcoin as a \u201cshitcoin,\u201d belittled Ethereum, and dismissed blockchain technology as no more than a spreadsheet, has now ventured into the world of cryptocurrency with his latest project.

        "content": "For almost three years, filmmaker Paul Kemp has been investigating what happened to Bitcoin's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym: the cryptocurrency founder (or founders) hid his identity only to vanish in 2011, two years after he unleashed his new digital currency on the world.\n\nIt's believed Nakamoto holds more than one million Bitcoins \u2014 and not one of those coins has ever been transferred or moved from their digital wallet. If the value of Bitcoin continues to skyrocket, which it very likely will since there is a limited total of bitcoins in existence, Nakamoto could eventually become the richest person on earth.\n\nIn Searching for Satoshi: The Mysterious Disappearance of the Bitcoin Creator, Kemp investigates who the person (or people) behind the name might be and what might have happened to him.\n\nKemp was drawn to the story because it is, he says, \"the greatest technological mystery of all time.\" While there have been several attempts to uncover who Nakamoto is, none have been successful. So Kemp went on a global quest of his own, which he describes in the interview below.\n\nWhat made you want to investigate the story \u2014 and whereabouts \u2014 of Satoshi Nakamoto?\n\nWhen I heard about Bitcoin in 2009, 2010, 2011 \u2026 I didn't really know what it was. I thought it was like Monopoly money. I thought it was just some crypto weirdness that [didn't have] much staying power.\n\nBut as the decade went on, I started to realize people are still working on this thing and the name Bitcoin is everywhere. I saw ATM machines selling Bitcoin. I saw vendors [and] stores accepting Bitcoin. So I started paying more attention to it around 2018, 2019. That's when I learned there was a guy named Satoshi Nakamoto, who actually created Bitcoin.\n\nEveryone who knows anything about Bitcoin realizes he's the greatest mystery in technological history. Nobody knows who he is. All they know is he could possibly be the richest person in the world in the coming years, but he's just vanished.\n\nNakamoto launched Bitcoin in 2009, and by 2011, he [disappeared] with over a million Bitcoins. This documentary asks the deeper questions about who he is and why he did this.\n\nBitcoin was released in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. 2 years later, he disappeared | Searching for Satoshi Duration 2:03 On January 3, 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, released the digital currency to the world by posted the \"genesis block,\" the starting point from where Bitcoins could be mined through the blockchain.\n\nHow did you try to track Nakamoto down?\n\nIt's a global story and it needed global legs. I needed to get on a lot of planes. I needed to do a lot of interviewing. Throughout the making of this documentary, I've been to the U.K. to uncover somebody who has claimed to be Nakamoto. I've talked to people in Australia. I've been to Saipan, which is a U.S. protectorate in the middle of the Pacific where I uncovered some amazing evidence of who Nakamoto might be. And of course, I've been to Silicon Valley and the enormous Miami Bitcoin conferences. I think I've traced a pretty good story for the audience.\n\nHow did you create your list of the five people Nakamoto could be?\n\nThe main candidates for Satoshi are currently:\n\nAdam Back, a U.K. cryptographer.\n\nHal Finney, a now deceased cryptographer who was deeply influential in the creation of Bitcoin.\n\nWei Dai, who was a cryptographer in the late '90s and early 2000s who had worked on an earlier proposal for a digital currency.\n\nNick Szabo, who is a polymath. He's written on all sorts of things from politics to economics, but also has the coding ability to possibly be Nakamoto.\n\nSo there are a handful of top candidates, but there's also the possibility that Satoshi Nakamoto is somebody that we've never heard of and that he basically released this technology on the world and vanished.\n\nPerhaps we'll never know who it is.\n\nDid the direction of the film change as you dug deeper into the story?\n\nIt's a detective story that's still unravelling, so the film was constantly changing and evolving as I discovered new pieces of evidence. I went into this film not knowing who I thought Nakamoto was. I had an idea that it could be probably three or four people.\n\nBut I was thrown for a loop on that and was forced to rethink my conclusions. And the deeper I went into my research, the more I came up with different conclusions.\n\nIn the documentary, I've presented a character whom I strongly believe is Nakamoto. Maybe I'm wrong. But if so, I'd love my critics to prove why."

The bank also operates as Custodia Bank in other states like California and Wyoming. Eligible users include U.S.-based businesses in states the bank is licensed, and which meets Custodia's customer onboarding requirements, Long noted.\n\nCustodia Bank and Custodia Digital Services operations in U.S. states. Source: Custodia\n\nCustodia Bank emphasized that the platform is a non-lending bank built by Bitcoiners that offers segregated custody accounts on its custom-built Bitcoin custody platform.\n\nUnlike the omnibus custody model, the segregated account model for Bitcoin custody is designed to separate customers' assets from the company\u2019s assets, Custodia\u2019s white paper reads. \u201cThe omnibus custody model dominates traditional financial markets, with most securities held at central securities depositories like the Depository Trust Company,\u201d the document stated, adding:\n\n\"We offer segregated accounts, which have superior customer protections over competing omnibus accounts that are standard offerings in the digital asset custody industry, and which commingle customer digital assets.\"\n\nCustodia Bank\u2019s approval from the Wyoming Division of Banking follows a series of regulatory challenges for the firm. In January 2023, the Federal Reserve Board rejected the bank\u2019s application to become a member of the Federal Reserve System, saying it was \u201cinconsistent with the required factors under the law.\u201d The Fed subsequently denied Custodia\u2019s request to reconsider its membership application in its system.\n\nRelated: DZ Bank, third-largest German bank, to start crypto custody for institutional investors\n\nIn a detailed report in March 2023, the Fed\u2019s board said the decision to reject Custodia\u2019s application was due to concerns about banks with a high concentration of activities related to the crypto industry. Custodia Bank opened for business in August 2023, though the Fed has blocked much of its proposed business model.\n\nFounded in 2020, Custodia is a bank aiming to bridge the gap between digital assets and the U.S. dollar payments system and a digital asset custodian.

        "content": "Bitcoin Accumulation Increases as Supply Reaches Historic Low, Supporting Price Stability: Report\n\nBitcoin's available supply has reached a new historical low, indicating an accumulation pattern, according to data from Glassnode. The report suggests that Bitcoin's illiquid supply and long-term holders are on the rise, resulting in a tightening supply and increased bullish sentiment.\n\nAccording to Glassnode's data, smaller, long-term holding entities are actively purchasing the available BTC supply, accounting for 92% of newly produced Bitcoin. The accumulating pattern is visible across investor cohorts, with long-term holdings outperforming short-term holders. This limiting of supply is helping Bitcoin keep its price over $34,000, giving strong support above $30,000.\n\nThe growing trust in Bitcoin is not limited to smaller entities; practically all investors have increased their Bitcoin holdings this year. This pattern displays an optimistic market attitude and points to a long-term bullish outlook.\n\nAnother positive indicator is the accumulation of illiquid Bitcoin, which has a limited quantity. Monthly inflows into the illiquid Bitcoin supply continue, with a net gain of 71,000 BTC per month.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nThink this year\u2019s S&P 500 rally of 15 per cent is pretty good? Take a look bitcoin\u2019s price, which has more than doubled since January.\n\nYet even that has done little to lift the fortunes of Robinhood. The company, whose app allows users to trade a number of cryptocurrencies, has lost four-fifths of its value since hitting a high in 2021. The stock fell another 15 per cent on Wednesday.\n\nThird-quarter earnings underscore how the app is losing its cachet among young traders.\n\nRobinhood\u2019s funded accounts grew by 360,000 year-on-year to 23.3mn. But fewer customers are actively trading. The number of monthly active users fell 16 per cent to just over 10mn compared with the period for the prior year. That is about half the figure reached at the height of the retail trading frenzy two years ago.\n\nThe company\u2019s woes are not shared by all its rivals. Brokerage platform Charles Schwab added 665,000 active accounts during its third quarter. Morgan Stanley, which owns E*Trade, added about 300,000 accounts during the September quarter.\n\nOverall, Robinhood\u2019s transaction-based revenue fell 11 per cent to $185mn during the quarter, amid a sharp drop in crypto and equities trading. It now makes more from its customers\u2019 idle cash. Segregated client accounts hold about $3.5bn of cash and securities. Revenue from net interest income nearly doubled year-on-year to $251mn. Even so, it booked a net loss of $85mn.\n\nThe boost from net interest income should soon diminish. The Federal Reserve appears to have finished raising interest rates. That will make for tougher comparatives in future. This is reflected in Robinhood\u2019s lowly valuation of less than four times revenue. Charles Schwab manages five times.\n\nRobinhood has sought to reinvent itself by branching out into new products such as retirement accounts. But to do so it will compete against established brands like Charles Schwab and Fidelity. It needs to find more arrows in its quiver to draw in more active traders."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nSenator Ted Cruz now accepts Bitcoin donations for his 2024 campaign.\n\nThis move highlights his strong support for cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin enjoys a bipartisan appeal, with several lawmakers hailing its significance.\n\nBut the Biden Administration\u2019s push for SBDC faces skepticism from politicians.\n\nMayors across the US are increasingly opting to receive their salaries in Bitcoin.\n\nThemes like skepticism toward institutions, economic disparity, and increased financial literacy align closely with the surge of Bitcoin in terms of both its value and widespread adoption.\n\nAs Bitcoin reaches its peak value during an American Presidential election cycle, particularly appealing to a demographic with a growing distrust of traditional institutions, it raises curiosity about the potential implications of these trends on the upcoming 2024 U.S. Presidential election.\n\nTed Cruz Embraces BTC Donations for 2024 Campaign\n\nSenator Ted Cruz of Texas has started taking Bitcoin contributions for his 2024 reelection campaign. The Republican senator declared: \u201cI am bullish on Bitcoin and I\u2019m proud to accept Bitcoin campaign donations.\u201d\n\nI am bullish on bitcoin, and I'm proud to accept bitcoin campaign donations.https://t.co/0j5njATP8M \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) November 6, 2023\n\nThe front page of his official website now features the Bitcoin logo and invites supporters to make cryptocurrency donations.\n\nSeveral presidential contenders declared earlier in the year that they would take Bitcoin donations for their campaigns. Other politicians might very well follow suit if the move proves to be effective. There\u2019s a chance that this will cause attitudes on Capitol Hill to change.\n\nStriving For Bipartisanship In BTC Realm\n\nThe senator is using BitPay, a cryptocurrency payment processor that allows payments in Bitcoin, Ether, BCH, and LTC with the ability to instantly convert to US dollars.\n\nThis makes him one of Congress\u2019s strongest supporters of cryptocurrencies, especially as Texas is becoming a center for Bitcoin mining as a result of China\u2019s 2021 ban on industrial mining.\n\nThe Bitcoin phenomenon may be more bipartisan than most people realize, despite the fact that Republicans have been more outspoken in their support of it.\n\nBe it as it may, a presidential candidate\u2019s views on Bitcoin and crypto are important not only because the president leads the country, but also because the President is responsible for appointing the heads of more than 50 independent federal commissions that can influence various aspects of crypto, including the SEC, CFTC, Federal Reserve and Treasury.\n\nSenators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand co-sponsored a bill about cryptocurrency. Though it is not a unique instance, this endeavor to legitimise the industry and explain rules in the summer of 2022 finally failed.\n\nAn essay titled \u201cA liberal case for cryptocurrency \u201d was written in 2022 by Representative Ritchie Torres, for instance. His piece focused on helping the underprivileged and shifting Wall Street\u2019s power dynamics. A few months prior, the article was the result of a legislative endeavor to provide clarification on cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nEven at the most recent Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami earlier this year, several lawmakers with varying political affiliations gave speeches. Robert Kennedy, Vivek Ramaswamy, and Tulsi Gabbard\u2014past and present presidential contenders\u2014were among the featured speakers.\n\nBiden Administration Advocates CBDC\n\nEven with the bipartisan support for Bitcoin, the Biden Administration\u2019s push for a central bank digital currency has not convinced many politicians. Ted Cruz mentioned the increasing significance of Bitcoin in a recent audio interview about CBDCs that is available to listen to below.\n\nBiden Admin Urges Israel to STOP\n\nKilling Terrorists, Dems Smear Justice Thomas, and School Choice\u2014the Civil Rights Issue of the 21st Century. @benfergusonshow and I discuss all this and more on this morning\u2019s new episode of Verdict. Don\u2019t miss it!https://t.co/zSt10lQMrs \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) November 6, 2023\n\nCruz seems to be thinking of CBDCs as an extension of the failed initiatives that led to the creation of the Build Back Better law under the Biden administration. During the interview, he stated that Build Back Better would have mandated that banks notify the government of any transaction above $400.\n\nCruz is mostly worried about the extent of monitoring and control that CBDCs would permit. He concluded that \u201cthe federal government has no business monitoring the financial transactions of a free people.\u201d\n\nAccording to the CATO institute, 74% of Americans are against using CBDCs in place of dollars. Support for Bitcoin may increase as a result of people\u2019s opposition to CBDCs and their desire to elude increasing financial control.\n\nUS Mayors Join Bitcoin Payment Trend\n\nFollowing the 2021 election season, mayors of Miami and New York City, representing opposing political parties, decided to accept Bitcoin as payment for their salaries. Several other mayors were spurred to follow suit by this trend.\n\nTwo additional mayors have followed suit after Miami Mayor, Francis Suarez, and New York City Mayor, Eric Adams, declared they would accept their future paychecks in Bitcoin. Jane Castor of Tampa, Florida, and Scott Conger of Jackson, Tennessee, have similar plans for their next city payment.\n\nA group of politicians are attempting to establish their towns as genuine Bitcoin hubs in the United States as a result of game theory, which is increasing the rate and volume of mayors converting their payments into Bitcoin.\n\nWhile state law prohibits the @CityofJacksonTN from paying me in Bitcoin, I\u2019ll follow the lead of @FrancisSuarez & @ericadamsfornyc and instantly convert my next paycheck to #Bitcoin \u2014 Mayor Scott Conger (@MayorConger) November 5, 2021\n\nAccording to the mayor, everyone can receive payment in Bitcoin; all they need to do is purchase Bitcoin with their entire wage as soon as it arrives. Since Tennessee law prohibits the city of Jackson from paying him directly in Bitcoin, he can still convert his wage into Bitcoin.\n\nThe Mayor of Tampa likewise expressed her readiness to embrace the same approach, indicating her willingness to join the group of U.S. mayors receiving their payments in Bitcoin.\n\nApologies for coming late to the conversation \u2013 we've been busy preparing for today's cryptocurrency conference here in the @CityofTampa . \ud83e\ude99\ud83d\ude0f But I'm certainly up for the challenge! #ForbesTopEmergingTechnologyCity #FloridasTechCapitol #TechTown \u2014 Jane Castor (@JaneCastor) November 5, 2021\n\nOther Lawmakers To Join BTC Battle\n\nProponents like Cruz anticipate that more lawmakers will join the battle to support Bitcoin as more people start to recognizeBitcoin its worth in the face of this escalating threat. Washington might hold onto its unyielding beliefs up until that point.\n\nAs Bitcoin continues to gain prominence and considering the importance of the young voter demographic, it will be intriguing to observe how presidential candidates\u2019 positions on cryptocurrency develop and whether they will have an impact on the 2024 American Presidential election.\n\nIt is crucial to closely monitor this, as the legal framework, policies, and regulations will hold significant consequences for the cryptocurrency as an asset class, America\u2019s position in the global economy, and the future of finance."

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nA man who lost an estimated \u00a3165m of cryptocurrency thrown into a landfill by mistake has unveiled his latest plan to try and get the money back.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried for 10 years to be nice, now we need to go to battle\u201d, James Howells explains as he outlines the next step in his fight with a council to find the hard drive that houses the digital fortune.\n\nThe IT systems engineer has spent a decade trying to convince Newport City Council to help him search for the device that was accidentally thrown away in 2013, but it has repeatedly refused to allow him access to the site.\n\nSo in a last roll of the dice, the 37-year-old has retained a legal team who have written to the local authority this week asking for legal access to the site. If successful, he hopes to employ mechanical arms powered by AI (artificial intelligence) to sift through the site to find the drive.\n\nThe bizarre saga started in 2013 when Mr Howells, put the hardware from an old laptop that contained 8,000 bitcoins, the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency, in a black bag in his hallway.\n\n\u201cI was doing a clear-out in my office and put a lot of items into a bag which I then placed at the front door of my house,\u201d he said. \u201cI woke up the next morning and my ex-partner had already taken the bags to the landfill site; she thought she was doing me a favour, it wasn\u2019t her fault.\u201d\n\nAfter the unintentional error, the cryptocurrency expert hatched a plan to get back his lost millions by getting together a crack team of environmental health and data recovery experts.\n\nAs part of the plan, his team would utilise AI to operate a mechanical arm in sorting the mounds of rubbish. Each piece of detritus would then be sifted through by hand in a nearby pop-up tent.\n\nSecurity had been considered by the IT systems engineer who wanted to utilise robot dogs to make sure opportunistic thieves could not steal his discarded hard drive.\n\nMr Howells outside the landfill site in Docks Way where he believes his hard drive full of cryptocurrency is buried (Wales News Service)\n\nBut despite his schemes, there remains a stumbling block. The local council refuses to give permission to access the landfill site, despite Mr Howells saying he would cover any costs related to the search.\n\n\u201cOver the last 10 years I\u2019ve always tried to engage with Newport City Council in a businesslike manner, they are the site owner, they are the operator, they own the permit for the landfill, so I\u2019ve always wanted to be friends with them and work with them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd to do that I\u2019ve always tried to build a bigger, better team to try and impress them and finally engage with me.\u201d\n\nHowever, his requests to meet with the council\u2019s senior leadership were not successful, so he has now taken the next step in his fight and retained a legal team.\n\nIf Mr Howells does manage to recover his lost millions, he wants to turn Newport into the UK\u2019s first \u201ccrypto hub\u201d and gift its 160,000 residents \u00a350 in bitcoin each. A city council report in 2021 found that a quarter of areas in Newport were in the most deprived 10 per cent in Wales.\n\n\u201cThe idea is then people will have to learn how to use bitcoin, and that will then help them themselves going forward in the future,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe will also set up a blockchain education centre in Newport city centre which will be open with a five-year commitment where anybody can come in face to face and have a sit-down\u2026 it\u2019s scary going on a phone to learn about crypto but if you have somebody face to face to teach you and show you to ropes, so to speak, it\u2019ll be a little bit easier.\u201d\n\nMr Howells is now speaking to lawyers about how to progress his case (Wales News Service)\n\nHe also wants to install crypto point-of-sale devices in all the independent stores in Newport, so the local community \u201ccan use the coins and we can get a crypto economy going in South Wales\u201d.\n\nMr Howells\u2019s legal team wrote to the council on 6 September asking for access to the site and it has two weeks to respond, before a possible escalation in the courts.\n\n\u201cUntil the door is fully slammed shut by a court, then I will continue trying, as I have over the last 10 years ... the court is the last step for me, I am no longer asking Newport City Council for access, I am now going to be asking a judge for access.\u201d\n\nThe price of bitcoin fluctuates but the value of Mr Howells\u2019s coins at the time of writing was \u00a3165m.\n\nA spokesperson for the authority said: \u201cNewport City Council has been contacted multiple times since 2013 about the possibility of retrieving a piece of IT hardware said to contain bitcoins, which may or may not be in our landfill site.\n\n\u201cThe council has told Mr Howells multiple times that excavation is not possible under our environmental permit, and that work of that nature would have a huge negative environmental impact on the surrounding area.\n\n\u201cThe council is the only body authorised to carry out operations on the site.\n\n\u201cWe have been very clear and consistent in our responses that we cannot assist Mr Howells in this matter. Our position has not changed.\n\n\u201cWe will be offering no further comments on this issue as it takes up valuable officer time which could be spent on delivering services for the residents of Newport.\u201d"

Markets for digital currencies such as Bitcoin (BTC -3.71%) were virtually unheard of in 2012, but it has since grown into a massive industry.\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool\n\nThe cryptocurrency sector reached a peak market value of $3 trillion in fall 2021. The sudden surge in value and rapid evolution created immense wealth for early crypto investors. As a result, there is huge interest in finding and investing in the next cryptocurrency unicorn. With more than 20,000 different cryptocurrencies on the market -- and the world having been pushed further into the digital realm by the COVID-19 pandemic -- investing in technologies linking the digital blockchain space with society could be even more lucrative than guessing which token will become the next Bitcoin or Ethereum (ETH -3.52%). And there is no shortage of innovative companies trying to bridge the gap between the two.\n\nDigital currency companies hold major potential The original idea behind blockchain technology -- a digital ledger that automatically tracks transactions between parties and confirms ownership of a crypto asset -- was to create a borderless, peer-to-peer electronic cash payment system that's efficient and secure. Investors can certainly purchase cryptos themselves, perhaps by buying small amounts of several different cryptocurrencies. But a better way to gain exposure to the sector is to invest in bigger and more established companies that benefit from the increased popularity of blockchain and crypto assets. The revenue that crypto service providers are deriving from blockchain tech has explosively grown over the past few years. Companies that adopt blockchain technology, especially in finance, may gain a considerable edge over traditional competitors in processing payments. And brokers offering digital assets may attract more customers than exchanges offering traditional assets such as stocks and bonds. However, the sector is subject to sharp market swings. Its peak value of $3 trillion slipped to less than $1 trillion in June 2022 as rising inflation drove many investors away from high-risk investments. This was not the crypto market's first gigantic plunge, and it probably won't be the last. Every investment is subject to risks, and you should only invest money you don't need in the short term. That guidance is even more important in the highly volatile crypto sector. In keeping with that guidance, here are some of the best cryptocurrency stocks to consider:\n\n1. Coinbase Global Coinbase Global (COIN -8.6%), a top cryptocurrency trading exchange, made its initial public offering (IPO) in April 2021. The company is a popular platform for purchasing major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano (ADA -0.93%), allowing users to trade more than 250 altcoins. The Coinbase platform\u2019s success has been contingent on the increase in crypto prices, which in turn has led to millions of new users creating accounts. Coinbase earns a small transaction fee whenever someone buys or sells a cryptocurrency. But the company aspires to be more than just a place to trade. It also sponsors a debit card that allows consumers to spend from the balance in their digital wallet, and it\u2019s launched a cloud platform for companies using and storing digital currencies. Coinbase offers two game-changing innovations. The first is bringing the practice of asset loans -- which were previously only available to affluent investors -- to the masses. Users can pledge their Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as collateral and receive a low-interest loan to cover expenses. Using crypto as collateral means investors don\u2019t have to sell their assets when emergencies arise, allowing their principal to continue compounding while they deal with matters at hand. The second innovation is the rising adoption of Coinbase\u2019s blockchain analytics by governments and financial institutions. Because most blockchains operate on a public ledger, the company can harness and monitor the data for illicit transactions and wallet addresses. Suppose hackers managed to break through an individual's computer and demand ransom in the form of Bitcoin to unlock the machine. In that case, Coinbase could then match the hacker's wallet address with millions of know-your-customer (KYC) data points stored on its platform. This could help law enforcement track down the flow of funds and apprehend the cybercriminals -- building greater trust in the crypto space.\n\n[Cryptocurrency] is a new asset class, but like real estate, there's only so much Earth. So it's defined, and therefore this moving price of the commodity is just how much, within this finite class of a commodity, this new asset class, how much people value it or want it. David Gardner, co-founder, The Motley Fool\n\n2. Block and PayPal Holdings At the heart of every digital payment protocol is the absence of central intermediaries (and therefore, lower costs for businesses and consumers). So Block (SQ -4.98%) (formerly Square) and PayPal (PYPL 2.05%) saw a meaningful business opportunity in enabling users to purchase and hold cryptocurrencies within a digital wallet. In late 2017, Block\u2019s Cash App consumer-facing application began allowing Bitcoin trading. In 2020 and 2021, Bitcoin was a huge revenue generator for Block, although the trading feature did little to help the company\u2019s bottom line. However, the company is helping to foster the use of Bitcoin among its business users (through the Block ecosystem), and it could become a top platform for crypto transactions between companies and their customers. This is especially promising for disrupting traditional international transactions in which banks often charge hefty foreign exchange fees. Cash App added support for the Bitcoin Lightning network in April 2022, allowing customers to transfer Bitcoin much faster and without transaction fees. CEO Jack Dorsey said the feature will \u201cincrease the usability of Bitcoin all toward an open global monetary transmission network the world can trust.\u201d PayPal\u2019s Venmo digital wallet and peer-to-peer payments app, which unlocked crypto trading in early 2021, offer a similar mix of simple banking features and mass-market crypto-trading tools. At the launch, Venmo supported the trading of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash (BCH -0.46%), Ethereum, and Litecoin (LTC -2.56%). With the most users of any peer-to-peer money movement app, Venmo could become a leading cryptocurrency platform with its new feature. It serves as a solid access point for investors who wish to buy major cryptocurrencies and then use them to purchase altcoins or access decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. 3. Canaan and Hut 8 Mining Bitcoin mining has changed dramatically over the past few years. These days, companies such as Canaan (CAN -6.57%) design high-powered, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) machines specifically for the purpose of brute-force guessing the network's correct hash (passcode). Canaan's next-generation Avalon ASICs can make tens of trillions of guesses every second for the right hash to validate blocks on the Bitcoin network, which is millions of times more powerful than AMD (AMD -1.79%) and Nvidia's (NVDA -4.45%) latest graphics processing units (GPUs) for this hyper-specific purpose. Sales have been skyrocketing due to the device's affordability and relatively low energy consumption, meaning greater profits for miners. One of the most popular Bitcoin mining stocks is Hut 8 Mining (NASDAQ:HUT). The company, based in Canada, commands a sizable minority stake on the overall Bitcoin network, and it generates very strong cash flows compared to revenue. Instead of selling the Bitcoin it mines on the market, Hut 8 Mining maximizes returns for shareholders by lending them out and farming yields, leading to compounded returns. Furthermore, investors can be assured that environmental concerns regarding the practice won't hold the company back. Hut 8 Mining uses a mix of wind, solar, and natural gas sources for its electricity, with decade-long leases.\n\n4. Nvidia and AMD Chipmakers Nvidia and AMD don\u2019t deal with cryptocurrencies directly, but the two semiconductor companies are the leading designers of graphics processing units (GPUs). Best known for powering high-end video game graphics, GPUs now enable computing-intensive applications such as data centers, artificial intelligence, and the creation of crypto assets. Cryptography and blockchain creation require immense computational power, and GPUs are well-suited for the job. Back in 2018, booming cryptocurrency prices were a driving force for Nvidia and AMD stock price increases as digital currency miners (people using their computers to create new units of digital assets) scrambled to purchase GPUs for the task. GPUs remain a fundamental piece of hardware for creating and managing crypto assets. Nvidia even launched a new lineup of chips specifically for crypto mining in early 2021. Both Nvidia and AMD look to further cement their positions as leaders in chip technology through acquisitions. Nvidia recently tried to purchase ARM Holdings, which licenses chip architecture design for data centers and smartphones, and AMD wanted to acquire field-programmable chip leader Xilinx. Nvidia had to give up on its ARM deal, but AMD completed its Xilinx buyout in February 2022. With or without the acquisitions, Nvidia and AMD are poised to continue taking market share of the semiconductor industry and are leading the way in developing more emerging technologies such as blockchain ledgers. 5. Meta Platforms and Shopify Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META -0.2%) attempted to develop a new cryptocurrency called Diem (formerly Libra). Diem was envisioned as a global financial payment and infrastructure platform accessible to everyone, including almost one-third of the global population without bank accounts. The project had some setbacks, including losing Visa (V 0.43%), Mastercard (MA 0.76%), and PayPal from its consortium of high-profile members. Government regulators expressed skepticism about Diem since cryptocurrency is still largely unregulated, and Meta eventually sold its control of Diem for $200 million. Nevertheless, work on the project is continuing under the new ownership, and Meta is reportedly considering different options for entering the cryptocurrency market. The company certainly wants to control part of the blockchain infrastructure behind its ambitious Metaverse vision. E-commerce infrastructure and software provider Shopify (SHOP -0.86%) allows merchants using its platform to accept cryptocurrencies as payment. It recently deepened its capability by integrating with cryptocurrency payments processor CoinPayments. In the spring of 2020, Meta\u2019s Facebook Shops was announced as a new offering for small business e-commerce, with Shopify as a third-party software provider powering the new online stores. Together, Meta and Shopify are primed to benefit if the adoption of digital assets continues among small businesses and entrepreneurs.\n\n6. Robinhood Markets Robinhood Markets (HOOD 6.85%) is a popular discount brokerage app that allows users to buy stocks, options, rare metals, and now, cryptocurrencies. Investors can buy and sell more than a dozen cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin (DOGE 2.53%), commission-free on the platform 24/7. The company already holds billions of dollars in crypto assets under custody, with crypto trading revenue now comprising a significant portion of overall sales. Robinhood can combine its commission-free model with scaling the number of cryptocurrencies on the platform, gaining a massive competitive advantage over both traditional and decentralized exchanges. The company also could offer the same crypto analytics services as Coinbase to further promote trust in the sector and boost its adoption. 7. CME Group CME Group (CME -0.52%) operates the world\u2019s largest financial derivatives exchange allowing investors to trade futures, which bet on the future price of an asset, and options, which grant investors the option to sell or buy an asset in the future at a predetermined price. CME Group's exchange trades a diverse assortment of assets, including agricultural and mining products, energy, stocks, and currencies. It\u2019s the latter that makes CME Group a crypto stock. At the end of 2017, CME established the first market for Bitcoin futures. At the start of 2020, the company created a market for options on Bitcoin futures. As of March 2022, Ether (units of the crypto platform Ethereum) also had futures available on the exchange. Both Ether and Bitcoin futures were joined by micro futures this year, based on smaller slices of the underlying cryptocurrencies. Establishing a full-featured exchange for derivatives of the best-known cryptocurrencies has given Bitcoin and Ethereum some extra legitimacy and provided a way for digital currency owners (both individuals and a growing list of businesses that accept cryptocurrencies as payment) to mitigate risk from changes in cryptocurrency prices. Cryptocurrency derivatives are still a small market for CME Group, but adding more exchanges for crypto assets in the future is possible -- and even likely.\n\nRelated crypto topics\n\nThe beauty of crypto stocks The best part about cryptocurrency stocks is that most of them are not pure plays on the industry, giving investors the reward of ample diversification. Cryptocurrencies are quite volatile and can cause wild swings in the revenue and earnings of companies with sector exposure. The crypto realm is rapidly gaining mainstream adoption. In August 2021, United Wholesale Mortgage (UWMC -1.3%), the second-largest mortgage lender in the U.S., announced it would accept Bitcoin to settle mortgage payments from its customers. Expect further momentum in crypto stocks as more companies join in the blockchain revolution. At the same time, you need to keep an eye on the evolving regulatory framework while the crypto market adapts to the ever-changing global economy. The stocks mentioned above are smart investments in digital currencies, and most of them come with the benefit of also running significant business operations outside the crypto sector. As such, many investors find that they make more sense than buying the cryptocurrencies themselves, at least until regulators and governments around the world have nailed down their long-term approach to digital assets."

The protocol was released in April after the introduction of the Bitcoin Request for Comment (BRC-20) token standard, which allowed users to issue transferable tokens directly through the network. That quickly spurred a collection of digital artwork and meme tokens built on Bitcoin in the weeks afterward."

Discover SCENE\n\nEarn a free on-chain NFT by taking our free course, Crypto Investing: Fundamentals First. Decrypt will cover gas fees for the first 10,000 mints!\n\nOrdinals are taking Bitcoin by storm. Ordinal Inscriptions, similar to NFTs, are digital assets inscribed on a satoshi, the lowest denomination of a Bitcoin (BTC). Inscribing on satoshis, named after the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, is possible thanks to the Taproot upgrade launched on the Bitcoin network on November 14, 2021.\n\nWhat is an Ordinal Inscription?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin developers have worked to bring non-fungible tokens or NFTs to the number one blockchain for nearly a decade, beginning in 2014 with Counterparty, the creators of the Rare Pepe NFT collection, followed by Stacks in 2017. The Inscription process writes or inscribes the data of the content stored into the witness of the Bitcoin transaction. The witness was introduced in the SegWit upgrade to the Bitcoin network in 2017.\n\n\u201cWhat the team came up with Ordinals is genius,\u201d Alex Miller, CEO of Hiro, a developer for layer-2 smart contract platform Stacks, told Decrypt in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s super core to the Bitcoin ethos in that they basically took several different things and pieced them together in a way the original creators did not foresee or expect.\u201d\n\nThe first step in the creation of Ordinals is users downloading Bitcoin Core and syncing the node to the blockchain. After the sync is completed, the next step is to create an Ordinals wallet and send some satoshis to the wallet.\n\nHow did we get to this point?\n\nLaunched in 2017, Segregated Witness or SegWit fixed a host of bugs in Bitcoin Core, allowing more transactions per block, and laid the groundwork for Layer 2 payment channels like the Bitcoin Lightning Network. SegWit caused heated debate in the Bitcoin community and led to a hardfork of the network resulting in the launch of rival blockchains, Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Satoshi\u2019s Vision, also known as Bitcoin SV.\n\nWhile detractors may view Ordinals as abusing the network, Ordinals developer Casey Rodarmor says these claims are unfounded.\n\nWith Taproot, all parties in a transaction can cooperate to make these complex transactions look like standard, person-to-person transactions. They do so by combining their public keys to create a new public key and combining their signatures to create a new signature. It does this through a device called Schnorr signatures.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Taproot upgrade also scrambles transactions with single and multiple signatures, making it more challenging to identify transaction inputs on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. Taproot enhances privacy while reducing the amount of data needed to make them, lowering transaction costs that have become much higher as Bitcoin has become more popular.\n\n\u201cOne thing that people don\u2019t understand is that in order for Bitcoin to be secure, blocks must be full. That is part of the coin security model,\u201d Rodarmor told Decrypt in an interview. \u201cIf blocks are not full, then nobody has any reason to pay more than the minimum fee rate to have their transactions included in a block. So, as a result, blocks must be full.\u201d\n\nOrdinals can be a complicated process due to the size of the Bitcoin blockchain and the need to use the Command Line (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux).\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Ordinals?\n\nThe race is on to develop more seamless methods of inscribing on Bitcoin and wallets that make it possible to view the Bitcoin NFT once it is created.\n\nLooking to create a seamless way for collectors to create Ordinal Inscriptions, Gamma, a Bitcoin NFT marketplace on Stacks, began offering a paid service that allows users to inscribe images and text. Other projects providing this service include Oridalsbot from the creators of the Satoshibles NFT collection.\n\nSo you want a Bitcoin ordinal? Start with a Bitcoin full node, then install\u2026\u2026no, no. For the past year, we\u2019ve focused on making the best creator tools possible. Today, we\u2019re launching no-code ordinal inscriptions to anyone with a BTC address. \ud83d\udd17 https://t.co/WQzKZUWMw1 \u2014 Gamma.io (@trygamma) February 9, 2023\n\nHiro Systems announced Tuesday it is rolling out support for Odinals on its Hiro Wallet, and on Wednesday, Xverse, a Bitcoin-based web wallet, also launched support for Bitcoin NFTs.\n\nWe\u2019ve begun rolling out support to Hiro Wallet for Bitcoin, NFTs and Ordinals for a truly cross-protocol Bitcoin Web3 experience. https://t.co/OAVriTraFq \ud83e\uddf5 A thread with details\u2026 #bitcoin #web3 #stx #nfts #ordinals pic.twitter.com/SiWrIluFhk \u2014 Mark Hendrickson | mark.btc | Hiro Wallet (@markymark) February 14, 2023"

        "content": "Linekong Interactive, a gaming and film production company headquartered in Beijing and listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (HKEX), is allocating $15 million to invest in projects building on the Bitcoin network.\n\nWang Fang, the founder of Linekong, said in a Nov. 8 tweet that the fund, dubbed \u201cBTC Next,\u201d will be used to accelerate emerging projects in the Bitcoin ecosystem, including \u201casset issuance protocols, trading markets, expansion, virtual machines, NFT, RWA, and GameFi.\u201d\n\nFor initial efforts, the firm would \u201cparticipate in the research and investment of Bitcoin network ecological assets as early as possible,\u201d publish its investment portfolios, and update the list of Bitcoin ecological crypto assets. \u201cThe panoramic curtain of the Bitcoin network ecology has slowly unfolded,\u201d BTC Next wrote. Traditionally, Bitcoin lacked the programmability associated with newer blockchains such as Ethereum, remaining for most periods largely unchanged from its invention in 2008.\n\nHowever, the Bitcoin ecosystem has expanded greatly this year with the invention of Ordinals and Inscriptions, two novel data storage methods that, together, allow users to mint unique digital assets on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIn June, cross-chain wallet BitKeep (now Bitget Wallet) added deposit and withdrawal support for BRC-20 Bitcoin tokens modeled on the Ethereum ERC-20 standard. On Nov. 7, Binance listed popular BRC-20 token Ordinals (ORDI), causing its value to surge more than 40% in a single day. BRC-20 tokens have altogether reached $1.36 billion in market capitalization since their inception.\n\nFounded in 2007 in Beijing as an online gaming firm, Linekong Interactive first went public in Hong Kong in 2014. Before founding Linekong, Wang was a vice president of software development at Kingsoft Software, a Chinese information technology conglomerate.\n\nWang resigned as CEO of Linekong in 2018 to focus on blockchain, founding several projects in the nonfungible tokens, decentralized finance, and Bitcoin mining space. He returned to Linekong as CEO in 2022 after an invitation from the firm\u2019s board of directors to better integrate Linekong products with Web3.\n\nRelated: Swiss crypto bank SEBA gets Hong Kong SFC license"

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin Ordinals transaction volume surged to its highest levels since May on Tuesday, as about $14.7 million worth of the Bitcoin-based assets traded hands, as of this writing, according to a Dune dashboard created by the pseudonymous on-chain data analyst Domo.\n\nLaunched earlier this year, Ordinals enables the creation of NFT-like assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. The protocol lets people assign data to an individual satoshi\u2014equal to 1/100,000,000 of a whole Bitcoin\u2014whether that's art, profile pictures, or text.\n\nThe lion\u2019s share of trading volume on Tuesday took place on the cryptocurrency exchange OKX, per Domo\u2019s dashboard. The Seychelles-based exchange rolled out trading support for Ordinals in May and accounted for 6,100 or 60% of daily Ordinals transactions, as of this writing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, Domo\u2019s dashboard does not reflect recent activity on Binance. Crypto\u2019s leading exchange by volume initially rolled out support for image-based Ordinals in May too, but it began letting customers trade ORDI, the first-ever BRC-20 token, on Tuesday.\n\nAs of this writing, the Bitcoin-based token\u2019s price has increased 124% over the past day to $13.21, more than doubling its initial price on Binance\u2019s platform of $5.91, according to the exchange\u2019s website. Across all exchanges, $471 million ORDI has traded hands over the past day, according to CoinGecko.\n\nIn addition to renewed interest from Bitcoin\u2019s recent climb toward $35,000, Charlie Spears of Bitcoin mining firm Luxor Technologies told Decrypt that Binance\u2019s move to support ORDI \u201csent everything flying\u201d that\u2019s related to Ordinals, whether that resembles a fungible token or JPEG.\n\n\u201cBinance alone dwarfs that of the entire Ordinals trading volume across all marketplaces,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have the fungible token side of Ordinals, and then you have the NFT, JPEG side of Ordinals, and they tend to go in tandem.\u201d\n\nPioneered by the aforementioned Domo, BRC-20 tokens take inspiration from Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 standard, which is used across a plethora of tokens, such as Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin. Domo issued the first BRC-20 token, ORDI, initially as an experiment in March.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDomo did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.\n\nOrdinals creator Casey Rodarmor took to Twitter to address Binance\u2019s support of ORDI, clarifying the token\u2019s connection to the protocol. He said the exchange mistakenly called Domo\u2019s token \u201cOrdinals\u201d and incorrectly linked to ordinals.com as ORDI\u2019s \u201cOfficial Website.\u201d\n\n\u201cORDI is not associated with the Ordinals project,\u201d Rodarmor said. \u201cI hope this gets fixed soon.\u201d\n\nI hope this gets fixed soon. ORDI is not associated with the Ordinals project, The Open Ordinals Institute, or The Ordicord. Those links should be removed, and the token should not be named \"Ordinals\". The name of the token is ORDI. If anyone has any contacts at Binance they\u2026 https://t.co/vR9cneIPBk \u2014 Casey (@rodarmor) November 7, 2023\n\nThe uptick in Ordinals transaction volume also comes as the NFT market shows signs of life. While the industry found itself in the crosshairs of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d during a segment dedicated to NFTs on Sunday night, NFT trading volume hit a three-month high the following day.\n\nIn May, Ordinals activity sparked concern among some Bitcoiners, as transaction fees climbed to at least 654 sat/vB, or around $26, for high-priority transactions. On Tuesday, high-priority transactions commanded a rate of 98 sat/vB, or around $5, according to mempool.space.\n\nInfluential NFT firms like Bored Ape Yacht Club maker Yuga Labs have leveraged Ordinals to mint art on Bitcoin, but the protocol\u2019s momentum was bolstered in the first half of this year by fervor for BRC-20s. With Binance\u2019s move, that continues to be the case, Spears said.\n\n\u201cWe were losing momentum from the BRC-20 mayhem that peaked in May and kind of subsided into August,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the BRC-20s go flying when one gets listed on Binance, then it has knock-off effects to the broader Bitcoin NFT ecosystem.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

Crypto tokens posted big gains following the completion of one year of Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire- FTX exchange.\n\nBitcoin was trading in red as the largest crypto token edged marginally lower, less than half-a-per cent but remained below 35,000-levels. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, was also seen in green, slightly up and hovered around $1,900-level. Majority of the altcoins were trading with decent gains.\n\nBitcoin kept on trading in a very narrow range of less than 2 per cent movement in the last 24 hours. It has now been close to two weeks. Although this means volumes in Bitcoin worldwide have started to slightly drop, any movement in its prices should mean the volumes are back in, said Shubham Hudda, Senior Manager at CoinSwitch Markets Desk.\n\n\"While BTC has been rising for a few weeks now, the ETH/BTC pair has seemed to find a little support around the 0.05 BTC per ETH mark. The little bounce back has helped other prominent altcoins as well to show some momentum on the upside price action,\" he said.\n\nOn the other hand, altcoin BLUR (+18.1%) has seen a positive price action in the last 24 hours. This could be as investors speculate it to be the world\u2019s biggest NFT marketplace by trading volumes, especially after Opensea downsized by letting go of 50% of its staff recently\n\nBarring a few exceptions, all top crypto tokens were trading sharply higher on Tuesday. Chainlink was up 6 per cent, while Toncoin surged more than 5 per cent. Dogecoin and Polygon rose 4 per cent each, while Cardano and BNB added over 3 per cent each. Among the laggards, Tron was down a per cent.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading modestly higher, rising up to $1.33 trillion-mark, as it rose marginally in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes increased more than 6 per cent to $40.46 billion.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, both BTC and ETH remained steady, while altcoins saw a rise of 5-10 per cent. This was accompanied by a decline in BTC dominance. Bitcoin is currently positioned between important support at $34,000 and resistance at $36,000, while Ethereum still has to clear a significant resistance level around $2,000, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\n\"The market capitalization of altcoins, excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, reached nearly $400 billion, marking a positive sign for the crypto space. It's worth noting that tomorrow, on November 8, 2023, Fed Chair Powell will deliver a speech, which could potentially introduce some market volatility,\" he said.\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\nTech View by WazirX Trade Desk\n\nThe Graph(GRT) is an indexing protocol, catering to data querying needs in networks such as Ethereum and IPFS.

        "title": "A Complete Timeline of Bitcoin Price Trends - Blockchain Council",
        "content": "The world of cryptocurrencies has been nothing short of a rollercoaster ride since the inception of Bitcoin in 2009. Bitcoin\u2019s price has witnessed remarkable highs, gut-wrenching lows, and everything in between. Understanding the evolution of Bitcoin\u2019s price trends is not only an intriguing journey through the history of digital currency but also a valuable exercise for anyone interested in the crypto market.\n\nIn this article, we embark on a comprehensive exploration of the price trends that have defined Bitcoin\u2019s existence, from its humble beginnings to its current status as a global financial phenomenon. So, let\u2019s start our journey through the complete timeline of Bitcoin\u2019s price trends.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Complete Price History\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price history is a fascinating journey marked by incredible highs, swift declines, and significant events that have shaped its trajectory. Here\u2019s an in-depth analysis:\n\n2009-2010: The Early Days\n\nBitcoin emerged in 2009 with virtually no monetary value. It was an experimental concept more than a financial asset. In 2010, we witnessed the first real-world transaction with Bitcoin, where 10,000 BTC bought two pizzas. This era marks Bitcoin\u2019s shift from an abstract idea to a commodity with tangible value. By the end of 2010, Bitcoin\u2019s value had just begun to register, hitting around $0.3.\n\n2011: The First Peak and Crash\n\n2011 was a rollercoaster for Bitcoin. It began the year under $1 but soared to $29.6 by June, driven by growing interest and speculation. This was Bitcoin\u2019s first significant spike, reflecting its potential as a digital currency. However, it couldn\u2019t sustain these levels and plummeted to $4.7 by year-end, marking its first major crash, likely due to market corrections and uncertainties about its practicality and security.\n\n2012: Steady Growth\n\n2012 was relatively calm for Bitcoin. The year was characterized by gradual growth, devoid of the extreme volatility seen in 2011. It wasn\u2019t yet catching mainstream attention, but there was a slow and steady accumulation, with its price inching up by a few dollars across the year.\n\n2013: Breakthrough and Volatility\n\nIn 2013, Bitcoin began to capture wider attention. Starting at around $13.3, it saw exponential growth, first crossing $100 in April and then $200 by October. This surge was due to growing awareness and acceptance of Bitcoin as a viable digital asset. However, the year ended with extreme volatility, with Bitcoin hitting over $1,000 in November and then dropping to about $805 by year-end.\n\n2014-2015: Regulatory Challenges and Recovery\n\nThese years were marked by regulatory challenges and the Mt. Gox scandal, which greatly affected Bitcoin\u2019s price. The price fluctuated, reflecting the market\u2019s reaction to these events, but by the end of 2015, Bitcoin had started to recover, indicating growing resilience against external shocks.\n\n2016: Gradual Uptrend\n\n2016 was a year of gradual growth for Bitcoin, with the price climbing steadily over the year. Starting at around $450, it experienced a slow but consistent increase, ending the year just under $1,000. This uptrend indicated a growing acceptance of Bitcoin as both a digital currency and a potential investment vehicle.\n\n2017: The Meteoric Rise\n\n2017 was a landmark year for Bitcoin, with its price skyrocketing. Starting just under $1,000, it experienced unprecedented growth throughout the year, reaching nearly $20,000 in December. This surge was driven by a frenzy of retail investment and media hype, marking Bitcoin\u2019s arrival in the mainstream financial world.\n\n2018: The Great Correction\n\nFollowing the euphoric rise in 2017, 2018 was a year of correction. Bitcoin\u2019s price plummeted throughout the year, dropping by about 73%. This decline was a response to the previous year\u2019s rapid ascent and was compounded by regulatory concerns and market saturation with new cryptocurrencies.\n\n2019: Finding Stability\n\nIn 2019, Bitcoin\u2019s price showed signs of stabilizing. It hovered around $3,000 to $4,000 for much of the year before seeing a mid-year surge above $10,000. This stability indicated that despite its volatility, Bitcoin was maturing as an asset class.\n\n2020: Pandemic and Price Surge\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic initially caused a sharp decline in Bitcoin\u2019s price. However, it quickly rebounded, largely due to investor perception of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. By the end of 2020, Bitcoin had reached around $29,000, showcasing its resilience and growing appeal in uncertain times.\n\n2021: Record Highs and Volatility\n\nBitcoin\u2019s volatile nature was on full display in 2021. It started the year strongly, breaking past $40,000 in January and reaching over $60,000 by April. However, it also experienced significant drops, particularly in the summer, but it managed to reach an all-time high of around $68,789 in November. The year was marked by increased institutional interest and mainstream acceptance, but also heightened regulatory scrutiny.\n\n2022: The Crypto Winter\n\n2022 was a challenging year, with Bitcoin\u2019s price experiencing a significant decline, dropping below $20,000 by year-end. This downturn, termed the \u201ccrypto winter,\u201d was influenced by broader economic factors, including inflation concerns and geopolitical tensions.\n\nThe crypto winter of 2022 was a period of prolonged decline in the prices of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC). It began in November 2021, when BTC reached an all-time high of nearly $69,000. By the end of December 2022, BTC had fallen to around $17,000, a loss of over 75%.\n\nThis crypto winter was caused by a confluence of factors. First, central banks worldwide began raising interest rates in late 2021 to combat inflation. This made risky assets like cryptocurrencies less attractive to investors. Furthermore, ongoing geopolitical instability, including the war in Ukraine and other tensions, contributed to market volatility and risk aversion.\n\nGovernments around the world also played a significant role by cracking down on cryptocurrencies in 2022. They cited concerns about fraud, money laundering, and investor protection as reasons for increased regulation. Moreover, several high-profile crypto projects failed in 2022, such as the TerraUSD stablecoin and the Celsius Network lending platform. These failures eroded investor confidence in the crypto market.\n\nThe impact of the crypto winter extended far beyond price declines. Many crypto companies were forced to lay off employees and cut costs to survive the harsh market conditions. Some crypto projects ceased to exist altogether. The global cryptocurrency market capitalization fell dramatically from over $3 trillion in November 2021 to less than $850 billion in December 2022.\n\nOver 2,000 crypto projects failed during this tumultuous year. Additionally, the number of unique active crypto addresses decreased by over 40%, highlighting the reduced participation of users. Daily crypto transactions also saw a significant drop, falling by over 50%, underlining the diminished trading and investment activity in the market.\n\n2023: Recovery and Resilience\n\nIn 2023, Bitcoin showed signs of recovery, starting at $16,605 and rising consistently throughout the year. As of October, it was trading around $34,154, indicating a resurgence in investor confidence and a renewed interest in cryptocurrencies as a whole. The upwards price movement is expected to continue till December 2023 and beyond.\n\nAlso Read- Bitcoin Sees Massive Price Surge: Here\u2019s What Led To Its Rise"

        "content": "The co-founders of a top crypto data analytics firm say that a reliable Bitcoin (BTC) indicator is signaling bullish moves for BTC.\n\nGlassnode co-founders Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, who share the Negentropic handle on the social media platform X, tell their followers that BTC\u2019s market demand is outpacing its supply.\n\nAdditionally, the Bitcoin network recently saw 700,000 new addresses created in just one day, which the analysts say is one of the top indicators for future price movements.\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s market demand has outpaced its supply, a clear sign of robust positive momentum.\n\nIn just one day, a whopping 700,000 new BTC addresses joined the network. This expansion is considered one of the most reliable indicators for price predictions.\n\nWith fewer BTC coins currently in circulation, buyers might need to increase their bids to have their orders executed promptly.\u201d\n\nIn a further analysis in a blog post, the co-founders say that with BTC moving so fast, buyers will likely be forced to enter the market without waiting for dips, possibly driving the price of BTC up.\n\n\u201cBecause there are fewer BTC coins available right now, purchasers may have to raise their bids to get their orders filled fast. This could unwittingly boost the BTC price above $40,000 soon.\u201d\n\nBTC is worth $34,675 at time of writing.\n\nFollowing up on what\u2019s next for altcoins, the Glassnode co-founders say decentralized finance (DeFi) and layer-1 tokens are blazing a comeback trail.\n\n\u201cAltcoins\u2019 Higher Beta Points to Potential for Elevated Gains Against Bitcoin\u2019s Stability\n\nINTRO: As BTC stabilizes, the spotlight turns to altcoins for potentially higher returns, thanks to their volatility.\n\nMAIN: Solana leads the charge with XRP and Cardano on its heels, showcasing impressive growth and investor interest.\n\nCONCLUSION: This week\u2019s rotation is clear: as BTC and ETH plateau, DeFi and Layer 1 tokens are bouncing back with vigor.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ex-Cantor Executives Start Lending Platform for Anticipated Spot Bitcoin ETFs - BNN Bloomberg",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Several ex-Cantor Fitzgerald executives started a crypto lending platform with the expectation that it will serve operators of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds once they gain US regulatory approval.\n\nDigital Prime Technologies\u2019 Tokenet already lets clients including Xapo Bank lend out digital assets to others, such as EDX Clearing and global institutional credit network Hidden Road Partners, the Jersey City, New Jersey-based company said Tuesday. The setup offers risk-management tools and a chat functionality that lets users manage loans.\n\nThe firm joins a slew of exchanges and other companies, such as Swan Bitcoin, who are launching products to fill a void left by the demise of crypto lenders Genesis, Celsius, BlockFi and others. The crypto lending industry\u2019s collapse last year left market participants with a dearth of options, and helped depress trading volumes into 2023.\n\nThe launch also coincides with rising optimism that an ETF holding Bitcoin directly will be approved in the US within months. If that happens, Digital Prime expects ETF issuers will have a huge thirst for borrowing Bitcoin, and will jump start the fledging crypto-lending industry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a rebirth of crypto lending,\u201d James Runnels, the company\u2019s chief executive officer, said in an interview.\n\nFor example, if authorized participants need to create new inventory in the ETF, but Bitcoin\u2019s price suddenly jumps, they may chose to borrow the cryptocurrency, instead \u2014 and to buy it later at a lower price, Runnels said.\n\nWith ETFs, specialized traders known as authorized participants can work with an issuer to create shares when demand is building. When buyers\u2019 appetites cool, participants redeem those shares with the fund\u2019s sponsor to reduce the supply, keeping the ETF\u2019s price in line with its net-asset value.\n\nRunnels was a managing director at Cantor Fitzgerald, while Digital Prime\u2019s Chief Operating Officer Bob Sherry was COO for Prime Services at Cantor until 2018. Glen Garofalo, head of margin and risk solutions, was managing director of prime services, head of margin, at Cantor, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nDigital Prime\u2019s DLCC Prime subsidiary received Financial Industry Regulatory Authority membership last year, and can operate as a broker-dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Digital Prime received its seed funding from investors including TD Cowen Inc.\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P."
