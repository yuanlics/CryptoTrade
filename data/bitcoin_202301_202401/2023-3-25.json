        "title": "Bitcoin is poised to blow up Africa's $86 billion banking system - CNBC",
        "content": "watch now\n\nACCRA, Ghana \u2014 Block CEO Jack Dorsey and his top brass descended on Accra for the inaugural Africa Bitcoin Conference in December to talk about one of the most potentially disruptive and transformative alternatives to the continent's existing financial system: bitcoin. Since its inception in 2008, this unfamiliar form of money has alternatively been disdained as an absurdly complex toy for libertarian techies, a legalized form of gambling, a speculative bet to get rich quick, and a vehicle for criminals and fraudsters to obscure the origins of their ill-begotten gains. But this parallel financial system can also serve a tangible social good, offering an onramp to the financial system for people who would otherwise be left out. In countries where the vast majority of the population is unbanked, national currencies are no longer a safe store of value, remittances comprise a hefty portion of GDP, and international sanctions complicate connections to the global economy, a virtual currency that doesn't require an intermediary to approve transactions can be a vital lifeline for survival. As cryptocurrency continues to rise in prominence and becomes a growing flashpoint for regulators, Dorsey and his deputies are providing an essential counternarrative: Bitcoin brings financial power to people who would otherwise have none. \"It doesn't matter to me if the price goes down or up, because I can still use bitcoin as a vehicle to move money around the world instantaneously,\" said Mike Brock, the CEO of TBD at Block, a unit which focuses on cryptocurrency and decentralized finance. \"I can exchange dollars for bitcoin and then bitcoin for Brazilian rial. There is a market for bitcoin in every corner of the world today,\" continued Brock.\n\nA broken financial system\n\nMoving money in Africa is an expensive and complicated process. Commercial bank branch access is limited, especially for people living in remote and rural areas. Digital banking options are also limited. Tack on rampant hyperinflation, widespread government corruption, and capital controls trapping domestic cash in banks, and money can stop making sense altogether. \"If someone wants to move money to the country next door, normally, you'd have to fill up a suitcase full of cash and move it over the border,\" explains Ray Youssef, CEO of Paxful. Part of the problem stems from the continent's quasi-colonial payment framework, in which roughly 80% of cross-border payments originating from African banks are processed offshore, mostly in the U.S. or Europe. That translates to higher costs and processing times that are sometimes measured in weeks. Then there's mobile money, which has been around since the early 2000s. Think of it like an electronic wallet tied to a phone number that does not require a smartphone or data to operate. Users can pay bills and shop with their phone through SMS texting, instead of having to rely on traditional banking options. Africa's mobile money transactions rose 39% to more than $700 billion in 2021, according to data from the GSM Association, a non-profit representing mobile network operators worldwide. World Bank data shows that account ownership at a financial institution \u2014 or via a mobile money service provider \u2014 has more than doubled in the last decade, rising to 55% of adults in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nAn employee uses a Nokia 1200 mobile phone inside an M-Pesa store in Nairobi, Kenya, on Sunday, April 14, 2013. Trevor Snap | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nBut even as adoption proliferates, mobile money users don't get the perks of legacy banking, including earning interest on banked savings and building up a credit score based on a history of spending. Interoperability on the continent also remains a major issue with this alternative way of banking. \"The entire banking system in Africa is completely and utterly broken, even amongst the mobile money providers, the telcos,\" said Youssef from Paxful, a peer-to-peer crypto marketplace where users can directly buy and sell tokens with one another. \"Two thousand payment networks and only 2% of them talk to each other. That number continues to grow. It's not getting better, it's actually getting worse,\" continued Youssef. Companies like Western Union and MoneyGram offer an expansive physical network of storefronts around the world designed to move money for those who are unbanked. That cash network was extraordinarily difficult and expensive to build, which is why there aren't a lot of direct competitors. It is also why those cash transfers often incur substantial fees. Bitcoin could eliminate all these intermediaries, allowing citizens to send digital payments directly to one another, without relying on credit and without incurring multiple settlement fees along the way. \"We're going to move to a model where we can make payments without IOUs, or credit, or promises, or fiat,\" said Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer for the Human Rights Foundation, an organization that works with activists from authoritarian regimes around the world. \"It's literally like sending a piece of gold or a $20 bill instantly somewhere else.\" \"If you can get access to the internet, you can settle bitcoin payments,\" said Brock. \"And the government can't do anything about it.\" Dorsey points to the example of what happened in Nigeria during the protests against the brutality of the country's Special Anti-Robbery Squad \u2014 a movement referred to as #EndSARS. \"The Nigerian government went to various bank corps to stop protesters from receiving money \u2014 which bitcoin made up for,\" Dorsey said in Accra. \"So our whole reason for being as a company is solving the same problem that bitcoin will ultimately solve for everyone in the world.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nMoving money on the bitcoin blockchain at its base layer has its own challenges. At times of peak demand, fees will often spike higher, and if a user is unwilling to pay a premium for the transaction, they may have to wait for more blocks of transactions to get confirmed before their transfer goes through. Bitcoin's Lightning Network helps alleviate both of those problems by slashing the cost of transactions to virtually zero and enabling nearly instantaneous cash payments around the planet \u2013 making bitcoin a more effective payment rail. This so-called \"layer two\" technology is built on top of bitcoin's main chain, in part because bitcoiners are conservative about introducing changes to the base layer, for fear of opening it up to hacks or other mischief. Yellow Card \u2014 Africa's largest centralized cryptocurrency exchange run by CEO Chris Maurice \u2014 is also looking to embed this layer two technology into the platform, in order to drive down the price of transactions to virtually zero. Currently, the exchange doesn't charge a commission for transactions, but network fees can be pretty steep when a lot of trades are happening at once. \"It'll have a pretty big impact to our customers, because a lot of them are very price sensitive,\" says Justin Poiroux, the co-founder and CTO of Yellow Card. Yellow Card's plan is still in its infancy, but Poiroux tells CNBC that he thinks the Lightning Network could ultimately provide a lot of value for its retail customers.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Bitnob CEO Bernard Parah and Cash App's crypto product lead, Miles Suter, at the Africa Bitcoin Conference in Accra, Ghana. Bernard Parah\n\nBecause Lightning offers a universal monetary language, money can travel around the world between any Lightning-enabled bitcoin wallet. Someone who uses a platform like Block's Cash App \u2014 a regulated, American financial product with 51 million monthly transacting users which integrated with the Lightning Network in Feb. 2022 \u2014 can pay any Lightning invoice in the world instantly. \"It's a new way of doing business. It's a different paradigm entirely,\" said Gladstein. The crypto product lead at Cash App, Miles Suter, believes that a big part of bitcoin's utility is how it gets around broken and convoluted payment systems that don't talk to each other. \"At Cash App in particular, we've always been really interested in taking bitcoin beyond just being seen as an investment and bringing day-to-day utility to it,\" Suter told CNBC on the sidelines of the Africa Bitcoin Conference. \"In many ways, the people on the African continent are already doing that with the tools they have,\" continued Suter.\n\nSending cash with Lightning\n\nBernard Parah is a 30-year-old entrepreneur living in Jos, Nigeria, about a five hour drive from the capital city of Abuja. He's the CEO of Bitnob, an app that lets users across Africa buy, save, and invest in bitcoin. Bitnob is SMS-based and piggybacks on the mobile money system, making it easier for people to send money directly into bank accounts and mobile money wallets in African countries. Parah recently teamed up with Strike, a Lightning Network payments platform, to launch a feature called \"Send Globally\" that allows Americans to transfer money to people living in Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya. It uses local fiat cash on either side of the transaction, but bitcoin is used under the hood as the pipeline to jump money over the border. The end user never touches the cryptocurrency themselves. \"We're able to settle into bank accounts or mobile money accounts, without the recipients having to interact with bitcoin themselves,\" Parah tells CNBC. \"Over time, we've seen that there are still people who really don't understand how to use bitcoin; who don't care about bitcoin. What they do care about is their problems getting solved,\" continued Parah.\n\nBitnob CEO Bernard Parah and Strike CEO Jack Mallers announcing the launch of 'Send Globally' on stage at the Africa Bitcoin Conference in Accra, Ghana. Bernard Parah\n\nIt feels like a wire transfer or a Venmo payment, according to Strike CEO Jack Mallers. \"It's instant. There's no debt. There's no credit. There's no delays,\" explains Mallers. The model works because Parah and Mallers are willing to take on the liability associated with the transfer by holding cash in escrow on either end of the exchange. Once the money is received in Nigeria, Bitnob \u2014 which is a regulated entity with connections to the local banks \u2014 will take that bitcoin and turn it into their local currency. \"It's just two regulated entities communicating over the language of bitcoin and cutting out excess fees,\" said Suter. \"I think that's revolutionary.\" Mallers says that they offer more competitive foreign exchange rates by using bitcoin as a price-setting intermediary, a sort of new world reserve currency. \"The rate that we got was actually 60% better than the traditional forex market rate,\" said Mallers. \"The way to actually think about how we're achieving forex if we clear through bitcoin is, 'I have dollars. How many bitcoin can I get for my dollars? And then how many naira can I get for my bitcoin?'\" said Mallers. \"It's acting as the most liquid, accessible, global instrument for us to clear and settle value amongst each other,\" he said. The arrangement also offers a few big ancillary benefits, including interoperability with payment apps around the world that have tens of millions of users. Block's Suter explained that Cash App could theoretically interoperate with Bitnob. \"We're only live in the U.S. right now, but that doesn't mean we can't speak to Bitnob in Nigeria and transfer value instantly and for free across these borders,\" Suter said of Cash App.\n\nMeeting customers where they are\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards South African developer Kgothatso Ngako built a custodial lightning wallet called Machankura. Kgothatso Ngako\n\nSouth African developer Kgothatso Ngako, who goes by KG, has integrated the Lightning Network into the GSM network, combining the best of a few worlds, in a larger effort to meet customers where they are. \"My focus is giving people without an internet connection the ability to send or receive bitcoin,\" Ngako said. KG calls his custodial Lightning wallet \"Machankura\" \u2014 South African slang for money. Whereas most Lightning transactions today require a smartphone and data, Ngako's service integrates lightning via Unstructured Supplementary Service Data, or USSD, which is the protocol that mobile money runs on. (It is similar to HTTP, or HyperText Transport Protocol, the protocol on which the web was built.) Ngako tells CNBC that he currently has around 3,000 users spread across eight countries, with a concentration in South Africa, Uganda, Kenya, and Nigeria. In his home market of South Africa, there are strict rules around currency exchange, which make his product even more appealing to some users looking to move their money abroad. \"The South African Reserve Bank regulates the cross-border flow of capital \u2014 including the exchange of currency \u2014 to and from South Africa. You need some form of approval to convert ZAR into foreign currency,\" said Ernest Marais, partner at Johannesburg law firm, Tabacks. KG's Machankura is compatible with any Lightning wallet on the planet. In practice, this means that someone with Cash App in San Francisco, for example, could instantly send bitcoin via Lightning to the phone number of someone with a data-less, basic phone living in a remote part of Uganda. Ngako's project does face some risks, including regulatory blowback. Marais tells CNBC that because the South African Reserve Bank cannot regulate the cross-border flow of cryptocurrency, it is considered to be illegal and a criminal offense \u2014 though crypto regulation largely remains nebulous across most of the continent. \"All African central banks, except for Central African Republic, have made notices stating that they don't issue bitcoin and hence they don't regulate it,\" counters Ngako, adding that a bitcoin transaction cannot be considered a cross-border exchange as bitcoin transactions aren't regulated within the central bank's institution. But the rules are confusing for everyone involved. \"The actual location of crypto assets is an anomaly. At what point does it leave the country?\" continued Marais. Ultimately, Ngako believes that once Machankura begins to scale, it will be a major driver of bitcoin adoption across the continent. To that end, Ngako is raising money and building \u2014 a common refrain among the entrepreneurs on the ground in Accra. As Dorsey said in Africa, \"More and more mass adoption will, in my belief, take away all the oxygen\" from governments attempting to control behavior through financial oppression. \"So what do we do? We build, we build, we build, we build, we build, they can't stop us. And that's what's important.\""

        "title": "Why keeping Bitcoin mining in the U.S. helps the economy and national security\u2014and even the environment - Fortune",
        "content": "Bitcoin mining exists primarily to build a global digital network for storing value without the need for a bank or other intermediary, and for peer-to-peer exchanges. It\u2019s also one of the most environmentally friendly industries in the world.\n\nThe Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance estimates that global Bitcoin mining uses less than 0.2% of the world\u2019s energy production\u2014roughly comparable to all refrigerators in the U.S. and far less than data centers and data networks generally.\n\nIn other words, it uses a very small amount of energy in the grand scheme of things\u2014and nearly 60% of what it does use comes from renewable sources, according to data published by the Chamber of Digital Commerce. Bitcoin mining also helps create a marketplace for intermittent sources such as solar and wind during their off-peak hours.\n\nFurthermore, unlike other data centers, mining facilities can shut down at a moment\u2019s notice during high-demand events such as extreme weather to provide grid stability and prevent the use of fossil-fuel powered peaker plants.\n\nYet the current administration, fringe politicians, and environmental groups are singling out Bitcoin mining by attempting to limit access to energy and imposing or proposing taxes so high the industry will have ever reason to leave the U.S. entirely. And that\u2019s assuming they don\u2019t try to ban it altogether.\n\nThese critics are now citing \u201cmarginal emissions\u201d data, which is merely cherry-picking businesses they don\u2019t like for political reasons, and saying that those businesses use too much energy. To be clear, Bitcoin mining does not emit anything\u2014it requires computers, which use electricity just like any other data center.\n\nTo say these policy proposals and their tortured justifications are misguided would be the kindest possible reading. Their effects would be devastating to the environment, the economy, and U.S. national security.\n\nRelative to other leading Bitcoin mining jurisdictions, the U.S. has an extremely clean energy grid. Texas is a leader in Bitcoin mining and the home of Riot Platforms\u2019 operations, the largest Bitcoin mine in North America. According to the American Clean Power Association, Texas led the nation in renewable energy capacity added in 2021\u2014close to three times that of second-place California.\n\nPushing Bitcoin mining offshore, under the guise of environmentalism, would only mean the U.S. will capture less of Bitcoin\u2019s value, and more mining will happen connected to dirtier energy grids in more hostile parts of the world. For example, Russia is infamous for not only fossil fuel production and its use of energy for political brinksmanship, it\u2019s among world leaders in leaking methane into the atmosphere. It\u2019s already among the top five Bitcoin mining jurisdictions and seeking more market share. Weakening the American Bitcoin mining industry would be an enormous gift to Russia\u2014and increase global carbon emissions.\n\nThat leads to the national security issue. As noted in a recent Justice Department report on cryptocurrencies, America has strong anti-money laundering rules and ensures that as people move Bitcoin value from the network in and out of traditional accounts, it is traceable\u2014nefarious actors can be caught, unlike in other parts of the world. Russia, for example, is a world leader in ransomware attacks and the abuse of cryptocurrency, as well as traditional financial intermediaries. Keeping Bitcoin mining in America means that more value will be captured by highly regulated U.S. companies and law-abiding individuals simply interested in optionality when it comes to storing and transferring value.\n\nBitcoin mining has created thousands of jobs. Riot alone employs approximately 500 people, many in Rockdale, Texas, a community previously suffering from the closure of a large industrial aluminum-smelting plant. Riot is now helping to support a program with the Texas State Technical college to upskill the local workforce with programs in computer repair and programming.\n\nBitcoin mining is a bourgeoning industry that\u2019s good for the environment, the economy, and national security. Attacks from nefarious political forces should be rejected to maintain America\u2019s leadership role in the digital economy.\n\nJason Les is the CEO of Riot Platforms, Inc., the largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining enterprise in North America by market cap. Brian Morgenstern is Riot\u2019s head of public policy and was a senior adviser and deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury from 2017 to 2020.

Litecoin led the winners. U.S. equity futures rose this morning as authorities sought to reassure investors the financial system is sound following bank failures and sharp declines in some lender\u2019s stocks.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin hovers around US$28,000 as banking concerns return. Will it hit US$30,000?\n\nBitcoin rose 1.69% to US$28,026 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, adding 0.37% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency dipped below the US$28,000 resistance level over the weekend, and bounced back above it early on Monday. Trading turned choppy later in the morning and it moved above and below that line.\n\n\u201cTraders are flocking to Bitcoin and similar assets to diversify their holdings. Recent bank failures have also strengthened the case for investing in Bitcoin, along with murmurs of hyperinflation,\u201d Maxwell Goldstein, cofounder of on-chain fine art investment platform Freeport, told Forkast.News on Friday. Due to fears of inflation, \u201cinvestors are absolutely seeking a safe haven asset and Bitcoin fits the bill.\u201d\n\nEther moved up 1.61% to US$1,780, a weekly gain of 0.16%.

The index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts on any given day. It is managed by Forkast sister company, CryptoSlam.\n\nU.S. equities closed higher on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.41%, the S&P 500 gained 0.56%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index moved up 0.31%. All three indices logged gains after a volatile week characterized by wobbly banks and the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest 25-basis-point rate hike.\n\nDespite the gains, bank worries remain. Deutsche Bank, the largest lender in Germany, saw the cost of its default insurance jump on Friday, triggering an 8% sell-off in its stock, according to CNBC.\n\nOn the same day in the U.S., the Financial Stability Oversight Council said that although \u201csome institutions have come under stress, the U.S. banking system remains sound and resilient.\u201d Other officials from U.S. President Joe Biden on down have repeated the same in recent weeks.\n\nAhead of the opening of U.S. equity markets on Monday, stock futures rose as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures moved up 0.36%. S&P 500 futures gained 0.37%. The Nasdaq Composite Index futures edged up 0.24%.\n\nIn the week ahead, the U.S. Congress on Wednesday will hold a hearing on Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, which both failed this month, and data releases are expected on U.S. inflation and GDP growth.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will meet on May 3 to make its next move on interest rates to tackle inflation.

        "title": "Is Bitcoin the Future of Banking? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Many believe that the recent turmoil in the banking industry is the reason for Bitcoin's (BTC 1.60%) recent jump and why it moved past $28,000 for the first time in nine months. While it might come as a surprise, serving as an alternative to banks is one of the primary reasons Bitcoin was invented. Back in 2009, its pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto unveiled Bitcoin to the world as a response to the massive bailout banks received after the fallout of the Great Recession.\n\nTo Nakamoto, it likely comes as no surprise that Bitcoin benefits from the banking chaos in early 2023. Its sole purpose was to provide people with another option to store and send money that didn't rely on the highly opaque and, at times, shady operations of banks.\n\nA novel design to compete with banks\n\nTo fully understand why Bitcoin is benefiting and how it could become a more viable option in the future, we need to examine the characteristics that make it unique.\n\n1. Decentralization\n\nBecause Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network, no single entity, such as a government or financial institution, can control it. This high level of decentralization provides users with more freedom, autonomy, and resistance to censorship or manipulation.\n\n2. Financial inclusion\n\nWhile citizens in developed economies have easy access to banking products, people in other parts of the world don't always have this luxury. With Bitcoin, all one needs is an internet connection, and one can send money, pay remittances, and store value without needing a bank.\n\n3. Transparent security\n\nSince Bitcoin operates on a blockchain, all transactions are public and immutable, so they can never be altered or removed. This combination of transparency and security makes transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain easy to verify and trace. As such, the risks of fraud and corruption become almost nonexistent.\n\n4. Privacy\n\nAlthough Bitcoin transactions are public, there's an added level of privacy because transactions aren't linked to any personal information. The only piece of information tied to transactions are public addresses that are in the form of a random, unique combination of letters and numbers. Theoretically, someone could trace all transactions coming from an address, but the likelihood of actually knowing who is behind them remains difficult.\n\n5. Programmable money\n\nThanks to a 2021 update known as Taproot, Bitcoin became able to support smart contract functionality. With smart contracts, various financial processes can become automated and streamlined as they execute predefined actions when particular criteria are met. This inevitably leads to increased efficiency and new business models.\n\nWhile we can only guess, it would be easy to assume that Bitcoin is doing exactly what Nakamoto intended it to. Banks aren't as safe as advertised and are often involved in corruption and malpractice. And when they do fail, they get bailed out while citizens bear the brunt of the fallout. When people begin to realize this, Bitcoin will likely continue garner attention from those looking for a way out of the status quo.\n\nA necessary disclaimer\n\nI'll be the first to admit that the premise of Bitcoin replacing banks remains slightly far-fetched at the moment. Critics of Bitcoin almost always point to the fact that it could never serve as an alternative to traditional banking while its volatility remains so high and deposits held in banks are insured up to $250,000 by the U.S. government.\n\nHowever, these price fluctuations are likely a temporary phenomenon. Volatility is a characteristic of assets with a small market cap. As Bitcoin's overall value begins to grow, its volatility will likely come down.\n\nBut for the time being, it seems that Nakamoto's vision might be unfolding before our eyes, as more people are becoming aware that banks aren't completely free of risk and often use customer funds for speculative activities. Should more turbulence hit the banking sector, Bitcoin might just continue to climb."

        "title": "Can Bitcoin Solve Europe's Pool Heating Crisis? - SwimSwam",
        "content": "Heating pools is expensive. With the UK (and most of Europe) facing soaring energy costs, this could likely exacerbate the draft of pool closures over the next few years.\n\nRunning a data center is also expensive \u2013 it consumes a lot of electricity and produces a tremendous amount of heat. Even a rack of GPUs the size of a small washing machine could generate 40,000 Watts.\n\nWhat do you do with all that heat?\n\nA UK startup is providing an intriguing answer to that question: use it to heat a pool!\n\nDeep Green Technologies, founded by Mark Bjornsgaard, has deployed its \u201cdigital boiler\u201d at the Exmouth Leisure Centre in southwest England where it\u2019s accounting for fully 60% of the pool\u2019s energy usage (saving them an estimated \u00a320,000 a year). It installs the mini data-center for free and covers all the electricity and maintenance costs.\n\nThe pools get their heating for free. So what does the company get out of the deal? Apart from a great deal of good publicity and the ability to move their data centers out of inconveniently-located warehouses, cooling plays a major role: you don\u2019t need to invest in your own liquid cooling solution if you have a large tank of water at your disposal. This is truly a case where one man\u2019s trash (heat) is another man\u2019s treasure (also heat).\n\nAs to their business model, Deep Green rents their compute \u201cfor use in AI training and machine learning workloads.\u201d In other words, crypto. As their whitepaper (read here) makes clear, the goal is to address the serious environmental impacts of global compute using \u201cdata furnaces\u201d (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-data-furnace-heating-up-with-cloud-computing/) \u2013 in short, exactly what they\u2019re doing here: use excess heat for good.\n\nDeep Green also has future plans to install their devices in Bristol and Manchester in the near future."

        "content": "The US chip-maker Nvidia has said cryptocurrencies do not \u201cbring anything useful for society\u201d despite the company\u2019s powerful processors selling in huge quantities to the sector.\n\nMichael Kagan, its chief technology officer, said other uses of processing power such as the artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT were more worthwhile than mining crypto.\n\nNvidia never embraced the crypto community with open arms. In 2021, the company even released software that artificially constrained the ability to use its graphics cards from being used to mine the popular Ethereum cryptocurrency, in an effort to ensure supply went to its preferred customers instead, who include AI researchers and gamers.\n\nKagan said the decision was justified because of the limited value of using processing power to mine cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe first version ChatGPT was trained on a supercomputer made up of about 10,000 Nvidia graphics cards.\n\n\u201cAll this crypto stuff, it needed parallel processing, and [Nvidia] is the best, so people just programmed it to use for this purpose. They bought a lot of stuff, and then eventually it collapsed, because it doesn\u2019t bring anything useful for society. AI does,\u201d Kagan told the Guardian.\n\n\u201cWith ChatGPT, everybody can now create his own machine, his own programme: you just tell it what to do, and it will. And if it doesn\u2019t work the way you want it to, you tell it \u2018I want something different\u2019.\u201d\n\nCrypto, by contrast, was more like high-frequency trading, an industry that had led to a lot of business for Mellanox, the company Kagan founded before it was acquired by Nvidia.\n\n\u201cWe were heavily involved in also trading: people on Wall Street were buying our stuff to save a few nanoseconds on the wire, the banks were doing crazy things like pulling the fibres under the Hudson taut to make them a little bit shorter, to save a few nanoseconds between their datacentre and the stock exchange,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI never believed that [crypto] is something that will do something good for humanity. You know, people do crazy things, but they buy your stuff, you sell them stuff. But you don\u2019t redirect the company to support whatever it is.\u201d\n\nOriginally best known for producing powerful graphics cards for PC gamers to play the latest games, it was almost by chance that Nvidia\u2019s products took their place at the heart of the AI boom.\n\nThe computationally intensive work of training a new AI system, which can take millions of billions of dollars-worth of computing power, happened to work significantly faster on the types of simple yet powerful processors that had been adopted by gamers.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "title": "The African crypto exchange this 26-year-old launched in 2019 has done $1.75 billion in transactions - CNBC",
        "content": "ACCRA, GHANA \u2013 On the afternoon of Dec. 26, 2022, Chris Maurice finally capitulated and went to the emergency room at Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, just west of the city's gothic quarter. For roughly 10 months, the 26-year-old CEO of the largest centralized crypto exchange in Africa had ignored many of the symptoms consistent with malaria as he bounced between 21 different countries on the continent, advising heads of state on bitcoin adoption and setting up institutional accounts for his business, Yellow Card. By the time Maurice was admitted to the intensive care unit, plasmodium parasites had been wreaking havoc on his red blood cells for nearly a year, multiplying in his liver and threatening to shut down many of his major organs, including his kidneys. His face and eyes were yellow from jaundice. As his hemoglobin levels plummeted in response to the intravenous meds administered as treatment, four days of blood transfusions helped save his life. But to Maurice, his brush with death was simply the price of doing business. Since graduating from Auburn University in Alabama with a finance degree four years ago, he has traded security and stability for a career on the road, all with the goal of fundamentally disrupting Africa's broken financial system. \"I've slept more nights than I can count in the Joburg airport,\" Maurice told CNBC on the sidelines of the Africa Bitcoin Conference in Ghana. \"I've mastered the art of where to go to find chairs with no armrests. I'm six-foot-five, so I need my space.\" For nearly 1.4 million users across the continent, Yellow Card \u2013 which offers an experience similar to Block 's Cash App \u2013 is a vital lifeline to money. \"We wanted to make it as easy as possible for anybody to be able to come on and buy crypto within three minutes,\" explains Maurice in an Uber ride cutting due south through the Ghanaian capital of Accra.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Yellow Card CEO Chris Maurice in Accra, Ghana loading cash onto his Mobile Money account, MoMo. Chris Maurice\n\nFrom there, Yellow Card users can send or receive digital cash in eligible markets. But unlike a centralized exchange like Coinbase , where many customers store their tokens for an extended period of time hoping that their digital assets will appreciate in value, the average customer on Maurice's exchange keeps money on the platform for under five minutes. People take their local fiat currency, turn it into bitcoin or a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin like tether to send it across a border, and the recipient instantly cashes it out. \"It's literally like, I deposit a million Francs in Cameroon, I buy USDT or BTC, and then I send it off,\" continued Maurice. Yellow Card customers can receive cryptocurrency from anywhere in the world and pay only a network fee, which typically ranges from 5 cents to $1, according to Maurice. That is especially helpful for people who would customarily turn to a money service provider like Western Union and MoneyGram, which sometimes charge heavy commissions on remittances. The service is a game-changer for many Africans, who rely on money sent home from abroad, especially in countries where unemployment and inflation is rife. The latest data from the World Bank shows that in Sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 where up to 65% of adults are unbanked \u2013 remittance flows reached $50 billion in 2021, the most recent year for which data is available. The actual number is likely much higher when you factor in money transferred over informal channels. Meanwhile, World Bank data shows that it is more expensive to send remittances to Sub-Saharan Africa than to any other region in the world. On average, it costs $15.60 (7.8%) to send $200 to or from Africa. That percentage can be as high as $38, or 19%, in some countries. Building the crypto payment rails necessary for Yellow Card requires jumping through a lot of legal and regulatory hoops, which is why Maurice spends about nine months a year in the countries where he operates or plans to launch crypto services. He has local lawyers in pretty much every country on the continent, and he meets with elected officials and regulators to further foam the runway for adoption. The level of hospitality varies widely across the continent.\n\nwatch now\n\nMaurice stands out pretty much wherever he goes thanks to his height and plume of curly black hair. His speech is punctuated with laughs and smiles, and that friendly demeanor puts people at ease. But it's underpinned by an intense work ethic \u2014 he's got a black belt in TaeKwonDo, was an Eagle Scout in his youth and a finalist for Rhodes and Marshall scholarships in college. He also cares deeply about revolutionizing a broken financial system. These traits help enlist supporters for his longshot ideas \u2013 like launching a centralized cryptocurrency exchange in Africa from his dorm room in Auburn, Alabama. Yellow Card has facilitated $1.75 billion in transactions since launching in 2019 and has about 220 employees \u2013 mostly in Africa. The exchange lets users send money to 16 countries on the continent \u2013 and crucially, at the other end of that transaction, the platform has streamlined the process of converting crypto back to local currencies. On a good day, the service will do $5 million in transactions. On a slow day, it is closer to $1 million, according to Maurice. The company has also raised $57 million, including from Jack Dorsey's Block and Valar Ventures, a venture capital firm co-founded by Peter Thiel. Maurice says his ultimate goal is to expand service to the rest of the continent and turn Yellow Card into a billion-dollar company, up from its current valuation of $200 million. In practice, that means capitalizing on the exchange's first-mover advantage. \"I realized very early on that there's so much opportunity in all these countries and that we needed to be the first one there,\" said Maurice. \"I drove from South Africa to Botswana, Zimbabwe to Zambia, then flew up to Ethiopia, Ghana, and Uganda. In all of these places, I was doing the grunt work \u2013 things like company registration and opening bank accounts, so that we would be ready to go.\" Maurice doesn't stay anywhere for long, but the transient lifestyle suits him. He's currently in Barcelona, but it's just an apartment in a timezone that lets him take his morning work calls from a desk, rather than the shower. \"I can brush my teeth in peace,\" Maurice says with his trademark smile.\n\nHow money moves in Africa\n\nMoving money in Africa is an expensive and complicated process. Commercial bank branch access is limited, especially for people living in remote and rural areas. Digital banking options are also limited. The latest stats from the World Bank show that just 29% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa uses the internet. Tack on rampant hyperinflation, widespread government corruption, and capital controls trapping domestic cash in banks, and money can stop making sense altogether. \"If someone wants to move money to the country next door, normally, you'd have to fill up a suitcase full of cash and move it over the border,\" explains Ray Youssef, the CEO of Paxful, a peer-to-peer crypto marketplace where users can exchange tokens with one another. Companies like Western Union and MoneyGram offer an expansive physical network of storefronts around the world designed to move money for those who are unbanked. That cash network was extraordinarily difficult and expensive to build, which is why there aren't a lot of direct competitors. It is also why those cash transfers often incur substantial fees. \"The entire system of cross-border payments is all about rent-seeking. That's what it's designed to do,\" argues Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer for the Human Rights Foundation, an organization that works with human rights activists from authoritarian regimes around the world. \"It's not designed to help you move money from A to B. It's designed by someone who's going to make money off you moving money from A to B,\" continues Gladstein.\n\nIf someone wants to move money to the country next door, normally, you'd have to fill up a suitcase full of cash and move it over the border. Ray Youssef Paxful CEO\n\nPart of the problem stems from the continent's quasi-colonial payment framework, in which roughly 80% of cross-border payments originating from African banks are processed offshore, mostly in the U.S. or Europe. That translates to higher costs and processing times that are sometimes measured in weeks. \"The mainstream way of approaching this is, 'Oh, let's just Africanize it. Let's replace the intermediaries over there with intermediaries here,'\" explains Gladstein. \"That's probably even worse because they're going to be corrupt and expensive.\" Across the continent, there are fintech companies built on top of the existing banking system. These platforms abstract away the complicated back-office processes, but the fundamental problem remains. These businesses go through the same legacy payment networks, where they spend a lot of money settling payments \u2014 costs which they then pass on to customers. The Pan-African Payment and Settlement System, or PAPSS, launched in Jan. 2022 with a goal of bringing existing payment systems together under one interoperable network. But it's too early to tell through official metrics whether PAPSS has begun to deliver on its promise of saving African users more than $5 billion in annual transaction fees.\n\nAn employee uses a Nokia 1200 mobile phone inside an M-Pesa store in Nairobi, Kenya, on Sunday, April 14, 2013. Trevor Snap | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nThen there's mobile money, which has been around since the early 2000s. Think of it like an electronic wallet tied to a phone number that does not require a smartphone or data to operate. Users can pay bills and shop with their phone through SMS texting, instead of having to rely on traditional banking options. Africa's mobile money transactions rose 39% to more than $700 billion in 2021, according to data from the GSM Association, a non-profit representing mobile network operators worldwide. World Bank data shows that account ownership at a financial institution \u2014 or via a mobile money service provider \u2014 has more than doubled in the last decade, rising to 55% of adults in Sub-Saharan Africa. But even as adoption proliferates, mobile money users don't get the perks of legacy banking, including earning interest on banked savings and building up a credit score based on a history of spending. Interoperability on the continent also remains a major issue with this alternative way of banking. \"The entire banking system in Africa is completely and utterly broken, even amongst the mobile money providers, the telcos,\" said Youssef from Paxful. \"Two thousand payment networks and only 2% of them talk to each other. That number continues to grow. It's not getting better, it's actually getting worse,\" continued Youssef. Take M-Pesa, short for \"mobile\" and the Swahili word for money \u2014 \"pesa.\" It's Kenya's version of mobile money, and it's incredibly popular there. M-Pesa operates in seven different African countries, but you can't send money from M-Pesa Kenya to M-Pesa Ghana.\n\nA resident checks his phone outside a mobile money kiosk in the Kibera district of Nairobi, Kenya, on Monday, Aug. 1, 2022. Michele Spatari | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\n\"Even on the same network, owned by the same company, because of regulations, those two networks don't talk to each other,\" said Youssef. One solution for moving money across borders is the centralized crypto exchange that Maurice built. The Yellow Card CEO says he would ultimately love to tie in with the Western Union network to help bring those costs for the customer to essentially zero through crypto, given that half of all the world's remittance is still cash on both ends. Another option for making international payments on the continent are peer-to-peer digital asset marketplaces, like the one that Youssef runs. \"People find each other, they do a trade, there's an escrow which removes the trust from at least one side, and the deal is done,\" Youssef told CNBC on the sidelines of the Africa Bitcoin Conference. Paxful has facilitated $5 billion in transaction volume in Africa since it launched, though Youssef says it's only a small fraction of the entire peer-to-peer market. \"Most of it happens on instant messenger, or on the street,\" he said. \"Africans have been doing peer-to-peer finance for a very long time; one might say over 1,400 years. So this is nothing new to them.\"\n\nYellow Card CEO Chris Maurice in a hospital in Douala, Cameroon, recovering from food poisoning after eating cow skins. Chris Maurice\n\nFrom Taco Bell to Nigeria\n\nOn a 15-minute drive from Accra's embassy-heavy Labone District down to the Atlantic Coast, Maurice describes himself as being as Southern as it gets. Before touching down in Nigeria in 2019 to launch his company, the New Orleans native hadn't traveled much beyond the Southeastern seaboard of the U.S. \"My entire worldview was essentially confined to two states \u2013 Louisiana and Alabama,\" said Maurice. \"I had only been on a plane four times before flying to Lagos on a six-day-old passport with no visa and no shots.\" Despite his limited travels to that point, Maurice was no stranger to the difficulties associated with moving money around the planet. Starting in the fifth grade, he used his father's eBay account to sell Pokemon cards and other collectibles online \u2013 a venture that would ultimately cover his college tuition at Auburn. But the business of sending and receiving cash internationally wasn't always straightforward. Some of his customers in Pakistan, for example, weren't able to use PayPal. Bank wires were also not an option. To get paid, Maurice instead had to wait in line at a local Western Union branch. It cost the buyer a hefty fee, and it cost Maurice time \u2013 and gas money. At the age of 18, Maurice turned his attention to bitcoin and soon grew convinced that the world's biggest cryptocurrency was the answer to his problems. It also presented a new business opportunity. In 2015, Maurice and his freshman roommate's best friend, Justin Poiroux, decided to get into bitcoin trading by running their own over-the-counter trading desk out of the Taco Bell on South Gay Street in Auburn. \"We started putting out ads on Craigslist that basically said, 'We have bitcoin. Come give us cash,'\" explained Maurice. Every Wednesday at 7pm, he and Poiroux, a tech-savvy coder, would grab a spot in the back and split a 12-pack of Doritos Locos Tacos while drop-ins would swap dollars for bitcoin. Customers would slap a couple hundred dollars down on the table (bitcoin was trading at around $250 at the time), scan a QR code, and that was it. On the backend, Maurice and Poiroux were using LocalBitcoins, a peer-to-peer exchange, to carry out the trades. At the time, Maurice says, his OTC desk offered an easier onramp to crypto than Coinbase , whose interface was tough to navigate. Profits came from the arbitrage play between payment methods, since bank transfers and cash had different fees. As for the location? Maurice says he chose Taco Bell because it offered the \"perfect amount of apathy.\" \"This operation would have never flown at a Chick-fil-A,\" he said.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Yellow Card CEO Chris Maurice in Amboseli, Kenya. Chris Maurice\n\nAfter two weeks, business was booming, so they decided to expand the franchise. \"We started calling up friends from high school who were now at LSU, Yale, Georgia, Alabama, anywhere that we knew someone,\" continued Maurice. \"A few weeks later, we had seven Taco Bells on the eastern United States, all within college campuses, where you could walk in and buy bitcoin.\" Four months later, the Taco Bell trading desks were moving thousands of dollars in bitcoin. They weren't too rigorous on the accounting at the time, but Maurice estimates that roughly thirty thousand dollars was exchanged across the entire franchise. \"Then one day, Justin and I were talking and we said, 'Man, we should really do something less sketchy with our lives'.\" Then Maurice had a chance meeting at a Wells Fargo near campus that changed his life. \"I meet this Nigerian guy who is sending $200 to his family, and the bank charged him $90,\" Maurice recalled. \"I'm like, 'Man, have you heard of bitcoin?'\" continued Maurice. \"I explained to him what bitcoin is and how he could try it out by downloading Coinbase.\" There was just one problem: He had no idea what would happen on the other end of the transfer. \"What on earth is this guy's mom going to do with $200 worth of bitcoin?\" he said. \"I started skipping class and researching what the banking system was like in Nigeria \u2013 and the currency,\" said Maurice. \"Could you buy bitcoin in Nigeria? Could you sell it?'\" Maurice and Poiroux decided that the core market for Yellow Card should be the people who stood to benefit the most from an alternative, international payment network that cut out extra transaction fees and wait times. While Poiroux stayed behind in Alabama to continue building and maintaining the tech that fueled the entire operation, Maurice set off to Lagos to establish a physical presence, including laying all of the regulatory groundwork needed to get the business off the ground. Centralizing crypto payments seemed like the obvious thing to do. Up until their launch, peer-to-peer crypto payments on Binance, Paxful, or other more regional exchanges had been the status quo for many wanting to trade and invest in digital tokens. \"Generally, the reason that people use centralized exchanges is for the experience, right? It's significantly easier to use Coinbase than it is to use MetaMask, which involves trying to figure out how to get your own ethereum and store your own keys,\" explains Maurice. Having the edge on general licensing has also put Yellow Card ahead of the competition. \"The amount of local expertise that is required to get some of these payment service providers signed, as well as registering entities and setting up bank accounts \u2014 it is such a different way of doing business than in other parts of the world,\" Poiroux tells CNBC.\n\nYellow Card CEO Chris Maurice on a roadtrip from South Africa, north to Zambia. Chris Maurice\n\nRunning Yellow Card\n\nPoiroux doesn't crave the limelight \u2014 he has always worked behind the scenes, unconcerned with notching public accolades. If Yellow Card were a band, he'd be the drummer or bass player, keeping everything solid in the background while Maurice took center stage as the lead singer. Poiroux started coding when he was 10, because he wanted to make his own video games. But after reading the bitcoin white paper, he became obsessed with the idea of decentralized, unstoppable software. The Yellow Card co-founder and chief technology officer dropped out of college freshman year, and instead holed up in his off-campus apartment teaching himself how to be a full-stack developer through a combination of YouTube tutorials and engineering blogs. It took a year and a half of coding for 16 hours a day for him to build the beta of Yellow Card, and he mostly did it himself. \"If something needs to be built, I will learn, figure it out, and build it,\" Poiroux says, with a hint of a Southern drawl. \"Fairly confident this comes from my background as a farmboy from Alabama.\" Poiroux, who had been on a presidential scholarship to Auburn before quitting school, said he kept his off-campus apartment all four years so that he could still get the college experience of going to bars and football games. His parents eventually got on board after he and Maurice landed their first $100,000 in venture funding. Today, Poiroux runs his own fleet of 40 software engineers across 13 countries who are responsible for keeping the entire operation going. His team is in charge of everything from patching bugs in the code to creating technical workarounds for nationwide internet cuts. \"A lot of the infrastructure dependencies in Africa aren't reliable and so you have to build a lot of logic surrounding it that you wouldn't necessarily, originally think of,\" explains Poiroux. In Zambia, for example, it is not uncommon for the largest mobile phone network, MTN, to go down for two to three days. Extended network downtime means having to deal with pending transactions and bracing for more extreme edge cases. Third-party infrastructure dependency is another big sticking point, particularly when it comes to the availability of the network and the payment service providers. Poiroux first went to Lagos in 2020, and he now makes it back to Africa every three to four months, rotating between Yellow Card engineering hubs in Kenya, South Africa, and Nigeria. Part of what makes Yellow Card so convenient for users is its interoperability with existing banking options, as well as alternative payment service providers, including mobile money. While the platform will custody crypto assets if users want to keep their tokens on the exchange, very few choose to do so. Poiroux emphasizes the fact that they are really more the gateway to crypto.\n\nwatch now\n\nAs the counter-party for all trades, Yellow Card also market makes on the exchange against African currencies, a feature which proves crucial when it comes to reducing price volatility and fairly pricing assets. \"We'll buy several million dollars a day worth of naira,\" Maurice says, referring to the Nigerian local currency. \"We're one of the few companies that will actually take on local African fiats.\" 35-year-old Franklin Okoye, who works in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, earns a living by helping businesses to import goods like clothes and chemicals from China. Okoye says that he and other merchants use Yellow Card specifically because it offers \"very competitive\" market rates when he has to convert between tether and the Nigerian naira. \"We have difficulty in Nigeria here accessing dollars to make payments abroad. So everyone is looking for alternative ways of making payments,\" said Okoye, adding that he swaps more than $1 million worth of naira for tether (and vice versa) on Yellow Card each month. \"Everyone is going to crypto.\" Beyond the remittance use case, many customers use the platform to hedge against inflation and currency devaluation by holding some of their local currency in a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin like tether, according to Yellow Card's director of special projects, Oparinde Babatunde. He thinks that's a big reason why crypto's latest bear market didn't hurt their business \u2014 the need to protect against inflation has only gone up as governments around the world began printing cash during the pandemic. Maurice tells CNBC that Yellow Card's business customers are also using the platform to pay for expenses like their Amazon Web Services bill, and Poiroux added that they have seen some of their retail customers earn money by informally day trading and trying to find arbitrage opportunities between coins. \"We have tons of people who use Yellow Card essentially as a full-time job,\" Poiroux said.\n\nYellow Card CEO Chris Maurice and his Chris Maurice\n\nSpreading the bitcoin gospel\n\nNowadays, Poiroux spends less time in the weeds of coding. Instead, he devotes most of his waking hours to thinking about what comes next and how to scale the business specifically to meet the needs of the people for whom he built the platform. \"Our approach is \u2014 and this has been my approach on the technical side \u2014 to build one solution, one platform \u2014 where we can quickly plug-and-play other functionalities,\" Poiroux tells CNBC from Atlanta, where he's working between visits to his production hubs in Africa. \"Think things like new payment service providers, so that we can scale quickly and make crypto as accessible as possible,\" he said, noting that other crypto payment platforms have taken the opposite approach, hyper-focusing on big markets like Nigeria instead of the entirety of the continent. Poiroux says that in addition to the retail-facing part of the business, the enterprise side of the operation is also a major priority. Yellow Card offers a Payments API that enables companies around the world to collect and disburse funds in Africa without currency devaluation risk. \"The super-cool part is that it uses the same infrastructure as our retail platform,\" Poiroux explains of yet another project he architected and helped to code. \"So if we expand our retail business, we can instantly make that available to the companies that have integrated this service already.\" In the meantime, both Maurice and Poiroux are spreading the gospel of bitcoin pretty much everywhere they go. Last summer, for instance, Maurice advised Central African Republic on adopting bitcoin as legal tender. Maurice and his Cameroonian lawyer were brought to Bangui to meet with the minister of public works, who is in charge of the country's crypto strategy. About halfway through the meeting, the electricity cut out, which meant no AC and no light for the remainder of the conversation. \"We were in a dark room with no windows talking about how the country would be tokenizing everything from their natural resources, to Makumba gorillas,\" Maurice recalls. The conversation didn't miss a beat, because everyone at the table was engrossed in the conversation at hand \u2014 how other countries had been taking advantage of Central African Republic through currency controls for its entire history and how bitcoin presented the country with its first real opportunity to determine its own finances. \"Bitcoin gives them a chance to control their own destiny \u2014 to keep their money outside of foreign banks, in their own country, to use how they see fit,\" Maurice said. \"It really is financial freedom.\""

        "title": "Bitcoin rally stalls as crypto dragnet ensnares Coinbase, Do Kwon, and Lindsay Lohan: \u2018We will see more enforcement news like this\u2019 - Fortune",
        "content": "Last year\u2019s crypto-market meltdown triggered a series of bankruptcies that almost completely reshaped the digital-asset industry. This year, government watchdogs appear to be arriving on the scene to finish the job.\n\nThe past week saw the industry hit with another deluge of enforcement news, from the SEC\u2019s threat to take legal action against Coinbase Inc. and its suit against the Tron blockchain network to the apprehension of crypto fugitive Do Kwon. Even celebrity crypto promoters like actress Lindsay Lohan and rapper Soulja Boy got caught up in the crackdown.\n\nAs the headlines piled up, the developments put a lid on a rally in Bitcoin that had been pushing the oldest token back up toward the closely watched $30,000 level. A glitch Friday morning at crypto exchange Binance took spot trading offline for more than two hours on a platform whose market dominance has only grown as other players have folded, adding to the sour mood. Bitcoin drifted around $27,500 on Saturday.\n\nThe collision course between the US government and crypto true believers\u2019 vision of a system where money can be freely exchanged around the world without \u201ccensorship\u201d by authorities was accelerated by the failure of the Terra blockchain\u2019s stablecoin to maintain its $1 peg and the bankruptcy of FTX last year, which combined to vaporize almost $2 trillion of digital wealth. This month\u2019s implosion of crypto-friendly banks Silvergate Capital Corp. and Signature Bank has added fuel.\n\nAt the center of much of the recent actions is the SEC\u2019s decision to treat many cryptoassets as securities that must be registered with the agency and subject to all the regulations that go along with it. Needless to say, digital-asset aficionados were livid with much of the week\u2019s news flow, especially when it comes to publicly listed Coinbase, which says it has repeatedly tried to engage with the regulator to no avail.\n\n\u201cA reprehensible amount of resources and brainpower have been spent in the US trying to engage with this SEC and trying to create substance and a path out of the wraithlike comments issued by the agency,\u201d Sheila Warren, chief executive of the Crypto Council for Innovation trade group, said in an email. \u201cMeanwhile, most other major economies are actively in productive consultation with experts about how to land the regulatory plane.\u201d\n\nThe treatment of many crypto coins as securities means the SEC is testing its authority, leaving those caught up in its sights an option: capitulate and pay a settlement with the regulator, or fight it in court. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has made it clear that the company will fight the complaint, tweeting that the process will prove \u201cthat the SEC simply has not been fair, reasonable, or even demonstrated a seriousness of purpose when it comes to its engagement on digital assets.\u201d\n\nSix of the eight crypto-touting celebrities \u2013 including Lohan and YouTube prankster-turned-boxer Jake Paul \u2013 decided just to cut the SEC a check after the regulator accused them of touting coins traded on the Tron blockchain without disclosing they were being paid to do so.\n\nDeAndre Cortez Way \u2013 aka rapper Soulja Boy \u2013 and singer Austin Mahone haven\u2019t settled. The celebrities are keeping quiet about the whole issue. (For what it\u2019s worth, the only thing Soulja Boy was hawking this week on Twitter was a pink hoodie featuring a cartoon image of his smiling face. That is almost definitely not a security.)\n\nOf course, some of the crimes being alleged went beyond just dealing in unregistered securities. The case against Justin Sun and three of his companies connected to the Tron blockchain also involves accusations of fraud and market manipulation that artificially inflated the trading volume of tokens by encouraging employees to do more than 600,000 so-called wash trades. Sun wrote on Twitter that he believes the SEC\u2019s complaint lacks merit.\n\nDo Kwon\u2019s indictment in the US, which came shortly after his arrest Thursday in Montenegro, also revealed that the government believes the collapse of his Terra blockchain project was more than just a $60 billion accident. According to prosecutors, Kwon also allegedly engaged in market manipulation and deceived investors about certain aspects of the project. His US lawyer did not respond to a request for comment from Bloomberg.\n\nBy the end of the week, it had all started to look like a drama that could be called \u201cLaw & Order: Web3.\u201d So what will the next episode entail? Many industry watchers are bracing for more shoes to drop.\n\n\u201cOverall, I expect we will see more enforcement news like this in the future given we are operating in an environment with little or no regulatory guidance,\u201d said Duke University finance professor Campbell Harvey.\n\nFor the crypto optimists searching for a silver lining, it\u2019s all about looking at the future instead of the dwelling on the ugliness of the past week. The latest bout of drama in the market \u201ctells us nothing,\u201d according to Aaron Brown, a crypto investor who writes for Bloomberg Opinion\n\n\u201cUseful attention should be directed to the new ships preparing for departure, the ones who will lead the next boom,\u201d he said. Many of the developments of the past week were just \u201cthe flotsam and jetsam washing ashore long after the storm has passed.\u201d\n\nOr maybe Soulja Boy put it best back in his MySpace days when he rapped: \u201cOn the internet, got \u2018em jumpin\u2019 off the wall.\u201d\n\n\u2014 With assistance by Emily Nicolle"

        "content": "The recent banking crisis in the United States seems to have shaken the belief of some customers in the legacy banking system. According to Federal Reserve data, customers pulled nearly $100 billion in deposits in the week ending March 15.\n\nAmerican venture capital investor and entrepreneur Tim Draper said in a March 25 report that \u201cfounders need to consider a more diversified cash management approach\u201d due to the over-regulation of banks and micromanagement by the government. As part of a contingency plan, Draper suggested businesses keep \u201c at least six months of short-term cash in each of two banks, one local bank and one global bank, and at least two payrolls worth of cash in Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nThe move from the traditional banking system to cryptocurrencies may have already started, as seen from the strong showing of Bitcoin in the past few days. Even after the recent up-move, investors do not seem to be hurrying to book profits in Bitcoin. However, the same cannot be said about most altcoins, as they have witnessed a minor pullback.\n\nIn the short term, traders need to be selective of the cryptocurrencies to trade. Let\u2019s study the charts of Bitcoin and select altcoins which may start the next leg of the up-move.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin has been hovering around the $28,000 level for the past few days. A consolidation after a strong rally is a positive sign as it shows that traders are holding on to their position, expecting a further up-move.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe upsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($25,936) and the relative strength index (RSI) in the positive area suggest the bulls remain in control. That enhances the prospects of a break above $28,900.\n\nIf that happens, the BTC/USDT pair could rally to the $30,000 to $32,000 resistance zone. The bears will try to defend this zone with all their might because if they fail in their endeavor, the pair may skyrocket to $40,000.\n\nThe vital support on the downside is $25,250. If this level fails to hold up, the pair may tumble to the 200-day simple moving average ($20,179).\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the pair has been trading in a range between $26,500 and $28,900 for some time. The 20-EMA is flat and the RSI is just above the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand.\n\nA break above $28,900 will signal that bulls have overpowered the bears. That will indicate the resumption of the up-move. On the contrary, if the price breaks below $26,500, the pair may tumble to $25,250 and then to $24,000.\n\nXRP price analysis\n\nXRP (XRP) soared above the overhead resistance of $0.43 on March 21. The bears tried to trap the aggressive bulls by pulling the price below the moving averages but the bulls held their ground.\n\nXRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBuyers are trying to push the price toward the overhead resistance at $0.51. If bulls clear this obstacle, the ETH/USDT pair could attempt a rally to $0.56. This level is likely to witness aggressive selling by the bears but if buyers bulldoze their way through, the next stop may be $0.80.\n\nAnother possibility is that the price turns down from $0.51. During the pullback, if bulls flip the $0.43 level into support, it will suggest that the sentiment has turned positive. That will increase the likelihood of a break above $0.51.\n\nThe crucial support to watch on the downside is $0.40. If this level gives way, the next support is $0.36.\n\nXRP/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears are trying to defend the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.46 and the bulls are buying the dips to the 20-EMA. This shows a state of equilibrium between the bulls and the bears.\n\nIf the price sustains above $0.46, it will suggest that bulls have seized control. The pair could then attempt a rally to $0.49 where the bears may again mount a strong defense. On the other hand, if the price slips below the 20-EMA, the pair may fall to $0.43 and then to $0.40.\n\nLitecoin price analysis\n\nWhile most major altcoins are struggling to start a recovery, Litecoin (LTC) is showing signs of strength. The 20-day EMA ($86) has started to turn up and the RSI is in the positive zone, indicating advantage to buyers.\n\nLTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe LTC/USDT pair could first rise to $98 and then retest the strong overhead resistance at $106. This is an important level to keep an eye on because if it crumbles, the pair may accelerate to $115 and then to $130.\n\nAlternatively, if the price turns down sharply from $106, it will suggest that bears are active at higher levels. The pair could then drop to the 20-day EMA. If the price rebounds off this level, it will suggest that the sentiment remains positive. The bulls will then make another attempt to resume the up-move.\n\nThe first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the 20-day EMA. That could open the doors for a drop to $75.\n\nLTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe rebound off the 20-EMA on the four-hour chart shows that the bulls are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity. The bulls will try to kick the price above $96 and extend the up-move to the overhead resistance at $106.\n\nContrarily, if the price breaks below the 20-EMA, it will suggest that the bullish momentum is weakening. The pair could then descend to the uptrend line. This is an important level for the bulls to defend because if it cracks, the pair may tumble to $75.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin is 1 week away from 'confirming' new bull market \u2014 analyst\n\nMonero price analysis\n\nAfter trading near the moving averages for a few days, Monero (XMR) has broken free and is trying to climb higher.\n\nXMR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($153) has started to turn up and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that buyers have the edge. There is a minor resistance at $170 but if bulls overcome this barrier, the XMR/USDT pair could pick up momentum and soar to $187 and subsequently to $210.\n\nThe moving averages are expected to provide support during pullbacks. A break and close below the 200-day SMA ($150) could turn the tide in favor of the bears. The pair may then slump to $132.\n\nXMR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-EMA on the four-hour chart is sloping up and the RSI is in the positive zone, indicating that bulls have the upper hand. The pair could reach $169, where the bulls may again face stiff resistance from the bears.\n\nHowever, on the way down, if bulls do not allow the price to break below the 20-EMA, it will increase the likelihood of a rally above $169. If that happens, the pair may climb to $180 and later to $188.\n\nThe first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the 20-EMA. That could open the doors for a possible drop to the 200-SMA.\n\nAvalanche price analysis\n\nThe bulls have successfully held Avalanche (AVAX) above the moving averages, indicating that lower levels are attracting buyers.\n\nAVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe price has been consolidating between $18.25 and the 200-day SMA ($16.05) for the past few days but this range-bound action is unlikely to continue for long. If buyers thrust the price above $18.25, the AVAX/USDT pair will attempt a rally to $22 where they may face strong selling by the bears.\n\nThis positive view will invalidate in the near term if the price plummets and sustains below the 200-day SMA. The pair could then slide to $15.24 and thereafter to $14.\n\nAVAX/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls have successfully guarded the $16.25 level on the downside but they have failed to propel the pair above the resistance line. This indicates that the bears have not given up and they continue to sell on rallies. The flattish 20-EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to buyers or sellers.\n\nThis uncertainty could tilt in favor of the bulls if they take out the resistance line. The pair may then start the next leg of the recovery to $20 and later to $22. A break and close below $16.25 will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "While Bitcoin\u2019s price has recovered since its March lows, topping out near $28,900, the crisis that caused the initial dip still poses concerns for the market.\n\nThe closure of Silvergate\u2019s SEN and Signature\u2019s Signet network in early March has exposed the crypto market to low liquidity risks.\n\n\u201cLiquidity is king,\u201d an adage in trading circles, is an apt way to describe its importance. It describes a market's ability to facilitate conversion between an asset to fiat currency.\n\nPoor liquidity around an asset leads to market inefficiencies where traders lose money due to events like thin order books, slippage, and larger spreads. It can also cause serious volatility and deter sophisticated investors from placing trades.\n\nKaiko\u2019s head of research Clara Medalie told Decrypt that the current situation is \u201cpretty dangerous\u201d and could manifest in massive price volatility in both directions.\n\n\"A drop in liquidity certainly helps traders to the upside, but there is always eventually a downside,\u201d said Medalie. \u201cThe moment buy pressure subsides, anything can happen to price.\"\n\nCrypto\u2019s liquidity crisis\n\nThe liquidity crisis first manifested with a $200 million drop in 1% market depth after Silvergate\u2019s SEN network was closed, as identified in Kaiko\u2019s latest research note.\n\nThe 1% market depth is calculated by summing the bids and asks within 1% of the mid-price for the top 10 cryptocurrencies. If the market depth is sufficient and order books are crowded around the market price, it reduces the volatility in the market.\n\nThe market depth for Bitcoin and Ethereum is still down 16.12% and 17.64%, respectively, from their monthly opening levels. Kaiko analyst Conor Ryder wrote that \u201cwe are currently at our lowest level of liquidity in BTC markets in 10 months, even lower than the aftermath of FTX.\u201d\n\nBTC and ETH 1% market depth in March 2023. Source: Kaiko .\n\nThe liquidity crunch is also causing inefficiencies such as high slippage and larger spreads. Coinbase\u2019s BTC-USD pair currently exhibits nearly three times higher slippage than at the start of March.\n\nStory continues\n\nSlippage refers to the price at which an order is placed and the final price once that order is actually executed. In low liquidity environments, the difference between these two orders can be much larger than usual.\n\nGrowing List of Crypto Companies Cutting Silvergate Ties\n\nThe most liquid pair in the crypto market, the BTC-USDT pair on Binance, also suffered a blow after the exchange ended its zero-free program.\n\nAs a result, the pair\u2019s liquidity depleted by 70% as market makers moved to greener pastures.\n\nThese conditions have deterred market makers and sophisticated day traders from placing trades because of the additional costs incurred due to market inefficiencies, worsening the low-liquidity environment.\n\nThe need for fiat on-ramps\n\nThe market share of fiat dollars and stablecoins has also drastically shifted, with stablecoin volumes on centralized exchanges rising from a 77% share of volumes to 95% in just over a year.\n\nThe trend accelerated swiftly after the closure of crypto banking networks.\n\nStablecoin market share (blue) in March 2023. Source: Kaiko .\n\nWhile shifting to stablecoin trading pairs does not create an issue for medium to small-scale investors, it can become a problem for more sophisticated traders.\n\nMedalie explained that USD networks are essential to traders, who are required to settle their traders daily.\n\n\"Stablecoins are not ideal from a risk management perspective, especially to settle at the end of the day or week,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if banks close and don't process transactions, then stablecoins are the next best alternative.\""

        "content": "Despite a high rate of tax on crypto , declining trading volumes and recently imposed money laundering provisions , India\u2019s crypto sector still manages to garner an increasing interest of investors.\n\nThere are a number of reasons that explain this conundrum. This Calendar year is turning out to be relatively good for cryptocurrencies. Investors heaved a sigh of relief after bitcoin's price hit a 9-month high recently after the Silicon Valley Bank's collapse.\n\n\u201cThe collapse fuelled the rise in crypto prices because the belief in centralised banking systems was affected. As the flaws in the existing systems become more evident, the crypto sector will continue to have a revival,\u201d says Avinash Shekhar, Founder & CEO, TaxNodes.\n\nSome experts have called this trend an affirmation of \u2018reverse relationship\u2019 between fiat currencies and blockchain-generated currencies.\n\nTo explain in simpler words: while banking system is undergoing a turmoil with the collapse of two US-based regional banks (Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank), blockchain- generated currencies are getting a much-needed boost at the same time.\n\n\u201cIn a truly remarkable decoupling from traditional finance, Bitcoin price has been soaring since the banking crisis started unfolding. Medium-size and regional banks in the US are under pressure due to fast rising interest rates and a run-on deposits, while industry observers are of the view that Bitcoin\u2019s fixed supply schedule offers a unique hedge against the current macro environment,\u201d says Parth Chaturvedi, Crypto Ecosystem Lead, CoinSwitch.\n\nBitcoin has been rising considerably since the start of this year. Bitcoins prices rose from $16,625 (on Jan 1) to $27,493 (on Mar 24), reporting an increase of 65.37 percent in fewer than three months. Trading volumes spiked by 182 percent during this period.\n\nEthereum prices also rose considerably from $1,201 (on Jan 1) to $1,752 (Mar 24), reporting an increase of 45.87 percent. The ETH trading volumes during this period rose by 356 percent, CoinMarketCap data shows.\n\nBTC trading Volume\n\n(Source: CoinMarketCap)\n\nCoinswitch\u2019s Parth Chaturvedi also confirms a similar trend. \u201cTrading volumes across asset classes is a function of prices and usually increasing prices attract more trading volume. We have witnessed a similar trend in crypto trading volumes, since the beginning of the year, when prices started moving higher. We continue to onboard new domestic users and are also seeing existing users come back with renewed interest as crypto as an asset class is helping in portfolio diversification,\u201d says Mr Chaturvedi.\n\n\u201cThe rally in bitcoin and other crypto prices will certainly add a positive outlook for cryptos for long-term investors,\u201d adds Shekhar from TaxNodes.\n\nPolkadot conference\n\nNow since cryptocurrencies are made on blockchain technology, India\u2019s large IT population and ever-growing tech infrastructure can turn things to its advantage, assert industry experts.\n\n\u201cDue to government policies and increased market awareness, there has been a decoupling of cryptocurrency from blockchain. This shift in focus presents India with a unique opportunity to become a powerhouse of blockchain innovation, given its large IT competent population. This trend is a testimony to the shifting interests in the technology, and we can expect to witness more eastward movement of blockchains in the near future,\u201d says Gaurav Mehta, Founder of Catax \u2014 Simple Crypto Taxes.\n\nAn upcoming global blockchain conference next month by Polkadot blockchain platform is seen as a validation of India\u2019s growing importance in the blockchain technology.\n\nPolkadot blockchain platform is hosting first global conference in India in the first week of April in run up to its foray into India.\n\nWhile talking about the conference, Rishant (Rish) Kumar, Growth Lead, APAC, KILT Protocol said that India is an important hub for blockchain innovation.\n\nThis global conference can be seen by crypto optimists as one of the key events in the annals of blockchain industry and its growing significance in India.\n\nIt\u2019s technology, stupid!\n\nExperts argue that the blockchain technology is revolutionary and its innovative use cases and implications continue to unfold. And the confusion happens when the entire focus of investors revolves around crypto prices instead of viewing blockchain in its entirety.\n\n\u201cDespite its immense potential, the public at large has predominantly focused on the oasis of cryptocurrency, attracted by the promise of quick returns and libertarian ideals. As a result, blockchain technology has received less attention and remained outside of mainstream discourse and implementation,\u201d says Mr Mehta from Catax.\n\nHowever, in view of the extreme volatility witnessed in the past, investors are advised to be wary before getting too bullish on cryptocurrencies.\n\nAfter all, despite the recently reported increase in bitcoin prices, this cryptocurrency still trades nearly 60 percent lower than its all-time high of $68,789.\n\n\u201cInvestors are finding merit in Bitcoin\u2019s function as a store of value against monetary debasement, and the next few months will be crucial in supporting this narrative,\u201d Parth Chaturvedi signs off.\n\nSo far, it may be a good year for cryptocurrencies, but what does the future hold for them \u2014 only a crystal ball reader can predict."

        "title": "Will Bitcoin (BTC) reach new ATH in 2023? Here's why Ethereum (ETH) and RenQ Finance (RENQ) will follow the suit - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, has had an unprecedented year in 2021. From its low of around $4,000 in March 2020, Bitcoin reached its all-time high (ATH) of over $69,000 in November 2021.\n\nHowever, since then, Bitcoin\u2019s price has been fluctuating, and it has failed to reach a new ATH. This has left many investors wondering if Bitcoin will ever reach new ATH in 2023.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the factors that may contribute to Bitcoin reaching new ATH in 2023 and how Ethereum and RenQ Finance may follow the suit.\n\nThe Bitcoin Market Cap\n\nThe first factor that may contribute to Bitcoin reaching a new ATH in 2023 is the Bitcoin market cap. As of writing, Bitcoin holds the top position in the cryptocurrency market capitalization rankings, with a value of more than $534 billion.\n\nWhile this may seem like a lot, it\u2019s important to note that the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies is around $1.16 trillion according to coinmarketcap. This means that Bitcoin accounts for less than half of the total cryptocurrency market cap.\n\nWith the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies by institutional investors and corporations, we may see a significant increase in the Bitcoin market cap. This increase in the market cap may push Bitcoin\u2019s price to a new ATH in 2023.\n\nInstitutional Adoption\n\nThe second factor that may contribute to Bitcoin reaching new ATH in 2023 is institutional adoption. Over the past year, we have seen a significant increase in institutional adoption of Bitcoin.\n\nCompanies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Square have all invested billions of dollars in Bitcoin. In addition, we have seen the launch of Bitcoin futures on major exchanges like CME Group and the launch of Bitcoin ETFs in Canada.\n\nWith more institutions investing in Bitcoin, we may see a significant increase in demand for Bitcoin, which may push its price to a new ATH in 2023.\n\nEthereum and RenQ Finance\n\nWhile Bitcoin may be the focus of many investors, it\u2019s important to note that other cryptocurrencies may follow the suit. Ethereum and RenQ Finance are two cryptocurrencies that may see significant growth in the coming years.\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and it\u2019s often referred to as the \u201cworld computer.\u201d Ethereum is the backbone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and is used to build decentralized applications (dApps). Ethereum\u2019s value proposition is that it can do everything that Bitcoin can do, but it can also execute smart contracts. With the increasing adoption of DeFi and the launch of Ethereum 2.0, we may see a significant increase in the demand for Ethereum, which may push its price to a new ATH in 2023.\n\nRenQ Finance is a relatively new cryptocurrency that has gained significant attention in the crypto space. RenQ Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to provide a one-stop solution for all kinds of traders under one platform in the DeFi world. RenQ Finance aims to connect all isolated blockchains and establish a cross-chain asset exchange network, providing all necessary underlying support for the DeFi ecosystem. With the increasing adoption of DeFi and the unique value proposition of RenQ Finance, we may see a significant increase in the demand for RenQ Finance, which may push its price to a new ATH in 2023.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while Bitcoin may be the focus of many investors, it\u2019s important to note that other cryptocurrencies may follow the suit.\n\nEthereum and RenQ Finance are among the cryptocurrencies that show potential for significant growth in the coming years. As more institutional investors and corporations adopt cryptocurrencies, there is a possibility of a significant increase in their value.\n\nRenQ Finance, in particular, has been gaining attention from investors as experts predict 100x gains soon, making it an attractive option for those looking to boost their investment portfolio.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nWebsite: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Investing in the crypto market is like riding an unpredictable rollercoaster. To maximize profits, investors are continually searching for the next big opportunity. In 2023, the market is predicted to be in a bull run. Many investors are looking for risk-free options that can offer stable returns. We\u2019ll explore three tokens considered low-risk options for the 2023 bull market: Bitcoin (BTC), Binance Coin (BNB), and RenQ Finance (RENQ).\n\nBitcoin (BTC): The King of Crypto\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is the most popular cryptocurrency. It has a limited supply of 21 million coins. The low supply makes it scarce and valuable. Bitcoin (BTC) is also frequently used as a form of payment and a store of value. It has a devoted following and a powerful network impact. Many investors agree that Bitcoin (BTC) is the market\u2019s safest and most dependable cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is not governed by any middleman or central authority. Instead, it relies on a peer-to-peer network of nodes, which validates transactions and upholds consensus. Without authorization or trust, anybody may join the network and take part in the Bitcoin (BTC) protocol.\n\nCryptography is used by Bitcoin (BTC) to safeguard transactions and avoid duplicate spending. A Proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism is used to generate new blocks and compensate miners for their labor. PoW requires a lot of computational power and energy, making it difficult for attackers to manipulate or reverse transactions.\n\nBeing an open-source project, anybody may check the source code of Bitcoin (BTC) to verify its operation. Moreover, its blockchain network functions as a shared ledger that records all network transactions. Everyone with availability to the blockchain may check the ownership and history of any Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nBinance Coin (BNB): The Utility Token of Binance\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) is the native token of Binance, the world\u2019s largest and most trusted cryptocurrency exchange. Binance Coin (BNB) can be used to pay for trading fees on Binance and access various services and products offered by Binance and its partners. Binance Coin (BNB) also benefits from the growth and innovation of the Binance ecosystem, which includes Binance Smart Chain, Binance Launchpad, Binance NFT Marketplace, and more.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) was launched in 2017 as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum but later migrated to its blockchain called Binance Chain. Binance Coin (BNB) has a total supply of 200 million tokens. Every quarter, Binance uses 20% of its profits to buy back and burn Binance Coin (BNB) tokens until 50% of the total supply is destroyed. This reduces the inflation rate and increases the scarcity and value of Binance Coin (BNB).\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ): The Decentralized Lending Platform\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ) is a decentralized lending platform that allows users to borrow and lend cryptocurrencies without intermediaries or centralized control. RenQ Finance (RENQ) uses smart contracts to automate loan agreements and enforce repayment terms. RenQ Finance (RENQ) also offers attractive interest rates for both borrowers and lenders. RenQ Finance (RENQ) is powered by its native token RENQ, which is used for governance and incentives on the platform.\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ) intends to be community-driven, furthering its primary decentralization-related objective. The platform seeks to develop based on community decisions, employing a voting process where necessary and continuously taking into account and promoting forum conversations.\n\nRenQ Finance\u2019s (RENQ) key objectives are to provide users anonymity, security, and transparency\u2014some of the most crucial advantages a crypto exchange should have.\n\nAlthough many decentralized exchanges provide their users with these benefits, there are also some drawbacks. When comparing the two, investors frequently choose CEXs over DEXs since the former offers several advantageous features that many DEXs currently lack.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin (BTC), Binance Coin (BNB), and RenQ Finance (RENQ) are all risk-free investments to add to your portfolio in 2023. However, RenQ promises greater returns. Since Bitcoin (BTC) and Binance Coin (BNB) are both well-established market leaders, further explosive growth is highly unlikely. RenQ Finance (RENQ), on the other hand, is a low-cap gem with enormous potential. During a bull run, such a crypto coin could gain over 1000x. According to market analysts, RenQ Finance will return up to 100x in 2023. Furthermore, they predict that the token will be worth between $10 and $15 by 2025. This is a huge jump from the current presale price of $0.030.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nWebsite: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Can Bitcoin reach $1 million in 90 days? Expert analyzes Balaji's forecast - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) continues to dominate conversations in the financial world, having capitalized on the crisis in the United States banking system to reach a new multi-month high. The recent performance has prompted industry experts to offer projections on Bitcoin\u2019s potential price action in the coming days.\n\nOne such projection was made by venture capitalist and former CTO at crypto exchange Coinbase, Balaji Srinivasan, in a tweet on March 18.\n\nBalaji believes that Bitcoin will reach $1 million within 90 days due to the U.S. economy entering a phase of hyperinflation while warning that the world is likely to witness massive changes catalyzed by the devaluation of the dollar.\n\nHowever, analyzing the viability of Balaji\u2019s prediction, Matthew Kratter, founder of the Trader University YouTube channel, termed the forecast as \u201cover the top\u201d but \u201cdirectionally correct,\u201d as shared by MicroStrategy chair Michael Saylor in a tweet on March 24.\n\nAccording to Kratter, while he views Balaji\u2019s forecast as a marketing ploy, the probability of Bitcoin hitting $1 million in three months is 1-2%, but the asset has the potential to reach such price levels in the long term.\n\n\u201cI think he is right about Bitcoin going to a million dollars. I\u2019ve talked about Bitcoin going to $5 million or $10 million per coin, just probably not in the next 90 days. I think this is a bit of a marketing ploy. If Bitcoin were to move to $1 million per coin in the next 90 days, I think that would be a terrible thing. It would actually be a sign that something major is broken,\u201d he said.\n\nDrivers of Bitcoin to $1 million\n\nKratter suggested Bitcoin at $1 million remains in play, noting that the asset is increasingly becoming attractive as a safe haven due to its lack of counterparty and debasement risks, which are prevalent in other assets. He noted that all other assets, including cryptocurrency, technology stocks, bank stocks, stock indices, and gold, are rapidly losing value when measured against Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is everything is crashing against Bitcoin this is another way of saying that people are fleeing into Bitcoin. <\u2026> The entire financial system is unraveling, and savings and capital are being moved into Bitcoin. <\u2026> It\u2019s actually beginning to look like the Bitcoin network can\u2019t be stopped even during the financial crisis,\u201d Kratter added.\n\nFurthermore, the author pointed out that gold, another safe-haven asset, is losing market share to Bitcoin and is depreciating relative to the maiden crypto. In his view, gold has failed to provide the security that investors are seeking during this crisis.\n\nInterestingly, Kratter believes that Balaji\u2019s forecast may be an attempt to bolster his personal reputation by aligning himself with Bitcoin\u2019s coming success. Nevertheless, Kratter acknowledges that the current financial crisis and the Federal Reserve\u2019s \u201cturning the money printers back on\u201d make Bitcoin an attractive option for investors.\n\nWhile Kratter acknowledges that Bitcoin has limitations, such as its limited use as a form of payment and concerns about the security of exchanges and wallets, he predicts that the asset is likely to trade at $100,000 in the next three months and potentially hit $1 million by the end of the current decade.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAfter weeks of rallying, Bitcoin is facing resistance at $30,000. By press time, BTC was trading at $27,628 with daily losses of almost 2%.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart.

In this line, Bitcoin is on the verge of reentering the top ten category of assets by market cap globally.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
