        "content": "This section presents the learning algorithm employed to develop an effective trading strategy by leveraging the processed datasets. A more comprehensive understanding of the proposed model is provided in the three subsections. The proposed M-DQN consists of three independent DQN-based models: Trade-DQN, Predictive-DQN, and Main-DQN. The subsections respectively cover the theoretical background of RL and DQN, a summary of the results from the Trade-DQN and Predictive-DQN models, and the design methodology of the proposed Main-DQN model.\n\nBackground\u2014RL and DQN\n\nAs mentioned above, because the proposed M-DQN is based on the RL and DQN structures, the basic concepts are introduced prior to describing the method in detail.\n\nReinforcement learning\n\nReinforcement learning is a machine-learning paradigm in which an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with its environment51. The goal of the agent is to maximize its cumulative reward by discovering an optimal policy that maps states to actions. The agent performs actions based on its current state, and the environment responds by providing feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. This process is iterative and continues until the agent has acquired a sufficient understanding of the environment to ensure that the given task is well performed.\n\nThe foundation of RL lies in the MDP framework, which comprises a tuple (\\(S, A, P, R, \\gamma\\)), where S denotes the set of states; A represents the set of actions; P is the state-transition probability function; R is the reward function; and \\(\\gamma\\) is the discount factor with \\(0\\le \\gamma \\le 1\\). This indicates the agent\u2019s preference for present over future rewards. When \\(\\gamma\\) is closer to zero, the agent prioritizes immediate rewards, whereas a \\(\\gamma\\) value of approximately one suggests that the agent values future rewards almost as much as immediate rewards.\n\nThe agent\u2019s objective is to learn an optimal policy \\(\\pi\\) that maximizes the expected cumulative reward, which is known as the value function, for each state. The value function V(s) is defined as the expected cumulative reward starting from state s and following policy \\(\\pi\\). Similarly, the action-value function Q(s, a) represents the expected cumulative reward starting from state s, taking action a, and following policy \\(\\pi\\).\n\nA popular method for solving RL problems is Q-learning, which is a model-free, value-based method that directly estimates the optimal action-value function52. Q-learning is an off-policy algorithm that learns the optimal policy regardless of the agent\u2019s current policy. In Q-learning, the agent updates its action-value function using the Bellman equation, which expresses the optimal value of a state-action pair as the immediate reward plus the discounted future value of the next state-action pair. The agent iteratively updates the Q values using this equation until the optimal Q values converge.\n\nDeep Q-network\n\nBuilding upon the foundations of Q-learning, DQN is an extension that combines reinforcement learning with deep learning techniques15. It uses a deep neural network as an approximator to estimate the action-value function Q(s, a). DQN addresses the main challenges of traditional Q-learning, such as learning stability. Moreover, by employing deep learning, DQN can handle high-dimensional state spaces, such as those encountered in image-based tasks or large-scale problems53.\n\nTo ensure stable learning, DQN incorporates two essential techniques: experience replay and target networks. Experience replay is a mechanism that stores an agent\u2019s experiences (i.e., state transitions and rewards) in a replay buffer54. During training, the agent samples random minibatches of experiences from the buffer to update the Q values. This process helps break the correlation between consecutive experiences, thereby reducing the variance of updates and leading to more stable learning.\n\nComplementing experience replay, target networks address the issue of moving targets in the Q-value update equation. In DQN, a separate neural network called the target network is used to compute the target Q-values for the Bellman update. The target network has the same architecture as the main Q-network. However, its parameters are updated less frequently, by periodically copying weights from the main network. This technique mitigates the issue of nonstationary targets and improves learning stability.\n\nIn summary, RL and DQN provide a robust and scalable framework for learning optimal policies in complex environments with large state spaces. By leveraging deep learning techniques, DQN effectively tackles the challenges of scalability and stability in traditional Q-learning. In the context of this study, the DQN framework was applied to develop an enhanced trading strategy that incorporates both Bitcoin historical price data and Twitter sentiment data.\n\nPreprocessing DQN\n\nAs described previously, the proposed M-DQN consists of two parts: (1) Preprocessing DQN and (2) Main Trading DQN. Preprocessing DQN is a DQN that preprocesses the input data of Main DQN using the original data. For this purpose, two different types of DQN: trade-DQN with Bitcoin price data and predictive-DQN with Bitcoin price and tweet sentiment data, were constructed to deal with different datasets. A detailed explanation of the preprocessing DQN is provided below.\n\nTrade-DQN with Bitcoin price data\n\nIn the Trade-DQN model, the agent attempts to maximize short-term profits in the Bitcoin market, learning from features related to market conditions, relationships between historical Bitcoin prices, and agent\u2019s current financial position. Over time, the agent learns how to make optimal investment decisions\u2014buy, sell, or hold Bitcoin.\n\nThe agent interacts with its environment, which is defined as an hourly Bitcoin market. That is, the agent observes the environment and receives hourly Bitcoin price data as a state, chooses an action based on the policies learned during training, and obtains a reward for the actions taken. In this study, the state, action, and reward are denoted by \\(s_t\\), \\(a_t\\), and \\(r_t\\), respectively for all DQN models at time t.\n\nIn the Trade-DQN step, the state is defined as \\(s_t:=AP_t\\), where \\(AP_t\\) is the actual Bitcoin price at time t. The Bitcoin price is considered up to the second decimal place and used as a discrete value. The action of the agent is \\(a_t \\in \\{buy, hold, sell\\}\\) i.e.,, the agent can perform three types of actions: buy, hold, and sell Bitcoins, as shown in Fig. 3. Reward \\(r_t\\) is designed to encourage the agent to make profitable trades and discourage unprofitable or indecisive actions. If the agent chooses to \u201chold,\u201d it gets zero feedback from the environment (\\(r_t=0\\)). However, if the \u201chold\u201d action is repeated consistently several times (more precisely twenty times), the agent is punished with a negative reward (\\(r_t=-1\\) if the number of consecutive \u201chold\u201d actions \\(m \\ge 20\\)). After each \u201csell\u201d action, an agent gets a reward from the environment, negative or positive. The reward value depends on the profitability of the selling action. This is calculated by subtracting the selling price, denoted by \\(P_{sell}\\) from the last purchasing price, denoted by \\(P_{buy}\\), whereby the reward is \\(r_t=P_{sell}-P_{buy}\\). If the agent continuously chooses the \u201cbuy\u201d action and the number becomes higher than the limit (in this case 20), the agent receives a negative reward (\\(r_t=-1\\)). This is to prevent the market from making many sequential purchases and improve the agent\u2019s performance.\n\nThe DQN model consists of four multilayer models designed to suggest one of three possible actions: buy, sell, or hold a position. The first layer has 64 hidden units; the second layer has 32; the third layer has eight neurons; and the last layer contains three units, corresponding to the number of possible actions. The activation function uses a rectified linear unit (ReLU) in the first three hidden layers and a linear function in the last layer. The mean square error (MSE) is used as the error function. The final results of all the four models are used to assess the confidence indicators for each of the three available outcomes.\n\nPredictive-DQN with Bitcoin price and tweet sentiment data\n\nIn Predictive-DQN, Bitcoin-related tweets are utilized to extract sentiments, thereby separating them into positive (compound score between 0 and 1), neutral (score of 0), and negative (score between 0 and \u2212 1) categories as described above. In leveraging these sentiment scores and employing the DQN algorithm, the objective is to construct a model capable of predicting future Bitcoin prices. Hence, in this model, the state \\(s_t\\) is defined by the pair \\(s_t:=[AP_t, TS_t]\\), where \\(TS_t\\) is the Twitter sentiment score at time t. Because up to the second decimal place is considered for \\(AP_t\\) and \\(TS_t\\), the state space is discrete. Based on this state, the action of the agent is defined as a number between \\(a_t \\in \\{-100, -99, \\ldots ,0, \\ldots ,99,100\\}\\), representing the future prediction of the price as the change from its current value in terms of percentage (Fig. 4). The comparative difference reward (CDR) function designed in our previous work41 was adapted as the reward function. This is a unique reward function designed to provide more nuanced feedback to the model based on the accuracy of its predictions. The CDR function considers the rate of change in the actual Bitcoin price and introduces the concept of a zero-reward value, which was defined in41, as follows:\n\nDefinition 1\n\n41 Let \\(\\alpha = (AP_{t} - AP_{t-1})/AP_{t-1}\\) where \\(AP_t\\) is the actual price of Bitcoin at time t, and \\(AP_{t-1}>0\\) i.e.,the rate of change in the actual price. Let \\(PP_t\\) be the predicted price at time t and let \\(l=AP_t - PP_{t-1}(1+\\alpha )>0\\). This point is referred to as zero-value reward (\\(ZR_t\\)) at time t where the difference from \\(AP_t\\) is l.\n\nThe reward value is then computed based on whether the predicted price (\\(PP_t\\)) is higher or lower than the actual price (\\(AP_t\\)). Therefore, two ZRs exist, as shown in Fig. 5. The former case is denoted by \\(ZR_t ^1\\) and the latter case by \\(ZR_t ^2\\). If \\(PP_t\\) is smaller than \\(AP_t\\), the agent receives a negative reward (\\(PP_t < ZR_t ^1\\)) or a positive reward if \\(PP_t\\) is between \\(ZR_t ^1\\) and \\(AP_t\\). Mathematically, the reward value is calculated as follows:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} r_t =\\frac{PP_t-ZR_{t}^{1}}{AP_t-ZR_{t}^{1}} *100\\% \\end{aligned}$$ (1)\n\nIf \\(PP_t\\) is higher than \\(AP_t\\), the reward is positive if \\(PP_t\\) is between \\(AP_t\\) and \\(ZR_t ^2\\), and the reward is negative if \\(PP_t\\) is higher than \\(ZR_t ^2\\). In this case, the equation for calculating the reward value is:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} {r_t} =\\frac{PP_t-ZR_{t}^{2}}{AP_t-ZR_{t}^{2}}*100\\% \\end{aligned}$$ (2)\n\nIn both cases, the reward increases when the predicted price approaches the actual price. The CDR function provides a more detailed feedback to the model, allowing it to better adjust its predictions over time.\n\nThe Predictive-DRL model comprises five multilayer models designed to output any number between \u2212 100 and 100 with up to two decimal-point precision. As previously mentioned, this number represents the percentage change from the actual price. The first layer serves as the input layer and has two neurons that reflect the two features of the Bitcoin price: the actual price and sentiment scores. The three subsequent layers, referred to as the dense layers, contain 64 hidden units each. The final output layer comprises 20,001 units. These units correspond to the number of possible actions, accounting for all possible numbers between \u2212 100 and 100 with up to two-decimal point precision. The ReLU function serves as an activation function for the first three hidden layers, whereas the output layer uses a linear function. MSE was adopted as the error metric.\n\nTo summarize, the results from the Predictive-DQN model were positive, achieving 86.13% accuracy and drawing attention to the effects of Bitcoin-related tweets on Bitcoin futures price changes. Therefore, in this study, to develop an efficient Bitcoin trading strategy, a unique dataset was proposed to include market decisions and market prediction information for Bitcoin.\n\nMain trade recommendation DQN with integrated data\n\nFigure 6 Proposed M-DQN model. In Preprocessing DQN: Trade-DQN receives Bitcoin price data as input, and generates initial trade decisions as output \\(x_1\\); Predictive-DQN receives Bitcoin price data along with Tweet sentiment score as input and generates predicted change in percentage as output \\(x_2\\). In Trade Decision DQN: Main-DQN utilizes the two preprocessed outputs [\\(x_1,x_2\\)] as input, thereby generating the final trade decision as output. Full size image\n\nIn the main DQN, for the final trade, the output data of the aforementioned two Preprocessing DQNs are used for learning. Therefore, the performance of the proposed Main-DQN model is based on the output results from Trade-DQN, which provide trade recommendations, and Predictive-DQN, which offer futures price predictions. Before providing a detailed explanation of the Main-DQN model, the process of leveraging these outputs is described.\n\nData integration\n\nFirst, two different types of output data are merged into one. Combining these datasets allows us to develop a more comprehensive trading strategy that leverages the strengths of both data sources.\n\nLarge-scale timespans were considered for both datasets. As there was a slight difference in the time periods covered by each, to maintain data integrity and consistency, we identified overlapping periods between the two datasets. Furthermore, to satisfy the research objective of uncovering correlations between variables within these datasets, it is crucial that the data originate from a consistent timeframe. This alignment guarantees that genuine relationships are not distorted by variations over time. The overlapping time periods in the datasets were identified as spanning from October 1, 2014 to November 14, 2018, comprising 1505 days. This overlapping period enabled us to effectively combine the datasets and ensure the integrity of the analysis.\n\nNext, the two datasets were merged into a single dataset by aligning trading recommendations and futures price predictions based on their respective timestamps. For each hour within the overlapping period, the corresponding trading recommendations and futures price predictions were placed in the same row. This approach facilitates the seamless integration of data, allowing a more effective examination of the relationship between trading recommendations and futures price predictions.\n\nGiven that the objective was to develop an hourly trading strategy, the total number of hours within the experimental period were calculated by multiplying the number of days (1505) by 24 h. This resulted in 36,120 h of data, which formed the basis of our dataset. Therefore, the final dataset comprised 36,120 rows, with each row representing an hour within the experimental period. Each row contained trading recommendations and futures price predictions for a specific hour. This integrated dataset enabled us to explore the synergistic potential of combining Bitcoin historical price data with Twitter sentiment analysis, ultimately aiming to enhance our trading strategy and improve its performance in the volatile Bitcoin market.\n\nModeling the main DQN\n\nAfter obtaining the integrated dataset, the DQN-based Bitcoin trading model (Main-DQN) was built. Similar to the preprocessing models, the proposed DQN model, which acts as an agent, interacts with the environment represented by the Bitcoin market. The MDP elements of state, action, and reward are defined as follows:\n\nState Space \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) A state represents the current situation in the market, which is crucial for making informed decisions. In our study, each row of the prepared dataset describes hourly data of historical price and Twitter sentiment and is considered a state \\(s_t:=[x_1, x_2] \\in \\mathcal{S}\\) at time t . Specifically, each state is a two-dimensional array, where the first element \\(x_1\\) can be either \u2212 1, 0, or 1, indicating a sell, hold, or buy recommendation, respectively, and the second element \\(x_2\\) is a number between \u2212 100 and 100, representing the predicted futures price change percentage based on Twitter sentiment, as shown in Fig. 6.\n\nAction Space \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) An action represents the decision made by the agent at a particular state. In our trading task, the action of the agent \\(a_t \\in \\mathcal{A}\\) at time t is defined as the final decision on trading, which can represent one of three options: buy a Bitcoin from the market, hold, or sell. The agent learns how to choose the most suitable action based on the state information and experience, aiming to maximize the expected cumulative reward.\n\nReward Function r For the trading task, the three important aspects considered for effective trading are: gaining high profits, keeping risk at a low level, and maintaining active trading, based on which the proposed reward function evaluates the agent\u2019s decision and guides the learning process. As mentioned earlier, achieving high returns is one of the components of an effective trading strategy. In this study, the agent\u2019s performance is assessed in terms of gains through profit and loss (PnL) calculations after each decision. It is important to note that transaction fees, which are charges incurred by traders when conducting buy or sell actions in the market, play a role in determining the PnL. These fees vary depending on the trading platform; however, they typically range between 0.1 and 1.5% of the trade value55. For the purpose of this study, a constant 1.5% transaction fee rate was assumed. Despite the transaction fee, a PnL can only be generated when a trade has both purchasing and selling prices. Therefore, when the agent decides to buy or hold, it receives zero reward, and as soon as it decides to sell, the selling price is subtracted from the sum of the buying price of Bitcoin and all transaction fees. If the resulting value is positive, the agent receives an equivalent positive reward. If the value is negative, the agent receives a penalty equal to the negative value. Thus, the reward function considers both the profit potential and transaction costs involved in trading. To define the reward function mathematically, the following notation is introduced: \\(P_k^{buy}\\) and \\(P_k^{sell}\\) represent the buying and selling price values of the Bitcoin for a given order k (i.e., the 1st Bitcoin, 2nd Bitcoin, and so forth), whereas \\(c_k^{buy}\\) and \\(c_k^{sell}\\) refer to the transaction fees incurred during the purchase and sale of the kth Bitcoin, respectively. Under these terms, the PnL for each Bitcoin transaction can be computed as: $$\\begin{aligned} {PnL_k} =P_k^{sell} - P_k^{buy} - c_k^{buy} - c_k^{sell}. \\end{aligned}$$ (3) This formula specifies a comprehensive method for quantifying the net profit (or loss) obtained from the kth Bitcoin transaction, after considering the transaction fees. This way, the reward value at time-step t is equal to the value of \\(PnL_k\\) (\\(r_t=PnL_k\\)). In describing the reward function, the second critical factor for an effective trading strategy is to maintain a low risk level. In this work, risk level is described as the percentage of the investment that the model is allowed to risk. After each decision made by the agent, the amount of investment is calculated, and if it is below a certain threshold, the agent receives a penalty. By contrast, if the investment is above the threshold, the agent receives zero reward. More precisely, \\(I_{current}\\) is defined to represent the current value of the investment, which is determined at each time-step t after purchasing Bitcoin. This value is computed by deducting all relevant expenses (\\(P_k^{buy}\\) and \\(c_k^{buy}\\)) from the initial investment amount, \\(I_{Initial}\\). The threshold, denoted by \\(\\alpha\\), represents the maximum permissible part of the investment that the agent is allowed to risk. The final factor for an efficient trading strategy is to maintain active trading, which refers to buying or selling Bitcoins in the market rather than simply holding them. Encouraging the agent to engage in active trading is essential for capitalizing on market opportunities and adapting to changing market conditions. To promote active trading, a threshold is established and monitored to determine the number of active trades at the time of reaching or exceeding this threshold. Let m be the sum of all the number of purchases and sells and \\(\\omega\\) be the threshold for active trades. In this scenario, the agent receives a negative reward only when the number of active trades (m) exceeds the threshold, \\(r_t = -1,\\) if \\(m > \\omega\\). Then, the reward \\(r_t\\) can be computed depending on the action \\(a_t\\) by: $$\\begin{aligned} {r_t=} \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{l} -1, \\quad \\quad if \\quad \\quad m>\\omega ~ or~ a_t = buy~ with~ I_{current} < \\alpha \\\\ 0,\\quad \\quad if \\quad \\quad m \\le \\omega , ~ a_t = buy~ with~ I_{current} \\ge \\alpha ~ or~ a_t = hold\\\\ PnL_k,\\quad \\quad if \\quad \\quad m \\le \\omega , ~ a_t = sell,\\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\end{aligned}$$ (4) In the equation above, when the action is buy or sell, m becomes \\(m+1\\). This formula provides a way to measure the instantaneous reward obtained at each time step, given the current state of the investment, the cost of the transaction, and the predefined risk threshold. To determine the optimal threshold, three different risk levels are considered, whereby the agent is trained separately for each level: 30% (low), 55% (medium), and 80% (high)56. The performance of the agent under these different risk levels is analyzed and reported in \u201cExperiment and results\u201d section. Furthermore, as the Bitcoin market operates 24/7 and our dataset reported hourly, the maximum number of possible active trades was 24 per day. To explore the optimal number of trades for the proposed model, we defined three different thresholds: up to 8, 16, and 24 active trades per day. By testing these thresholds, a better understanding can be acquired on how the agent\u2019s trading activity impacts performance. The results of the experiments conducted with these thresholds are presented in \u201cExperiment and results\u201d section, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed trading strategy under various levels of trading activity.\n\nIn incorporating these factors into the reward function, the goal is to create an agent capable of making effective trading decisions that balance risk, profitability, and trading activity, ultimately for an optimal trading strategy. The key components and layers of the architecture used in our trading strategy are outlined, explaining the role of each layer in extracting meaningful information from the input data and estimating the action-value function Q(s, a). The model architecture begins with an input layer that has two neurons which capture the relevant information in the data, necessary for making trading decisions. These neurons represent market actions (\u2212 1, 0, or 1) and the price prediction score (ranging from \u2212 100 to 100).\n\nThe DQN model contains three fully connected dense layers, each containing 64 neurons. These layers aim to capture the complex relationships between the input features and actions. Increasing the number of neurons and layers allows the model to learn more complex patterns, at the expense of increased computational cost and risk of overfitting. Each dense layer utilizes a ReLU activation function to prevent vanishing gradient issues during training. The choice of the activation function is critical, as it introduces nonlinearity into the model, enabling the learning of intricate patterns.\n\nThe output layer of the model comprises three neurons corresponding to the three possible actions: buy, sell, or hold. These neurons represent the Q-values for each action, given the current state, and help the model produce a probability distribution for the actions to guide the decision-making process. To minimize the difference between the predicted and target Q-values, the model uses the MSE loss function. This choice of the loss function dictates model learning from errors and parameter updates. The Adam optimizer was employed in this model because it strikes a balance between fast convergence and stability during training."

The letter warned the SEC that it would be a \u201cgrave if not historic mistake\u201d to approve Bitcoin ETFs, and that doing so would put a U.S. stamp of approval on \u201ca market thoroughly contaminated with fraud and manipulation.\u201d\n\nThe letter\u2019s 11th-hour filing\u2014only days before the SEC is obliged to take a vote on a pending Bitcoin ETF petition\u2014and the fact it came from allies of Gensler and Warren led some crypto watchers to fear the approval process would be derailed yet again. \u201cIt\u2019d be so utterly fitting for crypto in general if Gary manages to figure out a way to rug everyone,\u201d Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart noted dryly. (The term \u201crug\u201d is common crypto parlance for pulling a sudden trick or scam).\n\nDespite a flurry of worried tweets about the letter, it\u2019s unlikely the Better Markets missive is part of a last-minute plot to help the crypto-hating Gensler sandbag the Bitcoin ETF applications one more time. This is not least because the group\u2019s letter, on closer inspection, appears to be little more than a rewarmed version of an earlier document from this summer. The evidence for this is that the group\u2019s initial filing contained the wrong date and that Better Markets did not even bother to provide an up-to-date list of companies seeking a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe upshot is that the popular thesis about how and when the SEC will issue an approval is probably correct. That thesis holds that, after the agency got smacked down in court, it will use this Wednesday, Jan. 10\u2014when it is obliged to supply an answer to one of the applications\u2014to approve a batch of filings at once so as not to give any one would-be Bitcoin ETF issuer a head start.\n\nWhile imminent approval seems like a sure thing, that doesn\u2019t mean the end of the drama. There are still two big questions for which no one has a clear answer. The first is which firm will grab the lion\u2019s share of the market\u2014BlackRock, Grayscale, or someone else\u2014and the second is what an SEC approval for ETFs will mean for the price of Bitcoin.\n\nThe bear case, which is getting the most play, is that any price pop from the SEC\u2019s approval is already baked in and that Bitcoin will drop once investors \u201csell the news.\u201d The bull case is more subtle but also compelling. It involves the idea of \u201cmodel portfolios,\u201d which\u2014as an ETF expert tells Axios\u2014involves finance titans like BlackRock building off-the-shelf investment portfolios that are simply cut-and-pasted by many institutions. If those model portfolios will soon include Bitcoin, well, you get the idea. Do you have a strong reason to believe the bull or bear case for Bitcoin ETFs will prevail? If so, let me know.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nCoinbase is reportedly acquiring a holding company in Europe in order to obtain a license to offer derivatives, which make up 75% of all crypto trading, in the EU.

        "title": "Why the New Bitcoin ETF May Not Have the Impact the Market Is Assuming - Nasdaq",
        "content": "This week, the SEC is expected to give their decision on a proposed spot bitcoin ETF and, according to some analysts, approval is just about guaranteed. Crypto traders have believed that for some time, resulting in big gains in BTC/USD in the last couple of months of last year taking bitcoin (BTC) up to around $45k. That has had one interesting effect: The people who said, once again, that BTC was going to zero earlier last year when it had dropped to around $20k have disappeared for some reason, just as they have every time it has jumped.\n\nYou would think after being so wrong so many times, these bears would have learned that BTC is here to stay, but it seems not. Ironically, now that the permabears are in hiding, this might actually be a good time to be at least somewhat bearish.\n\nIt is not that a spot ETF won\u2019t have a positive impact on demand for bitcoin. It obviously will, given that the fund will have to own the asset to back it, but the massive gains in BTC/USD that we have seen look overdone, and a \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the fact\u201d pattern shortly after the approval is announced this week is starting to look very likely. It is funny how a reversal in direction in any market for any reason can be an \u201cEmperor has no clothes!\u201d moment for traders and investors, so if a post-announcement drop does come, it could easily prompt a rethink about the beliefs underpinning the run up.\n\nThe problem is that the doubling in BTC/USD rests largely on one major, but possibly flawed assumption: that it will result in a big increase in institutional investment in bitcoin. However, there are reasons to doubt that.\n\nFirst, unlike when I first started writing about bitcoin in 2014, ownership of crypto is now not a fringe thing limited only to a few computer nerds and some like me who just found the idea of a trustless, peer to peer, currency a fascinating concept. Nor is it still something that requires jumping through some pretty daunting, and to be honest, shady hoops to achieve these days. Accessible wallets and exchanges are commonplace, making bitcoin no more difficult to own and trade than other, more conventional currencies.\n\nMajor U.S. institutions have therefore been involved in trading and owning crypto for a few years now, leaving no reason why an ETF will prompt a huge jump in institutional ownership. That is especially true given the other factor that seems to be being overlooked.\n\nOne of the things that I have observed in my forty years or so in and around markets is that every institutional trader understands the cumulative negative impact of fees on an investment. They are happy to charge them to retail investors like you and me, but will go out of their way to avoid paying them themselves. So, even though Grayscale announced that they were reducing their proposed annual management fee on the fund to 1.5% from 2%, that is still a significant convenience charge for institutions that could set up their own bitcoin trading and storage account without that much more fuss.\n\nNone of this means that BTC/USD won\u2019t greet the news with a pop, assuming the SEC does what everyone expects and approves the ETF this week. It almost certainly will pop, but the question is how long that bullish sentiment will last. If profit taking prompts a post-news dip before long, that could easily turn into a significant correction as the assumptions behind the 100% or so gains in BTC start to be questioned.\n\nThen there is the fact that crypto has become such a polarizing thing in the investment world. It is a love it or hate it thing. Those that love it almost certainly already own it, and those that hate it probably never will. It seems unlikely that there is a big pool of money controlled by people without an opinion that will suddenly be invested in crypto just because there is a spot ETF available.\n\nThere is one other thing worth saying here, though. If there is a drop in BTC/USD on a \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the fact\u201d effect following the news this week, it will set up an opportunity for longer-term investors, as the second thing that has been driving recent buying will have a positive impact. Bitcoin\u2019s original white paper created regular \u201chalving\u201d events, where mining becomes exponentially more difficult at certain points, restricting supply. We have seen in the past that those events do give the price of bitcoin a sustained boost, and one is expected in April of this year.\n\nI am not a hater who sees every move up in bitcoin as a movement led by a confederacy of dunces, but nor am I a fanatical libertarian anarchist who believes in it as a way of challenging the very idea of government. I don\u2019t believe that the asset is inevitably headed to a million dollars, nor do I believe it is worthless and headed to zero. I am just an everyday trader and investor who believes that the democratization of money is potentially a good thing, and for whom the potential to make money is paramount. That allows me to see that bitcoin is probably overvalued at current levels and take a bearish view over the next few weeks, but still see the long-term bullish influences that will see it recover to at least these levels, or probably even higher, by the middle of the year.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

Mercari will convert the BTC in real time through its crypto exchange subsidiary, and will pay sellers in fiat currency.\n\nMercari's subsidiary, Mercoin, will be responsible for converting all Bitcoin payments into Japanese yen, ensuring that vendors receive the equivalent amount in fiat currency. Notably, Mercari will not display prices in Bitcoin, maintaining the listing of items for sale in Japanese yen.\n\nFounded in 2013, Mercari has become Japan\u2019s largest community marketplace, with over 22 million monthly users. The e-commerce platform launched crypto exchange Mercoin in April 2021, positioning itself as a gateway for crypto adoption in the tech-savvy nation.\n\nJapan's pro-crypto regulations have encouraged e-commerce platforms to offer cryptocurrency payment options. Rakuten, another major e-commerce platform, has launched a few crypto initiatives, including allowing users to convert loyalty points to crypto and developing a native non-fungible token platform.\n\nJapan is seeking to encourage further adoption and innovation in the web3 space. According to Fumio Kishida, the prime minister of Japan, Web3 is an aspect of the new form of capitalism. Furthermore, startups can now raise funds in crypto, while Japan is reforming new tax laws to exempt companies from paying taxes on long-term holdings of cryptocurrencies.

He has been charged with operating and conspiring to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business.\n\nThe US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) alleges in court documents that a network of promoters of the Hyper schemes made \u201cfraudulent promotional presentations\u201d for an investment operation that generated revenue from bitcoin mining, which the IRS alleges did not exist.\n\nIt is the first time charges have been laid against anyone involved in the HyperVerse scheme.\n\nA Guardian investigation has revealed the scheme\u2019s links to Australian Sam Lee and his business partner Ryan Xu, two of the directors of the Australian blockchain company Blockchain Global, which collapsed owing creditors $58m.\n\nLee was the chairman of the HyperTech group, while Xu was listed as the group\u2019s founder. The two men were featured prominently in online promotional material for the Hyper schemes, with both speaking as part of the HyperVerse global launch event in December 2021.\n\nThe HyperVerse scheme was the subject of multiple consumer warnings from financial authorities around the world, but escaped the attention of regulators in Australia.\n\nLee and Xu have been referred to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) for potential breaches of the Corporations Act in relation to Blockchain Global, but Asic has said it does not intend to take action at this time.\n\nNeither Lee nor Xu is mentioned in the US court documents relating to the criminal complaint against Burton.\n\nLee did not respond to a request for comment on the arrest; Xu could not be contacted.\n\nBurton\u2019s appointed public defence lawyer also did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment by time of publication.\n\nIn an affidavit in support of the criminal complaint and arrest warrant lodged in the US district court of Maryland, IRS special agent Andrew Accardi alleges that Burton was a promoter of HyperFund, which also operated under the names HyperTech, HyperCapital, HyperVerse and HyperNation.\n\nThe court documents, reported by the website courtwatch.news and seen by the Guardian, refer to all of the schemes collectively as HyperFund.\n\nThe affidavit claims that an IRS analysis of Burton\u2019s personal and company bank records shows that from June 2020 to January 2022, Burton received 562 wire transfers or cashier\u2019s checks, totalling US$7,851,711, from individuals who wished to invest in HyperFund.\n\nThe affidavit also outlines how the scheme allegedly worked.\n\n\u201cHyperFund operated a purportedly legitimate decentralized finance, or \u2018DeFi,\u2019 cryptocurrency investment platform,\u201d Accardi states.\n\n\u201cA network of HyperFund promoters \u2026 made fraudulent promotional presentations to investors and potential investors. In those presentations, promoters touted HyperFund\u2019s investment programs, including the purported returns that prospective investors could earn from investing with HyperFund. Potential investors were told that they could purchase \u2018memberships\u2019 in the \u2018world\u2019s most sustainable passive rewards program\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe scheme falsely claimed that investors who purchased memberships would receive daily rewards of between 0.5% to 1% daily, until the investor\u2019s initial investment doubled or tripled in value, the affidavit alleges.\n\n\u201cTo convince investors that HyperFund could make these daily payments of passive rewards, HyperFund claimed that its payments would be disbursed in part from revenues generated from large-scale crypto mining operations,\u201d the affidavit says.\n\n\u201cIn fact, HyperFund did not have any such operations. To the extent investors saw the accrual of any rewards, those investors were paid with funds collected from more recent investors.\u201d\n\nA scheme using the funds of later investors to pay off early investors is commonly known as a Ponzi scheme, although this term is not used in the court documents.\n\nAccardi further alleges that of the 562 payments documented, 342 were made after HyperFund began blocking people from being able to make withdrawals in mid-2021.\n\n\u201cIn other words, in and after July 2021, Burton took investors\u2019 fiat currency and transferred worthless HU [hyper units] from his HyperFund account to investors\u2019 HyperFund Accounts.\u201d\n\nBurton, a 54-year-old American, has promoted his wealth on various social media channels, including boasting in March 2022 that he bought two Rolls-Royce cars on the same day.\n\nHe also recorded himself shopping for a $3.5m yacht, and claims to have bought a diamond-encrusted Audemars Piguet watch worth $1.4m.\n\nIn February 2021, Burton posted pictures on social media of himself with Ryan Xu in Dubai, calling him a \u201cmulti billionaire\u201d and an \u201camazing human\u201d.\n\nIn a video posted online of Xu speaking at a dinner with Burton for lunar new year, Xu says that \u201cwe are going to change the world together\u201d. Xu says he decided to travel to Dubai to meet HyperFund promoters because it was a \u201cvery special moment\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou guys, for so many hours, fly here to Dubai, so I think I should make my move and at least make everyone think we are family, we are united and we are going to change the world together.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the future of HyperFund, Xu says: \u201cWe are trying to revolutionise the entire financial system.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we come together and join the same platform, and we can have the same idea and then we can have the same consensus, and we keep recruiting our army, and one day if our army reaches one billion people, then the whole world belongs to us. That is our vision.\u201d\n\nBurton says in the video the plan is \u201csuper exciting\u201d.\n\nDuring the Dubai trip, Burton boasted in social media posts about eating steak enrobed with 24-carat gold and claimed he received $1,000 from the \u201cowner and founder of my current crypto program\u201d for a lunar new year gift, along with \u201ca nice Mont Blanc pen from our management team\u201d.\n\nHe also went on a shopping spree in Dubai, showing purchases from a range of luxury brands, including Louis Vuitton and Balenciaga."

        "content": "While stocks are off to a mixed start this week, Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is pushing higher once again, bolstered by expectations for the imminent approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) as soon as Wednesday. The widely anticipated move is expected to make the cryptocurrency more appealing to institutional and retail investors alike, potentially bringing waves of fresh capital into Bitcoin.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nAnd that's not the only positive catalyst for the cryptocurrency. Every four years, the amount of BTC in supply is cut by 50%, which increases demand for the largest cryptocurrency. The next \u201chalving\u201d event is scheduled in April 2024, and BTC has already surged around 70% since the end of April 2023.\n\nHistorically, Bitcoin has experienced four-year bull-bear cycles. It typically gains momentum six months prior to the halving event, which occurs every four years, and the bull run ends roughly 18 months after the halving event.\n\nAs prices of BTC mining companies are tied to Bitcoin, here are three blockchain stocks you can consider buying today.\n\nTeraWulf Stock\n\nValued at $464.9 million by market cap, TeraWulf (WULF) owns and operates vertically integrated Bitcoin mining facilities in the U.S. It has two BTC mining facilities located in New York and Pennsylvania, generating domestically produced Bitcoin powered by 91% zero-carbon energy resources such as nuclear, hydro and solar.\n\nIn December 2023, TeraWulf mined 334 Bitcoin worth $14.17 million. Comparatively, mining costs were much lower at $3.74 million. Due to rising BTC prices, TeraWulf is forecast to increase sales from $15 million in 2022 to $133 million in 2024.\n\nTeraWulf stated it will repay $14 million in debt with the cash generated in Q4, resulting in lower interest payments.\n\nOut of the five analysts covering WULF, four recommend \u201cstrong buy,\u201d and one recommends \u201cmoderate buy.\u201d The average target price for WULF is $3.40, indicating an upside potential of 70.8%.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nRiot Platforms Stock\n\nValued at $3.06 billion by market cap, Riot Platforms (RIOT) is among the largest Bitcoin mining companies globally. In 2023, Riot Platforms mined 6,626 BTC at an average price of $28,491. It ended the year with 7,362 BTC worth roughly $324 million.\n\nDue to the company\u2019s unique power strategy, it generated $71.6 million in power credits, equivalent to 2,480 Bitcoin, based on its average price during 2023. Moreover, Riot emphasized it will increase its self-mining hash rate to 28 EH/s by the end of 2024.\n\nOut of the 10 analysts covering RIOT, eight recommend \u201cstrong buy,\u201d one recommends \u201cmoderate buy,\u201d and one recommends \u201chold.\u201d The average target price for RIOT is $17.91, indicating an upside potential of 20%.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nCipher Mining Stock\n\nThe final BTC mining stock on my list is Cipher Mining (CIFR), valued at nearly $1 billion by market cap. The company increased mining production in December, despite continued growth in network hash rate.\n\nCipher stated it entered into transactions to acquire new mining rigs, fueling its ambitious growth plans. It also ended 2023 with $120 million in liquidity and no debt.\n\nOut of the seven analysts covering Cipher stock, five recommend \u201cstrong buy,\u201d one recommends \u201cmoderate buy,\u201d and one recommends \u201chold.\u201d The average target price for CIFR is $5.17, indicating an upside potential of 37.9%.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe approval of bitcoin spot ETFs could send the top cryptocurrency more than 300% higher by the end of next year, Standard Chartered Head of FX Research Geoff Kendrick wrote in a Monday note.\n\nThat comes as Wall Street is waiting for the Securities and Exchange Commission to greenlight the first of these ETFs by Wednesday, the reported deadline by which the agency must make a decision.\n\n\"If ETF-related inflows materialize as we expect, we think an end-2025 level closer to USD 200,000 is possible. This assumes that between 437,000 and 1.32mn new bitcoins will be held in spot US ETFs by end-2024,\" Kendrick wrote, estimating that inflows this year alone could be $50 billion-$100 billion.\n\nIf bitcoin reaches $200,000, that would represent a price surge of 344% from its current level of about $45,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce up and running, these ETFs would cause demand to soar, providing enough price upside for bitcoin to potentially reach $100,000 before the end of 2024, Kendrick previously forecast. His bullish forecast also sees supply falling, given the upcoming halving cycle and token hoarding by miners.\n\nIn determining his 2025 outlook for bitcoin, Kendrick drew a parallel with the first gold spot exchange-traded product and its price impact on the yellow metal.\n\nAfter SPDR Gold Shares came online in 2004, it gradually increased, multiplying more than fourfold in a seven-year span.\n\n\"We use this 4.3x increase as our base case for Bitcoin, but we expect the BTC gains to occur during a short one- to two-year period because we expect the BTC ETF market to mature more quickly,\" Kendrick said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also noted how bitcoin's price increased by a similar level when holdings in ETFs outside of the US jumped in 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, any increase in demand would have a large impact on bitcoin's price as the amount of immediately available supply is falling, Kendrick added.\n\n\"This measure is at an all-time low as a percentage of total supply in circulation,\" he said. \"In other words, supply is more price-inelastic than it has ever been.\""

        "content": "Gary Gensler, chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), cautioned investors about the high risks and volatility of cryptocurrency assets on Monday in a post on X (formerly Twitter), as the Web3 industry anticipates the SEC\u2019s decision on several spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications.\n\n\u201cInvestments in crypto assets also can be exceptionally risky & are often volatile. A number of major platforms & crypto assets have become insolvent and/or lost value. Investments in crypto assets continue to be subject to significant risk,\u201d Gensler said.\n\nThe SEC chief\u2019s warning did not specifically reference the proposed ETFs but coincided with a series of amended Form S-1 filings, also known as the initial registration forms for new securities.\n\nThe agency is expected to respond to the applications, which include submissions from industry heavyweights such as BlackRock, Ark Invest/21Shares, and Fidelity, by January 10, with the potential for a landmark approval that could introduce the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF has been long-awaited and could signal a new era of mainstream investment opportunities for digital assets. Such a move would not only provide a regulated investment vehicle for Bitcoin but could also pave the way for further integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional financial systems.\n\nThe amended S-1 filings by various asset managers are seen as a final step before potential approval, with some firms even slashing fees to attract investors to their prospective ETF products. For instance, ARK Invest and 21Shares have proposed waiving their 0.25% fee for the first six months for the initial US$1 billion in assets under management, while BlackRock has set a competitive ongoing fee of 0.3%.\n\nWhile the commission has the option to deny the applications, recent legal developments, such as a federal judge\u2019s order for the SEC to reconsider a previously denied spot Bitcoin ETF application from Grayscale Investments, the operator of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin fund, suggest that the regulator\u2019s rationale for any decision will be closely examined.\n\nThe potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States would follow in the footsteps of its neighbor, Canada, which permitted the listing of such products on exchanges starting in 2021."

        "title": "Price war for spot bitcoin ETF heats up ahead of key SEC ruling - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nA fee war has broken out among the asset managers hoping to launch spot bitcoin exchange traded funds in the US, even though the US regulator has not yet indicated whether it will allow the products to be sold.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest fund manager, said in a regulatory filing on Monday that it would charge customers just 0.2 per cent of the net asset value of its fund for the first year or until its ETF hits $5bn in assets before rising to 0.3 per cent\n\nRival applicant Ark Investment Management, which had previously indicated it would charge 0.80 per cent of its bitcoin holdings, offered to waive fees for the first six months, or until its ETF\u2019s assets reach $1bn. Thereafter its fee will be set at 0.25 per cent. Invesco likewise will waive fees for six months or the fund\u2019s first $5bn before settling at 0.59 per cent.\n\nThe latest moves are the final touches to regulatory filings ahead of an expected decision this week from the Securities and Exchange Commission on whether to permit stock market funds that invest directly in bitcoin. If approved, funds could be launched in a matter of days.\n\nBitcoin last month soared to a 20-month high of $44,000, and this week has climbed more than 5 per cent to about $45,200 as investor anticipation builds ahead of the SEC potentially giving the green light to several applicants.\n\nBecause the products are similar \u2014 they are all designed to hold bitcoin \u2014 fees and to a lesser extent firm branding will be a key part of how the applicants distinguish themselves in a crowded market.\n\n\u201cThis is a classic price war. How do you prove that your ETF is any better than anybody else\u2019s? The only way you can compete is on price,\u201d said James Angel, faculty affiliate at Georgetown McDonough\u2019s Psaros Center to Financial Markets and Policy.\n\nFor a decade the SEC has resisted applications for a spot bitcoin ETF, arguing that bitcoin prices are set on unregulated exchanges and thus it cannot give adequate investor protections. But pressure has been growing on the regulator since it lost a court ruling last summer on its reasons for blocking an ETF application by asset management firm Grayscale.\n\nGrayscale itself on Monday said it would drop its fee from 2 per cent to 1.5 per cent. The remaining list of applicants, including WisdomTree, Valkyrie and Fidelity are all offering fee structures comfortably below one per cent.\n\n\u201cGrayscale is in a difficult position because they were the very first mover in the field, and it was the only way to get in. Now they face competition,\u201d Angel added.\n\nAll of the providers are hoping to benefit from a rush into the asset class akin to the $1bn that flooded into ProShares when it offered the first-ever bitcoin futures ETF in late 2021. That fund hit the $1bn threshold in just the first two days of trading, and now holds about $1.8bn in net assets.\n\n\u201cWith a bitcoin spot ETF, we\u2019re opening the doors to Wall Street,\u201d said Jad Comair, chief executive of Melanion Capital."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Marathon Digital Jumped Today - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Several major cryptocurrencies jumped on Monday as investors anticipate the first potential approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of spot Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) later this week. In particular, the SEC is widely expected to issue a favorable determination for Ark Invest's 21Shares Bitcoin ETF application before Wednesday.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin surged 6.7% by the end of the regular trading day, after briefly exceeding the $47,000 milestone for the first time since April 2022. Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) is also up more than 6%, while Marathon Digital (NASDAQ: MARA) -- a crypto mining firm whose fortunes tend to ebb and flow with the price of Bitcoin -- rose as much as 10.5% this morning before settling to close up 7.7%.\n\nCrypto investors have marked their calendars for Jan. 10\n\nThe price of Bitcoin alone has nearly tripled over the past year. But its rally more recently gained steam back in October 2023 after the SEC declined to appeal a federal court's August reversal of an order that had prevented crypto-asset manager Grayscale Investments from converting its popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. When the D.C. Circuit of Appeals subsequently formalized Grayscale's court win the following week, the onus moved back to the SEC to move forward with its approval processes for several other pending spot ETF applications from providers including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest.\n\nFast-forward to today's rally -- and as I noted back in October -- the first of those deadlines happens to be this Wednesday, Jan. 10. That's specifically the date by which the SEC must approve or deny Ark Invest's open application for its \"21Shares\" Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThis is a big deal for the crypto market as a whole because ETFs would be a much more accessible medium for investors to put their money to work in cryptocurrency assets, at least compared to setting up a separate crypto account or wallet with a crypto-specific broker. ETF shares can also be bought and sold throughout the trading day through virtually any broker, similar to publicly traded stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nExpect several spot Bitcoin ETF approvals at once\n\nFew expect Ark Invest's 21Shares to be the only spot Bitcoin ETF to receive approval this week, however.\n\nThe SEC could technically approve or deny each individual spot Bitcoin ETF application as their respective deadlines arrive in the coming months. But that would also effectively mean the earliest to receive approvals enjoy a so-called \"first-mover\" advantage, with the lion's share of investors' capital flowing into those early spot Bitcoin ETFs right away. That would be a massive windfall for those ETF providers, considering some estimates indicate the approval of Bitcoin ETFs could potentially increase the value of the overall crypto market by more than $1 trillion.\n\nInstead, the SEC will almost certainly approve multiple applications in tandem with the Ark Invest 21Shares deadline this week. This scenario has been repeatedly supported by industry watchers observing several hopeful ETF providers simultaneously filing amended registration statements with the SEC over the past few months. Indeed, just last week crypto news site Cointelegraph reported that Ark 21Shares, VanEck Bitcoin Trust, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, and Fidelity's spot Bitcoin ETF each filed new 8-A Forms with the SEC to register their shares as securities listed on multiple exchanges, indicating they're in the late stages of approval.\n\nThat said, investors shouldn't ignore the risk (however unlikely at this stage) that the SEC might deny those multiple spot Bitcoin ETF applications this week. The SEC previously rejected Ark's proposal almost exactly one year ago, for example, citing a lack of measures \"to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts.\" If the regulatory body offers any similar unexpected opposition this time, I would be shocked if assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Marathon Digital didn't experience a sharp pullback as crypto investors took their recent profits off the table.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Bitcoin wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Bitcoin ETFs Could Launch This Week. Here's How Much You'll Pay in Fees and Why It Might Be Worth It. - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Thirteen spot Bitcoin (BTC -8.83%) ETFs are currently awaiting approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nUp to this point, the SEC has denied similar exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications, but an appellate court ruled the SEC's rejection was \"arbitrary and capricious.\"\n\nThe approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF would be big news for investors of all sorts. Whether you're heavily invested in crypto or simply stashing money away in a retirement account, it's worth paying attention to the SEC's decision. It could open the door for many more investors to easily put their money to work in the emerging crypto asset class.\n\nWhy the new breed of Bitcoin ETFs is big news\n\nExisting Bitcoin funds like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust use derivatives like futures contracts to track the price of Bitcoin. However, those funds cannot actually redeem Bitcoin futures for the underlying asset, which can result in prices that diverge widely from the actual value of Bitcoin. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust notably traded at almost a 50% discount to its net asset value in late 2022.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF, on the other hand, will actually hold Bitcoin. That means the ETF will be able to track the value of the cryptocurrency much more closely.\n\nAdditionally, since the funds will hold Bitcoin instead of a derivative, it makes it more transparent for investors as to what they're buying. Each share of the ETF will correspond with a certain amount of Bitcoin held by the fund.\n\nThat said, spot Bitcoin ETFs will still charge fees for shareholders in the form of expense ratios. And with such strong interest in the new breed of ETFs, it's important for investors to pay attention to these fees and what they mean for their investment.\n\nHere's how much you'll pay in fees to own a Bitcoin ETF\n\nThe following four fund companies have detailed how much they plan to charge investors holding their respective Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nFund Expense Ratio Fidelity Wise Origin 0.39% Invesco Galaxy 0.59% Valkyrie 0.8% ARK 21Shares 0.8%\n\nInvesco Galaxy plans to waive the fee for the first six months for the first $5 billion in invested assets. That's not an uncommon strategy for new funds entering a competitive market. However, it might not be worth it for long-term investors to try to buy shares of the Invesco fund and then switch to a lower-cost fund after the free period expires once you account for taxes.\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that most of the proposed ETFs haven't detailed their fees. Blackrock is notably missing from the above list. Given the size of the fund company, investors should expect it to offer a relatively low fee.\n\nMost importantly for investors, it should be noted that the published fees are all well below the expense ratios for existing Bitcoin investment products. Grayscale charges a 2% management fee. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF charges 0.95%. So, not only will investors get a fund that tracks Bitcoin better, it will be cheaper, too.\n\nOn top of that, there are a few other reasons investors may want to pay the fees for a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe benefits of Bitcoin ETFs\n\nFor many investors, a spot Bitcoin ETF will be the easiest and safest way to invest in the cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile it's simple enough to open an account at a crypto exchange and buy Bitcoin, it's not so simple to open a retirement account with a crypto exchange. You'll have to establish your own self-directed individual retirement account (IRA) and use that to open and fund an account with a cryptocurrency exchange. And that's not cheap. For most investors simply looking to use Bitcoin for portfolio diversification, an ETF makes much more sense despite the fees.\n\nThere's also the convenience of being able to hold your Bitcoin investment in the same account as your other investments. That gives you a better picture of your overall portfolio without having to aggregate everything across multiple accounts.\n\nFor many investors, the technical hurdles involved in buying and securely holding Bitcoin can be cumbersome. With an ETF, the managing institution will take care of those technical aspects. The institution will likely use multiple levels of security and cold storage to maximize the safety of the Bitcoin it holds for investors.\n\nUltimately, the fees on the new spot Bitcoin ETFs are extremely reasonable, even compared to standard index funds. Take for instance the Invesco QQQ Trust, which tracks the Nasdaq 100 index. It charges an expense ratio of 0.2%. So, paying as little as 0.39% for a Bitcoin ETF isn't going to break the bank."

        "content": "\u00d7 Message From Our President\n\nDear Students, Faculty, Staff and Friends,\n\nI am pleased to present to you this Guide to our plans for the upcoming fall semester and reopening of our campuses. In form and in content, this coming semester will be like no other. We will live differently, work differently and learn differently. But in its very difference rests its enormous power.\n\n\n\nThe mission of Yeshiva University is to enrich the moral, intellectual and spiritual development of each of our students, empowering them with the knowledge and abilities to become people of impact and leaders of tomorrow. Next year\u2019s studies will be especially instrumental in shaping the course of our students\u2019 lives. Character is formed and developed in times of deep adversity. This is the kind of teachable moment that Yeshiva University was made for. As such, we have developed an educational plan for next year that features a high-quality student experience and prioritizes personal growth during this Coronavirus era. Our students will be able to work through the difficulties, issues and opportunities posed by our COVID-19 era with our stellar rabbis and faculty, as well as their close friends and peers at Yeshiva.\n\nTo develop our plans for the fall, we have convened a Scenario Planning Task Force made up of representatives across the major areas of our campus. Their planning has been guided by the latest medical information, government directives, direct input from our rabbis, faculty and students, and best practices from industry and university leaders across the country. I am deeply thankful to our task force members and all who supported them for their tireless work in addressing the myriad details involved in bringing students back to campus and restarting our educational enterprise.\n\n\n\nIn concert with the recommendations from our task force, I am announcing today that our fall semester will reflect a hybrid model. It will allow many students to return in a careful way by incorporating online and virtual learning with on-campus classroom instruction. It also enables students who prefer to not be on campus to have a rich student experience by continuing their studies online and benefitting from a full range of online student services and extracurricular programs.\n\n\n\nIn bringing our students back to campus, safety is our first priority. Many aspects of campus life will change for this coming semester. Gatherings will be limited, larger courses will move completely online. Throughout campus everyone will need to adhere to our medical guidelines, including social distancing, wearing facemasks, and our testing and contact tracing policies. Due to our focus on minimizing risk, our undergraduate students will begin the first few weeks of the fall semester online and move onto the campus after the Jewish holidays. This schedule will limit the amount of back and forth travel for our students by concentrating the on-campus component of the fall semester to one consecutive segment.\n\n\n\nThroughout our planning, we have used the analogy of a dimmer switch. Reopening our campuses will not be a simple binary, like an on/off light switch, but more like a dimmer in which we have the flexibility to scale backwards and forwards to properly respond as the health situation evolves. It is very possible that some plans could change, depending upon the progression of the virus and/or applicable state and local government guidance.\n\n\n\nBefore our semester begins, we will provide more updates reflecting our most current guidance. Please check our website, yu.edu/fall2020 for regular updates. We understand that even after reading through this guide, you might have many additional questions, so we will be posting an extensive FAQ section online as well. Additionally, we will also be holding community calls for faculty, students, staff and parents over the next couple of months.\n\n\n\nPlanning for the future during this moment has certainly been humbling. This Coronavirus has reminded us time and time again of the lessons from our Jewish tradition that we are not in full control of our circumstances. But our tradition also teaches us that we are in control of our response to our circumstances. Next semester will present significant challenges and changes. There will be some compromises and minor inconveniences--not every issue has a perfect solution. But faith and fortitude, mutual cooperation and resilience are essential life lessons that are accentuated during this period. And if we all commit to respond with graciousness, kindness, and love, we can transform new campus realities into profound life lessons for our future.\n\n\n\nDeeply rooted in our Jewish values and forward focused in preparing for the careers and competencies of the future, we journey together with you, our Yeshiva University community, through these uncharted waters. Next year will be a formative year in the lives of our students, and together we will rise to the moment so that our students will emerge stronger and better prepared to be leaders of the world of tomorrow.\n\n\n\nBest Wishes,\n\n\n\nAri Berman"

        "title": "Here's Why Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy Are Buying All the Bitcoin They Can Get Their Hands On - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "For many equity investors, Michael Saylor may not be a household name. But for crypto investors, Michael Saylor is legendary for his bullish stance on Bitcoin (BTC -8.28%), as well as for some of his more outlandish takes on social media about the future of crypto. His company, MicroStrategy (MSTR -5.06%), is now the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world, and it's not even close. After buying an additional $615 million worth of Bitcoin at the end of 2023, his company now owns close to 1% of all Bitcoin in the world.\n\nEven more remarkably, MicroStrategy only started buying Bitcoin back in 2020, more than a decade after Bitcoin originally launched. But in the past three-plus years, Saylor and his company have consistently added to their Bitcoin position, through a variety of different market conditions. So what's behind this push to buy as much Bitcoin as they possibly can?\n\nBitcoin as a long-term store of value\n\nAs Saylor has reiterated over and over again, Bitcoin is the single best store of value over the long haul -- even better than gold. In fact, Saylor has even opined that the market cap of Bitcoin (now just under $1 trillion) could one day approach the market cap of physical gold, which is estimated to be around $13 trillion.\n\nThere are several reasons for this admittedly audacious point of view. One is that Bitcoin has a limited lifetime supply. According to the algorithm powering Bitcoin, the total lifetime supply of Bitcoin is capped at just 21 million coins. The current circulating supply is close to 19.5 million coins, so we are getting close to the point where all the Bitcoin that will ever be created has already been created.\n\nAs Bitcoin adoption surges on a global scale, it will increase its relative scarcity. More people will be vying to gain access to a very limited supply, and over time, that is going to boost the price of Bitcoin. It's just basic economics. With supply largely unchanged, and demand going through the roof, the price of Bitcoin should soar.\n\nMoreover, the limited supply of Bitcoin makes it attractive for another reason: It is arguably the single-best hedge against inflation over the long term. While gold investors may find this point highly debatable, the underlying logic does make a certain amount of sense, especially when you compare Bitcoin to fiat currency (i.e., currency controlled by governments and central banks, such as the U.S. dollar).\n\nThis is due to the fact that an algorithm carefully controls the rate at which new Bitcoin is created. In fact, every four years, Bitcoin actually becomes more deflationary when the rate of new Bitcoin creation is cut in half (i.e., \"the halving\"). In contrast, a central bank can (theoretically) print as much money as it wants, which is what can lead to inflation and even hyperinflation.\n\nTakeaway lessons for the average investor\n\nPutting this all together, I think there are several lessons for the average investor. Perhaps the most important lesson is the need for a long-term outlook. As Saylor has pointed out over and over again, his Bitcoin strategy is not a short-term trading strategy. This is all about buying Bitcoin for the long haul, and letting the market do its magic.\n\nAnother key lesson is the need to stick to a buy-and-hold strategy, through a variety of different market conditions. Yes, MicroStrategy started accumulating Bitcoin during the last bull market rally, at a time when Bitcoin was skyrocketing to an all-time high of $69,000. But the company was not afraid to add to its position during the crypto market downturn, and Saylor now looks like a market savant, with Bitcoin poised for its next major market rally.\n\nFinally, it's never too late to invest in an asset if you truly believe in its long-term potential for price appreciation. Saylor and MicroStrategy regularly update the public on just how much Bitcoin they own, as well as the average purchase cost of each Bitcoin. Remarkably, the average cost of a single Bitcoin for Saylor at the end of November was $30,252. In essence, that means he completely missed out on the period of time (an entire decade!) in which Bitcoin surged from $1 to $30,000. So, no, it's not too late to invest in Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin for the long haul\n\nIt's easy to understand why Saylor is so unabashedly bullish on Bitcoin. But before you rush out and buy Bitcoin, make sure you fully understand the reason why Saylor is buying Bitcoin hand over fist. It's not just because Bitcoin is soaring in price -- it's because Bitcoin has certain inherent properties that make it valuable over the long haul.\n\nDespite the risk and volatility of crypto, the long-term outlook certainly seems bullish for Bitcoin. When Saylor recently appeared on CNBC, he suggested that Bitcoin had the potential to increase in value by 10x. At its current price of $44,000, a 10x valuation multiple means that a single Bitcoin could theoretically one day be worth close to half a million dollars. Own just two Bitcoins, and you could one day become a millionaire."

        "content": "After months of court cases and endless filings, the Securities and Exchange Commission looks poised to approve the first spot Bitcoin ETFs this week. In anticipation of the floodgates opening, issuers are attempting to undercut one another by offering low fees to investors.\n\nIf the SEC moves forward with spot Bitcoin ETFs, which provide investors exposure to the current price of Bitcoin without having to hold the volatile cryptocurrency, it will kick off a race between major players like BlackRock and Fidelity that are hoping to plant a flag in a market potentially worth billions.\n\nBesides factors like name recognition and trust, the fees charged by issuers are one of the clearest ways to attract early investors. Last week, two issuers\u2014Fidelity and Mike Novogratz\u2019s Galaxy/Invesco ETF\u2014released the first indications of what pricing would look like. Fidelity set its fee at 0.39%, while Galaxy put its fee at 0.59%, also announcing it would waive fees for the first six months of operation and $5 billion in assets held.\n\nFilings on Monday escalated the arms race. The crypto-native fund manager Bitwise squeaked in with the lowest fee, 0.24%, while the ETF and mutual fund manager VanEck set the second-lowest overall fee at 0.25%, also announcing last week it would donate 5% of its Bitcoin ETF profits to the group of developers, known as Bitcoin Core, who maintain the blockchain. Several other issuers came close, with Franklin Templeton setting its fee at 0.29% and BlackRock\u2019s iShares ETF announcing a 0.3% fee.\n\nOthers, including Bitwise and BlackRock, aim to sweeten the pot of early entrants by following Galaxy\u2019s model and waiving fees for a set period and for the amount invested at the beginning of the process. In a further attempt to compete with its more traditional competitors, Bitwise said it would waive fees for the first six months or $1 billion invested. Close on its heels, BlackRock set its waiver period at 12 months or $5 billion invested.\n\nThe 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, released in partnership with Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest, set a waiver period of six months or $1 billion, with a fee of 0.25% after.\n\nI have been talking for months about how fees will be driven down by these ETFs and how it will be good for end-investors. But honestly even i'm surprised at how low things are right now pic.twitter.com/rDYRXlyPfm \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 8, 2024\n\nGrayscale, which paved the way for SEC approval of Bitcoin ETFs through its landmark court case against the agency decided last year, set a less competitive rate of 1.5%\u2014still lower than the current fee of 2% for its Bitcoin trust. \u201cHard to imagine [an] advisor (where the big money is) picking a 1.5% ETF when others [are] sub 40pbs,\u201d said Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas on X/Twitter.\n\nGrayscale may have a different advantage over competitors, however. Unlike other issuers, which are creating new offerings, Grayscale is \u201cuplisting\u201d its existing Bitcoin trust, which has long been one of the most popular investment vehicles in the digital asset space. As Fortune previously reported, there is still a possibility that this process means Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF is the first out of the gate. Even so, the SEC seems set on having coordinated launches to avoid a situation like ProShares\u2019 Bitcoin futures ETF, which launched in 2021 and has captured over 90% market share.\n\n$2 billion\n\nFor now, the date to watch is Jan. 10, the deadline for the SEC to decide on the next ETF application in line\u2014ARK 21Shares. Bloomberg reported that issuers have been given until Monday morning to submit the last revisions to their applications, with the SEC set to vote on the filings midweek.\n\nMany in the crypto industry are hoping Bitcoin ETFs will finally encourage traditional investors, from wealth managers to everyday traders, to enter the market. In an X Spaces last week, the head of digital assets research for VanEck said that he heard BlackRock has $2 billion of capital lined up from existing Bitcoin holders who want to put their funds into spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nRather than buying Bitcoin on exchanges like Coinbase, or self-custodying the asset through hardware wallets, Bitcoin ETFs would allow investors to hold the cryptocurrency through their brokerage accounts for a small fee. The process would not be immune from the risks of the crypto industry. Coinbase, for example, is still set to be the Bitcoin custodian for the vast majority of the issuers\u2014an irony given its ongoing lawsuit against the SEC.\n\nEven with optimism that the agency is set to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs, there is still a possibility that the commissioners and Chair Gary Gensler will delay or reject the applications. On Saturday, Balchunas tweeted that he estimates a 5% chance of rejection, which would likely spur additional court cases. \u201cYou gotta leave a little window open for these things,\u201d he wrote."

        "content": "Multiple applicants for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) have been rushing to file their final Form S-1 amendments to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday, Jan. 8, as expected.\n\nAsset manager Valkyrie was among the first companies to file its final S-1 amendment before Jan. 10, the widely expected date for the first spot Bitcoin ETFs to be approved in the United States.\n\nValkyrie was followed by WisdomTree, BlackRock, VanEck, Invesco and Galaxy, Grayscale (S-3 filing), ARK Invest and 21Shares, Fidelity, Bitwise and Franklin Templeton.\n\nThe new filings open a potentially historic week for Bitcoin as the hopeful issuers are expected to finalize their Form S-1 amendments today. The S-1 amendments include information about fees or identities of the market makers for the potential ETFs.\n\nSome filers have significantly cut fees for trading the potential spot Bitcoin ETF products. According to the latest S-1 from ARK and 21Shares, the ETF sponsor will waive its 0.25% fee during a six-month period from the day of listing for the first $1 billion in assets under management (AUM).\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF will charge 0.3% after an initial 0.2% fee for the first 12 months or $5 billion in AUM.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the ongoing fee war between possible spot Bitcoin ETFs will unlikely change much in terms of competition at this point.\n\n\u201cHistorically this hasn\u2019t moved the needle much.

The trust will use the amount to acquire Bitcoin \u201cat or prior\u201d to listing shares on the Cboe BZX Exchange.\n\nUnlike S-1 filers, Grayscale Investments submitted an updated S-3 form registration statement, setting a 1.5% spot Bitcoin ETF fee. The firm mentioned Jane Street, Virtu, Flow Traders and Flowdesk as designated liquidity providers. Grayscale also listed Jane Street, Virtu, Macquarie and ABN Amro as authorized participants.\n\nAt the time of writing, 10 potential issuers have filed updated S-1s, meaning that these firms are \"in theory\" ready to become the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, according to Fox Business' Eleanor Terrett. Hashdex could still join the first wave of ETFs if it submits a last-minute filing today, Terrett noted.\n\nMagazine: How to protect your crypto in a volatile market \u2014 Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in"

        "content": "Swan Bitcoin\u2019s chief executive sits opposite most in the cryptocurrency world. For starters, Cory Klippsten says he is not in crypto.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in crypto, I\u2019m in financial services focused on Bitcoin,\u201d Klippsten said.\n\nHis company\u2019s Bicoin exclusivity has proven to be a key differentiator in the decentralized finance world. While some of the largest trading platforms tumbled this year following the collapse of FTX and Binance, Swan reports it raised and deployed $205 million across its equity and credit lines of business.\n\nFounded in 2019, Swan Bitcoin began as a financial services firm that sets up investment plans for wealthy families and investors. Last month, Swan launched Swan Institutional, a unit broadening its reach into private equity, Bitcoin-backed lending, financial advisor services, asset management and a Bitcoin-centric trust company. Through these different business lines, Swan Bitcoin falls more within the definition of a Bitcoin holding company. The company currently generates $125 million in revenue per year, and its first asset management fund, called Timechain Alpha, was fully subscribed with $50 million now under management.\n\nTo manage this expansion, Swan raised $40 million last year and is gearing up to raise $150 million in this year\u2019s first quarter.\n\nInvestors may be following the footsteps of private equity firm Blackrock, which met with the SEC about its Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund application last year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all changing now because you have the largest, most credible, trusted financial firms in the world and they\u2019re going to be marketing their Bitcoin ETFs,\u201d Klippsten said. \u201cIf we want a piece of that, there\u2019s a bunch of product we have that they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nBitcoin democratization\n\nBitcoin has regained a strong market foothold, trading at more than $43,000 this month, marking a strong rebound from its lows in 2022.\n\nDespite the recent highs, newcomers to the space could still be thrown by Bitcoin\u2019s volatility, which is why Swan is building a financial advisor consulting arm acting as a go-to source for those unable to field specific questions on Bitcoin\u2019s infrastructure and technological operations. Swan Advisor Services works with over 30 registered investment advisory firms in the U.S. as consultants.\n\n\u201cThe consensus is developing that ignoring Bitcoin is irresponsible, and potentially a breach of financial advisor\u2019s fiduciary duties,\u201d said Ryan Flynn, a managing director of Swan Advisor.\n\nWhen partnering with Swan, advisors can buy, hold and manage \u201creal\u201d bitcoin for clients. The real designation means the Bitcoin transacting avoids rehypothecation, a policy Swan holds across all its products that promises clients hold real bitcoin, not proxies or currency equivalents.\n\nSwan believes Bitcoin is a \u201cpristine\u201d asset to leverage in the capital markets due to its reliability. However, the currency can be volatile when crypto markets come under pressure, as seen in its 80%-plus dip last year."

Accordingly, Mining Difficulty1 also increased approximately 100% year over year, from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023, as per www.blockchain.com. This is how HIVE maintained approximately 1% of the total Bitcoin rewards mined in calendar 2023.\n\nHIVE ended the 2023 calendar year with approximately $17 million in cash and a Bitcoin HODL position of 1,704 BTC. As mentioned in the Company's December 19, 2023, news release, the Company's HODL strategy is such that it anticipates to be able to HODL all its Bitcoin until the upcoming Halving which is expected to be in April 2024 after which the number of new Bitcoin mined per day will drop to 450 Bitcoins per day.\n\nStory continues\n\nBitmain S19k Pro Update\n\nHIVE also announces that further to its news releases dated November 14, 2023, and December 4, 2023, all 9,800 of the Bitmain S19k Pro Antminers ordered by the Company have shipped. Currently approximately 70% have been installed, and it is expected that 100% of these machines will be installed before January 2024 month-end. After these miners are installed, it is expected that HIVE will have 4.8 EH/s of ASICs with an average fleet efficiency of 28.7 J/TH.\n\nIn addition, further to its news release dated December 21, 2023, upon the completion of the installation of the 7,000 Bitmain S21 Antminers ordered in December 2023, which will begin in January 2024 and is expected to be completed in June 2024, it is expected that HIVE will have an average fleet efficiency of 25 J/TH and a total of 5.6 EH/s of active mining capacity.\n\nAbout HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd.\n\nHIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. went public in 2017 as the first cryptocurrency mining company listed for trading on the TSX Venture Exchange with a sustainable green or renewable energy focus. HIVE's electricity is sourced from hydro and geothermal facilities in Sweden, Canada and Iceland.\n\nHIVE is a growth-oriented technology stock in the emergent blockchain industry. As a company whose shares trade on major stock exchanges, we are building a bridge between the digital currency and blockchain sector and traditional capital markets. HIVE owns green energy-powered data centre facilities in Canada, Sweden, and Iceland, where we endeavour to source green energy to mine digital assets such as Bitcoin on the cloud. Since the beginning of 2021, HIVE has held in secure storage the majority of its treasury of BTC derived from mining rewards. Our shares provide investors with exposure to the operating margins of digital currency mining, as well as a portfolio of Bitcoin. Because HIVE also owns hard assets such as data centers and advanced multi-use servers, we believe our shares offer investors an attractive way to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency space.\n\nWe encourage you to visit HIVE's YouTube channel here to learn more about HIVE.\n\nFor more information and to register to HIVE's mailing list, please visit www.HIVEdigitaltechnologies.com.

        "title": "Markets News, Jan. 8, 2024: Big Tech Boosts Nasdaq as Stocks Rebound; Bitcoin Hits $47K - Investopedia",
        "content": "Equity Indexes Wrap: Big Gains for Big Tech; Oil Stocks Tumble The Dow Salesforce (CRM) and Intel (INTC) led the Dow higher, rising 4% and 3.3%, respectively, as conviction returned to tech stocks after last week\u2019s sell-off. Apple (AAPL) rose 2.4% after it announced its Vision Pro virtual reality headset would launch on Feb. 2. The headset starts at $3,499. Nike (NKE) shares gained 1.5% amid reports it was ending its nearly three-decade partnership with golf legend Tiger Woods. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) inched up 0.2% after it said it would buy biotech Ambrx Biopharma (AMAM) for about $2 billion to expand its cancer treatment pipeline. Merck (MRK) also crept higher on an acquisition. It rose 0.1% after offering to buy Harpoon Therapeutics (HARP) for $680 million. Boeing (BA) tumbled 8% after the FAA ordered some of its 737 Max 9 jets temporarily grounded for inspection after part of an Alaska Airlines plane\u2019s fuselage detached shortly after take-off on Friday. Chevron (CVX) slipped 0.6%, one of several oil majors to fall after Saudi Arabia cut prices on February orders of its Arab Light Crude.\n\nThe S&P 500 American Airlines (AAL) led the index, adding 7.2% after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to \u201coverweight\u201d from \u201cequalweight.\u201d But the index got the biggest boost from big tech as Microsoft (MSFT) added 1.9% and Amazon (AMZN) rose 2.7%. Alphabet (GOOGL) gained 2.3%. Oil companies lagged as oil prices slumped about 4% on Riyadh\u2019s price cuts. Schlumberger (SLB) fell 3% while ConocoPhillips (COP) dropped 1.8% and ExxonMobil (XOM) lost 1.7%. Bank of America (BAC) fell 0.8% after it said it would book a $1.6 billion charge related to Bloomberg\u2019s discontinuation of a short-term rate the bank used in various lending programs.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 Chip stocks rebounded from last week\u2019s slump, led by Marvell Technologies (MRVL), up 7%. Nvidia (NVDA) rose 6.4% after it unveiled three new chips designed to run artificial intelligence on personal computers. Competitor Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) rose 5.5% on the release of its own AI PC chip. Cybersecurity firms CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) and Fortinet (FTNT) climbed 5.6% and x%, respectively. DoorDash (DOOR) rose 3.9% after getting upgraded to \u201cbuy\u201d by analysts at Jefferies. Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes (BKR) fell 2.9% alongside oil prices. Regeneron (REGN) shares lost 1.1% after the drugmaker said sales of its best-selling drug Eylea fell short of Wall Street estimates in the fourth quarter.\n\nOil Futures, Stocks Tumble as Saudi Arabia Slashes Prices Oil futures plummeted Monday after Saudi Arabia cut prices for February shipments of crude oil as it contends with robust global supply. West Texas Intermediate futures contracts fell 4% Monday to trade at less than $71 a barrel. Brent crude, the European benchmark, fell a little over 3% to trade around $76. State-owned Saudi Aramco cut prices on its Arab Light Crude by $2 a barrel for Asian customers, its largest market. It also lowered prices for deliveries to Europe and North America. While analysts had expected prices to be lowered, Monday\u2019s cuts were larger than expected. The move comes as oil demand in Asia moderates and ample oil enters the market despite a series of production cuts by Saudi Arabia and its OPEC+ allies. In particular, U.S. oil, which was being pumped at record rates at the end of 2023, has helped keep a cap on oil prices even amid mounting geopolitical tensions that risk disrupting supply and trade. Shares of some of the world's largest oil companies were sharply lower Monday. ExxonMobil (XOM) lost about 2% while Chevron (CVX) dipped about 1%.\n\nApple Shares Climb After Vision Pro Launch Date Is Set for Feb. 2 Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares climbed during intraday trading on Monday after the iPhone maker announced a launch date early next month for its Vision Pro virtual reality (VR) headset. The spatial computer headset will launch in the U.S. on Feb. 2, with preorders opening on Jan. 19. It will cost $3,499, with prescription lens add-ons costing $149. The Vision Pro could allow Apple to compete with Meta's (META) Quest 3 headset, which held 55% market share for VR headsets in the third quarter of 2023, according to IT market intelligence firm International Data Corp. Jefferies Group securities analysts project that Apple will capture just 4% of VR headset market share, with around 400,000 units shipped in 2024. The firm noted that Vision Pro is to be sold at a higher price point than other comparable headsets like the Meta Quest 3, which starts at about $500. Apple shares were up nearly 2% Monday afternoon. -Naomi Buchanan\n\nNvidia Stock Hits Record as It Unveils AI PC Chips Nvidia (NVDA) on Monday unveiled three new graphics processing units (GPU) designed to power artificial intelligence on personal computers, adding to its suite of market-leading AI chips. The GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series, announced today ahead of the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, \u201cdeliver up to 836 trillion operations per second, bringing transformative AI capabilities to gaming, creating and everyday productivity.\u201d The company also said major computer manufacturers, including Dell, HP, and Samsung, were releasing AI GPU-equipped laptops, \u201cbringing a full set of generative AI capabilities to users right out of the box.\u201d The announcement comes as Nvidia, the leading supplier of AI chips to data centers, seeks to expand its AI offering and fend off competitors eager to grow their slice of the massive AI pie. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), one of Nvidia\u2019s fiercest competitors, unveiled AI PC chips of its own on Monday. It said its Ryzen 8000G Series chips are the first PC processors to contain a dedicated AI neural processing unit. Intel (INTC) preempted both Nvidia and AMD when, in December, it launched its set of AI PC chips. Chipmakers were among the S&P 500\u2019s best-performing stocks Monday. Nvidia shares were more than 4.5% Monday afternoon, while AMD rose more than 5%. Intel shares traded more than 3.5% higher.\n\nBoeing Shares Plummet After FAA Grounds 737 MAX 9 Fleet Boeing (BA) shares tumbled in early trading Monday after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) temporarily grounded certain Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft for inspections. The FAA's directive comes after an incident Friday in which an Alaska Airlines (ALK) Max 9 lost a panel mid-flight, forcing an emergency landing. About 171 Boeing aircraft in the U.S. or operated by U.S. airlines outside the U.S. are impacted by the FAA's investigation to address potential door safety issues before resuming flights. \"We agree with and fully support the FAA's decision to require immediate inspections of 737-9 airplanes with the same configuration as the affected airplane,\" Boeing said in a statement. Shares of Boeing were down 6.8% at $232 per share midday Monday but remained up about 13% in the last year. -Fatima Attarwala\n\nCrocs Shares Jump on Record Sales Forecast Shares of Crocs (CROX) jumped 20% Monday morning after the casual shoemaker said full-year sales would exceed its prior guidance after a strong holiday season. The company said in a statement that it expects sales to grow 1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, surpassing its November forecast of sales declining between 1% and 4%. Subsequently, the company estimated that full-year sales would total about $3.95 billion, a record and a more than 11% increase year-over-year. The company had previously forecast full-year sales growth of between 10% and 11%. Despite Monday\u2019s gains, Crocs shares have lost about 8% of their value in the last year and remain well off their record high of about $180.\n\nOne Chart to Watch Monday: Berkshire Hathaway Warren Buffet-run Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) may appear on watchlists Monday after the multinational conglomerate settled a billion-dollar lawsuit with the Haslam family over a truck stop company. A trial scheduled to commence today in Delaware was to determine if Berkshire Hathaway had used pushdown accounting methods to significantly reduce the value it would have to pay for the family\u2019s remaining 20% stake in Pilot Travel Centers (PTC), the largest truck-stop operator in the U.S. Berkshire had alleged that Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam enticed senior PTC executives with side payments to inflate the value of the company to receive a more attractive buyout from the financial conglomerate. Berkshire has been increasing its stake in PTC from the Haslam family since 2017, taking majority ownership of the company in January last year. Source: TradingView.com. Berkshire Hathaway shares trended mostly higher throughout 2023 apart from several retracements to the 200-day moving average. Currently, the stock trades between a 15-month uptrend line and its all-time high (ATH). If the price moves higher from current levels, monitor how it responds to the ATH around $373. Conversely, during retracements, keep an eye out if buyers can defend the uptrend line and 200-day moving average, currently sitting near $351.

        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reissued a warning about FOMO crypto investing just days ahead of the anticipated approval of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nIn a Jan. 6 post on X (formerly Twitter), the SEC\u2019s Office of Investor Education again warned retail investors of the risks associated with digital assets, including meme stocks, cryptocurrencies and nonfungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nOne of the first appearances of the \u201cSay no go to FOMO\u201d blog post came on Jan. 23, 2021, amid a roaring crypto and equities bull market that saw Bitcoin, Ether (ETH) and many other altcoins reach new all-time highs by November 2021. The warning was issued again around March 2022 when markets were cooling.\n\n#SECInvestingResolution 5: Say \u201cNO GO to FOMO\u201d (fear of missing out). Just because others might buy a particular investment, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the right opportunity for you. Learn more about finding out what\u2019s right for you and your investing goals: https://t.co/fixDWoNFrF pic.twitter.com/SGf1z6xmhL \u2014 SEC Investor Ed (@SEC_Investor_Ed) January 6, 2024\n\nSeveral users across social media theorized the report could suggest the SEC will soon approve one or more spot Bitcoin ETFs that are currently awaiting a decision sometime before a Jan. 10 deadline.\n\nThe warning mentioned celebrities and athletes promoting crypto assets, urging investors not to make financial decisions simply because popular figures were touting an investment opportunity.\n\n\u201cYou may see your favorite athlete, entertainer or social media influencer promoting these kinds of investment opportunities. Although it\u2019s tempting, never decide to invest based solely on their recommendation.\u201d\n\nOver the years, the regulator has slapped celebrities with fines and penalties for their role in promoting certain cryptocurrencies.\n\nOn Oct. 3, 2023, Kim Kardashian agreed to pay a $1.26 million settlement to the SEC after being charged with failing to disclose that she was paid $250,000 to promote a sham token called Ethereum Max (EMAX) to her 360 million Instagram followers.\n\nRelated: BlackRock to slash 3% of workforce ahead of Bitcoin ETF deadline: Report\n\nAdditionally, the report warned investors of the potential volatility associated with assets that swing heavily due to \u201ctrends and influencers,\u201d saying that while they can be appealing at first, losses often stack up quickly as the market moves on without them.\n\n\u201cHow would you feel if your investment lost 20, 30, or even 50 percent in a single day?\u201d the report asked its readers.\n\nThe crypto industry is currently watching the Bitcoin ETF space with bated breath. Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas predicts that most applicants will be approved within the week, or at least those who met the regulator\u2019s requirements before Dec. 29, will be approved within the week.\n\nMagazine: Which gaming guild positioned itself best for the bull market?"

Arc and Beck both announced fees of 0.25% following the news, Bitcoin ticked above $44,700 as of 9:30 a.m. eastern time today, Bitcoin is above $45,000. Ark Invest sold $20.6 million worth of Coinbase shares on Friday across three of its exchange traded funds. Cathy Woods investment firm offloaded 100 and 33,823 coin shares which closed last week at 100 and $53.98. Arc invests target is to have no individual stock surpass 10% weighting of an ETF S value coin more than doubled in price at the tail end of 2023 causing the investment firm to offload holdings. And the salon of meme coin frenzy is fizzling dog themed Bonk Token whose price rallied more than 1000% in a three month period is down 70% from its December peak that saw the Token listed on prominent exchanges with hat, which gained popularity because of a cute picture of a dog wearing a hat is also dead nearly 80% after early holders got a more than 10,000% return on their capital. Despite this, Solana has become the strongest straw among unchain traders. According to metrics from last week, that show trading volumes and network fees crossing those of Ethereum, you can get all of the most up to date headlines on coindesk.com right now. Let's now turn to our first interview. Our first guest of the New Year has six market catalysts for 2024. And one of those is the spot Bitcoin ETF that is taking over news headlines. Joining us now is Bit Gett managing director Gracie Chen Gracie, welcome to the 1st 1st mover of 2024. So excited. It's a very exciting year to to be in right now in 2024. It definitely is ramping up to be a very exciting year, especially uh for this industry. You have six catalysts that you expect to see in 2020 for one of them is the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. So I got to ask you what you make of these filings. We saw this morning, I just mentioned them when I was going through our news headlines, uh we have some asset managers listing their fees, any surprises there. Uh Not really. So when I, when I wrote that catalyst in uh about 2024 it was about uh two weeks ago. Um and at that time, actually a few, even a few months earlier, iiii I said that I think spot ETF because by ETF approval is pretty much not, not about whether or not it's just about when. So right now January 10th is approaching. Uh and I and I still think the approval in the 10th on the 10th is is of a very high possibility. What do you think is going to happen to the price of Bitcoin? I'm gonna say if you say when, if we get a spot Bitcoin approval, well, that that's a bit a bit harder to, to tell uh unless I think in the, in the long run, definitely positive in terms of price because the, the, the Bitcoins by ETF S approval actually means there will be in investor influx from the traditional financial industries such as pension fund, institutional investors, uh high net worth individuals, family offices, et cetera. Uh So that's the first reason and then there will be more familiarity with the the investor vehicle and also uh getting more companies to look into crypto or Blockchain industry in general to see if there is something they can do. So it's definitely a positive for Bitcoin price in the long run. But in the short run, that's a bit tricky. Uh because the Bitcoin price, uh sorry that the Bitcoin for ETF Global is actually a little bit priced in, in the past few months uh since November, like uh the increase of the Bitcoin price. So in the short run, it depends on uh you know, how many uh how many approvals are received. And if there's any, any adjustment uh into those, the, the the issue, the issue of the ETF and also uh how many money or how much money are really coming into the industry, whether it's higher or lower than the market expectation. So in the, in the short run, it could possibly be a decrease of Bitcoin price. So be very cautious about, you know, um the, the, the the the change in the price in the short run, Gracie, I also hosts the Markets Daily podcast on the Coin Desk Podcast Network. We talk about the markets every morning and a few of our guests have said once we see a spot, Bitcoin ETF approval, the attention will change, the focus will change over to the Ethereum ecosystem. One of your market catalysts is the Ethereum Cancun upgrade. Talk to us about what you're expecting for the Ethereum ecosystem as we move into 2024. Yeah, uh I guess the the time shift right now I'm seeing or given the conversation I had with a few industrial leaders and some analysts in the facing the US. Uh The shift of of the focus is probably around February to March. Uh shifting from Bitcoin to the Ethereum um ecosystem because the Cancun or Duncan Duncan Cancun upgrade is scheduled for the first quarter but now in January. Uh and also during this time, the Ethereum and layer two ecosystem will continue to, to grow because of the core upgrade. And it's anticipated that the ZK layer two projects will see a surge in token issuance. Lots of projects are issuing their token in 1st and 2nd quarters of this year. Layer twos, I'm glad you brought up layer twos. They were a big part of the narrative. In 2023 we saw some big layer twos launched. Uh When, when I hear layer two, I immediately think of arbitra optimism Coinbase is layer two base. Uh What are you watching when it comes to layer twos this year? Oh, well, it's a bit biased because only two or three days ago when I was in Hong Kong, I was hiking with the co-founder of scroll. Uh She's based in Hong Kong and uh uh and a few other projects that, that the founders that I know, but you mentioned a few very important layer to changes Abit uh base that definitely uh the major ones issued in the year of 2023 I think in 22 the the the few projects I don't want to go into details in terms of talking about their names, but um grow is one of them uh that is, you know, increasing dramatically in terms of their user and uh projects building on their platform. Um Tao is another one. Both of these are founded by many Asian founders. Uh Well, I guess in general not talking about specific projects. Uh the layer two chains, the the most important kind of value is that they can store and retrieve off chain data on the Theorem magnet in a more cost efficient manner. And uh the transactions are later to a significantly cheaper after the Duncan or, or Duncan Conquin up upgrade. So this will provide benefits for the Ethereum users. But there's another saying or, or kind of market um insights or, or, or analysis in terms of how the layer tools could compete with a the rum ecosystem, which I'm still trying to figure out. That's one of the conversation that 11 of the topics I touched upon while while hiking with the scroll co-founder. But basically they are at different views in terms of whether layer two is really like truly building on Ethereum or it's, it's going to be a new ecosystem by themselves growing um around E theorem. That's really interesting. And I wanna unpack that a little bit more. You know, I talk about layer twos being the narrative of 2023 but that narrative was really and it's going to help solve the Ethereum ecosystems problems. It's going to help expand the Ethereum ecosystem. And now I hear that there are conversations happening that layer twos might create their own ecosystems. What might that look like? Unpack that a little bit more? For me again, I'm not an expert on layer two or in theorem like some of my friends who are building in the, in the space. but basically, um some of the layer two, if you see such as um polygon, like these are some of the uh I mean that that is building our room, but they are not using uh eths gas fee. Exactly. So they issue their own token and they have sort of a stand alone ecosystem by themselves. And that's what we mean by overnight when I hear my friends discussing uh whether they are two can be a new ecosystem. Um Yeah, and also the the ethers main net, it's actually um like for there. So there are only that many projects and project founders and builders and developers, right? So they either build on, on the E theorem directly or they build on layer two. That's also what I mean by um potentially the, the layer two projects can be a new ecosystem. And that kind of challenge the, the so called the, the, the, the, the king of uh uh Blockchain. Uh at least in terms of uh used as a, a gas or a uh uh uh uh an energy level like in terms of the theorem as the a Blockchain for a by default Blockchain for people to use. OK. Gracie, I wanna turn now to some recent news out of Bit Cat. Bit gets venture fund forsake ventures acquired crypto media site. The block, talk to us about the role journalism plays in the development of the industry. Oh OK. So just let me clarify. So Force Adventure is a stand alone uh capital, although Beget is one of their LP S limited partners. Uh The decisions between Beget and Force Adventure is still very independent by themselves. Um Yes, I had the honor to meet some of the um founders or the leaders, the blog um coin desk, coin telegraph. I met your CEO as well. He's uh um based, he's a Harvard Business School graduate. So um by having this conversation with many top crypto leaders, uh I think a few, a few things that that is happening. Very importantly. Number one journalism or media has always been a very important ecosystem player in the crypto and Blockchain industry by being the information provider by uh also, you know, challenging the some of the bad players or Black Force. Um But basically this stand alone um role of promoting as well as monitoring. The space is very important. You were biased when it came to layer twos, I'm biased when it comes to the media. I agree with you. I think that, you know, crypto media has shown how important uh it is to holding the powerful people in this industry accountable. We saw that happen with Sam B and freed. Of course, last year we gotta wrap it up, Gracie. I could talk to you all day. But I have to ask you before we go. When does killer Whales air? What is happening? I've seen so many trailers with you on there. When do we get to watch that? Well, I wish I, I have an exact date. I I heard that it's going to be launched and aired in the first quarter of on a few important channels. They mentioned that they had conversations with some major channels um such as Netflix, uh Amazon Prime or even Apple TV. Uh But they haven't decided on the channel. I think so. Don't, don't quote me on this because I'm, I'm just one of the judges, Gracie. We are gonna have to wrap it there. Thanks so much for joining the very 1st 1st mover episode of 2024. It was a pleasure having you. Thank you for having me. That was bit get managing director, Gracie Chen. The chart of the day is presented by crypto.com, the leading crypto platform trusted by over 80 million users worldwide. It's now time to take a look at the chart of the day. According to TRM labs, North Korean hackers stole $600 million worth of crypto in 2023. This number could have been even higher at $700 million if additional hacks that took place in the final days of 2023 are confirmed to have been committed by North Korea. This chart right here shows the total amount of funds stolen decreasing by 30% from 2022 to 2023. After dramatically increasing from 21 to 2022 the research firm says the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was responsible for almost a third of all funds stolen in crypto attacks. Last year. North Korean Attackers usually compromise private keys and seed phrases to transfer stolen funds to wallet addresses controlled by North Korean operatives. TRM lab says the funds are then swapped mostly for us DT or Tron and converted to fiat currency using high volume OTC brokers. We're gonna keep the convo on crypto crime going near the end of 2023. The industry watched closely as Sam Bateman freed faced multiple charges related to fraud in a New York court. Sam was found guilty on all charges and is awaiting sentencing. Recently, we learned that he won't face a second trial that was scheduled for this year on charges related to conspiracy to bribe foreign officials. Joining us. Now to discuss what this all means is Brian Cave, Leighton Paisner L LP partner Renato Marotti Renato. Happy New Year. It's such a pleasure to see you on the screen again. Great to see you. All right, let's talk about this SPF news. Everyone was talking about it at the end of last year. Now we hear that that second trial, he was scheduled to be a part of prosecutors won't be moving forward. What's happening here? All this happening is that prosecutors won so handily that they don't need a second trial. So in the United States and Federal court, if prosecutors get a conviction on any felony count, they can present all evidence to the judge of all crimes, whether charged, convicted, acquitted, dismissed. And then the judge can consider all of that when crafting the sentence, it may sound unfair. But even though SPF was not convicted of those additional crimes, the judge can consider all of that evidence anyway. And so realistically, the sentence is exactly the same as it would be if they went to a second trial. So, uh essentially the government won. So handily that they're, uh, that they don't even need the second trial to get the sentence that they want. Renato before we dig deeper into this. I know you've given us, um, a prediction on how many years you think Sam Bakeman Fried will spend behind bars. But it's the beginning of the year we got to re up that conversation. Uh, Sam's facing sentencing in March, I believe. How many years do you think? Do you think he's gonna get, I wouldn't be surprised if the, if the digits start in two like a 20 plus years, 20 to 25 years. I think that's a, that would be a very hefty sentence for anyone. Uh And, but I think it's a, it's a reasonable sentence given the extent of the fraud. So definitely, um they will not be taking it easy on Sam Baker. Freed. The judge was not happy with his shenanigans while he was out on, you know, we talk about crypto crime so often on the show, a bunch of very high profile uh trials that are coming up this year. But I want to broaden uh the conversation out a little bit and talk about why, why this matters. Of course, it matters to you. It is your profession over here. We cover the news. But what should folks be taking away from these trials as we talk about them? Sure, like we talk about uh a lot of trials, there'll be, you know, a Celsius trial coming up uh in the upcoming year, but at the end of the day, um and I think everyone watching this knows that criminals and crypto crime, that's a very small fraction of this industry. And there's a lot of legitimate players out there. You know, the ripple case was a case that for example, there's a lot of focus this year because the sec actually lost uh in a high profile case. Um And I think what a lot of people are wondering is what does this mean, does this mean that the SEC is going to roll out some regulation? Does this mean we're finally gonna get a regulatory framework in the United States for crypto? Uh And the answer I think is no, I mean, the SEC, um, did dismiss uh, some of the cases but they're appealing. Um, and they are trying to move forward. They've continued their aggressive approach. I think we're gonna see more, uh, what people call regulation by enforcement for the sec where they're fighting in court, not criminal cases, but civil cases against companies like a legitimate companies that are actually interested in being compliant and trying to figure out what regulatory uh framework would be. And so unfortunately, I think we still have gonna, we're gonna have uncertainty in 2024 and that may not clear up for some time. Well, I mean, now I just feel like I'm left with more uncertainty. Renato, what, how should people be looking at, uh, what's going on with the SEC moving forward? I mean, just from a legal perspective, what would you tell your friends around the dinner table when they're asking about all of the ins and outs of this industry? Sure. And I, and I'll tell you, I tell my clients the same thing which is, there are a lot of foreign jurisdictions, uh, the UK and others that are adopting, um, crypto frameworks that are really rational that are uh from their legislative bodies, whether it's parliament or some other body, the United States, we don't have that yet. It may be that Congress comes together. I do hear from some folks in the industry that they're optimistic. Uh I'm never optimistic about the two parties that Congress agree on anything. Uh They have trouble even keeping the government open. Um If that happens, great. Uh But until that happens, I really think uh we're gonna have to see what happens in the election of 2024 before we can, um you know, see a change in direction from the SEC. I really don't think Chairman Gensler, um he has a different approach, there is some daylight between the SEC and CFTC. And as I've pointed out uh publicly, the CFT CS chair has actually come out and he's trying to portray his agency as the leader uh in, in this space and trying to position itself differently. But without a word from Congress, I really don't see the SEC uh being convinced of that. And until the SEC takes a different view, uh we're all well, you know, in the same boat in the, in this industry, it's interesting you bring up the CFTC versus SEC battle for oversight of this industry. Where do you think that might land? Do you think the two agencies can work together? I know that was suggested in a few of the draft bills that were drawn up last year, you know, they do work together occasionally but you also see differences, right? You know, look at their different approach to its Binance. The SCFTC cut a deal, the DOJ cut a deal. SEC did not. Um, and I, I really think that going forward, you know, the SEC is kind of acting um out of step with, uh the CFTC, um they're acting in a manner that I think is creating a lot of uncertainty in the industry and that's really um an issue that cannot be resolved. The CFTC doesn't have the authority to tell the SEC like to sit down or, or, you know, let's work together. They don't have the authority to force them to do anything. So I really think until Chairman Genzler and the SEC have a different approach, um we're kind of stuck although the CFTC is notably sending public signals that they disagree and they're taking a different approach which might position the CFTC in legislation um to be the, uh uh you know, regulatory body that ultimately oversees this space. I want to look forward to 2024. Like I said, everyone was talking about Sam Bakeman Fried last year. Some say that the conversation is gonna switch over to Alex Mossy who is set for his criminal trial in September of this year. What do you think is gonna happen there? Yeah, I think it's gonna be another difficult case for the defendant. You know, I, I heard Jen a lot of people telling me, oh, the prosecutors are taking it easy. He had s Bakeman freed. I think we 2023 proved that that did not. Uh, that was not the case. I mean, the guy who had his bond revoked and we, you know, was charged with lots of felonies and convicted and he's gonna spend a lot of time in prison. I, I really see the exact same fate. Uh, here, you know, Celsius, the, the entity was not ultimately prosecuted. They ended up cooperating with prosecutors and threw it, threw him under the bus. Appears rightfully so based on the allegations, obviously, he's still presumed innocent. Uh but uh it really looks like a very, very difficult case for him to win. Renato Sam didn't really make it easy for prosecutors, did he not at all? Uh Not at all. You know, most people when they're, when they're uh charged with felonies, they keep their mouth shut, they obey the conditions of release. They realize that I might lose this trial. This judge is gonna sentence me. Uh Samba MRE didn't obey the judge's orders, didn't com you know, comply with the bond conditions. Uh was out there blasting the prosecutor spreading a lot of disinformation, uh creating shenanigans even during the, the middle of the trial just did everything possible to make life difficult for the prosecutors, but also to ultimately increase his sentence at the end of the day. Renato. Thank you so much for joining the very 1st 1st mover episode of 2024. It's always a pleasure having you on and hear your perspective. Wow. I'm honored. Thank you.

        "title": "Mercari News: Bitcoin Payments to Be Valid At Japanese E-commerce Giant Mercari Very Soon - CoinGape",
        "content": "Businesses in the crypto-friendly country of Japan are now looking at ways to boost Bitcoin adoption. One of Japan\u2019s largest e-commerce platforms Mercari stated that it will start accepting Bitcoin payments on its platform starting June 2024.\n\nMercari Subsidiary to Accept Bitcoin Payments\n\nAs reported by Nikkei, the company will facilitate Bitcoin transactions through its Tokyo-based cryptocurrency subsidiary, Melcoin.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMelcoin will be responsible for converting all Bitcoin payments into Japanese yen. This means that while buyers have the option to pay with BTC, vendors will receive the equivalent amount in fiat currency. Notably, Mercari will refrain from displaying prices in Bitcoin, maintaining the listing of items for sale in Japanese yen.\n\nDespite not denoting prices in Bitcoin, customers will have the flexibility to select BTC as a payment method when conducting transactions on the Mercari platform. This move signals a notable embrace of cryptocurrency within the Japanese e-commerce landscape.\n\nEstablished in 2013, Mercari has evolved into Japan\u2019s largest community marketplace platform. As of July 2023, the company reported an impressive user base of 22 million monthly users. Mercari has also been actively expanding its footprint in international markets, with a particular focus on Europe.\n\nIn recent months, Mercari has ventured into the cryptocurrency space by introducing various crypto-related products. Notably, the company launched the Mercari Bitcoin crypto trading service. This service enables users to engage in the buying and selling of Bitcoin using the proceeds generated from their sales on the Mercari platform.\n\nFurthermore, Mercari\u2019s platform incorporates a loyalty points system, intricately linked to its crypto trading arm. This innovative integration allows Mercari users to exchange their accumulated loyalty points for Bitcoin, further bridging the gap between traditional e-commerce and the world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nJapanese Businesses Offering Gateway for Crypto\n\nIndustry observers have dubbed the services offered by Mercari, along with a competing platform operated by Rakuten, as a new \u201cgateway\u201d for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investors and traders. Rakuten, a prominent Japanese e-commerce platform, has been actively involved in the cryptocurrency space for an extended period, predating Mercari\u2019s entry. Rakuten operates the Rakuten Wallet crypto trading service and has seamlessly integrated its loyalty points program with its cryptocurrency arm, allowing users to convert their points into various crypto assets. In a recent survey, individuals in Japan who commenced coin trading toward the end of 2022 overwhelmingly favored Mercari\u2019s Bitcoin Trading app (24.7%) or Rakuten\u2019s Rakuten Wallet platform (24.2%). This development posed a challenge for the nation\u2019s major crypto exchanges, with the established market leader bitFlyer securing the third position with a share of 11.3%. On the other hand, Japan is also working on major tax reforms for the crypto industry this year in 2024."

        "content": "Mon 08 Jan 2024 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Eddy S.\n\nDespite the recent downturn in prices, the crypto whales, who already possess colossal amounts of bitcoin, are far from discouraged. They continue to buy aggressively. Let\u2019s take a look at this revealing phenomenon.\n\nWhales ready to invest billions more\n\nSome crypto investors and speculative funds hold hundreds of thousands of bitcoins, representing billions of dollars at the current valuation.\n\nHowever, despite the already substantial size of their crypto investments, these whales are far from satiated. They are actively seeking to increase their exposure.\n\nOne of these whales has acquired no less than 348 additional bitcoins in the last 24 hours! This transaction is valued at over 15 million dollars for the day. The buyer already holds the equivalent of about a billion dollars in bitcoin. But even with such a massive sum, they continue to bet tens of millions on every dip.\n\nThis behavior shows that the accumulation appetite of the most seasoned investors is far from satisfied, despite already having enormous stakes in crypto. They buy dips with conviction, even after spectacular gains.\n\nA testament to their confidence in the potential of bitcoin\n\nThe attitude of these crypto whales is indicative of their confidence in the long-term appreciation potential of bitcoin, despite its sometimes bewildering short-term volatility. These big investors are not impressed by market fluctuations.\n\nIf they continue to buy aggressively, it\u2019s because they are intimately convinced that bitcoin and crypto, in general, represent the future of digital finance and are poised to play an increasing role in the years to come. They anticipate new records.\n\nThese seasoned investors often have the means to thoroughly analyze the technical, economic, and strategic aspects of bitcoin. The fact that they still allocate their capital massively to this crypto, despite already substantial gains, demonstrates their faith in the ultimate success of bitcoin.\n\nFar from succumbing to panic or reducing their bets, crypto whales clearly display their optimism. They continue to accumulate impressive amounts on every dip. Their strategy of aggressively buying weaknesses in the market testifies to their confidence in the continued ascent of bitcoin. Following the behavior of these whales can provide valuable insights into the future evolution of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETF hopefuls, including BlackRock, VanEck, and ARK Invest, filed early Monday morning amendments to their respective fund registrations with the Securities and Exchange Commission to disclose their fee structures.\n\nThe immediate take away from analysts was that BlackRock\u2019s 0.30% proposed fee is much lower than the industry was expecting, which will make competing against the largest asset manager in the world all the more difficult for every other firm in the running.\n\nCase in point: The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, and Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF will all launch with 0% fees. Even BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust will have a 0.20% introductory rate on the first $5 billion before it switches to its 0.30% fee.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nInvestors have been wanting a spot Bitcoin ETF for the better part of a decade. An exchange-traded product that tracks the real-time price of Bitcoin would allow investors to get exposure to the asset in their portfolios without having to actually buy and hold BTC themselves.\n\nBut the issuers aren\u2019t doing all this just as a favor to their clients. The overhead that they\u2019re taking on to make Bitcoin exposure easier for investors comes at a price. That\u2019s where the fees come in.\n\nExchange-traded funds charge fees for all the work they do on behalf of investors, like buying assets, storing them, and rebalancing when necessary to keep true to their prospectus. That means investors would forego one-time transaction fees at an exchange for ongoing maintenance fees paid to the ETF issuers. And those fees could eat into returns, which is why they\u2019re a keenly watched detail as the industry waits for an ETF to be approved.\n\nFor context, sponsor fees accrue daily and are usually deducted from the fund\u2019s assets monthly or quarterly. It\u2019s not as though issuers send a bill out to investors to collect their fee. It\u2019s that returns for an ETF investor equal performance of shares minus whatever fees are owed to the firm that\u2019s maintaining the fund.\n\nhere's a table of the proposed spot Bitcoin ETF fees excluding waivers --\n\nlow: Bitwise @ 0.24%\n\nhigh: Grayscale @ 1.50%https://t.co/T5dNccZ3oJ via @crypto w/ @emilyjnicolle pic.twitter.com/yJ30yXmKRI \u2014 Katie Greifeld (@kgreifeld) January 8, 2024\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe comparatively low fee from BlackRock and the lower fees that other firms would need to charge to remain competitive has sparked a debate in the crypto industry about whether zero fee offers are something to worry about.\n\nIt\u2019s not all that different from the klaxons that go off when a crypto lending product promises sky-high returns on deposits.\n\nCustodia Bank (former Avanti Financial Group) CEO Caitlin Long posited on X (formerly Twitter) that when an issuer is charging less in fees than it takes to cover its costs to manage a fund, it might mean there are hidden risks.\n\n\u201cWith no-fee funds, the answer is usually securities lending,\u201d she said, \u201ca practice that can pose A LOT of hidden risk to investors.\u201d\n\nLong has been saying for years that the \u201cfinancialization\u201d of Bitcoin could be a double-edged sword for laser-eyed maxis. But Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas weighed in, offering some insight into how ETF issuers can make 0% introductory fees work.\n\n\u201cLow fees attract advisors who control the majority of [assets] in America. That activity attracts traders, then once an ETF is big and liquid, the issuer will play hard ball [with its] custodian (\"lower your fee or we going elsewhere\"),\u201d he said. \u201cThis is normal life in the ETF Terrordome.\u201d\n\nThat means it could be the likes of Coinbase and other firms who have been selected as custodians for the Bitcoin that\u2019ll back shares of an ETF who could bear the brunt as issuers seek to keep the fees on their funds low enough to bring fresh cash through the door.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

Discover SCENE\n\nVanEck and Bitwise said the two investment firms are seeding their Bitcoin ETFs with $72.5 million and $500,000, respectively, according to S-1 documents filed with the SEC on Monday.\n\nS-1 forms disclose important information to the financial regulator, such as the company's business model, financial statements, details about its management team, and any legal or competitive risks.\n\nSeeding, or seed capital, refers to funds provided to launch an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). While banks and broker-dealers often provide seed capital, ETFs can self-seed with new capital or existing assets, as in this case.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn addition to its $500,000 seed basket, Bitwise\u2014which claims to be the largest crypto index fund manager in America\u2014is offering up a $200 million investment opportunity, with investment firm Pantera Capital among potential purchases.\n\n\u201cPantera Capital Management LP, through one or more of its affiliated investment funds, has indicated an interest in purchasing an aggregate of up to $200 million of Shares in this offering from Authorized Participants or in the marketplace through broker-dealers,\u201d Bitwise said. \u201cHowever, because indications of interest are not binding agreements or commitments to purchase, these potential purchasers could determine to purchase more, fewer or no Shares.\u201d\n\nFounded in 1955, New York-based VanEck is a global investment and asset management firm focusing on ETFs, mutual funds, and managing accounts for institutional investors. According to VanEck, the company began developing ETF products in 2006.\n\nIn 2017, VanEck launched a Bitcoin Futures ETF but, like others, has yet to see a spot in the Bitcoin ETF approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Something the firm and the cryptocurrency market hope changes this week.\n\nBitwise and VanEck\u2019s applications are just two of several being reviewed by the SEC this week. In December, Bitwise released a Bitcoin ETF ad featuring \u201cThe Most Interesting Man in the World\u201d Jonathan Goldsmith.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile the cryptocurrency space sees ETFs as Bitcoin and potential Ethereum\u2019s chance at a moon shot, in their respective filings, Bitwise and VanEck cautioned investors about the potential risk of investing in Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nVanEck, in its filing, cautioned that the investment could go to zero.\n\n\u201cThe value of Bbitcoin and, therefore, the value of the Trust\u2019s Shares could decline rapidly, including to zero. You could lose your entire investment,\u201d VanEck said. \u201cThe Shares are neither insured nor guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or any other governmental agency or other person or entity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe further development and acceptance of the Bitcoin network and other digital asset networks, which represent a new and rapidly changing industry, are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate,\u201d Bitwise wrote. \u201cThe slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of the Bitcoin network may adversely affect an investment in the Shares.\u201d\n\nIn a Monday post on Twitter, SEC chair Gary Gensler warned investors about the potential risk of investing in cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cInvestments in crypto assets also can be exceptionally risky & are often volatile,\u201d Gensler said. \u201cA number of major platforms and crypto assets have become insolvent and/or lost value.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has a backlog of a more than a dozen Bitcoin ETF applications that it must make a final decision on soon, starting with ARK\u2019s application deadline on January 10th.\n\nAfter a string of embarrassing legal losses for its \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d discrimination against cryptoassets, analysts almost unanimously expect the SEC to approve multiple (if not all) of these applications imminently, making Bitcoin far more accessible for many investors. Indeed, Gary Gensler, the head of the SEC, made a Twitter thread earlier today with \u201cSome things to keep in mind if you\u2019re considering investing in crypto assts,\u201d suggesting that he\u2019s trying to get out ahead of the approval.\n\nMeanwhile, multiple investment firms with outstanding ETF applications announced expense ratios for their proposed ETFs, generally ranging in the 0.2-0.5% range, which is relatively cheap for exposure to an alternative asset class.\n\nCrucially, unlike past high-profile, derivative-based Bitcoin product launches, like futures contracts or futures-based ETFs, spot ETFs will be required to buy and hold underlying Bitcoin equal to their underlying assets, fundamentally altering Bitcoin\u2019s supply-demand balance.\n\nWhile the situation is not necessarily identical, the launch of the first gold ETF (GLD) back in November 2004 may provide interesting context. For the first time, there was an easy, liquid way for Americans to invest in the precious metal en masse and investors poured funds into the ETF for its purported diversification from their more traditional assets, contributing to gold\u2019s big rally from below $500 to nearly $2,000 over the next eight years:\n\nSource: TradingView, StoneX\n\nBitcoin Technical Analysis \u2013 BTC/USD Daily Chart\n\nSource: TradingView, StoneX\n\nAs the chart above shows, traders are clearly \u201cbuying the rumor\u201d when it comes to a Bitcoin ETF approval this week; the key question is whether they\u2019ll \u201csell the news\u201d once the ETFs are formally approved. The cryptocurrency is poised to close near $47K, at its highest level since April 2022, after consolidating in a high base formation over the last five weeks.\n\nFrom a purely technical perspective, the trend remains clearly to the topside, with room up toward previous resistance and the 61.8% retracement of the 2021-2022 drop in the $48,400-500 range. That said, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a short-term \u201csell the news\u201d reaction emerge after the big anticipatory run up. In that scenario, a pullback toward the 50-day EMA in the $41K area could be in play, but as long as the ETF\u2019s are attracting assets, dips may be relatively limited in the short term.\n\n-- Written by Matt Weller, Global Head of Research\n\nFollow Matt on Twitter: @MWellerFX"

A December 2023 report by blockchain intelligence company TRM Labs said that over $1.7 billion in cryptocurrency had been stolen that year. The $1.7 billion, however, is still less than half the $4 billion stolen in 2022.\n\n\u201cFraudsters continue to exploit the rising popularity of crypto assets to lure retail investors into scams,\u201d the SEC chair said, highlighting scams targeting cryptocurrency investors, including pyramid and Ponzi schemes, and theft targeting wallets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile Gensler\u2019s comment had the hallmarks of an SEC investor alert, many on Crypto Twitter took the time of the thread as a backhanded capitulation.\n\n\u201cThis is what capitulation looks like, folks,\u201d Autism Capital, a pseudonymous crypto market commentator, said in reply to Gensler\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want your crypto advice Gary,\u201d content creator and podcaster Gabriel Haines tweeted.\n\nGary Gensler while writing this thread https://t.co/d30436hMTq pic.twitter.com/X9m9wmISta \u2014 Jacquelyn Melinek (@jacqmelinek) January 8, 2024\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s over, Gary Gensler lost!\u201d a cheerful OSF said on the Rug Radio Fomo Hour after the tweet came out. \u201cThis is the beginning of everything!\u201d\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

As per on-chain indicators, whale transactions have hit their highest levels in 18 months since June 2022.\n\nBitcoin Whale Scoops 1,750 BTC\n\nLookOnChain, an on-chain data provider, reports a strategic move by a discerning whale in the crypto market. Over the past two days, this savvy investor has acquired 1,750 BTC (equivalent to $76.9 million) from the popular exchange Binance, strategically making purchases at $43,953 per Bitcoin.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThis recent accumulation follows a larger-scale initiative by the same whale, spanning from August 24 to September 2, during which they amassed a substantial 6,000 BTC (amounting to $158.66 million) at a favorable price of $26,444 per Bitcoin.\n\nTaking advantage of market conditions, the whale deposited 3,000 BTC (equivalent to $105.7 million) back into Binance when the price reached $35,241, resulting in a significant profit of $26.4 million. As of the latest data, the smart whale currently holds a total of 4,750 BTC, valued at $207.4 million. This strategic maneuver suggests a calculated and opportunistic approach by the whale in navigating the cryptocurrency market.\n\nAll eyes on the ETF Approval\n\nThis week brings a critical juncture for the long-anticipated launch of Bitcoin-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, with several high-stakes deadlines approaching. As reported by Bloomberg News, prospective Bitcoin ETF issuers have until Monday morning in Washington to make any final adjustments to their pending applications.\n\nThe successful initiation of spot-backed Bitcoin ETF trading hinges on meeting two key technical requirements. Firstly, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) needs to approve the 19b-4 filings submitted by the exchanges set to list the ETFs. Secondly, the regulator must greenlight the relevant S-1 forms, the registration applications from the aspiring issuers, which include industry giants like BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\nBloomberg News reports that the SEC is slated to vote on the exchanges\u2019 19b-4 filings in the coming days. Following this, the regulator may decide on the issuers\u2019 S-1 applications, potentially aligning with the same timeframe. If the SEC grants approval for both sets of requirements, the ETFs could commence trading as early as the subsequent business day."

        "content": "Mon 08 Jan 2024 \u25aa 4 min of reading \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nThe SEC is set to make a much-anticipated decision this week on cash-settled Bitcoin ETF applications. Approval seems very close, yet remains elusive. If given the green light, ETFs could start trading as soon as the next business day.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF Trading to Begin Swiftly After Approval\n\nThe battle to launch the first Spot Bitcoin ETF has been ongoing for years. A dozen players are in the running to market these exchange-traded index funds backed by Bitcoin. In the face of this flurry of requests, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has so far rejected each one, citing risks to investors.\n\nHowever, the tide may turn this week. After losing a lawsuit initiated by Grayscale in August, the American securities watchdog appears ready to approve such products. Part of the crypto ecosystem is thus holding its breath in anticipation of an imminent decision.\n\nIf cash-settled Bitcoin ETFs were indeed to emerge, they could technically be launched on the next stock market day following their approval. This was confirmed by Bloomberg today, establishing the necessary steps for their rollout.\n\nThe SEC must first validate two types of documents: the 19b-4 forms filed by the exchanges to list the funds, as well as the S-1 prospectuses from issuers like Fidelity detailing the operational conditions.\n\nThe exchanges have done their part by submitting the 19b-4 forms last week. The ball is now in the SEC\u2019s court. Once these validations are obtained, nothing would stand in the way of the immediate availability of cash-settled Bitcoin ETFs on the markets.\n\nEstablishing a precise date, as hypothetical as it may be, has revived enthusiasm and impatience among investors. The Holy Grail seems within reach. All that\u2019s missing is the SEC\u2019s final blessing, which is keeping the suspense going.\n\nD-Day Known, SEC Still Silent!\n\nFor now, this decisive approval from the US securities authorities is still being awaited. The SEC is due to make a decision on a dozen cash ETF applications before January 10th. But its deafening silence is beginning to irritate industry players, who were speculating on an announcement as early as this week.\n\nSome observers believe that the institution is deliberately taking its time, seeking to buy time before having to make a decision. Yet the exchanges and the candidate financial firms have not lost hope. All have resubmitted their regulatory forms, in anticipation of an imminent green light.\n\nThe approval of cash-settled Bitcoin ETFs is seen as a major catalyst for crypto. It would attract billions of dollars in institutional investments, boosting adoption and credibility. Hence the market\u2019s feverish impatience as the deadline approaches.\n\nA potential launch date is thus set for the future cash-settled Bitcoin ETFs: the day after their regulatory approval. But it is still being awaited, with the SEC keeping the suspenseat its maximum until the last moment. The historic stakes surrounding these financial products have never been so high.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "title": "The spot Bitcoin ETF will be pivotal for adoption of crypto - Private Banker International",
        "content": "Credit: Andr\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois McKenzie on Unsplash\n\nWindows of opportunity to approve the 13 active spot Bitcoin ETF applications are coming and going, with all eyes focused on the SEC. It\u2019s fair to say that both crypto and TradFi investors are eagerly watching to see what action the regulatory agency takes. Philippe Bekhazi writes\n\nMany believe that approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF will be the inflection point for crypto and a significant milestone step towards mass adoption, with some going as far to say that these approvals could add up to $1trn to crypto\u2019s market cap.\n\nThe excitement around this new asset class is understandable. Many large players, such as Fidelity and BlackRock, have spent a lot of time developing the operational framework for a spot Bitcoin ETF, and it has the potential to change who is able to access crypto assets. But it\u2019s important to take a step back and take a thorough view of what the true impact of the spot Bitcoin ETF will be on the crypto industry and wider financial landscape.\n\nDemocratising access to Bitcoin\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs have the potential to open investing in digital assets up to a much wider audience. An ETF will enable asset managers to take even a small position on Bitcoin \u2013 this will be a game changer over the long term. More immediately, when you have an ETF supported and sponsored by major asset managers you\u2019re providing credibility to the asset class. For investors, it\u2019s also reassuring to have access to the ETF through established financial players.\n\nHaving Bitcoin in an ETF form, as opposed to its physical form, is something institutions may be more comfortable and familiar with, meaning it will be easier for them to adopt. The industry is now on the cusp of turning Bitcoin into an investment opportunity that institutions can get on board with, which could be a pivotal step in the journey towards greater institutional adoption, and maturation of the crypto industry.\n\nThe benefits aren\u2019t just limited to institutions. Spot Bitcoin ETFs will be offered through trusted management platforms, meaning individual investors won\u2019t need to manage their own assets and can instead rely on a trusted party to do so.\n\nHow well do you really know your competitors?

By nature, the asset class lacks the decentralised and non-custodial nature of physical Bitcoin. This means that a fundamental feature of the currency, giving individuals complete control and ownership over the asset, is lost. Taking away the decentralised and non-custodial qualities of Bitcoin leaves investors vulnerable to traditional finance agency risks.\n\nThe time it will take for the spot Bitcoin ETF to become available should also be noted. While yes, the approval will green light new opportunities for a number of sovereign, pension funds, IRAs, 401ks and other institutions, it could take months for ETFs to be listed. This means that the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF won\u2019t have the big bang impact on the industry that some are anticipating.\n\nMoreover, alternative platforms are already available immediately for investors to take positions in Bitcoin in a regulated and compliant way.\n\nThe convergence of traditional finance and digital assets will continue\n\nWhen weighing up the pros and cons of the spot Bitcoin ETF, it\u2019s very clear that it will fill a pivotal role in the financial space.\n\nIts introduction will give current and potential investors more options than are currently present \u2013 which is important for the overall strength of the digital asset market. The spot Bitcoin ETF also enables investors to allocate to digital assets through trusted financial institutions, offering greater confidence and reassurance in their investments.\n\nThey can also choose to go down the route of physical Bitcoin, which gives investors immediate access to greater control and ownership, without the cost of management fees. Presently many regulated platforms are available that offer immediate access to physical bitcoin in bankruptcy-remote and insured environments. This increase in choice will lead to increased investor exposure, which is ultimately good for the digital asset industry.\n\nThe introduction of a spot Bitcoin ETF is a significant sign of things to come. Bitcoin, and by extension blockchain technology, were created to transform the financial industry and the convergence of traditional finance and crypto shown through the creation of this new vehicle is a step towards realising that goal. As we continue to grasp the capabilities of blockchain, we\u2019ll see a continued convergence of finance and crypto, allowing the benefits of both to shine.\n\nPhilippe Bekhazi is the founder and CEO of XBTO"

        "title": "Cryptocurrencies Are Soaring: Will 2024 Be the Year That Shiba Inu Hits $1? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Shiba Inu (CRYPTO: SHIB) has been benefiting from bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency space. The popular meme token is now up more than 17,600,000% from the pricing low that it reached shortly after it hit the market in 2020.\n\nIf Shiba Inu were to rise roughly 1,000,000% more, it would surge from its current price of roughly $0.00001 per token to reach $1 per coin. In such a scenario, $100 invested in the crypto at today's prices would grow to be worth roughly $10 million.\n\nCould the token really hit $1 in 2024 or at some point further in the future?\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nCall off the dogs\n\nThe $1 per token target for Shiba Inu has had staying power. Some who cite it may be earnestly hopeful that it can reach those heights. Others may simply be participating in the meme. But it's virtually impossible.\n\nEven though the jump needed to reach that level is much smaller than the gains the token has already recorded, there is almost no way the cryptocurrency could reach that level.\n\nAs it stands, there are roughly 589.3 trillion Shiba Inu coins in circulation. At a price of $1 per coin, Shiba Inu would have a market capitalization of more than $589 trillion. For context, that would be more than 5.6 times higher than the $105 trillion in total gross domestic product generated that the International Monetary Fund estimates the world's economies produced in 2023.\n\nShiba Inu currently has a market capitalization of $5.87 billion and ranks as the 19th-largest cryptocurrency by valuation. With its current coin count, Shiba Inu's market cap would have to rise roughly 100,000 times above its current levels if the token were priced at $1. And even though the cryptocurrency's circulating coin count is being reduced through token burning, this is happening at a very slow rate.\n\nHitting a price of $1 per token is essentially impossible, but that doesn't mean Shiba Inu can't climb higher in 2024 and beyond.\n\nWhat could send Shiba Inu higher in 2024?\n\nThe combined market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market has rallied roughly 106% over the last year to reach $1.76 trillion. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu's token price is up roughly 20% across the stretch. Those gains come in significantly below Bitcoin's returns of 157% and Ethereum's of 86% returns, but it's clear that Shiba Inu is benefiting from momentum in the broader crypto space.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe token could see strong gains in 2024 thanks to positive momentum for the broader crypto market. Cryptocurrencies have been enjoying a strong bullish run lately, and expectations that the Federal Reserve will pivot to rate cuts in 2024 are likely a factor.\n\nLower interest rates make it cheaper to borrow money and generally make investors willing to take on more risk. This is a good thing when it comes to valuations for speculative assets and equities. If the Fed does cut rates significantly this year, the development could continue boosting the market at large and benefit SHIB in particular.\n\nThere are some features and projects connected to the Shiba Inu universe that could help send the token higher. The Shibarium Layer-2 solution for improving transaction speeds could help bolster adoption for the cryptocurrency. SHIB: The Metaverse, an online virtual world connected to the token, might also promote the coin and power some gains.\n\nNeither of these potential catalysts look likely to be major performance drivers at the moment, but it's possible they will catch investors off guard.\n\nShiba Inu's most explosive days of growth are almost certainly in the rearview mirror, but it's possible that the token could climb significantly above current levels. Investors should approach the crypto with realistic expectations and understand that there is significant downside risk as well.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Shiba Inu right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Shiba Inu, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Shiba Inu wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Weekly Recap: Bitcoin, Binance, Ethereum, Solana... The crypto news you shouldn't miss! - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Mon 08 Jan 2024 \u25aa 10 min of reading \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nWeek after week, the world of cryptocurrencies continues to surprise and reshape the paradigms of digital finance and technology with ever-renewed boldness and innovation. In our weekly recap, we\u2019re going to explore the most captivating and significant events of the past week. From the enigmatic transfer of Bitcoin to Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s wallet, to Solana\u2019s controversial strategy against layer 2 solutions, through the turbulence on the stablecoin market and the heated debates around the upcoming upgrade to Ethereum.\n\n$1.2 Million in Bitcoin Transferred to Satoshi\u2019s Wallet!\n\nAn unidentified individual recently sent $1.2 million in Bitcoin to the Genesis wallet of Satoshi Nakamoto, the very first wallet created on the Bitcoin network. Though Nakamoto has long since vanished and it\u2019s highly unlikely that they will recover these funds, this mysterious transfer has captivated the crypto community\u2019s attention. The Genesis wallet originally had only the 50 bitcoins mined upon its creation, but over time, other funds have been sent there, and its balance increased to 72 Bitcoins by the end of 2023. With this latest transaction, the current balance is 99.67 bitcoins, valued at approximately $4.3 million.\n\nThe Genesis wallet is the very first wallet created on the Bitcoin network by Satoshi Nakamoto, and although it could theoretically still hold the private keys to access these wallets, it\u2019s very unlikely to do so since no funds from wallets associated with Nakamoto, including those from the Genesis block, have moved since his disappearance in December 2010. While some crypto-enthusiasts see this transfer as a mindless waste of money, others consider it a fitting tribute to the anonymous genius behind the Bitcoin revolution.\n\nSolana: A Strategic Rejection of Layer-2s!\n\nAnatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana Labs, has recently made a bold claim that has shaken the crypto ecosystem: Solana does not require layer 2 solutions. This claim goes against the current trend where many blockchains are adopting layer 2 solutions to enhance scalability and performance. According to Yakovenko, Solana is focusing on expanding its global atomic state machine, an approach that would render layer 2s redundant.\n\nSolana isn\u2019t just another blockchain, it aspires to be the architect of a parallel universe. By focusing on global atomic synchronization, Solana seeks to surpass the limitations of current blockchain technologies. Yakovenko envisions a world where Solana\u2019s unique virtual machine is self-sufficient without the need for external solutions. With hardware upgrades on the horizon, the platform is preparing for a future where it might, possibly, reign supreme. But the real question remains: will this isolated strategy bear fruit in the constantly evolving crypto ecosystem?\n\nUSDC: A Not-So-Stable Stablecoin?\n\nThe USDC, the stablecoin issued by Circle, recently lost its peg to the US dollar, plunging the crypto community into panic. Instead of maintaining its usual value of 1 dollar, USDC saw its value drop alarmingly, hitting a low of as much as $0.74 on the Binance exchange platform. This sudden drop has sparked concerns and speculation among investors and market observers.\n\nThe USDC de-peg phenomenon is not isolated in the world of stablecoins. Previously, Tether\u2019s USDT had also experienced periods where it could not maintain its 1:1 parity with the US dollar, resulting in massive liquidations on major crypto exchange platforms. The details of the USDC incident reveal that during a period of widespread market selling, fueled by dubious reports about the approval of a Bitcoin Spot ETF, USDC even lost its parity with the dollar three times.\n\nCould the USD Soon Be Pegged to Bitcoin?\n\nThe financial world might be on the brink of a revolution with the idea that the US dollar (USD) could soon be pegged to Bitcoin. This bold proposal has sparked a spirited debate among economists and policymakers. Proponents of this project view Bitcoin as a credible alternative to gold, traditionally used to back the value of currencies. They argue that Bitcoin, with its blockchain technology and decentralized network, offers increased security, limits counterfeiting, and thus reduces the risk of inflation. Furthermore, a USD indexed to Bitcoin would benefit from a limited and pre-programmed supply of new bitcoins, unlike traditional currencies that rely on central bank decisions. This could reinforce the dollar\u2019s status as a safe haven for investors.\n\nHowever, this idea is not without pitfalls. The volatility of Bitcoin is a significant concern, as pegging the world\u2019s primary reserve currency to such a volatile asset could destabilize the American economy and the international monetary balance. Additionally, China\u2019s dominance in Bitcoin mining poses a risk to US sovereignty and a systemic risk in the event of conflict between the two powers.\n\nBinance Tightens Policy on Monero and Zcash!\n\nBinance has recently announced a tightening of its trading rules for ten cryptocurrencies, including Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC), which will now be placed under \u201cenhanced surveillance\u201d due to the increased risks they pose. This move follows Binance\u2019s recent regulatory hurdles, as it faced allegations of money laundering and violations of KYC rules set by the US SEC. Monero and Zcash, known for their anonymizing properties, have often attracted regulatory attention for their potential to facilitate large-scale money laundering. Binance will also more closely monitor other tokens, while loosening rules for some like GMX and SushiSwap.\n\nTo trade these high-risk cryptocurrencies, Binance users will now have to take a quiz every 90 days and accept strengthened terms of use aimed at raising awareness of the risks involved. Tokens branded with Binance\u2019s \u201cSeed Tag\u201d are considered promising but highly volatile projects, and warning banners will be visible on their trading pages. Binance will conduct periodic reviews of crypto projects, taking into account various factors to add or remove tokens from surveillance lists. By tightening its compliance policy, Binance hopes to regain trust with authorities shaken in 2023, reflecting the difficult balancing act undertaken by the crypto giant.\n\nUNHCR Adopts Blockchain with Cardano for Humanitarian Aid\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has adopted blockchain as a powerful tool for refugee aid. With Cardano by its side, UNHCR is opening a new era of digital solidarity. Blockchain brings transparency and efficiency in the distribution of aid, and thanks to Cardano, the organization simplifies the management of donations, ensuring quick and direct help to refugees while securing their personal data. UNHCR is also innovating with crypto digital wallets that facilitate donations and receiving aid, even remotely, while educating refugees in digital literacy.\n\nCardano and UNHCR have launched a unique staking pool, \u201cBlockchain for Refugees,\u201d where each ADA crypto contribution directly supports the operations of UNHCR. This revolutionary crowdfunding model allows donors to maintain control of their assets while contributing to a noble cause. Cardano, with its committed community and unique staking system, has won over UNHCR, and their collaboration has already borne fruit with several innovative projects underway. The use of zero-knowledge proofs by Cardano further strengthens the security of refugee data.\n\nThe Pectra Update Causes a Split Among Ethereum Developers\n\nThe Ethereum community is actively preparing for Pectra, the next network upgrade scheduled for 2024, but a significant disagreement remains among developers on how best to integrate Verkle, a promising validity proof technology. The deployment of the Pectra upgrade will begin in 2024 with a series of tests on Ethereum development networks, allowing for the validation of the code in various environments and the identification of any potential bugs or performance issues.\n\nRegarding Verkle, two approaches oppose each other among Ethereum developers. Pro-mandatory Verkle advocates for total and immediate adoption, considering its advantages in terms of performance and scalability too important to provide a choice. On the other hand, anti-mandatory Verkle developers are more cautious, fearing security or stability issues if Verkle is deployed too quickly. They suggest that Verkle should first be offered as an option, alongside the current validation mechanism. The upcoming Pectra upgrade of Ethereum promises to be decisive for the network\u2019s future, but the integration of Verkle divides developers on the best strategy to adopt.\n\nBitcoin in 2023: A Whirlwind of $6 Trillion\n\nIn 2023, the Bitcoin market witnessed frenetic activity, with over $6 trillion exchanged, although this represents a 38% decrease from the previous year. This colossal sum equals more than 2.3 times the value of the French GDP and underscores the massive scale of transactions carried out with the flagship crypto.\n\nThe year was also marked by a relative stability of the average price of Bitcoin, with a slight increase from 2022. The number of active addresses remained steady, while Bitcoin\u2019s dominance climbed to 50%. More than 75% of Bitcoin holders are now considered long-term investors, a historic high that indicates a growing maturity of the market. Meanwhile, the amount of Bitcoin in circulation has increased by 1.75%, continuing its long-term downward trend.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Mon 08 Jan 2024 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Mikaia A.\n\nWe are now 2 days away from the deadline set by the SEC for the approval of the first Bitcoin Spot ETFs. To date, this regulatory institution has not made a statement regarding these new financial instruments. In case you want to closely follow the progress of the situation, we provide below some tips for you.\n\nAn Infallible Monitoring Tool for Bitcoin ETFs\n\nSo what\u2019s the actual date for the approval of the spot ETFs? More likely January 11 than January 10, 2024, predicted Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg financial analyst. Given the number of filings and the recent additions (S-1 forms referring to the chosen brokers by the applicants and the 19b-4 filings), the SEC really has its work cut out for it.\n\nHere's how to know if a spot bitcoin ETF has been approved https://t.co/uT7HQsNOE7 \u2014 The Block (@TheBlock__) January 7, 2024 This platform enables real-time monitoring of the SEC\u2019s decision\n\nAccording to The Block, the crypto community expects the Securities and Exchange Commission to green-light ARK Investment\u2019s and Cathie Wood\u2019s 21Shares spot Bitcoin ETFs by Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nIn fact, Wednesday is the deadline, January 10, the date analysts have been reiterating for several weeks already.\n\nHowever, some of them acknowledge the great authority of Gary Gensler and his team. And this, unfortunately, allows for a further postponement of the deadline.\n\nIn other words, the SEC has always been adept at maintaining suspense regarding the Bitcoin Spot ETFs. And might continue to do so in the future.\n\nBut to better follow its positions regarding these trackers, it\u2019s best to constantly keep an eye on its EDGAR electronic database.\n\n\u201cWe do not comment on individual filings. In general, if the Commission declares that a registration statement is effective, it is reflected in EDGAR. Any Commission 19b-4 order will be displayed on our website and subsequently published in the Federal Register,\u201d says an SEC spokesperson.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "title": "Bitcoin: Assessing the odds of a BTC trend reversal - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "The Bitcoin range formation of the past month remained in play.\n\nThe on-chain metrics showed investors need not worry about a downtrend yet.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] saw a large amount of volatility on 3rd January as prices fell by 6.3% on the day. Despite the selling pressure, on-chain metrics such as the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) suggested that the market is in a healthy bullish state.\n\nAMBCrypto recently reported that the Coinbase Premium was on the rise. It has been positive since September, with a brief drop into the negative territory in mid-December.\n\nThis was a sign of steady buying pressure on Coinbase. It sparked speculation of consistent buying activity from institutional investors ahead of a Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nAMBCrypto took a look at other metrics to understand where BTC stands.\n\nAssessing the available ammunition for the bulls\n\nThe Coinbase Premium Gap has been positive for most of the time since October. It dipped into the negative territory in mid-December. Its inference has already been mentioned, but it can be combined with other metrics to provide keener insight.\n\nOne such metric is the Stablecoin Supply Ratio. It is defined as the market cap of BTC divided by the total market cap of all stablecoins. A low value for this metric indicates high buying power.\n\nThe chart above shows that the ratio has spiked since early October. This meant buying power has been declining. The strong demand for BTC, not just on Coinbase but across exchanges, saw the king coin rally from $26k in October to reach $44k in December.\n\nThe metric seemed to hit a ceiling over the past month. This was a sign that market participants could be watching and waiting. The ETF applications and debate over their approval and the impact on BTC prices could be causing this indecision.\n\nThe NUPL hit a high not seen since December 2021, but investors need not fear\n\nOn 5th December 2023, the Bitcoin NUPL climbed above 0.5. The last time this happened was back on 27th December 2021. This does not mean a reversal is around the corner. Instead, the market is neither in a state of euphoria nor despair.\n\nThe NUPL has formed a plateau over the past month. This is tied to the price action of the asset as well, for BTC was unable to continue its uptrend in recent months. An increase in BTC inflows to exchanges was part of the reason.\n\nThe past five days saw a rise in the 7-day Simple Moving Average of the Bitcoin Netflow. This meant that reserves on exchanges were increasing, even as BTC prices straddled the range highs. Hence, this metric\u2019s continued rise would be useful to monitor.\n\nThe same uptrend happened in mid-December as well. This saw Bitcoin fall from $43k to $40.5k. The range formation of Bitcoin is also something investors and traders must keep an eye on.\n\nThe range (purple) has been in play since 11th December. It extended from $40.5k to $44.3k. The breakout on 2 January appeared clean, and a retest of the highs would have been a good buying opportunity.\n\nInstead, Bitcoin dropped like a rock to $40.7k on 3rd January. Since then, it has rebounded to the $43.6k mark. The OBV has been in a gradual decline since 11th December.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nAttempts to revive an uptrend on the OBV have been cut short. This suggested a lack of buying volume. The RSI was at 51 to signal a possible shift in the momentum in favor of the sellers.\n\nHence, BTC holders must be prepared for a drop to the range lows and potentially far lower. Key levels to watch for the coming week are the mid-range mark at $42.5k and the recent highs at $45.9k."

        "content": "\u201cIf there is an ETF approved I would expect more volatility after the decision,\u201d Mr Przelozny said. \u201cThere\u2019s [also] another window for approval in March, so the volatility could continue up until then.\u201d\n\nHopeful bitcoin ETF issuers have until Monday morning in Washington to submit any last-minute revisions to their pending applications, according to Bloomberg.\n\n\u2018Halving\u2019 imminent\n\nBeyond the SEC decision, Mr Przelozny said the so-called bitcoin \u201chalving\u201d \u2013 when the payout for producing the digital currency is cut in half to curtail the incoming supply of tokens \u2013 had also buoying market sentiment, with the event slated for the second quarter of 2024.\n\n\u201cThe price of bitcoin works on a four-year cycle, and it works around these halving events,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re entering a period where potentially the demand is going to increase because of ETFs and at the same time the supply will reduce because of the halving.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Przelozny added that expectations of central banks kicking off a round of interest rate cuts later this year had also boosted the market for risk assets including cryptocurrencies.\n\nTraders ascribe a 64 per cent chance that the US Federal Reserve will start easing monetary policy as soon as March, and are fully priced for five rate cuts during the year, according to market pricing. Both the European Central Bank and the Bank of England are also expected to lower rates as many as six times in 2024\n\n\u201cThat will probably be really good, not just for cryptocurrency, but risk assets in other markets as well,\u201d Mr Przelozny added. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of optimism in the market right now.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price swings last week were the largest in more than two months, according to data from Bloomberg. Other digital assets were also whipsawed, with ether declining as much as 11 per cent on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe will likely see some increased volatility in the short term as markets start to measure risk in all asset classes, as we enter a year that has many question marks,\u201d said Fadi Aboualfa, head of research at crypto custodian Copper Technologies in an email seen by Bloomberg last week.\n\n\u201cRegardless, we saw markets tank just the same at the start of December, only to rally up further.\u201d\n\nWith Bloomberg"

        "content": "Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\n\nCrypto prices are down with traders anticipating further volatility this week. One project that\u2019s trending lower is Solana. It is down 11.4% in the past seven days, dropping to $86.95. However, analysts are bullish on Bitcoin Minetrix as its presale surges past $7.8 million.\n\nCrypto volatility to rise as ETF approval deadline looms\n\nConcerns of mass volatility have taken their toll on Solana\u2019s price, with it recently touching its lowest in three weeks.\n\nCurrently, Solana is trading at $90.8, down 4.9% today. It has also suffered a 29% decrease from its local top of $124.\n\nExperts are concerned of even more downside potential, likely induced by immense volatility as the market reacts to upcoming Bitcoin ETF news.\n\nTrader Kaz The Shadow recently posted a broader market overview, warning investors that \u201cvolatility will be very high\u201d this week.\n\nYou might also like: Solana meme tokens collapse after December pump\n\nHe concluded, \u201cIf you are not experienced in the market with these bounces, wicks and scam moves and don\u2019t know how to manage your risk then you shouldn\u2019t trade or just lower your size.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, other analysts are expecting Solana to retrace deeper before a potential next leg up.\n\nOne of those is Jelle, anticipating SOL \u201ccould dip as deep as $70 and it\u2019d be a perfect bull-market retest.\u201d\n\nThis analysis implies that there will be an uptrend continuation once Solana retests $70.\n\nMeanwhile, Pentoshi holds a similar outlook, predicting Solana will sell off to $70 before bouncing and continuing to climb.\n\nThe analyst explained in a recent tweet \u201cnot sure we get as low as I have here, but do expect at some point to be able to bid in the $70\u2019s.\u201d\n\nBut not all analysts are confident Solana will switch bullish after a short-term pullback.\n\nThe Crypto Dog explained a theory that the market is near its current cycle\u2019s top.\n\nGiven the proximity to the Bitcoin halving, this would be an unprecedented occurrence, if accurate. The Crypto Dog alludes that the recent rally was \u201cspurred on by the BTC ETF.\u201d\n\nHowever, he also believes that the \u201ccatalyst ran its course,\u201d and \u201cnow we need to crash and cool off for awhile before the next rally.\u201d\n\nThe tweet has already received 568K impressions, but received an overall negative response from other leading analysts, with Satoshi Flipper responding \u201c$44k is the top of this cycles bull market?\u201d\n\nYou might also like: Gary Gensler issues crypto warning amid Bitcoin ETF decision\n\nUltimately, crypto\u2019s unprecedented landscape with Bitcoin ETFs potentially days away is injecting uncertainty and doubt into the market. This has taken a notable effect on Solana\u2019s price, but many analysts expect a continuation of high volatility before a recovery in the coming weeks.\n\nYet, despite the turbulent market conditions, some cryptos have pushed ahead unfazed. One of those is Bitcoin Minetrix..\n\nBitcoin Minetrix presale raises over $7.8 million\n\nBitcoin Minetrix is a stake-to-mine project whose presale is in progress.\n\nIt works by users depositing their BTCMTX to the project\u2019s staking dashboard, where they will receive Bitcoin mining credits as rewards.\n\nThey can then burn these credits on the platform in exchange for Bitcoin cloud mining power.\n\nThe process allows users to mine Bitcoin regardless of their technical expertise or financial resources.\n\nYou might also like: Bitcoin firm above $40K, Michael Saylor says bull run imminent\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it mitigates the risk of scams, a prevalent concern among many potential cloud mining users.\n\nOther benefits include no space or noise constraints on the user and that it offers a greener alternative to traditional Bitcoin mining.\n\nThese factors have drawn interest from analysts, investors and media outlets alike. So far, the presale has raised over $7.8 million.\n\nMeanwhile, expert analysts like Jacob Bury say the project will rally.\n\nAlso, top media outlets like crypto.news have featured the project.\n\nCurrently, BTCMTX is available for $0.0127 in the ongoing presale.\n\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin consolidated after briefly rallying past $47,000 on optimism that regulators are set to approve the first US exchange-traded funds investing directly in the world\u2019s largest digital asset.\n\nThe token dipped to $46,739 as of 6 a.m. Tuesday in London after a 6.5% jump on Monday in the US to a 21-month high. Bitcoin\u2019s new year climb now stands at 10%, contrasting with drops over the same period in stocks and gold.\n\nThe crypto market expects a green light for US spot Bitcoin ETFs by a Jan. 10 deadline. Prospective issuers such as BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Investments and Ark Investment Management updated paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the regulator has until Wednesday to take action on at least one of the applications.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin ETF Hopefuls Eye This Week for Elusive SEC Approval\n\nSpeculators are wagering that the agency will announce a slew of decisions at once to avoid handing out a first-mover advantage. If the funds are approved, the next question is how much money they will woo. Bitcoin is up 172% in the past 12 months in a sign that traders anticipate wider adoption of the token.\n\n\u201cParticipants seem to be coming around to thinking that the initial flows will actually exceed expectations,\u201d said Kyle Doane, a trader at Arca.\n\nApplicants amended forms on Monday in the US in a final push to offer spot Bitcoin ETF products more than a decade after the first attempt.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler has repeatedly argued that crypto is rife with fraud and misconduct. The agency cracked down on the sector following a 2022 rout and collapses such as the bankruptcy of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX exchange.\n\nBut the SEC last year lost a key legal fight against crypto asset manager Grayscale Investments LLC, spurring speculation that the regulator will have to acquiesce to the spot ETFs. The spat was over the $29 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust\u2019s desire to convert into such a product.\n\nETF Critics\n\nCritics contend that spot crypto ETFs would pose a risk for investors given that digital assets are notorious for volatility and attracting illicit activity.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen, unfortunately, is lots and lots of Americans in our view, are going to get hurt financially,\u201d said Dennis Kelleher, chief executive officer of financial reform nonprofit Better Markets.\n\nThe months-long advance in Bitcoin has lifted the digital-asset market more broadly, bolstering smaller tokens like Solana and Avalanche. US crypto-linked stocks mostly rose on Monday, providing a tailwind for Asian peers such as Japan\u2019s Monex Group and Woori Technology Investment Co. in South Korea.\n\nPullback Risk\n\nSome crypto watchers wonder whether Bitcoin is ripe for a pullback if and when SEC approval finally lands, since speculators may decide to bank a slice of profits from the token\u2019s rally.\n\nThere are \u201cno signs\u201d of a so-called sell-the-news event just yet, Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone Group Ltd., wrote in a note. Based on chart patterns, the $51,000 level is a possible target before any such retreat, according to Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG Australia Pty.\n\nLooking past short-term price gyrations, \u201cthe main result of Bitcoin spot ETF approval will be the marketing machine behind greater Bitcoin awareness, powered by some of the largest names in traditional finance,\u201d wrote Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter.\n\nThe token reached a record high of almost $69,000 back in 2021 during a pandemic-era bull run fueled by ultra-low borrowing costs.\n\n--With assistance from Sunil Jagtiani.\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P."

        "content": "Blockchain stocks are having a mini resurgence: bitcoin\u2019s surprise rally has seen the price of the cryptocurrency top $45k for the first time since April 2022. Here is a collection of stocks to watch as demand for bitcoin mining grows even bigger.\n\nMarathon Digital set a new record in December for the most bitcoins mined in a single month.\n\nRiot Platforms bought 66,560 mining rigs last month as part of ambitious plans to grow its hash rate.\n\nIris Energy bought 248 Nvidia H100 GPUs last August to explore opportunities in generative AI.\n\nMarathon Digital\n\nThe Mining Record Stock\n\nMarathon Digital [MARA] mined 1,853 bitcoins in the final month of 2023, up 56% from November and 290% year-over-year. The Las Vegas-based miner claimed in a press release last week that it believes this is \u201cthe highest monthly total ever recorded by a public bitcoin mining company\u201d, and attributed it to an 18% monthly increase in its hash rate, to 22.4 exahashes per second (EH/s). The Marathon Digital share price jumped 12.1% on 4 January in reaction to the news, while it has gained 489.7% in the past year.\n\nRiot Platforms\n\nThe Mining Rig Stock\n\nRiot Platforms [RIOT] produced 619 bitcoins in December, up 12% from November, taking total production for 2023 to 6,626 bitcoins. Nevertheless, this represented a 9% fall year-over-year. The miner bought 66,560 mining rigs from manufacturer MicroBT last month as part of a long-term purchase agreement, which had seen Riot acquire 33,280 mining rigs in June. It also has the option to add 265,000 more, which would take its hash rate from 12.4 EH/s, as of 31 December, to over 100 EH/s.\n\nBitfarms\n\nThe Aggressive Growth Stock\n\nBitfarms [BITF] earned 446 bitcoins in December, up 13.8% from November, taking the total earned for 2023 to 4,928 bitcoins. The Toronto-based miner ended the year with $118m in liquidity, up from $66m in 2022, and $84m in cash. \u201cIn 2023, we executed our growth plan and laid the groundwork for aggressive growth in 2024,\u201d said CEO Geoff Morphy in a press release.\n\nIris Energy\n\nThe Generative AI Stock\n\nIris Energy [IREN] mined 399 bitcoins in December, taking the total number of bitcoins mined in 2023 to 4,123. The Australian miner acquired 1.6 EH/s of Bitmain T21 miners during the month, increasing its mining capacity to 10 EH/s. It also bought 248 of Nvidia\u2019s [NVDA] H100 GPUs for approximately $10m back in August, which it intends to use to explore opportunities in generative artificial intelligence.\n\nTeraWulf\n\nThe Improving Conditions Stock\n\nTeraWulf [WULF] mined 334 bitcoins in December, up from 323 bitcoins in November. This slight improvement was down to \u201ccontinued improvement leveraging lower winter temperatures across both the Lake Mariner and Nautilus facilities, along with streamlined miner maintenance and healthy transaction fees,\u201d explained Sean Farrell, TeraWulf\u2019s Senior Vice President of Operations, in a press release.\n\nAnother Way to Invest in Blockchain\n\nThe Global X Blockchain ETF\n\nThe Global X Blockchain ETF [BKCH] holds all five stocks as of 5 January. As of 31 December, 73.7% of the portfolio is allocated to information technology (IT) and 23.1% to financials; industrials and communication services are weighted 2.2% and 1%, respectively. The fund is up 214% in the past year through 8 January and up 25.5% in the past six months.\n\nThe iShares Blockchain and Tech ETF [IBLC] also holds all five stocks. As of 5 January, IT accounts for 76.9% of the portfolio, and financials 21.6%; the communication and consumer discretionary sectors both have weightings of under 1%. The fund is up 162.2% in the past year and up 31.3% in the past six months.\n\nDisclaimer Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results.

Or not\u2026\n\nBitcoin ETF\n\nBlackRock, Fidelity, and the like have until today to submit last-minute revisions to their Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission, on the other hand, has until January 10th to rule on at least one of these ETF applications. Insiders believe the SEC will announce a general green light on this date.\n\nBut a letdown is not out of the question. It\u2019s now been 12 years that the SEC has been turning down all ETF applications. However, the pressure is now immense, especially since BlackRock has entered the fray.\n\nA rejection would most likely result in about a 10% drop in bitcoin. This was recently the case after Matrixport strongly suggested that the ETFs would be pushed back (with a 20% drop as consequence).\n\nIf on the contrary, there is approval, $30 trillion could be invested in bitcoin. This is the amount managed by all the investment funds eager to launch an ETF.\n\nBlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Ark, Bitwise, Vaneck, WisdomTree, Invesco/Galaxy, Valkyries, Global X, Hashdex, Franklin Templeton.\n\nNote that all these funds will hold the ETF\u2019s bitcoins at the exchange Coinbase (Vaneck at Gemini). Only the Fidelity fund will actually hold its own bitcoins.\n\nOf course, we should not expect all of these $30 trillion to flow into bitcoin. However, an allocation of 2.5% would suffice to double the market capitalization of bitcoin.\n\nA single bitcoin would then be worth close to $100,000. Considering that other American funds might decide to invest in these ETFs. In such conditions, is it wise to \u201csell the news\u201d?\n\nSome think so\u2026 The following tweet shows that shorts are accumulating. In other words, traders are anticipating a SEC rebuff or that traders will sell the news.\n\nShorts have piled in, expecting a \u201csell-the-news\u201d event.\n\n\n\nShort liquidations will occur in the $44,500 \u2013 $45,200 range\n\n\n\nNever short #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/vAVxITr5dY \u2014 CC15Capital \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@Capital15C) January 7, 2024\n\nCC15Capital believes these shorts will be liquidated as soon as bitcoin enters the $44,500 \u2013 $45,200 zone.\n\nFor my part, I think it\u2019s extremely risky to play the short term downside on the eve of the arrival of institutional players.

        "content": "2024 comes with a lot of expectations in cryptocurrency markets. While notable developments are expected, none is more anticipated than the world\u2019s first spot Bitcoin ETF. In fact, analysts are predicting as much as a 95% chance that the ETF will see the green light. And so, investors anticipate big moves in the market. But the SEC has issued a warning as more investors join the Bitcoin bandwagon. Meanwhile, FOMO is building on the upcoming project, Memeinator, which crossed the $3.1 million in presale.\n\nFOMO warning a reassurance of the first spot Bitcoin ETF?\n\nCopy link to section\n\nSocial media users were excited as the US SEC warned about the risks of crypto investing. SEC warned crypto enthusiasts against building FOMO and investing in digital assets for the sake. From an investment sense, FOMO refers to the fear of missing out on an opportunity. Investors engage in compulsive behaviour, such as buying an asset because of an actual or perceived profit.\n\nWhile it is unclear why the SEC issued the warning, users preempted it as a positive signal for the spot ETF. That comes even as the market awaits a potential decision by the January 10 deadline, with a lot of optimism. Consequently, FOMO has been building around cryptocurrency markets, helping Bitcoin to climb above $44,000.\n\nAccording to the SEC, people should not buy a particular asset because others are. Instead, they should invest because it fits their investing goals. The regulator also warned investors not to take an investment opportunity because popular figures promote it.\n\nMemeinator cultivates meme memories as listing beckons\n\nCopy link to section\n\nAside from Bitcoin, investors are also anxious about the rapidly growing meme landscape. As positive cryptocurrency news develops around Bitcoin, it is obvious the rest of the sector will benefit. One cryptocurrency that has attracted attention is Memeinator.
