        "title": "Bitcoin shaken out of lull by SpaceX sale worries - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nBitcoin has been shaken out of its summer lull on fears that Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX had written down some of the value of its cryptocurrency holdings.\n\nThe flagship token was down 5.1 per cent on Friday, having fallen by nearly 8 per cent during an hour of frenzied trading late on Thursday, coinciding with a report in the Wall Street Journal that SpaceX had written down its bitcoin by $373mn in the past two years and had sold some coins.\n\nIts sudden reversal echoed declines in global stock and bond prices this week as investors are forced to adjust their expectations that US interest rates will stay high, even as the economy remains robust.\n\nThe Federal Reserve lifted its benchmark rate to its highest level in 22 years last month and left the door open to further increases this year. In spite of moves in other assets, the price of bitcoin has remained within a tight trading range over the past two months.\n\nMusk is regarded as one of the crypto market\u2019s biggest cheerleaders and lifted the prices of alternative coins when he mentioned them on his X social media platform. His electric-car company Tesla briefly flirted with accepting payment in the cryptocurrency in 2021 and also ploughed $1.5bn of its own cash into the tokens.\n\nBut bitcoin registered a sharp reversal when Musk abandoned the plans three months later. Since then, the value of the carmaker\u2019s own holdings has fluctuated. Tesla last year recorded $204mn in impairment losses related to its bitcoin holdings.\n\n\u201cHistory shows that the market often reacts sharply to Elon Musk\u2019s actions, implying that this latest revelation could further dampen investor sentiment,\u201d said James Butterfill, head of research at Coinshares, an investment group.\n\nLow trading volumes and decreased volatility also had an impact, he said, as it \u201cmade the market susceptible to larger trades\u201d.\n\nLiquidity and activity in crypto markets have dried up this year as US regulators have cracked down on illicit activity and charged some of the market\u2019s biggest names, including Binance and Coinbase, with violating federal markets laws.\n\nIllustrating the thin liquidity, yesterday it would have taken the sale of 463 bitcoins \u2014 worth about $12mn \u2014 to push the price of the coin down by one per cent of its prevailing market value, according to CCData, an industry information provider.\n\n\n\nIn March, when crypto markets were convulsed by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, it would have taken the sale of 856 bitcoins, then roughly equivalent to $17mn, to move the price of the token by more than 1 per cent.\n\nIn June the SEC filed lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, claiming they had broken the law by selling digital tokens to members of the public without filing the required registrations. The two companies have denied the allegations and vowed to defend themselves in court."

        "title": "Grayscale is on the cusp of winning Bitcoin\u2019s biggest prize\u2014but Wall Street\u2019s big dogs could snatch it away - Fortune",
        "content": "When Michael Sonnenshein became CEO of Grayscale in early 2021, his mission looked straightforward: The former banker was on a crusade to lead the company into a new era where customers could trade the cryptocurrency giant\u2019s core product\u2014stock backed by billions of dollars in Bitcoin\u2014as an ETF. If all went well, it would be cheaper and easier than ever to buy Bitcoin, and crypto would take its place as part of mainstream finance with Sonnenshein as one of the industry\u2019s leading figures.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t worked out that way. Two-and-a-half years after Sonnenshein\u2019s ascension, Grayscale still doesn\u2019t have an ETF, and the company\u2019s name is mud among many investors. Meanwhile, its parent company is mired in legal trouble with customers, rivals, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Sonnenshein desperately needs to catch a break\u2014and is poised to get one in the coming days if a federal court sides with Grayscale in a closely watched case.\n\nBut a new obstacle stands in the way of Grayscale\u2019s dream: competition. Financial giants like BlackRock are swooping in to snatch up the Bitcoin ETF market, which one analyst says will gradually open the door to a $30 trillion capital pool that could funnel hundreds of billions of dollars into crypto.\n\nSonnenshein is putting on a brave face about these headwinds, telling Fortune: \u201cI remain focused on Grayscale, and not getting distracted.\u201d But with or without a court victory, there is a real risk the company could lose out\u2014and become a footnote in the industry it helped create.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s golden goose\n\nCrypto still carries some of the outlaw reputation from its early days, when the industry\u2019s leading figures were radicals, weirdos, or outright criminals. Sonnenshein is none of those things. He is tall, likes to wear suits, and has the air of a banker from JPMorgan, where he worked before joining Grayscale as one of its first employees.\n\nThe crypto world is famously tribal, but if Sonnenshein has a tribe, it\u2019s the world of Manhattan\u2019s affluent Upper East Side, where he was raised and still lives, and where working on Wall Street is a proud tradition. This background made him a natural choice to lead Grayscale, a well-established crypto brand that needed an ambassador to regulators and the old guards of finance. At the same time, the fact that Sonnenshein has been part of Grayscale since it launched in 2014 gives him credibility with longtime crypto figures.\n\n\u201cBeing employee No. 1 prepared me for the role [of CEO] by doing a bit of what everyone here does,\u201d he told Fortune in a recent interview.\n\nSonnenshein\u2019s job was made easier by the fact Grayscale was milking a cash cow. The company has long produced a gusher of easy revenue thanks to the prescience of its founder, Barry Silbert, who had been the first to spot a lucrative trade that involved wrapping Bitcoin in the garb of traditional finance.\n\nIn 2013, Silbert ran Second Market, a company that offered rich investors access to rare items like fine wine or pre-IPO shares of Twitter and Facebook. In order to tap into the growing interest in crypto, Second Market created a novel product in the form of BIT, a trust built to hold Bitcoin, and then sold shares in that trust to accredited investors.\n\nBuying shares in what would become known as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (ticker: GBTC) has never made much sense for everyday crypto aficionados. If you want to own Bitcoin, the best way is to buy it directly through Coinbase, Kraken, or another broker. Doing so lets you use the Bitcoin for purchases or gifts, and, more important, it doesn\u2019t cost anything after the initial transaction; holding GBTC, on the other hand, involves tying up funds while paying Grayscale a 2% annual management fee.\n\nFor Grayscale and accredited investors, though, the GBTC arrangement made plenty of sense. As the value of the assets in the trust swelled to billions of dollars, the company raked in fat fees, and the upscale investors who purchased GBTC shares from the company could unload them on the retail market 12 months later, typically for a handsome profit. It was a grand arbitrage opportunity\u2014especially after Grayscale obtained a legal status in 2020 that shortened the period to flip shares to six months\u2014and it went on for years.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2021, the Grayscale shares traded at a premium to the underlying Bitcoin that backed them. This premium was explained in part by millennial investors who liked the ease of buying crypto in stock form\u2014in 2020, a survey found that GBTC was a top-five choice among those under age 30, along with big-name firms like Apple and Tesla\u2014and by institutions that wanted exposure to Bitcoin but that, for legal or operational reasons, couldn\u2019t hold it directly. And if the price of Bitcoin went up\u2014which it has for the most part\u2014GBTC\u2019s share price followed. In this context, no one really minded paying a 2% cut.\n\nDreaming of a Bitcoin ETF\n\nGrayscale\u2019s jerry-rigged system to sell Bitcoin in a trust was always supposed to be a temporary arrangement. Silbert, Grayscale\u2019s founder, has said so himself. The long-term plan has been to wait for the U.S regulatory landscape to evolve, and then package Bitcoin as shares in an exchange-traded fund.\n\nSince the first one launched more than 30 years ago, ETFs have become hugely popular with investors of all stripes, offering a safe and convenient way to get exposure to everything from gold to stock indexes for fees as low as two basis points (0.02%), or two cents for every $100 invested. Many in finance, both inside and outside the crypto industry, believe the time is right for a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe first company to offer a Bitcoin ETF is poised to reap a handsome reward\u2014most analysts believe deep-pocketed pension funds and other institutional investors will welcome the familiar legal structure of an ETF and jump into the crypto market for the first time. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, these investors control $30 trillion of wealth, and could deploy 1% to 2% into crypto.\n\nGrayscale has been eyeing this opportunity for years, but the company was hardly the only one. Back in 2013, when Bitcoin opened the year trading around $900, the Winklevoss twins\u2019 crypto firm Gemini applied to create the first one, only to be rejected by the Securities and Exchange Commission four years later. According to the SEC, the Bitcoin market was too small and thinly traded, which could open the door for someone to manipulate the price of the ETF shares. During this time, in 2017, Grayscale approached the SEC to convert GBTC shares into an ETF but voluntarily withdrew the application.\n\nMore than a year later, in 2018, the agency rejected a second Gemini bid. Even though the size of the Bitcoin market had expanded significantly\u2014the currency was coming off a bull market that saw the price brush $20,000\u2014officials remained concerned about price manipulation. Shortly after this second refusal, the SEC turned down nine other companies\u2019 applications to create a Bitcoin ETF, always on the same grounds.\n\nThese rejections came as no surprise to Grayscale or anyone else. The 2017 bull market had vaulted crypto into the mainstream, but also given rise to outrageous scams and exposed many of the industry\u2019s leading figures as two-bit hucksters\u2014or worse. In response, Grayscale stuck to its plan to play the long game and wait for the right regulatory infrastructure to emerge.\n\nIt didn\u2019t hurt, of course, that Grayscale could rake in even more cash while waiting for the SEC logjam to break. By 2018, in addition to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which currently holds over 3% of the world\u2019s Bitcoin, the company had created identical trusts to offer shares in other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum and Litecoin, for which it charged even higher fees\u2014as much as 2.5% per year. At its peak, Grayscale would have more than $60 billion in assets under management, which generated $20 million a month in revenue.\n\nThe upshot was that, in early 2021, Grayscale was in a win-win situation\u2014it was poised to be at the vanguard of a new Bitcoin ETF market when the SEC finally came around, and it could keep raking in fees from its trust products. But then everything changed, and Grayscale\u2019s once-loved product became toxic in the eyes of many investors.\n\nThe grand plan fizzles\n\nGrayscale\u2019s biggest trust had for years provided a handsome arbitrage opportunity. Then one day the easy money dried up.\n\nEver since a precursor to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust launched in late 2013, shares had always traded at a premium to the so-called NAV\u2014the net asset value of Bitcoins held in the trust. The GBTC premium was typically more than 10%, and sometimes as high as 40%. The shares couldn\u2019t be exchanged for Bitcoin, but they remained hughely popular with institutional and retail investors all the same.\n\nIn March 2021, however, GBTC shares began trading at a slight discount to NAV, a gap that would soon widen significantly:\n\nThe discount occurred owing to a series of factors, including the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in Canada and Europe, and the fact that mainstream companies like PayPal and Robinhood had made it easier to buy Bitcoin directly.\n\nThe emergence of the discount didn\u2019t sting much at first, since for much of 2021 the crypto market went on a spectacular bull run that saw the price of Bitcoin peak near $70,000. In this context, GBTC shares soared alongside Bitcoin, so everyone was in the green. It was during this time, in October 2021, that Grayscale finally pursued a full-blown effort to ask the SEC to let it convert GBTC into an ETF.\n\nThe mood among Grayscale investors turned sour, however, toward the end of that year as crypto\u2019s latest bubble burst, and as the GBTC discount to NAV widened.\n\nGBTC owners stewed over the fact their money was tied up in a stock that now had little appeal to other buyers\u2014and worse, that came with management fees of 2% a year or more. Institutional investors were caught flat-footed when the long-time arbitrage opportunity abruptly vanished.\n\n\u201cIt was a great carry trade that everyone suddenly got stuck in,\u201d said a crypto executive who asked not to be named. The executive added that several crypto funds, including the since-failed Three Arrows Capital hedge fund (known as 3AC), got wiped out through holding large blocks of suddenly illiquid GBTC.\n\nThe implosion of 3AC in March 2022 accelerated a full-blown bear market. Then in June of that year, the SEC rejected Grayscale\u2019s ETF. The company had expected such an outcome, and, in a sign of how urgent its business predicament had become, filed a lawsuit that same day asking a court to reject the SEC\u2019s ruling.\n\nGBTC customers get restless\n\nThe lawsuit would prove to be a symbolic milestone for Grayscale and the crypto industry. But it did little to help GBTC owners, who could only grit their teeth as they paid 2% a year and watched the NAV gap turn into a chasm as the crypto market imploded in the wake of the massive FTX scandal. In response, disgruntled investors organized abusive Twitter campaigns against Silbert and Sonnenshein, and the hedge fund Fir Tree Partners sued Grayscale over alleged mismanagement.\n\nSome demanded Grayscale conduct a so-called Reg M redemption\u2014an esoteric process that would entail getting permission from the SEC to let customers exchange their shares for the underlying Bitcoin. Such relief would both placate Grayscale\u2019s noisiest critics, by letting them redeem their Bitcoin at market value, and help close the GBTC discount.\n\nGrayscale, however, has refused to offer such a redemption\u2014a process that would shrink its asset base and its commissions\u2014and at times has invoked legal pretexts, including a 2015 consent decree with the SEC, to declare that it can\u2019t even do such a thing.\n\nIn interviews with Fortune, however, several lawyers said there is no serious legal barrier to conducting a redemption, and suggested Grayscale\u2019s hesitancy is driven by business concerns. \u201cRedemption opens the door for less AUM, therefore less fees,\u201d said Fred Rispoli of Hodl Law.\n\nIn an attempt to pacify frustrated investors, Grayscale\u2019s parent company bought up hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of trust shares to defend the price of GBTC and its sister stocks. The effort did little to boost the share price or narrow the discount, and investors\u2019 howls grew louder.\n\nAs for Sonnenshein, he\u2019s declined to cut Grayscale\u2019s fees or offer a redemption. Instead, one of his primary roles as CEO has been to undertake frequent media appearances, making the case over and over again that the best option for investors is to wait for the company to prevail in court and obtain its ETF\u2014an event that would close the discount to NAV, and likely cause the price of Bitcoin to soar.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s strategy to brush off investor frustration and stay the course could be vindicated when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia rules on the question of whether the SEC was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d in denying the company\u2019s ETF bid. A decision is expected any day, and analysts say Grayscale has a 70% chance to win\u2014but even a victory may not be enough to rescue the firm.\n\nBlackRock and Fidelity wait in the wings\n\nBy the time Grayscale sued the SEC in June 2022, the agency\u2019s chairman, Gary Gensler, had repeatedly taken a hard line against the crypto industry\u2014to the point where even impartial observers began to question if he had stepped beyond the limits of his authority.\n\nThe SEC suffered a legal setback in July when a federal judge rejected its interpretation of securities law in a case involving the crypto company Ripple, and the D.C. appeals court has sent signals that it may deliver another one with Grayscale. During oral arguments in March, the three-judge panel repeatedly poked holes in the agency\u2019s argument that spot market ETFs\u2014like the one Grayscale seeks to offer\u2014are different than ETFs for Bitcoin futures, which the SEC approved in 2021.\n\nThe situation means Grayscale could demolish a major legal obstacle blocking its path to a Bitcoin ETF. But this may not be enough. Since it first filed for the ETF, two major developments now threaten Sonnenshein\u2019s dream of leading the crypto industry into a new era.\n\nThe first is trouble at Grayscale\u2019s parent company. In January, another one of DCG\u2019s main subsidiaries, Genesis, declared its lending unit insolvent, and froze the assets of hundreds of thousands of customers. The legal mess, which is ongoing, has also led to allegations of questionable accounting practices at DCG and its subsidiaries\u2014notably a promissory note with a 1% interest rate that Genesis obtained from DCG in what critics say was a slippery attempt to plug a hole in the now-bankrupt subsidiary\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nThe controversy led the SEC to sue Genesis in January, and, according to an unconfirmed Bloomberg report, has given rise to investigations by the agency and the Justice Department into intracompany loans at DCG. In interviews with Fortune, lawyers said it was hard to characterize the loans as arm\u2019s-length transactions.\n\nFor now, no agency has publicly accused DCG of wrongdoing. The company insists its subsidiaries operate as stand-alone units, and that Genesis executives are responsible for the company\u2019s problems. A DCG spokesperson told Fortune that it arranged the promissory note on the advice of reputable lawyers, and that there was nothing wrong or misleading about the transaction.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear where the chips will land with Genesis and DCG, but, according to lawyers and industry watchers, the debacle may provide the SEC with a new reason to deny or slow-walk Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF application.\n\n\u201cAfter last year, there\u2019s mistrust in crypto industry heads, including Barry Silbert, for acting in self-interested ways,\u201d says Damien Scott, a crypto lawyer at Scoolidge, Peters, Russotti & Fox. \u201cThat could be weighing on the SEC\u2014\u2018Do we really want to give it to these guys? A BlackRock or Fidelity is a safer bet.\u2019\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s comment about the SEC awarding the first Bitcoin ETF to BlackRock is not hypothetical\u2014and points to the other major development that could thwart Sonnenshein\u2019s plans.\n\nIn June, the giant asset manager filed an ETF application of its own, a move that goosed crypto prices as analysts took the application as a signal BlackRock believed it would succeed with the SEC where others had failed. \u201cThey are about as good as it gets at reading the regulatory tea leaves,\u201d said one. Soon after, Fidelity and other big names filed for Bitcoin ETFs of their own.\n\nThe upshot is that the SEC, whether it wins or loses the Grayscale case, is in a position to award the first Bitcoin ETF to BlackRock or to another familiar name from traditional finance, a move likely to have more political appeal both inside and outside the agency.\n\n\u201cBlackRock is the Apple of the financial industry,\u201d the ETF analyst Balchunas told Fortune. \u201cThe key thing people don\u2019t know is advisors love them. It\u2019s like in the \u201980s with IBM stock\u2014you can\u2019t get fired buying it.\u201d\n\nAll of this raises the very real question of whether Grayscale would be late to the party, or stuck on the sidelines entirely, as BlackRock and others reap the first fruits of Bitcoin ETFs. And what happens then to Grayscale and all of its customers paying 2% a year?\n\n\u2018A few big winners\u2014and then you\u2019ll have to be creative or lucky\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe Grayscale isn\u2019t worried about Wall Street behemoths muscling in to snatch its long-sought prize. But for now, Sonnenshein is taking the position that his company is the only one that has the operational chops to offer a Bitcoin ETF.\n\n\u201cThe filings you\u2019re seeing now are ideas on paper, while Grayscale is a fund with billions of assets and 10 years of operational success,\u201d Sonnenshein told Fortune, adding that the company has always envisioned a landscape with multiple Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe problem, however, is that new ETF categories have proved to be a winner-take-all market. That was the case with the first ETF for Bitcoin futures, operated by a firm called ProShares, which now controls over $1 billion in assets and 97% of trading volume. A similar ETF from rival Valkyrie, which launched only a few days after ProShares, controls only around $30 million, according to Balchunas.\n\nThe analyst added that the Bitcoin ETF market is likely to resemble the one for gold. That market featured a dominant early player, but in time grew to include a handful of other firms, which grabbed a slice of the market by offering niche variations or, in the case of BlackRock\u2019s gold ETF, a big discount on price.\n\nIn the current jump-ball environment for a Bitcoin ETF, large and well-known firms have an advantage thanks to their huge marketing budgets and long-standing relationships with brokerages and financial advisors.\n\n\u201cThere is potential for a few big winners\u2014and then you\u2019ll have to be creative or lucky,\u201d Balchunas said of the likely trajectory of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThere is also the question of how much the ETF issuers will be able to collect. Justin Young, CEO of Volatility Shares, which has created other types of exotic ETFs, told Fortune that the first Bitcoin products to market likely will be able to command a fee of over 1%, but that this will drop rapidly as competitors emerge.\n\nIt\u2018s unclear where Grayscale will fit into this world. If the company isn\u2019t first to market, it\u2019s likely BlackRock or another rival will vacuum up the vast majority of customers. And while Grayscale has the advantage of possessing millions of GBTC investors\u2014who will automatically be converted to ETF owners under the company\u2019s plan\u2014many of them are resentful over the firm\u2019s refusal to cut fees or issue redemptions. Many will likely bolt.\n\nSonnenshein says Grayscale customers are unlikely to flee to a rival, because doing so would trigger a taxable event if they sell their shares instead of keeping their money in the ETF it plans to create. He also made the case that customers will be well-served by sticking with a company with years of expertise in running crypto funds. And, on a more personal level, Sonnenshein said he believes Grayscale will achieve its destiny as leader of the crypto ETF market.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud of coming through a time after the pandemic that saw different businesses shutting, during Crypto Winter,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are built to survive all cycles.\u201d"

To date, investors who have bought units of Canadian spot bitcoin ETFs have never had their assets hacked or had their funds lost through malpractice or poor balance sheet management, which cannot be said for the millions of investors who trusted their assets with the likes of FTX, Celsius Network and BlockFi."

        "content": "The minutes cautioned that Fed officials see \"upside risks\" to inflation that could potentially lead to more rate hikes. At that meeting, Fed raised its benchmark interest rate to the highest in more than 22 years . Markets have been betting the central bank wouldn't make any more moves on interest rates this year. In reaction, the stock market fell for a second straight day Wednesday and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit its highest close since 2008.\n\nBitcoin was last lower by about 4% at $27,901.60, according to Coin Metrics. The slide began after the minutes of the Federal Reserve's July policy meeting were released Wednesday. Earlier Thursday, it fell to $27,858.94, its lowest level since June 20.\n\nCryptocurrencies were under pressure Thursday as investors grappled with renewed concerns about the U.S. economy.\n\nBitcoin's correlation with stocks is at its lowest level in two years, according to Coin Metrics, but in 2022 it shot to an all-time high in response to the Fed's rate-hiking campaign to tame inflation.\n\n\"Although inflation in itself could be an argument for growth in crypto assets, with inflation comes other aspects like risk off appetite from investors fearing a recession, and avoiding what bitcoin is deemed to be, riskier assets,\" said Sylvia Jablonski, chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs.\n\n\"My suspicion is that the higher beta equities and crypto are the victims of the end of summer lag, range-bound trading, no volume, which is typical in August \u2014 with the hawkish Fed as the cherry on top to keep investors to the side and prices in this tight range,\" Jablonski said.\n\nBitcoin and ether's 90-day volatility dropped to multiyear lows at 35% and 37% this week, respectively, according to Kaiko.\n\nNeedham's John Todaro added that bitcoin's move back to $30,000 in late June \"had been on light volume so that rally has not had a ton of strength.\" The eventual debut of a spot bitcoin ETF, one of crypto's biggest positive catalysts, also lost some steam this week, he added.\n\n\"With a U.S. [spot bitcoin] ETF likely not seeing a near term decision given the setback this week as well as expectations for higher rates for longer, bitcoin and crypto broadly are pulling back,\" he told CNBC. \"Remaining catalysts are Halving expectations in Q1-Q2 '24 and any on-going ETF related comments from the SEC.\"\n\nSeveral of the top crypto assets by market cap \u2014 including Binance's BNB coin , Ripple's XRP and the solana and polygon coins \u2014 were lower by more than 3% on Thursday. Ether fell 4%."

        "content": "Approval of a spot bitcoin exchange traded fund in the U.S. is one of the most widely anticipated and delayed events in the roughly three-decade history of the ETF industry.\n\nThose delays are popping up again. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently put off decisions on some recent spot bitcoin ETF filings until next year. That\u2019s not unusual \u2013 the commission has an established history of doing that. Nor does it mean those filings will be rejected. For now, however, there\u2019s plenty of speculation and not much in the way of tangible results in terms of these ETFs coming to market in the U.S.\n\nOne thing that crypto bulls and market observers can agree on is that the price of bitcoin could surge in epic fashion if related spot ETFs are approved in the U.S. If that happens, established crypto-related ETFs such as the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) could generate noteworthy upside of their own.\n\nWhy SATO Is Relevant Here\n\nOn the spot bitcoin ETF approval front, SATO is relevant for multiple reasons. First, the bulk of the ETF\u2019s 36 holdings are bitcoin miners \u2013 an asset class intimately correlated to the digital currency\u2019s price action.\n\nSecond, SATO\u2019s largest holding is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) . That fund would likely rocket higher if a spot bitcoin ETF comes to life. In fact, Grayscale is attempting to convert GBTC to the ETF wrapper. GBTC accounts for 17.66% of SATO\u2019s roster. The point is the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF has implications, most of them positive, for assets like SATO. Consider the following.\n\nIn a recent interview with CNBC, Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee said a US-listed spot bitcoin ETF could lead to favorable supply/demand dynamics for the digital currency. That would potentially take its price to $150,000 and perhaps as high as $180,000. Those prices are more than five and six times where bitcoin resides at this writing.\n\nEven if the SEC doesn\u2019t approve a spot bitcoin ETF, there are avenues for bitcoin to deliver 2024 upside. Though not likely to the tune of reaching six-figure territory. Lee mentions the 2024 halving and the possibility of a more accommodative monetary policy from the Fed as potential catalysts for the cryptocurrency next year.\n\n\u201cCrypto is dependent on monetary policy. So, if inflation is cooling, then we can start to bet on forward financial conditions easing and central bank easing sooner,\u201d Lee said in the CNBC interview. \u201cThat\u2019s bullish for crypto or alternative assets.\u201d"

Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Jared Blikre explores the price action surrounding the crypto space and how crypto-related stocks are faring ahead of Thursday's closing bell.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJARED BLIKRE: I haven't talked about crypto in a while. Let's take a look at the Wi-Fi interactive, where we are seeing some definite downside action, and not only Bitcoin but Ethereum. Each down about 4%. And here is a three-month chart of Bitcoin.\n\nAnd you can see, after reaching this local peak here in early July, it has just been a steady slog down for Bitcoin, now reaching the lowest levels in about two months and also having the worst day in a month. Just haven't seen much volatility lately. In fact, most days you see crypto doing practically nothing. So kind of in and of itself, something worth mentioning.\n\nA couple of things on the horizon here, we just got Coinbase, one of the biggest brokers in the world, also in exchange, got permission from the Commodity Futures Training Commission only yesterday to become a futures commission merchant. So this is going to mean that they can sell to their customers futures contracts in both Bitcoin and Ethereum, anything else that comes down the pike that's authorized by the CFTC. It doesn't really change the regulatory game that much.\n\nThey still have problems with the SEC, but it does kind of make the SEC look out of step. So let's get back to the charts here. Here's Bitcoin. I was showing you the last three months. But interesting thing that's happening over the last year, guess what?\n\nWe are now poking just below this lower trend line. So really, the bulls want to get above $28,000, $28,500 pretty soon here. Otherwise, it's going to start looking like a breakdown. Now, crypto is known for a lot of false breakdowns. I'm always on alert for one of those, and that usually happens over the course of a few days.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo we'll look to see what's happening here in the crypto universe. I can also take a look at some of the crypto stocks. This is just what's happened today. Some of these names like Riot Blockchain down 10%. But a lot of these names have simply been decimated.\n\nHere is a year to date look though. You can see huge, huge gains. Let's take Mara for instance, Marathon Digital Holdings. The local minimum was in January, had a big peak in July. But most of these assets have sold off in the general risk-off fever that we've had, and a lot of that simply has to do with interest rates.\n\nWe've had the long end of the curve. This is a 10-year T-note yield over the last three months. This has been absolutely screaming higher. That puts pressure on Bitcoin. Bitcoin does not offer a rate of return.\n\nSo the thinking goes, well, higher rates, missing out on something there. There is another alternative. So just in general, when we have these rates screaming higher, it's an easy excuse to sell Bitcoin, and perhaps that's what's happening here. But really want to see $28,500 in the near future for Bitcoin bulls. Guys.\n\n- All right. Jared with the levels for us to watch. Jared Blikre at the New York Stock Exchange. Thank you so much."

        "title": "Is Crypto a Commodity? What It Means, Examples - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is a Crypto Commodity?\n\n\"Crypto commodity\" is the generally accepted term for a tradable and fungible token representing a commodity, utility, asset, or contract in the real or virtual world. The underlying asset's value is tokenized on a blockchain, and the asset is secured or held in reserve. Once created, the token is considered a crypto commodity. It can then be traded like any other cryptocurrency or commodity wherever it can legally be traded.\n\nThe term can also refer to legally regulated cryptocurrencies traded as commodities. Bitcoin, ether, and other cryptocurrencies are considered commodities by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nKey Takeaways A crypto commodity is a tradeable and fungible token representing an underlying asset.\n\nThe Commodity Futures Exchange Commission has defined cryptocurrency and related assets as commodities, thus claiming jurisdiction under specific use cases.\n\nThe framework for defining crypto commodities and other virtual assets remains gray because regulators, developers, traders, investors, and courts are battling over definitions and jurisdiction.\n\nThe History of Crypto Commodities\n\nA quick dive into the evolutionary history of cryptocurrency platforms is warranted to understand the concept of crypto commodities.\n\nAs the Bitcoin network evolved, it gained popularity for its ease of payment processing and decentralized nature. Technology stalwarts quickly realized that blockchain networks could be used for more than simple online payments. Bitcoin had a fiat currency value, which created interest in transferring other asset values to the blockchain. Asset ownership could be recorded on the chain, and tokens created to represent ownership of that asset.\n\nOnce this was realized, the world exploded with tokens. Digital art was tokenized on a blockchain and sold to collectors; virtual property in a persistent digital landscape was tokenized and sold; and the concept of tokenizing real estate and property emerged. Many other tokens were created and could be bought and sold on digital exchanges.\n\nAs long as there is demand from investors for crypto commodities, they are likely to continue being traded on commodity and crypto exchanges.\n\nNext came the idea that derivatives of the tokens could be created, much like stock and commodity derivatives. These are contracts that could be bought and sold by traders and investors, who are essentially betting on the price movements of the assets the contracts were linked to. The Commodity Future Trading Commission (CFTC) quickly stepped in and began regulating these tradeable assets.\n\nConcerns About Crypto Commodities\n\nAs of August 2023, virtual assets like cryptocurrency and crypto commodities do not have clearly defined legislation or regulatory guidelines. Due to existing regulations, authorities have claimed jurisdiction over specific blockchain-related tokens, assets, and investing and trading activities. However, there is still controversy regarding regulating decentralized assets such as crypto and if regulators have jurisdiction over them.\n\nBoth the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Cboe Options Exchange have cryptocurrency-derived products, which can be readily traded alongside more traditional commodities like gold and corn.\n\nHowever, in July 2023, the Southern District of New York district court issued a summary judgment against Ripple for violating securities laws when it sold cryptocurrency to institutional investors. But the company was judged to have not violated any securities laws when selling its coin on exchanges to individual investors. The effect this ruling will have on crypto commodities, which are basically cryptocurrencies, remains unclear.\n\nWhich Cryptos are Classified as Commodities? Some or all cryptos are commodities, depending on which regulatory authority you ask. The classification depends on the circumstances the cryptocurrency is issued under, how it is made available to investors, how it trades, and how investors and traders treat it.\n\nWhat Is the Difference Between a Commodity and a Cryptocurrency? Traditionally, a commodity is a raw physical good used in other goods and services. Cryptocurrency began as a virtual payment system. The line distinguishing between the two is blurring as cryptocurrency investing and trading products continue to emerge.\n\nWhat Commodities are Backed By Cryptocurrencies? There are no commodities backed by cryptocurrencies. However, there are commodity-backed stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies that are collateralized by reserves of physical goods. Examples are PAX-Gold (PAXG) and Tether Gold (XUAt).\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCryptocommodities are tokens that represent an underlying or secured commodity on a blockchain. They can also be cryptocurrencies, depending on specific regulatory authorities' definitions."

        "title": "A bitcoin spot ETF could open the floodgates for wider crypto demand - TechCrunch",
        "content": "Years after it got initial approval, Jacobi Asset Management\u2019s bitcoin spot exchange traded fund (ETF) went live this week, making the product the first of its kind in Europe.\n\nThis is only the latest sign that Europe is making steady progress toward integrating crypto assets inside traditional financial instruments. Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is dragging its feet by delaying deadlines for similar applications.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say there hasn\u2019t been any progress stateside. According to Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, bitcoin futures ETFs do exist in the United States, but they account for only about $1 billion in total assets under management (AUM), \u201cSo that does exist, but the spot is the holy grail. The spot bitcoin ETF [will be] major,\u201d he said on TechCrunch\u2019s Chain Reaction podcast.\n\nThe difference between a spot ETF and a futures ETF is that the former actually purchases and holds the underlying assets. It\u2019s a more popular approach than futures-related ETFs. According to Balchunas, spot gold ETFs, for example, have consumed the majority of gold ETF activity, and bitcoin could be traded similarly if it gets regulatory approval.\n\nFor an advisor, a bitcoin spot ETF wouldn\u2019t be the main part of their portfolio; it would be like hot sauce \u2014 a small bit on top. Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst, Bloomberg\n\nLots of money is potentially up for grabs. \u201cThe stakes are high\u201d for the various entities working to bring a spot bitcoin ETF to the American market, Balchunas argued. About 10 firms are competing to get the first bitcoin spot ETF approved in the U.S., and BlackRock, which has more than $9 trillion in assets under management, filed for its own offering in June.\n\nBlackRock also partnered with Coinbase in 2022 to provide its institutional clients with access to cryptocurrency, and later launched its own spot bitcoin private trust for U.S. institutional clients.\n\n\u201cThe question is, will [the SEC] approve [a bitcoin spot ETF], when will they approve it and how many they\u2019ll approve at once,\u201d Balchunas said. Right now, he and other Bloomberg analysts estimate 65% odds that the regulator will approve one or more by the end of the year. The odds are even higher for next year.\n\n\u201cEverything is evolving towards that,\u201d Balchunas added. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to completely change the face of crypto. I think what it does is offer a portal for a big lump of money that largely would not probably deal with bitcoin, [but] might now. That would be the $30 trillion that financial advisors manage in America.\u201d\n\nIn other words, a bitcoin spot ETF could be considered the bridge that connects trillions of dollars to crypto. \u201cNot everyone is going to cross that bridge, but you\u2019ll certainly find some traffic there,\u201d Balchunas said.\n\nWhy do we care about bitcoin ETFs?\n\nWhy does an ETF matter, since we have so many exchanges around the world that allow consumers and institutions alike to purchase crypto-related assets and securities? Well, because ETFs could allow folks in the traditional financial world to buy into the crypto market using their existing investing services \u2014 companies like Fidelity and Vanguard that may hold retirement assets, for example.\n\nBringing bitcoin to the TradFi market in a manner that is already well-understood from an operational, trading, and fee perspective, could unlock lots of demand for the cryptocurrency in the near-term. Such interest could lead to the ETF in question buying more total bitcoin to meet demand, shifting crypto\u2019s supply equation. More demand with flat supply would send the price up, in other words.\n\nThere is nuance to the BlackRock ETF that warrants attention. While Balchunas did hazard a guess where fees for such a product could land, that\u2019s not the fee schedule we are interested in. Instead, the cost for trading the ETF will be de minimis, around 1 basis point.\n\nIf that is the case, and the ETF does a good job tracking the price of bitcoin and it is incredibly liquid, then there\u2019s no reason for regular folks to buy bitcoin how they do today. As we all know, you have to jump through a slew of hoops before you can actually say you own any crypto.\n\nA bitcoin spot ETF could also lead to lower demand for the trading services on crypto exchanges, which have so far powered leading players in the ecosystem. Until recently, Coinbase made its daily bread on trading fees, not interest derived from its holdings, after all.\n\n\u201cFor an advisor, [a bitcoin spot ETF] wouldn\u2019t be the main part of their portfolio; it would be like hot sauce \u2014 a small [bit] on top,\u201d Balchunas said. \u201cIn ETF land, advisors would pay more for hot sauce,\u201d especially for something that could go up in a hurry, he added.\n\nStill, with Coinbase partnering with BlackRock for its potential ETF, the crypto exchange could find itself eating on both sides of the plate. It can continue earning fees for its crypto asset trading services while milking TradFi demand by helping power BlackRock\u2019s ETF effort.\n\nIt will be simpler to get your parents up and running with an ETF than onboarding them to, say, Binance. So perhaps the two demographics \u2014 crypto novice and crypto native \u2014 are sufficiently differentiated that they won\u2019t eat into one another.\n\nThere has been a lot of noise over the years about institutional money pouring into crypto and the impact of such an influx of cash. Institutional money managers are coming to crypto, potentially unlocking more small-ball demand for crypto, and crypto\u2019s current gatekeepers will find their roles changing, then, to more facilitating this shift than actually helping generate demand as the category begins opening up to the wider world.\n\nMore to come when we get a damn bitcoin spot ETF approval over the line and can truly vet market demand for the product. That\u2019d finally let us more clearly see its impact on other parts of the larger web3 world.\n\nThis story was inspired by an episode of TechCrunch\u2019s podcast Chain Reaction.

        "title": "Let's talk Bitcoin staking: Babylon's litepaper - Blockworks",
        "content": "Can Bitcoin help enhance the security of proof-of-stake blockchains? The team behind the Babylon network has published a new paper exploring that question.\n\nBabylon is built using the Cosmos software development kit (SDK) and was designed by a team of researchers from Stanford University. And as Blockworks has previously reported, the team isn\u2019t new to the idea of using Bitcoin in conjunction with the network.\n\nThe team released a paper earlier this year for a Bitcoin timestamping protocol for use by proof-of-stake networks. Yet according to David Tse, the founder of Babylon Chain and a Stanford University professor, the timestamping protocol has limitations. Namely, it\u2019s only useful for long-range security protection.\n\n\u201cThe timestamp takes a long time before it becomes secure on the Bitcoin chain, because Bitcoin is very slow,\u201d Tse said.\n\nThe latest paper explores the other end of the spectrum: utilizing Bitcoin for short-range security on such chains.\n\nHow it works\n\nA problem faced today by many layer-1 proof-of-stake blockchains (outside of Ethereum) is that the capital backing the chain is comparatively insignificant. According to Tse, most proof-of-stake chains rely on their native tokens to back their assets.\n\n\u201cThe idea we have is, is it possible to use a non-native asset to secure a chain?\u201d Tse said.\n\nThat\u2019s where Bitcoin comes in. Although using Bitcoin to secure a proof-of-stake chain may sound impossible \u2014 Bitcoin is a distinct, proof-of-work chain \u2014 Tse and his team have utilized simple staking logic to make this possible.\n\n\u201cStaking has similarities to lending. When you borrow money to me, you might be worried that I will run away with the money, so you demand collateral \u2014 for example my house \u2014 this means if I run away, you can take my house,\u201d Tse said.\n\nTo participate in network activities on a proof-of stake-chain, one must provide collateral. In the event a staker proves to be malicious, their stake is subsequently taken from them in a process known as slashing.\n\n\u201cThe challenge for our problem then, is how do we slash the Bitcoin asset,\u201d Tse said.\n\nBridging, in this case, wouldn\u2019t be an option, as Bitcoin bridging is often considered an insecure process, Tse said. Further, Bitcoin does not support smart contracts as far as its scripting language capability is concerned.\n\nWhat Babylon\u2019s latest paper proposes is using a particular cryptographic scheme so that once a validator does something wrong, their private key is automatically revealed.\n\n\u201cSlashing functionalities is achieved through a spending condition which is expressible in the Bitcoin scripting language,\u201d Tse said. \u201cThere is a type of signature called the extractable one-time signature \u2014 which means when you sign something once, it is secure, but when you use the same key to sign something twice, then automatically your key will be revealed.\u201d\n\nWithin Babylon\u2019s Bitcoin staking protocol, all slashable offenses then can be reduced to signing something twice \u2014 which will cause a private key to be revealed.\n\nIt\u2019s an approach that could prove compelling for participants \u2014 but one not devoid of risk.\n\nBob Summerwill, the executive director of the Ethereum Classic Cooperative, told Blockworks that Babylon\u2019s \u201csell\u201d is that stakers are getting yield on Bitcoin. \u201cBut that also means that you are putting it at risk,\u201d he added.\n\nLooking ahead, the Babylon team is soliciting feedback from the community. It plans to launch a mainnet early next year.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether fell on Thursday morning in Asia, along with other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptos. Bitcoin briefly dipped below $28,500, while Ether\u2019s losses took it below the psychologically important $1,800 threshold. Smaller altcoins such as Dogecoin, Solana and Ripple suffered the biggest drops. In more bullish news, Coinbase Global received approval to offer crypto futures to U.S. retail investors. The Forkast 500 NFT Index was down, although market sentiment remains positive amid a prolonged increase in global transactions. U.S. equity futures traded mixed after another day of losses Wednesday. The release of the minutes for July\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting on interest rates has cast a shadow over equities, the mood music now suggesting a prolonged period of elevated rates or even another hike.\n\nAnother down day for crypto\n\nBitcoin fell 0.95% in the last 24 hours to US$28,551.83 as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, after briefly falling below the $28,500 threshold earlier in the morning. The largest crypto by market capitalization logged a weekly loss of 3.51%, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nEther also lost 1.80% to US$1,794.91 \u2014 below the psychologically important $1,800 level \u2014 for a 3.28% drop in the past seven days.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were down. Dogecoin was the biggest loser among the top 10, dropping 5.01% to US$0.06731 for a weekly loss of 10.07%. Solana followed in terms of losses, dipping 4.25% to US$22.83. The token fell 5.98% in the past week.\n\n\u201cLarger currencies have seen less pressure than smaller altcoins,\u201d wrote Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at London-based online brokerage FxPro, in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cRising U.S. Treasury yields put pressure on riskier assets,\u201d Kuptsikevich explained.\n\nThe losses arrive in the midst of more positive news for the crypto market.\n\nOn Wednesday, Coinbase Global \u2014 the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S. \u2014 announced that it has received approval from the National Futures Association to offer crypto futures to U.S. retail investors. Previously, only institutional customers could trade crypto futures on the platform.\n\nCoinbase called it a \u201cwatershed moment,\u201d celebrating the win despite facing securities violation charges from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nMajor moment for crypto regulatory clarity in the U.S.\n\n\n\nThis has been a multi-year process toward approval, and we're excited to finally be launching federally regulated crypto derivatives with margin to our U.S. customers.\n\n\n\nWhen there is a clear path to register, we do. https://t.co/TxSOAIpoPj \u2014 Brian Armstrong \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f (@brian_armstrong) August 16, 2023\n\n\u201cThey now have an approved, compliant [Futures Commission Merchant status] and they understand the nuances of crypto markets,\u201d wrote Chris Perkins, president and managing partner at New York-based investment advisor CoinFund.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an important step forward in cultivating deep, liquid derivative markets \u2014 which are very much needed. This should be very good for Coinbase, and excellent for crypto markets,\u201d Perkins added.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP token also lost 3.66% to US$0.5862, posting a weekly loss of 8.08%. On July 13, Ripple appeared to score a victory in its ongoing legal battle with the SEC. A New York court ruled that the sale of XRP on public exchanges does not violate securities laws.\n\nHowever, that aspect of the case is again under scrutiny as, on Aug. 9, the SEC asked for a review of the ruling \u2014 contributing to the downward pressure on XRP\u2019s price.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization moved down 1.47% in the past 24 hours to US$1.14 trillion, while trading volume rose 13.64% to US$33.76 billion.\n\nDaily NFT transactions hit historic levels\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.76% in the past 24 hours to 2457.08 as of 08:45 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index shows a 1.23% loss for the week.\n\nForkast\u2019s Ethereum, Solana and Cardano NFT indexes logged losses, while the index for Polygon gained.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume dipped 7.72% in the past 24 hours to US$15.01 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volumes on the Ethereum, Polygon and ImmutableX blockchains logged losses, while volume on Solana and Mythos gained.\n\nOn Wednesday, the total number of global NFT transactions reached a new milestone, marking an all-time high of 617,619, up from 595,209 on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe NFT market is maturing right in front of us and we\u2019re hitting historic levels on a daily basis,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs.\n\n\u201cSales volume isn\u2019t my measure for how healthy the NFT ecosystem is, it\u2019s the buyers, sellers and it\u2019s transactions,\u201d said Petscher. \u201cI am so bullish on NFTs right now.\u201d\n\nMuch of that optimism, Petscher said, is based on a decline in NFT prices, with the average price of a single NFT now US$22.08, down from US37.85 a week earlier.\n\n\u201cAverage sale prices, I want to point out again they continue to decline and that\u2019s a very, very good thing. We want to bring in the masses. We want our friends and families to come into NFTs,\u201d Petscher added.\n\nDMarket, a collection linked to Mythos network-based blockchain games, topped the NFT collections chart by trade volume on CryptoSlam, adding 0.45% to US$970,811.\n\nEthereum-based DeGods came in second despite a 38.75% slump to US$922,882. The collection recently launched its \u201cSeason 3\u201d collection update on Sunday. New-entry The Heist, an NFT collection based on the strategy game of the same name, placed third with a trade volume of US$756,980.\n\nFed minutes signpost potential hikes ahead\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell | Image: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded mixed as of 10:45 a.m. in Hong Kong following a decline across all three major indexes during regular trading Wednesday.\n\nWednesday\u2019s release of the minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s July meeting has put a dampener on investor sentiment. The discussion revealed concerns among Fed members that additional interest rate hikes may be needed to control inflation.\n\nThe minutes stated that \u201cwith inflation still well above the Committee\u2019s longer-run goal and the labor market remaining tight, most participants continued to see significant upside risks to inflation, which could require further tightening of monetary policy.\u201d\n\nFollowing the release of the meeting minutes, analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool gave a 13.5% chance that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in September, up from 9.5% on Wednesday. The Fed meets on Sep. 19 to make its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest level since January 2001.\n\nThe main stock indexes in Asia \u2014 China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 and South Korea\u2019s Kospi \u2014 all posted losses on Thursday morning, echoing bearish sentiment in the U.S.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite fell 0.15% to around 3,145, its lowest level since early January. That reading combined with weak economic data and the nation\u2019s ongoing property sector debt crisis points to a downturn in the Chinese economy.\n\n\u201cProlonged weakness in property construction will add to destocking pressures in the industrial space and depress consumption demand as well,\u201d said Tao Wang, economist at UBS Investment Bank, according to Reuters.\n\n\u201cIn such a case, economic momentum may stay subdued in the rest of the year and China may miss this year\u2019s growth target of around 5%,\u201d Wang added.\n\nChina has also stopped releasing youth unemployment data after the figure hit a record high of 21.3% in June. The suspension follows a string of downbeat economic reports in China, including retail sales and industrial output, raising fears about a slide into recession.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. retail giant Target reported a slump in quarterly revenue. The US$24.77 billion in Q2 was lower than the estimated US$25.16 billion. However, Target shares still added 2.96% on Wednesday.\n\nMajor U.S. retailer Walmart is set to release its quarterly results on Thursday.\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"

The 90-day volatility indexes for Bitcoin and Ethereum have fallen to multi-year lows, falling by 35% and 37%, respectively, according to latest Open in a new tab from Kaiko research. As a result, compared to oil, which has a 41% volatility rate, these top cryptocurrencies are now less volatile.\n\nThe frequency and magnitude of price movements over time are indicated by market volatility. In the past, cryptocurrencies have been more volatile than oil, as seen by their bigger and more frequent price fluctuations.\n\nDespite the fact that oil currently dominates the Nasdaq and gold in terms of volatility, it has actually fallen from a volatility rate of 63% in July 2022. Increased geopolitical tensions and China's underwhelming economic rebound following the relaxation of Covid-19 limitations may be to blame for this drop in oil's volatility.\n\nKaiko's research also highlights that both Bitcoin and Ethereum are currently experiencing multi-year lows in terms of liquidity and trade volume, which could contribute to their decreased volatility.\n\nThe anticipated launch of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) for Bitcoin may stir up market volatility once again. This gained credibility in the wake of BlackRock's unexpected ETF application, given the firm's track record of successful applications and the subsequent actions of other applicants."

You have some charts for us, talk to me about what's happening. Yeah. Uh we're, we're seeing right now is, is kind of, it's interesting we're seeing the leverage funds are basically hedge funds um and hedge funds CTAs uh things like that. There, there's, there's been an increase in the amount of say short contracts relative to long contracts that they have outstanding uh in the futures markets. Uh We're seeing that that spread wide and it's the widest it's been in over a year. Uh interesting also to note that asset managers on the other hand, are taking the opposite side. Those are kind of the long term people, et cetera, those guys are mostly long. Um And that that's been spiked up uh since about uh the, you know, the 22 or so, it's late 21 early 22. Um But again, it it, it's just sort of, you know, we're looking at this and saying, ok, well, uh, you know, how are hedge funds doing it and why part of the thing could be that they are looking at it, um, uh, potentially as a hedge if they, if they have any, um, if they have any long positions as a, you know, kind of to offset it. But really, they could also just be super short. Um, so, you know, again, it's something to, to keep in mind, uh, that there could be a bit of short interest right now, uh, in the, in the hedge fund community. When it comes to Bitcoin, they are involved in it but not in a good way. Uh, and we're also seeing just a slight uptick in, in open interest in general. But, uh, again, it's, uh, you know, it still very quiet market. All right, let's, let's take a look at this. Uh, next chart here, Wednesday was a big day with nearly every sector in crypto suffering a sell off. What was going on there? Could this be, um, in anticipation of the Fed's new policies? That's a great question. Uh, you know, this, of course, is something that, um, you know, we, we're seeing some issues whether or not the fed is going to raise rates and, and we know that the, that the fed has, um, the, the, the market's been betting that the fed is doing one and done but recently the notes, the minutes, the fed minutes came out. And I said, well, you know, there might be some room for an extra rate hike or so another 25 basis points. And in general, for the market, we're seeing this sort of nervousness skittishness. We're seeing if you were to look at, uh, the yield curve right now, it just bumped up a little bit. Um, you know, I, everything's kind of rates have gone up in the past couple of days. People are saying, wait, hold on, this could actually be real. And of course, when you raise rates, uh that creates AAA disincentive to take on a risk because you now have a slightly higher, higher hurdle rate, a slightly higher borrowing costs to take leverage positions, etcetera. Uh Even though people say, well, that doesn't necessarily affect crypto. Yes, it does. So, um you have this uh a little bit of nervousness in, in taking on those risks and some of the, some of the sectors that the more um the more adventurous sectors such as uh gaming and uh you know, metaverse stock, uh metaverse, not stocks, although Gary would say that they're secure securities, but tokens are taking a hit again, that the, the, you know, the more risk involved, uh the, the least, the least likely people are to want to hold them compared to other things. All right. On that note, let's talk about the D sector at the beginning of the show. We saw that coin desks D I index is down, we spoke to the Shebaa Metaverse Advisor. The ship Token is down this morning but not all D five Tokens are down. There was one big major um performer talk to us about that. Yeah, thank you. That's a fantastic question. And I, I really, I'm surprised you asked about this. Um So uh we, we have this, uh of course, this is, you know, 11 thing that didn't go up, I should say is, um, is, is, uh, is curve and you, you would have thought curve would have gone up because somebody, I, the, the thieves are, I don't wanna say thieves, I it's such a, the hackers that plundered curve, uh, gave most of their, their curve token back and you think, OK, everything's fine that, you know, that should calm things down. Nope, it did not. But that, that upward to the right thing that you see there, that's store chain that's room. Uh, so there was a lot of hype with this one involving a, a new lending product that they're gonna launch and, oh, it's gonna be great and no fees and this and that. And then, yeah, Wednesday came and unfortunately for them, it looks like, um, they might have some problems here, uh, with some of the coding issues, uh, in Thor Chain, uh, that led to some suspension of some of the services involved there. So, what we could have is that's not going to be that, that this chart won't look the same, let's just say next week because, um, you know, it, it, that might just puncture a hole if you will in Thor Chain, it might make people a little bit nervous. So, while Thor Chain was the big talk of, of uh D I this past week, um, it might be this coming week, but for other reasons, we'll see, we'll see how that goes. We'll see uh what, what comes out of this. But uh you know, again, this is it, you have to remember. This is a relatively small, uh a, a small market when it comes to uh defy tokens and it's relatively small even even in crypto, uh even when it compared to say Bitcoin and E um so you get a lot more volatility, you get a lot more uh ups and downs and, and you get a lot more excitement and buzz. But, you know, one little thing like we saw with curve can blow things up uh in, in a bad way. So, uh buyer beware. So basically, don't go put all your bets on Thor chain just I bet that's it."

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap could rocket to a new record high next year if regulators approve the first ever US spot bitcoin ETF, according to Fundstrat's Tom Lee.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC Wednesday, the strategist broke down why a six-figure jump above the previous record high of $69,000 remains in the cards.\n\n\"If the spot bitcoin gets approved, I think the demand will be greater than the daily supply for bitcoin,\" Lee said. \"The clearing price...is over $150,000, it could even be $180,000.\"\n\nThe Jacobi Bitcoin ETF went live Tuesday in Europe under the ticker BCOIN, but regulators in the US have yet to approve applications for similar funds from asset managers including BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLee maintained that even if the spot ETF is not approved, upside remains because of next year's bitcoin halving event, which will reduce the number of bitcoins awarded to miners by half.\n\nDuring the next halving process, miners' rewards will be reduced from 6.25 bitcoin to 3.125 bitcoin per block, creating a scarcity effect, according to the original whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto. Each of the past three halvings have correlated with new record highs within 12 months.\n\nThe halving on its own could send bitcoin's price up sharply, but Lee said it wouldn't make a six-figure leap without the regulatory approval of the spot ETF in the US.\n\nSeparately, he noted that easing macro conditions and Fed policy creates a bullish setup for cryptocurrency across the board.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Crypto is dependent on monetary policy, so if inflation is cooling, then we can start to bet on forward financial conditions easing and central bank easing sooner,\" Lee said. \"That's bullish for crypto or alternative assets.\"\n\nAs far as traditional assets go, the Fundstrat chief reiterated his call for a new all-time high in the S&P 500 before the end of the year. Even if equities fall 5%-8% in August, there's still $5.5 trillion in cash on the sidelines waiting to enter the market, he said.\n\n\"I think you have an earnings recovery, the Fed may be slowing, interest rates could stabilize and then the cash gets put to work,\" Lee said."

        "content": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has jumped to a fresh high in Argentina since the news that Bitcoin-friendly presidential candidate Javier Milei won a primary election on Aug. 13, with 1 BTC reaching a value of 10 million Argentine pesos (ARS) on Aug. 14, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nIn Argentina, Bitcoin has seen a sharp climb this week, with BTC rallying 21% from 8.4 million ARS to 10.2 million ARS in less than one hour on Monday.\n\nWhile the 10 million pesos mark is widely seen as the \u201cofficial\u201d Bitcoin\u2019s value, the Argentine parallel market, sometimes referred to as the \u201creal value\u201d market, is even higher than that.\n\nAccording to the local cryptocurrency data source CoinMonitor Argentina, the price of Bitcoin surged to as high as 20.3 million ARS per coin on Aug. 16. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at the average of 19.3 million ARS, according to CoinMonitor data, while CoinGecko suggests that its \u201cofficial\u201d value is just 9.2 million ARS.\n\nBitcoin versus the Argentine peso seven-day price chart. Source: CoinGecko\n\nThe latest Bitcoin price gains in Argentina build on significant previous growth versus the Argentine peso amid the ongoing massive inflation and devaluation of the local fiat currency.\n\nThe monthly inflation rate in Argentina surged to 6.3% in July, while Argentina's central bank devalued ARS by to about 18% in the aftermath of Sunday's primaries. According to local sources, the central bank devalued ARS\u2019 official exchange rate by as much as 22% and plans to keep the rate fixed at $350 until presidential elections in October.\n\nAmid the prolonged inflation and currency devaluation, Bitcoin has been steadily gaining value against ARS since late 2022. According to CoinGecko, Bitcoin has surged more than 210% versus the Argentine peso since Aug. 17, 2022.\n\nThe most recent Bitcoin rally in Argentina came amid the presidential primary win by pro-Bitcoin presidential candidate Milei. After winning the primary with more than 30% of votes, Milei is now the front-runner in Argentina\u2019s general election in October.\n\nRelated: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. vows to back US dollar with Bitcoin if elected president\n\nAs previously reported, Milei wants to abolish the central bank and adopt the United States dollar as Argentina\u2019s currency. The presidential candidate also believes that Bitcoin is a reaction against \u201ccentral bank scammers,\u201d while fiat currency allows politicians to scam Argentines with inflation.\n\nArgentine pro-Bitcoin presidential candidate Javier Milei. Source: El Pa\u00eds\n\nWhile Bitcoin has been at its record highs in Argentina recently, the cryptocurrency has been on the decline in global markets.\n\nSince Aug. 14, Bitcoin has lost 3.7% of its value versus the U.S. dollar, dropping below the psychological mark of $29,000 on Aug. 16, according to CoinGecko. The cryptocurrency has been gradually tumbling over the past 30 days, dropping nearly 5% over the period at the time of writing.\n\nBitcoin versus USD seven-day price chart.

        "content": "A Bitcoin (BTC) wallet containing 1,005 BTC mined in 2010 has reawakened, with an anonymous user moving the long dormant coins to new addresses in a number of different transactions.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Cointelegraph, Kirill Kretov \u2014 a blockchain researcher, developer and cryptocurrency trader \u2014 weighed in on the event after initially flagging the movement of the BTC, which was mined just a year after Bitcoin\u2019s inception.\n\nCointelegraph independently verified the details of the wallet using blockchain data from Blockchair. According to the wallet statement, the 1,005 BTC was valued at just $328 when it was received in 2010. The coins were valued at over $29 million at the time of publication.\n\nThe wider cryptocurrency community also took note of the BTC awakening, with some questioning whether Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, was moving coins:\n\nLooks like Satoshi is back! I can bet this wallet is owned by Satoshi Nakamoto himself. \u2014 The Wise Guy (@wiseguyhoshi) August 16, 2023\n\nKretov told Cointelegraph it was unlikely that Bitcoin\u2019s creator was quietly moving virgin BTC, suggesting that a long-term holder or entity associated with previous dormant Bitcoin awakenings was behind the transaction. The researcher added that the holder could be selling Bitcoin in an over-the-counter transaction:\n\n\u201cI may expect the price to be higher than the current market because these are 100% clean Bitcoins. Not to mention how old they are, which makes them especially attractive to crypto-numismatics.\u201d\n\nKretov believes that the wallet could be controlled by the same user that had previously moved Bitcoin from wallets in 13 different instances between 2020 and 2021. According to the researcher, this involved 13 awakenings, each of 1,000 BTC (from 20 wallets containing 50 mined BTC), amounting to 13,000 BTC.\n\nKretov also noted that his research archives, which monitor a large number of virgin Bitcoin wallets in the immediate years after Bitcoin\u2019s inception, have only flagged three other awakenings of 1,000 BTC or more.\n\nThis included a first instance, where 1,000 BTC from two wallets mined in 2011 was moved in December 2021. In April 2023, 1,000 BTC mined in 2011 was moved from a single wallet before another 1,037 BTC was moved in July 2023 from a wallet dating back to 2012\n\n\u201cThose BTC are from 2011 and 2012, and the sources of funds are different \u2014 not freshly mined coins. So the present awakening is much closer to those 13 instances.\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph recently reported, another dormant BTC wallet holding over 1,037 coins transferred its funds to a new address. The BTC had been obtained in April 2012 at an estimated value of $5,100, while its total value when it was moved in 2023 was around $31 million.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: The value of a legacy: Hunting down Satoshi\u2019s Bitcoin"

        "content": "In the latest episode of Cointelegraph\u2019s The Market Report, analyst Marcel Pechman discusses the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approved in the European Union, which went live on the Euronext Amsterdam exchange on Aug. 15. Despite the seemingly unconventional choice of the Guernsey regulator for its constitution, the fund\u2019s listing on Euronext suggests a strategic maneuver, though its meager 1 million euro launch and unfamiliar management casts a shadow over its appeal.\n\nMoving on, Pechman shifts focus to the United States Bitcoin ETF landscape, where the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has once again delayed its decision on approving a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF, setting a potential deadline for early 2024. This recurrent cycle of postponements echoes the challenges faced over the past decade.\n\nThe lack of regulatory clarity in the U.S. cryptocurrency market underscores the SEC\u2019s reluctance to endorse a spot crypto ETF.\n\nPechman also discusses Bitcoin\u2019s price trajectory. According to Bitcoin investor Jesse Myers, breaking the $100,000 barrier is intricately tied to the block subsidy halving in mid-2024. Myers challenges the efficient market hypothesis, positing that the market will take 12 to 18 months post-halving to fully assimilate the implications.\n\nPechman conveys skepticism about predicting market outcomes, acknowledging many factors that can sway Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory, including Federal Reserve decisions, banking liquidity, economic conditions and unforeseen events.\n\nPechman concludes by circling back to the primary drivers of Bitcoin\u2019s value: the abundance of fiat currency and government debt. He foresees Bitcoin surpassing $100,000, but the real-world purchasing power of that sum might be diminished due to inflation.\n\nListen to the full episode of The Market Report on the new Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel, and don\u2019t forget to click \u201cLike\u201d and \u201cSubscribe\u201d to keep up-to-date with all our latest content."

The massive rally of the bond has now drawn interest from several institutional giants, including JP Morgan, Eaton Vance and PGIM Fixed, prompting President Nayib Bukele to say, \u201cI told you so.\u201d\n\nApart from the institutional giants, the likes of Lord Abbett & Co LLC, Neuberger Berman Group LLC and UBS Group AG have also added debt security since April, reported Bloomberg.\n\nPaolo Ardoino, chief technology officer of Bitfinex, told Cointelegraph that the performance of El Salvador bonds is a clear signal that investors are supportive of the financial policies of the El Salvador government and demonstrates the renewed interest in investing in the El Salvador story while adding:\n\n\u201cAs the first company to receive a Digital Asset Licence, we are seeing significant interest in digital asset issuance and renewable energy investments, which the country has in abundance and is being used for Bitcoin mining and to provide more energy for the country\u2019s electrical grid.\u201d\n\nThe growing demand for El Salvador\u2019s debt security in 2023 is quite a contrast to its performance a couple of years ago when it first adopted Bitcoin as a legal tender. The BTC adoption created uncertainty among investors who bet against the country\u2019s bonds, with several financial agencies casting a shadow of doubt on the country\u2019s financial future.\n\nIn February 2022, the American credit rating agency Fitch lowered the country\u2019s long-term Issuer Default Rating from B- to CCC, citing policy uncertainty and the Bitcoin adoption, along with an $800-million debt payment due for January 2023.\n\nRelated: El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin strategy evolved with the bear market in 2022\n\nEl Salvador paid $800 million in debt in full within the due maturing time at the start of this year, raising confidence in the country\u2019s bonds again. President Nayib Bukele at the time noted that they have proven every finance pundit wrong who doubted whether they would be able to pay their debts in time after Bitcoin adoption.\n\nIn the past year, almost every legacy international news outlet said that because of our \u201c#Bitcoin bet\u201d, El Salvador was going to default on its debt by January 2023 (since we had an 800 million dollar bond maturing today).\n\n\n\nLiterally, hundreds of articles https://t.co/rEiK7K13U4 \u2014 Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) January 24, 2023\n\nThis rise in the confidence of investors is visible from the bond\u2019s performance throughout 2023. During the same time frame, El Salvador also passed a landmark crypto bill, paving the way for a Bitcoin-backed Volcano bond.\n\nEl Salvador bond performance 2018-2023. Source: Bloomberg\n\nEl Salvador and its president have been at the receiving end of criticism ever since they first adopted Bitcoin in September 2021 as legal tender along with the United States dollar. Financial pundits predicted that the BTC adoption will further strain Salvador\u2019s financial conditions. However, within two years, the debt security of the state has become a hotcake among institutional giants, the same that once advised against its buying.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: What it\u2019s actually like to use Bitcoin in El Salvador"

        "title": "Over $1 billion in crypto market liquidations as Bitcoin hits 2-month low - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "After bottoming out at a two-month low of around US$25,400, Bitcoin recovered some losses on Friday morning in Asia to trade around US$26,800. Ether also fell dramatically to a low of around US$1,550 before rebounding to just under the US$1,700 line. All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptos logged losses as macroeconomic factors \u2014 including the depreciation of the Chinese yuan and the bankruptcy of Chinese property giant Evergrande \u2014 hit investor sentiment. Overall, investors liquidated US$1 billion in cryptocurrencies, driving the total market capitalization to the edge of the psychologically important US$1 trillion threshold.\n\nXRP led the losers, after a U.S. judge granted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval to file a motion to appeal the recent favorable ruling for Ripple Labs regarding retail sales of token XRP. Meanwhile, the Forkast 500 NFT index dropped but a rise in transactions continued. U.S. stock futures steadied after Wall Street closed lower on Thursday. The release of minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s July meeting continues to fuel concerns of more monetary tightening ahead\n\nBitcoin, Ether slide after giving up key support levels\n\nBitcoin slid 7.02% in the last 24 hours to US$26,819.27 as of 07:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, logging a weekly loss of 8.88%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency hit a two-month low of US$25,409.11 on early Friday morning.\n\n\u201cDuring late US / early Asia trading volumes, Bitcoin prices broke the critical support level at US$28,000. We knew a crash (or sharp decline) could be coming,\u201d Markus Thielen, head of crypto research at digital asset service platform Matrixport, wrote in an emailed note.\n\n\u201cRealized volatility had hit 18%; the last time volatility was this low, in November 2018, Bitcoin\u2019s 30-day realized volatility spiked to over 100% as prices crashed by 46%. In Bitcoin, sharp price declines have often followed low volatility periods. We are not predicting such a significant decline but expected, at least, a -13% decline (so far, prices are down -10%).\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThere is also the looming shadow of macro risks to consider, added Thielen.\n\n\u201cThe biggest is a potential devaluation of the Chinese Yuan, trading at the weakest level since 2007. In August 2015, when China devalued the Yuan for the last time, Bitcoin prices declined by -23% during the two weeks following the devaluation,\u201d he said.\n\nAdding to the bearish sentiment in Bitcoin, a Friday report by The Wall Street Journal showed Elon Musk-founded rocket company SpaceX wrote down the value of its Bitcoin holdings by a total of US$373 million in the past two years.\n\n\u201cThis is really a past event (but) it is still news and investors understandably saw this as a bearish catalysis on top of macro moves,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of APAC business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, Ether dropped 5.64% to US$1,706.22 and lost 7.80% for the past seven days, after reaching a five-month low of US$1,551.71 on early Friday morning.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies all traded lower.\n\nCryptocurrencies saw a total liquidation of US$1 billion over the past 12 hours, with US$812.67 million of long positions \u2014 positions where investors bet the cryptocurrency price will rise \u2014 wiped out, according to data from crypto information platform CoinGlass.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP token led the losers, plunging 12.52% to US$0.5136 for a weekly loss of 18.85%.\n\nIn the on-going legal battle between Ripple Labs and the SEC, Judge Analisa Torres on Thursday granted the SEC\u2019s request to appeal an earlier summary judgement in favor of Ripple.\n\nIn June, Torres ruled that Ripple\u2019s programmatic sales of XRP did not violate securities laws, while its sales to institutional investors did. The ruling was seen as a partial victory notched by Ripple. The SEC first sued the company in December 2020 for offering unregistered digital asset securities \u2014 an allegation Ripple denies.\n\n\u201cThe request for appeal (even if granted) doesn\u2019t change the fact that XRP is not a security. That\u2019s not up for debate / trial,\u201d said Ripple Chief Executive Officer Brad Garlinghouse in a tweet on Wednesday.\n\nReminder \u2013 the request for appeal (even if granted) doesn\u2019t change the fact that XRP is not a security. That\u2019s not up for debate / trial. But the SEC continues to claim that Chris and I acted recklessly in believing that XRP is not a security. That\u2019s utter nonsense. 1/2 https://t.co/pG7z0jsjlt \u2014 Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) August 16, 2023\n\nAccording to Thursday\u2019s court filing, the SEC will file a motion for appeal on Friday, and Ripple has until September 1 to file its opposition papers.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dropped 5.69% in the past 24 hours to US$1.07 trillion \u2014 close to the psychologically important US$1 trillion threshold \u2014 while trading volume surged 78.91% to US$60.58 billion.\n\nA bad day for NFTs despite all time transactions high\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 0.37% in the past 24 hours to 2,445.03 as of 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, and fell 2.28% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum and Solana NFT indexes logged gains, while the indexes for Polygon and Cardano dropped.\n\nWreck League, an NFT video game backed by Hong Kong-based gaming company Animoca Brands, launched its NFT mint on early Friday in Asia. But the collection has unperformed, struggling to sell more than a third of its offerings so far.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a good day for NFTs,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs. \u201cIf anyone is wondering if traders are out of liquidity or conviction in the space, this just might be the answer.\u201d\n\nThe collection\u2019s struggles will impact on the wider market, Petscher added, as traders will look at Wreck League and lose confidence in other collections\u2019 ability to sell.\n\nDespite Wreck League\u2019s struggles, total NFT trading volume rose 30.97% in the past 24 hours to over US$18.69 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volumes on the Ethereum and BNB Chain rose, while Solana, Polygon, and Cardano blockchains posted declines.\n\nDaily NFT transactions on Thursday surpassed Wednesday\u2019s record to hit another all-time-high of over 649,000. Those totals eclipsed the previous high of 595,000 logged on Feb. 25, 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, the average NFT sales price stood at US$26.26, about one tenth of the average price for NFTs on Feb. 25, 2022. That crop signals \u201ca major change in the NFT ecosystem,\u201d according to Petscher.\n\n\u201cThe NFT space is in the midst of having a shift in its identity, moving to high volume, low dollar sales, and this is exactly what will eventually lead NFTs to mass adoption,\u201d said Petscher.\n\n\u201cWill this be enough to start attracting mainstream attention though? I think not quite yet, but we\u2019re getting much closer to that with realistic prices and recognizable brands,\u201d he added.\n\nDespite the rise in transactions, NFT sellers lost over US$1.91 million in Thursday trading, the biggest loss since July 20.\n\nAs NFTs attract more institutional interest, McDonald\u2019s Corporation\u2019s Singapore branch has teamed up with local entertainment company Bandwagon Labs for an NFT project based on the fast food chain\u2019s Grimace character.\n\nAnd it's live! #GRIMACE, a classic McDonaldland character brought into the modern world of digital collectibles.

Stay tuned for the mint! \u26a1\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/Z5U5T2sE8Z \u2014 Bandwagon Labs (@BandwagonLabs) August 17, 2023\n\nThe mint of 2,000 Grimace-themed NFTs will go live on August 21. The NFTs are free to claim using the McDonald\u2019s mobile app in Singapore, but cannot then be transferred to other wallets.\n\nAmong NFT collections, Ethereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club saw the largest 24-hour sales volume. The collection surged 367.71% to over US$2.22 million as its floor price dropped 11% in the past seven days.\n\nEthereum-based DeGods and Mythos Chain-based DMarket took the second and third places in terms of daily sales volumes.\n\nUS rate hike murmurs as China strife deepens\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures traded mixed as of 2:00 p.m. in Hong Kong with the Dow up and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq logging gains. All three major U.S. indexes closed lower at close of trading on Thursday.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes moved down on Friday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei all logged losses.\n\nIn the U.S., jobless claims fell 4.4% to 239,000 for the week ending August 12. The weekly figure is lower than economist expectations, pointing to a consistently tight labor market. That could open the door to further interest rate hikes.\n\n\u201cThe labor markets are not imploding,\u201d Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at financial market research firm FWDBONDS, told Reuters. \u201cThe economy may be heating up instead of cooling down as the monetary medicine of higher 5.5% interest rates is not slowing aggregate demand like the economics textbooks say it should.\u201d\n\nThe hot labor market data arrived after the U.S. Federal Reserve released its July meeting minutes on Wednesday.\n\nThe minutes show that \u201cmost participants continued to see significant upside risks to inflation, which could require further tightening of monetary policy.\u201d Two participants indicated they \u201cfavored leaving the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged or that they could have supported such a proposal.\u201d\n\nThe Fed meets on Sep. 19 to make its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest level in the past 22 years. Analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predict a 88.5% chance there will be no interest rate hike in September, and a 11.5% chance for another 25-basis-point increase.\n\nMeanwhile, China Evergrande Group filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in a U.S. bankruptcy court on Thursday. The Chinese real estate developer first defaulted on U.S. dollar bond repayments in December 2021 amid China\u2019s property debt crisis.\n\nBeyond the ailing property industry, Chinese authorities reportedly told state-owned banks to ramp up currency market intervention this week. That followed a slide in the value of offshore Chinese yuan to below 7.30 per U.S. dollar on Wednesday \u2014 the lowest level since November 2022.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of uncertainty about the Chinese economy,\u201d Hebe Chen, analyst at London-based online trading provider IG Markets, told Bloomberg. \u201cThe market is now standing at a crossroads about whether or not we can continue to talk about the Chinese recovery story or should we shift the narrative to China slowing down or even entering a recession.\u201d\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"

        "title": "Bitcoin price breaks from range with drop below $28K, and options tilt toward BTC bears - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "On Aug. 16, Bitcoin closed below $29,000 for the first time in 56 days. Analysts quickly pointed to this week\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee minutes, which expressed concerns about inflation and the need to increase interest rates, as the likely cause.\n\nDespite the immediate reasons for the drop, the upcoming $580 million Bitcoin (BTC) options expiry on Friday favors the bears. They could potentially make a $140 million profit on Aug. 18, adding to the downward pressure on Bitcoin and complicating BTC\u2019s search for a bottom.\n\nFederal Reserve minutes did not impact traditional markets\n\nOn Aug. 16, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the 2% inflation target. This pushed the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield to its highest level since October 2007, prompting investors to shift away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies in favor of cash positions and companies that are well prepared for such a scenario.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin had already fallen to $29,000, its lowest point in nine days, prior to the release of the Fed minutes. The impact of the minutes was limited, especially considering the 10-year yield had been rising, indicating skepticism about the Fed\u2019s ability to control inflation.\n\nAdditionally, on Aug. 17, S&P 500 index futures only dropped by 0.6% compared to their pre-event level on Aug. 16. During the same time, WTI crude oil gained 1.7%, while gold traded down 0.3%.\n\nConcerns about China\u2019s economy might have also contributed to the decline. The country reported lower-than-expected retail sales growth and fixed asset investment, potentially affecting the demand for cryptocurrencies.\n\nAlthough the exact causes of the price drop remain uncertain, there\u2019s a possibility that Bitcoin could reverse its trend after the weekly options expiry on Aug. 18.\n\nBitcoin bulls cast the wrong bet\n\nBetween Aug. 8 and Aug. 9, the price of Bitcoin briefly crossed the $29,700 mark, sparking optimism among traders using options contracts.\n\nDeribit Bitcoin options aggregate open interest for Aug. 18. Source: Deribit\n\nThe 0.57 put-to-call ratio reflects the difference in open interest between the $365 million call (buy) options and the $205 million put (sell) options. However, the outcome will be lower than the $570 million total open interest since the bulls were caught by surprise with the latest price drop below $29,000.\n\nFor example, if Bitcoin\u2019s price trades at $28,400 at 8:00 am UTC on Aug. 18, only $3 million worth of call options will be accounted for. This distinction arises from the fact that the right to purchase Bitcoin at $27,000 or $28,000 becomes invalid if BTC trades below those levels upon expiration.\n\nBelow are the three most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on Aug. 18 for call (buy) and put (sell) instruments varies depending on the expiration price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $26,000 and $28,000: 100 calls vs. 5,300 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $140 million.\n\n100 calls vs. 5,300 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $140 million. Between $28,000 and $28,500: 100 calls vs. 3,900 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $60 million.\n\n100 calls vs. 3,900 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $60 million. Between $28,500 and $29,500: 600 calls vs. 1,300 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $20 million.\n\nGiven the growing concern among investors about an upcoming economic slowdown due to actions taken by central banks to control inflation, it\u2019s likely that Bitcoin bears will maintain their advantage. This trend isn't limited to the upcoming Friday expiry and is expected to continue, especially since the chances of the BTC bulls\u2019 primary short-term goal \u2014 the approval of a spot exchange-traded fund \u2014 are quite slim.\n\nAs a result, those on the bullish side find themselves in a tough spot. The success of their call (buy) options relies on Bitcoin\u2019s expiry price going above $28,500. The most likely scenario, where bears could walk away with a favorable outcome of $140 million, suggests the potential for a further correction in Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "Bitcoin mining researchers claim new tech ups winning hash chance by 260% - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Quantum Blockchain Technologies (QBT) \u2014 a research company based in the United Kingdom \u2014 has developed artificial intelligence (AI)-powered algorithms that could significantly increase the mining winning probability of certain ASIC Bitcoin (BTC) miners, its CEO Francesco Gardin said in an interview with Cointelegraph.\n\nGardin unpacked how QBT has incorporated AI to enable the smart search of winning hashes as an alternative to conventional random searches.\n\nIn two years, the company has developed several different patented methods by tapping into the expertise of some twenty experts from quantum computing, machine learning, cryptography, ASIC chip design and algorithm optimization theory.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin miners still bullish despite toughest bear market yet \u2014 Hut8, Foundry, Braiins\n\nQBT\u2019s machine learning teams have developed two different algorithmic search methods, which reportedly improve the performance of ASIC miners by increasing efficiency and winning result probabilities.\n\n\u201cMethod A\u201d is said to improve miner efficiency by 10% while \u201cMethod B\u201d is set to improve the probability of a miner finding a winning has by 260%.\n\nGardin said that the company is looking to explore three specific areas, starting with a short-term target of increasing the mining performance of existing commercial ASIC chips by adding a software AI component running on a mining rig.\n\nThe team is also designing a new architecture for ASIC mining chips to optimize Bitcoin mining, which it detailed in a recent patent application.\n\nMeanwhile, QBT has a long-term goal of using quantum computers to mine Bitcoin using an in-development SHA-256 computation method that can operate on quantum computing systems.\n\nQBT announced a patent application in July 2023 for the latter, outlining its architectural change to Bitcoin mining ASIC chips, which it claims pre-processes data used by future blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nGardin said the QBT Message Scheduling for Cryptographic Hashing ASIC (MSFCA) is able to perform pre-calculations of future BTC blocks before the current block is closed. The \u201canticipatory resource efficiency algorithm\u201d reduces the logic gates of SHA-256 ASIC architecture.\n\nLogic gates are software or hardware devices that carry out logical operations. According to Gardin, MSFCA allows miners to use fewer logic gates, lowering energy costs and improving the efficiency of ASIC mining hardware.\n\nRelated: Tether\u2019s game plan in El Salvador: Why invest in Volcano Energy?\n\nThe firm estimates that miners could free up to 8% of logic gates of SHA-256 ASIC chips by pre-processing data used by future blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain, which would make certain logic gates involved in the computation of that data no longer necessary on the ASIC chip.\n\nGardin also weighed in on the potential for these new methods to influence the Bitcoin mining industry. He said that BTC mining is highly dependent on hardware configurations and hashing power of miners, as well as expending considerable amounts of energy.\n\nGardin added that the probability of finding the winning hash increases with the number and halving speed of a miners\u2019 fleet or an entire pool, as well as the corresponding energy cost while conducting a \u201ccompletely random search.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are no methods, intelligence or strategy in current BTC mining, but simply brute force and luck.\u201d\n\nAlthough just a handful of ASIC manufacturers dominate the mining rigs market, Gardin believes there are minimal differences, features or distinct advances between hardware, aside from differences in hash rates and power consumption.\n\nHe added that QBT\u2019s technology, which was mainly developed using Intel\u2019s Blockscale ASIC chips \u2014 which were recently pulled from production \u2014 would provide advantages to any mining rig.\n\nThe firm\u2019s technologies are being touted to give an \u201cuncatchable advantage\u201d using AI and SHA-256 optimization, and while QBT does not plan to open source its patented methods, Gardin said QBT is considering different options to take its solutions to the Bitcoin mining market.\n\nThis could include subscription, licensing, forming a joint venture, or outright purchasing the company and its associated technologies.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with \u2018Net Zero\u2019 promises"

This period of low volatility some might call apathy has caused many guessing, have we seen the end of the uptrend?\n\nEven though the price decrease was seen, overall it is still in an uptrend. But this lack of interest may be making some investors nervous. That isn\u2019t the case with short-term holders. As per Glassnode video report , short-term holders aren\u2019t interested in selling their Bitcoin.\n\nSince the one cohort we could expect to see some immediate action is being inactive, does that mean Bitcoin will maintain trading above $28,000?\n\nShort-Term Holders Aren\u2019t Selling\n\nSell-side Risk Ration for Short-term holders is a metric that describes spot market value (realized profit + realized loss) divided by the realized cap, or in other words, how much the value changed versus the size of the asset, in this case, Bitcoin among short-term holders (less than five months).\n\nA high value indicates an increase in value change \u2013 usually seen in profit-taking or capitulation events. Low values mean that the value change is small and usually happens right before a large move.\n\nAs this metric fell to its all-time low, it means that short-term holders are sitting around the breakeven price \u2013 the price they bought Bitcoin, and aren\u2019t willing to sell. This can be interpreted as a sign that they are offering the price its needed support around the current levels of $28,400.\n\nShort-term holders are considered an active cohort, more sensitive to smaller price changes. The chart above shows that they are not considering selling their Bitcoin just yet, even though the previous uptrend has been extinguished.\n\nThe conclusion here can be drawn that they are sitting on the sidelines and waiting for the price to exit the range on either side to take measures \u2013 sell at a loss or sell at a profit.\n\nBitcoin Struggles Above $28,000\n\nAs stated at the beginning of the article, Bitcoin\u2019s price reached a similar high level in July as it did in April \u2013 $31,000. We have seen a pullback, but according to the chart analysis, there are reasons to believe that it will stay above $28,000.\n\nFirst, we see that the price currently interacts with the intersection between two support \u2013 the horizontal one and the ascending one. In particular, the ascending one is the more reliable one, dating from January 1, and was respected on two more occasions.\n\nSecond, the RSI on the daily chart shows that Bitcoin is close to the oversold zone, currently sitting at 34.5%. In comparison, it was on the same levels as on June 15 when the previous rise started.\n\nThird, the Elliott Wave count points out that the price hasn\u2019t finished its five-wave impulse and that another higher high is to be expected. It is still unclear where this high can end, but the next significant resistance zone is at $37,500, where our first expected stopping point\n\nConclusion\n\nEven though the price of Bitcoin has been struggling to keep up its bullish momentum, short-term holders aren\u2019t selling just yet. Chart analysis shows that the price is likely to hold above $28,000 which is its current significant support point.\n\nIf the price breaks the level and short-term holders start selling at a loss, the price could go into a higher degree downtrend and spark an even large descending move.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin continued its crash Thursday afternoon, shedding 7% of its value in 20 minutes and briefly dipping below $26,000 in the process. And as Bitcoin went, so too did other leading cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum\u2014with a cascade of liquidations topping $800 million to follow.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market cap is trading for $26,314 as of this writing, according to CoinGecko\u2014a nearly 10% dive for Bitcoin over the last 24 hours. It fell as low as $25,649 this afternoon, but has rebounded slightly since then. The price of Bitcoin hasn't been this low since the start of June.\n\nBitcoin's dive Thursday followed word of China's sizable Evergrande Group property developer filing for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in New York. Around the same time, word began to spread about a Wall Street Journal report noting that Elon Musk's SpaceX wrote down the value of its Bitcoin holdings by $373 million and sold an unspecified amount.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe rest of the crypto market was in the red Thursday afternoon Eastern Time, too. Ethereum, the second largest digital asset by market cap, is down nearly 10% in the last day, trading hands for $1,640 as of this writing. It fell as low as $1,576 on Thursday afternoon, per CoinGecko.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies like Ripple (XRP), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Litecoin (LTC) are all down at least 14% over the past day. All three had seen significant upward price movement in recent weeks.\n\nAccording to data from Coinglass, the crashing prices across the board triggered a cascade of liquidations for overleveraged positions, with $801 million worth of liquidations tallied in the hour after the price started dropping.\n\nBitcoin had recently been on a run after a surge of interest from institutional investors\u2014including an application from BlackRock for a spot crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF)\u2014helped propel the biggest and oldest digital asset to a yearly high above $31,000 per coin.\n\nBut interest may be waning as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) does not appear to be in a hurry to approve the long list of high-profile applications. Investors appear eager for a Bitcoin ETF, but regulators have been slow to approve one. Such an investment vehicle does not yet exist in the U.S.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "Quantum Computing Could Threaten Blockchain, Crypto - Bloomberg Law",
        "content": "Quantum computers have the potential to break the most advanced cryptographic protocols\u2014including those used for blockchain protocols\u2014in operation today. This is because quantum computers, which rely on principles of quantum mechanics, can in theory complete certain computationally intensive operations that would take today\u2019s classical computers an extraordinary amount of time.\n\nA quantum computer works by using quantum bits, or qubits. In contrast to traditional binary bits, which can only be either 0 or 1, qubits can be a combination of 0 and 1 at the same time. This property of qubits, known as superposition, enables quantum computers to perform multiple calculations in parallel. Additionally, a phenomenon known as entanglement allows two qubits to be linked in such a manner that the state of one qubit affects the state of the other, regardless of the physical distance between them. This effect, combined with superposition, allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations even faster.\n\nBut today\u2019s quantum computers are finicky and of limited utility. They\u2019re susceptible to the slightest environmental interference\u2014such as the Earth\u2019s magnetic field, local radiation, and even cosmic rays\u2014which make calculations performed by current quantum computers error-prone. Because of these technical and operational challenges, quantum computers are currently accessible to only a small handful of companies and researchers, and it may take a decade or more for quantum computers to impact current cryptographic protocols.\n\nHowever, recent research suggests that this inflection point may come sooner than anticipated. A June 2023 paper by IBM and UC Berkeley researchers demonstrated that even noisy, error-prone quantum computers can provide utility beyond what\u2019s capable of today\u2019s classical computers.\n\nThis potentially accelerated timeline could have far-reaching consequences, including for many cryptocurrencies and their underlying blockchain protocols, as the cryptographic functions and encryption standards they rely on could soon be vulnerable to quantum attacks.\n\nFor example, cryptocurrency miners using quantum computers may be able to mine cryptocurrency much faster than other miners. This could threaten the decentralization of many mining-based blockchain protocols. Quantum computers could also decrypt the private key from a public key, enabling bad actors to control, and ultimately steal, others\u2019 cryptocurrencies.\n\nQuantum computers thus could pose a significant threat to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. In response, some developers are already working to future-proof their blockchain protocol by exploring ways to transition the cryptography currently securing the protocol to quantum-resistant cryptography.\n\nInvestors, users, and regulators must carefully consider the potential risks quantum computers pose to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology more generally.\n\nDisruption of Cryptocurrency Mining\n\nMany of the world\u2019s most popular and widely used cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, rely on proof-of-workmining to secure the underlying blockchain protocol. A PoW blockchain protocol requires network participants known as miners to compete with each other to be the first to solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate new transactions on the blockchain. The winner of the mining competition is rewarded with cryptocurrency\u2014known as block rewards.\n\nA quantum computer eventually could solve mining puzzles much faster than current-generation mining devices, allowing those with access to quantum computers to amass mining rewards and control the transaction validation process by taking over a majority of the network\u2019s computing power. This is known as a 51% attack. Researchers have suggested that 51% attacks on bitcoin by quantum computers may not be possible until 2028 at the earliest though,recent evidence indicates it could happen sooner.\n\nDecryption and Theft of Private Keys\n\nQuantum computers capable of breaking modern cryptography may also enable bad actors to control and steal other people\u2019s cryptocurrency. Specifically, future quantum computers in the future could ascertain cryptocurrency private keys from their corresponding public addresses, as private keys are encrypted using what are known as digital signature schemes based on modern cryptographic protocols. This would be akin to a hacker gaining access to a victim\u2019s email password based on the publicly available username or email address.\n\nResearchers generally believe that this type of security threat to public blockchain protocols is more likely to be technologically feasible than a quantum attack on the cryptocurrency mining process due to fundamental differences in the algorithms that would be used to carry out the attacks.\n\nRisks and Potential Consequences\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market capitalization stands at over $1.15 trillion. Cryptocurrencies are an ever-growing and integral part of investment portfolios of both retail and institutional investors across the globe. Although not an immediate threat, quantum computers could soon pose significant and material risks to this burgeoning and resilient asset class.\n\nAs such, there may be certain circumstances where various entities, including asset managers and public companies, may want to consider publicly disclosing the impact quantum computers could have on cryptocurrency investments or investment strategies involving cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis article does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg Industry Group, Inc., the publisher of Bloomberg Law and Bloomberg Tax, or its owners.\n\nAuthor Information\n\nDaniel Davis is partner and co-chair in Katten\u2019s financial markets and regulation practice.\n\nAlexander Kim is an associate in Katten\u2019s financial markets and regulation practice.\n\nWrite for Us: Author Guidelines"

        "content": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC) will surge past an eye-watering $150,000 by the end of 2024, as long as the current slew of United States spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are approved, according to investment research boutique Fundstrat.\n\nIn an Aug. 16 interview on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box, Fundstrat\u2019s managing partner and head of research, Tom Lee, predicted that a bundle of successful Bitcoin spot ETF applications would shift Bitcoin\u2019s supply-demand dynamics towards considerable price appreciation.\n\nWhen asked what the price of Bitcoin could be by the end of next year, Lee didn\u2019t hold back:\n\n\u201cIf the spot Bitcoin (ETF) gets approved, I think the demand will be greater than the daily supply of Bitcoin, so the clearing price [...] is over $150,000, it could even be like $180,000.\u201d\n\nLee clarified that this could be the case so long as it is a United States-approved spot Bitcoin ETF, as there are already spot Bitcoin ETFs in Europe.\n\n\u201cIf the Spot #Bitcoin ETF gets approved \u2026 the clearing price of $BTC is above $150,000.\u201d \u2013 Tom Lee @fundstrat pic.twitter.com/ILQZqdjsZA \u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) August 16, 2023\n\nThe United States currently makes up 97.7% of the global trading volume for crypto-related ETFs, according to Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Once spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved, this could go to 99.5%, he said.\n\nHowever, even if the spot ETF applications are rejected, Lee still predicts a considerable price push to come from Bitcoin\u2019s next halving event, expected to take place in April 2024.\n\n\u201cYou will have a drop in supply again, so the clearing price has to increase. But it won\u2019t be six figures.\u201d\n\nIn June, Wall Street heavyweights Fidelity, Invesco, Wisdom Tree and Valkyrie followed the world\u2019s largest asset manager BlackRock in applying for a Bitcoin spot ETF with the SEC.\n\nHowever, some of these firms may not learn their fate until sometime in 2024 as the SEC has up to 240 days to make a final decision on an application after commencing the review process.\n\nThe outcome of Grayscale\u2019s appeal to convert its GBTC trust product into a Bitcoin spot ETF is however expected to come sooner rather than later.\n\nBloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart recently estimated that there\u2019s a 65% chance of these Bitcoin spot ETFs being approved by the securities regulator \u2014 a significant increase from before BlackRock\u2019s application.\n\nRelated: $160K at next halving? Model counts down to new Bitcoin all-time high\n\nOther have tipped that a $100,000 Bitcoin price could come much sooner than expected, with Blockstream CEO Adam Back recently wagering that Bitcoin will notch the new price milestone the month before the halving event.\n\nHowever, not everyone is inclined to agree. Jesse Myer, the co-founder of Bitcoin investment firm Onramp, explained on Aug. 15 that the market would only price in the changed reality 12-18 months post-halving.\n\n\u201cBitcoin won\u2019t surge to $100k before the next halving,\u201d he said.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Hall of Flame: Wolf Of All Streets worries about a world where Bitcoin hits $1M"

        "title": "Bitcoin extends losses as BNB falls after Binance closes payment service - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin prices fell on Wednesday afternoon trade in Asia, along with all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Notably, BNB, the native token of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, added to its weekly drop after the company announced the closing of its cryptocurrency payment service Binance Connect. Investor concerns remained on edge following Fitch Ratings\u2019 downgrade warning on Tuesday for dozens of major U.S. banks including JPMorgan.\n\nSee related article: TradFi has its eyes on crypto, and here\u2019s the real reason why: Opinion\n\nBitcoin dips; Binance faces heat\n\nBitcoin dropped 0.69% to US$29,160 in the 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, bringing its weekly losses to 2.18%, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin has been trading below US$30,000 since last Wednesday. The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency\u2019s trading volume gained 8.71%, but its market capitalization lost 0.84% to US$567.23 billion in the past 24 hours.\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s earlier reputation as a highly volatile asset attracted traders who thrived on rapid price swings. With the decrease in volatility, such opportunities for substantial short-term gains have become less common,\u201d said Nigel Green, founder and chief executive officer of financial management group deVere, in an emailed statement on Monday.\n\n\u201cFor investors who thrive on volatility, the calmer waters of the Bitcoin market can feel limiting. They must adapt their strategies to the new normal, focusing on longer-term trends and holding positions for extended periods,\u201d Green added.\n\nBNB, the native token of the largest crypto exchange Binance, fell 1.92% to US$234.66, logging a 4.17% weekly decline. Binance said it will shut down its cryptocurrency payment service Binance Connect on Wednesday, due to \u201cchanging market and user needs.\u201d\n\nBinance filed a protective court order against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday, seeking to restrict the agency\u2019s \u201coverbroad\u201d requests for information. The SEC sued Binance, its U.S. platform, and Chief Executive Officer Changpeng Zhao in June for alleged breach of securities laws.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization fell 1.31% to US$1.16 trillion, while market volume climbed 22.48% to US$32.08 billion.\n\nDeGods sales drop, but tops rankings\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.14% to 2,471.55 over the 24 hours leading up to 7.10 p.m. in Hong Kong, but posted gains of 0.23% on the week.\n\nAt the same time, Forkast\u2019s Ethereum NFT and the Polygon NFT indexes gained, while the index measuring Solana NFTs declined.\n\nTotal NFT sales volume dropped 2.16% in the past 24 hours to US$15.79 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Total NFT transactions also dropped 9.78% to US$565,906.\n\nNFT sales volume on Ethereum dropped 7.97% to US$9.14 million, although the network topped CryptoSlam\u2019s sales volume rankings.\n\nAmong collections, Ethereum-based DeGods topped sales rankings with US$1.23 million, although it was 37.85% lower than the previous day.\n\n\u201cClearly collectors have lost some faith in the DeGods team after fumbling the DeGods Season III art release, and the announcement of moving y00ts again from Polygon to Ethereum,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs.\n\nMythos-based DMarket ranked second, rising 8.33% to US$1.01 million, while Polygon\u2019s DraftKings ranked third after its sales volumes climbed 52.19% in the past 24 hours to US$771,722.\n\nAsian bourses, U.S. stock futures fall; European equities mixed\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nMost Asian equity markets were down on Wednesday. China\u2019s Shenzhen Component, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, Japan\u2019s Nikkei, and South Korea\u2019s Kospi dropped at the end of trading hours, following lackluster economic data coming out of China.\n\nThe country\u2019s economic activity data for July \u2014 retail sales, industrial output and investment \u2014 all came in lower than expected, raising concerns about the health of the world\u2019s second-largest economy. The People\u2019s Bank of China on Tuesday unexpectedly cut loan rates by 15 basis points to 2.5%, the steepest cut in three years.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s cyclical soft patch keeps deepening. Data from a wide range of indicators, including credit growth, investment in capital markets and properties, industrial production, retail sales, construction, exports, and manufacturing and agricultural product prices reveal an overall loss of economic momentum,\u201d Singapore-based DBS bank said in a research report on Monday.\n\n\u201cIn addition to lackluster economic data, a long-simmering threat to economic and financial stability, the intersection of weak property market prices and a mountain of debt in the sector, is causing considerable concern,\u201d DBS added.\n\nU.S. stock futures dropped as of 8.30 p.m. in Hong Kong with the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures, and the Nasdaq 100 futures all in the red.\n\nRatings agency Fitch has warned of a downgrade for dozens of major U.S. banks including JPMorgan. The agency also downgraded the United States\u2019 long term credit rating from AAA to AA+ earlier this month citing long-term macroeconomic concerns.\n\nMeanwhile, annual headline inflation in the United Kingdom dropped sharply to 6.8% in July from 7.9% in June, the lowest level since February 2022 and matching market expectations. However, core inflation, which excludes volatile energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices, remained unchanged from June at 6.9%, and slightly above expectations of 6.8%.\n\n\u201cThe plan that we are executing on is clearly working, but we need to keep with that plan, keep making responsible decisions when it comes to public finances, and we need to make sure that fiscal policy is aligned with monetary policy at the Bank of England,\u201d Gareth Davies, exchequer secretary at the U.K. Treasury, told CNBC on Wednesday.\n\nEuropean bourses were mixed on Wednesday, with the benchmark STOXX 600 falling while Germany\u2019s DAX 40 strengthened during afternoon trading hours in Europe."

        "content": "Stablecoin issuer Tether (USDT) is building specialized software to optimize Bitcoin mining and renewable energy operations using data analyticsfollowing recent investment endeavors into both categories.\n\nIn conversation with Cointelegraph, Tether Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino expanded upon details of its in-development mining software, which aims to deliver improved analytics and performance of mining sites.\n\nRelated: Tether\u2019s game plan in El Salvador: Why invest in Volcano Energy?\n\nMoria, named after the dwarven mining kingdom from The Lord of the Rings trilogy, is being built by Ardoino and a team of developers. The Tether technology chief had previously shared details of the software in a recent social media post.\n\nTether is investing in renewable energy production (with excess reserves / profits) and sustainable #bitcoin mining.\n\nWhile there are ton of cloud-based bitcoin mining trackers, everything I've seen so far is not really customizable and lacks of deep-level orchestration\u2026 \u2014 Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) August 15, 2023\n\nArdoino says that while the ecosystem has a number of cloud-based Bitcoin mining trackers, these lack a high degree of customizability and \u201cdeep-level orchestration capabilities\u201d that has left a gap in the market for a solution that analyzes real-time data to optimize mining and energy outputs.\n\n\u201cSo far most software that mining companies use are basic cloud solutions that have a simplified interface that provides an overview of the current status of the bitcoin mining site.\u201d\n\nArdoino said that having access to deep data sources of an energy production site or a mining site requires complex and efficient analytical tools in order to understand the performance of a site and its surrounding environment.\n\n\u201cIf energy used by the mining site is wind or solar, there are optimization parameters, like predicted speed of wind for a specific day or a specific hour of the day, that could be used to overclock some of the miners and boost the production.\u201d\n\nTether has been actively investing in energy production and Bitcoin mining using a portion of excess reserves of USDT. Ardoino said that ensuring data produced by a variety of devices including miners, containers and electric transformers is recorded, monitored and analyzed in real time is imperative to streamlining operations.\n\nHis recent X post extrapolated the value to be derived from a Bitcoin mining site made up of thousands of physical mining units stored in multiple containers connected to thousands more devices. The technology executive likened a mining site to an Internet of Things project that produces millions of data points.\n\nArdoino added that the development focus of Moria is currently on its Bitcoin analytical tools, before the software is extended to cover energy production.\n\n\u201cThere as well you have solar panels, wind mills etc that provide an incredible amount of information.\u201d\n\nArdoino describes Moria\u2019s software as a Holepunch-based scalable and modular architecture that is able to collect, aggregate and analyze data from a variety of devices to optimize Bitcoin mining.\n\nTether recently announced that it would invest $1 billion into El Salvador\u2019s volcano energy project, directing shareholder profits into energy infrastructure and Bitcoin mining operations. In another extensive interview with Cointelegraph, Ardoino outlined Tether\u2019s reasoning behind the move.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Elegant and ass-backward\u2019: Jameson Lopp\u2019s first impression of Bitcoin"

        "title": "Hosting Company Used by Extremists Received $3 Million in Bitcoin After 2021 Hack - Southern Poverty Law Center",
        "content": "An unknown person or group transferred 62.5322 bitcoins, then worth $2,922,069, to a wallet associated with Epik on Sept. 14, 2021, at 10:08 p.m. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The transfer took place less than 36 hours after members of the hacker collective Anonymous announced that they had gained access to Epik\u2019s backend servers and exfiltrated over 150 gigabytes of the company\u2019s operations and customer records, including domain purchases, payment histories and account information.\n\nTwo days after receiving the nearly $3 million in bitcoin, the person in control of Epik\u2019s wallet transferred the funds, along with an additional six bitcoins, to another wallet. The recipient of nearly 70 bitcoins appears to be Arsyan Ismail, a Malaysian businessman and programmer who, according to social media posts and Malaysian news reports, was accused by his prior employer of being involved in a get-rich-quick scam that authorities in that country estimate defrauded half a million people between 2013 and 2017.\n\nThe Data Lab confirmed that the address that received the 62 bitcoins was part of a cluster of addresses belonging to Epik through our comparison of the wallet\u2019s activity on the blockchain and hacked-and-leaked sales records. However, we were unable to determine who owned the wallet that transferred the funds to Epik. The Data Lab identified the proprietor of the wallet that received the 70 bitcoins on Sept. 16 as Ismail through his use of custom wallet addresses containing his first name and the name of one of his companies, as well as a 2014 post that he shared in a bitcoin-focused Facebook group that contained one wallet address.\n\nEpik began accepting bitcoin as a payment type for its services in fall 2016, according to a press release from that time. In a question-and-answer session following the 2021 hack, Epik founder Rob Monster described his company as \u201cone of the first registrars to accept crypto.\u201d Nevertheless, the Epik-controlled wallet, which was active between March 2020 and September 2022, only received a total of roughly 85 bitcoins. As a result, the Sept. 14, 2021, transfer accounts for 74% of the wallet\u2019s total transactions during its lifetime.\n\nEpik is a web services company founded in 2009 by Monster, a businessman based in Sammamish, Washington. Though Monster has denied holding any sympathies for white nationalism, Epik became the web company of choice for the radical right in late 2018.\n\nHatewatch reached out to Monster over email and through a contact form on the website for his company, Kingdom Ventures. Hatewatch reached out to Ismail over an email on his personal website. Neither of the two men responded.\n\nA who\u2019s who of the global far right\n\nProminent far-right extremist sites began turning to Epik after Epik\u2019s services helped Twitter knockoff Gab get back online in 2018. Gab had been banned by its prior domain registrar after an October 2018 white supremacist terror attack in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nSince then, Epik has become a haven for websites with ties to right-wing extremism, with its client list representing a veritable \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d of the global far-right movement. Among those who relied on Epik\u2019s services are 8chan, an online message board that has hosted manifestos and livestreams from multiple white supremacist terrorists; Parler, a social media site popular among rioters at the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol; and Stormfront, a once-popular online forum founded by Don Black, a former Klansman who was arrested in 1981 for attempting to invade a Caribbean island. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, whose junk-news site Infowars helped jump-start the 2021 Capitol insurrection, credited Epik with keeping his network of junk-news channels online.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be around if it weren\u2019t for Epik. \u2026 They have all the services you need, and they are expanding,\u201d Jones said during an April 2021 broadcast of his show.\n\nThe 2021 hack resulted in years of purchase records, company emails and customer accounts \u2013 including from Epik\u2019s privacy service, Anonymize, which allowed customers to conceal their identity \u2013 being made available to the public. In addition to some 15 million unique email addresses, the customer data exposed by the hack included IP addresses, phone numbers, passwords and mailing addresses. The material allowed activists, journalists and researchers, including from the Southern Poverty Law Center, to identify the once-anonymous owners of numerous websites, including sites with ties to terrorist organizations.\n\nOn Sept. 2, 2022, Monster stepped down as Epik\u2019s chief executive officer. Brian Royce, the former executive vice president of operations, replaced him. Monster, meanwhile, assumed a role as chairman of the company\u2019s board of directors. A September 2022 press release announcing the decision presented the company under Monster\u2019s leadership as \u201ca defender of civil liberty.\u201d\n\nFollowing a March lawsuit leveled against Epik by one of its clients, the company publicly blamed Monster for a scandal involving its proprietary financial product Masterbucks. Launched in 2022, Masterbucks was intended to compete with online money-transferring platforms like PayPal or CashApp, though it was quickly embroiled in controversy after reports of users being unable to withdraw funds. The complaint from the March lawsuit accused Royce and Monster of mishandling and embezzling funds. According to the complaint, Epik owed a client $327,000 after failing to transfer a domain the client had purchased for that amount.\n\nIn April, less than a month after the lawsuit was first filed, a series of tweets from Epik\u2019s Twitter blamed Monster for the company\u2019s financial woes and scandals. In one April 14 post, Epik blamed Monster for Masterbucks\u2019 failure, saying that it continued to struggle \u201cto manage debt from his company-wide oversights.\u201d Two days later, on April 16, Epik\u2019s Twitter account stated that the company \u201crequested his resignation from the board over apparent conflicts\u201d with creditors.\n\nEpik issued a press release on June 8 stating that the core domain name registration portion of the company had been sold to a new entity, Epik LLC, which retained Royce as CEO. Monster returned as CEO of Epik Holdings Inc., where he retained ownership of some of the lesser-known products, including Masterbucks. Monster rebranded his share of the operation into a new company called Kingdom Ventures.\n\nPhoto illustration of Epik founder Rob Monster (left) and current Epik CEO Brian Royce by SPLC"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) speculators are leading a period of \u201cexhaustion and apathy\u201d across the market, new research says.\n\nIn the latest edition of its weekly newsletter, \u201cThe Week On-Chain,\u201d analytics firm Glassnode wrote about waning conviction among Bitcoin\u2019s short-term holders (STH).\n\nBitcoin speculators risk unrealized losses\n\nAfter several months of stagnant BTC price action, frustration among market participants has led to predictions of deeper downside to come.\n\nBulls remain unable to break resistance, while sellers likewise face multiple support zones in the form of trend lines between the current $29,000 and $25,000.\n\nAmong these is the STH cost basis, or realized price. STHs are defined by Glassnode as entities hodling coins for 155 days or less and correspond to the more speculative end of the Bitcoin investor spectrum.\n\nThe STH cost basis has functioned as support throughout 2023, but it is rapidly rising and currently sits at $28,600.\n\nBy contrast, the long-term holder (LTH) cost basis, which reflects the aggregate purchase price of the most stubborn hodlers, is far lower at $20,300.\n\n\u201cThe separation between these two cost basis is an indicator that many recent buyers have a relatively elevated acquisition price,\u201d Glassnode commented.\n\nContinuing, researchers described the market as being potentially \u201ctop heavy,\u201d with even a modest BTC price comedown now apt to send the STH cohort into the red.\n\n\u201cOn a macro scale, this supply distribution does resemble similar periods during bear market recoveries in the past,\u201d they reasoned.\n\n\u201cHowever, on a shorter timeframe, it could be argued to be a slightly top heavy market, with many price sensitive investors at risk of falling into an unrealized loss.\u201d\n\nBitcoin long/short-term on-chain cost basis annotated chart (screenshot). Source: Glassnode\n\nBitcoin hodler conviction still \u201cimpressively high\u201d\n\nDespite this, it appears that speculators have already started to reconsider their market exposure.\n\nRelated: BTC price can reach $34K as Bitcoin faces support \u2018kiss\u2019 \u2014 QCP Capital\n\nThe portion of the BTC supply under the control of STH entities has declined, while LTHs now control a larger chunk than ever before.\n\n\u201cWe note that the supply held by Long-Term Holders continues to increase, hitting an ATH of 14.6M BTC. In direct contrast, Short-Term Holder supply has declined to multi-year low of 2.56M BTC,\u201d The Week On-Chain added.\n\n\u201cOverall, this suggests that conviction of Bitcoin investors does remain impressively high, and very few are willing to liquidate their holdings.\u201d\n\nThe last time that STHs had such little market presence was in October 2021, just before BTC/USD hit its current all-time high of $69,000.\n\nBitcoin long/short-term holder threshold chart.

        "content": "MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--U.S. Data Mining Group, Inc. dba US Bitcoin Corp (\u201cUSBTC\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d), a leading operator of large-scale data centers for new-age workloads such as digital asset mining, today shared production and operations updates for July 2023. The Company generates revenue from self-mining, hosting, and property management services. Below are certain key production and operational metrics for July 2023, including illustrative data if the Celsius Transaction had been completed on July 1, 2023.\n\nOperational Metrics1 Month-End Miners Under Management 189,349 Month-End Hashrate Under Management 18.99 EH/s Estimated Pro Forma Operational Metrics Assuming Consummation of the Celsius Transaction2 Miners Under Management 311,349 Hashrate Under Management 31.19 EH/s\n\nSelf-Mining Metrics3 Month-End Miners Installed 48,255 Month-End Hashrate Installed 4.9 EH/s\n\nEnergy Metrics Month-End Megawatts Under Management1 730 MW Energy Volume Supplied for Grid Relief and Ancillary Services4 33,580 MWh Energy Sold From Echo Wind Farm into ERCOT 3,071 MWh\n\nCommentary\n\n\u201c USBTC reached a major milestone this month in its pursuit of building a resilient, diversified revenue base,\u201d said Asher Genoot, President of USBTC. \u201cAs we continue to scale, self-mining no longer represents the primary driver of the company\u2019s revenue stream. Hosting and property management revenues have grown significantly, creating strong revenue visibility and downside protection. At the same time, we continue to maintain significant upside potential should bitcoin run by optimizing our self-mining operations and building profit share structures into our hosting and property management agreements. In July, self-mining contributed 286 bitcoins to our portfolio.\u201d\n\nCelsius Mining Operations\n\nOn May 25, 2023, the Company, as part of the Fahrenheit LLC coalition, won a bankruptcy auction to manage and operate the assets owned by Celsius Network LLC (\u201cCelsius\u201d), which includes a lending portfolio, digital assets, and approximately 122,000 mining machines, subject to the approval of the bankruptcy court. In addition, the Company, acting separately through its USMIO business, won the right to enter into one or more operating and services agreements with the restructured company, which is also subject to the approval of the bankruptcy court.\n\nThe Company previously announced that it secured hosting agreements for approximately 150,000 bitcoin miners. These companies include Teslawatt, Marathon Digital, Foundry USA, Sphere 3D, and Decimal Group. In aggregate, the Company expects to manage a fleet of more than 310,000 bitcoin miners across Celsius and hosted assets.\n\nMerger with Hut 8\n\nOn February 7, 2023, the Company announced an all-stock merger of equals (the \u201cTransaction\u201d) with Hut 8 Mining Corp. (Nasdaq, TSX: HUT), one of North America\u2019s largest, innovation-focused digital asset mining pioneers and high performance computing infrastructure providers. The combined company will be named \u201cHut 8 Corp.\u201d (\u201cNew Hut\u201d) and will be a U.S.-domiciled entity. The Transaction is expected to establish New Hut as a large-scale, publicly traded Bitcoin miner focused on economical mining, highly diversified revenue streams, and industry leading environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices.\n\nAbout US Bitcoin Corp\n\nFounded by a team of visionary entrepreneurs and experienced executives, USBTC is an efficient, eco-friendly, and large-scale North American mining company.

        "title": "Are investors bored of Bitcoin? Its 90-day volatility is now the lowest since 2016 - Fortune",
        "content": "Crypto is known for volatile swings\u2014turning a $1000 investment into double or triple that in a day if not hours\u2014and for many investors that was the appeal.\n\nBut since June\u2014some could argue since March\u2014top dog Bitcoin has been kind of a bore. The cryptocurrency, which makes up just under half of the overall market, has been stalled around the $30,000 mark for months. On Thursday, at time of publication, the coin had dropped about 2.5% over 24 hours, settling near $28,400.\n\nThe most popular cryptocurrency\u2019s 90-day volatility is at its lowest since 2016, Bloomberg reported, and with no end in sight to the stability, investors are getting tired of it, according to a report by blockchain data company Glassnode.\n\n\u201cWith this low volatility comes apathy and exhaustion, which often entails a relatively weak influx of demand,\u201d Glassnode wrote.\n\nHistorically, crypto could generate double-digit returns in the short term, but recently staid TradFi markets have outpaced the top digital currency. From June 20, when Bitcoin became range-bound around $30,000, it has returned 0.3%, meanwhile the S&P 500 has increased 0.6%. (Over the same period, Ether, the second-most-popular cryptocurrency, is down 0.5%.) Elsewhere, global government bond yields are at their highest in 15 years, according to Bloomberg.\n\nBut while active traders may be looking elsewhere for alpha\u2014the supply of Bitcoin held by short-term investors is at a multiyear low\u2014some long-term investors are still snapping it up, which could be a positive, according to the Glassnode report.\n\n\u201cThis suggests that conviction of Bitcoin investors does remain impressively high, and very few are willing to liquidate their holdings,\u201d the report read.\n\nA \u201cfresh cycle\u201d for crypto could be fueled, among other things, by new stablecoin supply, according to analysts at Bernstein, led by the managing director and senior analyst of its global digital assets division, Gautam Chhugani.\n\nIn a Monday report, the analysts wrote that Bernstein expects $2.8 trillion of new stablecoins to be allocated toward digital assets over the next five years as the market becomes more regulated. The overall market cap of stablecoins is currently $124 billion, which is about 10.5% of the total crypto market cap, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThe report singles out PayPal\u2019s newly launched stablecoin as evidence that cryptocurrencies have room to grow, including as a tool for cross-border remittances, potentially adding immense value for corporations worldwide. That is, if Congress gives the coins a boost with new legislation, the analysts added.\n\n\u201cThe new proposed stablecoin act is being progressed relatively fast, and in the midst of a global digital currency race, this will become a national priority in the U.S to extend the dollar\u2019s dominance in the digital economy,\u201d the report read.\n\nAnother possible boon for crypto is the impending decision on Grayscale\u2019s lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission over whether it should be allowed to create a spot Bitcoin ETF. Any judgment in favor of Grayscale has the potential to supercharge crypto prices, as it would open a new avenue for investors to put money into the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency.\n\nFor its part, Grayscale appears optimistic. On Thursday, the company tweeted out a link to an open position in its ETF department."

        "title": "Can Bitcoin Reach $100,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After 2022 saw Bitcoin's (BTC -0.63%) price crater 65% amid an aggressive rising rate environment, this year has been a turnaround story. The top digital asset's recent rally (up 76% as of Aug. 14) has many investors excited about its long-term potential.\n\nBitcoin currently commands about 49% of the overall cryptocurrency market, which is not surprising given its first-mover advantage. And the current price of $29,400, while still 57% below its peak, is astronomically higher than where it was a decade ago.\n\nBut can Bitcoin reach $100,000, equaling a more than threefold rise? Here's why I think this is completely within the realm of possibility.\n\nCathie Wood's perspective\n\nRenowned investor Cathie Wood of Ark Invest has an incredibly lofty price target of nearly $1.5 million per Bitcoin by 2030. That's certainly an extremely bullish outlook. While I have no idea whether this will happen, I agree with Wood's research as it relates to the general direction of Bitcoin's adoption curve.\n\nThe key to Ark Invest's thesis is that Bitcoin simply finds its way into more portfolios. This means that individual and institutional investors, corporations, and governments will start to allocate capital to Bitcoin. Therefore, it can become a more popular reserve asset.\n\nWood and her team also believe that Bitcoin will be used for global remittances, as a form of currency in emerging markets, and to settle transactions among banks in the U.S. I view these scenarios as having lower probabilities of success.\n\nThe digital version of gold\n\nAdding to the point above, Bitcoin's most realistic use case is that it one day solidifies itself as a prominent store of value. To be more specific, it can be a substitute for owning gold, which has been a popular asset for thousands of years.\n\nBut Bitcoin has some important advantages compared to the precious metal. The cryptocurrency is more divisible, useful in transactions, and portable. And its fixed supply cap of 21 million tokens introduces scarcity. If demand for Bitcoin goes up, nothing can be done to alter the growth in its supply because the limit is hard coded into the software.\n\nOn the other hand, should the demand for gold skyrocket, it would become more economically feasible for mining companies to explore different regions of the world to find new deposits. In other words, the supply dynamics could change.\n\nUnderstand the risks\n\nAlthough there's a lot to like about Bitcoin, investors should be mindful of the most important risk factor: Governments banning it. In 2021, China made it illegal to mine and own cryptocurrencies. As the world's second-largest economy, with a population of 1.4 billion people, this was huge news.\n\nNaturally, there's also a worry that the U.S. will follow the same path. What's encouraging, however, is that Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler has publicly stated that the agency has no plan to ban Bitcoin, viewing it as a commodity instead of a security. In fact, clearer regulation could actually be a boon for Bitcoin because then it could be seen as more of a legitimate asset.\n\nA popular argument for banning Bitcoin is that it is used in illicit activities. But this fails to recognize that fiat (government-backed) currencies have long facilitated these types of transactions. And according to data from Chainalysis, a blockchain research company, only 0.24% of cryptocurrency activity in 2022 was used for illegal purposes.\n\nAs wealthier Americans -- at least those who donate to political parties -- start to own more Bitcoin over time, it will be even harder for the government to ban it. And from the perspective of the U.S., prohibiting the use of Bitcoin could lead to the country falling behind in terms of innovation, something that could have drastic consequences from a geopolitical perspective.\n\nKeeping these risks in mind, I still think it's more likely than not that Bitcoin will reach $100,000. And I wouldn't be shocked if it happened within the next five years."

It has since dipped to 10.1 million ARS.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe all-time national high comes at a time when the country is suffering from one of the world\u2019s highest levels of inflation, and the peso is rapidly losing value.\n\nDigital assets are popular in the country, though, according to Chainalysis, which last year ranked Argentina as having the tenth highest rate of cryptocurrency adoption anywhere in the world.\n\n\ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udcc8#Bitcoin\u2019s value against the three weakest emerging markets currencies this year - the ARS, TRY and the RUB - has soared between 140% and 240% YTD. \ud83d\udc49Notably, its price in ARS just hit an all-time high! pic.twitter.com/G97nswb22F \u2014 Kaiko (@KaikoData) August 14, 2023\n\nMilei is a 52-year-old shaggy-haired economist with a penchant for rock music and leather jackets.

That\u2019s the highest in the region after Venezuela, and rising prices in Latin America\u2019s third-largest economy have pushed many into poverty.\n\nSocial media-savvy Milei has said he wants to dollarize the economy and wants Argentina to distance itself from communist countries like Venezuela and China.\n\nIf he wins, will he make Argentina into a Bitcoin-friendly economy, too?"

        "title": "New Bitcoin Bull Run on the Way as Macro Conditions and On-Chain Line Up - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitcoin is following a four-year business cycle and is ready for bullish moves\n\nOn-chain indicators MVRV and VWAPR support this claim\n\nChart analysis points out at bearish near-term price action\n\nKevin Kelly , co-founder of Delphi Digital, perceives a recent shift in a pivotal U.S. manufacturing index as a potential precursor to a crypto upswing and pointed out that many on-chain indicators suggest the start of a new crypto bull cycle.\n\nIn a Twitter (X) thread , he said: \u201cBTC price peaks occur around the same time the ISM shows signs of topping out. Active addresses, total transaction volumes, total fees \u2014 they all peaked alongside tops in the ISM too.\u201d\n\nDrawing a connection between the business cycle and the crypto market, Kelly elucidated that crypto market rebounds usually mirror signs of recovery in the business sector.\n\nHe said, \u201cTurning points in the business cycle have historically been ripe opportunities to increase risk exposure,\u201d before adding, \u201cIt looks like the ISM is nearing the final stages of its two-year downtrend, which again risk assets have been sniffing out.\u201d\n\nAre there any other on-chain indicators that signal Bitcoin is starting its bull cycle?\n\nOn-Chain Indicators\n\nOne of the most reliable metrics for spotting Bitcoin tops and bottoms has been the Market Value to Realized Value ratio. This metric is a ratio between Market capitalization and Realized capitalization. Realized capitalization approximates the value paid for all coins in existence by summing the market value of coins at the time they last moved on the blockchain.\n\nAs you can see from the chart above, we have drawn black lines between MVRV and price tops and red lines to its correlated bottoms. In June last year, MVRV reached a key horizontal level of 0.76, last seen in December 2018 when the previous bull run started and was. Last June, it was even slightly lower than in March 2020 when the bull market really took off.\n\nIt reached the value of 1.53 in mid-April, reminiscent of June 2019 when the price of Bitcoin made a first bull market high.\n\nThe next one would be the Volume-Weighted Average Price Ratio (VWAPR). The volume-weighted average price is a moving average that considers the trading volume as it divides the price in the trading session with the volume to come up with an average price.\n\nThe chart above shows that every time the Bitcoins price went below the VWAP (red circles), we saw the accumulation zone starting. This is also the case up until June last year. On the other hand, the WWAP ratio fell last June to its significant horizontal levels that have proven to indicate the bottom area.\n\nVWAPR made a higher low, but a higher low was also me in December \u2013 February 2019 compared to February \u2013 August 2015.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere is some on-chain evidence to support the assumption that from June last year, the price of Bitcoin has started its bull market cycle. As we have seen a price increase that recovered it by 100% until April, this rise would be its first impulsive wave.\n\nIn some of our previous analyses, we have pointed out that if Bitcoin started its bull cycle, then we need to see the first major correction establishing the first bull market higher low, similarly to how we say in March 2020 compared to February 2019.\n\nSince we are talking in the macro term, we are still yet to validate this possibility by some near-term price action as there is still a bearish scenario to be invalidated.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "content": "The issuer of stablecoin Tether will discontinue its Bitcoin Omni Layer version, citing a lack of interest from users. This Bitcoin version of Tether (USDT) was one of the first stablecoins ever created. The Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Kusama (KSM) versions will also be discontinued, according to an Aug. 17 announcement from the team.\n\nToday #Tether announces the ending of the support of 3 blockchains $USDt: OmniLayer, BCH-SLP and Kusama.\n\nCustomers will be able to continue to redeem and swap $USDt tokens (to another of the many supported blockchains), but Tether won't issue any new additional $USDt on those 3\u2026 https://t.co/aghLgqtSuO \u2014 Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) August 17, 2023\n\nAccording to the announcement, no new Tether tokens will be issued on the Bitcoin Omni Layer, Kusama or Bitcoin Cash going forward. Redemptions will remain available for at least a year, and the company will issue further announcements before the year passes as to how it will handle redemptions after that point.\n\nThe Bitcoin Omni Layer is a smart contract system built on top of the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain. Originally called \u201cMastercoin,\u201d it was released in July 2013, a full two years before Ethereum. Omni Layer Tether became the first stablecoin to be released on the system in October 2014. It quickly grew to be the highest market cap stablecoin, surpassing earlier stablecoins such as BitUSD and NuBits.\n\nIn its Aug. 17 announcement, Tether sought to acknowledge the important historical role that Omni Layer Tether played in crypto history, stating:\n\n\u201cWe understand the significance of this decision, particularly for Omni, as it was the first transport layer that Tether used in 2014. The Omni Layer, built on top of Bitcoin, played a crucial role in Tether\u2019s early journey, and we acknowledge the contributions and innovations the team has made to the crypto landscape.\u201d\n\nRelated: PayPal\u2019s stablecoin opens door for crypto adoption in traditional finance\n\nHowever, the team stated that the Omni Layer \u201cfaced challenges due to the lack of popular tokens and the availability of USDT on other blockchains.\u201d This led exchanges to use other transport layers instead of Omni, which in turn led to a decline in USDT Omni usage and forced the company to end its issuance.\n\nTether claimed that it would consider reissuing the Omni Layer version if usage of Omni picks up. The company also stated that it is working on a new Bitcoin smart contract system called \u201cRGB\u201d and that it plans to reissue Tether in an RGB version once it is completed, bringing Tether back to the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nCompetition between stablecoins has been heating up in 2023, challenging Tether\u2019s dominance. PayPal released its PayPal USD (PYUSD) on Aug. 7, and Binance listed First Digital USD (FDUSD) on July 26."

        "title": "Fed July Records Hint At More Rate Hikes While Bitcoin and Ethereum Slip: Is There Direct Correlation - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nFed minutes release for July\n\nCrypto market slipped by 3%, could it be based on hints of Fed hike?\n\nFurther rate hikes of 0.25% are likely\n\nThe minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s two-day July meeting came out yesterday, August 16 . They underscore the central bank\u2019s growing concerns about persistent inflation. Despite a recent quarter percentage point rate hike, which brought the federal funds rate to its highest level in over 22 years, the inflation battle is seen as ongoing by most FOMC members.\n\nThe minutes reveal significant worries about inflation staying above the Committee\u2019s desired range, with tight labor market conditions further complicating the outlook.\n\nAlthough some members expressed doubt about the necessity of additional hikes, the consensus leans towards caution, emphasizing the importance of a restrictive monetary policy to steer inflation back to the 2% target.\n\nWhile the future direction remains uncertain, with indications that inflation pressures might be easing, the minutes highlight a collective sentiment of vigilance, suggesting a heightened likelihood that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates again in the near future if current conditions persist.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum Slip\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin and Ethereum have slipped from their sideways range in a single percentage decrease of around 3%. Has there been a correlation between the negative sentiment toward the future economic outlook with this decrease in the cryptocurrency market?\n\nThe Fed minutes were released on the official website at 2:00 p.m. EDT yesterday.\n\nAlthough the news outlets started reporting soon after due to writing and publishing, the news lagged a bit behind until it caught on. Nevertheless, BTC and ETH prices have already been in a slight downtrend, which only propelled it further.\n\nAt the exact time of the Fed minutes release, the price of BTC and ETH started falling with higher momentum and picked up the pace overnight. The price of Bitcoin was trading at $29,195 and fell to $28,300 at its daily low. Ethereum fell from $1827 to its daily low of $1,777, which is a decrease of 2.69%.\n\nAs seen on the chart above, there is a direct correlation between this news release and the price decline. This is because all markets are currently sensitive to the overall economic sentiment, and crypto is still viewed as the riskiest asset class in particular.\n\nFed Meeting in September\n\nThe next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting will be held on September 19 \u2013 20, 2023. The consensus among financial analysts and other experts on the matter is mixed.\n\nSome expect that the monetary policy-making body of the Federal Reserve System will most likely make another interest rate hike by another 25-basis-point to moderate inflation to the targeted 2%.\n\nOthers say that it might pause for now as it did in June and evaluate the situation as it fears the economy will get too tight and limit consumer spending.\n\nConclusion\n\nFederal Reserve is the most important entity in the global economy since its decisions can impact the value of the US dollar, which is still the global reserve currency. This is why investors and traders all across the world are following their announcements.\n\nWhat the Fed does next still remains unclear, but considering that it only made a small blow to inflation and definitely not a win, further action will be required, thus we would be primarily expecting an increase in interest rates.\n\nWith the cryptocurrency market standing on shaky legs since April, this might be a catalyst for a larger decline.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "content": "Hedge fund founder Tom Lee opined that BTC would cross its ATH shortly after the ETF approval.\n\nAnother big player in the market predicted a surge in liquidity.\n\nThe anticipation surrounding a potential Bitcoin [BTC] spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approval has been a major topic of discussion within the cryptocurrency community lately. For many investors, regulatory acceptance would impact the BTC price positively.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nHowever, a few skeptics do not believe that a go-ahead by a centralized entity would do anything great for the price action. One notable individual that has commented on the matter is Tom Lee.\n\n$150,000 or nothing\n\nLee, who has been repeatedly bullish on BTC, said he was not surprised that August has been a weak month for the coin. In his interview with CNBC, he based his opinion on BTC\u2019s historical performance. He noted that historically, a strong July for BTC equals an unimpressive August.\n\nOn the ETF application, the founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, a market research firm, said,\n\n\u201cIf the Bitcoin spot ETF gets approved, I think the demand would outweigh the daily supply. And the clear price could be as high as $150,000 or $180,000.\u201d\n\nBut Lee also clarified that the spot ETF has to be approved in the U.S. for the price to hit that high. Although on 14 August, CNBC reported that the U.S. SEC has delayed the approvals of ARKInvest and 21Shares.\n\nAlso, the regulatory agency pushed the deadline to early 2024. However, AMBCrypto had a short conversation with Ruslan Lienkha on the matter.\n\nMore ETFs, more liquidity\n\nLienkha, who is the Chief Markets Officer at YouHolder, opined that the ETF approval could trigger a global adoption of crypto assets. He also mentioned that more firms would want a share of the market.\n\nFurthermore, Lienkha admitted that Jacobi\u2019s ETF approval in Europe did not have a significant impact on BTC. But it is not enough reason to assume that approval in the U.S. would not lead to an uptrend.\n\nIn explaining this, Lienkha used the BTC regional Year-on-Year (YoY) supply as a rationale for the opinion. From the chart shared below, decisions from the U.S. and Asia have had more impact on BTC as Europe was still a neutral ground.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nIn conclusion, Lienkha said that a Bitcoin spot ETF approval in the U.S. would bring in more liquidity for the market and encourage diversification. He said,\n\n\u201cBasically, more ETFs will bring more liquidity to the crypto market and will stimulate market growth. Also, crypto will be better integrated into the financial system.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. SEC may still approve the Bitcoin spot ETFs this year considering recent developments. Lately, Coinbase disclosed that the CTFC approved its application for a Bitcoin and Ethereum [ETH] futures ETF. Therefore, all hope may not be lost for the former."

Discover SCENE\n\nThe price of leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin today sank below $28,000 per coin for the first time in nearly two months.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market cap is trading for $27,765 as of this writing, according to CoinGecko, a 24-hour drop of more than 4%.\n\nBitcoin had soared to $31,000 in June, a run triggered by the world's biggest asset manager BlackRock filing an application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the price largely sat still throughout July and then today dipped sharply\u2014with some analysts attributing the sell-off to Wall Street's biggest regulator taking its time to approve the long list of spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nSell-side research firm Wolfe Research said in a report that it was likely Bitcoin's price would continue to dip before shooting higher again if regulators say yes to a Bitcoin ETF, CNBC reported Thursday.\n\nThe SEC is currently reviewing a number of high-profile Bitcoin ETF applications and analysts are betting that it's likely the regulator could say yes to one.\n\nThe rest of the market also dropped\u2014as it usually does when there is a Bitcoin sell-off\u2014on Thursday.\n\nEthereum, the second biggest cryptocurrency, shed 4.5% of its value in 24 hours and was trading for $1,735 by midday Eastern Time, CoinGecko data showed. Meanwhile Dogecoin, a \"meme coin\" favored by the Tesla CEO and Twitter owner Elon Musk, dropped by over 5% to $0.06.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnother meme coin, Shiba Inu, was the worst hit by the sell-off on Thursday, dropping by over 10% in a day to $0.00000859.\n\nThe token had jumped in value after its creators earlier this month announced the a Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) protocol."

        "title": "Blockstream Is Betting on Bitcoin Comeback as It Hoards Crypto Mining Rigs - HT Tech",
        "content": "Bitcoin developer Blockstream Corp. is betting that the world's most valuable cryptocurrency is poised for a massive rebound, and is buying up Bitcoin mining rigs so that it can sell them for a profit later should the prediction hold.\n\nMontreal-based Blockstream was one of the earliest Bitcoin infrastructure companies, conceived in 2014 by CEO and co-founder Adam Back, among the industry insiders thought to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin \u2014 speculation dispelled by Back.\n\nNow, the company is looking to capitalize on Bitcoin's looming software upgrade \u2014 rather ominously dubbed the \u2018halving' \u2014 which it expects will spur a rally in the digital asset's price, in turn pushing up the price of the specialized computers, or application-specific integrated circuit machines, used by miners to generate Bitcoins.\n\n\u201cWe made quite a bit of money buying and selling miners, and then we're looking at the market and we see that there's really a financial opportunity here,\u201d Blockstream's CEO Adam Back said in an interview.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and ASIC market prices have shown a high correlation, ASIC prices tend to undershoot Bitcoin's value in bear markets and overshoot in bull markets, suggesting a potential upside when denominated in Bitcoin, the firm said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nA glut of mining machines flooded the market last year as Bitcoin's price plummeted, while major crypto lenders like New York Digital Investment Group have also liquidated machine-backed loans. After rebounding about 70% in the first quarter, the price of Bitcoin has stalled at around $30,000 for months. Bitcoin reached an all-time high of almost $69,000 in November 2021.\n\nBut Blockstream spies a window of opportunity as Bitcoin's halving approaches. Scheduled to take place in early 2024, the once-every-four-years event cuts in half the amount of coins that miners can earn for generating Bitcoin, helping to maintain the token's value by reducing supply.\n\nSince those rewards are the main source of income for miners, the upgrade is likely to prompt an arms race to buy new machines to better compete for the limited supply of tokens. Blockstream said it is aiming to raise $5 million through a newly launched investment vehicle so that it can buy, warehouse and then sell ASICs into the market at a premium should Bitcoin's price rally in the run up to the halving.\n\n\u201cWe think there's a huge price correction coming where we see the ASICs coming back up to where the Bitcoin price would be when the capacity is on a market,\u201d said James Macedonio, global head of mining sales and business development at Blockstream.\n\nThe firm's investment vehicle, called The Blockstream ASIC (BASIC) Note, is issuing its Series 1 notes at $115,000 each, according to Tuesday's statement. The securities will be offered on Blockstream's Liquid Network, with the first tranche being made available today.\n\nThe fund raise follows Blockstream's $125 million convertible note and secured loan financing in January to expand its Bitcoin mining co-location services, whereby the firm hosts and operates mining hardware at data centers on behalf of clients. The firm also raised $210 million on a valuation of $3.2 billion in 2021 to advance its mining products and services, and has previously received backing from LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.\n\nBitcoin mining is an energy-intensive process in which miners use specialized computers to validate Bitcoin transactions on the blockchain in return for token rewards. A single Bitcoin mining rig can cost thousands of dollars, which means large-scale miners often raise funds to purchase the machines by selling shares in their businesses or securing debt financing. Lenders also use the mining machines as collateral on loans.\n\nThe value of the mining machines tends to depreciate significantly over time since manufacturers like Bitmain and MicroBT roll out newer and more energy-efficient models every few years. Miners typically upgrade their fleets of mining machines between those periods, as they compete against each other to earn Bitcoin rewards."

        "title": "What Makes Cryptocurrencies Different? - Liberty Street Economics - Liberty Street Economics -",
        "content": "Anders Brownworth, Jon Durfee, Michael Lee, and Antoine Martin\n\nPermissionless blockchains, which support the most popular cryptocurrency networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum, have shown that it is possible to transfer value without relying on centralized trusted third parties, something that is new and remarkable (although perhaps most clearly useful for less developed financial markets). What makes permissionless blockchains able to transfer value without relying on a small number of trusted third parties is the combination of several components that all need to work together. The components themselves are not particularly new, but the combination of these components is more than the sum of its parts. In this post, we provide a high-level overview of these components and how they interact, taking Bitcoin as an example.\n\nPayments and Trust\n\nPayment systems traditionally operate with a small number of economic agents playing key roles, such as making sure only authorized transactions take place. This requires participants to trust these agents to perform their duties. This trust is bolstered by law, rules, and regulations that provide incentives for the agents playing these central roles not to misbehave. Nevertheless, bad behavior, while rare, cannot be ruled out.\n\nCryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, were designed to operate using a different model of trust, one that does not rely on law and regulations. Instead, they rely on two features, open access and a set of incentives to induce good behavior. Open access, or \u201cpermissionlessness,\u201d is necessary to eliminate the risk that a gatekeeper could exert power to their advantage. Mechanisms that offer incentives aimed at limiting misbehavior by participants in the system are necessary since open access permits anyone to opt into any role in the system. While each feature is important on its own, we argue that the combination of the two is necessary for a permissionless blockchain to work as intended. We now describe each feature in more detail.\n\nOpen Access or Permissionlessness\n\nIn permissionless blockchains, anyone can use the payment system without restrictions. In addition, anyone can choose to take part in any of the roles necessary for the operations of the payment system. If any role that is essential to operations has limited access, then select groups could be positioned to gatekeep those roles and misuse their power.\n\nAn important role in a blockchain is forming new blocks. Miners perform that role in Bitcoin. They validate transactions, for example by checking that the same bitcoin is not spent more than one time and add new blocks of valid transactions to the blockchain. Because of open access, anyone can choose to be a miner and Bitcoin has a large number of them. Validation is an important function in any payment system. If the validator, or validators, cannot be trusted, they could authorize transactions that are not valid or exclude transactions that are, whenever favorable, at the cost of other participants.\n\nPermissionless blockchains are transparent, meaning anyone can observe the ledger, know the state of accounts, and see all transactions. It is necessary that the state of the ledger be visible to everyone, so that anyone who wants to propose a new block can verify that proposed transactions are indeed feasible. Transparency also facilitates the detection of attempts to tamper with the ledger.\n\nIf governance of the blockchain is too centralized, so that a small number of individuals can make decisions that affect the entire system, then the system is more vulnerable. Bitcoin does not have a single owner. Governance is quite open as anyone can propose a change to the core code through a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (known as a BIP). However, implementing changes to the core codebase of Bitcoin is restricted to a small number of developers, who could make changes that favor them. That said, any changes these developers make must be accepted by the miners and other nodes in the system to have influence. In this way, the participants of the network also contribute to deciding what rules are executed.\n\nA Set of Incentives for Good Behavior\n\nIn addition to open access, permissionless blockchains require appropriate economic incentives to make sure all system participants behave in a way that supports the blockchain. In cryptocurrency projects, these incentives are achieved through the issuance and usage of a \u201cbase-layer token,\u201d such as bitcoin (Bitcoin, with an upper case \u2018B\u2019 typically refers to the system while bitcoin, in lower case, refers to the asset).\n\nTo give miners an incentive to attempt to add new blocks to the blockchain, successful miners receive a combination of newly issued bitcoin and fees included by the sender of bitcoins. These rewards give miners the incentive to conduct their work honestly because they only retain value, and thus contribute to profits, if the block is broadly accepted.\n\nAn Alternative Model of Trust\n\nWhile both permissionlessness and economic incentives are important on their own, the interplay of both is necessary to implement a new model of trust. We illustrate the importance of this interplay in the case of Bitcoin miners.\n\nTo minimize the need to trust a single or small set of miners, Bitcoin relies on a consensus algorithm that attempts to distribute block creation. Would-be miners compete to solve a mathematical problem resulting in a solution approximately every ten minutes. Anyone can attempt to solve the problem. This mathematical problem has the property that it can only be solved by trial and error. However, once the solution is found, it is easy for anyone to verify that the solution is indeed correct. The probability of being the first to guess the answer is roughly proportional to the processing power at the disposal of the potential miner.\n\nTo understand why distributing validation reduces the need for centralized trust, imagine that you are concerned that a referee could be corrupt and affect the outcome of a sports match you care about. One way to reduce the potential impact of a corrupt referee would be to have a large group of potential available referees. Every thirty seconds or so, a new referee could be put into the game. The new referee\u2019s officiating is reviewed by the large group of potential referees. If the large group of referees agrees with the officiating, the game continues; if not, the game is restarted at the previous state. With such a process, the impact any given referee can have on the game is very small and, so, the incentive to misbehave is also small.\n\nTo Sum Up\n\nThe key innovation of permissionless blockchains, such as Bitcoin, is not any specific technology. The technological and cryptographic primitives underlying Bitcoin were known for years before the cryptocurrency was created. It is the combination of open access and incentives for good behavior that allows the system to operate with a radically different trust model. This raises important questions for permissioned distributed systems, which rely on a trusted third party. These systems give up on the key innovation of Bitcoin and, so, must bring some other benefit to the table. While a number of benefits has been claimed, such as programmability or the ability to operate twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, year-round, there is little evidence that these benefits are unique to permissioned distributed ledger systems in practice, at least so far.\n\nHow to cite this post:\n\nAnders Brownworth, Jon Durfee, Michael Lee, and Antoine Martin, \u201cWhat Makes Cryptocurrencies Different?,\u201d Federal Reserve Bank of New York Liberty Street Economics, August 16, 2023, https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2023/08/what-makes-cryptocurrencies-different/.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views expressed in this post are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the position of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.

        "content": "The total number of inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain has surpassed 24 million.\n\nBitcoin NFTs were no more in the top five with respect to volume.\n\nOver the past few months, Bitcoin Ordinals witnessed an interplay of highs and lows, marking significant shifts in the ecosystem. At press time, the total inscriptions minted till data had surpassed 24 million.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nBottoms through the peaks\n\nData from Dune Analytics showed that BTC Ordinals crossing the 24 million landmark could be linked to a hike in daily inscriptions. On 14 August, the daily inscriptions minted on the Bitcoin blockchain was 317, 350. This represented the highest number over the last week.\n\nBut before the recent increase, Bitcoin Ordinals witnessed a down season. For instance, on 2, 12, and 22 July, the number of inscriptions stood at an extremely low level and did not edge any closer to the peaks. On 7 and 8 August, the situation continued.\n\nThe decline in the aforementioned times explains how interest in Bitcoin Ordinals subdued. Furthermore, the activity rate was also not as impressive as in the first quarter (Q1). Thus, the decrease meant that users\u2019 creation of Bitcoin-native Digital Artifacts fell.\n\nRecall that Ordinals, put forward by Casy Rodarmor, emerged around the first three months of the year. And despite the controversy around the application on the Bitcoin network, its adoption skyrocketed.\n\nA twist of fate for Ordinals\n\nIntroducing recursive inscriptions to the blockchain significantly impacted the technology. For context, recursive inscriptions are features of the Bitcoin blockchain that allows for the creation of complex data structures that can be stored on the blockchain.\n\nFurthermore, developers noted that they will create a chain of inscriptions with the introduction of recursive inscriptions in July. Additionally, each of these references data was created previously, from existing inscriptions.\n\nAs a result, thousands of recursive inscriptions made it to the Bitcoin blockchain. At the time of writing, assets inscribed in text format topped the inscription created to date. Images came second while applications did not account for much.\n\nDespite making as much as $56 million in fees, Bitcoin Ordinals have been yanked off the NFT top standings. At some point, Bitcoin NFT sales threatened to take Ethereum [ETH] off the top spot.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nUnfortunately, the blockchain has not been able to maintain that momentum. At press time, Bitcoin had dropped to 7th in terms of the volume registered by each blockchain. The fall reinforced the notion that interest in Bitcoin Ordinals and NFTs at large had reduced."

        "content": "In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, the term \u201cbull run\u201d often creates excitement among crypto enthusiasts and traders. A bull run occurs when the price of a cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, rises significantly over a relatively short period, fueled by increased demand, positive sentiment, and other market factors. In this comprehensive guide, we delve into the factors that some analysts consider when predicting a Bitcoin bull run, as well as research findings from various sources. We\u2019ll also discuss some of the top coins to explore before the next crypto bull market and discuss some of the leading crypto projects worth learning about ahead of the Bitcoin bull run.\n\nList of Top Crypto Bull Run Predictions\n\nBelow is a list of events that many crypto analysts are interested in when discussing bull runs.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Upcoming Halving: Scheduled for April 2024, the Bitcoin halving event is expected to reduce the supply of new Bitcoins entering the market, which historically correlates with bull market periods.\n\nEthereum 2.0 Upgrade: The final stages of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, set to be completed by the end of 2023, could enhance scalability and have an effect on Ethereum adoption.\n\nMaturation of Crypto Infrastructure: As crypto infrastructure matures, decentralized applications (dApps) could reach a broader user base. ApeMax is one of these exciting new coins and dApps that is quickly emerging.\n\nConvergence of Crypto, AI, and the Metaverse: Some analysts believe that the integration of crypto with artificial intelligence (AI) and the metaverse could spur rapid growth and innovation in the crypto space.\n\nIt is essential to note that these predictions are speculative, and the crypto market is highly unpredictable, and that no one can foresee the future. You should approach these forecasts with skepticism and conduct thorough independent research.\n\nWhat is ApeMax?\n\nApeMax is an innovative cryptocurrency that has gained attention in the crypto community for its unique features. Token holders can engage in decentralized staking, known as Boost-to-Earn, to securely stake their tokens on entities they like and earn rewards transparently. ApeMax combines fun and utility, with seamless staking features and intriguing tokenomics, making it an interesting and fun contender among new meme coins.\n\nIn a nutshell, ApeMax offers:\n\nBoost-to-Earn Staking: ApeMax users can engage in decentralized staking, known as Boost-to-Earn. This feature allows token holders to securely stake their tokens on entities they\u2019re fans of, creating a decentralized ecosystem of backers and projects.

Token holders can immediately access the staking process and potentially earn rewards even during the presale phase. ApeMax\u2019s presale price increases every 24 hours, and eligible buyers can acquire Early Birds Loot Boxes, enjoying discounts on ApeMax tokens.\n\nWhat is a bitcoin bull run?\n\nA bitcoin bull run is a period of substantial upward price movement and market optimism for Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin experiences significant growth, often exceeding previous highs and attracting increased interest. Bull runs are typically driven by increased adoption, institutional interest, positive news developments, and market speculation. However, they come with volatility, inherent risks, and are difficult to predict.\n\nIs a bitcoin bull run coming?\n\nPredicting the occurrence of a bitcoin bull run is no easy task due to the complex and volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market. Analysts who have studied past bull runs believe that a variety of factors have contributed to past bull runs, including but not limited to:\n\nInstitutional Adoption: The increasing acceptance and holding of Bitcoin by institutional investors have significantly boosted its price in the past. When large financial institutions back Bitcoin, it has often led to a surge in demand and a potential bull run.\n\nMainstream Acceptance: As more businesses and retailers start accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment, its mainstream acceptance grows, fueling optimism and potentially driving the price up.\n\nMarket Trends: Historical market trends can sometimes provide insights into potential future bull runs. However, past performance does not guarantee future results, and trends should be analyzed with caution.\n\nBitcoin Halving Events: Historically, Bitcoin halving events, where the rewards for miners are reduced, have been associated with bull runs. The reduced supply of new Bitcoins can create a sense of scarcity.\n\nIt is essential to remember that the cryptocurrency market is highly unpredictable and influenced by a wide range of variables, making it impossible to forecast with certainty. You should conduct comprehensive research and exercise prudence when making cryptocurrency-related decisions.\n\nWhy is the crypto bull run every 4 years?\n\nThe occurrence of a crypto bull run every four years is often linked to the Bitcoin halving event, which takes place approximately every four years. The halving reduces mining rewards by 50%, decreasing the supply of new Bitcoins and creating a scarcity effect that may have historically had an effect on price. However, while this pattern has been observed in the past, the crypto market is complex and influenced by various factors, making future bull run predictions uncertain.\n\nImportant Warning\n\nBefore purchasing cryptocurrencies, conduct thorough independent research, exercise caution, consult unbiased experts, and understand the risks involved. Cryptocurrencies may not be suitable for everyone and carry high risks and volatility. The purchase of ApeMax tokens is not permitted for individuals in the United States, Canada, sanctioned countries, and other ineligible countries.

        "content": "Our friend has been scammed out of \u00a3180,000 after responding to a fake bitcoin trading ad on Facebook appearing to feature (misleadingly) money expert Martin Lewis.\n\nThis happened last December, but she recently asked me to help as I was a senior compliance officer at a leading bank before retiring to Spain.\n\nI suggested she complain to Revolut because the scammer had persuaded her to open an account with this firm and made several payments into it.\n\nBut Revolut will not accept her complaint, stating that she would have received online warnings.\n\nThere were also multiple payments to a firm called Ibinex, which is not regulated in the UK. Her retirement hopes are in tatters. Can you help? M.S., Spain.\n\nBit-con: A bitcoin scammer cheated a reader's friend out of \u00a3180,000 using a phoney advert featuring money expert Martin Lewis\n\nSally Hamilton replies: Perhaps one day I'll stop receiving cries for help from victims of crypto scams, but sadly they are still coming in thick and fast, and will persist so long as convincing ads like the one your friend saw appear on social media.\n\nPeople have been duped by phoney ads featuring Martin Lewis for several years. In a bid to stamp them out, he sued Facebook in 2018 for defamation and won \u00a33 million, which he gave to a charity for fraud victims.\n\nA recent BBC investigation rumbled a scam that was using his name (and those of other celebrities) to promote its dodgy practices. It is possible your friend fell into this net.\n\nYour friend explained to me how just before Christmas, she saw the ad on Facebook showing pictures of Martin Lewis on the TV show Good Morning Britain and promising tips on how to trade.\n\nShe clicked on a link which asked for her details, including a phone number. An 'educational website' called to say it could teach her how to trade in crypto for an initial investment of $250 (about \u00a3200).\n\nAn account manager called Austin King conversed with her over WhatsApp and asked her to download software called AnyDesk, which let him take control of her computer and open an account for her with Revolut.\n\nShe was then persuaded to open an account with crypto platform Binance. A few days later, $65 (\u00a350) was transferred into her Revolut account \u2014 described by Austin as her profit so far.\n\nThis technique is used to build trust, and it worked \u2014 giving her confidence to part with more money.\n\nI have lost all of our retirement money and my marriage is hanging in the balance. Every penny was worked hard for. There was no inheritance, no windfall. I am such an idiot Scam victim\n\nSoon afterwards, Austin called to warn your friend her account would collapse if she did not top it up.\n\nAlthough now anxious and suspicious, she sent yet more money, this time to Ibinex, an Estonian crypto website.\n\nIt was only when her funds had been drained that she finally woke up to the full extent of the deceit and reported the fraud, in March, to Revolut.\n\nShe told me: 'I have lost all of our retirement money and my marriage is hanging in the balance. Every penny was worked hard for. There was no inheritance, no windfall. I am such an idiot.'\n\nAlthough she should have spotted the danger signs sooner, I feel very sorry for her. Only those who have been trapped in such a sophisticated web of lies know how convincing such a fraud can be.\n\nI was not satisfied with Revolut's response. Money Mail reported recently that this firm, which offers current account services but is not yet a licenced bank in the UK, has featured in many fraud complaints, with criminals often convincing victims to open a Revolut account.\n\nThis might be because cryptocurrency purchases are permitted via Revolut, when some other banks have either banned or limited the sums that can be spent on the investment.\n\nOn my request, Revolut reopened your case to see if it could have done more to protect you.\n\nIts response was not good news. Although the firm conceded your friend had been duped by 'ruthless and highly sophisticated criminals', it refused to reimburse her losses on the basis that she overrode two warnings.\n\nShe defended her actions, telling me the scammer had convinced her there was not a problem.\n\nStraight to the point I tried to renew my \u00a3160 road tax online but my attempt seemed to be unsuccessful, so I went to the Post Office to pay it in person. It turned out I paid twice but I'm struggling to get a refund. R. S., Vale of Glamorgan. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency investigated and it quickly organised your \u00a3160 refund. *** I Bought a pair of orthopaedic shoes for \u00a325 from Yours Clothing but I haven't received them.

Yodel apologises that your parcel was not delivered safely. Yours Clothing has also refunded you for the missing shoes. *** I booked a villa in Naxos, Greece, for June 2020 via Airbnb and paid a deposit of \u00a31,400. When the pandemic began, I contacted Airbnb but it would not refund me. The villa host said I could come once the pandemic was over, but when I tried to rebook the property it had doubled in price. The host will not refund my deposit. V. C., Warwickshire. Airbnb says you were not eligible for a refund under its Covid-19 policy and the host provided this credit as a goodwill gesture. Your new dates were during peak season, so the price was higher. Hosts set their own prices and cancellation policies, so you are not due a refund.\n\nA Revolut spokesman says: 'We take our responsibility to protect and support our customers extremely seriously and have made significant investments in our systems, processes and people to ensure our customers are safe.'\n\nRevolut states that financial institutions and banks are usually the last link in the chain, and that a fraud has already been committed before they are involved.\n\nThis may be so, but I would argue they are also the last bastion of security for customers and should do more to protect innocent victims \u2014 and if this can't be done, then to reimburse their losses.\n\nI approached Lloyds Bank, where your friend held her current account from where the unusual spending pattern surely must have set off alarm bells. It turned out she had not complained to Lloyds because she had felt it was Revolut's responsibility.\n\nI asked Lloyds to investigate. It took a couple of weeks, but the welcome news came back that it would reimburse your friend almost all her losses: a total of \u00a3179,000.\n\nA Lloyds spokesman says: 'We carefully review the individual details of each case reported to us in line with the industry scam code and do all we can to get back the money that a victim has lost to fraudsters.\n\n'While we did intervene more than once to block payments and warn that she was being scammed, we also appreciate this was a sophisticated fraud and have agreed to refund the vast majority of the money that she lost.'\n\nAll in all, your friend was lucky. Transfers made by bank customers to an account held in another bank in their own name \u2014 known as 'me2me' payments \u2014 are not covered by the Contingent Reimbursement Model Code, the industry arrangement designed to protect victims of authorised push payment fraud.\n\nRevolut is not part of this scheme but says it applies the same standards to its customers \u2014 though it seemingly felt your friend's case did not meet its criteria.\n\nAnyone tempted by an investment ad should make checks first. Always consult the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) register of legitimate firms at fca.org.uk to ensure the operation is regulated in the UK. If your bank issues warnings, then heed them.\n\nMeanwhile, social media companies must do more to banish these wicked ads at source. David Postings, head of UK Finance, recently urged them to step up after the banking body published its annual fraud report revealing that three-quarters of authorised push payment scams begin on social media platforms.\n\nIn it, he says: 'Relying on the banking sector alone to reimburse victims of fraud means the platforms that facilitate the majority of the fraud have no financial incentive to stop it.'\n\nSome relief should soon be at hand from the Online Safety Bill progressing through Parliament, as it will demand social media platforms remove scam ads.\n\nA spokesman for Facebook, says: 'We don't want anyone to fall victim to these criminals which is why our platforms have systems to block scams and financial services advertisers now have to be FCA-authorised to target UK users. We also work with the police to support their investigations and encourage people to report this content when they see it so we can take action.'\n\nA final word of warning. It can be hard to escape once caught in a scammer's web. After your friends' funds were returned, the crooks rang her again, aggressively demanding $54,000. This time she knew what to do \u2014 and slammed down the phone."

        "content": "As the period of stagnation continues to pressure the majority of assets in the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin (BTC) at below $29,000 is no exception, and the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset is also recording the lowest trading volume in recorded history.\n\nIndeed, the monthly trading volume of Bitcoin on major crypto exchanges has recently plummeted to its lowest level on the five-year chart, according to the latest information retrieved from the Bitcoin analytics platform Bitcoinity on August 17.\n\nBitcoin trading volume 5-year chart. Source: Bitcoinity\n\nAs it happens, in the last 30 days, the trading volume of the maiden cryptocurrency totaled 386,423.1 BTC or roughly $11 billion based on the current price of Bitcoin, which at press time stood at around $28,547, while the 24-hour volume reached 16,583,613,023 BTC, as the most recent charts indicate.\n\nWhat this means\n\nAccording to the analysis by X user WhaleWire, such a low trading volume for the largest crypto asset by market capitalization has several implications, including waning investor interest, new volatility risks, and the possibility of stagnation.\n\nFurthermore, the analyst explained that the reduced trading activity could lead to a decreased ease of buying and selling Bitcoin at market price, as well as creating an environment of increased likelihood for price manipulation and shaken market confidence.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, the current price of Bitcoin indicates a decline of 2.1% in the last 24 hours, a 3.22% loss across the previous seven days, adding up to the 5.01% drop on its monthly chart, according to the latest data retrieved by Finbold on August 17.\n\nBitcoin 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAll things considered, the low trading volume could, indeed, trigger the start or help continue the above indicators and ultimately lead to more bearishness for Bitcoin and further declines in its price, at least in the short term, whereas multiple analysts predict new all-time highs (ATHs).\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
