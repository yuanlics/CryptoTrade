        "content": "Nearly a dozen new investments funds that hold Bitcoin began trading last week, making it easier for anyone with a basic brokerage account to buy a slice of the digital currency.\n\nSeveral established financial institutions, including Fidelity and BlackRock, have coalesced around Bitcoin because it is the world\u2019s first and largest cryptocurrency.\n\nBut Bitcoin remains an enigma to most everyday investors, and it\u2019s hard to separate the buzz from any true potential. It\u2019s also wildly volatile.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s a bet. And institutions are wagering that plenty of investors want in.\n\nBut putting crypto into a traditional investment wrapper does not paper over the underlying risks. Here\u2019s a look at how it works:\n\nWhat is an exchange-traded fund?\n\nExchange-traded funds are similar to mutual funds, but they can be traded on an exchange like a stock. E.T.F.s track the performance of the assets they hold, which might include a diversified basket of securities like stock or bonds, or even single commodities, like gold, silver and crypto."

        "title": "This Investing Phenomenon Could Be Why Bitcoin Prices Are Down After ETF Approval - Money",
        "content": "Bitcoin began the year primed for growth. Big things were on the horizon in 2024 \u2014 including the long-awaited approval of bitcoin spot ETFs. But the cryptocurrency community notched that victory in early January, and bitcoin isn\u2019t hurtling into the stratosphere. In fact, it has lost $7,000 in value since the news broke.\n\nThe decline of bitcoin prices despite this recent development might come as a surprise to some, but it\u2019s actually a great example of a broader financial phenomenon in which investments perform poorly in the face of good news.\n\nHere\u2019s why that happens \u2014 and what you should know about buying bitcoin right now.\n\nBitcoin drops in days following spot ETF approvals\n\nOn Jan. 10, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission gave the crypto market exactly what it wanted: approval for a spot bitcoin ETF. These exchange-traded funds allow investors to get exposure to bitcoin\u2019s steep rises (and its troughs) without having to actually own the asset, so crypto optimists expected them to bring in lots of new capital (BTW: Financial advisors generally suggest investors devote no more than 5% of their portfolio to risky assets like crypto).\n\nThe news was massive, given that bitcoin fans have been asking for these ETFs for years. The fervor reached a peak recently, with Grayscale taking the SEC to court over its denial of the company\u2019s ETF and finance giants like BlackRock and Fidelity applying for their own. In total, 11 companies saw their applications approved. Crypto enthusiasts predicted a 2021-esque bull run.\n\nIndeed, in the days after the SEC's approval, over $2 billion flowed into bitcoin ETFs. But bitcoin prices themselves sunk. Immediately afterward, the crypto shot up by about $3,000 to a price of $48,600; since then, it has dropped down to $41,000 \u2014 its lowest price since early December.\n\nHow 'selling the news' turns good news into losses\n\nCryptocurrency prices are far more volatile than stocks, but their general movement tends to align closely with the stock market. It makes sense, then, that the crypto market suffers from many of the same peculiarities as stocks. One such quirk is that if a stock performs strongly during earnings season, smashing expectations, there\u2019s a chance that shares will still depreciate.\n\nThis counterintuitive phenomenon is caused by \u201cselling the news,\u201d or the act of profit-taking by shareholders after good news breaks. Active investors might opt to take the short-term profits of good news instead of holding on for future gains. It\u2019s not an act that\u2019s inherently harmful when done by an individual, but a large group of traders selling their shares at once can easily influence prices.\n\nAnd when a group of sellers is larger than the group of potential investors, the flood of shares back into the market can cause a shift in supply and demand that drives share prices lower as a result.\n\nThis helps to explain how bitcoin suffered at the hands of its own success. Bitcoin spot ETFs have been sought out for over 10 years (and for the last two years especially). As it became increasingly more probable that these ETFs would see approval in January, it\u2019s likely that active traders loaded up on bitcoin ahead of time with the expectation that they could take profits on the post-approval boom.\n\nWe can see this reflected in not just the price of bitcoin declining but also the billions of dollars in outflows from exchanges and crypto funds. Grayscale reportedly saw over $2 billion in liquidations from its bitcoin-trust-turned-bitcoin-ETF after the SEC approved it.\n\nAll said, does the decline in bitcoin\u2019s signal that the ETF news isn\u2019t actually as good as once believed? Not really.\n\nExperts still anticipate spot funds for bitcoin will unlock the market for a ton of new investors and send prices back toward all-time highs. They see these losses as just a small setback in the bullish bigger picture; if anything, potential bitcoin investors may take the opportunity to buy bitcoin while it's quote-unquote \"discounted.\"\n\nNewsletter Make smarter money decisions in just a few minutes every day Subscribe to Daily Money to get more of the latest personal finance news, stories, and analysis delivered everyday to your inbox.

        "title": "$13.9B traded in Bitcoin ETFs during week one. - S&P Global",
        "content": "DOWNLOAD PDF VERSION HERE\n\nAfter one week, $13.9B has been traded across the newly approved ETFs. The first week of data has started to show some clear trends.\n\nOn January 10th, 2024, the SEC approved eleven US-Listed exchange traded funds (ETFs) that invest in Bitcoin. This has opened up a new asset class for many investors, as the move has simplified the process of gaining direct exposure to the cryptocurrency. The ease of investing in Bitcoin through an ETF structure will not only increase the popularity of this asset class but is also likely to catapult it into the financial mainstream. One week after these new ETFs started trading, and following $1.15B of net flows, some interesting trends have started to emerge.\n\nFund flow data for week one (01/11/24 - 01/18/24):\n\nThe iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ($1.2B) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) ($1B) experienced the largest inflows across all newly formed ETFs during the first week of trading. Blackrock and Fidelity have proved popular amongst investors, receiving a combined 68% of all week one inflows (BITI 37%, FBTC 31%).\n\nThe iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was the first of the group to amass more than $1B in assets, accumulating the largest inflows during the week, and boasting an AUM of $1.17B on January 18th. The value of both ETFs combined inflows ($2.2B) was equal to the value of the outflows seen across the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) ($2.2B) during the period.\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) experienced $2,216.3B of outflows during the week. This ETF was the only fund to experience daily outflows during its first week of trading. The meteoric rise in the price of Bitcoin, which pushed ever higher as investors anticipated the approval of these new funds, is believed to have led to profit taking by existing investors in the former closed-end fund. Now converted, existing units can now be traded freely on exchange which lowers the bid /offer spread for investors who would have previously had to trade over the counter, often at a substantial discount to the Bitcoin price.\n\nFund flows have been affected by the decision of some Bitcoin ETF issuers to charge 0% fees for a limited amount of time, with the agreement to raise them when a defined AUM is reached. The majority of the funds are expected to charge between 0.2% and 0.4% in the future. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) continues to charge 1.5%, stating its track record as its differentiating competitive factor. When looking outside the fee, the Grayscale ETF had the lowest average trading spread across the group during the week and experienced the highest trading volumes and values (as seen in the graph below). This suggests that liquidity and price remain important factors for a substantial proportion of the investor base.\n\nAcross all of the newly approved ETFs, the Hashdex Bitcoin Future ETF (DEFI) experienced the lowest traded value over the week ($7.1M). This fund continues to trade Bitcoin futures rather than physical assets. After the fanfare of the most recent approvals, it appears that investors' appetites for the futures equivalent, now that they can access the real thing, are muted.\n\nThe Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) appears to be the ETF of choice when speculating on the price of Bitcoin. As of January 19th, just over 11% of the ETF's shares were borrowed. This is often used as a proxy for short selling, where speculators sell a borrowed stock in anticipation of the price falling, before buying it back at a lower price. This ETF had a significantly higher percentage of its outstanding shares on loan in comparison to the other funds.\n\nSince the launch of these new products the price of Bitcoin has dropped circa 11%. How that impacts investor flows and demand going forward remains to be seen. During the first week of trading, investors have shown a clear interest in the asset class with $13.9B traded and two dominant front runners seen in iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC).\n\nAs the initial flood of new money starts to slow, the landscape is likely to remain competitive. Given the level of investor demand and the fact that the asset class does not provide a yield as returns are based solely upon pricing speculation, these most recently approved ETFs are likely to represent the start of a growing trend of investment strategies to generate returns across this increasingly popular asset class.\n\nFor more information on how to access this data set, please contact the sales team at:\n\nh-ihsm-global-equitysalesspecialists@spglobal.com\n\nS&P Global provides industry-leading data, software and technology platforms and managed services to tackle some of the most difficult challenges in financial markets.

        "content": "Cryptocurrency investors spent much of 2023 waiting for good news. Following the late 2022 collapse of FTX \u2014 at the time the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange \u2014 popular digital currency bitcoin traded just north of $16,000 to start the year, a far cry from the more than $60,000 it traded for during 2021's crypto boom. Over the last few months, though, things began looking up. Crypto investors became more and more convinced that the SEC would approve a years-long effort from fund companies to bring a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund to market, a move crypto boosters expected to stoke demand for the popular coin. By the time news broke on Jan. 10 that 11 new bitcoin ETFs would begin trading, crypto investors were taking a victory lap, having bid the coin's price up by 155% in calendar year 2023. So, what now? Are we off to another crypto bull market, or have bitcoin enthusiasts gotten ahead of themselves? \"This is definitely an inflection point,\" says Brian Vendig, president of MJP Wealth Advisors in Westport, Connecticut. Here's what he and other experts say to expect from here.\n\nExpect more demand, and more new funds\n\nThe new wave of bitcoin ETFs makes it easier than ever for investors in more traditional assets, such as stocks and bonds, to dip their toes into crypto. Instead of having to open a separate account to buy crypto \u2014 often with high trading fees \u2014 investors in the ETFs can hold bitcoin right alongside their other investments in their brokerage accounts. That's just the beginning, says Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, an investment firm that offers one of the 11 new funds. \"We think it was a huge step forward that will unlock significant demand, given the cost savings for the retail buyer and security available to institutional purchasers,\" he says. The new ETFs will soon allow advisors who deal with high net worth clients and big money institutions to start incorporating crypto into their portfolios, he adds. \"They don't have the ability to put these bitcoin ETFs into client discretionary portfolios, yet,\" Sigel says. \"But we can observe several banks and brokers already preparing these models, which we expect to emerge later this year.\" Expect more new crypto ETFs, too \u2014 and in different flavors. \"It seems inevitable that we'll have ETFs tied to ether, as a secondary cryptocurrency for people to invest in,\" says Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFI. In the meantime, he says, \"the door is now open for a range of ETFs that include bitcoin as well as other assets.\" Experts say these might be as simple as portfolios that combine bitcoin exposure with mainstream investments, such as those in the S&P 500. More complex so-called alternative strategies are likely to emerge as well, such as funds that use a bitcoin holding to hedge against the performance of other investments.\n\nThe outlook for crypto: 'It's all still speculation'"

        "title": "1 Top Bitcoin ETF to Buy Before the Crypto Market Soars 300%, According to a Wall Street Analyst - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is currently worth $1.6 trillion, and Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) accounts for 50% of that total. Bitcoin dominance (i.e., the market value attributable to Bitcoin) was also 50% five years ago, though it has ranged from 38% to 70% during that time period.\n\nWith that in mind, Morningstar analyst Michael Miller expects the cryptocurrency market to soar 300% to $6.4 trillion by 2032. If Bitcoin dominance stays at 50%, the implied upside for Bitcoin would also be 300%. Alternatively, the implied upside would be closer to 200% if Bitcoin dominance slipped to 38%, and the implied upside would be closer 460% if Bitcoin dominance increased to 70%.\n\nRegardless, cryptocurrency bulls have good reason to invest in Bitcoin, and that can be done in a few ways. The most obvious method is a cryptocurrency exchange like Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN). But creating and managing an account may be a headache, especially for investors with existing brokerage accounts.\n\nFortunately, a new type of investment product eliminates that friction: spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs reduce friction for investors\n\nEarlier this month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, funds that track the price of Bitcoin. That landmark decision could draw more retail and institutional investors to the market, and the influx of capital could drive the price of Bitcoin much higher in the years ahead.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs are particularly attractive because they eliminate the headache of managing multiple accounts. Investors no longer need to buy Bitcoin through a specialized exchange, nor do they have to worry about storing the cryptocurrency with a blockchain wallet. Instead, spot Bitcoin ETFs make it possible to add Bitcoin exposure to existing brokerage accounts. That convenience is why spot Bitcoin ETFs could drive the price of the cryptocurrency higher.\n\nFor context, analysts at Bernstein believe the price per Bitcoin could reach $150,000 by 2025, implying 252% upside from its current price of $42,600. Similarly, analysts at Standard Chartered Bank believe the price per Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by 2025, implying 369% upside.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe best (and worst) spot Bitcoin ETFs\n\nGenerally speaking, all spot Bitcoin ETFs do the same thing. They purchase Bitcoin from a cryptocurrency exchange (often Coinbase), divide the Bitcoin into shares, and sell those shares on the stock market. In other words, this is not a situation where a team of experienced asset managers could create substantial value for fund holders by trading the right securities at the right times.\n\nFor that reason, buy-and-hold investors should focus on fees or expense ratios. As mentioned, the SEC has approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, but fees vary widely between certain funds, as detailed below:\n\nBitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust (NYSEMKT: BITB): 0.20%\n\nArk 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKB): 0.21%\n\nFidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (NYSEMKT: FBTC): 0.25%\n\niShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ: IBIT): 0.25%\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Fund (NASDAQ: BRRR): 0.25%\n\nVanEck Bitcoin Trust (NYSEMKT: HODL): 0.25%\n\nFranklin Templeton Digital Trust (NYSEMKT: EZBC): 0.29%\n\nWisdomTree Bitcoin Trust (NYSEMKT: BTCW): 0.3%\n\nInvesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BATS-CHIXE: BTCO): 0.39%\n\nHashdex Bitcoin ETF (NYSEMKT: DEFI): 0.94%\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust (NYSEMKT: GBTC): 1.5%\n\nPersonally, I would eliminate the bottom half of that list based on fees alone, and none more so than the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. There is simply no reason to pay 1.5% for an ETF -- that means investors would pay $15 annually on every $1,000 invested -- when an identical product could be purchased for a fraction of that cost.\n\nNext, I would consider the issuer behind the ETF. Several funds listed above are run by asset managers with plenty of experience, including Ark Invest and Fidelity. But the iShares Bitcoin Trust would be my top choice, because the fund is run by BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world.\n\nTo be clear, the issuer should matter very little, but ETFs run by larger asset managers may be less prone to liquidity problems arising from insufficient demand. For instance, the iShares Bitcoin Trust finished Jan. 18 at a 0.08% premium to its net asset value. That means investors are valuing the ETF at a 0.08% premium to the price of Bitcoin. That points to strong demand. Conversely, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust traded at a 0.27% discount to its net asset value, which hints at weaker demand.\n\nHere's the bottom line: I would avoid spot Bitcoin ETFs with an expense ratio above 0.25%, and I would absolutely avoid the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, simply because there are less expensive alternatives. Building on that, I would feel comfortable buying the spot Bitcoin ETFs run by Ark, BlackRock, and Fidelity, but the iShares Bitcoin Trust would be my first choice.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Bitcoin wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Print this page\n\nA false post on the official X social media page of the US Securities and Exchange Commission that prematurely claimed it had approved new bitcoin investment products appeared after a hacker took control of the mobile phone number linked to the account, according to the regulator.\n\nThe widely shared post on January 9 saying that the SEC had given the green light to the first bitcoin exchange traded funds momentarily sent the cryptocurrency sector into a frenzy. It was quickly disavowed by the agency, which announced its bona fide approvals a day later.\n\nThe SEC on Monday said it determined that an unauthorised party had deployed an apparent \u201cSIM swap\u201d, which involves transferring a mobile phone number to a different device without the owner\u2019s permission. The password for the SEC\u2019s account on X was then changed.\n\nThe number transfer occurred via the telecommunications carrier rather than through the agency\u2019s systems, the SEC said. The regulator added it had not found any evidence that the hacker gained access to its systems, devices, data or other social media accounts.\n\nThe agency also disclosed that X in July had disabled multi-factor authentication at the SEC\u2019s request \u201cdue to issues accessing the account\u201d. The procedure was reinstated after the page was breached and was enabled for all SEC social media accounts offering such authentication, the regulator said.\n\nThe mishap was an embarrassment for the agency after its chair Gary Gensler made cyber security a pillar of his agenda, adopting rules that require businesses be more vigilant about cyber risks.\n\nWhile the hack was not serious by cyber standards, given that it did not affect the SEC\u2019s own systems, analysts found the absence of two-factor authentication, first disclosed by X, to be an easily avoidable faux pas. \u201cWe encourage all users to enable this extra layer of security,\u201d X said the day of the incident.\n\nThe fake post came as Wall Street eagerly awaited SEC authorisation of the first-ever spot bitcoin ETFs, which enable ordinary investors to hold the cryptocurrency in their brokerage accounts. Gensler has expressed scepticism over crypto, calling the markets the \u201cwild west\u201d.\n\nGensler has adopted a tough enforcement stance against crypto and argued that many digital tokens are securities that fall directly within the agency\u2019s purview. The SEC already regulates ETFs.\n\nThe day of the hack, Gensler posted on his own X account 10 minutes after the fake post was published, saying the regulator\u2019s account had been \u201ccompromised\u201d and no ETF approvals had been granted.\n\nThe regulator on Monday said it was still co-ordinating with law enforcement as well as federal agencies including the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. According to the SEC, the probe\u2019s focus includes how the hacker had the telecoms carrier change the SIM and how they became aware of the account\u2019s number."

ETF options saw average daily volumes amounting to roughly 17.9 million contracts in 2023, according to Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) data \u2014 a 12% increase from the prior year.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin ETF Tracker\n\nThe Cboe Options Exchange submitted a proposal to the SEC on Jan. 5 seeking to list options on exchange-traded products (ETPs) that hold bitcoin. The filing came about a week before the regulator officially greenlit such ETFs.\n\nNYSE Arca and Nasdaq followed suit days later, separate disclosures indicate.\n\nThough Cboe\u2019s rules generally permit it to list options on ETPs three days after they start trading, they don\u2019t apply to such products holding commodities like BTC, the company said in a filing.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\n\u201cCboe intends to list these options as soon as all regulatory approvals are received, which is expected later in 2024,\u201d the company noted.\n\nThe SEC noted in Jan. 19 filings that it would seek comments on the three stock exchanges\u2019 proposals during a 21-day period.\n\nThe Nasdaq-related filing refers directly to BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). The exchange would open at least one expiration month for options on the trust. It could also list such options for trading on a weekly or quarterly basis.\n\nNasdaq believes that options on IBIT would offer investors \u201can additional, relatively lower cost investing tool to gain exposure to spot bitcoin as well as a hedging vehicle to meet their investment needs in connection with bitcoin products and positions,\u201d the disclosure states.\n\n\n\nRead more: BlackRock beats spot bitcoin ETF rivals in race to $1B assets\n\nChase White is a senior analyst at Compass Point Research and Trading. He told Blockworks that options on the spot bitcoin ETFs are likely to appeal to institutional investors looking to hedge their downside risk in the funds, whether they\u2019re long or short the ETFs.\n\n\u201cWe also expect some level of institutional investor speculation via the options, because many of them don\u2019t have the mandate to transact in options [and] derivatives directly tied to BTC \u2014 much like they don\u2019t have the mandate to trade BTC itself,\u201d White said.\n\nAs more financial advisers start to allocate a portion of client funds to the ETFs, such professionals could use options to protect against downside risk without having to take taxable gains on the ETF positions, he added.\n\nMatt Lason, chief investment officer of crypto hedge fund Globe 3 Capital, said options on spot bitcoin ETFs reflect the \u201cnatural progression of financial instruments\u201d given that \u201cthe dam has broken open\u201d following the SEC\u2019s approval of such funds.\n\nRead more: The crypto world reacts to day one of bitcoin spot ETF trading\n\n\u201cWe believe the SEC would be quick to allow the listing of options on spot bitcoin ETFs as it does not require the ownership of the underlying asset,\u201d he told Blockworks. \u201cEven though these options and derivatives do not create direct ownership in bitcoin, it brings additional liquidity to bitcoin, and that is the more important piece of the equation for this asset.\u201d\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart said in an X post last week the SEC could allow options on spot bitcoin ETFs by the end of February. The regulator, however, could wait until as late as September to make a decision, he added.\n\nBecause the ETFs were approved and are already trading, the SEC doesn\u2019t have a good legal reason to reject the applications, White argued.\n\nHe added: \u201cGiven it\u2019s an election year, the SEC will probably not want to do anything controversial close to the election, so we tend to think we\u2019ll get approvals sometime before summer.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "This Bitcoin News May Spell Trouble for MicroStrategy in 2024. Here's Why - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Huge news rocked the cryptocurrency sector last week. After many years of waiting, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved investment companies to start listing Bitcoin ETFs that people can buy or sell to get exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency. Now, there are numerous ETFs that anyone reading this can buy and sell, such as the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF.\n\nWhile new ETFs will make it easier -- for better or worse -- for people to get exposure to Bitcoin, this could spell trouble for certain companies in the crypto space. One is Coinbase, which earns large trading fees when people buy or sell crypto on its platform. Another is MicroStrategy (MSTR -5.06%), a software company that has pivoted in recent years to bet big on the future of Bitcoin. Here's why these new ETFs may have just ruined MicroStrategy's Bitcoin pivot, and why it may spell trouble for the stock in 2024.\n\nMicroStrategy: Unprofitable software, betting on Bitcoin\n\nMicroStrategy came of age during the dot-com bubble. It sells business intelligence software, although it hasn't seen much success in recent years. Despite the huge boom in software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies over the past decade, MicroStrategy's software segment has struggled. Revenue has stagnated for years, and in fact, it's actually down compared to 10 years ago.\n\nThe segment is not consistently profitable, either. Over the first nine months of 2023, MicroStrategy has posted an operating loss of $72 million on just $372 million in revenue.\n\nYet MicroStrategy's stock is up over 250% in the last five years. Why? One word: Bitcoin. The company's former CEO, Michael Saylor, made a huge pivot to treat MicroStrategy as an investment vehicle for Bitcoin. According to its latest update, the company held 189,000 Bitcoin on its balance sheet, which has a value of $7.77 billion at the time of this writing. Given the enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies among a good chunk of the world's population, it is unsurprising to see MicroStrategy's shares up so much in the past few years.\n\nETFs spell trouble for its strategy\n\nBefore these ETFs, it was much harder for people to get exposure to Bitcoin without paying high trading fees. On platforms like Coinbase, you might have to pay 1% or more of your purchase in trading fees, which can add up if you are frequently buying and selling shares. MicroStrategy, as a separate publicly traded company that you can buy through commission-free brokerages, ended up as a bit of a loophole for investors looking to get exposure to Bitcoin. Why pay a 1% fee to Coinbase when you can get the same Bitcoin exposure by owning MicroStrategy?\n\nWell, that loophole looks unnecessary today with these new ETFs, some of which have annual fees as low as 0.20%. Now, anyone can easily get exposure to Bitcoin as simply as they would for a publicly traded company. With the software business losing money and probably worth little -- if anything at all -- to shareholders, shareholders in MicroStrategy are likely questioning their investment in the company.\n\nIf you add back the debt, the math doesn't make sense\n\nLet's say MicroStrategy was equivalent to a Bitcoin ETF. We can even add that you have confidence in Phong Le as the CEO and that you want to bet on him over the long term. Even if this were the case, MicroStrategy looks overvalued.\n\nKey Figure Value MicroStrategy Net Asset Value $5.7 billion MicroStrategy Market Cap $7.6 billion MicroStrategy Premium (discount) to Net Asset Value $1.9 billion\n\nIts Bitcoin holdings are currently worth $7.77 billion. Its market cap is roughly $7.6 billion at the time of this writing, which is slightly less than the spot value of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. But to buy this Bitcoin, MicroStrategy has taken out long-term debt worth $2.1 billion, which has an estimated annualized interest expense of $35.5 million. MicroStrategy will have to pay this debt back eventually (in dollars, I might add). Subtract this from its Bitcoin holdings, add back the $45 million in cash on the balance sheet, and MicroStrategy's net asset value held on its balance sheet is under $6 billion -- much lower than its market cap. And it still has an unprofitable software company and these interest payments that it will have to deal with every year going forward.\n\nInvestors are paying a significant premium when buying MicroStrategy if they want to get exposure to Bitcoin. With much easier methods emerging in these Bitcoin ETFs, it is likely that MicroStrategy shares will run into trouble in 2024. Avoid this stock right now -- there are much better ways to get exposure to Bitcoin these days."

Earlier, it fell to $39,414.80, its lowest level since Dec. 3. Ether dropped 5% to $2,333.00.\n\nBitcoin is still in its correction phase following the launch of several spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S. for the first time ever. In the months leading up to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission giving the green light to begin trading, investors bought bitcoin in anticipation of the approval.\n\n\"Today's bitcoin move is wholly expected,\" said Sylvia Jablonski, CEO and chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs. \"It looks like a 'sell-the-news' pullback, before we see the cryptocurrency recapturing its bullish trajectory.\""

        "content": "Blockchain hit the market in 2009 with the launch of the cryptocurrency bitcoin. In the context of bitcoin, the technology is an immutable and tamper-proof public ledger of transactions. Businesses have been looking to put these principles to use in other applications for blockchain, which is sometimes referred to as distributed ledger technology.\n\nOne of the concerns about the AI models \u2014 the kind that underpin applications like ChatGPT \u2014 is that the data they are trained on could contain biases or misinformation. That means the answers an AI system may give would contain those biases and false information.\n\nDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 Blockchain could be used to prevent bias in the data that artificial intelligence models are being trained on \u2014 and that could be a \"killer use case\" for the technology, executives told CNBC.\n\nIn the case of AI, training data can be put on the blockchain. That will allow the developers of the AI system to keep track of the data that the model has been trained on.\n\nCasper Labs, a business-focused blockchain firm, partnered with IBM this month to create such a system.\n\n\"The product that we are developing, the datasets are actually checkpointed and stored on the blockchain so you have a proof of how the AI is trained,\" Medha Parlikar, chief technology officer and co-founder of Casper Labs, told CNBC during a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week.\n\n\"And so as you use the AI, if it's learning and you find that the AI is starting to hallucinate, you can actually roll back the AI. And so you can undo some of the learning and go back to a previous version of the AI.\"\n\nHallucinations broadly refer to when an AI system gives out false information.\n\nBlockchain is a technology that has been spoken about for many years, and a host of industries ranging from finance to health care have been looking at ways to use it.\n\nSheila Warren, the CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, said, however, that a blockchain-based AI training data ledger could be the \"killer use case\" for the technology.\n\n\"I actually do think that the verification of an AI and sort of the checks and balances ... within an AI system, are going to be blockchain driven and blockchain backed,\" Warren told CNBC during the panel."

The report noted the ongoing outflows from GBTC are mounting pressure on the ETF to lower its fee structure.\n\nThe figure lies markedly above other key market players, with BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) both charging a competitive 0.25% fee.\n\nLow fees explain the draw from investors, with Bloomberg data revealing that IBIT received $371m from investors last Wednesday, closely followed by FBTC, witnessing a record $358m inflows, the largest single-day amount since its inception last week.\n\nBlackRock and Fidelity together have garnered 68% of the total inflows into the nine new ETFs in the market, amounting to nearly $2bn.\n\nThe report concluded that competition could pose a risk of further outflows from GBTC, with the ETF carrying the most expensive fee among its counterparts."

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission provided an update on Monday to a hacking incident from earlier this month that sent ripples through the crypto industry ahead of the agency\u2019s anticipated approval of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nIn a statement shared with Fortune, an SEC spokesperson said the agency was the victim of a \u201cSIM swap\u201d attack\u2014a technique in which cybercriminals convince mobile carriers to transfer phone numbers to a new account.\n\nWhile Monday\u2019s explanation provides additional context as to how a hacker gained unauthorized control of a key government office\u2019s social media account, the SEC said it\u2019s still working with law enforcement agencies to determine who carried out the attack.\n\nThe hack\n\nOn Jan. 9, crypto industry onlookers monitored SEC accounts for any notice of the agency\u2019s decision on Bitcoin ETFs, a financial vehicle that would allow investors to trade the popular cryptocurrency as shares on major exchanges. After years of rejecting applications for Bitcoin ETFs, the SEC was poised to approve the applications of a dozen-odd firms, including BlackRock.\n\nWhile analysts predicted the decision would come on Jan. 10, the SEC\u2019s official X (formerly Twitter) account made a surprising announcement just after markets closed on Jan. 9: The agency had approved every application. Many on the social media platform were celebrating.\n\nStill, something seemed off. There were no new filings to support the decisions, and the SEC did not post any updated news on its website. Soon after, Chair Gary Gensler posted on his own account that the SEC\u2019s account had been \u201ccompromised\u201d and that the agency had not yet approved the listing or trading of any of the ETFs.\n\nAs speculation swirled, SEC staff clarified that someone had gained unauthorized access to the agency\u2019s X account, and officials were working with law enforcement officials to find the culprit.\n\nCriticism poured in from all sides, with gleeful crypto advocates pointing to past SEC guidance on cybersecurity practices, and lawmakers from both parties calling for an investigation into what happened.\n\n\u2018Issues accessing the account\u2019\n\nThe SEC is still investigating how the hacker was able to persuade the carrier to change the SIM for its account, and how they knew which phone number was associated with the account.\n\nSIM swaps are often carried out through social engineering: A cybercriminal calls a cell phone provider such as T-Mobile and convinces an agent to transfer over the control of a phone number to a new SIM card. With control of the phone number, the attacker can reset passwords and take over the victim\u2019s accounts.\n\nThe attacks are common in crypto, with Vitalik Buterin\u2014the cofounder of Ethereum\u2014losing access to his X account in an incident in September, with a hacker posting a malicious link to Buterin\u2019s page and stealing over $691,000 from unsuspecting victims.\n\nOne protection against SIM swaps is multifactor authentication, which provides an additional layer of defense. According to the SEC spokesperson, the agency\u2019s X account had multifactor authentication enabled but removed it in July because of \u201cissues accessing the account,\u201d adding that the feature since has been enabled on every SEC social account where available.\n\nUnder Elon Musk\u2019s ownership, X has faced criticism over cybersecurity, including for removing SMS-based multifactor authentication for nonsubscribers in February. Still, cybersecurity experts have long warned that SMS-based multifactor authentication is weaker than other forms because it is vulnerable to SIM swapping and urged users to rely instead on authentication apps or physical security keys.\n\nThe SEC did not have any multifactor authentication enabled. The spokesperson said that the hacker reset the password once in control of the number, although did not specify the exact mechanics.\n\nThe spokesperson said the agency is coordinating with different law enforcement and federal oversight agencies, including the SEC\u2019s Office of Inspector General, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Justice.\n\nThe spokesperson said there\u2019s no evidence that the hacker gained access to SEC systems, data, devices, or other social platforms."

After that it will charge 0.21 per cent.\n\nBlackRock investors will pay 0.25 per cent for its product, although early investors can access it at 0.12 per cent for the first year until assets reach $5bn.\n\nThe US \u201cprice wars\u201d have settled at a level around 30 basis points, said HanETF chief executive Hector McNeil.\n\nBelow 30 bps, providers \u201ccan\u2019t make money\u201d unless they attract \u201cbillions\u201d of assets under management, McNeil said. He suspected \u201cmost\u201d would not and would therefore close in the \u201cmedium term\u201d.\n\nWisdomTree and Invesco have reacted by cutting fees by over 60 per cent on European-listed bitcoin exchange traded products.\n\nFees on the $325mn WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin ETP will fall from 0.95 per cent to 0.35 per cent, while fees on the $137mn Invesco Physical Bitcoin ETP will drop from 0.99 per cent to 0.39 per cent.\n\nBoth changes were announced within days of each other and will come into effect before the end of the month.\n\nInvesco\u2019s US product will waive its fees for six months or when it reaches $5bn, at which point it will charge 0.39 per cent \u2014 the same as the newly announced price on its European product.\n\nWisdomTree Europe head Alexis Marinof said the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs in the US had \u201ccaptured a lot of attention in Europe\u201d.\n\nMany investors \u201caren\u2019t aware\u201d that they have been able to access the same exposure through physically backed ETPs since 2019, Marinof said.\n\n\u201cThe launch of spot bitcoin ETFs in the US is helping the crypto market to evolve as the asset class continues to stake a claim for a place in client portfolios,\u201d he added.\n\nIn Europe virtually all digital assets exchange traded products are structured as exchange traded notes, rather than funds. Investors in ETNs own a debt security, while ETF shareholders owns a portion of a fund\u2019s underlying assets.\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit the ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools helping you to understand everything from performance to ESG ratings\n\nUS-based ETF specialist VanEck has said it plans to be \u201cmore aggressive\u201d in marketing its crypto products in Europe following the SEC decision.\n\nMartijn Rozemuller, chief executive of VanEck\u2019s European business, said that as well as boosting investor interest in cryptocurrency, the SEC\u2019s decision had \u201cprobably helped\u201d VanEck\u2019s brand in Europe due to the media coverage of its bitcoin ETF.\n\nUS-listed products may be more liquid and therefore attract European investors, said 7IM senior investment manager Peter Sleep. This is because it is a bigger market and is not spread across multiple exchanges like in Europe, he says.\n\nSpreads, tax and custody arrangements are also important considerations, said McNeil.\n\n*Ignites Europe is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

        "title": "Why Cathie Wood Believes Bitcoin's Upcoming \"Halving\" Will Redefine the Crypto Market in 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The upcoming halving of mining rewards in the Bitcoin (BTC -4.58%) network is not like the others. Ark Invest mastermind Cathie Wood found a game-changing quality in this fundamental update that sets it apart from the first three.\n\nWill this unique event make Bitcoin a better long-term storage system for wealth than investing in gold? Let's have a look.\n\nWhat Cathie Wood said\n\nIn a recent video interview with Yassine Elmandjra, Ark Invest's director of digital assets, Wood unveiled a rarely discussed detail of Bitcoin's next halving event that could change the game for the cryptocurrency market:\n\nThe rate of growth in supply is going to be cut in half to just under 1% per year. If you compare this to gold, the gold supply has increased on average roughly 1% per year. Bitcoin's supply growth is going to drop below that. (Lightly edited for readability)\n\nWhy is this insight so important?\n\nIt goes back to the famous notion of prices in a free market reflecting the balance between supply and demand. Gold is traditionally seen as a great value-storage tool due to its limited supply and fairly slow rate of new production. But now, for the first time, Bitcoin's supply side rate of growth will suddenly drop below the inflation pace of gold.\n\n\"The steady addition of a constant amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation,\" according to the Bitcoin whitepaper that defines how this cryptocurrency works. \"In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.\"\n\nSo the self-styled \"open-source peer-to-peer money,\" or digital gold, finally plays the part for which it was designed. That sure sounds like a game-changing event.\n\nBitcoin's gold-like stability\n\nBitcoin's limited supply is hardly a secret. In fact, its lifetime limit of 21 million digital coins is often held up as a reason to invest in this digital paragon of long-term stability.\n\n19.6 million of those tokens have already been mined, leaving less than 7% of the total supply for future mining efforts. With a halving of the mining rewards scheduled at roughly four-year intervals, the rate of Bitcoin growth will only slow down more in 2029, 2033, and beyond. The last Bitcoin should be mined somewhere around the year 2140. After that, mining rewards will consist of transaction fees alone.\n\nThis extremely long-term plan is hard-coded into Bitcoin's software. Changing these growth-limiting parameters would require an overwhelming agreement among the supply side stakeholders to sacrifice the fiscal stability of their own assets -- an improbable event, especially if Bitcoin actually evolves into a ubiquitous digital alternative to gold.\n\nThe impact of the next Bitcoin halving\n\nSo far, Bitcoin's halvings have always heralded a sharp increase in the cryptocurrency's price.\n\nFor instance, one Bitcoin was worth $12 on the first reward cut in 2012. One year later, the price peaked at $1,170 before backing down again. The 2016 halving sent Bitcoin prices from $640 to $19,650 in 17 months. The latest reduction in mining rewards took place in May 2020 at a price of $8,600. 18 months later, that price cycle topped out at $67,500.\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results, but Bitcoin breaks that rule of thumb in some ways.\n\nThe halvings are quite predictable. They will happen roughly every four years, radically changing the economics of Bitcoin mining each time.\n\nThe mining process serves a crucial purpose in the processing of Bitcoin transactions. Without it, the blockchain grinds to a halt. Therefore, the whole system makes sense only as long as miners receive enough rewards to run a successful business. And when the mining rewards are cut in half, a steady consumption of processing cycles and electric power will produce half as many Bitcoin tokens. Bitcoin miners would go out of business if prices don't rise over time.\n\nTherefore, halvings almost inevitably lead to higher Bitcoin prices. It's not the only factor in play when market makers determine Bitcoin's real-time price, but arguably the most important and predictable pattern-making tool on the encrypted table. The inevitability of this trend will only break if Bitcoin itself goes out of fashion and shuts down. So, the pattern of dramatic price increases in the months after each halving will continue as long as Bitcoin has a future.\n\nAnd the next halving may indeed be different, as the inflation rate below gold's annual production increase suggests a game-changing level of value-guarding stability.\n\nThe crypto market as a whole, and Bitcoin in particular, still faces numerous headwinds and challenges. The progress of digital currencies can stumble on legal and regulatory roadblocks, on slow uptake of crypto-based services in the consumer market, and on unexpected technology jumps, just to name a few potential game-breakers. But the steady rhythm of scheduled mining-reward halvings will continue regardless, resulting in rock-solid stability or the end of the Bitcoin world.\n\nBitcoin deserves a modest investment today\n\nI expect the Bitcoin community to address and overcome these inevitable challenges as they come along. The supply side looks solid, as long as the global market can generate a steady or rising amount of demand for this digital asset.\n\nIn the long run, I see tremendous value in the large-scale adoption of digital currencies and blockchain networks, and Bitcoin is the 800-pound gorilla to beat in this sector. So I suggest adding some Bitcoin exposure to your investment portfolio, but I'm not going all-in on cryptocurrency quite yet -- just in case the ambitious gold-replacement plan doesn't work out."

        "title": "Bitcoin has gone mainstream. For crypto, that's controversial. - Marketplace",
        "content": "It\u2019s been almost two weeks since several investment products tied to bitcoin started trading on old-school financial markets.\n\nThese exchange-traded funds have made it easier for everyday investors to place bets on the cryptocurrency market, like they would buy and sell stocks on Wall Street.\n\nIn the days since federal regulators finally gave the green light, investors have poured nearly $2 billion into the new bitcoin funds. But probably not the crypto purists, says Joel Khalili, who reports on the industry for Wired.\n\nMarketplace\u2019s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Khalili about crypto early adopters, who, he says, are quite happy to stay on the fringes of the financial system.\n\nThe following is an edited transcript of their conversation.\n\nJoel Khalili: It harkens back to the underlying ideology of bitcoin, that it would be a technology that underpinned a payment network whereby people would store their own wealth and transact directly with one another, essentially cutting these large Wall Street intermediaries out of the picture. And the reality is that the ETFs are just not that, they\u2019re kind of the opposite. They\u2019re a vehicle exclusively for financial speculation. They\u2019re managed by a host of kind of the \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d of Wall Street, these large financial institutions. Users don\u2019t hold the underlying bitcoin themselves, they\u2019re kind of investing in a representation. You can\u2019t use ETF shares as a means of peer-to-peer payment, that\u2019s for sure.\n\nMeghan McCarty Carino: So, investing in ETFs is not direct ownership of a cryptocurrency, but that kind of ownership is kind of a core principle for this group.\n\nKhalili: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s one of the reasons why crypto ideologues like the idea of bitcoin ETFs, partly because they see it as a kind of source of new legitimacy for bitcoin and they hope that it will legitimize the asset in the eyes of large, institutional investors. They also see it as something that will kind of unlock this pent-up demand for bitcoin among people who have typically been unwilling to deal with the hassles, the frictions, the perils of storing crypto themselves. So, on one hand, bitcoiners are excited about the arrival of bitcoin ETFs, but they won\u2019t touch them themselves, because as you say, what ETF investors aren\u2019t doing is buying bitcoin directly, they\u2019re buying a representation. There\u2019s a saying among bitcoiners: \u201cNot your keys, not your coins.\u201d And that means effectively that unless you keep bitcoin in a self-managed wallet, it\u2019s not really under your control. That is the case with the ETFs. A third-party custodian has control of the underlying bitcoin.\n\nMcCarty Carino: Can you explain some of the hassles and frictions of buying and storing bitcoin directly?\n\nKhalili: One issue is that some people have tended to prefer not to do business with crypto exchanges like Coinbase or Gemini or offshore exchanges like FTX, which is a name familiar to everyone that ended fairly poorly. So, purchasing crypto directly still involves transacting with a crypto exchange, where you take dollars and they will, in return, give you a cryptocurrency, and then you can choose if you\u2019d like to take the cryptocurrency off the exchange and keep them in a wallet of your own. But it\u2019s that piece where most of the friction lies. The reality with cryptocurrency is that there is no room for error. So, I can take the cryptocurrency and put it in my own wallet. But if I lose access to that wallet, if I forget my password, if I haven\u2019t correctly recorded what\u2019s known as a seed phrase, which is a 12-word sequence of words that will allow you to recover access to a wallet. If you forget any of those pieces and you lose access, then your crypto is gone. It\u2019s into the ether. It\u2019s unrecoverable. So, it\u2019s that piece, that\u2019s where the peril really lies in terms of people participating in what\u2019s known as self-custody. That\u2019s the term that bitcoiners would use.\n\nMcCarty Carino: So, who is excited about this?\n\nKhalili: It\u2019s a funny one. Bitcoiners believe that the greater awareness surrounding the asset among regular people can only be a good thing in the long term. One person put it to me, they think that it\u2019ll have a kind of mosquito bite effect. It\u2019s a bit of a crude turn of phrase, but effectively infecting people with bitcoin fever, right? So they\u2019re kind of excited about this prospect that bitcoin is going to be effectively passing into the hands of a much broader range of people, and a much broader range of investors are coming to the space, and potentially, a lot more cash in terms of dollar value will be entering the bitcoin system and potentially driving up the price. But then on the other hand, none of that means that they\u2019ll be buying ETFs themselves, for the kinds of reasons we\u2019ve discussed.\n\nMcCarty Carino: If we do see this kind of sustained flood of mainstream investment into crypto, could that sort of stabilize this ecosystem?\n\nKhalili: Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s one theory. I\u2019m not a market analyst, but the analysts that I spoke to generally do believe that the arrival of ETFs and the arrival of capital from these kind of large institutional investment houses into the asset class will kind of result in an upward trend in demand. Perhaps that will have a stabilizing effect. But on the other hand, something analysts predicted was that there was a lot of hype in the lead-up to ETF approval around what it might do to the bitcoin price. There were a lot of posts flying around on Twitter peppered with rocket ship emojis, and there were predictions that ETFs would suddenly drive bitcoin to new all-time highs. And the reality \u2013 and this is something that analysts had predicted \u2013 is that the preapproval hype kind of drove up the price, but then the approval itself led to a dip. People bought the rumor, so to speak, and then sold the news.\n\nMcCarty Carino: This moment comes after a tough couple years in crypto. Things seem to have been kind of on the upswing lately, but how would you define this moment in, in crypto after the last few years?\n\nKhalili: People within the industry have a sense of optimism in the wake of the trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX, which is the collapsed crypto exchange I referred to earlier. There is a sense that there\u2019s an opportunity for crypto to start fresh now. Whether that\u2019s borne out in reality is another question, but there\u2019s a sense of optimism and part of it is surrounding the approval of these ETFs. And I can\u2019t understate how much this was something that members of crypto circles latched on to as something to celebrate. It was the talk of the virtual town for months in the lead-up. So, you know, there is a sense of optimism in crypto circles that the industry can move on from the trauma that was caused by the collapse of FTX and the series of other companies that fell in, in around the same time frame in 2022.\n\nMore on this\n\nIn my conversation with Joel Khalili, we talked about some of the big philosophical tensions with crypto going mainstream, but there are also practical considerations.\n\nOne of the perceived benefits of bitcoin is real-time, around-the-clock availability. The blockchain stays online 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. But stock exchanges and investment firms are more of a 9-to-5 kind of crowd.\n\nSo, that first weekend after ETFs hit the scene, bitcoin\u2019s value fell more than $1,000 after markets closed. As The Wall Street Journal noted, \u201cthose who owned it directly or via a crypto broker were able to keep trading, as bitcoin runs 24/7. Those who held a bitcoin ETF could only watch and wait for Wall Street to open.\u201d"

        "title": "Time to Choose: Which Bitcoin ETFs Stand Out in the Early Going, and How Different Are the Winners? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "At long last, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved a handful of applications to launch exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reflecting the spot price of Bitcoin (BTC -4.85%) tokens. Investors now have access to 11 Bitcoin-based ETFs, allowing exposure to the largest cryptocurrency even in account types that don't offer crypto-trading. And there was much rejoicing.\n\nIt's still early, but the hopeful field of Bitcoin ETF options has already started separating the wheat from the chaff. Four of the 11 funds stand head and shoulders over the rest with far more trading action and larger Bitcoin portfolios under management one week later.\n\nEach fund offers a unique spin on the idea of Bitcoin-based ETFs. Some of the lagging options may offer interesting features, but their market footprint is too small for proper coverage under The Fool's disclosure policy and general publishing guidelines. Stocks and cryptocurrencies with market caps below $200 million are below the coverage threshold, and the same limit applies to the net asset value (NAV) of ETFs. Most of the new Bitcoin names sit far below that level.\n\nSo let's take a deeper look at the four early winners instead. I'm doing this for your benefit, dear reader, but also for my own. Regular readers might recall that I might switch my own Bitcoin-fund holdings currently parked in the just-converted Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC -5.76%), since that particular option comes with above-average annual fees. So what you're about to read will show you how and why I'd pick an alternative and make the jump -- or not, as the case may be.\n\nThe early winners, by the numbers\n\nETF Name and Ticker Net Asset Value (NAV) Average Daily Volume (number of shares) Annual Management Fees Grayscale Bitcoin Trust $25.2 billion 7.7 million 1.5% (No introductory fee waiver) iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT -5.82%) $698 million 22.4 million 0.25% (Introductory rate of 0.12% for the first year or first $5.0 billion assets under management (AUM)) Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust (BITB -5.80%) $355 million 3.1 million 0.2% (Introductory 0% rate for the first 6 months or first $1.0 billion AUM) Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB -5.69%) $279 million 3.4 million 0.21% (Introductory 0% rate for the first 6 months or first $1.0 billion AUM)\n\nWhat's wrong with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust?\n\nAs you can see, Grayscale's fund is far larger than the others. It's the only asset on this list that was converted from a mutual fund format instead of created from scratch last week. As such, it has built up a massive Bitcoin portfolio over the last 11 years.\n\nGrayscale has been fighting for the ETF classification for years, filing the first such application in October 2021. The old mutual fund format lacks the advanced price management features of a modern ETF, so Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust didn't always reflect the true value of its underlying cryptocurrency holdings.\n\nFor instance, the fund often traded at a generous premium to its Bitcoin value -- averaging 40% in the 6-year period between 2015 and 2020 -- before swinging to a deep discount in 2021. The fund's price dipped to an average 49% rebate from December 2022 to May 2023, as investors feared that the ETF conversion might never come:\n\nI built my Grayscale investment by buying in thirds on the outskirts of that ideal period, at discounts ranging from 25% to 40%. An important part of my investment thesis was that the full-fledged ETF would finally match the true market value of Grayscale's substantial Bitcoin holdings, and that's exactly what happened. Over the last 5 market days, the ETF has traded as a minimal discount of roughly 1%.\n\nSo far, so good. Now I'm effectively holding a Bitcoin investment in an account that doesn't offer any form of direct cryptocurrency trading. And there was much rejoicing.\n\nBut then it turns out that Grayscale's sector-leading ETF also comes with the highest management fees of any Bitcoin ETF. These annual expenses were reportedly a sticking point in negotiations for that precious SEC approval, and the firm agreed to lower its annual fee from 2% to 1.5% just two days before the final approval.\n\nMy first thought was to leave my Grayscale investment alone. A 1.5% fee may be high compared to the single-digit rates and even lower introductory fees seen in other Bitcoin ETFs, but it's small potatoes next to the potential gains of a long-term Bitcoin investment. Wouldn't trading fees and capital gains taxes undermine or even overwhelm the savings I'd see from moving to a cheaper option, anyway?\n\nAnd then it struck me. Like most modern brokerages, my trading platform doesn't charge any fees or commissions on ordinary trades in stocks or ETFs. Furthermore, that basket of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust shares is in a traditional IRA retirement account where taxes are levied on withdrawal and the trades along the way don't incur any additional tax charges.\n\nIn other words, I shouldn't let taxation issues limit my efforts to optimize that Bitcoin ETF position. So now I'm leaning toward making that move, squeezing the last drop of available returns from my IRA-based Bitcoin investment.\n\nGoodbye, Grayscale. What are my options?\n\nGrayscale's high management fees may be a mistake since the fund's net asset value has declined in the early going while lower-priced options posted substantial growth instead. Hence, it's time to eat Sir Robin's minstrels and look at the other three winners. Are there any game-changing differences between the iShares, Bitwise, and Ark Invest alternatives?\n\nThe iShares fund comes with a robust early uptake, building nearly a billion-dollar Bitcoin bucket in just a few days. That's hardly surprising, given the iShares series' solid reputation, competitive fees, and financial backing of its parent company, colossal investing services firm BlackRock BLK -2.08% )\n\nBitwise's fund offers the lowest fees once all the introductory rebate offers expire. Furthermore, this isn't a financial services firm dabbling in Bitcoin, but a cryptocurrency expert taking a swing at ETFs. I see that as an upside, but your mileage may vary. Bitwise also leans into its cryptocurrency focus by pledging to donate a portion of the ETF's profits to Bitcoin developers. Some critics see this as Bitwise attempting to gain some control over Bitcoin's future direction. I see a helpful effort to support the blockchain infrastructure behind the whole Bitcoin system, which should be a good thing. Finally, I kind of expected this firm to manage its own Bitcoin transactions and asset custody, as Fidelity does, but that's not the case. Bitwise leaves that duty to the Coinbase (COIN -7.17%) Custody service -- the same custodian used by every ETF in the table above. Still, low fees and deep cryptocurrency expertise make Bitwise a tempting option.\n\nThen there's the Ark 21Share fund, managed by Cathie Wood and her team of growth-stock experts. This ETF is barely large enough to merit coverage so far, offering a middle-of-the-road fee schedule and no eye-catching special features. Buying Ark's Bitcoin ETF is essentially a vote of confidence in Cathie Wood's team and its ability to effectively manage a plain-vanilla digital assets ETF in the long run.\n\nSo where will I go and what should I recommend for you, dear reader? I'm tempted to reinvest my Grayscale Bitcoin Trust holdings in the Bitwise fund, thanks to its low fees and commitment to supporting the Bitcoin development community. The Ark option was the runner-up for me, as the fund is nearly identical to the iShares alternative but with a lighter fee schedule. In another ETF race, the minimal fees of a Vanguard fund would always be a top choice but that firm sees no value in Bitcoin and won't launch an ETF in this sector anytime soon.\n\nThere you have it; I'll probably move my Grayscale investment over to the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF trust in a few days. The disclosure policy I mentioned earlier limits me from buying or selling any of these assets a few days before and after publishing articles about them, so I can't do anything today. You, on the other hand, are free to pick your favorite Bitcoin ETF and grab a few shares, as you might with any normal stock. Again, I'd recommend the Bitwise or Ark 21Share alternatives, depending on whether you crave Bitwise's developer support or not. Both Bitcoin ETFs offer rock-bottom annual fees.\n\nAnd there was much rejoicing."

        "content": "Bitcoin Drops Below $40,000 As Investors Cash Out of GBTC\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has continued its downward trajectory over the past week, dropping below the $40,000 mark for the first time in over two weeks. According to CoinMarketCap, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently trading at $39,847, having shed nearly 3.44% of its value in the past 24 hours, and 6.40% over last week.\n\nThe latest price dip comes just days after the much-anticipated approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. These investment vehicles, which allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly purchasing the cryptocurrency, were seen as a major milestone for the digital asset industry.\n\nHowever, instead of triggering a surge in demand, the launch of Bitcoin ETFs appears to have led to a sell-off. Analysts believe that investors are cashing out of ETFs, particularly Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust, which recently converted to a spot BTC ETF. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust previously traded like a closed-end investment vehicle, making it difficult for investors to redeem their shares. Following the conversion, investors have been quick to cash out, leading to a significant outflow of Bitcoin from the fund. This, in turn, has put downward pressure on the price of Bitcoin.\n\nThe broader cryptocurrency market is also feeling the heat, with altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) both experiencing notable declines. ETH is down more than 4.45% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $2,330, while SOL declined by 6.09% in a day, currently priced at $84.80.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "Can Bitcoin Reach $100,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "There's no doubt that the cryptocurrency asset class has been one of the best-performing in recent times. Just take a look at Bitcoin (BTC -4.79%), whose price has absolutely skyrocketed over the past decade.\n\nEven in 2023, the world's most valuable digital asset soared 154%, a gain that crushes the overall stock market. However, Bitcoin remains 38% off its all time high.\n\nThe bulls aren't deterred; they are encouraged by the momentum. They have their sights set on $100,000 per coin. Can Bitcoin rise 130% from today's levels to reach this major milestone?\n\nA favorable setup\n\nBitcoin has been in the news a lot lately. That's because the digital asset achieved something that has long been overdue. And this is the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nEarlier this month, the Securities and Exchange Commission finally allowed these financial products to come to market. And perhaps Bitcoin's gain in 2023 was due to the anticipation from the investment community about ETFs being approved. Many are considering this a monumental event in Bitcoin's history, finally making this a legitimate financial asset in the eyes of the government and Wall Street.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs now make it cheap and incredibly easy to gain exposure to Bitcoin's price movements. Investors don't have to open a separate brokerage account with a cryptocurrency exchange or worry about self-custody issues anymore. Bitcoin bulls are hoping that the ETFs will introduce a new wave of capital to the asset, which could drive up the price over time.\n\nBesides a regulatory stamp of approval, there's another event that should propel Bitcoin to a higher price. Set to happen this April, the blockchain network will undergo what's known as a halving. This is when the Bitcoin rewards that miners receive to approve transactions and secure the blockchain get cut in half. It happens roughly every four years, and it has historically created a bullish environment for Bitcoin.\n\nJust look at the last time this happened. In May 2020, Bitcoin had its last halving event. The cryptocurrency soared in the two months before. And in the 18 months following the halving. Bitcoin skyrocketed 661% to eventually reach its all-time high of nearly 69,000 in November 2021.\n\nShould something similar play out this time around, the digital asset could reach a new peak price 12 to 18 months following the upcoming halving. Maybe the $100,000 mark is the new achievement to be had.\n\nSolving a problem\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in Bitcoin's short-term price action, but investors should take the time to understand what makes this cryptocurrency really special.\n\nBitcoin supporters have incredibly strong views about this digital asset because of the problem that it solves. By being a decentralized and global peer-to-beer payments network that isn't controlled by any central authority, Bitcoin is basically trying to disrupt the Federal Reserve and current monetary system. Some people argue that central bankers have caused more harm than good by constantly manipulating interest rates to solve inflationary and economic issues that they seem to not have any grasp over.\n\nPlus, consider that the U.S. government currently has $34 trillion in debt, a figure that has surged over the past four decades. This doesn't even include underfunded liabilities like Social Security and Medicare. The thinking is that the government will have no choice but to continue printing money going forward, thus making the debt burden even more insurmountable.\n\nThis troubled monetary situation seems unsustainable. Bitcoin's properties, mainly the fact that it has a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, coupled with it not being controlled by anybody, makes it an attractive asset to own in one's portfolio.\n\nWhile near-term price movements are hard to predict, there is a chance that Bitcoin will reach $100,000 in a short period of time. However, investors should only buy this asset if they believe in its long-term potential, with the intention of holding it for the next decade. With that time horizon in mind, the price could eventually be much higher than $100,000."

While the SEC says multifactor authentication was previously enabled on the agency\u2019s X account, it was \u201cdisabled by X Support, at the staff\u2019s request, in July 2023 due to issues accessing the account.\u201d The SEC only reenabled MFA after it realized its account was compromised on January 9th, and says it has MFA active on all of its other social media accounts that have the option."

        "title": "Missed Out on Bitcoin Mining Stocks? 2 Crypto Stocks to Buy Right Now - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "One of the easiest investment plays of 2023 was buying Bitcoin (BTC -4.79%) mining stocks. All they seemed to do was go up, with popular mining stocks like Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA -7.46%), Riot Platforms (RIOT -6.82%), and CleanSpark (CLSK -7.42%) all up more than 400% by the end of 2023.\n\nBut it could be an entirely different story in 2024. Due to the upcoming Bitcoin halving, only a handful of Bitcoin mining companies are likely to be profitable for the year, and that could lead to a massive shakeout in the industry. So, with that in mind, here are two crypto stocks to buy instead.\n\nCoinbase Global\n\nFirst up is Coinbase Global (COIN -7.17%), which continues to be a favorite of crypto investors. Cathie Wood of Ark Invest was consistently bullish on Coinbase throughout 2023 -- and for good reason. Coinbase remains the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, with a business model that is easy to understand for investors.\n\nCoinbase also remains one of the best indirect ways to get exposure to Bitcoin. Among publicly traded companies, Coinbase is the sixth-largest holder of Bitcoin in the world, with 9,181 bitcoins worth nearly $400 million on its balance sheet. Moreover, Bitcoin accounts for approximately one-third of all trading on the Coinbase platform. Generally speaking, upward momentum for Bitcoin also results in higher trading volume for other cryptos as well, so Coinbase could get a nice overall boost if investors return to the crypto market in 2024.\n\nThe big question, of course, is what the new spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) mean for the future of Coinbase. At year end, Ark Invest was selling off Coinbase stock, and some took that as a signal that it was time to get out of Coinbase. After all, if people were going to be buying Bitcoin indirectly via ETFs instead of directly via a crypto exchange, that would likely mean a direct hit to Coinbase's bottom line.\n\nBut if you take a closer look at the structure of the Bitcoin ETFs, Coinbase is designated as a custodian for 8 out of 11 of them. In other words, Coinbase is going to be holding onto a lot of Wall Street's Bitcoin in its digital vaults. In a best-case scenario, new custodial and service fees will help to patch over any loss in Bitcoin trading volume on its platform.\n\nMicroStrategy\n\nNext up is MicroStrategy (MSTR -5.06%), which continues to be the single-best Bitcoin proxy stock. If you take a quick look at how much Bitcoin that MicroStrategy is holding on its balance sheet, it's easy to see why. MicroStrategy now holds 189,150 Bitcoins worth nearly $8 billion at today's prices. For those of you keeping score at home, that's approximately 1% of the world's total Bitcoin supply.\n\nAs in the case of Coinbase, there's some debate about what the new Bitcoin ETFs will mean for MicroStrategy. Presumably, the company will lose some of its allure as a Bitcoin proxy stock. In just the first 48 hours after the new Bitcoin ETFs went live, the stock lost 20% of its value.\n\nHowever, some of that appears to be an overreaction by the market. Investment giant Vanguard Group, for example, has said that it won't be making the new Bitcoin ETFs available for its client base. Instead, it will be investing heavily in MicroStrategy as a more efficient way to gain exposure to Bitcoin. That might sound counterintuitive at first until you consider that MicroStrategy's vast Bitcoin holdings are worth more than the company itself!\n\nWhat is the best way to get exposure to Bitcoin?\n\nNow is the time to get your Bitcoin exposure right, especially with the narrative around Bitcoin shifting. With that in mind, there are a variety of different ways to get access to Bitcoin. You can buy Bitcoin mining stocks. You can buy Bitcoin proxy stocks such as MicroStrategy. You can buy the new Bitcoin ETFs. Or you can buy Bitcoin directly via Coinbase.\n\nLooking ahead, the next big catalyst to keep an eye on will be the Bitcoin halving, scheduled for April. Between now and then could be a fantastic opportunity to find crypto stocks such as Coinbase and MicroStrategy that are most likely to benefit from any long-term appreciation in the price of Bitcoin."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price has struggled since spot ETFs launched in the US earlier this month, having now given up practically all price gains made since the start of December.\n\nBitcoin was on its way to retesting $40,000 early Monday morning after sinking almost 5% over the past five days.\n\nBTC almost hit $49,000 as ETFs backed by the cryptocurrency opened trade on Jan. 11 \u2014 which converts to a near-20% retracement since that point. BTC is still up 80% over the past year.\n\nBlackRock, Fidelity and Bitwise and six other issuers have been accumulating bitcoin on behalf of ETF shareholders over that time, with the former first to reach $1 billion in assets under management last week. Fidelity\u2019s fund quickly followed.\n\nGrayscale meanwhile has seen $2.8 billion in bitcoin flow out from its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), with its comparatively high fees believed to blame.\n\nPreviously, GBTC was a closed-ended fund through which shares could not be redeemed for bitcoin. The firm won a key SEC court battle late last year, setting GBTC to be converted into an open-ended spot ETF along with all the others.\n\nThat meant capital potentially locked up for years could finally be pulled and reallocated without selling GBTC shares (while its NAV discount has now all but dried up). Bitcoin\u2019s sagging price could be related to GBTC outflows and subsequent sales, although the exact impact is difficult to know for certain.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin at $31K as court formalizes Grayscale win over SEC\n\nGBTC first launched in 2015 and its head start means GBTC is by far the biggest ETF by assets under management, even after the billions in outflows, with $23.55 billion in the fund as of Friday\u2019s close.\n\nOverall, spot bitcoin ETFs in the US have seen about $1.15 billion in net flows over their six trading sessions.\n\nThe latest figures shared by Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas show that spot ETFs without counting GBTC hold 95,300 BTC ($3.87 billion) \u2014 less than half a percent of the circulating supply.\n\nGBTC meanwhile holds almost seven times that amount. Altogether, US spot ETFs account for 3.3% of the supply, about one third of the bitcoin sitting with crypto exchange hot wallets, per CryptoQuant data.\n\nWhile bitcoin has floundered over the past few weeks, markets appear to have gravitated towards ether (ETH) in anticipation over its own suite of spot ETF applications.\n\nRead more: After spot bitcoin ETF approval, eyes shift to ether fund decision\n\nETH is up nearly 1.5% over the year to date, after gaining as much as 11%. Other major cryptocurrencies including solana (SOL) and XRP have meanwhile dropped 20% and 16% while BNB is about flat.\n\nThe sudden attention paid to ether even knocked its 20-day correlation with bitcoin into rare negative territory for the first time in almost three years.\n\nStill, practically the entire crypto market is in the red today and looks primed for consolidation, especially considering the health of the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq so far this year.\n\nThe bitcoin halving sometime in April is the next anticipated potential catalyst for crypto volatility.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "JPMorgan, Jane Street and other authorised participants may be using Bitcoin futures ETFs to hedge their spot ETF activities.\n\nDespite JPMorgan\u2019s CEO railing against crypto last week, his firm is a key player in the new spot Bitcoin ETF market.\n\nSpot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds continued to smash expectations last week, and some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest names are playing a crucial role despite bosses like JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon continuing to criticise Bitcoin.\n\nSo-called authorised participants include JPMorgan and speed-trading giants Jane Street and Virtu Financial. All of three of these firms are included as APs for BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETFs, according to SEC filings.\n\nAPs ensure spot Bitcoin ETFs launched by the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity trade as close as possible to the underlying value of the Bitcoin they hold, helping investors get the best deal possible.\n\nDespite JPMorgan\u2019s role in the Bitcoin ETF ecosystem, Dimon called Bitcoin a \u201cPet Rock\u201d at the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual meeting in Davos \u2014 his latest in a long line of crypto-critical comments.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nEven as Dimon stayed true to his Bitcoin-bashing form, however, traditional financial firms are playing a crucial role with the new ETFs \u2014 and they\u2019re doing a good job.\n\n\u2018Crushed it\u2019\n\nThe Wall Street bigwigs \u201ccrushed it\u201d on the first day of trading, Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said.\n\nThere had been worries that the ETFs shares might trade at a higher price than the Bitcoin they represent, Balchunas said, but authorised participants ensured that risk was mitigated.\n\nBased on whether the ETF is trading above or below its net asset value \u2014 the cost of the underlying Bitcoin it holds \u2014 these firms will create or redeem shares.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nIf it trades higher, they\u2019ll need to create more shares, adding supply to the market and lowering the price. If it trades lower, then managers will redeem shares for cash, reducing supply.\n\nAuthorised participants don\u2019t handle Bitcoin directly, as creations and redemptions are done with cash rather than so-called \u201cin-kind\u201d redemptions issuers had fought for.\n\nA week on from launch, these newborn ETFs continue to trade in a tight range to their net asset value.\n\nWhy does this matter? Tighter spreads mean better deals for investors, and a better chance at increasing flows into the ETFs, Balchunas said on Wednesday.\n\nSophisticated strategies\n\nThe use of cash creations and redemptions, instead of in-kind creations, means there\u2019s a \u201csettlement period gap,\u201d Coinbase\u2019s head of institutional research, David Duong, told DL News via email.\n\nThis gap is the time between authorised participants receiving buy orders and when new shares are created. As a result, authorised participants will need to protect themselves from price movements during these periods, likely using pre-existing regulated products.\n\nBitcoin futures ETFs experienced a brief renaissance following the launch of spot funds. ProShares\u2019 Bitcoin futures ETF, BITO, processed $2 billion in trading volume on the day the spot ETFs launched \u2014 beating its previous record by more than 50%, according to Coinbase.\n\nVolumes dropped about 75% a week later, trading $503 million in volume on January 18.\n\nInstitutional investors might be using these types of funds to protect themselves during the settlement period gap.\n\nLiquid pre-existing products such as Bitcoin futures ETFs act as a \u201cparking spot,\u201d of sorts, Balchunas said in December. Since BITO is highly liquid \u2014 meaning holders can sell shares into cash with ease \u2014 firms managing the spot Bitcoin ETFs can hold it as a sort of transition tool to reduce volatility risks as they create and redeem shares in the newly launched spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\u201cDespite this drop, we view BITO as a continued integral part of the Bitcoin ETF space,\u201d Coinbase\u2019s report said, referring to the 75% plunge in trading this week.\n\nAuthorised participants \u201cwill continue to rely on regulated means of hedging themselves, such as long CME futures or long BITO when creating shares,\u201d Coinbase said.\n\nThese products give the firms protection against movements in Bitcoin\u2019s price as they arbitrage the shares back in line with the net asset value.\n\nSome of these firms may have gone a step further in their hedging strategies, according to Coinbase.\n\nBuying early\n\nCoinbase analysts, led by Duong, suspect some of these authorised participants bought Bitcoin ahead of the launch.\n\nThe crypto exchange\u2019s report said some authorised participants \u201cpotentially bought Bitcoin in anticipation of the ETF launch,\u201d while at the same time selling Bitcoin futures ETFs \u201cto hedge potential client buys and sells intraday.\u201d\n\nCoinbase\u2019s theory is \u201cconsistent with evidence in the report,\u201d Duong said, namely the compressing basis between CME Bitcoin futures and spot. Basis refers to the difference between the cash price of Bitcoin versus its futures price on the CME.\n\n\u201cFollowing the launch of the spot ETF, the basis between CME futures and spot has compressed to less than 0.5%, dropping its premium tenfold from its recent peak at the start of 2024. That may explain some of the activity described above,\u201d Coinbase\u2019s report said.\n\nAdam Morgan is a markets correspondent at DL News. Reach him at adam@dlnews.com.

        "title": "Is Coinbase in the Crosshairs? The Multimillion-Dollar Dilemma It Faces as Bitcoin ETFs Surge in Popularity. - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Before Jan. 10, the only means of gaining true Bitcoin (BTC -4.85%) exposure was by directly purchasing the cryptocurrency off of an exchange, such as Coinbase Global (COIN -7.17%). But now investors can buy shares of one of 11 newly approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) through conventional brokerages.\n\nThis has created some concern that the ETFs could jeopardize one of Coinbase's main uses and source of income. However, this assumption fails to paint the full picture. Here's why the ETFs will likely be a net gain for Coinbase over the long term.\n\nThe new ETF landscape\n\nWith a crowded field of choices, investors have several options for picking which new Bitcoin ETF they want to buy. Recognizing this, providers are in the midst of a fee war in an attempt to remain competitive and attract buyers.\n\nThe majority of the ETFs have an expense ratio of 0% and offer fees lower than 0.4%, and some are waiving fees for a period of time. Compared to Coinbase, which charges anywhere from 1.5% to nearly 4% depending on the method of payment, cost-oriented investors would clearly opt for Bitcoin exposure via an ETF.\n\nHere lies the potential problem concerned investors are pointing out. Based on the most recent earnings statement, Bitcoin transaction fees made up around 17% of Coinbase's total revenue. Historically, this number has tended to hover around 18% to 20%.\n\nWhile Coinbase offers investors the ability to store purchased Bitcoins on a digital wallet, rather than merely owning shares of an ETF, this isn't a priority for everybody. For many investors, simply having exposure to the cryptocurrency in the form of an ETF is enough and the low fees make them an even better option. As these new ETFs become more popular among institutional and retail investors, Coinbase faces the likely reality that revenue from Bitcoin transactions will decline. But not all hope should be lost.\n\nHow Coinbase benefits from the ETFs\n\nOne of the more overlooked aspects of the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs is the role that Coinbase plays. While media attention focused on the big names sponsoring the new funds -- like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco -- a detail was glossed over.\n\nOut of the 11 Bitcoin ETFs now trading on the stock market, Coinbase serves as the custodian for eight of them. This means that Coinbase will benefit from two fees it charges. As the ETF providers buy and sell Bitcoins, Coinbase will receive a 0.2% fee. In addition, it also charges a fee to store those Bitcoins, with a varying cost structure depending on the total value in custody, ranging from 0.1% 0.2 %.\n\nThese might sound like minuscule numbers, but when considering just how much interest these ETFs have garnered in a short amount of time, those small percentages could begin to add up. Admittedly, we are still in the early days of Bitcoin's arrival on Wall Street, but it remains hard to dismiss just how much activity they are generating. Over the first three days of trading, the ETFs registered over $10 billion in volume. Furthermore, two of them -- BlackRock's and Fidelity's -- at the time of this writing ranked in the top five of total inflow among all ETFs during the past week.\n\nPopularity of the ETFs trickled to Coinbase's platform as well. On the day the ETFs were approved, it registered more than $7.5 billion in Bitcoin transactions as investor interest skyrocketed. It was the second-largest single day of trading in the company's history.\n\nQuantifying the impact\n\nIt's difficult to get hard numbers given the newness of the ETFs, but extrapolation of known fees and projected activity can shed some light on just how much money Coinbase could generate from its integral role.\n\nOne analyst firm estimates up to $30 million in custody fees annually for Coinbase. That isn't very much, considering that during the first three quarters of 2023 it generated over $2 billion in revenue. Yet this assessment overlooks one crucial aspect.\n\nCoinbase charges custodial fees based on the total dollar value held in each account. Not the total number of Bitcoins. This holds significant implications over the long term. Should Bitcoin continue its journey of price appreciation -- a reasonable assumption due to its scarcity and current trajectory -- the underlying value of the funds held in custody will appreciate. Should Bitcoin double in price, Coinbase will see those fees double as well. If there is anything Bitcoin's short 15-year history has proved, it's that increases of this size can be a piece of cake.\n\nThe other aspect that remains even more difficult to quantify, but holds greater implications, is the ripple effect that will occur in the wake of the approval of these ETFs. There is truly no way to estimate how significant of an impact they will have, but one fact remains certain: The approval stands as a momentous accomplishment in Bitcoin's evolution and holds the potential to accelerate market adoption among institutions and eventually trickle down to retail investors. As we saw with the trading surge on its platform in the days after the ETFs got the green light, the legitimization of Bitcoin and crypto in general will inevitably attract more activity and cushion Coinbase's bottom line.\n\nConsidering the long term\n\nWhile the threat of ETFs stealing Bitcoin transaction revenue warrants concern, the reality is that Coinbase's role as a custodian and position as an industry leader should prove capable of offsetting any declines. But of most importance is the landmark that the ETF approval is.\n\nNow the world's most valuable cryptocurrency has a home on Wall Street, and some of the biggest names in the financial industry want a piece of it. As interest in other cryptocurrencies grows and development of new use cases progresses, Coinbase remains one of the key beneficiaries of crypto's evolution."

        "content": "Bitcoin Spot ETFs Nearing $4B in AUM After 6 Days Since Launching\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs have collectively acquired 95,000 BTC in just six trading days, surpassing outflows from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). According to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, Fidelity's (FBTC) and BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) lead inflows, with over $1.2 billion each. IBIT has a slight edge in assets under management, with $1.4 billion compared to FBTC's $1.3 billion.\n\nInvesco's ETF had its best day for inflows on Friday, January 19, attracting over $63 million. VanEck's ETF also had a strong Friday, pushing its total assets under management beyond $100 million. Meanwhile, Grayscale\u2019s GBTC saw $590 million in outflows on Friday, putting the total outflows from GBTC to be $2.8 billion since it was converted to a spot Bitcoin ETF. However, total net flows is a positive $1.2 billion, as other spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $4 billion in funds, likely due to the lower fees compared to GBTC.\n\nOn their fifth trading day last Thursday, Bitcoin ETFs netted a combined $440 million in Bitcoin from investors. BlackRock's IBIT led with 8,700 BTC, valued at nearly $358 million. Nine ETFs, excluding Grayscale, have acquired almost 68,500 BTC, valued at around $2.8 billion, since their inception. Meanwhile, the rest of the spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a 34% increase in daily trading volume by the fifth day of trading.\n\nThe successful approval and launch of the spot Bitcoin ETFs was a highly anticipated milestone, showing growing institutional interest and demand for regulated Bitcoin investment products. Bitcoin (BTC) is down 2.53% over the past week and is currently trading at $41,250.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a surprising move, Grayscale Investments, the company behind the renowned Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), has reportedly sold off a substantial amount of Bitcoin (BTC), totaling $2.14 billion. This massive divestment comes in the aftermath of the recent approval granted by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, a prominent cryptocurrency analytics platform, Grayscale's Bitcoin holdings have diminished by approximately 52,227 BTC, equivalent to $2.14 billion, since the SEC greenlit spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this month. Grayscale currently holds 566,973 BTC, valued at $23.21 billion. In comparison, iShares (BlackRock) boasts 33,431 BTC ($1.37 billion), Fidelity holds 24,857 BTC ($1.02 billion) and Bitwise holds 10,152 BTC ($415.6 million).\n\nStrategic move?\n\nThis strategic move by Grayscale is noteworthy, given the recent wave of approvals granted by the SEC for various spot Bitcoin ETFs. Notable financial players securing approval include ARK Invest, BlackRock , VanEck, WisdomTree, Fidelity, Invesco, Franklin Templeton, Bitwise and Valkyrie. Additionally, Grayscale Investments received the green light to convert its $28 billion Bitcoin trust into the GBTC spot ETF, signifying a significant shift in the investment landscape.\n\nThe cryptocurrency community is abuzz with speculation regarding Grayscale's decision to offload a substantial portion of its Bitcoin holdings. Analysts suggest that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs may have prompted Grayscale to relocate its assets strategically, capitalizing on the increased institutional interest in the cryptocurrency market."

        "content": "Bitcoin has plunged below the critical threshold of $40,000, marking a significant downturn in the cryptocurrency\u2019s value.\n\nBitcoin was trading at $39,640 as of press time, down 18% from its peak of $49,000 earlier in January.\n\nThe decline to around $40,000, Bitcoin\u2019s lowest level since mid-December of the previous year, has been driven by a sustained sell-off amid a series of macroeconomic and market-specific factors.\n\nDollar headwinds\n\nA key contributor to Bitcoin\u2019s recent woes is the unexpectedly robust U.S. economic data, which has led to a tempered outlook for rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThis situation has bolstered the U.S. bond yields and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), creating substantial headwinds for cryptocurrencies at large.\n\nThe U.S. interest rate futures market is still pricing in a near 50% chance of a 25-basis point rate cut in March, despite recent data and Federal Reserve policymakers suggesting otherwise. This dynamic poses potential macroeconomic challenges for Bitcoin.\n\nThe approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has also played a key role in the volatility. While these ETFs initially drew significant capital inflows, they also triggered a \u201csell-the-news\u201d reaction, contributing to the bearish momentum.\n\nGBTC outflows\n\nNotably, Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) experienced substantial outflows, with 52,800 BTC sold since its conversion to a spot ETF, reflecting both a shift towards new investment products and profit-taking activities.\n\nAccording to recent reports, FTX has sold $1 billion worth of GBTC shares since it was converted to an ETF, making up a significant portion of the total outflows. The defunct exchange has sold-off almost the entirety of its holdings as of Jan. 22, which could lead to a reduction in the recent recent sell pressure.\n\nDespite the heavy sell-off, the nine newly launched ETFs have accumulated more Bitcoin than Grayscale has sold over the same period, as their assets under management hit $4.1 billion within six days of trading.\n\nThe \u201cNewborn Nine\u201d had purchased 95,000 BTC as of Jan. 20, led by BlackRock and Fidelity\u2019s ETFs \u2014 the two make up over 50% of the collective $4.1 billion in assets under management.\n\nCryptoSlate research revealed that the selling pressure was further compounded by short-term holders and traders selling their positions after the ETFs were approved \u2014 confirming a \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d event. Additionally, whales have been securing profits on their holdings after 12 months of gains."

        "content": "Australia\u2019s corporate regulator will examine details of the collapsed bitcoin company Blockchain Global after a Guardian Australia investigation revealed links between two of its directors and a series of failed crypto investment schemes.\n\nBlockchain Global collapsed in 2021 owing creditors $58m, with the liquidator referring its directors \u2013 Allan Guo, Sam Lee and Ryan Xu \u2013 to the Australian Securities and Investment Commission for potential breaches of the Corporations Act. This included possible breaches of director\u2019s duties, breaches of trust and unreasonable director-related transactions.\n\nAsic initially advised liquidators Pitcher Partners that it did not intend to take action after it received the first report on the company\u2019s activities in March 2022.\n\nBut after a Guardian Australia investigation into the HyperVerse crypto investment scheme, which has links to Lee and Xu, Asic has begun an examination of the liquidator\u2019s report. A final version was filed to Asic in October.\n\nAn Asic spokesperson told Guardian Australia: \u201cAsic confirms that it is assessing reports from the liquidator in relation to BGL.\u201d\n\nGuardian Australia has revealed widespread losses to the HyperVerse investment scheme, which escaped regulator attention in Australia despite being flagged by authorities overseas \u2013 by one as a possible \u201cscam\u201d and another as a \u201csuspected pyramid scheme\u201d.\n\nCourt documents filed in January in the US against Bitcoin Rodney, a senior US promoter of HyperFund and HyperVerse, allege the scheme operated with a network or promoters making \u201cfraudulent promotional presentations\u201d to investors and potential investors. He has been charged with operating and conspiring to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business.\n\nAn affidavit filed by the US internal revenue service alleges that early investors were \u201cpaid with funds collected from more recent investors\u201d, and the company\u2019s claimed revenue-generating bitcoin mining operations did not exist. There is no mention of Xu or Lee in the court documents filed by authorities in that case.\n\nLee has denied being behind HyperVerse, saying his involvement was limited to technology provision and the funds management side of the organisation. Both Lee and Xu appeared in the HyperVerse global launch event in 2021, alongside a fake chief executive officer called Stephen Reece Lewis. Xu and Lee also both featured prominently in promotional material for the schemes that preceded HyperVerse, known as HyperFund and HyperCapital.\n\nReece Lewis has since been revealed by the Guardian to be the British man Stephen Harrison, who said he was hired for a short period via a talent agent to play a \u201ccorporate presenter\u201d and that he had no role in the actual business.\n\nLee relocated to Dubai in 2021, while the whereabouts of Xu is unknown. Guo is not involved in the Hyper group schemes.\n\nThe US-based crypto analysis firm Chainalysis estimates losses to HyperVerse in 2022 amounted to US$1.3bn (A$1.97bn).\n\nThe move by Asic to examine the Blockchain Global collapse comes as the liquidator also reveals a possible link in the company\u2019s records to the operation of HCash, which was a cryptocurrency linked to the Hyper investment schemes.\n\n\u201cThe liquidators have identified two debt transactions totalling $500,000 in Blockchain Global\u2019s main bank account [linked to HCash]. These transactions both occur on 5 August 2019,\u201d Pitcher Partner\u2019s liquidator Andrew Yeo told Guardian Australia.\n\n\u201cIt is not clear whether the funds were used for this intended purpose.\u201d\n\nRewards that were accumulated through the earlier Hyper schemes were converted to HCash before they could be converted to other cryptocurrencies.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Afternoon Update Free daily newsletter Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "content": "Bitcoin and ether extended losses Monday while stocks traded sideways ahead of next week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting.\n\nBitcoin slipped below $40,000 for the first time in a month, putting the cryptocurrency around 7% lower in the past week. Ether (ETH) similarly faltered, trading around 6% lower over 24 hours on Monday to around $2,330.\n\nWhile the launch of bitcoin ETFs coinciding with a decline in bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price may be perplexing to traders, some analysts attribute some of the decline to outflows from Grayscale\u2019s product, which means the trust is holding less bitcoin.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin slips to nearly retest $40K even as tech stocks roar\n\nAs of Friday, Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust, which converted into an ETF earlier this month, held just under 567,000 bitcoin, according to disclosures. At the end of December 2023, the trust held around 619,000 BTC.\n\nOthers say cryptocurrency\u2019s general price decline is indicative of a broader risk-off trend as we head into the first Federal Open Markets Committee meeting of the year later this month. The Fed has already signaled that rate cuts may not come as swiftly or aggressively as markets had hoped.\n\n\u201cThis feels like a broad market reset as traders move to de-risk,\u201d Noelle Acheson, author of the \u201cCrypto is Macro Now\u201d newsletter, said. \u201cMore volatile assets are being hit even harder, as shown by the climb in bitcoin\u2019s market dominance \u2014 when BTC.D heads up as prices head down, we\u2019re seeing a rotation into the relative \u2018safety\u2019 of the market\u2019s largest and most liquid asset.\u201d\n\nRead more: GBTC\u2019s asset bleeding to blame for week of flat crypto product flows\n\nStocks also struggled to break out Monday, although the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes did manage to close the trading session in the green. Analysts say there is reason to believe the early rally we have seen so far this year \u2014 the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are up 2.3% and 4% year-to-date, respectively \u2014 could continue.\n\n\u201c[Last week], the actual news was more bad than good, yet stocks rallied and that tells us that momentum is still on the bull\u2019s side, technicals are positive and the path of least resistance is higher,\u201d Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, said.\n\nEssaye cautioned, however, that there isn\u2019t a lot of support right now for equities, and a substantial correction is only one hawkish-Fed comment away.\n\n\u201cAs far as chasing the market at these levels, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best time to do so based on the fact that I can\u2019t point to much that will push stocks higher in the medium term other than momentum,\u201d he said. \u201cI can point to numerous events that could cause a 5%-ish correction, quickly.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "For a crypto advocate, New Year\u2019s Eve is not only the celebration of the start of a new year \u2014 just a couple of days later, on Jan. 3, a significant anniversary occurs. On Jan. 3, 2009, pseudonymous Bitcoin (BTC) creator Satoshi Nakamoto mined the genesis block \u2014 the Bitcoin network\u2019s first-ever block.\n\nThe genesis block contained 50 BTC, the block reward at the time.\n\nThe wallet would remain untouched until a trend emerged within the crypto community where crypto advocates would transfer BTC to the wallet as a tribute to Nakamoto.\n\nBitcoin transfer a complete mystery\n\nAs the donations mounted over the years, the total balance of the genesis wallet climbed to 68.56 BTC by Jan. 3, 2023, worth almost $1.1 million at the time.\n\nTwo days later, the crypto community was shocked when someone transferred 26.9 BTC to the wallet, worth $1.17 million at the time,\n\nThe funds initially involved a transfer from three wallets to 12 others, with the majority of funds coming from a wallet associated with the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. Little more is known.\n\nNo one has claimed the mysterious BTC transfer, which is immutable \u2014 meaning it cannot be reversed \u2014 piquing the curiosity of the crypto community.\n\nEither Satoshi woke up, bought 27 bitcoin from Binance, and deposited into their wallet, or someone just burned a million dollars pic.twitter.com/w34kjnAHPJ \u2014 Conor (@jconorgrogan) January 6, 2024\n\nWas Nakamoto sending a message? Many theories emerged to explain the transfer.\n\nFat finger mistake\n\nAt first, a mistaken transfer was one of the most believable explanations for the mysterious Bitcoin transfer.\n\nFat fingering is a common occurrence in the cryptocurrency space. This term implies that users send cryptocurrencies to the wrong address due to mistakes while entering the recipient\u2019s address.\n\nThe genesis wallet address could also have been saved in the whitelist wallet address book on Binance, as random users send BTC to the genesis wallet each year as a tribute.\n\nRecent: 100 days out: What the Bitcoin halving means after BTC ETF approvals\n\nIf it were a manual mistake, the sender would have had to copy and paste the incorrect address into Binance and confirm the details at least twice before sending the funds.\n\nCrypto observers have widely disregarded the fat finger hypothesis for the mysterious BTC transfer.\n\nCalculated allocation as a tribute to Nakamoto\n\nRodolfo Andragnes, founder of ONG Bitcoin Argentina \u2014 a nongovernmental organization promoting decentralized tech \u2014 believes that the transfer was a calculated donation from a crypto whale as a tribute to Nakamoto\u2019s creation. But why 26.9 BTC? Andragnes told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cSomeone decided to send 0.1% of their holdings as a way of thanking Satoshi and Bitcoin for existing.\u201d\n\nThis would mean that the owner of the Bitcoin had at least 26,917 BTC in their possession.\n\nThe total BTC donated was well over $1 million, but in Andragnes\u2019 opinion, a donation of 0.1% is a psychological number for a crypto whale that wouldn\u2019t make a dent in their crypto holdings.\n\nThe crypto whale wouldn\u2019t feel \u201ceither richer or poorer\u201d after that transfer, Adragnes added.\n\nTwisted debt settlement owed to Craig Wright\n\nThe crypto community on X (formerly Twitter) has never lacked imagination. For Bitcoin enthusiast Pledditor, the transfer could have been simply a twisted debt settlement.\n\nMy theory for why 26.9 #BTC was sent to Satoshi:\n\n\n\nI think someone (probably nChain) who doesn't like Craig Wright, owes him money, but instead of wiring him a check, just sent it to the bitcoin address he \"claims\" to control to troll him https://t.co/7QrsrFzkY5 \u2014 Pledditor (@Pledditor) January 8, 2024\n\nCraig Wright has been claiming he is the creator of Bitcoin since 2016, and Nakamoto is the only person with private keys to the genesis wallet.\n\nTherefore, if Wright\u2019s claims are valid, he could access the wallet. Any payment wired to the genesis wallet would be like paying him directly.\n\nThe general consensus of the crypto community about Wright\u2019s claims is that they are false. Therefore, if the sender were in debt to Wright, the BTC transfer was one of the most expensive trolls ever.\n\nEncrypted message of a future Bitcoin prediction\n\nWhat if the transfer conveys a prediction about the future of Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin mining expert Alejandro de la Torre told Cointelegraph, \u201dMaybe someone or some people are hinting as to what the next bear market floor will be.\u201d\n\nHe believes that $26,900 may be the next Bitcoin bear market floor.\n\nLike hash predictions, the transfer could be a new way of encrypting a message. Afterward, the owner of the sent BTC could use the blockchain to prove it made the prediction years before.\n\nExpensive spot Bitcoin ETF marketing scheme\n\nOne of the first to detect the Bitcoin transfer was Coinbase director Conor Grogan, who guessed that the transfer could be some weird marketing scheme for the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which were awaiting approval in the United States at the time.\n\nhttps://t.co/1in4TEwh66\n\n\n\nMaybe some sort of weird ETF marketing scheme? \u200d\u2642\ufe0f \u2014 Conor (@jconorgrogan) January 6, 2024\n\nIt would have been an expensive marketing ploy if this was the case. As some X users remarked, it wouldn\u2019t be very effective, as the target audience of the spot Bitcoin ETFs is unlikely to care about activity in the genesis wallet.\n\nDonation for everyone\n\nMany users were infuriated that someone would send such a significant amount of money to the genesis wallet instead of a charitable cause.\n\nWhy the fuck don't these people that think they must burn their corn not donate it to one or more of the many @geyserfund projects or to @OpenSats\n\n\n\nI don't get it... \u2014 SF - Le Pleb Royale, with cheese | artdesignbySF (@LePlebRoyale) January 6, 2024\n\nIt\u2019s believed that Nakamoto has no access to the genesis wallet, so sending BTC to this address is like burning coins or losing a seed phrase.\n\nRecent: Impact of Bitcoin ETFs: \u2018Revolutionary change\u2019 or colossal \u2018dud\u2019?\n\nNonetheless, if the person behind the transfer supported Nakamoto\u2019s beliefs, they could have viewed the transfer as a donation to the whole Bitcoin community. As Nakamoto once said:\n\n\u201cLost coins only make everyone else\u2019s coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone.\u201d\n\nThe 26.9 BTC has only increased Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity, adding to the roughly 29% of total Bitcoin considered \u201clost.\u201d\n\nThe crypto community may never know the purpose of the mysterious million-dollar Bitcoin transfer to the genesis wallet, but at least it has fueled some speculation and debate in the crypto community."

        "content": "The \u201cNewborn Nine\u201d Bitcoin ETFs have collectively amassed 95,000 BTC, with collective assets under management (AUM) nearing $4 billion, according to available data.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, this remarkable inflow of capital highlights the growing investor appetite for digital assets and the increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in mainstream finance.\n\nBalchunas pointed out that most ETFs typically experience a drop in trading volume each day after launch. However, the Newborn Nine have continued to post record volume, with the fifth day of trading seeing a 34% increase in volume.\n\n$1B club\n\nBlackRock\u2019s IBIT and Fidelity\u2019s FBTC have led the pack in growth. Both funds have seen substantial inflows of over $1.2 billion each within this short period and each of them holds a little over 30,000 Bitcoin.\n\nWhile Fidelity\u2019s FBTC has slightly higher inflows, BlackRock\u2019s IBIT leads in AUM, holding $1.4 billion compared to Fidelity\u2019s nearly $1.3 billion.\n\nOther notable ETFs include Invesco\u2019s ETF, which had its best day on Jan. 19, attracting over $63 million, though its total AUM hasn\u2019t surpassed $200 million. VanEck\u2019s ETF has shown similar performance and broke the $100 million mark in AUM on day six of trading.\n\nMeanwhile, Valkyrie Investments and Franklin Templeton\u2019s AUM stood at $71.7 million and $48.6 million, respectively, on Jan. 19. WisdomTree has yet to break the $10 million mark.\n\nGrayscale outflows\n\nThis substantial capital influx into the newly launched Bitcoin ETFs has outpaced the outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which saw its AUM decrease by $2.8 billion in the same period.\n\nGBTC has seen a reduction in its spot Bitcoin shares, amounting to a loss of $1.62 billion in the first four days. This suggests a shift in investor preference towards the new ETFs, which offer regulatory clarity and ease of access.\n\nDespite the volatile nature of Bitcoin, which saw a sell-off in the same period, these ETFs have been successful. This success is partly attributed to redirecting outflows from GBTC to these new spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Bitcoin - 15 years and counting: Key facts to know about the first cryptocurrency in the world | Mint - Mint",
        "content": "Earlier this month, Bitcoin completed 15 years of its existence. Although the maiden crypto token trades above $41,500 per unit in the international crypto exchanges, its glory was conspicuously missing in the early days of inception.\n\nDid you know that the first-ever transaction carried out in bitcoins took place on May 22, 2010 when 10,000 bitcoins were paid to buy two Papa John\u2019s pizzas? Did you also know that it took three years and ten months for bitcoin to touch $1,000 for the first time?\n\nCut to Jan 10, 2024, US markets regulator Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave a green signal to spot bitcoin ETF, garnering an investment to the tune of $4.6 billion within a couple of days.\n\nHow was bitcoin introduced?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s creator Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym used by the inventor) released a whitepaper titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System on October 31, 2008 to a cryptography mailing list.\n\nIn fact, Satoshi took two years writing the code before he completed the last task i.e., the white paper.\n\nHe even mentioned that he was working on bitcoin for two years by the time the white paper was finally released, writing: \u201cI actually did this kind of backwards. I had to write all the code before I could convince myself that I could solve every problem, then I wrote the paper.\"\n\nHe implemented the bitcoin software as open-source code and released it in January 2009. Nakamoto\u2019s identity remains unknown.\n\nThe total number of bitcoins is limited to 21 million. And by design, the number of bitcoins minted per block is reduced by 50 percent about every four years. The creator designed it to create its scarcity to increase its demand and price.\n\nEarlier attempts before bitcoin\n\nEven before bitcoin came into being, several digital cash technologies were released with David Chaum\u2019s e-cash being the first in 1980s. In fact, the very idea that solutions to computational puzzles could have some value was first proposed by cryptographers Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor in 1992.\n\nAnother attempt was made in 2004 when Hal Finney developed the first currency based on reusable proof-of-work. Notably, these attempts were not successful.\n\nTerm \u2018cryptocurrency\u2019 was not used by Satoshi\n\nIt is intriguing to know that the terms \u2018blockchain\u2019 and \u2018cryptocurrency\u2019 were never used in the bitcoin white paper. Instead, Satoshi calls the blockchain a timestamp server.\n\nSurprisingly, Satoshi named bitcoin quite late in the process and it is believed that he wanted to refer to it as \u2018electronic cash\u2019 or \u2018netcoin\u2019.\n\nIn fact, in early emails Satoshi sent to other scientists for review, bitcoin was referred to as \u2018electronic cash\u2019 \u2014 a term that has been in use since the 1990s.\n\nWhere is bitcoin creator now?\n\nAlthough Satoshi never revealed his identity, there are speculations that suggest that Satoshi is, in fact, first bitcoin user Hal Finney or mathematician John Nash.\n\nThere are unconfirmed estimates which say that Nakamoto had already mined nearly one million bitcoins before s/he disappeared a year later in 2010 but only after handing over the network alert key and control of the code repository to Gavin Andresen.\n\nGavin later became lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation, an organization founded in September 2012 to promote bitcoin."

        "title": "What's Hot & Not Besides Bitcoin ETFs - ETF Trends",
        "content": "January 2024 is likely to be remembered for the strong launch of 10 new spot bitcoin ETFs and the uplisting of the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF (GBTC). While we continue to support advisor education about cryptocurrency investing, there are other ETF trends emerging in the first few weeks of the year. Some of these are already part of the Exchange conference agenda.\n\nInvestment-Grade Corporate Bonds Are in Vogue\n\nIt was a tough 2023 for intermediate-term bond ETFs in a rising rate environment. However, these ETFs have been much more popular to start 2024, with rate cuts likely on the horizon. Intermediate-term bond ETFs take on some interest rate, while offering high-quality bond exposure.\n\nThe iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD) had $4.9 billion of net outflows in 2023. However, all of this and more flowed into LQD in the beginning of the new year. The fund had net inflows of $5.5 billion year to date as of January 17, boosting its asset base to $37 billion. LQD has an average duration of approximately eight years and sports an SEC yield of 5.0%.\n\nThe Vanguard Intermediate Term Corporate Bond ETF (VCIT) had net outflows of $650 million through the first nine months of 2023. Yet as investors gained more comfort about potential rate cuts late last year, VCIT gained traction. The ETF had net inflows of $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter. In the first few weeks of 2024, VCIT gathered an additional $870 million. The fundnow manages $46 billion. I\u2019m excited that Jeff Johnson, Vanguard\u2019s head of fixed income product, will be on stage Monday at Exchange next month with Bloomberg\u2019s Katie Greifeld.\n\nThe Invesco BulletShares 2028 Corporate Bond ETF (BSCS) pulled in over $150 million to start 2024, which is impressive for a $1.4 billion offering.\n\nFinancials in Focus\n\nThe Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) was slightly out of favor with investors in 2023. The widely held sector ETF had $85 million in net outflows. But in the initial days of 2024, sentiment significantly improved. The fund added $675 million of new money and manages $35 billion in assets.\n\nThe iShares US Financials ETF (IYF) and the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) also saw modest net inflows. The demand occurred as the start of earnings season was kicking off, led by large-cap banks. \u201cNon-GAAP EPS results from the six major US banks all came in better-than-expected for Q4,\u201d explained Christine Short, head of research, Wall Street Horizon. \u201cFurthermore, forward-looking guidance for 2024 was mostly upbeat. Many banks expect they can continue to count on exceptionally high levels of net interest income to pad their bottom lines.\u201d\n\nXLF and IYF take a market-weighted, industry-diversified approach to the sector. However, they have hefty stakes in these banks. KBE is an equally weighted, industry-targeted alternative.\n\nGold Continues to Lose Its Luster\n\nDespite gaining in value in 2023, gold ETFs collectively had net outflows. Unfortunately, the trend has persisted to start 2024. The SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) has $57 billion in assets but has been bleeding. The largest commodity ETF had $1.1 billion in redemptions in the first few weeks of 2024 on the heels of net outflows in 2023 of $2 billion. Gold ETF peers like the iShares Gold ETF (IAU) and the SPDR Gold MiniShares (GLDM) had more modest redemptions.\n\nGold has declined in value thus far in January, but the weak sentiment could also be due to the emergence of 10 spot bitcoin ETFs. Some ETF-minded investors might prefer digital gold as an alternative to stocks and bonds. It will be worth watching these trends in the month leading up to Exchange. Hope to see you there.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit VettaFi | ETF Trends."

An ETF is a bundle of securities you sell or buy through a brokerage firm on a stock exchange. Bitcoin ETFs are funds that track the value of Bitcoin and trade on traditional financial exchanges rather than decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges. They permit clients to invest in, and gain exposure to, Bitcoin without having to go through the risks and hassle of using a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nOn January 10, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first spot Bitcoin ETFs, also known as an exchange-traded product (ETP.)\n\nWhile the futures market settles the delivery of its underlying assets and futures contracts on a predetermined future date, a spot market is where commodities, stocks, currencies, and bonds are traded with immediate delivery.\n\nETFs are issued by investment companies regulated by the SEC. The shares issued by the ETF are securities that must be registered with the SEC. Like mutual funds, ETFs have stated investment objectives and use professional money managers to meet those objectives.\n\nWith the SEC now permitting spot Bitcoin ETFs, brokers must become deeply familiar with the various cryptocurrencies dominating the space in order to minimize the risks. Unlike in the past, brokers working in traditional finance must become educated on Bitcoin (and Bitcoin ETFs), in order to provide clients with competent investment advice. Clients will rely upon brokers to guide them through these uncharted waters, and being prepared is key. Further, the permissible crypto ETFs will not likely be limited to Bitcoin based ETFs, as there are also pending applications for Ethereum (Eth) ETFs.\n\nEth is the native token of the Ethereum blockchain. Brokers will need to know the differences between the different crypto based ETFs. With this in mind, a brief summary of the regulation best interest and the suitability rules is warranted to detail the broker\u2019s standard of care.\n\nSuitability\n\nAccording to the suitability rule, a broker is mandated to learn about both the securities it recommends, as well as its customers\u2019 financial circumstances and investment objectives. A broker must disclose the known facts and those which are reasonably ascertainable and cannot recommend a security unless there is a reasonable basis for such a recommendation. Generally, a suitability claim stems from a broker-made recommendation to a customer to make an investment that was inappropriate regarding the customer\u2019s financial investment objectives. The standard is detailed in FINRA Rule 2111.\n\nRegulation Best Interest\n\nThe Regulation Best Interest rule, also known as SEC Rule 15l-1, requires SEC registered brokers and their associated persons to act in the \u201cbest interest\u201d of retail customers when making a recommendation of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities. Rule 15l-1(a)(1) necessitates that recommendations must be made without placing the financial or other interest of the broker or associated person ahead of the interest of the retail customer. While the Regulation Best Interest rule does not define best interest, it does provide some safe-harbor provisions. The best interest duty placed upon the broker can be satisfied if the broker complies with four responsibilities addressing disclosure, care, conflicts of interest, and compliance policies and procedures, See Rule 15l-1(2)(i)\u2013(iv), 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.15l-1(2)(i)\u2013(iv).\n\nOf course, with these new opportunities will come a large demand and risk. Risk to the investors, as well as risk for the brokers that do not become fully informed about these new crypto ETFs. Customers are likely to be very intrigued with the newly approved Bitcoin ETFs and brokers need to be fully informed in order to satisfy their standard of care."

After having peaked around $3 trillion in 2021, the total value of all these digital currencies sits at about $1.7 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap.com. Of these, Bitcoin is the most popular, worth more than $800 billion itself. Investors have swarmed to this digital gold rush, often with little knowledge and a lot of hope.\n\nCryptocurrency\u2019s rapid appreciation has many investors questioning the place of stocks in their portfolios. But there are numerous differences between stocks and cryptocurrencies. The most important is that a stock is an ownership interest in a business (backed by the company\u2019s assets and cash flow), whereas cryptocurrency, in most cases, is not backed by anything at all.\n\nIf you\u2019re buying cryptocurrencies, it\u2019s important to understand what you\u2019re purchasing and how they compare to traditional investments such as stocks, which have a solid long-term track record.\n\nShould you invest in cryptocurrency or stocks?\n\nAny savvy investor needs to know exactly what they\u2019re investing in. It\u2019s crucial to weigh the risks and rewards of investing, and what will drive the investment\u2019s success. If they don\u2019t have this kind of information, they can\u2019t make the calculation. In this case, it\u2019s more like gambling than investing.\n\nHere are the key things investors need to know about stocks and cryptocurrency.\n\nStocks\n\nA stock is a fractional ownership interest in a business. It\u2019s easy to lose sight of this, if you become overwhelmed by the wiggling stock prices \u2014 and the potential for profit. As a legal ownership stake in the business, the stock gives shareholders a claim on the assets and cash flow of the business. These back your investment and provide a basis for its valuation.\n\nWhy stocks rise and fall: A stock price moves as investors assess the future success of the company. While investors may become overly optimistic about the stock in the short term, the stock price ultimately depends on the company\u2019s ability to grow its profits over the long term. That is, a stock rises in the long term due to the success of the underlying company.\n\nFor a stock to be a successful investment, the underlying company must perform well over time. (Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide for how to invest in stocks.)\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nGenerally, cryptocurrency is backed by no hard assets (specialized stablecoins being an exception), and that\u2019s the case for the most popular crypto coins such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. A cryptocurrency may allow you to perform certain functions, such as sending money to another person or using smart contracts that automatically execute after specific conditions are met.\n\nWhy cryptocurrencies rise and fall: Because cryptocurrency is not backed by assets or cash flow, the only thing moving crypto prices is speculation driven by sentiment. As sentiment changes, prices shift \u2014 sometimes drastically. So cryptocurrency is driven only by the hope that someone will buy it for more in the future \u2014 what\u2019s called the \u201cgreater fool theory of investing.\u201d\n\nFor a cryptocurrency to be a successful investment, you must get someone to buy it from you for more than you paid for it. That is, the market must be more optimistic about it than you are. (Check out this beginner\u2019s guide to investing in cryptocurrency.)\n\nPros and cons of investing in cryptocurrency vs. stocks\n\nPros of investing in cryptocurrency\n\nPossible hedge against fiat currency: For some investors, one of the biggest appeals of cryptocurrency is its decentralized nature. It\u2019s not controlled by central banks or governments who like to print money and generate inflation in fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar or the euro. Cryptocurrency has been called \u201cdigital gold\u201d by some investors who hold it because they think it will protect them from inflation.\n\nFor some investors, one of the biggest appeals of cryptocurrency is its decentralized nature.

Potential for outsized gains: Buying cryptocurrencies creates the potential for large gains on your investment. Several cryptocurrencies have seen their prices skyrocket since first being introduced. These gains are the main reason people are attracted to cryptocurrencies, but the potential for price appreciation comes with significant risk.\n\nBuying cryptocurrencies creates the potential for large gains on your investment.

New coins are introduced regularly and there are now thousands to choose from. Wide interest in digital currencies: There seems to be a growing interest in cryptocurrencies from investors, companies and governments. Tesla holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet and briefly accepted the digital currency as payment before reversing course. El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, though the International Monetary Fund has urged the country to reverse its decision. Increasing acceptance of digital currencies could be positive for investors.\n\nCons of investing in cryptocurrency\n\nExtreme volatility: Cryptocurrencies have been extremely volatile so far in their relatively young existence. They aren\u2019t backed by anything, so the price they trade at is determined by the whims of traders. Fortunes can be made and lost quickly and there\u2019s no telling where a coin might trade next.\n\nCryptocurrencies have been extremely volatile so far in their relatively young existence.

Cybersecurity risks: Despite cryptocurrency enthusiasts touting the security benefits of digital coins, there have been notable hacks involving cryptocurrencies. It is often difficult to recover stolen funds.\n\nDespite cryptocurrency enthusiasts touting the security benefits of digital coins, there have been notable hacks involving cryptocurrencies.

Regulatory risks: While El Salvador has embraced Bitcoin, many governments are much more skeptical about cryptocurrencies. China has banned them altogether, other countries could follow and the U.S. is regulating them.\n\nPros of investing in stocks\n\nLong history of solid returns: Stocks have a long track record of producing solid investment returns, with the S&P 500 stock index returning about 10 percent over the long-term. Though stocks can be volatile in the short term, they have generally been safe to hold over long periods of time.\n\nStocks have a long track record of producing solid investment returns, with the S&P 500 stock index returning about 10 percent over the long-term.

Accessible: It is easier than ever to invest in stocks these days with many online brokers cutting trading fees to zero. You can invest in individual stocks or choose to purchase a diversified basket of stocks through an index fund. Index funds help keep costs low and you can build a diversified portfolio even if you don\u2019t have much money to start with.\n\nIt is easier than ever to invest in stocks these days with many online brokers cutting trading fees to zero. You can invest in individual stocks or choose to purchase a diversified basket of stocks through an index fund. Index funds help keep costs low and you can build a diversified portfolio even if you don\u2019t have much money to start with. Stronger regulation: Stock exchanges, brokers and companies are all heavily regulated through various government agencies. Companies are required to provide certain information to investors through the Securities and Exchange Commission. No regulatory body is perfect, but stocks have been around for a long time and there are certain important investor protections in place.\n\nCons of investing in stocks\n\nVolatile: When you hold a broad basket of stocks through index funds, stocks are less volatile than cryptocurrencies. Individual stocks can be more volatile, but typically less so than cryptocurrencies. Because of this volatility, stocks are best held as part of a long-term investment plan, so you have time to recover from any short-term losses.\n\nWhen you hold a broad basket of stocks through index funds, stocks are less volatile than cryptocurrencies.

Lower potential for extreme gains: Broad stock indexes such as the S&P 500 likely have less potential for the extreme gains that can sometimes be found among cryptocurrencies. Stocks have returned about 10 percent per year over the long term, whereas it\u2019s not uncommon for cryptocurrencies to move 10 percent in a single day.\n\nOther considerations when investing in stocks vs. crypto\n\nTime horizon\n\nYour time horizon \u2014 when you need the money from an investment \u2014 is a key criterion. The shorter your timeline, the safer your asset should be, so that it\u2019s there when you need it. The more volatile an asset, the less suited it is for those with a short timeline. Generally, experts suggest investors in risky assets such as stocks need at least three years to ride out volatility.\n\nStocks\n\nStocks are often volatile, but they tend to be less volatile than crypto. Individual stocks are more volatile than a portfolio of stocks, which tends to benefit from diversification.\n\nStocks are better suited to investors who can leave their money alone and don\u2019t need to access it. Generally, the longer you can leave it invested, the better.\n\nSome stocks can be more volatile than others. For example, growth stocks tend to fluctuate much more than value stocks or dividend stocks.\n\nInvestors may shift from more aggressive stocks (growth stocks) to safer ones (dividend stocks) as they need to tap their money, such as when they approach retirement.\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nWhile stocks are volatile, cryptocurrency is ridiculously volatile. For example, during 2021, Bitcoin lost more than half its value in a few months and later gained 100 percent. Such volatility makes crypto unsuited for short-term investors.\n\nCrypto is better suited to traders who can leave their money tied up and wait for it to recover. Think years rather than weeks.\n\nPortfolio management\n\nAs you\u2019re thinking about constructing your portfolio, you don\u2019t have to make an either-or choice between cryptocurrency and stocks \u2014 or other kinds of asset such as bonds or funds, either. It\u2019s all about weighting your portfolio in a way that fits your risk and time horizon.\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nGiven its inherent risks, cryptocurrency works better with a small allocation in your overall portfolio. Think 5 percent or less.\n\nEven a small allocation could do wonders for your portfolio if cryptocurrency really takes off. Also, limiting to a small allocation protects you against a complete loss if crypto goes to zero.\n\nIf crypto grows to be a significant portion of your portfolio, you can re-allocate more of your money to stocks to lower your portfolio\u2019s overall risk.\n\nStocks\n\nGiven stocks\u2019 strong long-term record, a diversified collection of stocks should make up the majority of your portfolio, especially if you have decades until you need to tap it.\n\nIf you\u2019re investing in individual stocks, you\u2019ll need to research your stocks carefully to achieve good returns.\n\nIf you\u2019re investing in funds, you can buy a broadly diversified fund such as an S&P 500 index fund without significant research and enjoy the potential for high returns.\n\nWhich is safer, stocks or crypto?\n\nWhen it comes to safety, both stocks and cryptocurrencies present their unique set of risks. Stocks, backed by a company\u2019s assets and cash flow, have a long history of delivering solid returns. They are regulated by government bodies and have investor protections in place. However, market volatility, business decisions, and international events can impact stock investments.\n\nOn the other hand, cryptocurrencies, while offering the potential for substantial gains, are highly volatile and lack the backing of tangible assets. They also pose risks such as cybersecurity threats and regulatory uncertainties. Therefore, the safety of these investments largely depends on your personal risk tolerance and financial goals.\n\nA broadly diversified stock portfolio generally presents a safer option than cryptocurrencies because of their intrinsic value and history of delivering solid long-term returns. Cryptocurrencies may hold greater potential for outsized gains, but come with significant risk.\n\nBottom line\n\nSome cryptocurrencies have soared in price since being introduced over the past few years, but investors need to understand what they\u2019re investing in, instead of just rushing in because other traders are, a symptom of FOMO syndrome (fear of missing out). If you decide to take a stake in crypto, consider how it fits with your own risk tolerance and financial needs. Investors can earn good returns without investing in cryptocurrency, and some investors, including legends such as Warren Buffett, won\u2019t touch cryptocurrency.\n\nEditorial Disclaimer: All investors are advised to conduct their own independent research into investment strategies before making an investment decision. In addition, investors are advised that past investment product performance is no guarantee of future price appreciation.\n\n\u2013 Bankrate\u2019s Brian Baker, CFA contributed to an update to this article."

        "content": "The net outflows for Grayscale\u2019s new spot bitcoin ETF offset big asset gains made by a slate of rival US offerings.\n\nMoney has been flowing out of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) since it launched alongside nine other spot bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 11. Grayscale Investments saw outflows of more than $2.2 billion last week, according to CoinShares data.\n\nGBTC launched in 2013 and currently has roughly $23.5 billion in assets under management. The fund converted to an ETF earlier this month, allowing investors to sell shares of the fund at its net asset value.\n\nThe Grayscale ETF charges a 1.5% fee \u2014 substantially higher than similar offerings in the US, which charge between 0.19% and 0.39%.\n\nRead more: Why the planned fee for Grayscale\u2019s bitcoin ETF is much higher than others\n\nCoinDesk reported Monday that bankrupt crypto exchange FTX has sold roughly 22 million GBTC shares, worth nearly $1 billion \u2014 accounting for a large chunk of the fund\u2019s latest outflows. Blockworks could not immediately confirm this report.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s $2.2 billion of net outflows countered the big bitcoin ETF inflows reeled in by two financial services giants. BlackRock and Fidelity Investments last week notched net crypto-related inflows of $931 million and $860 million, respectively, CoinShares data shows.\n\nWhile BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust reached $1 billion in assets after four days of trading, Fidelity\u2019s bitcoin fund eclipsed the milestone on its fifth trading day.\n\nThe spot bitcoin ETF by Bitwise has so far grown to about $425 million in assets, while one by Ark Invest and 21Shares has reached about $380 million, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin ETF Tracker\n\nDespite the slight net outflows driven by money leaving GBTC, crypto investment product trading volumes last week reached $11.8 billion. The figure is about seven times the average weekly volumes seen in 2023, CoinShares research head James Butterfill wrote in a Monday report.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nGrayscale wasn\u2019t the only firm to see assets leave its crypto fund.\n\nPurpose Investments, which launched the first spot bitcoin ETF in Canada in February 2021, endured roughly $102 million in outflows last week.\n\nUS products overall saw $263 million of net inflows last week. This compared to the $297 million of net outflows seen across products in Canada and Europe \u2014 suggesting \u201cminor migration of assets to the US, where fees are currently more competitive,\u201d Butterfill noted.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Grayscale NAV flips BlackRock as IBIT records first discount to Bitcoin since launch - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust recorded its first discount to its Net Asset Value (NAV) on Jan. 19, dropping to a discounted rate of -0.30%, according to official BlackRock data.\n\n\u201cThe above table and line graph present information about the differences between the daily closing price for shares of the fund and the fund\u2019s net asset value. The closing prices are determined by the fund\u2019s listing exchange.\u201d \u2013 BlackRock\n\nConversely, after a prolonged period at a heavy discount, Grayscale\u2019s (GBTC) NAV is now slightly tighter at just -0.27%, according to Y Charts data. GBTC saw a staggering 48% discount to NAV on Dec. 22. However, as anticipation of its conversion to a spot, Bitcoin ETF rose, the discount closed, reaching just -1.55% on the day it was converted. The discount has continued to close and has surpassed even some of the \u2018Newborn Nine\u2019 Bitcoin ETFs, such as IBIT.\n\nIn its first week, the iShares Bitcoin Trust experienced a varied NAV per share, beginning at $26.59 and seeing a decrease to $23.87 by Jan. 19. The trust\u2019s outstanding shares showed a significant increase from 400,000 to over 50 million within the same period.\n\nThe NAV premium/discount fluctuated modestly, recording a premium of 0.16% on launch day, peaking at 0.42% by Jan. 17, before declining to a discount. This change indicates the investors\u2019 valuation of the shares relative to the underlying Bitcoin assets held by the trust. A premium suggests shares are valued higher than the NAV, while a discount indicates a lower valuation. The reference rate for Bitcoin used was $41,898, calculated between 8 pm and 9 pm GMT (3 pm \u2013 4 pm EST), as highlighted in the chart below.\n\nThe underlying Bitcoin price has declined toward the psychological support of $40,000, trading at $40,840 as of press time, while IBIT shares are trading at $23.39 pre-market after closing at $23.80 on Friday, Jan. 19.\n\nTherefore, IBIT shares have declined 1.72% since Friday\u2019s trading session. In contrast, the underlying asset, Bitcoin, will have fallen around 2.5% if it does not recover before the reference rate (BRRNY) is calculated later today. Should IBIT shares trade in line with Bitcoin throughout Jan. 22, it will likely reverse the discount and rise to a premium potentially as high as 0.7% based on current calculations. However, with the primary market not opening for several hours, IBIT may close this gap during official trading hours.\n\nGiven the time lag in reporting ETF data, the impact of the reported NAV is limited. In its prospectus, BlackRock said it would publish an intra-day indicative nav (IIV). Still, this data is not published on its official website but should be available under IBIT.IIV through Nasdaq trading terminals.\n\nSince its launch, the Assets Under Management (AUM) of the iShares Bitcoin Trust have reached $1,346,912,907.59, with 33,430 BTC under management, emphasizing the scale at which the trust is operating and the level of investment that it has attracted in a short period. Tied with the increase in outstanding shares, the overall health of the trust suggests a growing investor interest as the number of shares is more than tenfold.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Hackers Use Pirated Software on MacOS To Infect Bitcoin Wallets With Malware\n\nKaspersky Labs has uncovered a new family of trojan proxies that target macOS users and steal their Bitcoin and crypto wallets.\n\nThe malware is distributed through pirated software downloaded from unauthorized sources. The hackers behind the malware take advantage of the fact that users looking for cracked apps are more likely to disable security on their machines and download installers from questionable websites. This makes it easier for them to trick users into installing the malware along with the pirated software.\n\nThe malware targets macOS versions 13.6 and above. It gains access to a user's computer security password when the user enters it into an activator box and to the private keys to crypto wallets when the user tries to open crypto wallets compromised by the malware.\n\nKaspersky researchers observed that the malware was still under development as they traced it. Despite its basic method, the malware is described as \"seriously ingenious.\" It includes a backdoor that can run any scripts with administrator privileges and replace Exodus and Bitcoin crypto wallet applications with infected versions that steal secret recovery phrases when the wallet is unlocked.\n\nTo avoid falling victim to this malware campaign, Kaspersky recommends using trusted websites, keeping the computer's operating system updated, and using a security solution on the machine.\n\nThe researchers also noted that other techniques used by hackers include disguising malware as a legitimate wallet on online stores or fake websites. This activity has become so common that the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a warning about it.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "Hong Kong is gearing up to launch its first spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by mid-2024, a move that could redefine the landscape of digital asset investment in the region, according to Jan. 22 news reports.\n\nMultiple firms are looking to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs within the coming months now that Hong Kong has softened its stance toward the industry and begun to establish regulatory frameworks.\n\nETF trend\n\nThe ETF trend is picking up steam after the U.S. SEC approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 10 after more than a decade of rejecting such products. This has caused regulators worldwide to adopt a more favorable approach toward such products and crypto.\n\nThe impending introduction of spot crypto ETFs in Hong Kong signifies a pivotal moment in integrating cryptocurrency into mainstream finance, and their launch is seen as a strategic move to capitalize on the burgeoning demand in the Asian time zone.\n\nThese ETFs are expected to provide a regulated avenue for investing in digital assets, thereby offering significant benefits, including promoting orderly markets for underlying cryptocurrencies, enhancing investor protection, and facilitating the amalgamation of digital asset platforms with traditional financial institutions.\n\nHowever, challenges remain, particularly regarding fee structures and regulatory compliance. With only two licensed crypto exchanges in Hong Kong, there is pressure to ensure that fees remain reasonable.\n\nThe Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) requires virtual asset funds be held on licensed digital asset trading platforms or banks meeting specific custodial standards.\n\nUpcoming ETFs\n\nGary Tiu, executive director and head of regulatory affairs at OSL, told reporters that the firm is in advanced discussions with a range of fund companies, with about five to ten companies actively exploring the launch of such ETFs.\n\nHe noted that among these, approximately five are progressing more swiftly, potentially leading to the debut of Hong Kong\u2019s first spot crypto ETFs within the year.\n\nHashKey, another licensed crypto exchange in Hong Kong, echoed similar sentiments earlier this month. Livio Weng, the COO of HashKey, noted that about ten fund companies are considering the launch of spot crypto ETFs in the region.\n\nAdding to the momentum, Venture Smart Financial Holdings is planning a spot bitcoin ETF launch within the first quarter of 2024 to manage assets worth $500 million by the end of the year.\n\nMeanwhile, according to local media reports, current market players, including Samsung Asset Management and CSOP Asset Management, are closely monitoring these developments to assess market demand and regulatory conditions before venturing into spot crypto ETFs."

The profits have gained the interest of many global financial institutions, including BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, with almost $10 trillion worth of assets under management.\n\nHowever, despite BTC\u2019s massive profits, financial giants were cautious about entering the cryptocurrency market, likely due to the volatility. Institutions preferred having a spot ETF (Exchange Traded Fund), which would reduce risks. The US SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) made a historic decision earlier this month and approved 11 spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs. One of the applicants is BlackRock.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Sees Value in ETH ETF\n\nAs of today, the world\u2019s largest asset manager holds 11,439 BTC, worth around $469,925,559. BlackRock currently has the second-highest BTC holdings, behind GrayScale, among the funds approved by the SEC.\n\nDespite the massive holding, BlackRock is not the top Bitcoin holder. BTC creator Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s wallet still has the highest amount of BTC, with more than 1 million coins, valued at around $35 billion today.\n\nWill BlackRock\u2019s involvement in Bitcoin push BTC\u2019s price?\n\nSource: WatcherGuru\n\nBeing the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock will not enter an industry without considering the risks. The firm\u2019s entry into the industry is a testament to the asset\u2019s potential. Spot BTC ETFs have already seen billions of dollars worth of inflows. Moreover, this figure may continue to rise over this year. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has gone as far as to call BTC digital gold. Fink stated, \u2018If you\u2019re fearful of your government, or worrying your government is devaluing the currency, then you could see this as a great potential long-term store of value.\u2018\n\nAlso Read: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Calls Bitcoin Digital Gold\n\nThe sentiment around spot BTC ETFs will likely reflect in Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price. Many analysts anticipate BTC\u2019s price to surpass $100,000 by the end of this decade. Some analysts have painted even more bullish scenarios, with predictions of BTC hitting $1 million."

According to Zeberg, Bitcoin has embarked on a trajectory that could see it soar to $120,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKnown for his accurate forecasts, the expert draws parallels between current market conditions and previous instances in 2017 and 2020, highlighting a striking resemblance in the current correction phase. With an optimistic tone, he speculates that history will repeat itself in 2024, anticipating a bullish surge in Bitcoin's value.\n\nBacking his prediction with a detailed Bitcoin price chart, Zeberg illustrates the patterns and key levels supporting his optimistic outlook. The chart serves as a visual representation of the trader's analysis, providing a comprehensive overview of a potential upward trajectory for the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nAltcoin season\n\nThis forecast comes hot on the heels of Zeberg's earlier prediction regarding Bitcoin dominance. Just a week prior, he noted a clear rollover of RSI and MACD, signaling a potential top in Bitcoin's dominance. Despite this, Zeberg maintains that BTC still has room for upward movement in the coming months, setting the stage for an intriguing dynamic between Bitcoin and altcoins.\n\nIn an unexpected twist, Zeberg foresees a period where altcoins could outshine BTC on the market. Anticipating an altcoin season, he suggests that the rally led by Bitcoin may be surpassed by altcoins, ushering in a phase of increased bullishness and FOMO.\n\nIf history repeats itself, crypto enthusiasts may witness a remarkable surge to $120,000, reshaping the landscape of the market in the coming months."

The executive also argued that Bitcoin \u201cdoes nothing\u201d and laid out criminal use cases for the asset.\n\n\"There are cryptocurrencies that do something, that might have value.

The community member believes that the negativity directed toward BTC might be an attempt to lower the price as he stacks sats himself.\n\nMeanwhile, some think Dimon is uninformed about Bitcoin, while others believe the executive is simply scooping up Bitcoin in preparation for the upcoming halving. Many believe that the halving event will drive the asset\u2019s price upward.\n\nWhile Dimon\u2019s notion that Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto could come back and \u201cerase\u201d Bitcoin may be flawed due to its inherent characteristics, a community member brought up the possibility of Nakamoto selling his Bitcoin stash.

The \"Genesis Cat\" Ordinals inscription, created by digital artist FAR, received over 50 bids, with the winning bid reaching 6.31 BTC, equivalent to approximately $254,000.\n\nEarlier this month, Taproot Wizards, the project behind the Quantum Cats collection, revealed the creation of 3,333 images inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain. The entire collection reportedly cost over $66,000 to create. The sale for the wider collection is scheduled to take place on January 29.\n\nAccording to Udi Wertheimer, co-founder of Taproot Wizards, the Quantum Cats collection pays homage to an early code in the Bitcoin network called concatenate or OP_CAT. This \"ancient 'op code'\" was introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first release of Bitcoin but was later disabled.\n\nMichael Bouhanna, head of digital and contemporary art at Sotheby's, expressed his congratulations to the artists and collectors involved in the sale. Bouhanna revealed that the Natively Digital curated Ordinals sale generated over 26 BTC, approximately $1,097,000, with 641 bids and all auction lots sold. Notably, half of the sale exceeded their high estimates.\n\nWhile this is Sotheby's first Bitcoin Ordinals-centric sale, the auction house has previously handled numerous NFT sales on Ethereum.

        "content": "Kevin Svenson, a prominent cryptocurrency analyst and trader, has made a compelling prediction regarding the potential trajectory of Bitcoin (BTC) in relation to the S&P 500.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s potential surge to a new all-time high\n\nIn his YouTube video entitled \u201cBITCOIN WILL FOLLOW S&P 500 INTO ALL TIME HIGHS,\u201d Svenson discusses the possibility of Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs, drawing parallels to the performance of the S&P 500, stating that the S&P has consistently led Bitcoin in all-time high breaks, and this is promising as Bitcoin is still below 40% it\u2019s all-time high while the S&P is approaching its peak.\n\nThis prediction is based on his analysis of market trends and indicators, suggesting that Bitcoin could experience a significant surge in the coming months, potentially mirroring the record highs of the S&P 500.\n\nAccording to Svenson, the S&P 500\u2019s position serves as a key factor in his projection for Bitcoin\u2019s future performance. He suggests that Bitcoin may be just months away from achieving a new all-time high, aligning with the upward momentum of the S&P 500.\n\nCiting his analysis, there is a possibility of Bitcoin experiencing further upward movement before the next Bitcoin Halving. He also noted a historical pattern where a dip occurred before a bull run preceding the previous Bitcoin Halving events.\n\nHe elaborated that should the S&P 500 surpass its All-Time High, Bitcoin might also follow suit.\n\nIn October, Svenson predicted that Bitcoin\u2019s value could soar to $70,000, contingent upon certain key developments.\n\nAccording to Svenson, his prediction is backed by data-driven insights and pivotal market shifts.\n\nFirst was the crucial resistance level of $32,000, an increase in Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility following the establishment of $32,000 and the now-approved spot Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund).\n\nHe further emphasized that even if Bitcoin doesn\u2019t immediately breach its all-time high, we should anticipate significant price fluctuations, particularly around the $32,000, from this analysis, the cryptocurrency market could soon witness Bitcoin breaking past the $70,000 threshold.\n\nNotably, Svenson didn\u2019t base his forecast solely on market patterns. He also draws attention to the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund).\n\nYou might also like: Peter Brandt: Bitcoin halving and ETF are much ado about nothing\n\nMore volatility expected\n\nBitcoin, the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency, has been on a rollercoaster ride in recent years. One of the most significant events that could impact Bitcoin\u2019s price is the upcoming Bitcoin halving, which is scheduled to occur in 2024.\n\nThe halving is a process that occurs every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years.\n\nWhen a halving occurs, the reward for mining a block of Bitcoin is cut in half. This means that fewer new Bitcoins are being created, which can lead to an increase in demand and price.\n\nHistorically, Bitcoin has always pumped after halving. In 2012, the price of Bitcoin increased from around $12 to over $266. In 2016, the price of Bitcoin increased from around $400 to over $1,900. And in 2020, the price of Bitcoin increased from around $7,000 to over $60,000.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $41,617, with a market cap of over $815 billion, according to CoinGecko\n\nRead more: Next Bitcoin halving just 15k blocks away\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "On Jan. 10, the SEC approved 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), unprecedentedly allowing crypto-backed ETFs to trade on public markets. Within 24 hours, Bitcoin ETF trading volume ballooned to $4.6 billion, and Bitcoin price rose above $48,000 at one point. But the hype fizzled out quickly, with Bitcoin dropping more than 8 percent two days after the SEC\u2019s milestone decision.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter Sign Up Thank you for signing up!

See all of our newsletters\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs were approved in a 3-2 vote by the commissioners of the SEC after a federal court ruled last August the SEC was wrong to reject an application by Grayscale Investments to list a crypto ETF. \u201cMuch of this was already priced in,\u201d Roxanna Islam, head of sector and industry research at the indexing firm VettaFi, told Observer. \u201cWhen Grayscale won its lawsuit against the SEC, we knew these spot Bitcoin ETFs were probably going to be approved.\u201d\n\nBitcoin ETFs are marred with controversy. In a dissenting statement, Caroline Crenshaw, one of the five SEC commissioners, criticized widespread fraud allegations in the ETFs\u2019 underlying crypto market, citing an analysis of 157 crypto exchanges that found \u201c51 percent of the reported daily Bitcoin trading volume was likely bogus.\u201d However, SEC Commissioner Hestor Pierce in her statement on the approval argued that \u201cmarket manipulation is not unique to crypto\u201d and that the SEC has \u201ctools to address such issues as they appear.\u201d Pierce has long advocated for the SEC to treat crypto just like any other asset class. \u201cCongress did not authorize us to tell people whether a particular investment is right for them,\u201d she said in her statement.\n\nCryptocurrency overall remains a polarizing subject in the financial industry. In an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon doubled down on his doubts about crypto, saying he does not care for the recent Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nOther big players are more optimistic. On Jan. 17, BlackRock (BLK)\u2019s iShares \u200b\u200bBitcoin ETF (IBIT) became the first of its type to hit more than $1 billion in assets under management in its first week of trading. Fidelity, Ark21 and Invesco are other big firms that have introduced Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock gained more inflows than competing asset managers in part thanks to its lower management fee of 0.2 percent (compared to Grayscale\u2019s 1.5 percent, for example) and its broader name recognition.\n\nVettaFi\u2019s Islam views the SEC\u2019s approval as a huge turning point for the crypto industry and expects the entrance of institutional investors to bring more stability to the underlying crypto market. \u201cNow you have these big names like Fidelity and BlackRock with these products, and that provides comfort to investors who may have been nervous,\u201d she said.\n\nIt is difficult to project Bitcoin ETFs\u2019 future impact on the crypto market by looking at historical examples. While gold ETFs garnered similar hype when they were first launched in the early 2000s, Bitcoin has a limited supply, far more volatility and less oversight on the uses of the underlying asset.\n\nIn the near term, Bitcoin ETFs could disrupt major crypto exchanges. For example, Coinbase\u2019s margin and trade volume is threatened by the low-cost and easy access of the Bitcoin ETFs, Reuters reported last week, as customers no longer need to create a digital wallet on Coinbase or similar platforms to gain exposure to crypto.\n\nAlso unclear is what future regulation the crypto market can expect from the SEC. Commissioner Pierce told Observer she hopes the agency can \u201cchange course\u201d from the current direction of \u201cone market in the U.S. and another in the world due to our lack of regulatory clarity.\u201d\n\nHowever, not all SEC Commissioners are on the same page. In his statement on the Bitcoin ETF approval, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said the agency \u201cdid not approve or endorse Bitcoin\u201d and \u201cnor does the approval signal anything about the Commission\u2019s views as to the status of other crypto assets.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin Investor Demand Weakens in the US Post-ETF Approval: CryptoQuant - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Roughly a week after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first wave of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), BTC investor demand in the country has slumped.\n\nAccording to a weekly report from market intelligence platform CryptoQuant, the weak BTC demand from U.S. investors is evident in crypto exchange Coinbase\u2019s premium turning negative for the first time in 2024 amid high selling activity from short-term holders.\n\nBTC Investor Demand Slumps\n\nCryptoQuant said the spot Bitcoin ETF approval was a sell-the-news event, as expected. Although the products started trading on January 11 with record volumes, Coinbase saw high over-the-counter transfer volumes running into billions of dollars, and the funds are trading at a premium to spot Bitcoin for the first time since March 2021; BTC has witnessed a downward price pressure.\n\nBTC had lost roughly 15% of its value in days, from $49,000 to $41,500. While the asset currently hovers around $42,800 and downward pressure seems to have eased up, on-chain indicators suggest a tendency for more price corrections.\n\nCurrently, short-term investors and large BTC holders have turned into a \u201crisk-off\u201d attitude and are on a selling spree. This is seen in the Inter-exchange Flow Pulse (IFP) metric falling below its 90-day moving average for the first time since August 2021. Analysts at CryptoQuant say this is a sign that investors\u2019 BTC flow to derivative exchanges has stopped growing, suggesting caution and the tendency for price corrections.\n\nUnrealized Profit Margins Still High\n\nAccording to the report, it appears the Bitcoin market will not hit a price bottom soon as unrealized profit margins have not declined enough for sellers to be exhausted. As such, a new rally is presently not on the cards.\n\nFrom a short-term perspective, BTC has plummeted to more sustainable levels, with short-term holders\u2019 unrealized profit falling from 48% in December 2023 to 16% after the asset\u2019s latest slump. However, the profit margins may need to go below 0% before we can call a price bottom.\n\nMeanwhile, CryptoQuant predicted BTC might eventually plunge to $32,000, the short-term holder realized price, as traders paid too much to open long positions before the ETF approval."

        "title": "Let's pour one out for the first-day spot bitcoin ETF investors - Blockworks",
        "content": "Those who bought shares in spot bitcoin ETFs earlier this month have suffered a frustrating feeling common among crypto investors \u2014 as soon as you buy bitcoin, the price goes down.\n\nReddit thread after Reddit thread details similar experiences. This time around is particularly special, in that BlackRock, Fidelity, VanEck (the very ones some prophesied to bring bitcoin to new heights) and others bought 95,300 BTC ($3.8 billion) in six days and the price of bitcoin still went down nearly 20%.\n\nHow much of that bitcoin was acquired through Coinbase spot markets, third party brokers or OTC desks isn\u2019t really known. In any case, bitcoin\u2019s recent dumping only proves that the idea of Wall Street buying bitcoin is more powerful than their actual arrival.\n\nIt turns out that some of traditional finance\u2019s biggest operators are still small fish in a big bitcoin pond. So far, all benefit to bitcoin\u2019s price because of the ETFs came well before SEC approval, and any buying pressure associated with the funds has clearly given way to the sellside.\n\nBitcoin rallied up to 80% \u2014 from $27,000 to $49,000 \u2014 between BlackRock\u2019s initial ETF filing last June and their launch on Jan. 11, although not in a straight line.\n\nWelcome to bitcoin\n\nThe good vibes associated with BlackRock and all the others buying billions in bitcoin have been sadly dampened by the billions in bitcoin flowing out of Grayscale\u2019s bitcoin trust (GBTC), now a spot ETF.\n\nSpot ETFs buy and hold bitcoin on behalf of shareholders. More net inflows means more bitcoin off the market \u2014 reducing the active supply and maybe even boosting prices should demand stay high.\n\nGBTC saw $2.8 billion bitcoin pulled as $3.95 billion was funneled into the new suite of spot ETFs, all of which have lower management fees.\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly knowable how much of those flows represent the same capital. Still, bitcoin\u2019s sagging price has been blamed in part on anyone who\u2019d redeemed their GBTC shares for bitcoin, only to sell it.\n\nIf that\u2019s true, then the hundreds of millions in liquidations over the past few days is just collateral damage in a Wall Street fee war.\n\nRead more from our opinion section: Let\u2019s be real: Bitcoin ETFs have never really mattered\n\nAs of last Friday, GBTC still had about 552,000 BTC ($22.34 billion) under management, or about 3% of bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply. Markets could be influenced by the fallout for some time.\n\nIn any case, it\u2019s clear that net flows to ETFs have so far outstripped fresh supply. Bitcoin miners generate 900 BTC ($36.4 million) per day and net flows of spot ETFs convert to nearly 15,900 BTC ($643.5 million) on average per day so far \u2014 16 times the difference between them.\n\nBitcoin ETF buyers \u2014 you\u2019re not a alone\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs are unique in financial history in that their underlying asset \u2014 bitcoin \u2014 is artificially scarce and provably finite.\n\nThere will only ever be close to 21 million BTC in existence, barring the seemingly unlikely event that network participants agree otherwise. So far, more than 93% of that supply has already been mined and is considered to be circulating.\n\nCompare that to oil: At current consumption rates, the world has just under 50 years of oil sitting in proven reserves, equal to 1.65 trillion barrels (which sounds dire but we may never truly run out of oil). Researchers estimate the commercial drilling industry has extracted 1.14 trillion barrels since 1850 \u2014 which means about 60% of the oil supply is still in the ground.\n\nAs for gold, the world\u2019s proven reserves (unmined gold) are about equal to a quarter of above-ground stocks. Roughly half of that is in jewelry and another 22% is in bars and coins (some of which is held by gold-backed ETFs).\n\nThat institutions are buying bitcoin faster than it can be mined to satisfy billions in fresh capital sounds like the beginnings of hyperbitcoinization.\n\nHyperbitcoinization is the foretold process of the entire world shifting over to the bitcoin standard, pricing everything on earth in parabolic prices. A more cartoony version of potential events would see early investors be made so rich they could build floating bitcoin-powered citadels in the sky in which to live and rule over humanity. It\u2019s an ironic iteration of the seasteading popular among Silicon Valley billionaires like Peter Thiel.\n\nIt\u2019s far too early to tell how BlackRock might contribute to that vision. Regardless, the fact that an overwhelming majority of bitcoin is already in circulation undermines any impact of current daily issuance when it comes to supply and demand, and even more so after the next halving in April.\n\nLoading Tweet.. The breadth of modern life runs on the internet. Why not bitcoin too?\n\nMore than $21 billion in bitcoin is traded daily right now and bitcoin\u2019s issuance pales in comparison. Far more important than issuance is whether current holders will sell if bitcoin\u2019s price goes up significantly from here.\n\nBitcoin miners themselves could be one source of supply. As a group, miners hold 1.83 million BTC ($67.9 billion), per CryptoQuant data, which tracks addresses receiving block rewards over time. Those addresses hold more than 9% of the supply, down from 14% in 2016.\n\nMiners have historically grown their treasuries (saved their bitcoin) during downturns and reduced their holdings (sold some of their supply) on the way up.\n\nThere\u2019s some evidence of this happening lately: Net flows from miner treasuries hit -10,522 BTC ($427 million) last Wednesday, the largest overall outflow in nearly three years, since the early days of the last bull market.\n\nBitcoin traders could otherwise bridge the gap. Crypto exchanges control about 11% of bitcoin in existence, and that bitcoin generally represents user deposits. Net flows into US-listed spot bitcoin ETFs to date has so far been equal to less than half a percent of bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply.\n\nSome analysts have predicted up to $100 billion in inflows over the next year, which at current prices could end up representing one-tenth of all bitcoin in existence. That would certainly matter.\n\nBut whether bitcoin is dumping due to Grayscale outflows, a strengthening US dollar or simple consolidation of its outsized performance last year doesn\u2019t really matter.\n\nThe price goes down when there are more sellers than buyers, and daily bitcoin issuance has very little to do with it. And the same goes for Wall Street \u2014 for now.\n\nSo, let\u2019s pour one out for the buyers of bitcoin spot ETFs on their first day, who BlackRock awkwardly says is a mix of retail and new investors to the crypto asset class.\n\nDue to bitcoin\u2019s poor performance, they could be down as much as 20% in less than two weeks depending on when they bought.\n\nA classic bitcoin experience.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Funding fees bridge the difference between spot prices and prices of futures contracts of an asset by increasing liquidation risks faced by traders. A consistently high and positive funding rate implies there is a bullish sentiment among market participants and there is an expectation of a price hike. A consistently negative funding rate for an asset implies a bearish sentiment, indicating that traders expect the cryptocurrency\u2019s price to fall and a bearish trend reversal is likely to occur.\n\nHigher Open Interest is associated with higher liquidity and new capital inflow to the market. This is considered the equivalent of increase in efficiency and the ongoing trend continues. When Open Interest decreases, it is considered a sign of liquidation in the market, investors are leaving and the overall demand for an asset is on a decline, fueling a bearish sentiment among investors.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is struggling on Monday morning to keep its head above volatile waters, trading at $41,000, after its value fell last week. A decline in open interest by large-wallet investors (popularly known as whales), coupled with an increase of their Tether (USDT) reserves on Bitfinex, suggests that the downward trend for BTC price could extend in the short term.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

        "content": "On this episode of the \u201cETF of the Week\u201d podcast, Todd Rosenbluth discussed the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) with Chuck Jaffe of \u201c Money Life .\u201d The pair talked about several topics regarding the fund to give investors a deeper understanding of the ETF overall.\n\n\n\nBitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB)\n\nChuck Jaffe: One fund is on point for today and the experts to talk about it. This is the ETF of the Week podcast. Welcome to the ETF of the Week, where we get the latest take from the experts at VettaFi.com. It\u2019s a site that has built and developed fabulous tools so you can be a savvy, sound investor in exchange-traded funds. And normally, well for over a decade, the ETF of the Week has pretty much always featured Tom Lydon, vice chairman at VettaFi.\n\nBut VettaFi has built, grown, and done a bunch of other things, and Tom is going to be stepping back just a little bit. He\u2019s still going to be here a lot. But joining me today is Todd Rosenbluth. He is the head of research at VettaFi. Again, it\u2019s VettaFi.com if you want more information. Todd Rosenbluth, great to chat with you.\n\nTodd Rosenbluth: It\u2019s great to be with you, Chuck. Thanks a lot for having me on.\n\nChuck Jaffe: Your ETF of the Week is?\n\nTodd Rosenbluth: The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB).\n\nChuck Jaffe: The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, ticker symbol BITB. How is this the ETF of the Week? As of the day that this airs, it\u2019s a week old, because that\u2019s the day that all of the bitcoin ETFs that are spot bitcoin ETFs came out. But there were like a dozen of them. So why this bitcoin ETF for ETF of the Week?\n\nTodd Rosenbluth: So BITB came to market, as you mentioned, Thursday, January 11. What excites us about this is, bitcoin overall, is a part of Bitwise\u2019s heritage. So this ETF gathered over $200 million in its first day of trading. It continued to see trading volume and is a low-cost, effective way of getting exposure to bitcoin. It actually has a fee of 0.00 for the months in the initial asset gathering, and is going to be quite cheap, at just 20 basis points once it crosses that threshold.\n\nSo we thought this ETF was a great one to highlight in this milestone.\n\nChuck Jaffe: How much difference do you see between the bitcoin ETFs? One of the things that\u2019s really interesting to me is everybody\u2019s focused on what are the expense ratios going to be and the funds, because there are so many of them. They are kind of having a race to get as low as they can. But because of the rules, as I understand them, with the spot bitcoin ETFs, you\u2019re going to have higher trading costs because there\u2019s not a national bid.\n\nAsk spreads and things along those lines and trading costs are in addition to the expense ratio. They\u2019re not part of the expense ratio. So do you believe that\u2019s going to show up, and is that going to make a difference as to which bitcoin ETF you\u2019re going to want to own?\n\nTodd Rosenbluth: We do think liquidity is going to matter for investors, and the trading costs a bit, as the spread that you reference is going to be important. We\u2019re days into the trading, so we\u2019ve seen some pretty tight spreads overall for the industry, Bitwise ETFs in particular.\n\nBut what actually excites us most is that we at VettaFi hosted a Cryptocurrency Symposium the day after these products first launched, and we asked investor groups and advisors what mattered most to them. And it was actually the expertise of the firm that mattered more than the expense ratio. It mattered more than liquidity, it mattered more than the breadth of services. It was the expertise of the firm.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why Bitwise is the firm we wanted to highlight today. It\u2019s got a long history of focusing on bitcoin investing. It would educate investors on how it can fit into a portfolio.\n\nWe\u2019re going to talk about some of those key developments coming up in 2024. You often want to go to a partner where this is the area of expertise, and we think that Bitwise is one of those firms.\n\nChuck Jaffe: Will there be a difference to you in terms of which bitcoin ETF you want if you\u2019re a short-term trader versus a long-term, hold, or hold on for dear life here?\n\nTodd Rosenbluth: I think most people are probably going to have a short- to intermediate-term time horizon as these products get up to speed. But we do think a long time horizon makes sense. And so if that\u2019s the case, the expense ratio is going to matter. We\u2019re hearing investors and advisors who are looking to put a low single-digit percentage of their portfolio into bitcoin and have it stay there and have it grow overall.\n\nAnd so if that\u2019s the case, you want to make sure that the total cost of ownership, the expense ratio, as well as the trading volume, are important to you.\n\nChuck Jaffe: I\u2019m always asking Tom Lydon about trend following, because that\u2019s his origin story. He, of course, was a trend follower early on. These funds are brand new, so we don\u2019t have 200-day moving averages and won\u2019t for quite some time. But do you believe that these will be heavily trend-followed and heavily traded, and liquidity is going to matter in terms of which one\u2019s going to be your tool to be your proxy for bitcoin?\n\nTodd Rosenbluth: I think the trend is going to be the same for all of these ETFs because of the underlying spot bitcoin, and how it is going to trade. And of course, 2023 was an excellent year for bitcoin. It was one of the best-performing assets overall. If there was an ETF, it would have been among the better-performing ETFs that were there.\n\nAnd so we know that we\u2019ve seen a real rise in price leading into the potential and now the ultimate launching of these 10 bitcoin ETFs and the conversion of two other ones. Time will tell whether or not 2024 is a great year for bitcoin investing. But for those who want to have an allocation, we think this is a good way of getting exposure.\n\nYou of course get the benefits of an ETF and it trades on an exchange during market hours. You get to see the transparency of what that trade is going to cost you. It just makes it much easier for people who\u2019ve owned ETFs over the years to allocate to bitcoin using an ETF like BITB.\n\nChuck Jaffe: Does it make the bitcoin futures ETFs \u2014 which was how people had to trade bitcoin \u2014 obsolete? I mean, if you\u2019re a bitcoin owner, you want to be a bitcoin owner. Is there any reason now that spot bitcoin ETFs are there that you would go instead with the futures-based ETFs?\n\nTodd Rosenbluth: The short answer is, maybe for some investors who want to have a product that has a long enough track record that has a trading history that is approved perhaps on certain platforms and available because it launched in 2021, then buy some of the other products that are futures-based can make sense. But we do think spot-based bitcoin ETFs are going to take market share over the next year or two from a futures-based product.\n\nThey\u2019re just a cleaner way of getting exposure for many people to track the price of bitcoin to own an ETF that tracks the price of bitcoin.\n\nChuck Jaffe: We\u2019re not done seeing creation, but is this the bulk of what we\u2019re going to see? I mean, I would imagine anybody else who comes out now is so late to the party that there\u2019s not going to be much innovation. There\u2019s not going to be much of anything that you can do. So is this that we\u2019ve seen are the bitcoin ETFs and the next one will be ethereum or what have you? It won\u2019t be more expansion of bitcoin products?\n\nTodd Rosenbluth: Oh no, Chuck. The ETF industry is known for innovation, so as we\u2019re recording this, the next day, we will expect there will be an ETF that is trading that is a covered call that\u2019s using a version of bitcoin. So it\u2019s using options to generate income, using bitcoin as the underlying asset. We expect we\u2019re going to see a couple more of those products.\n\nWe\u2019re likely to see products that include bitcoin exposure and broader equities. Bitcoin fits into a portfolio in many different ways. We think we\u2019re going to see ETFs that make it easier for investors to be able to do that. This is the beginning of the evolution of bitcoin exposure using ETFs. This isn\u2019t the end.\n\nChuck Jaffe: Well, we will be watching it with you. We\u2019re glad that we get you on ETF of the Week at times. And of course, it\u2019s always great to chat with you because, like me, you\u2019re a University of Michigan grad.

The peak came on Thursday when the products reached the US financial markets, and Bitcoin skyrocketed to a 21-month high of $49,000.\n\nHours later, though, all gains were erased, and a further dump to $41,500 came on Friday evening. As Saturday arrived, the cryptocurrency recovered a portion of its losses and stood at around $43,000. Since then, there have been very few actual price movements.\n\nIn fact, BTC has remained at around and below that level for the past week.

        "content": "Arthur Hayes says he\u2019s purchased a Bitcoin (BTC) put option with a $35,000 strike price that expires on March 29.\n\nThe BitMEX founder says on the social media platform X that the flagship crypto is looking \u201cheavy\u201d and will likely drop below the $40,000 mark as markets brace for the U.S. Treasury\u2019s announcement at the end of the month detailing Treasury auctions and the new debt that will be issued.\n\n\u201cBTC looks mad heavy. I think we break $40,000. I went long some 29 Mar $35,000 strike puts. I think we dump into the 31 January US Treasury quarterly refunding announcement. Is Janet Yellen or Talkin\u2019?\u201d\n\nHayes says that BTC has become uncorrelated from the S&P 500 (SPX) to the downside, suggesting that the event at the end of this month may end up being bearish for Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cWhy has SPX and BTC stopped moving up together post US BTC ETF launch?\n\nBoth love more $ [liquidity]. Which one is right about the future?\n\nBTC is telling us that there are hiccups ahead for $ liq, next signpost is 31st January US Treasury refunding announcement.\u201d\n\nHayes has also previously stated that the end of the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) on March 12th would likely cause a sharp correction in Bitcoin and other risk assets. However, he also says such a market correction could force the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy and consequently help Bitcoin recover its losses.\n\n\u201cThe BTFP expires on March 12th, and the Fed rate decision is announced on March 20th. There are six trading days between these two crucial decision points. If my forecast is correct, the market will bankrupt a few banks within that period, forcing the Fed into cutting rates and announcing the resumption of the BTFP.\n\nBitcoin initially will decline sharply with the broader financial markets but will rebound before the Fed meeting. That is because Bitcoin is the only neutral reserve hard currency that is not a liability of the banking system and is traded globally.\n\nBitcoin knows that the Fed ALWAYS responds with a liquidity injection when things get bad. It might be called something new to confuse those who get their news from TikTok, but rest assured Bitcoin knows printed money in whatever guise is always printed money. Therefore, Bitcoin will rise sharply before and into the Fed\u2019s eventual capitulation to restarting money printer go brrr.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Crypto vs. stocks: What's the better choice for you? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency has taken the world by storm, especially during the last few years. After having peaked around $3 trillion in 2021, the total value of all these digital currencies sits at about $1.7 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap.com. Of these, Bitcoin is the most popular, worth more than $800 billion itself. Investors have swarmed to this digital gold rush, often with little knowledge and a lot of hope.\n\nCryptocurrency\u2019s rapid appreciation has many investors questioning the place of stocks in their portfolios. But there are numerous differences between stocks and cryptocurrencies. The most important is that a stock is an ownership interest in a business (backed by the company\u2019s assets and cash flow), whereas cryptocurrency, in most cases, is not backed by anything at all.\n\nIf you\u2019re buying cryptocurrencies, it\u2019s important to understand what you\u2019re purchasing and how they compare to traditional investments such as stocks, which have a solid long-term track record.\n\nShould you invest in cryptocurrency or stocks?\n\nAny savvy investor needs to know exactly what they\u2019re investing in. It\u2019s crucial to weigh the risks and rewards of investing, and what will drive the investment\u2019s success. If they don\u2019t have this kind of information, they can\u2019t make the calculation. In this case, it\u2019s more like gambling than investing.\n\nHere are the key things investors need to know about stocks and cryptocurrency.\n\nStocks\n\nA stock is a fractional ownership interest in a business. It\u2019s easy to lose sight of this, if you become overwhelmed by the wiggling stock prices \u2014 and the potential for profit. As a legal ownership stake in the business, the stock gives shareholders a claim on the assets and cash flow of the business. These back your investment and provide a basis for its valuation.\n\nWhy stocks rise and fall: A stock price moves as investors assess the future success of the company. While investors may become overly optimistic about the stock in the short term, the stock price ultimately depends on the company\u2019s ability to grow its profits over the long term. That is, a stock rises in the long term due to the success of the underlying company.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor a stock to be a successful investment, the underlying company must perform well over time. (Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide for how to invest in stocks.)\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nGenerally, cryptocurrency is backed by no hard assets (specialized stablecoins being an exception), and that\u2019s the case for the most popular crypto coins such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. A cryptocurrency may allow you to perform certain functions, such as sending money to another person or using smart contracts that automatically execute after specific conditions are met.\n\nWhy cryptocurrencies rise and fall: Because cryptocurrency is not backed by assets or cash flow, the only thing moving crypto prices is speculation driven by sentiment. As sentiment changes, prices shift \u2014 sometimes drastically. So cryptocurrency is driven only by the hope that someone will buy it for more in the future \u2014 what\u2019s called the \u201cgreater fool theory of investing.\u201d\n\nFor a cryptocurrency to be a successful investment, you must get someone to buy it from you for more than you paid for it. That is, the market must be more optimistic about it than you are. (Check out this beginner\u2019s guide to investing in cryptocurrency.)\n\nPros and cons of investing in cryptocurrency vs. stocks\n\nPros of investing in cryptocurrency\n\nPossible hedge against fiat currency: For some investors, one of the biggest appeals of cryptocurrency is its decentralized nature. It\u2019s not controlled by central banks or governments who like to print money and generate inflation in fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar or the euro. Cryptocurrency has been called \u201cdigital gold\u201d by some investors who hold it because they think it will protect them from inflation.\n\nPotential for outsized gains: Buying cryptocurrencies creates the potential for large gains on your investment. Several cryptocurrencies have seen their prices skyrocket since first being introduced. These gains are the main reason people are attracted to cryptocurrencies, but the potential for price appreciation comes with significant risk.\n\nGrowing number of coins: In the early days of cryptocurrencies, there were just a few coins that could be invested in, but the speculative interest has changed that. New coins are introduced regularly and there are now thousands to choose from.\n\nWide interest in digital currencies: There seems to be a growing interest in cryptocurrencies from investors, companies and governments. Tesla holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet and briefly accepted the digital currency as payment before reversing course. El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, though the International Monetary Fund has urged the country to reverse its decision. Increasing acceptance of digital currencies could be positive for investors.\n\nCons of investing in cryptocurrency\n\nExtreme volatility: Cryptocurrencies have been extremely volatile so far in their relatively young existence. They aren\u2019t backed by anything, so the price they trade at is determined by the whims of traders. Fortunes can be made and lost quickly and there\u2019s no telling where a coin might trade next.\n\nCybersecurity risks: Despite cryptocurrency enthusiasts touting the security benefits of digital coins, there have been notable hacks involving cryptocurrencies. It is often difficult to recover stolen funds.\n\nNo intrinsic value: Cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value, which means they aren\u2019t backed by underlying assets or earnings the way that stocks are. Stocks have value because of their future earnings power and what they will return for their owners, while cryptocurrencies offer nothing of the sort.\n\nRegulatory risks: While El Salvador has embraced Bitcoin, many governments are much more skeptical about cryptocurrencies. China has banned them altogether, other countries could follow and the U.S. is regulating them.\n\nPros of investing in stocks\n\nLong history of solid returns: Stocks have a long track record of producing solid investment returns, with the S&P 500 stock index returning about 10 percent over the long-term. Though stocks can be volatile in the short term, they have generally been safe to hold over long periods of time.\n\nHave intrinsic value: A stock represents an ownership interest in a company and its value over time depends on the success of the underlying company. Companies own assets that produce earnings and cash flow for investors, creating what\u2019s known as intrinsic value.\n\nAccessible: It is easier than ever to invest in stocks these days with many online brokers cutting trading fees to zero. You can invest in individual stocks or choose to purchase a diversified basket of stocks through an index fund. Index funds help keep costs low and you can build a diversified portfolio even if you don\u2019t have much money to start with.\n\nStronger regulation: Stock exchanges, brokers and companies are all heavily regulated through various government agencies. Companies are required to provide certain information to investors through the Securities and Exchange Commission. No regulatory body is perfect, but stocks have been around for a long time and there are certain important investor protections in place.\n\nCons of investing in stocks\n\nVolatile: When you hold a broad basket of stocks through index funds, stocks are less volatile than cryptocurrencies. Individual stocks can be more volatile, but typically less so than cryptocurrencies. Because of this volatility, stocks are best held as part of a long-term investment plan, so you have time to recover from any short-term losses.\n\nLower potential for extreme gains: Broad stock indexes such as the S&P 500 likely have less potential for the extreme gains that can sometimes be found among cryptocurrencies. Stocks have returned about 10 percent per year over the long term, whereas it\u2019s not uncommon for cryptocurrencies to move 10 percent in a single day.\n\nOther considerations when investing in stocks vs. crypto\n\nTime horizon\n\nYour time horizon \u2014 when you need the money from an investment \u2014 is a key criterion. The shorter your timeline, the safer your asset should be, so that it\u2019s there when you need it. The more volatile an asset, the less suited it is for those with a short timeline. Generally, experts suggest investors in risky assets such as stocks need at least three years to ride out volatility.\n\nStocks\n\nStocks are often volatile, but they tend to be less volatile than crypto. Individual stocks are more volatile than a portfolio of stocks, which tends to benefit from diversification.\n\nStocks are better suited to investors who can leave their money alone and don\u2019t need to access it. Generally, the longer you can leave it invested, the better.\n\nSome stocks can be more volatile than others. For example, growth stocks tend to fluctuate much more than value stocks or dividend stocks.\n\nInvestors may shift from more aggressive stocks (growth stocks) to safer ones (dividend stocks) as they need to tap their money, such as when they approach retirement.\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nWhile stocks are volatile, cryptocurrency is ridiculously volatile. For example, during 2021, Bitcoin lost more than half its value in a few months and later gained 100 percent. Such volatility makes crypto unsuited for short-term investors.\n\nCrypto is better suited to traders who can leave their money tied up and wait for it to recover. Think years rather than weeks.\n\nPortfolio management\n\nAs you\u2019re thinking about constructing your portfolio, you don\u2019t have to make an either-or choice between cryptocurrency and stocks \u2014 or other kinds of asset such as bonds or funds, either. It\u2019s all about weighting your portfolio in a way that fits your risk and time horizon.\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nGiven its inherent risks, cryptocurrency works better with a small allocation in your overall portfolio. Think 5 percent or less.\n\nEven a small allocation could do wonders for your portfolio if cryptocurrency really takes off. Also, limiting to a small allocation protects you against a complete loss if crypto goes to zero.\n\nIf crypto grows to be a significant portion of your portfolio, you can re-allocate more of your money to stocks to lower your portfolio\u2019s overall risk.\n\nStocks\n\nGiven stocks\u2019 strong long-term record, a diversified collection of stocks should make up the majority of your portfolio, especially if you have decades until you need to tap it.\n\nIf you\u2019re investing in individual stocks, you\u2019ll need to research your stocks carefully to achieve good returns.\n\nIf you\u2019re investing in funds, you can buy a broadly diversified fund such as an S&P 500 index fund without significant research and enjoy the potential for high returns.\n\nWhich is safer, stocks or crypto?\n\nWhen it comes to safety, both stocks and cryptocurrencies present their unique set of risks. Stocks, backed by a company\u2019s assets and cash flow, have a long history of delivering solid returns. They are regulated by government bodies and have investor protections in place. However, market volatility, business decisions, and international events can impact stock investments.\n\nOn the other hand, cryptocurrencies, while offering the potential for substantial gains, are highly volatile and lack the backing of tangible assets. They also pose risks such as cybersecurity threats and regulatory uncertainties. Therefore, the safety of these investments largely depends on your personal risk tolerance and financial goals.\n\nA broadly diversified stock portfolio generally presents a safer option than cryptocurrencies because of their intrinsic value and history of delivering solid long-term returns. Cryptocurrencies may hold greater potential for outsized gains, but come with significant risk.\n\nBottom line\n\nSome cryptocurrencies have soared in price since being introduced over the past few years, but investors need to understand what they\u2019re investing in, instead of just rushing in because other traders are, a symptom of FOMO syndrome (fear of missing out). If you decide to take a stake in crypto, consider how it fits with your own risk tolerance and financial needs. Investors can earn good returns without investing in cryptocurrency, and some investors, including legends such as Warren Buffett, won\u2019t touch cryptocurrency.\n\nEditorial Disclaimer: All investors are advised to conduct their own independent research into investment strategies before making an investment decision. In addition, investors are advised that past investment product performance is no guarantee of future price appreciation.\n\n\u2013 Bankrate\u2019s Brian Baker, CFA contributed to an update to this article."

        "content": "Following the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the crypto market has experienced a surprising downturn after FTX unloaded a staggering $1 billion worth of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's (GBTC) shares.\n\nThis unprecedented sell-off, attributed to the bankruptcy of the crypto exchange, has raised a concern about the broader implications for the crypto sector.

Holding 22.3 million GBTC valued at $597 million in October 2023, FTX's move to liquidate its stake at $900 million coincided with the launch of Grayscale's Bitcoin ETF on January 11. The aftermath saw a drop in Bitcoin's value, prompting a reevaluation of the impact of the approval of the ETFs.\n\nKeep Reading TradingView Enhances DeFi Tools on Polygon via QuickSwap Partnership\n\nLast year, Alameda Research sued Grayscale to recover $250 million for FTX's customers and creditors.

        "content": "Quick Take\n\nAs Bitcoin\u2019s value teeters slightly over $40,000, the market undergoes significant sell pressure, partly attributable to GBTC outflows and an intriguing profit-taking trend. This trend, which CryptoSlate closely monitors, reveals long-term holders and short-term holders engaging in profit-taking at levels not witnessed in years.\n\nFrom Oct. 20, 2023, onwards, daily profit-taking has become a mainstay, mirroring the pattern seen during the bullish run from Sept. 2020 to Jan. 2021. As Bitcoin\u2019s price escalated, profit-taking followed suit with minimal realized losses.\n\nThe phenomenon continues to escalate. Yesterday, Jan. 18, the market saw a staggering $900 million worth of profit-taking, indicating investors\u2019 tendency to cash in on their earnings. This comes in the wake of Bitcoin\u2019s impressive price climb from $25,000 to $49,000 in Jan. 2024, outlinging the pivotal role of profit-taking in shaping Bitcoin\u2019s price trends."
