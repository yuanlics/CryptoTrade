        "title": "Bitcoin is terrible for the environment \u2013 can it ever go green? - The Guardian",
        "content": "On the corner of New York\u2019s Park Avenue and 52nd Street, curious onlookers recently stopped in front of a giant green skull sitting in the bed of a truck parked outside the office of Fidelity Investments, the global financial management company.\n\nThe \u201cSkull of Satoshi\u201d, named after the pseudonymous bitcoin developer Satoshi Nakamoto, is composed almost entirely of computer circuit boards and fitted with tall smokestacks usually found atop coal power plants.\n\nThe artifact is a project of artist Benjamin Von Wong and is a reference to the massive amounts of carbon emitted from mining the cryptocurrency bitcoin, an endeavor Fidelity is now pursuing.\n\nBitcoin is chiefly known as a wild investment vehicle that \u2013 along with many other cryptocurrencies \u2013 can seemingly make or lose fortunes overnight in a market where values go up and down quickly and by large margins.\n\nBut what worries environmentalists and others is the huge amount of electricity used in generating bitcoin and other such currencies \u2013 energy that often traces back to fossil fuels and so has a corresponding impact on the climate crisis.\n\nAs major financial brands speculate in the cryptocurrency world, environmental campaigners want to make sure they know that they are not just taking a financial gamble; there is also an environmental risk.\n\nSome are hoping that they can persuade those institutions to try to lessen the impact of crypto-mining. \u201cIt\u2019s a big step for a financial institution like Fidelity to launch their own crypto platform. So now more than ever, we need their help,\u201d said Rolf Skar, campaign director at Greenpeace USA, a non-profit environmental advocacy organization.\n\nIt is a complex situation. But here is a guide to the key issues.\n\nWhat is bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency, a decentralized form of currency that is strictly digital rather than physical \u2013 unlike dollars, pounds or euros. It is managed and traded on a public, open ledger known as a \u201cblockchain\u201d that records all bitcoin transactions. Though not commonly done, bitcoin can be used to buy material goods.\n\nHow does bitcoin cause environmental damage?\n\nBecause cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are not centralized, there is no singular authority or body to verify transactions. Instead, participants in the bitcoin network \u201cmine\u201d, or compete to solve cryptographic puzzles to generate more of the currency. Whoever solves the puzzle the fastest gets to verify transactions for the chance to add the newest batch of them to the blockchain.\n\nThe winner is financially rewarded with new cryptocurrency in this process, referred to as \u201cproof of work\u201d (PoW) \u2013 the culprit for greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe PoW consensus algorithm used to verify transactions requires large amounts of electricity which is often produced by burning fossil fuels, emitting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are heating the planet.\n\nA 2022 report, titled Revisiting Bitcoin\u2019s Carbon Footprint, conducted by climate and economics researchers across Europe estimates that \u201cBitcoin mining may be responsible for 65.4 megatonnes of CO 2 per year \u2026 which is comparable to country-level emissions in Greece (56.6 megatonnes in 2019).\u201d\n\nWhat do environmental groups want?\n\nThere is a recent push by some environmentalists to reduce the environmental impact of bitcoin by changing the way it is produced.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Greenidge Generation bitcoin mining facility, in a former coal plant by Seneca Lake in Dresden, New York. Photograph: Ted Shaffrey/AP\n\nSo groups such as Greenpeace are calling out Fidelity and other financial management and payment process companies that have ventured into bitcoin mining. Hence the recent targeting of Fidelity. Skar said that although Fidelity responded to Greenpeace when the group reached out, the response was lackluster.\n\n\u201c[Fidelity] seem not to want to talk about the issue. They declined [our request to speak] so far, but it\u2019s an invitation for them and others to step up and put resources towards solutions to deal with the problem of bitcoin mining globally. We think it can be done,\u201d Skar said.\n\nHow could \u2018changing the code\u2019 mitigate environmental damage?\n\nThe solution, Greenpeace argues, is simple: change the computer code that produces bitcoin in order to consume less electricity and reduce its carbon footprint.\n\nThis code is open-source, meaning it is publicly accessible to anyone who wants to see or use it.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to TechScape Free weekly newsletter Alex Hern's weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fidelity is the focus because they have been one of the biggest traditional financial players involved in the bitcoin space and they refuse to acknowledge that they have a responsibility and the ability to help fix the problem that bitcoin mining is having on the climate. So this is actually an invitation for them,\u201d Skar said.\n\nHe called the code change \u201ca win for bitcoin and for climate and for communities\u201d.\n\nBut would it succeed?\n\nProminent voices in the bitcoin community and some scholars on the topic don\u2019t buy into this solution.\n\nDr Hanna Halaburda is an associate professor of technology, operations and statistics at NYU\u2019s Stern School of Business. Among the classes she teaches are Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies and Foundations of Fintech.\n\nIn reference to a hypothetical bitcoin protocol change, Halaburda said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work. Everybody recognizes [bitcoin] is environmentally unhealthy, but any big changes to bitcoin protocol have been very unsuccessful because you need to get all the miners to agree on that.\u201d\n\nAny miners that don\u2019t agree with the protocol change can simply reject the new code and continue running the original code that relies on the energy-intensive PoW.\n\nWould other tactics work?\n\nHalaburda said there might be another solution: renewable energy.\n\n\u201cA lot of [bitcoin] mining companies have set up their contracts with renewable energy companies. The argument is that having these mining facilities as clients means that when there\u2019s an oversupply of energy, it may actually make it more profitable for the renewable energy plants,\u201d she said.\n\nThis means that these energy companies can mine bitcoin during periods of excess production and oversupply. So instead of letting energy go to waste, money can be made and the wealth can be shared between the cryptocurrency mining facilities and the renewable energy companies with which they have a contract.\n\nFidelity did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment."

        "title": "How Ordinals Make Bitcoin Both Fungible and Non-Fungible (Correct) - Bloomberg Law",
        "content": "Bitcoin is generally understood to be a fungible virtual currency\u2014each unit of bitcoin is exactly the same as any other unit of bitcoin and can be exchanged or transacted over the Bitcoin protocol on a like-kind basis.\n\nIn contrast, non-fungible tokens refer to a subset of digital assets that represent ownership of unique pieces of intangible digital content such as digital art, avatars, or even music. NFTs are typically minted or issued independently of a fungible base-layer digital asset such as Bitcoin or Ether. The underlying blockchain network recognizes each NFT as different from one another. In other words, one NFT cannot be exchanged for another NFT on a like-kind basis.\n\nHowever, the fungible and non-fungible worlds of digital assets have collided with the recent emergence of Bitcoin Ordinals\u2014also known as Ordinal Inscriptions. Bitcoin Ordinals, enabled by a 2021 upgrade to the Bitcoin protocol named Taproot, allow Bitcoin holders to \u201cinscribe\u201d permanently the smallest unit of Bitcoin, or satoshis, with unique digital content of up to 4 megabytes.\n\nDespite continued regulatory uncertainty surrounding digital assets, Bitcoin Ordinals have generated significant interest in recent months, contributing to a surge in Bitcoin transaction fees in early 2023. According to recent media reports, more than 500,000 Bitcoin Ordinals have been \u201cminted\u201d or issued on the Bitcoin blockchain to date. The rising popularity of Bitcoin Ordinals even reportedly sparked developers of other virtual currencies to incorporate similar features on their respective blockchain protocols.\n\nSimultaneously Fungible and Non-Fungible\n\nUnlike traditional NFTs, Bitcoin Ordinals give Bitcoin both fungible and non-fungible properties.\n\nFor instance, unlike an NFT issued on the Ethereum blockchain, the Bitcoin protocol does not recognize a satoshi inscribed with unique content as being different from any other satoshi. A holder of a Bitcoin Ordinal therefore is free to exchange their satoshi for another, and may even spend the inscribed satoshi to pay for transaction fees on the Bitcoin network. In this way, Bitcoin Ordinals preserve the fungible nature of Bitcoin and behave as any freely exchangeable virtual currency would.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin Ordinals can also behave much like NFTs as digital collectibles, as they may be bought or sold for their unique inscribed content\u2014which has included in one instance a fully functional video game. This attribute gives the Bitcoin Ordinals value independent of the Bitcoin virtual currency. Several third-party NFT marketplaces have reportedly launched platforms to facilitate the trading of Bitcoin Ordinals.\n\nBecause digital content inscribed on a satoshi is permanent, Bitcoin Ordinals may be used as a virtual currency in one transaction and as an NFT in another, forever fluctuating between the two use cases. Whether a Bitcoin Ordinal makes the underlying satoshi fungible or non-fungible therefore depends on how the holder decides to use it.\n\nRegulatory Implications Are Unclear\n\nThe duality of a digital asset that is simultaneously fungible and non-fungible potentially raises challenging regulatory questions surrounding the characterization of the digital asset under the federal securities laws. No US regulator has to date formally addressed the ability of a historically fungible digital asset to morph into an NFT and vice versa.\n\nFor example, it is unclear whether a unit of a digital asset that was once issued as a security ceases to be a security if the same unit of the digital asset is later sold in a non-fungible capacity as a digital collectible. Such a scenario may be akin to a decades-old rare coin being sold at an auction as a valuable piece of memorabilia, where the utility and the market value of the rare coin is completely divorced from its face value.\n\nConversely, it is also unclear how regulators might characterize the morphing digital asset if it is subsequently redeemed as a fungible token in the secondary market. To continue the rare coin analogy, this would be akin to the rare coin being put back into general circulation for its originally intended use, namely for purchase of goods and services.\n\nWhile the regulatory treatment of an instrument may change over time depending on the relevant facts and circumstances, it is unclear how such an approach would practically apply to a digital asset that continuously morphs between a fungible token, and one that is as unique as a piece artwork such as the Mona Lisa.\n\nIt may be too early to tell whether this latest trend in the world of digital assets will stick for good. However, innovations in the digital asset space continue apace, often pushing the boundaries of existing regulatory frameworks and challenging regulators to devise creative solutions to adapt.\n\nThe article has been corrected to reflect that Bitcoin transaction fees surged in early 2023.\n\nThis article does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg Industry Group, Inc., the publisher of Bloomberg Law and Bloomberg Tax, or its owners.\n\nAuthor Information\n\nDaniel Davis is partner and co-chair in Katten\u2019s financial markets and regulation practice.\n\nAlexander Kim is an associate in Katten\u2019s financial markets and regulation practice.\n\nWrite for Us: Author Guidelines"

        "content": "Bitcoin has been one of the hottest topics of conversation in the world of investing over recent years with many desperate to understand what it is all about and whether you can make money from Bitcoin . However, it\u2019s not just about investing in the cryptocurrency - there\u2019s also the option of mining Bitcoin.\n\nMoney.com recently published a helpful article on whether mining Bitcoin is profitable and, here, we summarize it for you. Before we get into it, please note that investing in Bitcoin and mining Bitcoin both come with big risks, so only try your hand if you\u2019re sure of what you are doing and you are comfortable with the risks. For more help, you can also listen to me and other prominent journalists describe the pros and cons of Bitcoin mining in last week\u2019s episode of The Week Unwrapped podcast .\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nIt\u2019s worth first establishing what Bitcoin actually is, given it is a highly complex type of currency. I have been in the world of personal finance journalism for almost 20 years and I must say it\u2019s the most complex issue I have written or spoken about.\n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance Be a smarter, better informed investor.

According to the Economist, \u201ca blockchain is a database made up of a string of blocks of information that build on top of one another in an immutable chain. It stores data on transactions, providing proof of who owns what at any time.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is a decentralized currency, meaning it is not under the control of any state or central bank.\n\nAs you may know, the value of Bitcoin can be very volatile. While one coin is worth about $30,000 at time of writing, in the past three years or so it\u2019s swung between $5,000 and $65,000. In addition, there have been some safety concerns, as crypto hackers have stolen billions of dollars in the past. Meanwhile, recent bankruptcies in the industry have also raised questions for investors.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin mining?\n\nIn its simplest terms, Bitcoin mining is when you create new Bitcoins, though how you get there is fairly complex.\n\nAccording to Bankrate , \u201cBitcoin mining is the process of creating new Bitcoins by solving extremely complicated math problems that verify transactions in the currency. When a Bitcoin is successfully mined, the miner receives a predetermined amount of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nMoney.com goes into even more detail: \u201cMiners are competing to guess a complex 64-digit number known as a hash. To guess the hash, miners use powerful computers to generate guesses quickly. Think of it this way: each digit in the hash has 16 possibilities (the digits 1 through 10 plus letters A through F). So, to generate a guess, you could roll a 16-sided die 64 times. That would give you one guess \u2014 the problem is, there are trillions of possible answers.\n\n\u201cUsing tons of processing power and a whole lot of energy, miners\u2019 computers basically roll that die at super speeds. The miner who arrives at the correct hash first and adds a bitcoin block to the blockchain receives the reward.\u201d\n\nHow do you actually set up a Bitcoin mine?\n\nThe first thing to note is that it is legal in the U.S., even though some other countries have placed restrictions on Bitcoin mining.\n\nTo mine Bitcoin, you need giant computers capable of processing the huge amount of data required, and that can cost you thousands of dollars to set up. The enormous amount of hardware required has led some people to join mining pools to share computing power, though it also means they share any gains.\n\nA friend of mine has taken up Bitcoin mining, and when I went to his house a few weeks ago, I saw about four giant computers, each about the size of an old-fashioned hi-fi system. They gave off a tremendous amount of heat - so much so that he installed solar panels to cover the electricity cost of mining, though it means he hardly had to turn on the heating in winter, he said.\n\nImportantly, the huge energy consumption required is one reason Bitcoin mining is controversial, because of the environmental impact.\n\nHow much money can you make from Bitcoin mining?\n\nThis is where we return to the article run by Money.com to summarize its advice.\n\nIt points out that every time a miner adds a new block of transactions to the blockchain, they earn 6.25 Bitcoin, but this will drop to 3.125 next year. It is paid into a crypto wallet.\n\nThat equates to a lot of money given the value of Bitcoin at time of writing was about $30,000 per coin. That may sound like easy money, but remember: you are competing against other miners.\n\nLet\u2019s also remember that Bitcoin is an incredibly volatile currency, so who knows what the value will be tomorrow, let alone the distant future. There have been some days where Bitcoin investors have woken up to giant falls and rises in its value.\n\nIs it profitable, then? Here is how Money.com summarizes that answer: \u201cThe bottom line is that there is no set amount bitcoin miners earn. Mining requires significant investment, and the results are unpredictable.\u201d\n\nAs you can see, it takes a lot of investment to set up, you are using a lot of energy to mine and the returns are unknown. Of course, some make huge sums from Bitcoin mining, but before you take the plunge, consider the risks, the environmental impact and the effort involved."

        "title": "Bitcoin is still the future of payments, says Lightspark CEO David Marcus - The Verge",
        "content": "We\u2019ve got a special episode with Alex Heath, deputy editor at The Verge and a familiar host for Decoder listeners, and David Marcus, the CEO of Lightspark. That\u2019s a company that just launched a service to make fast transactions using Bitcoin on something called the Lightning Network. David was previously at PayPal, and then he led Meta\u2019s big payments effort that went nowhere, but he\u2019s got a lot to say about where crypto and payments are right now.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nNilay Patel: Alex, welcome.\n\nAlex Heath: Hey.\n\nNP: It\u2019s good to have you back. Why did Lightspark catch your eye? What did you find interesting about this little startup?\n\nAH: Yeah, I don\u2019t cover crypto all the time, but I do pay attention to what David Marcus is doing. He is a Bitcoin OG and has been in the space for a long time. And he had quite a journey trying to launch Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency.\n\nNP: David was the president of PayPal, and then we should talk about what happened at Facebook just for a second. Facebook wanted to launch a new cryptocurrency called Libra, was going to do it with governments around the world and different payment services, and it collapsed under the weight of its political ambitions. And now, David is back with a much leaner, simpler startup. Did you talk about the difference between those two ideas?\n\nAH: We did. Libra, for people who don\u2019t remember, it feels like a blur now, this was in 2019, Facebook was going to do this stablecoin that was David Marcus\u2019 brainchild, really, and he led it inside the company. And it met a lot of resistance for several reasons, but mainly, I think when you talk to people who worked on it, it was because Facebook was doing it, but there were also concerns just about a private company of that size creating a currency, and it was based on a basket of fiat currencies rather than just one pure cryptocurrency.\n\nThis gets kind of in the weeds, but I think the distinction is important because David has essentially decided that, for his next company \u2014 and interestingly, he took a lot of the founding team that made Libra with him at Facebook to Lightspark with him \u2014 that it\u2019s going to be simpler for him to just build on top of Bitcoin. He chose that instead of all the other cryptocurrencies, layer one networks out there, ethereum, etc.\n\nAnd I think David, out of pretty much anyone in the industry, knows the most about the regulatory environment around crypto because, when he was doing Libra, he testified in front of Congress. I remember there was a photo of [Mark] Zuckerberg\u2019s face on the dollar bill, with Zuck Bucks displayed behind him at one point. He had to meet regulators all around the world. They tried incorporating Libra in several different countries, including Switzerland. This is a guy who knows the global regulatory situation around crypto better than anyone. So the fact that he decided to make a company that he told me he hopes to be his life\u2019s work around Bitcoin, specifically, I thought was interesting.\n\nNP: Yeah, that\u2019s actually a really interesting part to me. We lived through what I would call crypto summer last year, where the hype was off the charts. There was a lot of conversation about ethereum, these other coins. I think that has all fallen by the wayside. It\u2019s interesting to me that, out of all that wreckage, Dave Marcus is back, and he\u2019s saying Bitcoin is it, and it\u2019s still viable, and he\u2019s managed to raise a bunch of money with that pitch.\n\nAH: Yeah, he\u2019s raised a lot of money and the company\u2019s pretty lean, but I think his goal is to scale Bitcoin as a payments network. He\u2019s a payments guy through and through. That\u2019s what he was doing at PayPal. He led the acquisition of Braintree and Venmo when he was there \u2014 and what he was trying to do at Facebook when he was working on Messenger before Libra even had to do with payments. So this has really been his life\u2019s work, and he sees the opportunity thanks to this thing called a layer two network, which is this network that sits on top of Bitcoin, called Lightning, to let people actually transact using Bitcoin.\n\nAnd the most interesting part of all this is that he thinks people don\u2019t even need to know that Bitcoin is the network they\u2019re using to transact with because Lightning is that fast, and he actually sees companies using it to settle back into fiat on both sides of the transaction, so legal tender in real time. And I think that\u2019s really interesting because he\u2019s basically saying, with this network, we can obfuscate crypto out of the equation for the end consumer, and they don\u2019t even need to know that they\u2019re using it necessarily.\n\nNP: That\u2019s fascinating. Did you ask him the only question I ever want to ask anybody about Bitcoin, which is, if I have a Bitcoin, why would I ever spend it?\n\nAH: Well, that gets to the whole reason he\u2019s doing the company, which is he agrees that Bitcoin is, in its current state, a bad thing to transact with. It fluctuates. The idea with Lightning and the company he\u2019s building, which is basically Bitcoin payments in a box for companies, is that it\u2019s happening so fast, and it\u2019s using microtransactions, so micro fractions of Bitcoins, called Satoshis, with this Lightning network, of course, that you don\u2019t even know that Bitcoin is being transacted, and it happens so fast that the price fluctuations don\u2019t matter.\n\nHe\u2019s a really smart guy. He thinks very thoughtfully about this stuff. He\u2019s a long-term thinker. He doesn\u2019t really buy into the hype waves of the different crypto summers we\u2019ve had. He\u2019s been through many crypto winters. He thinks this one, interestingly, will be a very long and painful one, but he\u2019s choosing to start a company in the space anyway, really in the middle of it. And he thinks he has the best bet at doing something in a space that\u2019s not going to get gunned down by regulators like Libra was. And also just hearing him reflect on going from a big company, Facebook, trying to lead a project, basically a startup within that company, which is what Libra was, to actually just running his own startup now and what he enjoys about that and what the tradeoffs are, I thought was really interesting.\n\nNP: That\u2019s pure Decoder bait. All right. I\u2019m excited for this one. It\u2019s a good conversation. To the moon, Alex Heath with Lightspark CEO David Marcus. Here we go.\n\nDavid Marcus, you\u2019re the CEO and co-founder of Lightspark. Welcome to Decoder.\n\nThank you for having me.\n\nI first wanted to just table set and talk about the crypto industry more broadly. I think it\u2019s safe to say we\u2019re in a crypto winter, thanks in large part to the collapse of FTX. You\u2019ve got rising interest rates \u2014 a lot of factors in there. I was reading your end-of-2022 predictions post, and you predicted that we won\u2019t exit this crypto winter this year and probably not in 2024, either. And you wrote that \u201cA lot of value, trust and stability was destroyed in 2022.\u201d You\u2019ve been doing this for a really long time, and you\u2019ve lived through multiple crypto winters. I\u2019m not sure how many. Do you know how many?\n\nAt least three, if not four.\n\nWhat\u2019s different about this one in your mind versus the others?\n\nI think that this one is different because the industry got a lot bigger. So the downturn affected many more people, touched more consumers, more companies, more investors. There was a ton more capital deployed in this cycle versus the previous cycles. So it\u2019s just bigger.\n\nAnd when you think about the opportunity still for crypto, what is it? Especially when you have this much disillusionment, so many retail investors were touched by the collapse of FTX. What is the long-term potential for the market?\n\nWell, look, I think that everything that\u2019s speculative ends up in booms and busts cycles. It\u2019s only if you build something valuable that solves real-world problems that you can actually create long-standing value. And so I think we\u2019re starting on that journey now. There are a bunch of companies that built things that solve real-world problems, exchanges, wallets, and many more. But there was so much speculation and teams that were just building something just for the sake of listing a token and making a quick buck. And I feel like this era is coming to an end if it hasn\u2019t ended already. And now teams are actually focusing on building valuable things.\n\nYou left Facebook in December of 2021, which we can get more into later. When did you decide that your new company was going to be Bitcoin focused? Because what you were doing at Facebook was a stablecoin. Why Bitcoin?\n\nListen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge\u2019s Nilay Patel about big ideas \u2014 and other problems. Subscribe here!\n\nSo I had this idea in the back of my mind, but I wasn\u2019t sure yet that I was going to just take the plunge and go with it. Many friends told me, \u201cYou should take at least nine months off.\u201d And after month three, I was really going crazy, so it was time for me to get back on the horse. But why Bitcoin? Because I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that if you want a true open, interoperable protocol for money on the internet, which is what we\u2019re trying to help build here, it has to be built on something that literally no one controls.\n\nBitcoin is the only network and asset that fits the bill when you think about it that way. There\u2019s no consortium of companies. There\u2019s no people at the helm. There\u2019s no leader. There\u2019s Satoshi Nakamoto, but who knows who they or he or she is? And that\u2019s kind of all of the value of the network.\n\nIt\u2019s also the most robust network out there and battle-tested network out there that has been around for over 13 years and has resisted all possible kinds of attacks and issues. So it is, in our mind, the only network that can support a truly open interoperable protocol for money on the internet.\n\nWhat you just said \u2014 open, interoperable protocol \u2014 sounds similar to what you were trying to do with Libra, but I know what you\u2019re doing with Lightspark is different. Why not Bitcoin as the basis for what Libra was? Why go from the synthetic stablecoin approach to Bitcoin?\n\nSo we actually explored Lightning in the early days of Libra, and we spent time looking at it, and we had a lot of back and forth, and Lightning wasn\u2019t mature enough at the time. We\u2019re talking early 2018. And the problem with Bitcoin as a pure play transactional asset, if you don\u2019t have a real-time settlement network to move money in real time is the volatility of Bitcoin itself. And so it makes it a poor medium of exchange. Not everywhere, because you have a number of countries where the volatility of Bitcoin is actually better than the alternative of hyperinflation of their own home currency. At that time, we felt like we needed to try to bring something to the market that had really stable value so that it could become a great medium of exchange. And if we wanted that at the time, we had to go build something proprietary to actually support it because there was no blockchain that would do at-scale, real-time settlement for potentially hundreds of million if not billions of people.\n\nWhat is Lightning for people who are listening and aren\u2019t quite sure? Maybe they\u2019ve heard of it in passing but aren\u2019t sure.\n\nSo Lightning is a Layer 2 payments protocol built on top of Bitcoin, and the concept is basically one of a channel-based payment network. And so you open payment channels between people or entities that want to transact with one another, and you basically move beads, for the lack of a better term, from one side to another. And you can do that in real time because those channels are very fast. And then there\u2019s a network. So let\u2019s say that you and I have a payment channel open and we want to pay someone else and you have a channel open with that third person, but I don\u2019t. I can go through you to actually pay that third person.\n\nSo it\u2019s a pretty unusual setup, but it\u2019s not unfamiliar. Networking on the internet looks fairly similar in the sense that you have routers on the internet that route packets. You don\u2019t have to be connected directly with anyone and everyone. You can move those packets through third parties, et cetera. So a small unit of Bitcoin on top of Lightning for us is a little bit like a TCP/IP packet for money.\n\nAnd Lightning, importantly, like Bitcoin, is not controlled by a centralized entity?\n\nCorrect. It runs on top of Bitcoin, so it\u2019s completely decentralized. It brings a lot of capabilities to Bitcoin when it comes to payments because it\u2019s near real time. So it\u2019s really, really fast. It\u2019s very cheap, and it\u2019s almost infinitely scalable. And it\u2019s also private, which Bitcoin Layer 1 isn\u2019t. It basically has all of the attributes of a great open payment network.\n\nIs there any concern with the fact that the protocol is private in that it\u2019s not totally visible on chain like Bitcoin in terms of the decentralization of it over time?\n\nNo, because you can see the topography of the network. The only thing you can\u2019t see is actually who\u2019s paying whom, which is a feature when it comes to payments.\n\nIf you\u2019re a merchant, you don\u2019t want your competitors to know exactly how much you\u2019re doing in sales any given day or month. If you\u2019re a consumer, you don\u2019t want people to know exactly who you\u2019re transacting with at all times. And so privacy is a feature of all existing payment networks and the same here with Lightning.\n\nSo you are thinking about Lightning even while you\u2019re at Facebook in the early iterations of coming up with Libra. You leave Facebook at the end of 2021, and you have friends telling you you should take some time, you should not just jump right in. You did anyway. You jumped in. What was the impetus to jump in and go, even after everything you went through at Facebook and having to speak in front of Congress, all the scrutiny \u2014 what made you go, \u201cI\u2019m ready to do another company\u201d?\n\nYeah, that\u2019s a good question. I feel like I had a deep sense of unfinished business, and I think all of us, all of my co-founders here, feel exactly the same way because the fact that we\u2019re in 2023 and that money moves the same way it moved in the late \u201960s and \u201970s on top of completely archaic, outdated systems is borderline infuriating to me. It\u2019s just not right. It\u2019s an anomaly in the world. Money should move the same way anything else on the internet moves. You should be able to send money the way you send an email or a text message. We failed trying to do that when we tried the Libra / DM journey at Facebook. And in that time period, everyone else that tried also failed. And so we still felt that massive amount of fire and passion to actually go fix that for the world because we feel it\u2019s just not right.\n\nAnd what I think is also unique about Lightspark and the founding team that you have with you is it\u2019s pretty much everyone who worked on Libra with you, almost, at least at the senior level, it seems. What was it like convincing everyone who just went through this with you?\n\nWell, it\u2019s not everyone, but \u2014\n\nA lot of people.\n\nBut look, I feel like we shared that same passion for seeing this through. And \u201cthis\u201d is actually really trying to help the world with an open, interoperable, dirt-cheap, real-time settlement payment protocol. And so when we started hanging out again, we all felt the same feeling, the same fire to actually go and do this. So it wasn\u2019t actually a complicated path to actually form that co-founding team that we have. And everyone felt like we still needed to try this. And as far as I\u2019m concerned personally, I\u2019ve now absolutely decided, and I have the purest possible version of clarity on this, that this is going to be my life\u2019s thing. I\u2019m just not going to stop until I get it done. This is it.\n\nLet\u2019s get into Lightspark, then. So you recognize Bitcoin and Lightning are what you want to build on. Where is the opportunity to make a company in that space, and what is Lightspark?\n\nThe one downside currently with Lightning is actually that it\u2019s very complicated to fully understand. And the barrier of entry as far as just the learning curve is so incredibly high that it dissuades a lot of people to actually use that network. Additionally, operationally, it\u2019s actually very complex to operationalize Lightning because spinning up a node is complicated, but then you need to open channels with other peers on the network to have a well-connected node. And when you do that, when payments actually get routed through your nodes, you need to rebalance the liquidity that is actually locked up in payment channels. So this concept of payment channels is a little bit foreign for everyone who wants to actually send and receive money across the world 24/7 in real time.\n\nThe first step is really simplifying all of that, really removing all of the complexity and building an enterprise-grade entry point to Lightning so that developers and platforms around the world can actually tap into all the benefits of a real-time global payment network.\n\nSo that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re launching this week. It\u2019s really the easiest, fastest way for anyone to actually onboard the Lightning network and send and receive payments in no time. No operational overhead, no high liquidity requirements, none of that. We\u2019ve taken something that\u2019s fairly complex but great when you know how to use it into something that\u2019s actually really simple, reliable, and enterprise-grade. And the business model for us is actually quite simple, which is we\u2019re providing all these services, and we\u2019re taking a small cut of the transactions that actually go through our stack. And it\u2019s not dissimilar from AWS or any SaaS cloud-based business which brings together software that makes something that\u2019s complicated, simple and accessible and charges a small fee for it.\n\nWhat is that fee relative to \u2014 I know there\u2019s not really competition when it comes to Lightning, but in terms of similar types of companies that exist on other payment rails?\n\nWell, so we have a tiered payment plan, but at scale, we\u2019ll basically collect about 15 basis points with no minimum fixed fee. So at a $100 transaction level, that\u2019s about half of the cheapest payment systems that typically settle not in real time. Take ACH, for instance, which settles in three days. It\u2019s considered to be really cheap. And that\u2019s about half of that for real-time secure payments.\n\nWho do you see the customer being for this, maybe now, but also, I think probably more importantly, as you think about company building in the next several years? Who do you see being the companies wanting to plug into this network?\n\nWe\u2019re excited and optimistic about this concept of streaming money.\n\nSo right now, we\u2019re really targeting this toward developers, wallets, exchanges, OTC players. But the developer\u2019s piece is really the most intriguing to us because we feel that if you empower developers with great developer tools and you give them the ability to send and receive money and build products and services that can move value around the world on the internet in real time at a really low cost, that you can build crazy new experiences. So a good example of that, of something that we\u2019re actually pretty excited about and optimistic about, is this concept of streaming money.\n\nAnd let me just take a minute to explain what streaming money is. Because for the last two decades, we\u2019ve been talking about micropayments as a thing, and it never became a thing. And the reason it never became a thing is that the current rails and the way that the pricing is set for payments cannot actually support that use case. The attempts that have typically been made require you as a consumer to preload a wallet that is actually not interoperable with other properties or other publishers and then start spending gradually as you go. So you don\u2019t know as a consumer that you want to put $20 in one publisher\u2019s wallet and you can\u2019t use that balance anywhere else. It\u2019s not really a micropayment \u2014 it\u2019s a commitment.\n\nAnd then the way that the pricing is structured has a minimum fee. So if you wanted to do a 2 cents or 5 cents transaction, the actual cost of the transaction would far exceed the actual amount you\u2019re trying to send. And so streaming money is this concept that you can actually send a cent or a fraction of a cent every second if you want on the network, between say a consumer wallet and a creator wallet. So let\u2019s say that now this podcast would become a premium podcast where the first 10 minutes are free, but then you have dynamic pricing and the most interesting parts are maybe more expensive, and consumers could actually spend cents every second for each segment or every five seconds or every 10 seconds, and that would work globally.\n\nIt\u2019s a concept that we think is very exciting because it could create new monetization opportunities for creators; it could create just new payment models as you go. And we\u2019re very excited about what developers are going to build once you remove all of the constraints of all of these legacy payment rails that are around.\n\nThis is naturally leading us into company process questions. How do you go about selling this product? Do you build a sales team in-house to go out and knock on people\u2019s doors, so to speak? Do you just wait and hope that developers see this and flock to it? You\u2019re starting the company from scratch. How do you think about that?\n\nWell, eventually, we\u2019ll build a sales team, but right now, the sales team is a sales team of internal people, me included, and we\u2019re reaching out to companies we know well. And I think we have a pretty good sense of the real problems that those companies are facing and how we can help them address them and how we can help them build new products that would make them more competitive in pretty competitive landscapes. So I think, at first, it\u2019s going to be all internal. The company is small \u2014 it\u2019s a startup, which feels amazing.\n\nHow many employees?\n\nTwenty-six. So it\u2019s just perfect. And so we\u2019re going to keep it as small for as long as we possibly can. So we\u2019re very principled in how we hire, and we just don\u2019t want to ever get to this place where we\u2019re bloated. So we just want to take it easy with hiring. But that being said, we\u2019re going to launch this product, we\u2019re going to get a number of developers and clients on the platform, and then we have a pretty busy road map ahead where we\u2019re going to continue iterating on the product and build more capabilities and features in whatever\u2019s left of this year.\n\nHow much money have you raised?\n\nSo we don\u2019t really talk about that. It was a fairly substantial round, but we feel like the-\n\nThe reporting I saw was $175 million.\n\nYeah\u2026\n\nSo ballpark, correct? The reason I ask is because I think it speaks to the longevity of what you\u2019re hoping to create and also just the resilience of the company itself.\n\nI think for me, the important thing was how can I structure this in such a way that we can focus on the work and only the work for as long as possible with no or minimal overhead? And part of the fundraising strategy was that \u2014 I actually don\u2019t want to be in a world where we\u2019re fundraising every other year because that takes three months out of the year for the senior leadership team. And so I feel like this is a competitive advantage that we can actually focus on the core product and building rather than being distracted.\n\nThe downside of it, though, is if you\u2019re not very cognizant of the fact that you have a lot of resources and you should try to box that, then you become bloated and fat prematurely, and you can\u2019t ship anything. It\u2019s like this notion that nothing great has ever been shipped by a large team, and I really believe in that. We\u2019re trying to act and behave as if we needed to raise at the end of this year, despite the fact that we don\u2019t.\n\nMaybe if we could dive into that a little more \u2014 how do you think about using capital now as a startup founder versus when you worked at a large company with a ton of resources before? You have a lot of resources relative to most companies your size and just personal connections. You mentioned, \u201cWe want to operate as though we may need to raise at some point. We don\u2019t want to just think that we have unlimited resources.\u201d How do you, as a CEO, manage that day-to-day with the team and manage expectations?\n\nIt\u2019s culture \u2014 it\u2019s 100 percent culture. And at this scale, culture setting is really not hard because it\u2019s 26 people. We\u2019re all thinking about things the same way. And a good measure of a good culture is when you add someone to the team and they feel they\u2019ve always been here two weeks in. And so far, 100 percent of people who joined are exactly that. So we feel pretty good about our culture. And whenever we want to add a software engineer to the team or we want to add anyone on the team, there\u2019s a lot of healthy debate. Do we really need that additional role? Do we really need that additional role for more than a certain period of time? Is it a permanent function that we need someone to actually look after or not?\n\nAnd I feel like we\u2019ve got the right culture. At the time we talk now, we\u2019re launching a product in a few days, and everyone\u2019s been working around the clock over the weekend because we\u2019re pushing something to production for the first time. And it\u2019s just such a great feeling to see people being so hardcore and driven without you having to just ask. It\u2019s just natural. So culture is everything at this scale.\n\nAnd for you as a manager, what\u2019s been the biggest surprise from going from Big Tech \u2014 you were president at PayPal before \u2014 to a small company? What\u2019s been the most surprising and also maybe the most rewarding in that shift?\n\nSo first of all, I don\u2019t see myself as a manager. It feels very \u201clarge company\u201d to talk about it that way. But also, remember that I did startups for all of my life before this decade in large companies. So it feels right at home, it feels very natural for me, and it feels like something that\u2019s really in my DNA. It feels just right. So I have no surprises whatsoever, except that I didn\u2019t know whether I was going to enjoy the hustle of building something from scratch again with the same level of fulfillment and happiness. And I\u2019m actually surprised on the other side of it. I\u2019ve just never felt this great. It\u2019s amazing to be with such talented people on our team doing something really meaningful and no overhead.\n\nTalk about then, I know you\u2019re only 26 people, but how have you structured the company and the people you brought on, and are you a functional organization? How do you think about scaling the company organizationally?\n\nWell, right now, we\u2019re pretty flat. So there\u2019s not a lot of structure by design, and we have very, very senior leaders. So it\u2019s not like we need to spend a ton of time talking about how to structure the team. An interesting thing that I\u2019ve done and tried in the past that works really well is that when I look at the engineering team, the responsibilities are actually split in two. So we have James Everingham, who\u2019s done so many things in our industry for so many years, and he\u2019s really focused on the management piece of the engineering team, the process or lack of process, so to speak. So he\u2019s really acting in a way that enables every single engineer to do their best work and not have overhead.\n\nAnd then Kevin Hurley, our CTO, is really deep into tech in the engine room with all of the engineers. So it\u2019s a split structure \u2014 on one side, more day-to-day management process stuff and, on the other, really deep into the technical weeds of how do we actually make this protocol become the winning protocol for money on the internet.\n\nAnd are you spending most of your time on product, or is it \u2014\n\nI\u2019m doing everything. So it\u2019s product, it\u2019s sales, BD partnerships, everything. It\u2019s great.\n\nThis idea of transacting with Bitcoin is a fascinating one to me, and it\u2019s one that the industry has talked about for years, and obviously, we\u2019re talking about it with Lightning. I think the inherent tension in this is that many Bitcoin buyers really still see Bitcoin as an investment, even though you\u2019ve got people like Gensler out there saying, \u201cIt\u2019s the only crypto I would consider a commodity. Doesn\u2019t really pass the Howey Test,\u201d which maybe that\u2019s debatable \u2014\n\nIt\u2019s not, it\u2019s really not.\n\nIt\u2019s not, okay. But when you have people out there making still $1 million coin price predictions, it seems like that\u2019s a very hard mindset to change for people to think of Bitcoin as more than just a thing you hold on to \u2014 the digital gold analogy. So can you unpack that from your perspective and how you think that will shift because you\u2019re making a huge bet that it will?\n\n\u201cDirt-cheap transactions, real-time settlement, infinite scalability almost.\u201d\n\nSo let\u2019s step back for a minute. First of all, it can\u2019t be a really great way to transact if every transaction takes 10-, 20-plus minutes to clear. And every transaction is actually more expensive than the existing alternatives. So that doesn\u2019t work. So in comes Lightning, really dirt-cheap transactions, real-time settlement, infinite scalability almost. So that solves that problem.\n\nAnd now, when you think about the behavior of people and the way that they think about Bitcoin and transacting with Bitcoin, you talked about the fact that people think of it as gold. But if you go back in history, the way that this happened is basically people were transacting with precious metals and the likes, and then they realized it was actually pretty inconvenient to actually move around with heavy gold to pay for stuff. And so they came up with bank notes.\n\nSo bank notes were basically just a paper that said you had the gold stashed somewhere. And that was true until 1972 when we stopped the gold-pegged dollar. I see Bitcoin to be exactly that, which is today you\u2019re actually not paying with Bitcoin because, to your point, it\u2019s volatile. It moves in price, et cetera, just like gold was and still is, right?\n\nBut if you can actually use fractions of Bitcoin on top of Lightning, in real time, and you have liquidity with all of the other fiat currencies that exist in the world, you can build products that are actually denominated in whatever currency you want. And so the underlying transaction and settlement asset is Bitcoin, but what consumers or merchants are exposed to can be whatever currency you want because you just get in and out of the network the same way that when you send an image, it gets broken into zeros and ones and sent over a TCP/IP network on the internet. You could break down value with small amounts of Bitcoin transacting and moving on the Lightning network in real time.\n\nSo we see it as a core infrastructure to move value around. And then our hope is that developers and other players will build services on top of this stack that are denominated in whatever currency they choose.\n\nSo the idea is that the end consumer doesn\u2019t even necessarily know that this was settled through the Lightning network or Bitcoin.\n\nCorrect.\n\nIt\u2019s all in fiat for the consumer.\n\nIt could be.\n\nDo you see the world trending in denominations of Satoshis, or Sats, which are the smallest units of Bitcoins or staying in fiat, which is legal tender like dollars? Or do you think that\u2019s more of a sector-specific thing?\n\nI think there might be really good use cases for native Sats-denominated payments, and so if you spend time on Nostr, which is this decentralized social network running on relays.\n\nJack Dorsey is a huge proponent of it. It integrates with Lightning.\n\nYeah. It integrates with Lightning, and it\u2019s fascinating to see the velocity of payments for Zaps or small payments for tipping essentially for posts. And you see the growth of the volume of payments on the network with very, very tiny amounts. And I think when it comes to publishing or when it comes to content monetization or creator monetization, I think you could see models exist on top of this network that are going to be Sats-denominated because it\u2019s kind of the native purest form of payment on the settlement network. And so again, we\u2019ll see what developers build now that the bearer of entry in terms of complexity and operational overhead has been completely eliminated.\n\nWhat is the number one concern you hear from a potential customer you\u2019re talking to about building on Lightning, building with you?\n\nYeah, that\u2019s a great question. We spent a lot of time engaging with all kinds of potential future customers, and they fall into two categories. One is they have looked into Lightning because, on paper, it looks amazing. And then they\u2019ve spent cycles to actually try to get a well-connected node and try to get transactions moving on the network. And then they threw in the towel because it was too operationally intensive and complicated, and they had to have full-time people actually managing their node. So that\u2019s one category.\n\nThe other category is actually, \u201cOh, I already am on the Lightning Network, but I have all of these same problems. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to actually not have to deal with all of that stuff so we can focus on our core business, which is definitely not managing a node on the Lightning network?\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019s a little bit like if, in 2023, you wanted to launch a website where you would have to actually go buy a server hardware and a router and configure the whole thing and put it in a rack and do all of these things, no one would do it. And so the analogy is basically that now it\u2019s going to be as simple as just going to a hosting website and launching your website with \u201cwhat-you-see-is-what-you-get\u201d kind of tools. So that\u2019s basically the analogy. We\u2019re moving from that rack, a server, connected to a router era of the Lightning network to, \u201cI go to lightspark.com, I open an account, and I\u2019m up and running in minutes.\u201d\n\nI thought you were going to say maybe a regulatory concern about using or settling with Bitcoin at all. Does that not really come up?\n\n\u201cOut of all of the networks and assets out there, Bitcoin has the greatest regulatory clarity.\u201d\n\nNo. That\u2019s one of the advantages also of building on top of Bitcoin, which is that out of all of the networks and assets out there, it has the greatest regulatory clarity. And you see it because you see mainstream financial institutions offering Bitcoin products. Fidelity is now offering a 401(k) denominated in Bitcoin and the ability for any Fidelity customer to buy and sell Bitcoin. You can see mainstream financial services companies, well-established brands, carry Bitcoin products for their customers. And you don\u2019t see that with other assets and other networks. And that\u2019s because there is more regulatory clarity than with any other assets or network.\n\nDo you think there\u2019s enough, though? Regulatory clarity?\n\nLook, if you ask me about the state of the US regulatory clarity for crypto in general, of course we don\u2019t have enough regulatory clarity. I\u2019ve been very vocal about that as well, which is if you want to reap the benefits of this revolution \u2014 because it is a revolution that will actually benefit consumers and create the next generation of leading companies \u2014 and if you want all of that to happen in the US, you need to have clear laws and regulations that, on one hand, protect consumers but, on the other, really incentivizes innovation to stay onshore in the US rather than just escape and go to The Bahamas or wherever you want to go.\n\nSo I think it\u2019s essential. I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019re moving in the right direction. I think right now, you can see the House Financial Services Committee actually moving in a direction of trying to bring more clarity for digital assets in general. So I think we\u2019ll get to a good place, but it\u2019s been, I know, very frustrating for many, many players out there to not have a clear set of rules that they can operate around.\n\nDo you have any sense of optimism, though, just in seeing what the tenor of the conversation was like when you were at Facebook and you were speaking before Congress in DC a lot, versus now in the progression? It seems like progression has been made, but maybe only on the edges in terms of \u2014\n\nNo, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve made progress.\n\nYou don\u2019t think there\u2019s any progress?\n\nI don\u2019t think we made a lot of progress. I think people got more educated about the risks and opportunities I think. I feel like the education is slanted toward the risks more than the opportunities, which is kind of unfortunate. But no, we haven\u2019t made that much progress. And it\u2019s a problem. It\u2019s a real problem.\n\nWhat do you think is holding that back? Why are politicians so hawkish on this?\n\nI think it\u2019s a combination of different political undercurrents. But at the end of the day, I think that the surprising part is that if you\u2019re an elected official, you need to look after the interest of your constituents. So on one hand, it\u2019s normal when you see FTX blow up and all these things to try to say, \u201cOkay, this is actually really not okay. We need to protect investors, and we need to protect consumers from bad actors, the same way that we\u2019ve protected consumers from Wall Street bad actors back in the day. And now we have a clear set of rules, and we\u2019re in a good place.\u201d\n\nI think that the problem is actually when you don\u2019t look at the opportunities to lower the costs for all kinds of financial services and payments on behalf of your constituents and, therefore, basically just stay very aligned with the status quo when it comes to incumbents controlling everything and basically pricing things way too high. And so with payments, notably, we\u2019re in a world that looks exactly like pre-internet era with telecoms, where you used to spend a dollar a minute for an international call and you used to pay 25 cents for text messages. We\u2019re exactly in that world and we\u2019re in 2023. And there\u2019s no open competition. So it\u2019s a problem.\n\nHow does progress get made?\n\nWell, first I think that we could have done without all of the bad actors giving a terrible reputation to the entire industry by their reckless behavior. And I think that the problem is also as an industry, we have to start building things that solve real-world problems for a lot of people, and not build speculative products that are made to get rich really quickly, which obviously is just not the way to build an industry.\n\nAnd I think that the fact that we\u2019re in a bear market in a crypto winter is actually good in that way. And you see a lot more energy coming back to Bitcoin when it comes to developer energy with Ordinals and all kinds of other developments. And that wouldn\u2019t have happened last year because people would\u2019ve wanted to issue a token and make money out of this thing. And now actually building on top of Bitcoin, you\u2019re not making money with a new token, you\u2019re going to actually make money because you build something of value, and the underlying asset is Bitcoin, and you can\u2019t actually jumpstart the whole value creation. You have to go with it. So I think all of these things are going to help change the temperature and get us to a good place, but I still think it\u2019s going to take at least a couple of years.\n\nWhat is the biggest risk to Bitcoin as a currency, as a network in your mind right now?\n\nWell, I think public opinion is just generally a thing. And when you look at the narrative around energy consumption and all of these things around Bitcoin, I feel like there\u2019s a lot of posturing and not a lot of understanding of how energy generation, storage, and usage actually works. So I think that\u2019s one angle where I feel like the narrative doesn\u2019t match the reality of energy companies and utility companies and the fact that Bitcoin actually accelerates the adoption of renewables, because you can actually build a plant without waiting to have a 10-year lead time to connect it to the grid and have Bitcoin miners use the energy early on, and then amortize basically your investment as a renewable energy company until you can connect to the grid. That\u2019s one example. No one talks about that.\n\nAnd I think, of course, the network, you could have said a decade ago that this was actually at risk of being hacked or risk of vulnerabilities, et cetera. But this network has proven to be incredibly resilient over 13 years. So I feel really good about that. It\u2019s more of a general trend of the underlying crypto industry that is problematic for the whole industry, rather than Bitcoin itself.\n\nMaybe we could end it here just on a big-picture thing about Bitcoin itself. We\u2019ve talked a lot about why it could work as a settlement layer, some of the concerns around regulation. For the average, everyday person who has most of their money in their bank in USD or whatever, and they think of Bitcoin as this thing that you can use on gambling websites or whatever, it\u2019s this thing still on the peripheral. What do you say to them? Why is Bitcoin something that they should even be thinking about?\n\nI find that it\u2019s really hard to explain the reality of the majority of people living on Earth to people here in America because we have it all, right? We have a stable currency. We have a banking system that, for the most part, we can actually feel pretty confident about. We have decently efficient payment systems. It\u2019s not like we go buy a coffee and we tell ourselves, \u201cOh man, I wish that there was an easier way to pay for this thing.\u201d But that\u2019s a myopic view of what the rest of the world experiences. In a lot of other countries, people have hyperinflation at insane rates, which forces them to actually spend everything they have the minute they get their paycheck because actually, a bottle of water would retain more value than the bank notes in their pocket over the course of a couple of days even.\n\n\u201cThe fact that you have a form of value that is not controlled by any group of people is lifesaving, literally.\u201d\n\nAnd they can\u2019t trust their banking system. So in those places, actually, the fact that you have a form of value that is not controlled by any group of people is lifesaving, literally. And so I think we need to put that in perspective.\n\nBut I think that for us here in most Western countries and other parts of the world that have stable currencies, I think the reality is when we still want to move money around, it\u2019s still complicated. When I was running PayPal, we acquired Braintree and Venmo as a package deal. That was maybe 10 years ago, and you still can\u2019t move money around between Venmo and PayPal, and they\u2019re part of the same company. It\u2019s a little bit like you were trapped in Gmail and you could never send an email between Gmail and whatever other domain or Yahoo Mail or whatever it is. And so that\u2019s the state of payments today.\n\nSo when I think about countries like ours and other parts of the world, I think about all of the innovation that can come from a truly interoperable, really cheap payment protocol on the internet. We talked about streaming money. We talked about moving money around the world in a more seamless way. We talked about people potentially getting their money way sooner and, as such, really having more opportunities to spend the money they earn.\n\nSo there\u2019s a lot of innovation that will be unlocked. When you think about my analogy with telecoms, it\u2019s not like the internet changed the way that people talk on the phone. You still talk on the phone, but instead of paying a dollar a minute, it\u2019s now free. And now if you want to do a group video chat with everyone in high definition, you can. And it\u2019s amazing. And that is net new. And so I think that when you think about it, a brand-new fully interoperable open protocol for payments on the internet, I think that we\u2019ll see a lot of innovation around how value moves around the world that will benefit everyone, not only people who are as lucky as we are here in the US.\n\nAll right, David, I think we\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks for being on Decoder.\n\nThank you for having me."

Ether fell about 1% to $1,835.88.\n\nEarlier in the day, bitcoin jumped as much as about 8% and briefly reclaimed the $30,000 level. That helped lift ether, which advanced more than 6% at one point to about $1,950.\n\nBitcoin had been trading sideways for several days, with volatility back to its lows of early March, before the banking crisis began and became one of the cryptocurrency's biggest upward catalysts this year. Beginning late Tuesday, troubles at First Republic helped drive the cryptocurrency's price action again, according to Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management.\n\n\"Crypto rallies during banking crises, and it looks like the banking crisis may not be over,\" Hougan said.\n\nFirst Republic shares fell almost 30% Wednesday, bringing its two-day loss to about 80%, after reporting a massive drop in deposits in the first quarter as customers pulled their money out following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. CNBC's David Faber reported that the next few days are crucial for the company, as other banks and federal officials seek to pull together a rescue plan."

His sentencing is scheduled for July 17.\n\nInside the U.S. Federal Court House in Concord, New Hampshire, approximately 35 people came to support DiMezzo during her sentencing \u2013 Freeman among them.\n\n\u201cAria is an amazing person who has a ton of good people in her life who support her,\u201d Freeman said.\n\nNBC10 Boston Ian Freeman outside of the courthouse in Concord, NH to support Aria DiMezzo during her sentencing.\n\nDiMezzo and her attorney Richard Guerriero were pushing for a one-year home confinement sentence, arguing the only wrongdoing was not having a license, which is why she pleaded guilty only to that charge.\n\nFederal prosecutors argued DiMezzo should receive 30-37 months in prison, citing the sentencing guidelines for the nature of the crime. Prosecutors also showed a video clip of DiMezzo giving a presentation about how to sell bitcoin and instructing viewers not to ask about why someone might want to buy it. They argued this video proved her actions were \u201cmore aggravated than simply not getting a license.\u201d\n\nDiMezzo gave a statement regarding her belief in financial privacy, saying she did not believe what she was doing was illegal or harming anyone being scammed.\n\nRegarding her statement about financial privacy, Judge Joseph Leplante said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter, the harm is still the harm.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the 18 month sentence, DiMezzo forfeited $14,000 and almost two bitcoin, worth about $55,000. She was also ordered to pay a $5,000 fine and will have a one-year supervised release after serving her sentence.\n\nDiMezzo's supporters were hugging and crying after the decision.\n\nAndrea Madison, general manager of Domino\u2019s in Keene, where DiMezzo works as an assistant general manager, was in tears.\n\n\u201cIt hurts,\u201d Madison said. \u201cWe\u2019re losing a very dear friend for 18 months, so it\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\n\nDiMezzo lives in Keene.

        "content": "Venture investor Chamath Palihapitiya, who once thought that Bitcoin had \u201ceffectively replaced gold,\u201d now thinks that \u201ccrypto is dead in America\u201d owing to U.S. regulatory pressure on the sector.\n\n\u201cThe United States authorities have firmly pointed their guns at crypto,\u201d Palihapitiya said on an episode of the All-In podcast, which he cohosts, released on Saturday.\n\nThe investor said that while crypto companies \u201cwere probably the ones that were the most threatening to the establishment,\u201d the sector also pushed \u201cthe boundaries more than any other sector of the startup economy.\u201d\n\nThe crypto industry is accusing the Securities and Exchange Commission and its chair, Gary Gensler, of \u201cregulation by enforcement,\u201d or pursuing lawsuits against cryptocurrency companies rather than setting a clear regulatory framework.\n\n\u201cYou had Gensler even blaming the banking crisis on crypto,\u201d Palihapitiya complained. The chair of the SEC has highlighted two crypto-friendly failed banks, Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank of New York, in congressional remarks on the crisis.\n\nThe pressure on crypto exchanges is encouraging some companies to look outside the U.S. Coinbase announced last week that Bermuda had granted the company a license to operate in the territory, in what is likely the first step toward launching a new offshore exchange.\n\nCrypto exchanges are also thinking about the semiautonomous Chinese city of Hong Kong, whose government is embracing digital assets and cryptocurrencies as a way to revive its status as an international financial center. The city\u2019s financial regulators have proposed rules to allow retail trading of digital assets, and are helping to connect crypto firms with banks.\n\nThat\u2019s leading some crypto companies to move their Asia operations to Hong Kong. At a congressional hearing last week, Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) accused Gensler of \u201cdoing nothing in protecting everyday Americans and pushing American firms into the hands of the [Chinese Communist Party].\u201d (Cryptocurrency trading is still banned in mainland China, unlike in semiautonomous Hong Kong.)\n\nOn Monday, Coinbase sued to compel the SEC to respond to the exchange\u2019s petition asking for rulemaking, filed last July. \u201cBecause we\u2019re absolutely convinced the SEC is violating the law, we feel like we have no choice but to take them to court,\u201d Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal told Fortune. Coinbase also received a Wells Notice, which informs a firm of imminent legal action, from the SEC on March 22.\n\nPalihapitiya on Saturday suggested Coinbase was a company that \u201ctried to do the right things\u201d when it came to working with regulators.\n\nNot quite to $200,000 anymore\n\nPalihapitiya used to be very bullish on Bitcoin, telling CNBC in 2021 that he expected Bitcoin to eventually hit $200,000. The cryptocurrency was worth around $39,000 at the time.\n\nBitcoin would eventually peak at almost $69,000 in November 2021, before plunging in value in 2022 following several high-profile crypto scandals and interest rate increases from the U.S. Federal Reserve. The cryptocurrency bottomed at about $15,500 in December 2022, and has since rebounded to hover between $27,000 and $30,000.\n\nInterest rate hikes have also hit Palihapitiya\u2019s other investments. The investor was well known for taking startups like space tourism provider Virgin Galactic and real estate platform Opendoor to public markets through special purpose acquisition companies. SPACs, sometimes known as blank-check firms, are public firms constituted for the purpose of acquiring a privately held company, which inherits the listing.\n\nPalihapitiya closed two of his SPACs last September after failing to acquire a company to take public. \u201cThe era of excess, abundance, and zero-interest-rate policy has come to an end,\u201d wrote Palihapitiya to Social Capital\u2019s limited partners in early April, continuing that the past year was like \u201cgetting cold water thrown in our faces.\u201d\n\nStill, some bullish bets on Bitcoin are reemerging. On Monday, Standard Chartered\u2019s head of digital assets research suggested that the cryptocurrency might hit $100,000 by the end of 2024, citing an end to interest rate hikes following the banking crisis in the U.S."

        "content": "Bitcoin failed to fulfil one of its purposes last year as a hedge against soaring inflation, but it came into its own recently via another original purpose \u2013 as a bet against the legacy banking system. Its decentralized and trustless attributes have made the leading crypto one to hold against a backdrop of multiple bank collapses. In fact, delivering gains of 70% though Q1 made it the quarter\u2019s best performing asset.\n\nAnd it has got plenty more room to run, says Geoff Kendrick, head of crypto research at British banking giant Standard Chartered. \u201cWe see potential for Bitcoin to reach the $100,000 level by end-2024, as we believe the much-touted \u2018crypto winter\u2019 is finally over,\u201d Kendrick noted.\n\nThat\u2019s a gain of 240% from current levels, a surge that will be hard to find elsewhere. For many, though, buying bitcoin directly still represents somewhat of a complicated act but there are ways to get skin in the game without directly purchasing the asset. The stock market presents opportunities with many names operating in the bitcoin ecosystem \u2013 miners in particular \u2013 and their performance naturally correlates with that of the daddy of crypto. Hence, if bitcoin is set to surge so will many bitcoin-themed stocks.\n\nWith this in mind, we delved into the TipRanks database and pulled up the details on 3 crypto stocks poised to make use of that anticipated run. What\u2019s more, all 3 are rated as Strong Buys by the analyst consensus. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nCleanSpark, Inc. (CLSK)\n\nWe\u2019ll start with CleanSpark, a bitcoin miner that sometime ago decided bitcoin mining was where it\u2019s at. While once the company specialized solely in microgrid solutions, it began dabbling in mining operations toward the end of 2020. However, since then, mining endeavors have become its main priority.\n\nCleanSpark oversees its own mining operations in Atlanta, Georgia and co-locates miners in Massena, NY. Bitcoin is famous for being hugely energy intensive, but the company likes to highlight its credentials as a sustainable player, mining the bulk of its BTC with renewable or low-carbon energy sources. By often selling its mined bitcoin, the company has funded expansion and last year, even as the crypto winter raged, increased its hashrate \u2013 the measure of the computational power used to mine the asset \u2013 from 2.1 EH/s in January to 6.2 EH/s at the end of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has set its sights on bringing that hashrate up to 16.0 EH/s by the end of 2023, and recent purchases will go toward making that goal a reality. The company recently announced a purchase of 45K new Antminer S19 XP machines that when eventually deployed will almost double the current hashrate.\n\nAccording to H.C. Wainwright analyst Mike Colonnese, the company exhibited some canny business nous when securing the deal which comes roughly two months following the company\u2019s purchase of 20,000 Bitmain rigs for a 25% discount.\n\n\u201cCLSK secured the machines for a very attractive $23/TH (before applying coupons), the lowest we\u2019ve seen in the market for these rigs, and 12% below the going rate for high efficiency ASICs (under 25 J/TH), based on Luxor\u2019s Bitcoin ASIC Price Index,\u201d the analyst explained.\n\n\u201cManagement has been very opportunistic in acquiring new mining rigs at rock bottom prices over the past year, which we believe will drive significant shareholder value, and with this latest purchase, the company has now secured 99%, or 15.9 EH/s of the miners required to reach its year-end 2023 hash rate target of 16 EH/s\u2026 We continue to view the stock as significantly undervalued relative to fundamentals,\u201d Colonnese added.\n\nOverall, CLSK shares have soared 98% year-to-date, but Colonnese sees ample growth ahead. Calling CLSK a \u2018top pick,\u2019 the analyst rates the shares a Buy while his $12 price target makes room for 12-month returns of a whooping 194%. (To watch Colonnese\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nThis bitcoin miner has garnered two other recent reviews and both are positive, making the consensus view here a Strong Buy. The $8.33 average target might represent a more modest objective, but could still yield gains of a handsome 104% over the next year. (See CLSK stock forecast)\n\nHIVE Blockchain Technologies (HIVE)\n\nThe next bitcoin miner we\u2019re looking at is HIVE Blockchain Technologies. Fun fact: in 2017, HIVE became the first publicly traded crypto miner. The company actually got its start as a GPU-based miner of Ethereum but in 2020 it also began mining bitcoin and has expanded is operations since then. The company has a commitment to ESG practices and mines its bitcoin using green energy, making use of favorable power costs and renewable energy sources with mining operations in Canada, Iceland, and Sweden.\n\nTouting its BTC credentials, the company aims to foster long-term shareholder value with the OG practice of HODLing \u2013 keeping its bitcoin close to its chest.\n\nThat said, HIVE saw a big drop in its revenue stream in the most recent financial report \u2013 for its fiscal third quarter (December quarter). Revenue fell by 79% year-over-year to $14.3 million, which can be attributed not only to an increase in global hashrate and reduced cryptocurrency prices but also to Ethereum\u2019s switch to a proof-of-stake model. That said, the company mined 787 bitcoin during the quarter, amounting to a 13% year-over-year increase, while its average cost of production per BTC was $13,599. The current BTC price is more than double that.\n\nThe company also said that in order to maximize profitability, it intentionally pulled back on production and also repurposed some of its GPUs into non-mining endeavors.\n\nLooking at these activities, Canaccord analyst Joseph Vafi likes the way this firm operates. The 5-star analyst writes: \u201cWe see the current setup for HIVE as healthy on multiple fronts. We are encouraged by the company\u2019s efficient Bitcoin production, strong balance sheet, steady progress at its facilities, and prudent approach toward repurposing its GPU machines. Perhaps most importantly, at a macro level we believe that digital assets are biased higher in the medium term to long term, and especially Bitcoin, which has handled resistance relatively well in the face of recent market volatility\u2026\u201d\n\nThese comments form the basis for Vafi\u2019s Buy rating on HIVE, which is backed by a $7 price target. Even after posting year-to-date gains of a hefty 119%, investors stand to pocket returns of 134%, should this figure be met. (To watch Vafi\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nElsewhere on the Street, with two additional positive reviews in tow, HIVE claims a Strong Buy consensus rating. The forecast calls for 12-month returns of 57%, considering the average target clocks in at $5.33. (See HIVE stock forecast)\n\nIris Energy (IREN)\n\nBitcoin has its fair share of evangelists and two early adopters convinced in its value are the driving force behind are next BTC-flavored stock. Daniel and Will Roberts are the co-founders and co-CEOs of Sydney, Australia-based Iris Energy and used their background and expertise in renewable energy and traditional mining when setting off on their bitcoin mining activities.\n\nThe company operates in regions that have an abundance of renewable energy \u2013 wind, solar, hydro -and their locations are run on 100% renewables. Iris sticks to a simple plan: mine bitcoin, sell it and pay energy bills and overheads.\n\nHowever, the company ran into some issues last year, attempting to scale meaningfully at what turned out to be extremely bad timing. With crypto winter at its peak and the industry rocked by multiple scandals (Terra Luna, Celsius, FTX), bitcoin\u2019s price crashed. Against this backdrop, several mining firms over-leveraged, saw profits drop and were driven into insolvency.\n\nHowever, through prudent business practices, Iris seems to have weathered the storm. And for Compass Point analyst Chase White, the way the company has handled matters informs his bullish take.\n\n\u201cNow that IREN has restructured its balance sheet to eliminate virtually all of its debt, replaced the miners lost to its creditors because of the restructuring with no additional cash outlays, and is almost finished with its capex spend to get to 5.5 EH/s, we believe the company is very well positioned to start generating solid free cash flows at current BTC prices with the opportunity to invest in further growth if BTC prices rise further,\u201d White opined.\n\nIn fact, the lack of debt and the near completion of facility buildouts have \u201cderisked the story significantly,\u201d the analyst said.\n\nIREN shares have benefited immensely from bitcoin\u2019s surge and have posted growth of 260% since the turn of the year. However, White thinks there are plenty more gains in store. Along with a Buy rating, his $11 price target suggests the stock has room for additional growth of 144% in the year ahead. (To watch White\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nWhite\u2019s thesis gets the full backing of his colleagues here. The stock garners Buys only \u2013 4, in total \u2013 for a Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares are expected to change hands for ~78% premium a year from now, considering the average target stands at $8.

Credit: Bloomberg / Getty Images\n\nApple may have fallen out of love with Bitcoin.\n\nIn April, an unusual bit of news made the rounds: Someone had hidden a copy of the Bitcoin whitepaper in Apple's macOS, and it remained there for years and through multiple major versions of the OS.\n\nIt probably ends now, however. According to 9to5Mac, the latest beta version of macOS Ventura doesn't contain the file anymore.\n\nThe file, which was hidden inside a tool called \"VirtualScanner.app\" is nowhere to be found, and the entire VirtualScanner.app itself was removed, too. Besides the copy of the Bitcoin whitepaper, the file also contained a mysterious image, likely taken on Treasure Island in San Francisco, along with a few other files.\n\nSorry, you'll have to procure your copy of the Bitcoin whitepaper elsewhere. Credit: Satoshi Nakamoto/Apple\n\nThe Bitcoin whitepaper was originally published by Bitcoin's mysterious founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, in 2008. It contains a technical overview of the Bitcoin protocol.\n\nFeatured Video For You Biden's crypto executive order is (finally) here\n\nWe may never find out why the Bitcoin whitepaper was hidden inside macOS in the first place. Given that it was fairly quickly expunged from the OS, it's likely that an Apple engineer thought it would be a cool idea, but Apple decided they don't want to be associated with Bitcoin in this way."

Source: Google Finance\n\nBitcoin\u2019s growth in the Argentine markets coincides with the continuous ARS devaluation. For instance, traders were paying as low as 460 ARS to buy $1 from the black market on April 24 \u2014 more than double the official spot rate that pays 220 ARS for the dollar.\n\nFMyA, a United States-based consultancy firm, noted that the Argentine central bank\u2019s reserves have dropped by half to an estimated $1.3 billion since 2019.\n\nThat has raised the risks of further peso devaluation, which has crashed nearly 99% from the currency crisis peak of 330 ARS in 2018. That has led locals to seek haven in the dollar, which has become scarce due to rising demand in the country.\n\nARS/USD price performance since 2004. Source: Google Finance\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies operating outside governments\u2019 and central banks\u2019 purview are increasingly emerging as alternatives.

Source: Paxful/CoinDance\n\nAlso, a study in 2022 found that nearly 60% of Argentines believe in Bitcoin\u2019s ability to safeguard the value of their savings in the long term. Popular U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase also recommends BTC become a legal tender in Argentina.\n\nBitcoin gaining traction in Argentina\n\nEarlier in April, the National Commission of Value (CNV), Argentina\u2019s securities regulator, approved a Bitcoin-based futures index on the Matba Rofex exchange set to debut in May. The derivative, settled in pesos, will enable accredited investors to gain exposure to the Bitcoin markets.\n\nRelated: Latin America is ready for crypto \u2014 Just integrate it with their payment systems\n\nIn addition, a recent bill proposed by the Ministry of Economy asked citizens to declare their crypto holdings and incentivized them with tax benefits.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is done with its bear market, but the coming months may see a return to $20,000.\n\nThat is the outlook for Philip Swift, a veteran Bitcoin market analyst who co-founded trading suite DecenTrader and data resource Look Into Bitcoin.\n\nIn his latest interview with Cointelegraph, Swift takes a look at what the near to long-term future holds for BTC price action.\n\nAfter predicting the end of the bear market at the end of 2022, Swift is sticking by his appraisal of underlying price strength, while staying cautious on the odds of a deeper correction than last week\u2019s 10% dip.\n\nBulls face many obstacles on the road to new all-time highs, he said, with government policy particularly troubling when it comes to potential price suppression.\n\nNonetheless, there is every reason to believe that for now, the bottom is in, and a solid period of growth awaits Bitcoin in the latter half of the year.\n\nCointelegraph (CT): In our last interview in October, you predicted the Bitcoin bear market would be over in three months. Do you think it\u2019s gone for good?\n\nPhilip Swift (PS): Yes.\n\nIt really felt like we were close to max pain back in October, and we got the final capitulation shortly after in November. BTC then started trending up in January, three months after our interview.\n\nThis chart highlights how the current bear market has been really quite similar to previous cycles in terms of timing showing that human nature never really changes.\n\nThat does not mean we cannot have a decent correction in the next few months, though. We may experience some volatility and chop after what has been an outstanding Q1 2023 where BTC has rallied 80%. I would not be surprised if we need to cool off for a little while.\n\nCT: Since Bitcoin gained 80% in Q1, has BTC\u2019s price performance in 2023 surprised you?\n\nPS: It is not unusual for Bitcoin to put in major moves like that after such a long period of depression. As the price rallied up from the lows, we could see that funding rates were remaining flat/negative, which indicated that there was major disbelief among derivative traders.\n\nThat helped BTC\u2019s price keep trending up all the way to $30,000 with a succession of short squeezes.\n\nCT: A large number of market participants remain skeptical of this year\u2019s rally and expect a return to $20,000 or worse. To what extent do you agree with them?\n\nPS: It is definitely possible, as that would just be a -25% move to the downside from current prices. For a volatile asset like Bitcoin, that could quite easily play out at some point in the next three to four months. Beyond that, I think it becomes increasingly unlikely, as I do believe that the halving narrative will kick in later in the year, which should increase buy pressure.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price flatlines near $27K \u2014 What can trigger the next move?\n\nCT: We\u2019ve had various regulatory bombshells from which Bitcoin has managed to bounce back time and again in recent months. Do you think the market can continue to shake off such \u201cmini\u201d black swans?\n\nPS: I do as long as these mini black swans are quite specific and not industry-wide. To expand on that, my greatest fear for Bitcoin is a coordinated attack by major governments to cut off the fiat banking on and off-ramps that support the space.\n\n\u201cI know Bitcoin is built to survive in isolation, but I do think that if such a coordinated effort is executed well, it would significantly suppress price for a long time.\u201d\n\nWhat we are seeing in the U.S. right now in terms of regulations is not particularly encouraging. It is definitely something to watch over the next couple of years.\n\nCT: What\u2019s your take on the U.S. banking crisis and its aftermath? Are we in for more shock events in the near to mid-term?\n\nPS: We will have to wait and see whether or not recent banking sector events were just the tip of the iceberg. However, I do think such events are ultimately a positive catalyst for Bitcoin \u2014 particularly among younger people, who will continue to question why they are better off having savings in a bank where there is custodial risk versus a decentralized self-custodied asset like Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cUltimately, I believe that banking sector problems relating to customer deposits are long-term bullish for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nCT: All things being equal, how do you see BTC/USD performing this quarter and beyond? Is it too early to talk about a pre-halving build-up?\n\nPS: I think we may need some sideways action from here for a few months after the stonking Q1 Bitcoin had. Toward the end of the year, late Q3 and into Q4, I expect the pre-halving narrative to really get going, which should have a positive impact on price.\n\nAlso, that should be enough time for the market to heal post-FTX. We should also have gone through much of the Mt. Gox selling risk. Any remaining selling should be evaluated and priced in by the market at that point.\n\nCT: Filbfilb (CEO of DecenTrader) recently released an analysis of how Bitcoin might perform during the next halving cycle and doubled down on $180,000 as his top target. Where do you stand on the next cycle\u2019s blow-off top?\n\nPS: It is certainly possible. I expect long-term holders to start offloading their Bitcoin as the price goes beyond $80,000.\n\n\u201cThat will start to bring new supply into the market. Eventually, there will be too much supply for demand to soak up. I do expect that to be over $100,000.\u201d\n\nExactly where is very hard to call. Back in 2017, we saw a price rally from $10,000 up to the $20,000 high in less than two weeks! Many people forget about that. If we do get another blow-off top like that, such volatility makes it extremely difficult or near impossible to call the exact top.\n\n\u201cI think a realistic range would be $120,000\u2013$210,000.\u201d\n\nCT: What BTC price metrics currently have your attention?\n\nPS: Bull market comparison: useful to understand where we are from a timing perspective.\n\n1yr HODL Wave: Shows that long-term holders have accumulated and will not sell en masse until the price makes a new all-time high.\n\nBitcoin 1-year HODL Wave chart.

Still a long way to go until we get close to a market top.\n\nBitcoin MVRV Z-Score chart. Source: DecenTrader\n\nCT: Is the NFT market dead?\n\nPS: No, but it is currently in a state of major depression.\n\nWhile quality collections are broadly flat in USD terms, nearly all major collections are down versus Ether (ETH) over the past several months.\n\nVolumes are way down since bull market highs \u2014 $150 million per week versus the bull market highs of $1 billion.\n\nWe are even seeing NFT influencers on Twitter pivot to talk about other subjects like AI. That is not to say those influencers are not bullish long-term on NFTs, just that interest in short to mid-term NFT prices has clearly evaporated.\n\n\u201cHaving said that, we believe that we may soon be coming toward the latter stages of the NFT bear market.\u201d\n\nWhile there may be more general market pain, we expect to see strategic investors increasingly on the lookout for quality NFTs at bargain prices. This could provide relief for a small number of collections in the near term.\n\nMagazine: Crypto regulation: Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Bitcoin in War: OP_RETURN Callouts of Russian Military Bitcoin Addresses Point to Blockchains\u2019 Growing Role in ... - Chainalysis Blog",
        "content": "The intersection of cryptocurrency and geopolitical conflict has been a growing topic over the last year. From nation state ransomware attacks, to U.S. National Defense Fellow Jason Lowery\u2019s Softwar thesis, many believe that cryptocurrency has a role to play in 21st century warfare. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine War has provided the best example of this to date, with both sides using crypto to solicit donations and finance the war effort. However, we recently discovered what appears to be an example of a more direct, aggressive usage of Bitcoin for counterintelligence, through the unprecedented weaponization of the OP_RETURN field. We\u2019ll explain below.\n\nMystery Bitcoin user labels nearly 1,000 addresses as Russian government assets in OP_RETURN transactions\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Russian state actors have embraced cryptocurrency. Chainalysis has written in the past about geopolitically motivated ransomware attacks carried out by Russian groups against Ukrainian targets in the leadup to the war, and since the invasion, pro-Russia groups have solicited millions in crypto donations. Additionally, Russia-based cybercrime syndicates like those under the Evil Corp umbrella have suspected links to Russian intelligence.\n\nUnder ordinary circumstances, it would be difficult to detect cryptocurrency addresses used by hostile actors unless you were actively looking for them. But starting on February 12, 2022 \u2014 weeks before the Russian invasion of Ukraine \u2014 and ending on March 14, 2022, an anonymous Bitcoin user sounded the alarm and called out nearly 1,000 addresses they claim belong to Russian security agencies. How did they do it? OP_RETURNs. OP_RETURN is a field used to store data in transactions, effectively allowing users to attach messages to transactions and broadcast them to the entire blockchain, where they\u2019ll be saved forever. OP_RETURNs also mark the transaction\u2019s output as invalid, meaning that any Bitcoin attached to an OP_RETURN transaction is gone forever. In this case, an individual or group sent thousands of transactions to a total of 986 unique Bitcoin addresses, claiming that these addresses were linked to Russian intelligence agencies. Here\u2019s what some of that transaction activity looks like in Chainalysis Reactor.\n\nEach transaction contained one of the four following messages, originally written in Russian:\n\n\u201cGRU to SVR. Used for hacking!\u201d\n\n\u201cGRU to GRU. Used for hacking!\u201d\n\n\u201cGRU to FSB. Used for hacking!\u201d\n\n\u201cHelp Ukraine with money from the GRU Khakir\u201d\n\nEach message claims the address in question was used in hacking operations by one of three Russian agencies: the Foreign Military Intelligence Agency (GRU), Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), and Federal Security Service (FSB). To make things even more interesting, most of the OP_RETURN messages originated from addresses that the OP_RETURN vigilante also said belong to the Russian government in other OP_RETURN messages. Assuming the vigilante\u2019s accusations are true, that would mean this individual accessed the private keys of Russian-controlled addresses, either through hacking or collaboration with an insider. In a series of transactions taking place in April 2022 \u2014 a few months after the others, and over a month into the invasion \u2014 the OP_RETURN vigilante sent funds held by what they claim to be a Russian-controlled address to a Ukrainian aid donation address, as indicated by the last of the four OP_RETURN messages \u2014 we can see that donation address in the upper right-hand corner of the Reactor graph above.\n\nThe address 1CMugHhsSf8Bzrp142BpvUynWBR1RiqMCk provides a good example of a case where the OP_RETURN vigilante may have hacked the private keys of Russian-controlled addresses. 1CMug\u2026 initially sent OP_RETURN transactions accusing several other addresses of belonging to the Russian government, burning its 0.059 BTC balance in the process (1CMug\u2026 initially received those funds in 2020 from an unknown source). Later, 1CMug\u2026 received OP_RETURN transactions from other addresses claiming that it too was connected to Russian government operations. Many of the other addresses followed a similar pattern. Assuming the OP_RETURN messages are true, activity like this would indicate that the OP_RETURN sender gained access to the private keys of some GRU addresses, either through hacking or collaboration with an insider.\n\nDo the accused addresses really belong to Russian intelligence and security services?\n\nThe value of the analysis above hinges on whether you believe the vigilante\u2019s claims. Anyone can say whatever they want in an OP_RETURN message, but how can we know that the addresses our vigilante tagged really are connected to Russian hacking activity?\n\nWe have good evidence for at least three of the addresses. Two of them \u2014 1DLA46sXYps3PdS3HpGfdt9MbQpo6FytPm and 1L5QKvh2Fc86j947rZt12rX1EFrCGb2uPf \u2014 are referenced in a now-archived blog post from cybersecurity firm HYAS, in which the firm indicates the Russian SVR utilized the addresses to purchase infrastructure used in the infamous Solarwinds hack.\n\nThe third address appears to have been used as part of a Russian disinformation campaign. In the leadup to the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, Russia\u2019s GRU covertly set up the website DCLeaks.com, and used it to publish hacked materials relating to U.S. political figures. The DOJ indictment against Russian intelligence officers involved in the disinformation campaign states that agents paid in Bitcoin to lease the DCLeaks.com server from a Malaysian web hosting provider. The address used to lease that server \u2014 18N9jzCDsV9ekiLW8jJSA1rXDXw1Yx4hDh \u2014 was also tagged by our OP_RETURN vigilante as belonging to the GRU.\n\nThe fact that the OP_RETURN messages appear to have been accurate for three of the addresses lends credibility to the claims against the others as well.\n\nWe should also note how much money the OP_RETURN sender gave up to spread these messages. An OP_RETURN is in essence an invalid transaction output, and effectively burns any Bitcoin sent to that output. If one wanted to simply send a message to another person via OP_RETURN, it wouldn\u2019t make sense to include anything more than a dust-sized amount of Bitcoin, since those funds will be rendered inaccessible. However, our OP_RETURN sender included substantial sums in most of these transactions, burning over $300,000 worth of Bitcoin in total. Our hypothesis is that the OP_RETURN sender did this to make the discovery of the transactions, and the accusations associated with them, more likely. The fact that the OP_RETURN sender was both willing and able to burn hundreds of thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of Bitcoin in order to spread their message makes the information potentially more credible. Further, we should emphasize that the OP_RETURN sender stopped burning funds after the Russian invasion was underway. It was at this point that they instead began sending funds to Ukrainian aid addresses, suggesting relatively pure intentions and clarifying their support of the Ukrainian cause.\n\nHow does Bitcoin fit into the future of cyber warfare?\n\nIt turns out that a public, permanent, immutable ledger isn\u2019t just a strong foundation for a new, transparent financial system. It may also have a role in the future of cyber warfare. Assuming their messages are true, the OP_RETURN sender did something very powerful when they encoded their accusations onto the blockchain. Besides the fact that the Russian government has lost access to those Bitcoin thanks to the OP_RETURN function, it will now be very difficult for Russian agencies to use those addresses for similar purposes in the future, or to fund new addresses with Bitcoin currently held by the accused addresses. The possibility that the OP_RETURN sender acquired private keys for Russian-controlled addresses also suggests that the Putin regime\u2019s crypto operations aren\u2019t secure.\n\nMost importantly, those OP_RETURN messages will be there forever \u2014 no government or corporation can take them down. The unique case of the OP_RETURN vigilante underlines how important it is for 21st century militaries and intelligence agencies to understand and utilize blockchain technology, while also compromising their enemies\u2019 ability to do so.\n\nThis material is for informational purposes only, and is not intended to provide legal, tax, financial, or investment advice.

        "content": "Print this page\n\nOne of the (many) times I have been heckled during a panel on crypto was when I argued that it shouldn\u2019t be thought of as money. The only reason to use it other than for speculation, I said, was to buy drugs on the internet. This was a preposterous idea, the heckler retorted; crypto is used for so much more than that.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts argue that it\u2019s wrong to claim that it enables crime because the technology itself is \u201cneutral\u201d so cannot be blamed for any illicit activity. But this simply isn\u2019t true: crypto was designed as a censorship-resistant payment mechanism that operates outside the traditional financial system and beyond the remit of regulators. Crypto transactions are not subjected to the same fraud detection, anti-money laundering or suspicious activity checks that traditional ones are. Operating outside the system is its very raison d\u2019\u00eatre. And one only has to look at how the crypto industry behaves to see that crime is not a bug; it\u2019s a feature.\n\nTake the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange Binance, for instance. In a lawsuit filed last month against the exchange, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission alleges that Binance\u2019s former chief compliance officer said of certain Binance customers: \u201cLike come on. They are here for crime.\u201d The exchange\u2019s money laundering reporting officer, according to the CFTC, agreed: \u201cWe see the bad, but we close 2 eyes.\u201d\n\nIt would be funny if it weren\u2019t so flagrant. \u201cThese exchanges know exactly what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Stephen Diehl, co-author of Popping the Crypto Bubble, tells me. \u201cThey\u2019re basically creating a dark transnational payment network and, not surprisingly, that will be used by criminals. They\u2019re purpose-built for that.\u201d\n\nLast year was a turbulent year for crypto, with collapsing prices wiping about $1.5tn from the industry\u2019s \u201cmarket cap\u201d and with several high-profile businesses imploding. But despite the market downturn, it was also a record year for crypto-based crime: illicit crypto transactions topped $20bn in 2022, according to data analytics firm Chainalysis, up from $18bn the previous year, after a huge increase in transactions involving companies targeted by US sanctions (the majority coming from Russian-based exchange Garantex). Ransomware attacks were down a little on the year, but still accounted for almost half a billion dollars.\n\nNot only is that figure a \u201clower-bound estimate\u201d \u2014 the number is very likely to grow over time as the company identifies new crypto wallet addresses associated with unlawful activity \u2014 but it also only includes \u201con-chain\u201d activity, meaning only transactions that are recorded on the blockchain. It wouldn\u2019t include, therefore, the \u201cmassive fraud\u201d that allegedly took place at crypto exchange FTX, nor the proceeds of drug trafficking in which crypto has been used as the means of payment.\n\nNor does the figure include $23.8bn worth of money laundered via crypto in 2022 \u2014 a 68 per cent increase on the previous 12 months. In the UK alone, the National Crime Agency estimates that over $1bn of illicit cash is transferred overseas using crypto each year.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that crypto is used as part of the money-laundering methodology now \u2014 it\u2019s integrated into it,\u201d says Adrian Searle, director of the National Economic Crime Centre. Searle says that while the proportion of money laundering done in crypto is still relatively low, it is expected to increase rapidly, and is facilitating international criminal networks on an unprecedented scale.\n\nCrypto backers like to argue that crypto can be used for good, too. This is true enough \u2014 Blockchain data analytics company Elliptic told the FT this month that $200mn in crypto has been donated to pro-Ukraine causes since the war broke out, with more than $80mn of that sent directly to the Ukrainian government.\n\nBut that has to be put in context: the positives will always be outweighed by the negatives. Of the estimated $3.8bn worth of crypto that was stolen by hackers last year \u2014 another new record \u2014 some $1.7bn was stolen by North Korea-linked hackers, according to Chainalysis. This money is channelled, the UN claims, into the country\u2019s ballistic missile programme.\n\nOn the Dark Web \u2014 which is \u201cpredicated on the use of cryptocurrency\u201d, according to DCI Phil McInerney, who leads on cyber crime at the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council \u2014 crypto is used not just to buy and sell illegal substances, but 3D-printed firearms, compromised banking credentials, forged documents and child sexual abuse materials.\n\nSo in a funny way, my heckler was right: crypto isn\u2019t just used for speculating on and buying drugs on the internet: it\u2019s used for much murkier criminal activities, too.\n\njemima.kelly@ft.com\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nCryptocurrency critique can do with more context / From Daniel Aronoff, Research Scientist, MIT Cambridge, MA, US"

Discover SCENE\n\nThe Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund (BLDF), a non-profit co-founded by Block (formerly Square) CEO Jack Dorsey, announced Wednesday that it is supporting the legal defense for a number of Bitcoin Core developers targeted by a lawsuit filed by Craig Wright and his firm, Tulip Trading.\n\n\u201cThe Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund has stepped up to fight for more than just Bitcoin\u2014we are here to defend the right to build free, open-source software without fear,\u201d Jessica Jonas, Chief Legal Officer at the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund, told Decrypt.\n\nThe announcement comes on the same day the Bitcoin Core developers filed their substantive defense in a UK court.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe lawsuit, \u201cTulip Trading Limited v. Bitcoin Association For BSV & Others,\u201d Jonas says, stems from an alleged hack in 2020 that resulted in the loss of 111,000 Bitcoin that Wright claimed to own.\n\nAlthough BLDF calls the claims frivolous, Jonas says the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund is backing 13 Bitcoin developers in two separate cases initiated by Wright or his associated companies and is calling the cases attacks on fundamental principles of freedom.\n\n\u201cWe need to take them seriously and defend them fervently because the potential stakes are too high to ignore,\u201d Jonas said.\n\nAt issue in the case, Jonas says, is whether Bitcoin developers have a fiduciary duty to Bitcoin users.\n\n\u201cWright is arguing that they owe a fiduciary duty, and as such, they should be obligated to create a \u2018backdoor\u2019 to allow him to access coins he claims to have lost,\u201d she said, adding that it would compromise Bitcoin\u2019s core feature as a fully distributed open-source software to do so, since by design no individual or group can retroactively alter the blockchain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe group hopes to rally public support against this and future legal attacks by Wright.\n\n\u201cBy rallying the public and demonstrating widespread support for the defendants, we aim to show Wright and his team that their legal tactics will not go unchallenged,\u201d Jonas said.\n\nSince 2016, the controversial Australian computer scientist has launched several lawsuits, including accusing sites posting the Bitcoin whitepaper of copyright infringement after claiming to be the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. Earlier this month, Wright hinted that Apple might be violating copyright law when it was discovered that a copy of the Bitcoin whitepaper had been hidden on Apple\u2019s computers since at least 2018.\n\nThe Bitcoin Association for BSV has not yet responded to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment."

        "content": "A few weeks ago, users discovered that every copy of macOS has the original Bitcoin whitepaper hidden in its internal files. Apple never discussed the reason for this, although we believe that the existence of the file there was just a joke among Apple engineers. Now the file is gone with the latest version of macOS Ventura beta.\n\nmacOS has a copy of the Bitcoin whitepaper, but Apple is now removing it\n\nFollowing the release of macOS Ventura 13.4 beta 3 to developers on Tuesday, 9to5Mac has found that Apple has removed the Bitcoin whitepaper that was hidden in the system files. More specifically, the file was located in a folder within the Image Capture app along with other random assets, such as other PDF files and images.\n\nThese assets were part of an internal tool called \u201cVirtualScanner.app\u201d that let Apple engineers simulate the process of scanning and exporting documents and images with the Image Capture app without actually needing a scanner. In fact, the entire internal tool has been removed from the beta.\n\nThis pretty much confirms our original theory that both the Bitcoin whitepaper and the internal tool were never meant to be found by regular users. The most likely explanation is that the engineers previously did not bother to remove this tool from the public release of macOS since it didn\u2019t include any sensitive information.\n\nThe Bitcoin whitepaper seems to have been added to the system with macOS Mojave in 2018. If you haven\u2019t updated your Mac to the latest beta yet, you can still find the file by running the following command in Terminal:\n\nopen /System/Library/Image\\ Capture/Devices/VirtualScanner.app/Contents/Resources/simpledoc.pdf\n\nGiven the repercussions that the original news story had, it\u2019s no surprise that Apple ended up removing the file from the system."

        "content": "In today\u2019s Market Report episode, analyst and writer Marcel Pechman covers the potential triggers to move Bitcoin\u2019s price away from $27,000, including the United State Federal Reserve meeting on May 3. The show airs every Tuesday on the Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel.\n\nThe first news article discussed the catalysts for Bitcoin\u2019s next move, including whether the Fed will follow the markets\u2019 consensus of a 25-basis-point interest rate increase on May 3. The video analyzes how Bitcoin (BTC) should react to the central bank\u2019s decision and explains how interest rates affect families and businesses.\n\nIn Pechman\u2019s opinion, the correlation between Bitcoin and the stock market should decline considering the U.S. is nearing its debt limit and the economy is displaying signs of weakness and recession. Pechman does not believe there\u2019s a rationale for Bitcoin trading at $25,000, as some analysts have suggested.\n\nOn to the show\u2019s next topic, Pechman discusses Coinbase\u2019s court action against the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cCoinbase is looking to force the SEC to respond to its petition seeking rules for the crypto industry\u2026 asking the SEC to provide clarification about how it goes about classifying tokens as securities.\u201d\n\nAccording to Pechman, it seems like the tables have turned, as the regulator has been postponing its ruling and harassing exchanges without ever giving some direction on what sets the bar for tokens to become securities. The conclusion? This case can have a bigger impact than previously imagined because judges will take note of the SEC\u2019s arguments.\n\nIn the last part of The Market Report, Pechman argues that Ether (ETH) is in a bad place due to average transaction fees above $4. Consequently, the total value locked (TVL) in Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts in Ether terms plunged to their lowest levels since August 2020.\n\nAt the end of the show, Pechman focuses on Ether\u2019s derivatives markets, more specifically the put-to-call options volume. Currently, the protective put options outnumber the neutral-to-bullish call options by more than four times. Judging by pro traders\u2019 bearish view, Ether\u2019s price will unlikely be able to sustain the $1,850 support.\n\nThe Market Report airs every Tuesday, so be sure to head on over to the Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube page and smash those Like and Subscribe buttons for all our future videos and updates."

        "title": "Is the Bitcoin Bear Market Over? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The woes of 2022 that plagued Bitcoin (BTC -0.31%) look to have been forgotten as the leading cryptocurrency has climbed more than 65% since the beginning of the new year. Thanks to this rally, optimists are hopeful that this renewed momentum might be enough to officially call for an end to the bear market that saw Bitcoin lose nearly 70% of its value.\n\nTo truly evaluate whether Bitcoin has put the latest crypto winter in the rearview mirror, investors need to look at some metrics other than just its price to accurately gauge the likelihood of a bull market on the horizon.\n\nWhile the purpose of Bitcoin as an investment remains ambiguous, likely due to the variety of roles it is able to play, at its core it is a decentralized payment network. Therefore, by measuring activity on the network in the form of user addresses and transactions, investors can get a glimpse into the health of Bitcoin today relative to other bear and bull market cycles.\n\nWhat the network says\n\nTo start, let's look at addresses. Rather than the total number of addresses, which is constantly growing, the rate at which new addresses are joining the network can be more telling.\n\nAfter reaching some of its lowest levels since early 2020, there has been a resurgence in the number of new addresses doing transactions on the network. During the past quarter, an average of more than 13.5 million new addresses joined the blockchain per month, according to Glassnode, a crypto research and data firm. The last time levels were this high was back in the first quarter of 2021 when Bitcoin went on a run that ended up with it just shy of $63,000. In fact, this March registered the largest increase of addresses since April 2021 with a whopping 14.4 million new users.\n\nWith a near record amount of new addresses using the network, it would be plausible to assume that transactions are also at cycle highs -- and that assumption would be correct.\n\nIn Q1 of this year, Bitcoin averaged just shy of 9 million transactions per month as demand for the cryptocurrency soared. Similar to the rate of new address growth, you would have to go back to Q1 2021 when Bitcoin was comfortably in the midst of a bull market to find transactions at these levels.\n\nNot quite there yet\n\nWith address growth and an increase in transactions, Bitcoin has seen its price rise considerably since the beginning of 2023. From January to March, Bitcoin rallied 72%. Following the recurring theme of address growth and transaction counts, this was its best performance over a quarterly period since Q1 2021, when it skyrocketed 103%.\n\nWhen taking into consideration the combination of all these metrics, it might be enough to call for the end of Bitcoin's bear market blues. However, optimism for a bull market like that of 2021 to return this year might be misconstrued.\n\nRather, it seems Bitcoin is currently in no-man's land straddling the edges of the past bear market and its potential next leg up in a coming bull market. But while it remains in this territory, the world's most valuable cryptocurrency still looks to be a bargain. Considering that it remains more than 50% below its all time high and yet crucial metrics are near levels last seen when Bitcoin's price was worth more than $60,000, buying the cryptocurrency today could prove to be lucrative should a bull market return."

        "content": "With a growing list of crypto lending platforms, you can not only take a loan out on your crypto holdings, but you can use on-chain credit to apply for a loan. But is it a good idea? The industry is rife with instances where platforms shut down and depositors lost access to their accounts.\n\nDespite the reputation of bad apples, opportunities abound for both borrowers and lenders. Crypto loans can be a good alternative to traditional forms of credit. But to learn from the mistakes of the past, we need to highlight important considerations.\n\nWhat is a crypto loan?\n\nA crypto loan is a type of loan that requires you to pledge your cryptocurrency as collateral to the lender in return for immediate cash. Many platforms offer these loans in stablecoins, other cryptocurrencies or fiat currency. And for credit based crypto lenders, they use a variety of on-chain and off-chain credit to secure loans for customers.\n\nHow to find the best crypto loan platforms for you\n\nFirst, you will want to compare the technical, counterparty and liquidity risks of each platform. They look fundamentally different between centralized, decentralized and credit based crypto loan issuers.\n\nTechnical risks range from data center security breaches, protocol and pricing oracle failures, and smart contract hacks. Counterparty risk refers to the possibility that borrowers may default on their loan repayment. Traditional lending minimizes this risk through credit checks and thorough applicant assessments. In crypto lending, this is often mitigated through over-collateralization. Decentralized credit based crypto lending platforms use centralized authorities, collective review and on-chain credit to make assessments. They use various ways to decentralize the approval and funding process, but none of them are default proof. Liquidity risk in crypto lending refers to the potential failure of a platform\u2019s reserve or liquidity pool to satisfy market demand. Because the industry lacks universal auditing standards, proof-of-reserves and FDIC insurance, platforms run greater risks of market contagion and liquidity failures. All platforms differ in how they mitigate these risks. DeFi lenders rely on algorithms to keep their automated market making protocols liquid and CeFi lenders use traditional accounting and proof-of-reserves.\n\nSecondly, the way platforms address these risks all impact the cost to the borrower. So you will also want to compare collateral requirements, loan-to-value ratios and interest rates of different platforms.\n\nThis article narrows the best crypto loans to the most reputable and longest-serving products. It forms part of the Blockworks series on Crypto Loans, which contains helpful information on how crypto loans work, the benefits and the risks.\n\nRead more: The Best Bitcoin Loans of 2023\n\nTop centralized crypto lending platforms\n\nPros Cons \u2013 Flexible repayment plans\n\n\u2013 Support for various crypto assets\n\n\u2013 User-friendly interface Fiat on-ramp and off-ramp\n\n\u2013 Exchange platform for swapping cryptocurrencies Prompt customer support via LiveChat and email\n\n\u2013 Proof-of-reserve auditing \u2013 The token-tied loyalty model makes navigating special offers confusing\n\n\u2013 Certain assets are only available for buying and not depositing to Nexo accounts\n\n\u2013 Nexo\u2019s Yield products increase counterparty risk\n\n\u2013 Not available to US customers\n\nUSP: Credit line offered at 0% APR\n\nType: CeFi, Multi-coin\n\nLaunched in 2018, Nexo is a centralized crypto lending platform and one of the oldest-serving providers of such services. Nexo users instantly receive a credit line when they deposit crypto on the platform and can borrow either stablecoins or supported fiat currencies. The platform requires users to over-collateralize their loan positions and provides a clear liquidation threshold and flexible repayment options.\n\nNexo uses a loyalty tier system to calculate interest rates. They offer 6.9% to their highest rated tier and 0% if their LTV is below or equal to 20%. So if you posted $10,000 in BTC as collateral, you could use a credit line of approximately $2,000 at 0% APR.\n\nNexo users climb tiers by increasing the ratio of NEXO tokens to the rest of their portfolio. But price volatility can make it difficult to monitor this ratio and cause unsuspecting users to pay greater fees.\n\nUsers can also earn up to 12% APR from staking stablecoins and NEXO and up to 15% in high interest savings accounts. These interest rates vary depending on the amount deposited and the tier of your account.\n\nThe platform also lists a wide range of assets and enables users to add collateral to their accounts anytime during the loan duration. Nexo stores its funds with institutional-grade custodian BitGo and provides real-time proof-of-reserve attestation from an independent auditor to verify that it has sufficient backing for all deposited user assets.\n\nPros Cons \u2013 High 364% APR interest on Dual Asset Product\n\nSupport for various crypto assets\n\n\u2013 User-friendly interface Fiat on-ramp and off-ramp\n\n\u2013 Exchange platform for swapping cryptocurrencies Highest LTV is 90% \u2013 Interest savings accounts lower than competitors\n\n\u2013 Not available to US customers\n\n\u2013 Company experienced a data breach in 2019\n\n\u2013 No proof-of-reserves Higher interest rates on stablecoin loans\n\nUSP: 364% APR yield on Dual Asset Product\n\nType: CeFi, Multi-coin.\n\nYouHolder, a cryptocurrency lending platform, was created in 2018. They offer crypto loans with 90%, 70% and 50% LTV ratios with different interest rate fees, load durations and price down limits. They have a rather high interest rate on loans made out in stablecoins. They charge about 26.07% APR for loans made in USDT and USDC but 0% on loans in BTC and ETH.\n\nThe company also offers a new yield generating option called Dual Asset Product. It offers up to 364% APR in 1-5 day increments. The product is similar to yield farming AMM liquidity pools in that users add liquidity to a stablecoin/cryptocurrency pair of their choice.\n\nBut instead of depositing both assets, they choose one. The platform only makes the payout in stablecoins if the price of the cryptocurrency is above the starting price.\n\nFor example, say you deposited 1 BTC to the BTC USDT pair for 1 day at a 364% APR. If the price went up by .5%, you would get the deposited amount back in USDT + 1% in interest. But if the price dropped .5%, you would get the deposited amount back in BTC + 1% interest. Users can still lose money through this yield bearing product if they sell their crypto payouts at a loss.\n\nBankrupt CeFi platforms (the worst options of 2022)\n\nThe crypto bear market made 2022 a rough year for centralized crypto lending platforms. Market contagion spread from Terra/Luna\u2019s collapse leaving a series of platforms in its wake. Here is a list of some of the crypto lenders that filed for bankruptcy in 2022.\n\nCelsius\n\nCelsius was one of the most aggressive CeFi lending platforms \u2013 offering customers up to 17% annual interest. The crypto loan issuer froze withdrawals in June 2022, just a month after the Terra/Luna implosion. They cited \u201cextreme market conditions\u201d as the reason why. And in July, the company filed for bankruptcy. Celsius had over 1.7 millions users. But in March 2022, Justice Martin Glenn ruled that these users can get up to 72% of their deposited funds back.\n\nVoyager\n\nVoyager, the crypto exchange and lending platform froze withdrawals and declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy following the collapse of crypto hedge fund 3AC in June 2022. They disclosed over $500 million in exposure to the failed fund. Customers also hope to recover 72% of their lost funds once the bankruptcy is complete.\n\nVauld\n\nVauld, a crypto lending program based in Singapore, froze customer accounts and filed for protection from its creditors on July 4th 2022. At the time of filing, they owed $402 million to creditors. And while 90% of that debt is in customer deposits, no plans to reimburse depositors have been announced. Instead, the Peter Thiel-backed company has twice extended the creditor protection period as they continue to restructure. It is set to expire on April 28, 2023.\n\nBable Finance\n\nBable Finance, a Hong Kong crypto lending platform that served crypto mining companies, institutions and high net worth borrowers froze all customer accounts on June 17, 2022. They did this just days after Celcius\u2019 announcement and cited the same market volatility as why. A few days later on June 20, they entered into talks with counterparties on debt reconstruction. But on March 6, 2023 they filed for moratorium protection from creditors to launch a new DeFi platform and stablecoin with a similar collateral design to algorithmic stablecoins. They plan to use this scheme to pay their $766 million debt to creditors.\n\nBlockFi\n\nOn Nov. 28, 2022, BlockFi declared bankruptcy. Three weeks prior, the crypto lending platform froze customer withdrawals citing a \u201clack of clarity\u201d into the line of credit promised by FTX. But in December, BlockFi worked with the bankruptcy court to implement a plan to return deposited funds back to its customers. This move is different from Voyager and Celsius because it means that customers could retrieve their funds before bankruptcy hearings are over.\n\nThese CeFi lenders all fell victim to leverage and over exposure to risk. But in the 2021 run up, many felt the pressure to offer more aggressive yields to compete. And for a brief time, customers were able to make 17% to 20% from savings held on these lending platforms. The takeaway was that if the product seemed too good to be true, then you were likely the product. These lenders wanted customers at all costs to finance their unsustainable scheme.\n\nWhile news of CeFi lender bankruptcies have died down, there is always the potential risk for more. Extra caution may be prudent when choosing lenders that offer unrealistic yields.\n\nTop decentralized crypto loan platforms\n\nPros Cons \u2013 Non-custodial cryptocurrency lending with on-chain transparency\n\n\u2013 Aave supports a wide variety of crypto assetsUsers can earn through incentives while borrowing\n\n\u2013 Aave offers a permissioned protocol ideal for high-profile and institutional investors \u2013 Users take on considerable token risk as most pool assets are correlated\n\n\u2013 The protocol\u2019s decentralized nature means users must proactively manage their positions to avoid liquidation\n\n\u2013 Aave\u2019s interface may be a little complicated for first-time users\n\n\u2013 Aave offers yield-generating products, which increases counterparty risk\n\nUSP: Decentralized crypto lending platform\n\nType: DeFi, Multi-coin\n\nAave is a DeFi protocol allowing investors to borrow against crypto. The protocol initially launched on the Ethereum network but has since expanded to 15 other ecosystems, including Polygon, Avalanche and Optimism.\n\nAave facilitates crypto loans by providing lending pools where users can deposit assets to earn interest. Borrowers can, in turn, tap into these pools by depositing crypto as collateral to borrow stablecoins or other assets available on the pool.\n\nDepending on the assets, Users can borrow up to 35% to 80% of the value of deposited collateral and choose between a fixed or variable interest rate. Aave protocol liquidates a position if the collateral value drops below a specified threshold and the user fails to deposit more collateral upon margin calls.\n\nPros Cons \u2013 Non-custodial cryptocurrency lending with on-chain transparency\n\n\u2013 Compound offers a relatively user-friendly interface\n\n\u2013 Compound offers reasonably competitive interest rates\n\n\u2013 Compound provides additional tools such as advanced transactions and position migrator to help lower network fees \u2013 Supports fewer assets than other DeFi protocols\n\n\u2013 Users face smart contract risks as is the case with all DeFi protocols\n\n\u2013 The use of COMP tokens to incentivize borrowing introduces further risks in addition to the danger of using highly-volatile assets as collateral\n\n\u2013 Being deployed only on Ethereum means users incur high network fees\n\nUSP: Non-custodial cryptocurrency lending platform with on-chain transparency\n\nType: DeFi, Multi-coin\n\nCompound is a DeFi protocol built on the Ethereum network. Users can deposit crypto to earn interest or use it as collateral to borrow from Compound\u2019s liquidity pools. Compound supports major Ethereum-based assets, including wrapped bitcoin (WBTC), ether (ETH), compound (COMP), chainlink (LINK), uniswap (UNI), and staked ETH tokens. Users can draw out loans in these assets or use the USDC stablecoin.\n\nUsers automatically receive a credit line on Compound based on the value of deposited assets. The dashboard presents an overview of the health of a user\u2019s loan position and the maximum LTV on each asset. Like most DeFi protocols, users must regularly check their position to avoid liquidation.\n\nPros Cons \u2013 Users can access competitive interest rates from different pools\n\n\u2013 The platform provides a user-friendly interface for managing crypto loans\n\n\u2013 The platform supports borrowing stablecoins with ETH, providing relative security against market drawdowns\n\n\u2013 The platform is transparent about its fees, including a rebalancing fee to guarantee the best rates \u2013 Fuji supports fewer assets compared to other protocols\n\n\u2013 Fuji\u2019s planned cross-chain infrastructure may introduce a greater security risk\n\nUSP: DeFi aggregator for users to to find crypto loans at the best interest rates\n\nType: DeFi, Multi-coin\n\nFuji Finance is a DeFi aggregator for users to access crypto loans at the best interest rates from different protocols. Fuji analyzes multiple lending pools and uses its routing contracts to let users access these offers from a single platform.\n\nUsers can view their open loan positions, health factor, and liquidation price on their account dashboard. Fuji features a refinancing feature that automatically optimizes loan positions when a competing protocol offers improved rates. There are no repayment schedules, although users must maintain a healthy LTV to sustain their loan position.\n\nIn addition to Ethereum, Fuji is live on Polygon, Arbitrum and Fantom. The platform also plans to introduce cross-chain collateralization, enabling users to access liquidity using collateral deposited on a different chain.\n\nCrypto lending platforms offering loans with no collateral\n\nPros Cons \u2013 Provides borrowers access to credit who are outside of traditional banking\n\n\u2013 No over-collateralization\n\n\u2013 Lower interest rates: Goldfinch aims to provide more affordable credit by cutting out intermediaries and using a unique credit scoring system\n\n\u2013 Decentralized: Since Goldfinch is built on the Ethereum blockchain and managed by a DAO \u2013 offering greater transparency into governance and risk \u2013 Crypto price volatility: Since the value of crypto assets can be volatile, borrowers may face the risk of having their collateral liquidated if the value of their crypto assets drops significantly\n\n\u2013 Risk of default: There is always the risk that borrowers may default on their loans, which could result in a loss of principal for lenders\n\n\u2013 Limited liquidity: Lenders may not be able to withdraw their funds immediately, as the length of loan terms on Goldfinch may be longer than other investment options\n\nUSP: Credit based crypto loans with no over-collateralization\n\nType: DeFi, Multi-coin\n\nGoldfinch is a decentralized credit based crypto lending protocol on the Ethereum blockchain. According to their website, this protocol is governed through a community DAO \u2013 meaning that all changes to protocol configurations and parameters are voted on by governance token holders.\n\nTheir core mission is to provide credit to underserved communities around the world. They argue that the over-collateralization of most other crypto lenders limits the scope and purpose of crypto loans. And as result, most of it is used to leverage investments within the ecosystem. They see untapped opportunity in using the borderless limitations of cryptocurrency and smart contract platforms to offer credit based loans for real world use cases.\n\nRead more: What Are Real-world Assets? DeFi\u2019s Newest Yield\n\nIn credit-based lending, borrowers are evaluated based on their creditworthiness, which is determined by factors such as their credit history, income, and other financial indicators. Since Goldfinch is a protocol governed by a DAO, they don\u2019t directly run credit checks and require loan applications like traditional institutions. Instead they use a system that evaluates creditworthiness through the collective assessment of other participants.\n\nBitcoin only CeFi lenders\n\nPros Cons \u2013 Proof-of-reserves attestation\n\n\u2013 Transparent fees\n\n\u2013 Repayments available through bank transfer or stablecoins\n\n\u2013 Customer support available through email and LiveChat \u2013 Charges a 2% admin fee\n\n\u2013 The minimum collateral requirement makes the platform unfriendly to small borrowers\n\n\u2013 Ledn also offers investors a savings/yield product, creating rehypothecation risks\n\nUSP: Simple and easy-to-use platform for accessing Bitcoin-backed loans\n\nType: CeFi, Bitcoin only\n\nFounded in 2018, Canada-based Ledn is another crypto loan platform with a relatively impeccable record. Ledn employs BitGo as its official digital asset custodian. The platform primarily offers interest-yield products for bitcoin and USDC holders. Ledn users can borrow against BTC at a 9.9% annual interest rate plus a 2% admin fee.\n\nLedn requires users to deposit at least $1,000 worth of bitcoin collateral, with the option to borrow up to 50% of the deposit amount. The platform issues loans within 24 hours of a user\u2019s request and requires no repayment schedule as long as the user maintains a healthy LTV.\n\nPros Cons \u2013 Transparent fees and charges\n\n\u2013 Users can verify via a multi-signature contract that deposited assets are not rehypothecated\n\n\u2013 Only interest payments are required monthlyLive customer support \u2013 The application process is manual, and approval may take up to a week\n\n\u2013 Origination fees and relatively high-interest rates\n\n\u2013 Unchained Capital\u2019s 40% LTV means access to less capital compared to other crypto loan providers\n\nUSP: Bitcoin-backed loans offering a multisig self custody solution\n\nType: CeFi, bitcoin only\n\nBitcoin-focused financial services firm Unchained Capital offers a facility to borrow cash against BTC. Interested borrowers can complete an online application with Unchained Capital and receive a loan quotation. The platform requires a minimum collateral amount of $10,000, with users only able to borrow up to 40% of the deposited asset.\n\nIf approved, the borrower transfers the bitcoins to a designated address and receives the stablecoin collateral on their account. Unchained Capital requires monthly interest payments on its bitcoin loans. Users can choose to spread interest payments across 6 or 12 monthly payments, with the principal repayment only required at the end of the loan duration.\n\nGet the most out of crypto loans\n\nBitcoin and crypto loans are inherently risky because of the volatile nature of the underlying assets. However, investors can make the most of such loans by choosing platforms offering the highest security level for client assets.\n\nAt the most basic level, users should be able to verify that all deposited assets are fully backed and not subject to any form of rehypothecation. Platforms that offer low-interest rates on borrows typically have greater risks of reusing user collateral to earn a yield and subsidize fees for borrowers. Having a yield product also increases the chances of the platform needing to rehypothecate users\u2019 funds to meet up with promised interest rates for depositors.\n\nMeanwhile, it is essential that customers have multiple options to deposit more collateral if their loan position is at risk of liquidation. All loan terms, including interest rates and associated fees, must be transparently agreed upon by both parties before the loan issuance.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Cryptocurrency Ethereum has slashed its energy use by 99.99 per cent - New Scientist",
        "content": "An experimental update to Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-biggest cryptocurrency, has led to a dramatic reduction in the energy used to secure the currency and verify transactions\n\nEthereum is the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency SKapl/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nThe world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, has successfully slashed its emissions by 99.99 per cent after an unprecedented experiment to ditch power-hungry mining in favour of a new approach, according to researchers. But experts say there is little appetite for such a change among users of bitcoin, the largest digital currency, which has no central body to steer development.\n\nLike bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum used to rely on \u201cproof of work\u201d to secure its network, meaning that computers performed huge numbers of calculations to \u201cmine\u201d new currency and verify transactions. This process uses vast amounts of electricity. But in September 2022, Ethereum switched to a new technique called \u201cproof of stake\u201d during a period of change known as the Merge.\n\nThe Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF) has published comprehensive data on bitcoin\u2019s energy use over the past four years and has now released similar data for Ethereum. Alexander Neum\u00fcller at the University of Cambridge, who worked on the project, says the experimental update has been a technological success, achieving a \u201cstaggering\u201d reduction in electricity consumption.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnder the new system, instead of using computer hardware to mine new currency to get a reward, validators lodge money with the network to gain the right to validate transactions and be rewarded. Before the Merge took place, the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organisation that oversees the development of Ethereum, estimated that this would cut energy use by 99 per cent, but the results of the switch were unpredictable, as nothing on the same scale had been attempted before.\n\nEthereum had, like bitcoin, been using more energy each year since its launch in 2015. According to CCAF\u2019s data, it used 16.4 terrawatt hours in 2021. By 14 September 2022 \u2013 the day before the Merge \u2013 it had already used 17.6TWh, and was on course to end the year at 21.4TWh.\n\nThe CCAF now estimates that Ethereum will consume just 6.6 gigawatt hours of electricity annually, equivalent to about 2000 typical homes in the UK. In contrast, Ethereum\u2019s previous consumption from its launch to the Merge totalled 58.3 TWh \u2013 comparable to Switzerland\u2019s annual electricity consumption.\n\nSign up to our The Daily newsletter The latest science news delivered to your inbox, every day. Sign up to newsletter\n\nNeum\u00fcller says success was far from guaranteed due to the scale of the challenge. \u201cAn often-used anecdote in that regard was changing a jet engine during flight,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has been executed very well. No one knew exactly what was going to happen.\u201d\n\nSome analysis has suggested that although Ethereum\u2019s power consumption has dropped, the hardware that used to account for it is now being used for other purposes. Kyle McDonald, who carried out his own research on the energy use of the Ethereum network before the Merge, says large numbers of disgruntled miners who were left with hugely expensive, specialised hardware and no source of income decided to continue harvesting other coins.\n\nBut Neum\u00fcller says not all miners switched and there is evidence that many sold off their hardware. His research looked at the other cryptocurrencies that miners could have profitably switched to and calculated that, between 8 September 2022 and 4 March 2023, nearly 80 per cent of the computational power used for mining had simply disappeared, as miners gave up and sold their hardware.\n\nDespite the success of Ethereum\u2019s switch, Neum\u00fcller says that the bitcoin network is too attached to its current proof-of-work approach to follow suit.\n\nEthan Vera, co-founder of cryptocurrency firm Luxor Mining, also believes that a similar change in bitcoin is unlikely. \u201cProof of work is fundamental to bitcoin. The use of energy is critical to its security mechanism,\u201d he says."

This centered around First Republic Bank, which revealed a $100-billion reduction in deposits this week.\n\nThe U.S. government was reportedly uninterested in intervening on the day, according to a source cited by CNBC, as the bank\u2019s stock, FRC, opened down another 22% before being halted for volatility.

        "content": "A widely followed crypto strategist says that Bitcoin (BTC) is likely setting the stage for a steep rally in the coming months as the crypto king shadows a parabolic rally witnessed nearly a decade ago.\n\nPseudonymous analyst TechDev tells his 409,100 Twitter followers that multiple technical indicators suggest that Bitcoin could be mimicking its 2015 bull market, a cycle that saw BTC rally from less than $200 to $20,000 in about two years.\n\nThe crypto analyst shares two charts that show how BTC has been following the 2015 cycle over the last year and a half.\n\n\u201cEarly stage of a Bitcoin parabola, following a 1.5-year correction.\u201d\n\nLooking at TechDev\u2019s charts, it appears that BTC has taken out a diagonal resistance that kept Bitcoin bearish in 2022 and retested it as support, which is strikingly similar to the leading digital asset\u2019s price action in 2014 and early 2015.\n\nThe analyst\u2019s charts also show similarities in the movements of two technical indicators: the relative strength index (RSI), which is a momentum indicator, and the moving average convergence divergence (MACD), a trend-following indicator.\n\nAccording to the charts, Bitcoin\u2019s weekly RSI has recently broken out of the bullish 60 zone after flashing a bullish divergence, reminiscent of its movement about eight years ago.\n\nMeanwhile, the MACD is flashing a bullish cross on BTC\u2019s weekly chart, which is another signal witnessed in the early stages of the 2015 bull market.\n\nTechDev is not the only analyst who believes that BTC could print exponential gains in the coming months. Pseudonymous analyst Credible thinks that BTC could hit $130,000 before the end of the year.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin and ether. We\u2019ve also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this article began. According to Wikipedia, a cryptocurrency is \u201ca digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.\u201d\n\nBitcoin was the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Ether is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three with its launch in July 2015.\n\nThe third-largest market share of cryptocurrency, tether, is a token \u201cbacked by actual assets\u201d which includes one US dollar, one euro, or loans to affiliate companies and is controlled by the owners of Bitfinex. It\u2019s a controversial cryptocurrency due to its alleged manipulation of crypto pricing. It is called a \u201cstable coin\u201d because it was designed to always be worth $1.00. We do not chart it because its price rarely changes.\n\nXRP, which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We\u2019ve included it here for reference.\n\nThe Latest Data (through April 25, 2023)\n\nBitcoin (BTC) dropped back down this past week, hanging around $27K-$28K, after last week\u2019s 10-month high. Despite the decline, BTC is still up ~70% year-to-date.\n\nIn the last week, XRP fell below $0.50 for the first time since the end of March, however it is currently up ~38% year-to-date.\n\nEther (ETH) experienced its largest weekly decline this past week since the beginning of March. With that being said, ETH is still up ~55% year-to-date.\n\nI have also created an index in order to chart these together given their very different pricing history. Ether tops the chart \u2013 the price of an ether has changed the most out of all three cryptocurrencies.\n\nETFs associated with cryptocurrencies include: the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) and the ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITI).\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel.\n\nOriginally published on Advisor Perspectives."

        "title": "Evaluating how Bitcoin will be affected if the U.S. defaults on debt - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "This market analysis explains why Bitcoin might have a hard time securing liquidity.\n\nWhales and institutions demonstrated outflows as the market showed a bleak outlook.\n\nIt was observed that Bitcoin [BTC] and altcoins were on a slippery slope for the last few days. A consequence of wavering investor sentiment. But will things improve or is there more pain to come?\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nLet\u2019s shift gears a bit and assess the market from a different angle that has to do with Bitcoin\u2019s correlation with traditional finance. There is no doubt that the U.S. is one of the largest markets for crypto and it contributes substantially to the liquidity for Bitcoin and altcoins.\n\nThis is a double-edged sword because it also underscores some risks if the U.S. is to face a liquidity crunch.\n\nA 25 April assessment suggested that a Bitcoin liquidity crunch might just be in the cards if the U.S. defaults on its debt obligations.\n\nThe analysis by Twitter user under the pseudonym Tedtalksmacro looks into various factors behind the liquidity that fueled the YTD gains. He noted that the U.S. treasury started drawing down on cash reserves due as its debt ceiling narrowed.\n\n2/ The recent surge in global liquidity has been owed to: \u2013 US debt ceiling situation \u2013> Treasury drawing down on their cash reserves,\n\n\u2013 Banking crisis \u2013> Fed balance sheet expansion to backstop failing banks,\n\n\u2013 China restarting their economy post-COVID \u2013> stimulate with $$ pic.twitter.com/7NVjHeC8v6 \u2014 tedtalksmacro (@tedtalksmacro) April 25, 2023\n\nThe recent banking crisis also forced the U.S. Federal Reserve to pause quantitative tightening (QT), in favor of liquidity injections. While this outcome stimulated the bulls, it will likely be a temporary move once the FED has limited cash reserves to tap into.\n\nWill the liquidity taps run dry?\n\nTedtalksmacro\u2019s assessment highlighted the risk of a liquidity crunch if U.S. runs out of cash reserves. When that happens, the U.S. will have to raise its debt ceiling. This is to raise funds through debt instruments such as treasury bills.\n\nDoing so will lead to more quantitative tightening, which will in turn have a negative impact on higher-risk investments such as Bitcoin.\n\n2/ The recent surge in global liquidity has been owed to: \u2013 US debt ceiling situation \u2013> Treasury drawing down on their cash reserves,\n\n\u2013 Banking crisis \u2013> Fed balance sheet expansion to backstop failing banks,\n\n\u2013 China restarting their economy post-COVID \u2013> stimulate with $$ pic.twitter.com/7NVjHeC8v6 \u2014 tedtalksmacro (@tedtalksmacro) April 25, 2023\n\nThe above analysis may explain why the market is experiencing a slowdown in the level of liquidity coming into it. The analysis also noted that the FED may slow down the rate of QT, which may not necessarily lead to heavy outflows but a lot of sideways activity instead.\n\nHow many are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today\n\nSo, how are whales and institutions responding to this scenario? They contributed significant liquidity to BTC from the second week of March to mid-April. However, post-mid-April results indicated some liquidity outflows.\n\nThis analysis underscores a strong reason for investors to keep tabs on FED activity as it may offer insights into the next market move."

        "content": "Claims that bitcoin mining has 'zero carbon emissions' are false\n\nCopyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2024. All rights reserved.\n\nAn American bitcoin mining company claims creating the world's largest cryptocurrency produces no greenhouse gases. This is false; the process requires a significant amount of energy, experts say -- which can come from carbon-emitting sources such as natural gas or coal-fired power plants.\n\n\"Bitcoin mining has zero carbon emissions,\" says an April 10, 2023 tweet from Riot Platforms Inc.\n\nThe post includes a video of a man testing for emissions outside a bitcoin mining facility in Rockdale, Texas.\n\nScreenshot of a tweet taken April 21, 2023\n\nRiot published the clip in response to an April 9 New York Times article about the environmental cost of bitcoin mining in the US. The video accumulated more than 1.3 million views.\n\n\"We're here out in Rockdale, Texas,\" Pierre Rochard, vice president of research at Riot, says in the footage, displaying a device measuring carbon dioxide. \"We're going to go inside the mining facility and we're going to see how much is this number going to go up. If the number does not go up, then the mining rigs are not emitting any CO2.\"\n\nAfter checking readings outside and inside the facility, Rochard claims this data proves that bitcoin mining \"does not emit any CO2.\"\n\n\"I think the science is conclusive,\" he says.\n\nThe company also issued a press release (archived here) with a more detailed explanation.\n\n\"To be clear, our Bitcoin mining operations do not generate any greenhouse gas emissions, similar to any other data center for Facebook, Amazon or Google -- yet we have been singled out,\" the statement says. \"Our data center uses electricity from the Texas grid, which is the cleanest and most renewable energy-sourced grid in the United States.\"\n\nBut bitcoin mining does have a carbon footprint, experts told AFP. Centers creating the cryptocurrency require massive amounts of energy, not all of which is sustainable.\n\nWhat is bitcoin mining?\n\nThe only way to make bitcoin is by using a network of powerful computers to solve complex mathematical questions.\n\nThe first computer that solves the problem unlocks the next block of bitcoins that are released into circulation. Then the cycle starts over again as computers attempt to find the next block.\n\nMargot Paez, a climate adaptation fellow at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, compared the bitcoin mining process to a \"game\" or \"a puzzle.\"\n\n\"Each computer is like a lottery ticket,\" she said. \"That means if there are 100 computers on the network trying to win the game of getting the reward -- the bitcoin is the reward -- my one computer has, all things being equal, a 1/100 chance of winning.\"\n\nPower hungry\n\nBitcoin mining facilities have multiplied in the US since China halted the activity in 2021 -- and they consume a lot of energy.\n\nThe Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance estimates that the bitcoin network has an annual electricity consumption of 145 Terawatt hours (TWh).\n\n\"To put this into perspective, this level of energy consumption would place bitcoin among the top 30 energy-consuming nations globally,\" said Fengqi You, an energy systems engineering professor at Cornell University.\n\nThe White House issued a press release in September 2022 warning about the increased demand for cryptocurrency and its implications for US climate goals.\n\n\"The United States is estimated to host about a third of global crypto-asset operations, which currently consume about 0.9 percent to 1.7 percent of total US electricity usage,\" the statement says. \"This range of electricity usage is similar to all home computers or residential lighting in the United States.\"\n\nThe White House said that \"depending on the energy intensity of the technology and the sources of electricity used, the rapid growth of crypto-assets could potentially hinder broader efforts to achieve US climate commitments to reach net-zero carbon pollution.\"\n\nHigh footprint\n\nLena Klaassen, a doctoral researcher at ETH Zurich's Climate Finance and Policy Group, said Riot's claim \"is not correct as bitcoin miners are also relying on power sources from fossil fuels.\"\n\nIf the computers are powered by solar or wind, then the facility would \"be considered carbon-free,\" said You of Cornell. However, if a power plant burning fossil fuels is generating the energy, then he said \"we can't consider bitcoin mining free from any carbon emissions.\"\n\nThe Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute ranks Riot's operation as the fifth most carbon-intensive of all leading bitcoin mining companies. Riot also claims its Rockdale center is the \"largest bitcoin mining facility\" in the US.\n\nThe New York Times and WattTime, an environmental technology nonprofit, estimated the facility contributes 1.9 million tons of carbon emissions per year.\n\nRiot's mining site gets its energy from Texas's ERCOT grid, whose power sources in 2021 comprised 61 percent fossil fuels and 28 percent wind and solar, according to the state comptroller's office.\n\nWhile Texas is a leader in renewable energy production, the state still relies on fossil fuels and says they will remain \"a crucial part of the energy mix for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nA greener bitcoin mining process may become possible as the power grid gets more sustainable, according to Klaassen of ETH Zurich. But she warned that \"until then, consuming large amounts of electricity in a grid that does not fully run on renewable energy sources will be associated with causing emissions.\"\n\nAFP has fact-checked other claims about carbon emissions here, here and here."

        "title": "Explained | Mystery surrounding the identity of Bitcoin founder. Who is Satoshi Nakamoto? - WION",
        "content": "While the world of crypto currencies continues to puzzle many, the kind of impact it has had on the financial systems across the world is noteworthy. But mysteries seem to be a running theme and given its origins, it is spot on. Over a decade ago, the world witnessed a cryptic milestone when Satoshi Nakamoto developed Bitcoin, the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency. But who is this mastermind? No one knows for sure.\n\nWhat do we know about Satoshi Nakamoto?\n\nNakamoto is said to be a pseudonym for the person or people who helped create Bitcoin but the real identity of who he, she or they might be, continues to remain one of the biggest mysteries of the 21st century. The mysterious individual or group was the author of a 2008 white paper which outlined the theory and operating structure of the Bitcoin payment system.\n\nNakamoto\u2019s identity continues to remain shrouded in mystery due to the lack of personal or background details about the person who would only communicate via email. One of the biggest indications that Nakamoto created Bitcoin was the famous white paper titled \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\u201d.\n\nThe elusive mastermind behind the now largest cryptocurrency in the world was said to be working on the first version of the software back in 2007. Around two years later, Nakamoto created the first-ever online message board post which was dedicated to cryptocurrency, on the P2P Foundation forum.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve developed a new open source P2P e-cash system called Bitcoin. It\u2019s completely decentralised, with no central server or trusted parties, because everything is based on crypto proof instead of trust. Give it a try, or take a look at the screenshots and design paper,\u201d said Nakamoto, on the forum, as per Forbes.\n\nHowever, in 2010, his involvement with Bitcoin ended but the cryptocurrency did not. As of 2021, at least one million Bitcoin miners were verifying the data that make up the Bitcoin blockchain and the cryptocurrency continues to remain one of the world\u2019s largest by market cap.\n\nWhat did Nakamoto do?\n\nIt is worth noting that while the idea of digital currency was not new at the time, as reports suggest, there had been few attempts to create it. However, Nakamoto managed to solve a fundamental problem with digital currency, duplication. Unlike tangible currency like coins or paper money which could only be present at one place at a time, cryptocurrency could be duplicated which is also known as \u201cdouble-spending\u201d.\n\nSince digital currency does not exist in physical space, the transaction of said currency would not be in a single person\u2019s possession. As a result, digital currency could be spent more than once. In order to overcome this issue, Nakamoto created a blockchain system of verification.\n\nInitially, one of the solutions to circumvent this problem would be third-party intermediaries like banks which would verify if the currency has already been used by its holder. However, given the additional costs and the risk of fraud of the trust-based model, Nakamoto decided to remove the human factor altogether and proposed a decentralised approach for transactions using ledgers.\n\nThis is where the blockchain comes into play. This system adds timestamps to transaction information, and cryptographic techniques are used to encrypt the data which cannot be changed and must be validated. Subsequently, the network is required to verify the authenticity of the transactions based on a majority consensus mechanism called proof-of-work.\n\nIs Nakamoto a real person?\n\nWe know so little about the so-called father of cryptocurrency that many have questioned if Satoshi Nakamoto really does exist. However, given what is known about the mastermind behind this system, there seems to be at least one person, if not people behind it. Case in point, somebody would have to write a source code for Bitcoin, publish the white paper which began it all, send emails and even create a forum to talk about the cryptocurrency.\n\nAbout his disappearance\n\nSeveral reports have quoted Nakamoto\u2019s last email written on 24 April 2011 which was a short statement to another developer where the creator of Bitcoin said \u201cI\u2019ve moved on to other things\u201d and that the project was in \u201cgood hands\u201d. In December 2010 following the creation and initial implementation of Bitcoin, the creator seemingly vanished from the public eye.\n\nIt was in 2014 when a final forum post credited to Nakamoto simply said, \u201cI am not Dorian Nakamoto.\u201d This came after a Newsweek magazine article published in March of that year claimed that a 64-year-old Japanese-American physicist was the creator of Bitcoin.\n\nThe report said, \u201cThe trail followed by Newsweek led to a 64-year-old Japanese-American man whose name really is Satoshi Nakamoto\u201d. Although it could be said that Nakamoto did not necessarily \u2018disappear\u2019 considering his identity was never revealed and anonymity would likely be his only choice to avoid public scrutiny.\n\nIs Elon Musk Satoshi Nakamoto?\n\nThere have been speculations about Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk being Satoshi Nakamoto after a former intern for Musk\u2019s SpaceX company Sahil Gupta, in a blog post on the website Medium suggested so. He cited the billionaire\u2019s knowledge and interests which could have led him to develop a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, Musk has since denied this claim. In 2021, during a podcast by AI researcher Lex Fridman, the Tesla CEO said that he believes that the person behind the Nakamoto pseudonym is none other than cryptographic expert Nick Szabo.\n\n\u201cHe seems to be the one more responsible for the ideas behind Bitcoin than anyone else. He claims not to be Nakamoto, but I'm not sure that's neither here nor there,\u201d said Musk, as quoted by CNBC. However, Szabo had also previously denied this claim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWATCH WION LIVE HERE"

        "content": "The research lead of a reputable financial institution said BTC would hit the milestone by 2024.\n\nOn-chain data suggests an undervalued state as another analyst expects the coin to thrive by the next halving.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] has been on a wild ride over the past few months, hitting yearly highs and then plummeting again. However, a recent prediction by Standard Chartered has suggested that the cryptocurrency could be poised for a massive rally by the end of the coming year, with some analysts predicting that BTC could reach $100,000.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nBTC: Already started the journey to new highs\n\nWhile this may seem like a lofty goal, the digital asset arm of the firm outlined several factors at play that could drive Bitcoin\u2019s price to new heights.\n\nAccording to the report shared by Reuters, the multinational financial institution noted that the banking sector turbulence could have a positive effect on Bitcoin mining activities.\n\nAdditionally, Geoff Kendrick, head of digital assets research at the firm, pointed out that the U.S. Federal Reserves ending its rate hike may have confirmed the end of the crypto winter. Kendrick, in backing his position, mentioned:\n\n\u201cWhile sources of uncertainty remain, we think the pathway to the USD 100,000 level is becoming clearer\u201d\n\nOn looking at the Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio, Glassnode showed that it had exited the bottom to a relatively high level. The NVT ratio is the ratio of the market cap to the transferred on-chain volume, which indicates sentiment and fair value.\n\nWhen this metric is high, it means network value had outpaced network activity, indicating a bearish sentiment. But when it is low, it means that investor sentiment is bullish. At the press time state of the metric, BTC could be considered undervalued.\n\nIs halving the game changer?\n\nOn 23 April, a Bloomberg report mentioned that the Bitcoin halving was paramount to the recovery of the asset. When Bitcoin undergoes a halving, it means that miners\u2019 rewards have been cut in half. And historically, this sets the precedent for a bull market.\n\nJamie Douglas Coutts, an Intelligence analyst at Bloomberg, opined that BTC could be valued at $50,000 around April 2024 after the event.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nNoting that Bitcoin was already in preparation mode and agreeing with some of Kendrick\u2019s reasons, Coutts said,\n\n\u201cBitcoin cycles bottom around 12-18 months prior to the halving and this cycle structure looks similar to the past ones, albeit many things have changed \u2014 while the network is vastly stronger, Bitcoin has never endured a prolonged severe economic contraction.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s liveliness had decreased to 0.60 at press time. This metric increases when long-term holders decide to liquidate their positions. But since it was falling from its peak, it implied that these devoted sets were willing to HODL.\n\nFor the time being, several analysts expect BTC to continue in its correction stage."

        "title": "Examining The Impact Of Bitcoin Halving On Its Market Performance: A Comparative Analysis With Big Eyes Coin - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "As the cryptocurrency market draws the attention of investors and researchers, the impending Bitcoin halving event has raised the question of whether it is responsible for the newfound strength of the cryptocurrency. This article delves into a comparative analysis of Bitcoin and the emerging cryptocurrency Big Eyes Coin (BIG), examining the similarities and differences between the two and assessing the impact of Bitcoin\u2019s halving event on the wider crypto market.\n\nBitcoin \u2013 A Trailblazer in the World of Cryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that operates autonomously without any centralized authority, government, or financial institution like central banks overseeing its transactions. It utilizes peer-to-peer software and cryptography to enable secure and safe transactions. All Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger called blockchain, which ensures the integrity of the BTC and prevents double-spending.\n\nSince its launch in 2009, Bitcoin has grown to become the most widely used and valuable cryptocurrency in the digital realm. As of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $29,906 with a market capitalization of over $578 billion.\n\nExplained: The Concept of Bitcoin Halving and Its Significance in the Cryptocurrency Market\n\nBitcoin halving is a significant event that takes place approximately every four years on the Bitcoin network. During this event, the rewards for miners who add new blocks to the blockchain are halved, resulting in fewer tokens earned for their work. This process is a deliberate attempt to regulate the number of new Bitcoins entering the market, which is capped at 21 million. The halving process is designed to restrict the number of Bitcoins that can be mined, leading to an anticipated increase in demand, which could ultimately result in a rise in the value of Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has undergone three halving events so far in 2012, 2016, and 2020. The next Bitcoin halving is scheduled to take place in April 2024.\n\nThe Importance of Bitcoin Halving: Understanding Its Significance for the Cryptocurrency Market\n\nDuring the halving cycle, the available supply of Bitcoin tokens decreases, leading to a potential increase in the value of yet-to-be-mined coins. The first halving event in November 2012 resulted in Bitcoin\u2019s value skyrocketing from around $12 to almost $1,000 within a year. In the most recent halving in May 2020, Bitcoin\u2019s price was $8,787, but it experienced a significant surge in value in the following months, highlighting the potential for substantial changes in the cryptocurrency market after each halving event.\n\nMaximize Your Earnings with the END300 Code\n\nBig Eyes Coin is a newly launched meme coin that has gained popularity due to its unique cat-themed design and features. Running on the Ethereum blockchain, the Big Eyes Coin uses the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, resulting in lower energy consumption and mining costs compared to Bitcoin.\n\nThe project aims to make a positive impact on the world by allocating 5% of its supply to charities focused on ocean conservation. Big Eyes Coin has already raised over $34 million by the 13th stage of the presale, and the project team is now offering new incentives to attract more investors before the presale ends on June 3rd.\n\nCurrently, the project offers a rare opportunity to receive a 300% bonus by using the code END300 when purchasing BIG tokens or Loot Boxes.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIn the past, Bitcoin\u2019s price and adoption have been significantly affected by the halving event. However, as Big Eyes Coin operates on the PoS algorithm, its mining rewards are based on the number of coins held by miners, rather than computational power. Consequently, the impact of the Bitcoin halving event on Big Eyes Coin may be minimal.\n\nDespite having a lower adoption rate compared to Bitcoin, Big Eyes Coin\u2019s popularity among investors and traders is on the rise due to its potential for growth and low transaction fees.\n\nFor More On Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nOpensea: https://opensea.io/collection/big-eyes-lootbox-cards\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "SINGAPORE - After crashing in 2022, Bitcoin has risen by around 65 per cent so far in 2023, and on Tuesday evening, traded at just over US$27,000, compared with around US$16,000 on Jan 1.\n\nNow, some analysts say the digital currency\u2019s value could more than triple from its present level before the end of 2024.\n\nIn a research note released on Monday, Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick noted that the crypto winter of 2022 is \u201cfinally over\u201d, and that Bitcoin has the potential to reach US$100,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nThe so-called crypto winter of 2022 was a period of significant decline in the prices of cryptocurrencies during the year. This came after a string of firms in the sector went bankrupt and a series of rate hikes by the United States Federal Reserve to tame inflation triggered an outflow of cash from risky assets like crypto.\n\nBitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, saw its value fall from US$69,000 in November 2021 to just over US$15,000 12 months later.\n\nBut things appear to be turning around. A recent banking sector crisis, which saw Swiss bank Credit Suisse and three US banks collapse, has revived the case for crypto as an alternative, decentralised banking system unhampered by financial intermediaries like banks.\n\nIt is also testing the Fed\u2019s resolve to keep interest rates high, and this has raised crypto\u2019s appeal as an alternative investment class.\n\nMr Kendrick noted that valuation troubles faced by some stablecoins, which are competing cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable value relative to a fiat currency like the US dollar, have also helped Bitcoin regain its reputation as digital gold.\n\nBitcoin is often referred to as such because it shares some of the characteristics that make gold valuable, such as scarcity.\n\nThis is ensured by the fact that Bitcoin\u2019s total supply is fixed at 21 million tokens. This means its code is programmed such that no more Bitcoins can be created beyond that number, making it similar to gold, which is a finite resource.\n\nCurrently, around 19 million Bitcoins have been mined and are in circulation, with about 2 million left to be mined, according to the Blockchain Council.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s code includes a mechanism that governs the rate at which new tokens are created.\n\nAs an incentive for Bitcoin miners to process transactions made with the cryptocurrency, they receive a reward for every block of transactions they validate on a digital public ledger known as a blockchain.\n\nThe mechanism halves the reward Bitcoin miners receive after every 210,000 blocks of transactions are completed and validated, which is around once every four years or so."

        "title": "Apple is drifting away it's own Bitcoin wallet - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "For years now the speculation has been circulating that Apple may create its own wallet for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, and with the discovery a few weeks ago this idea seemed to have been strengthened.\n\nIn fact, in early April it was discovered that the Bitcoin whitepaper PDF was included in every copy of macOS as of 2018.\n\nWhile this was only a hidden inclusion, probably the result of the independent initiative of an individual developer at the company and not the company itself, it had suggested that perhaps Apple had changed its mind about cryptocurrencies.\n\nMoreover, there had also been speculation in December that Apple would open its ecosystem to crypto and NTFs as well, thanks to new EU regulations.\n\nIn other words, everything seemed all set for a possible step forward by the company in this regard, but instead, a step backward arrived.\n\nThe removal of Bitcoin\u2019s whitepaper PDF\n\nYesterday, the dedicated news website for the Mac, 9to5mac.com, reported that Apple has removed the Bitcoin whitepaper from the latest macOS beta, called Ventura.\n\nSo after the discovery in early April, the company ran for cover by removing that PDF, probably precisely in response to the speculation triggered by that news about its possible move into the crypto world.\n\nApple has never officially disclosed why Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s whitepaper was present in macOS, but 9to5mac argues that it was probably just some sort of prank by the engineers who worked on building the operating system.\n\nTo tell the truth, the PDF was not simply removed, or replaced with another PDF, but disappeared because Apple removed the internal tool called VirtualScanner that contained the PDF.\n\nAccording to 9to5mac, that hidden tool should never have been discovered and made public, and it had not yet been removed as of 2018 because it did not include sensitive information.\n\nSo Apple did not backtrack on the inclusion of the Bitcoin whitepaper in macOS, but it did remove a hidden tool that contained it and that it had probably just forgotten to remove earlier.\n\nDespite this, it seems unlikely that the news of the whitepaper\u2019s inclusion in macOS did not play a key role in this affair, in part because perhaps someone knew of the VirtualScanner\u2019s existence even before it was made public that it contained Satoshi\u2019s PDF.\n\nThe long history between Apple and Bitcoin\n\nSo far the company has always kept its distance from Bitcoin and the crypto world, although over the years there seemed to be some glimmer of rapprochement.\n\nFor example, in May two years ago it was discovered that Apple was looking for a business development manager in the \u201calternative payments\u201d sector, which had hinted at an entry into the crypto sector as a possible technical player.\n\nIt is worth noting that the last big bull run was underway at the time, and from 2022 onward nothing more was heard of this.\n\nHowever, in November 2021 it was discovered that the company\u2019s current CEO, Tim Cook, had invested in cryptocurrencies. Indeed, he had even stated that everyone should look with interest at the crypto sector.\n\nThis seemed like a real, definitive opening, but apparently it was not followed through.\n\nIt is probably no coincidence at all that these supposed openings occurred precisely in 2021, when the hype toward cryptocurrencies was very high. Indeed, with the bear-market of 2022 everything fell back.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that for now it seems that the company has not yet objected to linking its Apple Pay Wallet to crypto debit cards, which actually allows people to pay in cryptocurrencies using their wallet, albeit indirectly.\n\nApple\u2019s wallet: only fintech, but no crypto\n\nIn reality, Apple\u2019s wallet, which allows payments with various credit and debit cards, is not a crypto wallet at all, neither directly nor indirectly.\n\nWhat is indirectly related to crypto are some debit cards that allow fiat currency payments that can be topped up using cryptocurrencies.\n\nThus, these are the ones that are connected to the crypto world, and not Apple\u2019s wallet that merely withdraws funds in fiat currency from crypto debit cards.\n\nHowever, what does create food for thought is the fact that the company is not opposed to this kind of use of its wallet, even though it has been known for some time now.\n\nSo while it does not seem that Apple has yet made any real concrete steps to enter the crypto sector, it does seem that it does not want to oppose these new technologies.\n\nIf anything, it is very likely that Apple is studying crypto with interest, as also shown by the clear, overt, and direct interest of its CEO.\n\nAt this time it does not seem possible to rule out a priori that sooner or later Apple\u2019s wallet may also directly integrate Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, although it will most likely take some more time.\n\nThe departure hypothesis\n\nAt this point the hypothesis of Apple\u2019s departure from the crypto world does not seem so credible.\n\nThe main reason for the possible strengthening of this hypothesis, namely the removal of Bitcoin\u2019s whitepaper, seems to be due more to a desire to remove a tool that should have remained hidden rather than to a distancing from Bitcoin.\n\nThe fact that the company is not objecting to the use of crypto cards in its wallet reiterates that Apple does not appear to be hostile to the crypto world at all.\n\nWhile the company stopped revealing details linking it to this world in 2022 when the hype dissipated, should the hype return, it may become involved again.\n\nIn short, everything suggests that Apple is not distancing itself from Bitcoin at all.\n\nApple\u2019s possible Bitcoin wallet\n\nInstead, the hypothesis that has been circulating for some time is that Apple may decide at some point to offer its users, especially iPhone users, crypto trading financial services.\n\nAlready to date, there are plenty of Apple users trading crypto on their iPhones, but using apps that have nothing to do with Apple itself.\n\nThis is a real business that the company may want to get into, perhaps through a partnership with some institutional player in the industry, such as Gemini or Coinbase.\n\nTo be honest, it seems rather unlikely that Apple will continue to steer clear of crypto markets, although that does not at all mean that it is likely to develop and release its own wallet for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nIt is worth noting that its main rival in this regard, Samsung, has already equipped its high-end devices with a crypto wallet, so in the event of success it is extremely difficult to imagine Apple choosing to leave the field to its competitors.\n\nHowever, to date it does not appear that Samsung\u2019s crypto wallet has been a great success, and this effectively grants Apple the luxury of being able to stay out of it."
