        "title": "Opinion | Why was the SEC slow on bitcoin ETF? A hacked tweet tells the tale. - The Washington Post",
        "content": "Last week\u2019s hack of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s X account is a real-life metaphor so deliciously apt, so perfectly on the nose, it tells you almost all you need to know about the conundrums besetting modern regulators. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The hack involved the SEC\u2019s then-pending decision on whether to approve exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin. Fund managers have been trying to bring such funds to market, but the SEC has been dragging its feet for a decade \u2014 and not entirely without reason: As cryptocurrency markets evolved, they garnered an astonishing number of scams. Also, the main use for bitcoin seemed to be speculating on the future price of bitcoin.\n\nA few years back, the SEC did allow ETFs based on bitcoin futures products; unlike crypto, futures markets are already highly regulated. But while the fuddy-duddies at the SEC might have thought this made the ETFs entirely different from just holding crypto, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit disagreed, issuing a ruling that made it hard for the agency to continue denying Americans our right to pointlessly speculate on high-tech monopoly money. After all, not everyone lives within walking distance of a casino.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll this set the stage for what happened last Tuesday, when the SEC\u2019s account on X (formerly Twitter) said bitcoin ETFs had been approved. The price of bitcoin rose, only to recede minutes later when SEC Chair Gary Gensler hastily sent a message from his own account, saying that no, no, the SEC\u2019s account had been compromised and bitcoin ETFs hadn\u2019t yet been approved.\n\nFollow this author Megan McArdle 's opinions Follow\n\nIn an apparently unrelated incident the following day, some users reported seeing an approval go briefly live on the SEC site, before disappearing, presumably because someone had accidentally posted it too early. After the market closed, the approval went up again. Bitcoin ETFs were finally a reality.\n\nThe parables here are rich enough to mine forever: These events seemed to vindicate some wariness about moving our entire lives into the digital realm where they can so easily be hacked. But, then again, why should the bitcoin decision have been made by people who had apparently not \u2014 according to the safety team at X \u2014 bothered to enable a common security feature known as \u201ctwo-factor authentication\u201d on the SEC\u2019s official account? For IT folks, this kind of basic precaution is, as security technologist Bruce Schneier put it, \u201ckindergarten stuff.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis looked particularly bad given that the SEC claims oversight of cybersecurity incidents in the private sector, and will probably not accept \u201cI forgot\u201d as an excuse if a company\u2019s poor security results in market-moving hacks. (Further delicious detail: they had to reopen comment on one of those proposed rules because, uh, the internet comment form broke.) Also, it turns out that the government has been working for years on switching over to two-factor authentication. In September, the SEC issued an impressive-sounding progress memo that included a lot of meeting, establishing and implementing but not yet clicking the two-factor authentication checkbox in their social media security settings.\n\nWhich makes this not just a funny mini-scandal but also a story about how much worse the government is at technical things than the private sector it purports to oversee.\n\nWe\u2019ve already heard many reasons the government struggles to do technology well: Salaries aren\u2019t high enough to compete for top tech talent, and dedicated civil servants (yes, there are many) have to navigate around unfireable incompetents. But if you want to fully understand the perverse incentives that the political system creates for people trying their best to give us what we want and need, read \u201cRecoding America,\u201d by Jennifer Pahlka, who founded the U.S. Digital Service during the Obama administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmericans are obsessed with making sure that no government employee, anywhere, ever gets away with anything on the taxpayer dime. So we\u2019ve stripped away their discretion, laying out extraordinarily detailed procedures for every single thing they do \u2014 which many then hew to exactly, no matter how outdated the guidelines or absurd the results because they know that when anything does go wrong, they will be called to account by politicians who understand very little about their jobs. Their safest response when this happens is, \u201cLook, I was following the letter of the law you guys wrote.\u201d\n\nThus, procurement is a glacial process. Much of the technology we do buy doesn\u2019t work as well as it should because it was selected to fit guidelines written years ago \u2014 often by well-meaning people who were mainly thinking about making politicians happy and keeping the inspector general at bay. Even when they\u2019re trying hard, government technologists have to contend with the decades of accumulated bureaucratic cruft.\n\nThis system is fine for an agency that doesn\u2019t want to do anything \u2014 which I guess describes the SEC in this case. But even the most hard-nosed libertarian sometimes wants the government to change with the times and make something happen, like, say, approve a bitcoin ETF. This can\u2019t happen if every agency is mummified in red tape."

(TradingView)\n\nInvestors are also likely seeking redemptions from Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF, analysts said.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s bid to win approval for its own ETF was successful. With about $28 billion in assets under management, the ETF nod has helped creditors of high-profile bankruptcies like FTX.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nNow, some investors are demanding their money back.\n\nSince the fund converted to an ETF, investors are able swap their GBTC shares one to one for the value of the Bitcoin they represent, giving them an off-ramp after years without a redemption function.\n\nMany GBTC investors appear desperate to cash in on their shares.\n\nGBTC, whose volume surpassed $2.3 billion on day one trading, has seen a total of $579 million flow out so far, although final data won\u2019t be available until Tuesday due to a lag in settlement.\n\nThe market will likely have to absorb some of the GBTC outflows, Bernstein analysts Gautaum Chhugani and Mahika Sapra said in a note on Monday.\n\n\u201cIt is fair to assume new ETFs would continue to absorb GBTC redemptions. Thus, it might take longer for new incremental inflows to start impacting fresh demand and the price momentum on underlying Bitcoin,\u201d Chhugani and Sapra said.\n\nStill, an exodus by investors could present new challenges for the 11-year-old firm as it fights to stay competitive in a low-fee environment.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin fell 0.3% since Sunday, trading around $42,600.\n\nEthereum was flat over the past 24 hours.

Fiwind, a national cryptocurrency exchange, will be used to determine the exchange rate and execute the payments.\n\nThis type of rental agreement became possible following the executive order issued by President Javier Milei last year, which opened the door for contracts denominated in cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin has been used in real estate sales before, this appears to be the first instance of its use in an Argentine rental contract.\n\nSpeaking on the executive order last month, Foreign Minister Diana Mondino clarified that lease agreements can now be settled not only in Bitcoin but also other cryptocurrencies and assets. However, the order faces legal challenges and could still be rejected by Congress."

        "title": "Buying the New Bitcoin ETFs? 3 Things to Keep in Mind. - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "With the approval of the first spot Bitcoin (BTC -7.03%) ETFs, the world of crypto investing just became much more interesting. While the new Bitcoin ETFs might not send the price of Bitcoin soaring immediately, they will certainly make crypto much more accessible to the average investor.\n\nHowever, buying a new Bitcoin ETF might not be the no-brainer you think it is. Here are three important points to consider.\n\nBitcoin ETF fees\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initially approved 11 different spot Bitcoin ETFs, and more could be on the way. To stand out in this crowded field, issuers are probably going to launch massive marketing campaigns based around low fees. The goal will be to get as big as possible as fast as possible. Thus, offering the lowest fees will be the primary way to land as much investor money as quickly as possible.\n\nAll of the major Bitcoin ETF issuers have released their initial fee structures, and it looks like expense ratios will be in line with what you'd expect from a traditional ETF. And it looks like BlackRock (NYSE: BLK), via its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, will have the inside track with investors due to its low 0.25% annual fees.\n\nSo far, so good. It seems like a no-brainer, right? Just pick the Bitcoin ETF with the lowest fees, and you're good to go. However, keep in mind that some ETFs are already promising fee waivers and fee discounts as a way of attracting new investors. So, if the new fees seem too good to be true, they probably are. When the fees go up after an initial promotional period, you might be regretting your choice.\n\nBitcoin ETF performance\n\nAnother point to consider is tracking error, which is one of the major risks of investing in ETFs. Tracking error is the difference between the performance of the underlying asset (in this case, Bitcoin) and the ETF itself. Theoretically, if the price of Bitcoin goes up by 150% in a single year (as it did last year), then the value of your ETF should go up by 150% as well. Otherwise, you're leaving money on the table.\n\nThe problem is that the first batch of Bitcoin ETFs sometimes suffered from tracking error. That's because they used financial derivatives (i.e., futures contracts) to track the price of Bitcoin. The new ETFs are supposed to cure this problem by holding Bitcoin directly (i.e., spot Bitcoin). Unlike traditional ETFs (which typically hold a diversified mix of stocks), these Bitcoin ETFs are going to hold only Bitcoin, so that should help to minimize tracking error as well.\n\nNonetheless, keep a careful eye on how these new Bitcoin ETFs perform right out of the gate. Maybe I'm overthinking things here, but it seems like getting a perfect 1:1 match in terms of performance may be a bit trickier than many people think due to the inherent volatility of Bitcoin.\n\nSpot Bitcoin vs. spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nIt might sound crazy to suggest this, but these new spot Bitcoin ETFs may not be the right choice for all individual investors. I would characterize this as the \"spot Bitcoin vs. spot Bitcoin ETF\" conundrum. In short, would you rather buy Bitcoin directly (via a cryptocurrency exchange), or would you rather buy Bitcoin indirectly (via an ETF)? Theoretically, the new Bitcoin ETFs should make owning Bitcoin cheaper and more convenient than if you bought it directly from a crypto exchange, so this question should be easy to answer.\n\nThat being said, longtime crypto investors may decide to keep on using a cryptocurrency exchange like Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN) to buy Bitcoin. Or they might decide to use one of the many decentralized crypto exchanges to buy Bitcoin directly for their crypto wallets. In the latter case, they won't be relying on a financial intermediary to hold their crypto.\n\nAfter all, a classic rallying cry in the crypto world has always been, \"Not your (cryptographic) keys, not your crypto.\" Remember: With the new Bitcoin ETFs, you will only be holding Bitcoin indirectly. The big Wall Street firms will be in charge of the cryptographic keys required to buy and sell Bitcoin. At the end of the day, they own the Bitcoin, not you.\n\nWill Bitcoin go mainstream?\n\nThe new Bitcoin ETFs will become extremely popular with a broad cross-section of the population. Buying Bitcoin will now be so easy that anyone with a brokerage account will be able to do it. You won't need to create crypto wallets, or memorize cryptographic keys, or jump through any of the other hoops that have sometimes been required to buy Bitcoin over the past decade.\n\nOverall, the new Bitcoin ETFs should be good for the individual investor. But keep in mind that, just because Wall Street is telling you to run out and buy these new Bitcoin ETFs, you don't have to. There are still plenty of other alternatives, including buying Bitcoin directly."

        "content": "CoinShares: Bitcoin Halving to Squeeze Miners' Margins\n\nAs the next Bitcoin halving event approaches, mining firms are bracing for significant cost increases. CoinShares has analyzed the impact of the halving and identified the companies best positioned to weather the storm in a recent report. The halving event, scheduled for April 2024, will reduce the block reward given to miners by half, slowing down the rate of new Bitcoin creation. This will likely lead to an increase in the cost of production and cash costs for miners.\n\nCoinShares predicts that the average cost of production and cash costs will increase from approximately $16,800 and $25,000 per Bitcoin in the third quarter of2023 to $27,900 and $37,800, respectively. The analysis suggests that Bitcoin mining firms Riot, TeraWulf, and CleanSpark are best positioned to navigate the halving event due to their cost structure and long runways. However, all miners will face challenges if the Bitcoin price falls below $40,000.\n\nCoinShares points out that while most miners are improving their fleet efficiency, the direct cost structure is not improving since they will need to increase their power draw and energy consumed to mine the same amount of Bitcoin. Electricity costs per Bitcoin pre- and post-halving form about 68% and 71% of miners' total cost structure, respectively.\n\nThe analysis also highlights the challenges faced by Core Scientific, which recently closed an oversubscribed $55-million equity financing round in an effort to return to solvency. Overall, the Bitcoin halving event will likely squeeze miners' margins, and only the most efficient and well-positioned firms will be able to remain profitable.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

However, Balchunas noted that these numbers may be adjusted due to transactions awaiting accounting settlement. Grayscale's ETF, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), experienced an outflow of $579 million during the period. After deducting the GBTC outflows, the net total inflows across all spot Bitcoin ETFs stood at $819 million.\n\nThe outflows from GBTC could be attributed to holders converting their shares following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) approval of the ETF through a ruling change. Some GBTC holders are reportedly switching to lower-fee options from other fund managers. Grayscale is charging 1.50% while other asset managers like BlackRock are charging 0.25%. GBTC is one of the largest holders of Bitcoin, managing over $27 billion worth of the cryptocurrency. Shares of GBTC have been traded since 2013 but were not redeemable for Bitcoin until January 11.\n\nAmong the spot Bitcoin ETFs, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust topped the performance with $497.7 million total flows, followed by Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF with $422.3 million and Bitwise with $237.9 million.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "Why ETFs are not having positive effect on Bitcoin price, yet - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Despite the influx of substantial capital into these new spot Bitcoin ETFs, with CoinShares reporting $1.18 billion in inflows into digital asset ETFs globally last week, the expected positive impact on Bitcoin\u2019s price hasn\u2019t materialized. This raises questions about the underlying mechanics of these ETFs and their influence on Bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\nLet\u2019s first ensure we correctly frame the situation. The recent price run-up picked up steam when BlackRock announced their filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF on June 15, 2023. At that time, Bitcoin\u2019s price was around $25,000. Subsequently, there was a 70% increase to around $42,000, where it essentially traded sideways.\n\nAs the ETFs launched, Bitcoin spiked to $49,000 but sold off rapidly to around $42,000. Looking at the chart, it\u2019s rational to suggest that perhaps Bitcoin was overbought at above $44,000 for this point in the cycle.\n\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s look at how Bitcoin purchases work in relation to the recently sanctioned spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nHow Bitcoin is valued for ETF purposes.\n\nThe operation of spot Bitcoin ETFs is more complex than it appears. When individuals buy or sell shares of an ETF, like the one offered by BlackRock, Bitcoin is not bought or sold in real time. Instead, the Bitcoin that represents the shares is purchased at least a day earlier.\n\nThe ETF issuer creates shares with cash, which is then used to buy Bitcoin. This indirect mechanism means that direct transfers of Bitcoin between ETFs do not occur. Therefore, the impact on Bitcoin\u2019s price is delayed and does not reflect real-time trading activity.\n\nEssentially, with an ETF like BlackRock\u2019s, the share price on any given day is meant to represent the average price for Bitcoin across standard trading hours, not the live price of Bitcoin at any given time. Most ETFs use \u2018The CF Benchmarks Index\u2019 to calculate the price of Bitcoin for any given day; the CF Benchmarks website describes it as;\n\n\u201cThe CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR) is a once a day benchmark index price for Bitcoin that aggregates trade data from multiple Bitcoin-USD markets operated by major cryptocurrency exchanges.\u201d\n\nIt uses an average price across Bitstamp, Coinbase, Gemini, Itbit, Kraken, and LMAX Digital. According to CF Benchmarks, this is what the price of Bitcoin looks like. Notice its recent high was $47,525 on Jan. 11.\n\nHere is the same period and Y-axis scale using CryptoSlate data on a 1-hour timeframe. As of press time, Bitcoin is worth $42,594.27, according to CF Benchmarks, while CryptoSlate has it at $42,332.35 in real-time. This suggests the spot ETF, which is not available today as it is a public holiday in the U.S., is trading at a discount to spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest: I didn\u2019t think this was what would happen when the ETFs launched. I humbly believed that the ETFs would actually track the price of Bitcoin, and institutions would buy and sell BTC relative to the traded ETF shares. How wrong and naive I was.\n\nI read through the S1 filings in depth but did not consider that the underlying Bitcoin would be bought potentially days later via closed-door trades for average prices. I took it for granted that the CF Benchmark Index price would be a live aggregate price. Notably, that does exist, and it\u2019s called the BRTI. However, this is only used for \u2018reference\u2019 purposes, not to calculate trade prices.\n\nHow Bitcoin gets into an ETF.\n\nThis is how Bitcoin is generally traded across the different spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAuthorized Participants such as Goldman Sachs, Jane Street, and JPMorgan Securities place their creation orders for baskets of shares with a \u2018Transfer Agent, Cash Custodian, or Prime Execution Agent\u2019 by a set time on any standard business day. This is 2 pm for Grayscale, whereas BlackRock has a 6 pm cut-off time.\n\nFollowing this, the Sponsor (ETF) is responsible for determining the total basket Net Asset Value (NAV) and calculating any fees. This process is typically completed as soon as practicable; for example, with Grayscale, it\u2019s 4 pm; for BlackRock, it\u2019s 8 pm, New York time. Precise timing here is essential for ensuring the accurate valuation of the baskets based on the day\u2019s closing market data.\n\nYou may have seen terms such as T+1 and T+2 floating around concerning ETFs. The term \u201cT+1\u201d or \u201cT+2\u201d refers to the settlement dates for these transactions. \u201cT\u201d stands for the transaction date, the day the order is placed. \u201cT+1\u201d means the transaction will be settled the next business day after the order is placed, while \u201cT+2\u201d indicates settlement occurring two days later.\n\nWith the spot Bitcoin ETFs, a liquidity provider transfers the total basket amount in Bitcoin to the Trust\u2019s vault balance on either the T+1 or T+2 date, depending on the specific prospectus. This reportedly ensures the transaction aligns with standard financial market practices for settling trades.\n\nThe execution and settlement of the Bitcoin purchase and its transfer into the Trust\u2019s trading wallet typically happen on T+1, not when the ETF shares are purchased.\n\nOTC Trading and its implications\n\nA crucial aspect of this mechanism is the Over-The-Counter (OTC) trading involved. Trades are conducted between institutional players in a private setting, away from public exchanges. While not directly influencing market prices, these transactions set a precedent for exchange prices.\n\nSuppose institutions, such as BlackRock, agree on a lower price for Bitcoin during these OTC trades. In that case, it can indirectly influence the market price if that information becomes available to the public or market makers. It does not, however, affect the live price of Bitcoin as these trades aren\u2019t added to the global combined order book. They are essentially peer-to-peer private trades.\n\nFurther, based on the CF Benchmark Index pricing methodology, if Bitcoin were to trade at, say, $42,000 all day but then rally into close to $50,000 in the closing minutes of the day, the CF index price would likely be well under the current spot price depending on volume (and other complicated calculations made by CF Benchmarks.)\n\nThis would then mean the NAV would be calculated based on a lower price than the spot price, and any creations or redemptions for the following day would occur OTC, aiming to be as close to NAV as possible.\n\nAny market makers who have access to these OTC desk trades are then unlikely to want to trade Bitcoin at the current spot price of $50,000, potentially removing liquidity at these higher prices and thus bringing the spot price back in line with the NAV of the ETFs. In the short term, the ETF NAVs could play a much more significant role in defining the spot Bitcoin price and, therefore, reduce volatility toward a smoother average price.\n\nHowever, these trades must still occur on the blockchain, necessitating the transfer of Bitcoin between wallets. This movement, especially among institutional wallets, will become increasingly significant for market analysis.\n\nFor example, Coinbase Prime\u2019s hot wallet facilitates trades, while institutions\u2019 cold storage wallets are used for longer-term holding and can be analyzed on platforms like Arkham Intelligence.\n\nI believe the more transparent these OTC trades can become, the better for all market participants. However, the visibility of these activities is currently somewhat opaque, something the SEC seemingly believes is \u2018best\u2019 for investors."

        "content": "The ratio between longs and shorts for bitcoin on Binance Futures has risen to a multi-month high. This metric is considered a barometer of investor anticipation, with a high long-short ratio indicating that more investors have a positive expectation for the bitcoin price.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, the long-short ratio has increased sharply to 2.86, according to The Block's Data Dashboard \u2014 despite BTC -6.77% retracing gains made since multiple spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds were approved. The present reading is relatively high, considering that if an equal number of traders were positioned long and short, the reading would be 1.\n\nLast week, before multiple spot bitcoin ETFs were approved, the long-short ratio was at a low of 0.86. However, after approval, the ratio rose, as traders speculated on the asset's appreciation.\n\nCoinglass data also concurs with that from The Block, showing that more trader positions are long rather than short. The crypto derivatives data analysis platform puts the current long-short ratio for bitcoin positions on Binance Futures at 2.63.\n\nOpen trades show higher bullish sentiment\n\nAccording to Coinglass, a high long-short ratio suggests bullish market sentiment, while a low ratio suggests bearish market sentiment.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nThe current bitcoin sentiment on Coinglass is weighted towards bullish bets. The distribution of long positions compared to short positions in the last 24 hours indicates that 42% of traders have adopted a bullish stance, whereas only 22% have taken a bearish position. The remaining percentage comprises neutral positions.\n\nBull sentiment could become exhausted\n\nContrarian traders might analyze the current market structure and observe that many have already taken long positions. This cohort of traders might anticipate that the momentum of bullish sentiment is beginning to slow down or level off.\n\nContrarian trading strategies often involve going against the crowd, assuming that a crowded trade might be nearing exhaustion. These times of crowded trading, such as a relatively high or low long-short ratio, could be followed by a cascade of liquidations if the bitcoin price suddenly swings in a particular direction.\n\nThe price of the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization declined by over 0.3% in the past 24 hours, falling to $42,602 at 7:50 a.m. ET, according to The Block's Price Page."

        "content": "Bitcoin experienced a substantial correction following the approval and listing of the much-hyped 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. At one point on Friday, the cryptocurrency's value decreased by approximately 10 percent, falling from the previous day's peak of $49,000 to below $42,000. However, it has since rebounded and is currently trading at around $42,700 at the time of writing.\n\nDisappointing Demand for Bitcoin ETFs\n\nWhy did the market go in the other direction despite the massive anticipation for Bitcoin ETFs? Even experts previously anticipated that the ETFs would ease the entry barrier for retail and institutional investors to get crypto exposure directly from their brokerage accounts.\n\nPrice movement of Bitcoin, Source: Coinmarketcap.com\n\nAlthough it has been only two days since the 11 Bitcoin ETFs have traded on the US exchanges, the numbers have been disappointing.\n\nThe ten newly listed Bitcoin ETFs attracted only $1.4 billion in new funds within two days. Despite the anticipation surrounding their launch, none of the recently introduced Bitcoin ETFs achieved top rankings among US ETFs based on their initial success.\n\nKeep Reading TradingView Enhances DeFi Tools on Polygon via QuickSwap Partnership\n\nAlong with the poor inflows, Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF, which was converted from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, witnessed an outflow of $579 million, and the previously existing BITO futures ETF endured $151 million in outflows. Considering these figures, the two-day net inflows in the Bitcoin ETFs are only $652 million, while the net spot Bitcoin ETF inflows was at $819 million.\n\nInflows into the 10 new bitcoin ETFs hit +$1.4 billion over 2 days.\n\n\n\nSubtracting GBTC's outflows of -$579m we get a net inflow of +$818.9m into the 10 new vehicles.\n\n\n\nPeople rotating out of GBTC into the others & Grayscale selling BTC are behind the price dump despite the inflows: pic.twitter.com/L29Vp3QecP \u2014 Joe Consorti \u26a1 (@JoeConsorti) January 13, 2024\n\nThe Hype Could Not Pump New Monies\n\nAlthough the industry created the hype around the US Bitcoin ETFs, such instruments were already available in several other countries. However, the capital market size of those countries is not comparable to that of the US.\n\nCanada launched the Purpose Investments Bitcoin ETF in February 2021, and within the first two days of trading, the Canadian Bitcoin ETF accumulated assets under management (AUM) totaling $421 million. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin ETFs launched by the two financial giants, BlackRock and Fidelity, currently boast AUMs of $498 million and $422 million, respectively.\n\nInterestingly, the Canadian Bitcoin ETF charges 1.5 percent in fees, while the US one is taking an economical approach, with the lowest fees being 0.2 percent (excluding conditional fee waivers).\n\nAfter the two performances of the US Bitcoin ETFs, the long-term predictions of the inflows appeared to be long-shots. Bloomberg predicted a $4 billion inflow on the first day and $50 billion by the year's end, while analysts at Standard Chartered were more bullish, eying $100 million by the end of 2024.\n\n@BlackRock may break the first-day flow record with a possible $2 billion asset injection on the first day of trading for its US spot Bitcoin ETF, according to BI's senior ETF analyst @EricBalchunas Seed funding could combine with grassroots interest to give it momentum in a\u2026 pic.twitter.com/cjUoSzsqgt \u2014 Bloomberg Intelligence (@BBGIntelligence) January 10, 2024\n\nMeanwhile, the stock price of the largest US Bitcoin exchange, Coinbase, is plunging about 30 percent from December\u2019s peak. On last Friday\u2019s trading session alone, Coinbase stock declined 7.35 percent, shedding one more percent-point in after-hours trading."

        "content": "Approval of the first-ever batch of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has raised the spirits of the crypto community globally. The agency has given the green light to 11 applications, including from BlackRock, ARK Invest, Fidelity, VanEck and Invesco.\n\nThe watershed moment is expected to be a game-changer for Bitcoin, enabling institutional and retail investors to invest in the largest cryptocurrency by market share without directly holding it. Rather than buying Bitcoin on a crypto exchange, such as Binance or Coinbase, investors can buy the Bitcoin ETF to get exposure to BTC.\n\nHolding Bitcoin ETFs vs. Bitcoin\n\nWith ETFs, investors can buy a product that tracks the price of an associated commodity or security through the same mechanism already in place for index funds. BTC ETFs simplify things for investors as they can manage their holdings without maintaining a crypto wallet or arranging cold storage.\n\nBitcoin ETFs provide registered investment advisers (RIAs), retirement funds and other institutions with access to Bitcoin. Entities and regular people restricted from accessing this asset class or who had reservations about investing in digital assets can now hold BTC.\n\nThe term \u201cspot\u201d in spot Bitcoin ETF refers to the actual holding of assets, not some derivative contract. Each investor will own a piece of Bitcoin. Investors could also buy Bitcoin futures ETFs, which means agreeing to buy or sell BTC at a specific price on a predetermined date, regardless of the market price. Investors can buy and sell Bitcoin ETFs as often as they like during trading hours.\n\nApproved Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 10 from major fund managers. The approved ETFs are the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Fidelity\u2019s Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (FBTC), the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO), VanEck\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (HODL), Franklin Templeton\u2019s Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC), the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW), the Hashdex Bitcoin ETF DEFI and the Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR).\n\nThe approved spot Bitcoin ETFs will be listed across several stock exchanges in the U.S., including the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and the Nasdaq.\n\nIn October 2021, the SEC gave the go-ahead to Bitcoin futures ETFs that track agreements to buy or sell BTC at a pre-specified price. The first Bitcoin-linked ETF that received approval from the SEC was the Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThe advantage of the usual ETFs is that they roll out a diversified basket of assets. However, A Bitcoin ETF is linked to just one cryptocurrency, i.e., Bitcoin, so it is likely to experience the same volatile swings as BTC.\n\nWhat are the various ways to buy Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nThere are several ways to buy Bitcoin ETFs:\n\nOnline brokerage accounts\n\nThe brokerages usually have a search tool that allows users to search for the fund by its name or ticker symbol and trade it. After the approval of spot ETFs in the U.S., one can buy these funds with brokerages such as Charles Schwab, Fidelity, Robinhood and Interactive Brokers, among others.\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges\n\nWhile crypto exchanges are still grappling with a fast-changing regulatory ecosystem, they have plans to roll out ETFs. Kraken\u2019s ETF trading services are expected in 2024. Coinbase, another crypto bigwig, is acting custodian for eight of the ETFs approved by the SEC.\n\nFinancial advisers\n\nAccording to the Bitwise 2024 benchmark survey, financial advisers in the U.S. generally expressed interest in crypto equity ETFs. The results showed that 19% of advisers can buy crypto in client accounts. The survey also highlighted that 98% of advisers who currently have an allocation to crypto in client accounts plan to maintain or increase that exposure in 2024.\n\nRobo-advisors\n\nRobo-advisors like Wealthfront and Betterment can facilitate the purchase of Bitcoin ETFs by providing an easily accessible, low-cost, automated investing platform. By permitting investments in cryptocurrency-related ETFs with comparatively low minimum balance requirements, they serve novice and experienced investors.\n\nTypically, robo-advisors offer automated portfolio management customized to the investor\u2019s objectives and risk tolerance. This includes asset allocation, investment selection and portfolio rebalancing.\n\nTraditional banks\n\nTypically, an individual who wants to purchase Bitcoin ETFs through a traditional bank would open a brokerage account with the bank\u2019s investment division. After funding and activating their account, traders can look for the preferred Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe person can purchase shares of the ETF after determining what it is, in the same way as they would any other stock or ETF offered through the bank\u2019s brokerage services. However, availability and direct access to Bitcoin ETFs may differ based on the client\u2019s region and the bank\u2019s particular offers.\n\nFurthermore, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, which may lead to some delay before traditional banks begin offering Bitcoin ETFs as an investment option to their customers.\n\nDirectly from ETF issuers\n\nInvestors can go directly to the ETF issuer portals and buy the product. However, one may require an account with a broker to purchase an ETF. For instance, when visiting the Hashdex website, customers are asked to select one of the brokers the issuer works with.\n\nHow to buy Bitcoin ETFs\n\nHere is the process to buy BTC ETFs via brokerage services:\n\nStep 1: Open a brokerage account\n\nDownload a brokerage services app such as BlackRock or Robinhood or open their web portals, complete the Know Your Customer checks and log in.\n\nStep 2: Fund the account\n\nThe trader must fund their brokerage account using their linked bank account, checking or savings. They could make a wire transfer, deposit a check or transfer funds from another broker.\n\nStep 3: Conduct research on available Bitcoin ETFs\n\nInvestors considering a Bitcoin ETF should be mindful of key aspects such as the issuer and the expense ratio associated with the ETF. The expense ratio is the fee charged by the issuer for managing the ETF, which can impact the overall returns of the investment.\n\nStep 4: Select preferred Bitcoin ETFs\n\nInvestors can delve into a range of Bitcoin ETFs, selecting those that align with their investment preferences and goals. This process involves evaluating various funds to identify the ones that best meet their criteria.\n\nStep 5: Place an order\n\nIn this step, one can place an order using funds in the account and buy the selected ETFs. This includes entering the selected Bitcoin ETF\u2019s ticker symbol in the specific field provided on the trading or order placement interface of a brokerage account and specifying the number of shares one wishes to purchase. Depending on their trading strategy, the investor may choose a market, limit or stop order.\n\nAfter reviewing the order details to ensure accuracy, the investor can submit the order. The brokerage will then execute the order according to the specified terms, and the Bitcoin ETF shares will be added to the investor\u2019s portfolio.\n\nStep 6: Monitor your investments regularly\n\nRegularly reviewing investments helps investors respond to market changes and nudge their investments in the right direction.\n\nThe door gets opened\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs is an opportunity for institutional and retail investors to invest in a more regulated environment. Several ETFs have slashed their fee for managing the products amid competition. BTC ETFs are expected to bring a massive inflow of funds into the crypto ecosystem. Subsequently, as other countries follow, Bitcoin may become integrated with the global financial mainstream.\n\nAlthough regulators have only given the green light to Bitcoin ETFs, there\u2019s anticipation that ETFs for other major cryptocurrencies could eventually receive approval. While it remains uncertain when this might happen, the crypto community is optimistic, viewing the current approvals as a positive sign for the future of broader cryptocurrency ETFs.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "By Marc Taverner\n\nThe opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not represent in any way the editorial position of Euronews.\n\nWe can protect Bitcoin\u2019s long-term value by diversifying how and where we invest in it and keeping a close eye on the custody practices and decentralisation (or lack thereof) of these financial products, Marc Taverner writes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe recent surge in the price of Bitcoin (BTC) has the market feeling more buoyant and positive than it has in some time.\n\nTraders and investors across Europe, the US and the UAE seem optimistic about the approval of exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, which could further propel its value \u2014 exciting even for those outside of the United States.\n\nHowever, while this development may be seen as positive for price growth, it raises concerns about the decentralisation of the market.\n\nAnd as the ETFs have been approved, soon we will know if they can attract more institutional investors, thus boosting liquidity and market stability. However, we must question whether this influx of external influence comes at a cost.\n\nYou win some, you lose some?\n\nNot everyone shared the optimism regarding the US Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC's) approval. Prominent Bitcoin critic and gold advocate Peter Schiff has voiced concerns.\n\nHe cautioned that ETF approval could have a catastrophic impact on the price of Bitcoin, especially if the anticipated institutional demand fails to materialise.\n\nThis and some other perspectives challenged the general optimism, and they even created a temporary surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price over the last weeks. But the answer is \u2014 no one has the answer to what will come next.\n\nA bitcoin symbol is presented on an LED screen during the closing ceremony of a congress for cryptocurrency investors in Santa Maria Mizata, El Salvador, November 2021 Salvador Melendez/AP\n\nThe BTC ETFs were approved by the SEC last week, but the question of the legitimacy and positive impact of external influence on crypto is still in the air.\n\nAmong the eight ETFs that were awaiting approval, only one of them utilises a decentralised custody solution (Fidelity). The remaining seven, including Coinbase, rely on centralised custody solutions.\n\nThis raises a crucial concern: are we overlooking the fact that ETFs, while supporting price growth, could undermine the core of Bitcoin\u2019s decentralisation?\n\nCommand and control model at odds with Bitcoin's vision\n\nWhile ETFs may boost Bitcoin's price and bring more liquidity into the market, they could also promote the centralisation of accessing it.\n\nFor instance, investing in a Blackrock ETF imposes certain limitations on the investor. These limitations include individuals and investors being bound to a centralised custody solution that cannot be easily escaped.\n\nIt consolidates centralised control over a market and asset that was meant to liberate them.\n\nAn advertisement for Bitcoin cryptocurrency is displayed on a street in Hong Kong, February 2022 AP Photo/Kin Cheung\n\nThis shift towards centralisation resonates with a model of control and command that seems at odds with Bitcoin's original vision of empowering individuals through decentralisation.\n\nBitcoin was conceived as a tool to redistribute power from centralised authorities to individuals, but the advent of ETFs risks subverting this ideal. Investors need to consider the direction this journey is taking them.\n\nWould it not be more prudent to invest directly in Bitcoin, where they retain full control over their assets and are not subject to oversight by the SEC?\n\nKeeping a close eye on custody practices key\n\nGiven the potential risks posed by investing in a Blackrock ETF, it is worthwhile to consider alternative options that prioritise individual control and minimise regulatory oversight.\n\nBy supporting a system wherein investors have more autonomy to exit and operate outside the purview of regulatory bodies like the SEC, the market may be able to preserve its decentralisation vision while benefiting from the advantages offered by ETFs.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEurope has several of these products, which seem to get overlooked in the ETF hype cycle.\n\nEven after the ETFs are approved, investors must consider not just the financial implications but also the long-term impact on their investment from their investment.\n\nIt presents a paradox \u2014 while they may propel Bitcoin into the financial mainstream, they could also compromise the very decentralisation that makes Bitcoin such a valuable asset.\n\nUltimately, the decision regarding ETFs was in the hands of the SEC, and the decision was made. The market will witness the outcome in due course.\n\nStill, we can protect Bitcoin\u2019s long-term value by diversifying how and where we invest in it and keeping a close eye on the custody practices and decentralisation (or lack thereof) of these financial products.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMarc Taverner is the CEO and co-founder of XEROF, a Swiss financial services provider specialising in cryptoassets.\n\nAt Euronews, we believe all views matter.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) price is down by roughly $4,000 since the approval of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the U.S., signaling a growing \u201csell-the-news\u201d sentiment in the market. Meanwhile, technical chart patterns hint at the possibility of a continued sell-off in the coming days or weeks.\n\nWhat could happen next, and how low could the Bitcoin price go?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s maximum pain target is $34,850\n\nAs seen on the daily chart below, Bitcoin\u2019s price trajectory shows consolidation within a bullish channel.\n\nBTC/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave) has provided support near $42,120, with prices oscillating above it as of Jan. 14. However, the relative strength Index (RSI) hovers near the mid-line, indicating a lack of strong bullish momentum.\n\nIn addition, the RSI has recently formed lower highs as opposed to Bitcoin's higher highs, a sign of growing bearish divergence.\n\nTherefore, if the BTC price breaks below the 50-day EMA, it could seek the next support near the bullish channel\u2019s lower trendline. This trendline coincides with Bitcoin\u2019s 200-day EMA (the blue wave) near $34,850, a low not seen since the Q4, 2023-consolidation phase.\n\nBankers will crash Bitcoin to $25,000\u2013$30,000\n\nHowever, market commentators such as Crypto Poseidonn see a Bitcoin price crash toward the $25,000\u2013$30,000 range, noting that this is where most recent buyers accumulated BTC.\n\nIn the first scenario, investors that have acquired Bitcoin between $25,000 and $30,000 on ETF approval expectations will not profit much because bankers will likely not pay them a substantial premium over these prices.\n\nTherefore, as Bitcoin approaches $30,000, the bankers may buy from investors, establishing a new market bottom.\n\nBTC/USD daily price chart. Source: Crypto Poseidonn/TradingView\n\nHowever, the market may correct below $25,000 in the second scenario, allowing new institutional investors to acquire even more BTC with leverage.\n\nAnother analyst, Rhaonnor, argues that the market has already priced in the Bitcoin ETF rally, suggesting that the range between $24,000 and $32,000 should hold.\n\nHowever, not everyone agrees as trader il Capo of Crypto expects this level to possibly crack before the ultimate price target of $12,000.\n\n\u201cInterest rates were increasing during 2004-2007 and when the FED pivoted, the market started dropping to new lows,\u201d the trader explained his reasoning on X last month. \u201cNow we are in a similar situation.\"\n\nCan Bitcoin resume its upward trajector?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s ability to hold its prices above the 50-day EMA will determine whether more upside is to come in the short term.\n\nBTC price could further climb toward $50,000 or $60,000 in the coming weeks, as predicted by Lucas Kiely, chief investment officer at Yield App, and Christos Makridis, the founder/CEO of Dynamic AI. He added:\n\nWe will see a minor pullback, but it\u2019ll be nothing to write home about. It may take a little while for it to surpass the $50,000 threshold. But by June, the halving will be out of the way, and the price should be higher.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETFs attract $1.4B in two trading sessions\n\nInterestingly, Bitcoin\u2019s prevailing bull pennant pattern indicates a possible price rally toward the $50,000\u201360,000 range, as shown below.\n\nBull pennants are bullish continuation patterns that get resolved after the price breaks above the upper trendline and rises by as much as the previous uptrend\u2019s height.\n\nBTC/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe pattern shows that the BTC price can reach $56,200 by March 2024. Nonetheless, a break below the pennant\u2019s lower trendline would bring the bearish targets mentioned above.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

        "content": "Binance Research analysts outlined eight areas they anticipate significant progress on throughout this year \u2014 including the Bitcoin BTC -6.66% ecosystem, artificial intelligence, real-world assets and institutional adoption.\n\nIn 2023, the crypto market witnessed a significant rebound, with a 109% increase in market cap, amid optimism surrounding spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund approvals and a favorable macro environment, the analysts wrote in a report published today. Bitcoin regained its dominance, and Layer 2 solutions saw a 321% rise in total value locked. The decentralized finance sector also grew notably, fueled by innovations in liquid staking tokens and the integration of real-world assets, they said.\n\nConversely, the global stablecoin market saw a 5.2% decline in market cap, with Tether's USDT maintaining a dominant position. Non-fungible tokens experienced a surge in the last quarter, led by Bitcoin NFTs. On-chain gaming activity doubled in active wallets by the year's end, reflecting a resurgence in this sector. Meanwhile, web3 projects attracted 1,173 investments, totaling $9 billion in 2023 \u2014 mainly in infrastructure \u2014 signaling the potential for ongoing recovery and growth in the ecosystem this year, the analysts added.\n\nBitcoin, AI, RWAs and institutional adoption\n\nFor 2024, Binance Research expects Bitcoin narratives to stay at the forefront, driven by developments like Ordinals NFTs and BRC-20 tokens, the liquidity injection of spot bitcoin ETF approvals recognizing bitcoin as a \u201clegitimate asset\u201d and the upcoming halving event \u2014 when the block reward for Bitcoin miners gets cut in half. While not a direct cause-and-effect relationship, halving events have often preceded substantial bull runs in the bitcoin market \u2014 with the next one potentially less than 100 days away.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nThe analysts also expect institutional adoption of crypto to accelerate this year, with the \u201centrance of reputable traditional asset management giants such as BlackRock and Fidelity into crypto during the bear market testament to their belief in the long-term potential of the industry.\u201d\n\nArtificial intelligence's integration with crypto is another area poised for growth in 2024, catalyzed by the popularity of applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Such integration is still in the early stages but offers potential use cases in trade automation, predictive analytics, generative art, decentralized autonomous organization operations and decentralized storage for AI model training, according to the analysts.\n\nReal-world asset tokenization is another identified theme for 2024. RWA tokenization is gaining momentum due to its ability to bring off-chain assets onto blockchains, offering greater transparency and efficiency. Tokenized treasuries are likely to continue to be an attractive investment while interest rates remain elevated, the analysts said. \u201cAdditionally, alongside the accelerated institutional adoption of RWAs, developments in related infrastructures such as decentralized identity, oracles and interoperability solutions are also expected to gain momentum,\u201d they added.\n\nOther themes Binance Research identified for the year ahead include a thriving on-chain liquidity landscape, continued emphasis on security improvements, ownership economy applications traction, such as decentralized physical network infrastructure (DePin) and decentralized social media, plus account abstraction gaining importance in simplifying and enhancing the user experience of blockchain technology."

Then barbell your holdings with lottery tickets. Seriously \u2014 let's get a grip.\"\n\nThe former chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch argued that bitcoin and other tokens are examples of the \"greater fool\" theory at work. In other words, people buy them not because they're intrinsically worth anything, but because they hope to sell them for a profit to someone even more foolish.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosenberg's diatribe followed US regulators' approval of nearly a dozen spot bitcoin ETFs last week. The veteran economist noted the most popular crypto tumbled in price from a two-year high of $49,000 last Thursday morning, to $44,000 by Friday evening.\n\n\"Who needs this degree of volatility in their lives?\" he queried. \"Not me, that's for sure.\"\n\nRosenberg's crypto-bashing echoes the critique he made to Business Insider last year. He underscored that token prices can swing 20% or 30% within weeks.\n\n\"Why introduce that to your portfolio unless you're a gambler?\" he questioned at the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, he emphasized the difficult of gauging the worth of an asset that, unlike a business or a bond, doesn't yield a return for investors.\n\n\"I don't know how to value it,\" he said. \"Therefore, as they say on 'Shark Tank' \u2014 'I'm out.'\""

        "title": "1 Top Cryptocurrency to Buy Before It Soars 3,000% or More, According to Cathie Wood - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "According to Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood, the price of Bitcoin (BTC -6.56%) could soar to as high as $1.5 million by 2030. Given Bitcoin's current price of just under $50,000, that would represent a nearly 3,000% gain within a remarkably short period.\n\nAt first glance, this $1.5 million price target might strike you as outlandish. After all, in its entire 15-year history, Bitcoin has only reached a high of $69,000 -- and that was during the extremely frothy and speculative crypto bull market of 2020-2021. But, as Wood points out, two key catalysts could lead to Bitcoin skyrocketing in value. Let's take a closer look.\n\nThe new Bitcoin ETF\n\nThe obvious starting point is the new spot Bitcoin ETF product. Ark Invest is one of the investment firms that received approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF, so it's no surprise that Wood is extremely bullish on what this means for the long-term growth of Bitcoin. As she recently pointed out on CNBC, the SEC just gave the \"green light\" for both Wall Street and Main Street to invest in Bitcoin.\n\nConsidering that institutional investors have trillions of dollars in assets under management, it won't take a lot to move the needle. For example, if institutional investors such as pension funds and endowment funds decide to allocate just 1% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, the ramifications could be enormous. It could result in billions of dollars flowing into Bitcoin.\n\nAt the same time, wealth managers and financial planners could start advising their clients to consider allocating a portion of their portfolios to Bitcoin. That, too, could lead to an influx of new money flowing into Bitcoin. Most likely, this would occur over a longer period, and probably won't have as dramatic an effect as, say, BlackRock Inc. (BLK -2.08%) flipping the switch on $10 trillion in assets under management.\n\nBitcoin use cases\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin has an expanding array of use cases that make it valuable. Remember -- Bitcoin is not just a financial asset, it's also a technological innovation based on blockchain technology. The most obvious use case right now is acting as a store of value. Many crypto investors refer to Bitcoin as \"digital gold\" precisely because it appears to be a long-term store of value, similar to physical gold.\n\nBut there are a handful of other use cases for Bitcoin that you might not have considered. In Ark Invest's \"Big Ideas 2023\" report, the investment firm lays out eight different use cases for Bitcoin. For each of these use cases, the firm applies several different projections and estimates for just how big the market opportunity might become.\n\nFor example, the base case scenario in the Ark Invest report is for institutional investors to allocate 1% of their portfolios to Bitcoin. But the bull case scenario calls for institutional investors to allocate as much as 6.5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin. The more that institutional investors buy (literally) into the idea of Bitcoin, the higher Bitcoin could go in the medium to long term.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\n\nBased on the above, Bitcoin would seem to be unstoppable. No wonder Cathie Wood recently doubled down on her $1.5 million price estimate for Bitcoin. But just keep in mind that Bitcoin is rarely predictable and often highly volatile. So while the long-term macro trend might be for Bitcoin to soar in value, there is sure to be plenty of turbulence along the way.\n\nOne of the primary risks to Bitcoin has always been regulatory risk. Simply stated, the SEC could decide to pull the plug on Bitcoin at any moment. The large-scale approval of so many different spot Bitcoin ETF products at one time would appear to signal that the SEC is finally OK with the idea of investors buying Bitcoin. But what if the new ETFs perform erratically, or there are major glitches in how Bitcoin trades in the crypto market as a result of so much new money entering the market so quickly?\n\nThat being said, I agree with Wood that a \"building block\" model for Bitcoin valuation -- in which all the use case projections for Bitcoin are summed up and then aggregated -- makes a lot of sense. And I agree that spot Bitcoin ETF approval is almost certain to lead to billions of new dollars flowing into Bitcoin. The big question, though, is just how long it will take Bitcoin to reach that mythical $1 million price target."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nCathie Wood is bullish on cryptocurrencies, predicting a substantial growth of the entire crypto asset class.\n\nArk Invest is launching five separate crypto ETFs.\n\nEthereum is poised to outperform Bitcoin in the long run due to its multifaceted role in the evolving digital economy.\n\nCathie Wood, the CEO of ARK Invest, is known for her bullish stance on cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nIn a recent interview , Wood articulated her conviction in the potential of these digital assets, predicting a substantial growth of the entire crypto asset class from $1 trillion today to $25 trillion over the next five to seven years.\n\nWood Declares Confidence in Crypto with New ETF Launch\n\nARK Invest is launching five separate crypto ETFs , including a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF and a spot Ethereum (ETH) ETF. Wood\u2019s enthusiasm started in the mid-2010s, when it had a market cap of about $6 billion. The involvement of economist Art Laffer , who praised Bitcoin for its rules-based monetary policy, significantly influenced her perspective.\n\nWood\u2019s focus is particularly interesting when it comes to Ethereum. She acknowledges Ethereum\u2019s burgeoning role in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), recognizing its ability to satisfy the unmet need for yield in the financial markets. This view is underscored by the current state of fixed income markets , where the search for yield has reached unprecedented levels.\n\nFurthermore, Wood emphasizes the importance of following the developers in the crypto space. By this metric, Ethereum stands out, with its ecosystem supporting a wide range of applications. Vitalik Buterin\u2019s blockchain\u2019s holds DeFi and NFTs, and attracts a large community of developers. This aspect of Ethereum, combined with its potential in empowering the creator community, contributes to Wood\u2019s optimism about its future.\n\nCathie Wood expects #Ethereum will most likely outperform Bitcoin in the next Bull Run. pic.twitter.com/FEK9YAIZWo \u2014 Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) January 15, 2024\n\nWood\u2019s bullish stance on Ethereum does not overshadow her confidence in Bitcoin. She sees both cryptocurrencies as having a bright future, highlighting the importance of investing during times of volatility, which she believes strengthens the credibility and investor confidence in these digital assets.\n\nWood also touches upon the broader economic context, discussing monetary policies and trust issues in traditional finance. She suggests cryptocurrencies, with their decentralized and transparent nature, offer a more trustworthy alternative in the current economic climate.\n\nEthereum Poised to Outperform Bitcoin\n\nIn terms of long-term predictions, ARK Invest\u2019s \u201cBig Ideas\u201d presentations provide ambitious forecasts for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. In their 2023 presentation, they laid out three scenarios for Bitcoin, ranging from a bear case of $258,000 to a bull case of $1.48 million by 2030. For Ethereum, their 2022 forecast envisages a market cap that could exceed $20 trillion by 2032, potentially valuing each ETH at more than $166,000."

        "title": "Bitcoin ETF Approval a \u2018Sell the News\u2019 Event - Brave New Coin Insights",
        "content": "Bitcoin ETF Approval a \u2018Sell the News\u2019 Event\n\nThe SEC's approval of 11 Bitcoin ETFs has proven to be a 'buy the rumor, sell the news' trading event. Will an Ethereum ETF be the same?\n\nAfter touching two-year price highs following spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in the US last week on Wednesday, the price of BTC dropped sharply to below US$42,000 on Friday. The +10% slide leaves BTC down ~2.2% in the last week.\n\nLast week, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 spot ETFs for the first time. Approved issuers include giants from the investing world, such as Blackrock, Fidelity, and Ark. Currently, Fees on the products range from 0 (many issuers are offering zero fees in the first few months post-launch) to 1.5% on the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF.\n\nOn Thursday, the spot ETFs opened with a strong market reaction. On the first day of trading, the eleven approved spot BTC ETFs recorded US$4.6 billion worth of trading volume across 700,000 trades. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas described Thursday as \u2014 \u201cEasily the biggest Day One splash in ETF history.\u201d\n\nInitially, the price of BTC jumped on news that the ETFs had been approved and the open was received with strong market demand. By Friday the price of BTC touched US$49,000 on some exchanges, cementing a two-year price high for the asset. This euphoria, however, was to be short-lived.\n\nThe price of BTC tanked over the weekend in what appeared to be a clear \u2018buy the rumor, sell the news reaction.\u2019 The classic maxim refers to traders making a buy based on speculation surrounding upcoming news events or releases, and then selling when it is clear the event has materialized. Traders buying into the speculation can purchase the asset or security before everyone else and then sell as soon as the influx arrives, capturing short-term profits and avoiding any potential risks that the news event is underwhelming or mishandled.\n\nA driver of the selling pressure was news that much of the ETF volume on Thursday was likely bearish. Half of the spot ETF volume on Thursday came from the converted Grayscale product, about US$2.3 billion. This surprised many and some suggested a chunk of this volume was selling. \u201cVery easy argument to be made that a ton of this volume was the selling of [Grayscale\u2019s fund] and buying of other ETFs for now,\u201d Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said.\n\nGary Gensler Likely Cast The Deciding Bitcoin ETF Vote\n\nThe SEC\u2019s ETF approvals, although expected due to legal and market pressure, still came as something of a surprise because of the agency\u2019s historical wariness of crypto investments. Since taking office, SEC chairman Gary Gensler has been particularly vocal about the risks tied to investing in crypto and frequently connected the asset class to frauds and scams.\n\nDespite his public skepticism, Gensler was one of three commissioners to approve the spot BTC ETF offerings. Gensler was likely the deciding vote, with the approval being passed 3-2. Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda approved the ETFs alongside Gensler, while Caroline Crenshaw and Jaime Liz\u00e1rraga dissented. This indicates how close the ETFs came to being rejected.\n\nIn a statement released after the ETFs were approved, Gensler was clear that the SEC does \u201capprove or endorse\u201d Bitcoin despite the approval. It appeared that a key factor in Gensler\u2019s approval was a key win for spot ETF applicant Grayscale in a court case with the SEC. The agency did not appeal a recent court ruling that determined the agency had acted \u201carbitrarily and capriciously\u201d in rejecting Grayscale\u2019s proposal to convert its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an Exchange Traded Funded (ETF). On Tuesday, August 29, 2023, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals made its ruling and ordered the SEC to review its decision and provide a clear rationale for its treatment of different types of Bitcoin-related products, including futures-based ETFs that it approved.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision to not appeal the loss opened the door for spot Bitcoin ETFs to be approved. Gensler wrote in a statement post ETF approval \u2014 \u201cWe are now faced with a new set of filings similar to those we have disapproved in the past. Circumstances, however, have changed. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that the Commission failed to adequately explain its reasoning in disapproving the listing and trading of Grayscale\u2019s proposed ETP (the Grayscale Order).\u201d He said for this reason and others including the ETFs listing on regulated, national securities exchanges, the ETFs were approved.\n\nAn Ethereum ETF?\n\n\n\nWhile BTC has lost value because of event-based selling, Ethereum (ETH) has surged. A key factor in this momentum is an expectation that, following the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF, a spot Ethereum ETF is next. Analysts at Bloomberg predicted that the odds of a spot Ether ETH being approved by May is 70%.\n\nMajor industry players including Vaneck, Blackrock, and Fidelity have all applied for spot Ethereum ETFs and these applications all have a final decision deadline of May 23rd. Some expect these to come sooner with several intermediary firms set for late January.\n\nIf we consider a similar \u2018Buy the Rumor, Sell the News\u2019 structure to the spot Bitcoin ETF cycle, ETH is still in the \u2018buy the rumor\u2019 and a price drop may occur when the expected approval does come. A factor in this confidence is asset manager Blackrock\u2019s exceptional record of ETF application approval which currently sits at 576-1.\n\nEthereum and the altcoin market have historically outperformed BTC in January. Since 2017, the average monthly return for Ether is a 26.7% gain. For BTC it is a 4.8% gain.\n\nThe ETF Fee War\n\nLast week, U.S. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) issuers finally disclosed their fees. There are now multiple Bitcoin Spot ETFs and the fees they charge are the primary way they compete with each other.\n\nMany of the issuers have continued to update their fees in the days leading up to approval, in a game of cat and mouse that has been described as the \u201cETF Terrordome\u201d, a reference to the ruthless, take-no-prisoners approach required to succeed at the sharp end of the asset management business.\n\nCharging the least is crypto-savvy fund manager Bitwise, with a fee of just 0.20% after a 6-month waiver period of no fees. Ark21Shares is next with a fee of 0.21%. Franklin is at 0.29%. BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, has set its fee at 0.25%. This is much lower than many had predicted, given BlackRock\u2019s brand power and market size.\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart wrote on X that, \u201cThe Bitcoin ETF fee war has sharp elbows. These fees are sooo low and the ETFs will trade ABSURDLY tight (penny wide bid-ask spreads) and without any commissions on most platforms.\u201d\n\nGrayscale, however, which plans to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF, has the highest fee at 1.5%. However, they have included a clause about the ability to waive fees. Plus, Grayscale already has $28 billion of assets under management (AUM) whereas the other applicants are starting from a position of zero.\n\nWhat\u2019s clear is that the lower-than-expected Bitcoin ETF fees are good news for investors, and they will put pressure on crypto exchange fees. U.S exchanges such as Kraken and Coinbase will now be competing with the ETF providers, and for those wishing to invest in Bitcoin, the ETFs look very attractive indeed.\n\nA Wild Week of Mixed Signals\n\nIt has been a wild week in the lead-up to today\u2019s Bitcoin ETF approval, with mixed signals, false reporting, an SEC hack, and a series of botched announcements by the SEC and the exchanges involved.\n\nPerhaps it is a sign of today\u2019s hyper-connected, extremely online world, and the average person won\u2019t have noticed, but the denizens of crypto twitter have ridden an emotional rollercoaster this week, as official announcements appeared and then disappeared on various websites and exchanges.\n\nThe SEC has fought hard to get its ducks in a row, but ultimately it was the wisdom of the market that proved correct. Bitcoin failed to move much on final revelation, showing that the market has indeed priced in the ETF approvals. For now, at least.\n\nIn a series of events yesterday that were memorably described as a goat rodeo, the official SEC X Account appeared to announce that Bitcoin Spot ETFs had been approved.\n\nHowever, 15 minutes later the SEC head Gary Gensler announced, \u201cThe @SECGov Twitter account was compromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products.\u201d\n\nThe price of Bitcoin surged quickly to $47,600 after the bogus announcement before dropping to around $45,500 after Gensler said \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll leave the final word on this to Edward Snowden.\n\nGary Gensler Sounds a Warning\n\nAlso this week, SEC Head Gary Gensler published a thread on X, stating that \u201cThose offering crypto asset investments/services may not be complying w/ applicable law, including federal securities laws. Investors in crypto asset securities should understand they may be deprived of key info & other important protections in connection w/ their investment.\u201d\n\nGensler wrote, \u201cInvestments in crypto assets also can be exceptionally risky & are often volatile. A number of major platforms & crypto assets have become insolvent and/or lost value. Investments in crypto assets continue to be subject to significant risk.\u201d\n\nGensler\u2019s thread concluded with \u201cFraudsters continue to exploit the rising popularity of crypto assets to lure retail investors into scams. These investments continue to be replete w/ fraud- bogus coin offerings, Ponzi & pyramid schemes, & outright theft where a project promoter disappears w/ investors\u2019 money.\u201d\n\nGensler is committed to being seen as the responsible adult in the room when it comes to protecting American investors.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs: Unlocking Opportunities\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETFs, which track the actual price of BTC rather than its derivatives like Bitcoin futures, represent a breakthrough for the U.S. market. While such ETFs have gained approval in Europe, Canada, and Brazil, the SEC has previously rejected applications due to concerns about potential market manipulation.\n\nThe approval of eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. is a milestone for crypto investors and an opportunity for financial advisors. These ETFs, renowned for their efficiency and popularity, could unlock a $50 trillion market across financial advisors, retail investors, and private banks, fostering market maturity and institutional investor confidence.\n\nWhile the underwhelming price action today shows that the market has indeed priced in the ETF approvals, what happens next could surprise.\n\nBIoomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has reported that BlackRock may break the first-day ETF flow record with a $2 billion asset injection on the first day of trading for its spot Bitcoin ETF. That would be a strong catalyst for the Bitcoin market and suggest momentum is just getting started.\n\nNew Year, New Opportunity for Bitcoin Investors\n\nAs the crypto community celebrates the SEC\u2019s decision to finally approve spot Bitcoin ETFs, the cryptocurrency market is poised for an extended bull run. The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs coincides with a potential demand shock for Bitcoin with the April 2024 halving, offering investors a unique confluence of factors that historically result in favorable outcomes.\n\nThe question is, how will the market respond? As Bitcoin has already experienced a 61% rally since early October, driven in large part by heightened expectations of approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs, some market observers are forecasting a sell-the-news-induced pullback.\n\nComparisons are drawn to past market events, such as the debut of CME Bitcoin futures in December 2017, Coinbase\u2019s Nasdaq listing in mid-April 2021, and the introduction of various futures ETFs, including BITO. Historical trends indicate that Bitcoin, following rallying periods during these events, experienced subsequent crashes in the weeks that followed.\n\nFor instance, the three days leading up to the SEC\u2019s approval of the first futures ETFs saw Bitcoin surge by 15%. However, a month later, the cryptocurrency reached a record high of $69,000 before plummeting into a bear market that endured for over a year. Analysts caution that historical precedents suggest a potential post-ETF approval downturn, emphasizing the importance of monitoring market dynamics in the aftermath of regulatory decisions.\n\nOthers are more bullish, however, with the likes of Max Keiser and Samson Mow predicting billions of dollars of new flow into Bitcoin once the ETFs start trading. And of course, the rumored two billion in immediate inflows from BlackRock.\n\nAlso very bullish, is a new report from Standard Chartered Bank predicting significant inflows into the spot ETFs.\n\nThe bank predicts inflows of $50 billion to $100 billion this year, meaning that between 436,000 and 1.3 million bitcoins will be held in U.S. ETFs by the end of this year.\n\nAt that volume of new inflows, Standard Chartered said Bitcoin could reach US$200,000 by the end of 2025.\n\nNow that the ETFs are approved, expect a marketing war to begin, with the various asset managers competing to communicate Bitcoin\u2019s narrative to an army of financial managers.\n\nIn the long term, nothing could be more bullish for Bitcoin."

        "title": "Bitcoin tumbled after ETFs launched. What it means for crypto miners - CNBC",
        "content": "Investors in bitcoin mining stocks are closely watching the price of the cryptocurrency after the Securities and Exchange Commission's move to allow spot bitcoin ETFs became a sell-the-news event. After the ETFs received regulatory approval last week, the flagship currency briefly touched $49,000. As the week went on, however, bitcoin wiped out its earlier gains and notched a modest weekly loss of 0.01%. Crypto mining companies are now feeling the squeeze in this latest bitcoin sell-off \u2013 and that's evident in the big week-to-date declines for Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms , both of which lost more than 20%. First, the hash rate \u2013 the amount of computing power the Bitcoin network uses to process transactions \u2013 has been hitting all-time highs almost every week and hurting miners' margins, according to Reginald Smith, analyst at JPMorgan. The network hash rate has increased more than 30% over the last four months, he said, rising alongside bitcoin's 157% ascent in 2023. Second, investors are watching bitcoin's price in the wake of the ETFs' debut because if the crypto doesn't rise to a range of $50,000 and $55,000 soon, smaller miners may not have sufficient capital to grow and may have difficulty maintaining their operations. \"Miners who are at the lower end of the cost curve with limited amounts of debt and plenty of liquidity between bitcoin and cash on their balance sheets are going to be ones that fare the best in 2024,\" said Chase White, an analyst at Compass White. \"But it could be a hard time in the middle of the year as miners play the prisoner's dilemma game of who needs to turn off their machines and who doesn't.\" \"The older, less efficient miners are way less profitable, but they're still just profitable enough to stay online, hurting everybody's margin,\" he said. \"If [the bitcoin price] gets to $45,000 or below only the newest, most efficient miners with the \u2026 lowest cost power are going to be able to stay online.\" A dynamic in focus This dynamic between the bitcoin price and the mining companies is coming into focus in anticipation of the Bitcoin halving, when the reward for mining the flagship crypto is cut in half, as designed in the Bitcoin code, to reduce its supply. Because of the supply cut, the halving historically sets the stage for big price rallies in the following six to nine months. However, the reduction in the reward also means miners' revenue takes a hit. Overall, analysts are fairly optimistic that bitcoin will rise as expected due to three key catalysts: the ETF, the halving and potential interest rate cuts. \"The catalyst of the ETF and, a little bit later in the year, the potential for rate cuts, could lead bitcoin to run a lot faster than the global hash rate can run, which could alleviate a lot of this problem,\" White said. \"But it needs to rise above $50,000 for that to be the case, and we think we can get there.\" Compass White's year-end price target right now for bitcoin is $75,000. White said private miners will likely struggle the most because it's harder for them to access capital than the publicly traded miners, which can sell stock in at-the-market programs. He named Riot Platforms, Iris Energy , Cipher Mining and Bitfarms as some of his picks. JPMorgan's top pick is Iris Energy. The firm is neutral on Cipher, CleanSpark and Riot, although Smith said he's incrementally constructive on Riot, which is more actively traded and he sees as a long-term winner. Last week, Iris Energy and Cipher dropped more than 16% each. In a note earlier in the week, Smith suggested there may be weakness after the ETF approval \u2013 likely driven by technical selling pressure, rather than fundamental miner economics, since institutional investors now have other ways to express a view on bitcoin with the introduction of ETFs. \"We would view any sell-off [in mining stocks] as a buying opportunity, as the ETF does not directly impact mining economics or change competitive dynamics, and we remain bullish on bitcoin and bitcoin miners in 2024,\" he wrote."

        "title": "Three unexpected risks from Wall Street's foray into bitcoin - The Block",
        "content": "Bitcoin BTC -6.66% has officially gone mainstream in the U.S. after the approval of 11 spot bitcoin ETFs. Products by issuers such as BlackRock, Fidelity and Bitwise debuted on Thursday and exceeded $7 billion in cumulative trading volume over the first two days of trading.\n\nFor years, the crypto industry has been waiting for this approval to bring a huge inflow of fresh funds into the market, which is now open to the largest legacy finance firms and crypto-curious retail investors who are not ready for the technicalities of crypto.\n\nHowever, bitcoin meeting Wall Street has its risks, too. Some long-time bitcoiners point at potentially increasing concentration of bitcoin ownership in the hands of a small group of institutions, potential rehypothecation and changes in the way the bitcoin community governs itself.\n\nA single point of failure\n\n\n\nThe most obvious concern noticed by many prominent crypto individuals is that all the bitcoins backing the ETF shares will be held by only a handful of assigned custodians. Most of the issuers listed Coinbase as their custodian, with exceptions of VanEck, who chose Gemini, and Fidelity with its own custody product.\n\nJameson Lopp, co-founder and CTO of a bitcoin custody firm Casa, points out that in such situation, the custodian becomes a single point of failure and there are \u201crelatively few \u2018doors\u2019 that would need to be knocked upon by government agencies,\u201d if they wanted to seize the bitcoin locked in the ETFs, he told The Block.\n\nJeffrey Ross, the founder and managing director of an asset management firm Vailshire Capital, believes this concern is \u201coverblown.\u201d Theoretically, there is a risk of a custodian to make a mistake and lose large amounts of clients\u2019 bitcoin, but large finance firms like the current ETF issuers have measures in place to prevent such accidents from happening, he told The Block.\n\nAs for a potential government seizure, people draw analogies with the Roosevelt-era ban on gold ownership. However, back then, the U.S. dollar was backed by gold, making it an essential component of monetary policy, and bitcoin is not in the same position, Ross said. \u201cThere is no reason for the government to seize bitcoin from Americans,\u201d he added.\n\nA new type of double-spending attack\n\n\n\nAnother potential concern can be the so-called financialization of bitcoin, or the transfer of practices from traditional finance into the bitcoin economy, which until now has been functioning more or less by its own standards.\n\n\u201cThe ETFs are a double-edged sword for the bitcoin ecosystem,\u201d says Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Custodia. \u201cThe big drawback is that new forms of leverage-based financialization of bitcoin will happen. The SEC did the right thing by prohibiting custodians from lending the bitcoin that backs the ETF units, but there will be commingling, collateral substitution and leverage on the layer above that,\u201d Long told The Block.\n\nBitcoin-based securities will essentially create bitcoin IOUs (\u201cI owe you\u201d), says Casa\u2019s Lopp. This means that with ETFs, instead of actual bitcoins stored in hardware and software wallets, people will own something that represents the value of bitcoin but has none of its essential properties like decentralization, permissionless nature and visibility on a public ledger.\n\n\u201cSince you can't verify a company's balance sheet, you can't be sure that your IOU is redeemable for the asset it represents,\u201d Lopp said in a blog post last year.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nAs Long points out in a post on X, there are examples of Wall Street firms artificially inflating the supplies of stocks by buying and selling non-existent shares. Now they can try and pull the same tricks with bitcoin.\n\nVailshire Capital\u2019s Ross says the current design of the ETFs approved by the SEC does not allow the issuers to loan the bitcoin backing the ETFs. However, with time, more complex derivatives can be created on top of these ETFs \u2014 which could open the doors for more reckless behavior. Already, one of the bitcoin ETF issuers, Grayscale, has filed an application with the SEC for a covered-call ETF, which is designed to generate income from a position in its GBTC ETF.\n\n\u201cYou will have to trust that the SEC is monitoring that, but the SEC also has a track record of not monitoring things well,\u201d Ross said. He is both pessimistic and optimistic about this concern. The transparency of public blockchains mean that companies could chose to make their holdings public. But companies are unlikely to provide this information unless the public demands it. And it will only demand it, Ross argued, if someone screws up.\n\n\u201cIn 2025-2026, there will be some Wall Street rug pull related to bitcoin,\u201d Ross reckons.\n\nGovernance wars\n\nYet another concern being discussed is that the ETF issuing and trading institutions, which will accumulate a lot of bitcoin and gain some authority in the bitcoin community, wil start trying to influence how the bitcoin protocol is maintained going forward.\n\nFor instance, if the bitcoin blockchain is forked into two significant camps, this could be problematic for ETF issuers who are currently forced to disregard the proceeds from any forks (or airdrops) \u2014 potentially leaving them with a less valuable asset underlying their ETFs. They may be incentivized to dampen momentum for any such forks.\n\nCasa\u2019s Lopp believes this idea is far-fetched. In the bitcoin \u201cblocksize war\u201d of 2016-2018, mining and crypto service companies became a voice in favor of forking bitcoin and increasing the maximum block size. However, they did not prevail and the bitcoin community opted to keep the block size as it was.\n\nThe difference between now and then is that, unlike companies that became active in the bitcoin scaling debate of the past, the ETF issuers won't be making many on-chain transactions and interacting with the bitcoin protocol as such. \u201cSo hopefully they will be less incentivized to become activists in the area of protocol development,\u201d Lopp said.\n\nRoss, however, expects a new governance war to erupt some time after 2025. \u201c[ETF issuers] will definitely try to make changes but that won\u2019t matter,\u201d Ross said. \u201cThey will probably try to switch to proof-of-stake or to change the fixed supply [of bitcoins] but there is almost no chance the true bitcoiners will allow this to happen,\u201d he added.\n\nThe silver lining is, bitcoin ETFs are only a temporary fix for the transition phase, during which most people will switch from traditional financial instruments to bitcoin, Ross believes. The baby boomer generation currently owns the most wealth, but their children will not need an intermediary between them and bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThe longer people own bitcoin the more they will be incentivized to learn what bitcoin actually is. The younger generation will inherit the wealth of their parents and they will sell these ETFs and buy bitcoin,\u201d said Ross."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $42,000 for the second time over the weekend after failing to break above $43,100 amid subdued trading volumes after the ETF hype at the end of last week.\n\nAs of press time, BTC was trading at $41,870 on most of the large exchanges. The price is still above the key support level of $40,250; however, sell pressure continues to mount before the Asian markets open for trading.\n\nThe flagship crypto experienced $23.68 million in liquidations over the past 24 hours, roughly 85% of which were longs \u2014 equating to $20.11 million, according to CoinGlass data.\n\nThe liquidations largely affected traders on prominent exchanges, with Binance and OKX bearing the brunt, witnessing liquidations of $7.51 million and $5.26 million, respectively.\n\nSell the news\n\nThe approval and launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs initially led to a surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price, reaching around $49,000. However, following the excitement, there has been a notable downturn in the price, partly due to market reactions typical of \u201csell the news\u201d events.\n\nThis kind of market behavior often occurs when there is a build-up of anticipation for an event (like the launch of ETFs), followed by a quick sell-off after the actual event.\n\nFrom a technical analysis perspective, Bitcoin was showing signs of buyer exhaustion and increased selling pressure. Analysts observing indicators like the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) noted that Bitcoin was trading at key resistance levels, suggesting a potential price correction.\n\nThese technical signals can often lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy as traders and investors react to them.\n\nETF issuers buying the dip\n\nMeanwhile, the ETF issuers have reportedly bought 23,000 BTC amid the downturn, with BlackRock accounting for 11,500 Bitcoin. It is unclear whether the interest in these products will continue to gain traction or if the weekend lull is a precursor to the coming days.\n\nExperts believe that if these institutions continue scooping up Bitcoin at similar levels, it will likely lead to a supply crunch within a few months and could push the price to new highs.\n\nHowever, the market has been wary of outflows from Grayscale\u2019s GBTC ETF, whose holders have been underwater since 2022 and are likely looking for an opportunity to sell as they are made whole.\n\nBitcoin Market Data At the time of press 12:14 am UTC on Jan. 15, 2024, Bitcoin is ranked #1 by market cap and the price is down 2.04% over the past 24 hours.

        "title": "Bitcoin price crumbles after spot ETF approval, but ICP, TIA, MNT, SEI and altcoins rebound - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "There was a lot of hype built around the spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds, but when regulatory approval did not result in an upside move, traders may have decided to book profits, resulting in a sharp pullback to $41,500.\n\nSome analysts have turned bearish and are projecting targets of $25,000 and lower on Bitcoin. While anything is possible in the markets, levels near $38,000 are likely to attract long-term investors who will keep an eye on the Bitcoin halving and the institutional inflows into the spot Bitcoin ETFs in the coming weeks.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in a X (formerly Twitter) post on Jan. 13 that the newly launched ETFs witnessed inflows of $1.4 billion, while the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) saw an outflow of $579 million. Still, the net inflows in two trading sessions across the ETFs were $819 million.\n\nCould the inflows into Bitcoin ETFs reverse the slide in Bitcoin and altcoins? Let\u2019s look at the charts of the top 5 cryptocurrencies that may outperform in the near term.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin has been all over the place in the past few days. The failure to sustain the price above $48,000 may have tempted short-term traders to book profits, which started a sharp fall on Jan. 12.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls and the bears are witnessing a tough battle near the support line of the ascending triangle pattern. Although buyers have managed to defend the support line on a closing basis, they have failed to start a meaningful recovery. This suggests that the bears are maintaining their pressure.\n\nThe 20-day exponential moving average ($43,933) has started to turn down, and the relative strength index (RSI) is just below the midpoint, indicating that the bears are attempting a comeback.\n\nIf the price maintains below the triangle, the BTC/USDT pair could slump to $40,000 and then to $37,980. Buyers will have to propel the price above $44,700 to regain control.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-EMA has turned down on the 4-hour chart, and the RSI is in the negative territory, indicating that the bears have the upper hand. If the price breaks below $42,000, the selling could pick up, and the pair may plummet to $41,500 and then to $40,000.\n\nIf bulls want to prevent the downside, they will have to push the price above the 20-EMA. That will clear the path for a rally to $44,700, which remains the crucial overhead resistance for the bulls to overcome.\n\nInternet Computer price analysis\n\nInternet Computer (ICP) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($12.11) on Jan. 8 and again on Jan. 13, indicating that the bulls are fiercely defending the level.\n\nICP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe upsloping moving averages indicate an advantage to buyers, but the negative divergence on the RSI suggests that the bullish momentum may be slowing down. A break and close above $14.21 could open the doors for a retest of the high at $16.30. If this level is cleared, the next stop is likely to be $18.\n\nThe 20-day EMA remains the critical support to watch out for on the downside. If this level is taken out, the advantage will tilt in favor of the bears. The ICP/USDT pair may then plunge to $9.36.\n\nThe pair has been consolidating between $12 and $14 for some time. This suggests indecision between the bulls and the bears. If buyers kick the price above $14, the pair could accelerate toward $16.30.\n\nContrarily, if the price skids below the moving averages, it will suggest that the bears are selling on rallies. The price may then retest the support at $12. A break below this level will open the doors for a slide to $10.\n\nCelestia price analysis\n\nCelestia (TIA) has been in a strong uptrend for several days, indicating that every minor dip is being purchased.\n\nTIA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThere is a minor psychological resistance at $20, where the TIA/USDT pair may witness a pullback. If buyers do not allow the price to slip below $17.29, it will indicate that the bulls are trying to flip the level into support. That will improve the prospects of a break above $20. The pair may then ascend to $25.\n\nConversely, if the price turns down sharply and slumps below $17.29, it will suggest that the traders are aggressively booking profits. The bears will then sense an opportunity and try to yank the pair to the 20-day EMA ($14.89).\n\nThe pair picked up momentum after breaking above the $17.29 resistance. Hence, this remains the key level to watch out for on the downside. Any pullback is likely to find support at the 20-EMA.\n\nIf the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, it will suggest that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. The pair may then start the next leg of the uptrend toward $23. The short-term advantage will favor the bears if they yank the pair below $17.29. The next support is at the 50-SMA.\n\nRelated: Google Play Store in India blocks Binance, OKX in response to FIU notice\n\nMantle price analysis\n\nMantle (MNT) broke above the ascending channel pattern on Jan. 10 and rallied sharply to $0.85 on Jan. 11, but the long wick on the day\u2019s candlestick shows profit-booking at higher levels.\n\nMNT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe price has reached the breakout level from the channel, where buyers are expected to step in. Both moving averages are sloping up gradually, indicating that bulls have the upper hand, but the negative divergence on the RSI warrants caution.\n\nIf the price rebounds off the breakout level from the channel, the buyers will again try to kick the MNT/USDT pair to $0.85. This level is likely to act as a major hurdle, but if crossed, the pair could surge to $1.\n\nThe bulls tried to stall the correction at the 20-EMA, but the bears had other plans. They sold the bounce near $0.78 and pulled the price to the 50-SMA. Any recovery attempt is likely to face selling at the 20-EMA. The bulls will have to shove the price above the overhead resistance zone between the 20-EMA and $0.78 to signal strength.\n\nInstead, if the price continues lower and breaks below the 50-SMA, it will indicate that the uptrend may be over. The pair then risks a fall to $0.65 and eventually to $0.58.\n\nSei price analysis\n\nSei (SEI) has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision between the bulls and the bears.\n\nSEI/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nGenerally, the symmetrical triangle acts as a continuation pattern, but on rare occasions, it may behave as a reversal pattern.\n\nThe rising 20-day EMA ($0.64) and the RSI in the positive zone indicate that buyers have the edge. If bulls thrust the price above the resistance line, it will mark the resumption of the uptrend. The pattern target of this setup is $1.10.\n\nThis positive view will be invalidated if the SEI/USDT pair continues lower and plunges below the triangle. That will signal a potential trend change and the start of a deeper correction toward the 50-day SMA ($0.43).\n\nThe moving averages have flattened out, and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. It is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout from a triangle. Hence it is better to wait for the price to rise above or fall below the triangle before initiating large bets.\n\nIf the price stays above the moving averages, the bulls will try to push the pair to the resistance line. On the other hand, if the price slips below the moving averages, the pair may drop to the support line.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Does Your Financial Advisor Speak Crypto? - Investopedia",
        "content": "It\u2019s almost impossible to avoid frequent headlines declaring that Bitcoin or some other new cryptocurrency is the gold standard of the new world of digital assets. Nobody wants to miss out on a gold rush, but Bitcoin isn\u2019t gold, and neither are its rivals. However, just as with gold mining, crypto mining involves expending energy to acquire something that, depending on the coin\u2019s inflation schedule, may have finite availability.\n\nIn early 2024, there were more than 9,000 active cryptocurrencies. What may be surprising is that in a 2022 study by Investopedia regarding financial literacy, 49% of adults, when asked how well they understood crypto, said they were \u201cbeginners.\u201d\n\nWhere does this leave the individual who believes in the future of these crypto assets but can\u2019t figure out how to invest in them? A modern financial advisor who is well-versed in crypto can help you make sense of this relatively new landscape.\n\nKey Takeaways Many financial advisors are not well-versed in crypto and hesitate to recommend it to clients.\n\nThere is no industry standard for crypto certification like there is with the Certified Financial Planner (CFP) designation.\n\nDespite crypto having a market capitalization in the trillions, many are wary of calling it an \u201cinvestable asset\u201d and consider it more gambling than an investment vehicle.\n\nAlmost half of American adults do not understand digital assets beyond a beginner level.\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results. This common saying should be on the mind of every crypto investor and advisor.\n\nIs Crypto Investing or Gambling?\n\nThere is no consensus (pun intended) on whether crypto is gambling or investing. It seems it can fill both roles, depending on who is buying it, how informed they are, and their strategy behind the purchase. Financial advisors are more likely to tell you it resembles gambling, but investors who have experienced growth using crypto might claim differently.\n\nHowever, even among investment advisors who like alternative assets that tend to move independently of the S&P 500 Index, you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find many willing to suggest putting a chunk of your portfolio into any of the cryptocurrencies. Most wealth managers are steering clients clear of crypto for two reasons, listed below.\n\nYour Advisor Is Skeptical\n\nSome advisors might not view cryptocurrency as an asset, something most of their clients should stay away from unless they have money that they can afford to lose\u2014and don't mind losing.\n\nCryptocurrencies may be thrilling to watch, but an advisor could put their client in a bad position by recommending placing money in a new financial product without any real understanding of how it works\u2014this really is gambling.\n\nYour Advisor Is Trying to Protect You\n\nAlthough an advisor may be deeply knowledgeable about crypto, the advisor may not provide any recommendations on whether to buy or sell any digital currency. The advisor is not alone in this way of thinking. The reason is that an advisor\u2019s job is not to sell transactions but rather to manage their clients\u2019 money and expectations.\n\nWanting to protect advisory clients, sometimes from themselves, the advisor screens out the noise in the market and steers them away from the many cryptocurrency scams that have cropped up. To put that in perspective, crypto scammers stole some $10 billion in 2021 and $5.9 billion in 2022. Crypto scams and crime are dropping, but millions of dollars in cryptocurrency are still being stolen.\n\nAdvisors Are Hesitant to Recommend Crypto\n\nMany clients ask how they can invest in crypto because they\u2019ve heard how much money they could make. The problem with this thinking is that cryptocurrencies are so volatile that investing in them while the volatility continues is essentially gambling.\n\nA better way to think about cryptocurrencies is to focus on the technology behind them: the blockchain. The blockchain is more or less a distributed ledger. Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency because it was the first viable one and has the highest market cap.\n\nBlockchain technology was originally developed with payment processing in mind, but in reality, there are a lot of truly solid potential uses for it. Some possibilities include digital identity, data tokenization, data management, and secure audit trails.\n\nBe sure to keep track of your cryptocurrency passwords. If you lose them or don\u2019t leave them to your heirs, no one can access the tokens you\u2019ve acquired.\n\nCFP Board Cautious About Crypto Assets\n\nAs of December 2022, advisors are free to talk to their clients about cryptocurrencies. However, the influential Certified Financial Planner (CFP) Board of Standards urged any CFPs considering offering advice on cryptocurrency-related assets to do so cautiously.\n\nIn a Nov. 30, 2022 notice, which will have been closely read by CFPs and the wider financial advisor community, the entity responsible for overseeing professional standards stated that cryptocurrencies should be treated with greater scrutiny than more conventional financial assets as they \u201chave particular attributes and present significant risks and uncertainties that warrant careful analysis.\u201d\n\nAmong other things, the CFP Board noted that cryptocurrency-related assets are generally:\n\nDifficult to analyze\n\nHard to value\n\nAt risk of getting stolen and more susceptible to heavy losses\n\nSpeculative and volatile\n\nThe CFP Board mentioned that this update had been planned for a while, and interestingly, alongside laying out the risks, it chose to remind CFP professionals that they are not required or obligated in any way to provide financial advice about cryptocurrency-related assets. It\u2019s likely that the CFP Board is aware that an increasing number of CFPs are asked by their clients about these types of investments and wanted to remind them to be extra careful before giving in to these requests.\n\nIn the end, this notice didn\u2019t result in any rule changes for CFPs. However, it clarified the risks of crypto assets and possibly made financial advisors even more cautious about advising clients on these types of investments.\n\nWhat Your Financial Advisor Can Do\n\nIn an ideal world, you would turn to your financial advisor, ask about adding some cryptocurrencies to your portfolio, and discuss which ones and how much. In the real world, most advisors don't even recognize them as an investable asset class and don't bother researching or analyzing them. Therefore, many are not able to talk about them.\n\nSo, where can you go for real advice about investing in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other cryptocurrency you're considering? You can always fall back on the less-than-5% rule, a simple guideline that dictates not putting more than 5% of your portfolio into any high-risk category. Even then, at this point, you'll have to get a little creative in your quest for crypto investments if you're working with most financial advisors.\n\nDifferent Ways to Get in This Market\n\nHowever, there is more than one way to participate in cryptocurrencies, and not all of them involve buying the digital assets directly. Some knowledgeable advisors would rather take one of these indirect approaches instead of actually helping you own cryptocurrency.\n\nYour financial advisor might go for one or more of the following alternatives:\n\nRemember, like betting on a horse race, the amount of money you\u2019re willing to risk on cryptocurrencies should be limited to the amount you can afford to lose. Of course, the high level of risk associated with crypto assets doesn\u2019t automatically mean that they\u2019re gambling and not an investment. There are plenty of so-called \u201creal\u201d assets that come with loads of risk as well.\n\nStill, if cryptocurrencies do take their place among conventional investments, then advisors will have to catch up with those who waded into the fray long before them.\n\nHow to Buy Crypto\n\nIf you\u2019ve spent time studying blockchain technology and want to invest in it for what it is\u2014instead of speculating and hoping for the best\u2014you may have to do the heavy lifting and buy the cryptocurrency yourself. To do so, you need a digital wallet to store your cryptocurrency keys securely.\n\nTo convert any cryptocurrency into cash, look for an exchange that supports trading the currency you want to purchase, such as San Francisco-based Coinbase, one of the more well-known exchanges. This digital currency exchange lets you buy and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto products in your local currency.\n\nDoes Your Advisor Understand Crypto Exchanges?\n\nNot all digital exchanges support all cryptocurrencies and/or all fiat currencies (the technical term for dollars, euros, yen, and other government-issued currencies). Start with well-known names such as Coinbase, Kraken, or Gemini, and do your homework before investing any cash. However, even the best crypto exchanges are not entirely without a blemish. Examine each exchange\u2019s history of freezing and closing accounts, outages, and close ties with some traditional banking establishments. Most importantly, look for an exchange that offers insurance coverage for any losses that are its fault.\n\nTo buy or sell cryptocurrencies, you only need to log into your account on the selected exchange, either in its mobile app or on its website. For maximum security, you may want to set up your own cryptocurrency wallet to hold the currency rather than use one provided through the site. Before starting, you\u2019ll want to learn the safest ways to store your bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat Is a Crypto Advisor? A crypto advisor is an asset manager who understands the workings of cryptocurrency and the appropriate ways to invest in it. As professionals who stay abreast of the rapid developments in cryptocurrency and blockchain, crypto advisors may be registered as investment advisors, registered representatives, or hold a credential like Certified Financial Planner (CFP) or Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA).\n\nHow Do You Become a Professional Cryptocurrency Advisor? As of January 2024, no \u201cofficial\u201d way to be licensed as a professional cryptocurrency advisor exists. However, most U.S. states are requiring that businesses retailing cryptocurrencies get licensed as a money transmitter business (MTB). Crypto retailers fit this definition, requiring licensing from the states and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Individuals are not required to get licensed to work at an MTB.\n\nWhy Might a Financial Advisor Recommend Cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrencies could be a good investment for those who believe in the future of digital currencies and those who wish to protect themselves in the online financial arena. Cryptocurrencies are also relatively immune to political manipulation. Finally, of course, if you have spare assets with which you want to speculate, then crypto is a great place to do it.\n\nHow Can You Find an Advisor Who Understands Crypto? Some advisors will list crypto on their website, but there is always the chance that they listed it strictly for marketing purposes. Feel free to ask them probing questions about blockchain or Bitcoin and see if they can engage in intelligent discussion. Some advisors wishing to be well-versed in crypto might pursue the Certified Digital Asset Advisor designation.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe rhetoric in this article will likely be adjusted continuously as the crypto landscape is still unfolding. New coins are added daily, and the once-niche concept of blockchain is gaining real-world traction and government attention.\n\nIt is becoming ever more important for financial advisors to understand the asset class, yet many are hesitant to do so, and even more will not recommend it. This makes finding an advisor well-versed in crypto difficult, but not impossible.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "title": "Spot Bitcoin ETF custody vs. exchange custody: What's the difference? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "As 10 asset managers in the United States have started trading billions in spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), investors might wonder how these issuers ensure that the underlying asset of their products is safe enough.\n\nDespite cryptocurrency exchanges losing comparatively less money to hacks over the past few years with new security improvements, the community witnessed multimillion-dollar attacks on exchanges like Poloniex in 2023. Is there anything that makes a spot Bitcoin ETF safer than trading on an exchange like Poloniex as a retail user?\n\nBitcoin custody products used by spot Bitcoin ETF providers are \u201cnothing like what retail gets access to\u201d on crypto exchanges, according to Ophelia Snyder, co-founder of 21Shares and its parent firm, 21.co.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re using Coinbase as a custodian for a U.S. product. Me putting money on Coinbase as Ophelia Snyder and me putting money on Coinbase as 21Shares, the products are structurally different,\u201d the executive said in an interview with Cointelegraph in early January.\n\n21Shares is one of the firms involved in the issuance of now-running spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, cooperating with ARK Invest on the ARK Invest and 21Shares spot Bitcoin ETF (ARKB). Based in Europe, 21.co and 21Shares also operate a wide number of crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) in the region and are one of the largest crypto ETP providers globally.\n\nWhen someone puts assets on an exchange as a retail user, trading platforms like Coinbase often put client assets on omnibus accounts, where user assets like Bitcoin are pooled together without strict segregation. \u201cIt\u2019s there with everybody else\u2019s money,\u201d Snyder noted, referring to such exchange accounts, adding that the spot Bitcoin ETFs by ARK and 21Shares uses strictly segregated accounts. She stated:\n\n\u201cOur money goes into a specific wallet that belongs to us. In our case, actually multiple wallets, because we don\u2019t want to have a single attack surface. That way, we actually split across multiple wallets.\u201d\n\nSnyder mentioned that for its European products, 21Shares also diversified across custodians in order to provide better security.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF is also \u201ca lot safer from a bankruptcy perspective,\u201d according to Snyder. \u201cIf everybody at 21Shares disappears tomorrow, there\u2019s a mechanism using a trustee to allow for the recovery of those assets directly from Coinbase,\u201d the executive said. And even if Coinbase goes bankrupt, there\u2019s still a way not to have those assets commingled, Snyder added.\n\nTo add another layer of security for its Bitcoin ETF, 21Shares also uses multiple authorization steps. \u201cThere\u2019s no single individual that can actually move these assets within the organization,\u201d Snyder stated. She said that such a level of security is reached by splitting the private key into multiple pieces and holding those parts in geographically distributed vaults.\n\n21Shares has been battle testing its implementation with custodians for five years, Snyder said in a session of X Spaces (formerly Twitter Spaces) on Jan. 10. \u201cYou can\u2019t treat this like any other asset in the world,\u201d the executive stressed, adding that Bitcoin ETF providers have to hold their Bitcoin offline in wallets that have never been brought into the internet.\n\nRelated: Spot Bitcoin ETF could result in \u2018millions of unbacked BTC,\u2019 analyst says\n\nThe long-awaited approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. took place on Jan. 10, 2024, with the first BTC ETFs starting trading the next day. At launch, eight out of 10 spot Bitcoin ETF providers relied on Coinbase custody as institutions, with some issuers like Fidelity Investments opted for their proprietary custody solution, Fidelity Digital Asset Services.\n\nAnother Bitcoin ETF issuer, VanEck preferred to custody the underlying BTC with Gemini, a crypto trading platform Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss co-founded. As previously reported, the Winklevoss twins were the first-ever applicants for a spot Bitcoin ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission back in July 2013.\n\nMagazine: 10 best long reads about crypto in 2023"

According to a report in the local newspaper Paginal 12 from Jan. 11, the contract is the first of its kind in Argentina, made possible by recent law amendments by the new presidential administration.\n\nThe monthly payment under the sealed contract will equal $100 in Bitcoin. The tenant will transfer the funds monthly through Fiwind, a local crypto platform. The report highlights that both counterparties to the contract are experienced crypto users.\n\nRelated: Who is Javier Milei, Argentina\u2019s market-friendly president?\n\nArgentine rental law, along with other parts of the national legal system were amended by the newly-elected President Javier Milei, who won the general election in November 2023 amid rampant inflation across the country.\n\nIn December 2023, Diana Mondino, the minister of foreign affairs, international trade and worship, claimed that a decree aimed at economic reform and deregulation would allow the use of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the country under certain conditions.\n\nThe government has also eased the path to legalizing crypto holdings even if they\u2019re overdue on tax declarations. Under the framework of a regularization scheme, taxpayers would pay a flat tax on assets of 5% if they declare holdings by the end of March 2024, 10% from April and 15% from July until the end of September.\n\nMagazine: MakerDAO\u2019s plan to bring back \u2018DeFi summer\u2019 \u2014 Rune Christensen"

        "content": "Bitcoin mining firms Riot, TeraWulf, and CleanSpark are the best-positioned within the industry to handle the significant cost increases expected following the Bitcoin halving event in April, according to analysis by asset manager CoinShares.\n\nAs a result of halving, CoinShares predicts that the cost of production and cash costs will increase from approximately $16,800 and $25,000 per Bitcoin in the third quarter of 2023 to $27,900 and $37,800, respectively. The average cost of production post-halving for crypto miners is projected to be $37,856.\n\nAverage cost of production per Bitcoin post-halving across miners. Source: CoinShares\n\nThe halving reduces the block reward given to miners by half, thereby slowing down the rate of new Bitcoin creation as part of the network supply control deflationary policy. The next halving, estimated to take place in April 2024, will reduce the Bitcoin block reward to 3.125 BTC. The cost of mining, however, remains the same or may even increase due to miners\u2019 expansion of operations to remain profitable.\n\n\"[...] we think Riot, TeraWulf and Cleanspark are best positioned going into the halving. One of the main problems miners have is large SG&A [selling, general, and administrative expenses] costs. For miners to break even, the halving will likely force them to cut SG&A costs, otherwise they could continue to run at an operating loss and having to resort to liquidating their HODL balances and other current assets.\"\n\nCoinShares analysis assumes Bitcoin price at $40,000 post-halving, noting that below this point, mining firms will \u201clikely eat into their runway,\u201d meaning miners would end up using financial reserves or operational buffers to remain in business.\n\nIn this scenario, Riot appears to be the best positioned to navigate the halving event \u201cdue to their cost structure and long runway.\u201d However, the company is not shielded from challenges if the Bitcoin price falls below $40,000.\n\n\u201cOverall, unless the price of Bitcoin remains above $40,000, we believe that only Bitfarms, Iris, CleanSpark, TeraWulf and Cormint will continue to operate profitably.\u201d\n\nCoinShares points out that while most miners are improving their fleet efficiency \u2014 measuring energy consumption against mining output \u2014 the direct cost structure is not improving since they \u201cwill need to increase their power draw and energy consumed to mine the same amount of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nAccording to CoinShares\u2019 analysis, electricity costs per Bitcoin pre- and post-halving form about 68% and 71% of miners\u2019 total cost structure.\n\n\u201cThe more rigs a miner has for self-mining, the larger the data centre needed on a megawatt basis. This large capital expenditure is either funded by cash, equity or debt, of which the latter can hurt miners\u2019 all-in cost of production due to higher interest expense and put them at risk during Bitcoin downturns,\u201d reads the analysis using Core Scientific as an example.\n\nIn an effort to return to solvency, Core Scientific closed an oversubscribed $55-million equity financing round on Jan. 8. The mining company intends to relist on Nasdaq after bankruptcy proceedings are completed.\n\nMagazine: This is your brain on crypto \u2014 Substance abuse grows among crypto traders"

        "content": "It\u2019s likely that Bitcoin (BTC-USD) will come back stronger than ever in 2024. There are multiple reasons to be bullish on the cryptocurrency that has already surged in the last few quarters. A good alternative to Bitcoin investing is exposure to spot ETFs. Further, investors can benefit by considering exposure to some of the best crypto stocks to buy.\n\nSpecifically, the introduction of the Bitcoin spot ETF is a major catalyst that will translate into higher investor participation and wider crypto adoption. And, with Bitcoin halving this year, it\u2019s likely that the cryptocurrency will rally after the halving event.\n\nAlso, the Federal Reserve\u2019s potential rate cuts in 2024 will consequently support Bitcoin. Expansionary monetary policies would imply higher liquidity in the financial system and would support a rally in risky asset classes. Given the bullish outlook, let\u2019s talk about three crypto stocks to buy for multibagger returns this year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT)\n\nIn this photo illustration, the Riot Platforms (RIOT) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith the recent retreat in Bitcoin, there has been a correction in Bitcoin miners. This seems like a good opportunity to accumulate, and Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) certainly looks attractive. Once the cryptocurrency trends higher again, RIOT stock could skyrocket, considering the expansion plans.\n\nNotably, Riot has a strong balance sheet. With zero debt and $599 million in cash buffer (including digital assets), Riot is positioned to make large investments for accelerating growth. With swelling hash rate capacity and upside in Bitcoin, I expect strong upside in free cash flows in the next 12 to 24 months.\n\nSpecifically, Riot reported hash rate capacity of 12.4EH/s as of December 2023. By the end of this year, capacity is expected to increase to 28.8EH/s and further to 38.1EH/s by the end of 2025. Therefore, RIOT stock is poised to surge once Bitcoin trends higher after a breather.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoinbase (COIN)\n\nCoinbase (COIN), is an American company that operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Ethereum (ETH-USD) coin on the background of the Coinbase inscription.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn terms of closing highs, Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) stock traded above $350 in November 2021. Once the crypto winter ensued, COIN stock plunged.\n\nHowever, in the last 12 months, COIN has surged by 175% from oversold levels. The rally will probably sustain in 2024 and COIN stock can surge by 200% if Bitcoin trades above previous all-time highs.\n\nThe Coinbase bullish thesis is straightforward. As Bitcoin surges, the altcoin rally will follow. Further, there will be increased trading and speculation activity. This will translate into strong growth in brokerage income. Further, subscription revenue is likely to swell. Overall, the impact on revenue and EBITDA margin expansion is likely to be significant.\n\nInterestingly, Coinbase accelerated global expansion in 2023. This included an eight-week expansion drive in six continents. Also, the company is targeting the launch of crypto derivatives in the European Union. Therefore, as compared to the last bull market, Coinbase will have a bigger addressable market. This will translate into stellar growth and cash flow upside.\n\nBitfarms (BITF)\n\nBitcoin mining operation. Bitcoin mining farm. GREE stock.\n\nSource: Michal Bednarek / Shutterstock\n\nAmong penny crypto stocks to buy, Bitfarms (NASDAQ:BITF) looks attractive even after a rally of 141% in the last 12 months. Bitfarms is yet another Bitcoin miner with aggressive growth plans and a strong balance sheet. Further, the company has an attractive cost of Bitcoin mining, which would imply healthy EBITDA margin.\n\nIn terms of expansion, Bitfarms reported hash rate of 6.3EH/s as of November 2023. The company is targeting expansion to 17EH/s by the second half of 2024. With nearly tripling of mining capacity, Bitfarms is positioned for stellar revenue and EBITDA expansion.\n\nAnother important point is that Bitfarms ended 2023 with $84 million in cash and $34 million in Bitcoin. This implies a total liquidity buffer of $118 million. This provides ample flexibility for aggressive expansion plans. Additionally, BITF aims to be debt-free by February. Therefore, the penny stock represents a company with strong fundamentals.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "SEC Approves Spot Bitcoin ETFs But Gensler Still Disapproves of Crypto - JD Supra",
        "content": "On January 10, 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) approved eleven applications for spot exchange-traded funds (\u201cETFs\u201d) tracking Bitcoin. This landmark moment for the crypto asset industry has been over 10 years in the making. Many retail investors can now add Bitcoin exposure to their existing investment portfolios with the click of a button and just as easily as they purchase shares in an ETF tracking the S&P 500 \u2013 no crypto wallets or exchanges necessary.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of the Bitcoin ETF applications comes on the heels of an August 2023 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia that held that the SEC failed to adequately explain why it disallowed the listing and trading of a proposed Bitcoin ETF. The Court\u2019s decision was the culmination of a decade-long battle between the SEC and those applying to launch Bitcoin ETFs, dating back to July 2013, when the first application for a Bitcoin ETF was filed. The SEC denied that application in March 2017, generally concluding that the crypto asset market and regulatory oversight regarding crypto assets were not sufficiently mature. In the face of these early SEC denials, innovators in the crypto asset space continued to explore alternative paths to provide retail investors with access to Bitcoin through various means, including investment trusts, Bitcoin futures products, and spot ETFs in other countries.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of the eleven Bitcoin ETF applications can only be described as reluctant. In Chairman Gensler\u2019s statement immediately following the approvals, he said as much, explaining that \u201cthe Commission disapproved more than 20 exchange rule filings for spot bitcoin ETPs,\u201d and that this round of applications was similar to the previously doomed applications. Gensler acknowledged, however, that the circumstances were different after the Court of Appeals\u2019 August 2023 ruling, such that approving the applications became \u201cthe most sustainable path forward.\u201d This change in circumstances for the Bitcoin ETF applications does not mean, however, that the SEC\u2019s overall view on crypto assets has softened. As Gensler emphasized, \u201c[w]hile we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse bitcoin.\u201d\n\nIf any question remained whether the SEC\u2019s approval of the Bitcoin ETF applications might signal that the SEC was softening its stance on crypto, Gensler\u2019s post-approval statement answers that question with an emphatic \u201cno.\u201d Even in announcing the approval of a financial product where the underlying asset is Bitcoin, Gensler warned the public that \u201cinvestors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin\u201d and that Bitcoin is \u201cprimarily a speculative, volatile asset that\u2019s also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion, and terrorist financing.\u201d\n\nGensler\u2019s statement also suggests that attempts to launch ETFs based on other crypto assets will meet fierce SEC opposition. His statement emphasizes that the SEC\u2019s approval \u201cis cabined to ETPs holding one non-security commodity, bitcoin\u201d and that the approval \u201cshould in no way signal the Commission\u2019s willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities.\u201d\n\nBeyond offering a renewed sense of legitimacy to an industry whose reputation has recently been marred by scandal and unease, the SEC\u2019s approval has the practical effect of allowing more risk-averse retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without actually holding Bitcoin, itself. Indeed, the new Bitcoin ETFs would operate in much the same way as traditional ETFs, which investors can access through their brokerage accounts and on smartphones with the click of a button. This newfound availability on SEC-regulated financial exchanges means more investors can gain Bitcoin exposure without the hassle of buying the crypto asset itself. That said, some large financial institutions may have reservations about offering Bitcoin ETF access to retail customers from a \u201csuitability\u201d or \u201cbest interest\u201d perspective, and the SEC and other regulators may closely scrutinize the institutions that do.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision on Wednesday in granting approval for Bitcoin ETFs should be seen by crypto enthusiasts and retail investors alike as a major milestone in the push for crypto assets to become more institutionalized, more recognized as an independent asset class, and more widely available to retail investors. Despite the exciting news for investors, the decision should not be interpreted as a sea change in crypto asset regulation \u2013 at least from the SEC\u2019s perspective. It will, however, likely signal an influx of applications to launch ETFs with crypto assets other than Bitcoin (Ethereum or Ripple, for example). The approval of such products will likely face an even longer road to approval than Bitcoin ETFs, given Gensler\u2019s frequent distinction between most crypto assets that he believes are \u201csecurities,\u201d and Bitcoin, which he has characterized as a \u201ccommodity.\u201d\n\n[View source.]"

        "content": "JAN3 CEO and Bitcoin bull Samson Mow believes that Bitcoin will see a significant supply shock in the coming days that could potentially cause its price to surge to $1 million within a matter of \u2018days or weeks.\u2019\n\nThe forecast hinges on a perceived supply shock driven by demand from the recently approved Bitcoin ETFs and a series of market adjustments currently unfolding.\n\nSupply shock\n\nThe launch of Bitcoin ETFs has already attracted billions in trading volume. Concurrently, BlackRock\u2019s acquisition of 11,500 BTC has notably reduced the available market supply within the first two days of trading.\n\nThe purchase is equivalent to buying 13 days\u2019 worth of Bitcoin supply, which currently stands at around 900 BTC/day. Experts predict that the demand for BTC will rise exponentially, especially if the ETFs continue to see significant inflows.\n\nBased on CryptoSlate\u2019s analysis of the available BTC supply, if institutions continue to buy BTC at a similarly aggressive rate, it would only take around 120 days for the supply to dry up, making Bitcoin more scarce than it has ever been in its history.\n\nAdding complexity to the market dynamics is the upcoming Bitcoin Halving, an event that historically impacts the price significantly by reducing the rate at which new BTC are created. The reward for mining new blocks will be halved to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC in approximately 90 to 120 days.\n\nThis, combined with the existing demand exceeding supply, could lead to an unprecedented price surge as demand hits new record highs, while supply drops to its lowest level in history.\n\nMax pain theory\n\nMow believes that markets will likely follow the \u201cMax pain theory\u201d \u2014 adapted from traditional financial markets, it suggests a scenario where Bitcoin\u2019s price movements could result in the maximum financial loss for the largest number of market participants.\n\nThe theory, though not formally defined in the realm of crypto, typically refers to the price level at which most options contracts expire worthless, causing significant losses to holders. In Bitcoin\u2019s case, this could translate into rapid and extreme price fluctuations, potentially catching many traders and investors off guard.\n\nMow believes that one key aspect of this theory in the Bitcoin market is the potential for a short squeeze in the coming days. A short squeeze occurs when the price of Bitcoin unexpectedly surges, forcing those who bet against it (short sellers) to buy back at higher prices to limit losses, further driving up the price.\n\nThe concept of max pain also ties into the unpredictability of Bitcoin\u2019s price movements and market psychology. Bitcoin has a history of defying conventional market expectations, and a scenario that causes the maximum financial pain to the most significant number of market participants is consistent with its volatile and unpredictable nature.\n\nAccording to Mow, a quick rise to $1 million would disrupt the strategic plans of many, including nation-states and companies looking to invest in Bitcoin. It could also affect the usability of the Lightning Network due to high fees and break the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model that many use to predict Bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\nMow also commented on an additional number of events that would occur if Bitcoin hit $1 million price point too quickly, including:\n\nEl Salvador misses the window to issue Bitcoin bonds\n\nMajor economists, including Christine Lagarde and Jerome Powell, would lose their jobs for failing to recognize the inevitable hyperbitcoinization\n\nMichael Saylor and MicroStrategy would not be able to achieve its goal of obtaining 1% of the supply\n\nAmong the most significant impacts would be on the legacy financial system, which Mow believes is unprepared for a rapid reorganization around Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Market Data At the time of press 12:14 am UTC on Jan. 15, 2024, Bitcoin is ranked #1 by market cap and the price is down 2.04% over the past 24 hours.

        "title": "Next Week\u2019s Bitcoin Price Analysis: Here\u2019s Why BTC Price Must Test $38K For Upward Recovery - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nLast week, expectations were high that Bitcoin would rise above $48K and stabilize near $50K by the weekend. Contrary to these predictions, Bitcoin faced a significant correction, dropping towards $41K, even after the SEC\u2019s approval of a spot BTC ETF. Despite this setback, Bitcoin has somewhat recovered, currently testing the $43K level. Analysts now suggest that further decline might occur this week, with $38K being a critical point for a potential robust recovery.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Short-Term Sentiment Is Overheated\n\nHolders of long positions are increasingly liquidating as the BTC price consistently faces rejection above $43,500. Consequently, Bitcoin experienced over $11 million in liquidations, with nearly $8 million in bullish positions being liquidated, according to Coinglass data.\n\nOn-chain data shows the Bitcoin market cooling down after overheating near $46K, with net unrealized profit moving from the denial to the optimism zone at 47.6%. This indicates most short-term holders sold off between $43K-$49K, leaving long-term holders to support the BTC price.\n\nThe MVRV ratio has decreased from 1.69 to 1.38, suggesting the market value is heading toward Bitcoin\u2019s realized value. A further decline in BTC price might be expected as the MVRV ratio has not yet stabilized.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin\u2019s AASI (Active Address Sentiment Indicator) was already overheated as the orange line was hovering near the red line. The AASI is developed by comparing Bitcoin\u2019s 28-day price change percentage (orange line) with its 28-day change in active addresses. This indicator gives a short-term sentiment of the market.\n\nWhen its orange line hits the upper boundary, marked by a red dotted line, it signals an overheated short-term market sentiment. This overheating occurs because the pace of price increase surpasses the growth rate of active addresses. However, the orange line needs to dip toward the green line to initiate further accumulation by buyers near the dip, potentially plunging BTC price toward $38K.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For BTC Price?\n\nBitcoin has shown significant volatility recently, as it faced multiple rejections between $42,500-$43,500, indicating buying at lower levels and selling during rallies. As of writing, BTC price trades at $42,930, declining by over 0.57% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nBears are currently aiming to send the price below the ascending support line, suggesting market rejection at higher levels. If the price declines below $40K, the next focus for the bulls will be to halt the decline at $38K level.\n\nA rebound from the $38K level is expected as it might lead the bulls to attempt pushing the price above the crucial resistance at $44,700 quickly. Achieving this could see the BTC price gaining its momentum and this might trigger a new bullish trend next week. In such a scenario, BTC price is expected to fully capitalize and aim for a surge toward $48K.\n\nConversely, if the price falls below the $38K, it could trigger more selling, potentially driving the price down to $35K-$36K."

        "title": "SEC Approves Exchange Proposals to List and Trade Spot Bitcoin Products. Are Ether Products Next? - JD Supra",
        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved proposals from three stock exchanges to list and trade shares of 11 spot bitcoin-based products (the \u201cSpot BTC Approval\u201d). Following the Spot BTC Approval, the SEC\u2019s Division of Corporation Finance declared the registration statements for a number of these products to be effective, allowing the products to begin trading. Wilson Sonsini was part of the legal team for one of the spot bitcoin products approved.\n\nThe Spot BTC Approval marks the end of a long list of rejections of proposals to trade spot bitcoin products on national securities exchanges. Beginning in early 2017, the SEC had ruled that Section 6(b)(5) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (which requires, among other things, that a listing exchange\u2019s rules be designed to \u201cprevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices\u201d) required the listing exchange to have a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size for bitcoin. In its rejection orders, the SEC consistently concluded that bitcoin trading platforms were unregulated platforms and that surveillance agreements with such trading platforms therefore did not meet the requirements of Section 6(b)(5).\n\nDespite its repeated rejections of exchange proposals to trade spot bitcoin products, the SEC did approve two proposals to list and trade bitcoin futures products. Following these approval orders, the sponsor of a spot bitcoin product, Grayscale, approached the D.C. Circuit alleging that the SEC failed to treat like cases alike by denying the listing of Grayscale\u2019s proposed spot bitcoin product while approving the two bitcoin futures products. The D.C. Circuit agreed with Grayscale, noting the close price correlation between the spot and the futures markets, and ruled that the SEC had failed to show why bitcoin futures products should be treated more favorably than spot bitcoin products.\n\nThe Spot BTC Approval refers to the D.C. Circuit\u2019s ruling and notes that each exchange has a surveillance sharing agreement with a futures exchange that trades bitcoin (i.e., the Chicago Mercantile Exchange). The Spot BTC Approval reviews a study put forward in one of the proposals to conclude that bitcoin spot and futures markets are sufficiently correlated so that surveilling the bitcoin futures market would allow exchanges to identify fraud or manipulation on the bitcoin spot markets.\n\nSEC Commissioners Caroline Crenshaw and Jaime Liz\u00e1rraga dissented from the Spot BTC Approval. Chair Gary Gensler, who voted to approve, issued a statement noting that while the bitcoin ETPs would include important protection for investors, the approval order \u201cshould in no way signal the Commission\u2019s willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities.\u201d Chair Gensler closed by noting that the Spot BTC Approval was not an endorsement or approval of crypto and that \u201cinvestors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.\u201d\n\nAn open question in light of the Spot BTC Approval and the Chair\u2019s statements is how the SEC may deal with the many pending proposals to list and trade spot Ethereum products. Several Ethereum futures ETFs began trading in October 2023, which may cause market participants to ask whether the SEC will be able to reject exchange proposals to trade spot Ethereum products, especially if a strong correlation between Ethereum futures and Ethereum spot markets can be established. Chair Gensler, however, has notably declined to express a view on whether Ethereum is a security, which may raise questions regarding the regulatory treatment of these products. Also notably, trading volumes for Ethereum futures are significantly smaller than volumes for bitcoin futures. Whether the SEC will consider these distinctions to be material remains to be seen\u2014we are likely still months away from a decision on spot Ethereum products."

        "content": "Analysts believe Riot, TeraWulf and Cleanspark will be the Bitcoin miners best positioned for the upcoming halving event, which will likely make breaking even a more difficult task.\n\nAnalysts believe Riot, TerraWulf and Cleanspark will be the Bitcoin miners best positioned for the upcoming halving even\n\nThe Bitcoin halving, an event that takes place once every four years, cuts the block reward paid out to miners on the network by half. While a lower amount of coins entering circulation is a welcome development for BTC holders as far as price is concerned, the same can\u2019t be said for miners that will bear the brunt of a smaller reward in a highly capital intensive operation.\n\nA report from CoinShares examining the impact of the halving on miners suggests that only a handful of miners will remain profitable, contingent on the price of Bitcoin remaining above the $40,000 mark.\n\nLast year alone, the Bitcoin network recorded a 104% increase in hashrate, representing the amount of new computing power dedicated towards mining the cryptocurrency. The CoinShares report found that the average cost of production per Bitcoin for each miner post-halving would amount to $37,856.\n\nBased on historical data around hashrate, miners appear to increase their capital expenditure in order to stay competitive in anticipation of the halving, after which they earn less immediate income.\n\nThis so-called \u201cBitcoin rush\u201d that drives up mining difficulty in the months leading up to the event pushes out miners who are unable to keep up with the higher cost of production. Analysts estimate that the post-halving hashrate could be driven up to as much as 550 exahashes per second (EH/s) by the end of 2024.\n\n\u201cThis halving is likely to kick out those along the higher end of the cost curve, leaving those that remain who have ample liquidity with a great opportunity to acquire hardware at a discount,\u201d noted CoinShares in its report.\n\nAccounting for miners\u2019 cost of electricity, number of Bitcoin produced, computing power, and operational expenditure using their cash and reserves, the CoinShares analysts believe that Riot, TeraWulf and Cleanspark are best positioned going into the halving.\n\n\u201cMost of the pain miners will experience likely stems from hefty SG&A expenses which will likely need to be cut to remain profitable,\u201d they said."

        "content": "Crypto businesses are looking forward to less turbulent times after a long crypto winter, with institutional demand and growing Bitcoin adoption helping to drive innovation in the crypto space. Trends to look for this year include scalability and compliance solutions, industry participants told Cointelegraph.\n\nTransaction speeds and costs are challenges for both the Ethereum and the Bitcoin networks. Not by chance, rollup projects are expected to be in high demand in 2024, said Axelar\u2019s CEO Sergey Gorbunov. He believes rollup development kits are \"something to watch in 2024.\"\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re beginning to see abstraction for the Web3 developer that is similar to what consumer-facing developers in SaaS enjoy,\u201d explained Gorbunov about the growing offer of tools for developers working on blockchain scaling solutions.\n\nRollups are a type of layer-2 blockchain designed to improve scalability. They combine multiple transactions into a single batch outside the main blockchain (off-chain). This significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed and stored on the main chain (on-chain), resulting in faster and cheaper transactions.\n\nAccording to Gorbunov, projects currently \u201cmoving to scale across this landscape include DeFi innovators like Frax and Lido \u2013 and leading DEXs like dYdX, PancakeSwap and Uniswap.\u201d\n\nDecentralized infrastructure is another area expected to grow over the next few months. \u201cDecentralizing frontends and backends is a critical issue, including when it comes to decentralized web-hosting and cloud-storage systems,\u201d said Frank Hu, chief operating officer of ByteTrade Lab.\n\nBehind these trends is the increasing involvement of institutional investors and traditional corporations within the crypto space. According to a November survey by Coinbase, 64% of current institutional crypto investors expected to increase their allocations in the next three years, and 45% of investors without crypto allocations planned to start investing within the same period.\n\nInstitutional investors seek exposure to crypto through a range of products. Source: Coinbase 2023 Institutional Survey\n\nSandra Carter, chief operating officer of Unstoppable Domains, sees projects offering interoperability between Web2 and Web3 as a potential growth area. \u201cThere are so many people, brands, and organizations in Web2 that are yet to move over to Web3 or even know about it. They need to take those first steps, and [crypto] businesses will make that easier and more accessible because they know that there is so much value locked up in Web2 that Web3 can unleash,\u201d she noted.\n\nThe approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will also serve as a business driver in 2024. According to Mauricio di Bartolomeo from lending protocol Ledn, variations of Bitcoin ETF, such as leveraged and short ETFs, are expected to flood the market over the next few months. The hype surrounding the cryptocurrency is also predicted to boost its use as collateral on crypto loans.\n\nFurthermore, one of the crypto industry\u2019s foundations is also being disrupted \u2014 social media platforms. \u201cCrypto has always been driven by social media,\u201d said the co-founder of DSCVR, Juan Bruce, who believes it is only a matter of time before decentralized social media platforms find the product-market fit that will replace the traditional ones.\n\n\u201cTeams, including ours, are building social platforms that aren\u2019t just on chain but enable crypto transactions in a social context for users and projects,\u201d Bruce told Cointelegraph.\n\nGrowth prospects, however, are not immune to challenges. Carter believes the regulatory landscape will still play a significant risk for crypto businesses in 2024.\n\n\u201cThere are so many variables when it comes to regulations, and while there are victories and signs of hope [such as Ripple\u2019s and Grayscale\u2019s court victories], there are specific individuals who are dead-set on stopping crypto from entering the mainstream. The U.S. wants to be competitive in blockchain technology, but regulators are doing their utmost to prevent or control that as best they can.\u201d\n\nMagazine: MakerDAO\u2019s plan to bring back \u2018DeFi summer\u2019 \u2014 Rune Christensen"

Bitcoin has jumped 70% since late October as chatter surrounding the SEC's decision started to intensify, and is currently trading at its highest price in nearly two years.\n\nIt'd still have to double in price again to reach $100,000 \u2013 but some believe that milestone could be reached by the end of 2024, with regulated spot ETFs likely to draw big-name institutional investors into the crypto space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSix-figure price targets\n\nStandard Chartered is one high-profile firm that's particularly bullish on bitcoin. Earlier this month, strategists at the bank predicted that spot ETFs could drive between $50 billion and $100 billion worth of inflows for the token this year \u2013 and set a $200,000 price target for the end of 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, Fundstrat's Lee said in a CNBC interview the day the SEC announced its decision that he's expecting the token to climb to between $100,000 and $150,000 over the next 12 months \u2013 and to soar to $500,000 over the next five years.\n\n\"There's a finite supply, and now we have a potentially huge increase in demand with a spot bitcoin [ETF] approval \u2013 so I think in five years something around half a million would be potentially achievable,\" Lee told the outlet.\n\nUniversity of Sussex economist Carol Alexander, who successfully called bitcoin's slump in 2022 and surprise resurgence last year, isn't setting her sights so high \u2013 but still expects the cryptocurrency to be priced between $70,000 and $100,000 at the end of December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I think it's an excellent thing for bitcoin bulls in the short term \u2014 I've never been as bullish as this,\" she told Business Insider in an interview Wednesday.\n\nWords of caution\n\nNot all of the financial world is convinced by those lofty price targets, though.\n\nFormer PIMCO CEO Mohamed El-Erian said in a post on X Thursday that while the SEC's approval could be a \"game changer\" for cryptocurrency, it wasn't likely to promote bitcoin's usage more widely.\n\n\"As notable as all these factors are for anchoring crypto in the investment world, they do not significantly propel its role as a potential global currency,\" he wrote. \"The outlook here remains more constrained.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven the SEC itself appears skeptical about bitcoin's potential as an investment. In a separate statement Wednesday, chair Gary Gensler called the token \"primarily a speculative, volatile asset that's also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion, and terrorist financing.\""

        "content": "Eight years ago, on Jan. 14, 2016, early Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn famously declared he had sold all his BTC because the flagship cryptocurrency had \u201cfailed\u201d and would only \u201ctrend downward\u201d in the long term.\n\nHowever, years later, Bitcoin has defied almost all of the somber predictions of its early developer and continued to thrive \u2014 cementing its status as \u201cdigital gold.\u201d\n\nIn his 2016 blog post, Hearn said he was giving up on Bitcoin due to concerns over centralization, technical limitations, and governance issues.\n\nHearn\u2019s post, laden with foreboding, suggested that Bitcoin was on the brink of technical collapse and irrelevance. However, the years following his departure have painted a vastly different picture.\n\nCentralization and Tech Limitations\n\nOne of Hearn\u2019s primary concerns was the centralization of Bitcoin mining in China. Since then, the landscape has shifted dramatically.\n\nFollowing China\u2019s crackdown on cryptocurrency mining, the industry saw a mass exodus, leading to a more geographically distributed and decentralized mining network. This diversification has assuaged fears of single-point failures and control, reinforcing the foundational principle of decentralization in Bitcoin\u2019s design.\n\nHearn also pointed to various technical limitations related to the Bitcoin block size. However, the community implemented a fix in the form of the Segregated Witness (SegWit) protocol a year later in 2017.\n\nThis upgrade increased the block capacity and efficiency, alleviating some scalability concerns. Furthermore, the development of second-layer solutions, most notably the Lightning Network, has revolutionized Bitcoin\u2019s transaction capabilities, offering faster transaction times and lower fees.\n\nGovernance, Censorship and Adoption\n\nAnother main reason behind Hearn\u2019s departure was disagreements with other core developers over the proverbial direction Bitcoin was heading in.\n\nHearn had wanted to increase the Bitcoin block size, but other core developers had been against the idea. He spoke of the impasse in his post and said it would lead to censorship and centralization.\n\nHowever, over the years, the Bitcoin community has become more decentralized as it spread out across different forums and social media. The rise of independent news outlets focused on crypto has also significantly contributed to transparency and the free flow of information in the industry.\n\nMeanwhile, Hearn\u2019s foreboding predictions about Bitcoin failing to achieve mainstream adoption are becoming less and less likely as even institutions have begun dipping their toes in the crypto pond.\n\nContrary to the bleak outlook, Bitcoin\u2019s journey in the past eight years has seen increased institutional adoption and recognition as a legitimate financial asset. Major financial institutions and corporations have integrated Bitcoin into their portfolios and services, while countries facing economic instability have turned to it as an alternative financial system.\n\nAs Bitcoin continues towards mainstream adoption, the digital asset remains a subject of intense debate and speculation. The challenges highlighted by Hearn have not been entirely eradicated but have been met with innovative solutions and a community-driven approach to development and governance."

        "content": "hackers compromised the SEC\u2019s X account on January 10 and posted a fake announcement regarding the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs ) on security exchanges, leading to Bitcoin prices briefly spiking.\n\nSenators Ron Wyden, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Cynthia Lummis, accused the federal agency of failing to secure its social media accounts using industry best practices in a letter dated January 11, 2024.\n\nUS lawmakers have demanded an investigation into the hack of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\u2019s X (formerly Twitter) account last week.\n\nThe @SECGov X account was compromised, and an unauthorized post was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products.\n\nX's safety team later said the takeover was due to the hijack of a phone number associated with the @SECGov account in a SIM-swapping attack. X also noted that the SEC's account did not have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled at the time the account was hacked.\n\nThis attack came amid a wave of crypto-related X account hijacks targeting prominent companies, including Mandiant, Hyundai and Certik.\n\nDestabilizing Impact on Financial System\n\nWyden and Lummis wrote that given the potential for market manipulation through such hacks, the SEC\u2019s failure to follow cybersecurity best practices such as 2FA was \u201cinexcusable.\u201d\n\nThey argued that the SEC should have used security keys to secure their social media accounts as well as 2FA, following recent guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).\n\nThe option to enable security keys has been available for users of X since 2021.\n\nThe senators said: \u201cA hack resulting in the publication of material information for investors could have significant impacts on the stability of the financial system and trust in public markets, including potential market manipulation.\n\n\u201cWe urge you to investigate the agency\u2019s practices related to the use of MFA, and in particular, phishing-resistant MFA, to identify any remaining security gaps that must be addressed.\u201d\n\nThe SEC, which introduced new rules in 2023 mandating that publicly listed firms operating in the US disclose \u201cmaterial\u201d cyber incidents within four days, has been criticized for poor cybersecurity practices on several occasions in recent years, the letter noted.\n\nThis includes an independent evaluation in FY23 which determined that the SEC\u2019s information security program and practices were not effective.\n\nWyden and Lummis have given the SEC a deadline of February 12 to provide an update into their investigation and its cybersecurity remediations."

        "title": "After Over a Decade of Rejections, SEC Approves 11 New Spot Bitcoin ETPs - JD Supra",
        "content": "Eleven spot bitcoin-based exchange-traded products (ETPs) were finally approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 10, 2024, after multiple such ETPs had been rejected by the SEC over the last ten years. This followed an August 29, 2023 order by the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (USCA) holding that the SEC\u2019s prior non-approval of such an ETP sponsored by Grayscale Investments, LLC was \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\nAs a result, United States-based institutional and retail investors can now purchase securities representing direct exposure to the spot bitcoin market without custodying the bitcoin. The issuers of the ETPs will be the ones who actually purchase and, through a third-party custodian, custody the bitcoin to back the issuance of the spot bitcoin ETPs to investors. Bitcoin-based ETPs have previously been authorized by certain foreign regulators, including the Ontario Securities Commission and the Australian Securities Exchange.\n\nThe key issue that informed prior rejections and the novel approval of the spot bitcoin ETPs is that the SEC now concludes that the proposals include sufficient means of preventing fraud and manipulation as required under Section 6(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The proposals asserted that this burden was met through surveillance-sharing agreements with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), where bitcoin futures ETPs are currently traded, to assist in deterring and detecting fraud. However, in its prior rejections of spot bitcoin ETP proposals, the SEC had concluded that the CME market was not a \u201csignificant market\u201d as it related to the potential new spot bitcoin ETP since CME only permits trading of bitcoin futures ETPs and does not directly surveil the spot bitcoin ETP market.\n\nLast August, the USCA determined that the SEC could not adequately reconcile its rejection of Grayscale\u2019s spot bitcoin ETP with its prior approval of two bitcoin futures ETPs, which also used the CME as a surveillance partner, given the material similarity of spot and futures bitcoin ETP prices. (Click here for a more detailed discussion of that prior decision.)\n\nNotably, the SEC did not rest its approval on proposals of two of the three exchanges to enter surveillance-sharing agreements with the Coinbase digital assets trading platform, where spot bitcoin is traded (and with which the SEC is engaged in litigation alleging that Coinbase operates as an unregistered national securities exchange). In Footnote 41 of its approval order, the SEC noted that the latest amended proposals by the exchanges did not include reference to those agreements (although it does not opine on why that is the case).\n\nThe spot bitcoin ETPs were approved by a 3-2 SEC vote with Chair Gary Gensler, Commissioner Hester Peirce, and Commissioner Mark Uyeda voting for, and Commissioners Caroline Crenshaw and Jaime Liz\u00e1rraga voting against. The approval came on an accelerated basis under Section 19(b)(2)(C)(iii) of the Exchange Act, which permits a proposed rule change to take place earlier than 30 days after publication of a notice for good cause.\n\nThe issuers of the eleven ETPS approved by the Commission were Grayscale Investments, LLC, Bitwise Investment Advisers, LLC, Hashdex Asset Management, Ltd., iShares Delaware Trust Sponsor LLC, Valkyrie Digital Assets, LLC, 21Shares US LLC, Invesco Capital Management LLC, Van Eck Digital Assets, LLC, WisdomTree Digital Commodity Services, LLC, FD Funds Management LLC and Franklin Holdings, LLC.\n\nThe exchanges on which such ETPs will trade include NYSE Arca, Inc., The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, and Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc.\n\nThis is a landmark decision for cryptocurrency markets that comes just over 15 years from when the Bitcoin network initially launched on January 3, 2009, and over 10 years since the first spot bitcoin ETP proposal on July 3, 2013.\n\nAlong with the approval order have come statements by SEC Chair Gensler and Commissioners Crenshaw, Peirce, and Uyeda:\n\nChair Gensler noted that in light of last year\u2019s Grayscale decision, that approval is \u201cthe most sustainable path forward.\u201d He made clear that the approval is \u201ccabined to ETPs holding one non-security commodity, bitcoin,\u201d and restated his position that the \u201cvast majority of crypto assets are investment contracts and thus subject to the federal securities laws.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Peirce did not mince words in her statement that the approval had not come soon enough and that the Commission \u201csquandered a decade to do [its] job.\u201d She stated that the approval \u201cmarks the end of an unnecessary, but consequential, saga\u201d and restated that the long string of prior denials was \u201cperplexing.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Uyeda agreed with the approval but found the SEC\u2019s reasoning concerning because he believed it continued to reflect an \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d application of the \u201csignificant market\u201d test. He took issue with the SEC continuing to find that the CME bitcoin futures market was not a \u201csignificant market\u201d for the purpose of the spot bitcoin ETP.\n\nCommissioner Crenshaw issued a statement dissenting from the approval because she disagreed with the SEC\u2019s conclusion that the proposals include sufficient fraud and manipulation prevention. She noted such fraud and manipulation in the spot bitcoin markets is widespread, including \u201cpervasive\u201d wash trading, concentrated ownership by few holders, and a lack of oversight. She further disagreed with the SEC and the DC Circuit that bitcoin futures and spot ETPs are \u201clike products.\u201d\n\nThere may be additional approvals of bitcoin-based spot cryptocurrency ETPs on the horizon.\n\nSee the SEC\u2019s order\n\nChair Gensler\u2019s statement\n\nCommissioner Crenshaw\u2019s statement\n\nCommissioner Peirce\u2019s statement\n\nCommissioner Uyeda\u2019s statement\n\n\u201c[B]ecause the CME\u2019s surveillance can assist in detecting those impacts on CME bitcoin futures prices, the Exchanges\u2019 comprehensive surveillance-sharing agreement with the CME \u2014 a US regulated market whose bitcoin futures market is consistently highly correlated to spot bitcoin, albeit not of 'significant size' related to spot bitcoin \u2014 can be reasonably expected to assist in surveilling for fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices in the specific context of the Proposals.\u201d"

        "title": "Talking to Clients About Crypto Risks: A Guide for Financial Professionals - Investopedia",
        "content": "Introduction to Crypto Risks\n\nThough Bitcoin, Ethereum, and most cryptocurrencies have fallen from their historical highs, the asset class remains popular, especially among investors more willing to adopt new technologies. Over a quarter of Americans and one-third of men under 50 have traded or used a cryptocurrency.\n\nDespite this engagement, the public has sensed that cryptocurrencies carry a lot of risk. Three-quarters of Americans say they aren\u2019t confident that cryptocurrency is reliable and safe. The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has fallen to less than $2 trillion from waves of sell-offs since peaking at $2.62 trillion on Sept. 30, 2021.\n\nWhen working with clients interested in the technology, financial advisors need to ensure that they understand the potential downsides. These risks may affect investment returns, so investors should adjust their cryptocurrency holdings according to their risk appetite.\n\nKey Takeaways Cryptocurrencies have grown in popularity, with more than 25% of Americans under age 50 having traded or used a cryptocurrency.\n\nCrypto is also highly volatile, seeing large price swings over hours or days.\n\nFraud, increasing regulation, and environmental concerns are all major risks facing crypto.\n\nUnderstanding a client\u2019s risk tolerance and helping them mitigate its risks are essential for advisors.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Crypto Risks\n\nCryptocurrencies are a young and unique asset class that faces many risks regarding market cycles, laws and regulations, cybersecurity, and much more.\n\nLegal and Regulatory Risk\n\nGovernments and regulatory bodies have pushed to track cryptocurrency transactions, strip encryption protections, and regulate major cryptocurrency exchanges, which could remove a core benefit of the technology that boosts its usage and price. In China, the government has banned cryptocurrency altogether.\n\nIn the United States, the federal securities regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has been considering a raft of new cryptocurrency regulations, including whether to classify ether (ETH), XRP, and other widely traded assets as securities. Such a classification may make it prohibitively expensive or unlawful for investors to purchase crypto on the open market, or it may put them in the difficult position of deciding whether to engage in the costly process of registering the securities and operating as broker-dealers.\n\nAnother risk of cryptocurrencies resides in the legal and regulatory aspects. Changes in taxation and government regulations could affect the value and costs of holding these digital assets or may cause investors to dump them in a hurry when panic sets in.\n\nUnlike fiat currencies, bank accounts, and trades on registered exchanges, trades using cryptocurrencies are not protected by law. There are no dispute processes or ways to reverse transactions, as traditional systems can do. Once a token's ownership is transferred, voluntarily or involuntarily, there is no getting it back unless the new holder sends it back.\n\nMarket Risk\n\nCrypto can be subject to significant volatility, even among the major coins. For example, from Nov. 7 to Nov. 14, 2023, Bitcoin saw its price swing from a low of $34,620 to a high of $37,970, then back to $36,500.\n\nThat is an extreme level of volatility not seen in many other investments. These erratic price fluctuations have made them vulnerable to market manipulations, ranging from short squeezes and wash trading to painting the tape and pump-and-dump schemes.\n\nSecurity Risk\n\nAnother notable concern is the security risks of locking down and transacting with cryptocurrency wallets. Crypto transactions can be instantly transferred without delay, and crypto wallet addresses are long strings of alphanumeric characters, making it easy to transfer assets to the wrong party and for investors to become targets of criminals. Billions of dollars have been lost to faceless crypto scams, lost or forgotten keys, and key thefts.\n\nLiquidity Risk\n\nOne of the most often talked about aspects regarding many cryptocurrencies is limited liquidity. Bitcoin is the most traded cryptocurrency, and as of January 2024, exchange-traded funds backed by bitcoin are legal. These instruments reduce liquidity risks for this cryptocurrency, but many other coins face liquidity issues because of their lower trading volumes.\n\nInvestors who corner themselves into a cryptocurrency with low volume may have a hard time getting out of their positions.\n\nBusiness Risk\n\nBusiness risk is not often associated with cryptocurrency but can be present. If a blockchain-related company issues a cryptocurrency, that coin will inherit the risks internal to the issuer. For example, imagine a company is developing a blockchain service, and its cryptocurrency is available on the market. It failed to raise enough capital or budget properly, causing financial issues. The coin's value would likely fall as a result unless it had value tied to something else investors were interested in.\n\nConcentration Risk\n\nThere are thousands of cryptocurrencies on the market, many of them with billions of dollars in daily trading volume daily. However, only a handful might be worth investing in, depending on the client's preferences, budget, risk tolerance, and goals. This might lead them to concentrate on one or a few coins.\n\nWhile not an issue if their portfolio's cryptocurrency allocation is tempered by less risky and volatile investments, it could become an issue if they decide to invest more than is practical for their circumstances in a few cryptocurrencies.\n\nMitigating Crypto Risks\n\nKnowing that steps can be taken to mitigate risk could change the risk tolerance of clients who are ambivalent about investing in cryptocurrencies or weighing how their investment strategy should look if they\u2019ve chosen to commit to the asset class.\n\nDiversity\n\nDiversification and systematic investment plans are some of the most basic and essential strategies for limiting risk. If a client\u2019s crypto holdings are only a small percentage of their overall portfolio, then even a catastrophic fall in the value of crypto won\u2019t entirely ruin their efforts to boost their wealth. It\u2019s also possible to diversify within the world of crypto, holding not only Bitcoin but also multiple other coins.\n\nDiversified products such as mutual funds, index funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with exposure to crypto assets and companies, and non-discretionary systematic investing methods such as buy-and-hold and dollar-cost averaging (DCA), are usually recommended by financial advisors to clients with high-risk tolerance for crypto\u2014itself an asset class that is already riskier than average.\n\nStay Informed and Secure\n\nStaying up to date on industry changes, double-checking where transactions are sent, holding cryptocurrencies in a multi-signature wallet that requires more than one party to approve transfers, and moving assets into a cold storage solution\u2014an offline wallet\u2014can minimize the odds of lapsing on efforts to hedge against a regulatory measure, sending money to the wrong destination, and becoming a victim of a hack.\n\nEducating Clients About Crypto Risks\n\nFinancial professionals have many strategies and resources available for educating clients on the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies.\n\nReadings and videos are widely available online. News outlets and books report on issues related to the cryptocurrency space. Financial institutions, government agencies, and policymaking entities offer fact sheets and other informational materials highlighting problems that plague these digital assets.\n\nSimulation tools, paper trading, and interactive wallets can demonstrate the tensions of trading cryptocurrency. These resources can show real-time price slippages and volatility swings that shake up cryptocurrency markets daily and the difficulties of setting up, securing, and transacting with wallets.\n\n\n\nAssessing Client\u2019s Risk Tolerance\n\nSizing a client\u2019s risk tolerance is essential if they\u2019re considering crypto. Given the large upheavals in crypto prices, clients will naturally have more sensitivity to their investments.\n\nSomeone primarily concerned with capital preservation who fears losing even a small amount would likely prefer more conservative investments and, thus, isn\u2019t a good candidate for buying cryptocurrencies. However, people less sensitive to large price fluctuations may be more open to investing in or trading this asset class.\n\nDirectly asking the client about their risk tolerance can help lead this discussion. While not everyone can give you a complete answer, many people know the level of risk that they can comfortably handle. If they aren\u2019t prepared to give an answer, present surveys and explore hypothetical examples to pick up on clues and get a feel of their ability to handle risk another way.\n\nA questionnaire can help clients determine their cryptocurrency tolerances. For example, a young person might state they are investing for retirement, so they have a higher tolerance for risk than an older client who wants to retire in the next year.\n\nAddressing Common Crypto Concerns and Misconceptions\n\nThere are many common misconceptions and concerns that people have about cryptocurrencies. Most are concerned about the technology's ethical, social, and cultural impact. Clearing these issues can help clients remove mental roadblocks to deciding whether crypto investing is right for them. Here are some of the more popular concerns:\n\nMyth #1 : Digital currencies have no value. Value, as with everything else, is in the eye of the beholder. There may be no intrinsic value behind some coins, as defined for traditional investments, but historically, if a group of people believe something has value, it has value.\n\n: Digital currencies have no value. Value, as with everything else, is in the eye of the beholder. There may be no intrinsic value behind some coins, as defined for traditional investments, but historically, if a group of people believe something has value, it has value. Myth #2 : Cryptocurrency is only used by criminals. The highest volume of cryptocurrency transactions related to illegal activities occurred in 2022, according to data from crypto forensics firm Chainalysis. But the data also indicates that these transactions accounted for just 0.24% of all crypto transactions that year.\n\n: Cryptocurrency is only used by criminals.

But the data also indicates that these transactions accounted for just 0.24% of all crypto transactions that year. Myth #3 : Cryptocurrency wastes energy. Some cryptos rely on energy-intensive mining that requires an ever-growing number of powerful computers. On Jan. 14, 2023, the Bitcoin network alone averaged an annual consumption of 137 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, roughly equal to the yearly power consumption of the entire nation of Ukraine. But proponents point out that the existing financial system requires many more resources, such as employees (very expensive), networks and infrastructure, data storage, electricity, facilities, and more. Additionally, blockchains like Ethereum use far less energy than Bitcoin.\n\n: Cryptocurrency wastes energy.

Additionally, blockchains like Ethereum use far less energy than Bitcoin. Myth #4: Cryptocurrency creates extra e-waste. Environmental concerns are among the most significant complaints that people have about crypto. Introducing a new bitcoin is a competitive process, and because of its value, miners upgrade their facilities frequently as faster mining machines are developed. Other cryptocurrencies do not require the resources the Bitcoin network does, so they produce less e-waste. So, some cryptocurrencies produce a lot of waste, while others don't.\n\nClients worried about climate change and sustainability may want to consider environmentally friendly blockchains and tokens that use less power consumption and have a lower carbon footprint. Proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains are much less energy-intensive, as are others that use alternative consensus protocols.\n\nCommunicating Crypto Risks in Client Meetings\n\nCrypto is new and exciting, so many clients may be interested in diving in headfirst without fully grasping the risks. Financial advisors should communicate the risks of trading cryptocurrency when meeting with first-time clients and enthusiastic investors by setting realistic expectations.\n\nThe asset class has seen periods of explosive growth in value in previous years. Some investors may hope to see immediate, significant gains by investing in crypto without knowing that most of this wealth went to a small group of lucky traders and elite insiders.\n\nVisual aids and news coverage can be very useful to delineate these expectations. While Bitcoin\u2019s price since 2010 has seen a strong upward trend, a graph of its price since 2018 will show wild swings and an overall decrease in price. Pointing to recent events affecting everyday investors, such as the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, can make the risks seem more immediate and relatable.\n\nHow Volatile Are Cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin reached a record price of $69,000 in November 2021. The repeated significant drops in climbs from that all-time high illustrate the volatility and risk in cryptocurrency. Bitcoin\u2019s volatility consistently ranks above the volatility of other investments.\n\nWhy Are Cryptocurrencies Valuable? Cryptocurrency has value largely because people believe it does. Like traditional currencies, many cryptos can be used as a store of value and as a medium of exchange. They share the features that give traditional currency value, including scarcity, divisibility, acceptability, portability, durability, and uniformity.\n\nWhat Real-World Applications Does Crypto Have? Cryptocurrencies rely on blockchain technology, which can configure smart contracts to execute useful directions when specific conditions are met. Applications of smart contracts include electronic identity verification, supply chain management, lending, borrowing, escrow administration, and much more.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWith interest in cryptocurrency continuing to hold, financial advisors should have a working knowledge of the risks of crypto markets while acknowledging the potential benefits to shield client wealth without missing investment opportunities.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Watch: 'Bitcoin ETF boom won't mimic previous retail investor-led rallies' | The Crypto Mile\n\nBitcoin has rallied after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved multiple spot bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs). However, a leading VC founder has said that retail investor involvement will be more controlled than in previous cycles, as regulatory oversight and enforcement has increased.\n\nLast Wednesday, the SEC approved ETF applications from some of the biggest names on Wall Street, from BlackRock (BLK) to Franklin Templeton (BEN). Investors hope spot bitcoin ETFs will open the gateway for mainstream capital to flood the crypto market.\n\nRetail participation will be different in this cycle\n\nAccording to Outlier Ventures Founder Jamie Burke, current bitcoin (BTC-USD) investing conditions are different compared to the bull market of 2021, that saw an influx of retail investors driving the digital asset's price to an all-time high of over $68,000.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead more: Crypto live prices\n\nAfter the SEC's approval of multiple ETFs \"retail investing is going to be different this time\", Burke told Yahoo Finance's The Crypto Mile.\n\n\"Although lot of retail investors will gain access to bitcoin through financial products like spot bitcoin ETFs and bring more capital into the market, however, it will enter in a different form,\" he added.\n\nBurke said the surge in interest in bitcoin, triggered by the SEC's approval of multiple ETFs, will not resemble previous hype cycles that witnessed substantial retail participation. \"I think that is kind of finished now,\" Burke added.\n\n\"We are now seeing a lot of enforcement action by regulatory bodies tackling the selling of unregistered securities. Here in the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is now putting various controls on how crypto is promoted to retail.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin rally stokes $50k speculation over spot ETF anticipation\n\nStory continues\n\n\"So, retail is likely to now come through more structured instruments. Hopefully now it will be a little more consistent, constant and less volatile,\" Burke said.\n\nA retail investor is an individual who buys and sells financial assets for their personal investment rather than on behalf of an organization or institution. Essentially, they are everyday people participating in the financial markets to grow their wealth.\n\nRead more: US crypto crackdown 'an opportunity for the UK'\n\nAfter last Wednesday's approval, investors in the US now have access to the ETFs, but they remain prohibited for those in the UK due to FCA rules.\n\nIn the UK, US ETFs are not available for sale because they don't issue key investor documents. It means asset managers would need to launch funds specifically for the UK market.\n\nConsequently, the primary option for UK crypto enthusiasts is acquiring bitcoin through crypto trading platforms, such as Coinbase (COIN) or Kraken.\n\nAI-crypto projects in 2024\n\nBurke also highlighted the ongoing development and activity in the field of artificial intelligence-related cryptocurrency projects as a growth area in 2023. He emphasised the continued exploration of themes around AI and data ownership and also called for the growing need for decentralized AI forms and increased transparency in AI governance and decision-making.\n\nRead more: Sovereign agents: Your own personal AI assistant? | The Crypto Mile\n\nBurke emphasised the potential for AI-agent systems to conduct economic activity on behalf of human users on blockchains and outlined the current need for AI systems that enhance user sovereignty, especially with the decline of open web data availability.\n\nRead more: The next generative AI success story could come from the call centre market\n\nBurke suggested ways to encourage users to contribute data for training large language models in a controlled, privacy-enhanced manner.

This process enables the representation of traditional assets such as real estate and bank issued debt on blockchains, enhancing liquidity and efficiency.\n\nTokenisation can also be extended beyond traditional finance markets to encompass various sectors, including supply chains and science research and development. The process could allow for the decentralisation of scientific research and the creation of autonomous credit markets.\n\nWatch: Sovereign Agents - your own personal AI assistant? | The Crypto Mile\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

        "title": "Spot bitcoin ETF fiasco underlines chequered US regulatory process - ETF Stream",
        "content": "Bitcoin and ETFs has been a difficult marriage for all regulators to reconcile, however, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Gary Gensler has delivered a masterclass on how to be strong-armed into approving a product it is fundamentally unsure about.\n\nFor clarity, the SEC Chair is not staunchly against cryptocurrencies or their related technologies. Years before the \u2018death by a thousand cuts\u2019 process of approving spot bitcoin ETFs, Gensler was a professor of economics and management at MIT, teaching classes on blockchain and digital currencies, even acting as senior adviser to the MIT Media Lab Digital Currencies Initiative.\n\nHowever, the SEC has for the most part tried to garner a no-nonsense reputation on crypto since Gensler started his tenure as Chair in 2021.\n\nJust last year, the watchdog filed 13 charges against separate entities of the largest crypto exchange, Binance, as well as Kraken and Coinbase for failing to register arms of their businesses \u2013 the latter of which is now the custodian for eight of the 11 spot bitcoin ETFs coming to market.\n\nIn fact, in a laboured statement on the approval of the new ETFs, Gensler said: \u201cThough we are merit neutral, I would note that the underlying assets in the metals ETPs have consumer and industrial uses, while in contrast bitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset that is also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion, and terrorist financing.\n\n\u201cWhile we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWhile the Chair and his fellow Democrat SEC commissioners remain wary of crypto assets which trade largely on unregulated markets, with prices vulnerable to manipulation, those concerns are now largely academic, thanks to a series of blunders and pressures \u2013 internal and external \u2013 which forced spot bitcoin ETFs over the line.\n\n\u2018Capricious and arbitrary\u2019\n\nAfter more than a decade and at least 20 denied applications, the death knell for keeping spot crypto out of US wrappers sounded in October 2021, with the approval of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO).\n\nA deciding factor in BITO, a futures-tracking strategy, being green lit by the SEC was entities such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission \u2013 where Gensler previously served as Chair \u2013 being satisfied the underlying market was not being manipulated.\n\nBITO\u2019s listing and subsequent rejection of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) being converted to a spot bitcoin ETF then sparked a legal battle between Grayscale and the SEC \u2013 a battle the regulator would lose in August 2023.\n\nDeborah Fuhr, managing partner and founder at ETFGI, told ETF Stream approving BITO was the SEC\u2019s \u201cdownfall\u201d and had this not happened, \u201cGrayscale would not have had the case to come forward and the whole thing would not have happened\u201d.\n\nWhile members of the SEC may have contested that bitcoin ETFs could threaten the investor protection and public interest tenets of the Exchange Act, many commentators argued this to be logically inconsistent, given the approval of more complex futures-based ETFs two years earlier.\n\nAgreeing, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia described SEC rejections of Grayscale\u2019s spot bitcoin ETF conversion as \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d.\n\nThis failure in court may now have longer-term ramifications for the regulator.\n\n\u201cThe court case will cause some firms to think about trying to bring new and different types of products to market,\u201d Fuhr suggested. \u201cAre there other areas where the SEC could also be seen as not offering a level playing field?\n\n\u201cOne instance which comes to mind is the Vanguard model of bringing ETFs to market through ETF share classes of a mutual fund, which was patented and the patent has gone away. Depending on how that moves forward, you could see how this would be a route that others would explore going forward.\u201d\n\nA political minefield\n\nOf course, any perceived missteps by the regulator have not occurred in a vacuum.\n\nA source familiar with the approval discussions told ETF Stream there is \u201cso much political pressure guiding the decisions\u201d, both from the two major US political parties but also the commissioners they have appointed within the SEC.\n\nWith Democrat-appointed Gensler\u2019s vote being the deciding one among the committee of five last week \u2013 and 10 months out from the next US election \u2013 Athanasios Psarofagis, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said \u201cthis seemed more like a political agenda than a securities issue\u201d.\n\nHe also noted the importance of BlackRock filing for a spot bitcoin ETF last year, with the world\u2019s largest asset manager having only had one of its ETF filings rejected \u2013 for a non-transparent ETF in 2014.\n\n\u201cThe involvement of BlackRock makes the transition easier,\u201d he said. \u201cHonestly, I am not sure these approvals would have happened without their involvement.\u201d\n\nGensler now has plenty of rebuilding to do, having alienated the Democrat commissioners opposing the bitcoin ETFs, while advocates and Republicans would argue the SEC Chair only changed his voting stance to avoid further court tussles.\n\nIn a statement, Donald Trump-appointed commissioner Hester Peirce warned \u201cfailing to follow our normal standards and processes\u201d around the new ETFs \u201cwill continue to harm our reputation far beyond crypto\u201d.\n\nShe added the process had \u201cdiminished trust from the public\u201d, cost \u201clikely millions of dollars of staff time\u201d and created a \u201ccircus atmosphere\u201d.\n\nCapturing the mood of the crypto community, Nic Carter, partner at Castle Island Ventures, commented: \u201cWe had to drag the SEC kicking and screaming into what should have been a straightforward approval.\u201d\n\nAcross the bench, Democrat commissioner Caroline Crenshaw described the approvals as \u201cunsound and ahistorical\u201d and put the SEC on a \u201cwayward path that could further sacrifice investor protection\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, prolific Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren argued there was \u201cno doubt the SEC made the wrong decision here\u201d.\n\nOperational question marks\n\nWhile the SEC may not have scored many brownie points by choosing to approve spot bitcoin ETFs, it lost several more with the mishaps baked into the announcement process itself.\n\nFirst, the widely covered \u2018hack\u2019 of the regulator\u2019s account and the X post announcing the ETF approvals a day before the SEC made the decision official.\n\nMultiple sources familiar with the approvals process told ETF Stream there was a \u201creasonable\u201d possibility the post was internally produced but published without necessary approvals.\n\nOne said: \u201cBlunders like this make them a laughingstock \u2013 they are taken seriously, so incidents like this should not happen.\u201d\n\nAdding to the frenzied onlookers\u2019 excitement, Cboe published listing circulars for six spot bitcoin ETFs \u2013 to go live the following day \u2013 prior to SEC approval.\n\nOn a more benign note, Fuhr said the SEC\u2019s decision to approve several products simultaneously strayed from the past approach of approving a single first mover, which could \u201cmodify\u201d how it goes about approving groups of innovative strategies in future.\n\nLingering unknowns\n\nFuhr noted following the approvals, a number of questions remain unanswered. For instance, the tax consequences of investing in the new ETFs and whether they are defined as complex products, which raises issues of suitability and which platforms they should appear on.\n\n\u201cWe cannot have all these people investing without these questions being answered and people understanding how these will impact their investments,\u201d she said.\n\nPsarofagis added the mechanics and potential scale of trading activity in the new ETFs \u201ctest the ETF wrapper to the limits\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere will be lots of pressure on these to perform flawlessly \u2013 which I think they will for the most part \u2013 but any fault could be a bad look for ETFs,\u201d he noted.\n\nPsarofagis also questioned the overlaps and distinctions between US and European regulation.\n\nWhile he described Europe as \u201cmore cut-and-dry\u201d in its language for separating UCITS from \u201cwonky stuff\u201d in exchange-traded notes (ETNs) \u2013 which may be harder for retail investors to access \u2013 he noted no such separation in the \u201corganised chaos\u201d system of the US, where \u201cthere is really no distinction\u201d.\n\nHowever, much as the US may follow the European model of accepting wrapped bitcoin, then ethereum and eventually crypto baskets, if US regulators can find their feet with crypto ETFs, perhaps Europe could be convinced to consider the role of digital assets within UCITS ETFs in years to come."

With support from Blockfills, DV Trading LLC, Jump Trading Group, Marex, Toa Capital Partners and Wedbush in executing these trades, Cboe Digital becomes the first U.S. regulated crypto native exchange and clearinghouse to offer both spot and leveraged derivatives trading on a single platform.\n\n\u201cAs an exchange and clearinghouse, this is a significant milestone for Cboe Digital and its vision to unify the crypto spot and futures market,\u201d said John Palmer, President of Cboe Digital. \u201cThe future of crypto is at an exciting juncture and as more investors look to participate in this asset class, we expect to see greater demand for derivatives to help manage their crypto exposures, hedge risk and enhance capital and operational efficiencies. We are grateful for the hard work from our intermediaries, partners and team members that got us here and look forward to continuing working with them to help drive the market\u2019s growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe transparent and U.S. regulated markets drive customer demand for these products and Marex was keen to support its customers from the outset,\u201d said Thomas Texier, Head of Clearing at Marex. \u201cCboe Digital\u2019s margin futures launch will help bring competitive technology and innovative solutions to the crypto spot and leveraged derivatives markets.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a market maker with industry leading risk controls, we are pleased to be working with a high-quality exchange such as Cboe Digital whose focus is to enable broader institutional participation and adoption of cryptocurrencies,\u201d said Jake Moore of Toa Capital Group. \u201cCboe Digital\u2019s offer in providing secure access to regulated futures markets is key to maturing this nascent asset class.\u201d\n\n\u201cCboe Digital has been influential in helping facilitate the creation of a transparent well-regulated crypto spot and derivatives market,\u201d said Bob Fitzsimmons at Wedbush Securities. \u201cWe look forward to continued collaboration in this market and congratulate Cboe Digital on this exciting next step.\u201d\n\nFollowing its launch of financially settled margined contracts on Bitcoin and Ether, Cboe Digital plans to expand its product suite to include physically delivered products, pending regulatory approval.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are currently following a pattern similar to previous years, during which their prices surged by 500% and 1,000%, respectively, according to the latest research report by Coinbase Research and Glassnode.\n\nThe observation draws parallels between the ongoing crypto market cycle and the period from 2018 to 2022, characterized by substantial price increases in both cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin Halving\u2019s Potential Impact on Crypto Markets\n\nAnalysts highlight various cyclicality metrics, such as net unrealized profit/loss and supply in profit, which mirror past trends. These metrics indicate that the present state of the crypto markets doesn\u2019t mirror the euphoric conditions seen during the peak of 2023. It suggests there might still be potential for the market to experience further surges.\n\nDespite acknowledging the potential positive impact of the forthcoming Bitcoin halving, Coinbase Research is cautious.\n\nThe paper noted a lack of robust supporting evidence and characterized the relationship between the halving and market performance as somewhat speculative.\n\nThe research points out that, with only three halving events historically, there isn\u2019t a fully established pattern, especially considering previous events were influenced by factors like global liquidity measures.\n\nThe upcoming Bitcoin halving, projected to occur in April 2024 based on current mining rates, will reduce the block reward from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC.\n\nAnalyzing Ethereum\u2019s Market and Upcoming Upgrade\n\nIn 2023, the Ethereum (ETH) price surged by over 90%, driven by several factors, such as the success of the Shapella upgrade and the increasing likelihood of approval for spot crypto ETFs. Market participants were encouraged by these developments, contributing to the increase in the ETH value.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts are focusing on the upcoming Ethereum upgrade named Cancun. It is expected to enhance scalability and security to make layer-2 transactions as cost-effective as possible.\n\nThe successful implementation of Cancun could potentially lead to a significant increase in the number of processed transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s analysis notes that Bitcoin and Ethereum have undergone two cycles, encompassing both bull and bear markets. The ongoing cycle, initiated in 2022, closely mirrors the patterns observed in the preceding ones."

        "content": "Crypto's latest big moment is worthy of one big reminder too.\n\nThe US dollar is still the US dollar, and crypto is, well, just an investment vehicle.\n\nSaid reminder comes compliments of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), one of the foremost global authorities on payments and financial stability.\n\n\"Our view is that we have to differentiate between money and assets. When we talk about crypto, we are actually talking about an asset class. It could be backed up and in that sense, more secure and less risky, or it could be not backed up and, therefore, a riskier investment. But it is not exactly money. It's more like a money management fund,\" IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nGeorgieva's comments came mere hours before the SEC paved the way for the debut of new spot bitcoin-backed ETFs last week.\n\nRegulators gave the all-clear sign to financial institutions such as Cathie Wood's Ark and BlackRock (BLK) to debut these new ETFs. A total of 11 spot bitcoin ETFs were approved.\n\nAverage investors will now be able to gain exposure to the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency without having to own it. Crypto in your 401k? Hey, if you want that risk and can sleep at night.\n\nThe ETFs began trading last Thursday, with the crypto-verse now turning attention to potential ethereum ETF approvals this spring.\n\nIt's a big moment for the crypto industry, which has endured boom and bust periods over the past five years and the downfall of onetime prominent leaders in FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried and Binance's CZ.\n\n\"Our simple advice to all investors is \u2014 buy the dip and focus on the new bitcoin adoption cycle. The minor selloffs are opportunities in view of the asymmetric upside ahead,\" said Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani in a client note reviewed by Yahoo Finance.\n\nCoinbase CFO Alesia Haas told Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith that it was \"a landmark day for crypto,\" but \"this is a long journey and this is just one step along the way\" in the bid for crypto to gain more widespread acceptance.\n\nStory continues\n\nHaas believes the spot bitcoin ETF approval will \"invite trillions of dollars that were previously not able to access crypto assets and not able to access bitcoin.\"\n\nDespite the latest bitcoin hoopla, the IMF's Georgieva doesn't think the day is nearing that the crypto will rival the dollar in stature.\n\n\"Look, this day, if it exists, is so far in the future that I think it is not very useful to talk about it. Why is the dollar today a dominant currency? Because of the size of the US economy and, most importantly, the depth of the capital markets in the US,\" Georgieva explained, comparing the dollar's attributes to other key global currencies.\n\n\"So I, for one, am not in a rush to turn my dollars into another currency. It doesn't mean that you shouldn't, you know, diversify. But, I wouldn't worry too much about [bitcoin rivaling the dollar]. There are things that make me lose sleep \u2014 that's not one of them.\"\n\nDavos 2024\n\nRead the latest from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland:\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "Why Spot Bitcoin ETFs Could Be Bad for Crypto - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nAfter years of delay and denial, the SEC has finally approved the first 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThese new financial products offer investors an easy way to get exposure to Bitcoin.\n\nBut their launch (and likely success) complicates the narrative that Bitcoin is the future of money.\n\nThe long-awaited approvals of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the SEC this week is being hailed as a milestone event that will open cryptocurrencies to mainstream investors. But while the newfound accessibility is a boon for short-term prices, these ETFs may undermine the founding principles that make cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC) unique and interesting in the first place.\n\nThis Is Not Decentralization, to Put It Mildly\n\nBy packaging Bitcoin into a regulated financial product traded on stock exchanges, ETFs effectively turn the cryptocurrency into just another asset class for portfolio diversification. Great for your run-of-the-mill investor, sure. But for those who saw Bitcoin as the future of money, excitement about ETFs is kind of missing the point.\n\nFundamentally, this financialization clashes with Bitcoin\u2019s original purpose as a decentralized digital currency outside the traditional financial system. It concentrates ownership under a few large asset managers (BlackRock etc.) instead of a broad network of distributed users. And it places trust in intermediary institutions over the sovereignty of individuals.\n\nThe iShares Bitcoin Trust $IBIT begins trading on @Nasdaq TODAY \ud83d\udca5, underpinned by @BlackRock 's 20+ years of experience and supported by the same technology and risk management expertise offered to institutional investors: https://t.co/GFqpaInEar . https://t.co/k8T5SqwKlE \u2014 BlackRock_News (@BlackRock_News) January 11, 2024\n\nFor anyone familiar with crypto\u2019s ethos of decentralization and disintermediation, this is not part of the master plan. But what\u2019s the problem? ETFs themselves aren\u2019t changing anything about Bitcoin itself. The high ideals of crypto aren\u2019t going anywhere, right?\n\nBitcoin Go Up\n\nImportantly, while ETFs provide an easier on-ramp for new investors, they also shift the narrative around Bitcoin itself.\n\nExcitement over these new funds is focused almost entirely on the potential for price appreciation, rather than enthusiasm for the technology or ideals behind cryptocurrencies. The innovations around digital wallets, blockchain-based transactions, and self-custody get overshadowed when Bitcoin becomes merely something to trade.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be clear: the excitement around spot Bitcoin ETFs is because of a lack of patience, understanding and buy-in from \u201cnormal people\u201d about self-custody. It is because of the alternative that exchange-traded funds look so exciting. No more remembering private keys and seed phrases, just add ETF shares to your brokerage account, and done.\n\nThis shift threatens to turbocharge a narrative change that has already been underway for several years. As it continued to outperform expectations, Bitcoin went from a revolutionary monetary system into just another speculative asset class. Instead of using Bitcoin as decentralized peer-to-peer cash, most investors will simply buy and sell paper claims on the coins.\n\nThe aspects that made Bitcoin unique become abstracted away, as market participants care more about chasing profits than advancing a new financial paradigm.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the first application for a spot Bitcoin ETF was made in 2013. If, hypothetically, it had been approved, the ETF would exist in a world less primed to regulate the cryptocurrency (in part, because everyone knew a lot less about it). But, we\u2019re in 2024, and Bitcoin is now a finance story, not a tech one. Perhaps if approval was granted earlier things could have been different. C\u2019est la vie.\n\nUS Lawmakers Are Already Coming for Bitcoin\n\nSome argue that increased investment inflows will help fund Bitcoin\u2019s development in the long run. But much of that capital will flow towards centralized institutions antithetical to Bitcoin\u2019s ethos. And as volatile price swings draw more speculative manias, the likelihood of overregulation only increases.\n\nPerhaps the Bitcoin dream is already on its way to being over. In December, US lawmakers took aim at the decentralization and pseudonymity that has long been a core tenet of Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency industry.\n\nFor the sake of our national security, crypto firms should have to follow the same anti-money-laundering rules as other financial institutions. And I\u2019ve got a bipartisan bill to make it happen. pic.twitter.com/k1Qz3ylYVz \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) December 8, 2023\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Sean Casten introduced legislation in their respective chambers that would subject cryptocurrency entities like wallet providers, miners, and validators to stringent anti-money laundering rules that currently apply to traditional financial institutions. Crypto industry advocates argue that imposing centralized oversight runs counter to cryptocurrencies\u2019 raison d\u2019\u00eatre, but lawmakers believe tighter regulation is necessary to combat illicit financing and national security threats.\n\nWith bipartisan support growing, Congress may soon vote to approve controls that could fundamentally alter the legal and practical reality around digital assets. One thing is fairly certain though, the new holders of ETF shares probably won\u2019t be the ones complaining. Many of them never cared in the first place."

        "content": "Wall Street giant Morgan Stanley believes the rise of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and digital assets like Bitcoin and stablecoins could potentially disrupt the U.S. dollar\u2019s longstanding dominance in the global economy.\n\nThe lender made the analysis in a recent report titled \u201cDigital (De)Dollarization?\u201d \u2014 which highlights the disproportionate influence of the U.S. dollar in global finance and the existential threat posed by digital currencies and CBDCs.\n\nDollar\u2019s slipping dominance\n\nDespite the U.S. contributing about 25% of global GDP, the dollar constitutes nearly 60% of global foreign exchange reserves. However, this dominance is now under scrutiny, partly due to the U.S.\u2019s growing twin deficits and strategic economic sanctions prompting nations to seek dollar alternatives.\n\nThe European Union and China are making strides to bolster the euro and yuan in international trade. The EU focuses on enhancing the euro\u2019s role, especially in energy and commodity transactions. China is promoting the yuan through its Cross-Border Interbank Payment System, challenging the dollar-centric payment systems.\n\nMeanwhile, other countries have created the BRICS organization to develop non-dollar methods of trade among each other, while Russia has been looking into using private digital currencies for some cross-border trades.\n\nThe report suggests that the ascent of digital currencies and CBDCs represents a significant challenge to the traditional dominance of the dollar in international finance. These emerging technologies offer more efficient, transparent, and accessible financial solutions, potentially reducing reliance on traditional banking systems and the dollar in international transactions and reserves.\n\nRise of the digital currencies\n\nThe report analyzes the potential impact of these digital currencies and CBDCs on the global financial system. It posits that as these technologies gain acceptance and usage, they could offer practical alternatives to traditional cash and fiat currencies.\n\nThis shift is poised to reduce the reliance on the dollar for international transactions and central bank reserves, potentially altering the balance of global economic power.\n\nAccording to the report, Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature and capped supply, has evolved from a niche online concept to a globally recognized asset, with an adoption rate of 106 million owners worldwide. The flagship cryptocurrency\u2019s expanding global reach and national adoption by countries like El Salvador as legal tender signals a historic shift in national financial strategies.\n\nMorgan Stanley also pointed to the growing usage of stablecoins, which accounted for transactions amounting to $10 trillion in payments in 2022, as another sign of the shifting landscape. Stablecoins are increasingly becoming the go-to payment method due to their 24/7 access and instant settlement.\n\nFurthermore, their integration into payment systems of companies like Visa and PayPal is another sign of their growing importance in the global financial ecosystem.\n\nCBDCs could supplant the dollar\n\nThe report also delves into the rapid development of CBDCs and their potential impact on the dollar\u2019s market dominance.\n\nOver 111 countries are exploring these digital versions of their national currencies, which could revolutionize financial systems. China\u2019s digital yuan and Brazil\u2019s DREX are examples of how CBDCs could facilitate more efficient and inclusive financial transactions.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley, the rise of CBDCs could streamline cross-border payments, reducing reliance on traditional financial intermediaries like SWIFT and, by extension, the use of dominant currencies like the dollar.\n\nThe report points to the mBridge project, involving central banks from multiple countries, as an example of how CBDCs can facilitate efficient cross-border settlements using smart contracts.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s analysis points to a future where CBDCs and other private digital currencies offer viable alternatives to traditional cash and fiat currencies. This shift could gradually reduce the dollar\u2019s role in international finance, influenced by digital innovation and shifting geopolitical dynamics."

        "content": "BlackRock may have gone with a boring ad campaign for its spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF), but it may just be the secret sauce for the wealthy boomer market, according to commentators.\n\nOn Jan. 11, investment giant BlackRock released its first video ad for its newly launched iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). The ad consists of an almost two-minute video featuring a BlackRock executive outlining Bitcoin\u2019s value proposition and how investors can receive exposure to its new ETF.\n\nJay Jacobs, BlackRock\u2019s United States head of thematics and alternative ETFs, states in the ad that IBIT is easily accessible, conveniently removes operational burdens and is issued under BlackRock\u2019s reputation and expertise in the ETF space. Commentators noticed an intentional lack of flair and crypto jargon compared to other Bitcoin ETF ads.\n\nAmazing ads from Blackrock on $IBIT, the Blackrock Bitcoin Spot ETF.\n\n\n\nDefinitely a new market of investors is reached through $IBIT\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/HxUZqE65kv \u2014 Alessandro Ottaviani (@AlexOttaBTC) January 14, 2024\n\n\u201cThis is how you market to rich boomers, folks. The calm disposition, easy to understand inv case, soft new age music, suit with no tie.. everything about it says \u201cit\u2019s ok now, the adults are here,\u201d observed Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas in a Jan. 14 post on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nChris Dark, founder and managing partner of Fourth Turning Investments, referred to the advertisement as \u201cso boring it\u2019s brilliant\u201d because of its apparent effectiveness in targeting boomers.\n\nMy god this is a great Boomer ad for Blackrock BTC ETF\n\n\n\nAbsolutely everything that will drive BTC maxis insane\n\n\n\nThe ad is so boring it\u2019s brilliant (for the intended audience) https://t.co/zwW1HgGQSP \u2014 Dr. Chris Dark (@Darky999) January 14, 2024\n\nDigital asset investor Fred Krueger also sees the ad as being more palatable for \u201cwealthy boomers.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy generation of wealthy boomers doesn\u2019t particularily like tatoo-covered Gen-x ers telling them that the entire financial system needs to be scrapped.\u201d But they\u2019re happy now that they can invest in Bitcoin via traditional finance firms.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re happily adding IBIT and FBTC to our portfolios, because we trust BlackRock and Fidelity [...] This is a Wall-Street take-over of the Bitcoin narrative. Resistance will be futile.\u201d\n\nRelated: Spot Bitcoin ETF approved in the US: What to expect next\n\nThe Bitcoin ETF marketing war has been heating up since the first ad dropped from Bitwise on Dec. 18, 2023. ETF issuers Hashdex and VanEck released ads soon after.\n\nIn January, ARK Invest and Grayscale also released new advertising campaigns, and the Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund, tickered BRRR, was seen advertising on the Nasdaq billboard in Times Square, New York City, on Jan. 13.\n\nMeanwhile, several ETF issuers, including VanEck, Invesco Galaxy and Franklin Templeton, have featured the new Bitcoin ETFs on their homepages, while BlackRock and Fidelity Investments have reportedly done similar.\n\nMagazine: Wolf Of All Streets worries about a world where Bitcoin hits $1M: Hall of Flame"

        "title": "Short-term view on spot bitcoin ETFs 'a mistake' says 21Shares president - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ten spot bitcoin ETFs started trading Thursday after garnering approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, with one from Ark Invest and 21Shares among them.\n\nThe fund saw day-one trading volumes of nearly 6 million shares, or $275 million \u2014 as competing funds by Grayscale, BlackRock and Fidelity saw more activity.\n\nRead more: Spot bitcoin ETF volumes eclipse $4.5B on first day of trading\n\nThe volumes reflected the \u201cpent-up demand\u201d for such products, according to 21Shares president Ophelia Snyder, who spoke with Blockworks in an interview.\n\n\u201cThe excitement surrounding the entry of US institutions into the BTC market is justified,\u201d she added. \u201cWe expect a second wave of activity in the coming weeks and months as this becomes more mainstream.\u201d\n\nArk Invest and 21Shares first partnered to launch a spot bitcoin ETF in 2021. They re-upped their efforts for such a fund last April, prior to BlackRock entering the race \u2014 a move that spurred a swathe of other firms to refile.\n\nRead more: BlackRock bitcoin ETF is outperforming bitcoin\n\nWhile Ark specializes in products and research focused on so-called disruptive innovation, 21Shares has operated crypto exchange-traded products in Europe for years.\n\nSnyder noted that a spot bitcoin ETF opens up crypto to various investment professionals who previously could not invest on behalf of clients.\n\nRoughly 80% of financial advisers said they were either unable to buy crypto for clients or unsure if they could, according to a survey published by Bitwise and VettaFi earlier this month. Of those interested in buying BTC, 88% said they were waiting for the SEC to approve spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBut for many, Snyder added, adoption of such funds is not likely to be immediate.\n\nKeep reading for excerpts from Blockworks\u2019 interview with Snyder.\n\n21Shares CEO Ophelia Snyder\n\nBlockworks: Why is a spot bitcoin ETF such a big deal, in your view?\n\nSnyder: Most people who manage money in the United States cannot purchase crypto.\n\nHow comfortable is the average, real crypto user when making transfers from their hardware wallet? It\u2019s a panicky feeling. It\u2019s not pleasant. Did I send it to the right place? Did I do the right thing?\n\nThat\u2019s when you\u2019re doing it for yourself. What happens when you have to do it for somebody else to whom you have a fiduciary obligation? How likely are you to do that? You\u2019re not [going to].\n\n[Financial advisers] always had two options. You either do nothing, or you use a lot of time and energy to set up a completely redundant system to support spot products.\n\nBecause, by the way, none of your existing systems will integrate, right? Crypto reporting, crypto tax, crypto trading, crypto custody, crypto compliance \u2014 it\u2019s a completely different operating stack.\n\nTheir job is to serve their clients. Their job is not to spend a lot of time setting up extra infrastructure.\n\nSo they\u2019re not going to buy spot [bitcoin] outside of that infrastructure. They\u2019re certainly not going to buy it individually [for clients]. There\u2019s no pragmatic way for them to enter this space while remaining within their infrastructure.\n\nBlockworks: What do you estimate the short- and long-term demand to be for these from a flow and assets under management perspective?\n\nSnyder: Anybody who has a gatekeeper of any kind is not buying on day one.\n\nMost large platforms have a gatekeeper. They do a review, they do due diligence on the manager. There\u2019s a bunch that has to happen; that process takes weeks.\n\nSo I think this fixation on the short-term flows is crazy short-sighted and largely not the point.\n\n\n\nHaving done this in Europe, what we\u2019ve seen in the past is people dip their toe in. They try it a tiny bit to see how it does, see how it works, see how it feels to have in a portfolio and how the client reacts to it. And then they go up.\n\nRead more: Financial pros mull allocation boosts to \u2018chaos-resilient\u2019 BTC: Bitwise\n\nIt\u2019s going to ramp over time, so I think the short-term view is a mistake. I think they\u2019ll do very well in their first week \u2014 that\u2019s not to say I don\u2019t have faith in that \u2014 but I do think that the really transformational stuff that will change the way our industry perceives these things will take a little bit more time.\n\nBlockworks: We have seen various crypto-focused marketing efforts in recent weeks from rival firms such as Bitwise, Hashdex and VanEck. How is Ark Invest and 21Shares looking to position its brand?\n\nSnyder: Really, we want to bring new people into the fold here. That\u2019s the whole point.\n\nIf you look at how our competitors have positioned [themselves], there\u2019s been a lot of focus on a \u201ccrypto is cool, come be one of the cool kids\u201d kind of vibe to their marketing positioning. And one of the issues with that is we don\u2019t want to \u2018FOMO\u2019 people into these investments.\n\nYou want them to actually feel confident and comfortable in it and welcomed into our community. That\u2019s a huge part of this.\n\nSo the messaging we\u2019re adopting is actually to look at people who are a little bit more crypto curious. If you don\u2019t know all of this stuff, that\u2019s actually okay \u2014 let us help you. I\u2019ve been running products for five years, Ark\u2019s been researching products for 10 years, in crypto.\n\nThe slogan is \u2018a little bit curious,\u2019 because that\u2019s the whole point. We want people who are interested in our space, see value to it, but [are] nervous to come in feeling confident and welcomed.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about do you know what \u2018GM\u2019 means? It doesn\u2019t matter. That\u2019s not the point. We want you to see the vision for our technology, the vision for what crypto can do, the vision for bitcoin as a new way of thinking about money.\n\nBlockworks: Ark Invest and 21Shares filed for a spot ether ETF in September. With a spot bitcoin ETF now approved, when do you expect a spot ether ETF could hit the market?\n\nSnyder: ETH spot is actually a very different animal.\n\nI think what you\u2019re going to look at is where Ethereum\u2019s current market construction and bitcoin\u2019s current market construction deviate, because that\u2019s a lot of the meat in the 19b-4, and a lot of the meat for how you make these decisions.\n\nWe\u2019re obviously really excited to continue to engage with the regulator on that. We have wanted to have those conversations, so we\u2019re looking forward to the next six months on that one.\n\nThis interview was edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The approval of several Bitcoin spot ETFs marked a watershed moment for the crypto industry, but price action does not agree.\n\nBTC crashed nearly 15% between January 11 and 12, casting doubts on whether the ETF launch is a sell-the-news event.\n\nHistory shows that major events have caused steep sell-offs, while some have marked cycle tops.\n\nThe first Bitcoin spot ETFs were available for trading in the US on January 11, which caused BTC to crash by double digits. This move sparked a debate about whether the ETF approval is a sell-the-news event or will be a turning point to the 2023 bull rally.\n\nRead more: Dissecting the $4.6 billion Bitcoin ETF debut: New capital or clever shuffle?\n\nBitcoin price reaction to spot ETF approval\n\nThe optimism due to the spot ETF approval vanished on January 11 as ETFs were available for trading. The approval from the SEC pushed Bitcoin price up by 6% to $48,975 led to a roughly 15% crash after less than 48 hours.\n\nThe sudden decline in Bitcoin price has prompted investors to worry if this was a sell-the-news event that could trigger a deeper correction or a potential cycle top. Let\u2019s break down some of the popular outlooks that crypto investors expect.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-hour chart\n\nBTC history of sell-the-news events\n\nDecember 18, 2017 - Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) launches the first Bitcoin futures contract. Like Bitcoin spot ETF approval in 2024, this decision from CME was a watershed moment for the crypto industry when the news outlets tagged Bitcoin and the larger crypto market as the Wild West. Regardless, this event marked the cycle top for BTC at $19,785 (or roughly $20,000).\n\nSeptember 23, 2019 - Bakkt platform goes live. This event was considered a gateway for institutional investors. The Bakkt platform launched its digital asset marketplace offering physically settled Bitcoin futures contracts and warehousing. The launch of Bakkt was dubbed a turning point that would attract institutions into crypto, but Bitcoin price crashed 20% in under two days after the launch and continued its descent for nearly three months.\n\nApril 14, 2021 - Coinbase's direct listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, dubbed the Coinbase IPO, was a highly anticipated event. The market was euphoric with the massive success of NFTs, but the high retail interest coupled with the Coinbase IPO marked the bull market rally top at $64,898.\n\nJanuary 11, 2024 - Bitcoin spot ETF approval on January 10 pushed BTC up by roughly 5%, but the pioneer crypto crashed by 15% in the ETFs\u2019 first trading day on January 11.\n\nIs this a sell-the-news event? Let\u2019s explore further.\n\nTo understand if the ETF launch is a sell-the-news event, investors need to know where the selling pressure is coming from. As outlined in a previous article, ETF trading has not attracted new capital as of yet, or at least not enough to overcome the selling pressure.\n\nAccording to CoinGlass data, Grayscale Investment has seen redemption worth nearly $36 billion in the last month. In just the last week, nearly 138.47 BTC worth $5.88 billion of BTC has been redeemed.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s GBTC Holdings\n\nInvestors holding GBTC shares can redeem them by returning those shares to Grayscale in exchange for the underlying Bitcoin. While it might look like it, not all of the redeems amount to selling. Some of these investors could be switching to ETFs due to Grayscale\u2019s high management fees of 1.5%.\n\nDue to Grayscale\u2019s large lock-up period and high fees, the first few days of trading were essentially rebalancing flows, which could have flipped ETF approval euphoria on its belly. But as the smoke clears, retail investors are likely to find that this was a buy-the-dip or rumor event.\n\nConcluding thoughts\n\nNow that the context of the recent crash is clear let\u2019s explore some of the most talked about scenarios that investors are expecting.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nBitcoin price will crash to $12,000: This outlook is held by very few investors, who are expecting a sweep of the sell-side liquidity resting below $24,000 and $15,000. The chances of this happening now are highly unlikely without a major black swan event.\n\nBitcoin price will crash to $35,000: A sizeable group of market participants are expecting this logical outlook. This crash is not unheard of when looking at the previous bull rally corrections.\n\nBitcoin price will continue bull rally to new all-time highs: Unlike the first and the second scenarios, many investors believe this short-term correction could end soon and catalyze BTC to continue its bull rally."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitcoin has not witnessed the same DeFi boom other blockchains have.\n\nHowever, a burgeoning field of decentralized exchanges has emerged that use Bitcoin sidechains to facilitate trading.\n\nMeanwhile, peer-to-peer platforms like Bisq take an alternative approach to decentralization.\n\nSince the development of Uniswap (UNI), the first automated market maker (AMM) protocol on Ethereum (ETH), the concept has been deployed across the crypto ecosystem. Today, decentralized exchanges (DeXs) can be found on almost every popular smart contract platform.\n\nBitcoin, however, has often been ignored by the DeFi movement. Because it wasn\u2019t initially designed to support complex smart contracts, the OG blockchain doesn\u2019t immediately lend itself to AMMs. But thanks to an increasingly sophisticated scaffolding of sidechains and layer 2 networks, DeFi on Bitcoin is now becoming a reality.\n\nBitcoin Sidechains Support DeFi Innovation\n\nAlthough Bitcoin was initially designed as a peer-to-peer payment, these days it is also home to an array of memecoins and NFTs, made possible by Ordinals inscriptions. But while BTC can easily move between network participants, trading multiple tokens with varying prices requires additional infrastructure.\n\nOne solution has been to bridge Bitcoin-based tokens to sidechains like Rootstock or Liquid Network. These borrow Bitcoin\u2019s currency and value system, but support a greater range of smart contracts.\n\n.@Okutrade Incorporates Uniswap v3 into Rootstock's Ecosystem! \u2013 Direct asset swapping and liquidity within the Bitcoin Ecosystem\n\n\u2013 Enhanced trading Uniswap v3's performance on Rootstock, including token pools and liquidity positions.\n\n\u2013 Bolstered Rootstock's DeFi ecosystem with\u2026 pic.twitter.com/13lVLNhY28 \u2014 Rootstock (@rootstock_io) December 13, 2023\n\nIn December 2023, GFX Labs successfully deployed Uniswap v3 on Rootstock, taking advantage of the sidechain\u2019s Ethereum-compatible execution environment to launch a new implementation of the Oku Trade DeX.\n\nMeanwhile, with the goal of moving Ordinals activity away from the Bitcoin mainnet, Bitfinity has developed an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that functions as a Bitcoin sidechain.\n\nAn EVM for Bitcoin Ordinals\n\nUsing the Internet Computer Protocol to transfer assets from Bitcoin without relying on traditional intermediary bridges, the Bitfinity EVM will be able to run Ethereum smart contracts that can interact with BTC and various Ordinals tokens.\n\nIn a press release shared with CCN, Bitfinity said that ICP \u201chas made BTC accessible in the DeFi space for the first time.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Bitfinity has raised $7M to date from phenomenal Web3 investors to foster development of the Bitfinity Network ecosystem \u2013 EVM, Wallet, open source dev tooling, and more!! \ud83e\uddf5\n\n\ud83c\udf10 https://t.co/K1gVYZXEo6 #BITFINIANS pic.twitter.com/jVEq4LTPrn \u2014 Bitfinity Network (@bitfinitynet) January 13, 2024\n\nThanks to its native Bitcoin integration, ICP already supports a burgeoning ecosystem of decentralized apps. These include DeFi exchanges and NFT marketplaces facilitating the trade of BRC-20 tokens on the Bitcoin sidechain. This opens up the emerging market for Ordinals-based tokens to more sophisticated DeFi service. But it also promises to significantly increase the efficiency of Ordinals swaps, potentially reducing the network congestion created by surging Ordinals trading activity.\n\nDecentralizing Bitcoin\u2013Fiat Swaps\n\nAMM-powered DeFi exchanges remove the need for centralized intermediaries in crypto-to-crypto transactions. However, most people still rely on traditional exchanges to move value between the cryptosphere and the traditional financial system.\n\nThe prevalence of centralized fiat on- and off-ramps jars with the vision of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer payment system. This, in turn, contrasts with the way the technology\u2019s earliest adopters bought and sold BTC.\n\nBisq operates as a peer-to-peer trade network where users can swap BTC for fiat currencies. This follows the tradition of the early crypto traders who exchanged Bitcoin with each other directly,\n\nFor each trade on Bisq, a multi-signature escrow account holds crypto. The money moves after the seller confirms that they have got their crypto. Supported payment methods include bank transfer, cash deposit and Western Union, among others.\n\nTraders are free to set their own conditions to protect themselves from fraud. Restrictions on new accounts ensure only users who have successfully completed a certain number of transactions can engage in higher value trades. When disputes arise, Bisq assigns independent mediators and arbitrators to review evidence from counterparties and propose a solution.\n\nBisq is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that uses a type of \u201ccolored \u201d Bitcoin \u2013 BSQ \u2013 as its governance token. Alongside voting on protocol upgrades, the Bisq DAO also decides how to spend treasury funds generated by trading fees."

        "title": "Forget Bitcoin ETFs: Buy This No-Brainer ETF Instead - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The first exchange-traded funds tracking the spot price of Bitcoin (BTC -6.58%) began trading last week after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission gave the go-ahead. Investors will no longer need to pay sky-high transaction fees at a cryptocurrency exchange like Coinbase. Instead, numerous low-fee Bitcoin ETFs now provide no-fuss access to the digital asset.\n\nThe SEC approved 11 separate Bitcoin ETFs, many of which are waiving fees for some time as they battle for market share. One of those ETFs is Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which operated under a more complex structure with high fees before it converted to an ETF following SEC approval. Fees on these new Bitcoin ETFs will range from 0.2% to 1.5% excluding waivers.\n\nA speculative asset\n\nWith Bitcoin now available in ETF format backed by well-known players including Fidelity and BlackRock, the digital currency gains some much-needed legitimacy. The cryptocurrency industry has been rocked by fraud and scandal over the past few years. Trusting a cryptocurrency exchange after FTX was revealed to be a fraud and Binance pleaded guilty to Federal money laundering charges is likely a tough sell for many investors.\n\nWhile it's now much easier and cheaper to invest in Bitcoin, that doesn't mean the pioneer cryptocurrency is a good investment. After nearly 16 years of existence, Bitcoin has yet to find a wide-scale, real-world use outside of criminal enterprises. And as a gold-like asset meant to protect investors against inflation, it suffers the same shortcomings as the shiny yellow metal.\n\n\"...the one thing I'm pretty sure of is that it doesn't produce anything,\" said billionaire investor Warren Buffett in 2022 regarding Bitcoin. \"Assets, to have value, have to deliver something to somebody,\" Buffett continued.\n\nAn ETF alternative\n\nInvestors can use these new Bitcoin ETFs to speculate on the price of Bitcoin, but as long-term investments, they carry incredibly high risks. Sticking a speculative asset backed by nothing but the Greater Fool Theory in a different type of investment vehicle doesn't reduce risk.\n\nFor investors who want to own assets that produce something, an ETF that tracks the S&P 500 is a great option. There are plenty available, but the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO -0.22%) is one of the most popular.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF aims to replicate the performance of the S&P 500 index, which contains 500 of the largest U.S.-listed companies. Buying a share of the ETF buys you a small stake in each of those companies. Unlike Bitcoin, which does nothing, a company generates cash flow by selling products and services, then uses that cash flow to invest in assets that will generate even more cash flow. Some companies pay investors a dividend, giving them a direct share of its profits.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF gives investors a highly diversified mix of stocks for a rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.03%, nearly seven times lower than the cheapest Bitcoin ETF. Since inception in 2010, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has delivered an annualized return of just under 14%. That's historically high, so returns going forward may not be quite as lucrative. But as U.S. companies grow sales and expand profits in the years ahead, this ETF allows investors to share in that success.\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry has entered a new era with the approval of the first Bitcoin ETFs. While investors can now buy Bitcoin with the same ease with which they buy stocks, and without the excessive fees, Bitcoin is no better as an investment than before the ETF approval. I agree with Buffett: Bitcoin is a purely speculative asset with no intrinsic value. Long-term investors would do well to choose the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF instead."

        "content": "Halvings are typically considered bullish events as they slash the block reward in half for miners, constricting the supply of the asset. At consistent demand if the supply reduces, the asset\u2019s price climbs. This has been observed in Bitcoin and Litecoin.\n\nMacroeconomic events like the US Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on interest rates influence risk assets like Bitcoin, mainly through the direct impact they have on the US Dollar. An increase in interest rate typically negatively influences Bitcoin and altcoin prices, and vice versa. If the US Dollar index declines, risk assets and associated leverage for trading gets cheaper, in turn driving crypto prices higher.\n\nA hack is an event in which an attacker captures a large volume of the asset from a DeFi bridge or hot wallet of an exchange or any other crypto platform via exploits, bugs or other methods. The exploiter then transfers these tokens out of the exchange platforms to ultimately sell or swap the assets for other cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. Such events often involve an en masse panic triggering a sell-off in the affected assets.\n\nToken launches like Arbitrum\u2019s ARB airdrop and Optimism OP influence demand and adoption among market participants. Listings on crypto exchanges deepen the liquidity for an asset and add new participants to an asset\u2019s network. This is typically bullish for a digital asset.\n\nBitcoin price fell to the $41,707 level, below its two long-term 10-day and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) at $43,710 and $42,094, respectively. BTC hit a two-year peak $48,989 on January 11, before dropping to support at $41,707.\n\nAt the current price, 79.33% of BTC wallet addresses are profitable, on-chain data shows. Crypto analysts have said that BTC issuers\u2019 accumulation of the asset could catalyze a recovery in the cryptocurrency as it fuels demand.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price slipped to its support zone on Monday as market participants turned their attention to Ethereum and altcoins. BTC Spot ETF approvals by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) turned out to be a \u201csell the news\u201d event, with Bitcoin suffering a 15% decline in its price.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

        "title": "Vanguard Ditches ETFs While Betting Big on MicroStrategy - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nVanguard said it won\u2019t offer spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds approved last week.\n\nIt is also investing a huge amount of dollars in MicroStrategy, a company that has amassed a large amount of Bitcoin.\n\nWhy does Vanguard ditch ETFs but invest in MSTR?\n\nBig money manager Vanguard Group may have shunned spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), but it is quietly making a big bet on the cryptocurrency through its investment in MicroStrategy, the enterprise software company that has amassed a large Bitcoin holding.\n\nThis paradoxical stance highlights the growing debate over Vanguard\u2019s view of Bitcoin as an investment asset. Vanguard\u2019s decision to invest in MicroStrategy signals that it is taking Bitcoin seriously, but its cautious approach to ETFs suggests that it is still grappling with the cryptocurrency\u2019s risks.\n\nVanguard Ditches Bitcoin ETFs\n\nVanguard Group\u2019s brokerage division has opted against facilitating trading in ETFs directly tied to Bitcoin. Although the awaited approval of Bitcoin ETFs has sparked heightened demand for these investment instruments, individual firms retain the discretion to determine their participation. This cautious stance is frequently linked to the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency asset class, prompting firms like Vanguard to prioritize long-term returns over potential short-term fluctuations. VERY IMPRESSED. Fidelity is LIGHT YEARS ahead of Vanguard. TODAY, they\u2019re calling existing customers already exposed to bitcoin-related securities (like mining stocks, etc.) to address any questions about the Bitcoin ETFs. That is how you treat customers. #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/hS04YO0IvJ \u2014 Neil Jacobs (@NeilJacobs) January 12, 2024 As a result, some Vanguard customers have shifted their investments to Fidelity, seizing the opportunity presented by the latter\u2019s embrace of the new ETFs. In fact, as previously reported by CCN, Yuga Cohler, a senior engineering manager at Coinbase, is among a group of individuals signaling their intent to shift their Roth 401(k) savings from Vanguard to Fidelity. Notably, Fidelity stands out as an issuer of one of the ten recently launched Bitcoin ETFs on January 11, reflecting a more proactive approach in incorporating cryptocurrency products into their investment offerings.\n\nStake In MicroStrategy\n\nWhat\u2019s intriguing is Vanguard\u2019s paradoxical position. Despite its cautious stance on ETFs and Bitcoin due to perceived risks, it emerges as a significant investor in MicroStrategy. MicroStrategy, led by Michael J. Saylor, focuses extensively on Bitcoin trading. Vanguard Group, as per September 2023 data from Yahoo Finance, held 1,126,980 MSTR shares, securing its position as the second-largest institutional shareholder with an 8.24% ownership stake. MicroStrategy shares also feature in various Vanguard investment funds, including the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, the Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund, the Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund, and the Vanguard Small-Cap Growth Index Fund. Notably, MicroStrategy and its subsidiaries have accumulated 189,150 BTC over the past few years, valued at approximately $5.9 billion. The heightened interest in Bitcoin ETFs in 2023 propelled MSTR\u2019s stock price. This led some analysts to dub it as \u201cessentially a leveraged Bitcoin ETF.\u201d\n\nMSTR Is Better Than Bitcoin\n\nBill Miller IV, Chief Investment Officer of Miller Value Partners, underscored the significance of these ETFs. He said they are a major stride for institutional capital entering the cryptocurrency domain.\n\nWhile acknowledging their importance, he presented an alternative investment that he believes outshines the benefits of a spot Bitcoin ETF \u2013 MicroStrategy (MSTR).\n\nAccording to Miller, MicroStrategy offers distinct advantages over a spot Bitcoin ETF. Notably, it boasts higher liquidity and, as the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin owner, avoids associated fees. Miller emphasized the value of being the foremost holder of a new technological asset, citing long-term potential.\n\nAdditionally, he said MicroStrategy\u2019s CEO is a further appeal. Sailor is a substantial shareholder with significant personal Bitcoin holdings and a robust technological background,.\n\nDiscussing MicroStrategy\u2019s unique business model, Miller noted its flexibility to adjust its value by selling shares to purchase Bitcoin. It also buys back shares based on market conditions. This adaptable approach, he argued, benefits ongoing shareholders and contributes long-term value."

        "content": "J.P. Morgan analysts are doubtful about the promise of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nThe banking giant thinks bitcoin ETFs will draw substantial funds from other crypto products, just not new capital, CoinDesk reported Monday (Jan. 15), citing an analyst note.\n\nLast week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot bitcoin ETFs, but since then, the market reaction has been subdued, the report said. The focus has instead moved to how much capital the new funds will attract.\n\n\u201cWe are skeptical of the optimism shared by many market participants at the moment that a lot of fresh capital will enter the crypto space as a result of the spot bitcoin ETF approval,\u201d the analysts\u2019 note said, per the report.\n\nHowever, the analysts still project that funds from existing products will move into the new ETFs, to the tune of up to $36 billion, the report said.\n\nJ.P. Morgan made the same argument last year before the funds were approved, writing that ETFs have gotten little attention from investors since being introduced in Canada and Europe.\n\nAt the same time, many crypto proponents had argued that the SEC\u2019s approval would signal a softening of the regulator\u2019s stance on digital currencies.\n\nThe bank rejected that argument too, writing \u201cit is far from clear that the regulatory tightening of the crypto industry will lessen significantly going forward given how unregulated this industry is.\u201d\n\nThe SEC said last week that its opinion hadn\u2019t changed, with Chair Gary Gensler calling bitcoin a \u201cspeculative, volatile asset\u201d in a statement following the approval.\n\n\u201cWhile we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse bitcoin,\u201d Gensler said at the time. \u201cInvestors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.\u201d\n\nSetting aside the SEC\u2019s views, PYMNTS wrote earlier this month that bitcoin still has a long way to go to gain popular acceptance. It is the most popular cryptocurrency, yet only 16% of the general population owns crypto.\n\nThen there\u2019s the question of volatility, noted the report, written at a time when bitcoin was worth 157% more than it had been a year prior.\n\nFor all PYMNTS crypto coverage, subscribe to the daily Crypto Newsletter."
