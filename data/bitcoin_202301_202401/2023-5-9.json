        "title": "When to Buy Bitcoin? Is Bitcoin a Good Investment Now? - Macrohive",
        "content": "[Updated 16 May 2023]\n\nSummary\n\nWe look at the latest bitcoin trends, including macro risks and on-chain/flow metrics, to reveal the best time to buy bitcoin and the risks of buying BTC.\n\nFor trading bitcoin over the next two to four weeks, we are slightly bearish. That means we expect stable to falling prices.\n\nHowever, we also think bitcoin is a good long-term investment for the next one to three years and are bullish overall. That means we expect the bitcoin price to rise in the long term.\n\nIs Now a Good Time to Buy Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin had a great start to 2023, reversing the downward trend seen throughout the end of 2022. From $16,000 on 1 January, it has risen 63% to $27,152 so far this year. Last month, the BTC price even exceeded $30,000 on hopes that the Fed\u2019s hiking cycle was nearing completion and that inflation was calming down.\n\nHowever, recent weeks have seen bitcoin retrace its steps. We think the main reason for this is a deteriorating macro backdrop. The labour market remains very tight. Inflation remains way above target (April CPI showed little progress on disinflation, with core goods rising 0.6% due to a 4.4% increase in used care prices). And Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently said \u2018\u2018the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go.\u2019\n\nCurrently, the markets are assigning merely a 5% chance of a 25 basis point increase by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in June. From our perspective, the markets are underpricing the likelihood of such a hike. Considering the ongoing inflation and growth dynamics, it is probable that a 25 basis point increase will occur in June (unless a debt ceiling crisis arises), which would have a bearish effect on bitcoin.\n\nShould you buy BTC now? The quick answer is \u2018probably not\u2019. The macro backdrop for bitcoin is bearish. We analyse various on-chain/flow metrics for bitcoin, which are neutral. So, overall, we are slightly bearish. Therefore, if you have a two-to-four-week horizon, now may not be a good time to buy bitcoin.\n\nShould I Buy BTC Now? Probably Not\n\nWhy Has the BTC Price Gone Up?\n\nOne of the primary drivers of the recent rise in bitcoin price is the goldilocks market regime that developed in early 2023. Inflation in the US has fallen from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to 4.9%, and consequently, the Fed has been able to slow its rate hikes. Some even believe the Fed has now stopped hiking. Markets are pricing rate cuts for 2023, bolstering risk assets such as equities and crypto. Also, crypto benefitted during the US banking crisis as investors questioned the security of TradFi.\n\nWhy Has the BTC Price Dropped?\n\nBefore the early 2023 bull run, bitcoin was having a miserable time. This was due to several events, both crypto-specific and part of the broader macro backdrop. You can see the current BTC price on the chart below and its historical progress through 2022.\n\nThe FTX Collapse: Catalyst for a BTC Price Crash\n\nA significant event to negatively impact the BTC price was the spectacular collapse of crypto exchange FTX. Bitcoin had traded in a tight range between $18,500 and $20,000 during September and October 2022. However, it fell 26% as news of the collapse emerged, and the coin has only just recovered past those levels.\n\nHigher Interest Rates: A Worrying Backdrop for Bitcoin\n\nHowever, even the recent FTX chaos fails to detract from the longer-term decline in crypto markets. Since its all-time high of $68,789 on 12 November 2021, bitcoin has fallen 60%. Likewise, ethereum \u2013 the other major player in the crypto space \u2013 is down 60% from its 2021 high of $4,891. These declines follow the broader selloff of 2022, which extended across equities, bonds, and real estate.\n\nThe generic risk-asset rout began at the end of 2021. Central banks are largely to blame as they raise interest rates to reduce demand in overheating economies following the pandemic stimulus. By December 2022, the Federal Reserve (Fed) had raised its policy rate to the highest level in 15 years, capping off four 75bp hikes with another 50bp hike at the end of the year. After another 25bps in February 2023, the policy rate now sits at 4.75-5.00%.\n\nMoreover, there are ongoing fears that the effects of high inflation and rising interest rates will plunge the world into a recession. Our recession probability indicator remains over 70%. Bitcoin is yet to experience a serious global recession, but we expect one would limit any potential upside in price action. This is because during times of economic uncertainty and weak growth, investors may be more inclined to sell risky assets like bitcoin and seek safer investments such as government bonds.\n\nHow Low Can Bitcoin Prices Go?\n\nOne exercise is to see how low prices could get were the NASDAQ to suffer a 2000-style crash. After all, earlier in 2021, the bitcoin and NASDAQ correlation reached highs of almost 80%. So where the NASDAQ went, bitcoin followed. The correlation has declined recently, but should it rise again, the historical drawdowns of NASDAQ could be informative.\n\nBack in 2000, the NASDAQ suffered a 78% drawdown. As of November 2022, the NASDAQ is in a 27% drawdown. A repeat of the 2000-style drawdown would put the NASDAQ at 3,500. So where would crypto be if NASDAQ were trading at this level? We estimate a regression between bitcoin/ethereum returns and NASDAQ returns from 2020 onwards. Based on this relationship, we find:\n\nBitcoin prices would reach $8,254 if the NASDAQ fell to 3,500. This implies a 72% decline from current levels.\n\nEthereum prices would reach $143 if the NASDAQ fell to 3,500. This implies a 92% decline from current levels.\n\nWhat Else Is Happening in Crypto?\n\nRegulation is becoming more of a theme throughout 2023, with various executive orders signed already. Increased regulation should mean less uncertainty around crypto markets for investors, which would be bullish.\n\nOn the flip side, overregulation could stifle innovation. Coinbase flirts with move outside the US due to regulatory pressures. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong recently noted at the Innovate Finance Global Summit this week that the \u2018UK is our second-largest market in terms of revenue. We\u2019re founded in the US, and I think the US has the potential to be an important market in crypto \u2013 but right now, we\u2019re not seeing the regulatory clarity we need.\u2019 Coinbase recently secured a licence to operate in Bermuda, too.\n\nThe ongoing regulatory backdrop will be key to monitor.\n\nThere are several events to keep track of over the coming weeks that will influence crypto prices:\n\nRising yields have mechanically increased the probability of a recession within the next 12 months to 80%. Inflation remains at the forefront of investors\u2019 minds, with data cooling but still elevated. Is crypto decoupling from equities? The moves lower in crypto markets this week disagree with traditional equity indices such as the tech-heavy NASDAQ. The NASDAQ is currently up +1% MTD compared to bitcoin and ethereum which are down -10% MTD and -6% MTD, respectively. Individual wallets containing at least one bitcoin (BTC) reached one million earlier this week. This indicates that the long-term sentiment towards these tokens remains strong, despite the downward pressure on bitcoin prices caused by broader market conditions.\n\nSummary of BTC Analysis\n\nThe bottom line is that crypto, including bitcoin, is experiencing a correction after a strong rally. It found support from the Fed\u2019s downshift in hiking and the broader bullish sentiment towards risk assets as the US banking crisis receded. This benign macro backdrop is starting to deteriorate, and we would caution against expecting another short-term rise in prices. For long-term investors, we think some allocation to crypto makes sense \u2013 just like an allocation to equities also makes sense.\n\nFor all our latest analysis on crypto markets, click here.\n\nBitcoin and Crypto Price Trackers\n\nUpdated 16 May 2023\n\nThis week, all our indices are in the red, with our Bitcoin Index (-6.3% WoW) down the least and our Metaverse Index (-15.6% WoW) down the most (Chart 2).\n\nOur Smart Contract Index remains most correlated to our Bitcoin Index (+87%).

With the length of the blockchain continuing to grow and decentralised finance (DeFi) gaining ground over traditional finance, this new asset class is reshaping the investment landscape.\n\nWe think bitcoin is a worthwhile long-term investment. However, we also note that bitcoin is extremely volatile. That means it experiences large price movements over short periods. Before investing, you must understand the risks involved: you could lose all or a large portion of your investment. Never invest money that you cannot afford to lose.\n\nHow to Make Money Investing in Bitcoin\n\nIt is easy to get carried away with the fear of missing out. You are probably aware of Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who are reputed to be the world\u2019s first bitcoin billionaires with over 100,000 coins. Or what about Barry Silbert, the owner of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Coinbase and Coinbase? Success stories like these often give people FOMO \u2013 or the fear of missing out \u2013 if they do not invest immediately.\n\nHowever, to invest in cryptocurrency, we must first understand it. Crypto tokens are unlike any traditional asset class. And they are all different. Just because you understand bitcoin, does not mean you know how ethereum works. Our video on bitcoin fundamentals can help you understand how bitcoin prices fluctuate and how to assess trends in important bitcoin metrics.\n\nEach currency has different underlying protocols and technology. That impacts how they trade, their volatility, and how you can value them. Some are more like stocks, others commodities, and others currencies. And each crypto token has a unique structure of supply.\n\nWe think crypto markets are a worthwhile long-term investment. The technology can capture market share on some existing markets like payments and stock trading while creating new markets like valuable scarce digital assets.\n\nWhen to Buy Bitcoin: Buying the Dip\n\nSome say the best time to buy bitcoin is during price dips. This seems alluring at first \u2013 catching a cheap price and benefitting from the rebound. However, timing dips is notoriously tricky and frought with risk. What happens if it wasn\u2019t a dip but the start of a long-term decline in prices?\n\nWe suggest paying attention to the long-term macro backdrop when asking yourself, should I buy bitcoin right now? Your exposure to bitcoin needs to be appropriately sized so that you can survive 50% to 80% drawdowns. Drawdowns provide good entry levels for exposure, but we would not go max long in an environment of rising central bank rates and falling global growth momentum.\n\nTop Three Tips You Need to Know Before Investing in Bitcoin\n\nWhere to Buy Bitcoin\n\nTo buy bitcoin (BTC) or any other cryptocurrency, you need access to a crypto exchange. A crypto exchange is where buyers and sellers meet to exchange money for coins, coins for other coins, and coins for money. Many options are available such as Coinbase, Binance.com, or eToro \u2013 each come with various fee structures, so research which is best for your needs.\n\nYou also need access to a crypto wallet to store bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Many exchanges provide these, but not all do. You can also buy bitcoin on platforms like Paypal and Robinhood.\n\nDollar-Cost Averaging\n\nCryptocurrencies can be extremely volatile. One way to cope with the volatility is to use dollar-cost averaging. Dollar-cost averaging is a strategy where you divide the total amount you want to invest across periodic purchases of the target asset. It simply means that you would invest the same number of dollars each month or quarter, regardless of market trends.\n\nThe idea is that when prices are high, you can afford less of the asset. But when prices are low, you can afford more. When the market recovers, you benefit from having bought more shares at the lower price. Please note that using this strategy will not always result in a profit or necessarily protect you from falling prices.\n\nDiversify Your Crypto Portfolio\n\nWith the crypto landscape so volatile and diverse, managing risk in a portfolio is critical. That essentially means position sizing and diversification \u2013 as with any other kind of investment.\n\nOne of the best pieces of investment advice we have heard recently comes from Ari Paul, co-founder and CIO of Blocktower Capital, a crypto and blockchain investment firm. As Paul says,\n\n\u2018Risk is only sizing. So, if you think bitcoin is too risky, you could size it at 0.1% of your portfolio or 0.001%. Too risky is never a reason not to own an asset. If something is positive expected value, risk adjusted, and relatively low correlation, you have to own it. That\u2019s peak portfolio management 101.\u2019\n\nOne way to diversify your portfolio is with stablecoins, although these have also been very high-risk following the Terra debacle. Our recent analysis has explored how safe is tether and which stablecoins could fall next.\n\nFAQs\n\n\u2192 Is now a good time to buy bitcoin?\n\nFor trading bitcoin over the next two to four weeks, we are slightly bearish. That means we expect falling prices. However, we think bitcoin is a good long-term investment for the next one to three years and are bullish overall. That means we expect prices to rise in the long term.\n\n\u2192 When was bitcoin at its lowest?\n\nSince the start of 2021, bitcoin was at its lowest on 22 November 2022, when the BTC price was $15,711. Of course, prior to bitcoin\u2019s major bull run in late 2020, it was much lower \u2013 under $10,000. However, bitcoin has not reverted to these lows even amid significant drawdowns.\n\n\u2192 Can you lose your money buying BTC now?\n\nAs with all investments, the value of bitcoin can rise as well as fall. While it is unlikely that bitcoin will suffer a complete loss of value, investors must be prepared to suffer drawdowns of between 50% and 80%. We recommend small allocations and diversification of your portfolio. Never invest what you cannot afford to lose.\n\n\u2192 When to sell bitcoin?\n\nTraditional wisdom says you should buy low and sell high. But whether you should sell bitcoin depends on your investment horizon, risk appetite and financial goals. Although some websites speculate that certain days of the week are better or worse than others for selling bitcoin, we believe that any decision to buy or sell should be based on an analysis of crypto fundamentals.\n\n\u2192 Should I invest in crypto?\n\nWe think some cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH are a worthwhile long-term investment. However, they are also extremely volatile. That means large price movements over short periods are common. Before investing, you must understand the risks involved: you could lose all or a large portion of your investment. Never invest money that you cannot afford to lose.\n\nAppendix: What Are in the Four Indices?\n\nBitcoin: the OG of crypto markets deserves its own category and is in many ways the true benchmark for any other crypto market.\n\nSmart contract platforms: after bitcoin, the big innovation was to have blockchains that were more programmable. These could host smart contracts or decentralised applications and have allowed the emergence of the metaverse and defi. Ethereum (ETH) is the most popular version of a smart contract platform. As well as ethereum, we also include some key competitors. The constituents of this index are: Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), Solana (SOL), Fantom (FTM), VeChain (VET), Terra (LUNA), EOS (EOS), and Chainlink (LINK). We also include Polkadot (DOT) which allows interoperability between blockchains and the use of smart contracts via parachains.\n\nMetaverse: coins associated with the creation of a virtual space/digital world on the internet using a combination of augmented reality, virtual reality, and social networks. The constituents of this index are Axie Infinity (AXS), The Sandbox (SAND), Decentraland (MANA), Enjin Coin (ENJ), Aavegotchi (GHST), Terra Virtua Kolect (TVK), Ultra (UOS), Phantasma (SOUL), RedFOX Labs (RFOX), and Gala (GALA).\n\nDecentralised Finance (DeFi): financial services built on top of blockchain networks with no central intermediaries. This can be a broad category, so we narrow this down to platforms that focus on lending/borrowing, yield farming, automated market making and decentralised exchange tokens. The constituents of this index are: Aave (AAVE), Compound (COMP), Uniswap (UNI), Yearn.finance (YFI), Loopring (LRC), PancakeSwap (CAKE), Maker (MKR), 1inch (1INCH), Thorchain (RUNE), and Terra (LUNA).\n\nPrivacy Coins: coins that obscure transactions on the blockchain to maintain the anonymity of its users and their activity. The constituents of this index are Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC), Dash (DASH), Verge (XVG), Horizen (ZEN), Beam (BEAM), Secret (SCRT), Decred (DCR), Keep Network (KEEP), and Dusk Network (DUSK).\n\nDalvir Mandara is a Quantitative Researcher at Macro Hive.

        "title": "How SpongeBob and Pepe Are Causing Big Problems for Bitcoin - New York Magazine",
        "content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Nickelodeon\n\nIt\u2019s been a little while since the world of digital currencies has had a real blowup. After the collapse of FTX and the arrest of its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, rattled both the financial and political systems of the United States, the scandal du jour is a nice return to familiar territory: one involving stupid memes.\n\nThe immediate crisis is that if you want to buy or sell bitcoin right now, it is very hard to do so. The network that processes bitcoin transactions is all jammed up \u2014 at its peak, there have been more than 400,000 orders that are essentially stuck in a queue. These are all transactions that have built up over days, causing the price for conducting one to spike to about $20. (Last month, it was as low as 87 cents.) It\u2019s not a perfect analogy (there are workarounds for bitcoin), but imagine paying for your groceries with a Visa card, but then being told you have to wait hours or days until all the transitions ahead of yours go through \u2014 and, oh yeah, there will also be a $20 fee.\n\nImagine you get to your bank's drive through and there are 400,000 cars in front of you.\n\n\n\nThat's #bitcoin right now. \u2014 Jason A. Williams (@GoingParabolic) May 8, 2023\n\nBut what\u2019s funny here is that all those other people in the bitcoin queue aren\u2019t buying groceries. They\u2019re sending each other memes. These aren\u2019t elevated or important memes \u2014 we\u2019re literally talking about Pepe the Frog and SpongeBob. While the core bitcoin blockchain has long been dominated by data about transactions (account A sending account B a given amount of bitcoin currency), recent innovations have made it cheaper and faster for people to write all kinds of data into the transaction, including pictures and jokes \u2014 a process called \u201cinscribing.\u201d So now bitcoin is a platform for not only bitcoin transactions, but for NFTs \u2014 recall those blockchain-based images like the Bored Apes that everyone was (very) briefly excited about \u2014 and joke coins that are all basically aspiring dogecoins. Two meme-coin projects, one based on the amphibian Pepe and the other on SpongeBob, are currently enjoying a major speculative boom, both acting like it\u2019s 2021 again. The demand is so wild that meme coins like these did $2.3 billion in volume last week. The resulting network congestion was so bad that Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, was forced to temporarily suspend bitcoin withdrawals.\n\nSo the big questions today \u2014 at least, among the kinds of people who spend much of their time thinking about bitcoin \u2014 are around whether this kind of innovation is a good thing or a bad thing. Was the underlying system really built for handling these kinds of transactions? Was the bitcoin blockchain meant to be inscribed with millions of stupid, fleeting jokes and memes? Or is this all fine and are the queues just a momentary growing pain as bitcoin expands into new use cases (ridiculous as they may be)? \u201cThe Bitcoin network has gradually supported more different types of tokens like NFTs. This adoption should be a positive sign longer term but it looks like it has slowed down the network,\u201d an analyst at Oppenheimer wrote, according to CNBC, tentatively taking a position in the optimists\u2019 camp.\n\nThis whole mess came out of an upgrade to the bitcoin system last year, which was supposed to have made transactions faster and cheaper. When bitcoins are traded, the transactions are recorded on the blockchain, the immutable ledger of who owns what that\u2019s the founding innovation for the whole crypto economy. \u201cIt\u2019s always been possible to inscribe data into a transaction on bitcoin. That\u2019s nothing new,\u201d Cory Klippsten, CEO of the financial-services firm Swan Bitcoin, told me. After last year\u2019s upgrade made it easier to transmit data, \u201cit wasn\u2019t long before anyone could invent a more lightweight way to do it,\u201d he said. The new ways to do this are bitcoin-adjacent systems called Ordinals and Stamps.\n\nBitcoin is, of course, the original cryptocurrency and, until now anyway, its proponents have seen it as more pure, less junky and corrupt than the rest of the crypto world. It doesn\u2019t function like a backdoor equity offering for funding some other venture \u2014 a model that\u2019s led to all kinds of scammy tokens, as well as a crackdown by the Securities and Exchange Commission for companies violating securities laws. Because profits from bitcoin-trading can\u2019t feed back to some corporate source (the network was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, who mysteriously vanished afterward, and now nobody owns it or controls it), it\u2019s regulated as a commodity \u2014 like a barrel of oil, or a bushel of wheat.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s biggest cheerleaders are called Bitcoin Maxis (or maximalists). For years, they have mocked other crypto projects (a.k.a altcoins) for being unserious and scammy. Now, after the spectacular run-up in Pepe coins, they face the uncomfortable reality that the shitcoiners (as they call their foes) are have, at least temporarily, taken over their precious network.\n\nKlippsten, himself something of a bitcoin purist, sees the rest of the crypto universe trying to borrow bitcoin\u2019s cred. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to altcoiners whose whole goal is to grab some shine from bitcoin, do the bitcoin affinity thing, and then do some pump and dump with their shitcoin projects,\u201d he said. From the outside, it sure seems like these newest meme coins are showing that the line between bitcoin and the rest of crypto was never really all that hard to begin with. Bitcoin Maxis like Klippsten don\u2019t see it that way though. \u201cFor bitcoin, this changes nothing,\u201d he said."

        "content": "Bitcoin fell on Thursday morning in Asia to trade around the US$27,500 mark, after briefly breaching US$28,000 on Wednesday as U.S. inflation slowed. Liquidity is becoming a concern after major market makers Jane Street Group and Jump Crypto quit cryptocurrency trading in the U.S. citing unfavorable regulations.

        "title": "Are crypto markets correlated with macroeconomic factors? - S&P Global",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency prices seem to be less affected by macroeconomic factors than prices of more traditional financial assets. Key drivers for crypto assets include market confidence, adoption, technology and liquidity conditions (see Table)\u00b9. By contrast, traditional financial assets are strongly influenced by macroeconomic drivers, such as interest rates and inflation. These traditional assets also differ from crypto in being subject to government regulations and in being more transparent in terms of know your-customer requirements and anti money laundering measures.\n\nTable 1\n\nInterconnections between the crypto ecosystem and macroeconomic factors show up in the fact that favorable market conditions increase investors\u2019 appetite for higher risk assets, such as crypto currencies. Changes in interest rates and borrowing costs could impact crypto markets through different channels than for traditional assets. For example, financing costs influence venture capital firms\u2019 decisions to invest in startups that want to build applications on blockchains (such as Ethereum), and consequently drive blockchain adoption. Likewise, for blockchains that lack an application layer and only have a transaction layer (such as Bitcoin), higher costs for financing mining rigs and warehouse space will lower marginal profits for miners. This difference is explained by the crypto assets\u2019 different value proposition. Bitcoin\u2019s value proposition is determined by transaction volumes and mining of these transactions, while Ether\u2019s comes from transaction validation, and additionally through the utility of applications built on the Ethereum blockchain. Due to their short history and speculative nature, we acknowledge that existing trends may change. New trends might affect how macroeconomic factors impact the crypto ecosystem, especially as more retail and institutional investors expand their investment portfolios to include crypto.\n\nThe recent period of historically low interest rates fueled investors\u2019 appetite for higher-yielding assets. The 2021 bull run in the crypto market coincided with a period of ultra-loose monetary conditions, eliciting the question of what impact, if any, low interest rates had on crypto valuations. By the same logic, as we are in a period of tighter monetary conditions, driven by higher interest rates and the reversal of Quantitative Easing (QE) \u2013 known commonly as Quantitative Tightening (QT) \u2013 it is of interest to understand the impact these dynamics will have. To better understand this relationship, we dove into the crypto ecosystem and analyzed the relationship with key macroeconomic factors using data through March 2023.\n\nIn this article we address the following questions: 1. Does monetary policy matter to crypto markets? a. Do crypto prices correlate to changes in interest rates? b. Do quantitative easing and tightening make a difference in cryptocurrency markets? c. Is money supply important for the crypto ecosystem? 2. Does perception of a possible incoming recession matter for crypto markets? 3. Can crypto assets be a hedge against inflation? 4. What does a strong or weak dollar mean for crypto markets? 5. Do financial stress and market volatility spill over into the crypto ecosystem?\n\n1. Does monetary policy matter to crypto markets?\n\nThe past decade appears to show that crypto markets perform well when there is fast growth in a broad measure of money supply (M2), stemming from a reduction in interest rates, quantitative easing and fiscal stimulus. Conversely, monetary tightening seems to have restricted appreciation of crypto assets, or even contributed to depreciation. In this section, we analyze how these relationships hold over time and focus on interest rates, and other monetary policy measures that influence money supply, such as quantitative easing.\n\nA. Do crypto prices correlate with changes in interest rates?\n\nThe US Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed\u2019s) actions influence the global economy, arguably including crypto markets. Low interest rates increase appetite for assets with higher risk and higher returns. In reaction to the decline in economic activity as a result of the Great Recession (2007-2009), the Fed and other central banks lowered interest rates to zero and held them at that level for just shy of a decade. During that period, demand for higher-yielding assets, including speculative grade credit was very strong. Global high yield issuance increased from less than $50 billion in 2009 to more than $250 billion in 2014. This demand for higher-yielding assets could also have extended to crypto assets.\n\nConversely, when the Fed, and other major central banks increase benchmark interest rates, higher-yielding assets become less attractive. It could be argued that the same applies to crypto assets. We analyze whether this inverse relationship between interest rates and crypto prices is supported by the data.\n\nWe use the risk-neutral yield on the 2-year US Treasury bond to gauge short-term market expectations on the evolution of US interest rates \u2013 it reflects what markets are pricing in for the Fed funds rates two years from today, according to the ACM model developed by the Fed. To study the crypto markets, we use the S&P Cryptocurrency Broad Digital Market Index (S&P BDMI). We focus our analysis on data from February 2017 (when the index started) to March 2023. In some cases, we look at longer time periods and will use Bitcoin prices.\n\nThe S&P Cryptocurrency Broad Digital Market Index (S&P BDMI) reflects a broad investable universe of digital assets listed on open digital exchanges. Assets have to meet minimum liquidity and market capitalization criteria. Lukka is the pricing provider. The index is weighted by the equivalent of market capitalization for cryptocurrencies (coin supply multiplied by coin price). Bitcoin represents 40% of S&P BDMI, so the index is highly correlated with Bitcoin prices.\n\nIn Chart 1, we plot S&P BDMI and the 2-year Risk-Neutral Treasury Yield. Since 2017, the two indices exhibit a historical correlation of \u20130.33.\n\nChart 1\n\nOn a daily rolling three-month basis (chart 2) interest rates and the crypto index have exhibited an inverse relationship 63% of the time since May 2017. This increases to 75% from May 2020, following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The inverse relationship is generally in line with how we would expect traditional assets to behave.\n\nChart 2\n\nSome argue that crypto assets could be in demand in a high interest rates/high inflation environment because they could serve as a store of value. We think the track record for crypto is too short to prove this. We study the relationship between crypto assets and inflation in section three of this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB. Do quantitative easing and tightening make a difference in cryptocurrency markets?\n\nWhen interest rates hit the zero bound after the Great Recession, and economic growth remained sluggish, central banks sought additional tools to stimulate activity. One was Quantitative Easing, in which central banks purchase mostly government-issued fixed income securities, typically of relatively long maturities. This let central banks further ease financial conditions and reduce long-term financing costs by lowering term premia in government bonds.\n\nIn the US, three QE rounds took place in 2009-2014, leading up to the Taper Tantrum of May 2014 when bond yields surged after Fed officials announced plans to reduce the pace of Treasury bond purchases. Then in 2018, the Fed started reducing its balance sheet by lowering the amount reinvested from maturing securities through Quantitative Tightening. A new emergency QE program was introduced in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, before the resumption of QT in 2022. The Fed\u2019s balance sheet peaked at nearly $9 trillion in early 2022 and has since gradually fallen to roughly $8.7 trillion.\n\nQE fueled appetite for higher-risk assets (in search of higher yield). Arguably, increased global liquidity/money supply, in an environment of favorable market conditions, should also have a positive impact on the crypto market, all else held equal. Unprecedented levels of monetary easing by central banks across the world since 2008/09 have increased money supply to record levels. Chart 3 below shows the total assets on the Fed\u2019s balance sheet and the price of Bitcoin since 2016. The markers highlight the fourth round of QE, which began in 2020, and the two periods of QT.\n\nChart 3\n\nAfter a Bitcoin rally in 2017, a significant price slump in 2018 coincided with the Fed\u2019s balance sheet reduction program. There was another bull run in 2020, in which Bitcoin appreciated 1,000%. It coincided with a QE program that started during COVID-19 in 2020 and with increased institutional interest in cryptocurrency markets.\n\nBitcoin reached a peak in November 2021 before entering a \u2018crypto winter\u2019 in which it lost more than two-thirds of its value over six months as market appetite for risky assets decreased. This downturn took place during a tightening monetary policy that started in June 2022. It was also coupled with crypto-specific events that followed the decreasing price trend, such as the collapse of stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) in May 2022 and of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November 2022.\n\nChart 4 shows year-over-year changes for Bitcoin and the Fed\u2019s balance sheet since 2017. Some periods of balance sheet reduction and tightening measures, captured by negative changes, are associated with bearish periods for Bitcoin. The 2020 expansionary period is followed by a glaring crypto rally.\n\nChart 4\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rally in 2020 coincided with a QE program that started during COVID-19 and with increased institutional interest in cryptocurrency markets.\n\nOne can also look at QE and QT through the lens of the bond markets and study the relationship between bond premia and crypto prices. Term premia fell into negative territory during the 2020-2021 rally as another round of QE was implemented. This spurred investors\u2019 interest in higher-yielding assets and high-return speculative investments like crypto. Chart 5 plots S&P BDMI and the 10-year Zero Coupon Treasury Term Premia.\n\nBond yields and premia are not always consistently impacted by QE and QT. For example, during the QT period in 2018-2019, the 10-year Zero Coupon Treasury Term Premia was initially positive and then turned negative. It has oscillated between negative and positive during QT since June 2022.\n\nChart 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC. Is global money supply important for the crypto ecosystem?\n\nTo assess the impact of global liquidity on crypto markets, we start by looking at M2 (a measure of money supply). M2 has surged since the Great Recession as central banks lowered interest rates and implemented QE. Chart 6 shows the relationship between M2 and S&P BDMI. M2 is the US Federal Reserve\u2019s estimate of total money supply including all of the cash people have on hand plus money deposited in checking accounts, savings accounts, and other short-term saving vehicles. Since the 1980\u2019s, M2 has exhibited exponential growth, particularly due to expansionary monetary policies during recessionary periods. In July 2022, M2 declined as the US reversed loose monetary policies.\n\nCorrelation between money supply and the crypto index is 0.75 over the historical period starting in 2017. This positive relationship notably broke down during 2018, as S&P BDMI fell, while M2 kept growing until July 2022. S&P BDMI\u2019s decIine followed a crypto boom in 2017, when the market was flooded with initial coin offerings and new ventures, many of which ultimately failed. Both measures moved in the same direction in the second half of 2022. M2 contracted while the crypto market was hit by a series of events that fueled volatility and price declines, including the collapse of stablecoin UST in May and the downfall of cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November.\n\nChart 6\n\nChart 7 shows rolling three-month percent changes for M2 and S&P BDMI. Since 2017, changes for M2 have been generally positive, with a pronounced peak at the beginning of the pandemic, while the crypto index has exhibited several periods of negative returns. In the second half of 2022, both indices exhibited negative returns.\n\nIn general, crypto markets have performed well in periods of expansionary monetary policies, although we are not able to establish a causal relationship. Some of the large swings in crypto currencies have taken place following factors that are not directly related to monetary policy, such as the FTX collapse.\n\nChart 7\n\n2. Does the perception of a possible incoming recession matter for crypto?\n\nGrowing recessionary risk could weigh on crypto assets if economic concerns dent appetite for higher-risk assets. At the same time, a recession perceived to be driven by poor government policies could arguably boost demand for crypto because the assets\u2019 decentralized and borderless nature creates a potential shelter.\n\nTo understand whether recession risks weigh on crypto assets, we can use a widely followed gauge of economic expectations \u2013 the slope of the US Treasury yield curve. In particular, the difference between the yields on the 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity and the 3-month Treasury Constant Maturity, which has historically been a better signal of an incoming recession than other tenors. The yield on the 10-year Treasury is usually higher than that on the 3-month T-bill, giving the curve a positive slope. When this relationship inverts, it suggests that interest rates will fall in the future due to an economic slowdown. In the past, recessions have generally occurred whenever there was a sustained yield curve inversion. A notable exception is the current inversion that started in October 2022.\n\nThe yield curve has inverted three times since the 2008 recession. The first took place from March 2019 to October 2019, as above-target inflation prompted the Fed to increase interest rates, increasing expectations that the economy would fall into a recession. However, resiliency in the labor market prevented a recession during that period. The second inversion, at the beginning of the pandemic in February 2020, did not last long because of strong monetary and fiscal policies designed to mitigate the economic shock of COVID-19 restrictions. The yield curve inverted again in October 2022, as noted in the previous paragraph, and it remains in that state as of May 2023.\n\nChart 8 shows S&P BDMI and the difference between the 10-year and 3-month yields. When this difference is negative, the yield curve is inverted. The data is too short to find a consistent association between yield curve inversions and price declines for crypto.\n\nChart 8\n\nChart 9 below shows a more detailed view since late October 2022. Notably, S&P BDMI has more than recovered since losing 25% of its value in November 2022, even with the yield curve remaining negative. Some of the crypto volatility was linked to the implosion of digital-asset exchange FTX and its domino effect in the crypto lending space, as well as general uneasiness about crypto risks and governance.\n\nChart 9\n\nIf a recession is caused by inflation, or poor government policies, investors may look at crypto assets as a safe haven because they are decentralized, not tied to any country or government, and at least partially driven by factors such as technology and market sentiment. In countries where national currencies are unstable, the crypto market offers an alternative for preserving purchasing power. A handful of countries have adopted crypto as legal tender.\n\nFiat currencies in emerging markets can exhibit large and recurring depreciations, or be characterized by limits on convertibility to hard currency. By contrast, crypto assets have the potential to weather economic shocks and remain a unit of account and medium of exchange. This perception may have helped to fuel adoption of cryptocurrencies in developing nations. Crypto gained popularity as a means of remittance payments and for sending money across borders. It is now seen by many as an enticing investment opportunity as well, which has encouraged the launch of several asset management products that include crypto assets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Can Crypto assets be a hedge for inflation?\n\nIn countries with unstable currencies, crypto assets potentially offer an alternative for preserving purchasing power.\n\nDuring their limited life, crypto assets have had bull and bear periods that are not directly tied to macroeconomic inflationary shocks. This helps to explain why adding crypto to a traditional portfolio increases returns, at the cost of also raising volatility. We also observe that retail investors in emerging markets with weak currencies and hyperinflation have turned to crypto assets to protect their wealth.\n\nInflation is generally associated with an overheated economy after expansionary monetary and fiscal policies have increased aggregate demand. In some cases, it is also the result of negative supply shocks. Fiscal policies that increase disposable incomes above sustainable levels raise consumption, leading to demand-driven inflation. They also boost investment, including in assets that generate higher returns, such as crypto.\n\nA frequently asked question is whether crypto assets can be a good hedge for inflation. Bitcoin and other crypto assets should be less correlated to instabilities in a financial system due to their decentralized nature. High fungibility also makes crypto a potentially strong candidate to store value in unfavorable economic conditions. Still, this is a complex topic, and the data may be too short to confidently address it.\n\nWe analyzed the relationship between inflation and the crypto ecosystem over the past six years \u2013 a period featuring a transition from low inflation pre-pandemic to markedly high rates. We also used the relationship between inflation and gold (a traditional inflation hedge) since 1982 as a comparison. If crypto follows the path of \u201cdigital gold\u201d, returns should be positively related to changes in US inflation expectations.\n\nFor average US inflation expectations, we use 2-year and 10-year breakeven inflation rates, derived from the relevant Treasury Constant Maturity Securities and Treasury Inflation-Indexed Constant Maturity Securities. The rates measure inflation expectations in the short and longer term. We use US inflation expectation as crypto tends to be priced in dollars and the market for financial instruments linked to inflation is liquid and well established. In countries with unstable currencies, crypto assets potentially offer an alternative for preserving purchasing power.\n\nChart 10 below shows S&P BDMI and breakeven inflation expectations. The 2-year breakeven inflation rate dipped into negative territory during the pandemic when the yield on Treasury Inflation-Protection Securities (TIPS) exceeded the yield on Treasuries.\n\nChart 10\n\nThe historical correlation between the daily returns of S&P BDMI and the inflation expectation indices is low, around 0.10.\n\nLooking at rolling three-month returns for S&P BDMI and 10-year breakeven inflation expectations in chart 11 shows no conclusive pattern. There is a notable number of periods where returns on crypto and inflation indices exhibit opposite signs, meaning an increase in inflation expectations is not associated with an increase in cryptocurrency prices. However, there are also periods where the two measures are both positive or both negative.\n\nChart 11\n\nOverall, the data to date does not support a conclusive answer on crypto assets\u2019 hedging capabilities with respect to inflation. By contrast, Chart 12 below shows that gold prices and the 10-year Breakeven Inflation Expectation index have tracked each other quite well since 2003. Additionally, there is evidence of Granger causality between the 10-year Breakeven Inflation Expectation index and the S&P GSCI Gold index at a 95% confidence level. The same test fails for Bitcoin. (Granger causality is a statistical test to verify whether one variable is useful in forecasting another.)\n\nChart 12\n\nIn developing economies, there are cases in which crypto assets have been used as an alternative to holding the domestic currency amid very high levels of inflation, rapid currency depreciation, or stringent capital controls. This could underpin reports that emerging markets rank among the top countries for cryptocurrency trading (according to Chainanalysis data for instance) . Still, in some countries, cryptocurrencies may also be used to bypass financial sanctions, which complicates the study of crypto as a counter-inflationary asset.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that supply matters in crypto markets, even if this isn\u2019t directly analogous to inflation. New coins are minted with proof-of-work mining or proof-ofstake validation. Supply of Bitcoin increases because miners get newly minted coins in return for their work. These rewards continually decrease and they will eventually end in about 2140. Ether, on the other hand, has recently had brief periods of burning more than minting. This will likely continue going forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. What does a strong or weak dollar mean for crypto markets?\n\nWe measure dollar strength, using the Nominal Broad US Dollar Index, which tracks the currency against a weighted basket of currencies used by US trade partners. Investors should favor other currencies when the dollar is expected to weaken (an index decline) and demonstrate the opposite amid dollar strength (a rising index). Arguably, the same logic should apply to crypto assets, which would lead to a negative relationship between crypto prices and the US Dollar Index.\n\nChart 13\n\nChart 13 shows the Nominal Broad US Dollar Index and S&P BDMI. The historical correlation between their daily returns is \u20130.16. That compares with a \u20130.40 correlation between the US Dollar Index and S&P GSCI Gold. In chart 14, a rolling three-month correlation analysis shows an inverse relationship (negative correlation) between the US Dollar Index and both S&P BDMI and S&P GSCI Gold 75% of the time.\n\nIdiosyncratic events may derail the expected relationship between crypto and the US Dollar Index over short time periods. Furthermore, because correlation does not substitute for causation, it is not obvious that a change in the US Dollar Index can provide insight into future movements in the crypto markets. In fact, there is no Granger causality between the US Dollar Index and Bitcoin prices.\n\nChart 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Do financial stress and market volatility spill over into crypto markets?\n\nIncreased financial stress and market volatility are generally associated with declining crypto prices. We use the Financial Stress Index (FSI) to measure stress in global financial markets. The index incorporates five categories of indicators: credit, equity valuation, funding, safe assets and volatility. The index is positive when stress levels are above average, and negative when stress levels are below average. Chart 15 plots the FSI index and S&P BDMI.\n\nFSI turned positive in early March 2020, around the day when WHO declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic. The shock was felt in crypto markets, with Bitcoin losing more than 40% of its value that day. Many other cryptos also plunged, along with stocks. Bitcoin then subsequently started a bull run, along with other assets, which continued until late 2021. FSI turned negative in June 2020. The FSI turned positive towards the middle of 2022, as the aftermath of the Russia-Ukraine conflict increased prices of several commodities, putting upward pressure on inflation, and consequently raising interest rate hike expectations.\n\nChart 15\n\nFSI turned positive most recently in mid-March 2023, though to a lesser extent than in 2022 or 2020. The failure of a few US banks added significant pressure to the banking system. These upheavals caused two major stablecoins (USDC and DAI) to depeg by 13%. Circle, the issuer of USDC, confirmed that $3.3 billion of cash reserves backing USDC were held at one of the failed banks. Both stablecoins recovered to their peg levels after the government confirmed that it would support the banks\u2019 creditors. These events highlight contagion risks from traditional finance to decentralized financial systems. Interestingly, Bitcoin rallied after the event, leading to speculation as to whether this was a response to the banking crisis, to the government intervention or to something else.\n\nWe also looked at another widely used metric for market volatility \u2013 The Chicago Board Options Exchange\u2019s (CBOE) Volatility Index (VIX). Also known as the market fear index, the VIX measures expectations of near-term volatility conveyed by S&P 500 index option prices.\n\nHigher levels for the VIX indicate expectations for increased volatility. That adds pressure and fear to financial markets, drives liquidity premiums upward and reduces investors\u2019 confidence. In such a market, it is expected that cryptocurrencies will exhibit more volatility.\n\nIn addition to VIX, we looked at the CBOE Crude Oil ETF Volatility Index (OVX), which measures the short-term volatility of crude oil as priced by the United States Oil Fund. We chose to analyze this index because considerable energy requirements mean that there may be a relationship between energy prices and Bitcoin miners. Chart 16 shows the VIX and OVX indices and S&P BDMI. The volatility indices both show sudden spikes in Spring 2020 during the COVID-19 period.\n\nChart 16\n\nCrypto prices have an inverse relationship with the VIX and OVX indices \u2013 prices fall when the fear indices go up. S&P BDMI\u2019s historical return correlation is \u20130.20 with VIX and \u20130.11 with OVX. Rolling three-month correlation is negative 90% of the time, reaching \u20130.60 in the past year. Interestingly, considering that both indices pertain to different asset classes, we found a Granger causality relationship between VIX and S&P BDMI.\n\nThe interconnectedness between traditional and decentralized finance is of particular importance because a healthy banking system is the backbone of a healthy economy. For example, in the US, the collapse of a few banks in March 2023 caused liquidity pressure in the banking industry. This in turn depegged some stablecoins, which are supposed to provide a stable bridge between the fiat and crypto ecosystems. There is no indication of how the wider crypto ecosystem would have reacted if the crisis hadn\u2019t been contained. At the same time, crypto-friendly banks are exposed to crypto instability and have no control over market trends. That means the banking industry may be directly affected by uncertainties stemming from the crypto ecosystem.\n\nChart 17\n\nAs more institutional investors turn to crypto, contagion risk between traditional and crypto assets may rise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nCrypto assets are not exempt from the effect of macroeconomic changes, even if performance is also powered by other drivers such as technology and market sentiment. The market\u2019s relationship with macroeconomic indicators may become stronger \u2013 and more in line with that of traditional financial assets \u2013 as more institutional investors turn to crypto. If that happens, contagion risk between traditional and crypto assets may rise, potentially flowing in both directions.

        "content": "Citing excessive energy use, noisy operations, pollution and electronic waste, Buncombe County put a one-year moratorium on any new cryptocurrency mining operations.\n\nThe vote in Asheville follows a ban on the server farms approved last year in Clay County, in the mountains southwest of Asheville. Neighboring Macon County is also considering a ban on the mining operations.\n\n\n\nWhat You Need To Know More western North Carolina counties are considering how to regulate or restrict new cryptocurrency mines\n\n\n\n\n\nThe operations use server farms to run complicated computer algorithms to \"mine\" for digital currencies, like Bitcoin\n\n\n\n\n\nOpponents say the server farms are noisy and waste electricity\n\n\n\n\n\nBuncombe County just voted for a one-year moratorium on crypto farms. Clay County passed a resolution banning the farms and Mason County is considering a similar ordinance\n\n\n\nIn December, Cherokee County passed a resolution asking the legislature for more power to regulate cryptocurrency mines.\n\nCryptocurrency mines use server farms to run complicated algorithms to \u201cmine\u201d Bitcoin and similar digital currencies. They use warehouses full of powerful computers that require a lot of electricity. The operations have brought complaints from nearby residents over the 24-hour noise from the servers and cooling equipment in previously quiet rural areas in the North Carolina mountains.\n\nThe server farms are attracted to western North Carolina by low-cost energy and lax zoning regulations, according to a recent report from the Environmental Working Group.\n\nCryptocurrency miners have also been looking for new places to set up shop since China banned most of their operations two years ago, according to the Associated Press.\n\nBuncombe County Planning Director Nathan Pennington said the county is working on a new comprehensive plan.\n\n\u201cThis one-year pause gives us time to work with residents and craft standards,\u201d he said.\n\nThe commission passed the moratorium unanimously last week.\n\n\u201cThe moratorium will maintain the status quo by limiting any negative effects in neighborhoods impacted by this use until a proper regulatory scheme can be developed,\u201d the ordinance states.\n\nThe ban would expire after a year or when the county comes up with new rules for where the server farms can be located. It only includes unincorporated areas of Buncombe County.\n\n\u201cThey have proven to be a nuisance to neighbors and a threat to our environment,\u201d Chris Joyell, with the environmental group Mountain True, said during a public hearing over the temporary ban in Buncombe County.\n\n\u201cThere is no way to greenwash crypto mining. Even if miners claim to rely on renewable energy, their operations are still hogging energy that we would need to meet the county and state carbon reduction goals,\u201d he said.\n\nBut not everyone at the hearing supported the moratorium. Craig Deutsch told the commissions the moratorium could discourage new industry in the county.\n\nThe crypto mining operations, he said, could \u201cencourage innovation and bring new industry to the area.\u201d\n\nNoise problems should already be addressed by noise ordinances, said Dennis Fassuliotis, director of the South Carolina Emerging Tech Association, speaking during the public hearing.\n\nHe also countered the environmental arguments against the server farms.\n\n\u201cBitcoin mining specifically does not produce any greenhouse gasses itself. It uses a mixture of the grid that everyone else uses,\u201d Fassuliotis told the commission. \u201cBitcoin is the industry leader in sustainability.\u201d\n\nNew York lawmakers last year passed a 2-year ban on new cryptocurrency mines that wanted to retrofit old fossil-fuel power plants to power their servers.\n\n"

        "content": "The culprit is, ironically, Bitcoin\u2019s own Taproot upgrade, which (perhaps unintentionally) opened up a new design space which permitted users to inscribe arbitrary content on the blockchain. Image NFTs (\u201cOrdinals\u201d) have stolen most of the attention, but the immediate catalyst for this spike was actually the creation of the BRC-20 standard, which relies on an exotic distribution method. BRC-20s are issued with a \u201cproof of burned fee\u201d mechanic, in which users must sacrifice transaction fees in order to create new tokens. This has driven fees in the short term to eye-watering levels, pricing out other sorts of conventional usage. Some Bitcoiners have even taken to calling the usage of the blockchain a deliberate \u201cdenial of service\u201d attack or an attack on El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin mission."

        "title": "A Philosophical Case for Bitcoin with Bradley Rettler - What Bitcoin Did",
        "content": "Bradley Rettler is an Associate Professor of Philosophy, and a member of the Resistance Money, a philosophy research collective focused on Bitcoin. In this interview, we discuss the potential ethical implications of AI, philosophical reflections on money creation and governance, the importance of financial literacy, and combating misinformation about Bitcoin.\n\n- - - -\n\nOver the past few years, one of the important groups to emerge within the Bitcoin community has been the philosophers studying Bitcoin, led by members of the Resistance Money collective: Andrew Bailey, Bradley Rettle and Craig Warmke (with Troy Cross as an honorary member). They have added academic weight to the consideration of the importance of Bitcoin in the context of fundamental questions regarding money\u2019s role in society.\n\nThe Resistance Money collective has been examining Bitcoin from various angles. In the episode, Bradley discusses moral dilemmas posed by a material global transition to this new form of money: the transfer of wealth, energy consumption impacts, the acceptance of privacy for bad and good, and usage by enemies. In addition, considerations about the benefits provided by fiat currency that could be lost: e.g. is there a useful societal function provided by money printing?\n\nBut this is where philosophical tools are extremely useful. In a previous episode, Craig Warmke explained the usefulness of the \u2018veil of ignorance\u2019 thought experiment, where one assumes they have no knowledge of what position in society they would have, and, from this position, they then determine what monetary system would best serve society for the great good. It is this perspective that is used to establish the Resistence Money thesis on Bitcoin.\n\nIn a scenario where you could fall into any position in society, it would obviously be better that Bitcoin existed. It is the philosophical equivalent of checking your privilege. Whilst Bitcoin\u2019s potential impact on society is complex and uneven, it is far easier to understand how Bitcoin acts to mitigate global inequality and inequity when assuming a scenario where you need it, and it doesn\u2019t exist."

        "content": "Bitcoin slipped below US$28,000 on Tuesday morning in Asia as the rise of the Ordinal protocol and Bitcoin-based memecoins drove up transaction fees and caused network congestion. Ether and all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also fell back, with Litecoin leading the losers. U.S. equity futures traded flat to lower after Wall Street closed mixed on Monday ahead of the latest inflation reading for the economy on Wednesday.\n\nSee related article: Largest banks should fill void left in crypto following collapses, says Standard Chartered\u2019s Geoff Kendrick\n\nTop 10 crypto lose steam\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nBitcoin dropped 3.48% to US$27,594 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. The token has fallen 1.76% over the past seven days.\n\nBinance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, halted Bitcoin withdrawals twice within 12 hours on Sunday and Monday, citing congestion and higher transaction fees. The average transaction fee on the Bitcoin blockchain surged to US$19.21 on Sunday, almost seven times higher than the start of the month, according to data from financial information platform YCharts.\n\nThe jump in transactions is attributed to the Ordinal protocol introduced in January that allows users to mint memecoins and digital collectibles on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nEther fell 2.04% to US$1,843 but held a weekly gain of 0.50%. The second largest cryptocurrency reached a low of US$1,818 earlier on Tuesday, but managed to hold the US$1,800 resistance level.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded lower for the past 24 hours, with Litecoin leading the losers, which fell 8.08% to US$77.65 and logged a weekly loss of 10.59%.\n\nPepe and Floki, two memecoins that surged after being listed on Binance last week, slid 32.88% and 12.36% in the past 24 hours.\n\nAdding to the pessimism, Seattle-based crypto exchange Bittrex Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Monday. The company closed the U.S. business on April 30 and faces charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission for alleged securities law violations. The company has rejected the charges. Bittrex Global will continue to service customers outside the U.S., the company said on Tuesday.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dropped 3.26% in the past 24 hours to US$1.14 trillion. The total trading volume jumped 56.84% to US$45.38 billion.\n\nNFT trades fall amid memecoin hype\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index fell 2.11% to 3,371.82 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, losing 7.27% for the week.\n\nDeGods, previously the largest Solana-based NFT collection by all-time sales that migrated to the Ethereum blockchain in April 2023, saw its sales in the past 24 hours surge over 400% to US$1.19 million, surpassing that of Azuki and Bored Ape Yacht Club.\n\nSales on the Ethereum blockchain dipped 3.75% to US$15.42 million, with the average transaction fee on the Ethereum blockchain reaching US$21.40 on May 8, the highest in 11 months, according to data from blockchain intelligence platform BitInfoCharts.\n\n\u201cEthereum network is heavily congested. Gas fees are through the roof due to the memecoin season,\u201d said Brian Boisjoli, Product Manager at Forkast Labs, who noted that with almost 200,000 pending ethereum transactions, it would take around 4 hours to complete a transaction on the network.\n\nU.S. equity futures flat before CPI\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures edged lower as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures lost 0.09%. The S&P 500 futures dipped 0.10%. And the Nasdaq Composite futures dipped 0.17%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve highlighted turmoil in the banking system as a threat to the economy in its financial stability report on Monday, saying \u201cconcerns about the economic outlook, credit quality, and funding liquidity could lead banks and other financial institutions to further contract the supply of credit to the economy.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. April consumer price index report is released Wednesday, with economists expecting the inflation rate to rise 5% on year and 0.4% by month, according to CNBC on Monday citing projections by Dow Jones.\n\nThe Fed next meets on June 14 to decide on interest rates. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts an 85.7% chance the Fed will keep rates unchanged at 5% to 5.25%, while it gives a 14.3% chance for another 25 basis-point rate hike, up from 9.6% on Monday.\n\nSee related article: India not against blockchain tech, but cryptocurrency should be monitored, says FM"

        "title": "$3.4B of Bitcoin in a popcorn tin: The Silk Road hacker's story - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Where would you hide $3.4 billion worth of Bitcoin? For James Zhong, the ideal spot was to store it on a computer \u2014 with its circuitry exposed \u2014 placed in a used Cheetos popcorn tin hidden in a bathroom closet under a pile of blankets.\n\nZhong, now 32, was sentenced to a year in federal prison last month for a hack that took place almost 11 years ago. His victim? Ross Ulbricht, the proprietor of the Silk Road dark web drug marketplace where Bitcoin found its first significant use case, as an underground currency. Today, Ulbricht is himself serving two life sentences plus 40 years for his part in operating the illegal marketplace, but darknet markets continue to flourish.\n\nSomewhat ironically, billionaire Zhong was caught due to a transfer of just $1,000 worth of BTC to an address he\u2019d used previously.\n\nProsecutors stated that Zhong spent lavishly on luxuries. (Zhong\u2019s social media)\n\n\n\nLifestyle of a crypto billionaire\n\nHow much is $3.4 billion? One could build another Burj Khalifa \u2014 the world\u2019s tallest tower, located in Dubai ($1.5 billion) \u2014 and make the winning bid on Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \u201cSalvator Mundi\u201d \u2014 the most expensive painting ever sold ($450 million) \u2014 and still have over a billion left over to purchase a sports team, yacht and fleet of private jets. It\u2019s almost beyond comprehension.\n\nThe computer containing most of Zhong\u2019s Bitcoin, found in a popcorn tin. (United States Department of Justice)\n\nBut Zhong lived in the American city of Gainesville, Georgia, where around $1 million is enough to purchase the luxurious four-bedroom lakefront property he called home. According to some sources, gaining attention from women was among the key motivations of Zhong \u2014 who is autistic and was reportedly bullied in school. Court documents hint at his lavish lifestyle:\n\n\u201cIndeed, in the 51 months before law enforcement\u2019s overt search of Zhong\u2019s residences, Zhong dissipated approximately $16 million of crime proceeds, spending lavishly on real estate investments, luxury products, travel, hotels, nightclubs, and other expenses.\u201d\n\nIf his online posts are anything to go by, Zhong can also be said to have been something of a party animal, using cocaine on weekends and bragging about being drunk while keeping an eye on the markets. Perhaps this comes with the territory of stealing billions from a drug kingpin.\n\nZhong memed about his party habits on the Bitcointalk forum.\n\nAll this was presumably financed with the roughly 2,900 BTC that the government did not recover from his theft. Zhong stole 50,000 BTC and converted his free Bitcoin Cash into another 3,500 BTC. However, only 50,591 BTC was seized.\n\nSilk Road\n\nWhere did all this begin? Possibly with a Bitcointalk user named Teppy, who in June 2010 made a post titled \u201cA Heroin Store\u201d outlining \u201ca thought experiment about how a heroin store might operate, accepting Bitcoins, and ending drug prohibition in the process.\u201d The post connected Bitcoin to libertarianism and suggested that this would enable the new currency to become \u201ctruly disruptive.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt was a cutting-edge concept. \u201cPizza Day,\u201d which saw Bitcoin exchanged for real-world goods for the first time \u2014 a pair of pizzas for 10,000 BTC \u2014 had happened just three weeks prior.\n\nEight months later, in February 2011, Silk Road opened for business in the hidden back alleys of the web. \u201cTo access the Tor dark web, users need to download special software,\u201d explains Ethan Lou, an occasional Magazine contributor and the author of Once a Bitcoin Miner. He speaks from experience. Tor, he notes, has many legitimate uses for those who value privacy, including leaking information to the press.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty easy if you have some basic tech know-how. Once you get in, you see that it looks like the internet from the 1990s.\u201d\n\nSellers could list their items for sale on Silk Road, and the website would hold funds in escrow until items were received by the buyer, who could rate the item and seller. Often, administrators would adjudicate disputes. In months, the site grew to host over 10,000 listings of controlled substances, eventually processing around 1.5 million transactions. One early user was podcaster Peter McCormack, who called it \u201cAmazon for drugs\u201d and told Magazine how he wound up in hospital after three grams of cocaine arrived one day and he got carried away \u2014 literally, in an ambulance.\n\nAuthorities close in\n\nBy June, U.S. Senators Chuck Schumer and Joe Manchin had written to the attorney general and the Drug Enforcement Agency, demanding they take action against the marketplace.\n\nSome of those actions were off-the-books, such as those by DEA Special Agent Carl Mark Force IV, the \u201clead undercover agent\u201d who in 2015 was sentenced to 6.5 years for various crimes connected with the case. This included demanding exchanges freeze BTC accounts in order to withdraw the coins for himself as well as faking the death of site administrator Curtis Green, whom he had actually arrested, in order to collect money from DPR, who allegedly wanted him dead.\n\nZhong had autism, and prosecutors said he spent lavishly. (Social media)\n\nThe website came to an end on Oct. 1, 2013, when a couple started bickering in San Fransisco\u2019s Glen Park Library. This caught the attention of the nearby Ulbricht, who turned his head from the laptop he was working on. It was a trap. At that moment, FBI agents swooped in from behind bookshelves and grabbed Ulbricht\u2019s laptop before he could log out and lock away his 144,000 BTC \u2014 the proof he was DPR.\n\nUlbricht received a double life sentence plus 40 years with no possibility of parole. Many in the Bitcoin community and beyond have criticized the sentence as unjust, particularly considering the nonviolent nature of his crime. FreeRoss, an organization dedicated to advocating for his release, archives statements by politicians and industry leaders speaking in favor of his release. As Lou asks:\n\n\u201cAre two life sentences reasonable for someone who did something that is nonviolent?\u201d\n\nI was arrested at the age of 29 and today I turn 39. I\u2019ve lost my 30s to prison.\n\n\n\nDuring that time, I\u2019ve done my best to learn from my mistakes, better myself, and help others do the same.\n\n\n\nI hope someday I can make amends as a free man as well. \u2014 Ross Ulbricht (@RealRossU) March 27, 2023\n\nA pirate\u2019s billions\n\nDuring Ulbricht\u2019s sentencing, the funds earned by the site were declared proceeds of crime, meaning the Bitcoin was confiscatable by the U.S. government. The approximately 144,000 BTC found on Ulbricht\u2019s laptop was now U.S. property.\n\n\u201cUnder U.S. law, authorities can effectively bring a case against money or other goods and seize them under civil forfeiture laws without necessarily arresting the person possessing them. This naturally extends to digital currencies like Bitcoin,\u201d explains Jason Corbett, a lawyer whose firm, Silk Legal, specializes in cryptocurrencies.\n\nCheetos, really? Where else would you keep billions in Bitcoin? (United States Department of Justice)\n\nThe government disposed of its newfound Bitcoin via a series of auctions held by the U.S. Marshals Service in 2014. Venture capitalist Tim Draper famously purchased 30,000 BTC for $18 million. Functionally, the auctions legitimized Bitcoin by removing all doubt regarding its legality: How could the government sell something it considers illegal?\n\nBut some of the Bitcoin was missing, all traceable from the Silk Road addresses. About 50,000 had been stolen from Silk Road\u2019s hot wallets back in September 2012.\n\nIt was not a sophisticated hack. Zhong deposited 500 BTC into the Silk Road platform, only to make five withdrawals for 500 BTC a few seconds later, tricking the wallet software into returning 2,500 BTC to him. This was repeated several times using different accounts and increasing amounts, netting Zhong \u201capproximately 50,000 Bitcoin out of Silk Road in just a few days,\u201d according to court documents. At the time, this amount of Bitcoin was worth around $600,000.\n\nUnexpected Bitcoin Cash windfall\n\nIn 2017, Bitcoin was forked in a move championed by Roger Ver and Jihan Wu. This allowed every Bitcoin holder to redeem 1 BCH for each Bitcoin they held.\n\nMany proponents believed that Bitcoin Cash was the \u201ctrue\u201d Bitcoin, but Zhong, writing as the aptly named \u201cLoaded,\u201d took to the Bitcointalk forum to disagree. That summer, he went on to exchange his 50,000 BCH for 3,500 additional BTC. As the U.S. government views the stolen Silk Road BTC as proceeds of crime, it similarly views the BCH later assigned to them as equally confiscatable.\n\nZhong, writing as the aptly named \u201cLoaded\u201d on the Bitcointalk forum.\n\nAs a decade passed, the value of Zhong\u2019s stolen treasure grew exponentially into the billions. However, with Zhong\u2019s blockchain signature pointing to the lost Silk Road coins, it was only a matter of time before U.S. investigators took notice. There were, and probably still are, eyes on the forum at the center of the Bitcoin movement, where Ulbricht himself had posted under the name \u201cAltoid.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the trail that eventually led Trevor McAleenan, a special agent with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service\u2019s Criminal Investigation Division, to rummage through the contents of Zhang\u2019s bathroom closets in 2022 in search of \u201capproximately 53,500 [BTC in] Silk Road Crime Proceeds.\u201d He recovered 50,591 BTC, which, \u201cusing a conservative estimate of the lowest spot price of BTC on the date of the search,\u201d amounted to $3,388,817,011.90.\n\nlolllllllllllllll yeah, well, he did that too. \ud83e\udd23 pic.twitter.com/W90vMwMaIR \u2014 Tay \ud83d\udc96 (@tayvano_) March 31, 2023\n\nNot a tin pot setup\n\nThough Zhong hid much of his BTC in a tin, Special Agent McAleenan described his setup as sophisticated, made up of \u201cmultiple computer servers, virtual private networks, cold wallets, virtual machines, numerous layers of encryption, and multiple Bitcoin nodes.\u201d Over the first several years following his 2012 heist, Zhong kept his loot on two addresses of approximately 40,000 BTC and 10,000 BTC.\n\nPerhaps in an attempt to make the connection to the hack appear more distant, he began periodically moving the Bitcoin \u2014 for example, splitting the 10,000 BTC address into 10 addresses holding 1,000 BTC each in 2020.\n\nThe lakefront home where Zhong kept his treasure. $3.4 billion could buy around 3,600 such houses. (Zillow)\n\n\n\nIn an apparent attempt to further obfuscate the funds, that same year he \u201cpushed approximately 750 BTC of the Silk Road Crime Proceeds through a decentralized Bitcoin mixer,\u201d which is software that effectively mixes cryptocurrency from various addresses together to make it unclear from which source a final balance comes, thereby aiming to break a connection to tracked coins such as those involved in Silk Road.\n\nWhile technically anyone can use a site like Blockchain.com to follow transactions \u2014 including Zhong\u2019s \u2014 on the Bitcoin chain, it is worth noting that the IRS went beyond this, using blockchain tracing and forensic software to string suspicious addresses together more easily. While such software does not add any new information, it makes interpreting the data easier.\n\nFeds swoop in\n\nDespite his VPNs and encryption and various attempts to hide the Silk Road coins, Zhong must have slipped up at some point, as the IRS was able to track him by his IP address \u2014 a unique identifier assigned to each device that connects to the internet. This IP address was then matched to records held with Zhong\u2019s internet service provider as well as an exchange where he sent some coins to be traded, presumably obtained by a warrant requiring these records to be released.\n\nZhong\u2019s floor safe. (United States Department of Justice)\n\nThe successful recovery of the Bitcoin came down to identifying the movements of the coins in question and following them to an exchange where Zhong had deposited and sold 119 BTC, worth somewhere in the region of $1 million, in 2019. Despite attempts to mix and obfuscate, the coins\u2019 connection to Zhong and Silk Road was confirmed by a transfer of a mere 0.07750842 BTC \u2014 around $1,000 \u2014 in leftover change that was sent from Zhong\u2019s account to a Bitcoin address previously used to move 1,000 BTC of Silk Road funds.\n\nThis suggests that Zhong was caught \u2014 losing him $3.4 billion \u2014 due to laziness in reusing an address instead of creating a new one, or perhaps even for worrying about 0.08 BTC when selling 118 BTC, to begin with. The Swan Bitcoin exchange, for example, explicitly discourages users from reusing addresses due to \u201cnegative implications such as diminished privacy and diminished security,\u201d which Zhong\u2019s case appears to demonstrate.\n\nAnd so, a search warrant was issued and executed about two years later, in November 2021.\n\n\u201cThe same BTC address controlled by Individual-1 that received change of approximately 0.07750842 BTC in 2019, as indicated in the Exchange records, also is associated with a BTC address that Individual-1 used to transfer 1,000 BTC that Individual-1 had unlawfully obtained from Silk Road,\u201d wrote McAleenan.\n\nZhong\u2019s other loot\n\nIn addition to coins held on a computer, Zhong had other assets spread around his house within a kitchen drawer and a floor safe filled with tightly bound stacks of cash. There was also a tiny amount of silver and gold bullion and a collection of rather peculiar coins known as Casascius coins.\n\nThe Casascius physical Bitcoin found in Zhong\u2019s kitchen drawer, making the U.S. government an accidental collector. (United States Department of Justice)\n\nCasascius coins are physical Bitcoin on which the private key is hidden under a peelable hologram sticker. They are historical artifacts of the Bitcoin movement dating back to 2011. Magazine\u2019s 2021 piece on the topic declared such coins as \u201cthe ultimate privacy coins, as there\u2019s nothing to associate the owner with an address and they can be traded a million times without ever leaving a record on the blockchain.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cTheoretically, of course, this would make physical Bitcoin a very attractive way to launder money or pay for drug deals.\u201d\n\nZhong appears to have done just that, effectively trading his red-hot \u201ccriminal proceeds\u201d for pre-Silk Road 2011 Bitcoin that appears entirely clean.\n\nAs far as we know, however, Zhong cooperated with authorities and returned all his remaining Bitcoin, a factor that played a role \u2014 along with his young age and autism \u2014 in his getting a short sentence and the more serious money laundering charges dropped, which would typically lead to many years in prison.\n\nIn Zhong\u2019s case, the government appeared far more interested in securing the \u201ccriminal proceeds\u201d for themselves rather than Zhong, whose criminal activity amounted to stealing from another criminal.\n\nHad Zhong hacked any other dodgy site, it\u2019s unlikely authorities would have been interested in catching up with him a decade after the fact. According to Corbett, wire fraud is the electronic equivalent of mail fraud and has become a sort of catch-all for prosecutors, as virtually any financial crime today involves the use of the internet.\n\n\u201cZhong was sentenced for wire fraud committed against Silk Road, which is a reminder that fraud is still fraud even if committed against a criminal enterprise.\u201d\n\nThe dark side\n\nDespite Ulbricht\u2019s sentencing, the Dread Pirate Roberts may live on. The name came from the movie The Princess Bride, in which DPR was not a single feared sea captain but a title passed on from pirate to pirate. True to the myth, Silk Road 2.0 was launched within a month of the arrest, operating for two years until Blake Benthall, a former administrator of the original Silk Road, was also arrested by the FBI. Despite this, at least two sites calling themselves Silk Road 3.0 were soon again operational, along with a myriad of similar marketplaces using different brands.\n\nIn Once a Bitcoin Miner, Lou writes about his experience visiting one of these marketplaces out of curiosity while a student. He soon spent almost half a Bitcoin \u2014 about $100 \u2014 to purchase a small amount of LSD, which never actually arrived. Naturally, there was far more than just drugs offered:\n\n\u201cVarious marketplaces offered stolen credit card details and passwords, drugs and guns. You could also hire someone to say the right words to the police so that a tactical team would raid a house of your choice, a process called \u2018swatting.\u2019 My friends and I even found purported assassinations on offer \u2013 just unbelievable.\u201d\n\nAccording to Carnegie Mellon research professor Nicolas Christin, as much as \u201c4.5% to 9% of all exchange trades\u201d in the early days of Bitcoin were related to the dark web drug market. Considering this, there is no denying that the black market was among the first use cases of cryptocurrency, a fact that still fuels apprehension among the public regarding cryptocurrency. Lou, a journalist, takes a slightly more optimistic view:\n\n\u201cEven if the use case is not a very nice one, I think it still is a use case. As they say, any publicity is good publicity.\u201d"

At the time, Twitter said that 130 accounts were targeted.\n\nThe hackers tweeted from those accounts falsely claiming that they would double all bitcoin sent to them in the next 30 minutes.

Twitter\n\nTwitter briefly stopped all verified accounts from tweeting as the company scrambled to oust the hackers.\n\n\"We detected what we believe to be a coordinated social engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools,\" it said.\n\nThe DOJ said O'Connor and his co-conspirators were also involved in several other schemes using SIM swaps, where hackers can remotely gain control of a victim's phone.\n\nThat included blackmailing one unnamed public figure with private Snapchat images; stealing $794,000 worth of crypto from a Manhattan-based company; and posting identifiable self-promotion videos on a high-profile TikTok account.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nO'Connor also cyberstalked and threatened a minor, including the use of swatting attacks. Swatting refers to the act of calling the police on an innocent person and falsely claiming criminal activity.\n\n\"O'Connor's criminal activities were flagrant and malicious, and his conduct impacted multiple people's lives. He harassed, threatened, and extorted his victims, causing substantial emotional harm,\" said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department's Criminal Division.\n\nO'Connor pleaded guilty to multiple counts of stalking, computer intrusion, extortion, money laundering, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. He is scheduled to be sentenced on June 23 and faces a maximum sentence of more than 70 years in prison."

Transactions of up to ~$745 ($999.99 CAD) can be made per transaction, with no KYC required. The exchange has a fee of 2% for no-KYC sats, the cheapest of any such service in Canada, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, while Bull Bitcoin's on-chain withdrawals remain free.\n\nCanadian regulations state that Bitcoin exchanges must perform KYC and keep transaction records for all purchases above $1,000 CAD. Bull Bitcoin states that its privacy policy complies with the fair information principles in the Personal Information Protection and Electronics Document Act (PIPEDA), which prevents it from collecting information that is not needed for a legitimate purpose.\n\nWith no risk of chargeback for cash and debit card transactions, the company states that it has no legitimate reason to ask for KYC.\n\nBull Bitcoin aims to offer cash bitcoin purchases due to customer demand, and for those without access to bank accounts. The company also aims to attract migrant workers for remittances and users who want to limit the amount of personal information they give to trusted third parties. In addition, cash and debit card transactions are not subject to fraudulent chargebacks, unlike bank transfers and e-transfers. The process of funding accounts with cash or debit cards is also faster and more convenient.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Quantifying bitcoin patterns with PCA - Coinbase",
        "content": "Summary Our principal component analysis (PCA) framework looks at mutually orthogonal, linear combinations of bitcoin-related factors across four-month periods between early 2022 and 2023. Bitcoin performance year-to-date has been highly sensitive to the first principal component (PC1) represented by our results, which we interpret as a measure of the token\u2019s endogenous supply and demand dynamics. Indeed, at the moment, PC1 is most positively associated with gold prices and average miner difficulty \u2013 a notable shift from the previous four months where PC1 was negatively associated with gold and most positively associated with US dollar movements. That prior inverse relationship may have been associated with the idiosyncratic deleveraging events that took place in the crypto space last year, while gold prices benefited from central bank demand. Consequently, the US regional banking turmoil in 1Q23 has helped realign gold and bitcoin as alternatives to the points of failure witnessed in the existing financial system. This has been evident in the rising correlation between the daily returns of these two assets. But what this means for bitcoin\u2019s performance in the next few months may not be clearcut. We see two key risks in the short-term \u2013 the credit situation in US regional banks and the impasse on the US debt ceiling. Although these issues should help reinforce bitcoin\u2019s \u201cstore of value\u201d fundamentals, we believe the high degree of uncertainty around potential outcomes complicates the outlook for digital assets and supports our preference for institutional investors to hedge their exposure via options.\n\nPCA: Data sensitivities We have seen a meaningful change in the common factors driving bitcoin performance in the short term, based on a principal component analysis (PCA) framework. Specifically, employing PCA provides an orthogonal representation of our standardized (mean-centered) dataset that includes US equities, gold, the (multilateral) US dollar index, bitcoin transaction volumes, bitcoin sentiment, average mining difficulty, miner fees, and bitcoin real volumes for the timespan between January and April 2023. Over this period, daily bitcoin returns had a high 75.0% sensitivity to the first principal component (PC1). This is a noticeable change from the previous four months (September to December 2022) when a linear regression between bitcoin returns and PC1 reflected an r-squared of 59.7%. During the four months prior to that (May to August 2022), the relationship between bitcoin and PC1 reflected an r-squared of only 26.6%. (Note that PC1 currently explains 35.7% of the variance in our data, while the proportion of variance explained goes up to 75.2% if we include the first three principal components. The explained variance ratios in the previous periods were comparable.) We partitioned the data into four-month increments not only for comparison purposes, but because the results suggest there were notable regime changes. A scatter plot of the first and second principal components compiled in 2022, for example (see chart 1), seems to show that the underlying structure of the data indicates three subgroupings of observations, divided by the periods January to April 2022, May to August 2022, and September to December 2022. Chart 1. PCA results for factors driving bitcoin performance If bitcoin prices are sensitive to changes in the combination of variables that make up the first principal component, what then is being captured by the first principal component? The loadings of the original variables on the first principal component suggests that between January and April 2023, it has been most strongly and positively associated with gold followed by bitcoin\u2019s average mining difficulty. Comparatively, the highest absolute values of loadings on PC1 \u2013 from May to August 2022 and September to December 2022 \u2013 indicate it was most strongly associated with US dollar movements and gold. But during these periods, it was negatively associated with gold and positively associated with the US dollar. That\u2019s an important shift. In our view, the first principal component\u2019s current association with gold and mining difficulty suggests PC1 is a measure of the impact of endogenous supply and demand dynamics on bitcoin prices. There may be several reasons for that. First, the inverse relationship between PC1 and gold between May and December 2022 may have had to do with the idiosyncratic deleveraging events taking place in the crypto space. These were concentrated in May , June , and November 2022. (Comparatively, gold was bid due to the unprecedented amount of central bank demand last year.) Those risk events may also explain why the second principal component (PC2) was most heavily (and positively) associated with bitcoin sentiment indicators like Tweet (Twitter) volumes during those 8 months in 2022. In contrast, between January and April 2023, PC2 was most highly and positively related to bitcoin transaction fees and volumes with an explained variance ratio of 25.7%. Second, we think the current strength and positive direction between PC1 and gold reflects an alignment of assets that exist as alternatives to the points of failure witnessed among US regional banks. The scarcity value that informs bitcoin\u2019s fundamental properties may also be evident in the relationship between PC1 and average mining difficulty, which is adjusted every 2016 blocks (around 2 weeks) based on the total computing power on the network. Rising difficulty levels this year have led to a decrease in the rate of new bitcoin supply entering the market, coupled with more bitcoin locked up in government and self-custody. This reinforces bitcoin\u2019s \u201cstore of value\u201d properties by constraining supply versus available demand. Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cstore of value\u201d properties may also be evident by looking at the correlation between daily gold and bitcoin prices. The positive relationship between these two variables has increased year-to-date, rising from a coefficient of 0.18 at the start of the year to 0.40 as of end-April based on a 40-day rolling window. See chart 2. Chart 2: Rolling correlation between daily bitcoin vs gold returns\n\nOutlook amid an uneasy background How this informs bitcoin\u2019s performance in the next few months may be trickier. We see two key sources of macroeconomic risk in the short-term: (1) the credit situation in US regional banks and (2) the standoff on the US debt ceiling. Regarding the former, it\u2019s difficult to assess the current situation with US regional banks and the potential risk of further contagion. After the failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank in March, First Republic Bank was sold to JP Morgan Chase on May 1 while PacWest Bancorp has said it is exploring strategic options. Many of these banks were sitting on big commercial and real estate lending portfolios, and it\u2019s not clear how making those part of the assets at larger banks will affect risk appetite. Regardless, we believe a credit crunch is already underway. Since early March, around US$416B has moved into money market funds, accelerating a trend that has been ongoing since 4Q22 and acting as a constraint on lending. Chart 3. Increasing constraints on bank lending Meanwhile, a prolonged stalemate on the US debt ceiling could create a disorderly situation for all assets. The US Treasury Department believes the \u201cX date\u201d to raise the debt limit is sometime in early June, and previous showdowns have come down to the final hours of the deadline. Complicating matters is that in the unlikely event of a default, it\u2019s possible the Federal Reserve could stop its quantitative tightening program and enact policies that increase liquidity in the market - potentially benefiting cryptocurrencies. In the case of a resolution, we also need to think about the impact that replenishing the Treasury General Account (TGA) balance could have on drawing liquidity from the market. Bitcoin\u2019s behavior after the collapse of SVB suggests it served its function well as a hedge against financial instability, so we think many market players see bullish short-term prospects for bitcoin in light of these two risks. As an analogue, gold rallied by 29% between early January 2011 and end-August 2011 during the 2011 US debt ceiling crisis, when ratings agency S&P downgraded US Treasury bonds from AAA to AA+. At that time, bitcoin was not as ubiquitous as it is today, so it\u2019s possible bitcoin could pick up some market share in the current standoff. On the other hand, gold weakened by 24% during the debt ceiling crisis in 2013, so there\u2019s no guarantee. It\u2019s also difficult to disentangle gold\u2019s 2013 performance from the Fed\u2019s tapering of quantitative easing around the same time. Ultimately, how digital assets perform amid the current backdrop is anyone\u2019s guess, as we expect countervailing factors may offset some of the positives. First, we have already seen a healthy amount of bitcoin appreciation post-SVB, absorbing the flows from a disenchanted depositor base. Second, we think that we could see more tactical rather than fundamental positioning into these event risks. Still, even if the extent of upside potential is unclear, we think the downside may be limited. Given the extent of the uncertainty, we believe bitcoin options may be the better way for institutional investors to hedge themselves as implied volatility levels have come down in recent weeks."

Rebel Mining was able to test, prep and install all miners in April.\" Said Patricia Trompeter, CEO of Sphere 3D. \"We were able to bring 3,900 of these miners online May 1st with the remainder planned for the weeks following.\"\n\nCompute North Update\n\nThere has not been a lot of movement in the Compute North bankruptcy. We continue to work with Compute North and their bankruptcy lawyers for the return of our deposit through the Chapter 11 process. As previously disclosed, we filed our financial claim with the US Bankruptcy Court in February 2023, and must wait for the process to continue.\n\nMiner Delivery Update\n\nWe deployed 4,400 miners to Rebel Mining's Missouri site for energization. Curently, 3,900 are hashing as of May 1 and the remaining 500 will be in the coming weeks. We expect to have additional hashrate coming online at Lancium's Texas location beginning in May and anticipate the majority of these to be hashing by mid-June. Finally, we expect to deploy the remaining fleet to an existing host in the next 60 days. With deployments above, we will have successfully placed the majority of our fleet.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/1705/165322_38bd147e44337bfb_002full.jpg\n\nCore Scientific Update\n\nAs previously disclosed by the Company, Sphere 3D filed an arbitration request against Core Scientific (\"Core\") on its claim for the non-refunded portion of the Company's advanced deposits. Core subsequently filed for restructuring under Chapter 11 on December 21, 2022, citing burdensome debt obligations as a result of rising energy prices and the decline in the price of bitcoin. In recent publicly filed documents, it appears that Core is closer to stabilizing their operations. We continue to work with our litigators and the US Bankruptcy court to monitor the progress. Sphere 3D has engaged counsel and is vigorously pursuing every available option to recover its funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nGryphon Update\n\nOn April 7, 2023, Sphere filed a suit against Gryphon Digital Mining, Inc (\"Gryphon\") in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Sphere alleges, among other things, that Gryphon materially breached its obligations to Sphere, both its contractual duties under a Master Services Agreemented dated August 19, 2021, and its fiduciary duties as a custodian of Sphere's assets. The litigation is at an early stage. Sphere intends to vigorously prosecute the action.\n\nBitcoin Production and Holdings Update\n\nIn April 2023, Sphere 3D produced 35.59 Bitcoin, or 1.15 per day. Sphere 3D's mining fleet operated at 80.9 BTC/EH efficiency.\n\nDuring April 2023, the Company employed a hybrid strategy of liquidating during bitcoin price upswings and HODL for the remainder of its holdings. The Company used approximately 41.3 Bitcoin during the month to fund working capital, and prepaid hosting deposits for our S19J Pros.\n\nBitcoin held by the Company represents a fair market value of approximately $0.5 million based on the Bitcoin price of $28,598 on April 30, 2023. As of April 30, 2023, the Company was operating approximately 4,330 S19j Pros miners delivering a production capacity of approximately 446 PH/s.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/1705/165322_38bd147e44337bfb_0003full.jpg\n\nOther\n\nWe have seen Bitcoin stabilize over the first quarter. We believe this trend will continue over the next quarter as investors choose to move their money into Bitcoin given the recent instability of the banking system.\n\nSphere 3D closed a capital raise with LDA Capital which will fund our deposits to bring the remaining 7,000+ miners online.\n\nOur CEO, Patricia Trompeter, spent a day on The Hill with fellow colleagues in the Bitcoin industry educating Congressional staff on issues facing the Bitcoin industry while dispelling myths on Bitcoin and energy consumption.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/1705/165322_38bd147e44337bfb_004full.jpg\n\nCEO Closing Remarks\n\n\"I am really excited about bringing the 4,400 miners online in the next couple weeks. We spent a significant amount of time in April deploying, testing and installing these miners. We will almost double our Peta Hash as of May 1st and continue to build our fleet in the weeks coming. April set us up for a transformative May! Thank you to my incredible team of warriors who made this happen!\"\n\nAbout Sphere 3D\n\nSphere 3D Corp.

        "title": "Memes Are Wreaking Havoc on Cryptocurrency Apparently - Robb Report",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency has had some tough times recently, from FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s criminal charges to the crash that has caused digital currency holders to rush toward investments that are more stable. Now they\u2019re facing a new challenge: memes.\n\nBinance, one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the world, recently suspended withdrawals after it experienced \u201ca congestion issue.\u201d New York Magazine\u2018s Kevin T. Dugan explains that the network that processes bitcoin transactions at one point had 400,000 stuck in a queue. Consequently, fees have increased to conduct transactions\u2014now up to $20, when last month it might have cost 87 cents. However, many of those people are simply trying to send memes.\n\nWhile the blockchain is primarily handling data that details transactions, users are now able to to write data into said transactions which might include photos or jokes, which is called \u201cinscribing.\u201d A recent upgrade to the network has made inscribing faster and cheaper, but the network is straining under the additional volume. That\u2019s because blockchain is now filled up with NFTs and meme coins. Two coins in particular\u2014one featuring alt-Right troll meme Pepe the Frog and the other based on SpongeBob SquarePants\u2014are having a huge speculative boom and their increased trading volume is gumming up the works.\n\n\u201cThere is an increasing demand for BRC-20 tokens which include transferring digital collectibles on bitcoin network,\u201d Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau told CNBC. \u201cThe bitcoin network has gradually supported more different types of tokens like NFTs. This adoption should be a positive sign longer term but it looks like it has slowed down the network.\u201d\n\nYet, in the short term, the congestion points to a major problem with the blockchain, which is its processing speed. Right now it can handle about seven to 10 transactions per second, compared to MasterCard which claims the ability to process 5,000 per second. To truly become an alternate currency, bitcoin needs to really pick up the pace."

        "content": "The recent surge in Bitcoin (BTC) transaction fees has lit a fire under one of the largest crypto exchanges to upgrade to the Bitcoin Lightning Network. Following a second halt in withdrawals, Binance announced it would work on \u201cenabling BTC Lightning Network withdrawals, which will help in such situations.\u201d\n\nTo prevent a similar recurrence in the future, our fees have been adjusted. We will continue to monitor on-chain activity and adjust accordingly if needed.\n\n\n\nOur team has also been working on enabling BTC Lightning Network withdrawals, which will help in such situations. \u2014 Binance (@binance) May 8, 2023\n\nThe Lightning Network (LN) is a federated system for cheap, near-instant payments built atop Bitcoin. When the Bitcoin mempool (where transactions waiting to be confirmed gather) is full or busy, the Lightning Network is unaffected.\n\nSeveral large crypto exchanges have integrated the Lightning Network, including Bitfinex, River Financial, OKX, Kraken and CoinCorner. If implemented correctly, the Lightning Network would allow users to withdraw and send Bitcoin immediately from wallets, sidestepping the congested Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nFees on Bitcoin are rising, and there are still many Bitcoin (to fiat) exchanges that haven't adopted Lightning deposits and withdrawals\n\n\n\nTechnical challenges are not the reason. Solutions like @RiverRLS exist that make integration fast and easy for any business. The issue is\u2026 pic.twitter.com/WR5u7cjMCx \u2014 Sam Wouters (@SDWouters) May 8, 2023\n\nThe largest crypto exchange in the United States, Coinbase, is also warming up to the LN. Further to comments that CEO Brian Armstrong would integrate the LN soon, Armstrong finally sent Cointelegraph reporter Joe Hall $100 over the Lightning Network, demonstrating that he is familiar with the layer-2 payments protocol.\n\nEuropean Bitcoin exchanges are also embracing the LN. Adem Bilican, the chief technology officer of Swiss-based Bitcoin exchange, Relai, told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cWe believe that Bitcoin is the best savings technology ever invented. But you should be able to spend and send BTC as fast and cheaply as possible. The Lightning Network is the best solution to tackle that, no matter how the on-chain transaction fees look.\u201d\n\nSwiss Bitcoin exchange Pocket Bitcoin recently tweeted it would \u201cget this Lightning thing started\u201d in response to higher and higher fees on the Bitcoin base chain.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin Lightning Network capacity strikes 5K BTC\n\nHowever, given that the LN is a relatively new solution in the crypto space, payment failure can occur. The network is growing and scaling organically, but more liquidity may help the network scale faster. Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer of Bitfinex, shed light on the situation:\n\n\u201cThe Bitfinex node is the most interconnected node on the entire Lightning Network. It is also the biggest, providing liquidity to most of the other nodes. Hence the chances of failure are extremely low.\u201c\n\nTrue to form, Ardoino tweeted in response to the high fees that users should ask their crypto exchange to integrate LN. Binance and Coinbase are hopping on board, with other large exchanges Gemini, KuCoin and Bybit yet to announce implementing the LN.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin in Senegal: Why is this African country using BTC?"

Though by doing so, you risk waiting around for hours as miners prioritize more lucrative transactions.\n\nBitcoiners can even choose to pay no transaction fee\u2014but miners may completely ignore such transactions and it will never reach its destination.\n\nThe Lightning Network is another option for lower fees: the \"second-layer solution\" speeds up transactions by skirting the main Bitcoin blockchain.

        "content": "The apparent exit or reduction in trading by Jane Street and Jump Crypto, two influential cryptocurrency market makers, has the potential to disrupt the fragile flow of liquidity across the industry, an analyst at Kaiko told CoinDesk.\n\nJane Street and Jump are paring back crypto trading in the U.S., Bloomberg reported Tuesday, amid the regulatory clampdown that spawned out of FTX's collapse in November. Jump's crypto division will continue to expand globally while Jane Street will scale back on its growth plans, Bloomberg reported.\n\n\"The news is not necessarily surprising given recent developments,\" Kaiko analyst Riyad Carey told CoinDesk. \"What's concerning is that liquidity has still not recovered from Alameda's collapse, and a slowdown with two of the biggest surviving market makers could weigh on liquidity even further. It's a bit surprising how slow the industry has been to fill Alameda's shoes.\"\n\nMarket depth, a metric used to measure liquidity on exchanges by assessing how much capital is required to move a market, slumped by more than 50% following the collapse of FTX and has failed to recover despite a rise in crypto prices.\n\nCrypto-native market makers, unlike traditional firms such as Jane Street and Jump, aren't put off by the duo's exodus as the issue is constrained to the U.S. market.\n\n\"Not a big impact yet,\" Zahreddine Touag, Head of Trading at Paris-based market market Woorton, told CoinDesk. \"In the short term, some exchanges will be less liquid but more importantly it will be more difficult for US counterparties to source OTC liquidity.\"\n\n\"We might see it in the future if brokers, payment providers and other actors looking to source liquidity start shifting offshore or to Europe and Asia,\" he added.\n\nThe United States' gung-ho stance on crypto regulation has already attracted criticism from the likes of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, but the long-lasting effects are potentially far greater than any short-term tremble.\n\nAn absence of liquidity, which is what the crypto industry will experience as several market makers jump ship, causes an increase in volatility as it takes less capital to move an asset. This, coupled with this highly-leveraged nature of crypto markets, has the potential to create a credit risk that could spread to all sectors of finance."

        "content": "Warren Buffett moving into cash suggests he\u2019s bracing for a possible collapse in risk-on asset prices. With Bitcoin (BTC) up 70% year-to-date and correlated with equities, should BTC investors also prepare for a potential stock market crash?\n\nBuffett says \u201cincredible period\u201d is over\n\nBuffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway dumped $13.30 billion worth of equities and increased exposure in cash and United States Treasurys in Q1, its latest quarterly earnings report shows. Meanwhile, it channeled $4.4 billion toward purchasing its own stock and $2.9 billion on the shares of other publicly-traded companies.\n\nThe market considers Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s performance as a key indicator to gauge the U.S. economy\u2019s health, given the firm\u2019s holdings range from American railroad to electric utilities and retail businesses.\n\nBut the 92-year-old investor, who has credited the U.S. economy\u2019s growth for the success of Berkshire Hathaway in the past, is no longer optimistic.\n\n\u201cThe majority of our businesses will report lower earnings this year than last year,\u201d Buffett said last weekend at an event. The \u201cincredible period\u201d for the U.S. economy has been coming to an end over the past six months, he added.\n\nBerkshire raised its cash reserves by $2 billion to $130.60 billion in Q1 2023, the highest level since the end of 2021 when equities entered a bear cycle. Moreover, the firm holds a vast amount of its cash in short-term Treasury bills and bank deposits, thanks to higher interest rates near 5%.\n\nIn other words, Buffett is preparing for a potential stock market crash, particularly as the U.S. banking crisis unfolds, with shares of many banks, such as PacWest Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp, sinking.\n\nBitcoin price stays correlated with Nasdaq\n\nThe increasing possibility of a global recession also risks putting downside pressure on Bitcoin, with its 100-week correlation with the Nasdaq reaching its highest level of about 0.42%.\n\nMoreover, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike McGlone expects that BTC price would likely be the leading indicator for a stock crash.\n\n\u201cBitcoin could pace declines for risk assets \u2014 If the worst isn\u2019t over for risk assets, Bitcoin may lead the way lower,\u201d commented McGlone, adding:\n\n\u201cBitcoin is up about 70% in 2023 to May 2 vs. 20% for the stock index, and those are maybe bounces within broader bear markets. The Fed [is] still tightening in May, and [is] more inclined to stay the course unless risk assets fall to ease inflation, may portend a lose-lose.\u201c\n\nBitcoin/Nasdaq correlation index. Source: Bloomberg Intelligence\n\nIn the short term, there are little expectations from the U.S. Consumer Price Index report on May 10 about easing inflation in April. According to Bloomberg\u2019s survey, economists expect core CPI to remain unchanged at around 5%, suggesting more rate hikes are ahead.\n\nOn the other hand, a significant drop in inflation will likely prompt the Fed to consider pausing or even slashing interest rates in an extreme case scenario.\n\nCurrently, Fed funds futures\u2019 data suggests that at least five rate cuts between May 2023 and January 2024 are likely, which may pour cold water on Buffett\u2019s risk-off strategy.\n\nFed funds rate projections. Source: Bloomberg\n\nCould Bitcoin price fall below $25K again?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price has declined roughly 6% over the past week, trading for as low as $27,350 on May 9.\n\nNotably, this has pulled BTC\u2019s price below its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave), near $27,950.\n\nBitcoin bears are now eyeing $27,000 as the next downside target based on the level\u2019s recent history.\n\nBTC/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nA decisive break below the $27,000 support, primarily in the event of further rate hikes, could then pull BTC/USD down to its 200-day EMA (the blue wave) near $24,600. In other words, a 10% drop by June.\n\nConversely, a rebound from $27,000 increases the possibility of BTC price retesting $30,000 as resistance and resuming the uptrend of the last few months.\n\nRelated: Analysts at odds over Fed, US debt ceiling impact on Bitcoin price\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAmid Bitcoin\u2019s recent spike in transaction fees, block number 788695 marks a special milestone for miners: For the first time since 2017, the transaction fees in a single block surpassed the block rewards doled out to miners. Transaction fees in the block clocked in at 6.7 Bitcoin, beating the block subsidy of 6.25 Bitcoin.\n\nThough this spike in fees has thrown a curveball to users, this block shows how it's benefitting Bitcoin miners, the global network of volunteers that run expensive, specialized computers to secure the Bitcoin network. They\u2019re the ones raking in this newfound treasure trove of fees.\n\nBREAKING: #Bitcoin block 788695 contained transaction fees greater than the block subsidy. 6.7 BTC transaction fees + 6.25 BTC subsidy This is a the first time in history this has ever occurred due to competitively high block space demand. pic.twitter.com/J7IcwzIVKE \u2014 Joe Burnett (\ud83d\udd11)\u00b3 (@IIICapital) May 7, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin miners have two sources of income built in for them. One is the block subsidy. Roughly every 10 minutes, miners are awarded 6.25 Bitcoin. This value is split in half every four years in an event known as the Bitcoin \u201chalvening.\u201d\n\nThe second source is transaction fees. Users optionally can tag on a fee to every Bitcoin transaction. If there's more demand for Bitcoin, users need to hike their fee if they want it to get through in a timely manner. There's been lots of demand recently, pushing the average fee up to $19 according to cryptocurrency statistics website BitInfoCharts.\n\nAs such, the transaction fee source of income fluctuates somewhat erratically with demand.\n\nOne reason bitcoiners find this surplus in fees so monumental is that eventually \u2014 in more than a hundred years \u2014 transaction fees will be miners' sole source of income. But transaction fees fluctuate so often, it hasn\u2019t yet been proven that it will provide a consistent source of income when that time finally rolls around.\n\nMiners are the glue holding Bitcoin together. The more hashing power provided by miners securing Bitcoin, the more secure Bitcoin is. But miners are unlikely to secure the network if they aren\u2019t paid to do it. Therefore it could be bad for Bitcoin if transaction fees don\u2019t increase over the years.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlock 788695 is a small, optimistic sign that fees could increase, even if it hasn't proved a consistent form of income for miners just yet. As self-custody platform Casa CTO Jameson Lopp put it on Twitter: \"The model for thermodynamic security has been proven possible. The only remaining question is if this demand is sustainable.\""

        "content": "Since Bitcoin NFTs, or Ordinals, were introduced in December, some have hailed them as the next big thing for the emerging non-fungible token space\u2014and a positive evolution for the Bitcoin network.\n\nOthers aren\u2019t convinced.\n\nOn Tuesday, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, Binance, endorsed the Bitcoin NFTs by announcing that the Binance NFT marketplace would start supporting the tech sometime in May.\n\n\u201cWe believe things are just getting started here and can\u2019t wait to see what the future holds in this space,\u201d Binance\u2019s head of product, Mayur Kamat, said in a statement.\n\nOrdinals are similar to other NFTs in that they allow text, images, audio, and other media to be tracked on the blockchain. But unlike other NFTs that may point to outside servers that store the media they represent, Ordinals fully exist on the blockchain, with the media \u201cinscribed\u201d directly on a Satoshi, the smallest denomination of a Bitcoin.\n\nBinance also said it will make it simple for users to buy and sell a Bitcoin NFT \u201cinscription\u201d by letting them do so from their Binance accounts rather than a separate inscription-compatible wallet.\n\nSome Bitcoin supporters have said Ordinals are a good way for the network to expand beyond purely financial use cases. Still, some on Crypto Twitter aren\u2019t happy about the growing popularity of Bitcoin NFTs, citing network delays caused by the increase in transactions.\n\n$BTC #blockchain is struggling with enormous amount of transactions. After Aprils update of BRC-20 on #Bitcoin Ordinals, a lot of tokens were created and messed the whole network.\n\n\n\nImo #BTC is too old and slow for being a competitor of Ethereum ERC-20 network. 1/2 pic.twitter.com/M7gQtHauyy \u2014 Crypto Sarah \u00ae\ufe0f ( Beware Scammers ) (@sarahparker345) May 8, 2023\n\nBinance is joining rival NFT marketplace Magic Eden, which was one of the first mainstream marketplaces to support Ordinals, and quickly became a go-to destination. It had recorded almost 2,300 transactions by midday Wednesday, according to a dashboard on Dune. The increased popularity of Ordinals comes as developers on other networks including Solana have challenged Ethereum\u2019s dominance in NFT transactions with new projects and experiments like xNFTs.\n\nBitcoin transactions have exploded on the network recently, boosted in part by Ordinals. In early May, the network recorded more than 680,000 daily transactions, the most ever. The fees to record a new transaction on the Bitcoin network have skyrocketed to $20 from just under $3 earlier this month, according to BitInfoCharts."

The development will expand Binance\u2019s multichain NFT ecosystem to include the Bitcoin network.\n\nPreviously the Binance NFT market integrated with other decentralized networks, including BNB Chain, Ethereum and Polygon.\n\nMayur Kamat, the head of product at Binance, commented on broadening the offerings in the marketplace and Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) crypto legacy:\n\n\u201cBitcoin is the OG of crypto.\u201d\n\nThe update allows Binance users to purchase and trade Bitcoin ordinals from existing Binance accounts. According to the announcement, the update will also include royalty support and \u201cadditional revenue generating opportunities\u201d for those creating Bitcoin ordinals.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin metrics to the moon: ATH for hash rate, daily transactions and Ordinals\n\nPrior to Binance\u2019s announcement, the cryptocurrency exchange OKX similarly announced in late April that it was bringing Bitcoin ordinals to its marketplace and wallet ecosystem.

However, on May 1, the total number of Bitcoin ordinal inscriptions skyrocketed to exceed 3 million.\n\nNonetheless, they remain a controversial topic within the crypto community, with Bitcoin maximalists criticizing them for deviating from Bitcoin\u2019s original peer-to-peer ethos.\n\nMagazine: ZK-rollups are \u2018the endgame\u2019 for scaling blockchains: Polygon Miden founder"

Because of this increased circulation, Tether\u2019s total reserves have reached their highest point ever, at approximately $81.8 billion.\n\nTether\u2019s newest growth may have been partially caused by the decline of its largest competitor, Circle\u2019s USD Coin (USDC). USDC briefly depegged in the secondary market in March due to concerns about its exposure to the failed Silicon Valley Bank. The coin regained its peg quickly, but its market cap has declined ever since. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire has cited an alleged United States regulatory crackdown on crypto as another factor for its recent decline."

        "content": "Two CryptoQuant analysts have opined that BTC\u2019s price will fall below $25,000.\n\nBTC\u2019s selling pressure has outweighed its buying pressure in the past few days.\n\nAs Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] weighted sentiment lingers in the negative territory, CryptoQuant analyst Baro Virtual, in a new report, opined that the king coin\u2019s price could fall below $25,000 as long as bearish sentiments remain in the market.\n\nBaro\u2019s conclusion was based on an assessment of BTC\u2019s Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) on a 21-day moving average. This metric tracks the number of cryptocurrency coins that have been inactive for a certain period of time and then suddenly moved.\n\nAccording to Glassnode Academy, it is calculated by multiplying the number of coins that have been inactive by the number of days they have been inactive.\n\nAccording to Baro, BTC\u2019s CDD metric revealed that the king coin enjoyed three periods of local accumulation on 15 March, 31 March, and 12 April, respectively, after which a period of local distribution began on 20 April.\n\nLocal distribution occurs when investors take to selling their holdings, causing the price of an asset to either stagnate or decrease slightly.\n\nAlthough BTC lingers in this phase, Baro added, \u201cBitcoin is still moving within a local uptrend.\u201d However, \u201cthe danger of falling to $24,500-25,000 remains within the bearish H&S pattern.\u201d\n\nSharing the same opinion, another pseudonymous CryptoQuant analyst Abramchart noted that a new support area had been identified following BTC\u2019s fall from the $30,000 price mark. According to Abramchart,\n\n\u201cAfter the recent drop in Bitcoin, we can identify the next support areas through the Realized Price \u2013 UTXO Age Bands indicator, which helps us to understand the holding behavior of each group by comparing a set of different realized prices. The closest support area is at 25619, which represents the average purchase price of wallets that bought Bitcoin within the last 3-6 months.\u201d\n\nThe numbers on a daily chart\n\nAt press time, BTC exchanged hands at $27,579.73. After the coin\u2019s price peaked at $30,967 on 14 April, it has since dropped by 11%.\n\nOn a daily chart, the coin\u2019s momentum indicator Relative Strength Index (RSI) rested below its 50-neutral spot at 42.44. In a downtrend at the time of writing, selling pressure exceeded accumulation.\n\nAlso, the coin\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) was spotted below its centerline at -0.02. When an asset\u2019s CMF returns a negative value, it means that the selling pressure is higher than the buying pressure.\n\nIt also suggests that the asset\u2019s money flow volume is decreasing, and is often followed by a price decline."

        "content": "Bitcoin Fees Hit a Staggering $24m Following Ordinals \u2018NFT\u2019 Craze\n\nTransaction fees for Bitcoin have spiked to $19 due to the elevated demand for blockspace following the creation of NFTs using the Ordinals protocol. With the total amount of Inscriptions hitting 5,010,014 to date, the NFT craze has led to the total fees of Ordinals to hit ~$24,285,831, according to data by Dune Analytics \u2014 causing congestion and blockchain backlog.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin miners are dramatically benefiting from the Ordinals surge, critics perceive Bitcoin NFTs as attacking the network, defacing the peer-to-peer financial network that the Bitcoin blockchain enables. In addition, the mountainous costs for Bitcoin transactions and longer confirmation times make it tricky for crypto enthusiasts to use Bitcoin for minor transactions, with Salvador\u2019s Chivo ATM system being unstable due to costly gas fees.\n\nOrdinals have provoked the widespread use of the Bitcoin network\u2019s Taproot update, which was activated in 2021. This way of inscribing digital content on the Bitcoin blockchain has driven enormous hype, with vocal Ordinal advocates claiming that inscriptions are a game-changing experience for the NFT sphere, despite of the issues mentioned above.\n\nOverriding Bitcoin Fees \u2013 A Possible Solution\n\nLightning Network allows Web3 users to transact using much smaller fees without waiting for confirmation on the underlying blockchain. Lightning users can quickly settle their Bitcoin transactions to the fundamental Bitcoin foundation whenever they wish, waiting for convenient times to dodge high fees and congestion. For this reason, the cryptocurrency exchange Binance is scoping ways to add Lightning features. Other exchanges like OKX, Kraken and Bitfinex already support this second-layer payment protocol built on a blockchain. Consequently, the number of Lightning channels and nodes has been descending over the past month, while the price of regular Bitcoin transactions is ever-increasing.\n\nAs more exchanges implement Lightning features, it will be interesting to see how the Bitcoin network adapts to the increasing demand for Ordinal NFTs and prevents such high-fee transactions.\n\nWant more?

The larger 200MW site will be located in the sustainability hub of Abu Dhabi, Masdar City, and the 50MW site will be located in the port zone of Mina Zayed. To power the sites, Marathon and Zero Two intend to leverage excess energy in Abu Dhabi, increasing the base load and sustainability of the Abu Dhabi grid. Marathon and Zero Two will offset any non-sustainably produced electricity with clean energy certificates.\n\nThe equity ownership in the ADGM Entity will be 80% for Zero Two and 20% for Marathon. During the 2023 development period, capital contributions, in proportion to the equity interest in the ADGM entity, are anticipated to total approximately US$ 406 million in aggregate. These contributions will consist of both cash and in-kind (i.e., equipment, infrastructure, etc.) amounts. The digital assets mined (i.e., bitcoin) by the ADGM Entity will be distributed twice per month and in accordance with the equity ownership between Zero Two and Marathon, respectively.\n\nPreviously, Marathon and Zero Two launched a pilot program to test the efficacy of building a large-scale digital asset mining operation in Abu Dhabi"

        "content": "Enrico Rubboli, Mintlayer CEO. This is an Op-Ed piece byCEO.\n\nThe Bitcoin network has been whipped into a frenzy by a new token standard known as BRC-20. But amid the hype and excitement it has unleashed, I\u2019m deeply concerned that this new breed of crypto assets is going to drag Bitcoin deep into the mud.\n\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with BRC-20, here\u2019s a quick explainer: It\u2019s an experimental new token standard built on the Bitcoin blockchain network. Designed by a pseudo-anonymous developer who goes by the name of Domo on Twitter, BRC-20 is said to be a Bitcoin-based solution for the creation and transfer of new digital assets.\n\nBRC-20 is loosely modeled on Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 standard, but its architecture is quite a bit different, using a concept known as \u201cordinals\u201d that\u2019s built into Satoshis, the smallest units of Bitcoin. Just as ERC-20 enables users to create their own cryptocurrencies on Ethereum, BRC-20 makes it possible for anyone to deploy their own tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nAlthough it was started as an experiment, BRC-20 has spread like wildfire with hundreds of new tokens minted in the past couple of months. Their collective market cap has exploded and now sits at a startling $760 million.\n\nIt\u2019s an incredible rise that tells us how millions of people are embracing the experiment, but there are many reasons to be wary of BRC-20\u2019s emergence. Its experimental and completely unregulated nature poses an acute danger to Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s vision of Bitcoin as \u201ca new electronic cash system that\u2019s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.\u201d\n\nNetwork congestion\n\nThe frenzy around BRC-20 has already caused problems for Bitcoin as transactions rise to drown out those of BTC itself. Between April 29 and May 2, BRC-20 token swaps accounted for greater than 50% of all network transactions. That isn\u2019t something I believe Bitcoin users will be happy to hear about. Bitcoin\u2019s network was already notoriously congested even before BRC-20 emerged, and with the addition of so many new tokens, it has only gotten worse, with some users reporting that they have to wait hours for regular BTC transactions to be processed.\n\nAs a result, Bitcoin\u2019s transaction fees have increased too. According to Dune Analytics, BRC-20 transactions have already numbered more than 3.5 million in total, generating an additional 493 BTC (around $14 million) in miners\u2019 fees. What\u2019s more, due to the stacked nature of the user interfaces on which these tokens are built, transactions involving these tokens cost users twice as much, as they\u2019re required to pay gas fees not only with their BRC-20 coins but also in BTC.\n\nCongestion became so bad that the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, Binance, this week briefly halted Bitcoin withdrawals, not once, but twice within a 24-hour period. According to Bloomberg, the exchange was forced to take action due to a \u201cbacklog\u201d of withdrawals that occurred because its fees fell short of what miners were charging. Binance has since restarted withdrawals, after increasing the fees it charges users.\n\nWorthless tokens\n\nIt\u2019s almost inevitable that the majority of BRC-20 coins will turn out to be \u201cshitcoins\u201d, AKA cryptocurrencies that have no value. Head over to YouTube and search for BRC-20 and you\u2019ll find dozens of \u201cinfluencers\u201d with their eyes bulging, screaming excitedly about this or that token going to the moon, with graphs depicting their meteoric rise in value. Make no mistake, most of these guys are making $$$ by promoting worthless tokens that are going to leave a lot of people burned.\n\nIf BRC-20\u2019s association with these showboaters doesn\u2019t put you off, consider that its creator Domo has already warned his Twitter followers that most of the tokens are worthless. The fact is, BRC-20 tokens have nothing to do with the real Bitcoin other than the fact that they use the same network. BRC-20 is simply a JSON script file that makes it possible for almost anyone to add metadata to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, create a new token in the process, and transfer it between users by sending Satoshis. But they\u2019re not creating anything with inherent value.\n\nDomo also warned that the inscription tools of some BRC-20 tokens are built to mint new assets in an intermediary\u2019s wallet, meaning that users will lose control of those coins at the time they are minted.\n\nI\u2019m quite convinced that most BRC-20 tokens are simply taking advantage of Bitcoin\u2019s legitimacy as the world\u2019s best-known and most trusted cryptocurrency. By masquerading as something that\u2019s associated with Bitcoin, they\u2019re able to lure in unsuspecting users, who might assume that BRC-20 tokens are just as trustworthy as BTC is. That is not the case though, as BRC-20 tokens have neither the same level of security, decentralization, or recognition.\n\nAdded complexity\n\nOne of Bitcoin\u2019s major benefits is that, compared to other cryptocurrencies, it is incredibly straightforward and user-friendly, especially with modern wallets. That isn\u2019t so with BRC-20 tokens, which markedly increase the complexity of managing crypto assets. For instance, a separate wallet is required to hold them, and they require a different protocol together with additional steps to transact.\n\nIt\u2019s an added headache that will cause more confusion among new users, raising the risk of human error during transactions. Users risk losing their assets as they could make mistakes with the unfamiliar transaction process and wallets, and this will likely mean that more people simply rely on a custodian instead.\n\nAs a result, the vast majority of BRC-20 token users will look to centralized exchanges to manage their assets for them. Rather than set up a new wallet, they\u2019ll leave their tokens in the custody of whatever CEX they purchased them from.\n\nHowever, smart crypto users know to be wary of keeping too much value on an exchange. As the recent FTX debacle showed us, not to mention Mt. Gox long before, it\u2019s not only the risks of hacking that we need to worry about, but also gross mismanagement, as you can never be sure what such platforms will do with your funds. Due to their complex nature, BRC-20 tokens encourage the use of CEXs, which undermines Bitcoin\u2019s founding principle of decentralization and ownership.\n\nRegulatory headaches\n\nBRC-20\u2019s misleading association with Bitcoin may well end up causing all sorts of regulatory headaches too. The danger is that by obfuscating the difference between these random tokens and BTC itself, new investors might be misled into believing they\u2019re acquiring a secure and established digital asset, when in fact they\u2019re exposing themselves to extreme risk.\n\nOne of my major concerns is the potential of BRC-20 to facilitate the trade of unregistered securities on Bitcoin itself. Scammers could create tokens that are claimed to represent shares in a company, crypto project or some other venture, skirting all regulatory oversight. This would put investors at considerable risk and could ultimately expose Bitcoin itself to increased regulatory scrutiny, simply because of a few bad actors.\n\nBRC-20 is best avoided\n\nBRC-20\u2019s creator Domo may well have had good intentions when he or she first created the standards. The ability to create new assets and trade them on Bitcoin\u2019s network might seem attractive to many, but as we\u2019ve seen with the frenzy that followed, most of these tokens are designed to make their creators rich. Meanwhile, they divert capital that would otherwise stay within Bitcoin itself. Very few, if any, BRC-20 coins represent genuine projects.\n\nWhatever the benefits of BRC-20 tokens may be, they are far outweighed by the risks I\u2019ve outlined above. In reality, BRC-20 is just the latest implementation of fool\u2019s gold, dressed up in an attractive wrapper that belies its lack of value.\n\nOf course, there will be some who are willing to gamble on the prospects of BRC-20 anyhow, and they\u2019re free to ignore all of the red flags I\u2019ve listed. But for anyone who\u2019s risk-averse and believes that Bitcoin is truly where the future of money lies, BRC-20 is clearly something best avoided.\n\nSteer clear of BRC-20 and focus on Bitcoin instead and you\u2019ll not only protect yourself from unnecessary risk but also contribute to the stability and growth of the one true crypto asset that\u2019s sure to outlive anything trying to hijack its success.\n\nWhen you hold Bitcoin, you\u2019re helping to make Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s vision become a reality and create a more equitable financial future for the world. Hold some BRC-20 shitcoin, and all you\u2019re doing is feeding the scammer or joker who created it.\n\nDon\u2019t be the next victim, steer clear of the fool\u2019s gold that BRC-20 shitcoins most certainly are."

        "title": "Walgreens brings crypto-enabled ATMs to stores - ATM Marketplace",
        "content": "Walgreens has deployed more than 1,300 ATMs that not only accept cash but also provide cryptocurrency purchasing/selling and mobile send/receive cash capabilities.\n\nWhile the news cycle is churning stories decrying the decline of the ATM, stores are embracing ATMs \u2014 especially ones that deliver cryptocurrency. One example is Walgreens, which has more than 9,000 stores in all U.S. states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico.\n\nNCR Corp. recently expanded its existing relationship with Walgreens to offer its services to nearly all of these locations and will install more than 1,300 Allpoint+ cash-accepting ATMs, offering surcharge-free cash access to customers.\n\nIn addition, customers can use the ATMs to purchase cryptocurrency due to NCR's LibertyX platform. With this platform, customers can use a debit card or cash to purchase popular cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.\n\nThese ATMs will also offer NCR Pay360, a mobile app which customers can use to send and receive cash with a single code.\n\nTo learn more about the partnership, ATM Marketplace reached out to a NCR spokesperson via an email interview.\n\nQ. Can you give a little background on the history of the partnership?\n\nA. NCR has been executing on bringing everyday financial services to Walgreens guests for more than 15 years. As the owner and operator of Allpoint, NCR is uniquely positioned to support Walgreens' financial services vision to deliver more joyful lives through better financial health. Our new, long-term agreement expands the Allpoint reach into new markets, promises to deliver many new Allpoint+ locations and is expected to expand our LibertyX and NCR Pay360 capabilities to the entire NCR-operated Walgreens fleet.\n\nQ. What are some innovative features of the AllPoint network?\n\nA. Allpoint is the largest retailer-centric, surcharge-free network in the U.S., and offers surcharge-free cash access to over 1,200 issuers, including two of the five largest U.S. banks by deposit, representing more than 70 million cardholders. Allpoint is an important element of distribution for each of our issuers.\n\nFinancial institution branch transformation: Since 2017, more than 4,400 bank branches have closed in the U.S. Transactions will continue to flow from branches to ATMs. This shift in consumer behavior positions Allpoint well as a platform for giving consumers access to financial services in some of the places they visit most often.\n\nContinued consumer reliance on cash transactions: ATM consumers make an average of 3.8 cash withdrawals and 2.5 cash deposits per month. Allpoint is the only retail-based network to accept cash deposits, via our Allpoint+ network of ATMs.\n\nFinancial services hub: Walgreens can leverage the power and unique capabilities of the Allpoint network to provide more financial transactions that consumers demand. Allpoint provides the platform as Walgreens shoppers seek a physical hub to complete their financial transactions.\n\nQ. How does Pay360 benefit customers?\n\nA. Innovation has always been at the heart of NCR, to meet the evolving needs of the market, including end consumers, retail partners and financial institutions. Our newest innovation, NCR Pay360, supports cardless cash-out and cash-in transactions. These cardless, code-based transactions can support over 30 new product categories, driving higher usage of our ATM estate while helping new companies and organizations find value in ATMs, benefiting the overall ATM ecosystem. Examples include digital wallets and employer and government benefits and rebates. In addition, our exclusive proprietary ATM network terminal software suite brings more control to the overall management of each terminal, improving speed to market, security and analytics capabilities.\n\nQ. Does the LibertyX bitcoin feature draw in a large amount of new customers or existing users?\n\nA. We wouldn't be in a position to share that level of detail on the customer base, but we are excited about the performance and growth we are seeing for LibertyX. LibertyX brings access to bitcoin purchases in a secure and compliant manner at places consumers already visit. At the same time, it brings a new transaction offering to our ATMs, with the potential to bring more foot traffic to the retailers that host these ATMs.\n\nWalgreens did not respond for a request to comment from ATMmarketplace on its ATM strategy."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Is Ethereum a Good Investment? - Macrohive",
        "content": "[Updated 16 May 2023]\n\nSummary\n\nWe look at the latest ethereum trends, including macro risks and on-chain/flow metrics, to reveal the best time to buy ethereum and the risks of buying ETH.\n\nFor trading ethereum over the next two to four weeks, we are slightly bearish. That means we expect prices to either stay the same or fall, with more chance they will fall.\n\nHowever, we think ethereum is a good long-term investment for the next one to three years and are bullish overall. That means we expect prices to rise in the long term.\n\nIs Now a Good Time to Buy Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is currently amid a cumulative drawdown of around 62% since the November 2021 all-time high of $4,891 and is trading at around $1,820. However, the last six months have been more positive, with ethereum up 49%.\n\nOne of the main drivers of ethereum price rises is the market\u2019s hope that the Federal Reserve has finished hiking interest rates. However, we think the Fed is not done with its aggressive hiking cycle, and recession risks are increasing.\n\nConsequently, the macro backdrop for ethereum is bearish. We analyse various on-chain/flow metrics for ethereum, which are neutral. Overall, we are neutral to bearish on ETH in the short term. Therefore, if you have a two-to-four-week horizon, now may not be a good time to buy ethereum.\n\nShould I buy ethereum? Probably not\n\nWhy Has the ETH Price Risen Recently?\n\nReasons for the Current ETH Price (Short-Term View)\n\nCrypto markets surged this year after the FDIC announced it would back all deposits at Silicon Valley Bank. This move follows the Silvergate Capital collapse and has calmed fears of a potential bank run across the US. As a result, ethereum and the wider crypto market are rallying.\n\nAlso helping the ethereum price is the market\u2019s hope that the Federal Reserve has finished hiking interest rates. After one of the most aggressive hiking campaigns in decades, the Fed seems to have finally got inflation under control. After peaking at 9.1% in June 2022, headline inflation has fallen steadily to 4.9%.\n\nHiking interest rates is a contractionary monetary policy that increases the cost of borrowing, reduces demand, and is generally negative for risk assets such as stocks and crypto. It also increases the risk of recession. However, if the Fed starts easing rates, as markets currently expect for 2023, risk assets like ethereum may benefit.\n\nThe chart below shows the latest ETH price.\n\nPrevious reasons for bullishness towards ethereum included the merge, ETH\u2019s upgrade to proof-of-stake. In a previous ethereum update, we discussed the implications of the merge. The punchline was it would be bullish for these reasons:\n\nValidators can earn yield on staked ETH post merge.\n\nFaster transactions.\n\nNet issuance is projected to drop considerably post merge, constraining supply.\n\nEthereum may become deflationary.\n\nIncreased scalability and security.\n\nBetter for the environment thanks to proof of stake not work.\n\nHowever, ethereum and the broader crypto space have been unable to escape the longer-term bearish macro backdrop. We discuss that next.\n\nLike these insights? Join our free newsletter for regular updates and trade ideas. Want to receive our latest macro and financial market updates? Subscribe to our newsletters! SUBSCRIBE\n\nWhy Has the ETH Price Dropped?\n\nMacro Reasons for the Current Ethereum Price (Long-Term View)\n\nWhy is ethereum dropping? The main reason for the fall going into 2023 was the Federal Reserve\u2019s response to inflation. It has hiked interest rates an aggressive 500 basis points in this cycle, and this contractionary monetary policy tends to impact risk assets such as crypto negatively.\n\nMarkets seem to think the Fed is done hiking and has conquered inflation. However, April CPI showed no incremental progress on disinflation. Here are some of our main takeaways:\n\nA large increase in used car prices offset slower inflation in other categories.\n\nThe ongoing recovery in rental indices suggests that progress on shelter cost inflation may be transitory.\n\nApril core goods inflation rose to 0.6% due to a 4.4% increase in used car prices, which is converging to Manheim used car auction results, indicating further upside.\n\nMarkets continue to under-price the Fed. The labour market remains very tight, inflation is well above target, and \u2018the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go.\u2019 Markets are currently assigning just a 5% chance of a 25bp June FOMC hike. In our view, markets are under-pricing the risk of a hike and if current inflation and growth dynamics continue, a 25bp hike in June is likely (barring a debt ceiling crisis), which would be bearish for crypto.\n\nHow Interest Rates Affect Crypto\n\nYears of low interest rates since the global financial crisis in 2008 had seen markets reach extreme valuations by the end of 2021. Who cares if tech companies are loss-making if the companies can borrow easily? And if companies cannot borrow money, they can attract capital from investors, who themselves have likely borrowed money.\n\nCrypto markets have not been immune to the support from cheap leverage in the fiat markets. After all, crypto offers the tech dream of scalability and regulatory arbitrage. And if there was any doubt that crypto was not benefiting from low interest rates, the recent declines in crypto as US rates have risen should remove it.\n\nFurthermore, the correlation of ethereum to NASDAQ started to increase sharply just as US interest rates started to rise. This is a common occurrence throughout history. When the liquidity tap turns off, usually by central banks raising rates, the correlation between diverse assets shoots up. This time appears no different.\n\nThe bottom line is that the macro backdrop for crypto remains bearish on rate hikes and inflation. The probability of recession remains high at 80%, and we expect the Fed to hike more than markets are pricing in.\n\nHow Low Can Ethereum Prices Go?\n\nOne exercise is to see how low prices could get were the NASDAQ to suffer a 2000-style crash. After all, the ethereum and NASDAQ correlation was around 80% until recently. So where the NASDAQ goes, ethereum follows.\n\nBack in 2000, the NASDAQ suffered a 78% drawdown. Currently, the NASDAQ is in a 30% drawdown. A repeat of the 2000-style drawdown would put the NASDAQ at 3,500. So where would crypto be if NASDAQ were trading at this level? We estimate a regression between ethereum/bitcoin returns and NASDAQ returns from 2020 onwards. Based on this relationship, we find:\n\nBitcoin prices would reach $8,254 if the NASDAQ fell to 3,500. This implies a 72% decline from current levels.\n\nEthereum prices would reach $143 if the NASDAQ fell to 3,500. This implies a 92% decline from current levels.\n\nHow High Can Ethereum Go?\n\nShould the currently restrictive environment of rising interest rates and recession risks subside, we could see ethereum return to its all-time high of $4,379 or even beyond. However, we caution that this scenario is unlikely in the short term and, like with any investment, it is impossible to say with certainty how high ethereum will go.\n\nWhat Else Is Happening in Crypto?\n\nRegulation also is becoming more of a theme throughout 2023, with various executive orders signed already. Increased regulation should mean less uncertainty around crypto markets for investors, which would be bullish.\n\nOn the flip side, overregulation could stifle innovation by increasing censorship. The ongoing regulatory backdrop will be key to monitor. Lastly, on ethereum specifically, there is the much-anticipated merge. We previously covered its potential implications. The punchline was that it should be bullish for ethereum.\n\nCrypto News Impacting the ETH Price\n\nRising yields have mechanically increased the probability of a recession within the next 12 months to over 80%.\n\nhave mechanically increased the probability of a recession within the next 12 months to over 80%.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) is targeting crypto companies that engage in crimes themselves or allow crimes like money laundering to happen.\n\nSummary of ETH Analysis\n\nThe bottom line is that crypto, including ethereum, will remain under pressure. The main near-term support would be Fed dovishness rather than any crypto-specific dynamics. While this is possible, persistent inflation and a roaring economy make it unlikely. And for long-term investors, we still think some allocation to crypto makes sense \u2013 just like an allocation to equities also makes sense. But be prepared for weakness in 2022-3.\n\nFor all our latest analysis on crypto markets, click here.\n\nEthereum and Crypto Price Trackers\n\nUpdated 12 May 2023\n\nThis week, all our indices are in the red, with our Bitcoin Index (-6.3% WoW) down the least and our Metaverse Index (-15.6% WoW) down the most (Chart 2).\n\nOur Smart Contract Index remains most correlated to our Bitcoin Index (+87%).

With the length of the blockchain continuing to grow and decentralised finance (DeFi) gaining ground over traditional finance, this new asset class is reshaping the investment landscape.\n\nWe think ethereum is a worthwhile long-term investment. However, we also note that ethereum is extremely volatile. That means it experiences large price movements over short periods. Before you invest in ETH, you must understand the risks involved: you could lose all or a large portion of your investment. Never invest money that you cannot afford to lose.\n\nHow to Make Money Investing in Ethereum\n\nIt is easy to get carried away with the fear of missing out. You are probably aware of Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who are reputed to be the world\u2019s first bitcoin billionaires with over 100,000 coins. Or what about Barry Silbert, the owner of Grayscale Ethereum Trust, Coinbase and Coinbase? Success stories like these often give people FOMO \u2013 or the fear of missing out \u2013 if they do not invest immediately.\n\nHowever, to invest in cryptocurrency, we must first understand it. Crypto tokens are unlike any traditional asset class. And they are all different. Just because you understand bitcoin, does not mean you know how ethereum works. Our video on bitcoin and ethereum fundamentals can help you understand how ethereum prices fluctuate and how to assess trends in important ethereum metrics. And the video below explains other cryptocurrencies that might put ethereum at risk.\n\nEach currency has different underlying protocols and technology. That impacts how they trade, their volatility, and how you can value them. Some are more like stocks, others commodities, and others currencies. And each crypto token has a unique structure of supply.\n\nWe think crypto markets are a worthwhile long-term investment. The technology can capture market share on some existing markets like payments and stock trading while creating new markets like valuable scarce digital assets.\n\nBuying the Dip\n\nYour exposure to ethereum needs to be appropriately sized so that you can survive 50% to 80% drawdowns. Drawdowns provide good entry levels for exposure, but we would not go max long in an environment of rising central bank rates and falling global growth momentum.\n\nTop 3 Tips You Need to Know Before Investing in Ethereum\n\nWhere to Buy Ethereum\n\nTo buy ethereum (ETH) or any other cryptocurrency, you need access to a crypto exchange. A crypto exchange is where buyers and sellers meet to exchange money for coins, coins for other coins, and coins for money. Many options are available such as Coinbase, Binance.com, or eToro \u2013 each come with various fee structures, so research which is best for your needs.\n\nYou also need access to a crypto wallet to store ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. Many exchanges provide these, but not all do. You can also buy ethereum on platforms like Paypal and Robinhood.\n\nETH Dollar-Cost Averaging\n\nCryptocurrencies can be extremely volatile. One way to cope with the volatility is to use dollar-cost averaging. Dollar-cost averaging is a strategy where you divide the total amount you want to invest across periodic purchases of the target asset. It simply means that you would invest the same number of dollars each month or quarter, regardless of market trends.\n\nThe idea is that when prices are high, you can afford less of the asset. But when prices are low, you can afford more. When the market recovers, you benefit from having bought more shares at the lower price. Please note that using this strategy will not always result in a profit or necessarily protect you from falling prices.\n\nDiversify Your Crypto Portfolio\n\nWith the crypto landscape so volatile and diverse, managing risk in a portfolio is critical. That essentially means position sizing and diversification \u2013 as with any other kind of investment.\n\nOne of the best pieces of investment advice we have heard recently comes from Ari Paul, co-founder and CIO of Blocktower Capital, a crypto and blockchain investment firm. As Paul says,\n\n\u201cRisk is only sizing. So, if you think bitcoin is too risky, you could size it at 0.1% of your portfolio or 0.001%. Too risky is never a reason not to own an asset. If something is positive expected value, risk adjusted, and relatively low correlation, you have to own it. That\u2019s peak portfolio management 101.\u201d\n\nOne way to diversify your portfolio is with stablecoins, although these have also been very high-risk following the Terra debacle. Our recent analysis has explored how safe is tether and which stablecoins could fall next. We advise only a very small allocation to crypto and prefer diversification with more traditional asset classes.\n\nFAQs\n\n\u2192 Is now a good time to buy ethereum?\n\nFor trading ethereum over the next two to four weeks, we are neutral to bearish. That means we expect stable to falling prices. For 2022-3 in general, we think recession risks pose a risk to ETH and so now might not be the best time to buy ethereum if you have a medium-term outlook. We think ethereum is a good long-term investment for the next one to three years and are bullish overall. That means we expect prices to rise in the long term.\n\n\u2192 When was ethereum at its lowest?\n\nEthereum was the lowest in October 2016, when its price was $0.41. Since then, Ethereum has experienced several major bull runs. The first was in 2017/8 when it peaked at $1,400. It subsequently dropped to around $300-400 until the start of 2021. From January that year, bullish sentiment took the coin to over $4,000. It was not until the closing moments of 2021 that ETH breached this threshold, continuing its rise to $4,780 in November 2021. Since then, ETH price has been volatile and generally gone downwards. It is currently around $1,500.\n\n\u2192 Can you lose your money buying ETH now?\n\nAs with all investments, the value of ethereum can rise as well as fall. While it is unlikely that ethereum will suffer a complete loss of value, investors must be prepared to suffer drawdowns of between 50% and 80%. We recommend small allocations and diversification of your portfolio. Never invest what you cannot afford to lose.\n\n\u2192 When to sell ethereum?\n\nTraditional wisdom says you should buy low and sell high. But whether you should sell ethereum depends on your investment horizon, risk appetite and financial goals. Although some website speculate that certain days of the week are better or worse then others for selling ethereum, we believe that any decision to buy or sell should be based on analysis of crypto fundamentals.\n\n\u2192 Is ethereum a good investment?\n\nWe think a small allocation to ETH makes sense in the long term. However, we caution against investing in ethereum too heavily as cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile and often subject to large downturns.\n\nAppendix\n\nEthereum as a Good Inflation Hedge\n\nEthereum and bitcoin have historically been touted as a hedge for inflation. When inflation expectations rise, you would want the relationship between the cryptocurrency and inflation expectations to be at least positive. This, historically, has held. However, since February, the relationship has broken down. Inflation expectations remained anchored while ETH prices have fallen. A more hawkish Federal Reserve could weigh on ETH going forward.\n\nThe Ethereum Merge (or ETH 2.0)\n\nEthereum has been running on two different blockchains since April 2022. One operates using proof-of-work, like bitcoin. The other is a test chain what uses proof-of-stake. The merge is an upcoming event where these two blockchains will combine, ending proof-of-work. It is expected to happen in Q3/Q4 2022, and it will eliminate the energy-intensive mining required in proof-of-work. Guest author Nikhil Shamapant explains more about the ethereum merge and what it could mean for ETH price in 2023 in his recent article.\n\nDalvir Mandara is a Quantitative Researcher at Macro Hive.

        "title": "Cypherpunks, Galt's Gulch, and Bitcoin | AIER - AIER - Daily Economy News",
        "content": "In the 1990s and early 2000s, the Cypherpunks, a group of cryptographers, mathematicians, computer scientists and activists, many of whom had libertarian (or libertarian-esque) influences, worked to bring about a better world by peaceful means through mathematics and computer code. Although the identity of Bitcoin\u2019s founder remains unknown to the general public, it is widely understood that this stateless digital currency is a direct result of their work.\n\nIn 1992, Timothy C. May, a self-described crypto-anarchist and a founding member of the Cypherpunks, published an essay called \u201cLibertaria in Cyberspace.\u201d May wrote that \u201cit will be easier to form certain types of libertarian societies in cyberspace than in the real world of nations and physical locations\u201d and that \u201cthese \u2018crypto anarchy\u2019 ideas will further erode the power of physical states to tax and coerce residents.\u201d\n\nMay cited a number of key influences on the Cypherpunks, among them economists FA Hayek and David D. Friedman, as well as moral philosopher Ayn Rand. But crypto-anarchy as a political ideology was a recurring theme, and Ayn Rand was, according to May, \u201cone of the prime motivators\u201d of it. He wrote that \u201cWhat [Rand] wanted to do with material technology (mirrors over Galt\u2019s Gulch) is _much_ more easily done with mathematical technology.\u201d But the social change they sought to bring about wasn\u2019t just a passive interest. \u201cCypherpunks write code\u201d wrote Eric Hughes, another member of the group, in his \u201cCypherpunk\u2019s Manifesto.\u201d\n\nThe idea of building a crypto-anarchist Galt\u2019s Gulch in cyberspace was an intriguing idea. In 1998, Cypherpunk and computer engineer Wei Dai authored an essay explaining how a cryptographic money, which he called \u2018b-money\u2019, could work. In the very first sentence of the essay he wrote that he was \u201cfascinated by Tim May\u2019s crypto-anarchy\u201d and that in this cryptographic cyber-utopia, government was \u201cpermanently forbidden and permanently unnecessary\u201d because \u201cits participants cannot be linked to their true names or physical locations.\u201d\n\nNick Szabo, another Cypherpunk and computer scientist, described the digital Galt\u2019s Gulch as a place where \u201cyou could form your own independent community and declare your independence from corrupt institutions,\u201d a place with its own private money, where private property is protected through non-violent means, and where contracts are enforced.\n\nAs the development of a privately-issued digital currency was very much a goal of the Cypherpunks, as they were inspired in no small part by Ayn Rand, and as Rand had much to say about money, it is worth reviewing some of her writings to derive what she might have thought about Bitcoin.\n\nAnarchy\n\nAs mentioned, Cypherpunk Timothy May\u2019s vision of Galt\u2019s Gulch in cyberspace was one that he described as \u201ccrypto-anarchy.\u201d But Rand dismissed anarchy as a political system altogether, calling it \u201ca naive floating abstraction.\u201d\n\nSo while both Rand and some of the more influential Cypherpunks imagined what a freer society might look like \u2013 both appreciating free trade and voluntary interaction \u2013 they certainly would not have agreed about whether a minimal level of coercion is necessary to fund, say, courts and military. As such, if we view a private, digital currency as an essential part of the crypto-anarchist vision, it is difficult to imagine Rand\u2019s supporting it. But taking a closer look at Rand\u2019s views on property rights and money itself can provide us with a more in-depth perspective.\n\nProperty rights\n\nRand wrote that it is only through property rights that any other right can exist, and that without property rights \u201cthere is no way to solve or to avoid a hopeless chaos of clashing views, interests, demands, desires, and whims.\u201d\n\nIn Bitcoin, to know something (your private key) is essentially owning it. It is, of course, possible to entrust your private keys with a third party (an exchange, for example), but this is both entirely unnecessary and highly discouraged among bitcoiners, as captured by the \u201cNot your keys, not your bitcoins\u201d ethos. So while it is possible to seize bitcoins by coercing someone to cough up their private keys, the nature of Bitcoin\u2019s functionality forces the coercive party to go to much greater (violent) lengths to expropriate in the first place. As such, Bitcoin radically shifts the balance of power between the individual and the state, as the state cannot go door-to-door violently forcing information from people\u2019s heads without falsifying the public image it promotes for itself as a \u201cbenevolent provider of social welfare.\u201d\n\nTo take it one step further, Bitcoin\u2019s portability allows wealth to move from one corner of the earth to another in a permissionless way. It also enables property owners to physically cross borders and carry their wealth with them, as bitcoins do not occupy physical space, and the private keys can be stored in their heads.\n\nIn sum, Bitcoin serves as a radical form of property rights, and as such, it is difficult to imagine Rand\u2019s not appreciating this aspect of it.\n\nMoney\n\nWhen Rand wrote of money, she usually referred to the value of making it by creating value for others; she distinguished between money made by just means and unearned money through unjust means (e.g. through political connections). She also gave us an indication as to what kind of money she considered to be sound:\n\nMoney is the tool of men who have reached a high level of productivity and a long-range control over their lives. Money is not merely a tool of exchange: much more importantly, it is a tool of saving, which permits delayed consumption and buys time for future production. To fulfill this requirement, money has to be some material commodity which is imperishable, rare, homogeneous, easily stored, not subject to wide fluctuations of value, and always in demand among those you trade with (emphasis mine).\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that she would have appreciated Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity (with a fixed 21-million hard cap), which facilitates its store of value proposition, but would have probably been uneasy about its volatility in purchasing power.\n\nIn Atlas Shrugged, the fictional character Francisco d\u2019Anconia gave a passionate speech about money, arguing that \u201cMoney is made\u2014before it can be looted or mooched\u2014made by the effort of every honest man, each to the extent of his ability. An honest man is one who knows that he can\u2019t consume more than he has produced.\u201d Here again we reflect on Bitcoin\u2019s real scarcity, with nobody being able to produce bitcoins out of thin air to pay for political favors (a standard practice for fiat).\n\nGold is a recurring theme in Rand\u2019s work on money. In her book Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal, Alan Greenspan authors an article entitled \u201cGold and Economic Freedom.\u201d He writes: \u201cGold and economic freedom are inseparable\u2026\u201d And, \u201cDeficit spending is simply a scheme for the \u2018hidden\u2019 confiscation of wealth. Gold stands in the way of this insidious process. It stands as a protector of property rights.\u201d\n\nConclusion\n\nSo, would Rand like Bitcoin? It is difficult to know exactly. She passed away in 1982 \u2013 long before most of us had ever heard of the internet. Whatever one\u2019s view on Rand, there is no denying her strong influence on the early Cypherpunks who \u201cwrote code\u201d in a decades-long attempt to realize some cyberspace version of the laissez-faire capitalism that she boldly advocated for in real space.\n\nRand had some important things to say about money and about the morally justifiable way of earning (making) it in the first place. In fact, her views on money were so firmly held that she proudly wore a dollar sign ($) as a statement. Perhaps if she were alive today and knew the extent to which Bitcoin serves as a technical solution to the political problem of a privileged class of people that live at expense of those who produce, she might have proudly embraced Bitcoin\u2019s \u20bf symbol instead. Her ideas inspired the very individuals who set out to make something like Bitcoin a reality in the first place. I like to think that she could be proud of that.\n\nSee also: \u201cHayek and Bitcoin\u201d"

        "title": "Why Bitcoin [BTC] is due for a mid-week bullish relief, as per these findings - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Bitcoin bulls were making another attempt at taking over from the bears.\n\nWhale accumulation resumed after weeks of outflows.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] enthusiasts will be glad to know that at press time, bulls were once again fighting for dominance after prices fell towards short-term support. Multiple observations already indicated that a mid-week bullish bounce back might be on the cards.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nLet\u2019s kick off by assessing the latest on-chain data. As per Glassnode, 9 May\u2019s daily on-chain exchange flows and the net outflows outweighed the inflows. In other words, more Bitcoin is flowing out of exchanges than the amount flowing into exchanges.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s exchange flow data demonstrated a similar outcome, confirming a build-up of buying pressure. The latest data revealed that Bitcoin exchange outflow volume outweighed exchange inflow volume by slightly over 4000 BTC.\n\nAre these exchange flows enough to trigger a price pivot? Well, the answer will largely be determined by whale activity. Strong demand from whales will certainly influence market direction.\n\nAs such, it\u2019s important to look into what whales are doing.\n\nBitcoin whales make a splash\n\nBitcoin addresses holding at least 1,000 BTC have been accumulating for the last four days. This confirmed that the recent exchange outflows were backed by favorable whale activity. On the other hand, the Bitcoin Purpose ETF Holdings continued to sell.\n\nThe reason for the ETF outflows remains unclear, but it might be related to the uncertain regulatory environment in the U.S. Many crypto companies are exploring alternative options such as shifting their operations abroad and this might be discouraging institutional investors.\n\nRetail demand is also leaning on the bullish side. Last week, we saw a decline in daily active addresses to the lowest level during Monday\u2019s trading session. However, the last 24 hours were characterized by a surge in the number of active addresses. This may indicate that the market was regaining some confidence at the time of writing.\n\nThe combination of renewed retail activity backed by healthy demand from whales may lend favor to the bulls. However, these factors have not triggered a pivot in BTC\u2019s price action, at least not yet. This is likely because there is still significant sell pressure in the market.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nA look at Bitcoin\u2019s price action reveals that bullish demand was manifesting near a short-term support near the $27,000 price range.\n\nWhile the above analysis reveals the ongoing battle for dominance between the bulls and the bears, it does not necessarily guarantee a win for the bulls. The eventual outcome will ultimately depend on the level of buy or sell pressure prevailing in the market."

        "title": "MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor is proving his Bitcoin critics wrong - CityAM - City A.M.",
        "content": "MicroStrategy\u2019s Michael Saylor is proving his Bitcoin critics wrong\n\nMichael Saylor, the CEO and co-founder of Microstrategy, the Fortune 500 software company, over the weekend gave a very public \u2018told-you-so\u2019 to his critics regarding crypto.\n\nSaylor, whose company has acquired more than 140,000 Bitcoin for nearly $4.17 billion, posted a chart on Twitter showing the performance of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency since August 2020 \u2013 when MicroStrategy adopted its Bitcoin strategy \u2013 compared with the S&P 500, the Nasdaq, gold, silver and bonds.\n\nOver this period, Bitcoin is up 147%.\n\nIn comparison, the stock market index tracking the performance of 500 of the largest companies listed in the US is up 23%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq comes with 12% gains, and gold just 1%. Meanwhile, silver and bonds are down 9% and 16% respectively.\n\nIt can be reasonably assumed that Michael Saylor is now flagging-up these figures following the considerable, harsh, and often personal criticism he faced last year during the so-called \u2018crypto winter\u2019.\n\nDue to the contagion effect driven largely by the collapse of crypto unicorns, Bitcoin\u2019s value lost 70% in 2022, drawing the ire of traditional financiers and media commentators who claimed that the crypto firebrand investor was being \u201cwholly irresponsible\u201d and \u201cgambling\u201d by \u201cgoing all-in\u201d on BTC.\n\nCritics also slammed MicroStrategy\u2019s decision to borrow the money to buy the Bitcoin.\n\nBut throughout the troughs of last year and into the bull run of 2023 (it\u2019s up 55% in the first quarter alone), Saylor has publicly maintained utter confidence in the cryptocurrency.\n\nAt Bitcoin Miami in May 2022, he noted that he was \u201cmore bullish than ever on Bitcoin\u201d. He also commented on US President Joe Biden\u2019s executive order directing federal agencies to research digital currency by saying, \u201cBitcoin has been embraced. The administration has given a green light to Bitcoin. Politicians are now competing over who\u2019s the most pro-Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nDuring King Charles\u2019 coronation he Tweeted, \u201cBitcoin is King\u201d.\n\nAlso, last weekend, when legendary billionaire investors Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, Chairman and Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, were asked at a shareholders\u2019 meeting about the US government\u2019s plans to monetise the enormous levels of national debt by printing money which devalues the dollar for investors, Saylor noted \u201cBitcoin fixes this\u201d.\n\nThis underscores for many that he was right all along as the financial environment has not changed since when back in August 2020, he introduced the Bitcoin strategy for his company as a treasury hedging asset over the US dollar.\n\nBesides the critical matter of being a hedge, Saylor frequently tells his millions of social media followers about other Bitcoin fundamentals. These include that all transactions are traceable, visible, and unalterable, meaning there\u2019s a level of accountability unrivalled in traditional finance.\n\nThe crypto advocate\u2019s confidence in Bitcoin remains unshakeable and now we\u2019re in a bull market he seems keen to highlight how his faith in the cryptocurrency is paying off for MicroStrategy.\n\nYet I doubt this \u2013 or indeed anything \u2013 will be enough to convince the critics."

        "content": "Decentraland (MANA) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) are among the crypto market\u2019s best-performing coins, but there is an upcoming crypto project generating a stir in the industry \u2014 Uwerx.\n\nUwerx looks to be a project that is set to revolutionize the freelancing industry. This article will analyze the price and growth potential of all three cryptocurrencies and why you will need Uwerx in your investment portfolio in 2023.\n\nDecentraland (MANA): A New Era Of Decentralized Gaming And Socialization\n\nDecentraland (MANA) has recently gained attention for integrating with the popular gaming platform, Atari. Through this partnership, Atari has launched a casino within Decentraland (MANA) where users can play classic Atari games and win Decentraland (MANA) tokens.\n\nThe current price of Decentraland (MANA) is $0.489905, and there has been $59,801,138M worth of Decentraland (MANA) in the past 24 hours. Decentraland (MANA)\u2019s price has increased by 6.80% in the last 24 hours as well.\n\nExperts predict that the price of Decentraland (MANA) may surge to a minimum of $1.07 in Q1 2024, and its growth potential is still very high. However, some market analysts are bullish on a newly built blockchain-based project called Uwerx, which may also significantly impact the market.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) Price Prediction\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is a cryptocurrency project that broke away from Bitcoin in 2017. The project has impressive upgrades that make it faster and cheaper than Bitcoin. At the moment, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is trading at $113.56, and it is expected to potentially reach a high of $531.93 by the year 2026 as a result of the growing adoption of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) especially in countries with unstable economies.\n\nUwerx looks to be a better alternative to Bitcoin Cash (BCH), as it is an upcoming blockchain project with real-world applications.\n\nUwerx (WERX): The Future of Freelancing\n\nUwerx is a soon-to-be-launched blockchain platform that will offer instant payouts and complete transparency, all thanks to its efficient use of the fast and lightweight Polygon Network. In addition, Solidproof and InterFi Network audited this cutting-edge platform to ensure top-notch security and speed.\n\nBut Uwerx won\u2019t just be resting on its laurels. Uwerx\u2019s presale has already gained significant attention, and the WERX is priced at an affordable $0.012 in the first presale stage.\n\nExperienced traders predict that the WERX token could reach a whopping $1.20 in Q1 2024. That\u2019s 20 times more valuable than Decentraland (MANA). In addition, the project will be a force in the market as its liquidity is set to be locked for up to 25 years. The team behind Uwerx has decided to renounce contract ownership once taxes are sorted, ensuring that invested funds are not accessible to anyone.\n\nKeep your eyes on Uwerx, as it promises lots of exciting gimmicks. Don\u2019t miss out on the action by participating in the ongoing presale!\n\nClick the links to take part in the presale:\n\nPresale: invest.uwerx.network\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/uwerx_network\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/uwerx_network\n\nWebsite: https://www.uwerx.network\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Understanding how core inflation affects Bitcoin and Ethereum and how Avorak helps traders profit - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "In today\u2019s volatile financial landscape, investors are not surprised to turn to alternative assets like cryptocurrencies for stability and growth. With the rise of Bitcoin and Ethereum, understanding the impact of inflation on these digital assets has become increasingly important. We\u2019ll explore the concepts of inflation, hyperinflation, and stagflation and how they affect Bitcoin and Ethereum. Additionally, we\u2019ll discuss how Avorak AI can help traders navigate these uncertain times and profit from the ever-changing crypto markets.\n\nInflation, Hyperinflation or Stagflation?\n\nInflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services rises, and subsequently, purchasing power is falling. Central banks attempt to limit inflation and avoid deflation to keep the economy running smoothly. However, in extreme cases, inflation can lead to hyperinflation or stagflation.\n\nHyperinflation occurs when a country experiences very high and usually accelerating inflation, eroding the real value of the local currency and causing the population to minimize their holdings of the currency. This can lead to losing confidence in the currency and shifting towards alternative assets like gold or cryptocurrencies.\n\nOn the other hand, stagflation is a situation where stagnant economic growth is accompanied by high inflation and high unemployment. This can be particularly challenging for policymakers, as they must balance efforts to stimulate the economy with the need to control inflation.\n\nRegarding Bitcoin and Ethereum, both cryptocurrencies have shown potential as alternative assets during times of economic uncertainty. They offer a decentralized and secure store of value that isn\u2019t tied to the traditional financial system. This makes them particularly attractive during times of inflation, hyperinflation, or stagflation, as they can potentially maintain their value better than traditional assets like stocks or bonds.\n\nHow the FED\u2019s Interest Rate Hikes affecting Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hikes can significantly impact the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. As the central bank raises interest rates, it becomes more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow money. This can slow economic growth, negatively affecting the value of stocks and other traditional assets.\n\nAs investors seek alternative investments, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum may become more attractive. However, it\u2019s important to note that cryptocurrencies are still relatively new and untested assets. Their value can be extremely volatile, and their long-term performance during periods of economic uncertainty still needs to be determined.\n\nThat said, some analysts believe that the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies may help protect them from the negative effects of central bank policies. Unlike traditional assets, which are often tied to a specific country or economic system, cryptocurrencies operate independently of any central authority. This means that the actions of central banks like the Federal Reserve don\u2019t directly influence their value.\n\nAs a result, some investors see cryptocurrencies as a potential hedge against the negative effects of inflation and interest rate hikes. However, it\u2019s important to remember that investing in cryptocurrencies carries significant risks, and their performance during periods of economic uncertainty is far from guaranteed.\n\nAvorak AI \u2013 Navigate Uncertain Financial Waters with Ease\n\nIn the face of economic uncertainty and volatile crypto markets, it can be challenging for traders to decide which assets to invest in.

        "content": "Bitcoin stands as the largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, as it has retained dominance since its inception. In the midst of this dominance, bitcoin is being used for the development of NFTs and not only as a means of transferring value.\n\nThe CEO of Trust Machines, and co-founder of Stacks, Muneeb Ali, said at the Consensus 2023 that he was excited about the new use cases for Bitcoin coming up, especially from Q4 2022 to date. \u201cBitcoin is fun again because there\u2019s a place to build again,\u201d Muneeb added.\n\nTrust Machines is a web3 project designed to build applications and technology to unleash the true potential of Bitcoin as a final settlement layer. According to the Trust Machine, the project will expand on the success of Stacks, and build applications that make Bitcoin productive, such as trustless Bitcoin lending.\n\nStacks is an open-source blockchain with security based on the Bitcoin network, enabling DApps and smart contracts to be deployed. Its native STX token is used to process transactions and execute smart contracts.\n\nTrust Machine said that there has been massive attention given to the development and adoption of Bitcoin in Q1 2023, with projects such as Bitcoin NFTs, Bitcoin name services (BNS), and developments on the Stacks blockchain leading the way. More than 1 million Bitcoin NFTs have been minted, and there has been a 400% surge in BNS registrations since 2022.\n\nDevelopers are coming back to Bitcoin\n\nAli explained that one of the major reasons behind the resurgence of Bitcoin and redirecting its use case is the congregation of developers that are coming back to build innovative products on the first and most successful blockchain. \u201cIt\u2019s the revival of the developer culture that I\u2019m by far the most excited about,\u201d Ali said.\n\nFor the Stacks protocol, which powers applications in the Trust Machines\u2019 ecosystem, its average daily active users and addresses rose by 76% and 42%, respectively, at the end of 2022. This signified that more users were interested in what was happening in the Bitcoin space. In addition, Stacks revealed it will launch Stacks Bitcoin (sBTC) to make Bitcoin a programmable protocol.\n\nTrust Machines also hinted that part of the surge in the attention given to Bitcoin is due to the launch of Nostr by Jack Dorsey, the former CEO of Twitter and CEO of Bluesky.\n\nRead also;\n\nBitcoin beat gold, NASDAQ in Q1 2023\n\n\u201cDeliver value!\u201d Warner Music exec\u2019s advice to Web3 creators"

        "content": "Binance NFT Adds Support for Bitcoin Ordinals: Expanding the World of NFTs\n\nBinance NFT is expanding the possibilities for creators, collectors, and enthusiasts and unlocking a new level of creativity and value in digital assets by adding support for Bitcoin Ordinals.\n\nIn the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have taken center stage as one of the most exciting and innovative use cases of this technology. NFTs allow creators to tokenize their unique digital assets, from artwork to music and beyond, making them verifiably rare and valuable. Binance NFT, the official NFT marketplace of Binance, has been at the forefront of this movement, offering users an all-encompassing platform for NFT enthusiasts and collectors.\n\nBinance NFT is taking its offerings to the next level by supporting Bitcoin Ordinals, a groundbreaking new way of creating Bitcoin NFTs. Bitcoin Ordinals were launched earlier this year and allowed for individual satoshis, the smallest denomination of Bitcoin, to be identified and transacted with extra data attached through a process called inscription. This additional data can include text, images, videos, or other content, creating a new level of uniqueness and rarity for Bitcoin NFTs.\n\nBy embracing Bitcoin Ordinals, Binance NFT is expanding the scope of its ecosystem and offering even more opportunities for NFT collectors and creators. With integrations already in place with a range of networks, including BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Polygon, Binance NFT is one of the most versatile and accessible NFT marketplaces available, with a wide variety of valuable collectibles easily accessible to Binance\u2019s user base of over 90 million users.\n\nWith Bitcoin Ordinals, creators can now tokenize their Bitcoin holdings and add unique data to each satoshi, unlocking a new level of creativity and value. In addition, Binance users can purchase and trade Bitcoin NFTs directly with their Binance accounts, eliminating the need for a separate wallet supporting inscriptions. This integration offers even more seamless and efficient trading for Binance users, with the protection of Binance\u2019s exceptional security.\n\nMayur Kamat, Head of Product at Binance, expressed excitement about adding Bitcoin Ordinals to the Binance NFT marketplace: \u201cWe want to bring the broadest choice to our users. Bitcoin is the OG of crypto. We are super excited to bring Bitcoin Ordinals to Binance NFT. We believe things are getting started here.\n\nBut more than just collectors and creators will benefit from this integration. Binance also offers royalty support and additional revenue-generating opportunities for Bitcoin NFT creators, opening up new possibilities for monetization and sustainability. And for those interested in exploring a collaboration with Binance NFT, the platform is actively seeking partnerships and alliances.\n\nTo celebrate this new integration, Binance invites users to participate in a special registration event, offering exclusive benefits using a Binance survey form. In addition, users can stay informed on the latest updates by submitting feedback and registering using the state, including airdrop and whitelist opportunities."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has experienced a significant dip as the United States government allegedly sold 9,800 Bitcoin (BTC) worth $277 million, per certain reports. The US government seized the Bitcoin in question during the Silkroad case, as reported by Whale Wire on Twitter.\n\nBitcoin Investors Brace For Impact\n\nThe US government\u2019s alleged sale of such a large amount of Bitcoin caused a ripple effect in the market, with prices dropping in minutes. This is not the first time there have been reports that the US government has sold BTC, but it could be one of the largest sales.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent rollercoaster ride has had investors holding on tight. After reaching the $28,000 level post-CPI report by the Federal Reserve (Fed), the news of the US government selling a whopping $277 million worth of Bitcoin caused a dip in the market.\n\nOther parties, including independent analysts and research firms CryptoQuant and Arkham, have contested the transaction. Large Bitcoin transactions associated with the U.S. government caused controversy in the past. Similar to today\u2019s price action, the news triggered fear and uncertainty among investors.\n\nIn that sense, the news should be taken with a grain of salt. According to a pseudonym analyst:\n\n38 minutes ago, a large 9,800 $BTC transaction, valued at $264 million, was rumored to be sent from a US Government-controlled wallet. As a result, BTC\u2019s price fell by 5.3%. However, after examining the origin of the funds and receiving confirmation from Arkham, there is no\u2026 pic.twitter.com/uT9uVHpGQ2 \u2014 An Ape\u2019s Prologue (@apes_prologue) May 10, 2023\n\nThis led to a 0.7% retracement and a drop to $26,800. But, like a phoenix rising from the ashes, Bitcoin bounced back and climbed above the 50-day moving average support at $27,200.\n\nDespite this, according to Whale Wire, even if the US government sold, it still owns over 200,000 BTC; prices could drop under $10,000 instantly if they were to sell that amount. This has raised questions about the government\u2019s intentions regarding their BTC holdings and whether they will continue selling them in large quantities.\n\nThe US government also allegedly sold 9,800 Bitcoin on March 14th, seized from criminals involved in illegal activities on the Silk Road website. At the time of the auction, the price of Bitcoin was approximately $26,000 and valued at approximately $215 million.\n\nAccording to a court filing, The US Government plans to sell another 31,700 BTC in connection with Silk Road. This online marketplace facilitated illegal activities and was seized by law enforcement agencies in 2013. However, It remains to be seen if these events will delay the Bitcoin bull run and further drop BTC\u2019s price to new lower lows.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com"

        "title": "Market sentiment and bitcoin price - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Over the weekend, the price of Bitcoin fell back below $30,000, fueling traders\u2019 fears of a bearish continuation in the coming months.\n\nMarket sentiment is now caught between fears of a prolonged bear market and confidence in a resumption of the bull phase.\n\nLet us analyse the situation together.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin and digital asset flows\n\nThe price of bitcoin fell sharply over the weekend after Binance temporarily suspended BTC withdrawals to its users due to heavy network congestion, mainly caused by a disproportionate increase in transactions on the Ordinals protocol.\n\nMeanwhile, digital asset investment products saw outflows of $53.7 million, marking the third consecutive week of negative sentiment for this type of asset.\n\nHowever, if we look at the data since the beginning of the year, we see that values are still positive by $19 million in an overall picture in which \u201cProshares ETFs/USA\u201d and \u201cETC Issuance GmbH\u201d lead the way with market flows of $181.6 million and $88.4 million respectively.\n\nThe worst performer appears to be 3iQ Corp/Canada, with weekly outflows of $19.4m and YTD outflows of $207.7m.\n\nIn total, assets under management in these investment funds stand at $34.23 billion, while trading volumes are 16% higher than at the start of the year.\n\nLooking in more detail, bitcoin was once again the asset most targeted by investors in this type of regulated product, with outflows of $31.8 million last week and a total of $46 million since the beginning of the year.\n\nIn this context, Bitcoin accounts for $22.74 billion or 66% of all money invested in the asset class.\n\nAlthough the outlook does not look the best at first glance, sentiment in the US has turned positive with inflows of $18 million and the largest outflow in history for \u201cshort-Bitcoin\u201d products of $23.1 million.\n\nIn other words, investors are unwinding their bets on future declines in the price of BTC.\n\nEthereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap for the week, saw smaller outflows of $2.3 million out of a total of $7.86 billion managed by savings funds.\n\nThe only altcoin to see positive flows was Solana with $3.4 million, but this was a negligible amount.\n\nHow to analyse crypto market sentiment\n\nThe price of Bitcoin moves according to several conflicting variables and logics, one of which is undoubtedly market sentiment.\n\nThere are several ways to analyse the sentiment of the crypto market, apart from monitoring the money flows of digital asset investment products managed by providers listed on traditional markets.\n\nFirstly, if you want to get in touch with the short-term sentiment of investors, you can take a look at the \u201cFear and Greed Index\u201c, which shows the confidence of investors in the crypto market on a scale of 0 to 100.\n\nExtremely high levels are usually a good time to sell and take profits, while fear in the sector, with the index in the red, could be an opportunity to buy at a discount.\n\nThe situation seems neutral at the moment, in line with the analysis in the previous paragraph,\n\nIt is important to remember that this type of indicator has a 24-hour lag.\n\nAnother way to analyse market sentiment is to look at changes in open interest in the futures markets by relating this data to the price of bitcoin.\n\nOpen interest represents the number of derivative contracts that have not yet been closed, given by the sum of the long and short open positions at a given point in time: this data is extremely important because it helps us to understand the interest of financial traders in staying in the market rather than choosing other investment venues.\n\nThe main futures brokers are Binance, Bybit, OKX, CME, Deribit and Bitmex.\n\nCurrently, total open interest on all exchanges stands at $10 billion, about 30% higher than at the beginning of the year, but about 15% lower than in mid-April.\n\nIf total open interest were to exceed $15 billion, we would have another reason to be bullish on the immediate future of this market.\n\nThe last way, perhaps the most spartan, but also the most effective way to understand market sentiment for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is to observe the reaction of investors on Twitter in relation to market price movements.\n\nBy first doing the work of selecting the most crypto-friendly profiles and having a follower base of at least 20,000, it is possible to understand in real time what investors are thinking.\n\nTypically, markets move in the opposite direction to the expectations of the masses, so by spending time analysing tweets and comments, we can easily understand which scenarios are preferred by the Twitter audience and get them to choose exactly the opposite direction.\n\nTechnical analysis of the price of bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is currently trading at $27,537 with a market cap of $533 billion and a volume of $13.4 billion over the last 24 hours.\n\nThe situation on the technical analysis front is at a point of maximum indecision, which is somewhat reflected in the trader sentiment analysis, which is caught between bullish and bearish views.\n\nIn the daily time frame, prices have fallen below the 60-period moving average, marking the fifth consecutive daily candle in the red (not yet completed).\n\nIf there is a dip below the support level of 27,000 dollars, we could see a sharp decline, at least to 24,000 dollars in the short term.\n\nThis is the most likely hypothesis at the moment, given the bearish divergence that has formed on the Relative Strength Index (RSI).\n\nVolumes are still low and there are no signs of a rebound that would contradict the bearish continuation theory in the short term.\n\nFurthermore, after the rally in the crypto market in Q1 2023, it seems logical to see a situation where traders take profits on their still open positions.\n\nDaily Bitcoin price chart (BTC/USD)\n\nOn larger timeframes (weekly and monthly), the situation does not look so dire and the bull/bear conflicts may resolve themselves in a period of stability and laterality in BTC prices.\n\nWhile we wait for the next macroeconomic data on US inflation and see how the issue of the Bitcoin mempool being clogged by BRC-20 token transactions will be resolved, the best choice to make right now is probably to be patient and wait for the next BTC price movements.\n\nA small curiosity at the end of the article: the Ethereum Foundation has started to sell some ETH: every time this has happened in previous years, this event has marked a small peak in crypto market prices.\n\nBe careful traders!"

So, is the platform a scam or is it legit? Here, we analyze the key features as well as the pros and cons of using the automated trading tool so that you can decide whether or not it is a good platform to use.\n\nBitcoin Sprint Review Summary\n\nBitcoin Sprint is a unique offering that claims to automate the crypto trading experience for its users. The trading software leverages the concepts of AI and unique trading consensus to scout the current market for opportunities in BTC, among other top altcoins. Once the Bitcoin robot finds a possible entry into the platform, it sends trade signals or executes the transaction (based on the preferred settings).\n\nInterestingly, the platform isn\u2019t limited to sending signals or automating trading for its users. Once signed up, users can leverage different functions like a demo trading account to learn and strategize the possible trade entries. Bitcoin Sprint has also earned a name for itself due to its zero fees structure. The website claims to charge no additional fees or taxes from its users. However, to get started, you must first fund your account with $250.\n\nNow that we have a clear idea of the basics of the platform, here\u2019s an overview table that summarizes the essential features of Bitcoin Sprint:\n\nType Of Trading Cryptocurrencies Success Rate Unknown Available Cryptocurrencies BTC, ETH, ADA, and XRP, among others Accessible Over Mobile No (Accessible over browser) Withdrawal Or Deposit Fees Zero Customer Support Live Chat & Email Withdrawal Time Limit Up to 24 hours Minimum Deposit $250\n\nCryptocurrencies are unregulated; beware of brokers who aren\u2019t regulated or don\u2019t qualify for investor protection.\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin Sprint?\n\nBitcoin Sprint is a new trading platform that specializes in trading BTC. As per its website, Bitcoin Sprint is a general trading platform that simplifies the process of Bitcoin (among other altcoins) trading in a more engaging and informed manner.\n\nThis new-age trading platform claims to leverage one of the most advanced aspects of technology to develop this reliable trading ecosystem. The website further says it combines cumulative experiences and knowledge from a group of experts and puts them on its platform. This way, the platform supports trading with the help of real-time insights.\n\nAccording to our research on the bitcoin trading platform, Bitcoin Sprint is an automated trading platform built for the cryptocurrency market. The software caters to investors and traders at different stages of their learning curve, making it a potential trading tool for users at all levels.\n\nThe core USP of Bitcoin Sprint revolves around its unique trading algorithms. The platform claims to leverage the concepts of AI, and a unique consensus algorithm tracks different opportunities in the market. The automated Bitcoin trading software works on identifying BTC and other altcoins, such as Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Ethereum Classic (ETC), and Cardano (ADA), at a discounted rate and provides trade signals to its users.\n\nThis unique functionality of the Bitcoin Sprint online trading platform saves traders the time they would\u2019ve spent manually scouting the market for opportunities, researching trades, or studying different market movements. Instead, according to its website, Bitcoin Sprint offers an automated experience where traders can sit back and relax whilst the platform finds a profitable entry for BTC and other altcoins.\n\nWhat\u2019s more? The platform also goes a step ahead to claim that Bitcoin Sprint can also automate trades when allowed to execute them on behalf of traders. Other platform features comprise a demo trading feature, different analysis tools, and seamless security and regulation.\n\nBesides, while Bitcoin Sprint mentions its automated trading features, the website does not make any claims about its algorithm\u2019s profitability or past success rate. Another claim Bitcoin Sprint makes is that its trading platform is free to use. The website claims that traders won\u2019t need to pay any account fees or trade commissions and have 100% claim over their profits.\n\nTo summarize, Bitcoin Sprint is a unique trading opportunity that delivers profits. However, as with other auto trading platforms, Bitcoin Sprint is very transparent about the information released on its platform and how the algorithm works. As a result, upon our research of the automated Bitcoin trading platform, we could not determine the success rate of its trades or other related claims.\n\nTherefore, we recommend interested traders carefully read and analyze the terms and conditions laid by the platform before signing up or investing in it.\n\nCryptocurrencies are unregulated; beware of brokers who aren\u2019t regulated or don\u2019t qualify for investor protection.\n\nBitcoin Sprint Pros and Cons\n\nLike every platform, even Bitcoin Sprint has its own pros and cons. Check out our table on the different pros and cons that define the software before deciding whether or not to sign up:\n\n\u2705 Pros The platform supports multi-asset crypto trading\n\nThe platform supports multi-asset crypto trading Offers demo trading feature for beginner users\n\nOffers demo trading feature for beginner users No additional fees in the form of charges or taxes\n\nNo additional fees in the form of charges or taxes Straightforward UI that adds to its appeal \u274c Cons Bitcoin Sprint shares no information on the owners\n\nBitcoin Sprint shares no information on the owners The platform charges a minimum of $250 to get started Bitcoin Sprint Key Features\n\nWhen discussing an online trading platform, it\u2019s crucial to analyze and inspect other elements of its operations.

These resources will help traders at different stages understand the industry\u2019s basics and advanced aspects while staying updated with the latest activities in Bitcoin trading.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f General Trading Platform\n\nAnother unique aspect of signing up for the Bitcoin Sprint is access to its general trading platform. The automated Bitcoin trading software tool is unlike other market options that limit its users in terms of possible operations over the platform.\n\nAs the name suggests, this option doesn\u2019t limit you in terms of possible trading options. Instead, investors and traders can diversify their portfolios by putting their money in investment opportunities other than cryptos.\n\nNo matter your experience in the crypto industry, you can\u2019t overlook the significance of having the right analysis tools at your disposal. Using different sets of analysis tools allows investors and traders to understand the future possibilities in the market better. Moreover, advanced trading tools can help advanced traders make the most of a volatile market.\n\nBut using these advanced tools isn\u2019t very affordable. Most of these tools generally come with high subscription fees. Interestingly, this is where the Bitcoin Sprint comes in as a platform that provides access to these analysis tools at no additional cost. Once signed up, users can easily leverage these tools to execute their trade strategy and earn better profits.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Customer Service\n\nCustomer service is another crucial aspect of a crypto trading app, especially if it involves beginner traders and investors. Given their idea of the industry, beginner traders often need help executing their trades. This is where prompt customer services helps such users execute their trades seamlessly without losing their money.\n\nInterestingly, things are the same for users over Bitcoin Script. The platform offers prompt customer service, where all you need to do is fill out a form, and representatives reach back to you, resolving the queries of its users in real time. This way, users are also saved from the potential losses that they might have if customer service wasn\u2019t there to help them.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Demo account\n\nAs the name suggests, a demo account is a trading setup that allows traders to execute their trades under simulated market conditions. Any trader taking their trading seriously will tell you that the demo platform is the best feature for beginner traders. Here, users can execute new strategies without risking their money.\n\nOnce signed up over Bitcoin Sprint, you can use the demo account feature over a few clicks. Here, users are allowed to put their demo money on real-time market movements and understand whether or not there\u2019s a possibility of success in their trade.\n\nThis way, beginner traders learn about the market conditions\u2019 volatility. Interestingly, the demo account feature isn\u2019t only limited to beginner users. The option is also open for seasoned investors who want to sharpen their trading techniques and increase their chances of making profitable deals.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Security & Regulation\n\nSecurity and regulations of a crypto exchange are among the primary concerns for crypto traders of all sizes. Unfortunately, thanks to the industry\u2019s success, cryptocurrencies have been a hot spot for new traders and con artists. Over the years, millions of cryptos have been swept off major exchanges, individual investors, and day traders using different creative methods.\n\nAll these factors have made security a leading factor that makes or breaks any cryptocurrency. Thankfully, Bitcoin Sprint is different! The platform claims to incorporate foolproof systems that ensure users\u2019 funds and data security. Moreover, the website also claims that it continually implements strong encryptions and leverages global data protection considerations and measures for the safety of its users.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Bitcoin Sprint Registration Process\n\nNext, we have the registration and sign-up process over the Bitcoin Sprint online trading platform. Different from other trading platforms that make it challenging for users to sign up over their platform, things are different over Bitcoin Sprint. First, the platform streamlines the sign-up experience for its users by limiting the number of steps required in the process.\n\nOnce you log into their website, starting over on this Bitcoin trading platform is as effortless as filling out a form and waiting for a short period while the system verifies your details. This concise log-in approach over the Bitcoin Sprint application allows investors and traders to enter profitable trades quickly.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f User Interface\n\nThe intuitive design of the Bitcoin Sprint platform is another major highlight of the Bitcoin robot. The platform is designed keeping in mind users of every type. It has an easily comprehensible UI that even beginner users can follow without additional help.\n\nWhat\u2019s more? The user-friendly interface also makes it easy for traders and investors to add funds, enter, and execute profitable trades without causing confusion. The platform has all the necessary features listed on its dashboard. Besides, every additional feature is only a few steps away.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Asset Availability\n\nThe availability of assets is a crucial factor for almost every investor. After a point when they\u2019re done investing in a limited set of cryptocurrencies, investors want to explore their options with different types of assets as a means to balance their portfolio.\n\nInterestingly, if you\u2019re an investor looking to grow your portfolio beyond Bitcoin, Bitcoin Sprint still has you covered. The platform allows users to trade in coins like Ethereum, Dash, Bitcoin Cash, Binance Coin, and Litecoin. This way, by allowing investors to deal with a wider range of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin Sprint provides them with equal opportunities to expand their portfolio and earn more profits.\n\nCryptocurrencies are unregulated; beware of brokers who aren\u2019t regulated or don\u2019t qualify for investor protection.\n\nBitcoin Sprint Fees\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the Bitcoin Sprint trading platform claims to charge no additional trading fees from any of its users. Unlike other trading platforms that charge users in the form of commissions, withdrawal fees, or spreads, Bitcoin Sprint claims not to charge any form of additional fees on the profits of its users.\n\nHere\u2019s an overview of the possible charges charged by any Bitcoin robot trading platform:\n\nAccount Fees None Trading Fees None Commission No commission Withdrawal/Deposit Fees No fees\n\nHowever, it should be noted that while there are no fees over the platform, Bitcoin Sprint charges a minimum deposit fee of $250 from all its users.\n\nTalking of the minimum deposit, Bitcoin Sprint has a similar requirement to many other Bitcoin robots in the market. However, we suggest potential investors and traders carefully consider all the risks involved in trading using such a platform before making the initial deposit.\n\nIs Bitcoin Spirit Available On Mobile?\n\nThe Bitcoin Sprint platform is developed to foster a budding community of investors and traders. The platform understands the need for flexibility among new-age investors. Keeping the same in mind, Bitcoin Sprint is spread across platforms like:\n\nMobile phones via online browsing\n\nLaptops & desktops\n\niPads and other tablets\n\nThis way, Bitcoin Sprint allows users to tap sign up for a 360-degree trading experience. Once signed up, traders can earn profits on the move by trading on the mobile trading app.\n\nCryptocurrencies are unregulated; beware of brokers who aren\u2019t regulated or don\u2019t qualify for investor protection.\n\nBitcoin Sprint Account Types\n\nThe Bitcoin Sprint trading platform is designed to keep investors and traders of every type in mind. Keeping the same approach in mind, the platform offers numerous types of accounts for the convenience of its users.\n\nOnce signed up, you\u2019ll find multiple account types, namely:\n\nDemo trading\n\nAs explored earlier, the demo trading account allows users to participate in simulated live trades using demo funds. This way, they get an idea of the market\u2019s volatility while giving advanced users a practical idea of whether or not their strategy would be successful.\n\nManual trading\n\nNext, we have manual trading, an option available when you log into the active platform over the Bitcoin Sprint online trading platform. As is evident from the name, the user decides whether or not they want to execute a trade in the manual trading feature.\n\nUsers signing up for the manual trading approach can utilise signals from Bitcoin Sprint to maximise their profits. However, this option puts them at equal chances of suffering a loss.\n\nAutomatic trading\n\nThe automatic trading feature is the last option on our list of Bitcoin Sprint account types. As evident from the name, the automated trading account can enter and execute trades without taking consent from the users.\n\nAdditionally, this option allows traders of all types of experience to be a part of the market and earn profits by allowing the Bitcoin robot to make trade-related judgments. However, it should be noted that choosing the automatic trading option takes away the user\u2019s right to exit a trade (unless they default the settings).\n\nTherefore, if we look at it, there\u2019s a lot of difference between trading decisions made manually and automatically. Choosing a manual method means utilising the user\u2019s judgement, skill, and trading experience. On the contrary, the automated mode enables users to decide based on their preferences and criteria.\n\nIn this mode, consumers are prompted to choose from several factors, and the mode subsequently bases trading choices on those parameters. This allows the Bitcoin robot to enter a trade once it fulfils the parameters set by users.\n\nCryptocurrencies are unregulated; beware of brokers who aren\u2019t regulated or don\u2019t qualify for investor protection.\n\nIs Bitcoin Sprint A Trading Bot?\n\nLooking at the different aspects of the platform and after reading an overview of the tool from its website, it\u2019s evident that Bitcoin Sprint is a trading robot.\n\nIs Bitcoin Sprint Legit?\n\nThe crypto industry is an active spot for scammers, known to almost everybody in 2024. However, many beginners must realize that these hackers and con artists have evolved in their game. Today, instead of attacking crypto wallets and scamming people directly, they create fake websites and trading bots to loot people for their money.\n\nKeeping the same in mind, we tried analyzing different aspects of the Bitcoin Sprint online trading platform. According to its website, Bitcoin Sprint allows traders to identify unique opportunities in the crypto market by leveraging algorithm-driven trade signals. Investors and traders can automatically or manually use these signals to earn profits.\n\nHowever, upon further research, we found little information about the team or owner behind the trading bot. While this is common among several automated Bitcoin robots, it is a red flag. Additionally, the platform must have active social media handles across significant platforms like Instagram or Twitter, raising another concern.\n\nWhat\u2019s more? We also couldn\u2019t find any reviews rating the platform\u2019s services across the internet, which limited our ability to analyze its authenticity. On the contrary, however, we found several blogs and articles confirming that the platform offers features like customer support and demo accounts.\n\nOverall, there\u2019s no solid proof of whether Bitcoin Sprint is genuine or fake. Therefore, we advise investors and traders to exercise caution while signing up for the platform.\n\nCryptocurrencies are unregulated; beware of brokers who aren\u2019t regulated or don\u2019t qualify for investor protection.\n\nHow To Use Bitcoin Sprint In 2024\n\nBitcoin Sprint happens to be one of the most appealing automated trading software in its genre. Thanks to its appeal, many investors and traders sign up for the platform. Interestingly, the platform allows all its users to choose whether they want to trade on the platform or opt for a more traditional way via a broker.\n\nHere\u2019s an overview of the different steps involved in the sign-up process for Bitcoin Sprint. Continue reading as we walk you through the additional steps involved in the process:\n\nStep 1: Create an account\n\nTo get started, you first need to visit the Bitcoin Sprint platform. Here, the website greets you with a dialogue box that asks you to sign up for the platform. Once on the page, enter your first name, last name, email address, and phone number. After successfully adding the data, click \u2018Learn More\u2019 to proceed with the registration process.\n\nStep 2: Complete phone call verification\n\nYou must complete the \u201cKnow Your Client\u201d regulations and rules upon completing the registration process. Here, the company will call and ask applicants questions (related to the user\u2019s ID). Upon completing the process, you will be verified and free to start.\n\nStep 3: Deposit funds\n\nIn the third step, you must start depositing funds into your account. As mentioned, Bitcoin Sprint requires users to deposit a minimum balance of $250 to use the platform. Users can deposit these funds using debit or credit cards and e-wallets such as Skrill and PayPal.\n\nStep 4: Use Educational Materials To Learn About Trading\n\nNow that you\u2019re done with all the basics and ready to trade, we suggest using the educational materials on the platform to learn about the market\u2019s volatility and different trading strategies.\n\nInterestingly, since Bitcoin Sprint allows a demo trading feature, users can practise strategies or understand trading in real-market conditions.\n\nStep 5: Start placing live trades\n\nAfter you\u2019ve successfully understood the market conditions. Use the Bitcoin Sprint online trading platform to start placing live trades and earning profits.\n\nCryptocurrencies are unregulated; beware of brokers who aren\u2019t regulated or don\u2019t qualify for investor protection.\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Sprint Improve Your Trading?\n\nAccording to its website, Bitcoin Sprint is an automated trading software that leverages the concepts of AI and a trading consensus to allow users to get into profitable trades. The platform scouts for potential trading opportunities among BTC and other top-performing altcoins. Once done, it sends trade signals to its users.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not all. The Bitcoin trading platform claims that it can do more than issue trade signals. As per its website, Bitcoin Sprint can automatically execute trades on behalf of its users once the trading criteria are met. The Bitcoin robot enters and executes a trade using the funds and returns the same with the surplus at the end of every trade.\n\nGiven the uncertainty of trading using automated software, it\u2019s wise to follow a few tips to trade successfully. So the next time you set up a trade, ensure that you\u2019re following these tips to ensure safety:\n\nNever give withdrawal access to your software\n\nIt\u2019s usually a thumb rule to deny any form of access to your automated software when funds are involved. Similarly, it\u2019s wise not to provide your Bitcoin robot authorisation to withdraw funds from your account.\n\nSimilarly, it also helps to check any additional fees or taxes the platform charges. Finally, remember it\u2019s wise to restrict your trading software from accessing your funds or bank accounts.\n\nAnalyse the credibility of the platform\n\nIt is crucial to conduct thorough research on any program you want to use, and you should wait to buy the first trading bot you come across. Likewise, anybody could develop these tools, and for them to work, they would require access to your exchange account. As a result, reputation is crucial when choosing a reliable crypto trading bot.\n\nTherefore, it\u2019s wise to assess the product\u2019s reputation in the market and within the crypto trading community to ascertain how well-liked it is to decide whether it is reliable, efficient, and trustworthy.\n\nExpect losses in your trading journey\n\nAutomating trading is different from guaranteed gains. Therefore, before signing up for any such Bitcoin robot, users must understand that no software or platform guarantees complete profits.\n\nEven automated software tends to lose money. Here, the best approach is to opt for larger gains more frequently. Besides, don\u2019t be of the losses while you\u2019re at it. However, when trading using an automated program, be mindful of the trades and the profit.\n\nDon\u2019t go all-in\n\nBefore you stake the entire funds in your bank account on automated trading software, ensure that you are confident in the software. Being an automated Bitcoin robot, these platforms don\u2019t seek permissions while executing and settling trades that can be profitable or bear losses.\n\nBesides, even if you are an experienced trader, trading a percentage of your available money or the minimum funds required to get started may be a good idea. Once you\u2019re confident about the potential of your chosen software in making profits, you might consider increasing the size of funds.\n\nBeware of the market\u2019s volatility\n\nThe crypto market is known for its volatility, giving it the potential to increase or decrease the value of your investments by up to 50x at a time. When these fast changes appear, modifying your bot to suit the changes is challenging. This ultimately adds to the risk of losing your funds in the process.\n\nSo don\u2019t completely trust your automated software when entering and settling trades in the long term. When dealing with Bitcoin robots, it\u2019s only wise to keep an eye on the market at regular intervals.\n\nBitcoin Sprint Full Review 2024 \u2013 Conclusion\n\nThis brings us to the end of our blog on the Bitcoin Sprint online trading platform. Based on our research of the platform, we found minimal data to support the claims made on its website. Additionally, there\u2019s a lack of testimonials and an inadequate social media presence of the software.\n\nTherefore, we advise readers to invest only once they have a sound idea of the platform and its type of investment.\n\nCryptocurrencies are unregulated; beware of brokers who aren\u2019t regulated or don\u2019t qualify for investor protection.\n\nFAQs"
