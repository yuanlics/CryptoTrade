        "title": "Tether to Further Strengthen Reserves Through Purchase of Bitcoin with Realized Net Operating Profits - Tether USD",
        "content": "17 May 2023 - Tether International Limited (Tether), the company managing the reserves of the first and most widely used stablecoin, announced today its latest investment strategy aimed at further strengthening its reserves portfolio.\n\nStarting this month, Tether will regularly allocate up to 15% of its net realized operating profits towards purchasing Bitcoin (BTC). Tether anticipates that the current and future BTC holdings in its reserves will not exceed the Shareholder Capital Cushion and will further strengthen and diversify the reserves. As reflected in Tether\u2019s Q1 2023 Assurance Report, as of the end of March 2023, Tether already held approximately $1.5 billion in BTC in its reserves. While it is common practice among many institutional investors to third-party custody their Bitcoin, Tether believes in the philosophy \"Not your keys, not your bitcoin\" and takes possession of the private keys associated with all of its Bitcoin holdings.\n\nUnder this new approach, Tether will focus exclusively on utilizing realized profits from its investment strategy, disregarding unrealized capital gains generated by price increases. This means that Tether will consider only the tangible gains from its operations, which consist of the difference, between purchase price and net proceeds from the sale or, in case of a maturing investment, between the purchase price and the reimbursed amount (for example the notional amount for a zero coupon investment like with U.S. treasury bills).\n\nTether\u2019s purchase of BTC is part of its conservative and prudent approach to investment decisions aimed at strengthening, increasing and diversifying its reserves. By implementing this framework, Tether aims to enhance transparency and provide a clearer view of the company's performance and capital allocation strategy.\n\n\"The decision to invest in Bitcoin, the world's first and largest cryptocurrency, is underpinned by its strength and potential as an investment asset,\u201d said Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Tether. \u201cBitcoin has continually proven its resilience and has emerged as a long-term store of value with substantial growth potential. Its limited supply, decentralized nature, and widespread adoption have positioned Bitcoin as a favored choice among institutional and retail investors alike. Our investment in Bitcoin is not only a way to enhance the performance of our portfolio, but it is also a method of aligning ourselves with a transformative technology that has the potential to reshape the way we conduct business and live our lives.\u201d\n\nTether believes that Bitcoin has demonstrated its investment potential with a track record of impressive returns over the past decade. Its performance, combined with increasing recognition and adoption by major financial institutions, has cemented Bitcoin's position as a key component in diversified investment portfolios.\n\nBy incorporating Bitcoin into its investment strategy, Tether aims to capitalize on the digital asset's potential growth, while leveraging its position as a trusted and reliable financial infrastructure provider. Tether's decision to allocate a portion of its net realized operating profits towards Bitcoin highlights the company's confidence in the cryptocurrency market and its belief in supporting the broader ecosystem.\n\nAmong other smaller investments performed with its own capital, Tether Group is focusing on building communication (through peer-to-peer technologies like Holepunch), energy and bitcoin mining infrastructure\n\nTether will continue to adhere to stringent risk management practices to ensure the stability and security of its operations. The company remains steadfast in its commitment to maintaining the stability of its flagship stablecoin, Tether (USD\u20ae), while exploring innovative opportunities in the ever-evolving digital asset landscape."

        "content": "A picture taken in London shows gold-plated souvenir cryptocurrency tether, bitcoin and ethereum coins arranged beside a screen displaying a trading chart, May 8, 2022.\n\nCryptocurrency giant Tether on Wednesday said that it's going to purchase hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of bitcoin to back the world's largest stablecoin.\n\nThe company said it would invest 15% of its net profit into bitcoin to \"diversify\" the reserves that back its USDT token, which aims to stick to a 1-to-1 peg to the U.S. dollar.\n\nThat would amount to roughly $222 million, based on the company's last attestation report, which provides a breakdown of the assets that make up its USDT reserves as well as excess reserves and profits.\n\nA Tether spokesperson clarified the bitcoin it purchases would amount to only a small portion of its overall net profit, with the bulk of excess income being spent on running the business, including bank fees.\n\n\"The aim is to keep the Bitcoin portfolio value well below the size of our total excess reserves that accounted for 2.48B at the end of Q1/2023, while bitcoin holdings accounted for 1.5B,\" the Tether spokesperson said.\n\nUSDT is the largest stablecoin in the market, with a circulating supply of more than $82.8 billion, according to CoinGecko data. It competes with Circle's USD Coin and Binance's BUSD.\n\nStablecoins are used by traders to move in and out of different cryptocurrencies without converting money back into fiat currencies.\n\n\"The decision to invest in Bitcoin, the world's first and largest cryptocurrency, is underpinned by its strength and potential as an investment asset,\" Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino said in a statement.\n\n\"Bitcoin has continually proven its resilience and has emerged as a long-term store of value with substantial growth potential. Its limited supply, decentralized nature, and widespread adoption have positioned Bitcoin as a favored choice among institutional and retail investors alike.\"\n\nThe move would make Tether an even bigger holder of bitcoin \u2014 the firm already holds over $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin on its balance sheet \u2014 and follows moves from notable investors like Paul Tudor Jones and MicroStrategy boss Michael Saylor to accumulate huge stockpiles, in the belief that the token is immune to the effects of currency depreciation and inflation.\n\nAnalysts and investors have previously told CNBC that bitcoin could get a boost this year due to the influence of so-called \"whales\" \u2014 market players with significant financial firepower, which enables them to buy up huge sums of tokens.\n\nTether's methods to maintain a $1 value for its token have drawn controversy in the past because of concerns over the quality of its reserve assets. Previously, the company held a great deal of its reserves in commercial paper \u2014 a form of short-term, unsecured debt issued by companies. This is seen as less safer than other forms of debt, such as U.S. Treasury bills.\n\nTether sought to allay investor fears by rotating out of commercial paper and replacing these fund holdings with only U.S. government debt securities.\n\nIn February, the company said it had whittled down its commercial paper holdings to zero.\n\nUSDT and its issuer remain a source of contention in the crypto market. The U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly investigating executives at Tether over possible bank fraud.\n\nStablecoins were already a hot-button issue for regulators, who have been scrambling to figure out how to keep the industry in check after the demise of several notable firms in the space."

        "title": "Exploring the benefits of holding Bitcoin for long-term investment - The Daily Progress",
        "content": "In today's fast-paced and ever-changing world, achieving financial freedom is a dream that many aspire to. With the rise of digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, a new investment strategy has emerged: holding Bitcoin for the long term. This article will explore why holding Bitcoin can be the key to financial freedom and how it can revolutionize your approach to wealth-building.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin, often referred to as a digital or cryptocurrency, is a decentralized form of currency that operates on a peer-to-peer network. In 2009, it was created by an unknown individual or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Based on blockchain technology, it aims to ensure transparency, security and immutability of transactions.\n\nOver the years, Bitcoin has gained widespread adoption and has shown significant growth in value. As of this article, Bitcoin has reached an all-time high in terms of its market capitalization, surpassing traditional financial institutions and gaining recognition from major companies and investors.\n\nConcept of holding Bitcoin\n\nOnce you buy Bitcoin with a credit card, there are various approaches, including short-term trading, day trading or long-term holding. While short-term trading can be lucrative for some, it requires constant monitoring, technical analysis and a high tolerance for risk. On the other hand, holding Bitcoin for the long term can offer a more passive and strategic approach to building wealth.\n\nHolding Bitcoin involves purchasing Bitcoin with the intention of keeping it for an extended period, typically years, rather than frequently buying and selling based on short-term market fluctuations. This strategy is based on the belief that Bitcoin has the potential for long-term appreciation in value, driven by its scarcity, utility and growing acceptance worldwide.\n\nWhy holding Bitcoin can offer potential benefits for long-term investment and wealth-building strategies\n\nOne of the main reasons why holding Bitcoin can be the key to financial freedom is its unique characteristics as a store of value. Unlike traditional fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar or the Euro, which can be subject to inflation and depreciation, Bitcoin's limited supply may offer protection against inflation and depreciation of fiat currencies. With a limited supply of 21 million Bitcoins, its scarcity and mathematical scarcity make it an attractive option for hedging against inflation and preserving wealth.\n\nWhile short-term trading can be lucrative for some, it requires constant monitoring, technical analysis and a high tolerance for risk. On the other hand, holding Bitcoin for the long term can offer a more passive and strategic approach to building wealth. Bitcoin may offer potential benefits as part of a diversified investment portfolio, but investors should also consider the potential risks and uncertainties associated with this emerging asset class. These risks may include market volatility, regulatory uncertainty and potential security breaches, among others.\n\nIn addition, holding Bitcoin can offer diversification benefits to an investment portfolio. Traditional investment assets, such as stocks, bonds or real estate, are subject to market fluctuations and risks that can affect the overall performance of a portfolio. By adding Bitcoin to a diversified investment portfolio, investors can reduce the risk of over-reliance on traditional assets and potentially enhance their overall returns.\n\nOvercoming common misconceptions about Bitcoin\n\nDespite its growing popularity, Bitcoin still faces misconceptions and skepticism from some individuals. Concerns about its volatility, risks and legitimacy are often cited as reasons to avoid holding Bitcoin. However, it's important to note that Bitcoin has come a long way since its early days and has gained significant mainstream acceptance.\n\nWhile it's true that Bitcoin can experience short-term price volatility, especially in an emerging and relatively unregulated market, its long-term trajectory has been positive. Many experts argue that the risks associated with Bitcoin can be mitigated through careful planning, education and risk management strategies. At the same time, it is important for investors to acknowledge that Bitcoin has faced criticism and concerns from some investors and regulators. It is crucial for investors to educate themselves about the potential risks and uncertainties of investing in this asset class. Some concerns may include its volatile price movements, the potential for fraud or market manipulation and the lack of a clear regulatory framework in some jurisdictions.\n\nConclusion\n\nHolding Bitcoin can be the key to financial freedom, offering the potential for wealth accumulation, diversification and a hedge against inflation. Despite misconceptions and risks associated with Bitcoin, its growing acceptance, increasing institutional adoption and historical price appreciation make it a compelling investment option for those looking to achieve financial freedom. By educating yourself, developing a strategic plan, practicing risk management and taking a long-term investment approach, you can unlock the potential of holding Bitcoin and embark on a path toward financial freedom.\n\nThis content is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as financial advice.

        "content": "Tether International Ltd., the company behind the third-largest cryptocurrency by market value, will use 15% of its net investment profit, equivalent to $222 million of its first-quarter profit, on Bitcoin to diversify reserves backing its USDT stablecoin.\n\nKey Takeaways The issuer of the world's largest stablecoin will add to its $1.5 billion BTC reserves.\n\nTether started making a profit from operations in February of this year.\n\nThe Bitcoin allocation will amount to over $200 million based on a recent profit.\n\nTether was fined by U.S. regulators in 2021 for misrepresenting reserves backing its stablecoin meant to keep it at 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. The company, which said last week that its assets total $81.1 billion, said most of that was in the form of Treasury bills, and that 85% of its assets were \"extremely liquid\" in cash and cash equivalents. Gold and Bitcoin accounted for about 4% and 2% of Tether's total reserves, respectively.\n\n\n\nTether said it doesn't expect its Bitcoin holdings to exceed its share capital cushion\u2014reserves in excess of the customer liabilities from Tether's token issuances.\n\nTether Reserve Transparency Debate Continues\n\nThe company was fined $41 million by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and separately by the New York Attorney General two years ago for its handling of reserves. Critics say Tether has far to go before its reserves are regarded as transparent and confirmed.\n\n\"Tether\u2019s fundamental business, the essence of everything Tether does, is tied exclusively to Tether\u2019s financial reserves,\" former SEC attorney James Reed Stark tweeted last week. \"Yet those reserves remain unaudited, unconfirmed and therefore dubious.\"\n\nStark's comments sparked a twitter debate between him Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino.\n\nTether's Bet on BTC Upside\n\nTether's bet on Bitcoin \"aims to capitalize on the digital asset's potential growth\" and it's not the only company to do so. Software company MicroStrategy (MSTR) has also been buying Bitcoin as an investment. At the end of the first quarter, MicroStrategy's Bitcoin stash swelled to 140,000, valued at about $4.2 billion.\n\n\n\nTether's new strategy could also underpin the price of Bitcoin into the end of the year, with analysts at Standard Chartered Bank saying the cryptocurrency may hit $100k by the end of 2024, CNBC reported. The collapse of SVB and mid-tier lenders have improved the outlook for BTC as a \"trustless asset,\" while profits at crypto miners and the end of the Fed's tightening cycle would also help, said analyst Geoff Kendrick."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Exchange traded funds myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools\n\nGrayscale, manager of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency fund, has long been stymied by regulators in its bid to convert its flagship vehicle into an exchange traded fund.\n\nHowever, it may have found a ruse to partially circumvent the restrictions imposed by the US Securities and Exchange commission.\n\nGrayscale has filed to launch a US-listed ETF that would partly invest in so-called \u201cspot\u201d bitcoin exchange traded products already up and running in other countries.\n\nThese ETPs invest directly in \u201cphysical\u201d bitcoin, or track the cryptocurrency\u2019s price synthetically \u2014 structures the SEC has so far not permitted.\n\nInstead, the SEC has only allowed bitcoin ETFs that trade in futures contracts listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which is a regulated venue.\n\nThis stance has prompted Grayscale to sue the SEC for its refusal to allow the $16.9bn Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a private spot bitcoin trust, to convert to an ETF. A ruling is due by the end of the third quarter.\n\nIn the interim, though, Grayscale has filed to launch a Global Bitcoin Composite ETF, which would invest 40 per cent of its assets in spot bitcoin ETPs listed on \u201cmajor non-US exchanges\u201d, such as in Canada or Europe.\n\nWhile there is no guarantee that the application will be approved, analysts believe it has a chance given that the overseas ETPs Grayscale is proposing to invest in are regulated securities \u2014 precisely the type of asset that the SEC has insisted crypto ETFs hold.\n\n\u201cGrayscale\u2019s filing seems intended to push the envelope with the SEC by using the SEC\u2019s own words against it to launch crypto ETFs,\u201d said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research, North America at Morningstar.\n\n\u201cThis seems like Grayscale is directly challenging the SEC\u2019s past decision to allow bitcoin futures ETFs on one hand and on the other hand reject spot bitcoin ETFs,\u201d he added.\n\nTodd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, a consultancy, described the filing \u201cas a creative way of Grayscale trying to offer US-listed product with some spot bitcoin exposure\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think there is greater likelihood of Grayscale getting approval for this ETF than it getting the SEC to voluntarily approve a US-listed spot bitcoin only ETF, which is what Grayscale wants,\u201d he added.\n\nRosenbluth believed the filing was an \u201cacceptance of the reality that the SEC is not going to give [Grayscale] the green light\u201d, to convert GBTC.\n\nOne point in Grayscale\u2019s favour in its latest filing is that vast numbers of US-listed ETFs already hold regulated, non-US securities, mostly in the form of equities and bonds.\n\nIndeed, at least one US ETF already holds foreign-listed spot bitcoin ETFs, appearing to set something of a precedent for the structure.\n\nThe $447mn Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) has positions in four Toronto-listed spot bitcoin ETFs, although they currently account for just 4.3 per cent of its portfolio, with the balance in stocks of companies involved in blockchain technology.\n\nGrayscale is proposing that its 40 per cent exposure to spot bitcoin ETFs would be weighted equally between five underlying funds.\n\nRosenbluth also noted the \u201cadded irony\u201d of Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) having a 6.8 per cent exposure to Grayscale\u2019s GBTC trust, even though the SEC deems GBTC\u2019s structure to be unsuitable for an ETF. The SEC declined to comment.\n\nEven if Grayscale was to get approval for the Global Bitcoin Composite ETF, it is far from certain there would be a huge appetite for the fund, however.\n\nIt is proposing that the remaining 60 per cent of the portfolio would be invested in the equity of bitcoin mining companies. Armour was unconvinced there was much demand for such a structure.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think investors benefit from access to a 60/40 portfolio of bitcoin miners and a global spot bitcoin fund of funds sleeve,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe portfolio is confusing and will do a worse job tracking the spot bitcoin price than a bitcoin futures ETF, so I\u2019m not sure this type of product adds any value aside from parsing out the SEC\u2019s strategy for approving bitcoin-related ETFs.\u201d\n\nRosenbluth agreed demand might be lacking, saying \u201ccombining bitcoin with other investments is not novel but has had limited interest\u201d.\n\nAs evidence he cited the Global X Blockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITS), which invests in the Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH) and bitcoin futures, but which holds just $11mn.\n\nRosenbluth noted that despite a strong bounce for bitcoin and crypto-related companies after last year\u2019s sharp losses, with the currency itself up 61 per cent so far this year, \u201cdemand for ETFs exposed to bitcoin has been limited\u201d.\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit the ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools helping you to understand everything from performance to ESG ratings\n\n\u201cInvestors seem sceptical the rally can persist and remember the challenges of 2022,\u201d he added.\n\nFor instance, although the $1bn ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), the largest bitcoin futures ETF, was up 57 per cent year to date as of May 12, it had only seen net inflows of $95mn, according to VettaFI\u2019s data. This was not far ahead of the $75mn attracted by the $120mn ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF Strategy (BITI), which takes the opposite bet and is down 44 per cent year to date.\n\nBKCH has returned 69 per cent so far this year but has seen net outflows of $2mn. Likewise the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) is up 68 per cent \u201cand has seen no investor interest either\u201d, Rosenbluth added.\n\nMichael Sonnenshein, chief executive of Grayscale, was more bullish, however, arguing that \u201cthere is no question, coming out of the crypto winter, that investors\u2019 appetite for crypto remains healthy. It has certainly not gone unnoticed by the crypto community that crypto has achieved some of the highest returns in 2023 to date.\u201d"

        "title": "Why do investors believe bitcoin is readying for a comeback? - Fintech Nexus",
        "content": "The following is a guest post by Dmytro Spilka, Head Wizard at Solvid.\n\nFollowing a solid start to 2023, investors are beginning to grow in confidence that a prosperous period for bitcoin is on the horizon.\n\nHowever, with many market commentators anticipating rallies beyond $100k over the coming years, what has made everyone so bullish on bitcoin again?\n\n\u201cProfessional investors are forecasting a strong year ahead for bitcoin and are confident about its long-term valuation,\u201d reported a recent Nickel Digital Asset Management survey. \u201cNearly nine out of 10 professional investors predict bitcoin price rise this year. Two out of three agree $100,000 valuation is possible but only for long-term investors.\u201d\n\nThe report suggested that bitcoin\u2019s price is expected to rise exponentially within the next three-to-five years. As much as 65% of institutional investors surveyed agree that bitcoin could hit a value of $100k in the long term, with 58% suggesting a three-to-five-year time frame, while 25% said it would take longer than five years.\n\nHowever, expectations for 2023 appear to be lower, with 23% of investors anticipating that bitcoin will exceed $30,000 by the end of the year.\n\nWith CoinGecko data showing that bitcoin\u2019s price has already accelerated from $16,450 towards $28,000 by the end of Q1 2023, it could yet be seen that Nickel\u2019s survey results for 2023 expectations end up being a little more conservative than reality.\n\nBut what about expectations for exceeding $100k over the coming years? Could BTC really rally towards six-figure valuations? Let\u2019s take a deeper look into why investors are so confident that a bitcoin comeback is on the way:\n\nGreat expectations for bitcoin\u2019s halving\n\nThe key reason behind the optimism for bitcoin\u2019s future price rallies revolves around the asset\u2019s cyclical halving events. Approximately every four years, bitcoin is programmed to halve the rewards it distributes to miners by 50%.\n\nThis mechanism helps control BTC\u2019s inflation rate and emulates the asset\u2019s scarcity in line with precious metals like gold.\n\nWith bitcoin\u2019s current halving reward at 6.25 BTC distributed per block, the next halving event will decrease rewards to 3.125 BTC per block mined. This actively creates a deflationary environment for bitcoin and has the power to increase its scarcity\u2013provided sufficient demand still exists actively.\n\nCrucially for investors, bitcoin\u2019s previous halving events in 2012, 2016, and 2020 have all preceded seismic market-wide bull runs that culminated in a new all-time high value for the cryptocurrency.\n\nOne of bitcoin\u2019s most heavily-used visualizations when anticipating the coin\u2019s halving cycles is the coin\u2019s stock-to-flow model. This assesses how BTC has performed with its halving events, with each event drawn into the chart.\n\nIn the wake of bitcoin\u2019s 2016 halving, the asset climbed to a new all-time high value of $19,783.21 in December 2017. Following the coin\u2019s 2020 halving event, an eventual all-time high of $69,044.77 was reached in November 2021.\n\nWith bitcoin\u2019s next halving event likely to occur in April 2024, much of the cryptocurrency market will be firmly braced for action throughout 2025 in anticipation of a similar all-time high-breaking bull run.\n\nAnticipating regulations\n\nEven bitcoin\u2019s most avid supporters will likely agree that the regulatory landscape will play a key role in deciding the scale of any future rally.\n\nThe recent collapse of FTX has caused more key players to call for stronger cryptocurrency market regulations to protect investors. While this can be difficult for cryptocurrency investors who believe in the power of genuinely decentralized assets that operate independently of external influences and regulators, the move may positively affect the market.\n\n\u201cThe industry is steadily moving towards regulations globally. Country-specific laws are being drafted to protect investors from market uncertainties, obliterate security risks, and prevent any impact on the monetary system should the crypto industry go through a rough period,\u201d says Rajagopal Menon, vice president of cryptocurrency WazirX.\n\nWhile the demise of FTX has hurt many investors, a new regulatory environment could be a reliable means of whittling out the industry\u2019s less sustainable players.\n\nHowever, the cryptocurrency landscape could benefit from innovating its way to greater stability alongside implementing calming regulatory measures.\n\nOne such solution is SKARB, an institutionally-focused trading terminal that enables widespread change in how institutions navigate the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nSKARB helps mitigate the prospect of institutions facing future events like FTX by unifying multiple exchanges and market makers within one UX.\n\nThis unified approach comes with vast benefits and helps institutions to avoid the risks associated with liquidity issues among cryptocurrency exchanges. This will actively aid institutions by minimizing the dangers of counterparty risk by allowing you to diversify your exposure across multiple counterparties while keeping your trade workflow unified.\n\nRelated:\n\nSKARB\u2019s unified platform allows institutions to trade effectively across multiple venues while consolidating their trading and reporting experience and establishing a more effective trade monitoring, compliance, and overall trade workflow.\n\nThis tool carries significant ramifications for the crypto regulatory landscape because it can provide far greater levels of institutional trust, which can help to ensure that organizations are better prepared against the prospect of troubled exchanges.\n\nDealing with unpredictability of economic landscape\n\nPerhaps bitcoin\u2019s biggest challenge relates to the ongoing difficult economic conditions throughout global economies. Although the coin\u2019s halving cycles can generate plenty of momentum, it\u2019s worth acknowledging that the path to bitcoin\u2019s most recent all-time high in November 2021 coincided with a significant growth period for global tech stocks, particularly those on Wall Street.\n\nThese links with traditional financial markets historically follow bitcoin, meaning that the risk of recessions in 2023 could negatively impact BTC and the broader crypto market.\n\n\u201cIf concerns about growth intensify, then crypto assets might struggle to sustain this recovery,\u201d said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index, in an interview with Markets Insider.\n\nHowever, Nasdaq has reported that bitcoin has begun to show a negative correlation in comparison to the S&P 500 Index in recent weeks for the first time since the FTX collapse, indicating that these market links may be weakening.\n\nWhile it\u2019s undoubtedly worth exercising caution when investing in cryptocurrencies, signs of growing market sentiment towards bitcoin ahead of next year\u2019s halving event seem familiar when remembering the events of 2020 and 2021.\n\nAlthough the relationship between BTC and the S&P 500 could be gradually decoupling, it\u2019s worth assessing how the cryptocurrency markets respond to upcoming economic challenges in traditional finance.\n\nWhether investors are right to be optimistic about bitcoin reaching $100,000 remains to be seen. Still, in a market where unpredictability reigns supreme, it\u2019s always safe to brace for the unexpected."

        "content": "The City of Miami's quest to become a world-class finance and tech hub continues, but industry leaders say it appears the focus is shifting away from cryptocurrency\n\nIn April 2022 at the Bitcoin conference, Mayor Francis Suarez unveiled the Miami Bull, a 3,000-pound crypto-inspired statue.\n\n\"We are redefining Miami as the financial capital of the world. The decentralized financial capital of the world,\" Suarez said in 2022.\n\nNow ahead of Bitcoin 2023, the collapse of FTX and the suspension of Miami Coin trading are leading some to wonder if this crypto craze was a bunch of bull.\n\nGet South Florida local news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC South Florida newsletters.\n\n\"I take a controversial approach. I say almost 90% of all projects, whether it was a coin or NFT project, they were pyramid schemes or Ponzi schemes,\" said Ryan Kirkley, founder of Cryptan Labs and blockchain expert. \"They only worked as long as people kept thinking they were going to be worth more later on. The problem is at the end of the day someone gets left in the back.\"\n\nKirkley moved to Miami in 2021 and said in the early stages, his company invested heavily in cryptocurrency but then began to pivot toward venture capital and artificial intelligence.\n\n\"I know a lot of prominent leaders in Miami who are not in Miami for the Bitcoin conference, which a year ago, you would've never thought of that,\" Kirkley said. \"So I do think we are seeing a pretty big shift as far as what's important to the tech leaders, entrepreneurs, CEOs and investors in the space. There is still a contingent that are Bitcoin to the end, but the majority of us are far more excited about building on technology and how to transform into the next era of technology.\"\n\nTech entrepreneur Temante Leary plans to attend the conference this weekend and said he still has confidence in Bitcoin. He believes Miami continues to be the crypto capital of the nation.\n\n\"I still have confidence in Bitcoin. I think it will go up,\" Leary said. \"I am still seeing a lot of new entrance into the Miami market and a lot of those entrants are in the fintech, crypto space.\"\n\nNBC6 reached out to Mayor Suarez's office for comment, but he was not available for an interview. In a recent interview, he said Miami's brand is tech and innovation."

There's good that came from the resulting debate \u2013 including, as former Blockstream CTO Samson Mow noted, a concerted drive to reduce the concentrated power of miners (Blockstream was early on the trend of building mining facilities in North America). But SegWit was a change that made it into a Core release, which could have passed unnoticed had miners not boycotted the change. Is there not some version of the story where the rarefied circles of Bitcoin puritans are in the wrong? Where miners, wanting a vote, kickstarted a debate that changed how Bitcoin is governed for the better?"

        "content": "The most prominent cryptocurrency shows its resilience at this year\u2019s conference in Miami Beach\n\nBy Riley Kaminer\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just those riding the mechanical bull installed in the Miami Beach Convention Center today that were taking the bull by the horns. Rather, the optimism about Bitcoin was universal amongst all the attendees Refresh Miami interacted with at this year\u2019s edition of the cryptocurrency\u2019s flagship conference.\n\nOrganizers told us that the Bitcoin 2023 conference expects a total of 13,000 to 15,000 attendees \u2013 about half the attendance of Bitcoin 2022 \u2013 across the three-day event. The conference started today with an \u2018industry\u2019 day focused on the Bitcoin business community. The goals: to network, learn, and build together.\n\nThe crowd included a large swathe of the Bitcoin \u2018maximalists\u2019 or \u2018maxis,\u2019 as its die-hard supporters are known \u2013 focused on the cultural elements surrounding Bitcoin. Another major subset of the crowd was clearly focused on the technical side of the industry. But we also spoke to some newcomers who were interested in diving deeper into the ecosystem. Clearly, the allure remains, albeit to a lesser extent than last year.\n\nMaking sense of the banking bust\n\nFor Bitcoin fans, the recent collapse of traditional banks SVB and First Republic act as a point in Bitcoin\u2019s favor.\n\nJan van Eck, CEO of asset manager Van Eck, which has $70 billion of assets under management, drew parallels between gold and Bitcoin as a way to hedge the risk of government monetary policy.\n\n\u201cThe world can change really fast, and Bitcoin is a great thing to look at in people\u2019s portfolios,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a separate conversation, Wall Street veteran turned Bitcoin influencer Caitlin Long \u2013 one of the conference\u2019s main draws \u2013 also noted that recent episodes have been \u201ca gigantic advertisement for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nL-R: Dylan LeClair, Caitlin Long, Mark Connors, and Ram Ahluwalia\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a shock that Bitcoin is up, in light of what\u2019s happened in the traditional banking system.\u201d\n\nMark Connors, the Head of Research for digital asset investor 3iQ, echoed these sentiments. He noted that the government had consolidated banks, which then overleveraged themselves \u2013 causing the global financial crisis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s continuing,\u201d Connors asserted. \u201cIn March, the Fed absorbed more banks, making this a multi-decade rollup.\u201d It is in this context that the decentralized nature of Bitcoin might provide a competitive advantage.\n\nAnxiety over regulation\n\nIf there were one main theme from today\u2019s talks, it was that regulation poses an unknown threat to the Bitcoin community. There were different philosophies on how exactly to manage this lack of regulation. For instance, van Eck signaled that his firm plans to double down on its European presence, since legislators there seem more keen on providing regulatory guidance.\n\nExperts were in consensus that regulators should act quickly. \u201cWe need action sooner, we need policy that\u2019s not prohibitive, and we need education for the policymakers that are going to build the guidelines that are going to last for the sustainable future of Bitcoin,\u201d asserted Mina Khattak, the senior director of crypto and web3 at Worldpay from FIS.\n\nFor Perianne Boring, founder of trade organization The Chamber of Digital Commerce, digital asset regulation proposed by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren \u201cjeopardizes our American values.\u201d\n\nBoring believes that Bitcoin and blockchain technology can advance US national security, economic security, and energy security. And broadly, she is optimistic that the Bitcoin crowd will prevail. \u201cThe pro-crypto army is bigger, more organized, and more sophisticated than any anti-crypto army I\u2019ve seen on the ground in Washington, D.C.,\u201d Boring asserted.\n\nBuilders continue to build\n\nA buzzing expo floor showcased a wide range of professionals doubling down on Bitcoin \u2013 from nonprofits to lawyers to blockchain infrastructure providers and more. One row was devoted to a \u201cBitcoin Bazaar,\u201d with small vendors selling wares as diverse as Bitcoin-themed children\u2019s books and \u2018shitcoin\u2019 themed toilet wipes. And another section displayed Bitcoin artwork, much of it was available for purchase (in BTC, of course).\n\nBut startups played a protagonistic role at the conference. An international set of companies took part in \u2018pitch day,\u2019 or a continual series of pitch competitions across different verticals.\n\nMiami startup Moon Mortgage was also in attendance. Brickell-based co-founder and CEO Aaron Nevin expressed his excitement about participating in the conference now as an exhibitor, after having attended for the last five years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a big family reunion,\u201d he told us. \u201cThis is the center of the crypto universe. It\u2019s incredible to be here at Bitcoin 2023 \u2013 and to be in the crypto space.\u201d\n\nIn April, Moon Mortgage announced a new product that enables users to borrow against the value of their crypto, in addition to a real estate mortgage product. Nevin said that we should expect more to come from this nine-person company as they continue to scale in the US.\n\nThe conference continues tomorrow and Saturday with keynotes from presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Vivek Ramaswamy and best-selling author Michael Lewis, as well as sessions about Bitcoin payments, self-custody, Bitcoin in the Global South, and more.\n\nMORE SCENES FROM THE BITCOIN 2023 CONFERENCE\n\nREAD MORE ON REFRESH MIAMI:"

For the trade to go sideways, so much else has to go wrong. It never really made sense to me when Do Kwon would bash the U.S. dollar, claiming that his \u201cdecentralized money\u201d (which was pegged to fiat!) would outcompete the world\u2019s reserve currency. Likewise, Tether\u2019s support of bitcoin as a hedge is an implicit acknowledgement of the risk of its own main product. There\u2019s really no amount of bitcoin that would save the firm if the buck breaks. But until that happens, Tether just has to take in funds and pay out withdrawals \u2013 and it can invest the spread wherever it wants."

To this end, they offer a range of services, including Bitcoin brokerage, full-reserve custody, mining, and a Bitcoin wallet that supports both on-chain and Lightning Network transactions.\n\nRiver\u2019s CEO, Alex Leishman, has noted a surge in Bitcoin interest, particularly from businesses and institutions. He attributes this to growing recognition of the flaws in the traditional financial system and an acknowledgment of Bitcoin\u2019s potential to foster a more secure and transparent global economy.\n\nThe company has also developed River Lightning, an enterprise API that facilitates integration with the Lightning Network. It\u2019s already being used by several crypto applications, such as El Salvador\u2019s Chivo wallet, for instant Bitcoin payments.\n\nWith the demand for Lightning transactions increasing due to rising on-chain fees, River plans to use part of the funding to enhance its B2B River Lightning segment. The company aspires to be the industry\u2019s back-end for Bitcoin payments.\n\nEmphasising River\u2019s commitment to regulatory compliance and avoiding undue risks, Leishman maintains that River\u2019s approach is to do things right. The firm intends to continue promoting a brighter economic future powered by Bitcoin, staying true to its mission.\n\nFounded in 2019, River has emerged as a leading player in Bitcoin technology and financial services. The company provides an all-in-one mobile app and platform for Bitcoin brokerage, custody, and mining.

The difficulty changes roughly every two weeks and measures how hard a miner would have to work to verify transactions on a block. A higher difficulty reading indicates that it is more competitive to mine Bitcoin.\n\nSee related article: Could Bitcoin mining make renewable energy more profitable?\n\nFast facts\n\nThe mining difficulty reading came in at 49.55 trillion at block height 790,272 in Thursday\u2019s adjustment, rebounding from a 1.45% decline in the previous adjustment on May 4, according to data from BTC.com.\n\nThe difficulty of mining Bitcoin typically rises when more miners go online, which raises competition.

The stablecoin issuer plans to strengthen its reserves with the help of Bitcoin (BTC) and move away from United States-based government debts.\n\nIn an announcement on May 17, Tether revealed that it plans to invest a portion of its profits into BTC on a monthly basis. The firm said it will \u201cregularly allocate up to 15% of its net realized operating profits towards purchasing Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe announcement comes within a week of the company\u2019s quarterly financial report, where the stablecoin issuer reported $1.5 billion in net profits.\n\nAccording to a statement from the company, Tether will keep all of its Bitcoin in self-custody. At the end of the first quarter of 2023, it has $1.5 billion in Bitcoin on hand, making up around 2% of its total reserves. 85% of the holdings were in cash, cash equivalents and other short-term deposits, primarily Treasury bills.\n\nTether claimed BTC was an obvious choice since the market-leading cryptocurrency has proven to be a long-term store of value assets. The stablecoin issuer cited Bitcoin\u2019s mammoth price rise over the past decade and its resilience against traditional financial failures for the decision.\n\nRelated: Circle CEO blames US crypto crackdown for declining USDC market cap\n\nIn a statement, Tether chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino said that the world\u2019s first and largest cryptocurrency is underpinned by its potential as an investment asset.

        "content": "Total daily Ordinals inscriptions on the Bitcoin network fell to 282,467 on Tuesday from 374,037 on Sunday, but Bitcoin network congestion remains stubbornly high.\n\nThe slowing rate of new Ordinals, a form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin network, comes as the network surpassed 7 million inscriptions on Monday.\n\nWeekly Ordinals sales volume on the Bitcoin network fell 51.84% to US$37.8 million on Tuesday, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nThere were 250,876 Bitcoin transactions waiting in line to be validated at 8:40 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to mempool.space data.\n\nThe network jam could be attributed to the red-hot growth of BRC-20 tokens, the fungible tokens standard built on the Ordinals protocol.\n\nThe number of different types of BRC-20s grew from 14,300 tokens on May 11 to 24,677 on Wednesday. BRC-20 tokens have a combined market capitalization of around half a billion dollars and have been increasing block space demand on the world\u2019s first modern blockchain, according to data provider BRC-20.io.\n\nThe persisting Bitcoin network congestion raised concerns about the effect of Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens and their potential to clog the network, raising confirmation time and costs for regular Bitcoin transactions.\n\n\u201cOrdinals have slowed down a bit, and are taking a bit of a back seat to BRC-20s, and like you\u2019re seeing, they\u2019re behaving similarly and filling up the [memory pool],\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, an NFT strategist at Forkast Labs. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing but healthy for Bitcoin to see such tremendous activity, and its only threat is that it will drive the development of layer 2 solutions to help with scalability as we see on Ethereum already.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s network congestion can be measured by its memory pool size, or mempool, the queue of pending valid transactions waiting to be added to blocks. It is often measured in virtual bytes (vbytes), and a single Bitcoin block can theoretically hold up to a million vbytes.\n\nThe mempool size was at a near one-month high of 202.8 million vbytes as of 5:40 p.m. Hong Kong time. Bitcoin\u2019s mempool size stood at 3.31 million vbytes on April 24, according to on-chain data from mempool.space.\n\n\u201cI know some are complaining about keeping Bitcoin pure as just a currency, but that\u2019s old-world mentality,\u201d said Petscher. \u201cThis is a decentralized blockchain and the people will use it exactly how it\u2019s intended to be used, which is free from censorship and free to use as they want.\u201d\n\nThe growing mempool size caused Bitcoin transaction fees to surge to a two-year high of US$30.91 on May 8, before retracing to US$5.6 at press time, according to Chicago-based financial data firm YCharts.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin dips to US$26,166 as memecoins flood the blockchain"

        "content": "MicroStrategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor said the company isn\u2019t just aware of Ordinals, it\u2019s interested in how the protocol that\u2019s set Bitcoin\u2019s community abuzz could lead to software innovation.\n\nIn an interview at Bitcoin 2023 in Miami, Saylor exclusively told Decrypt that the software firm is looking at Ordinals and assessing its potential in terms of application development.\n\nOften used to create NFT-like assets on top of Bitcoin, Ordinals launched in January, and the protocol\u2014while not embraced entirely by the Bitcoin community\u2014has created a new wave of experimentation with crypto\u2019s oldest coin.\n\nWhile Bitcoin Fees Soar to Two-Year Highs, El Salvador Pays the Price\n\nOne recent innovation in the space leveraging Ordinals is an experimental framework for building tokens on top of Bitcoin. It was pioneered by the pseudonymous on-chain data enthusiast Domo in early March. And since then, thousands of other so-called BRC-20 tokens have been created.\n\nAll those transactions have been partly\u2014or entirely, depending on who you ask\u2014responsible for elevated transaction fees on Bitcoin. That\u2019s been a boon for Bitcoin miners, who collect transaction fees for their role in securing the network. But lots of members of the community have complained that high fees make it harder for regular people to use BTC as the peer-to-peer electronic cash system that Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, intended it to be.\n\nThe discussion surrounding Ordinals is important, Saylor said, because \u201cBitcoin miners have to be successful over the long term.\u201d He added that the development of applications building on Bitcoin\u2019s functionality could also bolster the coin\u2019s overall adoption, among individuals, firms, and governments.\n\nSaylor didn\u2019t specifically say what use cases MicroStrategy could be looking into that tap Ordinals, but he noted the ability to commit data to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain that isn\u2019t solely related to transactions has many potential applications.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe whole idea of burning a piece of data on the blockchain opens the door to the possibility that I might burn a digital signature, or I might burn a registration, or I might burn a hash of a document,\u201d Saylor said.\n\nMichael Saylor: Bitcoin Ordinals Are a \u2018Catalyst\u2019 for Adoption\n\nTouching on corporate security, Saylor mentioned DocuSign, which lets businesses and individuals send and sign agreements securely using the firm\u2019s electronic signature product. But that makes mega corporations reliant on a proprietary database, Saylor noted.\n\n\u201cRight now, enterprises have weak security compared to Bitcoin,\u201d Saylor said, adding that innovations using the world's largest cryptocurrency could possibly \u201cintroduce a new level of security\u201d available to firms \u201cthat doesn't exist right now.\u201d\n\nSaylor\u2019s comments come just a week after he described Ordinals as a \u201ccatalyst\u201d for Bitcoin adoption on the PBD Podcast. Still, he acknowledges that Ordinals have been used for plenty of silly reasons.\n\n\"The general consensus is criticize stuff that we think is silly, but don't censor it,\" he said on Thursday in Miami.\n\nSaylor didn't want to predict \"which protocol will win,\u201d but he said altering Bitcoin so that it censors certain uses would be wrong. It was a nod to the effort by a group of core Bitcoin developers, including Luke Dashjr, to treat Ordinals as \"spam\" and filter them out of transactions.\n\n\u201cIf somebody wants to change the protocol, in order to censor someone else from using Bitcoin, I don't think that's consistent with the values of the community,\u201d Saylor said. \u201cI do believe in rules without rulers.\u201d"

        "content": "There has been a longer-ranging positive for recently-weak bitcoin prices. The number of addresses holding at least one bitcoin is now at an all-time high.\n\nThose are also known as \u201cwholecoiner\u201d addresses, and recent data from Glassnode confirms that as of May 13, the number of wholecoiners is at record highs. That implies smaller crypto market participants used the crypto winter of 2022 and this year\u2019s pullbacks to grow their bitcoin positions. Now, many such participants have gathered together enough of the digital currency to get to the much-ballyhooed \u201cone\u201d level.\n\nThe rise of wholecoiners is important because smaller bitcoin owners tend to hold the cryptocurrency for longer periods of time. This can somewhat dampen broader bitcoin market volatility. Because of small initial stakes, these market participants are unlikely to sell at the first big decline or depart into substantial rallies.\n\nRather, many wholecoiners take a long-term view of bitcoin and see value in incrementally building stakes and buying on dips. Additionally, we can assume a fair number of these market participants will continue to build their positions. They don\u2019t want to liquidate all of their bitcoin holdings just after reaching their personal price objectives.\n\nWholecoiner Details\n\nThere are now about one million wholecoiners holding at least one bitcoin. Alone, that\u2019s impressive, but there\u2019s more to the story that could be encouraging for crypto bulls.\n\n\u201cWhile the round number \u2018one million\u2019 marks a new notch in the record books, it\u2019s worth pointing out that one Bitcoin wallet address doesn\u2019t always represent a single person,\u201d reported Tom Mitchelhill for Cointelegraph. \u201cMany crypto investors have multiple Bitcoin addresses and other addresses belong to major institutions like cryptocurrency exchanges and investment firms that typically own large sums of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThere are other implications related to the buy-and-hold nature of these investors. As they hold bitcoin rather than trade it, this may support price appreciation. There is, after all, a finite amount of bitcoin, and much of it is permanently lost.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, a staggering 3 million BTC \u2014 worth $80.4 billion and accounting for 17% of the total circulating supply \u2014 are \u2018lost forever,\u2019 according to estimates from Glassnode, which draws the figure from a combination of data including BTC sent to \u2018burn addresses,\u2019 wallets with lost keys and large accounts that have remained untouched for more than a decade,\u201d noted Mitchelhill.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel.\n\nThe opinions and forecasts expressed herein are solely those of Tom Lydon, and may not actually come to pass.

        "title": "The 3 Types of Cryptos That Could Outperform Bitcoin This Year - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Even with its recent pullback from the $30,000 price level, Bitcoin remains one of the top-performing cryptos of 2023. It is up 65% this year, and it's hard to find any large market-cap coins that can top this.\n\nBut savvy investors know it's best not to put all your eggs into one basket. If you are looking to diversify your crypto portfolio, here are three types of digital coins that could outperform Bitcoin this year.\n\n1. Potential Ethereum replacements\n\nWhile Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) continues to be the dominant Layer 1 blockchain in the crypto world, there are plenty of up-and-comers that hope to dethrone it. Three rivals that stand out are Solana, Aptos, and Fantom. Both Solana and Aptos are up more than 100% this year, and Fantom is not too far behind, at 93%.\n\nJudging from their performance, investors are not entirely convinced that Ethereum is going to retain its dominant role in so many key blockchain sectors, ranging from non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to decentralized finance (DeFi). While The Merge helped to improve the speed, efficiency, and scalability of the core Ethereum blockchain, these blockchain rivals are still much faster and cheaper. That has huge implications in areas such as DeFi, where users are looking for near-zero fees and near-instantaneous settlement of transactions.\n\nOf these Ethereum rivals, my personal pick is Solana, which has been out-innovating Ethereum of late. For example, Solana recently launched the first-ever mobile phone for a major blockchain network (the Saga) and has been exploring new initiatives to leverage all the hype and excitement around artificial intelligence, including a new plug-in for ChatGPT. For Solana to outperform Bitcoin, it will need to show that mobile crypto and crypto AI are sustainable, long-term growth catalysts.\n\n2. Scaling solutions for Ethereum\n\nIf you are looking for a less risky way to outperform Bitcoin, then blockchain scaling solutions for Ethereum could be the answer. Simply stated, these scaling solutions sit on top of the main blockchain and help Ethereum process transactions faster and cheaper.\n\nFor that reason, they are referred to as Layer 2 solutions (i.e., they are the second layer on top of the base Ethereum layer). Each scaling solution uses its own form of proprietary technology to accomplish its goals, so it can sometimes be difficult to differentiate among these different solutions.\n\nIf you buy into the idea that these Layer 2 coins are essential to the future success of Ethereum, then there are a few key prospects to target, including Immutable, Optimism, and Polygon. The name that's probably most familiar to investors will be Polygon, which has been making waves recently with new NFT initiatives, including a high-profile partnership with Nike to create an entirely new NFT marketplace for digital sneakers. However, if you are craving maximum upside potential, a better pick might be Immutable, which is up a mind-blowing 99% this year.\n\n3. Cryptos that help people stake on Ethereum\n\nLastly, there are a growing number of cryptos that help people stake on Ethereum. Now that Ethereum has transformed from a proof-of-work blockchain into proof of stake, this is tremendously important. Crypto staking is suddenly big business, and investors are always looking for ways to earn the highest staking rewards possible.\n\nThe two big names to watch here are Lido DAO, which is up 95% this year, and Rocket Pool, which is up 157% this year. Both emerged from relative obscurity after The Merge due to the popularity of staking, and both now currently rank in the Top 50 cryptos in terms of market capitalization.\n\nWhich of these is the best buy?\n\nThe common theme of all three categories of cryptos detailed above is that they somehow involve Ethereum. The first category, for example, includes all those capable of displacing Ethereum one day as the preeminent Layer 1 blockchain. The second category includes all digital currencies helping Ethereum scale bigger and faster. And the third category includes all cryptos that involve staking on Ethereum.\n\nSo if the prospect of picking winners and losers in niche areas of the blockchain space seems too daunting, the classic buy-and-hold crypto is Ethereum, which is up a not-too-shabby 52% this year.\n\nBut if you're looking for a little extra turbocharging for your portfolio, then my best picks would be Solana and Polygon. I'm long-term bullish on both of them, and I still regard both as best-in-class for their respective blockchain categories."

The price of the Axie Infinity token added about 8%.\n\nAmong the Ethereum competitors, the Solana token gained 2%, Cardano's ada added 3.5% and the Polkadot token jumped 3%.\n\nOn Wednesday Ripple, the global payments company behind XRP, announced its acquisition of Metaco, a Swiss crypto custody services firm. The deal is expected to give Ripple access to clients like Citi and BNP Paribas and expand its overseas presence.\n\nCrypto price action has been relatively subdued for the past month, despite volatility coming back a bit recently due to thin liquidity in the market. Still, realized 30-day volatility for both bitcoin and ether are off their record lows of the year, according to Glassnode.\n\nWith that, some investors have shifted their attention away from bitcoin and toward smaller and newer tokens, or \"altcoins.\" This is a recurring period in the bitcoin cycle known as \"altcoin season.\" In recent months, bitcoin and ether have been regarded by many as so-called \"blue chip\" or \"flight to safety\" assets in crypto.\n\n\"Like macro markets, juggling resilient stock prices with increasingly bleak economic data points, the crypto market is also dealing with duality. There are some signs of frothiness,\" said Noelle Acheson, author of the \"Crypto is Macro Now\" newsletter.\n\nSpecifically, earlier this month ether briefly rallied and the Bitcoin blockchain saw a record high in daily transactions amid a surge in interest around memecoins and NFT-like tokens on the Bitcoin network called ordinals.\n\n\"In spite of these hints of froth, activity is low,\" Acheson added. \"Prices are down more than 10% on the month, and volumes are trending lower.\"\n\nBitcoin and ether continued to hover around the flat line Wednesday at the $27,000 and $1,800 levels, respectively."

        "content": "On May 17\u2019s episode of The Market Report, analyst and writer Marcel Pechman discusses whether Bitcoin (BTC) is safer than the United States dollar, considering the risk of the U.S. government defaulting on its debt. He also covers why Bitcoin\u2019s $28,000 resistance will not be a walk in the park and, finally, what is happening between Celsius, Ethereum and Lido staking. The show airs every Tuesday on the Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel.\n\nThe first news article covered discusses a Bloomberg Markets survey showing Bitcoin as a top three asset in the event of a U.S. debt default. For Pechman, it is no surprise that Bitcoin trumps fiat currencies in investors\u2019 picks, considering the central banks from the eurozone, Japan, Canada, England and Switzerland boosted their borrowing programs from the U.S. Federal Reserve in March 2023. There\u2019s a high correlation to fiat currencies, putting the asset class at significant risk if a U.S. debt default happens.\n\nPechman predicts that investors\u2019 allocations in gold would be 10x higher than Bitcoin\u2019s due to the cryptocurrency\u2019s lower market capitalization and high volatility. On the positive side, 11% of retail investors would add Bitcoin to their portfolio in the event of a government shutdown versus 46% for gold. What are the odds of Bitcoin breaking above $100,000 in the case of a government shutdown? No spoilers \u2014 check the show.\n\nOn to the show\u2019s next topic: Pechman discusses why Bitcoin\u2019s $28,000 resistance will likely prove stronger than expected. The recent correction down to $25,800 was probably caused by high transaction fees, but Pechman argues that the network worked exactly as intended and that high fees are the network\u2019s defense against spamming.\n\nThe problem holding back a quick recovery above $28,000 is professional traders\u2019 positioning using derivatives. Before the event, whales and market makers were already neutral-to-bearish.\n\nIn the final part of The Market Report, Pechman explains failed crypto lending platform Celsius\u2019 $780 million Ether (ETH) movement from the Lido staking platform. No one knows if the Ether will be sold at market and eventually paid out in U.S. dollars to Celsius creditors\n\nDon\u2019t miss out!

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is entering a new \u201cspeculation cycle\u201d typical of a bull run, new analysis says.\n\nIn a tweet on May 16, Philip Swift, creator of data resource LookIntoBitcoin and co-founder of trading suite DecenTrader, revealed history repeating itself according to the RHODL Ratio metric.\n\nRHODL Ratiocreator on BTC price: \u201cZoom out\u201d\n\nRHODL Ratio is a method of tracking BTC price behavior based on the realized price of the supply \u2014 the price at which coins last moved.\n\nCreated by Swift in 2020, it compares the relative ages of coins that moved one week ago to those which moved one to two years ago.\n\nThis ratio gives an insight into the relative activity of short-term (STHs) and long-term holders (LTHs) and, by extension, the extent to which speculation is present on the market.\n\nCurrently, RHODL is bouncing higher, having hit its green accumulation zone at the end of 2022.\n\nAt the time, Swift told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin was \u201cat the point of maximum opportunity\u201d \u2014 something which has since proven true, with BTC/USD gaining 70% in Q1 2023.\n\nPrior to that, its descent toward that point had coincided with Bitcoin\u2019s own retreat to macro lows.\n\nNow, with speculative activity seemingly increasing, he believes that a new bull cycle is already underway.\n\n\u201cWhen I created the bitcoin RHODL Ratio indicator in 2020, one thing that struck me was how it showed a new bull run forming...when the ratio value of younger coins began to increase. Which is where we are right now,\u201d he commented.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t panic about small price pullbacks. Zoom out.\u201d\n\nBitcoin RHODL Ratio annotated chart. Source: Philip Swift/Twitter\n\nSwift is not alone in his conviction. Responding, Checkmate, lead on-chain analyst at Glassnode, called RHODL Ratio \u201cone of the greatest onchain finds.\u201d\n\nAn accompanying chart, meanwhile, added that the 2021 bull market, despite delivering a blow-off top for BTC/USD, did not see a copycat move for RHODL. The last time the metric hit its red \u201chigh speculation\u201d zone was at Bitcoin\u2019s prior all-time high in late 2017.\n\nBitcoin RHODL Ratio chart (screenshot). Source: LookIntoBitcoin\n\nFear, depression and lack of interest\n\nContinuing, Swift argued that on short timeframes, market participants remain risk-off on crypto markets.\n\nRelated: Watch these BTC price levels as Bitcoin threatens to lose $27K support\n\nThe conclusion followed a scan of funding rates on exchanges, with a slew of \u201cbearish\u201d ratings for Bitcoin generated by DecenTrader. These concerned open interest and long/short ratio in addition to funding rates themselves.\n\nMarket data for various major cryptocurrencies (screenshot). Source: DecenTrader\n\n\u201cMarket is still fearful/depressed/uninterested\u2026\u201d he summarized on the day.\n\nEarlier this month, Swift gave Cointelegraph an updated forecast on what might happen to Bitcoin in the final year before its next block subsidy halving. Among other eventualities, a return to $20,000 is not out of the question.\n\nMagazine: Alameda\u2019s $38B IRS bill, Do Kwon kicked in the assets, Milady frenzy: Asia Express\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price lost steam after a failed rupture of the $27,500 resistance on May 15, putting bears in a better position for the May 19 expiry. The regulatory newsflow likely played a key role in trimming investors\u2019 risk appetite, as governments seek more control over the sector.\n\nIn a memo circulated among committee members, Democrats in the United States legislature sought to cement the Securities and Exchange Committee\u2019s (SEC\u2019s) authority over crypto. The document was made public on May 10 and included the argument that nearly all digital assets constitute securities. Moreover, according to SEC Chairman Gary Gensler\u2019s view, even network nodes are in violation of securities laws.\n\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s Treasury Committee \u201cstrongly recommended\u201d on May 17 regulating retail crypto trading and investment activity as gambling, consistent with the principle of \u201csame risk, same regulatory outcome.\u201d Treasury Committee Chair Harriett Baldwin described Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) as accounting for two-thirds of the total market capitalization of crypto assets, both of which she claimed are \u201cunbacked.\u201d\n\nThe $735 million Bitcoin weekly options expiry on May 19 might play a decisive role in determining whether the price will capitulate by falling below $26,000.\n\nBitcoin could be making a short-term bottom\n\nBitcoin bears will try to take advantage of the negative regulatory environment and uncertainty caused by the risk of the U.S. Treasury \u201crunning out of funds\u201d as the debt ceiling approaches. Such a pessimistic scenario partially explains why some Bitcoin traders decided to reduce exposure over the past couple of weeks.\n\nBitcoin 4-hour price movements during options expiries. Source: TradingView\n\nThe Bitcoin price traded down 6.6% in the 36 hours that preceded the latest BTC options expiry on May 12, marking a short-term bottom on the four-hour chart. More importantly, the subsequent three-day rally toward $27,500 was short-lived, favoring the thesis of bearish momentum.\n\nBitcoin options data shows bulls were excessively optimistic\n\nThe open interest for the May 19 options expiry is $735 million, but the actual figure will be lower since bulls concentrated their wagers above $28,000. These traders got excessively optimistic after Bitcoin\u2019s price gained 7% between May 12 and May 15, testing the $27,500 resistance.\n\nBitcoin options aggregate open interest for May 19. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe 0.42 call-to-put ratio reflects the imbalance between the $424 million in call (buy) open interest and the $312 million in put (sell) options. However, if Bitcoin\u2019s price remains near $26,500 at 8:00 am UTC on May 19, only $30 million worth of these call (buy) options will be available. This difference happens because the right to buy Bitcoin at $27,000 or $28,000 is useless if BTC trades below that level on expiry.\n\nRelated: Tether to buy Bitcoin based on monthly net profits\n\nBitcoin bulls aim for $27,000 to balance the scales\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on May 19 for call (bull) and put (bear) instruments varies depending on the expiry price.\n\nThe imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $25,000 and $26,000: 100 calls vs. 7,800 puts. Bears in total control, profiting $190 million.\n\n100 calls vs. 7,800 puts. Bears in total control, profiting $190 million. Between $26,000 and $27,000: 1,100 calls vs. 4,300 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $80 million.\n\n1,100 calls vs. 4,300 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $80 million. Between $27,000 and $28,000: 2,300 calls vs. 2,000 puts. The result is balanced between put and call options.\n\n2,300 calls vs. 2,000 puts. The result is balanced between put and call options. Between $28,000 and $29,000: 5,700 calls vs. 700 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $140 million.\n\nThis crude estimate considers the put options used in bearish bets and the call options exclusively in neutral-to-bullish trades. This oversimplification disregards more complex investment strategies.\n\nFor instance, a trader could have sold a call option, effectively gaining negative exposure to Bitcoin above a specific price. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no easy way to estimate this effect.\n\nStill, traders should be cautious as the bears are currently in a better position for Friday\u2019s weekly options expiry, favoring negative price moves. Thus, an eventual capitulation below $26,000 should not be discarded.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The Bitcoin is stored in a StormGain wallet but the funds can only be used to save on trading fees, you can\u2019t withdraw them.\n\nBitcoin Mining Software Guide\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see the appeal of crypto mining: spin up a rig, connect to a mining pool and earn Bitcoin while you sleep. But to do this, you\u2019ll need the right software to complement your hardware setup.\n\nBitcoin mining software are specialized tools that use your machine\u2019s processing power to generate new coins and introduce components to the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nHow does Bitcoin mining software work?\n\nBitcoin mining software makes use of your hardware\u2019s processing power to solve complex mathematical computations in search of a hash, an alphanumeric code that represents data \u2014 mostly transactions \u2014 on the Bitcoin blockchain or network. The hash contains the information for the next block in the network as well as the previous block, which ensures the data is accurate and in order. The computer that solves for the hash is allowed to mine the next block on the Bitcoin blockchain and collect a block reward (6.25 BTC per block as of May 9, 2023).\n\nBitcoin mining software takes as many guesses at the hash as possible in the shortest amount of time, increasing the device's odds of earning a block reward and giving miners a competitive advantage. However, the advanced computing power required for Bitcoin mining software uses a substantial amount of electricity, which can have a considerable environmental impact.\n\nBitcoin mining software pros and cons\n\nDespite its straightforward appearance, crypto mining is a complex activity with some considerable caveats that neither crypto trading nor staking share. We recommend anyone who is seriously considering bitcoin mining as a source of income to review its benefits and drawbacks before they start investing.\n\nPros of Bitcoin Mining Cons of Bitcoin Mining Contributes to Bitcoin\u2019s growth and stability . Becoming a miner, be it alone or as part of a group, helps ensure the longevity of the Bitcoin blockchain. For Bitcoin enthusiasts, this promotes the financial inclusion, innovation and democratization the coin espouses. Consumes a large amount of energy. Crypto mining in general requires a large amount of electricity to power the machines that solve hashes for miners. Bitcoin mining, however, is especially wasteful due to how competitive mining is for this digital asset. Hands-off investment . Once you have the necessary hardware and software, you only need to worry about upkeep and minor upgrades to your machine. Compare this to crypto trading, which is a more involved process that demands constant attention in order to see any profits. Expensive up front . Solo miners require high-end hardware to even have a chance at competing with others. Even those in mining pools or farms will have to invest plenty in their mining rig to get anything out of these arrangements. No interference from third parties. Bitcoin mining offers financial freedoms that other ventures do not. For example, miners can freeze their resources at any time and are not as exposed to data fraud issues from banks or centralized crypto exchanges. Can\u2019t afford going offline. In order to have an efficient bitcoin mining operation, miners have to be online all the time. Going offline does not completely stop the mining process, but having a strong, uniform and continuous internet connection is crucial nonetheless.\n\nWhat are the average fees of Bitcoin mining software?\n\nMost Bitcoin mining software is free to download, and many of the most popular software on the market don\u2019t charge any mining fees.\n\nThat being said, there are a few mining software companies that charge a monthly fee for using their software (usually just a few dollars per mining rig). Some software charges service fees (typically 1% to 6.5%) that are deducted from your total mining profits.\n\nBest for\u2026 Available Platforms Fees CGMiner Experienced Miners Windows, Mac, Linux None NiceHash Miner Beginners Windows, Mac, Linux 2% fee for payments Cudo Miner Different Cryptos Windows, Mac, Linux 1.5% - 6.5% MultiMiner Open-Source Software Windows (Mac and Linux requires additional software) None Kryptex Miner Automation Windows 0.00005 BTC (or 3%) Ecos Cloud Mining Cloud-Based Cloud-based Service contracts starting at $150 Awesome Miner Centralized Management Windows, Linux $2/month per miner EasyMiner Fast Setup Windows None\n\nHow to choose a Bitcoin mining software\n\nWhen looking for a quality Bitcoin mining software for your mining rig, you\u2019ll want to review the following details:\n\nPrice\n\nMost Bitcoin mining software is free to download. However, some software charge fees on a regular basis or offer additional features behind a paywall. Others still may require both an up-front cost and ongoing expenses, like cloud-based mining services.\n\nMake sure to understand all of the costs associated with a Bitcoin mining software before purchasing or downloading it. Find out if it requires a one-time payment or charges monthly service fees, and consider how much that could eat into your crypto mining profits. Also, check whether the software puts all your bitcoin into its own wallet and charges withdrawal fees.\n\nSupported hardware\n\nSome mining software only support certain graphics cards, while others are designed for newer hardware, such as ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) units. Make sure your hardware is supported before you settle on a Bitcoin mining software.\n\nSupported operating system(s)\n\nWhile most Bitcoin mining software supports Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems, some don't. Make sure your operating system is supported before attempting to download the mining software.\n\nUser Interface\n\nNot all mining software is designed with beginners in mind. If you\u2019re uncomfortable with a command-line interface, make sure the Bitcoin mining software has a graphical user interface or a web-based interface. These types of interface make navigating the software much easier.\n\nHow long does it take to mine a bitcoin?\n\nHow long it takes to mine a bitcoin will vary widely depending on your hardware and chosen bitcoin mining software. Estimates from various sources say that solo miners can mine one bitcoin in about ten minutes, but this is only with an ideal (i.e. expensive) setup. Realistically speaking, most miners will be able to mine a bitcoin in around 30 days.\n\nMoreover, while it's possible to determine how much time it would take to mine a single bitcoin, it\u2019s technically impossible to do as much \u2014 at least as a solo miner. This is because bitcoin mining is a binary game: You either win the network\u2019s current block reward for solving a hash or lose against other miners in the race. That is to say, you either earn 6.25 BTC or you don\u2019t.\n\nThis \u201crule\u201d doesn\u2019t apply for mining pools or farms since miners in those groups share the block rewards between themselves. With this type of arrangement, it\u2019s possible to accumulate fractions of a bitcoin, which may eventually add up to a single bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Mining Software FAQs What is bitcoin mining? chevron-down chevron-up Bitcoin mining is the process of solving complicated mathematical equations in order to verify and record new bitcoin transactions. Miners receive bitcoin for processing these transactions, which is how new bitcoins enter into circulation. Mining helps maintain the Bitcoin blockchain's history but is highly competitive, requires specialized hardware and can have a markedly negative impact on the environment. How to mine bitcoin? chevron-down chevron-up Technically, all you need to start mining bitcoin is your choice of bitcoin mining software and a specialized or high-end computer. The choice of hardware comes down to either an ASIC miner, which is a computer exclusively designed for mining specific coins, or a PC with a powerful GPU (graphics card) or CPU (processor). Once you have both of these elements, you can begin the mining process and earn some bitcoin. Because companies have turned bitcoin mining into a large-scale commercial affair by using data centers with purpose-built servers, most individual miners are at a disadvantage. This is why many prospective miners choose to join a mining pool when starting out \u2014 especially if they don't have a powerful machine.

This is why many prospective miners choose to join a mining pool when starting out \u2014 especially if they don't have a powerful machine. Can I run multiple Bitcoin mining software on one computer? chevron-down chevron-up You can run multiple Bitcoin mining software on your computer, but that may not be advisable. If you do this, make sure one software is focused on your CPU and the other on GPU so they aren't trying to pilfer processing power from each other. You may also be able to set up multiple mining software to connect to different mining pools. This allows you to automatically switch to the backup software if one goes down, minimizing downtime. But most Bitcoin mining software offers automatic switching these days and are designed to run only one instance. You may also be able to set up multiple mining software to connect to different mining pools. This allows you to automatically switch to the backup software if one goes down, minimizing downtime. But most Bitcoin mining software offers automatic switching these days and are designed to run only one instance. Is Bitcoin mining software eco-friendly? chevron-down chevron-up Bitcoin mining is not eco-friendly. It used to consume only a small amount of processing power when the network was relatively small and mining difficulty was low. As the Bitcoin network has grown over the past decade, however, mining has become extremely difficult and now requires a great amount of processing power to compete for block rewards. This has made Bitcoin a very consumptive technology. In fact the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index reports that global Bitcoin mining operations utilize more power than all of The Netherlands. This problem has spurred discussions at a global level on how to regulate Bitcoin mining to reduce its impact on the environment. This has made Bitcoin a very consumptive technology.

        "title": "Who's buying and selling bitcoin - Coinbase",
        "content": "Market view\n\nThere are several important technical supply vs demand factors that may influence bitcoin performance in the next few months, ahead of the rewards halving event in April 2024:\n\nMt. Gox (141,686 BTC). One of the most well telegraphed sources of pressure in the months ahead may be the bitcoin that\u2019s due to be distributed to creditors as part of the Mt. Gox rehabilitation plan. Disbursements are supposed to be made by October 31 (though the deadline may be extended), but bitcoin selling could take place before that to raise the cash needed for settlements. The general framework is that the first JPY200k (~US$1440) of each creditor\u2019s claim will be paid in cash followed by a mix of around 70%/30% token vs cash for the remaining balance \u2013 unless a creditor has explicitly requested a different split (e.g. 100% bitcoin or 100% cash). Incidentally, the two largest creditors representing around 20% of all Mt. Gox claims have also elected to be paid in mostly bitcoin. Note that we do not know the current number of available creditors as an unspecified number have sold their claims to third parties, but the Mt. Gox collapse had initially affected around 24,000 creditors. That puts the potential upper limit of forced bitcoin selling near an estimate of 35k BTC. Currently, the Mt. Gox trustee is sitting on 137,891 BTC, a balance that has remained constant since May 2018.\n\nUala. The Central Bank of Argentina (BCRA) issued a regulatory decree on May 4 that prevents payment service providers (that offer payment accounts) in its country from carrying out crypto related operations for their clients. This is forcing around 250-300k customers of one fintech firm \u2013 Uala \u2013 to liquidate their crypto asset holdings (mainly BTC and ETH) within 30 days. Note that digital assets will have to be sold (to be settled in ARS) as the company doesn\u2019t allow their digital wallets to transfer crypto off the platform \u2013 ruling out the possibility of self-custody. Their platform had required a minimum investment of ARS250 (~$1.08) per user. We do not know the total amount of bitcoin that has been or may need to be sold.\n\nTether. Stablecoin Tether (USDT) announced that it would start accumulating bitcoin in its reserves on a monthly basis using 15% of its net realized operating profits from investments (i.e. not including asset appreciation). Given that Tether increased its net profit by $1.5B in the first quarter, this would presumably translate into $222.3M in bitcoin purchases (equivalent to 8,234 BTC) in the first tranche of buying, based on the data from its 1Q23 Assurance Report . The attestation also indicates that bitcoin comprised $1.5B or 1.8% of its consolidated reserves as of March 31, contributing to excess reserves of $2.4B or a 3.1% capital ratio on its $79.4B outstanding liabilities. This is up from a capital ratio of 1.5% in 4Q22.\n\nPlease be aware that the list provided above is not exhaustive, and there could be additional factors or sources that may contribute to bitcoin market activity through year-end."

        "content": "If the Warren-Marshall legislation fails the necessary test, does it do more harm than good? After all, money laundering is terrible. Shouldn\u2019t the legislation be passed even if it only helps on the margins? Here is where the harms of the legislation, namely requiring those that develop software and validate transactions on a blockchain to register as financial institutions, are so problematic. The problem is these individuals can\u2019t practically register as a financial institution. The authors of this legislation know this and further know that requiring software developers and validators to engage in the same kind of multi-million dollar compliance regime that banks do would collapse the crypto economy, which, after all, is the point."

        "content": "Mass crypto adoption is already taking place around the world, but not in the United States or Europe, nor does it have Bitcoin as a flagship asset for mainstream acceptance. According to Daniel Fogg of IOV Labs, the foundation that supports smart contract platform Rootstock among other projects, the increase in adoption is instead ongoing in emerging markets, where cryptocurrencies are offering solutions to people\u2019s everyday problems.\n\nIn an interview with Cointelegraph\u2019s Joe Hall at the Bitcoin Builders Conference in Miami, Fogg spoke about Bitcoin pragmatism, adoption worldwide and how emerging economies are shaping the future of the crypto space.\n\nJoe Hall and Daniel Fogg at the Bitcoin Builders Conference 2023. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nAccording to Fogg, emerging markets are leading the way in crypto adoption for one major reason \u2014 countries that have significant macroeconomic challenges. In his view, many people\u2019s first meaningful digital banking experience will be happening in emerging markets on crypto rails in the coming years.\n\n\u201cPeople on the streets have a pressing need to protect their income, to get access to U.S. dollars to get a loan. [...] We\u2019re seeing these massive shifts. For me, if you want to look at the future of what I hope crypto will become, it exists today in Turkey, Colombia, Nigeria, Argentina. It doesn\u2019t exist today in the United States or the U.K.\"\n\nFogg believes the crypto space is evolving through two major crypto use cases. One is centered around decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions for people seeking outsized returns and alternative investment opportunities. Another use case involves people acquiring stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar for savings and daily payments in economies dealing with inflation, devaluation and other monetary problems.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a kind of bifurcation in what DeFi could become, advanced DeFi, which is a lot of what I think the usage in America and Europe will be [...], and then everyday DeFi, which is what you\u2019re going to see in emerging markets every day.\"\n\nEmerging markets offer \u201cscale opportunity\u201d to retail finance, said Fogg, adding that developing DeFi products for these areas is a key strategy for Rootstock and its sister company, IOV Labs. Speaking about Bitcoin pragmatism, Fogg highlighted that although Bitcoin is a remarkable innovation, Bitcoin alone is simply not enough. As told by Fogg, the crypto space doesn\u2019t yet have an established use case for billions of users, and it may take years to achieve that:\n\n\u201cIn many cases, we think they\u2019re paying, saving, borrowing, lending, retail finance, etc. But there are many other use cases as well.

Discover SCENE\n\nThousands of people flocked to Miami Beach this week to partake in Bitcoin 2023 and talk shop about crypto\u2019s top coin, but some attendees said the iconic conference feels different on its first day than in years past\u2014with less hype and more empty chairs.\n\nThe conference devoted to crypto\u2019s most dominant coin attracted around 35,000 people last year, according to the event\u2019s website, featuring speakers like the NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers and the tennis legend Serena Williams.\n\nBut a steep decline in digital asset prices and a wave of crypto-native blowups has dampened attendance. The conference organizers expect to see 15,000 attendees at what they call \u201cthe world\u2019s largest Bitcoin gathering.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt's not wall-to-wall packed like it normally is,\u201d said Andre Hicks, a traveling nurse based in upstate New York, who\u2019s attended the Miami-based Bitcoin conference for the past two years. \u201cI've never ever been to one where it was just like a dead bear market like it is now.\u201d\n\nBitcoin 2023 attendee Andre Hicks. Source: Andr\u00e9 Begansk/Decrypt\n\nHe attributed the lack of people present to a decline in disposable income for the average person, pointing to factors like high inflation. He also said most people would prefer to attend a conference where Bitcoin was rising as opposed to one where its price is depressed.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants to win,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cBut nobody wants to go through the stacking phase, actually teaching yourself about cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nGeneral admission tickets to Bitcoin 2023 cost nearly $1,000, but the cheapest option among tickets only grants attendees access to two of the conferences three days. Conference goers who spent an extra $1,300 got access to an Industry Pass, which granted them access to events set aside for Bitcoin-related businesses yesterday.\n\nBitcoin 2023 attendee Sam Miyakawa. Source: Andr\u00e9 Beganski/Decrypt\n\n\u201cThey'll get a lot more people here tomorrow,\u201d said Sam Miyakawa, an open-source developer who\u2019s interested in decentralized social media and contributes to Snort Social, a nostr-based project. \u201cI didn't expect that many people to be here.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCompared to Bitcoin 2022, which Miyakawa also attended, it only makes sense that fewer people would attend this year, he said. He noted that when Bitcoin 2022 took place last April, crypto was just coming off a bull market.\n\nBitcoin 2023 attendee Will Laurent. Source: Andr\u00e9 Beganski/Decrypt\n\nIn the conference\u2019s press room, where speakers mingled with influencers and reporters, Will Laurent, a contract worker for DFINITY, said it felt like a ghost town compared to last year.\n\nDuring Bitcoin 2022, the press room was packed, Laurent said, as people clamored to interview speakers like the Canadian entrepreneur and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary or the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s Chairman, Brock Pierce.\n\n\u201cThey still might come in,\u201d Laurent said, referring to the two former speakers. \u201cBut where are all the other people?\u201d"

        "content": "Cormint Data Systems, a burgeoning Bitcoin miner that aims to mine cost-effective Bitcoin at scale while supporting a sustainable and dependable power grid, has announced a successful $30m Series A equity raise.\n\nThe funding round was co-headed by Cormint\u2019s President, Jamie McAvity, and Silicon Laboratories, Inc\u2019s Chairman Nav Sooch. The round also saw significant participation from existing investors. Silicon Labs\u2019 former CTO, Alessandro Piovaccari, joined the round as an advisor to Cormint alongside Sooch, while also investing in the company.\n\nThe Series A funding supplements the capital Cormint previously raised through Bitcoin-denominated promissory notes issued in 2022. This additional financial backing will facilitate rapid expansion of Cormint\u2019s operations at its main site in Fort Stockton.\n\nThe company has set an ambitious goal of achieving 2.4 EH of self-mining capacity by the end of 2024. With its proprietary immersion solution and power optimisation software, Cormint aspires to be one of the lowest-cost Bitcoin miners in North America.\n\nThe freshly secured funds will be used to further expand Cormint\u2019s operations in West Texas, with President Jamie McAvity emphasising his commitment to Bitcoin mining in the region. He underscored the supportive regulatory environment in Texas, highlighting its favourable impact on the growing Bitcoin mining industry and the state\u2019s transition to renewable energy.\n\nCormint\u2019s President, Jamie McAvity, expressed his elation at the strong support from investors. He recently led both equity and debt rounds into Cormint after successfully exiting his previous SaaS business, Knock, which was acquired by Texas-based Realpage in 2022.\n\nMcAvity said, \u201cI am going all in on Bitcoin mining in West Texas. Pecos County is our home and we are proud to be here. In my view, Texas is the best place to be a Bitcoin miner, having set the playing field with transparent and fair regulation for the fast growing Bitcoin mining industry that is proven to be supportive of grid stability and the renewable energy transition.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2018, Cormint boasts a strong foundation in engineering, energy, and financial management. Its leadership team, consisting of four dedicated co-founders and ardent Bitcoin enthusiasts, believes these strengths will ensure sustainable growth and deliver impressive returns to investors throughout various economic cycles.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) users have been given a possibly more efficient way to mint new assets on the blockchain after an updated edition of the recently-rebranded Taproot Assets Protocol was released by Lightning Labs.\n\nIn a May 16 blog post, Lightning Network infrastructure firm Lighting Labs criticized the current methods by which assets are inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain, calling them \u201cparticularly inefficient\u201d and pointed to cumbersome protocols that write asset metadata \u201cdirectly into block space.\u201d\n\nToday we're excited to announce the newest version of Taproot Assets , a scalable protocol to issue assets on #bitcoin and Lightning.\n\n\n\nWith this release, developers have the core set of features to bitcoinize the dollar in a chain-efficient manner! \u26d3\ufe0fhttps://t.co/7WmeDjNnM2 \u2014 Lightning Labs\u26a1\ufe0f (@lightning) May 16, 2023\n\nThe Taproot Assets Protocol is designed to operate \u201cmaximally off-chain\u201d in order to avoid the network congestion that has become an unfortunate characteristic of the Bitcoin network since the inception of the BRC-20 token standard by anonymous developer \u201cDomo\u201d on March 8.\n\nLightning Labs said Protocol users could soon integrate BRC-20 assets into the Lightning Network, with wallets, exchanges and merchants ported, over instead of needing to \u201cbootstrap a new ecosystem\u201d from scratch.\n\nDomo has previously said the Taproot Assets Protocol is a far \u201cbetter solution\u201d for minting new assets on Bitcoin when compared to the pre-existing methods like JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), as it allows for users to easily transfer to the Lightning network for \u201cfast and cheap transactions.\u201d\n\nThe overwhelming majority of BRC-20 tokens created thus far utilize Ordinal inscriptions of JSON data to deploy token contracts, mint tokens and transfer them.\n\nThis method has drawn widespread criticism from developers, who claim the process costs four times as much in transaction fees compared to just using binary.\n\nThe Taproot Assets Protocol is the rebranded version of the original \u201cTaro\u201d protocol. Lightning Labs was forced to change the name of the software following what it called a \u201cfrivolous\u201d trademark infringement suit filed against them by blockchain development firm Tari Labs on Dec. 8 last year.\n\nRelated: Ordinals and BRC-20 will disappear in a matter of months, says JAN3 CEO\n\nThe total value of BRC-20 tokens briefly surpassed the $1 billion mark on May 9 but has since shrunk back down to $500 million, a drop of nearly 50%.\n\nThe total number of BRC-20 tokens ranked by market cap.

        "content": "Jessica Jonas, chief legal officer of the nonprofit Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund, discussed the potential legal ramifications of a high profile lawsuit against Bitcoin core developers during the Bitcoin 2023 event in Miami on May 18.\n\nThe case in question is a U.K. legal action filed by Craig Wright, the owner/operator of Tulip Trading. Wright\u2019s perhaps most well-known for his assertion that he is Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto \u2014 a claim driving another unrelated lawsuit.\n\nI would just want to say a quick reminder for BTC Core and Roger Inc.\n\n\n\nYou are under litigation hold. Those telegram groups, the signal groups, the others that you think I don't know about are all discoverable evidence and spoliation is a criminal offence. pic.twitter.com/vtjFmeGrRd \u2014 Dr Craig S Wright (@Dr_CSWright) February 3, 2023\n\nIn the case between Tulip Trading and 14 named individuals allegedly involved in the open source development of Bitcoin Core, in addition to others, Wright alleges that the said developers owe him a fiduciary duty. Jonas described the case as being about \u201can allegation that Tulip Trading owned, allegedly, 111,000 Bitcoin and was hacked, allegedly, and lost that 111,000 Bitcoin in some very Ocean\u2019s 11 style hack.\u201d\n\nIn order to obtain compensation for the alleged loss, Wright is demanding, per Jonas, that Bitcoin developers \u201ccreate a backdoor into the Bitcoin core blockchain such that Tulip Trading can recover the funds it allegedly lost,\u201d a remedy Jonas asserts can\u2019t be implemented:\n\n\u201cThey are asking the court to order that this group of software developers write a patch into the software that diverts funds. That\u2019s not how Bitcoin works. It\u2019s impossible.\u201d\n\nJonas explained that implementing such a change would require hard forking the Bitcoin blockchain and then expecting everyone in the world to shift to the new fork instead of continuing to use the existing core chain. Describing the area of law surrounding fiduciary duty as \u201ccomplicated,\u201d Jonas went on to describe the lawsuit as extraordinarily dangerous for reasons beyond technical limitations.\n\n\u201cThis case has actually already gone through an appeal and the appellate court found that the question of whether open source developers should owe a fiduciary duty to people who use their code is an important one,\u201d claimed Jonas. Furthermore, Jonas described the potential threat to the open source community as \u201cexistential.\u201d \u201cOpen source software makes up 97% of the world's software,\" she said.\n\nRelated: 7 people who could be (or not) Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto\n\nJonas also framed the case as a matter of free speech. Despite the fact that many of the defendants named in the suit are U.S. citizens operating in the U.S., the case is being tried in the U.K. per the appellate court\u2019s decision that it held jurisdiction due to the potential outcome being in the public interest in that country.\n\nAccording to Jonas, software development is considered free speech in the U.S. and, per her assessment, \u201cTulip Trading is acting in a U.K. court in a civil action to compel many Americans to speak.\u201d While the U.K. court can\u2019t necessarily enforce free speech laws in the U.S., Jonas pushed back against the idea that it would be far-fetched for the court to rule in Wright\u2019s favor.\n\nBitcoin open-source development is under the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT's) open-source license. Because open-source software is generally available to anyone, anywhere, assigning fiduciary duty to developers could lead to a situation where someone in one country is liable for damages to someone in another simply because they contributed to an open-source project. Current law, explained Jonas, is meant to protect open-source developers from being sued by strangers:\n\n\u201cThey are volunteering their time to work on public infrastructure. They\u2019re doing it for free. They\u2019re doing it under MIT license, which is supposed to protect them from things like this.\u201d\n\nMagazine: Coinbase screws up, Florida bans CBDCs, and Ordinals face controversy"

CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images\n\nThe US dollar has been the world's reserve currency since the second world war, playing a crucial role in the world's trade.\n\nBut countries globally are now lining up backup currencies for trade, as sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine have led to some prominent world leaders and business figures sounding a warning over the power Washington \u2014 and the US dollar \u2014 wields.\n\nSanctioned countries like Russia and emerging nations like Argentina have recently started using the Chinese yuan for trade, primarily with China.\n\nEven so, there's no indication the dollar's dominance could fade in the foreseeable future, simply because the currency is such an integral part of the world economy, Insider's Jennifer Sor reported on May 6.\n\nThe dollar is by far the world's most dominant reserve currency \u2014 meaning a large quantity of a foreign currency held by central banks and major financial institutes for their use from investments to payments.\n\nIn 1999, over 70% of the world's foreign exchange reserves were held in the US dollar.\n\nBut that percentage has been dropping \u2014 the dollar's share in global foreign exchange reserves fell to under 60% in the fourth quarter of 2021, the International Monetary Fund, or IMF, said in a June 2022 blog post.\n\nAnd despite accounting for the lion's share, or 54%, of global foreign exchange reserves in the fourth quarter of 2022, there has been a decline in the dollar's share of the total foreign reserve pie, per IMF data.\n\nBut this doesn't mean America's strategic competitors \u2014 like China \u2014 wouldn't stop challenging American hegemony.

We\u2019ve also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this article began. According to Wikipedia, a cryptocurrency is \u201ca digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.\u201d\n\nBitcoin was the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Ether is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three with its launch in July 2015.\n\nThe third-largest market share of cryptocurrency, tether, is a token \u201cbacked by actual assets\u201d which includes one US dollar, one euro, or loans to affiliate companies and is controlled by the owners of Bitfinex. It\u2019s a controversial cryptocurrency due to its alleged manipulation of crypto pricing. It is called a \u201cstable coin\u201d because it was designed to always be worth $1.00. We do not chart it because its price rarely changes.\n\nXRP, which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We\u2019ve included it here for reference.\n\nThe Latest Data (through May 16, 2023)\n\nBitcoin continued its decline this past week, dropping below $27,000 for the first time in almost 2 months. Despite the second consecutive weekly fall, Bitcoin is up ~63% year-to-date.\n\nXRP fell to $0.42 during this past week, its lowest level since the end of March, and is currently up ~26% year-to-date.\n\nEther (ETH) fell below $1,800 for the first time since the beginning of April during this past week. Despite the decline, ETH is up ~51% year-to-date.\n\nI have also created an index in order to chart these together given their very different pricing history. Ether tops the chart \u2013 the price of an ether has changed the most out of all three cryptocurrencies.\n\nETFs associated with cryptocurrencies include: ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) and ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITI).\n\nOriginally published on Advisor Perspectives.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel."

These contracts obligate the buyer to purchase or the seller to sell Bitcoin at a predetermined price on a specific future date. Unlike trading Bitcoin \u2014 which involves owning and holding the digital asset itself \u2014 Bitcoin futures enable traders to speculate on the price of Bitcoin without directly owning it.\n\nInitially intended for the first fund, the suggestive ticker was reportedly modified by the firm in October 2021.\n\nIn contrast to the firm\u2019s existing block trading facility (BTF) fund, this newly proposed fund will offer leverage, allowing speculators to increase their exposure to the dominant cryptocurrency. A BTF is an actively managed ETF available through Nasdaq that invests primarily in Bitcoin futures contracts.\n\nUp to this point, the market has witnessed the introduction of four distinct Bitcoin futures-based ETFs. The first, ProShares Bitcoin Futures ETF, was launched in October 2021.\n\nThus far, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has denied several attempts to introduce Bitcoin spot ETFs or funds that provide direct exposure to the dominant cryptocurrency, citing concerns regarding potential market manipulation in the Bitcoin market.\n\nRelated: Breaking: Court victory for Ripple as judge denies SEC motion to seal Hinman docs\n\nDigital asset manager Grayscale is currently involved in a prolonged legal dispute with the SEC as it seeks to transform its struggling Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a Bitcoin spot ETF. The investment firm criticized the SEC\u2019s decision to authorize futures-based ETFs instead of spot ETFs, deeming it \u201cillogical.\u201c\n\nIn March, the judges presiding over the dispute between the two entities in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit expressed the view that the SEC \u201cmust provide a thorough explanation\u201d regarding its understanding of the connection between Bitcoin futures and the spot price of Bitcoin.\n\nMagazine: Ordinals turned Bitcoin into a worse version of Ethereum: Can we fix it?"

        "content": "In the exciting landscape of crypto, each token takes a different approach. Bitcoin (BTC), Ripple (XRP) and a new meme coin, DogeMiyagi (MIYAGI), have captured the attention of investors with their unique supply strategies. They each take a distinctive approach to fueling excitement and potential growth.\n\nBitcoin: The Scarcity-Driven Model\n\nBitcoin kickstarted the entire crypto revolution, introducing a completely new financial system. Built on the belief that scarcity breeds value, Bitcoin\u2019s total supply is strictly capped at 21 million tokens. This digital gold relies on miners to confirm transactions and earn Bitcoin for securing the network.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s supply is regulated through a halving process which happens every four years and reduces the reward for mining Bitcoin by 50%. As demand surges and the token becomes rarer, the price tends to skyrocket. The last halving occurred in 2020 and boosted Bitcoin\u2019s price by 19% compared to the year before. The next halving event is scheduled for April 2024, and crypto enthusiasts anticipate an even bigger price surge.\n\nRipple: The Controlled Supply\n\nXRP, Ripple\u2019s digital asset, was designed to create faster and cheaper transactions. Unlike Bitcoin, XRP was not designed to be mined. Instead, the token\u2019s maximum supply is capped at 100 billion, 80 billion of which was gifted to Ripple by its founders.\n\n55 billion tokens were then placed in an escrow account for controlled release. Ripple periodically sells XRP to fund operations and promote its technology, growth and stability. This structure also allows XRP to complete more transactions at a faster and cheaper rate.\n\nDogeMiyagi: The Transparency-Driven Supply Strategy\n\nDogeMiyagi is a new meme coin with a focus on both entertainment and utility, and while meme coins often come and go in the market, this one is here to stay. With a total supply of 96,192,515,112,011 tokens, this project has divided its allocation wisely. DogeMiyagi has garnered attention for its focus on community involvement and its commitment to transparency.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe majority (60%) is dedicated to the presale, allowing the community to join in on the action early and benefit from the project\u2019s continued growth. 24% will then be saved for exchanges, 6% for the referral program, 5% for the team, which is locked for 2 years and 5% for marketing which is locked for one year.\n\nDogeMiyagi has also orchestrated a burn schedule for each stage of the presale. There will be 6 burn events in total, each representing one of the Karate Kid films. In a fitting tribute, just before launch, the largest token burn will take place, representing the death of the beloved Mr Miyagi at the age of 86 years and 5 months, burning 86,050,000,000,000.00 tokens.\n\nCryptocurrencies all have different approaches to their supply strategies, and Bitcoin and Ripple have been some of the most successful so far, driving scarcity and prolonged growth. DogeMiyagi is strategically balancing meme coin culture, community and utility, providing a fresh take on crypto meme coins. The project\u2019s supply model is designed to propagate growth for the coin and benefit every community member.\n\nFor more about DogeMiyagi:\n\nWebsite: https://dogemiyagi.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogemiyagi_\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/dogemiyagi"

        "title": "Who are the biggest Bitcoin whales in the world - CNBCTV18",
        "content": "Several factors can affect the price of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. For instance, Bitcoin whales play a pivotal role in influencing the market to a large extent. Whenever these whales buy or sell assets, it often creates a market stir, which is closely observed by other players. At times, whale purchases can push Bitcoin\u2019s price to higher levels, while whale offloading can do the opposite.\n\nIn simple terms, Bitcoin whales refer to individuals, governments, exchanges, companies, and institutions that hold a significant number of bitcoins. Some of these Bitcoin whales have now become influencers, and people often seek their expertise to understand market sentiment. Let's take a look at some of the biggest Bitcoin whales currently in existence.\n\nIndividual Bitcoin Whales\n\nThe pseudonymous founder of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, currently has 1 million BTCs in his kitty (worth around $27 billion at present), making him one of the biggest Bitcoin whales in the world. Surprisingly, he hasn't moved a single penny since he first mined these bitcoins. If he/she ever decides to move this massive stash of Bitcoin, it\u2019s likely that the market would respond to the event.\n\nThe founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group (DCG), Barry Silbert, was an early Bitcoin adopter. In an interview with Reuters in 2017, he said that he had about $175,000 worth of bitcoin in 2012 and that he paid about $11 a bitcoin. Considering how much the market has evolved, he surely made a lucrative deal.\n\nHe founded the DCG group in 2013, which consists of five crypto-focused companies that invest in crypto startups. Over the years, the companies have accumulated around $28 billion worth of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) also holds large amounts of Bitcoin, obtained from seized properties. They auction the seized bitcoin to interested buyers, and Barry Silbert happens to be among them. He bought 48,000 bitcoins from the FBI in 2013.\n\nRoger Ver is another well-known Bitcoin whale. Popularly known as \u2018Bitcoin Jesus\u201d, Ver owns around 335,000 bitcoins. He has invested in various crypto projects, including Ripple, bitcoinstore.com, Kraken, and more, over the course of many years. The multi-millionaire Bitcoin proponent has been interested in the king coin since early 2011, and has even called it one of the most important inventions in the history of humankind.\n\nCorporates\u2019 Largest Bitcoin wallets\n\nOne of the largest centralized crypto exchanges, Coinbase, holds around 2 million bitcoin worth $53 billion as of May 18, 2023. Meanwhile, Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, owns a 19 percent stake in Coinbase, which technically makes him a big Bitcoin whale as well.\n\nBinance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange by volume, is also one of the biggest Bitcoin whales in the market. The Binance wallet holds 248,597 bitcoins, worth over $6 billion at current prices. The same represents almost 1.3 percent of Bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply.\n\nAnalytics software company Microstrategy reportedly holds 140,000 bitcoins, and its CEO Michael J. Saylor, who is also a crypto influencer, revealed in 2021 that he privately held 17,732 bitcoins. The company's Q1 2023 report disclosed a net income of $94 million and additional purchases of 7,500 Bitcoins. The 140,000 Bitcoins it owns were collectively acquired at an average cost of roughly $29,800, as per the Q1 2023 report. Based on current market prices, Microstrategy\u2019s Bitcoin holdings are valued at $3.7 billion.\n\nGovernment Bitcoin Holdings\n\nReportedly, the European country of Bulgaria holds 213,000 bitcoins, which were seized by local authorities from a criminal group in 2017. At the time of the seizure, the value of the bitcoins was around $500. The same is now it is worth over $5 billion. However, what remains unclear is what the country plans on doing with its BTC holdings.\n\nAs of March 25, 2023, the US government held 205,515 confiscated bitcoins worth $5.6 billion, which is about 1.06 percent of the coin\u2019s circulating supply. Glassnode on-chain data revealed that on March 9, about 9,860 bitcoins were sent to Coinbase addresses. The US government\u2019s bitcoin stockpile accumulated through various seizures, including the Silk Road bitcoin seizure in 2020, the Bitfinex hack, and the James Zhong case related to illicit Silk Road transactions.\n\nCentral American country, El Salvador, made history in September 2021 by becoming the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. The country has known to purchase Bitcoin at regular intervals, even during market dips. As of June 2022, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele announced via a tweet that the country currently holds around 2,301 bitcoins. At current market prices, these BTC\u2019s are worth around $61.6 million.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the US government\u2019s confiscated bitcoin holding may not of much importance here since it is auctioned away, the accumulation of massive amounts of bitcoins by individuals and companies demonstrates the growing popularity of the digital asset.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that when bitcoin is concentrated in one address and crypto whales continue to increase, it can create disparity in the market. Critics argue that these large crypto wallets control other players, giving them a disproportionate amount of influence and leaving other participants with less control over the market.\n\nUntil a comprehensive assessment is released, whether Bitcoin whales are a blessing or a burden to the industry is essentially a matter of personal choice."

Discover SCENE\n\nBlock co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey\u2014also co-founder and former CEO of Twitter\u2014led a $6 million seed funding round for Bitcoin payments firm Azteco, the startup announced today.\n\nAzteco offers a unique way to buy Bitcoin worldwide with a focus on making it easier for unbanked populations to use the digital money. Users either buy an Azteco voucher online or at a local, brick-and-mortar store, which they can then redeem for Bitcoin. The model works similar to buying a gift card or a mobile phone top-up.\n\nSince users don't have to go through an exchange to purchase Bitcoin in their native currency, this method provides users more flexibility and has come to be known in Bitcoin circles as a project with the potential to help bank the unbanked.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDay 17 of redeeming Bitcoin through @Azteco_ for 21 days straight! R1 gets you Bitcoin worth around 178 sats.

We have the technology and resources to close this gap, but until now, no one has taken that important next step,\u201d Dorsey said. \u201cAzteco is providing so much more than just access to a secure financial system; it is building an ecosystem of financial self-determination that is secure and supported by local communities.\u201d\n\nAlong with Dorsey, investors include Lightning Ventures, Hivemind Ventures, Ride Wave Ventures, Aleka Capital, Visary Capital, Gaingels, and serial entrepreneur Sunil Rajaraman.\n\n\"More than two billion people worldwide lack access to any financial services, facing significant challenges managing, storing, and transferring money and accessing credit,\u201d Azteco founder and CEO Alexander \"Akin\" Fernandez told Decrypt. \u201cThese individuals, many living in countries with untrustworthy and volatile economies, need alternative, independent solutions that provide financial inclusion and long-term stability.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUsers can purchase vouchers in 195 countries. Azteco plans to use the fresh funding to flesh out its product and expand its offerings in Latin America and Europe.\n\nSome users have also described the potential of \"no KYC\" Bitcoin, where users don't have to provide identifying \u201cknow your customer\u201d information in order to buy Bitcoin. Since only small amounts of Bitcoin can be purchased with Azteco, governmental KYC laws do not apply in those jurisdictions that the company operates in.\n\n\u201cAzteco is bringing vouchers for small amounts of Bitcoin to the masses who need it most,\u201d Fernandez said. \u201cAs an alternative to traditional currencies and bank accounts, Bitcoin enables financial self-determination, putting people in control of their finances with privacy and security.\u201d\n\nEditor's Note: This story has been updated to correct the attribution of Azteco founder and CEO Alexander \"Akin\" Fernandez's comments."

        "title": "Bitcoin Network Usage Drops, But That May Not Be a Bad Thing - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Daily unique transactions on the Bitcoin network have seen a significant drop.\n\nDespite this fall, the reduction could provide an impetus for development.\n\nThe Lightning Network promises to solve Bitcoin\u2019s scaling problems.\n\nScalability issues remain the bane of most major blockchain networks, most recently, Bitcoin. The biggest crypto has seen a drop in network usage as it continues to struggle with network congestion.\n\nOn Thursday, May 18, the number of unique addresses performing transactions daily dropped to less than 800k. This marks a 22-month low for Bitcoin, the lowest level since July 2022.\n\nHowever, this drop might not necessarily signal the decline of Bitcoin\u2019s utility. As scaling solutions increase in popularity, Bitcoin\u2019s Network could naturally see a drop in activity.\n\nLightning Could Ease Bitcoin\u2019s Congestion Issues\n\nThe drop in unique daily transactions doesn\u2019t account for transactions via the Lightning Network, Bitcoin\u2019s Layer-2. For some, this scaling solution holds the keys to making Bitcoin transactions faster and cheaper.\n\nWith the growing popularity of scaling solutions, Bitcoin\u2019s congestion issues could be relieved. This would, however, likely result in a natural decrease in the base layer\u2019s transaction activity as more users migrate to second-layer solutions.\n\nStill, the recent drop in transactions on the Bitcoin network has not been accompanied by a corresponding activity on the Lightning Network. This indicates that, despite its advantages, Lightning Network still has hurdles before it can reach mass adoption.\n\nFor instance, technical challenges, such as routing issues and channel capacity constraints, have been a sticking point for some users. Furthermore, setting up a Lightning node can be daunting for non-technical users, posing another barrier to widespread adoption.\n\nBitcoin Struggling With Ordinals\n\nThis sudden decrease in unique transactions is likely due to the rise of ordinals. These inscriptions, Bitcoin\u2019s answer to Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), are becoming increasingly popular. However, their popularity comes at a price, helping escalate the network\u2019s gas fees.\n\nAs gas prices continue to climb, more and more users start avoiding transactions that are not necessary. This is likely the reason behind the noticeable reduction in overall network activity.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nIn May, Litecoin hit a record amount of transactions thanks to rising fees and congestion on the Bitcoin network.\n\nThe Bitcoin community is not in agreement with how to deal with ordinals. In May, one core developer\u2019s suggestion to ban ordinals started a civil war in the community.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nBitcoin\u2019s scaling issues could significantly impact the dominant crypto in the future. As the community tackles the scaling issues, it is crucial to understand how they impact the network.\n\nRead more about how Lightning can tackle the ordinals issue:\n\nHow Lightning Network\u2019s Taproot Upgrade Solves BRC-20 Issues\n\nRead about the latest trends in the retail use of DeFi:\n\nUniswap Survey Uncovers DeFi Barriers, but Users Keen to Experiment"

        "title": "Crypto trading should be treated like a type of gambling, influential MPs say - Sky News",
        "content": "An influential panel of MPs has called on the government to regulate consumer crypto trading and speculation as a type of gambling.\n\nThe cross-party Treasury Committee claimed digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ether have \"no intrinsic value and no useful social purpose\" - and as well as consuming large amounts of energy, they are often used by criminals for scams.\n\nIt comes after the government announced proposals in February to regulate the crypto industry by bringing it under financial services law.\n\nBut MPs said a better approach would be to recognise how speculation in unbacked cryptoassets - like Bitcoin - \"more closely resembles gambling than a financial service\".\n\nIt recommended that safeguarding rules which oversee the likes of lotteries, betting firms and casinos should apply instead.\n\nAround 10% of UK adults have speculated in cryptoassets, according to HM Revenue and Customs.\n\nThe committee's new report warned digital currencies are a \"significant risk\" due to \"huge\" price volatility, with the potential for customers to lose everything they invest.\n\nIt said there was evidence that addictions to cryptocurrency speculation were on the rise - and warned there are limited controls currently in place to protect vulnerable consumers.\n\nMPs said they were concerned that bringing the industry under financial service regulation \"will create a 'halo' effect that leads consumers to believe that this activity is safer than it is, or protected when it is not\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We therefore strongly recommend that the government regulates retail trading and investment activity in unbacked cryptoassets as gambling rather than as a financial service, consistent with its stated principle of 'same risk, same regulatory outcome,'\" the report added.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:14 What is the main aim of cryptocurrency?\n\nA 'Wild West' industry\n\nIt comes after a 2018 report by the committee described the cryptocurrency industry as a \"Wild West\" - with MPs saying nothing in their subsequent enquiries had moved them to alter that verdict.\n\nFollowing the new report, committee chair, Conservative MP Harriett Baldwin, said: \"Effective regulation is clearly needed to protect consumers from harm, as well as to support productive innovation in the UK's financial services industry.\n\n\"However, with no intrinsic value, huge price volatility and no discernible social good, consumer trading of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin more closely resembles gambling than a financial service, and should be regulated as such.\"\n\nThe MPs said they still felt there was potential in the technology - such as by improving the efficiency and costs of making payments - and advised the government to take a \"balanced approach\" in supporting innovation.\n\nThe committee added it was separately considering the potential role of digital currencies backed by central banks.\n\nMeanwhile its report also criticised the government's attempt in April 2022 to launch a non-fungible token (NFT) - a type of cryptocurrency asset - through the Royal Mint. The plan was dropped earlier this year following a review.\n\nMPs said the government \"should seek to avoid expending public resources on supporting cryptoasset activities without a clear, beneficial use case\".\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 5:26 Is the crypto crisis over?\n\nCrypto 'offers opportunities'\n\nIt comes as the government considers responses to a consultation into its regulation proposals.\n\nA Treasury spokesperson indicated ministers would likely reject the committee's recommendation.\n\nThey told Sky News: \"Risks posed by crypto are typical of those that exist in traditional financial services and it's financial services regulation - rather than gambling regulation - that has the track record in mitigating them.\n\n\"Crypto offers opportunities but we are taking an agile approach to robustly regulating the market, addressing the most pressing risks first in a way that promotes innovation.\"\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nThe report comes amid growing pressure on governments around the world to better regulate the industry, heightened by the sudden bankruptcy of crypto platform FTX in November.\n\nSome 80,000 UK-based customers were impacted by the collapse, and one British investor was left with a \u00a31m hole in his finances.\n\nThe European Union this week approved tougher cryptoasset rules - including new powers to ban exchanges that fail to protect consumers.\n\nThe International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), whose members include regulators in the US and UK, said it will also soon announce proposals for the first ever set of global rules covering crypto trading."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is garnering attention from top crypto analysts who are expressing bullish sentiments and predicting a potential parabolic surge for the cryptocurrency.\n\nRenowned crypto strategist Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, followed by over 656,700 Twitter users, is observing positive signs for Bitcoin on the weekly chart. Despite a retreat from the significant psychological resistance at $30,000, Bitcoin continues to trade above two critical technical indicators on the weekly timeframe. Van de Poppe believes that the digital asset\u2019s upward momentum will persist, leading it towards the price range of $38,000 to $42,000.\n\n#Bitcoin breaks upwards and tests $27,600.\n\n\n\nGood signs.\n\n\n\nWeekly timeframe; Holding 200 MA and EMA.\n\n\n\nI think we're continuing towards $38,000-42,000 from here. pic.twitter.com/gduHkOFUHu \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) May 15, 2023\n\nAnother respected crypto analyst, Kaleo, who has a Twitter following of 587,400, shares the bullish sentiment. Kaleo suggests that Bitcoin\u2019s recent reclaiming of support around $27,000 sets the stage for a potential rally to fresh yearly highs. The analyst sees this as a promising risk/reward long setup, with a target of $40,000, which still holds a magnetic appeal.\n\n#Bitcoin / $BTC\n\n\n\nI\u2019m a fan of this breakdown / reclaim.

Bluntz believes that Bitcoin\u2019s corrective move from $30,000 has likely concluded and anticipates a resumption of the cryptocurrency\u2019s upward trend. Noting the emergence of favorable follow-through candles on the daily chart, Bluntz suggests that new all-time highs may be within reach if the recent three-wave ABC correction is indeed complete. The sentiment in the market has shifted, with many now expecting further upside instead of anticipating more downside.\n\nstarting to get some nice follow through candles on daily for #btc after fridays reversal.\n\n\n\nif this was a 3 wave abc down complete then new highs are potentially on the table.\n\n\n\nsentiment does seem to have flipped down here with many expecting further downside now pic.twitter.com/gAOZuFJ9ha \u2014 Bluntz (@Bluntz_Capital) May 15, 2023\n\nWith multiple prominent analysts expressing optimism for Bitcoin\u2019s future trajectory, market participants and observers are closely monitoring the cryptocurrency\u2019s price movements. The possibility of a parabolic surge in Bitcoin remains an exciting prospect as the crypto market continues to evolve and captivate the attention of investors worldwide."

        "title": "Pepe the frog takes over Bitcoin 2023 with Picasso-inspired mural - The Block",
        "content": "What a difference a year makes. Last year, when Bitcoin was over $40,000, a giant metal bull greeted visitors to the annual Bitcoin conference in Miami, proclaiming that the \u201cfuture of finance\u201d had arrived. A year later, and well into a fresh crypto winter, Pepe seems to have taken over.\n\nIn the first day of the three-day event, the mood was somewhat subdued as crowds trickled in to hear panel discussions such as \u201cThe Fed vs. The Financial System,\u201d \u201cFighting the Anti-Crypto Army\u201d and \u201cBitcoin & The Banking Crisis.\u201d The mood was serious, yet hopeful. But the real star of the show was Pepe, whose omnipresence coincides with the memecoin that caused a frenzy when it hit the market in mid-April.\n\nOff to the side of the large expo hall at the conference, an art gallery featured both physical and digital art, some of which could be purchased in an ongoing auction using bitcoin.\n\nThe show stopper is a massive, 21-panel mural that pays meme homage to Picasso\u2019s Guernica, the famed 1937 oil painting that became a symbol of the Spanish Civil War. Dubbed Pepernica, the painting by artist Luis Simo is over 11 feet tall and 25 feet long. The current bid is 5.5 millions sats, or nearly $1,500.\n\nSimo, a 27-year-old visual artist based in Valencia, Spain, said the mural took him about a month and a half to paint. He said he first had the idea after attending the Bitcoin conference last year and had been inspired by the subsequent crypto market crash and the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"Memes are a reoccurring part of the art world,\" he said in an interview. \"If you go to museums and galleries in the U.S. and Europe, you'll easily see memes. But to introduce memes from Crypto Twitter into physical art and installations, that's just getting started.\"\n\n\"It would be great if it goes to someone with the space to exhibit it,\" Simo continued, adding that he thought a hotel would be the perfect place for the work. He plans to keep the bitcoin he receives from the sale.\n\nAnother work by Simo called \u201cLas Pepinas\u201d is an original oil painting that memes Diego Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s Las Meninas (The Ladies-in-Waiting). Winners of the works will also receive NFTs minted on Counterparty.\n\nLas Pepinas\n\nOther Pepe-themed works at the show included Pepe-ized pop art \u201cPlans for the Dollar\u201d and \"Oswald\u2019s Diary.\" The Indipepe series by artist JB is a memed derivative of Robert Indiana's famous \"LOVE\" work that \u201cseamlessly integrates the iconic Pepe the Frog into the annals of art history.\u201d\n\nTo bid on the art, you have to deposit 1% of your bid as collateral, or 0.02 BTC for unlimited bids.\n\nPepe as Love\n\nThe gallery was not without digital art, and an \u201cOrdinals Alley\u201d displayed some of the earliest and most prominent Bitcoin Ordinals that have taken the sector by storm. Pepe was also there.\n\nPepe shoes\n\nArt wasn\u2019t the only thing for sale, with the event also featuring a peer-to-peer Bitcoin Bazaar where you could buy Bitcoin related items.\n\n(Updates with comment from artist in fifth paragraph.)"

        "title": "How Bitcoin Pizza Came into Existence - Tekedia",
        "content": "Bitcoin is a revolutionary digital currency that has changed the way people transact and store value. But do you know how it all started? One of the most iconic events in Bitcoin\u2019s history is the Bitcoin Pizza Day, which marks the first time someone used Bitcoin to buy a real-world good.\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day is a reminder of how far Bitcoin has come from its humble beginnings to its current status as a global phenomenon. It is also a celebration of the innovation and creativity of the Bitcoin community, which continues to push the boundaries of what is possible with this technology.\n\nThe story goes back to May 22, 2010, when a Florida programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz posted on a Bitcoin forum that he was willing to pay 10,000 bitcoins for two pizzas delivered to his house. He wrote: \u201cI\u2019ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas\u2026 like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later.\u201d\n\nAt that time, Bitcoin was still a new and obscure technology, with no established market value or widespread adoption. Hanyecz had mined some bitcoins on his computer, but he had no idea what to do with them. He thought it would be cool to exchange them for something tangible, like food.\n\nLuckily, someone took up his offer and agreed to order two pizzas from Papa John\u2019s and deliver them to Hanyecz in exchange for 10,000 bitcoins. The pizzas cost about $30, which means Hanyecz paid around $0.003 per bitcoin. The person who accepted the deal was a British man named Jeremy Sturdivant, who went by the nickname \u201cjercos\u201d on the forum.\n\nThe transaction was completed and Hanyecz posted a picture of the pizzas on the forum, confirming that he had received them. He wrote: \u201cI just want to report that I successfully traded 10,000 bitcoins for pizza. Thanks jercos!\u201d\n\nThe event was recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain as transaction hash ID a1075db55d416d3ca199f55b6084e2115b9345e16c5cf302fc80e9d5fbf5d48d.\n\nLittle did Hanyecz know that his pizza order would go down in history as the first documented case of Bitcoin being used to purchase a physical good. The day of the transaction, May 22, is now celebrated as Bitcoin Pizza Day by the Bitcoin community around the world.\n\nThe significance of Bitcoin Pizza Day is not only that it demonstrated the potential of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, but also that it showed how much Bitcoin has appreciated in value over time. The 10,000 bitcoins that Hanyecz spent on the pizzas are now worth over $200 million at the current market price of around $20,000 per bitcoin.\n\nThe value of the 10,000 bitcoins used in the transaction has also skyrocketed over time, reaching hundreds of millions of dollars at current prices. This makes the pizzas arguably the most expensive ones ever bought in history. However, Hanyecz does not regret his decision and has said that he enjoyed the pizzas and was happy to be part of the early days of bitcoin.\n\nThat means Hanyecz paid about $10 million per pizza, making them the most expensive pizzas ever bought. Of course, Hanyecz did not regret his decision, as he later said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like Bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool.\u201d\n\nThe bitcoin pizza transaction has become part of the folklore of cryptocurrency and is celebrated every year on May 22 as Bitcoin Pizza Day. On this day, bitcoin enthusiasts around the world commemorate the event by buying goods (often pizza) with bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Some also use the occasion to reflect on how far bitcoin has come since its inception and how much potential it still has.\n\nThe bitcoin pizza transaction may seem trivial today, but it was a milestone in the history of cryptocurrency. It demonstrated that bitcoin could be used as a medium of exchange for goods and services, not just as a store of value or a speculative asset. It also showed that bitcoin could facilitate cross-border transactions without intermediaries or fees. Moreover, it inspired other people to experiment with using bitcoin for everyday purchases and created a sense of community among early adopters.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"
