        "title": "The bitcoin bounce: what comes next? - The Associated Press",
        "content": "Markets this year are roiling, uncertainty abounds and the U.S. government has had to step in to rescue two large American banks in recent days. So why is bitcoin, considered among the riskiest bets of them all, rising so fast?\n\nJust months ago, all forms of cryptocurrency appeared to be going up in flames, with bitcoin plunging from almost $50,000 at the start of 2022, to less than $17,000 when 2023 rolled around.\n\nBitcoin has since soared more than 60% and it climbed another 8% Friday above $27,000, all in an era of mass layoffs in the tech sector and widespread anxiety about stability in the U.S. banking sector.\n\nSo what happened?\n\nThe pandemic was an era of massive growth for both technology companies and crypto. That surge began to wane in late 2021 as people began to travel, go out to restaurants or catch a show. They spent much less time in front of screens and at the same time, the government stimulus checks that allowed people some financial cushion began to run out. Crypto began to fall in tandem with technology. On top of that, in March 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve began an aggressive string of rate hikes, its most powerful weapon to fight inflation, which had begun to rise rapidly.\n\nThat put bitcoin prices in freefall. Higher interest rates mean that safe assets like Treasurys become more attractive to investors because their yields have increased, dulling the shine of high-growth companies and other assets that carry more risk. That includes bitcoin.\n\nYet economic data earlier this year seemed to suggest that inflation had peaked, raising the chance that the Fed would ease off on rate hikes, and that was the start of bitcoin\u2019s bounce.\n\nHow did the recent bank collapses play into all of this?\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank actually fueled investments in bitcoin. In the eyes of Wall Street, a shaky financial system lowered the odds even further that the Fed could continue raising rates, as had been the prevailing expectation as recently as the start of last week, before Silicon Valley Bank blew up.\n\n\u201cAs the economy heads towards a recession, the cryptoverse could look more attractive than equities,\u201d wrote Edward Moya of Oanda in a research report. \u201cIt appears the downside risks are greater for the S&P 500 than they are for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nIf an investor on Jan. 1 put $100 into bitcoin and $100 in an S&P 500 index fund, the bitcoin investment would have returned $60, compared with a $2 return on the S&P bet.\n\nSo will bitcoin keep rising?\n\nAll eyes now turn to the Federal Reserve, which meets next week and will make a decision on what to do about its benchmark interest rate.\n\nWhat the Fed does may not matter at all as far as bitcoin investors are concerned.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde when it comes to how it reacts to Fed rate expectations,\u201d Moya said. \u201cFor most of last year, higher Treasury yields alongside rising Fed rate hike expectations spelled trouble for Bitcoin. Fed rate cut bets are good news for cryptos, but a severe recession should prove troubling for all risky assets, including bitcoin.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin (BTC): The Birth of Cryptocurrency and the Blockchain Revolution - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has been given plenty of names in its lifetime. Digital Gold, The Future of Money, even \u2018The Biggest Ponzi Scheme in Human History.\u2019 Over a decade has passed since Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin Whitepaper. Despite bitcoin price volatility and what its naysayers would have you believe, Bitcoin is here to stay.\n\nNot only has Bitcoin stood the test of time, the world\u2019s largest digital asset also inspired a technological revolution. Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are re-inventing how we store our funds and manage our finances online in a way that traditional systems, like central banks, cannot replicate.\n\nDecentralized and fully open-source, the bitcoin network has given people greater control over their finances than ever before. It blazed the trail for other digital currencies, like Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP), to innovate and improve. While it\u2019s more often considered a store of value than a currency these days, Bitcoin is still the centerpiece of the crypto market.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin? What is bitcoin mining and Proof-of-Work? Will Bitcoin always be king, or is it possible that altcoins like Ether or BNB will siphon BTC\u2019s market cap and take its place at the top?\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a kind of digital asset that\u2019s used in the same way as fiat currencies like USD. With BTC, users can pay for goods and services and send funds to friends and family using a decentralized, peer-to-peer network.\n\nSounds like normal money, right?\n\nNot really.\n\nFiat currencies, such as the USD or EUR, are controlled and governed by centralized bodies. They\u2019re often stored in central banks that can deny users access to their funds. If I want to transfer fiat currency to someone, I must trust an intermediary to settle the payment. This third party could block the transfer or charge me extortionate fees for their services.\n\nOn the other hand, bitcoin transactions are trustless and permissionless. Nothing stops me from using the bitcoin blockchain and sending BTC directly to a friend or business over the network. Moreover, I can watch the transaction in real-time by tracking it transparently on-chain.\n\nHow does it all work, then? If there\u2019s no intermediary to settle the payment, what ensures that bitcoin transactions are processed?\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Work?\n\nThe bitcoin network is powered by miners and a unique algorithm called the Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism. Bitcoin miners are responsible for processing transactions on the blockchain and producing, or \u2018mining\u2019 new blocks. Simply put, a block is a unit of data on the blockchain that records previous transactions.\n\nIn the Proof-of-Work mechanism, miners compete to produce new blocks. Using intensive computational power, Miners solve complex puzzles using cryptography. Miners earn BTC as a reward for solving these puzzles, which process bitcoin transactions and create new blocks for the network.\n\nAnother thing separating Bitcoin from traditional fiat currencies is that BTC has a fixed max supply of 21 million coins. This makes BTC immune to inflation and is one of the main reasons many investors consider BTC a store of value and a hedge against inflation.\n\nBitcoin miner rewards slowly diminish over time through a process called Bitcoin halving. After every 210,000 blocks, the amount of BTC distributed to miners is cut in half. When BTC was first launched in 2009, every new block released 50 BTC into the circulating supply. However, following the third halving in May 2020, these rewards have been reduced to just 6.25 BTC per block.\n\nWhat Can Bitcoin Be Used for?\n\nThe bitcoin network was originally designed to be a decentralized peer-to-peer payment network. As a result, it\u2019s most commonly used to send and receive funds anonymously over the internet. However, BTC has grown beyond its initial use cases and is now considered a store of value, like gold. This makes it a popular investment vehicle for speculators.\n\nAs blockchain technology evolves, BTC is witnessing greater adoption and utility. El Salvador recognizes BTC as a legal tender, and businesses worldwide accept bitcoin payments in exchange for goods and services. Even publicly traded, NASDAQ-listed companies like Tesla hold BTC, and other altcoins like DOGE, on their balance sheets.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, innovation across the cryptocurrency industry continues to bring further use cases to Bitcoin. For example, BTC can be wrapped and deployed onto other blockchain ecosystems. This means that bitcoin\u2019s value and liquidity can be used in DeFi apps on Ethereum.\n\nWith the rise of Ordinals, the Bitcoin blockchain hosts its own NFTs. These ordinal NFTs exist on the Bitcoin network, denominating their value in BTC price. At the beginning of 2023, Ordinal trading volume brought renewed attention and fresh eyes to the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin Pros & Cons\n\nObjectively, Bitcoin is far from perfect. While it provides a secure, transparent, and decentralized payment network available to anyone with an internet connection, the bitcoin blockchain still has drawbacks.\n\nBitcoin Pros\n\nDecentralized \u2013 The bitcoin network has no centralized owner or governance. Moreover, the blockchain is distributed, meaning the network will remain fully functional even if large mining operations unexpectedly collapse.\n\n\u2013 The bitcoin network has no centralized owner or governance.

The entire protocol is open-source, meaning anyone can verify its source code to ensure the network is safe.\n\nBitcoin Cons\n\nEnergy Consumption \u2013 One of bitcoin\u2019s biggest criticisms is that it requires enormous computational power. Analysts like the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index estimate that over a year, the bitcoin network uses as much energy as Kazakhstan and expels a carbon footprint comparable to Portugal.\n\n\u2013 One of bitcoin\u2019s biggest criticisms is that it requires enormous computational power.

Scalability Issues \u2013 While the Bitcoin blockchain is faster and more affordable than traditional banking, competing blockchain payment networks like Ripple have developed far more scalable systems. While Bitcoin processes around 4-5 transactions per second, Ripple handles over 1,000, with reduced fees.\n\n\u2013 While the Bitcoin blockchain is faster and more affordable than traditional banking, competing blockchain payment networks like Ripple have developed far more scalable systems. While Bitcoin processes around 4-5 transactions per second, Ripple handles over 1,000, with reduced fees. Price Volatility \u2013 If you\u2019ve spent time in the crypto market, you\u2019ll understand that bitcoin prices are prone to unexpected drops and surges. These prices affect Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization, and this volatility makes it difficult to use BTC as a currency of exchange.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Mysterious Beginnings\n\nThe Global Financial Crisis of 2008 wreaked havoc on economies worldwide. Central banks and financial institutions were in critical debt after a sudden housing market crash destroyed the value of their assets. Governments were forced to bail out overleveraged banks and institutions, and the resulting credit crunch broke the global economy.\n\nIn 2008, Bitcoin\u2019s anonymous founder, or group of founders, published the Bitcoin whitepaper. Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s iconic document has become a manifesto for crypto enthusiasts. In just a few months, the Bitcoin network was launched. Nakamoto themself mined the first block, immortalizing a significant line of text into the blockchain forever: \u201cThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\u201d\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto continued to contribute to the bitcoin project. However, in 2011 the enigmatic founder confirmed in an email to a friend that he\u2019d moved on from Bitcoin. He remains anonymous, though it is widely accepted he is the world\u2019s largest BTC holder.\n\nThe Future of Bitcoin\n\nDespite Nakamoto\u2019s disappearance, the bitcoin community has continued to develop the network to keep up with the growth of the wider blockchain industry. Their primary adjective is to increase the network\u2019s scalability without sacrificing its decentralization.\n\nWith the uprising of smart contracts and decentralized finance, parts of the bitcoin community are worried that the network will get left behind. Some developers are working towards deploying native bitcoin smart contracts in the ecosystem, which will provide greater utility to BTC moving forward.\n\nLightning Network\n\nInitially proposed in 2015, the Lightning network is a kind of Layer 2 scaling solution for Bitcoin transactions. It takes certain payments off-chain into specific channels between two trusted parties. The Lightning network is intended for smaller, everyday transactions like buying coffee. As the name would suggest, the Lightning network is faster and more affordable than Bitcoin\u2019s main network.\n\nBitcoin Smart Contracts \u2013 TapRoot Upgrades & Stacks Network\n\nRecent Taproot upgrades have introduced basic payment smart contracts to the network to make Bitcoin more composable. However, given Bitcoin\u2019s underlying immutable code, these contracts are rather limited and don\u2019t come close to the flexibility provided by other Layer 1 networks like Ethereum.\n\nMeanwhile, the Stacks (STX) network is an open-source Layer-1 blockchain that connects to Bitcoin\u2019s main chain. Stacks provide developers and users with a suitable environment to deploy more complex smart contracts. The project aims to bring smart contracts to the Bitcoin ecosystem while utilizing Bitcoin\u2019s security.\n\nIn the same way that BTC can be wrapped and deployed on Ethereum as wBTC tokens, Stacks will host sBTC tokens that can be redeemed for BTC at a 1:1 ratio.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nDespite providing the foundation for the entire cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, Bitcoin\u2019s scalability issues make it difficult to use as a payment network. Bitcoin also devastates the environment and consumes as much energy per year as a small country.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nWithout Bitcoin, your favorite blockchain, NFT, or meme coin wouldn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s important to know why Bitcoin and blockchain technologies were created and how they work. This also extends to the value of true decentralization and self-custody, which are cornerstones of the cryptocurrency world.\n\nFAQs"

        "title": "Bitcoin Mining Is Set to Turn Greener \u2013 Global X ETFs - Global X",
        "content": "The Bitcoin network\u2019s security is derived from a process called Proof-of-Work (PoW) which is powered by advanced hardware and large amounts of electricity. In PoW mining, miners aggregate transactional data over a specific period and attempt to summarize this data into an encrypted output that is accepted by the rest of the network. This process is computationally-intensive and requires a significant amount of energy. Successful miners are compensated by the network with newly-created bitcoin. PoW mining\u2019s energy requirement is not arbitrary, however. By requiring miners to expend resources to update the state of the shared ledger, tampering with historical data becomes extremely cost-prohibitive.\n\nToday, the global bitcoin mining industry consumes the same amount of electricity as a small country such as The Netherlands.1 While the total electricity consumption is high, it does not tell the whole story. It is also essential to consider the significant advancements the mining industry has made in improving the energy efficiency of their operations, as well as the forces catalyzing the mining industry to adopt greater amounts of sustainably-sourced electricity into the mining process.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nBitcoin miners compete to maximize their share of a fixed amount of mineable Bitcoin. Miners are incentivized to utilize efficient hardware and consume inexpensive energy to optimize profit margins.\n\nAdvances in the efficiency of mining hardware have been impressive, but the pace of improvements is slowing. Utilizing the cheapest energy sources is becoming increasingly important to reduce operational costs.\n\nRenewable energy sources such as solar and wind are becoming increasingly cost-competitive. Adopting these energy sources into the mining process is a trend that is likely to accelerate in the mining industry, which may support a decrease in the Bitcoin network\u2019s carbon footprint.\n\nMiners Power ASICs to Earn a Share of Bitcoin Rewards\n\nApplication-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are specialized hardware units used in the computationally-intensive process of bitcoin mining. These machines are tasked with \u201csolving\u201d a block of data and adding it to the blockchain. ASICs do this by aggregating transactional data across the network and pushing it through an encryption algorithm in search of an arbitrary output. This iterative process requires ASICs to make billions of guesses per second until the correct output is found.\n\nEach individual computation made by an ASIC is referred to as a hash, and the number of hashes an ASIC produces per second is referred to as the hashrate. A single hash can be thought of as a lottery ticket to solving a block and earning a bitcoin reward. A miner\u2019s share of the network\u2019s aggregate hashrate\u2014the amount of computing power generated by all ASICs on the network\u2014represents the bitcoin rewards the miner can expect to earn over a given time period.\n\nHigh Competition Requires Miners to Seek Operational Efficiencies\n\nBitcoin mining is highly competitive. As the network\u2019s aggregate hashrate increases, mining operations that do not proportionally scale their hashrate become diluted and experience a decrease in expected bitcoin rewards. To remain competitive, miners are forced to continually increase their hashrate, resulting in an arms race for the most powerful and efficient ASICs. The first chart below shows how the hashrate securing the network has increased over time, while the second chart demonstrates how increasing competition has led to a decrease in the average income per hash.\n\nTo maintain profit margins in the face of these competitive forces, miners can either utilize more efficient mining hardware that maximizes hashrate per unit of energy consumed, or they can power their mining devices with the cheapest energy available.\n\nThe Importance of Energy Efficiency Grows as Hardware Advances Slow\n\nThe early days of industrial-scale bitcoin mining were defined by miners competing to maximize energy efficient hashrate by using the latest-generation ASICs. Rapid advancements in semiconductor technology fueled this competition as ASICs saw exponential improvements in hashrate efficiency in a matter of years. Compared to their 2014 counterparts, today\u2019s ASICs are roughly 36x more energy efficient as measured by Joules of energy consumed to produce 1 gigahash (1 billion hashes) of computing power.2 However, the efficiency gains in ASIC technology are becoming increasingly marginal, as illustrated in the chart below.\n\nIn the face of slowing ASIC advancements, the dominance of hardware as the main determinant of a miner\u2019s profitability will likely diminish. In its place, cost-competitive energy will likely become an increasingly important input.\n\nEconomic Alignments Incentivize Miners to Adopt Renewable Energy\n\nMiners are incentivized to operate in locations with the cheapest and most accessible energy available. Expanding operations in places suitable for solar and wind farms is a compelling option. While these energy sources currently have reliability limitations, solar and wind energy have become more affordable than fossil fuel sources, as illustrated in the chart below.\n\nThe bitcoin mining industry is taking note of the cost benefits of renewable energy. Recently, a number of industry-leading miners began a transition of their operations away from fossil fuel sources of energy. Among these, Marathon Digital relocated operations from a coal-powered mining facility in Montana to more sustainable facilities including a wind-powered facility in King Mountain, Texas in Q3 2022.3 The Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC), a global forum of mining companies that represents 48.4% of the worldwide bitcoin mining network, estimated that in Q4 2022, renewable energy sources accounted for 58.9% of the electricity used to mine bitcoin, a significant improvement compared to 36.8% estimated in Q1 2021.4\n\nHalvings Could be Another Catalyst for Renewable Energy Adoption\n\nIn addition to competition, bitcoin halvings could also accelerate green energy adoption among miners. Halvings happen every 210,000 blocks, approximately every four years.5 As the name suggests, halvings reduce bitcoin block rewards by 50%, which lowers revenues earned by bitcoin miners by almost the same amount if there is no change in the price of bitcoin. Expected in 2024, the next halving will reduce block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC issued per block.6 With competition and halvings pressuring miners to seek out efficiency gains wherever possible, bitcoin miners are discovering that environmentally sustainable practices may be the next frontier to explore.\n\nRelated ETFs\n\nBKCH \u2013 Global X Blockchain ETF\n\nClick the fund name above to view current holdings.

        "content": "Print this page\n\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\n\nBitcoin hit its highest level in nine months on Friday as crypto traders shifted funds away from banks and warmed to rapidly shifting interest rate expectations.\n\nThe dollar-denominated price of the original and biggest crypto coin has surged more than 30 per cent this week to more than $27,000, its highest point since the onset of the crisis of confidence that engulfed the market last summer. The second-largest token, ether, has risen a fifth in the same period.\n\nBuyers have emerged after a week of acute turbulence for the world\u2019s banking industry on both sides of the Atlantic as investors fret over the valuations of smaller banks\u2019 bond portfolios and business models.\n\nThe US government and large banks stepped in to steady the system while the Swiss central bank provided a $54bn emergency backstop for lender Credit Suisse. The uncertainty has prompted speculation that the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank will pause their plans to raise interest rates aggressively to curb lingering inflation.\n\nFor the past 18 months the price of bitcoin, once touted as a hedge against inflation, has often been correlated with traditional stock indices such as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite, and sensitive to traders\u2019 expectations on interest rates.\n\nTraders point out that when investors have fears over crypto prices, they move funds into bank deposits and stablecoins. When there are concerns over banks, they rapidly move to purchasing tokens.\n\n\u201cFears over the stability of the banking system, along with declining real interest rates, creates a good environment for bitcoin to rebound because it is seen by some investors as a hedge against systemic risks,\u201d said Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at London broker Marex.\n\nThe market recovery has also been bolstered after reassurances from US authorities that deposits at the failed Silicon Valley Bank would be protected.\n\nCircle, operator of the crypto market\u2019s second largest stablecoin USDC, admitted it had $3.3bn trapped at SVB, triggering a temporary decline in the value of the stablecoin to 88 cents.\n\nStablecoins act as a conduit between crypto and sovereign money and are supposed to maintain their value one-for-one against the dollar at all times.\n\nDespite a short-term recovery for digital assets, turbulence in the banking sector casts doubt over the crypto industry\u2019s long-term footprint in the US.\n\nTogether with Silvergate and Signature, SVB was one of a tripartite of crypto-friendly banks that met their demise in recent days. Their failures have sparked fears among industry supporters that the US is de-banking the crypto industry.\n\nRepublican congressman Tom Emmer on Wednesday wrote a letter to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, arguing that the regulator was purposely seeking to limit the banking industry\u2019s exposure to crypto markets.\n\n\u201cA lot of people already understand the industry is rotating away from the United States, so in many ways, America\u2019s crypto clampdown has been priced in by the market,\u201d Solot said."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency fans believe it\u2019s more than just a coincidence that bitcoin has been rallying in the wake of the recent troubles hitting traditional banking institutions.\n\nWhile a string of regional banks have seen their stock prices decline over the past week by as much as 70%, the price of bitcoin has jumped by nearly 32%.\n\nFor the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, the timing couldn\u2019t be better for rolling out its expanded certification for blockchain and digital assets.\n\nTwo years after launching the initial certification, DACFP is keeping up with the times by tailoring the education and credentials to areas of emerging interest.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve discovered about half the people taking the course are not financial advisors,\u201d said DACFP founder Ric Edelman.\n\nAccording to Edelman, the thousands of people who have taken the virtual courses and earned the certification can be separated into four categories: financial advisors, non-advisor professionals working in the financial services industry, people working in the cryptocurrency industry, and a general category of investors and students.\n\nWith that in mind, Edelman said the certification is being expanded to four separate tracks customized for each category.\n\n\u201cIt was a big surprise to me, because we created the course for advisors and it\u2019s aimed at practice management issues and estate planning, and regulation and compliance.\u201d\n\nWhile the expanded market wasn\u2019t something Edelman had anticipated, he was expecting to make regular revisions to the virtual certification program to keep pace with the fast-changing crypto space.\n\n\u201cCrypto is evolving so rapidly the course was getting out of date and we had to update it,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo years ago, NFTs hadn\u2019t been invented yet, the metaverse was unheard of, and the FTX debacle hadn\u2019t occurred.\u201d\n\nChris Baker, director of business development at Fidelity Digital Assets, is seeing increasing demand among advisors for education around crypto even if those advisors are not ready to allocate clients in that direction yet.\n\n\u201cWhile some advisors remain skeptical of the digital assets space, many continue down the path of educating their teams and finding platforms that suit their clients\u2019 demand,\u201d Baker said. \u201cAdvisors recognize that the client demand for exposure to digital assets is not going away despite price fluctuation, yet many are surprised that it\u2019s not just their younger clients, but clients across the generational spectrum that are seeking exposure to digital assets.\u201d\n\nEdelman said that the certification changes weren\u2019t pegged to the unfolding issues facing the banking industry, but that he expects the crypto space to benefit from the high-profile failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, among the string of challenges facing traditional banks.\n\nHe cited the ongoing banking crisis among the reasons for the rally in the price of bitcoin, which is up 50% so far this year, including a 32% spike over the past week.\n\n\u201cIt is shocking to people that you can suddenly wake up and find that your bank account is gone, your deposits are frozen or completely gone,\u201d Edelman said. \u201cPeople are starting to ask the question if bitcoin is now safer than banking. This tech represents the newest form of money on a global scale. You could argue that that attitude is a little whacky, but it is nonetheless contributing to the price of bitcoin over the past week.\u201d\n\nTyrone Ross, co-founder and chief executive of Turnqey Labs, also believes the rally in digital assets is linked to the unfolding banking crisis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mainly because folks are looking at what is happening with the banks,\u201d he said. \u201cBased on conversations I\u2019ve had, people are realizing what all of us have been proselytizing about money being stuck in banks, real-time payment systems, and needing a third party for basic transfers of money. People are starting to wake up and realize what we\u2019ve been banging the table about.\u201d\n\nBeyond the events of the past week, Edelman said cryptocurrency is riding a longer-term trend that includes \u201ca massive amount of development in the technology because businesses are discovering it more advantageous than ever to integrate blockchain into business practices.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd governments around the globe are advancing their efforts of adoption around the technology,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s an arms race around the world to embrace crypto because governments recognize this technology creates a lot of high-paying green jobs.\u201d\n\nJack Neureuter, research analyst at Fidelity Digital Assets, attributed the strength of bitcoin to a \u201cnarrative shift in recent months regarding the reason why institutional investors are looking at bitcoin and digital assets as an investment to potentially include in their portfolio.\n\n\u201cLast year, the elevated levels of correlation between equity markets, particularly growth and technology, and crypto was clear and drove institutional investors to view bitcoin and other digital assets as high-risk, technology-like investments,\u201d Neureuter added. \u201cYear-to-date, we\u2019ve observed a breakdown in this correlation and notable positive price action in alternative store-of-value assets, like gold, alongside strong relative performance for bitcoin versus other digital assets.\u201d"

In comparison, Nubank \u2014 trading as NU \u2014 has risen only 26%. Meanwhile, another crypto-exposure stock, Coinbase \u2014 trading as COIN \u2014 has seen the biggest rebound of the three, rising over 100% YTD.\n\nBTC/USD and COIN vs. NU yearly performance. Source: TradingView\n\nNevertheless, Buffett's investment has fared better than COIN over the past 12 months.\n\nAs of March 17, NU is down 38% year-over-year compared with COIN\u2019s 61.76%, nearly equal to Bitcoin\u2019s 37% losses in the same period.\n\nWarren Buffett sticks by his neobank investment\n\nBuffett\u2019s investment firm, Berkshire Hathaway, purchased $1.5 billion worth of class-A Nubank stock in two separate rounds in July 2021 and February 2022.\n\nThe news came as a surprise to many, as Buffett is a well-known cryptocurrency critic and Nubank offers crypto trading services via its Nucripto wing. In May 2022, the bank said that it would allocate 1% of its net assets to Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThis move reinforces the company\u2019s conviction in Bitcoin\u2019s current and future potential in disrupting financial services in the region,\u201d Nubank said at the time.\n\nBut despite Nubank\u2019s crypto exposure and NU\u2019s price decline, Buffett has not sold a single share, according to Berkshire\u2019s latest annual earnings report.\n\nThe decision to keep holding NU through a rough market likely coincides with Nubank\u2019s growth in the Latin American banking sector.\n\nNu Holdings, the parent company of Nubank, reported a solid 2022 with 140% year-on-year growth in revenue and a 38% year-over-year rise in active customers.\n\nCathie Wood doubles down on COIN in 2023\n\nThe same cannot be said about Coinbase\u2019s earnings in 2022 with its 57% drop in year-over-year revenue.\n\nRelated: Crypto acted as safe haven amid SVB and Signature bank run: Cathie Wood\n\nBut ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood appears unfazed and is continuing to buy COIN shares via her ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) and ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) in 2023. The COIN buys, in particular, account for roughly 30% of all the stock purchased so far this year.\n\nCOIN weight across ARK ETFs portfolios. Source: Ark Invest\n\nAs a result, Coinbase has become Wood\u2019s fifth-largest holding on record, worth nearly $670 million at the time of writing.\n\nHolding Bitcoin a better strategy?\n\nComparing Bitcoin\u2019s price performance with the market debut of Coinbase and Nu Holdings reaffirms that BTC not only regularly outperforms stocks in general but also crypto-exposure stocks \u2014 although exceptions have been seen, such as with the Bitcoin mining stock boom in 2021.\n\nBut overall, holding Bitcoin is proving to be a better strategy year-over-year, and likely with more upside potential, than traditional stocks.\n\nNotably, NU has dropped by more than 50% since its market debut in December 2021. Since then, BTC has fared better with a 44% decline in the same period.\n\nNU\u2019s returns since market debut vs. BTC. Source: TradingView\n\nSimilarly, COIN is down 80% since its initial public offering in April 2021. The same down-cycle, however, has seen Bitcoin only losing around 50%, emerging as a better performer overall against crypto-exposure stocks such as Coinbase and Nu Holdings.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

A few hours later, the former Coinbase executive accepted the bet.\n\nSir, I believe we have ourselves a deal https://t.co/9JYaLNo9Eq \u2014 James Medlock (@jdcmedlock) March 18, 2023\n\nUnder the proposed terms, if Bitcoin\u2019s price fails to reach $1 million by June 17, Medlock will win $1 million worth of the dollar-pegged stablecoin USD Coin (USDC) and 1 BTC. In the same way, if Bitcoin is worth at least $1 million by the date, then Balaji can keep the 1 BTC and the $1 million in USDC. Srinivasan explained in the thread:\n\n\u201cYou buy 1 BTC. I will send $1M USD. This is ~40:1 odds as 1 BTC is worth ~$26k. The term is 90 days.\u201d\n\nRelated: Banking crisis: What does it mean for crypto?\n\nPer the thread, other Twitter users helped set up a smart contract with the betting terms. Srinivasan also disclosed that he would move another $1 million in USDC for another wager on the same topic:\n\n\u201cI am moving $2M into USDC for the bet. I will do it with Medlock and one other person, sufficient to prove the point. See my next tweet. Everyone else should just go buy Bitcoin, as it\u2019ll be much cheaper for you than locking one up for 90 days.\u201c\n\nMedlock and Srinivasan made the wager based on their different views of the U.S. economy\u2019s future amid ongoing uncertainty regarding its banking system.\n\nSrinivasan argues that there\u2019s an impending crisis that will lead to the deflation of the U.S. dollar and, thus, to a hyperinflation scenario that would take the BTC price to $1 million. Medlock, on the other hand, is bearish about upcoming hyperinflation in the country.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s price has reached $27,387 at the time of writing, with its market capitalization adding over $194 billion year-to-date to a 66% growth in 2023, outperforming Wall Street bank stocks amid fears of a global banking crisis.\n\nAlso, for the first time in a year, BTC\u2019s price has shifted away from United States stocks, rising about 65% compared to the S&P 500\u2019s 2.5% gains and the Nasdaq\u2019s 15% decline, Cointelegraph reported."

        "content": "HODL is such a popular trading strategy in the crypto community that it has transcended into a meme.\n\nHODLers are flexing their muscles as they refuse to sell even if they are in profits.\n\nAdd to that the halving and we have the recipe for bitcoin rocket fuel.\n\nMany bitcoin traders laugh at the idea of HODL (holding on for dear life). They think that it is not a sound trading or investing strategy. If you buy and hold on the way down, it\u2019s very likely that you\u2019ll use the same approach on the way up. The rigidity of this method makes it difficult for many investors to lock in gains.\n\nNevertheless, the strategy is so popular that it has become a meme.\n\nHODL\u2019s acceptance appears to be bordering obsession. A new report reveals that millions of BTCs have not moved in a year.\n\nHolders Refuse To Sell Even If They Are In Deep Profits\n\nThe S&P 500 is up nearly 27% year-to-date. If the index closes the year with gains around that number, then many investors would consider 2019 as a good year.\n\nBitcoin holders are also having a great year. The top cryptocurrency is by over 95% year-to-date. The numbers align. According to The Block, 61% of bitcoin holders are sitting in profits .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven with gains that are over 250% higher than the S&P 500, there\u2019s a sense that bitcoin investors are far from satisfied. Many expect mind-numbing and jaw-dropping performance from the dominant cryptocurrency.\n\nI say this because BitInfoCharts show that 11.58 million BTCs have not moved in over a year.\n\nIn other words, 64% of the over 18.04 million bitcoin in circulation are not moving. This means that only 6.46 million BTCs are being used for speculation or payment settlement. At bitcoin\u2019s current price of $7,260, only $48.99 billion worth of BTCs have been changing hands over the last year.\n\nThis has tremendous bullish implications for the number one cryptocurrency.\n\nHODL Is Creating Immense Value For Bitcoin\n\nHaters like Peter Schiff always claim that bitcoin has no intrinsic value. They say that unlike gold which can be used for electronics, bitcoin doesn\u2019t have any utility. More importantly, it is not backed by anything that can prove its value.\n\nWell, bitcoin\u2019s value comes from its scarcity. There will only be 21 million BTCs in existence. On top of that, around 4 million BTCs are lost . The scarcity is real.\n\nWe spoke to Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics and asked whether 11.58 million being HODLed has long-term bull bullish implications. He told CCN,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes\n\nThe analyst then referred us to one of his recent tweets.\n\nTrader Max echoes Mati Greenspan\u2019s sentiments. The trader told CCN,\n\nThere are too many variables at play but scarcity is a good price driver.\n\nThe good news for HODLers is that bitcoin is about to get more scarce in the coming months.\n\nHalving Very Likely To Make Bitcoin More Valuable\n\nIf analysts believe that scarcity drives the price of bitcoin, then it would be fair to assume that the top cryptocurrency\u2019s value would soar in the coming months. In about six months, bitcoin block rewards will be reduced by half from 12.5 BTC down to 6.25 BTC. This means that there will only be around 900 BTCs issued to miners on a daily basis.\n\nThe dramatic drop in supply due to the halving would alleviate selling pressure at the very least. The reduction in selling is likely to drive prices higher. That might be more than enough to trigger a massive buying frenzy.\n\nTherefore, HODL and halving are two of bitcoin\u2019s strongest narratives.\n\nDisclaimer: The above should not be considered trading advice from CCN. The writer owns bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. He holds investment positions in the coins but does not engage in short-term or day-trading."

        "content": "Proponents of cryptocurrency mining say the industry's future in Canada is hanging in the balance after several provinces moved to restrict new projects earlier this year in response to concerns about their electricity usage.\n\nCrypto entrepreneurs \u2014 most of them focused on Bitcoin \u2014 have been drawn to Canada because of the abundant supply of clean, inexpensive electricity in provinces like British Columbia and Quebec. Most crypto operations need unfettered access to cheap power to operate the rows of high-powered computers required for cryptomining.\n\n\"Why Canada? So, first of all, we said, 'What are the key ingredients you need to run this computing service?'\" said Dan Roberts, an Australian cryptocurrency entrepreneur whose company, Iris Energy, operates three facilities in B.C.\n\n\"Cool temperatures \u2014 really important. Stability of law, good regulatory jurisdiction. But most importantly, renewable energy.\"\n\nCBC News: The House 20:20 The power of cryptocurrency mining and its uncertain future Several Canadian provinces have moved to put limits on new cryptocurrency mining operations, putting into question Canada\u2019s place in the emerging sector. In a special report, freelance journalist Bob Keating speaks with entrepreneurs who are pushing for more mining operations in Canada and B.C. Energy Minister Josie Osborne speaks with host Catherine Cullen about why her province has hit the brakes on new operations.\n\nRoberts said he sees a new wave of economic prosperity growing out of cryptocurrency mining in provinces like B.C., which currently enjoys an electricity surplus.\n\n\"We can build a whole industry around this. We can go into those regional towns where they've been decimated by the end of the pulp-and-paper mill \u2026 rehire local workers, retrain them, and deliver all these benefits back into the community,\" he said.\n\nBut some provinces have slammed the brakes on new projects, saying the mining sites \u2014 where computers churn through complex equations to verify cryptocurrency transactions on the blockchain ledger (earning digital assets as a reward) \u2014 consume a staggering amount of electrical power.\n\nB.C. currently has seven mining sites in operation, with six more in advanced states of development. But it also has imposed an 18-month moratorium on connecting any new crypto mining projects to its electrical grid \u2014 halting 21 other projects which the province says would have used the same amount of power as 570,000 homes.\n\nManitoba also has paused new crypto hookups, while Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec has set up higher rates and an electricity usage cap for mining projects. Ontario has proposed excluding crypto miners from an incentive program that could allow them to save money on electricity.\n\nUncertainty clouds future investments\n\nRight now, Canadian crypto miners account for the fourth highest amount of computing power being contributed to the blockchain network, after crypto operations in the United States, China and Kazakhstan. Moves by some provinces to ration the sector's access to electricity have some crypto enthusiasts questioning whether Canada will continue to be a major player.\n\n\"As a public company, I have shareholders and I need to pause or not make decisions until I know what the rules are. And once I know what the rules are, I look at whether to invest in Canada or somewhere more lucrative,\" said Sheldon Bennett, CEO of DMG Blockchain Solutions and part of the Canadian Digital Asset Mining Coalition, an advocacy organization.\n\nB.C. Energy Minister Josie Osborne told The House B.C.'s decision to impose the moratorium was meant to give the province time to consult with the industry to make sure energy is being put to good use.\n\nThe Site C dam in B.C., under construction in 2021. (B.C. Hydro/submitted)\n\nWhile B.C. has an energy surplus right now, Osborne said that might not always be the case.\n\n\"We don't want to put that electricity at risk. It's why we have to take this pause right now and instead use the electricity for the best opportunities in the future,\" she told host Catherine Cullen.\n\nOsborne argued that in order for B.C. to achieve its climate and economic goals, it has to look at other areas where its electricity might be more useful.\n\n\"Cryptocurrency definitely does not create the number of jobs that other industry does,\" she said.\n\nIt also does nothing to help B.C. achieve its climate goals, she added.\n\n\"Cryptocurrency mining doesn't lower pollution in other industries,\" she said. \"We want to use that electricity for our mines and for forestry operations, for marine port operations, for hydrogen operations [so] we could use the hydrogen to blend natural gas and decarbonize there. We want to use these electrons for their highest and best use.\"\n\n\n\nOsborne did signal her government is somewhat open to hooking up new crypto operations in the future.\n\nDan Roberts, co-founder of the cryptocurrency company Iris Energy, says Canada's supply of clean energy is a huge draw for his industry. (Bob Keating/CBC)\n\nCryptocurrency was once a trendy topic in Canadian politics. It was championed by Pierre Poilievre during his successful run for the Conservative leadership (he famously bought a shawarma sandwich with Bitcoin just under a year ago).\n\nPoilievre suggested at the time that cryptocurrencies could allow ordinary Canadians to \"opt out\" of inflation because they are not influenced by central banks. That was before many cryptocurrencies crashed last year; Bitcoin's value in late 2022 had dropped to about one-fourth of what it had been a year prior.\n\nBut policy development on crypto is moving forward. The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), the umbrella organization representing Canada's provincial and territorial securities regulators, has pushed for restrictions on crypto trading, while the Bank of Canada is in the midst of a digital asset review .\n\nThe shift of some cryptocurrencies like Ethereum \u2014 the second largest cryptocurrency \u2014 to what's known as a \"proof of stake\" system has eliminated the need for mining, and thus for most of the currency's energy consumption. That's provided hope to some advocates that the energy argument against cryptocurrencies can one day be eliminated.\n\nBut Bitcoin remains on a \"proof of work\" model, where mining is key. Bennett said he wonders about Canada's willingness to engage with the new sector.\n\n\"What does Canada decide it wants to do with this industry? Does it want to foster it and grow it? Does it appreciate the technology, the jobs and the investment that's coming into it and want to grow that?\" he said.\n\n\"Or does it want to sit back and see how other countries manage it?\""

        "content": "Digital assets have been found to move in cyclical patterns based on volatility, leading to larger outsized returns.\n\nAn exhaustive study conducted by researchers at risk management and trading platform The Risk Protocol (TRP) found bellwether bitcoin volatility differed significantly depending on the time of day.\n\nMeasuring in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), TRP said hours two and 15 through 18 were found to be the most volatile, the study, titled \u201cThe Nature of the Beast,\u201d indicated.\n\nPut differently, by analyzing the average absolute return and absolute return standard deviation, it was revealed that crypto tends to move most during the 9 am start of the day across Asia and the US.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the volatility pattern in the US financial markets, it is typically U shaped, in the sense that it is higher at market opening and closing and lower in the middle,\u201d TRP CEO Karamvir Gosal told Blockworks.\n\nGosal added: \u201cIf traders are building a large position in crypto or trying to unwind one, they want to do so in periods of low volatility.\u201d\n\nVolatility can be described as the degree of variation of a financial instrument\u2019s price over time, and can manifest in either positive or negative moves.\n\nIt is often measured by the standard deviation of an asset\u2019s returns over a certain period. In other words, the higher the volatility, the more the price of the asset fluctuates, which implies a greater risk for investors.\n\nVolatility across Asia typically lasts for between five and six hours before dropping to its lowest point as parts of Europe approached late evening, the study found. Volatility then begins to pick up once again during US working hours, peaking by about 2 pm.\n\nWith people in the US starting a new trading day, \u201cwe would typically expect more trading activity during these hours,\u201d TRP said.\n\nLarge levels of exchange trading volumes have been witnessed occurring during those times, which is consistent with the analysis, researchers said.\n\nEthereum, too, was also shown to have the same volatility patterns as bitcoin, which makes sense given their close correlation during major market moves.\n\n\u201cFindings are not too surprising given the regular working hours around the world,\u201d TRP said. The study also found that, of the 50 digital assets it analyzed, Friday, offered up significantly higher volatility than other days.\n\nTo test the statistical significance of the results, the researchers conducted a mean difference test between Tuesday and other days and found the weekend offered the lowest levels of significant price changes.\n\nThe results are likely correlated to crypto\u2019s round-the-clock trading times compared to traditional markets, meaning more people are likely to trade during days when they are at work taking a break during the weekend, they said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Bitcoin rose in Friday morning trading in Asia to near the US$25,000 mark. Ether and the rest of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also gained as global equity markets stabilized following moves by authorities in the U.S. and Europe to backstop banks with cash after a series of failures in the industry this past week threatened to spread. BNB led the crypto winners as a U.S. court overruled government objections and approved the Binance US$1 billion deal to buy bankrupt crypto lender Voyager.\n\nSee related article: US, Germany shut ChipMixer for alleged ties to US$3 bln crypto laundering\n\nFast facts\n\nBitcoin rose 2.75% in the past 24 hours to US$24,973 at 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency jumped 24% over the past seven days, the largest gain among the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Some commentators argue Bitcoin acted as a safe haven for investors as bank failures shook global equity markets this week.\n\nEther edged up 1.32% to trade at US$1,668, a gain of 17% for the past seven days.\n\nBNB, the native token of the Binance crypto exchange, led the winners on Friday with a 7.56% jump to US$327.98. A U.S. court judge on Wednesday rejected the government\u2019s appeal to block a US$1 billion offer by Binance U.S. to buy the assets of the failed Voyager platform. The token added 19.51% for the seven-day-period.\n\nPolygon\u2019s Matic token climbed 2.88% to US$1.14, logging a weekly gain of 14.04%. Salesforce, one of the world\u2019s biggest enterprise software firms with a market cap of more than US$150 billion, has entered a partnership with Polygon blockchain to help its clients build non-fungible token-related (NFT) programs, according to a tweet by Polygon Labs on Thursday. Saleforce previously launched a suite of customer relationship management tools for Web3 developers.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization rose 1.91% in the past 24 hours to US$1.08 trillion. Total trading volume over the last 24 hours fell 25.30% to US$61.92 billion.\n\nU.S. equities closed higher in a relief rally on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved up 1.17%, the S&P 500 rose 1.76%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 2.48%.\n\nThe gains in equities came after Credit Suisse on Thursday said it would borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs (US$54 billion) from the Swiss National Bank to shore up liquidity. On the U.S. side, 11 U.S. financial institutions injected US$30 billion into First Republic Bank on Thursday after the bank\u2019s share price fell sharply on fears of a bank run.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Congress on Thursday that the U.S. \u201cbanking system remains sound\u201d, and \u201cthe Federal Reserve is providing additional support to the banking system with a new lending facility.\u201d\n\nOn the inflation front, the U.S. Department of Labor on Thursday reported a drop in unemployment benefit claims in the week ending March 11 that was more than expected, indicating a strong labor market that supports the view the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again this month.\n\nU.S. interest rates are between 4.5% to 4.75%, the highest since October 2007. Analysts at the CME Group expect a 79.7% chance the Fed will raise rates by 25 basis points this month. The chance of no rate increase is at 20.3%, down from 45.4% on Thursday.\n\nThe U.S. consumer price index (CPI) rose 6% on year in February, a deceleration from 6.4% in January, but still well above the Fed\u2019s goal to keep annual inflation below 2%.\n\nU.S. stock futures traded flat to lower as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures off 0.14%. The S&P 500 futures dipping 0.11%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index treaded water with a dip of 0.03%.\n\nSee related article: Ripple executives say XRP lawsuit ruling will have little impact on global business operations"

Source: TradingView\n\nBanking crisis volatility sees $27,000 BTC price\n\nData from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD hitting $27,025 on Bitstamp before consolidating.\n\nAt the time of writing, the pair circled $26,500 with volatility ongoing after the Wall Street open.\n\nA catalyst for fresh upside had come in the form of the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet data overnight, this showing almost $300 billion being injected into the economy as part of the banking crisis response.\n\nThe event effectively undid months of liquidity removal under the Fed\u2019s quantitative tightening (QT), and commentators were quick to call the restarting of the opposite phenomenon \u2014 quantitative easing (QE).\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s not QE, but the numbers don\u2019t lie.

        "title": "Bitcoin Mempool Surges Point to New Life for World's First Blockchain - Blockworks",
        "content": "The number of Bitcoin transactions waiting to be confirmed by the network reached its highest point since Terra imploded last week \u2014 a sign of renewed interest in the premiere blockchain.\n\nOn the afternoon of Mar. 9, nearly 81,000 transactions briefly sat in Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cmempool\u201d \u2014 a data structure that stores valid transactions yet to be added to the blockchain.\n\nThat was just 1,000 shy of last year\u2019s peak on May 13, as algorithmic stablecoin UST was crashing to zero, and 66% more than the 48,000 sitting unconfirmed in mid-November following FTX\u2019s sudden implosion.\n\nMempool spikes like these can occur when there is a surge in network usage, although a sudden drop in mining power can have the same effect.\n\nOnly so much transactional data can fit into each Bitcoin block (averaging to around 2,000 transactions). When there\u2019s an excess, users must wait for their transactions to flow through the mempool.\n\nUsers can incentivize miners to process their transactions first with higher fees. So when the mempool really fills up, miners may opt to only process transactions with more bitcoin attached \u2014 or even set a minimum fee \u2014 leaving those with smaller fees to wait.\n\nWhen this happens, the mempool is often left with a large amount of unconfirmed, low-fee transactions. So, higher fees are considered one of the primary causes of mempool surges; fees rise along with demand for blockspace.\n\nUnconfirmed transaction count hit record highs beyond 256,000 in Dec. 2017, when BTC hit $20,000 for the first time (source)\n\nOftentimes, mempools spike when service providers consolidate transactions that have occurred off-chain all at once, Bitcoin developer Rene Pickhardt told Blockworks.\n\nThese consolidations would be somewhat easy to spot in the mempool \u2014 lots of transactions added all at once with rather small fees.\n\nBitcoin transaction fees still low compared to the bull run\n\nBut why did the Bitcoin mempool spike last week?\n\nHo Chan Chung, head of marketing at analysis platform CryptoQuant, pointed Blockworks to a jump in trading volumes across spot and perpetuals markets for both bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) as USDC fell below $0.90 on Mar. 11.\n\nThe mempool could have reflected those transactions attempting to be settled on-chain.\n\nBut unconfirmed transactions peaked about 30 hours before top-two stablecoin USDC depegged from the US dollar, an event which spilled over to a number of other stablecoins, including DAI.\n\nThe number of unconfirmed transactions also quickly subsided, before USDC briefly sank to all-time lows.\n\nUnconfirmed transactions built up and then subsided\u2026 before building up again over the past few days\n\nIf the surge were related, it would mean a large number of stablecoin holders all traded their tokens for bitcoin in the lead up to Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s failure on Mar. 10, anticipating negative impacts on the wider crypto ecosystem. Service providers would\u2019ve then had to consolidate those transactions on-chain, perhaps all at once.\n\nIt\u2019s hypothetically possible. (Ethereum also saw a slight rise in unconfirmed transactions around the depeg, during the event, rather than in the days leading up to it). But pseudonymous Bitcoin developer 0xB10C wasn\u2019t convinced.\n\n\u201cGenerally, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s related to the depeg if that was 30 hours later,\u201d they told Blockworks. \u201cIt seems like someone broadcast many blocks of transactions around that time at a lowish fee rate of 2 sat/vB.\u201d\n\nThose might have been consolidations, and \u201ccombined with the normal intraday activity and some larger Ordinal inscription transactions that are frequent currently, this did probably caused feerate estimators in wallets to suggest a higher fee rate,\u201d 0xB10C said.\n\nRight now, Bitcoin users can get a transaction processed in around 29 minutes for 22 sat/vB ($0.825), according to mempool.space. Those in a hurry can pay around 48 sat/vB ($1.78) to have miners add their transactions in the next block (processed in 10 minutes) \u2014 far less than the average during the heat of the last bull market, when it hit more than $60 per transaction.\n\nLoading Tweet.. A similar occurrence happened earlier, on Mar. 8, which kickstarted the mempool surge\n\n(NB: There is no global \u201cBitcoin mempool.\u201d Every node has their own mempool with their own data set, although they can be quite similar, 0xB10C said.)\n\nHow much Bitcoin mempool is too much mempool?\n\nColin Harper, head of research and content at Bitcoin mining pool Luxor, agreed that Ordinal inscriptions are a significant driver of transaction fees right now.\n\n\u201cBitcoin price volatility typically increases transaction volume and I believe we\u2019re seeing that now as well, but if it weren\u2019t for inscriptions taking up so much for blockspace, fees would be lower than they are right now,\u201d Harper said.\n\nThere are currently about 52,600 unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions. Mempool weight (the size of the data contained in the mempool) is around 222 vMB. Bitcoin Core\u2019s default maximum mempool limit is 300MB.\n\nAll this begs the question: At what point does this become a problem?\n\n\u201cOnce the mempool data structure (transactions and a bit of overhead per transactions) reaches 300 MB of system memory, low feerate transactions aren\u2019t accepted anymore and some might also be dropped,\u201d 0xB10C said.\n\nOrdinals have been popular, but they still contribute a minute portion of Bitcoin mining revenue\n\nNot all node operators use the 300MB default, though. Some set higher limits to avoid dropping low feerate transactions. With this in mind, it\u2019s not exactly true that the Bitcoin network is \u201ccongested\u201d when the mempool fills up \u2014 transactions will still be processed, it\u2019s just that they may be more expensive.\n\nThat\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, either, according to Jeff Yew, founder of digital asset manager Monochrome.\n\n\u201cLike the layered banking settlement and payments infrastructure, the increased demand and ultimately cost for base-layer bitcoin settlements is a good thing,\u201d Yew said.\n\n\u201cIt further strengthens the security of the network, while encouraging the development and use of second-layer solutions, such as the Lightning Network, for day-to-day payments.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Ether rose 26.67% in the same period to US$1,750.\n\nHowever, equity markets had a turbulent (understatement) week due to fears that cracks were appearing in the U.S. banking system.\n\nIt started the week prior when Silvergate Bank went into voluntary liquidation after a bank run and its shares plunged. Regulators then quickly shut down Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, two major lenders to the technology and crypto industries, to avoid panic and the risk of a systemic bank failure.\n\nIt was serious enough that U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen contacted the White House on the weekend of March 11 to get approval from President Joe Biden to initiate the takeovers. Treasury then put out a joint statement with fellow heavyweights, the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, assuring they would provide a backstop for U.S. banks.\n\nBiden repeated the same message during the week as traders drove down the shares of other U.S. regional banks. The focus shifted to Europe when global investment bank Credit Suisse started to wobble, prompting a US$54 billion lifeline from the Swiss National Bank. On the U.S. side, 11 financial institutions had to step up to inject US$30 billion into First Republic Bank after its share price tanked.\n\nWrong focus?\n\nDespite the spreading woes in the banking industry, Bitcoin remained resilient and only briefly fell to US$19,654 on March 10, before reclaiming the US$20,000 level the next day and then moving higher through the week.\n\n\u201cWhile the U.S. banking system was seizing up in response to bank runs threatening regional banks, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto networks didn\u2019t skip a beat,\u201d tweeted Cathie Wood, the founder and chief executive officer of investment management giant Ark Invest.\n\nAmid recent regulatory crackdowns on crypto platforms, Wood seemingly could not resist driving home the point:\n\n\u201cInstead of blocking decentralized, transparent, auditable and well-functioning financial platforms with no central points of failure, regulators should have been focused on the centralized and opaque points of failure looming in the traditional banking system.\u201d\n\nDented\n\nJames Wo, the founder and chief executive officer of crypto investment firm DFG, shares Wood\u2019s sentiment.\n\n\u201cThe market\u2019s confidence in traditional finance was dented, leading to a shift of funds to the crypto market,\u201d wrote Wo, in a LinkedIn response. Bitcoin \u201chas shown its superior risk and inflation resistance as an alternative asset, and will be further recognized by the mainstream,\u201d he said.\n\nBitcoin then rose above the US$26,000 mark on Tuesday after the release of the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI), which indicated a drop in the annual inflation rate to 6% in February.\n\nHowever, Jamie Douglas Coutts, senior market structure analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said Bitcoin\u2019s rally was really driven by the earthquake in U.S. banking, not the CPI reading.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has been strongly bid since last Friday when it became clear the U.S. banking system was in trouble. The real story is the 25% rally from then. The spike to US$26,000 on the CPI print is noise, because the number came in line with expectations and it quickly fell back below US$25,000 \u2013 a level which I believe is critically important from a technical perspective,\u201d wrote Coutts to Forkast.\n\nHedging\n\nSlava Demchuk, the co-founder of AMLBot, a developer of crypto anti-money laundering software, attributed Bitcoin\u2019s rally to hedging by investors.\n\n\u201c[Bitcoin\u2019s rally] is not necessarily due to a widespread recognition of the non-custodial potential of digital assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, but as a means to safeguard against traditional financial systems,\u201d wrote Demchuk.\n\nBonnie Cheung, head of strategy at Sending Labs, a software firm building Web3 communication protocols, said that the global government interventions will help Bitcoin reach new highs.\n\n\u201cThe rapid move by the Swiss government to support Credit Suisse has certainly given the market an olive branch to hold onto for the coming weeks. This, together with the action by the US government, has now set a precedent,\u201d said Cheung.\n\n\u201cThe expectation is that governments will not hesitate to swoop in should any major banking crisis start to unfold in the next few weeks. This will further ignite the bullish sentiment and build the narrative to push Bitcoin to test new highs,\u201d wrote Cheung.\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.14 trillion on Friday at 7:00 p.m. in Hong Kong, up 23% from US$923 billion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin\u2019s US$520 billion market cap accounted for 45.2% of the market, while Ether\u2019s US$215 billion accounted for 18.7%.\n\nSee related article: Banks are bringing systemic risks to crypto, says Circle\u2019s Disparte\n\nBiggest gainers: CFX, STX rise over 100%\n\nCFX, the utility token of Conflux Network, China\u2019s only public blockchain, was this week\u2019s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap. CFX rose 105.99% during the week to trade at US$0.317.\n\nThe token started gaining momentum after Conflux announced that KuCoin Ventures invested US$10 million in the protocol. Conflux also introduced CNHC, a CNH stablecoin for cross-border payments.\n\nSTX, the native token of Stacks, Bitcoin\u2019s smart contract layer, was the week\u2019s second-biggest gainer, up 100.13% to US$1.09.\n\nThe token has seen increased interest after its upcoming hard fork, Stacks 2.1., was announced for March 20. The upgrade aims to create a stronger interconnection between Stacks and Bitcoin by introducing decentralized mining pools, improved bridges and enable compatibility between Stacks-native assets \u2013 like Ordinals \u2013 and Bitcoin wallets.\n\nNext week: Bitcoin to US$28,000?\n\n\u201cRight now, systemic risk is front and center in the minds of investors,\u201d wrote Coutts. \u201cWhilst this banking crisis seemed to have started in the U.S. the situation in Europe with Deutsche and Credit Suisse has been a slow-moving train crash for years,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cShort term is not my forte but if we finish with a weekly close above the $25,000 then I would have to adjust my model regime to bullish as that would signal we have completed a bottoming process which started in mid-2022 and a new bull cycle is underway,\u201d added Coutts.\n\nDFG\u2019s Wo said macroeconomic trends in the U.S., upcoming interest rate hikes, and the global banking woes will remain the main determinants of traditional and crypto markets in the coming weeks.\n\nKadan Stadelmann, chief technical officer of blockchain infrastructure development firm Komodo, said the fragile economic landscape in the U.S. is currently the main driver of Bitcoin prices.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Reserve embarked upon a many-trillion dollar quantitative easing program, cut the minimum bank reserves from 10% to 0% on March 26, 2020, and led us into the current bout with inflation, which has led people to seek alternative ways to preserve wealth. Bitcoin has become a prominent option,\u201c wrote Stadelmann.\n\n\u201cBitcoin won\u2019t see any resistance until the US$30,000 level for now. If a systemically important bank such as Credit Suisse collapses, it could bring the market down to US$9,000-13,000,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, when markets collapsed, Bitcoin was among the first commodities to rebound. Bitcoin is still well off its all-time highs and could quickly double to retake its old highs, especially if the Fed reverses course and embarks upon another quantitative easing program,\u201d said Stadelmann.\n\nMayank Shekhar, co-founder and chief technology officer of play-to-earn game One World Nation, said Bitcoin is being increasingly perceived as a store of value and he expects it to trade between US$24,000-27,000 next week in the run up to the Fed meeting on interest rates on March 21 and 22.\n\nAziz Kenjaev, head of partnerships at decentralized crypto exchange GammaX Exchange, expects the crypto market to cool before the Fed\u2019s interest rate decision.\n\n\u201cThe Fed is expected to raise rates by 25 basis points, any number above this projection will act as a strong bearish sentiment for the U.S. dollar, and a strong bullish sentiment for Bitcoin. In this regard, I\u2019m expecting Bitcoin to reach US$28,100 next week.\u201d\n\n(Updates to trim repetition, add sub-heads.)"

        "title": "Analyst: This is what can be expected from Bitcoin price before the next halving in April 2023 - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price has historically breached the macro downtrend between 365 to 397 days before a halving.\n\nThe next Bitcoin halving is scheduled for April 2023, which stands to be within the expected range of the breakout.\n\nOn the micro-scale, BTC is performing exceptionally, reinforcing Bitcoin season.\n\nBitcoin is still the flagbearer of the crypto industry, and a lot is expected out of the biggest cryptocurrency in the world. While BTC has not been able to deliver per the expectation for a while now, things might be changing soon if this setup plays out.\n\nBitcoin in the macro timeframe\n\nBitcoin price dropped from its all-time high of $67,500 in 2022 to trade at $27,000 at the time of writing. Many analyses tried to pin this drawdown on macroeconomic events as well as internal crypto company failures. However, per crypto analyst and trader Rekt Capital, these events actually structured the repeat of a pattern.\n\nSince the halving of 2016, Bitcoin price has been following this pattern which has played out successfully twice in a row now. According to Rekt Capital, BTC moved to form lows per a macro downtrend which the biggest cryptocurrency in the world broke out of close to a year before the halving.\n\nIn 2015 this happened 366 days before the halving, and a similar occurrence took place in 2019 395 days before the halving. Should this setup play out again, Bitcoin would successfully repeat this pattern for the third time as the next halving of April 2023 stands only 397 days away.\n\nBitcoin breakout before halving\n\nIf the monthly candlestick close of Bitcoin is above the downtrend line, the macro downtrend would be invalidated. Breaking out of the same would potentially support a price rise in the long run. This is because the breakout before the previous halving noted BTC increasing by more than 183%. Although a similar rise cannot be expected this time around, the crypto asset would at least keep above $25,000.\n\nBitcoin season once again\n\nBitcoin price on the micro-scale has been performing pretty well, considering the nearly 35% rise observed by the cryptocurrency in the last seven days. Trading at $27,700, BTC rose from almost falling below $19,000.\n\nBut the rise in Bitcoin price was not met with similar enthusiasm in the case of altcoins, as only some of them managed to mark significant rises. Most of the top 50 altcoins over the last 90 days had lesser increases than BTC.\n\nBitcoin season\n\nConsequently, the market regressed to the Bitcoin season. For the altcoin season to arrive again, 75% of the top 50 altcoins must perform better than Bitcoin, which seems far away for now."

Source: OpenAI\n\nAs GPT-4\u2019s knowledge and training are current only to September 2021, Cointelegraph fed it year-end round-ups for 2021 and 2022 along with its Markets news and most read stories over the past seven days to understand how it would invest based on the most recent events.\n\nIt noted that the current state of the crypto market has been volatile, with \u201cvarious factors\u201d influencing prices.\n\n\u201cThe recent Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failures have led to increased uncertainty in the financial sector. This situation, combined with regulatory pressure and macroeconomic factors, has contributed to fluctuations in cryptocurrency prices.\u201d\n\nWith the context in mind, it advised the $100 be allocated as follows:\n\n$50 to Bitcoin\n\n$25 to Ether\n\n$15 to ATOM\n\n$10 to \u201cNFT and Web3 related projects\u201d\n\nOn Bitcoin, GPT-4 said that despite short-term volatility and a recent price drop, it still has strong long-term potential:\n\n\u201cThe overall trend shows that Bitcoin acts as a safe haven during times of financial instability, such as the recent Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failures. Additionally, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance is nearing 50%, and some analysts predict a move towards $100k.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, GPT-4 suggested that Ethereum\u2019s upcoming Shanghai upgrade could strengthen its dominance and benefit liquid staking providers.\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s price is also showing signs of recovery, making it a suitable addition to the portfolio,\u201d it added.\n\nThe chatbot then recommended allocating $15 to ATOM, due to Cosmos\u2019 launch of Interchain Security, which \u201ccould create potential growth opportunities for ATOM.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's a promising project in the blockchain space, and the launch could attract more investors,\u201d it wrote.\n\nBallerGPT\u2019s balance as at the time of writing.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin Miner Stocks Soared This Week - Nasdaq",
        "content": "What happened\n\nCryptocurrencies soared this week. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) led the way, with a 22.2% price gain from the stock market's closing bell last Friday to the same time this Thursday.\n\nOver the same period, that price surge powered an even stronger updraft under the stocks of leading Bitcoin mining specialists:\n\nSo what\n\nBitcoin and friends saw a couple of distinct jumps in the last week.\n\nFirst, several banks with close ties to the crypto sector were shut down by Californian regulators late last week; this was followed by a federal promise to allow customers to access any funds they had deposited in the failing banks. The Federal Reserve's guarantee of billions of dollars that help power the trading systems behind Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies resulted in a price surge over the weekend.\n\nThen, traders put their thinking caps on and started pondering what the bank closures might mean for the American economy at large. By Tuesday morning, many investors agreed that the Federal Reserve's inflation-fighting interest rate hikes had gone too far. Therefore, what at first looked like a threat to the entire crypto market should actually inspire the central bank to lighten up its anti-inflation measures, and let banks breathe more freely with lower interest rates on federal funds. That's seen as a positive development for Bitcoin, ahead of next week's scheduled rate-setting conference.\n\nAnd as Bitcoin goes, so do the miners -- though their stock-price moves tend to amplify whatever the cryptocurrency's chart is doing. These miners are not just holding a bunch of Bitcoin on their balance sheets; they also strive to make and buy more of the digital currency over time. This strategy adds to their value when Bitcoin prices are rising, but also increases the risk involved in running their businesses.\n\nBitcoin mining rigs are not cheap, and they draw an incredible amount of electric power. Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA), Hut 8 Mining (NASDAQ: HUT), and Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT) run their business operations with bottom-line margins deep in red-ink territory, keeping the lights on by taking on debt and selling more stock on the open market.\n\nSo these companies rely on Bitcoin gaining value in the long run, while also building out their crypto-mining rigs as fast as they dare. But a few management missteps or a too-harsh crypto winter could puncture the whole business model, leaving shareholders penniless.\n\nThat combination of long-term financial gains above and beyond Bitcoin's price development, plus the constant threat of financial collapse, adds up to massive volatility. So the miners outperformed Bitcoin in this week's surge, and they're doing great in 2023 overall. Bitcoin's price is up 51% year to date, while all three of the miners above more than doubled in value.\n\nNow what\n\nThe pricing trends play out on longer time scales, too. For example, Bitcoin is down by 36% in 52 weeks, but the Bitcoin miners have taken haircuts ranging from 57% to 69% over the same span. On a chart of the last year, the deep price drops and giant leaps of recent weeks are just another little divot in the larger trend line:\n\nIt's always fun to see your stocks and cryptocurrencies do well, but you also need to keep those inflated risks in mind. It may sound strange, but buying Bitcoin directly is a much safer and more conservative option than investing in any of the miner stocks.

        "content": "Crypto investors should know by now that it doesn\u2019t take much to topple a distressed multi-billion-dollar firm. On March 10, California regulators officially shut down Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) 48 hours after the company disclosed it was in financial distress. As Cointelegraph reported at the time, SVB is the first Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured bank to fail in 2023. That crucial detail prompted federal regulators in the United States to step up and backstop SVB depositors before a bank run could ensue. Although government protections weren\u2019t enough to stem a massive drop in bank stocks once markets reopened on Monday, Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market soared. Did FDIC bail out Bitcoin? Only time will tell.\n\nThe SVB fiasco triggered a short but intense period of fear and trepidation in crypto markets as Circle\u2019s USD Coin (USDC) depegged. The only thing Circle did wrong was holding a portion of its deposits at SVB when it collapsed.\n\nThis week\u2019s Crypto Biz tries to make sense of SVB\u2019s failure and how it affected crypto markets.\n\nSilicon Valley Bank shut down by California regulator\n\nOn March 10, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation shut down Silicon Valley Bank and appointed FDIC as the receiver to protect insured deposits. The news triggered a fire sale in crypto and financial markets as SVB was a top-20 U.S. bank by total assets. So, what compelled regulators to close the bank? Earlier in the week, SVB released its mid-quarter financial update, which disclosed a $1.8 billion loss tied to securities sales and the need to raise $2.25 billion to shore up operations. SVB was a trusted partner of many crypto-focused venture capital firms, but its demise was ultimately tied to duration risk, not crypto industry exposure. Washington put out the SVB fire quickly by announcing that all depositors, and not just accounts worth up to $250,000, would be protected. President Joe Biden later confirmed that shoring up depositors would not cost the taxpayer anything.\n\nCustomers lining up outside of Silicon Valley Bank at its Menlo Park, CA branch. pic.twitter.com/SDNrSUC1C0 \u2014 Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) March 10, 2023\n\nCircle \u2018able to access\u2019 $3.3B of USDC reserves at Silicon Valley Bank, CEO says\n\nOne of the companies caught in the crosshairs of SVB was stablecoin issuer Circle, which had $3.3 billion in reserves tied up at the failed bank. USDC lost stablecoin market share \u2014 and its peg to the U.S. dollar \u2014 once SVB collapsed because it wasn\u2019t clear if and when Circle could access its funds. At its lowest point, USDC fell to around $0.87. The stablecoin has since returned to par with the dollar, with Circle confirming it could access reserves held at SVB. Circle lost significant market share over the past week due to ongoing USDC redemptions. USDC\u2019s market cap currently stands at $38.4 billion, less than half of rival Tether, whose USDT is valued at nearly $73.6 billion.\n\nBreaking: Signature Bank closed by New York regulators, citing \u2018systemic risk\u2019\n\nSVB wasn\u2019t the only crypto-friendly bank collapse this week. On March 12, the Manhattan-based Signature Bank was officially shuttered by the New York Department of Financial Services, allegedly to protect the U.S. economy and strengthen the public\u2019s confidence in the banking system. \u201cThe actions that we took today were designed to limit the consequences of the depositor outflows from Silicon Valley and from Signature and to reduce any spillover effects,\u201d a Treasury official reportedly said. Like SVB depositors, all accountholders at Signature will be made whole without affecting taxpayers. Signature Bank had nearly $89 billion in deposits as of Dec. 31, 2022.\n\n@federalreserve @USTreasury @FDICgov issue statement on actions to protect the U.S. economy by strengthening public confidence in our banking system, ensuring depositors' savings remain safe: https://t.co/YISeTdFPrO \u2014 Federal Reserve (@federalreserve) March 12, 2023\n\nSouth Korea launches \u2018Metaverse Fund\u2019 to expedite domestic initiatives\n\n\u201cMetaverse\u201d is still a vague and underdeveloped concept, but South Korea is taking it very seriously. Seoul\u2019s Ministry of Science and ICT announced it would allocate 24 billion won ($18.1 million) toward metaverse development as part of a bigger pot worth 40 billion won ($30.2 million). The newly launched Metaverse Fund is said to support mergers and acquisitions of various metaverse-related companies \u2014 a move that could give the country an upper hand in the still-evolving sector. The metaverse arms race continues. As Cointelegraph reported earlier this month, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta won court approval to continue its metaverse acquisition plans.\n\nCrypto Biz is your weekly pulse of the business behind blockchain and crypto, delivered directly to your inbox every Thursday."

        "title": "Bitcoin Is Now Directly Correlated With The US Dollar - NewsBTC",
        "content": "In the ongoing banking crisis in the United States, the US Dollar (USD) appears to correlate directly with Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Positively Correlates With USD\n\nAccording to Kaiko, a digital assets market provider, Bitcoin, the most valuable cryptocurrency, appears to be moving synchronously with the USD as the market adopts a wait-and-see approach amid fear of further turbulence in the United States financial markets.\n\nHistorically, #Bitcoin has had an inverse correlation with the U.S. Dollar. Over the past month, this negative correlation has mostly disappeared amid a wider market rally. pic.twitter.com/Q9H0T4k51M \u2014 Kaiko (@KaikoData) March 17, 2023\n\nHistorically, Kaiko notes, Bitcoin moves inversely with USD. That means whenever the USD rallies, Bitcoin tends to crumble. This has been observed in the last few months, especially throughout 2022, resulting in what was known as the crypto winter.\n\nAs USD strengthened across the board in 2022, crypto prices, including BTC, weren\u2019t spared. To illustrate, Bitcoin crashed from as high as $69,000 registered in November 2021, dropping below $20,000 in November 2022.\n\nThe crypto meltdown was made worse by the collapse of UST, an algorithmic stablecoin by Terra, the crash of several centralized finance projects like Voyager Digital and BlockFi, and the spectacular fall of FTX, the Sam Bankman-Fried exchange in November.\n\nThe bankruptcy and failure of some of these platforms dented user confidence, forcing a capital flight to safe havens beyond the crypto markets to gold and the USD.\n\nAt some point in 2022, for example, DXY data, an index that tracks the USD, showed that the greenback strengthened by over 20%.\n\nDuring that time, BTC more than halved, demonstrating the relationship between the USD and Bitcoin.\n\nThe DXY measures the strength of the USD against a basket of other currencies, including the Japanese Yen, Euro, Chinese Yuan, and others. The index will rise if the USD is strong and dip if it falls relative to these currencies.\n\nThe Tide Is Changing\n\nAs of mid-March 2023, Kaiko observes that rallying Bitcoin and crypto prices seems to coincide with the relative strengthening of the USD; and is shifting. When BTC prices rose from $19,700 last week to $26,300, the USD added 3% from late February 2023. The USD holds firm despite questions being raised concerning the monetary policy approach adopted by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThere have been more questions about the effectiveness and the speed of rate hikes in the past few months. Although inflation is lower, it is not at ideal levels.\n\nThe Fed aims to eventually reduce inflation to around the 2% benchmark level. While critics descend on the Fed, the USD is steady, syncing with Bitcoin, that\u2019s relatively higher.\n\nFeature Image From Canva, Chart From TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin posted impressive gains of over 6% in the past 24 hours, reaching a high of $26,350 on Friday morning, per data from CoinGecko.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price surge came alongside a wider uplift in the cryptocurrency market, which saw the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies rise over 4% in the past day, to $1.17 trillion. It follows a rise in U.S. and Asian stock markets after major lenders in J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and others agreed to inject $30 billion to save U.S.-based First Republic Bank from insolvency, promoting risk-on sentiments.\n\nEarlier this week, U.S. inflation data for February came along the lines of market expectations, showing signs of slowing down. The CME FedWatch tool shows that traders have put an 84.1% chance that the Fed will raise rates by 25 bps, while the rest predict that Fed could also maintain the current rate.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe dollar's yield is declining as the Fed potentially moves away from quantitative tightening, prompting renewed interest in risk-on assets like stocks and crypto from investors.\n\nEntering a regime of \u201cQE light\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, the European Central Bank also raised its benchmark interest rate by 50 base points (bps), putting further pressure on DXY with a relatively higher-yielding euro than the dollar.\n\n\"Bitcoin is reacting to the increase in the Fed's balance sheet and the form of \"quantitative easing (QE) light\" taken in response to Silicon Valley Bank,\" Nathan Batchelor, managing partner at Biyond Trader, told Decrypt. He added that, \"Technically Bitcoin is wildly bullish above $25,000 and looks to be targeting $28,000 at a minimum.\"\n\nAnother factor influencing Bitcoin's price is the risk of a global banking crisis. Banks worldwide in Europe and the U.S. are facing a potential insolvency crisis. While the state governments and other larger institutions like J.P. Morgan have backstopped the fallout for now, uncertainty around a banking failure is helping to build positive sentiment around decentralized alternatives such as Bitcoin."

        "title": "10 Reasons to Invest in Bitcoin Over Other Cryptocurrency - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "This article mentions the reasons to invest in Bitcoin over other cryptocurrencies\n\nAs a substitute for conventional currencies like the US dollar, euro, or pound sterling, bitcoin is a digital cryptocurrency that has grown in popularity recently. Although many investors presently refer to bitcoin as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d it may potentially be utilized as a digital form of money. Since the quantity of bitcoin is set, as opposed to the supply of fiat currencies like the US dollar or Japanese yen, investors believe that investing in Bitcoin over other cryptocurrencies will increase in value over time. These are ten reasons to invest in Bitcoin over other currencies.\n\nBitcoin is decentralized because it is not governed by any one entity, including a government or financial institution, so it is not bound by the same rules and limitations as conventional currencies. This increases user financial autonomy and lowers the possibility of political meddling or currency manipulation.\n\nTransactions with Bitcoin are frequently quicker and less expensive than those involving traditional money exchanges because there are no middlemen involved. This can be especially helpful for overseas transactions, which with traditional currencies can be cumbersome and expensive.\n\nCompared to many conventional solutions, Investing in Bitcoin is more secure since it employs encryption to thwart fraud and hacking.\n\nBitcoin is a deflationary currency, meaning its value tends to rise over time, in contrast to traditional currencies, which tend to lose value over time owing to inflation.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin may be used for transactions anywhere in the world, it is a practical choice for cross-border trade.\n\nWidely used: Bitcoin is being used for an increasing number of purchases and transactions as it is being accepted by more and more businesses and merchants worldwide.\n\nFinancial anonymity: Because transactions can be done without disclosing personal information, Bitcoin offers users better financial privacy and anonymity than traditional currencies.\n\nBitcoin may be divided into smaller parts, which increases its adaptability to transactions of various amounts.\n\nWith a fixed number of 21 million coins, bitcoin is a scarce asset with the potential to appreciate over time.\n\nBitcoin provides investors with the possibility for significant returns and portfolio diversity because it is a relatively young and volatile asset. Yet it\u2019s crucial to remember that buying Bitcoin can also be hazardous, so you should proceed with caution.\n\nDue to the low price correlations that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have traditionally had with the US stock market, owning some can help you diversify your portfolio. If you think that people will use cryptocurrencies more frequently in the future, it makes sense for you to directly purchase some as part of a diversified investment portfolio. Be careful to have an investment thesis outlining why each cryptocurrency you invest in will endure the test of time. You ought to be able to manage the investment risk as part of your overall portfolio if you conduct adequate research and learn as much as you can about how to invest in cryptocurrencies.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

When it comes to cryptocurrency options, the platform dominates, capturing most of the Bitcoin and Ether options markets. It also offers cryptocurrency futures instruments.\n\n\u201cBTC DVOL futures are an exciting new product that will help traders to hedge their positions and take advantage of market volatility while also serving as a tool for additional risk management, alpha generation, and portfolio diversification,\u201d Jansen added. \u201cThis product is particularly useful for those who want exposure to volatility but do not want to trade complex options strategies.\u201d\n\nTiming the Market\n\nDeribit is launching the new product when the cryptocurrency market has gained a strong upward momentum following a crisis in the American banking industry. Moreover, two US banks, Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank, went under Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation receivership, while another, Silvergate Bank, declared voluntary liquidation.\n\nBitcoin gained about 36 percent in the last seven days and is trading above $27,000 as of press time.

Speculators can also have clean Vega bets by trading DVOL futures while avoiding the complexities of path dependency.\u201d"

        "content": "What are Bitcoin Ordinals? Digital Artifacts: Explained\n\nBy Linda Orenes-Lerma\n\nRead 6 min Medium\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS: \u2014 Bitcoin Ordinals are not NFTs, but they have some similar qualities. For example, the value of each Ordinal is completely unique.\n\n\n\n\u2014 The information for Ordinals is stored completely on-chain, with some calling them \u201cDigital Artifacts\u201d.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Ordinals are often compared to NFTs, but there are critical differences: Ordinals do not use smart contracts and are not programmable.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals have become a major Web3 contender, spreading excitement, debate, and even some confusion across the crypto-sphere. Ordinals introduce novel options for the Bitcoin network that are not yet fully explored, such as including images and text in transactions.\n\nYou might think that Bitcoin Ordinals sound a lot like NFTs, and you wouldn\u2019t be the first. While they do have some similarities, Ordinals don\u2019t use smart contracts. While blockchain apps on most blockchain networks use smart contracts to implement a wide range of future behaviors, Ordinals work a little differently.\n\nLike an NFT, they can store data, but conversely, they cannot execute any actions using smart contracts. And technically, ordinals aren\u2019t even tokens. So what are they exactly?\n\nWhat Are Bitcoin Ordinals?\n\nBitcoin Ordinals are much like the Bitcoin blockchain\u2019s version of NFTs. Like NFTs, their value is dependent on the information they include rather than as tokens themselves. They may contain an image or some text, or perhaps they are created to act as tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin ordinals are not exactly NFTs, as they are literal pieces of Bitcoin inscribed with rich data instead. To explain, an ordinal is always worth one Satoshi, a 1/100,000,000th of a Bitcoin (the smallest denomination possible). Being such a small fraction of a Bitcoin, a Satoshi isn\u2019t worth much: its true value mainly depends on the contents of its inscription.\n\nThink of an artist creating a piece of art on a dollar bill. While the bill itself is only worth a dollar, the art on it could potentially be priceless. This is essentially what a Bitcoin ordinal is: a Satoshi with its own unique value. But there\u2019s a bit more to it than that. Let\u2019s dive into the history to understand why.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals Protocol: The History of Ordinals\n\nWhile attaching data to Bitcoin has always been possible through technical loopholes, the amount of data you could attach was limited. In 2021, Bitcoin underwent an upgrade named Taproot. The Taproot upgrade brought higher levels of privacy, security, and scalability to the Bitcoin network. But most importantly, it allowed transactions to contain up to 4Mbs of data, opening up the possibility to support images.\n\nUsing this capability, together with his own fascination with the denominations of Bitcoin, Casey Rodarmor launched the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol in January 2023. The new Ordinals protocol made it much easier for Bitcoin node operators to link data with each of these pieces of Bitcoin, thus creating Ordinals.\n\nIn doing so, he opened up a whole new world for Bitcoin users. Bitcoin Ordinals were an instant hit, with their popularity extending into the present. Today, innovators are still building on and around the original protocol, introducing assets such as the BRC-20 token and Bitcoin Stamps.\n\nHow do Bitcoin Ordinals Work? Rarity Explained\n\nThe Ordinals protocol makes use of something that already existed on the Bitcoin network: a sequential order of satoshis. To explain, each Satoshi has an assigned ordinal number between 0 and 2,100,000,000,000,000, based on the time it was mined. This numbering system means some satoshis are rarer than others.\n\nTo clarify, the Bitcoin network operates on a series of frequent events that can lead to rare occurrences, thus the sats mined during these significant periods can be deemed collectible. Sats mined in the first block( by Satoshi Nakamoto himself ) are just one instance of a rare occurrence.\n\nSince ordinals are inscribed directly on sats, they have an in-built rarity system. To learn more about other occurrences that create rare Sats, make sure you check out Rodarmor\u2019s documentation here.\n\nMost Famous Bitcoin Ordinals So Far\n\nTo understand how the Ordinals ecosystem is developing, let\u2019s take a look at a few of the collections that have emerged so far.\n\nTwelveFold By Yuga Labs\n\nBy far the most famous Bitcoin Ordinal collection so far has to be \u2018TwelveFold\u2019 by Yuga Labs. The limited collection features 300 pieces of generative art, combining both 3D graphics and hand-drawn features.\n\nThe idea behind the collection is to \u201cExplore the relationship between time, mathematics, and the blockchain\u201d, according to the Yuga Labs creative director. To explain, 144 blocks of Bitcoin are mined a day, which could also be interpreted as 12\u00d712. Each piece in the Yuga Labs collection is a 12\u00d712 grid, naming the collection \u2018TwelveFold\u2019, referencing that fact.\n\nThe auction spanned for 24 hours, starting on March 6th, 2023. Of the 300-strong collection, 288 ordinals were available to bid on \u2013 and they were popular indeed. This single auction racked up a total of 3,246 bids, with the successful bidders spending between $50,000 to just over $150k for a single piece.\n\nOrdinal Punks\n\nOrdinal Punks are a collection of 100 Bitcoin Ordinals paying tribute to the popular Ethereum NFT collection CryptoPunks. Ordinal Punks are using an open-source algorithm to generate the pfp which is 192\u00d7192 pixels. However, it\u2019s important to note that this collection is not the most easy to buy and sell, as bids and asks are handled on a Google Sheet by the project\u2019s creator, acting as an escrow manager. All transactions are monitored and tracked via Discord.\n\nTaproot Wizards\n\nTaproot Wizards is an Ordinal collection created by independent Web3 developer Udi Wertheimer, and securely stored on the Bitcoin network. Starting from Inscription 652, each wizard in this collection is a unique NFT that has been hand-drawn by Udi himself. This special collection harnesses the immutability of the Bitcoin blockchain to securely store these one-of-a-kind digital artifacts.\n\nAll sales are handled through Taproot Wizards Discord.\n\nOrdinal Loops\n\nOrdinal Loops offering comes in the form of Object 0, an NFT that rotates and has a mathematical torus design. It\u2019s one of seven similar animations and is part of the first series from the Ordinal Loops team. The current narrative chapter, \u201cDo Not Fiat,\u201d features Bitcoin ASCII fighting an army consisting of five main government currencies endlessly.\n\nTimeChain Collectibles\n\nTimechain Collectibles presents the Series 1 Timepieces, a highly limited collection of 21 Ordinals. They depict many different kinds of timepieces, including pocket watches, wristwatches, cyberpunk alarm clocks, and more. The collection launched on January 30th, 2023 and each piece carries its own consecutive Inscription number from 356 to 377. Inscription 364 sold for an impressive 3.08 BTC/43.59 ETH ($67000) in Jan 2023, showing how desirable these collectibles are! You can find TimeChain Collectibles auctions via the project\u2019s Discord.\n\nNodeMonkes\n\nNodeMonkes is the first collection of 10k inscriptions using the ordinals protocol. Featuring pixel art of web3\u2019s favorite animal, NodeMonkes is currently one of the most popular Ordinals projects. Much like traditional 10k NFT collections, this Bitcoin ordinals project uses a range of traits. Each NodeMonke features a different selection of the available traits, adding to the built-in rarity system offered by sats. This sets it apart from other ordinals, which tend to have smaller collections and less variety in traits.\n\nWhile it originally launched as a free mint, a single NodeMonke will set you back 0.7BTC (at the time of writing). Since its launch in November 2023, the project has been well received, with many buyers believing it\u2019s \u201cup-only\u201d from here. Only time will tell if that\u2019s accurate, but for now, NodeMonkes is a project to watch.\n\nHow to Buy and Sell Bitcoin Ordinals\n\nBitcoin Ordinals are innovative assets only created in 2023, thus there isn\u2019t a huge ecosystem that supports them currently. As such, the first Ordinals traders relied mainly on over-the-counter trades using new and un-battle-tested platforms.\n\nAvoid OTC Trades If You Can\n\nDiscord is popular for brokering over-the-counter (OTC) deals, with the official Ordinals Discord server offering a lot of users their first taste of the asset class. However, since a lot of these trades can be tricky to understand, buying Bitcoin Ordinals this way is not recommended. If you decide to engage in an OTC trade for a Bitcoin ordinal anyway, do so with caution as you could be walking into a trap.\n\nA much safer way of buying and selling ordinals is using a trusted marketplace.\n\nUse Bitcoin Ordinal Marketplaces\n\nCurrently, there aren\u2019t a huge number of choices when it comes to Bitcoin Ordinals marketplaces. However, that\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t any at all. Today, there are a few main places to buy ordinals. And as time goes by, more and more of these platforms support familiar means of connecting your wallet and buying assets.\n\nGenerative.xyz\n\nGenerative.xyz is a marketplace specifically for buying and selling Bitcoin Ordinals. It calls itself the \u201cArt Blocks of Bitcoin Ordinals\u201d, offering a platform primarily for generative art on the Bitcoin network. As the first marketplace of its kind, it has attracted some of the biggest artists in web3 today, including Twin Flames artist and Photographer Justin Aversano.\n\nGenerative.xyz also allows you to inscribe and store ordinals in its platform-specific wallet which is compatible with MetaMask. However, using this combination of wallets comes with a risk: revealing your private keys via your internet connection. That\u2019s because software wallets store private keys on their host device, meaning they are vulnerable to online threats.\n\nMagic Eden\n\nMagic Eden, a popular NFT marketplace, has also launched support for Bitcoin Ordinals. To manage them via Magic Eden, you must set up a wallet specifically for managing these types of assets. Magic Eden currently supports Xverse, Leather (Hiro), Unisat, and OKX. From there, you have access to a trusted platform with a simple interface. Buying a Bitcoin Ordinal using Magic Eden is just as simple as buying an NFT.\n\nWallets for Bitcoin Ordinals\n\nTo manage ordinals, you will need a wallet that supports these types of assets. Thus you need a bitcoin wallet.\n\nAlthough they are Bitcoin assets, you wouldn\u2019t want to mix your main BTC holdings with your Ordinals. This is due to how the Bitcoin network functions. Any time you receive BTC, it\u2019s actually in the form of an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO). While the whole explanation is a little more complicated, think of your UTXOs like unspent change. Each time you spend on the Bitcoin network you pay with an entire UTXO and receive the rest of your balance \u201cback\u201d via another UTXO. Accordingly, that\u2019s also where you\u2019ll find the data for Bitcoin Ordinals; in that pile of unspent change.\n\nDue to this fact, sending Bitcoin from a wallet that holds ordinals will risk sending your Ordinal instead, thus you\u2019ll need to have separate accounts for each asset type. The other thing you\u2019ll need to bear in mind is its Taproot support. To manage ordinals, your wallet must be taproot compatible.\n\nSo, with that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at some of the most popular Bitcoin Ordinals wallets.\n\nLeather (Hiro) Wallet\n\nLeather, formerly known as Hiro, is a software wallet for Bitcoin and alternative assets like Ordinals, BRC-20 tokens, and Stamps. Like all software wallets, Leather comes with the risk of revealing your private keys via your internet connection. Luckily, if you plan to use Leather to manage your ordinals, you can use it in tandem with your Ledger device to keep your assets safe.\n\nPhantom Wallet\n\nPhantom wallet is a cross-chain software wallet that also allows you to secure, manage and interact with bitcoin ordinals. Although it started as a Solana wallet, it now supports countless networks, including the Bitcoin network. Managing Ordinals with Phantom is as easy as any other NFT or alternative asset. It also supports BRC-20 tokens.\n\nAnd of course, you can connect a Ledger Bitcoin account to Phantom to interact with Bitcoin Ordinals securely.\n\nSparrow Wallet\n\nSparrow is a software wallet for Bitcoin, not specifically for Bitcoin ordinals. That means you will need to change the settings specifically to unlock this functionality. If you\u2019re a beginner, you may want to avoid this method and go for something easier. However, you can use sparrow with Ledger devices to keep your assets safe.\n\nHow To Secure Your Ordinals: Use Your Ledger\n\nWhichever wallet you\u2019re using, you should always generate a new address when receiving an ordinal. You can label your separate addresses in most wallets that support them and this will stop you from sending your Ordinal accidentally.\n\nThe other most important piece of advice is: protect your ordinals with a hardware wallet! Using any of the mentioned software wallets that support Bitcoin Ordinals alone will not keep your assets safe. Software wallets cannot keep your keys away from the internet, meaning they are not very secure. To ensure your security, connect your Leather, Sparrow, or Phantom wallet to a Ledger device. That way, you can guarantee your private keys\u2014and thus your assets\u2014are protected from online threats such as malware or spyware.\n\nTo secure your Ordinals using a Ledger device, you will need to follow these steps\n\nMake sure your device is up to date with the latest firmware If you haven\u2019t already, install the Bitcoin app on your Ledger device via Ledger Live Open the app and create a new Bitcoin account, selecting Taproot as its type Your wallet will create a new Bitcoin Taproot account with a new address Now your account is ready to receive Ordinals\n\nOnce you have this account set up you can actually send Ordinals to it directly using the Ord wallet. This might get a little technical but if you understand the risk it entails, follow this tutorial.\n\nAs mentioned, a better option is connecting the new account to one of the previously mentioned wallets that support Bitcoin Ordinals. Once you\u2019ve connected your new account to the software wallet\u2019s interface, you\u2019ll be able to interact with Bitcoin Ordinals easily. And of course, your Ledger device will keep your keys safe at the same time.\n\nHow to Inscribe a Bitcoin Ordinal\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in inscribing your very own ordinal, your first option will have you running a Bitcoin node and syncing it to the Bitcoin blockchain before you even think about touching an ordinal. This process can get pretty technical. But the good news is that there\u2019s a less complicated alternative: using a service instead. Today there are a few easy ways to inscribe ordinals but some of the most popular platforms include:\n\nGamma\n\nGamma is a no-code tool that allows users to inscribe an ordinal in minutes; and without having to download or run a fully synced Bitcoin node. The tool also offers affordable and customizable transaction fees, a great feature for creators. The platform is easy to navigate and use, offering a great option for beginners. However, it\u2019s important to note you will have to pay a service fee on top of the BTC transaction fee.\n\nMagic Eden\n\nMagic Eden launched its Bitcoin Ordinals inscription service in April 2023. From that moment on, any Magic Eden user could easily create Bitcoin Ordinals directly within the platform. You can inscribe images or files onto sats to create unique ordinals. Alternatively, you can create fungible BRC-20 tokens with a fixed supply or even web3 domains. With the marketplace\u2019s previous experience with NFTs, Magic Eden\u2019s inscription tool successfully offers plenty of options paired with an easy-to-use interface.\n\nOrdinals Bot\n\nOrdinals bot is another no-code tool that allows you to inscribe all sorts of Ordinals with ease. You can create inscriptions with images or text. It also offers options for creating BRC-20 tokens\n\nor TAP tokens. You can even easily create Bitcoin domains and .bitmap districts too. Ordinals bot has a huge selection of options for you and also offers them via a simple interface.\n\nThe Future of Bitcoin Ordinals Inscriptions\n\nBitcoin Ordinals gained in popularity quickly, with 100,000 inscriptions in the protocol\u2019s first four days. Since the Bitcoin network is slower and stores all information on-chain, Ordinals could stand to become just as important to web3 as NFTs. Put simply, they are collector\u2019s items on the world\u2019s largest blockchain. As a result, securing them is just as important as our other digital assets.\n\nAs any enthusiast should know, it\u2019s risky to use software wallets and new and untested crypto platforms. To ensure your crypto is safe, your only option is to keep your keys offline and understand transactions before you sign them. This is where Ledger Devices come in. While the ordinal ecosystem is still growing, engaging in it comes with risks. If you decide to do so, make sure to secure your private keys with a hardware wallet, such as that Ledger offers. Ledger Devices offer unparalleled security of your digital assets, and when securing digital artifacts such as Bitcoin Ordinals, it\u2019s imperative to keep your keys safe and offline.\n\nKnowledge is Power."

        "title": "Could Bitcoin [BTC] be on course for another green weekend - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Analyst suggests that BTC could get a key breakout in the short term.\n\nThe Bitcoin network value remains expensive relative to the price but the coin could still hit a yearly crest.\n\nSince 2023 began, a number of weekends have acted as stepping stones for Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] production of green bars.\n\nInterestingly, the 11-13 March period of last week was no different. But with the coin losing and regaining price levels at different intervals, what do the next few days hold for BTC?\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nWell, a digital assets trader by the name of Markus Thielen on Twitter opined that the BTC might not stall its movement at $26,000. Thielen based his judgment on his technical analysis. There, he showed that BTC has long-term support.\n\nLittle beginnings may be faced with hurdles\n\nBesides, the chart revealed that the mid-term downtrend could be over. And a short-term breakout at $25,817 was already in motion. According to the analyst, BTC had the potential to end up at $28,000 soon.\n\nThere have been calls for the king coin to hit $30,000 before any other major retrace lately. So, Thielen\u2019s opinion could not be outrightly dismissed. However, enthusiasts with this viewpoint may need to exercise caution.\n\nOne metric that suggested the stance above is the Network to Value Transaction (NVT) in relation to the BTC circulation. The circulation NVT provides an overview of an asset\u2019s growth potential. This is derived using the Price-to-Earnings ratio and rate of daily circulation.\n\nAt press time, the circulation NVT was extremely high at point 538. A high circulation NVT indicates that an asset\u2019s network valuation is higher than the current value displayed on the network.\n\nSo, this means that the current BTC value was not cheap compared to its expensive network.\n\nWill backup and support prevail?\n\nHowever, the NVT condition did not totally cancel the possibility of a further uptick for BTC. This was because whales\u2019 interest in the coin remains intensified.\n\nAt press time, Santiment data showed that there has been a sustained increase in six to seven figures BTC transactions. A situation like this confirms buying pressure from this group. Also, the same whales had reduced selling some parts of their holdings as reported lately.\n\nAs per the daily chart, BTC seemed in a prime position to follow through with its increase based on the Awesome Oscillator (AO).\n\nThe indicator helps to assess market momentum in relation to trend affirmation, reversal, weakness, and strength. With the AO at 1455.59, it means that BTC had enough support to reach the price level suggested by Thielen.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nFurthermore, the Directional Movement Index (DMI) also suggested a similar sentiment. At press time, the +DMI(green) was 39.03. And backing it up was the Average Directional Index (ADX), which was at 27.10."

        "title": "Why everyone should read 'The Bitcoin Letters' by Bryan Daugherty - CoinGeek",
        "content": "Instead of arguing on social media, we should spend more time educating people on BSV\u2019s cost benefits, efficiencies and potential for economic development. We hear that cry often, but how many people actually work 24/7 to do it? One person who does is Bryan Daugherty, co-founder and Chairman of Smartledger.\n\nIn what he calls a \u201ctransparent attempt at lobbying,\u201d Daugherty has published \u201cThe Bitcoin Letters.\u201d It explains in detail why scalable Bitcoin is the best way to process and secure the world\u2019s information, as our lives and livelihoods are transformed ever-increasingly by data\u2014and all the implications this brings.\n\nDaugherty has also included the three letters that give the book its title: open letters to Elon Musk, New York Governor Kathy Hochul, and SEC Chair Gary Gensler. The letters not only outline BSV\u2019s case but also seek to clear up confusion about different blockchain networks claiming the \u201cBitcoin\u201d title and various misconceptions about the technology in general.\n\nAs part of his outreach efforts Daugherty has also written to and arranged in-person meetings with elected officials and policymakers, regulators and businesspeople. Many will be curious to know what the response has been. Are there reasons to be optimistic that education can still beat misinformation campaigns? Has knowledge and understanding of blockchain grown since Bitcoin first appeared in 2008, and how have more recent circumstances changed the way it\u2019s perceived?\n\nDaugherty spoke to CoinGeek in the interview below, shedding a lot of useful light on what other BSV proponents should expect away from the social media ring and out in the real world\u2014the place where real decisions get made and real money is spent.\n\nHaving spent large amount of his own personal resources in time, money and effort to spread the word, Daugherty wants others to know what discussions are occurring behind the scenes. Most of it remains unknown and it\u2019s not always what you\u2019d expect.\n\n\u201cThe Bitcoin Letters\u201d is available in paperback and Kindle from Amazon, and in ebook form from ImmutableBooks (who will sell it to you for BSV). An audiobook version is coming soon.\n\nRead the interview below to find out all the whats, whys and hows of Bitcoin lobbying (and BSV itself)\u2014as well as a better understanding of how those outside the industry actually perceive BSV.\n\nInterview with Bryan Daugherty, author of \u201cThe Bitcoin Letters\u201d\n\nWhat made you decide to write the book?\n\nMy intention in writing \u201cThe Bitcoin Letters\u201d was to tackle the misconceptions and misinformation surrounding Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. I aimed to provide clarity and insight into the true nature of Bitcoin and blockchain technology, which includes understanding the various competing versions of the protocol such as BTC, BCH, and BSV.\n\nWith this book, I sought to offer new perspectives that can help policymakers, regulators, and technology innovators gain a better understanding of the true purpose and potential of this groundbreaking technology.\n\nHow and where will it be available?\n\nThe Bitcoin Letters is available in both print and digital versions on Amazon, as well as through Immutable Books. Immutable Books offers a SmartLedger Proof-of-Concept that enables readers to pay for the book per page, chapter, or in its entirety using micro-transactions. This innovative distribution model showcases the potential for blockchain technology to improve existing pay-per-consumption models like that of Amazon. By leveraging the efficiency and security of blockchain, this new model can enhance the reading experience for customers while also benefiting authors and publishers.\n\nYou\u2019ve been pretty busy meeting with elected officials, regulators, and business leaders to talk about the benefits of an efficient, scalable blockchain network. Broadly speaking, what kind of reception did you get?\n\nIn my meetings with elected officials, regulators, and business leaders, I have been pleased to receive an overwhelmingly positive reception. I believe this is partly because many of the perspectives I share on topics related to blockchain are not commonly heard. There has been a heavy focus on the \u201ccrypto casino,\u201d and a significant amount of money has been spent on crypto lobbying, which has had an impact on the perceptions of some people.\n\nAs evidence of this, recent reports show a sharp increase in crypto lobbying expenditure over the last six years. For example, in 2022, Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) spent $3.30 million on lobbying, making it the highest spender in the crypto lobbying expenditure category. This was followed by Blockchain Association with $1.9 million and Robinhood with $1.84 million. The spending by Coinbase alone increased by 4137% in the last six years, from $80,000 in 2017 to $3.39 million in 2022. Additionally, close to half of the total lobbying spending by crypto companies came in 2022 itself, which was $25.57 million out of the last six years\u2019 total of $50.75 million.\n\nDespite the heavy crypto lobbying, I remain optimistic about the positive reception I have received in my meetings. My goal is to continue to spread awareness about the benefits of an efficient, scalable blockchain network, and to provide insights that can help people better understand the true potential of blockchain technology.\n\nWhat\u2019s their level of understanding?\n\nIn my experience, policymakers are still in the process of acquiring knowledge and resources in the realm of distributed ledger technology. Most of them have a one-dimensional understanding of Bitcoin and other digital currency assets, and I spend a great deal of time clarifying the distinction between blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. This is particularly important as policymakers begin to seek input from experts and solicit committee testimony. By helping to separate the conflation of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, I aim to provide policymakers with a more nuanced understanding of this emerging technology and its potential implications.\n\nIt is essential to provide policymakers with a more nuanced understanding of this emerging technology, particularly as it relates to national information security, national economic security, national energy security, and gaining a competitive advantage through innovation. By highlighting these critical aspects, I aim to help policymakers recognize the potential implications of blockchain technology and its impact on various industries. Through greater awareness and understanding, policymakers can make informed decisions and enact policies that promote the responsible adoption and integration of blockchain technology in society.\n\nWere any of them surprised to hear what you had to say, and did you change any minds?\n\nDuring my meetings with policymakers, blockchain and DLT experts, and industry leaders, I believe that all parties were surprised by some of the insights I shared. I myself was surprised by some of the reactions I received, as many officials were open to hearing new perspectives and gaining a deeper understanding of the utility side of blockchain technology.\n\nI have also received feedback from individuals who have read portions of my book and engaged with my ideas. Some of them have shared that my perspectives have changed their understanding of Bitcoin and its potential implications.\n\nWhile it is difficult to determine whether I have changed anyone\u2019s mind entirely, I believe that my efforts to provide a more nuanced understanding of blockchain technology have been well-received. As policymakers and industry leaders continue to learn more about this emerging technology, I am hopeful that we can work together to build a more efficient and sustainable blockchain network that benefits society as a whole.\n\nDo you feel like they truly understand what blockchain is for, or are interested in learning?\n\nBased on my interactions with policymakers, I believe that they recognize the potential of blockchain technology and its potential impact on various industries. While some may have a limited understanding of the technical aspects of blockchain, they are earnestly interested in learning more about its potential applications and implications.\n\nIn my experience, policymakers are receptive to new perspectives and are open to hearing from experts in the field. They seek ways to leverage its potential to drive innovation and improve efficiency.\n\nIt is important to note that the media also plays a significant influence in the discussion surrounding blockchain technology. Policymakers often take cues from media coverage to shape their understanding of the technology.\n\nSince the collapse of FTX, I have noticed a shift in the media\u2019s approach to reporting on blockchain technology. In my conversations with reporters, I have observed a greater willingness to understand the technology and report more accurate and insightful information about it. This is a positive development, as accurate reporting is crucial to help policymakers make informed decisions about the potential applications and implications of blockchain technology.\n\nOverall, I am optimistic about the level of interest and willingness to learn about true blockchain technology among policymakers and believe that this bodes well for the future of the technology.\n\nWhat issues seem to most concern elected representatives and regulators?\n\nElected representatives and their staff can have varying degrees of exposure and experiences depending on their affiliation and beliefs. In the United States, for example, the DNC tends to prioritize consumer protection and regulation of financial markets. Consequently, they have greater concerns over potential fraud, money laundering, and other illicit activities in the cryptocurrency space. Additionally, the DNC has shown concern for the environmental impact of digital currencies and blockchain technology.\n\nIn contrast, the GOP tends to be more supportive of the free market and innovation. As a result, they are more likely to support cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. However, the GOP also shows concern for national security, specifically the risk of cyberattacks and terrorist financing, which has led to greater scrutiny and regulation of digital assets.\n\nIt is important to note that these party differences are not absolute, and there is still a great deal of nuance and complexity in their respective positions. Ultimately, understanding these differences can provide insight into how policymakers may approach issues related to blockchain technology and digital assets.\n\nDid you encounter any resistance?\n\nI am pretty thankful that almost all of the representatives and agencies I have met with to date, (70+) have been extremely receptive to my perspective. I can recall only one instance where the staffer was unreceptive and did not welcome new perspectives. Despite this, we still had a very productive conversation about the historical events surrounding the development of Bitcoin, including the identity of its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nHas there been any response from the people you addressed them to?\n\nWe have received responses from the individuals and agencies we had meetings with and are actively collaborating with various House and Senate offices, as well as Federal and State Agencies. Our objective is to serve as a valuable resource and demonstrate how this technology can be harnessed to benefit not only the country as a whole, but also the representative states and towns of these offices. Through these collaborations, we aim to build constructive relationships and facilitate the responsible and effective implementation of blockchain technology.\n\nIn your opinion, do any business/political circumstances need to change for BSV to become more widely accepted as the \u201cuniversal ledger of truth\u201d?\n\nIn my view, the factors affecting the adoption of BSV as the universal ledger of truth are constantly evolving, and it\u2019s essential to remain flexible as events unfold. The timeline of events post-FTX has led to increased awareness among policymakers, regulators, and consumers about the real motivations behind the \u201ccryptocasino.\u201d\n\nThere are numerous developers and entrepreneurs who are dedicated to building innovative applications and services. Their efforts, combined with continued education, collaboration, and innovation, give me confidence that BSV will ultimately gain widespread acceptance and adoption as a transformative technology. This is a goal that I am dedicated to making progress on every day.\n\nHas the recent situation with multiple bank failures/bailouts increased the urgency for a more transparent, accountable system?\n\nI think the recent failure of Silicon Valley Bank has caused some significant concern, not only for digital currencies but for the financial industry as a whole. It has highlighted the need for a more transparent and accountable system. BSV has the potential to provide the infrastructure to empower better security, transparency, and accountability. Although I have not had any direct conversations on this specific use case, I anticipate that it will become a topic of discussion in the future.\n\nWatch: SmartLedger team on CoinGeek Weekly Livestream with Kurt Wuckert Jr.\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "content": "It is often said that out of great crises come great innovations. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Bitcoin (BTC) emerged as a decentralized digital currency that promised to revolutionize the financial industry. Fast forward to 2023, and experts predict that another economic collapse is on the horizon.\n\nThis time, however, the world may turn to a different type of innovation: RenQ Finance (RENQ). RenQ Finance is a blockchain platform that aims to provide a more efficient and transparent way of conducting transactions. With its low transaction fees, fast transaction times, and community governance structure, RenQ Finance could become a go-to solution for a world in need of financial stability and trust.\n\n2008 Bank Collapse and the Rise of Bitcoin\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis was a turning point in the history of modern finance. The collapse of the banking industry and the ensuing economic downturn led to a worldwide recession that left many people financially vulnerable. However, out of this crisis emerged a new form of currency \u2013 Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 by an unknown individual or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It was designed to be a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency that could operate without the need for intermediaries such as banks or governments. Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain technology, which records all transactions on a distributed public ledger, made it resistant to manipulation and fraud.\n\nOver the years, Bitcoin has grown in popularity, with more people and businesses accepting it as a legitimate form of payment. Its market capitalization has also soared, reaching an all-time high of over $1.28 trillion in November 2021. Bitcoin has become a symbol of financial freedom and independence, as well as a hedge against inflation and economic instability.\n\n2023 Bank Collapse and the Emergence of RenQ Finance\n\nWhile Bitcoin was born out of the 2008 financial crisis, many experts believe that the next financial collapse will give rise to a new cryptocurrency \u2013 RenQ Finance (RENQ). RenQ Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that operates on the Ethereum blockchain, offering users high-yield rewards through staking and liquidity mining.\n\nRenQ Finance\u2019s unique combination of features has gained significant attention in the crypto space, with users attracted to its potential for high yields and profitability. Additionally, RENQ\u2019s price has been performing well, increasing from around $0.02 in January 2023 to $0.03 at the time of writing.\n\nThe idea behind RenQ Finance is to create a decentralized platform that allows users to yield farm, liquidity mine, and stake their assets without the need for intermediaries such as banks. RenQ Finance\u2019s native token, RENQ, is used to pay transaction fees and governance on the platform.\n\nRenQ Finance is designed to be AI-friendly, meaning that it can be used by developers and companies to build and deploy AI applications. The platform\u2019s infrastructure is scalable, making it suitable for large-scale AI projects, and its fast and low-cost transactions provide an ideal environment for AI development.\n\nSummary\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis sparked the emergence of Bitcoin, a decentralized digital currency that has become synonymous with financial freedom and autonomy. While some experts anticipate the next financial crisis will usher in a new cryptocurrency, others believe it\u2019s already here in the form of RenQ Finance (RENQ).\n\nBuilt on the Ethereum Chain, RenQ Finance is a decentralized finance platform that offers users high-yield rewards via staking and liquidity mining. With its AI-friendly infrastructure, it has the potential for AI development and presents a promising investment opportunity for those seeking high yields and profitability.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that cryptocurrency investment is a high-risk, high-reward endeavor, and investors should conduct their own research and due diligence before making any investment decisions.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nWebsite: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) suffered one of its worst declines during the last bear rally, with many holders counting losses. Existing altcoins like Quant (QNT) weren\u2019t spared either, but crypto investors are now focused on making up for the bad times. The two crypto assets could reward holders\u2019 patience and trust with a steady upward rally that could amount to tangible profit yield.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) is another altcoin billed for an impressive run, as the new meme coin prepares to launch on UniSwap (UNI) and other major exchanges. With the market showing signs of improved profitability, the coming months may be great for holders of these crypto assets.\n\nQuant (QNT): An Highly Efficient Enterprise Grade Blockchain\n\nQuant is a top enterprise-grade network business leverage to improve efficiency by allowing them to harness the benefits of blockchain technology to the fullest. The blockchain network proffers practical solutions to common problems facing enterprises in different sectors, especially the finance and asset management niche.\n\nThe highly interoperable protocol leverages DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) to achieve its functionalities. It helps businesses reduce risk exposure levels and operations costs while ensuring increased interoperability. Quant\u2019s functions, especially in the business sector, have made it popular amongst many enterprises, especially Fintechs.\n\nThe blockchain network is constantly upgraded to remain relevant and highly functional for users. This increases its tendency of meeting up with any new demands users could possibly have. The protocol\u2019s base currency, Quant (QNT), is used for payment on the platform. This includes any necessary network fees either for licenses or other transactions.\n\nThe altcoin currently sells below a dollar but looks likely to move beyond that price point as the year proceeds. Quant (QNT) could recover from its about 50% price dump, to set an impressive year high soon.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Recovery is Imminent\n\nDespite the changing market dynamics, constant upgrades of other crypto projects, and new innovations, Bitcoin remains the apex crypto project. It\u2019s no doubt that the cryptocurrency has stood the test of time, and it\u2019s unlikely for any altcoin to topple it anytime soon. Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) quick recovery is a strong feature that sets it apart from most altcoins, and the digital currency looks set for another recovery after the crypto winter setback.\n\nCurrently, holders can expect gradual loss recovery, while potential new adopters are likely to enjoy great yield. Bitcoin\u2019s pump or dump is usually associated with the general market condition. Thus, investors can expect impressive returns from almost all altcoins if Bitcoin (BTC) eventually embarks on its anticipated impressive rally.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) Set for Possible Post-launch Surge\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) has been an impressive cat-theme meme token, and many expect it to replicate its impressive run upon launching into the market. The Ethereum-based meme coin boasts a self-sustaining ecosystem and strong community that can contribute to its success possibility.\n\nThe Big Eyes ecosystem contains a decentralized exchange (DEX) for token swaps, educational resources about DeFi to aid learning, and income-generating opportunities to propagate wealth in the community. Big Eyes will have NFTs collections and that comes with exclusive benefits for holders. Each NFT in the collection is billed to be an asset of worth and could yield value for holders in the future.\n\nThe meme project will allocate 5% of its treasury to charities involved in ocean protection. This will help protect a part of the Earth\u2019s ecosystem. Token holders will be at the forefront of deciding which charity gets donations periodically, giving Big Eyes token (BIG) governance functions too.\n\nWith over $30 million raised on presale, it\u2019s evident that Big Eyes Coin (BIG) has gained huge acceptance. Its adoption and prominence could translate to market success in the coming months, as analysts are optimistic about its market potential.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "According to a criminal record report published by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, cryptocurrency investment scams increased from 907 million dollars in 2021 to 2.5 billion dollars in 2022, which is a 183% rise. The FBI also stated that the crypto investment scams saw an unprecedented rise in the number of victims in 2022, and Most of the victims assumed huge debt to cover losses from these fraudulent investments. As per the FBI report, the crypto fraudsters targeted people ages 30-49. The FBI noted in its report that the scams were socially engineered and trust-enabled. Most of the scams began with romance or confidence and later evolved into cryptocurrency investment fraud, the report mentioned.\n\nThe crypto community is being introduced to various new cybercrimes every day. This emphasizes the importance of having a safe vault to protect crypto investments. Lockyourcrypto.com is one such digital fortress that provides crypto investors with a highly-secured place to keep their valuable digital assets away from cybercriminals.\n\nBitcoin And Ethereum Rise\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are the two major icons of the crypto world. Even People who do not know about cryptocurrencies and their values are aware of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The influence of these currencies reaches beyond the virtual world and affects the ordinary man in our real world.\n\nThough both coins are regarded as the most credible and valuable digital assets in the market, they suffered a week-long downtrend in the market in March. Between March 9-14, the price of BTC fell below $20K and rose to $26K. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at around $24,800.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, also stumbled in the market in the past week. ETH price slumped below $1,300 and rose to $1,700 over the past 7 days. It was trading at around $1,600, at the time of writing.\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained 15% and 8.52% respectively over the past seven days.\n\nThis volatile nature of the crypto market can make a weak-handed person panic sell their stocks which could result in loss or reduced profit. Lockyourcrypto.com has a perfect feature for these weak-handed investors to control their paper hand and increase their chance to earn more.\n\nLockyourcrypto.com \u2013 A Digital Fortress\n\nThe crypto industry has two types of wallets called non-custodial wallets and custodial wallets. With non-custodial or self-custodial wallets, the investors will have control of their private keys and cryptocurrency holdings. They will be responsible for maintaining security measures to protect their crypto funds.\n\nNon-custodial wallet users will need a backup mechanism to use if they forget the private keys. They can employ Cold wallets or hardware wallets, which are in physical form and can store the private keys offline. Since these physical wallets can be stolen and broken, they are also not safe.\n\nBut with custodial wallets, a third party like Lockyourcrypto.com will be in control of your private keys. Many investors prefer custodial wallets as they don\u2019t wish to risk forgetting their private keys and losing their entire investments.\n\nLockyourcrypto.com protects your private keys in multilayer security. It uses a password pin or fingerprint authentication to eliminate unauthorized access to the vault.\n\nThe users will need to log in to the Lockyourcrypto.com platform to transfer their digital assets to the vault. After transferring the funds, the users can choose the time frame for the funds to be locked up. This lock-up feature would help weak-handed investors to control their paper hands during market volatility. The added advantage of the lock-up time frame is that depositors can not withdraw or transfer this fund during this period except in case of an emergency.\n\nLockyourcrypto.com platform uses high-level encryption to protect funds from cyber attacks. It also ensures the privacy of the depositors.\n\nAlong with all these safety measures, investors should be aware of various forms of cyberattacks in the crypto industry to avoid falling prey to such scams in the future.\n\nCheck it out at the links below:\n\nWebsite: www.Lockyourcrypto.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Lockyourcrypto\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has achieved a significant milestone in its history by running non-stop for a decade without any downtime, paving the way for a new era of decentralized finance.\n\nIn particular, data retrieved from BitcoinUptime, shared by Reddit user Tasigur1 on March 17, indicates that Bitcoin has run continuously, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for the last 10 years with no issues at all. The period translates to 3,650 days of operating without disruption.\n\n\n\nBitcoin\u2019s historical uptime as retrieved on March 17. Source: BitcoinUptime\n\nSince the cryptocurrency\u2019s inception in 2009, the network has suffered two major downtimes. One notable incident occurred in 2010 when a block contained a transaction that created an astronomical number of Bitcoins due to an overflow in the code. However, the community quickly discovered and fixed the issue, ensuring the integrity of the Bitcoin network. Interestingly, Bitcoin\u2019s uptime stood at 99.908% in 2010.\n\nAnother issue arose in 2013 when a block with more transaction inputs than previously seen was mined and broadcasted, causing a fork in the blockchain.\n\nSimilarly, the community quickly detected and resolved the issue, preventing any significant damage to the network. The incident resulted in a Bitcoin uptime of 99.932% for 2013.\n\nImplication of Bitcoin\u2019s 10 year uptime\n\nThe fact that Bitcoin has been running without downtime for ten years is a testament to the resilience and reliability of its underlying blockchain technology. Notably, the decentralized nature makes it extremely difficult for anyone to take down the network or compromise its security.\n\nThe uptime status further validates Bitcoin\u2019s founding ideologies of solving the traditional finance sector\u2019s shortcomings. The 24/7 availability means that it is always accessible to users, regardless of their location. This has made it an attractive option for people who want to make transactions outside of regular banking hours or live in countries where traditional banking services are not readily available.\n\nAdditionally, the milestone coincides with a period in which the United States banking sector is facing a crisis following the high profile collapse of three lenders within days.\n\nRenewed interest in Bitcoin\n\nIndeed, Bitcoin\u2019s ten-year milestone comes when the cryptocurrency is experiencing renewed interest from investors and traders.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has been steadily climbing in recent days, reaching new multi-month highs. By press time, the maiden cryptocurrency was trading at $26,877 with 24-hour gains of over 7%. On the weekly chart, BTC is up 35%.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nThe digital currency has generally ignored the banking sector contagion, leading the crypto market in recovery, as highlighted by the sector\u2019s $200 billion inflow in a week.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
