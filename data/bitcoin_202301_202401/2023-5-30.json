        "title": "At bitcoin convention, few feel chill of crypto winter - Marketplace",
        "content": "What organizers call the world\u2019s largest bitcoin convention took place in Miami Beach this month.\n\nFor $999 \u2014 in traditional U.S. currency \u2014 you could spend a couple of days with 12,000 fellow bitcoin enthusiasts doing all manner of bitcoin things: perusing the bitcoin art gallery, testing the latest and greatest bitcoin mining rigs and attending panels with topics ranging from \u201cDecentralizing Yourself\u201d to \u201cFighting the Anti-Crypto Army.\u201d\n\nThat 12,000 figure is less than half of last year\u2019s attendance, which probably has something to do with bitcoin\u2019s value dropping about 60% from its all-time high in 2021.\n\nBitcoin 2023 was mostly a normal business convention. Picture companies in a giant expo hall hawking their wares, small battalions of attractive young salespeople in brightly logoed T-shirts trying to lure passersby with the siren song of conference swag.\n\nBut there were eccentricities \u2014 like bitcoin-themed bathroom products.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking everyone at the conference here if their butt\u2019s clean, because we\u2019re selling butt wipes,\u201d Peter Baraniecki said while manning a table at the convention\u2019s Bitcoin Bazaar, a mini-flea market for bitcoin merchandise.\n\nNext to his bitcoin-themed wipes was a toilet with stickers of non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies like dogecoin adorning the inside of the bowl. Bitcoiners refer to pretty much all other cryptocurrencies as \u201cs-coins.\u201d You can tell from the not-so-subtle toilet context what the \u201cs\u201d stands for.\n\nA toilet for \u201cs-coins\u201d at Bitcoin 2023. (Matt Levin/Marketplace)\n\nSo-called bitcoin maximalists, or bitcoin maxis for short, believe bitcoin is the only digital currency that can and will replace traditional money.\n\nAlthough judging by Baraniecki\u2019s sales, that might take a while.\n\n\u201cWe had about 20 sales so far since this morning,\u201d Baraniecki said. \u201cI would say maybe three or four used bitcoin. The rest were either cash or credit.\u201d\n\nBaraniecki himself said he doesn\u2019t own bitcoin, which was the case for a surprising number of people I talked to at the event. Tali Lindberg has a name for them.\n\n\u201cPrecoiners,\u201d Lindberg said. \u201cPeople who maybe have heard of bitcoin, but they\u2019re on the fence. They don\u2019t know what it is exactly. They don\u2019t trust it yet, they don\u2019t understand it.\u201d\n\nLindberg used to be a precoiner herself. She\u2019s a stay-at-home mom who home-schooled four kids in Kentucky.\n\nHer bitcoin-loving husband developed a board game so she could better understand it. They sold a deluxe edition at the Bitcoin Bazaar for $84.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called HODL Up,\u201d Lindberg said. \u201cThe goal is for each player to HODL as many bitcoin tokens as possible.\u201d\n\nHODL is a bitcoiner credo, basically shorthand for \u201chold on for dear life.\u201d More practically, it means never sell \u2014 which is what Lindberg did as bitcoin\u2019s price fell from its approximately $68,000 peak to its current $27,000.\n\n\u201cAll I can say is every dollar we have to spare we put it into bitcoin,\u201d Lindberg said. \u201cSome people are like, \u2018You shouldn\u2019t put all your eggs into one basket.\u2019 This is the only basket I believe in.\u201d\n\nMany bitcoin maxis actually cheered the downfall of FTX and its boss, Sam Bankman Fried. They detest the idea of a centralized exchange \u2014 or centralized anything.\n\nAnd they\u2019re used to riding the wild swings of the bitcoin market.\n\nBitcoiners could ride a mechanical bull at Bitcoin 2023. (Matt Levin/Marketplace)\n\nBen Bryla climbed on to a mechanical bull in the center of the expo hall. He rode it for a minute and half before finally falling off. That tied his time from last year, which was almost enough to win the competition.\n\n\u201cLast year, first place was an entire bitcoin, which at the time was 40 grand. This year they\u2019ve changed it up, and it\u2019s a whale pass for next year,\u201d Bryla said.\n\nA \u201cwhale pass\u201d is basically a VIP ticket for bitcoin high rollers.\n\nBryla said he takes home 10% of his salary from a global human resources company in bitcoin. Given the news about the traditional financial system lately, he\u2019s not selling.\n\n\u201cEach one of these bank collapses, while the Federal Reserve sits there and tells you that the banking system is fine and there\u2019s nothing to worry about, it\u2019s an advertisement for an egalitarian system like bitcoin,\u201d Bryla said.\n\nAt times, Bitcoin 2023 felt a bit like a libertarian comic-con.\n\nThere\u2019s a reverse Plinko-style game in which you try to navigate a coin away from banks and the Fed. One of the biggest applause lines from keynote speaker Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was a knock against COVID lockdowns.\n\nAnd while the bitcoiners were, for the most part, very friendly and welcoming, tens of thousands of them invading your city can be a little annoying to some locals.\n\nOn Friday night at a bar in South Beach, a group of crypto conventioneers joined a karaoke chorus belting out Neil Diamond. Iliana Cordero can spot them pretty easily.\n\n\u201cWhite socks and sneakers,\u201d Cordero said. \u201cSome kind of dumb hat. They don\u2019t have a Miami vibe, like \u2018Look at this.\u2019 They look like they\u2019re on a Carnival Cruise line.\u201d\n\nCordero is a chef and a Miami local. She said her restaurant did business with the bitcoin convention last year.\n\nAnd although she said she never takes payment in bitcoin, she does own some.\n\n\u201cIt just kind of sits there and it\u2019ll do what it does,\u201d Cordero said. \u201cI don\u2019t need that money. So it\u2019s there to grow or to dissipate. We\u2019ll find out.\u201d"

This will make it more difficult for someone to view your private key at a glance. Step 5: Send crypto to your paper wallet. After sending your crypto, keep the wallet in a secure location, away from potentially damaging elements like moisture and heat. Since crypto is virtual, you can send crypto to any wallet, whether paper, digital or physical, as long as you have an address to use.\n\nWhat You Need to Open a Cryptocurrency Account\n\nOpening a cryptocurrency account is quick if you have the necessary details. A few wallets even allow you to open multiple user accounts on the same wallet. Remember, you'll need to provide the necessary KYC details; these details help exchanges and wallets keep money laundering and other financial crimes in check.\n\nResearch the Cryptocurrency Account\n\nRunning background checks before you sign up with an exchange/wallet is crucial. These checks save you a lot of headaches and prevent you from falling into the hands of scammers posing as legitimate business owners. The first place to look is the company's website. There are several questions to ask, including:\n\nDoes the website look suspicious?\n\nDoes the URL correspond with the company's name?\n\nWho runs the exchange?\n\nAlthough many things are anonymous in the crypto space, owners of wallets/companies rarely are. If you\u2019re satisfied with the company\u2019s website authenticity, head to social media to check out its official social media handles. Also, pay attention to any red flags and listen to what other people are saying about the company. Do a lot of people say it\u2019s inefficient?\n\nSign Up\n\nTo use a cryptocurrency wallet/exchange for the first time, you need to sign up with some details and documents to give the exchange some background information on you. Here is the information most exchanges require:\n\nName\n\nDate of birth\n\nEmail address\n\nPhone number\n\nHome address\n\nSocial Security number\n\nDriver\u2019s license or passport\n\nUnderstand the Basics\n\nSince cryptocurrency is money, it needs to be kept safe: away from hackers, scammers, and other bad actors. If these people get ahold of your crypto, they can send it to another wallet or sell it for money, leaving you with nothing. In choosing a crypto wallet storage option, consider one with a security system that makes it difficult for anyone to hack your wallet and steal your assets.\n\nThere are different types of secure wallet options you can go with, including crypto exchanges, cold storage wallets, paper wallets, and hot crypto wallets. If you want to access your crypto more quickly, choose either a crypto exchange or hot crypto wallet. If you\u2019d like to focus more on security and storing cryptocurrency offline, cold storage or paper wallets are ideal options.\n\nCryptocurrency Exchange\n\nA crypto exchange is an application that lets you access crypto and carry out crypto-related transactions. Most wallets are free to download but involve a transaction fee for sending or selling cryptocurrency. Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken are all popular examples of cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nCold Storage Wallet\n\nA cold storage wallet is a type of wallet not connected to the internet. With these types of wallets, your crypto is safe from hackers, so these are ideal for storing large amounts of cryptocurrency. Many users go for Trezor and Ledger.\n\nHot Crypto Wallet\n\nUnlike a cold wallet, a hot crypto wallet is connected to the internet. That means you need an internet connection to access your crypto. Although these wallets are more susceptible to hacks, they make accessing your crypto frequently for transactions easier. Numerous hot crypto wallets are available on the market today, but Guarda and Mycelium are good picks based on security.\n\nPaper Wallets\n\nAlthough paper wallets are now phasing out, they\u2018re still practical for storing cryptocurrencies. A typical paper wallet contains your private keys and your address printed on it. Paper wallets are relatively safe, but if the paper gets stolen or goes missing, the thief could easily read your keys and take your crypto, or you lose your crypto forever.\n\nKnow the Risks\n\nNo cryptocurrency storage method is 100% safe, even with the various security measures.\n\nRisks of Storing Cryptocurrency in an Exchange\n\nStoring your crypto on an exchange is often regarded as the easiest way to keep it, but you can also quickly lose it to hackers. If your exchange gets attacked, you could permanently lose your crypto, even though your passwords and private keys are safe.\n\nRisks of a Cold Storage Wallet\n\nTypically, cold storage is the safest way to store your crypto away from online hacks and security breaches. But you can also lose your crypto, especially if you lose your device or it gets stolen. Furthermore, water or fire damage can permanently cause your crypto to go down the drain, especially if you did not back up your seed phrase.\n\nRisks of a Hot Crypto Wallet\n\nHot crypto wallets pose almost the same risk as storing crypto on exchanges. However, they\u2019re relatively safer. If your device gets hacked or you accidentally install malware, your wallet could be completely drained.\n\nRisks of a Paper Wallet\n\nYour paper wallet is highly vulnerable to physical damage or wear and tear. These wallets are pretty inexpensive, but they\u2018re easy prey for attackers. The attacker only needs to get a hold of the paper to rob you. So, even if you have copies of the paper wallet, it doesn't help much since your private keys are on any copy you print out or keep in your device\u2019s storage as a soft copy.\n\nFactors to Consider When Opening a Cryptocurrency Account\n\nSecurity: Review an exchange\u2019s security features before setting up an account. We recommend you go with one that offers two-factor authentication or an additional security measure to the usual password feature.\n\nFees: Many exchanges charge a small fee for sending, selling, or buying cryptocurrencies. If you would like to trade cryptocurrency often, your best bet is to go with an exchange with moderately low fees to save you the extra money spent on charges.\n\nNumber and quality of supported cryptocurrencies for options trading: If your goal is to trade a variety of crypto assets, you will need to choose an exchange that offers more than just BTC and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nStorage and custody: Using a custodial storage option like a hot crypto wallet is better if you're not too good with keeping passwords and passphrases. These options keep your crypto for you and can help you recover your password if you forget it.\n\nCustomer service: Although many exchanges have a customer care center or an email to reach them in case of issues, it\u2019s preferable to go for one with a live chat option. Those have faster reply times and can be convenient for wallet-related emergencies.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow Do You Store Large Amounts of Cryptocurrency? You can store large amounts of cryptocurrencies by any storage method, but storing them in cold wallets is best. Cold wallets are the most secure option and can store any amount of cryptocurrencies for a long time.\n\nCan You Store Cryptocurrency Offline? You can store cryptocurrency online as well as offline. Offline storage options include cold storage wallets and paper wallets. These days, people rarely use paper wallets. You should get a solid, secure cold wallet to keep your crypto offline.\n\nAre Cryptocurrency Exchanges Safe? Cryptocurrency exchanges are not entirely safe. An exchange can easily be hacked, and your wallet might be part of the unfortunate ones affected. You should store crypto on exchanges mostly if you make a lot of crypto transactions or trade crypto.\n\nCan You Store Multiple Cryptocurrencies in One Wallet? Yes, you can store multiple cryptocurrencies in one wallet. Many cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges automatically create separate wallets for as many cryptocurrencies as they support. In a few cases, you\u2019ll have to manually add a new wallet for the new crypto you want to store. The best wallet to store all cryptocurrency would be a cold, portable and secure one."

        "content": "This week, the Swiss National Bank held its Cryptoassets and Financial Innovation conference. A thought-provoking keynote explored whether fiat money could be challenged. If so, could it be usurped by gold, Bitcoin, some inflation-linked token or something else?\n\nThe talk was presented by economist Lawrence H. White, a Senior Fellow at George Mason University and a senior scholar at the Cato Institute. During the speech, he revealed he\u2019d crossed paths with Hal Finney and Nick Szabo, who some believe are Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin.\n\nCentral banks lack competition\n\nWith rampant inflation in the 70s, economists devised various proposals to address the issue. One was to impose constraints on central bank policymakers. Hayek observed the problem was a need for more competition. Initially, he suggested opening up economies to foreign fiat currencies, effectively creating competition between central banks. Later he proposed introducing private currencies, which probably would be designed to maintain purchasing power.\n\nToday the major private currency contenders would be gold or Bitcoin. White observed that the way to retain purchasing power is to either commit to repurchase the currency at a fixed price or limit the supply, as is the case in Bitcoin.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and gold are both inflation hedges, the supply mechanisms are very different. In the case of gold, if there is increased demand, higher prices will lead to more production or recycling of gold jewelry. That increases supply, which in turn moderates price over the long term. This was demonstrated with the gold standard. When the U.S. rejoined it in 1879 and departed in 1914, the price was 1% different.\n\nIn contrast, Bitcoin\u2019s supply increases in a predefined way and does not respond to demand. Price inflation might engender more mining activity, but that does not produce more Bitcoins. \u201cIt\u2019s not unfair to say that purchasing power volatility is built into the design,\u201d said White. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a problem if you want it to be a commonly accepted medium of exchange.\u201d\n\nCould fiat currencies be usurped?\n\nHowever, White sees a shift away from fiat currencies as unlikely, largely because of the network effect benefits of incumbents. The one caveat is runaway inflation, combined with a lack of an alternative fiat currency that is viewed as more stable. He gave examples of Argentinian and Zimbabwean citizens who spontaneously adopted the U.S. dollar.\n\n\u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to put themselves on a gold standard or a Bitcoin standard unless there\u2019s no good alternative,\u201d said White. \u201cUnless the dollar is just as unstable.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s advantage over gold is its censorship resistance. However, White believes it could be driven underground, as has happened in China. While that might not eliminate its usage, it prevents it from becoming a mainstream means of payment. Additionally, gold has a wider installed base (bullion, ETFs, jewelry) and its market capitalization is far higher. Hence, in the unlikely event that fiat currency fails, White would back gold over Bitcoin.\n\nHe highlighted some other blockchain alternatives. They include a so-called flatcoin linked to a price index, such as Ampleforth\u2019s SPOT token, which has a market capitalization of less than $ 1 million. Another alternative is to have a cryptocurrency with an elastic supply, such as PraSaga (which White advises.) Prasaga isn\u2019t trying to compete with Bitcoin, instead it focuses on industrial use cases.\n\nWhite\u2019s talk is well worth watching, along with other conference material."

Ether added about the same amount to trade at $1,908.17.\n\nOn Monday, bitcoin rose as high as $28,461.45, while ether reached a high of $1,928.16.\n\nThe cryptocurrencies began climbing Saturday evening after House Republicans reached a tentative deal with the White House to raise the nation's debt ceiling and avoid a default. Congress is set to vote on the legislation as early as Wednesday.\n\n\"The past few days have shown strong volatility as BTC dropped to the lowest trading price of about $25,800 Wednesday due to investors' fear concerning [the] U.S. reaching the debt ceiling,\" said Matteo Greco, research analyst at investment firm Fineqia International.\n\nBitcoin and ether roared higher the following day.\n\n\"However \u2026 This means that, in the mid-term, money is removed from more risky assets to buy government bonds. The consequence could be an additional slowdown in volumes and liquidity for the stock and digital asset markets, with a potential negative impact on prices,\" Greco added.\n\nAs the debt ceiling negotiations weighed on crypto investors last week, the minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting also showed central bank officials are divided on where to go with interest rate hikes.\n\nWith both of those factors, bitcoin has started behaving like a risk asset again. Its correlation with gold has retraced from this year's all-time highs\n\nBitcoin is now testing its March resistance level of about $28,800, said Yuya Hasegawa, a crypto market analyst at Japanese bitcoin exchange Bitbank.\n\nBitcoin and ether are on pace for their worst month since November, down 5% and up 0.1%, respectively. Bitcoin is on pace for its first negative month in 2023.\n\nFor the quarter, bitcoin is down almost 2%, after finishing the first quarter up 71%. Ether is up 4.3%, after it posted a 52% gain in Q1."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nThe days of Bill Clinton appearing on stage at cryptocurrency conferences and Matt Damon starring in crypto exchange ads are long gone. Speculative mania has given way to more sober reflection. In the US, the energy usage of miners is under fresh attack. The White House has suggested that mining companies pay tax equal to 30 per cent of the cost of electricity they use.\n\nDespite this, the price of bitcoin has climbed 67 per cent this year, exceeding $30,000 in April before falling back. Ethereum, the second- largest digital token, is following the same trajectory. It may be less than half its high point, but the pause on interest rate rises has lifted bitcoin\u2019s price. A technical event known as the halving could drive it higher still.\n\nThere will only ever be 21mn bitcoin in circulation. Every four years, rewards for mining bitcoin are chopped in half. Right now, miners receive 6.25 bitcoin for verifying a new block of transactions on the blockchain. Next year this will drop to 3.125. Eventually the reward will be cut to $0. The lead-up to previous halvings has coincided with bitcoin price rises.\n\nIt is possible, however, that dwindling enthusiasm for the crypto industry will damp the halving\u2019s impact. Venture capital funding for crypto and blockchain start-ups dropped 80 per cent in the first quarter of the year compared with the same period in 2022, according to data from PitchBook. Excitement around artificial intelligence that has lifted prices in semiconductor companies and other tech stocks has not extended to crypto companies. Regulator warnings have made banks more skittish about holding their assets after FTX\u2019s failure.\n\nBitcoin was created in the wake of the financial crisis as a decentralised alternative. But the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank this year did not trigger renewed conversion to bitcoin. Lack of transparency remains a problem. So does criminal activity. Price moves dictated by technical mechanisms that create scarcity show how far the digital asset is from ushering in a brand-new financial system."

        "content": "Since January, there have been over 10 million inscriptions on the largest blockchain in the world, and this number continues to grow exponentially.\n\nTo provide some context, the Ordinals Protocol allows for the ordered identification of satoshis, the smallest subdivision of a Bitcoin (BTC), enabling each of them to have an individual identity. From that people can inscribe sats with arbitrary content, creating Bitcoin-native digital artifacts, more commonly known as nonfungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nAmong the various narratives resulting from this technique, the existence of an extremely underground group of individuals who identify, track and trade high-value historical satoshis has come to light. They are known as \u201csat hunters.\u201d\n\nThere is no denying that the Bitcoin ecosystem is undergoing a period of tremendous innovation since the advent of the Ordinals Protocol in early 2023.\n\nTheir main activity involves transacting millions of BTC in search of satoshis that were present in historical moments of the crypto world.\n\nThis practice is known as \u201csat hunting\u201d and can be compared to continuously withdrawing money from a bank in search of rare coins: You withdraw $10,000, keep $1 of rare coins, deposit the remaining $9,999, and repeat the process of withdrawing another $10,000 in a continuous cycle.\n\nRelated: Users will decide if they can still trust Ledger with their seed phrases\n\nThe group that holds the largest amount of rare satoshis is the Rare Satoshi Society, which has already traded more than $1 billion in Bitcoin volume in pursuit of these historical sats.\n\nThey are becoming well-known for providing rare satoshis for the majority of Ordinals experiments and even sold a single satoshi for 0.5 BTC.\n\nAnd it\u2019s fascinating to observe how some Ordinals projects are adopting this narrative. One example is the Nakamoto Whales project, which minted a portion of its collection into rare satoshis from the first thousand mined blocks, including one mined by Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nAlongside the deployment of NFTs in rare satoshis, there is also an emerging trend of historically inscribed fungible tokens (BRC-20). DAnTer, a member of the Rare Satoshi Society, recently inscribed a collection, FHAL, onto a satoshi that was mined by the legendary Hal Finney on block 78 with the purpose of democratizing access to such a historical asset for more individuals.\n\nNow, according to DAnTer, we have entered an era where one Bitcoin is no longer equal to one Bitcoin \u2014 and a satoshi becomes equal to infinity.\n\nRelated: Pepe would be ashamed of PEPE investors\n\nAnd although the narrative of historical satoshis still remains underground, fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network are hotter than ever. OKX, one of the largest exchanges in the world, just announced the listing of ORDI, the largest BRC-20 token in terms of market capitalization, while OXBT, one of the most popular BRC-20 tokens, has surpassed Bored Ape Yacht Club in the seven-day volume chart \u2014 just after its launch.\n\nIn February, people were trading Ordinals using Excel spreadsheets due to the lack of infrastructure. Today, just a few months later, major exchanges are joining this movement. Big brands like Bugatti have shown interest in the rare sats narrative, and there is even discussion about smart contracts on the Bitcoin network.\n\nCould this be the phase of the greatest innovation and onboarding in the history of Bitcoin?\n\nLugui Tillier is the chief commercial officer of Lumx Studios, a leading Web3 studio that counts BTG Pactual Bank, the largest investment bank in Latin America, among its investors. Lumx Studios has previous Web3 cases with Coca-Cola, AB InBev, Nestl\u00e9 and Meta.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Saifedean commented in his interview with Diario El Salvador that he thinks of it as \u201ca great initiative\u201d and that \u201cdeveloping competencies in Bitcoin programming will help position young people in the future.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nEl Salvador to Move Forward With Issuing Bitcoin Bonds: Finance Minister\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s National Bitcoin Office was created late last year by president Nayib Bukele in conjunction with known bitcoiners Stacy Herbert and Max Keiser. Through El Salvador's Decree n.49, it manages \u201call matters relating to cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nThe country has been a pioneer in its national cryptocurrency strategy, making Bitcoin legal tender in 2021, and launching their innovative Bitcoin bonds earlier last year.\n\nReports about Bitcoin\u2019s adoption in the small Central American country have been mixed, however, with tourism on the rise this year, despite previous signs it has been slow to take off."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether flat; XRP jumps; U.S. equity futures mixed - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin traded flat on Wednesday morning in Asia, after briefly breaching the US$28,000 level on Tuesday night. Ether dipped below the US$1,900 mark, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. XRP led the winners following crypto-related legal developments involving the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Stock futures in the U.S. traded mixed, as investors wait to see if the U.S. debt ceiling deal passes through Congress. The deal faces opposition from some House Republicans. Meanwhile, concerns over further U.S. interest rate hikes and debt issuance continue to limit investor appetite for risk assets.\n\nBitcoin, Ether flat; XRP surges\n\nBitcoin dipped 0.35% over the last 24 hours to US$27,666 at 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, but was trading 1.92% higher for the week, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s most dominant cryptocurrency reached a high of US$28,044 on Tuesday evening in Asia. However, it soon fell back down below the US$28,000 resistance level.\n\nDigital asset investment products saw outflows totalling US$39m in the week ending May 26, according to a Tuesday report from European cryptocurrency investment firm CoinShares. Bitcoin-linked products accounted for almost a third of those outflows. The six-week run of outflows totals US$272 million \u2014 an indication that bearish sentiment continues to weigh heavily on the crypto market.\n\nEther inched down 0.13% to US$1,895, but gained 2.66% over the past seven days. The token has been trading around the US$1,900 resistance level since the start of the week.\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded flat to lower in the past 24 hours, with the exception of XRP, Solana and Litecoin.\n\nXRP led the winners, jumping 6.15% in the past 24 hours to US$0.5209. That rise expanded its weekly gain to 12.75%.\n\nMarkus Thielen, Head of Crypto Research at digital asset service platform Matrixport, suggested in a note that the token\u2019s surge could be linked to the announcement of a settlement reached Monday between the SEC and a former manager at cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. The former Coinbase employee agreed to SEC charges that he had engaged in insider trading.\n\nThat resolution could, Thielen suggests, benefit Ripple \u2014 the issuer of XRP \u2014 in its own legal dispute with the SEC, leading to gains for XRP.\n\nElsewhere, Dogecoin led the losers. The memecoin dropped 1.03% to US$0.07242, dipping 0.06% for the week.\n\nThe total market cap of cryptocurrencies edged up 0.32% in the past 24 hours to US$1.16 trillion, while the 24-hour market volume inched 2.02% higher to US$30.06 billion.\n\nExcitement returns to NFT market\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.22% to 3,403.49 in the 24 hours to 10:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, but edged up 0.32% for the week.\n\nNFT sales on Ethereum rose 22.00% in the past 24 hours to US$18.23 million. That rise was spearheaded by Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) transactions, according to CryptoSlam data. Meanwhile, NFT sales on Bitcoin fell 18.77% to US$3.52 million.\n\nBAYC sales totaled US$2.86 million on Tuesday, almost three times higher than sales of the collection throughout Monday.\n\n\u201cThe rise in BAYC volume is interesting as some of the larger transactions price doesn\u2019t match the traits/rarity,\u201d said Eric Dettman, NFT advisor at CryptoSlam. \u201cThey aren\u2019t washes on paper but there may be some behind the scenes dealing going on.\u201d\n\nBRC-721E token standard was launched on Monday. The initiative allows traders to move their Ethereum-based NFTs to the Bitcoin network. That process is irreversible as it permanently burns the NFT on the Ethereum network before transfer.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019ll get to see traders\u2019 convictions on the Bitcoin ecosystem play out in real time,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs. \u201cAt this point, no one can deny that Bitcoin\u2019s NFTs are here to stay, but the question of \u2018Will Bitcoin NFTs flip Ethereum NFTs?\u2019 is another story. I think they will.\u201d\n\nNFT trader sentiment is also seeing a boost from Web3 developments in China and Russia.\n\nOn May 23, China\u2019s national broadcaster CCTV reported on Hong Kong\u2019s recent crypto regulation drive. That unexpected move preceded the release of a Web 3.0 white paper by the municipal government of Beijing. The wide-reaching paper covers sectors including NFTs and the metaverse.\n\n\u201cChina is coming into NFTs and crypto, and Russia will use crypto to settle payments across borders,\u201d said Petscher. \u201cThese two major announcements are bringing excitement back to the NFT and crypto markets and lead many to believe that these alone can turn the market around.\u201d\n\nU.S. futures dip before debt ceiling vote\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures fell as of 12:00 p.m. in Hong Kong, with Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipping 0.34%, S&P 500 futures down 0.25%, and the Nasdaq futures losing 0.15%.\n\nInvestors are jittery ahead of the U.S. Congress\u2019 vote on the debt ceiling deal to avoid a default in the world\u2019s biggest economy. The House vote is on Wednesday and could face objections, according to the Associated Press.\n\nAn additional concern for investors is interest rate policy at the Federal Reserve. Loretta Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told the Financial Times there was no \u201ccompelling reason to pause\u201d rate hikes in June, citing \u201cembedded, stubborn inflationary pressure,\u201d according to a report on Wednesday.\n\nThe Federal Reserve meets on June 14 to decide on rates, which are now between 5 and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 37.0% chance the Fed will keep rates unchanged in June, and a 63.0% chance for another 25 basis-point rate hike, up from 59.6% on Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. employment report will be released on Friday, giving another insight into the state of the economy and inflation pressure."

        "title": "Bitcoin is on a collision course with 'Net Zero' promises - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Each year at the annual UN Climate Change Conference (COP), individual countries are pressured to ramp up their emissions reductions promises and showcase evidence they are taking steps to meet them.\n\nWith Bitcoin mining blamed for using as much power as an entire country, and politicians searching for easy targets to strike, the industry appears to be on a collision course with these global commitments to achieve net-zero emissions.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not possible to ban Bitcoin completely, lawmakers and regulators can tank the price and make life very difficult in the years ahead for the number one cryptocurrency.\n\nThere are signs it\u2019s already happening.\n\n\n\nA report from the European Commission at the end of 2022 stated that EU countries \u201cmust be ready to block crypto mining,\u201d and the trading block\u2019s new MiCA rules were at one stage set to include a ban on Bitcoin mining. The recently adopted legislation still leaves this door ajar, however, aiming to \u201creduce the high carbon footprint of crypto-currencies\u201d by making service providers \u201cdisclose their energy consumption.\u201d\n\nAcross the pond, the Biden administration has proposed a 30% excise tax on the power consumption of U.S. cryptocurrency mining operations. The tax would be imposed regardless of whether the power is renewable, with the administration arguing Bitcoin mining\u2019s power consumption of renewable energy will slow down the transition to Net Zero. That\u2019s in contrast to a New York moratorium on Bitcoin mining in 2022 that exempted firms powered by renewable energy.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. government appears to be taking to heart the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy\u2019s September 2022 report that claimed the environmental impact of producing cryptocurrencies could \u201cimpede U.S. efforts to combat climate change.\u201d\n\n\n\nFormer member of the Bitcoin Mining Council and independent researcher Hass McCook doesn\u2019t mince his words about threats to ban mining.\n\n\u201cGovernments should focus on greening their grids, which miners rely upon, as opposed to trying to ban an unbannable technology.\u201d\n\nThe Swedish government was behind last year\u2019s push to outlaw crypto mining in the EU and, last month, took steps to price Bitcoin miners out of the market by abolishing various tax incentives. Starting in July, Sweden will increase the electricity tax by 6,000% from 0.006 Swedish kronas ($0.0006) to an extraordinary 0.36 kronas ($0.035) per kilowatt-hour (kWh).\n\n\n\n\u201cGovernments around the world are actively looking at Bitcoin mining\u2019s energy consumption,\u201d explains Brad van Voorhees, co-founder and CEO of Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol, which incentivizes the use of renewables for mining.\n\nArtist Benjamin Von Wong created \u201cThe Skull of Satoshi\u201d sculpture. He says he\u2019s not anti-Bitcoin, he just wants to lower emissions. (VanWong)\n\n\u201cSweden has already imposed a 6,000% tax on energy for BTC mining, and the Biden administration has proposed a 30% tax, which would undoubtedly mean miners move offshore,\u201d he adds.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe tax will likely never pass in the U.S., but nonetheless, the sector should focus on clean energy use and data transparency to mitigate this risk.\u201d\n\n\n\nOthers agree with van Voorhees that Net Zero is an opportunity to set Bitcoin mining on a new and more sustainable path. Morten R\u00f8ngaard is a member of the Nordic Blockchain Association and CEO of Reality+, a Web3 and blockchain company.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe collision between Bitcoin and Net-Zero commitments is a call to action. It\u2019s an opportunity to harness the power of innovation and renewable energy, steering both towards a greener and more inclusive landscape,\u201d he says.\n\nGood cop, bad cop\n\nThe focus on Bitcoin mining power usage was given additional impetus after Ethereum moved to proof-of-stake last year and saved 99.95% of its energy consumption as a result. While Bitcoiners believe PoS stands for \u201cpiece of shit,\u201d the success of the blockchain\u2019s energy transformation has made Bitcoin look like it is stuck in a corner using anachronistic tech.\n\nThere are now groups demanding changes to Bitcoin\u2019s underlying protocol as well.\n\nThe Change the Code lobby group is using the Merge to lobby for changes to Bitcoin. (Change The Code)\n\nGreenpeace\u2019s Change the Code Not the Climate (Clean Up Bitcoin) lobby group is pushing to change Bitcoin\u2019s consensus mechanism from proof-of-work, to proof-of-stake.\n\n\u201cWe know a basic software code change would reduce Bitcoin\u2019s energy use by 99.9%. If only 30 people \u2014 the key miners, exchanges, and core developers who build and contribute to Bitcoin\u2019s code \u2014 agreed to reinvent proof-of-work mining or move to a low-energy protocol, Bitcoin would stop polluting the planet. So why isn\u2019t Bitcoin changing its code?\u201d\n\nThis is misinformation, however, given the Bitcoin community needs to agree on a change, rather than a small group of just 30 people. The Bitcoin community split over the much smaller change of increasing the block size in 2017, leading to the Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV forks, so the chances of an agreement to change the fundamental nature of the technology are hard to envisage at this point.\n\nThe industry\u2019s big hope to date has been that progressively moving away from fossil fuels to rely more on sustainable and renewable power, such as wind, solar and hydroelectric power, will placate governments.\n\n\n\nBut as the Swedish and U.S. governments have said, that may not be enough. For governments and regulators trying to comply with their international climate change commitments, there will be a bunch of hard decisions to be made. Even a mining industry 100% powered by renewable energy could be a target, as that emissions-free energy could be freed up at the stroke of a pen to help a more politically valuable industry, like manufacturing, meet emissions targets.\n\nHow much power does Bitcoin use?\n\nIt\u2019s probably just water vapor. (Pexels)\n\nThe Cambridge Bitcoin electricity consumption site estimates Bitcoin network power demand and is updated every 24 hours and works with all major actors to cut down on carbon emissions. It conducts \u201cexperiments\u201d to evaluate Bitcoin\u2019s environmental footprint assuming the worst-case scenario.\n\n\n\nBy using the latest annual power consumption estimates of 143.63 TWh and, assuming that all this energy comes exclusively from coal, and is generated in an inefficient coal-fired power plant, the Bitcoin footprint would be 11 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. That\u2019s around 0.35% of the world\u2019s total annual emissions.\n\nBitcoiners point out that the network uses less power than the banking system (200 TWh) and a majority of the power used by the industry is renewable. They also claim mining can incentivize renewable electricity generation and make marginal green power projects viable.\n\nBut even taking these factors into account, mining still uses a ton of power, to which Bitcoiners argue that it\u2019s energy well-spent securing the hardest and best money known to humanity.\n\nBut non-Bitcoiners tend to look at the power use of the alternatives. The site estimates that Ethereum is using around 6.76 GWh per year. In other words, Bitcoin is using 21,000 times more power per year.\n\nAccording to the Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute, before its transition to proof-of-stake, a single Ethereum transaction used 200.05 kWh of electricity, on par with how much the average U.S. household uses in 6.7 days.\n\n\n\nAccording to Digiconomist, that consumption is now as low as 0.03 kWh, and the carbon footprint stands at 0.01 kgCO2, which is equivalent to the energy used when watching two hours of YouTube.\n\n\n\n(Please don\u2019t email us to point out that the network uses the same amount of power regardless of the number of transactions \u2014 we know, it\u2019s just illustrative).\n\n\n\nDigiconomist\u2019s Ethereum Energy Consumption Index highlights just how radically different PoW power consumption is to PoS.\n\nEthereum\u2019s energy consumption plummeted after it moved to proof-of-stake in 2022.\n\nU.K.-based Block Dojo describes itself as \u201cthe largest Bitcoin blockchain incubator in the world,\u201d but in fact, it\u2019s based on the Bitcoin fork Bitcoin SV. It claims to be responsible for 24% of all blockchain investments in the United Kingdom. Chairman James Marchant says the energy use of Bitcoin is an opportunity for other blockchains like Bitcoin SV.\n\n\u201cThe total energy use versus the number of transactions BTC can process per day is catastrophic. BTC does not implement the protocol as per the Satoshi white paper. We are seeing developers and entrepreneurs turning to a scalable blockchain solution away from BTC, and Net-Zero objectives is one of several key reasons for this,\u201d he says.\n\nMovement for change\n\nThe people driving the crypto industry forward are likely to be the younger demographic, Generation Z, which is increasingly sensitive to climate change concerns.\n\nBut the industry is not hiding its head in the sand, with bodies like the Bitcoin Mining Council attempting to address such concerns.\n\nWelcoming Bitcoin miners of all shapes and sizes \u2014 it accounts for about half the world\u2019s miners now \u2014 the Council is a voluntary forum that shares best practices and \u201ceducates the public on mining.\u201d\n\nThe Bitcoin Mining Council is led by Michael Saylor (BMC)\n\nIts most famous, and first, member is MicroStrategy boss Michael Saylor, who arranged the first meeting of the Council and is a strong adherent for managing miners\u2019 energy use and employing sustainable alternatives.\n\nIts latest quarterly report (based on self-reports from a survey and then estimated across the remainder of the industry) suggests miners are currently using a 58.9% sustainable energy mix.\n\nRenewable energy can potentially mitigate Bitcoin\u2019s environmental impact. There are many examples of mining facilities now powered by solar, wind or hydroelectric energy or using \u201cstranded\u201d energy or mining using flared gas that would otherwise be wasted. If the renewable energy lobby\u2019s claim that green power is the cheapest form of electricity, then miners will inevitably use more of it, explains McCook. \u201cBitcoin mining is a perfectly competitive industry. This means players will do anything to maximize profit. Anything. This means they chase the cheapest possible electricity available. This is increasingly becoming renewable,\u201d he says.\n\nDarren Franceschini, co-founder of Fideum Group \u2014 a London-based crypto funding company \u2014 agrees the industry is embracing wind and solar as much for economic reasons as anything else.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith fossil fuel prices soaring, miners are economically driven to achieve Net-Zero emissions,\u201d he says. Carbon pricing mechanisms and green energy subsidies could further promote the adoption of renewable energy sources within the mining sector.\n\nWill regulators believe Bitcoin can incentivize renewables?\n\nThere is a PlanB, however. (Pexels)\n\nBitcoin advocates like Nic Carter argue that mining can play a role in growing the sustainable energy sector by using excess electricity capacity for energy efficiency or helping to finance renewable projects.\n\n\u201cThe need for electricity in the creation of Bitcoin is obviously a concern. At the same time, it is one of the best-use cases for excess electricity capacity vital in the renewables sector,\u201d says Toby Lewis, co-founder of Ordinals Bot. \u201cWith the right incentives, Bitcoin can become a financing mechanism for the renewable grid.\u201d\n\nThe question is not whether or not this argument is correct \u2014 and it\u2019s a source of contention even in the crypto community \u2014 it\u2019s whether governments and regulators can be convinced it is.\n\nIt will be a hard sell to convince lawmakers, but Josef T\u011btek, a Bitcoin analyst at hardware wallet provider Trezor, argues that Bitcoin mining is a net positive for climate change.\n\n\u201cContrary to some claims, Bitcoin mining is beneficial for the environment and bootstraps renewable energy generation,\u201d he says, noting mining pops up wherever there\u2019s cheap renewable power.\n\n\u201cFor example, just recently, we have learned that the kingdom of Bhutan has been mining Bitcoin with its hydroelectric stations for years.\u201d\n\nIt will be interesting to see whether the result of a clampdown on mining by bigger countries will see mining nomads shift operations to crypto-friendly countries that provide sustainable power like Bhutan.\n\nThe small hermit kingdom in the Himalayas is watered by glaciers in the mountains. It has huge stores of hydroelectricity, providing 30% of the country\u2019s GDP and literally fuelling the homes of nearly all of its 800,000 residents. According to Forbes, the country is following the example of El Salvador by becoming one of two countries to run a state-owned mining operation.\n\nNick Jones, CEO of Zumo \u2014 a crypto-as-a-service platform \u2014 believes that crypto is well-placed to quickly reduce emissions.\n\n\u201cAll sectors need to rapidly decarbonize, and crypto has an opportunity to do this more quickly than most. Bitcoin\u2019s carbon footprint is due almost entirely to electricity consumption, and we have the technology to rapidly decarbonize. Significant progress has been made, but there is still much to do,\u201d he says.\n\nSurging demand for Bitcoin\n\nThe unexpected recent addition of NFTs and tokens to Bitcoin via Ordinals has created a huge wave of additional demand for the blockchain. Last month, the daily record for inscriptions using Bitcoin Ordinals was broken four times as users flooded the network with images, games and other content.\n\nDaniel Santos, co-founder of Gamepay, argues that Ordinals is the first successful protocol built on Bitcoin and will result in more adoption, which in turn will mean more mining and more power to be generated.\n\n\u201cGovernments will step in and regulate mining for sure, especially as Ordinals take hold. There will also be a drive for green energy, even if a lot of Bitcoin mining is done with green energy,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI suspect governments will require miners to have licenses to mine.\u201d\n\nOrdinals could be the proverbial straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back for Bitcoin and its energy consumption. Moreover, as the crypto winner begins to thaw, the demand for the currency is also expected to surge as the currency\u2019s price climbs.\n\nThis is an issue that will run for years to come. Prepare for demonstrations against Bitcoin and more proposals to ban either the protocol or mining.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is unbannable, there is a need to address emissions and to be on the front foot in the public debate. Whether change comes from within the industry or via external intervention is a question the crypto community needs to urgently address."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether dip; XRP rises; U.S. equity futures gain - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin fell in Tuesday morning trading in Asia, giving up a portion of Monday\u2019s gains on what looked like profit taking. Ether and most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also logged losses. XRP was the exception, rising on speculation the token is underpriced considering potentially positive developments in the lawsuit XRP developer Ripple Labs faces in the U.S. Stock futures in the U.S. moved higher after President Joe Biden and Republican House Speaker Kevin Mccarthy agreed to raise the government\u2019s debt ceiling over the weekend, averting a default. However, inflation and interest rate hikes might now come back into focus for investors.\n\nBitcoin dips, XRP gains\n\nBitcoin fell 1.45% over the last 24 hours to US$27,792 at 9:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, but was still trading 2.95% higher for the week, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency peaked at US$28,300 on Monday morning in Asia, the highest price since May 8.\n\n\u201cWith both parties in the US finding agreement to raise the debt ceiling, investors were allowed a dose of optimism,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of APAC business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock.\n\n\u201cOn the short run, though, this might indeed be an opportunity for profit taking, for traders thinking the global economy is still due for more pain and a hard landing,\u201d said d\u2019Anethan.\n\nEther fell 0.96% to US$1,898, while holding a weekly gain of 3.62%.\n\nXRP was the only top 10 non-stablecoin token logging gains for the past 24 hours, rising 2.09% to US$0.4922 and moving up 6.72% for the week. The token received a boost from developments in the lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Ripple Labs, whose blockchain payment protocol uses XRP.\n\nThe court will make public internal documents showing former SEC director William Hinman in 2018 said sales of Ether tokens were not securities transactions, which could undermine the SEC allegation that Ripple Labs sales of XRP were an illegal securities sale, tweeted pro-Ripple attorney John Deaton on Sunday.\n\nDeaton, who said the Hinman documents will move into the public domain even if the SEC and Ripple agree to settle, added that XRP is underpriced and predicted it will attract more buyers and climb to US$1 and beyond.\n\nThe total market cap of cryptocurrencies dropped 1.13% in the past 24 hours to US$1.16 trillion, while the 24-hour market volume dipped 5.54% to US$29.64 billion.\n\nForkast 500 gains; Bitcoin NFT sales fall\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index rose 1.34% to 3,409.12 in the 24 hours to 10:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, moving up 0.66% for the week.\n\nNFT sales on Ethereum rose 18.19% in the past 24 hours to US$16.06 million, according to CryptoSlam data. The Solana, Polygon and Cardano networks also saw increased NFT sales in the past 24 hours.\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain, vying with Ethereum for NFT supremacy, saw its 24-hour NFT sales drop 33.64% to US$4.31 million as the hype for $OXBT BRC-20 NFTs faded. The newly launched NFT collection, which accounts for more than a third of sales on the Bitcoin network, posted a 50.97% sales slide in the 24 hours to US$1.52 million.\n\nNakamigos, an Ethereum-based NFT collection, saw the largest sales in the same period across the market, rising 12.27% to US$2.06 million.\n\nElsewhere, Reddit Collectible Avatars, an NFT collection launched by Reddit in July 2022 that act as customizable avatars on the popular social media, had almost 10 million holders as of Tuesday morning, according to data from Dune Analytics, signalling a milestone for Reddit\u2019s Web 3.0 initiatives.\n\nThe growing popularity of Reddit\u2019s NFT project lies in its simplicity, said Web3 technology firm Redeem Co-Founder Toby Rush in an earlier commentary. \u201cImportantly, Reddit\u2019s activation avoided any mention of NFTs. The assets were easy to understand and use, brought real utility to those who held them, and could be purchased with traditional fiat, not crypto.\u201d\n\nU.S. futures gain\n\nU.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Image: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded higher as of 1:50 p.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures moved up 0.11%. The S&P 500 futures gained 0.23%, and the Nasdaq futures rose 0.39%.\n\nThe gains came on the back of the debt ceiling deal in Washington, likely removing the risk of a U.S. government default. The bill would suspend the debt limit until January 2025, and will be voted on by Congress on Wednesday.\n\nThe bill included a block on a proposed tax on electricity used by cryptocurrency miners, a positive for the U.S. crypto mining industry.\n\nWith the debt ceiling threat seemingly removed, U.S. investor focus could return to interest rates after the personal consumption expenditures price index released on Friday showed inflation remains a risk, indicating the Federal Reserve could keep interest rates higher for longer.\n\nThe Federal Reserve meets on June 14 to decide on rates, which are now between 5 and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 40.4% chance the Fed will keep rates unchanged in June, and a 59.6% chance for another 25 basis-point rate hike, down from 63% on Monday, but still a sharp increase from 25.7% on May 22.\n\nBoosted by the rate hike expectation and relieved debt ceiling concerns, treasury futures linked to the U.S. government bond market rallied on Monday, according to Bloomberg, which could add to the pressure on riskier assets, such as stocks and cryptocurrencies.\n\nOther economic data out this week include the U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on Thursday, a measure of the health of manufacturing industries. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, below 50 a contraction."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s volatility has dropped to historically low levels thanks to macroeconomic uncertainty and low market liquidity. However, on-chain and options market data allude to incoming volatility in June.\n\nThe Bitcoin Volatility Index, which measures the daily fluctuations in Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price, shows that the 30-day volatility in Bitcoin\u2019s price was 1.52%, which is less than half of the yearly averages across Bitcoin\u2019s history, with values usually above 4%.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, the expectation of volatility is a \u201clogical conclusion\u201d based on the fact that low volatility levels were only seen for 19.3% of Bitcoin\u2019s price history.\n\nThe latest weekly update from the on-chain analytics firm shows that Glassnode\u2019s monthly realized volatility metric for Bitcoin slipped below the lower bounds of the historical Bollinger Band, suggesting an incoming uptick in volatility.\n\nBolinger Bands for Bitcoin monthly realized volatility metric. Source: Glassnode\n\nLong-term Bitcoin holders metric points to a price breakout\n\nThe on-chain transfer volumes of Bitcoin across cryptocurrency exchanges dropped to historically low levels. The price is also trading near short-term holder bias, indicating a \u201cbalanced position of profit and loss for new investors\u201d that bought coins during and after the 2021-2022 bull cycle, according to the report. Currently, 50% of new investors are in profit, with the rest in loss.\n\nHowever, while the short-term holders reached equilibrium levels, long-term holders were seen making a move in the recent correction, which underpins volatility, according to the analysts.\n\nGlassnode categorizes coins older than 155 days in a single wallet under long-term holder supply.\n\nThe gray bars in the image below show the long-term holder (LTH) binary spending indicator, which tracks whether LTH spending averaged over the last seven days is adequate to decrease their total holdings.\n\nIt shows previous instances when LTH spending increased, which was usually followed by a volatility uptick.\n\nLong-term holder spending binary indicator.

However, prolonged compression of volatility can indicate a big incoming move in terms of price.\n\nBitfinex\u2019s latest Alpha report shows that the DVOL index, which represents the market\u2019s expectation of 30-day future implied Bitcoin volatility, slipped to 45 from a reading of 50 right before the expiry, which represents a yearly low.\n\nThe DVOL index for Bitcoin options.

A higher weight of put options shows that traders are increasingly turning bearish on Bitcoin.\n\nAnalysts at Bitfinex currently expect \u201cpotential market turbulence and short-term price fluctuations\u201d in June, especially close to the expiry toward the month\u2019s end.\n\nThe potential price levels that can act as a magnet according to options market positioning are the maximum pain levels for May and June\u2019s expiration at $27,000 and $24,000, respectively.\n\nMaximum pain, also known as max pain or option pain, is a concept used in options trading and refers to the price at which the buyers incur maximum losses.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "A big part of the appeal of investing in cryptocurrency is the chance to get a massive return on your investment. Because crypto is so volatile, it could make you rich. Or, you could lose practically everything you invested in the blink of an eye.\n\nIf you keep up with crypto at all, you've probably read stories about people who have put all their money in it. The lucky ones have even come out ahead, with some making millions of dollars. Success stories like these get a lot more common during bull markets, and they're enough to make you wonder \"what if?\"\n\nLet's say you decided to invest all your money in crypto. While there's no predicting exactly what the results would be, there are a few things you can expect with complete certainty.\n\nYou'll have an extremely volatile and stressful portfolio\n\nThere's no overstating how volatile cryptocurrency is. Take Bitcoin (BTC) as an example. If you had invested in 1 Bitcoin at the start of 2020, it would have cost you $7,195. Here are some of the ups and downs you would've then experienced if you held on to your 1 Bitcoin:\n\nApril 14, 2021: $63,577 (up 784%!)\n\n$63,577 (up 784%!) July 21, 2021: $29,972 (down 53%)\n\n$29,972 (down 53%) Nov. 10, 2021: $69,045 (up 130%!)\n\n$69,045 (up 130%!) Nov. 9, 2022: $18,562 (down 73%)\n\nThis kind of volatility is a whole lot easier to stomach when it's all hypothetical, or when you have just a small portion of your portfolio in crypto. When crypto is 100% of your portfolio, the volatility becomes far less exciting and much more stressful.\n\nSafe storage becomes even more important\n\nOne of the challenges of cryptocurrency is deciding where to store it. There's no perfect solution, which is especially worrying if you put all your money in crypto.\n\nOur top crypto play isn't a token - Here\u2019s why We\u2019ve found one company that\u2019s positioned itself perfectly as a long-term picks-and-shovels solution for the broader crypto market \u2014 Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and all the others. In fact, you've probably used this company's technology in the past few days, even if you've never had an account or even heard of the company before. That's how prevalent it's become. Sign up today for Stock Advisor and get access to our exclusive report where you can get the full scoop on this company and its upside as a long-term investment. Learn more and get started today with a special new member discount. Get started\n\nThe simplest option is to store your crypto with the app, exchange, or stock broker where you buy it. This works best from a convenience perspective, as you don't need to transfer your crypto anywhere. Also, if you lose access to your account, you can reset your password to get back in. But storing your crypto this way also has some downsides:\n\nCrypto exchanges are a popular target for scammers. You'll need to keep your login information safe and watch out for phishing scams.\n\nYou'll need to keep your login information safe and watch out for phishing scams. You're at risk of losing your crypto if the exchange goes bankrupt. As the collapse of FTX shows, exchanges aren't always nearly as safe as they seem.\n\nYou could also use one of the many crypto wallets for storage. With a wallet, your crypto is entirely in your possession. That means you're not at risk of losing it if the exchange where you bought it collapses. But if you lose access to your wallet and your recovery phrase for it, then you've lost access to your crypto, and there's no way to get it back.\n\nYou'll have tough decisions to make even if you're successful\n\nThe best-case scenario is that your crypto investments are successful. To be clear, this is a long shot. Even if it happens, what comes next can be much more challenging than people realize.\n\nLet's say you had $50,000 to invest, and you put it all in crypto. Six months later, your decision was a success, and your investments are worth $100,000. Here's the question -- what do you do now? You could:\n\nKeep everything the same and let it ride. After all, you don't want to miss out if those cryptocurrencies continue to increase in value.\n\nAfter all, you don't want to miss out if those cryptocurrencies continue to increase in value. Take some profits and also keep some money invested. For example, you sell $50,000 worth to get your initial investment back, and keep the remaining $50,000 in crypto.\n\nFor example, you sell $50,000 worth to get your initial investment back, and keep the remaining $50,000 in crypto. Sell everything and take your $50,000 in profits. This way, you're not at risk if those cryptocurrencies decrease in value.\n\nIt's a good position to be in, but it's not an easy decision to make. And if you decide to sell anything, you're going to owe short-term capital gains taxes, because you didn't hold your investment for at least one year. Short-term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income. Depending on how much you make and your income from other sources, you could end up owing 30% or more of your profits in crypto taxes.\n\nMany investors like to add crypto to their portfolio as an alternative investment. There's nothing wrong with that, within reason. If you want to devote 5% to 10% of your portfolio to crypto because you think it's the future or you're excited about the profit potential, go for it. But putting everything in crypto isn't recommended. It's far too risky, which is the opposite of what you want in an investing strategy."

        "content": "Cuba had its first-ever Bitcoin-only meetup over the weekend, with more than 60 people attending. It was hosted by Cuba Bitcoin at the Bitcoin-friendly bar and restaurant Pazillo. Cuba Bitcoin is a lively group of Bitcoin (BTC) advocates and activists whose discussions on Telegram between anonymous social media accounts that hide people\u2019s identities had yet to make it into the real world.\n\nThe Cuba Bitcoin community, complete with emojis to hide faces.\n\nCuba\u2019s foray into Bitcoin signifies a departure from the centralized economic model that has shaped Cuba\u2019s economy for decades. Despite limited internet access, financial constraints and a socialist-styled government, the meetup underscored that Cubans are increasingly turning to crypto as a means of financial freedom and an \u201cexit\u201d from the local economy.\n\nCuba Bitcoin co-founder Forte11 (not his real name) told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cThe mission of the meetup is to educate, not convince Cubans about the potential of Bitcoin in Cuba. Each person has the freedom of expression to decide what they want to do. It\u2019s education, education and education first and foremost.\u201d\n\nWhile Bitcoin meetups in the West might be dominated by white, middle-aged men, Cuba\u2019s Bitcoin-only meetup included a wide range of characters. From small business owners and software developers to teenage students and grandmothers, more than 60 people turned up. Paco de la India, a Bitcoin vlogger and evangelist, also attended, delivering a talk on Bitcoin adoption around the world.\n\nAlthough Cuba is technically a centrally planned economy, the state recently relaxed laws on private business ownership. This arena is the target market for Bitcoin merchant adoption, as it is now legal to accept cryptocurrencies for goods and services thanks to recent crypto regulations passed in Cuba.\n\nTo demonstrate this, the group sold Cuba Bitcoin T-shirts for 1,000 satoshis ($0.30) so attendees could learn about the layer-2 Lightning Network \u2014 and they sold out.\n\nPaying for T-shirts via Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network during the meetup.\n\nNonetheless, the main talk of the day revolved around how to get one\u2019s hands on Bitcoin. In a country where mobile internet penetration remains relatively low and smartphones are not yet ubiquitous, downloading Bitcoin applications or wallets is out of reach for many Cubans.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, due to the United States trade embargo, familiar exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken and Gemini are not welcome in Cuba. As a result, Cubans tend to buy Bitcoin the OG way, through peer-to-peer exchange.\n\nForte11 introduces \u201cC\u201d (face hidden) ahead of their talk on buying Bitcoin peer-to-peer.\n\nBitcoin Cuba co-founder \u201cC\u201d delivered a talk on how to buy Bitcoin peer-to-peer through Telegram trading groups. Through a Lightning-enabled tipping bot on Telegram, Cubans can buy Bitcoin in exchange for Cuban pesos or the Cuban Moneda Libremente Convertible, or MLC \u2014 a \u201cdollar-backed,\u201d government-owned stablecoin. Mobile transfers can also make purchases as more and more Cubans access government-run banking services. Most trades in the Telegram groups range between $0.20 and $50. (The average Cuban earns just $40 a month.)\n\nRelated: \u2018The Bitcoin Standard\u2019 author becomes economic adviser to El Salvador\n\nWell-known Cuban crypto enthusiast Erich Garcia Cruz also attended the meetup. He told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cUsing Bitcoin, you can be a freedom person. We have a lot of opportunity here if we teach all the businesses to use Bitcoin as a payment method, to use Bitcoin as a freedom tool \u2014 as that\u2019s the path.\u201d\n\nNow more than 10 businesses in Cuba\u2019s capital, Havana, accept Bitcoin for goods and services. Buoyed by the success of the first Cuba Bitcoin meetup, the community intends to set up regular future meetups and events.\n\nThis interview is part of an upcoming Cointelegraph documentary about Bitcoin adoption in Cuba.

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether inched up during Tuesday afternoon trading hours in Hong Kong, while the rest of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization were mixed. XRP was the day\u2019s biggest gainer, while the Polygon\u2019s Matic saw the day\u2019s biggest decline, falling 2.52%.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin weighed down by debt ceiling uncertainty\n\nXRP leads winners\n\nBitcoin rose 0.05% from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong to US$27,808. Over the same time, Ether rose 0.31% to US$1,904.\n\n\u201cThe sideways of Bitcoin is very much related to the current market risks and the fear,\u201d Aziz Kenjaev, the chief security officer of trading platform WuuTrade, said in a statement. \u201cInvestors\u2019 activity during any economic risk talks is cautious. Hence the sideways in US$26,000 \u2013 US$30,000. Positive talks about the U.S. economy will break this crab walk in a positive way.\u201d\n\nXRP led the day\u2019s gains among the top 10 cryptocurrencies, rising 4.67% over the past 24 hours to US$0.5028. The coin started picking up momentum after pro-Ripple attorney John Deaton tweeted on Sunday, that the court will make public internal documents from 2018 showing former Securities and Exchange Commission director William Hinman saying sales of Ether tokens were not securities transactions, which could undermine the regulator\u2019s case against Ripple Labs.\n\nThe U.S. securities watchdog sued the San Francisco-based payments firm in December 2020, claiming that XRP was a security and that Ripple had conducted unregistered securities transactions by selling the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin NFT sales rally dampens\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.98% in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong while rising 0.56% during the week.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s secondary non-fungible token (NFT) sales fell 23.14% to US$4.2 million in the last 24 hours, with $OXBT BRC-20 NFTs dropping 50.20% to US$1.3 million, according to CryptoSlam.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales rose 2.08% to US$15.6 million, boosted by Nakamigos sales rising 72.04% to US$1.5 million. Sales for the largest Ethereum-based collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, also rose 52.91% to US$1.2 million.\n\nAmong Forkast Labs NFT indexes, the Forkast POL NFT Composite was the only loser over the past day with a 1.98% decline. Secondary NFT sales volume on the Polygon network has dropped 21.8%, CryptoSlam\u2019s data shows. Matic, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum scaler, recorded Tuesday\u2019s largest drop among cryptocurrencies, with a 2.52% fall to US$0.9052.\n\nAsian stocks rise, U.S. debt deal boosts futures\n\nHong Kong stock market exchange and charts information via led computer monitor displayed in Mong Kok. Image: Envato Elements\n\nTuesday witnessed a boost in major Asian equities, with Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index climbing 0.24%, but remaining near a six-month low. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 rose 0.30%, the Shanghai Composite increased 0.086%, and the Shenzhen Component Index gained 0.44%.\n\nInvestors are looking ahead to the release of China\u2019s Purchasing Manager Index data scheduled for Wednesday. The economic signal may provide insights into the post-pandemic recovery trajectory of the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nGlobal investor sentiment received a significant lift by U.S. President Joe Biden announcing on Sunday that a preliminary deal to raise the government\u2019s US$31.4 trillion debt ceiling was reached, a move intended to avert a \u201ccatastrophic default.\u201d The House Rules Committee is slated to vote on the bill Tuesday afternoon, with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy anticipating that over 95% of Republicans will support the bill.\n\nU.S. stock futures rose as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, as concerns over a governmental default eased. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 0.21%, the S&P 500 futures index gained 0.47%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures strengthened by 0.97%.\n\nInvestors are awaiting Friday\u2019s release of the U.S. jobs report for May, which includes the crucial nonfarm payroll data. This report often serves as a barometer for predicting the Federal Reserve\u2019s next monetary policy decision.\n\nSee related article: Hong Kong Solidifies Crypto Regulations even as Malaysia bears down on Huobi"

        "content": "Early Bitcoin (BTC) investor and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) advocate Roger Ver claimed that Ethereum, not Bitcoin, will be responsible for driving the bulk of new users towards crypto.\n\nOn a May 31 episode of the Show Me The Crypto podcast, Ver \u2014 labeled \u201cBitcoin Jesus\u201d for his early Bitcoin advocacy \u2014 said that despite Ethereum\u2019s scaling issues and the other layer-one \u201cclones\u201d that have popped up in its wake, the Ethereum ecosystem is still where the action is:\n\n\u201cEven though Ethereum doesn\u2019t have the biggest market cap compared to Bitcoin, I think Ethereum is the front-runner in terms of driving worldwide adoption.\u201d\n\nVer praised the rise of Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible (EVM) blockchains and layer-2 scaling solutions such as Polygon (MATIC) that can help share some of the load away from the main chain.\n\nVer provides an account of the \u201ccivil war\u201d that occurred in the early days of Bitcoin between Etheruem\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Bitcoin core developers.\n\nDisagreements over the use of smart contracts and moving away from the idea of blockchains being used purely as currency or stores of value eventually drove Buterin to develop Ethereum, Ver noted:\n\n\u201cAll of that would have been built on top of Bitcoin if not for the scaling civil war that happened. These Bitcoin core developers hate Vitalik, and they basically drove him from the project to go and create Ethereum, and more power to him for that.\u201d\n\nVer also spoke on the recent Ledger debate, calling the controversial Recover service \u201cdisappointing.\u201d The service allows users to store their encrypted seed phase with external custodians to safeguard against loss; Ver said that while it\u2019s fine for people to have custodial accounts and choose to recover their keys if they wish, the ethos of crypto is centered on having full control of your assets at all times.\n\nRelated: Hybrid rollups: The silver bullet for scalability and security on Ethereum\n\nIn January, Ver was sued by a trading unit of the crypto lending firm Genesis for failing to pay some $20.8 million in unsettled crypto options.\n\nVer claimed in a January Reddit post that he had \u201csufficient funds\u201d to pay the outstanding sum but argued that because Genesis was no longer solvent, he was not legally required to uphold his end of the deal.\n\nLast year, Ver made headlines for allegations of defaulting on a debt. CoinFLEX CEO Mark Lamb claimed Ver owed the firm $47 million USD Coin (USDC) and was bound by a written contract. On June 28, Ver denied these claims without directly mentioning the company.\n\nMagazine: Ordinals turned Bitcoin into a worse version of Ethereum \u2014 Can we fix it?"

        "title": "How to benefit from Bitcoin volatility with market analysis and trading bots - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Trading Bitcoin (BTC) is not easy, given the relatively high volatility of the cryptocurrency, its low correlation to other asset classes, and its reaction to various factors that can come from both the crypto industry and traditional finance.\n\nLike the U.S. dollar and other fiat currencies, which are mostly driven by macroeconomic factors, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can become volatile when the Federal Reserve surprises with its interest rate decision. However, Bitcoin can also react to the collapse of a major crypto exchange like FTX. Therefore, it\u2019s difficult to predict where the next big trigger may come from, which is why Bitcoin traders should pay closer attention to market analysis on all fronts.\n\nWhere is Bitcoin today and what to expect?\n\nIn 2023, Bitcoin experienced a period of recovery, with the price starting the year near $16,500 and peaking in mid-April above $31,000 to reach its highest level since the beginning of June 2022.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe recent banking crisis has helped Bitcoin, with mid-sized banks like Silvergate, Signature and Silicon Valley Bank failing within days of each other in March this year. Expectations that the Fed will continue to raise rates at a slow pace have provided additional bullish support.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has seen some correction in May amid regulatory uncertainty and ongoing concerns that the U.S. debt ceiling negotiations could fail and lead to a default.\n\nStill, crypto believers expect systemic risks to push Bitcoin to new highs this year. For example, U.S. venture capitalist Balaji Srinivasan even bet $1 million that BTC would exceed $1 million by June this year. He said that hyperinflation would hit the U.S. dollar, causing the USD value of a Bitcoin to skyrocket.\n\nWhile the $1 million outlook may seem far-fetched, the upcoming halving event can lay the foundation for another record price this year or next.\n\nIn order to evaluate trading opportunities and understand Bitcoin\u2019s next moves, active traders should spend more time on market analysis. By scanning the market regularly, traders can gain valuable insights and make informed decisions.\n\nMarket analysis can help traders find the best entry and exit points to make the most of Bitcoin\u2019s price fluctuations. Integrating a trading bot into the trading process can enhance the benefits of market analysis by bringing automation and implementing risk management tools. In addition, most trading bots focus on technical analysis to determine the best entry and exit points based on support and resistance levels, indicators and volume data, among others.\n\nThis trading bot helps users automate trading and benefit from BTC fluctuations\n\nConducting in-depth analysis and leveraging automation offered by trading bots can lead to lucrative opportunities in the Bitcoin market. TradeSanta is a relevant example of a trading bot with many features to help novice and experienced traders deal with Bitcoin price fluctuations.\n\nWith TradeSanta, users can create customized trading bots within 5 minutes. Once ready, these bots can work in both spot and futures markets. The application monitors the market day and night to find better opportunities. It has a built-in trading terminal to manage all portfolios from one place.\n\nThe trading bot helps many traders take advantage of the cryptocurrency market without spending much time. Many have full-time jobs but still want to get exposure to Bitcoin and other digital currencies, and this is where TradeSanta comes in handy.\n\nSince making an informed decision requires time and effort to analyze the markets, busy users can copy trade from TradeSanta\u2019s community traders or use top-performing bots to implement better trading strategies. Users can browse and use successfully tested strategies and choose the ones they like by exchange, strategy, template, market, or trading pairs.\n\nSource: TradeSanta\n\nTradeSanta also allows users to benefit from top-performing bots by using copy trading services to implement better trading strategies.\n\nTraders who don\u2019t want to rely on third parties can use TradeSanta to trade on their own and automate many processes. For example, they can improve risk management by leveraging the stop-loss feature that sets a limit on how much traders are willing to lose in a position. Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, and implementing reliable risk management measures is imperative. Using the stop-loss feature can help traders minimize their losses.\n\nMany traders exit too early or wait too long to close a position, resulting in missed profits or losses. TradeSanta's trading bot helps users to set their individual strategies and risk profile, and also to exit their positions at the right time. Moreover, traders can optimize their trading strategies by using fundamental analysis and TradeSanta's tools to open long and short positions.\n\nIn addition, users can discuss trading strategies 24/7, get the latest market updates and recommendations from experienced traders and the community, and be quickly notified about all TradeSanta\u2019s changes and improvements.\n\nLearn more about TradeSanta"

Rodarmor handed the role over to pseudonymous coder Raphjaph.\n\nI haven't been able to give ord the attention it deserves, so I am pleased to announce that @raphjaph has agreed to step up as lead maintainer!\n\n\n\nRaph is an impoverished student, and his work on ord will be entirely funded by donations.

This new token standard, brought about by pseudonymous developer \u201cDomo,\u201d allowed users to mint entirely new tokens on Bitcoin for the first time in history.\n\nOrdinal inscriptions in 2023.

Source: BRC-20.io\n\nThe rise of Ordinals has not been without controversy, with many Bitcoin advocates criticizing the method of \u201cinscribing\u201d assets on the network for being inefficient and wasteful, especially when it comes to block space and transaction fees.\n\nAs such, other developers have been exploring the use of smart contracts to mint assets and NFTs on Bitcoin.\n\nRelated: Ordinals and BRC-20 will disappear in a matter of months, says Jan3 CEO\n\nOn the flip side, Bitcoin advocates have praised Ordinals for its ability to onboard new users into the wider Bitcoin community. Recently, avid anti-Bitcoin advocate Peter Schiff minted a small number of NFTs on Bitcoin by way of the Ordinals protocol, marking the first time the gold-loving investor had ever interacted with Bitcoin beyond criticizing it.\n\nWhile it\u2019s clear that Ordinals have played a major role in the spiking of Bitcoin transaction fees, the flurry of network activity has been a boon for miners, which have now seen more than $44 million in Ordinals-related fees paid out, according to data from Dune Analytics.\n\nMagazine: $3.4B of Bitcoin in a popcorn tin \u2014 The Silk Road hacker\u2019s story"

        "title": "Can Any Blockchain Compete on Security With Bitcoin? - Blockworks",
        "content": "Knowledgeable crypto enthusiasts \u2014 most of them, anyway \u2014 would generally agree that the Bitcoin network, thanks to its highly competitive and tamper-resistant proof of work blockchain design, is the most secure decentralized blockchain network in the world.\n\nAnd for many, the competition isn\u2019t even close. According to its strongest loyalists, sometimes referred to as bitcoin \u201cmaximalists,\u201d all other protocols are nothing more than inferior knock-offs that will inevitably fall into irrelevance, given enough time.\n\nWhile Mark Yusko, founder of Morgan Creek Capital doesn\u2019t consider himself a maxi, he does contend that the next closest competitor is, at the very best, a distant second in the rankings.\n\nIn an interview with Mike Ippolito on Blockworks\u2019 On the Margin podcast, Yusko asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s the safest, most secure computing network the world has ever known?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bitcoin blockchain. And it\u2019s not close, right?\u201d\n\nIppolito pushes back, asking, \u201cYou don\u2019t think Ethereum\u2018s close in terms of the settlement guarantees?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s close,\u201d Yusko replies.\n\nIt\u2019s like comparing prestigious business schools, Yusko says. The top schools are recognized and agreed upon by everybody: \u201cHarvard,\u201d then gesturing downward, \u201cStanford \u2014 and then everybody else who thinks they\u2019re number three.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will argue, bitcoin\u2019s number one. Ethereum\u2019s a pretty big step down.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still not convinced \u2014 and I\u2019m willing to be convinced \u2014 that proof-of-stake is as secure as proof of work.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt could be that I just don\u2019t understand the technology well enough,\u201d he admits, but \u201cproof of work is at least one order of magnitude more secure than proof of stake.\u201d\n\nDifferent roadmaps\n\nIppolito argues that the two blockchains serve different purposes. \u201cI like both of them. I just don\u2019t view them as being competition. I think they\u2019re very different things.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn order to really, truly love bitcoin and have it be the vast majority, like, the only holding that you have,\u201d Ippolito says, \u201cyou have to have a pretty dim view of what\u2019s going to happen in the future.\u201d\n\nIppolito admits, \u201cthere\u2019s probably some sort of reckoning coming and that\u2019s why I like bitcoin.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat said, there\u2019s not much to do on that network.\u201d\n\nWith Ethereum, Ippolito says, so many applications are being built for a variety of purposes including borrowing and lending for yield, money market funds, and so forth. \u201cThat, to me, is more intellectually interesting and draws a lot of my mindshare.\u201d\n\nWhat makes the Bitcoin network such a great store of store value also makes it very difficult to build applications on top of it in the same way as Ethereum, Ippolito says.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve pursued two different roadmaps,\u201d he argues.\n\nOne chain to rule them all\n\n\u201cLook, we are tribal at our core,\u201d Yusko says.\n\n\u201cI hear the maxis drone on, and I just ignore the nonsense of it, the toxic part of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf DeFi can be built successfully on the bitcoin blockchain,\u201d he says, with functions built on top that resemble traditional finance layers like Fedwire, ACH, and Visa, \u201cthen we can have one chain to rule all chains.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m open,\u201d Yusko says, \u201cI\u2019m not going to ignore the fact \u2014 there\u2019s lots of interesting things being built in Ethereum.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "What is Bitcoin? (Explain Like I\u2019m 5)\n\nBitcoin is like a special kind of money that exists only on the internet. It was created in 2009 and works in a different way than regular money. Instead of being controlled by banks or governments, bitcoin is managed by a network of computers all around the world.\n\nImagine you have a toy that you want to share with your friends, but instead of giving it directly to them, you give them a special code. That code represents the toy, and your friends can use it to trade or give it to someone else. That\u2019s how bitcoin works.\n\nBitcoin is stored in a digital wallet on your computer or smartphone, and you can send it to other people just like sending an email. Every transaction is recorded in a public ledger called the blockchain, which makes it very secure and difficult to cheat.\n\nBitcoin is a special kind of internet money that is managed by a network of computers.\n\nOne interesting thing about bitcoin is that there will only ever be a limited number of them. It\u2019s like having a limited edition of something valuable. Some people believe that because of this limited supply and growing popularity, the value of bitcoin may go up over time.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to remember that bitcoin can be very volatile. Its value can go up and down a lot in a short time, so it\u2019s considered a risky investment. That\u2019s why it\u2019s often recommended to only invest a small portion of your money in bitcoin and hold onto it for a long time, like five years or more.\n\nIn conclusion, bitcoin is a special kind of internet money that is managed by a network of computers. It offers the possibility of secure and decentralized transactions, but it\u2019s important to be aware of its volatility and consider it as a long-term investment.\n\n\ufeff\n\nInvestor Takeaway\n\nJust like adding a special toy to your collection of toys, including a small portion of quality crypto assets like bitcoin in your investment plan can be exciting and potentially bring more value over time. It\u2019s important to remember that while crypto assets can be fun and have the potential to grow in value, they can also be risky. By sticking to a long-term investment strategy and only investing a small part of your money in crypto, you can enjoy the potential benefits while minimizing the chances of losing too much.\n\nBuild your wealth with our proven crypto strategy.

        "content": "Bitcoin Ordinals are the latest layer-2 solution enabling decentralized storage of digital art on the Bitcoin blockchain. Ordinals will now allow users to migrate their Ethereum ERC-721-based nonfungible tokens (NFTs) to the Bitcoin blockchain with the launch of the BRC-721E standard.\n\nThe BRC-721E standard was jointly launched by the Ordinals market \u2014 an Ordinals-based marketplace \u2014 and the Bitcoin Miladys NFT collection. The new BRC-721E standard enables the conversion of immutable, verifiable ERC-721 NFTs to Ordinals. Initially, metadata is not stored on-chain, but users can store a lower-quality preview image and include a reference to the Ether (ETH) burn in the raw image data.\n\nThe migration process starts by burning the ERC-721 NFT with an ETH call function. The burning of the NFT is an irreversible process and acts as an on-chain inscription method. To claim the ETH burn on Bitcoin, the user must inscribe valid BRC-721E data, after which the bridged NFT will appear on a custom Ordinals market collection page with complete metadata.\n\nThe indexers that check the burned NFT data inscriptions ensure that a token has no more than one valid inscription and that the genesis address matches the burn transaction call data.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin Ordinals surpass 10M inscriptions as creator Rodarmor steps down\n\nThe Ordinals market claimed the fundamental principles of BRC-721E and the flexibility of the indexers allow for the protocol to evolve over time, despite the fact that metadata is initially not stored on-chain.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals has attracted widespread reaction from the crypto community since its launch in January 2023. The launch of the BRC-20 token standard in March created an experimental fungible token standard designed specifically for the Bitcoin blockchain. The combination of BRC-20 with Ordinals opened new gates for minting tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain, with the crypto community seeing the emergence of many popular BRC-20 tokens, such as Ordinals (ORDI), Vmpx (VMPX) and Pepecoin (PEPE).\n\nThe number of BRC-20 tokens has skyrocketed from a few hundred in its first week to over 25,000 at the time of publication. However, the rise of Ordinals and the new token minting era has not been unanimously well-received, with many Bitcoin (BTC) proponents criticizing the new method as inefficient and wasteful.\n\nMagazine: $3.4B of Bitcoin in a popcorn tin \u2014 The Silk Road hacker\u2019s story"

        "content": "Change is in the air. Crypto and non-fungible tokens (NFT) have been in a pretty brutal bear market for almost exactly a year now, which many, myself included, had projected to last for years.\n\nBut now, there are signs of life springing up all around, being driven by Bitcoin NFTs, and recent news of China opening the door for citizens to engage the blockchain again. The bear market may be over sooner than we had thought, so let\u2019s get into what\u2019s making me think that NFTs might just be back.\n\nNoteworthy Happenings\n\nChina is coming into NFTs and crypto, and Russia will use crypto to settle payments across borders. These two major announcements are bringing excitement back to the NFT and crypto markets and lead many to believe that these alone can turn the market around.\n\nCollectors are eying high-priced NFTs ahead of a potential incoming pump from Chinese investors looking to snatch NFT grails like CryptoPunks, BAYC and Azuki. An x-factor that not enough people are talking about yet is, what if they decided to dive into the mostly unexplored world of Bitcoin NFTs where opportunities may be even greater than the already expensive Ethereum ecosystem?\n\n9c5633eec1494d4082106924f68b42e7\n\n6cb7e0d5822d4f94890b7c0403522c78\n\nBitcoin NFTs are really starting to cook, and just yesterday the 10 millionth Ordinal was inscribed . This massive milestone many thought improbable just a few months ago, but believers in Bitcoin NFTs never had a doubt. At this point, no one can deny that Bitcoin\u2019s NFTs are here to stay, but the question of \u2018Will Bitcoin NFTs flip Ethereum NFTs?\u2019 is another story. I think they will.\n\nA new token standard was created on Bitcoin yesterday called BRC-721E . This will let traders bridge their Ethereum NFT over to Bitcoin by \u201cburning\u201d the Ethereum NFT and re-creating it on Bitcoin. Now we\u2019ll get to see traders\u2019 convictions on the Bitcoin ecosystem play out in real time.\n\nA new meta is emerging in NFTs which is to drop a new cryptocurrency (an ERC-20 or BRC-20 token) and then build an ecosystem around it, likely with NFTs. $OXBT is the new hottest BRC-20 collection on Bitcoin, and there are teases of upcoming utility for this token. Fun fact , $OXBT is now held by more wallets than any other individual digital asset on the Bitcoin blockchain other than BTC itself and its smaller denomination, Satoshis.\n\nStory continues\n\na4599e0a4dd145aeb61cc2d24f2dd35b\n\nThis hot new meta recently took off with new meme coins like $PEPE, $TURBO, $BEN, and $PSYOP looking for ways to drive more users to the token, and the concept now seems destined to shape the NFT scene for the foreseeable future.\n\nGaming on the cusp of taking over Web3\n\nGaming is on the cusp of taking over Web3. Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, now has over 20 blockchain games listed on their store with some like Defimons now entering a closed beta.\n\nIf Mythos Chain\u2019s DMarket, and ImmutableX\u2019s Gods Unchained are any indication of what\u2019s to come (they are), we\u2019re in for a meteoric rise in NFT adoption. Just look at how the buyers/sellers and transactions compare to a typical PFP project.\n\n\n\n2a9870b110894ef6afe55c2126bd4afc\n\nSales from these two projects have propelled them into the top five for the past seven days, foreshadowing what\u2019s to come as blockchain games begin to enter the mainstream.\n\nd8d1482d3ccc4c458ecb33ecf14db76e\n\nPeep the charts\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m fascinated to see who Bitcoin\u2019s growth impacts more, Ethereum and its layer 2s, or Solana? Take notice of which chains aren\u2019t in the top 10 NFT Collection Rankings by Sales Volume for the past 7 days, and you\u2019ll see who it may be.\n\nNakamigos have had a sudden surge, as have Jack Butchers\u2019 art project Openens, pushing both ahead of Milady Maker and into the Top 10. Milady Maker continues to hang around with the big dogs, now with extra action that revolves around the new BRC-721E bridge that originated in the Milady project.\n\n\n\n\n\n5c6fad5d8fee4767872aa5e437fb3e7f\n\nBitcoin continues to fall from its previous seven-day highs, but other ecosystems like Solana and Ethereum are on the upswing. I expect this tug-of-war to continue until new users come into the space, and bring liquidity to be able to push both up at the same time.\n\n(Disclosure: The author of this commentary holds $OXBT)"

The amount of USDT on Tron is $40 billion and surpasses the stablecoin\u2019s supply on Ethereum by $10 billion, according to Coin Metrics\u2019 supply data.\n\nKaiko, a crypto research firm, cited that the reason for Tron\u2019s dominance could be low fees, which makes transactions cheaper for market makers on centralized exchanges.\n\nThe stablecoin transfers led to a spike in Tron fees to make it the second-highest revenue-generating blockchain after Ethereum, per Token Terminal data.\n\nThe TRX/USD pair has a bullish breakout from an ascending triangle pattern with a target of $0.112. Before the pattern\u2019s bullish target is reached, buyers will face resistance at the 2022 high level of around $0.093.\n\nTRX/USD daily price chart.

It commands a 3% market share of the total Ethereum staking pool and has grown twofold in the last six months, according to Dune data from Hildobby.\n\nTop Ethereum liquid staking platforms.

If buyers conquer this resistance level, RPL can witness a 60% upside target based on the ascending triangle pattern.\n\nThe all-time high for the token is $61.90, per CoinGecko data. A price breakout above this level would technically put the token into price discovery mode without any resistance to the upside.\n\nOn the other hand, sellers will target local lows of $45.57 and $37.95 in case of correction.\n\nRelated: What are artificial intelligence (AI) crypto coins, and how do they work?\n\nRender Token price analysis\n\nRender Token (RNDR) benefited from the recent artificial intelligence (AI) hype that has culminated in an uptick in companies requiring graphics cards for training AI models.\n\nRNDR is an ERC-20 utility token that powers Render Network, a protocol that provides a decentralized marketplace for graphics processing unit (GPU) power. Using RNDR as the medium of exchange, Render Network connects users looking to rent the processing power with those who have idle GPUs.\n\nRNDR has added 5.5% gains in May, rallying strongly in the second half of the month. Data from Nansen shows that the smart token holding for RNDR has reduced since the start of this year. Nevertheless, the number of unique smart wallets holding RNDR has increased linearly during the same period.\n\nThe number of smart money wallets holding RNDR and the total balances.

If buyers build support above it, the token could enter a crucial pivotal parallel range between $3.19 and $2.13.\n\nThere is minimal resistance above $3.19, with the potential to touch 2022 highs of $5.29. To the downside, buyers may find support around local lows at $1.62 and $0.90.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The coin started picking up momentum after pro-Ripple attorney John Deaton tweeted on Sunday, that the court will make public internal documents from 2018 showing former Securities and Exchange Commission director William Hinman saying sales of Ether tokens were not securities transactions, which could undermine the regulator\u2019s case against Ripple Labs.

Interest in Bitcoin NFTs is surging, after the new BRC-721E token standard was launched on Monday. The token standard allow Ethereum-native ERC-721 NFTs to be permanently transferred to Bitcoin, where they become BRC-721E tokens.\n\nThe launch of the new Bitcoin-based token standard has pushed the Milday Maker NFT collection to the top 10 for daily sales. Originally founded on Ethereum, Miladay Maker participated in the creation of the BRC-721E token standard.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales rose 10.25% to US$19.1 million, boosted by Bored Ape Yacht Club, which rose 1.32%, generating US$2.6 million in sales for the network.

Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 experienced a 1.41% decrease, while the Shanghai Composite inched down 0.61% and the Shenzhen Component Index dipped 0.70%.\n\nConcerns over China\u2019s economic recovery impacted investor sentiment, as the country\u2019s manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index fell to a five-month low in May. The data suggests that factory activity contracted more rapidly than anticipated due to diminishing demand, leading to the offshore yuan depreciating to US$7.12 per dollar, its lowest value in six months.\n\nU.S. stock futures were also red as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, as investors awaited updates on the U.S. debt ceiling deal. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.15%, the S&P 500 futures index inched down 0.18%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures weakened by 0.18%.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy reached a preliminary deal on Sunday, that would suspend the debt ceiling until after the presidential election in 2024. While the bill passed through the House rules committee by a 7-6 margin on Tuesday, it still needs approval from the full House, which is set to vote on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Treasury Department moved the date at which the U.S. would reach its borrowing limit to June 5.\n\nThe U.S. dollar index rose 0.33% to 104.5 points on Wednesday, on track for a monthly gain of nearly 3%.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nWhile Ethereum remains the dominant NFT platform in terms of trading volume and overall value, Bitcoin has undoubtedly swallowed up much of the buzz in the NFT space via the recent rise of the Ordinals protocol. And for Ethereum NFT holders who\u2019d rather be on Bitcoin, there\u2019s now a migration solution\u2014but it\u2019s a one-way trip.\n\nBitcoin Miladys, an NFT project that offers derivatives of the Ethereum-based Milady Maker profile picture (PFP) project, launched a bridge in partnership with marketplace Ordinals Market and the Xverse Bitcoin wallet. The BRC-721E token standard, as it\u2019s called, enables the bridge to migrate artwork and data over to Bitcoin via Ordinals.\n\nThe bridge lets holders of Ethereum NFTs\u2014defined by the ERC-721 token standard\u2014effectively move the asset to the Bitcoin blockchain via a burn-and-mint process. The original Ethereum NFT is sent to an inaccessible \u201cburn\u201d address, which means it\u2019s essentially destroyed on the chain, but then the asset is recreated on Bitcoin via the Ordinals protocol.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin Miladys were initially minted on Ethereum, so the bridge was initially designed to let its holders bring them over to Bitcoin. But as the Ordinals Market page describes, the BRC-721E token standard and bridge can work with any compatible Ethereum NFT.\n\nSome cross-chain bridges use an escrow wallet in the middle and hold the original NFT or asset, then create a new version on the target chain. That makes it possible to reclaim the original asset on the original chain by burning the secondary version.\n\nIt\u2019s a one way bridge by the way\ud83e\udd2d pic.twitter.com/vTCj8paFV6 \u2014 Bitcoin Miladys\ud83d\udc9e\ud83c\udf4a\ud83d\udcab\ud83c\udf38 (@BitcoinMiladys) May 28, 2023\n\nBut that\u2019s not possible with NFTs migrated to Bitcoin via the BRC-721E process. As mentioned, it\u2019s a one-way journey, and the original NFT is essentially destroyed in the process.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe process may still prove appealing to Bitcoin aficionados, or perhaps NFT holders who believe that the buzzy rise of Ordinals will give their migrated NFT more value. However, there are potential risks to switching blockchains.\n\nFor example, back in February, a Bored Ape Yacht Club owner burned his original Ethereum NFT and minted a new version on Bitcoin via Ordinals. Soon after, one of the Bored Ape co-creators at Yuga Labs tweeted that the holder had \u201ceffectively given up\u201d the license to the myriad benefits and perks tied to Bored Ape NFT ownership.\n\nThe Ordinals protocol, launched in January, creates a way for people to \u201cinscribe\u201d digital media like artwork, PFPs, and even functional apps and games to the Bitcoin blockchain. Each \u201cdigital artifact\u201d is inscribed to a single satoshi, which is 1/100,000,000 of a full Bitcoin.\n\nMore than 10 million inscriptions have been made to date, with that milestone reached on Monday. The month began with just 3 million total inscriptions, and the latest surge has been fueled primarily by the rise of the BRC-20 standard, which uses Ordinals inscriptions to let users mint fungible tokens on Bitcoin\u2014such as meme tokens."

        "content": "Tue 30 May 2023 \u25aa 13 min of reading \u25aa by Satosh\n\nHyperbitcoinization is a concept that has been theorized by some of Bitcoin\u2019s most ardent supporters. It refers to a hypothetical state where Bitcoin would be universally accepted as currency. Is this truly credible, and what would be the consequences for the global economy?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s quest for world domination\n\nFor the past few years, an especially optimistic idea has been brewing within the Bitcoin community: hyperbitcoinization. It would be a state of adoption in which bitcoin is firmly established on a global scale, supplanting the US dollar as the new monetary standard.\n\nHyperbitcoinization scenario 1: Credible investment and unit of account\n\nIn the first scenario that can be imagined, bitcoin would be considered a reliable unit of account by a critical mass of individuals. In this scenario, Bitcoin would replace and even go beyond the gold standard. The asset would be accepted by numerous financial institutions, people would consider it a relatively stable investment (at least as stable as gold), and a reliable method for transferring money abroad.\n\nThis could happen after decades of slow adoption of Bitcoin, with ups and downs, without disrupting the social order. It doesn\u2019t require a fantastic imagination; it\u2019s a scenario that could naturally unfold over time.\n\nBut what does this mean for our economy? If Bitcoin becomes a reliable unit of account, it could have a significant impact on how we do business. International transactions could become simpler and more efficient. Individuals and businesses would have more control and sovereignty over their money.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that this hyperbitcoinization scenario doesn\u2019t mean that all transactions will be conducted in BTC. It\u2019s likely that fiat currencies will continue to play a significant role in the global economy.\n\nA few projections\n\nWe can envision some developments for Bitcoin within the framework of this first scenario. We can reasonably expect a reduction in Bitcoin\u2019s volatility but also an increase in transaction fees.\n\nIndeed, if the fees are not significantly higher, the network would be insecure. A malicious actor in one corner of the world could attempt to seize Bitcoin or launch a devastating attack to disrupt economies that have adopted it.\n\nHyperbitcoinization scenario 2: H-Bomb on the Fed\n\nLet\u2019s move on to the second hyperbitcoinization scenario.\n\nIn this scenario, Bitcoin\u2019s meteoric rise would lead to the creation of an economic regime in which any party that chooses not to use or is excluded from the Bitcoin network would be placed at an economic disadvantage. In this scenario, fiat currency would lose its luster. Gradually, the value of the dollar, euro, or British pound would converge towards zero. Why? Because they would become less desired by economic actors. When demand for an asset wanes, its price also plummets, all else being equal.\n\nFiat currencies still have power\n\nIt\u2019s important not to confuse the observation of a currency\u2019s inflation with its decline. Historically, inflation is a long-term structural observation, and it is expected to continue in the future. Nevertheless, major currencies like the dollar are by no means in decline. A one-dollar bill may be worth less than it was 20 years ago, but the dollar is more powerful than ever. The growth in the role of the dollar goes hand in hand with the volume of goods denominated in dollars, and there are undoubtedly more and more of them.\n\nTherefore, fiat currencies currently show no signs of decline, even if individual units are losing purchasing power due to central bank manipulations.\n\nThe H-Bomb Hyperbitcoinization scenario is only possible if nation-states voluntarily choose to relinquish their monetary power or, for some reason, lose their ability to issue fiat currencies.\n\nA slightly utopian scenario\n\nThis second scenario is therefore much more radical and controversial. It suggests that Bitcoin could not only fill the gaps of fiat currencies but completely replace them.\n\nThis means that those who don\u2019t adopt Bitcoin could find themselves economically disadvantaged. Just like if you were to do away with fiat currency today, you would likely face immense difficulties in receiving your salary or paying your electricity bills.\n\nVersion 2 of hyperbitcoinization requires the United States, China, the European Union, and other powerful economic entities to accept the helplessness caused by the loss of their monopoly over monetary production. Meanwhile, hundreds of trillions of dollars in value are absorbed by a headless protocol. Additionally, the rapid collapse of a fiat currency often constitutes a major disruption to the social order.\n\nThis (slightly utopian) scenario raises many questions. For example, how could such a situation come about? What could drive people to completely abandon their fiat currency in favor of Bitcoin? And what would be the effects on the global economy?\n\nA coalition of Bitcoin-Leading states?\n\nIn the context of this total conquest scenario, we have to consider a world in which Bitcoin is controlled by a central entity. This entity could be a coalition of powerful nations or large corporations. From this perspective, those who control Bitcoin would literally control the global economy. The incentives to form coalitions and take control of the network would be extremely high.\n\nHowever, even after a centralization event, we could expect market mechanisms to constrain the central validator to follow certain standards of behavior. For example, if the central validator becomes censorious or extortionate, Bitcoin would experience a depreciation in its value as users start losing trust and seeking alternatives. It\u2019s simply an application of game theory.\n\nA scalability issue\n\nThe Lightning Network is a second-layer solution for Bitcoin that enables instant and low-cost transactions. It\u2019s important to note that even in the case of hyperbitcoinization, the number of transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain would remain limited. The number of Lightning channels that can be created or closed is limited by the number of transactions on the blockchain.\n\nFor hyperbitcoinization to occur, the financial system would need to accommodate billions of users by adding additional scalability layers (Layers 2, Layers 3, and so on). At this stage, it\u2019s not clear how this could happen without financial institutions or states issuing digital debt acknowledgments (or even \u201cBitcoin paper\u201d) that are essentially fiat, with the degree of trust that comes with it and the ability to print more than the protocol allows.\n\nHyperbitcoinization and decentralization\n\nUnder the assumption of hyperbitcoinization that retains its decentralization attributes, certain properties would remain in place as they are today:\n\nMining remains decentralized, and no cartel forms to monopolize the network.\n\nMiners select transactions with the highest fee level and do not engage in censorship.\n\nWe could also expect the following:\n\nVolatility is reduced. To become a reliable unit of account, volatility must have decreased in terms of real purchasing power. Otherwise, people wouldn\u2019t use it as a unit of account.\n\nA significant portion of businesses would use it. The network would be well-established and far-reaching.\n\nThe total value would be much greater than today. If everyone uses it all the time, the demand would be incredibly high.\n\nThe total fee market should be significant. If the fee market isn\u2019t much larger, the network would be insecure.\n\nWhy would a state support Bitcoin?\n\nLet\u2019s recap the factors that could rationally motivate a state to adopt Bitcoin:\n\nPolicymakers believe that Bitcoin facilitates trade , perhaps because it offers a superior method for settling commercial transactions with foreign partners. However, in most domestic situations, Bitcoin doesn\u2019t add a significant advantage compared to the local currency.\n\n, perhaps because it offers a superior method for settling commercial transactions with foreign partners. However, in most domestic situations, Bitcoin doesn\u2019t add a significant advantage compared to the local currency. The state seeks to attract businesses or wealthy individuals to foster its economic development.\n\nto foster its economic development. Policymakers believe that the price of Bitcoin will increase significantly and would like the state\u2019s coffers to benefit from this rise. It\u2019s simply a form of speculation, as seen with the position taken by the President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele. Of course, the downside risk must also be taken into account. Even if it works over a certain period, it\u2019s not the same as building a sustainable growth model.\n\nIt\u2019s simply a form of speculation, as seen with the position taken by the President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele. Of course, the downside risk must also be taken into account. Even if it works over a certain period, it\u2019s not the same as building a sustainable growth model. The nation lacks a true sovereign currency and is at the mercy of central banks under external control (for example, consider the West African and Central African CFA francs).\n\n(for example, consider the West African and Central African CFA francs). A nation with liberal, democratic, and capitalist principles sees Bitcoin as a subversive means to introduce its anti-state values into the monetary production system.\n\nsees Bitcoin as a subversive means to introduce its anti-state values into the monetary production system. Policymakers are corrupt or selfish, and they might see Bitcoin as a way to enrich themselves. They could synchronize their own purchases or sales to anticipate policy changes that could affect BTC demand. For example, if a nation-state decides to acquire Bitcoin for the treasury, selfish officials could acquire massive amounts in the days preceding the announcement. Corrupt officials could also consider Bitcoin a reliable option for accepting bribes from foreign lobbyists.\n\nWhy would a state reject Bitcoin?\n\nLikewise, several factors could deter states from adopting the Bitcoin protocol:\n\nBitcoin: \u201ca speculative thing\u201d\n\nPolicymakers believe that Bitcoin is little more than a casino-like entity that drains resources from productive economic development. Moreover, it\u2019s an energy-intensive casino at a time of energy transition.\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s an casino at a time of Policymakers believe that the speculative cycle could leave behind a trail of toxic debts that would significantly harm the economy. While many stock market crashes are due to herd dynamics, a nation-state should also consider the possibility of an adversary orchestrating a malicious rugpull.\n\nNeutralizing the competition\n\nThe local sovereign currency fights inflation, and the addition of a fixed-supply competitor could exacerbate inflationary pressures. In general, economic policymakers pursue growth policies that maximize real growth and not just protect the value of their currency. However, if the value of the currency declines to the point where inflation hampers economic activity, policymakers would be wise to take measures to combat it. This could backfire. A ban on Bitcoin could be perceived as a desperate attempt to save a failing currency and push more citizens to hold BTC.\n\nPreserving monetary privilege\n\nThe nation-state would prefer economic growth to flow into their own currency rather than sharing wealth with international holders. They see their economy as more productive compared to other national economies. If domestic economic growth occurs within a Bitcoin economy, the network\u2019s purchasing power increases, enriching other parties that may or may not have contributed. Free-rider dynamics are not conducive to protecting one\u2019s own interests.\n\nThey see their economy as more productive compared to other national economies. If domestic economic growth occurs within a Bitcoin economy, the network\u2019s purchasing power increases, enriching other parties that may or may not have contributed. The nation-state benefits from using its own currency as an international reserve (notably the US and their exorbitant privilege, which allows them to borrow without bearing the real cost of such irresponsibility). Encouraging Bitcoin\u2019s growth risks losing this advantage.\n\nHyperbitcoinization is a fascinating concept that raises many questions about the future of our global economy. While the idea of universally accepted uncontrollable currency is appealing, there are still many hurdles to overcome before it becomes a reality. Regardless of what the future holds, even if hyperbitcoinization doesn\u2019t occur, it doesn\u2019t mean that Bitcoin lacks value. Bitcoin has already proven its worth as a censorship-resistant store of value. It has already changed the way we think about money and finance, and it will likely continue to do so in the years to come.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, new concepts and trends are continuously emerging, piquing the curiosity of both investors and crypto enthusiasts. One aspect attracting attention is the meteoric rise of cryptocurrency itself, particularly meme tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), and the eagerly anticipated Big Eyes Coin (BIG). The cryptocurrency community is now experiencing a level of excitement that has never been seen before.\n\nUnveiling The Cryptic Chessboard: Bitcoin\u2019s Fate Hangs In The Balance\n\nBitcoin markets showed modest gains as traders sought stability above $28,000, reaching a two-week high of over $28,450. Short-term profit-taking sentiment pushed the price lower to around $27,850. However, Bitcoin remained up about 10% from its recent low of $26,000 on May 25. The gains were fueled by optimism around the U.S. averting a default after an agreement to raise borrowing limits. The weakened U.S. dollar contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s rise, with a potential rally to $31,000 in June, representing a 10% increase from current levels.\n\nGlassnode\u2019s Checkmate study highlights the significant impact of short-term holders (STH) on Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory. Metrics like STH-MVRV, STH-SOPR, and profit/loss ratios are closely monitored. Inactive holders hinder price objectives, while active participation inspires confidence. STH\u2019s actions carry substantial influence, shaping the market. Analysts track these metrics diligently, expecting retracements in the 2023 bull market. Bitcoin bulls must showcase unwavering dedication to price increases. Ultimately, market players collectively shape Bitcoin\u2019s path forward.\n\nDogecoin\u2019s Meme Magic: From Viral Phenomenon To Bullish Potential\n\nThe original meme coin, Dogecoin, captivated the crypto community with its appeal to online culture and celebrity endorsements. It swiftly garnered popularity and a devoted group after being influenced by the well-known Doge meme. Dogecoin gained acceptance as a payment option on websites like Reddit and Twitch despite having little practical purpose.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen examining its recent activity, Dogecoin made a breakout from a bullish falling wedge but then retracted. A double-bottom pattern with significant buying pressure, however, formed and suggested probable bullishness. A positive short-term prognosis is further supported by the wave count and RSI readings. Fibonacci retracement levels indicate that $0.087 to $0.091 could act as resistance during a pullback. However, a price decline below $0.069 would continue the bearish trend and can result in a price of $0.050.\n\nBig Eyes Coin: Weaving Utility To Meme Coins\n\nBe prepared for an exciting show as Kitty Cuddlers gets ready for the highly anticipated Big Eyes Coin presale finale on June 3. As a result of the brave foray into the world of online casinos and P2E adventures that have enchanted the public, hearts are racing in anticipation of the grand launch on June 15, 2023. A gripping shift is coming for BIG with the thrilling return of the Stage 3 price of $0.00017. Everyone will be on the edge of their seats as a result of the frenzy of interest and anticipation this comeback will generate.\n\nThe ERC-20 cryptocurrency Big Eyes Coin emerges as a pioneer in the decentralized exchange (DEX) industry with its ground-breaking platform, BIG Swap. Prepare yourself for a tsunami of excitement. From the beginning, this innovative company has enchanted its customers with unique products like the captivating BIG Loot Box Trading Cards and alluring promo codes that promise a plethora of advantages. The meme coin has accomplished a great deal by raising an incredible $46 million during its initial coin offering (ICO) and is currently just $5.5 million away from meeting its audacious $51.5 million hard ceiling. The story of BIG has never ceased to enthrall and astound, igniting the passion of both investors and enthusiasts.\n\nBIG has established a vibrant, adorable community. BIG was able to successfully establish itself in the midst of the glut of Doge-themed meme coins, demonstrating to the world that we could carve out a unique niche for ourselves without following the crowd. Additionally, BIG has created its very own online BIG casino, which will exclusively benefit our devoted BIG holders.\n\nBig Eyes Coin will also grow to be a top Play-to-Earn project in the web3 and cryptocurrency sectors! In light of all of this, the moment has come to take advantage of this presale! There is no turning back now that $BIG could sell out at any second! Buy Big Eyes Coin immediately because once $BIG is gone, these low prices are never coming again!\n\nThe Final Say\n\nThe fate of Bitcoin remains uncertain, influenced by short-term holders and market dynamics. Dogecoin shows bullish potential, while Big Eyes Coin\u2019s presale finale sparks excitement in the decentralized exchange industry. The crypto world is brimming with anticipation and opportunity.\n\nFind out more about Big Eyes Coin (BIG) at:\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/BigEyesCoin/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BigEyesCoin"

        "content": "The cryptocurrency industry has once again captured the attention of investors and financial institutions as Bitcoin (BTC), the leading crypto by market cap, experienced a significant surge in value. In a surprising turn of events, JP Morgan, one of the largest investment banks, has acknowledged Bitcoin\u2019s potential by projecting a price of $45,000.\n\nMoreover, analysts are making bold predictions about Tradecurve (TCRV), a market disruptor currently in its presale phase, foreseeing a staggering 100x increase in value. Let\u2019s take a closer look at why.\n\n>>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW<<\n\nJP Morgan states Bitcoin (BTC) may soar to $45K\n\nAccording to JPMorgan analysts, given that many investors view the two assets as being interchangeable, the price of gold implies that Bitcoin (BTC) should be trading at a significant premium to where it is now trading.\n\nOn May 24th, the experts stated that Bitcoin would trade at about $45,000 in a message to clients. Currently, Bitcoin is trading hands at $26,698.92 with a market cap of $517B, which is a rise of 0.77% in the last 24 hours. This is about 40% less than the Bitcoin level that JP Morgan analysts predicted.\n\nAlso, analysts believe that the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which will take place next April or May, will also impact its price. This bullish outlook from JP Morgan represents a significant shift in the narrative surrounding Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nTradecurve (TCRV) could see a 100x increase after its launch\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s recent surge is grabbing headlines, analysts are turning their attention to Tradecurve , a rising presale star garnering significant interest. These analysts project an astonishing 100x increase in Tradecurve\u2019s value after its launch. Tradecurve, a decentralized trading platform built on the Ethereum blockchain, aims to revolutionize the online trading industry by providing a safe, private, and borderless trading environment.\n\nIts innovative features include a high leverage starting at 500:1, VIP account service, exclusive deposit bonuses, and a copy trading feature where users may subscribe to experienced traders and copy trades that they are doing. Another distinctive feature of Tradecurve that will significantly increase its chances of rivaling already established players such as Binance and Coinbase is that it will offer cryptocurrencies, stocks, forex, and commodities as trading options on a single account.\n\nMoreover, privacy will be at the forefront of Tradecurve as it eliminates all sign-up KYC checks. Users can just create an account using their email, connect it to a crypto wallet, and make a deposit \u2013 trading in complete anonymity. This fact positions Tradecurve as a vital player in the future of decentralized finance. Many individuals are now looking for privacy and security, which traditional trading platforms such as eToro and Crypto.com overlook.\n\nAt the core of this platform will be its utility token, TCRV, which is now in Stage 3 of its presale and has a value of just $0.015. Holding this token will give users governance voting rights, staking bonuses, and access to VIP levels. Analysts claim that the track record for these kinds of ICOs will give Tradecurve the edge. They point to the Huobi ICO, which began in 2018 for $1.25 but quickly reached its all-time high of $39.81.\n\nAnd given the distinctive features of Tradecurve and the fact that in April 2022, the value of transactions on the world\u2019s foreign exchange markets surpassed $7.5 trillion daily \u2013 the Tradecurve ICO has all the potential to reach the same or greater values as the Huobi ICO did.\n\nBecause of this, analysts predict a 50x increase for TCRV as the presale advances and a 100x rise when it gets listed on a major exchange such as Uniswap after its launch. Follow the links below and purchase this potential blue-chip token for a low price.\n\nFor more information about TCRV presale tokens:\n\nWebsite: https://tradecurve.io/\n\nBuy presale: https://app.tradecurve.io/sign-up\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/tradecurve_official\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "On Tuesday morning, Binance was selling one bitcoin for about $36,000, while local players BTC Markets, Independent Reserve and Bitpay were selling one bitcoin for about $42,000. The spread has been as wide as $14,000 last Friday, and as much as $9000 on Monday evening.\n\nASIC moves\n\nBinance has faced an increasingly difficult operating environment in Australia this year.\n\nLast month, Binance Australia\u2019s derivatives licence was cancelled by the Australian regulator which had been investigating operations at the Dubai-based exchange.\n\nBinance asked the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to cancel the licence, which the regulator\u2019s chairman, Joe Longo, suggested may have been because ASIC had \u201cfurther engagement planned\u201d.\n\nBinance is also facing legal action brought by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which sued the exchange earlier this year, along with its chief executive Changpeng Zhao, who is largely based in Dubai.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe regulator alleges Mr Zhao and another executive were operating an illegal exchange and a sham compliance program. The lawsuit also alleges Binance \u201cwillfully evaded\u201d US law as it solicited American customers for its derivatives business.\n\nBrisbane-based crypto broker Swyftx has long used Binance to facilitate the bulk of its liquidity for its 600,000 customers. But a spokesman said the inability of Binance to facilitate Australian dollar withdrawals would not affect operations at Swyftx.\n\nHe said customers deposited Australian dollars with the broker, which then converted them into US dollars before swapping them for bitcoin using Binance\u2019s international services, not the local one.\n\n\u201cWe were offering an [Australian dollar] onramp before Binance Australia came to the market and that\u2019ll continue,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nLocal crypto exchange Independent Reserve sources its liquidity from its own platform, connecting traders with each other rather than buying assets through a third party.\n\nBinance is fighting regulatory fires around the world. It was forced to discontinue operations in Canada earlier this month after the country issued a series of new guidelines for cryptocurrency exchanges including investor limits and mandatory registrations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Binance is the most high-profile exchange, the entire industry has been in the sights of regulators around the world, especially since the collapse of its rival, FTX, in November, which triggered a rout in digital coins.\n\nMore than $1 trillion was wiped from the industry\u2019s market value last year, and legislators and securities regulators are demanding tighter guidelines for disclosures on how the crypto companies operate and hold customer funds."

This phase is \u2018UP-ONLY\u2019 phase, which was test 3 times in $BTC history.\u201d\n\nHalving patterns\n\nIndeed, steady price climbs have both preceded and followed previous Bitcoin halvings, with the exception of a brief decline in 2020 caused by the Covid-19 pandemic but a recovery later on. If history repeats itself this time around, the analyst expects a price of about $50,000 around the halving event itself.\n\nAfter the halving, the maiden crypto asset should proceed with a further upward continuation in the following years, potentially even reaching the price of $200,000 in 2025, as the expert\u2019s chart analysis indicates.\n\nBitcoin chart pattern around halvings.

        "title": "How to Get The Best Profits from Top Bitcoin Mining Pools - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Bitcoin mining pools are groups of Bitcoin miners who join forces to combine their computing power and increase their chances of successfully mining Bitcoin. In the Bitcoin network, miners compete to solve complex mathematical problems to validate and add new transactions to the blockchain, and they are rewarded with newly minted Bitcoins for their efforts.\n\nMining pools allow individuals who do solo mining to pool their resources and work together as a team. When a pool member successfully mines a block, the reward is distributed among the participants based on their contribution to the mining process. By joining a mining pool, miners can receive more frequent and consistent payouts compared to mining individually, where the probability of mining a block is lower due to the increased competition.\n\nBitcoin Mining pool typically uses a reward distribution method called \u201cproportional\u201d or \u201cpay-per-share.\u201d In proportional mining, the reward is divided among participants based on the number of shares they contributed to finding a block. Pay-per-share (PPS) pools offer a fixed payout for each share submitted by miners, regardless of whether a block is found. This provides a stable income for miners but may have higher fees compared to proportional pools.\n\nOverall, mining pools are a collaborative approach to Bitcoin mining, allowing miners to combine their computational resources and increase their chances of earning Bitcoin rewards.\n\nUnderstanding the Mechanisms of Pool Reward Splitting\n\nIt\u2019s important to comprehend shares before talking about the mining pools\u2019 reward schemes.\n\nBy using shares, pool owners can determine each miner\u2019s contribution to the pool. Shares are allotted to miners in proportion to their contribution to the pool as a whole.\n\nMiners can receive compensation from the pool through shares based on their contribution. Be aware that shares are undetectable. They are essentially merely phrases that pool managers use to decide how much to pay pool participants; they have no practical worth.\n\nAccepted shares and rejected shares are two categories for shares. Accepted shares are contributions made to a pool round. A miner\u2019s payback increases with the number of shares they give throughout a round. Shares that have been rejected are works that don\u2019t help uncover new cryptocurrencies. They receive no payment.\n\nTherefore, mining pools may choose from any of the following payment methods depending on the share amount:\n\nPay-Per-Share (PPS)\n\nMiners receive shares under the PPS model, which can be paid at any moment throughout the hashing process. PPS allows miners to be compensated for valid shares supplied, independent of whether or not a block was solved during their participation.\n\nThe pool operators will pay miners from their balance to make payments. Share prices are set here, and miners are frequently informed in advance.\n\nPPS+ awards are a new form of PPS rewards. This solution effectively runs the PPS mechanism alongside the TX fees provided in the block. These TX fees are dispersed in the form of PPLNs (more on this later). The PPS + rewards method decreases the possibility of miners not being rewarded for their contributions to pools.\n\nSadly, there is a drawback to this plan. In order to cover their risks, pool operators typically charge large fees.\n\nProportional\n\nThis approach distributes awards to members according to their respective shares of the pool\u2019s total shares. The Proportional reward operates in this manner. The more shares you can purchase, the more computer power you have, and the longer you mined to obtain the block.\n\nScore-Based\n\nThe goal of the score-based payment system was to minimize pool hopping. Your computing power and mining time are calculated by pool operators in this case, and they combine them to produce a \u201cscoring hash rate\u201d score.\n\nTherefore, the longer you participate, the better your score will be and the value of the shares you receive will increase. When you stop mining, both your score and the value of your shares decrease. Miners are paid when they discover a block.\n\nPay Per Last N Shares (PPLNS)\n\nOnly during a predefined \u201cwindow,\u201d which closes with the securing of a block, do miners in PPLNS receive payment for the shares allotted to them.\n\nShares owned outside of this timeframe do not receive rewards, unlike other payment plans. In this plan, windows could be described as a period of time or as a specific number (N) that indicates the miner\u2019s most recent share allocation up until the block\u2019s solution.\n\nOnly the final billion shares, for instance, will be compensated when a block is discovered if N equals 1 billion. If N isn\u2019t defined, it\u2019s often set as a constant and a multiple of mining difficulty.\n\nWith PPLNS, miners can either receive no incentives if they do not receive any shares within the range, or they can receive higher payments if they obtain more shares in the most recent N shares.\n\n7 Best Bitcoin Mining Pools\n\nIt is best to join a Bitcoin mining pool that rewards miners with the highest hash rate when you have the best and most recent mining hardware for that algorithm and cryptocurrency. Otherwise, if you have an out-of-date device with a low hash rate, your chances of winning rewards or having your hash rate accepted are less favorable.\n\nF2Pool\n\nBeing among the best mining pools for mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, F2Pool began its mining operation in 2013. The pool can be used for merged mining, which is the process of mining several cryptocurrencies on various blockchains. Free money can also be obtained by mining Bitcoin using a pool.\n\nThe fact that F2Pool supports mining in various cryptocurrencies is one of its biggest advantages. These consist of Litecoin, Ether, and ZCash. The payout threshold for the pool\u2019s daily automatic payout is 0.005 BTC, nevertheless.\n\nWith an 18.26% share of the overall Bitcoin mining pool hash rate, it is now the largest Bitcoin mining pool.\n\nFeatures:\n\nOver 1,000,000 pieces of mining equipment from across the world are used to host mining for users. There are numerous more pools for cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, such as Eth, Litecoin, BCH, Ravencoin, Ravencoin Classic, 40 proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, and so on. Mining activities may be tracked using mobile apps for iOS and Android. Payouts can be customized.\n\nBTC pool hash rate: 30.60 EH/s\n\nPayout thresholds: A minimum of 0.005 BTC is required to receive daily rewards.\n\nPayment method: PPS+ (Pay Per Share+).\n\nFees: 2.5% of your rewards will be deducted as commission.\n\nPEGA Pool\n\nLike other mining pools, PEGA is among the best Bitcoin mining pool in terms of revenue per TH in profitability.\n\nPEGA Pool is an eco-friendly Bitcoin mining pool situated in the United Kingdom. PEGA Pool has the industry\u2019s greatest revenue per TH.\n\nIt is open to all miners, large and small, and charges 1% for miners who use renewable energy and 2% for miners who use non-renewable energy. PEGA Pool reduces the carbon footprint of miners who use nonrenewable energy by planting trees; to date, 222,671 trees have been planted, offsetting 5,930 tonnes of CO2.\n\n. https://twitter.com/PEGA_Pool/status/1659169706492719105\n\nFeatures:\n\nUK-based\n\nMost revenue per TH\n\nEco-friendly, with miners who use renewable energy sources receiving a 1% charge.\n\nReliable Bitcoin mining pool infrastructure strategically located in key places throughout the world to provide consistent uptime and availability.\n\nAn interface that is simple to use\n\nExcellent live chat assistance\n\nBTC Pool Hashrate: 2.97EH/s\n\nPayout limits: 0.005 BTC\n\nPayment method: FPPS\n\nFee: 1% if renewable energy is used. 2% rely on nonrenewable energy sources.\n\nSlush Pool\n\nOne of the largest and oldest Zcash and Bitcoin mining pools, Slush Pool has over 15,000 users mining Bitcoin and 760 users mining Zcash.\n\nIn Europe, the USA, Canada, Singapore, Japan, and Russia, the company operates mining pool servers for Bitcoin and Zcash.

You can use it to mine BCH, LTC, ETH, ETC, ZEC, and DASH, among many other cryptocurrencies and tokens in addition to Bitcoin.\n\nThe default minimum payout for Bitcoin mining is anything above 0.001 BTC, and the daily profit per Terra hash is $0.3405. A multi-crypto mining pool, that is.\n\nFeatures\n\nPool Size: Medium\n\nBTC pool hash rate: 30.5EH/s\n\nPool fee: 4% for PPS+ & 0% for PPLNS\n\nMinimum payout threshold: 0.005 BTC\n\nPayout Frequency: Daily\n\nSupported Platforms: PC, Web, iOS, Android\n\nPoolin\n\nFeature\n\nThe mining pool has 2,358,175 total workers that are now mining BTC, but it also gives customers the option to mine 10 other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, it gives each miner\u2019s price, hash rate, power usage, 24-hour revenue, and other information, as well as a clear miner profitability ranking.\n\nPool Size: Large\n\nBTC pool hash rate: 23.59 EH/s\n\nPool fee: 2.5% FPPS\n\nMinimum payout threshold: 0.005 BTC\n\nPayout Frequency: Daily\n\nSupported Platforms: PC, Web, iOS, Android\n\nBTC.com\n\nAnother venerable mining pool that is still popular today is BTC.com. It has characteristics like the FPPS and PP+ sub-categories that Antpool has. Bitmain, the business that created the Antminer ASICS, manages the mining pool.\n\nIt offers clear ranking statistics on which users are mining which tokens, as well as information on their power usage, hash rates, electricity costs, fee ratios, daily profits, and 24-hour returns.\n\nFeatures\n\nFor tracking mining activity and statistics, there are apps for Android and iOS in addition to the web app.\n\nSupport for multi-currency mining.\n\nTerra Hash\u2019s daily earnings are $0.32.\n\n13.630 EH/s is the Bitcoin mining hash rate.\n\nProfits should be distributed according to the preset earning proportion to various addresses.\n\nPool Size: Large\n\nBTC pool hash rate: 12.810 EH/s\n\nPool fee: 4%\n\nMinimum payout threshold: 0.005 BTC\n\nPayout Frequency: Daily\n\nSupported Platforms: PC, Web, iOS, Android\n\nVia BTC\n\nWith 16,400 active workers, ViaBTC is one of the top largest mining pools in the world, accounting for 11.44% of the entire BTC mining hash rate. Additionally, it enables mining for Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and more than ten other cryptocurrencies. Weather-related pricing variations are available for its mining farms, but there are also solutions with yearly price stability.\n\nYou can mine utilizing cloud hash rates, ASICs, CPUs, and GPUs. At 20422.07 PH/s, it has the fourth-highest hash rate of all mining pools.\n\nFeatures\n\nMultiple-currency wallet.\n\nMultiple-currency pool.\n\ntrade for many cryptocurrencies.\n\nCoinEx Smart Chain and decentralized exchange.\n\nHedging and borrowing in cryptocurrencies.\n\nmining and cloud hash rate trading.\n\nDaily profit from mining one tera hash of bitcoin is $0.319.\n\nPool Size: Medium\n\nBTC pool hash rate: 20.32EH/s\n\nPool fee: 4% for PPS & 2% for PPLNS Payment Method\n\nMinimum payout threshold: 0.001 BTC\n\nPayout Frequency: Daily\n\nSupported Platforms: PC, Web, iOS, Android\n\nConclusion\n\nThe best mining pools for Bitcoin are those that handle various cryptocurrencies and have auto-switching algorithms. The payment options are something else you should look into, and the majority of the pools on this list let you select from a variety of options.\n\nThe lowest possible fees should be taken into account as well. The possibility of zero-fee mining with Slush Pool\u2019s proprietary Braiins OS software should be taken into consideration.\n\nThe majority of the options on the list let you connect CPUs, GPUs, ASICs, or rental hash rates, but none of them offer Bitcoin mining on smartphones.\n\nJoining mining pools like Kano Pools, which emphasize ASICs, makes it more difficult for you to gain shares if you are using a CPU or GPU. Other cryptocurrency pools use varying difficulty algorithms to distribute challenging tasks among stronger and weaker miners, respectively. This offers a reasonable opportunity to get rewarded in the mining pool."
