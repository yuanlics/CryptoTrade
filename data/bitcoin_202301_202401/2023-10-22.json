        "content": "The price of bitcoin rose to start the week, extending gains from the previous week helped by optimism about a bitcoin exchange-traded fund and a flight to safety.\n\nBitcoin was trading about 5% higher at $31,384.51, according to Coin Metrics, and coming off its best week since June. It has touched $30,000 at several points in 2023 but has struggled to sustain that level or move meaningfully higher with the U.S. regulatory crackdown on crypto weighing on liquidity and trading volumes.\n\nInvestors are expecting the approval of a bitcoin ETF to change that between the end of the year and the first half of 2024. Several firms have also amended their filings in the past couple weeks to address earlier concerns by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which investors are taking as a positive sign that the agency is engaging positively with the firms."

        "title": "US Federal Government Holds Massive Bitcoin Stash Amidst Price Rocket - Nasdaq",
        "content": "New data shows how the federal government has accumulated billions of dollars worth of bitcoins over the years. As it plans and executes more sophisticated sales worth hundreds of millions, bitcoiners consider its influence as a major whale.\n\nBy Landon Manning\n\nFrom years of various seizures and confiscations, the U.S. government has become one of the world\u2019s largest holders of Bitcoin, with its 200k bitcoin worth more than $5 billion.\n\nThroughout the many years of Bitcoin\u2019s ascendancy into a worldwide phenomenon, its millions of supporters have had extremely diverse backgrounds and viewpoints, even as they have all been united in the pursuit of a worldwide decentralized currency. Among this cohort, naturally, there have been a few criminals. Even now in October 2023, new details are still coming to light about the prosecution of Bitcoin-related crimes that took place more than a decade ago. Jimmy Zhong, who was finally sentenced to prison this year, was convicted of stealing some 50k bitcoin from the now-defunct Silk Road in 2012. The government has long since confiscated his bitcoin, but many of them essentially remained frozen as the legal battle proceeded. Obviously, during a decade, this bitcoin has accumulated tremendous value.\n\nIt must be remembered, however, that this particular example is one of many, and a very early one at that. Over the years, it has come to light that the federal government has accumulated a massive stockpile of bitcoin, approximately 200,000. It seems that the presence of red tape has been a surprising aid in profit for the government\u2019s \u201cinvestment\u201d, as lengthy trials have only led to a complicated asset liquidation process. In short, it costs the government nothing to keep these bitcoin in the wallet of an incarcerated person, or else hold them directly, often for years at a time. All the while, growth for Bitcoin has been rocketing at unbelievable rates. Jared Koopman, executive director of the IRS\u2019s cyber and forensics services section, denied any deliberate strategy when he claimed to the Wall Street Journal that \u201cWe don\u2019t play the market. We basically are set by the timing in our process\u201d.\n\nThat may be the case so far, but the way that the government has sought to profit off of this bitcoin has grown more sophisticated over the years. For example, federal agencies would initially sell these coins at an auction to interested buyers, selling confiscated coins tens of thousands at a time in 2014. However, since a pilot attempt by the Marshals Service in 2021, they have switched to directly selling on exchanges. Even as the government paid service fees that were derided as extortionary, it has still netted hundreds of millions from its repeated sales, with no sign of stopping. In a particular irony, one federal agency can even use an exchange to sell off these assets, while a different agency can open a lawsuit against it soon after! If this dynamic was abused, it could create a tidy revenue stream.\n\nIt\u2019s in this light that the bitcoin community has been asking itself one question: What happens if the US government enters the space in a more major way? Obviously, federal agencies have no interest in practically adopting a currency that is in any way free of state control. El Salvador famously is the only world nation to accept bitcoin as legal tender, and part of the motivation for this move was explicitly to undermine the hegemony of the dollar. Although the United States may not believe in the mission of Bitcoin, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that it is currently one of the largest whales in existence. And whales, historically, have had a tremendous impact on bitcoin\u2019s price fluctuations.\n\nJust consider the state of the markets today, and a simple thought experiment. What would it look like if the federal government started acting more deliberately like a Bitcoin whale, maximizing its gains and attempting directly to influence the price of its assets? By making its liquidation process more sophisticated, it has already made the first step in becoming a robust bitcoin-selling machine. And the market these days is active and volatile, full of opportunities to act. For example, as bitcoin miners worldwide have been preparing for the next halving, Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate has been exploding for more than a year. Even now, it continues to reach new heights of productivity.\n\nSource\n\nAll these miners have been preparing for the halving, consolidating and modernizing their equipment and facilities while even preparing political efforts. And in this ecosystem, the government has planned to sell off assets worth hundreds of billions. How many individuals controlling these sales would really be necessary to take some deliberate action? How difficult would it really be, when the halving sends shockwaves through the entire space, for a federal agency to make a few big sales that cause a crisis of confidence? Even if it sells at a loss relative to 2024\u2019s prices, these will dwarf the massive gains these assets have gained over the years. More to the point, the government has sat on these assets for years at a time! A prolonged bear market could push firms all over the world to the absolute brink, and federal agencies already are fighting legal battles against some of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchanges. If assets were seized in the middle of a bigger collapse, the government could sit on them for years, and see astronomical gains.\n\nThe government would also have options to see the continued rise of Bitcoin in the immediate future, too. In the prolonged fight to win regulatory approval for a Bitcoin ETF, the community is generally convinced that the victory is close at hand. The SEC\u2019s arguments against the ETF have failed to convince the U.S. Court of Appeals, and the markets have been salivating. The mere rumor of regulatory success has led bitcoin to appreciate several thousand dollars in value in a few days, and the actual approval will be an explosion. What would happen if these approvals became more common? It wouldn\u2019t take a true Bitcoiner, only someone convinced that a growing industry will help America. A few years ago, it was unimaginable that those seized assets would be worth billions some day. What could we imagine for the future?\n\nThe purpose of this hypothetical has not been to seriously make the case that a massive reorientation towards Bitcoin will take place. Even if the value of this bitcoin hoard were doubled, ten billion dollars is small change compared to the U.S.\u2019 GDP of $23 trillion. However, anyone in this space should appreciate the sheer power that exists when the buying and selling power of a whale is combined with the power to materially put a thumb on the scale. How many people would it really take? If someone with power at one of these federal agencies wished to carry out a deliberate plan, how hard would it really be? Even if a functionary earns the same salary whether the bitcoin sell at a high price or a low, they would certainly be interested in winning as many cases against \u201ccrypto criminals\u201d as possible. And all those criminals would see their assets added to the pile.\n\nIn short, the main concern is that the existence of sums of money like this is an organizing principle all in itself. The federal government holds massive power, when considering its ability to wage war or impact global trade. But the economic stakes of Bitcoin hold huge power as well, the power to sway people at all levels of these bureaucracies. For a normal whale, selling hundreds of millions would be a very dramatic event, intended to ripple out across the whole space. But for this particular whale, it\u2019s only a scheduled liquidation in a long backlog of government property. It would only take a little pushing to make ripples of their own. Nobody involved would have to truly believe in replacing the dollar, or a trustless world economy. They\u2019d just have to understand that the rise of Bitcoin, so far, has been very good for business.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Is cryptocurrency helping Hamas fund terrorism? - FRANCE 24 English",
        "content": "Financing 2.0\n\nThe US and Israel have stepped up their efforts to limit cryptocurrency transfers to Hamas since the group\u2019s brutal October 7 attacks on Israel. Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Ethereum are increasingly blamed as conduits of funding for Islamist groups, but to what extent is this justified?\n\nVirtual wallets containing tens of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency suspected of funding Hamas have been seized by Israel.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nIn the wake of Hamas\u2019s attacks on Israeli territory on October 7 that were unprecedented in scale, the role of digital currencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin and crypto exchange platforms in financing the radical Islamist movement are increasingly under scrutiny.\n\nOn October 19, the US Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) proposed new regulations identifying \u201cConvertible Virtual Currency Mixing (CVC mixing) as a class of transactions of primary money laundering concern \u2026 to combat its use by malicious actors including Hamas [and] Palestinian Islamic Jihad\u201d.\n\nThese online services, known more casually as \u201cmixers\u201d or \u201ctumblers\u201d, mix cryptocurrency of illicit origin with other cryptocurrency funds. As such, \u201cthe risk of employing crypto mixers to launder money or conceal earnings is pretty considerable\u201d, acknowledges crypto industry news site Cointelegraph.\n\nAppeals for Bitcoin via Facebook, Instagram and Telegram\n\nIn the wake of the October 7 assault, the Israeli defence ministry claimed it had seized virtual wallets linked to Hamas that had received $41 million (\u20ac39 million) between 2019 and 2023. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, for its part, has raised $94 million (\u20ac89 million) in cryptocurrency in recent years, according to Elliptic, a British firm that analyses virtual currency transactions.\n\nAnd that's not all. Washington also decided on October 18 to sanction \"Buy Cash\", a Gaza-based company accused of \"facilitating\" cryptocurrency transfers to Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\n\n\"Hamas\u2019s use of crypto first came to light in January 2019,\" writes David Carlisle, co-founder of Elliptic, in a blog post published on October 11. The al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas\u2019s armed wing, was caught red-handed while organising a call for Bitcoin donations via Facebook and Instagram.\n\nAt first, these \"funding 2.0\" initiatives only raised a few thousand dollars, but Hamas has increasingly used social networks as funding channels ever since. And the Palestinian group formally listed as a terrorist organisation by the EU and the US is not alone in its actions. \"Using crypto in conjunction with social media platforms \u2013 Facebook, Instagram, and I've seen Telegram mentioned recently \u2013 has become quite popular,\" says Nicholas Ryder, a professor of law and specialist in terrorist financing networks at Cardiff University.\n\nThe recent attention paid to funds transferred to Hamas in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may give the impression that without this windfall, the Islamist movement would be bankrupt or would, at least, have had a much harder time financing its attacks on Israel.\n\nSecondary means\n\n\"There is a degree of hyperbole about this topic. It\u2019s relatively new, has cachet and is unknown by many people, so of course it attracts attention. You cannot ignore it, but if you think about the pros and cons of [using it for] raising or moving funds, crypto is not the best,\" says Tom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Financial Crime Research and Security Studies at the Royal United Service Institute, one of the UK's leading think tanks on security issues.\n\nFor example, Hamas, which Forbes magazine ranked in 2014 as \"one of the richest terrorist groups in the world\", has an estimated annual budget of nearly $1 billion. Most of the money comes from \"expatriates or private donors in the Gulf region\", points out German news channel Deutsche Welle.\n\nIn this respect, the $41 million in cryptocurrencies seized by the Israeli authorities may seem like a drop in the bucket for Hamas. What\u2019s more, these amounts should be taken with a grain of salt: it can be very difficult to separate funds intended to finance terrorist activities from others in a virtual wallet, Chainalysis, an American blockchain analysis company, notes in a blog post.\n\n\"[It\u2019s] impossible to quantify how much money is transferred via crypto, but it has become a more and more prominent funding method,\" says Ryder.\n\nThe rise of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin in the world of terrorism can be explained first and foremost by the simplicity of making a transaction, notes Keatinge: \"It's easy, and I can make a donation from my couch at home.\" It's also much quicker than having to open a bank account and find intermediaries willing to transfer the fund. \"You just need a smartphone and/or a laptop,\" adds Ryder.\n\nInternational authorities are also putting more effort into countering traditional terrorist financing channels, so these groups are trying to compensate with new ways of raising money. \u201cThe more we put pressure on traditional ways of financing, the more they\u2019ll find alternative ways like crypto. And we are becoming better at fighting against the traditional means of financing. It's like a balloon: when you squeeze one part, the other gets bigger,\" says Keatinge.\n\nNot so anonymous\n\nHamas, al Qaeda and Hezbollah don't hesitate to combine the best of both worlds, either. For example, there can now be a cryptocurrency dimension to the use of fake NGOs, a classic means of funding for terrorist groups. \"They can cut the top 10 to 15 percent and convert it into crypto, and then transfer it in order to make it more difficult to trace,\" explains Ryder.\n\nHowever, these movements' interest in such new funding methods is not as strong as current media noise might suggest, because they are not ultimately as anonymous as we\u2019ve been led to believe. \"It may seem as though crypto is some kind of secret way to channel funds, but it has vulnerability. As soon as you start blockchain transactions, they are traceable. They\u2019re not as secretive as many people think,\" says Keatinge.\n\nIndeed, all Bitcoin transactions pass through the blockchain, which is the digital equivalent of a ledger that is accessible to all. Admittedly, the names of those transferring or receiving the funds do not appear, but it is possible to track every movement of funds, and companies such as Chainalysis and Elliptic have become masters in the art of tracing their origin.\n\nOf course, there are ways of making these transactions more anonymous, but they come at the expense of ease and speed \u2013 the main advantages of the use of cryptocurrencies for terrorists and other criminals. In the end, it\u2019s still easier and more anonymous to hand-deliver suitcases full of cash.\n\nThis article is a translation of the original in French.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe"

        "content": "Wall Street giant Morgan Stanley believes that crypto winter is over, and Bitcoin\u2019s next halving will kick off a new bull run as it has in the past.\n\nIn a recent report titled \u201cWill Crypto Spring Ever Come?\u201d the bank\u2019s wealth management division delved into the four-year cryptocurrency cycle and the significance of Bitcoin\u2019s halving events on market cycles in shaping the crypto landscape.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Denny Galindo \u2014 author of the report \u2014 wrote:\n\n\u201cSigns indicate that \u2018crypto winter\u2019 \u2014 bitcoin\u2019s cyclical bear-market decline \u2014 may be in the past.\u201d\n\nThe Four Seasons of Crypto\n\nGalindobegan by drawing a parallel between the four-year cryptocurrency cycle and the year\u2019s four seasons. He detailed the four distinct phases of the cryptocurrency cycle, with each phase bearing a resemblance to a season:\n\nAccording to the report, the summer phase commences with the highly anticipated halving event, where the rate of new Bitcoin creation is slashed in half.\n\nHistorically, this phase has been marked by substantial price increases in Bitcoin, as scarcity drives demand. It typically culminates when Bitcoin surpasses its previous all-time high, sparking euphoria in the market.\n\nAfter reaching a new high, Bitcoin garners media attention, attracts new investors, and piques the interest of businesses. This phase is reminiscent of summer, turning into fall as the crypto market basks in the warmth of renewed interest. It spans the period between surpassing the old high and establishing a new peak, marking the climax of the bull market.\n\nPost-peak, the market enters a bearish phase, similar to the onset of winter. The market cools down as investors lock in profits and divest from Bitcoin.\n\nThis phase has historically persisted for around 13 months, with prices experiencing significant declines from their highs. It is a time of consolidation, correction, and introspection for the crypto community.\n\nPreceding each halving event, Bitcoin\u2019s price generally rebounds from its lowest point. However, investor enthusiasm tends to remain relatively subdued, much like the cautious optimism of early spring.\n\nThis is the period when the crypto market finds its footing again, preparing for the next halving event and the subsequent bull run. Galindo highlighted that there have been three crypto winters since 2011, each spanning roughly 13 months. He also noted that Bitcoin\u2019s halving event plays a significant role in driving the value of the flagship crypto.\n\nAccording to Galindo:\n\n\u201cHistorically, most of bitcoin\u2019s gains come directly after a \u2018halving\u2019 event that occurs every four years.\u201d\n\nThis observation lends credence to the notion that a crypto spring may be on the horizon.\n\nSigns of Spring\n\nThe report said there are several key factors to consider in determining whether crypto spring has arrived. Historical patterns reveal that the trough of Bitcoin in previous crypto winters typically surfaces about 12 to 14 months after the peak, offering a timeline for market cycles.\n\nAnother crucial factor is gauging the decline in Bitcoin\u2019s value from its all-time high. Bitcoin prices have plummeted by approximately 83% from their previous highs in past crypto winters.\n\nMiner capitulation is also a noteworthy indicator, as many miners cease operations due to financial losses when Bitcoin approaches the trough of past cycles. Miner behavior is monitored through \u201cbitcoin difficulty,\u201d a metric gauging mining ease. Decreasing difficulty signifies proximity to the trough.\n\nThe \u201cBitcoin Price-to-Thermocap Multiple\u201d is another critical metric. \u201cThermocap\u201d measures the total investment in Bitcoin since its inception. A lower price-to-thermocap ratio indicates a trough, while a higher ratio suggests a peak in the market\u2019s trajectory.\n\nThe report added that price action can also signify the end or beginning of a new cycle. A substantial 50% increase in Bitcoin\u2019s price from its lowest point typically indicates a trough.\n\nHowever, there have been instances where significant price declines followed such gains."

        "title": "Will the SEC Finally Approve a Spot Bitcoin ETF? - Nasdaq",
        "content": "The price of Bitcoin today (^BTCUSD) rose more than +4% to a 3-1/4 month high on speculation the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may be close to approving the first U.S. exchange-traded-funds (ETFs) investing directly into spot Bitcoin. Asset managers BlackRock and Fidelity Investment are among the fund managers in the race to offer a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S., which could spark new inflows into the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe SEC has so far resisted approving spot Bitcoin ETFs, citing risks such as fraud and market manipulation. However, the SEC recently indicated that it won\u2019t appeal an August court ruling that may pave the way for the $18.4 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to convert to an ETF. Bloomberg Intelligence said, \u201capproval of a spot Bitcoin ETF looks inevitable\u201d and that several funds are likely to be given the green light, although the exact timing remains uncertain.\n\nBitcoin has rallied +87% this year, easily beating the 44% gain in the MarketVectorTM Digital Assets Index, a market cap-weighted index that tracks the performance of the 100 largest digital assets. According to CoinGecko, Bitcoin accounts for almost 50% of the $1.2 trillion digital asset market. Other cryptocurrencies are also moving higher, with Ethereum (^ETHUSD) up more than +4% today at a 3-week high. The \u201cCrypto is Now\u201d newsletter said, \u201cAs Bitcoin moves gather steam, traders are concerned the rest of the cryptocurrency market might follow,\u201d so traders are moving to covered short positions.\n\nIn addition to worries about liquidity and market manipulation, the SEC has expressed concern that Bitcoin\u2019s volatility might be too much for ordinary investors. Bitcoin\u2019s last three full-year returns were gains of +305% in 2020, up another +60% in 2021, followed by a loss of -64% in 2022. The SEC has also questioned whether funds would have the information necessary to adequately value tokens like Bitcoin, including whether they can validate who owns the underlying coins. SEC Chairman Gensler has said that the lack of regulatory oversight and surveillance in crypto markets has led to \u201cconcerns about the potential for fraud and manipulation.\u201d\n\nLong-term market investor confidence in Bitcoin appears to have improved recently. Data from intoTheBock shows a sizable increase in long-term Bitcoin holdings, as 80% of circulating Bitcoin has not been moved from investor digital wallets in the last six months. The continuous accumulation of Bitcoin is a positive factor behind the recent strength in cryptocurrency despite a series of turbulent market events.\n\nSome experts expect SEC approval of at least one spot Bitcoin ETF by the end of the year. However, uncertainty remains as there have been nearly 30 prior attempts by asset managers that failed to persuade the SEC to give them a chance to start a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nMore Stock Market News from Barchart\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Bitcoin on Monday was trading at over $30,700 in the international market. The most popular cryptocurrency saw a spike of 58 percent in the past one year, reinvigorating a hope that was fast eroding among the crypto investors worldwide.\n\nThe price is over 98 percent higher than the 52-week low of $15,480, and is within the kissing distance of the 52-week high of $31,809.\n\nFollowing the lead of bitcoins, other cryptocurrencies have risen significantly in the past few months. For instance, Ethereum traded at $1,674, over 50 percent higher than 52-week low of $1,072.\n\nView Full Image Bitcoin spiked 58% in the past one year\n\nRipple traded at $0.53, 72 percent higher than 52-week low of $0.3011. Solana traded at $29.53, over 2.5 times higher than the 52-week low of $8. Binance Coin traded at $221, significantly higher than the 52-week low of $202.9. And the list goes on.\n\nThere is no doubt that cryptocurrencies are infamous for extreme volatility. So, what is high today may be low tomorrow, and vice versa.\n\n\u201cShort-term price swings keep happening and getting carried away by upswings and grappling in fear during downturns does more harm than good to long-term investing. Having an education-first approach is an essential cornerstone for sustainable long-term wealth creation,\" says Rahul Pagidipati, CEO, ZebPay.\n\nWhy the spike?\n\nAmong several positive developments for cryptocurrencies, the key one is building of broader consensus among G20 nations about adopting the broader contours of regulatory framework proposed by Financial Stability Board (FSB) and IMF.\n\n\"A false report by a media house suggesting BlackRock\u2019s Spot BTC ETF approval led to an instant spike in BTC purchases soaring prices by $3k in 30 minutes, only to reverse the entire gains in the next half hour as more clarity emerged. However, since then, BTC has decoupled from other \u2018risk on\u2019 assets and has been inching towards $30k levels,\" says Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures.\n\n\u201cThe recent surge in Bitcoin prices appears to be fuelled by strategic efforts from individuals and organizations with vested interests, aiming to rekindle interest from both existing and potential participants in the adoption pyramid,\" says Gaurav Mehta, Co-Founder and CEO of Catax- Simple Crypto Taxes.\n\n\"Bitcoin as a crucial aspect in the emerging financial system has been recognised globally. It\u2019s only a matter of time before it not just becomes an investment option but also a transaction tool. We have witnessed high price fluctuations and volatility in the market before but with widespread adoption, the Crypto market will gain more legitimacy and trust,\" says Rajagopal Menon, Vice President of WazirX.\n\nThe Government of India last year imposed 30 percent capital gains tax and one percent TDS on crypto transactions, thus implicitly acknowledging the prevalence of trading in these assets. That was seen as a step towards a full-fledged regulatory framework for assets linked through blockchain.\n\nFocus on fundamentals\n\nThe industry insiders believe that this is seemingly a positive development and digital currencies are now coming of age, and the wild movements are gradually becoming a thing of the past. At the same time, they argue that not much must be deduced from the crypto\u2019s price movement, and investors should educate themselves first about the technology.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has always been and will continue to be an incredibly resilient asset with remarkable economic potential. Rather than timing the market and deciding the best time to invest, it is essential to focus on the fundamentals, conduct thorough due diligence, and invest based on one\u2019s financial goals,\" adds Zebpay\u2019s Rahul.\n\n\u201cUpon closer examination of the fundamentals, numerous crypto businesses are facing financial challenges, governments are intensifying regulatory measures, and from a technical standpoint, there are many alternative cryptocurrencies that outperform Bitcoin in terms of efficiency, speed, and environmental impact,\" adds Catax\u2019s Mehta.\n\nSo, it is advisable to apply the conventional rules of investing in cryptocurrencies as well, and one should focus on the fundamentals of blockchain technology before intending to invest instead of waiting for the next swing to take place.\n\nMilestone Alert!

Today\u2019s rally that took prices to a three-month high is not about spot Bitcoin ETF optimism but about a significant reversal in the dollar and 10-year Treasury yield. Bitcoin could continue to rally if investors continue expect risk appetite prefers risky assets over Treasuries. The key for Bitcoin won\u2019t just be positive ETF news but will require a peak in rates to be confidently priced in. There is still a risk that investors might prefer stocks versus cryptos. As long as the Fed is done with this hiking cycle and soft landing hopes remain, that should be a positive backdrop for Bitcoin.\n\nIf Bitcoin is able to rally above the $31,500 level, bullish momentum could support a rally towards the $35,700 region, which is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the collapse record highs ($68,772) to this cycle\u2019s low ($15,278).\n\nWhat would really get the crypto world going again is we start to new money become highly committed. Endorsements from Michael Saylor, Elon Musk, or even Cathy Wood will do little to attract new investors. It is unlikely that Bitcoin skeptics will be changing their tune anytime soon.\n\nSome bitcoin supporters believe that the next halving in 162 days could potentially be the key catalysts to send Bitcoin back above the $40,000 level.

        "content": "Crypto analyst Tone Vays recently shared his perspective on the recent trends. While Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) has seen a notable uptick this week, Vays is urging traders to tread cautiously.\n\nWhat Happened: Bitcoin experienced a 10% increase in value last week. However, Vays expressed reservations about its potential to sustain this momentum and hit the $32,000 mark.\n\nIn a YouTube video last week, he said, \u201cLet\u2019s not go crazy here. I still think there\u2019ll be a pullback sometime in November. I don\u2019t think this is rallying to $32,000.\u201d\n\nVays predicted that Bitcoin would fall to around $28,000 before taking out the top of the range at $31,000 and rallying above $34,000.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $29,923.75, up 11 percent in the last seven days.\n\nTurning his attention to Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), Vays pointed out a potential double-bottom pattern forming against Bitcoin.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Analyst Confident About Bitcoin's Surge, But There's A Catch\n\nHe predicted that Ethereum could face challenges ahead.\n\nHe stated, \u201cEthereum is making new lows against Bitcoin. This is not surprising. Ethereum is in a very critical support area\u2026 On a monthly scale, Ethereum still has significantly more downside. This is a very nasty double bottom.

        "title": "Bitcoin Surges To 17-Month High Amid Spot Bitcoin ETF Progress - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "BTC is trading at its highest level since last May as researchers tip that the highly anticipated spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund from the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, may be seeded this month.\n\nOn Oct. 23, Scott Johnson, a finance lawyer, flagged that an updated BlackRock filing indicated the firm may move to seed its iShares Bitcoin Trust with cash this month. Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, said the filing indicates BlackRock expects to launch the fund in the near future.\n\n\u201cSeeding an ETF is when initial funding is provided\u2026 to purchase a few creation units (in this case bitcoin) in exchange for ETF shares which can be traded in [the] open market on day one,\u201d Balchunas tweeted. \u201cSeeding is typically not a lot of money, just enough to get [an] ETF going\u2026 the fact they doing it and disclosing it shows another step in the process of launching.\u201d\n\nBalchunas also noted that the ETF was also listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, which clears trades executed on the NASDAQ exchange. \u201cAgain all part of the process of bringing [an] ETF to market,\u201d he said.\n\nThe filing ignited feverish momentum in the markets, with Bitcoin rallying 15% in 24 hours to tag a local high of $35,000, according to CoinGecko. Other top ten cryptocurrencies are up by between 5% and 8% over the same period.\n\nBitcoin Surges To 17-Month High Amid Spot Bitcoin ETF Progress\n\nBullish Anticipation\n\nBlackRock filed its application for a spot Bitcoin ETF in June, prompting a rush of similar filings from rival asset issuers.\n\nWhile the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has approved futures-based Bitcoin ETFs in the past, such products invest in derivatives and thus do not impact the supply of BTC. By contrast, a spot ETF would invest in Bitcoin directly, driving scarcity for the asset\u2019s supply.\n\nSigns of progress towards the iSHARES Bitcoin Trust\u2019s launch helped to pull the markets out of a multi-month downtrend. The combined crypto market cap is now on the cusp of retesting April\u2019s year-to-date high of $1.28T after sitting at $1.03T last month.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast week, an inaccurate tweet from the crypto media outlet, Cointelegraph, falsely claiming BlackRock\u2019s ETF had received regulatory approval, sent Bitcoin flying 10% in an hour. However, the markets quickly gave back most of the gains when BlackRock rejected the tweet\u2019s claim shortly after.\n\nAnalysts at JPMorgan predicted the SEC will approve iSHARES Bitcoin Trust by January 10 \u2014 the deadline for its verdict on rival applications from Ark Invest and 21Shares.\n\nJPMorgan recently said the SEC\u2019s decision not to appeal a recent court ruling permitting Grayscale, a crypto asset manager, to convert its Bitcoin Trust into an ETF indicates a spot Bitcoin ETF approval is likely around the corner. Coinbase echoed the same sentiment in an Oct. 20 interview with CNBC.\n\nTraders are closing the gap between the price of BTC and shares in Gryscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust in response to the news, with GBTC shares trading an 11% discount relative to BTC \u2014 its lowest level in two years, according to Ycharts.\n\nBitcoin Surges To 17-Month High Amid Spot Bitcoin ETF Progress\n\nSEC Commissioner calls for Bitcoin ETF approval\n\nOn Monday, SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce told CNBC she is frustrated that her agency is still yet to approve a Bitcoin ETF thus far.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking we should approve one for the last five years, the logic for why we haven\u2019t has always mystified me,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cThe agency has not been very good when it comes to anything related to Bitcoin or other crypto assets. Every day I hope that they will wake up and they will think \u2018You know what, we need to take a more productive approach\u2019.\u201d\n\nPierce also cautioned investors against trying to predict the SEC\u2019s next move regarding a Bitcoin ETF, comparing the exercise to tea leaf fortune-telling.\n\n\u201cI can't say whether or not the commission is ready to approve a Bitcoin exchange-traded product,\u201d Pierce continued. \u201cThe [Grayscale] court case obviously is an important factor in the landscape, but I can\u2019t guess as to my colleagues\u2019 approach to this topic\u2026 Obviously, we are seeing more and more interest from firms in these products, and I hear a lot of interest from investors in these kinds of products as well.\u201d\n\nTo continue reading this as well as other DeFi and Web3 news, visit us at thedefiant.io"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is in massive demand from institutional investors but awaits a spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval to trigger a buying rally, according to a blockchain executive at the professional services provider Ernst & Young (EY).\n\nEY\u2019s global blockchain leader Paul Brody believes that Bitcoin faces a lot of pent-up demand from institutions due to United States regulators not approving a spot Bitcoin ETF for years.\n\nBrody discussed the outlook for the cryptocurrency adoption on CNBC\u2019s Crypto Decrypted on Oct. 23, declaring that trillions of dollars in institutional money are waiting to enter Bitcoin once a BTC ETF is approved.\n\n\u201cBut any of these other institutional funds, they can\u2019t touch this stuff unless it\u2019s an ETF or some other kind of regulatory blessed activity,\u201d EY\u2019s blockchain expert said, adding:\n\n\u201cIf you look at people who are buying Bitcoin, they are buying it as an asset. They are not buying it as a payment tool. Those who are buying Ethereum, are buying it as a computing platform for business transactions and DeFi [decentralized finance] services.\u201d\n\nBrody\u2019s remarks come amid global investors closely watching the crypto regulatory process by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has not approved a single spot Bitcoin ETF so far. A number of companies, including Grayscale Investments, ARK Investment, BlackRock and Fidelity, have filed with the SEC for multiple Bitcoin ETF products and are awaiting a regulatory response.\n\nRelated: Grayscale files for new spot Bitcoin ETF on NYSE Arca\n\nGrayscale, which in August 2023 won an SEC lawsuit for a spot Bitcoin ETF review, has recently filed an S-3 form registration statement with the SEC to list its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust on the New York Stock Exchange Arca.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, a recent amendment to the spot Bitcoin ETF by ARK Invest and 21Shares is a \u201cgood sign\u201d of progress and impending approvals. The ETF expert believes that the ETF amendments filed in mid-October 2023 could be in direct response to concerns the SEC has asked ETF issuers to address.\n\nMagazine: Big Questions: Did the NSA create Bitcoin?"

        "title": "Bitcoin is on the rise again. Here's why Warren Buffett remains a crypto hater - CNBC",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies are on the rise again, helped by optimism surrounding the possible introduction of a spot bitcoin ETF. But no matter how strong this rally gets, it won't convince one of the industry's biggest critics \u2014 Warren Buffett. Bitcoin surged 10% over the past week, at one point briefly topping $30,000, as hopes grew that a spot bitcoin ETF will soon be approved. The idea among boosters is that such a vehicle would further legitimize the digital token and attract a wave of investment dollars, pushing the price of bitcoin even higher. But whether a bitcoin ETF soon becomes reality or not, it won't alter the Oracle of Omaha's thesis on cryptocurrencies, which is that they are highly speculative, non-productive assets. Buffett, who once famously called bitcoin \"probably rat poison squared,\" has compared the bitcoin phenomenon to the tulip bulb mania in the Netherlands in the early 1600s . \"All you're counting on is whether the next person is going to pay you more because they're even more excited about another next person coming along. But the asset itself is creating nothing,\" Buffett said in a 2018 CNBC interview. \"It's been a very speculative, kind of Buck Rogers type thing, and people buy and sell them because they hope they go up or down just like they did with tulip bulbs a long time ago,\" said Buffett, Berkshire Halthaway's CEO. \"If you just look at something and say that's magic, you can do it with shark teeth or seashells, or anything.\" Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger is an even a more vocal crypto hater, once saying digital currencies are a malicious combination of fraud and delusion, \"good for kidnappers.\" Munger supports a ban of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. Wouldn\u2019t buy \u2018all of the bitcoin in the world\u2019 for $25 Buffett believes that the digital token has no value because it doesn't deliver anything. Unlike farms, which produce food, and real estate, which produces rent, cryptocurrencies rely on market sentiment and supply-demand dynamics. \"If you said \u2026 for a 1% interest in all the farmland in the United States, pay our group $25 billion, I'll write you a check this afternoon,\" Buffett said at Berkshire's 2022 annual meeting. \"[For] $25 billion I now own 1% of the farmland. [If] you offer me 1% of all the apartment houses in the country and you want another $25 billion, I'll write you a check, it's very simple.\" \"Now if you told me you own all of the bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25 I wouldn't take it because what would I do with it? I'd have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn't going to do anything,\" he added. 'Not a currency' The legendary, 93-year-old investor also said that bitcoin failed to meet the definition of a currency as its price fluctuates with the dollar. Crypto bulls tend to think bitcoin is a superior means of payment given its underlying, decentralized technology. \"It is not a durable means of exchange. It's not a store of value,\" Buffett said in a 2014 CNBC interview. \"People say 'well I'll sell you goods in bitcoins,' but they change the price of those every time the price of the dollar changes.... they are pricing off the dollar.\" BTC.CM= YTD mountain Bitcoin in 2023."

        "title": "Cryptocurrency Rally: Bitcoin and More Soar on New Hopes for ETF - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The weekend brought another rally to the cryptocurrency market as investors speculated that a Bitcoin (BTC -2.57%)exchange-traded fund (ETF) could be imminent. And if one ETF is approved, there could be a flood of investors moving into the market.\n\nValues are rising across the crypto industry, but the big names are advancing more than normal today. Bitcoin is up 5.6% from the market's close on Friday, Ethereum (ETH -3.18%) has gained 4.9%, Solana (SOL 5.80%) has gained 9.8%, and Dogecoin (DOGE 3.66%) has advanced 6.7%.\n\nCryptocurrencies rally on ETF hope\n\nNo Bitcoin ETF has been approved yet, but investors are positioning themselves for when that day comes. The theory is that an ETF will bring in new investors to crypto, including institutional investors who may not want to take on the custody risk of crypto but are interested in owning the assets.\n\nThere was a short period of time last week when investors thought a Blackrock Bitcoin ETF had been approved, and tokens jumped in value when that happened. This was more speculation than actual demand for Bitcoin, so the move didn't last.\n\nCoinbase pushes for more clarity\n\nThere's also a filing deadline of tomorrow for Coinbase (COIN -7.02%) to provide an answer to the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC's) rebuttal to the company's motion to get a major enforcement action dismissed. The SEC says Coinbase is selling securities, which the company disputes, and Coinbase is trying to get the case thrown out.\n\nIt's no coincidence that Coinbase would be the custodian for some of the ETFs that have been applied for. The company has some of the most advanced infrastructure in the crypto industry, and besides offering exchange solutions for institutions, it's also providing solutions for ETFs.\n\nIf the case is dismissed, it's hard to see how the SEC could continue to hold back Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency ETF applications.\n\nETF speculation brings volatility\n\nThe crypto industry is still searching for regulatory clarity in the U.S., and ETFs have become a proxy for the industry's current position with regulators. Based on the major financial institutions now applying for Bitcoin ETFs, it certainly seems likely they are confident they will get approval.\n\nIf the Bitcoin ETF is approved, the floodgates could open to other tokens. Ethereum, Solana, and even Dogecoin could see new investors, including institutions, investing in ETFs. The market may be speculating on these approvals, and that's what's driving prices today.\n\nI think the bigger impact of regulatory certainty would be increased investment in the crypto industry. The blockchain is fundamentally a technology that could drive new businesses and ways of performing contracts and storing information, but regulators need to ensure companies know what's legal and what isn't. That's why there's so much speculation on the current regulation.\n\nVolatility will continue to be commonplace in crypto until we know the certainty of both ETFs and the SEC's stance on major tokens. I think we are seeing the industry move to more approvals, but battles may need to go to court, and certainty could still be years away."

In other words, the firm is now up at least $130 per coin.\n\nMicroStrategy Bitcoin holdings as of Oct. 23. Source: BlockchainCenter.Net\n\nMicroStrategy started buying Bitcoin in 2020 and ramped up purchases in 2023 as its price recovered from extreme losses resulting from the United States Federal Reserve\u2019s policy around interest rate hikes as well as high-profile crypto bankruptcies and implosions.\n\nIn September 2023, MicroStrategy acquired 5,444 BTC by raising an equivalent amount of capital, mirroring the approach that saw the firm buy approximately 12,333 BTC by raising funds earlier this year.\n\nMichael Saylor, the co-founder and chairman of MicroStrategy, shared data showing Bitcoin\u2019s outperformance versus traditional assets since the company adopted its cryptocurrency-buying strategy in August 2020.\n\nBitcoin vs. S&P 500, Nasdaq, gold, silver and bond returns since August 2020. Source: Michael Saylor/X\n\nWill Bitcoin price rise further into 2024?\n\nSince May 2022, Bitcoin has failed to establish a clear bullish momentum after crossing $30,000. This scenario may repeat in the coming weeks. This, in turn, risks pushing MicroStrategy\u2019s BTC investment below its average buying price once again.\n\nBTC/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nMore downside cues come from Bitcoin\u2019s daily relative strength index (RSI), now at its most overbought levels since January 2023. As a rule of technical analysis, an overbought RSI (above 70) could prompt BTC\u2019s price to drop or consolidate sideways.\n\nA correction scenario will see Bitcoin\u2019s price head toward its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave) near $27,720 in November, down about 10% from current levels.\n\nConversely, maintaining and confirming $30,000 as the new support level will open the door toward the next big resistance area at $32,000 \u2014 a level not seen since May 2022.\n\nRelated: How high can Bitcoin price go by 2024?\n\nFrom a fundamental perspective, the potential approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. serves as a strong bullish backdrop, according to CryptoQuant. It notes that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF could boost the Bitcoin market\u2019s net capitalization by $155 billion.\n\nCryptoQuant argues that if this happens, the price of Bitcoin could hit $50,000 to $73,000 in 2024, which would certainly become a boon for MicroStrategy. However, the firm says it will stay on its BTC course even if a Bitcoin ETF gets the green light.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, because ticker GBTC is not an ETF, so how can we have a not ETF for the first time in the history of the ETF of the week be the ETF of the week? Tom Lydon: It\u2019s an important day, Chuck, the first time that we\u2019re doing this, but there\u2019s a good story behind it where in fact this trust may turn out to be an ETF, fingers crossed. So let me give you a little bit of the backstory. Grayscale put GBTC together a while ago. Had at one point something like $7 billion. I think there\u2019s about $4 billion in this now, but it\u2019s not an ETF. It\u2019s a trust and it almost trades like a closed-end fund where you can actually have a premium or a discount on the underlying holdings. Bitcoin was out of favor. There was almost a 30% discount on this trust. So, with that complication and the fact that there was not a spot Bitcoin ETF, Grayscale put a lot of work together, applied to the SEC to convert this trust into a spot, Bitcoin ETF, and in fact was denied, even though there were futures-based Bitcoin strategies in ETFs out there.\n\nContent continues below advertisement\n\nSEC and Grayscale\n\nFast forward, they sued the SEC\u2026 Grayscale sued the SEC in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals and won, and the SEC had 45 days to appeal that decision and that deadline was last Friday, October 13th. They did not appeal. At the same time, there are almost 10 other ETF issuers out there that have put in applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs, and the SEC is having conversations with them. They\u2019re trying to understand a little bit more about how they would be put together. In some cases, there have been amendments to the applications, so there are ongoing discussions. The fact that the SEC did not appeal that decision means that they\u2019re going to have to get Grayscale on the phone. They\u2019re going to have to have discussions. They\u2019re going to have to talk about moving forward. And there\u2019s a good chance\u2026 Again, we don\u2019t have any inside information. Nobody from any of the ETF issuers or Grayscale have told us about any conversations with the SEC, but just by the path that we\u2019re going on, we may by the end of the year or early next year see a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nBitcoin ETFs and Ether ETFs\n\nChuck Jaffe: Now, we should point out there are Bitcoin ETFs and Ether ETFs now as well. We\u2019ve just had some expansion into some of the other cryptos, but they\u2019re not a spot bitcoin ETF or crypto ETF. And for anybody who\u2019s not familiar with the term or is not a hundred percent sure, spot is\u2026 That means they invest in the coin and they trade at the value of the currency. So a spot gold fund holds gold bars rather than say investing in gold miners or gold futures. To this point, any ETF that has been in cryptocurrency has been doing the future. So we\u2019re talking about GBTC. If it is allowed to convert, would it be therefore the first spot gold ETF? And if that\u2019s the case, conversion note, you mentioned that it\u2019s like a closed-end fund. We talk a lot on my show, Money Life about closed-end funds. People want to get stuff at discounts and want to have activist investors come in and go, \u201cMake that a traditional fund. Make that an open-ended fund.\u201d And at that point pops up to net asset value. So is there a little bit of a buying play here, arbitraging the SEC, where if you\u2019re buying this fund and the case goes through, it\u2019s going to start trading at net asset value and you capture the discount?\n\nIs There an Arbitrage Opportunity?\n\nTom Lydon: Well, you touched on a lot of things there, and you\u2019re right, Chuck, there may be an arbitrage opportunity at one point in time. Again, as I mentioned, there was over a 30% discount. That discount has been shrunk to 15%, but there\u2019s still a discount. But you\u2019re almost making a bet because if this does not go through, it will continue to trade at a discount or potentially a premium at one point in time. I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019m in a position to recommend that people take advantage of that. I think the biggest thing here, and the big story is the average investor and the average financial advisor may now with a spot Bitcoin ETF feel comfortable getting access to the crypto market because by buying an ETF, you\u2019re buying through a brokerage company and all the due diligence that\u2019s done. Again, there\u2019s never a guarantee that it\u2019s going to be a hundred percent safe. Obviously, the SEC has had its reservations as well, but we\u2019re surveying advisors every year with the folks over at Bitwise. Five years we\u2019ve had the survey, but still, only 29% of investment advisors feel comfortable that they have access to cryptocurrency for their clients. Now, we feel that if there is an approval of one or many spot Bitcoin ETFs, we\u2019re going to start to see advisors take maybe small allocations for their clients in their brokerage platforms, and a little bit for a lot of advisors who have a lot of clients, could actually be very favorable for the crypto markets.\n\nDifference Between a Spot ETF and a Futures-Based ETF\n\nChuck Jaffe: It could be. And it\u2019s important to note that the difference between a spot ETF and a futures-based ETF is that you could be a diehard crypto believer. If you own a futures-based ETF, you\u2019re going to get a lot of distortion in that price. In other words, the fund may go up or down based on what\u2019s happening to the price of Bitcoin, but futures funds trade in a much more volatile way, and they don\u2019t tend to track the thing that they are tied to the way a spot fund does. So, the bigger thing is it\u2019s a long-term investment. Tom Lydon: Yeah, I would say, Chuck, the good news is we have enough time where those futures-based Bitcoin strategies and ETH strategies have correlated pretty tightly. I mean, that\u2019s the reputation of those companies and those products. And if you actually have seen a lot of volatility or it doesn\u2019t correlate with the spot price, you\u2019re not going to get a lot of people investing in it. They have pressure to make sure that there\u2019s a very, very tight correlation between the spot price and the price within those futures-based strategies. But if we see a spot ETF, we\u2019re probably not going to see as much traction in those futures-based strategies.\n\nClosing Thoughts"

        "title": "Bitcoin's Price Nears $31K Amid Further 'Regulatory Clarity' in Crypto: 3iQ's Chris Matta - CoinDesk",
        "content": "Bitcoin is nearing $31,000 taking bullish cues from traditional rate sensitive assets like gold. What does this mean? So joining us now to discuss the crypto markets is three IQ President Chris Matta, welcome Chris, good morning, Jane morning Lawrence. Great to be back. Good to see you. So Bitcoin uh is up about 15% over the this October so far, October is almost to an end. Uh A lot of that is enthusiasm about what might come, namely a potential bunch of spot ETF S in Bitcoin. Um Do you, what, what are your short term uh expectations here? What what do you think is happening? Is the market uh a little too bullish for its own good. Uh No, I don't think so. I mean, obviously there's been an onslaught of regulatory concerns over the last year, you know, rightfully. So in many cases with, with the FT collapse DC G, but then also some things like XRP, obviously gray scale, I think a lot of these cases are still starting to come closer to completion, which is bringing more regulatory clarity, more comfort. It allows institutions to feel a little more comfortable about allocating to the ecosystem. And now that's happening at a, at a similar time when there might be regulated vehicles to actually allocate into, especially with the gray scale case going favorably. And it looks like the probability of Bitcoin Etfs getting approved is inching ever higher in the final months of the year. And Ether futures ETF has has recently got approved and it seems very likely considering the gray scale precedent that Ether Spot ETF S will also get approved um sometime next year. So I think these are all really great tailwinds um for the space over the next, you know, 12 to 24 months. So, uh let's talk interest rates here because interest rates are, are, well, it'll be uh it, it seems like we might get a little bit of a pause uh with Jerome Powell uh and, and the fed seeing the bond markets kind of doing its job for it uh in many ways, letting interest rates rise as the people sell off bonds, um particularly the, the far dated uh uh bonds here. So what exactly is happening then in the E market? How are, what's the interplay between interest rates and what's going on with E? Yeah, so it's been really interesting actually over the last, you know, 6 to 10 months, obviously, the, the DFI space has, has cooled off a bit. But uh on the Ether platform, there's been a huge surge in real world assets. Um mostly treasuries, but essentially, there's a handful of crypto entrepreneurs that have brought treasuries onto the ether network and other blockchains to make it more accessible for crypto native folks to get exposure to the heightened interest rates in stratify. And so we've actually seen billions of dollars now allocated to these, to these vehicles. And I think it's interesting because that had to happen during this bear cycle. But I think longer term, this will be a really pivotal moment for the space because more assets, more real world assets are coming on chain. Um And that's going to be a real tailwind for the space to be a crucial part of the capital markets, infrastructure as other asset classes potentially start to get brought on chain as well. And you kind of have this competing technology with uh maybe traditional markets and hopefully an integration over time, many uh stratify institutions are also looking at uh tokenized uh real world assets too. Um And so for us, you know, at three A Q, it's really interesting because we um we obviously have uh E three ETF in in other jurisdictions like in Canada, um which while the the US is still working through approving spot ETF S um Canada has been very forward thinking around um even pushing the envelope further our spot Ether ETF S are now the first in the world that are staking as well. So I think Ether with the the transition to proof of stake um passing through that staking yield to investors and having some of these natural demand use cases like real world assets. These are going to be tailwinds for, for investors to allocate over the next cycle. Jen likes those compliments to Canada. I always do, always got to get some nice Canadian compliments into this show. The regulators in Canada, I have been, I have been blown away by how progressive they've they've been around topics like this, like the complexities of staking and educating themselves and putting frameworks in place to allow asset managers to bring, um, you know, things like staking to market, especially when you, you know, put that alongside of other regulators like in the US where, where those even just spot ETF vehicles haven't been able to break through. So it's been great for crypto exchanges to um they've had uh uh uh infrastructure in place and rules in place to allow retail investors to stake. And now asset managers like three IQ are able to do the same thing while, you know, in the US, as you know, with the coin based litigation and uh a lot of the retail staking platforms have been shut down and, and obviously those aren't really available through regulated exchange traded products today. Chris maybe do a little bit of a comp compare and contrast for us. You talk, um you're speaking very highly of working with the regulators in Canada, but we saw a handful of exchanges leave Canada earlier this year because they said it was tough to work with regulators there. Tell us a little bit more about your experience. It sounds like you've had a better experience than some that we've heard about in the news. Yeah. Look, I'll say I've worked with global regulators all around the world. It's never easy. It's very costly. This initiative I'm talking about where we launched an ether staking ETF has been a year and a half in the making. So that's a long time, a lot of investment, legal, legal costs, and a lot of education and collaboration with the regulators to find structures that make that work. That said there is an inherent openness, I think from the Osce and other Canadian provincial regulators to understand, learn about the space and potentially put more rules in place. So when we finally came to the finish line, they published a series of rules for asset managers to ensure that they were taking the appropriate steps and understood the risks of something like staking. And they've done this in a whole variety of different areas but things like the appropriate due diligence and reporting requirements and risk disclosure and ensuring custody remains in cold storage. And there is dedicated validators. These are all very technical things, but the regulators were comfortable understanding learning these technicalities and making sure to put a fair rule set in to enable um asset regulated asset managers like ourselves to um to launch products. So I think it takes a certain type of a firm, a certain type of pedigree folks that come from, you know, tr that understand the regulatory framework to kind of work arm in arm and, and spend the time to, to the regulators and, and ultimately come down on a compromise with a, with a framework that works for everyone. You know, you, you, you, I kind of want to go back a little bit to interest rates here because you, you brought them up as almost tailwinds for the E market and, and for development. But how are they headwinds in the sense of higher interest rates making AAA higher hurdle rate for each staking and for returns. Can you explain a little bit more? Uh what do you think the long term impact will be when it comes to staking uh in the E market? Uh particularly uh what do you think the impact will be as rates either stay high, stay steady or go even higher potentially? Yeah, of course, I think all risk assets are, are obviously impacted by the, the elevated interest rates. And so when when investors are looking at their cost of capital and if they're evaluating ST or the E staking yields have decreased over time, since proof of stake has really ramped up. And that's mostly a result of the network coming up to scale. There's been a lot more validators at events of the network. So while it started um uh post uh post merge around, you know, 8% it slowly moved down closer to 4% and that will likely continue as more validators come onto the network. But to your point, if there is, you know, competing interest rates, especially even on chain through like some of these on chain treasury products that I mentioned, it may result in investors allocating capital towards, you know, treasuries or other high interest bearing assets. But I think in light of the broader kind of negative macro sentiment right now, you mentioned earlier, Lawrence, the budget budgetary pressures with with the multiple global conflicts, you know, rising interest rates and just general inflationary pressures. I think there's been a move towards assets like gold like like Bitcoin like Ether, I mean, we we heard Larry Fink's comments about flight to quality and and including Bitcoin in that statement. So I think that narrative will will hopefully keep some some positive momentum for crypto assets even though Ether staking yields may be declining over the long term. Chris, I want to come back to the three IQ Ether ETF, talk to us about the demand for staking in the ETF and how it's going to work. Yes. So it's really interesting in an ETF vehicle. There's this complexity around you have daily creations and redemptions and for those that may be a little more technical about staking staking. There is a bonding and un bonding period. So there's liquidity challenges. So these are all things that I mentioned before that we worked with the regulators. Obviously, our focus at three IQ is bridging that gap between traditional finance and the crypto space and making the asset class more accessible. So bundling in staking into a vehicle that you can create and redeem unlimited quantities on a daily basis. There's there's obviously operational and liquidity challenges with that, but we've optimized that we are, we are going to be ramping up staking to probably about 50% of the assets initially and hoping to increase that closer towards 100% over time as things like liquid staking um become more regulated and more liquid. We're able to pass through um the yield from that the the staking yield to the actual unit holders. Um It won't be passed out as a dividend, but it will accrue to the net asset value of the fund and essentially provide enhanced performance um for those investors. So it's, it's a really interesting um a time where investors that are that are buying e are now getting boosted performance over just the price of E but are actually getting that staking yield accruing to the net asset value of the fund. And, and like I said earlier, this is the first Ether ETF in the world. There are some exchange traded notes ens in Europe that have different staking components, but this is the first, you know, true exchange traded fund that, that has this and that's a distinction in counter party risk. But essentially, you know, the ETF is is fully segregated assets in the unit holders name. So there's a, there's a lower counter party risk threshold than some of the other vehicles globally. So it's a really, it's a really huge innovation. We're dropping our management fees to zero to promote the product obviously flows globally just generally into into crypto is is muted as Lawrence mentioned earlier, but you know, the best products get built during the bear markets. And as some of these market sentiments shift and there's more flows towards crypto. We're hoping to really capture that especially with really innovative products like staking integrated entire E three TF. Chris, congratulations on the launch of the new pro product and thanks for joining us this morning. It's always a pleasure. Thanks for having me talk soon. That was three IQ President Chris Matta."

        "content": "The battle for SocialFi supremacy continues to rage, and while Friendtech may have kicked off the latest boom, its position atop the sector is showing signs of weakening.\n\nOver the last two days, many prominent users, including NFT influencer Pranksy and Vombatus, a colourful figure whose key was formerly the most expensive on the platform, sold the majority of their assets on Friendtech and moved over to New Bitcoin City (NBC), another SocialFi platform that runs on a bespoke Layer 2 built atop the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nNBC has seen around $1M in inflows over the past day, pushing its total value locked (TVL) above $3M, according to DeFiLlama. Meanwhile, Friendtech has seen outflows of around $2M in the past two days.\n\nNew Bitcoin City TVL chart\n\nVombatus sold 176 of his own keys for over 850 ETH ($1.5M) without warning, dropping the price by 75%. While he retains 150 keys, the move triggered a cascade as other users sought to protect their portfolios from further drawdowns.\n\nFriendtech Hit By Selloff As SocialFi Whales Move To New Bitcoin City\n\nRise and Fall of (3,3)\n\nOver the past few weeks, the preferred strategy for farming Friendtech points has been to exchange keys with other users with an informal understanding not to sell each other\u2019s keys. This is referred to as (3,3) or (fren,fren).\n\nOnce popularized by OlympusDAO, the selloff over the past two days has again highlighted the flaws in the strategy, as whoever sells first often comes out ahead.\n\n\u201cIt appears that ETH was more important than any imaginary 3,3 reputation,\u201d NFT enthusiast Otto Suwen told The Defiant.\n\nLack Of Progress\n\nOthers blame the development team, led by Racer, for a lack of clarity on the future direction of the app and for taking too long to deliver seemingly simple features that would enhance the user experience.\n\n\u201cFT team can do a better job sharing their vision for the app so these moments are easier to bear for the ecosystem they're trying to create,\u201d wrote 0xbreadguy.\n\nPerhaps in response to community pressure, Racer posted an update on X, saying that the team will prioritize 'usability and fun,' after focusing on security over the past weeks.\n\nStory continues\n\nFriendtech Hit By Selloff As SocialFi Whales Move To New Bitcoin City\n\nThe Defiant reached out to some active Friendtech users seeking insights into the situation.\n\nMost aren\u2019t too concerned about the exodus to NBC but want to see new features and improved communication from the developers.\n\n\u201cTime to be decisive if you want to stay or leave, and act on that,\u201d said Lutherin, a self-proclaimed Friendtech addict.\n\n\u201cMany are using NBC as an excuse, they're leaving to chase the shitcoin pump,\u201d opined BigHead.\n\n\u201cThey are not here to farm the airdrop or create content, they are only interested in fees on their own keys. As soon as the volume drops, they move to a new fork and call everyone there. But they won't trap me,\u201d said retired Blur farmer minysmoral, when asked about prominent accounts abandoning the platform.\n\nCheesypouf echoed the sentiment. \u201cThey're moving because it offers the best chance for them to extract what they can from a somewhat new segment of buyers. That\u2019s all,\u201d he said.\n\nNot everyone is convinced, however.\n\n\u201cSome people downplaying it, but look at the major players either they're liquidating in mass or clearly trickle selling out - not something to ignore. Doesn't help that this app has been so buggy the last few days,\u201d said ozark.eth.\n\nDisclosure: The author has an active account on Friendtech.\n\nTo continue reading this as well as other DeFi and Web3 news, visit us at thedefiant.io"

But now, instead of heading towards the baseline, it\u2019s staying low.\u201d\n\nBitcoin sum coin age distribution annotated chart.

Source: Alternative.me\n\nOn that topic, popular trader Altcoin Sherpa described $30,000 as a \u201cscary area.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still see this next high as extremely important when seeing where price goes,\u201d he told X subscribers on the day, adding that \u201cwe're about to see if we're going to see 20k or 40k in the midterm.\u201d\n\nLike others, Altcoin Sherpa highlighted $32,000 as the ultimate line in the sand for bulls to charge through.\n\n\u201cBasically if we break 32k strongly, we go to 40k,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cIf we form a lower high around here or reject around 32k strongly, I think we're going to go to low 20ks. Gut says 40k but 32k is a super strong level overall and I don't feel strong about it.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart.

        "title": "Bitcoin Mining Outcry Comes to a Crescendo - Arkansas Business Online",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency mining equipment (Shutterstock)\n\nThe last time Arkansas Business dug into the state\u2019s growing digital asset mining operations, in July, cities and counties were resisting them, criticizing their noise, huge power appetites and often shadowy foreign ownership.\n\nFaulkner, Clark and Van Buren counties were racing to set local limits before a state law, Act 851, went into effect Aug. 1, outlawing county and municipal \u201cdiscrimination\u201d against crypto mines.\n\nThese are warrens of connected shipping containers or warehouses filled with thousands upon thousands of computer servers. The computers, often cooled by loud buzzing fans, solve complex mathematical puzzles to verify blockchain transactions and create new bitcoins, with the miners keeping a fraction of each.\n\nEarly last week, a bitcoin was worth more than $28,000, down from more than twice that much in November 2021 but still a pretty penny.\n\n\u201cSolving these puzzles has no other benefit to humanity,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Prasad told Arkansas Business that the price is \u201ca strong economic incentive\u201d to burn through megawatts of power that could serve more positive economic pursuits. \u201cBy some estimates, 1% of the world\u2019s electricity is now devoted to cryptocurrency mining,\u201d he said, calling it \u201ca misguided and environmentally destructive race to the bottom.\u201d\n\nNow concerned citizens in DeWitt are fighting plans for more bitcoin mining, and state Sen. Bryan King, R-Green Forest, and Arkansas Rice Growers Association Chair Kenneth Graves have joined their cause.\n\nA citizens group met last week to voice opposition to digital asset mining in Arkansas County, and citizens are asking Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders to call a special legislative session to repeal Act 851.\n\nAsked about crypto mine concerns in Arkansas County, the governor\u2019s office said Sanders\u2019 top priority is \u201cthe safety and security of Arkansans,\u201d and that she will continue to work with lawmakers \u201cto fight Communist China and protect the rights of all Arkansans.\u201d\n\nChina and Arkansas\n\nAn Oct. 13 New York Times report quoted King and showcased Microsoft\u2019s worries about crypto mining in Cheyenne, Wyoming, next door to a Microsoft data center supporting the Pentagon, and about a mile from an Air Force base controlling intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n\nKing promises to tackle the issue head-on. In a text message, he said that since Act 851 took effect, lawmakers have learned more about \u201cconcerns that should have been discussed.\u201d\n\nHe said that House Bill 1799, which became Act 851, was filed late in this year\u2019s regular session and improperly expedited. The bill\u2019s title was deceptive, he said, seemingly just a clarification of regulations on digital asset mining. \u201cHowever, it is just a guise for crypto mines to build in Arkansas and seemingly promote economic growth,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cCrypto-mining facilities draw immense energy and strain our electrical grids,\u201d he said, adding that China banned bitcoin mining in 2021, ostensibly over energy use and financial concerns.\n\nHe fears crypto-mining centers threaten critical U.S. systems, including computer networks and a vulnerable electrical grid.\n\nWorries over Chinese ownership thwarted plans for bitcoin sites in Harrison, Vilonia and elsewhere this summer, and the Times article named Arkansas among 12 states with Chinese-owned bitcoin mines collectively using enough electricity to power 1.5 million homes.\n\nIn July, Arkansas Business reported on one bitcoin mine near Greenbrier \u2014 despised by its neighbors for being noisy and arriving with no notice \u2014 tied to Gang Hu (or Hu Gang), leader of Greenland Holdings of Shanghai, which is nearly half-owned by the communist Chinese government.\n\nPushback by residents stopped a Greenland-related project in Harrison whose spokesman was Ethan Wang, the point man for the mine near Greenbrier. Wang\u2019s business card, obtained by Arkansas Business, calls him business development director for MetaHash. Metahash Global is a Greenland Holding Group subsidiary related to Green Digital, the company behind the rejected Harrison project; Newrays LLC, which has the site near Greenbrier; and ViLoAr LLC, which pushed the Vilonia project. Bitcoin hub owners in Arkansas tend to be individually named LLCs, but shared ownership is common.\n\nOpposition to bitcoin mines unites conservative technology hawks, liberal environmentalists and everyday Arkansans protecting their tranquility.\n\nGraves, the Rice Growers Association chair, told KATV that he represents Arkansas County farmers concerned about their electricity and water. Local opponents also fear for the prairie\u2019s duck hunting-related businesses.\n\nCompanies have been drawn to Arkansas because of its inexpensive land, a lack of zoning in unincorporated areas and a good deal on bulk power from Entergy Arkansas, the state\u2019s largest electric utility.\n\nEntergy offers a special tariff for the miners with a low energy charge: about three-quarters of a penny to a little over a penny per kilowatt-hour, as opposed to 10 or 11 cents for residential power, but that is just part of the rate. Demand charges typically make up a third or more of commercial power bills, and big customers also pay riders for energy cost recovery, energy efficiency, etc., a spokeswoman said. Entergy also requires a three-month deposit from miners, along with a surety bond or irrevocable letter of credit.\n\nLittle Rock attorney Lyle D. Foster owns several hundred acres in Arkansas County, most leased to \u201cindividuals, farmers, hunters\u201d and commercial interests. He told Arkansas Business in an email Tuesday that when he bought the property in 2018, he \u201cdidn\u2019t even know what crypto mining was.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne acre of that land is leased to Jones Digital, LLC, which is based out of Delaware,\u201d Foster wrote. \u201cMy understanding is that it plans to use the site as a crypto mine and my lease requires employees and other service providers to come from Arkansas County and for prompt payment of all state and local taxes that will come about from operations.\u201d\n\nHe said he is unaware of any Chinese or foreign ownership.\n\nBelvia Rodgers, who helped arrange the meeting of concerned citizens Tuesday at the DeWitt Community Center, said she invited King to attend, and was seeking TV news coverage.\n\n\u201cWe have one crypto farm that has recently been built,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cIt\u2019s a black-and-white issue. We are opposed.\u201d\n\nRodgers said her group has heard that six crypto-currency facilities are planned in the area. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true or not, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything good about it.\u201d\n\nDeWitt business owner Jackie Johnson, speaking just before the Arkansas County Quorum Court strengthened county noise restrictions this month, said she feared that if bitcoin mines keep proliferating, Arkansas \u201cwill no longer be the Natural State; we will be the Bitcoin State.\u201d\n\nShe said that not too long ago, Arkansas had no bitcoin farms.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Sarah Huckabee Sanders and our Legislature [who] welcomed them [with] open arms. It\u2019s something else too. Bitcoin miners are not little mom-and-pop businesses. They are big conglomerates that don\u2019t even live in the United States,\u201d Johnson said."

For the week, the S&P slipped -2.39%, and the Nasdaq 100 closed down -2.9%.\n\nTraders are concerned that Israel\u2019s conflict with Hamas could escalate into a wider Middle East war. Also adding to the gloomy tone were long-term interest rates climbing and hotter-than-expected retail sales data.\n\nThe only positive sectors on the week were Energy +0.75% and Consumer Staples +0.70%.\n\nThe worst-performing sectors for the week were Real Estate -4.3%, Consumer Discretionary -4.58%, and Financials -3.04%.\n\nINTEREST RATE FUTURES\n\nA contrarian view:\n\nThe decision-making process of Federal Reserve officials appears unlikely to undergo any significant changes in the near future. Fed governors are compelled to make decisions based on historical data, which, in turn, relies on their perception of the present reality.\n\nIt is highly improbable that the Federal Reserve, or virtually any other participant in the financial markets, could accurately articulate the current state of the economy and foresee developments over the next 6-12 months.\n\nAdding to the complexity is the rapid increase in the U.S. national debt, amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars per month. This raises the possibility of the Federal Reserve resorting to substantial quantitative easing to better manage this debt\u2019s monetization.\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s worth noting that this assessment does not even factor in potential future monetary support for countries like Israel or Taiwan.\n\nENERGY FUTURES\n\nThe oil options skew has gone massively inverted. In plain English, upside out-of-the-money call volatility is relatively more expensive than at-the-money options. Oil options markets show traders are more interested in calls, call spreads, and short put structures.\n\nOne way to take advantage of this pricing \u201canomaly\u201d if you are bullish on oil is via call spreads (where the sold leg is relatively more expensive in terms of volatility).\n\nShort-term risk indicates a rise in prices in the upcoming days and weeks. If the conflict intensifies or expands, the price increase might be sustained longer-term.\n\nBITCOIN FUTURES\n\nThe market tells traders what could happen when the SEC greenlights the BTC spot ETF.\n\nBitcoin jumped to nearly $30,000 last Monday, gaining around $2,000 in a matter of minutes after crypto news outlet Coin Telegraph said on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that the SEC had approved BlackRock\u2019s spot bitcoin ETF application.\n\nThe rumor proved to be untrue, and Bitcoin quickly fell back down. The current spot price is around USD 29,400.\n\nSavvy traders will want to keep 11/17/23, and 1/10/24 circled on their calendars as deadlines for SEC action to approve (or not) BTC ETF.\n\nECB RATE DECISION\n\nThe consensus expects the ECB to have no rate change on all three key rates. The expectation for unchanged rates has stemmed from the September policy statement, which noted that the rates \u201chave reached levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to the target.\u201d\n\nOIL PATCH CONSOLIDATION\n\nBig Oil players have increasingly turned to the Permian Basin for oil and gas, where technological advancements and infrastructure have led to lower extraction costs. In the last few weeks, the trend has been for companies to join together in mergers.\n\nU.S. natural gas producer Chesapeake Energy Corp has approached Southwestern Energy in a potential $12bn deal. Should the two companies combine, they would overtake EQT Corp as the U.S.\u2019s largest natural gas-focused exploration and production company by market value.\n\nExxonMobil (XOM)\u2019s $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) highlights Big Oil\u2019s continued appetite for shale producers. It gives ExxonMobil massive scale in the Permian Basin, allowing it to double its footprint in the largest oil-producing region in the U.S. and strengthen its upstream portfolio. Upstream refers to the initial oil and gas production phases, like exploration, drilling, and extraction.\n\nPERFORMANCE SUMMARY\n\nThese performance charts track the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly changes of various asset classes, including some of the most popular and liquid markets available to traders.\n\nAll content published and distributed by Topstep LLC and its affiliates (collectively, the \u201cCompany\u201d) should be treated as general information only.

        "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Bitcoin's Path To Global Reserve Status - Xapo Bank CEO Seamus Rocca Shares Insights - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Bitcoin's (CRYPTO: BTC) journey to becoming a global reserve currency hinges on several key factors - more institutions mainstreaming its use, effective regulation of its touchpoints rather than the currency itself, dispelling myths surrounding its environmental impact and creating easier transaction avenues for the public, according to Seamus Rocca, the CEO of Xapo Bank.\n\nThe CEO's insights are particularly timely, as the financial community continues to explore the future of digital assets. Events like Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets conference on Nov. 14 will further delve into these pressing topics, fostering deeper understanding and collaboration.\n\nIn an interview with Benzinga, Rocca highlighted the inherent differences between cryptocurrency exchanges and banks, explaining that exchanges are primarily designed for trading, not for holding assets securely.\n\nIn contrast, Xapo Bank aims to bridge the gap between traditional banking and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe bank serves as a custodian, ensuring Bitcoin is stored safely, and offers a deposit-guaranteed bank account that integrates seamlessly with Bitcoin transactions.\n\nSpeaking about the global impact of cryptocurrencies on traditional financial institutions, Rocca observed that major banks and investment platforms worldwide are now exploring digital assets.\n\nThe increased interest is driven by client demand and a growing understanding of Bitcoin's unique properties, including its finite supply and independence from sovereign control.\n\nRocca also touched on the benefits countries might experience by adopting Bitcoin, emphasizing its diversification potential and the significant upside projected by reputable financial institutions worldwide.\n\nDiscussing the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi), Rocca pointed out that while DeFi has cooled down recently, high-quality DeFi platforms remain crucial for the industry. Platforms that have strengthened their capabilities are positioned to thrive.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Congressman Tom Emmer Eyes Speaker's Gavel\n\nRocca expressed optimism about Bitcoin potentially replacing gold as a global reserve currency.\n\n\"For this to happen, there needs to be broader institutional acceptance, clearer regulation, and dispelling of common misconceptions about Bitcoin's environmental impact,\" he said.\n\nRocca then elaborated on Xapo Bank's unique positioning in this evolving financial landscape.\n\n\"We're not merely a traditional bank that's adapted to Bitcoin, nor are we just a Bitcoin wallet,\" he explained.\n\n\"Xapo has evolved from being a Bitcoin wallet to a fully-fledged bank, recognizing the gaps and pain points Bitcoin enthusiasts face with traditional banking systems.\"\n\nWhen prompted about the differences between legacy banks, centralized exchanges, and Xapo Bank, Rocca emphasized the bank's dual commitment to security and flexibility.\n\n\"We're a qualified custodian for your Bitcoin and a regulated institution for your fiat currencies. Meanwhile, an exchange might offer you a platform for trading but lacks the credentials to securely store assets. At Xapo, we combine the best of both worlds, making asset management seamless for our clients.\"\n\nDirectly addressing the challenges many face with cryptocurrency adoption in traditional banking, Rocca said, \"We've noticed a clear reluctance among traditional banks to even touch Bitcoin. But Xapo Bank offers a space where clients can confidently send and receive Bitcoin without fear.\"\n\n\"We currently offer Bitcoin in both wallets and savings accounts. Our savings account even earns you a 1% interest on your Bitcoin. On the banking side, we provide a dollar deposit guarantee, easing the concerns many have regarding digital assets,\" he added.\n\nRocca hinted at upcoming features. \"We're soon introducing 'Wealth', encouraging users to invest. Beyond Bitcoin, we aim to include options for users to invest in S&P 500 tracker funds and even buy stocks from giants like Apple and Amazon,\" he said.\n\nThe Xapo Bank CEO also pointed to the game-changing potential of Bitcoin, particularly for developing markets.\n\n\"For many in places like Argentina or Nigeria, Bitcoin is not just an asset; it's a beacon of financial stability in otherwise volatile economies.\"\n\nRead Next: Worldcoin's Bold Move To Boost WLD Token Supply: Will It Pay Off?\n\nJoin Benzinga's Fintech Deal Day & Awards on Nov. 13 and Future of Digital Assets on Nov. 14 in New York City to stay updated on trends like AI, regulations, SEC actions and institutional adoption in the crypto space.

        "content": "Adelle Nazarian is the top staffer at the American Blockchain PAC, where she serves as its CEO. But she has a long story to tell about her life prior to her time in the crypto industry \u2014 from her Persian roots to her career in journalism.\n\nNazarian, who worked as a freelance journalist after serving in positions with mainstream outlets that included Fox News and CNN, said her work contributed to her disillusionment with the media. \u201cWorking in journalism was really eye-opening for me because I witnessed how divisive and activist-oriented it\u2019s become,\u201d she said in an interview with Cointelegraph.\n\nShe said her desire to work in a role that contributed to people\u2019s betterment was one of the driving factors that led her to the American Blockchain PAC in 2021, saying, \u201cI saw Bitcoin as being one way of providing an opportunity to people everywhere in the world to pull themselves up in life.\u201d\n\n1) Your family fled from Iran before the Iranian Revolution, but you\u2019ve never visited. Do you speak Farsi? Tell us more about your background.\n\nAdelle Nazarian with Egyptian Major Gen. Mahmoud Hassanaian (retired) at the Egyptian Embassy in Washington, D.C. during her time as executive director of the Shafik Gabr Foundation (2019). Source: Adelle Nazarian\n\nMy parents were both born in Tehran, Iran and emigrated to the United States when they were young. My father was 15 and my mother was 12. I was raised speaking Farsi and English. (I also speak Mandarin Chinese and French.) It is one of my dreams to visit Iran someday in the future. I\u2019d love to visit so many parts of the country and especially to visit Isfahan, which is where my maternal grandparents were born and raised. I am proud to come from such a rich, diverse and beautiful cultural background.\n\nMy mom is a homemaker and also had a caviar business for several years and my father is an entrepreneur.\n\n2) You used to work in journalism \u2014 at Fox News, CNN and elsewhere. Why\u2019d you make the transition into crypto?\n\nWorking in journalism was really eye-opening for me because I witnessed how divisive and activist-oriented it\u2019s become. Reporting a story isn\u2019t about the facts anymore for some journalists \u2014 it\u2019s about injecting their own ideas.\n\nI really enjoyed doing investigative journalism, but I consider myself to be an entrepreneur and philanthropist at heart. I felt that, really, the blockchain space was a way to be able to have a platform to utilize my experience and work with diverse people \u2014 from leaders of countries to everyday people \u2014 and see how everyone\u2019s experience is truly predicated on one underlying theme that connects them all.\n\nAdelle Nazarian interviewing Mike Pence in 2016, before he became the vice president. Source: Adelle Nazarian\n\nThat theme is the desire and ability to create a better life for themselves and those around them. It\u2019s such a factor that determines your lot in life. I saw Bitcoin as being one way of providing an opportunity to people everywhere in the world to pull themselves up in life. It also provides governments with the opportunity to reduce their reliance on war as a way to increase wealth.\n\n3) Tell us about the American Blockchain PAC.\n\nThe American Blockchain PAC was founded as a way to provide a space for everyone interested in seeing a sound regulatory framework to define what crypto is and what Bitcoin is, and in clearly defining and understanding them and how they\u2019re classified in the United States.\n\nRelated: Crypto industry seeks to educate, influence US lawmakers as it faces increasing regulation\n\nWe boost candidates running for office who support blockchain technology. But I think a lot of political action committees try to only basically pick and support candidates who will win \u2014 and we don\u2019t just do that. We\u2019re also trying to educate and inform people about crypto and the adoption of digital assets, and enable them to push back against legislation that could harm them at the end of the day.\n\n4) What\u2019s your favorite crypto?\n\nBitcoin \u2014 because it\u2019s different from other cryptocurrencies. I believe everyone is grateful that the SEC made it very clear that Bitcoin is not a security. I also like Cardano and Ethereum. Ethereum began with good intentions but may have steered away from its original vision. That said, I think there is a bright future for it and an opportunity for it to evolve. Bitcoin is a pioneer in the digital assets space. It started the revolution we are living through today.\n\nUnfortunately, I think a lot of meme coins and altcoins have put a bad taste in people\u2019s mouths when it comes to digital assets, and I think it strengthens the argument for Bitcoin greatly.\n\n5) Does it matter if we ever figure out who Satoshi really is or was? Why, or why not?\n\nThere are two quotes I like: \u201cNo amount of evidence will ever persuade an idiot,\u201d by Mark Twain and \u201cThe truth is a strange thing. You can try to suppress it but it will always find its way to the surface.\u201d\n\nSo of course there are people who are faking and pretending to be Satoshi. The \u201cFakeToshi\u201d hashtag is an indicator of that fact. But at the end of the day, the real Satoshi Nakamoto is alive, and he is not a Japanese man. I recently read Ivy McLemore\u2019s book, Finding Satoshi, and it was intriguing.\n\nAdelle Nazarian speaking on a panel in Dhaka, Bangladesh (2019). Source: Adelle Nazarian\n\nAnyone who has actually done their due diligence and studied Bitcoin understands there must be some reason for Bitcoin\u2019s origins. Satoshi did not want these so-called \u201ctrusted\u201d third parties and banks running away with consumer cash, which is a persistent issue \u2014 just look at what occurred with FTX. It\u2019s ironic that what he\u2019s stood against from Day 1 \u2014 \u201ctrusted\u201d third parties like FTX \u2014 have actually become the main tools for buying and selling Bitcoin. This is not in line with his original vision.\n\nAs for whether it matters who Satoshi is, only the real Satoshi will pave the way for the next generation of Bitcoin and dozens of new and emerging industries that will benefit from the underlying blockchain technology. Satoshi created Bitcoin to be decentralized and peer-to-peer. He never sought to do any of this based on his own personal greed or agenda. He did this for the world. Technically, we are all Satoshi.\n\nIt\u2019s the vision that matters, because even the most incredible technology \u2014 without vision \u2014 is a dormant tool. Bitcoin was created to elevate humanity in a truly unprecedented way in our collective history.\n\n6) What do you do in your free time?\n\nI\u2019m a big foodie. I enjoy different cuisines. I can make recipes from all over the world. Being Persian, one of my favorites is khoresht gheymeh\u2014 it\u2019s a tomato-based stew made with beef, lentils and spices, served traditionally with rice and tahdig \u2014 a crispy golden crust over fluffy rice. I also enjoy working out, reading, and traveling. I love to travel.\n\nThe beauty of #crypto, and specifically Bitcoin, is that it was created to cut across debilitating barriers that were formed to prevent everyday people from having access to prosperity. Fiat money has failed in many ways to be just and equitable. Virtual assets solve that problem \u2014 Adelle Nazarian (@AdelleNaz) July 7, 2022"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) had a good week, with prices rising about 10% to reach the psychologically important level of $30,000. After the rally, the question troubling investors is whether the uptrend will continue or if a reversal will happen.\n\nTrading team Stockmoney Lizards recently said that Bitcoin may soon break above its overhead resistance and start a sharp rally. They believe the approval of a spot exchange-traded fund would drive mass adoption and trigger a rally before the halving due in April 2024.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nA positive development this week was that Bitcoin\u2019s strength rubbed off to several altcoins, which surged above their respective overhead resistance levels. This suggests that the sentiment is gradually turning positive and that it may be time to consider buying selectively.\n\nTypically, the coins that lead the markets higher are the ones that tend to do well. Laggards are generally the last to perform, hence could be avoided initially.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the charts of the top five cryptocurrencies that may outperform in the near term.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears near the $30,000 mark, but a positive sign is that the buyers have not given up much ground.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nA consolidation near the current level suggests that the bulls are in no hurry to book profits, as they anticipate another leg higher. That could catapult the price to the overhead resistance zone between $31,000 and $32,400.\n\nContrarily, if the price turns down from $31,000, the BTC/USDT pair could drop to the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) ($28,160). If the price snaps back from this level, the bulls will again try to clear the overhead hurdle.\n\nThe positive sentiment will be negated on a break below the 20-day EMA. That could keep the pair stuck inside the $31,000\u2013$24,800 range for some more time.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe pair is in an uptrend, as seen on the four-hour chart. Normally, during an ascent, traders buy the dip to the 20-EMA. If that happens, it will signal that the sentiment remains bullish and every minor dip is being purchased. The pair may then continue its journey toward $32,400.\n\nConversely, if the price skids below the 20-EMA, it will indicate that the traders may be closing their positions in a hurry. That could open the gates for a further decline to the important support at $28,143.\n\nSolana price analysis\n\nSolana\u2019s SOL (SOL) broke out of the neckline on Oct. 19, completing a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. This setup has a target objective of $32.81.\n\nSOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe overbought levels on the relative strength index (RSI) suggest that a correction is possible. The important support to watch on the downside is $27.12. A strong bounce off this level will indicate that the bulls have flipped the level into support. That will improve the prospects of the continuation of the uptrend. Above $32.81, the rally could hit $39.\n\nTime is running out for the bears. If they want to halt the up-move, they will have to drag the price back below $27.12. The SOL/USDT pair may then tumble to the neckline. This remains the key level to keep an eye on because a drop below it will suggest that the break above $27.12 may have been a fake-out.\n\nSOL/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bulls are facing stiff resistance near $30. This may start a pullback that could reach the breakout level of $27.12. Buyers are expected to defend this level with vigor. A solid bounce off this level may suggest the resumption of the up-move.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down and breaks below $27.12, it will signal that the bears are aggressively selling at higher levels. The pair may then dive to the neckline near $24.50. This level may again witness strong buying by the bulls.\n\nChainlink price analysis\n\nChainlink\u2019s LINK (LINK) has been trading inside a tight range between $5.50 and $9.50 since May 2022, indicating a balance between supply and demand.\n\nLINK/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls tried to resolve the uncertainty to the upside with a break above the range on Oct. 22, but the long wick on the candlestick shows that the bears are not willing to relent. If the bulls do not give up much ground from the current levels, it will enhance the prospects of a rally above $9.50.\n\nThe LINK/USDT pair could then start a move toward the pattern target of $13.50. Typically, a breakout from a long consolidation results in a sharp rally. In this case, the uptrend may stretch to $15 and thereafter to $18.\n\nThe first support on the downside is at $8.50. If bears tug the price below this level, it will suggest that the range-bound action may continue for a while longer.\n\nLINK/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe pair witnessed a sharp rally from $7.50, which propelled the RSI deep into the overbought territory on the four-hour chart. This suggests that the rally is overextended in the near term and could result in a pullback or consolidation.\n\nThe solid support on the downside is $8.75 and then $8.50. A strong bounce off this zone will suggest that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. That will increase the possibility of a retest of $9.75.\n\nOn the contrary, a break below the 20-EMA will indicate that the bears are back in the game. The pair may then sump to $7.\n\nRelated: Lightning Network faces criticism from pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton\n\nAave price analysis\n\nAave (AAVE) rose above the downtrend line on Oct. 21, invalidating the bearish descending triangle setup. Generally, the failure of a negative setup starts a bullish move.\n\nAAVE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages have started to turn up and the RSI is in the overbought territory, indicating that bulls are at an advantage. If the price maintains above the downtrend line, the AAVE/USDT pair may first surge to $88 and then to $95.\n\nIf bears want to prevent this up-move, they will have to quickly pull the price back below the downtrend line. That may catch a few aggressive bulls on the wrong foot and start a correction to the moving averages. A slide below the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) ($62) will put the bears back in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\nAAVE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears tried to stall the relief rally at the downtrend line, but the bulls did not give up much ground. The momentum picked up, and the pair is on its way higher toward $88.\n\nA minor concern in the short term is that the RSI soared into the overbought territory, indicating that a consolidation or correction is possible. On the way down, the first support is at $72. The bears will have to yank the price below the downtrend line to trap the bulls.\n\nStacks price analysis\n\nStacks\u2019 STX (STX) rose sharply in the past few days, indicating that the bulls are trying to start a new uptrend.\n\nSTX/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bullish crossover on the moving averages suggests that the bulls have an edge. In the short term, the overbought levels on the RSI indicate that a minor correction or consolidation is possible. The first support on the downside is the 20-day EMA ($0.54).\n\nIf the price rebounds off this level, it will signal a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. That will increase the likelihood of the continuation of the up-move. The STX/USDT pair could first rise to $0.80 and subsequently to $0.90.\n\nThis positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and plummets below the 20-day EMA.\n\nSTX/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe price has been consolidating in a tight range between $0.61 and $0.65, as seen on the four-hour chart. This is a positive sign, as it shows the bulls are not rushing to the exit because they anticipate another leg higher. If buyers drive the price above $0.65, the pair will attempt a rally to $0.68 and then to $0.75.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-EMA, it will signal profit-booking by short-term traders. The pair may then plunge to the 50-SMA.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin Price and Ethereum Prediction, NEM Pumps 30%\n\nGiven the ongoing market volatility, Bitcoin is trading bearish, although it is still consolidating in a limited trading range of $15,800 to $17,200. Ethereum, the second-most valued cryptocurrency, is likewise moving sideways, with a price range of $1,175 to $1,280.\n\nMajor cryptocurrencies were trading in the negative early on November 21, with the crypto market value down nearly 4% to $803 billion on the previous day. The overall crypto market volume, on the other hand, increased by 59% in the last 24 hours to $52.85 billion.\n\nThe overall volume in DeFi was $4.60 billion, accounting for 8% of the total 24-hour volume in the crypto market. Whereas, the overall volume of all stablecoins was just above $51 billion, accounting for 97% of the total 24-hour volume of the crypto market.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the top 24-hour altcoin gainers and losers.\n\nTop Altcoin Gainers and Losers\n\nNEM (XEM), UNUS SED LEO (LEO), and BinaryX (BNX) are three of the top 100 coins that have gained value in the last 24 hours. The XEM price has soared by more than 4% to $0.035, the LEO price has grown by more than 2% to $4.45, and the BNX price has increased by nearly 0.20%.\n\nTop Altcoin Gainers and Losers \u2013 Source: Coin360\n\nChiliz (CHZ), EthereumPoW (ETHW), and NEAR Protocol (NEAR) are three of the top 100 coins that have lost value in the last 24 hours.

ETHW has plunged by more than 13% in the last 24 hours to trade at $3.20.\n\nFTX Exploiter Swaps 50K ETH to BTC, Causing ETH to Drop 6%\n\nThe stolen monies, totaling over $60 million at today\u2019s exchange rates, were first sent via the FTX Exploiter account on November 20.\n\nIn an approximately four-hour span, the hacker transferred a total of 25,000 ETH from one wallet to another. This was preceded by transfers of 5,000 ETH, 10,000 ETH twice, and eventually 25,000 ETH.\n\nThe FTX hacker is doing things\u2026\n\n\n\nThey sent 25k ETH to another wallet and have been actively selling into RenBTC over the last few hours.\n\n\n\nThey sold another 3k ETH a few minutes ago.\n\n\n\nAnd have sold 18K ETH ($21.7M) of the 25k so far.\n\n\n\nCan't we just chill on a Sunday? pic.twitter.com/WLwlU943R9 \u2014 Aylo (@alpha_pls) November 20, 2022\n\n\n\nSince there was now $60 million worth of ETH in the new \u20180x866\u2019 wallet, the FTX Exploiter began bridging a subset of the 50,000 ETH using RenBridge, a blockchain bridging technology funded by Alameda Research.\n\nThe $477 million received by the \"FTX drainer\" ethereum account is now being bridged to Bitcoin, using RenBridge (owned by Alameda!)\n\n$28 million in ETH has been converted to RenBTC so far this morning, of which $18 million has been bridged to BTC.https://t.co/46DhCaX7GQ \u2014 Tom Robinson (@tomrobin) November 20, 2022\n\nThe FTX Exploiter kept bridging renBTC in exchange for ETH, eventually reaching a total of 692 renBTC from the initial 50,000 ETH. At the time of writing, the \u20180x866\u2019 wallet contained over 10 ETH and 0.092 renBTC, with a total market worth of around $13,000.\n\nConcerns about the FTX-related issue are keeping the whole market under selling pressure.\n\nBitcoin Price\n\nThe current Bitcoin price is $16,112, and the 24-hour trading volume is $28 billion. Bitcoin has lost over 3% in the last 24 hours. CoinMarketCap currently ranks first, with a live market cap of $309 billion, down from $352 billion.\n\nIt has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 BTC coins and a circulating supply of 19,213,150 BTC coins.\n\nBitcoin Price & Tokenomics \u2013 Source: coinmarketcap\n\nBitcoin has settled into a trading range of $16,000 to $17,000, with a breakout determining future price movement.\n\nBitcoin is currently facing immediate resistance near the $17,250 level, and a cross above this could lead BTC to the next resistance area of $18,100.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nOn the downside, Bitcoin\u2019s immediate support is at $15,800, and a bearish breakout of this can open up additional selling space until $15,800. Whereas, an additional breakout below $15,800 can expose BTC to $14,550.\n\nEthereum Price\n\nThe current price of Ethereum is $1,129, with a 24-hour trading volume of $11 billion. In the last 24 hours, Ethereum has lost over 7%. With a live market cap of $138 billion, CoinMarketCap currently ranks second. It has a circulating supply of 122,373,866 ETH coins.\n\nEthereum Price & Tokenomics \u2013 Source: coinmarketcap\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, Ethereum is attempting to reclaim the $1,100 level. The ETH/USD has broken through a symmetrical triangle on the lower side, indicating the possibility of a strong downtrend continuation.\n\nOn the upside, the 50-day moving average is extending major resistance at $1,215 and is likely to act as a major resistance below a previously violated triple bottom.\n\nEthereum Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nClosing candles below this level may cause ETH to fall into the $ 1,075 or $1,000 support zones.\n\nNEM Pumps 30%\n\nThe current NEM price is $0.03461, and the 24-hour trading volume is $62 million. NEM has increased by over 3.50% in the last 24 hours and over 30% in last seven days. With a live market cap of $311 million, CoinMarketCap currently ranks #85. There are 8,999,999,999 XEM coins in circulation.\n\nNEM Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nOn the technical front, NEM has risen above the $0.030 support level, and the closing of candles above this level has the potential to fuel further uptrends.\n\nOn the upside, NEM\u2019s immediate resistance remains at $0.040, and increased demand could cut through it to target $0.048 or $0.050.\n\nPresale Cryptocurrency With Enormous Potential Gains\n\nDash 2 Trade (D2T)\n\nDash 2 Trade, developed by the Learn 2 Trade service, offers market-driven insights, trading signals, and prediction services to investors.

        "content": "Bitcoin Price Prediction as Halving Event in 2024 Sparks Bullish Sentiments \u2013 Time to Buy?\n\nThe BTC/USD is currently witnessing a decline of nearly 0.50%, with its value standing at $29,400.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market navigates this shift, Bitcoin faces intensified price pressure in anticipation of the Bitcoin halving event in 2024 and a crucial decision by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding an ETF application.\n\nMoreover, releasing US inflation data adds an additional layer of uncertainty to the market\u2019s trajectory.\n\nIn this context, we delve into the factors shaping Bitcoin\u2019s current dynamics and its potential outlook.\n\nBitcoin Halving Event 2024\n\nScheduled for April 26, 2024, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event is poised to reduce the block reward to 3.125 BTC, a date calculated based on current estimations.\n\nThis halving underscores a pivotal aspect of Bitcoin\u2019s monetary strategy, aiming to manage inflation rates and enhance scarcity, thus driving long-term value.\n\nAs each halving event decreases the new Bitcoins produced per block, the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply tightens, echoing the deflationary concept of assets like gold.\n\nThis diminishing supply and rising demand historically result in potential price appreciation.\n\nUltimately, Bitcoin\u2019s halving reinforces its distinct position, capping its total supply at 21 million coins, in contrast to traditional fiat currencies prone to inflation.\n\nThis event\u2019s historical trend of spurring price growth further underscores the intricate relationship between scarcity, demand, and Bitcoin\u2019s value, making the impending halving\u2019s impact on price a keenly anticipated aspect of the cryptocurrency\u2019s ongoing narrative.\n\nBTC Price Pressure Heightens Ahead of Crucial SEC ETF Decision\n\nThe SEC is expected to announce a decision on the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF tomorrow, a day ahead of the official Aug. 13 deadline.\n\nThis announcement is highly anticipated in the crypto market, but a delay is possible.\n\nIt could pressure BTC prices, as the announcement will likely occur after the market closes.\n\nTIMELINE: I've had questions in DMs and mentions over the last few days. The next SEC deadline for #Bitcoin ETFs is @ARKInvest/@21co__'s on 8/13. That's a Sunday so we should see a decision by tomorrow. My bet is after market close tomorrow. We are fully expecting a DELAY. pic.twitter.com/meejrBZaQp \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) August 10, 2023\n\nProminent financial firms, including BlackRock, Bitwise, Van Eck, and Wisdomtree, are seeking regulatory approval for their Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nARK 21Shares holds a time advantage, potentially leading the ETF race. However, concerns over market manipulation, liquidity, and investor protection could hinder or stall these ETFs.\n\nThe upcoming days are crucial for ARK 21Shares and its competitors as they navigate the path to approval amidst ongoing challenges.\n\nUS Inflation Data Fuels Uncertainty\n\nThe US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a 3.2% inflation increase in July, slightly lower than the market\u2019s 3.3% expectation.\n\nThe uncertainty in BTC price movement is due to the Federal Reserve\u2019s potential sustained hawkish stance because of the lower-than-expected CPI data.\n\nThe impact of inflation on Bitcoin\u2019s price is uncertain, as reflected by BTC\u2019s current value below $30,000 after the July data release.\n\nThis is despite the success of the widely-used inflation measure, CPI, in highlighting the Federal Reserve\u2019s liquidity reduction.\n\nHistorically, Bitcoin has surged due to inflation, with the Fed\u2019s 2021 monetary expansion driving it to a record high of $65,000.\n\nHowever, the current CPI report has not caused a bullish rally, and bulls are waiting for a catalyst to move past the $30K resistance level.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nBitcoin is presently being traded at approximately $29,400 and appears to be neutral as it is facing some difficulties in surpassing the $29,600 mark, as indicated by the four-hour timeframe.\n\nOn the upside, a bullish breakout above the $29,600 level can potentially expose the BTC price toward the $30,200 level.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nBitcoin has reached the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $29,200. The closing of doji candles above this level suggests a potential bullish correction.\n\nIf it drops below, BTC may descend toward $29,250.\n\nOn the other hand, overcoming the $30,200 resistance might push BTC toward the range of $30,600 to $31,000.\n\nThe zones at $29,800 and $30,200 are critical. Potential shifts below them indicate a bearish trajectory for BTC.C.\n\nTop 15 Cryptocurrencies to Watch in 2023\n\nStay informed about the latest initial coin offering (ICO) projects and alternative cryptocurrencies by regularly exploring our carefully selected collection of the top 15 digital assets to watch in 2023.\n\nThis thoughtfully curated list has been compiled by industry experts from Industry Talk and Cryptonews, ensuring that you receive professional recommendations and valuable insights.\n\nStay ahead of the game and discover the potential of these cryptocurrencies as you navigate the ever-changing world of digital assets.\n\nFind The Best Price to Buy/Sell Cryptocurrency\n\nDisclaimer: Cryptocurrency projects endorsed in this article are not the financial advice of the publishing author or publication \u2013 cryptocurrencies are highly volatile investments with considerable risk, always do your own research."

        "title": "Bitcoin pioneer Hal Finney can't be Satoshi Nakamoto, new analysis suggests - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin pioneer Hal Finney was competing in a 10-mile race when Satoshi Nakamoto was responding to emails and transacting on Bitcoin, newly surfaced evidence has revealed.\n\nFor years, it has been speculated that the late Hal Finney, a computer scientist, created Bitcoin (BTC). He was the first person besides Satoshi to download and run Bitcoin\u2019s software and was the first recipient of Bitcoin. Finney, however, denied the theory until his passing in 2014.\n\nJameson Lopp, a self-proclaimed cypherpunk and co-founder of Bitcoin custody firm Casa, doesn\u2019t believe the speculation either. In an Oct. 21 blog post, Lopp shared new evidence that casts further doubt on the theory.\n\nRacing to send an email\n\nLopp\u2019s key evidence revolves around a 10-mile race in Santa Barbara, California, on Saturday, April 18, 2009.\n\nAccording to the race data, Finney competed in the \u201cSanta Barbara Running Company Chardonnay 10 Miler & 5K,\u201d starting at 8:00 am Pacific Standard Time and finishing the race 78 minutes later.\n\nThe race, however, coincides with timestamped emails between Satoshi and one of the first Bitcoin developers, Mike Hearn.\n\nHal Finney was a legendary Cypherpunk, but he was not Satoshi.\n\nToday I present my research to support that claim.https://t.co/gZVQv3QW0B \u2014 Jameson Lopp (@lopp) October 21, 2023\n\n\u201cIt turns out that early Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn was emailing back and forth with Satoshi during this time,\u201d explained Lopp, referring to archived emails that Hearn had released publicly in the past.\n\n\u201cWhat can we determine from all of this? Satoshi sent the email to Mike at 9:16 AM Pacific time - 2 minutes before Hal crossed the finish line.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the hour and 18 minutes that Hal was running, we can be quite sure that he was not interacting with a computer,\u201d Lopp added.\n\nHal Finney pictured running the 10 mile race on April 18. Source: PhotoCrazy\n\nThe Bitcoin transaction\n\nMeanwhile, Lopp highlighted on-chain data to further support his claim.\n\nHearn\u2019s emails show that Nakamoto sent Hearn 32.5 BTC in one transaction.\n\nLopp pointed to this transaction that took place on block 11,408, which was mined at 8:55 am PST \u2014 55 minutes into Finney\u2019s race.\n\nNakamoto confirmed this transaction \u2014 in addition to another one involving 50 BTC \u2014 in the 6:16 pm email, which Lopp iterates took place while Finney was still running.\n\nHealth issues\n\nMeanwhile, analysis has also highlighted that Satoshi was working on code and posting on various forums during a time when Hal Finney\u2019s battle with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) had already affected his ability to use a keyboard.\n\nLopp cited an Aug. 22, 2010 post from Hal Finney\u2019s wife, Fran Finney, who said the couple attended the 2010 Singularity Summit in San Francisco on Aug. 14\u201315 and that Finney\u2019s hard-fought battle with ALS slowed his typing from a \u201crapid-fire\u201d 120 words per minute to a \u201csluggish finger peck.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is better off with Satoshi's identity remaining unknown. A human can be criticized and politically attacked. A myth will withstand the test of time. \u2014 Jameson Lopp (@lopp) August 12, 2023\n\nDuring that same time, Nakamoto performed four code check-ins and wrote 17 posts on various forums between Aug. 14\u201315, 2010, said Lopp.\n\nLopp also noted several differences in Finney\u2019s Reusable Proofs of Work code compared with the original Bitcoin client code.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin pioneer Hal Finney talks ZK-proofs in 25-year-old unearthed footage\n\nHowever, Lopp also acknowledged there could be objections to the so-called evidence.\n\nHearn published the emails in 2017 \u2014 seven years ex-post facto \u2014 and that it was around a time when other Bitcoiners lost trust in him over disagreements on how to scale Bitcoin.\n\nFinney could have also scripted the emails and transactions in advance, or there could have been more than one Satoshi Nakamoto, Lopp said.\n\nHowever, Lopp argues that Bitcoin\u2019s creation came from a single developer:\n\n\u201cIn all my time researching Satoshi, I\u2019ve yet to come across any evidence suggesting it was a group. If it was a group, then they all operated on the same sleep schedule, consistent across code commits, emails, and forum posts.\u201d\n\nHal Finney unfortunately passed away in August 2014 as a result of complications with ALS.\n\nMagazine: Big Questions: Did the NSA create Bitcoin?"

        "content": "NFTs \u2018on Bitcoin\u2019: Yes, That\u2019s a Thing!\n\nSource: Adobe/James Thew\n\nNon-fungible tokens ( NFTs ) are all the rage right now. From CryptoPunks to Bored Apes, millions in crypto are exchanging hands for pixel art, tokenized memes, and crypto collectibles.\n\nFor the most part, the action takes place on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, which has made some hardcore bitcoiners skeptical of this new crypto market segment. However, there is also a market of NFTs secured by the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain.\n\nRead on to learn about what\u2019s happening with Bitcoin-secured NFTs.\n\nNFTs are moving beyond Ethereum\n\nUntil recently, Ethereum has been the go-to blockchain for minting and trading NFTs. That is changing quickly, however, as Ethereum high gas fees have pushed out many would-be market participants, making NFTs on other chains more attractive.\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain has also a role to play here.\n\nWhile NFTs \u201con Bitcoin\u201d don\u2019t exist purely on the Bitcoin blockchain (in a way that ERC721 tokens exist on Ethereum), they are secured by the Bitcoin blockchain. The additional tech stack that powers the ability to issue and secure NFTs with Bitcoin is provided by the likes of Counterparty, Stacks, and the Liquid Network.\n\nLet\u2019s dive in and take a look at some of the most prolific NFT projects secured by Bitcoin.\n\nRare Pepes & crypto art on Scarce City\n\nScarce City is a Bitcoin-secured art auction platform that enables artists to sell their artwork for BTC.\n\nThe Scarce City team claims that \u201cBitcoin\u2019s finest goods should be sold according to the network\u2019s properties of pseudonymous, borderless, permissionless, trust minimized, and verifiable authenticity and supply.\u201d\n\nOn the auction platform, art is sold via Lightning-powered auctions to \u201ckeep auction participants accountable by collateralizing their bids through instant, anonymous, low-fee Lightning Network payments,\u201d the team explains on its website.\n\nIn addition to giving artists the ability to sell their physical art in exchange for BTC, the marketplace also sells an NFT series based on the Pepe The Frog internet meme, called the Rare Pepe collection.\n\nRare Pepe NFTs are powered by Counterparty \u2013 an open-source protocol built on top of the Bitcoin network \u2013 that uses the Bitcoin blockchain to record data.\n\nBy securing NFTs on Bitcoin, these digital collectible cards arguably have a chance of lasting longer than NFTs secured by newer chains that may end up disappearing (or forking) in a few years\u2019 time. For NFT holders, that is something to consider.\n\nNFT skins for Bitcoin gamers\n\nBitcoin-secured NFTs are not only limited to artworks and dank memes. They also have applications in the gaming world. For instance, Lightnite, a play-to-earn online game powered by Lightning payments, utilizes Blockstream \u2019s Liquid Network to enable players to purchase and earn in-game items in the form of NFTs.\n\nThe Liquid Network is a Bitcoin sidechain that can facilitate the trading of these and other Bitcoin NFTs. While it was created by Blockstream, it\u2019s currently governed by a federation of parties and operated on an open-source blockchain platform called Elements.\n\nWe're excited to share @lightnitegame has released the first #LiquidNetwork-powered NFTs for their in-game assets like clothing, weapons, equipment, & more! We think this is awesome so we're giving away a bunch of assets today @ #ConsensusDistributed! \ud83c\udfae\ud83c\udf0a https://t.co/5KBQghftrH pic.twitter.com/jpHqzDgo2y \u2014 Blockstream (@Blockstream) May 12, 2020\n\nIn a blog post, Blockstream explains that Lightnite players receive a unique Liquid token in their account every time they purchase or earn a skin. These tokens can then be withdrawn to a personal Blockstream wallet for safekeeping or to trade with other Lightnite players. Should a Lightnite player receive a skin outside of the game, they can deposit the Liquid token in their Lightnite account to receive the skin and deploy it in the game.\n\nLightnite skins are not the only NFTs floating around on the Liquid Network. Another notable NFT project on Liquid is Raretoshi.\n\nRaretoshi is an NFT marketplace that enables artists to sell rare digital art for L-BTC (pegged bitcoin on Liquid), benefiting from lower transaction costs and the ability to get paid in bitcoin.\n\nNFTs on Stacks: Web 3.0, built on Bitcoin\n\nStacks says it is a decentralized, open-source network built on Bitcoin that aims to unleash Bitcoin\u2019s potential as a programmable base layer to build \u201ca better Internet.\u201d That means that developers can mint NFTs and build NFT marketplaces that are secured by the power of the Bitcoin network.\n\nThe Stacks team says that \u201cBitcoin has all the properties that decentralized apps and smart contracts need: the security, the settlement assurances, the capital, and the network effects.\u201d\n\nIn light of Stacks\u2019 Bitcoin-powered technology stack and the rising popularity of NFTs, it comes as little surprise that the first NFT ventures have already started to emerge on Stacks.\n\nStacksArt , STXNFT , and Boom are examples of up-and-coming NFT platforms operating on the Stacks chain.\n\nInterestingly, Satoshibles \u2013 an NFT collection by bitcoiners for bitcoiners that launched on Ethereum \u2013 announced that it plans to move to Stacks via an NFT bridge between Ethereum and the Stacks blockchain.\n\n\u201cUsing Satoshi as our mascot, we have always felt that we are the NFT for Bitcoin enthusiasts, however, it\u2019s a pretty hard sell when your project is on Ethereum,\u201d the Satoshibles team admitted.\n\nTo bring its series of 5,000 algorithmically generated, Satoshi-themed NFTs close to the Bitcoin community, Satoshibles holders will be able to port their NFTs to Bitcoin via Stacks.\n\nAs the NFT market continues to grow and more NFTs \u201cpowered by Bitcoin\u201d emerge, we could see even more money flowing into non-fungible tokens, especially when collectors can trust that their NFTs are secured by Bitcoin.\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 Evaluating NFTs: How to Know Whether an NFT Project is Legit\n\n\u2013 This Is How NFTs Might Change TV and Film Industries\n\n\u2013 Play-to-Earn Gaming is Booming: From Axies to Lightnite, Here\u2019s What\u2019s Out There\n\n\u2013 NFT-Powered Donations Gain Traction"

Source: TradingView\n\nIn terms of Bitcoin\u2019s market structure over a longer timeframe, successive daily closes above the $31,700 level would be notable, as daily or weekly higher high candles above this level puts the price above a key pivot point and enters territory not seen since May 2022.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "In the ongoing quest to find the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous founder of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) , fresh evidence now questions the theory that Bitcoin pioneer Hal Finney was, in fact, the elusive Satoshi. This new perspective is brought forth by Jameson Lopp, co-founder of Bitcoin custody firm Casa.\n\nWhat Happened: Lopp\u2019s research shed light against the possibility of Finney being Nakamoto. The main crux of his argument is based on the activity timeline of both individuals on April 18, 2009.\n\nHal Finney was a legendary Cypherpunk, but he was not Satoshi.Today I present my research to support that claim.https://t.co/gZVQv3QW0B\n\n\u2014 Jameson Lopp (@lopp) October 21, 2023\n\nOn this particular day, Hal Finney participated in a 10-mile race in Santa Barbara, California, starting at 8 a.m. Pacific time and finishing 78 minutes later. Meanwhile, Nakamoto was seen active online, engaging in timestamped email exchanges with early Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn. Additionally, Nakamoto also confirmed a Bitcoin transaction during the same time frame.\n\nSee Also: Dogelon Mars Soars 30% \u2014 ELON\u2019s Ascent Outshines Dogecoin, Shiba Inu\n\nFurther evidence presented by Lopp includes a period when Finney was grappling with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), which impacted his typing speed. However, during this phase, Nakamoto was seen actively coding and posting on forums.\n\nLopp also pointed out significant discrepancies between Finney\u2019s Reusable Proofs of Work code and the original Bitcoin client code, which adds further fuel to the argument against Finney being Nakamoto.\n\nWhile Lopp\u2019s evidence seems substantial, he does concede that there could be counterarguments, such as Finney potentially scripting the emails and transactions in advance, or that Nakamoto could indeed be a pseudonym used by multiple individuals.\n\nWhy It Matters: The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains one of the most compelling mysteries in the world of cryptocurrency. While many have been linked to the pseudonym, no definitive proof has been presented so far.\n\nEarlier this month, an X (Twitter) account with the name Satoshi Nakamoto resurfaced, after a five-year break on the social media platform. The tweet came from the account @satoshi which is also marked as \u201cverified\u201d with the blue tick.\n\nRead Next: Crypto Analyst Sounds Alarm On Bitcoin\u2019s Rally, Warns Traders Not To \u2018Go Crazy\u2019 As Crypto Soars By 10%\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\n\u00a9 2023 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Bitcoin NFTs: How Ordinals Proved Bitcoin Can Evolve With the Times\n\nImage Source: Pixabay\n\nWhile the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymously named creator of Bitcoin remains unknown, his primary purpose of creating the flagship cryptocurrency has never been a mystery. He created Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash to take back financial control from institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments.\n\nThe goal was crystal clear: create a trustless system of electronic transactions. The study of the Bitcoin whitepaper further shows that Bitcoin was designed to focus purely on financial transactions.\n\nIn fact, Nakamoto had previously opposed the addition of other use cases to the leading cryptocurrency. In 2011, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin rejected the idea of integrating a domain name system (DNS) into Bitcoin called BitDNS, saying that combining all proof-of-work consensus systems into one dataset would not be scalable.\n\n\u201cThe primary goal behind the creation of Bitcoin was to serve as a medium of value transfer,\u201d Sebastian Jan Menge, co-founder of FitBurn, said in a comment. However, this goal has evolved many times over the past decade.\n\nThe first Crypto enthusiasts mostly bought in on the idea that Bitcoin\u2019s canonical hard cap of 21 million coins would make it a hedge against inflation. This led to the cryptocurrency gaining some reputation as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d or a sound store of value.\n\nEven Goldman Sachs put forward the \u201cstore of value\u201d thesis for Bitcoin. However, that narrative failed just recently when Bitcoin plunged 75% despite inflation soaring to record high levels.\n\nCrypto believers then shifted to the narrative that the leading cryptocurrency is a way to protect against \u201ccurrency debasement.\u201d This basically means that when central banks create more money, Bitcoin\u2019s value will rise because the new money reduces the value of the money that\u2019s already in circulation.\n\nThis narrative has already failed, too. Central banks around the world continue to raise interest rates and shrink their balance sheet, which reduces the supply of money. If Bitcoin was a hedge against monetary debasement, it shouldn\u2019t be up 40% year-to-date despite the decrease in the money supply.\n\nCome in, NFTs. The recent arrival of the Ordinals protocol has unleashed a new narrative of NFTs and smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain, creating some much-needed buzz in the usually tranquil world of Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin NFTs: What Are Ordinals?\n\nBitcoin Ordinals is a new protocol designed and deployed by former Bitcoin Core contributor Casey Rodarmor that enables users to explore, transfer, and receive individual satoshis, the atomic unit of Bitcoin, which can include unique data.\n\nThe protocol uses \u201cinscriptions,\u201d which are arbitrary content like text or images that can be added to sequentially numbered satoshis to create unique \u201cdigital artifacts.\u201d These artifacts, which are NFTs in effect, can be held and transferred across the Bitcoin network like any other sats.\n\nSome recently-recorded inscriptions. Image Source: Ordinals.com\n\n\u201cOrdinals are a numbering scheme for satoshis that allows tracking and transferring individual sats. These numbers are called ordinal numbers. Satoshis are numbered in the order in which they\u2019re mined, and transferred from transaction inputs to transaction outputs first-in-first-out,\u201d according to the Ordinals documentation.\n\nBoth the numbering and transfer schemes depend on order. The numbering scheme is based on the order in which satoshis (Bitcoin units) are mined, while the transfer scheme is based on the order of transaction inputs and outputs. That\u2019s why they are called \u201cOrdinals.\u201d\n\nOrdinals Won Hearts of Many Despite Initial Backlash\n\nInitially, the Ordinals project sparked some controversy among Bitcoinists. So-called Bitcoin purists hit out at the project, arguing that Bitcoin was designed to focus solely on financial transactions and that other features could come at the cost of scalability and higher costs.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is designed to be censor-resistant. This doesn\u2019t stop us from mildly commenting on the sheer waste and stupidity of an encoding. At least do something efficient,\u201d Blockstream CEO and long-time Bitcoiner Adam Back said.\n\nwe can recognize we can't really stop them and it's a free world with anonymous miners. but we can also educate and encourage developers who care about bitcoin's use-case to either not do that, or do it in a prunable space-efficient eg time-stamp way. \u2014 Adam Back (@adam3us) January 29, 2023\n\nOn the other hand, supporters noted that it can attract more people and extend the Bitcoin network\u2019s use cases. For one, Dan Held has described it as a net benefit for Bitcoin, saying, \u201cIt brings more financial use cases to Bitcoin and drives more demand for block space (aka fees).\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Ordinals proved to be a hit, taking the Bitcoin blockchain by storm. Since January, more than 252,000 Ordinals have been inscribed to the Bitcoin network, bringing more than $1.42 million in fees for miners, as per a Dune Analytics dashboard.\n\nImage Source: Dune Analytics\n\nRobert Quartly-Janeiro, Chief Strategy Officer of crypto exchange Bitrue, said the Bitcoin community\u2019s predilection for Bitcoin Ordinals \u201cremains a matter of conjecture,\u201d as it hinges on the needs and desires of the wider user base. He added:\n\n\u201cWhilst it is innovative, there is a risk that it waters down the belief in Bitcoin by using the smallest denomination of it and looking to cash in on the value therein by trading off a name \u2013 it\u2019s also not an uncomplicated process to achieve it.\u201d\n\nQuartly-Janeiro mentioned that if the success of the Ordinals project is community-led, it indicates that Bitcoin is \u201cinherently adaptive and can evolve over time to accommodate new use cases. The acceptance of Ordinals on the network is a testament to this adaptability and serves as a good indicator for the network\u2019s future growth.\u201d\n\nHowever, there is a long way to go before Ordinals become what NFTs are on the Ethereum blockchain, that\u2019s according to Simon Davis, CEO and co-founder of Mighty Bear Games. \u201cThe wallets are not there yet and they can\u2019t properly transact through a marketplace. Ordinals must be traded over the counter, which is very risky right now,\u201d he said in a comment.\n\nDavis noted that he doesn\u2019t see a rivalry between Ethereum and Bitcoin based on the introduction of NFTs. \u201cMore utility for BTC can only be a good thing for the ecosystem as it has the deepest liquidity of all crypto asset classes. Getting the BTC audience interested in applications for the tech and on-chain assets should help the space overall,\u201d he added.\n\nDid Ordinals Impact the Bitcoin Price?\n\nThe arrival of the Ordinals Protocol coincided with a big jump in the price of Bitcoin. Since January 20, when Rodarmor officially launched the program on Bitcoin\u2019s mainnet, the OG cryptocurrency is up by around 12% even despite a flurry of aggressive regulatory actions from U.S. authorities.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s uncertain if the recent rally is connected to Ordinals, the project is considered a favorable development from an investor\u2019s perspective, according to Bryan Courchesne, founder and CEO of DAIM, a crypto asset management firm.\n\nCourchesne noted Bitcoin has long been touted as digital gold, a digitally scarce store of value. Critics have argued that, like gold, it has no utility and therefore the value proposition is weak. \u201cOrdinals help change that,\u201d he stated, adding:\n\n\u201cAdding to Bitcoin\u2019s element of programmability shows that the digital asset can be more than a digital store of value. You can argue the merits of Ordinals but the crypto space has responded favorably in the past to artistic expressions stored on a blockchain.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust like NFTs generated billions of dollars of on-chain economic activity, Ordinals could do the same. And this is just one sign of things to come. Who knows what future upgrades could bring?\u201d Courchesne said.\n\n\u201cWe do know that through all of this Bitcoin will maintain its status as a digitally scarce hard asset with a proven track record. We think that Ordinals only improve the investment case.\u201d\n\nOrdinals Revive Interest in Bitcoin Development: Is DeFi Next?\n\nFollowing the arrival of Ordinals, building products on Bitcoin saw a major uptick. This led to an increase in the average Bitcoin block size as more users started to join the network, research firm FSInsight said in a report earlier this month.\n\nThe report noted that Ordinals, which have caused higher fees per block, could eventually create a sustainable demand for block space. This could address one reasonable criticism of Bitcoin\u2019s security model, which is the lack of miner revenue attributable to fees.\n\nFurthermore, the excitement surrounding NFTs on Bitcoin has brought new experimentation to the network, including more efforts to bring DeFi to the OG cryptocurrency. Specifically, Ordinals\u2019 success has renewed interest in the Stacks ecosystem.\n\nI cannot keep up with everything happening in the Stacks layer ecosystem. This thing has a life of its own, growing & changing rapidly.\n\n\n\nDecentralized ecosystems, FTW! \u2014 muneeb.btc (@muneeb) February 24, 2023\n\nStacks is a project that seeks to unlock the full potential of the Bitcoin blockchain by bringing smart contracts and decentralized applications. Originally known as Blockstack but rebranded to Stacks in 2020, the project was designed as a layer-1 solution that uses Bitcoin as its base layer.\n\nThe platform is powered by the Stacks (STX) token, which fuels the execution of smart contracts, the processing of transactions, and the registration of new digital assets. The token has gained more than 162% over the past month, data by CoinGecko shows.\n\nNikolay Denisenko, co-founder and CTO at Brighty, a neodigital banking app, said the Bitcoin community has been anticipating the arrival of decentralized applications, claiming that these would benefit the entire ecosystem. He said in a comment:\n\n\u201cThey are expected to add more utility and encourage the development of commercial projects, and \u2013 potentially \u2013 draw in new developers and expand the range of use cases. As the most secure blockchain, Ordinals and smart contract capabilities would complement what Bitcoin has to offer.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how significant the new narrative of NFTs and smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain will be. Nonetheless, the fact that Bitcoin advocates can shift from one narrative to another shows that the leading cryptocurrency can adapt to changing times."

        "title": "What is the Lightning Network? Bitcoin's Scalability Solution. - Decrypt",
        "content": "In brief Because of the way it's built, Bitcoin suffers from slow transaction speeds and high transaction costs.\n\nThe Lightning Network is a \"second-layer solution\" that speeds up transactions, while reducing costs, by skirting the main Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nYour Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin has been hampered by its own popularity. Thanks to the way the blockchain is designed, the speed of transactions is slow and the cost of transactions has increased.\n\nResearchers, developers, and the Bitcoin community have been trying to come up with a way of allowing Bitcoin\u2014and other cryptocurrencies\u2014to accommodate more transactions.\n\nTheir best efforts to date have focused around something called the Lightning Network. Can it fix the cryptocurrency's scaling problems?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSpeed and cost\n\nA blockchain has two limitations we need to explain before exploring potential fixes.\n\nThe first is speed.\n\nIn a blockchain, blocks are essentially groups of transactions collected together. As part of a blockchain\u2019s design, there are only so many transactions that can be included in a block.\n\nIf your transaction doesn\u2019t make it into the current block, it joins a queue. That queue can take anywhere from a few minutes to potentially a day or more to process, depending on how many other transactions are queued in the mempool.\n\nThat limits the blockchain\u2019s use as a medium to process quick transactions, like buying a cup of coffee. No one wants to wait around for the network to verify you\u2019ve got the cash.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe second limitation is cost.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s network, and others, are built upon a consensus protocol called proof-of-work.\n\nThis is where miners expend energy trying to solve a difficult puzzle. To help offset the cost of equipment and energy used in that calculation, miners charge transaction fees.\n\nWhen the system is small, and the number of transactions that need verifying is few and far between, the network works well and transaction costs are low. As the network grows, however, so do transaction fees, since there is limited space in each newly mined block. As a result, transactions with the highest fees are prioritized for processing when the system faces high usage.\n\nBitcoin's scalability challenge became apparent toward the end of 2017 when millions of people jumped on the Bitcoin bandwagon and it struggled to cope with the number of transactions. At its peak in December 2017, the average cost to process one transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain\u2014whether the amount was $1 or $1,000\u2014was $37. That made Bitcoin largely uneconomical as a currency. And that\u2019s where the Lightning Network comes in. (We've got a whole article explaining more about Bitcoin's limitations.)\n\nWhat is the Lightning Network?\n\nThe Lightning Network is a layer-2 built on top of the Bitcoin network, meaning that it's built separately from the Bitcoin network but interacts with it. It\u2019s made up of a system of channels that allows people or companies to move money between one another without needing to use the blockchain to verify the transaction.\n\nIt bears similarities to the current settlement system used by companies like Visa and Mastercard. When you pay for something, it\u2019s not instantly settled. Instead, there\u2019s a quick verification of funds from the buyer and the request from the seller\u2014giving the green light for a transaction to take place. The actual settlement of funds happens later\u2014in some cases, days or weeks.\n\nThe Lightning Network is run by a network of nodes that process payments, and transactions are commonly made using QR codes\u2014instead of complex public keys. In theory, it could allow thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of transactions to take place instantly, making small transactions economical.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe bottom line is, payments are faster and cheaper.\n\nWho came up with the idea?\n\nThe Lightning Network has its origins in musings by Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, but was formalized by researchers Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja, who published a white paper about the Lightning Network on January 14, 2016.\n\nThey argued that a network of micropayment channels could fix the scalability issues of the Bitcoin network, rather than changing the Bitcoin network itself to allow more transactions.\n\nLightning Labs, a blockchain engineering lab, helped to launch a beta version of the Lightning Network in March 2018\u2014alongside a host of individuals and other companies including ACINQ and Blockstream. It was initially funded via a $2.5 million seed round, which included notable investor Jack Dorsey (whose company Square has since funded several grants for Bitcoin and Lightning Network projects). The first version of the Lightning Network was launched on Bitcoin in March 2018.\n\nThe Lightning Network was the first attempt at a second-layer solution, but others followed.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe Lightning Network is faster and cheaper because it skirts the main Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIt has an unstructured network set up around it. Channels are the ad hoc, peer-to-peer connections through which payments are made. Any number of payments can be sent in a channel.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe network is maintained by nodes that route payments. Nodes are run by everyday people\u2014or corporations\u2014running a program on their desktops, laptops, or Raspberry Pis. This keeps the Lightning Network decentralized.\n\nTo start using the Lightning Network, any amount of Bitcoin needs to be locked up in a payments channel. Then, it can be spent across the Lightning Network until the channel is closed.\n\nWhen someone wants to receive a transaction, they create an invoice, a long alphanumeric string of digits\u2014often represented using QR codes. The person who wants to make the payment simply needs to scan this invoice with their Lightning Wallet and confirm (by providing a digital signature) the payment.\n\nWhen a payment is made, the confirmation is sent across the network to the person who originally made the request. This is known as a peer-to-peer network and means the processing of payments is not reliant on any one party. This typically happens in just a few seconds\u2014hence the name \"Lightning.\"\n\nSince payments aren't made on the Bitcoin blockchain, they're not subject to long wait times and high fees. This means that much smaller payments, or micropayments, can be made for as little as one satoshi (one hundred millionth of a Bitcoin).\n\nOnce someone has finished using the network, they can close that channel and exit, and then use their BTC again on the standard Bitcoin network.\n\nHow do I use it?\n\nLet\u2019s say you want to transact with your local coffee shop. First, you\u2019d need to send some Bitcoin to a wallet that requires more than one signature or key to release the funds.\n\nThese are commonly referred to as multisig wallets. In the case of the Lightning Network, it allows people to enter into an agreement that ensures a payment is received, effectively creating a balance sheet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEvery time you buy a cup of coffee a new balance sheet is created, and you sign it with your public key to reflect what\u2019s left in your wallet as well as what\u2019s in the coffee shop\u2019s wallet.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to buy coffee anymore from that coffee shop, you can close the channel, and the resulting balance sheet is committed to the blockchain as a permanent record.\n\nPayment disputes also can be settled by referring to the last signed balance sheet between the two parties.\n\nWhat happens if you don\u2019t have a direct channel with the next place you want to buy something from? The network will find the shortest route between you and the shop via others in the network.\n\nHow to connect\n\nYou can connect to the Lightning Network either by running a node or by using a Lightning wallet. Here are our top picks:\n\nBitcoin Lightning Wallet on Android\n\nIf you don\u2019t want the full-node experience, you can download the Bitcoin Lightning Wallet app on your Android phone, which sorts everything out in the background. With this, you can open a Lightning channel and start making transactions with other users. It\u2019s also \u201cnon-custodial,\u201d meaning you look after your own keys\u2014keeping your Bitcoin in your hands. (We tried it out by paying for a taxi ride).\n\nRead our review of the Bitcoin Lightning Wallet.\n\nBlue Wallet on iOS and Android\n\nIf you want to use the Lightning Network but don\u2019t want to look after your own funds, Blue Wallet is a custodial service that runs a node for you. It allows you to send and receive Lightning payments, but doesn\u2019t let you withdraw your Bitcoin from the Lightning Network.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin full node\n\nTo get the full Lightning Network experience, you can try running a full node.\n\nSo what does this mean? Well, for a start, you\u2019re now supporting the Bitcoin network and the Lightning Network by checking that transactions are legitimate. It also means you can connect it to your computer and make transactions from your own node. This literally makes you your own bank; you are the only person owning and controlling your funds. Scary, huh?\n\nEclair Lightning Node\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling more ambitious, you could set up a full Lightning Node. This takes a lot more computer know-how. It means downloading Eclair onto your computer\u2014or a homemade Raspberry Pi\u2014and running it. You are then routing transactions on the network and can make your own transactions.\n\nEclair also offers a mobile version for Android users called Eclair Mobile. This is a stripped-down Lightning node, which means you stay in control of your Bitcoin. You can connect it to your own Eclair Lightning Node if you\u2019re running one. There\u2019s only one catch: You can\u2019t receive payments. Eclair explains why in this blog post. (TL;DR: It\u2019s safer and easier for them.)\n\nLightning Joule\n\nOnce you\u2019ve set up your own node, what next? Are you stuck with using a desktop app? Lightning Joule is a browser extension that lets you connect your Lightning Node to your browser so that you can easily make payments within Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Brave. It\u2019s a convenient hack.\n\nWhat can you do?\n\nFor a start, you can make payments to anyone else who has a Lightning wallet set up. But there\u2019s more to the Lightning Network: As a digital currency, it's easily integrated into websites without the need for third parties.\n\nAlthough the vast majority of crypto companies don\u2019t yet accept Lightning transactions, that figure is slowly growing. Nonetheless, a wide range of popular Lightning-capable platforms are currently operating, ranging from cryptocurrency exchanges like Bitfinex and MercuriEX to online retailers and merchants like Bitrefill, plus a wide range of casinos and other service providers.\n\nIf you are looking for somewhere local, then you might be able to find something nearby on Accept Lightning or on the Lightning Network Stores.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHere are some examples of things you can do with the Lightning Network:\n\nGet some satoshis with a Lightning Faucet\n\nYou can get some more Bitcoin. Faucets have long been a way to distribute small amounts of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and it\u2019s no different with the Lightning Network. This Lightning Faucet lets you test sending and receiving from a Lightning wallet; you can withdraw 14 satoshis at a time, which is just over $0.004.\n\nTip people in Satoshis on Twitter\n\nDo you wish social media was more rewarding? Well now it is. You can tip other people\u2014and they can tip you\u2014in Bitcoin using the Lightning Network. Simply integrate Tippin.me, and it puts a little lightning symbol on every tweet.\n\nYou will need your own wallet to send tips (see above). All the cool kids are doing it, including Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey.\n\nHow big is the network?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to grasp something that involves thousands of little parts, making millions of interactions with each other. It\u2019s a bit like trying to picture everything going on in your brain. So, to make this a bit easier, we have used a number of visual diagrams. This is what the Lightning Network looks like from above.\n\nA great resource for Lightning Network data is 1ML, a search and analysis engine. It provides data on which stores accept Lightning payments and information about current nodes. But it also features a spectacular visualization of the Lightning Network, showing all the nodes and how they are connected to one another. Check it out.\n\nEven the most remote nodes can connect to others on the network. Photo Credit: 1ML\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t trippy enough, here\u2019s a 3D view of the Lightning Network you can explore. And if you want to dive even deeper inside the network, you can don VR glasses to get the full experience.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nExplore the Lightning Network through a VR headset. Photo Credit: Lightning VR\n\nThis visualization makes the Lightning Network look like some kind of futuristic planet. This is the view from one person\u2019s node. The larger the areas, the more Bitcoin in the Lightning channels. Interestingly, the large blue area on the right is called \u201cDeutscheTestnetBank,\u201d whomever that might be.\n\nA globular view of the Lightning Network. Photo Credit: Bl.ocks\n\nThe current state of the Lightning Network\n\nThe Network faced its first major hijack on March 20, 2018, when a distributed denial of service attack took down around 200 Lightning nodes, about 20% of the network at the time\u2014the network struggled to process transactions. After preventative measures were put in place, it grew to reach a total of 7,000 nodes.\n\nSince then, the Lightning Network has continued to grow. As of July 2023, there are about 16,000 Lightning nodes and over 70,000 channels in operation. The total network capacity of the Lightning Network now sits at 3,815 BTC (or around $113.2 million at current values).\n\nEach Lightning node is responsible for interacting with the others to help transact money, while the channels are essentially the highways that enable money to be moved between nodes on the network. The more nodes and channels there are, the easier it is for larger transactions to complete successfully.\n\nThe future\n\nThe popularity of cryptocurrencies and transacting on them has, within just a few short years, put increasing stress on blockchains.\n\nWhile there have been smaller changes\u2014and in some cases forks\u2014to help networks better cope with demand, the Lightning Network, if successful, could help open the door to widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies and their applications.\n\nIn August 2020, the Lightning Network was updated to include support for the Wumbo function. In the early days of Lightning, the developers limited how much Bitcoin could be kept inside a Lightning payment channel to 0.1677 BTC; Wumbo channels enable nodes to service larger transactions at higher volumes.\n\nA growing number of crypto exchanges now support the Lightning Network, including Kraken, OKEx, Bitstamp and Bitfinex, as well as financial trading app Robinhood. However, two major exchanges, Binance and Coinbase, have yet to introduce support.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd in El Salvador, which in June 2021 passed legislation to make Bitcoin legal tender, vendors are using Lightning Network to facilitate small payments, while the state-sponsored Chivo wallet will also integrate Lightning Network. It's perhaps the first example of Bitcoin being used for widespread day-to-day transactions, and \"the first deployment of Lightning at this scale,\" according to the co-founder of AlphaPoint, a developer working on the Chivo wallet.\n\nIn April 2022, Lightning Labs raised $70 million to fund development of the Taro protocol, which will help to enable stablecoin transactions on Lightning Network.\n\nThe Lightning Network is spreading beyond Bitcoin, too. Blockstream has created its own implementation of the Lightning Network called c-Lightning, which is built in the C programming language, familiar to most developers. Litecoin has its own version, too\u2014the Litecoin Lightning Network\u2014which is small compared to the Bitcoin version, but slowly growing.\n\nFor more on the Lightning Network, check out Jameson Lopp\u2019s resources page here."

The visible part of the amendment reveals that the seed capital investor would buy this month.\n\nA seed capital investor initially funds an ETF to get it off the ground and trading on a stock exchange.\n\nBlackRock, which manages $9.5 trillion in assets, last week filed its amendment to the SEC. Applications for ETFs go through a number of drafts, which usually get amended and re-filed after feedback from the commission, before they\u2019re officially approved or rejected.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlackRock\u2019s seed capital investor section in the filing does not mean that the ETF will necessarily launch this month\u2014or even next month\u2014but experts spoke about the changes on Twitter.\n\nBalchunas said the section was \u201cnoteworthy\u201d after general partner at Van Buren Capital Scott Johnsson noted the change, claiming BlackRock \u201cmay be looking to seed with cash this month.\u201d\n\nSo two things caught my eye from the latest iShares (Blackrock) S-1 amendment:\n\n- They've obtained a CUSIP in prep for a launch\n\n- They may be looking to seed with cash this month (which is earlier than I would've thought, but may be nothing) pic.twitter.com/lMDaKxiIbB \u2014 Scott Johnsson (@SGJohnsson) October 23, 2023\n\nAn ETF is an investment vehicle that allows investors to buy shares that track the underlying price of an asset. A Bitcoin ETF would allow investors to get exposure to Bitcoin without having to deal with a crypto exchange or storing the digital coin themselves.\n\nRegulators have given the green light to Bitcoin futures ETFs which trade contracts betting on the future price of cryptocurrency but have rejected spot products.\n\nExperts now think that a Bitcoin ETF could get approved very soon; with some analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence saying that there is a 90% chance one will get approved in January.\n\nWall Street giant BlackRock applied for a Bitcoin ETF back in June\u2014sending the price of the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap soaring. The firm\u2019s CEO Larry Fink has since said that Bitcoin is an \u201cinternational asset\u201d and spoke of how crypto is \u201cdigitizing gold.\u201d\n\nOther major Wall Street players like VanEck, WisdomTree, and Valkyrie have also applied to the top regulator for such an investment vehicle.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome analysts have said that the approval of such a product would send the asset\u2019s price flying as new capital enters the crypto market. Others are more skeptical: crypto spot crypto ETFs already exist in Europe and Canada and haven\u2019t led to a huge influx of money into the space.\n\nBitcoin is currently trading for over $31,000 per coin, according to CoinGecko. That\u2019s nearly a 4% 24-hour rise. The asset is up significantly since the start of the year\u2014when it was trading for $16,615\u2014but still 55% lower than the all-time high of $69,044 it touched in November 2021.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "content": "The Bitcoin price went over $30,000 over the weekend to reach its highest point since mid-July. As part of this recent rally, crypto trader Carl From The Moon has shared his Bitcoin analysis, predicting the cryptocurrency is poised for a massive 37% rally that could send the price up to $41,000.\n\nAnalyst Carl From The Moon Predicts Bitcoin Price Rally\n\nBitcoin has been subject to many price predictions in recent months, particularly as the industry awaits the approval of applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Subsequently, Carl Runefelt, also known as Carl From The Moon, based his long-term analysis on a bullish run if these applications were approved.\n\nIn a new YouTube video, Carl points out that Bitcoin\u2019s price action has just completed a diamond pattern, and a big breakout move to the upside is imminent in the next 30 days.\n\nCarl sees a few factors indicating Bitcoin is ready to soar. First, the crypto formed an upside movement at the beginning of the year. Subsequently, a diamond pattern began to form around April on the weekly timescale. Now, Bitcoin is in a prime position to clear the $31,000 resistance level, which would surge the cryptocurrency 37% from its current price of around $30,000 up to $41,000.\n\n\u201cWhat we can see now is a massive, massive diamond pattern on the weekly timeframe. And if Bitcoin breaks up like this, then we could see Bitcoin go all the way up to $41,000, which would be absolutely insane, right?\u201d Carl said.\n\nFor now, Carl remains extremely bullish. Aside from his prediction, Carl also reflected on the current general sentiment of most Bitcoin traders for the near future. He does this by showing his leveraged long positions on different crypto exchanges while planning to add more when a spot Bitcoin ETF is approved.\n\n\u201cAny day now, the ETF will come out, and then we will wish that we had these long positions open,\u201d the crypto analyst said.\n\nCarl isn\u2019t the only analyst predicting high Bitcoin prices based on the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. Several other experts also think Bitcoin will spike in the coming months, with some giving higher price targets than others.\n\nFor example, crypto analyst Mags on social media platform X predicted a $70,000 price tag is foreseeable. A more optimistic prediction came from Ark Invest CEO Cathie Woods, who predicted $1.48 million for each Bitcoin based on increasing mainstream adoption.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $30,522, up by 9.86% in a 7-day timeframe. Most signs point to higher prices ahead, and many retail investors and heavyweights alike look to position themselves. Crypto whale transaction tracker Whale Alerts also recently revealed a massive 1,087 BTC withdrawal from crypto exchange Binance.US to a private wallet, suggesting there\u2019s accumulation taking place.\n\nBTC finds support at $30,500 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Analytics Insight, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

This enhancement strengthens Bitcoin\u2019s security against man-in-the-middle attacks, making it more secure.\n\nIt also improves censorship resistance and introduces pseudorandom byte strings, making it more difficult for eavesdropping and censorship attempts.\n\nIn addition, BIP324 enhances the initial connection security, addresses potential network attacks, and provides forward secrecy, which limits the malicious actors\u2019 access to past traffic. These upgrades significantly improve Bitcoin\u2019s security and privacy, making it more attractive to users and investors.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nBitcoin, trading under the BTC/USD pair, stands at a pivotal juncture on this October 6th. Currently, the cryptocurrency is priced at a significant $27,279, showcasing a determined movement within the last 24 hours.\n\nKey Trading Levels: The pivot point is currently identified at $27,279. Bitcoin faces immediate resistance at $27,873, with subsequent barriers awaiting at $28,460 and a formidable $29,997. Conversely, if the market faces selling pressure, Bitcoin could seek support at $26,798, followed by levels at $26,414 and $25,982.\n\nThe RSI is at 49 \u2013 indicating a nearly balanced market sentiment. The 50-day EMA is at $27,279, aligning with the pivot point.\n\nAny movement above it could signal a short-term bullish trend, while a dip below it might hint at bearish momentum.\n\nThe observed chart pattern suggests that the 50 EMA line might inspire buying interest. No significant news has come to light at this time that could influence Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nTo wrap up, the overarching sentiment for Bitcoin appears to be at a crossroads. It is bullish as long as the price remains above the $27,275 mark, but a slide below this could steer it into bearish territory.\n\nTraders and investors should keep a vigilant eye on the aforementioned key levels, as Bitcoin\u2019s journey will likely test these waters in the upcoming days.\n\nTop 15 Cryptocurrencies to Watch in 2023\n\nStay up-to-date with the world of digital assets by exploring our handpicked collection of the best 15 alternative cryptocurrencies and ICO projects to keep an eye on in 2023.\n\nOur list has been curated by professionals from Industry Talk and Cryptonews, ensuring expert advice and critical insights for your cryptocurrency investments.\n\nTake advantage of this opportunity to discover the potential of these digital assets and keep yourself informed.\n\nFind The Best Price to Buy/Sell Cryptocurrency\n\nCryptocurrency Price Tracker \u2013 Source: Cryptonews.com\n\nDisclaimer: Cryptocurrency projects endorsed in this article are not the financial advice of the publishing author or publication \u2013 cryptocurrencies are highly volatile investments with considerable risk, always do your own research."

        "content": "Bitcoin Price Prediction as BTC Smashes Past $27,000 Resistance \u2013 Best Time to Buy?\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, experienced a dip below the $28,000 mark in the early hours of Tuesday. The cryptocurrency had an exciting start to the week as it surged past the $28,000 threshold on Monday, marking its best performance since August.\n\nThis surge contributed to the overall crypto market cap reaching $1.09 trillion, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) leading the way in this impressive rally.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 #Bitcoin Update \ud83d\udcc9\n\n\n\nBitcoin bulls faced a slip at $28,600, with BTC now focused on $27,500. Despite the dip from six-week highs, traders remain calm. pic.twitter.com/JNT2RLgKUJ \u2014 PRDT Finance (@PRDT_Finance) October 3, 2023\n\nBTC has fallen below the $28,000 mark and is currently trading at $27,500, indicating a high level of market volatility.\n\nGiven the current uncertain macroeconomic conditions, it is expected that the markets will continue to be unstable in the coming weeks.\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stands at $1.09 trillion, with a 24-hour decline of nearly 2%.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Price Concerns Amid Recession Worries\n\nBitcoin has recently crossed the $28,000 mark, which is positive news. However, there are concerns in the cryptocurrency market. Bloomberg analyst, Mike McGlone, has raised some worries.\n\nHe believes that cryptocurrencies may be at risk of a recession, particularly due to their poor performance in the third quarter.\n\nThere are concerns about the digital asset world being in trouble. Some people are wondering if the current weakness is just a temporary issue or if it\u2019s a sign of a bigger problem.\n\nAccording to McGlone and several analysts, it\u2019s more likely the latter, which indicates that a recession for cryptocurrencies could be on the horizon.\n\nPositive Beta vs. Negative Liquidity \u2013 Cryptos Face Recession: #Crypto weakness in 3Q may be a recovery blip or a #recession leaning. Our bias is the latter, as almost all risk assets gained in 2023 and rolled over into the quarter. Most central banks are still tightening despite\u2026 pic.twitter.com/MaaZxhJdWL \u2014 Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) October 2, 2023\n\nAs a result, this news could negatively impact Bitcoin\u2019s price, as investors may become more cautious and hesitant, leading to selling pressure and a potential decline in BTC\u2019s value.\n\nUncertainty often prompts investors to seek safer assets, which may divert capital away from cryptocurrencies.\n\nOptimistic Sentiment and Potential for BTC\u2019s Price\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent climb above $28,000 has traders hoping for a return to $30,000, but it slipped back to $27,300. Despite this setback, market sentiment remains optimistic.\n\nSantiment\u2019s monthly report indicates the crypto community is bullish on Bitcoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies like LINK, AAVE, and ETH.\n\nAccording to Santiment, Bitcoin could reach $30,000 soon. Positive sentiment may attract buyers and prevent sharp declines, but it\u2019s important to monitor developments closely as Bitcoin\u2019s price remains volatile.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nUpon closer examination of Bitcoin\u2018s 4-hour chart, various significant price levels become apparent. The pivot point, a crucial metric, is fixed at $27,347. Bitcoin encounters resistance levels at $28,706, followed by $29,417 and $30,275.\n\nIn contrast, the immediate support for Bitcoin is located at $26,636, with additional support levels at $26,000 and $25,325.\n\nAnother notable metric is the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, which is currently valued at $27,000, indicating a bullish sign as Bitcoin\u2019s price is trading above this level.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nBitcoin is presenting a symmetrical triangle pattern in the chart patterns realm. At the $27,350 mark, the pattern culminates with a breakout. In the past, such breakouts have often signalled the beginning of bullish momentum, indicating that Bitcoin\u2019s rise may continue.\n\nTo summarize, Bitcoin\u2019s path appears to be strongly bullish. Investors may consider buying above $27,500, with targets set at $28,800 or $29,300.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that if Bitcoin struggles to surpass the $28,300 barrier, it may trigger a trend of selling.\n\nIn the coming days, Bitcoin appears ready to challenge the $28,800 resistance level. If the market remains favourable, there may be a realistic opportunity for Bitcoin to reach the $29,300 peak.\n\nTop 15 Cryptocurrencies to Watch in 2023\n\nStay up-to-date with the world of digital assets by exploring our handpicked collection of the best 15 alternative cryptocurrencies and ICO projects to keep an eye on in 2023.\n\nOur list has been curated by professionals from Industry Talk and Cryptonews, ensuring expert advice and critical insights for your cryptocurrency investments.\n\nTake advantage of this opportunity to discover the potential of these digital assets and keep yourself informed.\n\nFind The Best Price to Buy/Sell Cryptocurrency\n\nCryptocurrency Price Tracker \u2013 Source: Cryptonews.com\n\nDisclaimer: Cryptocurrency projects endorsed in this article are not the financial advice of the publishing author or publication \u2013 cryptocurrencies are highly volatile investments with considerable risk, always do your own research."

        "content": "Unlike previous cycles, the current heated market may lead to a correction.\n\nIf Bitcoin\u2019s price decreases, high liquidity and volatility might send it back to the upside.\n\nFollowing the price increase to $30,000, the Bitcoin [BTC] network has entered into a high-profit profit period. This information was disclosed by Alex Aldler Jr, a data analyst and Bitcoin research specialist.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the BTC Profit Calculator\n\nAlder, using the Bitcoin Realized Profit/Loss metric, showed that there have been a lot of profits made on-chain.\n\nA realized profit or loss occurs when a cryptocurrency is sold for a higher or lower price than it was purchased. When the difference between the total consideration and cost basis is positive, it implies a realized gain. On the other hand, a negative difference infers a realized loss.\n\nA hot market can\u2019t stop the switch\n\nAccording to the Bitcoin Realized Profit/Loss chart shared by the analyst, a lot of market players had made high gains. Historically, this hike was supposed to trigger a significant correction.\n\nHowever, Adler noted that it might not happen this cycle due to the FOMO around the spot ETF applications and possible approval.\n\nThe #Bitcoin network has entered a High Profit Level period. Previous entries into this level significantly slowed growth and led to market corrections. However, due to #ETF FOMO, this time things might be different.#btc pic.twitter.com/SH1VrnX160 \u2014 Axel ?? Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) October 22, 2023\n\nAlthough the U.S. SEC has made it clear that the approval may be delayed until next year, many are still optimistic that one of the numerous applications will get a go-ahead before 2023 ends.\n\nAs a result, market players have committed to staying active in the market. This resolute stance has also been crucial to the BTC price only retracing slightly in the last few days.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s liquidation levels data from HyblockCapital showed there were aggressive buying at $29,886.\n\nFor context, liquidation levels are estimates of potential price levels where the position of leverage traders could be closed after reaching initial margins. Also, the cumulative liquidation level delta showed that there has been a lot of pressure on the buy side.\n\nBTC may fall, but it\u2019s not the finish line\n\nAs a result, the price might fully retrace, creating a bearish bias in the process. Should Bitcoin fall to $29,000, and liquidity increase again in the market, then it could be a time to open more long positions.\n\nIn another post on X (formerly Twitter), Adler noted that active addresses may continue to increase on the Bitcoin network. This metric serves as a measure of crowd interaction around a coin.\n\nDuring the first quarter of the year, Bitcoin active addresses reached impressive levels. This led to high volatility while bringing gains for BTC holders.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nAlthough the analyst mentioned that the activity of the network has decreased compared to last week, he also noted that active addresses might resume their speculation soon due to the ETF FOMO.\n\nLast week there was a record in the number of transactions on the network; the volume was equivalent to the spike seen in April. Activity decreased over the weekend, but I don't think it will impact the FOMO associated with the potential approval of an ETF.#BTC pic.twitter.com/8cgfO915Ay \u2014 Axel ?? Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) October 22, 2023\n\nIf activity jumps again, then volatility may become extreme and BTC may break the $30,000 resistance. In a case where the volume follows in the upward direction, Bitcoin could significantly surge above the aforementioned resistance."

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A federal appeals court formalized a victory for Grayscale Investments LLC in its bid to create an exchange-traded fund based on Bitcoin over the objection of the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe move sends the matter back to the SEC. The mandate puts into effect the court\u2019s ruling in August, when it overturned the SEC\u2019s rejection of Grayscale\u2019s proposal to convert its trust into an ETF. Judge Neomi Rao called the SEC\u2019s decision \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d because the regulator failed to explain why it approved similar products. The SEC had argued that an ETF based on Bitcoin lacked adequate oversight to detect fraud.\n\n\u201cThe Grayscale team looks forward to continuing to work constructively with the SEC to convert GBTC to an ETF,\u201d Grayscale spokeswoman Jennifer Rosenthal said in a statement. \u201cGBTC is operationally ready, and we intend to move as expeditiously as possible on behalf of our investors.\u201d\n\nApproval of the ETFs is seen as a potential watershed moment by digital-asset advocates, who say broader access will lead to mainstream acceptance of what has been viewed by critics as a lightly regulated speculative niche. Industry scandals and bankruptcies such as the collapse of the FTX exchange helped to cut the estimated value of the sector by more than half since late 2021 to around $1 trillion. Bitcoin accounts for about half the total.\n\nBitcoin climbed above $31,000 on Monday for the first time since July amid expectations the mandate will help clear the path for an ETF.\n\nThe crypto market is closely watching efforts by asset managers to win approval for ETFs. Last week, Bitcoin briefly surged 10%, the highest price since August, on an erroneous report that BlackRock Inc. had won SEC approval for its long-awaited Bitcoin ETF. The move cooled after the world\u2019s biggest money manager said its application remains under review. BlackRock is among about a dozen firms seeking to offer the products.\n\nEarlier this month, the SEC decided against asking the appeals court to reconsider its ruling on Grayscale. The regulator doesn\u2019t intend to make any other appeals in the case, said a person familiar with the matter at the time.\n\nRead More: Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF Push: What\u2019s Next After Ruling Stands\n\nCrypto advocates cheered the decision by the appellate panel, which will open the door for the industry to tap billions of dollars from everyday investors. It also represents a setback in Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s push to clamp down on the crypto sector.\n\nGrayscale has said that a conversion of its trust to an ETF would let it easily create and redeem shares. The current closed-end structure doesn\u2019t let investors redeem shares when prices fall, which leads to trading a steep discounts compared to the underlying Bitcoin.\n\nThe discount on Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has narrowed significantly in anticipation of an ETF conversion. On Thursday, Grayscale filed an application for its Trust to list shares on NYSE Arca pending regulatory approval.\n\nThe likelihood and timing of spot ETF approvals remain in question. ETFs investing in futures on Ether \u2014 the second-largest token \u2014 debuted in the US in October, but failed to gain traction, a blow for arguments that crypto adoption is bound to expand. ETFs that hold Bitcoin futures were approved in 2021.\n\nThe case is Grayscale v. SEC, 22-1142, US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\n--With assistance from Dave Liedtka and Allyson Versprille.\n\n(Update with Grayscale comment.)\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P."

It started the week off with a drop from $1,575 to $1,550 before surging to test the $1,700 and failed to break through it, now trading at $1,675.\n\nThe past week started with positive headlines after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chose not to appeal a court decision reversing its denial of Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) becoming a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nIn August, a court in Washington ruled that the SEC was wrong to reject Grayscale\u2019s proposal to convert the fund into a spot Bitcoin ETF, which would make it simpler for investors to trade the digital currency.\n\nThe SEC did not appeal the court\u2019s decision, meaning the regulator will soon review Grayscale\u2019s application again. This case has been followed closely by the industry, which has been waiting for a decade for such products to be approved.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF would allow investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to manage their own private keys. Crypto market participants believe that such a product could help bring in mainstream investors into the space. Over the week, Grayscale submitted a new application for a spot ETF.\n\nThe SEC also notably dropped its claims that Ripple\u2019s CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Executive Chairman Chris Larsen, helped the fintech firm break federal securities laws by selling XRP, ending a trial that was set for next year.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s changing attitude saw the discount on Grayscale\u2019s GBTC diminish by 14.8% in October, to its lowest level since December 2021. The discount narrowed as GBTC outperformed BTC amid hopes it could be allowed to become a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nMeanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) Governing Council has announced plans to \u201cbegin building the groundwork for the potential issuance of a digital euro\u201d by starting a \u201cpreparation phase\u201d that follows a two-year investigation.\n\nThe ECB said the new phase will commence on November 1, and added that a final decision on issuing a digital currency from the central bank has not been made.\n\nBinance stops accepting new UK users\n\nLeading cryptocurrency exchange Binance has said that it will stop taking new users from the U.K. to follow the country\u2019s rules on crypto advertising. The company said that its users who have passed the \u201cInvestor Declaration and Appropriateness Test\u201d can still use its services, but they will not be able to access any new products and services.\n\nThe new rules, which came into effect on October 8, allow firms that are registered with the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to approve their own ads. Alternatively, companies can seek approval from authorised entities for their ads, a path other cryptocurrency exchanges use to remain compliant.\n\nWhile Binance partnered with a peer-to-peer platform called Rebuildingsociety.com, the FCA said the firm wasn\u2019t authorised to approve crypto ads.\n\nGM to new users who are wants to join in @binance UK \ud83d\udc38\n\n\n\nNew UK user sign-ups are suspended by Binance due to regulatory \ud83e\uddd0 pic.twitter.com/niHvgMnViP \u2014 DMT\ud83d\udc10 (@DMTLAND_) October 17, 2023\n\nOver the week, Binance\u2019s American entity, Binance.US, also updated its terms to reflect that the US dollar funds users have on the platform are no longer protected by deposit insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The exchange also halted U.S. dollar withdrawals.\n\nReddit to shut down blockchain-based community points feature\n\nThe week also saw Reddit announced a phase-out of its blockchain-powered Community Points, which are distinct blockchain tokens allocated to members of its r/CryptoCurrency, r/Ethtrader, and r/FortniteBR communities.\n\nThe disclosure, made by a Reddit staffer on the site, triggered a notable sell-off of the tied tokens \u2013 encompassing r/CryptoCurrency\u2019s Moons, r/FortniteBR\u2019s Bricks, and r/Ethtrader\u2019s Donuts. Some on Reddit pointed out transactions that took place shortly before the disclosure, suspecting them to be dubious.\n\nThe discontinuation of Community Points is scheduled for November 8, due to Reddit\u2019s expressed challenges in scaling this feature broadly across the platform, coupled with a regulatory climate that further \u201cadded to scalability limitations\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, the main entity behind leading decentralized cryptocurrency exchange Uniswap, Uniswap Labs, introduced a 0.15% fee on trades involving tokens like ETH and USDC on the front end of the exchange it controls.\n\nThe fee is distinct from the \u201cprotocol fee\u201d overseen by governance votes and is meant to support Uniswap Labs\u2019 operations.\n\nFrancisco Memoria is a content creator at CryptoCompare who\u2019s in love with technology and focuses on helping people see the value digital currencies have.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) surged to a three-month high during the first trading session in Asia on October 23, igniting hopes of a substantial rally among investors.\n\nWhile this upswing has indeed rekindled confidence in the pioneer cryptocurrency, there is a strong to remain cautious, according to an October 22 post by prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez.\n\nTechnical indicators point to a trend reversal\n\nIn his analysis, Martinez said BTC appears to be facing an \u201cimpending price correction,\u201d following the latest rally unless it can print a daily candlestick close above $31,560.\n\nThere are two main indicators pointing at a potential reversal \u2013 a head and shoulders pattern, and the relative strength index (RSI).\n\nAs can be observed from the chart below, Bitcoin\u2019s price may be forming the head and shoulders pattern, which is considered a reliable indicator of a trend reversal, usually from bullish (upward) to bearish (downward) or vice versa.\n\nHead and Shoulders pattern and RSI on Bitcoin chart. Source Ali Martinez\n\nGiven that Bitcoin is currently in an uptrend, a bearish reversal may be on the horizon.\n\nMoreover, Martinez highlighted the RSI level at 74.21, which has consistently acted as a trigger for sharp corrections since March. In the wake of the recent rally, Bitcoin has once again reached this 74.21 RSI level, intensifying the indications of a potential price correction.\n\nFurther reinforcing the prospects of a correction is the TD Sequential indicator, which is hinting \u201cat a possible sell signal\u201d that may emerge on October 23, said the expert.\n\n\n\nIn a separate tweet, he said the looming correction could push BTC as low as $28,630.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAt the time of publication, BTC was changing hands at $30,622, up 2.6% in the past 24 hours.\n\nBTC 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nThe maiden cryptocurrency rose more than 8% over the past week and over 15% on the month, adding around $80 billion in market cap during this period.\n\nThe new upturn appears to be driven by growing speculations that the long-awaited spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) may be approved by year-end. These rumors brought a fresh wave of optimism among cryptocurrency investors as such approval would bring more institutional players into the crypto space and act as a significant price catalyst.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
