        "title": "Gary Gensler on Meeting With SBF and His Crypto Crackdown - New York Magazine",
        "content": "Photo: Shuran Huang/The New York Times\n\nAs recently as a year ago, Sam Bankman-Fried seemed to be an unstoppable force in official Washington. The conspicuously disheveled founder and CEO of FTX had positioned himself as a new sort of billionaire and crypto entrepreneur \u2014 someone who promised to do good with his extraordinary wealth, who had publicly discussed supporting Democratic political candidates to the tune of a billion dollars in upcoming elections, and who seemed to offer the possibility of legitimizing an industry that had grown exponentially during the pandemic while operating on the fringes of America\u2019s financial regulatory apparatus.\n\nBy last March, things appeared to be going exceptionally well for Bankman-Fried as he prepared for a private meeting with Gary Gensler, the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We now know that Bankman-Fried was in the midst of executing a dual-pronged political and media strategy that looks to have been one of the most ambitious political-influence operations in recent memory. He was testifying before Congress about how to regulate crypto markets, and behind closed doors, he was successfully lobbying for a bill that would have enacted a system that was very beneficial to him. Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried was schmoozing with (and offering money to) a group of self-styled policy professionals and political pundits whose unofficial seal of approval conferred an aura of intellectual seriousness on his project.\n\nAt the time of his meeting with Gensler, Bankman-Fried was in the process of acquiring a stake in the stock exchange IEX, and he was joined by a group of FTX and IEX representatives to pitch a new SEC-approved crypto-trading platform. They included a top FTX lawyer who had worked with Gensler and who, in private, had reportedly bragged about his access to \u201cGary.\u201d This meeting was coming on the heels of a dinner Bankman-Fried arranged with the SEC\u2019s incoming general counsel, Dan Berkovitz. (Berkowitz recently stepped down.)\n\nBut things did not go as planned for the FTX and IEX crew at that meeting last March. They were evidently seeking agency approval for a so-called \u201calternative trading system,\u201d a more lightly regulated alternative to national securities exchanges. Gensler, in his telling, sharply rebuffed the group.\n\n\u201cI indicated to them they could take their slide deck down on the second slide,\u201d Gensler told me during a recent and wide-ranging conversation, \u201cand that I didn\u2019t think that they should \u2014 with all respect \u2014 that it was not a valuable use of their time.\u201d\n\nAccording to Gensler, FTX was far too conflicted to satisfy the agency\u2019s regulations. He said that he told the group \u201cthat alternative trading systems were something amongst and for institutional investors\u201d and that \u201cjust coming into compliance was going to need them to disaggregate their business to address the conflicts \u2014 that they should have a separate exchange, separate broker-dealer, separate custody, and that they were in the national security exchange Zip Code, not in the ATS Zip Code.\u201d (The outcome of the meeting was first reported by the New York Times.)\n\nIt was not the first time that Gensler met with Bankman-Fried and other FTX representatives \u2014 there was also a previously disclosed session in late 2021 \u2014 but when we spoke, it was unclear whether there had been any other meetings between the two men, which might raise further questions among the public about Bankman-Fried\u2019s access to U.S. regulators. Gensler\u2019s calendars for 2022 have not yet been fully released, so questions on this front have persisted.\n\nSo were there any other meetings between the two? \u201cNo,\u201d Gensler quickly responded when I put the question to him directly.\n\nGensler\u2019s brushback last March may have helped to limit the extraordinary fallout in the sector last year, though of course, plenty of people have been caught without their coats in the harsh and unsparing deep freeze of crypto winter. Retail investors have lost extraordinary sums, there has been a wave of large crypto bankruptcies, and evidence of rampant fraud in the industry, which was already abundant, continues to accumulate.\n\nIt is also eminently reasonable to ask whether the SEC could \u2014 and should \u2014 have done more to crack down on the industry before now. It is, after all, comparatively easy to aggressively go after companies or their principals after their businesses have been exposed by the press or competitors as financially unsound or perhaps even fundamentally fraudulent enterprises, and given the publicly available information, it is fair to question whether the SEC should have pursued concerns about the industry more quickly and assertively than it did in recent years.\n\nThe political fallout from the implosion of FTX and the criminal indictment of Bankman-Fried is far from over. It has embarrassed prominent figures throughout Washington. Whether it will have any implications for Gensler, by all accounts an ambitious player in the Biden administration, is still an open question.\n\nIt all occurred at a precarious time for him. He was already under fire for an ambitious regulatory agenda that had drawn the ire of Wall Street and generated internal frustration among SEC staff, and some of the same members of Congress who criticized Gensler last year for investigating the industry too aggressively, including New York congressman Ritchie Torres and Minnesota representative Tom Emmer, have since sought to blame Gensler for the FTX disaster.\n\nMeanwhile, there have been reports since last summer suggesting the possibility of a change of leadership at the Treasury Department, where Secretary Janet Yellen has had to deal with widespread public anxiety over inflation. Gensler began his career in government service at Treasury in the late 1990s after nearly two decades at Goldman Sachs, and there have been slight rumblings, which have made their way into the financial press, that Gensler might be interested in leading the department if Yellen decides to leave at some point in the coming years, particularly if Biden is reelected.\n\nAll of this raises the stakes for the 65-year-old, as he mounts a public defense of the SEC\u2019s record on crypto regulation and enforcement, including during our discussion. We talked about how the industry tried to outmaneuver Congress and the country\u2019s financial regulators, as well as how crypto markets should be regulated, but Gensler also made clear that he has been grappling with the same question as many of the rest of us: What, exactly, is the point of crypto?\n\nFrom the vantage point of today, it is clear that Bankman-Fried was very close to building what has been fairly described as a \u201cregulatory moat\u201d around FTX \u2014 locking in a role for himself and his company at the top of the crypto industry. The legislation that he backed, called the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act, would have given the Commodity Futures Trading Commission authority to regulate certain crypto products \u2014 specifically, bitcoin, ether, and other vaguely identified \u201cdigital commodities\u201d \u2014 and displaced the SEC\u2019s jurisdiction in the area. It was an ambitious but straightforward strategy of domestic regulatory arbitrage that would have effectively allowed the company to pick its own regulator in the U.S. (Though, of course, the March meeting with Gensler shows that Bankman-Fried was looking for regulatory buy-in from all relevant agencies.)\n\nFairly or not, the CFTC is generally regarded as a more pliant and less assertive financial regulator than the SEC. It was therefore not that surprising when the head of the CFTC disclosed that Bankman-Fried had met with him and other senior officials at the agency ten times over roughly the year leading up to the collapse of the FTX, despite concerns raised in real time by commodities specialists.\n\n\u201cI love the CFTC,\u201d said Gensler, who ran the agency during the Obama administration, as we touched on these uncomfortable facts, implicating some of his former and current colleagues. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get me to say anything negative about\u201d the CFTC, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s just too \u2014 it\u2019s in my blood.\u201d\n\nStill, he was unsparing in his assessment of the merits of the legislative effort, which was spearheaded in the Senate by Michigan Democrat Debbie Stabenow. The bill, Gensler told me, would have \u201cunambiguously undermined investor protection\u201d thanks to the vague legislative text that was on the table. \u201cWe live in a world where Amazon stock and U.S. treasuries are already digital,\u201d Gensler explained. \u201cSo many of the bills, literally, you could take the $24 trillion treasury market, put it on a blockchain ledger, and take it outside of the current regime\u201d of federal regulation. (This may sound a bit dry in Gensler\u2019s phrasing, but to be clear, it would be a radical and crazy outcome.)\n\nThe new Congress is looking again at crypto-specific legislation, but Gensler believes that the SEC has all of the legal tools that it needs. Over the course of our discussion, he articulated a straightforward view of the agency\u2019s reach \u2014 that pretty much every sort of crypto transaction already falls under the SEC\u2019s jurisdiction except spot transactions in bitcoin itself and the actual purchase or sale of goods or services with cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cEverything other than bitcoin,\u201d Gensler told me, \u201cyou can find a website, you can find a group of entrepreneurs, they might set up their legal entities in a tax haven offshore, they might have a foundation, they might lawyer it up to try to arbitrage and make it hard jurisdictionally or so forth.\u201d In other words, there are people behind these cryptocurrencies using a variety of complex and legally opaque mechanisms, but at the most basic level, they are trying to promote their tokens and entice investors. (Bitcoin, because of its unique history and creation story, is fundamentally different from other crypto projects in this respect.)\n\n\u201cThey might drop their tokens overseas at first and contend or pretend that it\u2019s going to take six months before they come back to the U.S.,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut at the core,\u201d he argued, \u201cthese tokens are securities because there\u2019s a group in the middle and the public is anticipating profits based on that group.\u201d The claim that crypto investors are hoping to profit based on the efforts of those intermediaries \u2014 in much the same way that stockholders in public companies hope to see their investments appreciate over time \u2014 is central to Gensler\u2019s position that, as a legal matter, these are actually transactions in securities that fall within the SEC\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nAs a matter of securities law, Gensler\u2019s view is not that hard to understand, though it is still being tested in the courts. The agency racked up a significant win last November, but there are other pending legal rulings that are eagerly awaited by industry observers, and there is a well-resourced crypto lobby that is not likely to back down anytime soon.\n\nFor now, the SEC has emerged as the industry\u2019s primary civil regulator, whether crypto advocates like it or not \u2014 but there are still plenty of big questions about what the agency has been up to in recent years and what its current enforcement strategy will actually achieve. Arguably the federal government\u2019s actions \u2014 including those of the SEC \u2014 didn\u2019t do much to prevent the loss of trillions of dollars in value over the last year, potentially impacting tens of millions of Americans who hold crypto assets in some form.\n\nGensler was extremely diplomatic about it when we spoke, but a large part of this mess is attributable to the Trump administration\u2019s extremely lax approach to financial fraud and regulation, as well as the credulousness of the industry\u2019s supporters in Congress. \u201cIn terms of policy-makers around the globe,\u201d Gensler explained, \u201cyou had this ascendancy in the crypto market during the COVID period and low interest rates,\u201d during which time the market grew \u201cfrom $250 billion to $3 trillion.\u201d\n\nCapitol Hill was also an important player in the mess. Many members of Congress \u2014 \u201cgood faith, hardworking members of Congress,\u201d Gensler was quick to add \u2014 felt compelled to meet with industry advocates and hear them out about the supposed financial revolution that they were ushering in. According to Gensler, members of Congress \u201cwere hearing about crypto increasingly because the retail public was also caught up\u201d thanks to things like Super Bowl advertising and support from celebrities like Kim Kardashian. In the downturn that followed, Gensler\u2019s agency has brought charges against various high-profile crypto opportunists, including Kardashian, who settled an enforcement action last October.\n\nGensler has said that the \u201croadway\u201d or \u201crunway\u201d for crypto firms that are not registered with the SEC is \u201cgetting shorter,\u201d but the metaphor is an odd one. The planes are already in the air, so the agency is really trying to ground them.\n\nThat explains a series of significant moves by the agency since the start of the year \u2014 including a major enforcement action against two prominent crypto firms based on an unregistered crypto asset lending program; a recent settlement with a crypto exchange based on an industry practice known as \u201cstaking\u201d; and notice of a potential enforcement action against a stablecoin issuer whose product is affiliated with Binance.\n\nGensler broadly referred to these kinds of firms, which seem to differ endlessly in their offerings and corporate structures, as \u201cstorefronts\u201d that are providing services to the public \u201cin a way that\u2019s commingled and is rife with conflicts.\u201d He argued that many of them combine functions that would have to be legally disaggregated in traditionally regulated markets, including roles that would ordinarily be separated among some combination of exchanges, lenders, market-makers, broker-dealers, investment advisers, and custodians.\n\n\u201cThe conflicts in these storefronts,\u201d Gensler told me, \u201cwe do not allow in traditional finance, we don\u2019t allow in the securities markets, we don\u2019t allow it in the commercial banking markets, and we don\u2019t allow it in crypto because these storefronts are fundamentally and generally noncompliant with the securities laws as we know them.\u201d He argued that network effects have made \u201ca small handful of storefronts\u201d particularly important, but \u201cwhether they call themselves lending or staking as a service or exchanges, they\u2019re bringing together millions of customers.\u201d\n\nOn its face, the idea that an increase in SEC registrations and filings from crypto companies will somehow markedly improve the integrity and resilience of this market seems dubious. Last February, the crypto lender BlockFi agreed to register with the SEC at the agency\u2019s urging, paid a $100 million fine, and then went bankrupt in November. The stark turn of events seemed to reflect, at least in part, the fact that the underlying crypto asset class is both novel and unstable, and that this is not an industry with consistent and widely accepted valuation, marking, or disclosure conventions.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, the implosion of BlockFi seemed to reflect the legal and practical limits of the SEC\u2019s strategy to force more crypto firms to register with the agency. That is because companies that register with the SEC may have to satisfy more detailed and burdensome disclosure requirements, but that does not mean that those companies or their business models will magically become more stable or financially sound.\n\nThe unstated premise of the SEC\u2019s current enforcement push appears to be that if the government can broadly stigmatize the industry and market participants, then ordinary people \u2014 the retail investors all over the world who have gotten swept up in the crypto frenzy of recent years \u2014 might think long and hard about whether to hold these assets in any form. It is a message that federal regulators recently delivered directly to the banking industry, warning them not to issue or hold any crypto assets because doing so would be \u201chighly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.\u201d\n\nI asked Gensler whether federal regulators with consumer-facing responsibilities should send a comparable message to retail investors, but he gently resisted. \u201cI\u2019m in a job where I\u2019m supposed to be merit neutral in terms of what risk investors want to take,\u201d he told me at one point, \u201cbut not neutral towards the investor protection \u2014 the full, fair, and truthful disclosure you get when you\u2019re investing in a security.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most telling answer I got from Gensler over the course of our discussion was when I asked him to explain the legitimate use case for crypto: What is the actual point of this new sector, and could it actually provide a valuable economic or financial service for ordinary people and the global economy?\n\nGensler was careful to draw a sharp distinction between two types of supposed innovations promoted by crypto\u2019s earliest advocates. The first is the idea of a distributed accounting ledger \u2014 the blockchain technology that came into the world with Bitcoin\u2019s invention \u2014 that is in theory more transparent, accessible, and resilient against theft and cyberattacks than centralized ledgers. Gensler clearly admired the technical creation. \u201cI personally think it\u2019s very rare that you need that, but it\u2019s possible,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a real innovation.\u201d\n\nThe second, of course, is the notion that cryptocurrencies might actually provide a useful store of value or alternative payment mechanism, and on that point, Gensler appeared to be much less impressed.\n\n\u201cHistory tells us throughout \u2014 through antiquity to now \u2014 that economies coalesce around one monetary unit,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a network effect to having one unit that we humans accept as a medium of exchange and unit of account \u2014 a store of value \u2014 one unit. The two things governments do since Genghis Khan,\u201d he observed, \u201cis basically say, \u2018This is what\u2019s accepted for your taxes, and it\u2019s accepted for all debts, public and private.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much economic use for a micro-currency, and we haven\u2019t seen one in centuries,\u201d Gensler said. \u201cMost of these tokens will fail, because the question is about these economics. What\u2019s the \u2018there\u2019 there?\u201d\n\nIt was a diplomatic answer for someone who is tasked with reigning in a well-funded and well-lawyered industry that many people believe is generally useless and economically wasteful. Here is a simpler way of thinking about it if you are an ordinary investor who bought \u201cshitcoins\u201d in recent years, perhaps because of the celebrity endorsements, the high-profile ads, or plain-old fear of missing out: Get out while you can."

        "title": "CashApp and Square push Block\u2019s year-over-year gross profit up 40% as Bitcoin sales lag - Fortune",
        "content": "Online payments giant Block reported on Thursday strong growth in revenue and gross profit in the fourth quarter, as the main stalwarts of its business, digital wallet CashApp and business payments platform Square, showed large gains.\n\nThe company posted $1.66 billion in gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2022, an almost 40% increase from nearly $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. Revenue was $4.65 billion, a jump from $4.1 billion in the same quarter of 2021. CashApp and Square drove most of those gains, as CashApp posted a staggering 64% jump in year-over-year gross profit, and Square had 22%.\n\nIn after-hours trading, share prices rose approximately 8% percent from $74 to $80.\n\nThe company reported quarterly earnings per share of 22 cents, compared with an estimate of 30 cents per share by analysts polled by FactSet. Block, however, beat predictions on revenue and gross profit.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead to 2023 and beyond, we are focused on balancing growth and efficiency and will prioritize speed, agility, and accountability,\u201d Block CEO Jack Dorsey and CFO Amrita Ahuja wrote in a letter to shareholders.\n\nThe outlook, however, for the company\u2019s dive into Bitcoin was more tepid. Block invested $220 million in Bitcoin in 2020 and 2021, but the company\u2019s Bitcoin holdings were valued at just $133 million at the end of 2022.\n\nIts Bitcoin trading business on CashApp also declined. Total fourth-quarter revenue from Bitcoin sales on CashApp was $1.83 billion, down from $1.96 billion in the same quarter in 2021, and its year-over-year gross profits from the cryptocurrency decreased from approximately $46 million to $35 million, a mere fraction of Block\u2019s total gross profit.\n\nIn 2018, Dorsey, a notable Bitcoin evangelist, announced that CashApp users would be able to buy and sell Bitcoin through the digital wallet. And more than two years later, the company, formerly known as Square, made significant investments in the cryptocurrency. To signify his company\u2019s devotion to crypto, Dorsey then announced that the payments titan would be changing its name to Block. Since then, he has continued to double down on Bitcoin.\n\nDorsey announced the creation of TBD, a Block subsidiary that soon released a white paper detailing plans for the construction of a decentralized Bitcoin trading exchange. After the fall of FTX, Block also announced that it\u2019s developing a new wallet to allow its customers to hold Bitcoin themselves, rather than having tokens handled by third parties. And the company has even recently invested in a Bitcoin mining firm that says it is trying to bring cheap energy to places like Kenya and Malawi."

        "title": "Bitcoin vs. Altcoins: Comparing Investment Opportunities and Risks - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have grown in popularity as an investment option in recent years. Although Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency, there are numerous other digital currencies known as 'altcoins' that provide a variety of investment opportunities and risks.\n\nWe will compare Bitcoin and altcoins in this article to help investors make informed decisions about their crypto investments.\n\nBitcoin Is the Original Cryptocurrency\n\nBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, created in 2009 by an unknown individual or group of individuals known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin is decentralized, which means that no government or financial institution controls it. Transactions are recorded on a public ledger known as the blockchain, which is maintained by a global network of computers.\n\nBitcoin Investment Possibilities\n\nFor years, Bitcoin has been the most popular and well-known cryptocurrency, making it a popular investment option. Bitcoin has steadily increased in value over the years, reaching an all-time high of nearly $65,000 in 2021.\n\nKeep Reading Social Media Reward Coins: A Catalyst for Widespread Crypto Adoption\n\nThe value of Bitcoin is primarily determined by demand, and it is widely accepted as a payment method by many merchants around the world.\n\nRisks\n\nBitcoin is a volatile asset, with rapid fluctuations in value. Aside from market volatility, there are risks associated with technology itself. Because Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, there is no way to recover your funds if you send Bitcoin to the wrong address or fall victim to a scam.\n\nFurthermore, due to the lack of regulation surrounding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, investors have little protection in the event of fraud or hacking.\n\nAltcoins: A Wide Range of Options\n\nAlternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, are any digital currencies other than Bitcoin. There are thousands of altcoins, each with its own set of characteristics and applications. Ethereum, Binance Coin, Cardano, and Dogecoin are among the most popular altcoins.\n\nAltcoin Investment Possibilities\n\nAltcoins provide alternative investment opportunities to Bitcoin. Some altcoins are intended to be more efficient or functional than Bitcoin, whereas others are intended for specific applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) or non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Some altcoins, such as Ethereum, have seen significant growth in recent years and have the potential for future gains.\n\nRisks\n\nInvesting in altcoins entails the same risks as investing in Bitcoin, such as market volatility and technological risks. Furthermore, because altcoins are not as widely accepted as Bitcoin, there is less liquidity, making it more difficult to buy or sell altcoins at a reasonable price.\n\nFurthermore, because there are so many altcoins to choose from, determining which ones have long-term potential and which are scams or have no real value can be difficult.\n\nBitcoin and Altcoin Comparison\n\nThere are several factors to consider when comparing Bitcoin and altcoins:\n\nAdoption\n\nBitcoin is the most widely used cryptocurrency, with many merchants accepting it and many investors using it as a store of value. While some altcoins have gained popularity, none are as well-known as Bitcoin.\n\nVolatility\n\nAlthough Bitcoin is a volatile asset, some altcoins are even more so. It is critical to be prepared for rapid price fluctuations when investing in altcoins.\n\nCase Studies\n\nThe primary application of Bitcoin is as a store of value and a means of payment. Altcoins have a diverse set of use cases, ranging from DeFi to NFTs, so it is critical to research each altcoin's specific use case and potential.\n\nTechnology\n\nBitcoin is a well-established technology with a large and active developer community. Some altcoins have innovative technologies, but it is critical to investigate the technical details to determine whether they are viable and secure.\n\nShould I Buy Altcoins? Are Altcoins a Safe Investment or Pure Speculation?\n\nMany have wondered if altcoins are a safe investment. Over the past few years, altcoins have come and gone while BTC remains as the 'one true king of cryptocurrencies'.\n\nIn fact, there are many Bitcoin maximalists who believe BTC is the only investment one should have in the crypto universe as it will probably be the only digital currency which we\u2019ll need in the future. However, even if they believe that they might be on the right side of things in the long term, for now, surprisingly, they might be missing the forest for the trees.\n\nThe simple fact is that altcoins can be seen in many different ways and through many different lenses.\n\nEach altcoin has its own underlying projects, its problem that is trying to solve within the cryptocurrency landscape, and so forth.\n\nAs such, one can think of an altcoin as a long-term investment and buy them as an investor who believes in its project, or, as many do, as a short-term speculative investment.\n\nRegardless of your reasons, there are certain elements that you do need to be concerned about.\n\nFirst and foremost, you should define how much of your investment portfolio is going to be allocated to altcoin investment.\n\nFollowing that, it is important to do your own due diligence and thoroughly understand what the project is, what it is trying to do, and who the team is behind accomplishing said goals.\n\nFollowing that reputation risk assessment, it is also important to follow through with a market access risk analysis, meaning that you will want to stay clear of obscure coins which aren\u2019t sold on reputable exchanges.\n\nLastly, it is extremely important that you understand the technical risk behind your potential altcoin investment, namely its code and if it has been audited by a credible third party.\n\nSo, in short, yes, altcoins can present themselves as incredible investment opportunities if approached with care and proper due diligence.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies, whether Bitcoin or altcoins, entails risks as well as rewards. Because of Bitcoin's dominance as the original cryptocurrency, it is a safer and more stable investment, whereas altcoins offer higher potential returns but at a higher risk.\n\nBefore investing, it is critical to understand the various investment opportunities and risks associated with each cryptocurrency.\n\nOne of the most significant benefits of cryptocurrencies is their decentralization, which means they are not controlled by the government or central banks. However, because they are not backed by tangible assets or government guarantees, they are a more speculative investment.\n\nWhen investing in cryptocurrencies, it's critical to understand the underlying technology and fundamentals that drive their value. It's also critical to stay current on market news and regulatory developments, as these can have a significant impact on cryptocurrency value.\n\nTo summarize, Bitcoin and altcoins provide distinct investment opportunities and risks, and investors should carefully consider their investment objectives and risk tolerance before investing in either.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is a safer and more stable investment, altcoins offer higher potential returns but at a higher risk. Investors can navigate the complex world of cryptocurrencies and potentially reap the benefits with careful research and a long-term investment strategy."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) can hit $10 million per coin or more as it eats 25% of the global wealth, new analysis has concluded.\n\nIn a blog post released on Feb. 16, fund manager and Bitcoin expert advisor Jesse Myers revealed his own \u201coutrageous\u201d BTC price target.\n\nMyers: \u201cBitcoin could 500x over the coming decades\u201d\n\nBitcoin may struggle with \u201cbrutal\u201d volatility, but hodlers and critics alike should be in no doubt about its long-term price trajectory, Myers said.\n\nAnalyzing Bitcoin\u2019s value proposition, he argues that Bitcoin\u2019s ability to appreciate over time means that it is all but destined to suck in value from other asset classes.\n\nAmong other reasons, this is because an asset with such appreciation characteristics and increasing scarcity allows it to fulfill the role of \u201cdigital gold.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin has an unthinkable property: it gets more valuable over time. Gold is good at storing purchasing power, but Bitcoin grows purchasing power,\u201d the blog post reads.\n\n\u201cValue stored in Bitcoin becomes worth more over time because of Bitcoin\u2019s design of increasing scarcity \u2014 you just have to outlast the (admittedly brutal) volatility along the way.\u201d\n\nSuch an idea is not new \u2014 it forms the core thesis of many popular takes on Bitcoin, among them Saifedean Ammous\u2019 seminal book, The Bitcoin Standard.\n\nGetting down to the numbers, meanwhile, Myers calculated the global allocation into BTC as 0.05% of available wealth as of 2023 \u2014 $400 billion.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s 1/2000th of global asset value,\u201d the post continues.\n\n\u201cWith that in mind, we have to ask ourselves an important question: when Bitcoin\u2019s mechanics continue to play out (causing it to continue appreciating reliably in value every 4 years), will more than 0.05% of the world\u2019s capital eventually realize it wants to be in an asset like that? I think the only logical conclusion is \u2018yes.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat realization, Myers forecasts, means that $10 million per Bitcoin should be a \u201cconservative estimate.\u201d\n\n\u201cOverall, my personal assessment of where the ceiling is for Bitcoin is simple\u2026 it\u2019s very high. Almost to the point that I\u2019m embarrassed to show my analysis,\u201d he concludes.\n\n\u201cMy conservative estimates suggest an outrageous full potential for Bitcoin\u2019s price: $10m/Bitcoin, in today\u2019s dollars. To put this another way, I believe Bitcoin\u2019s full potential is to eat ~25% of the world\u2019s value\u2026 while today it constitutes just 0.05%. That\u2019s absurd. That means that I believe Bitcoin could 500x over the coming decades, in real (inflation-adjusted) terms.\u201d\n\nMacro asset comparison graphic (screenshot). Source: Jesse Myers/Substack\n\nARK Bitcoin \u201cbear case\u201d now $258,000 by 2030\n\n\u201cAbsurd\u201d or not, Myers is far from alone in eyeing sky-high Bitcoin price valuations coming true in the coming decades.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin must leverage $1T central bank liquidity to beat sellers \u2014 Research\n\nSome are even calling for the $1-million mark to hit before the end of this one \u2014 ARK Invest, for example, continued to stick by that very prediction throughout the 2022 bear market declines.\n\nIn its \u201cBig Ideas 2023\u201d outlook released at the end of January, the investment giant described long-term opportunity as \u201cstrengthening.\u201d\n\nThe firm\u2019s \u201cbear case\u201d for 2030, it revealed, still puts BTC/USD at $258,000 by the end of the decade.\n\nBitcoin growth forecast data (screenshot).

        "content": "Switzerland has long been synonymous with financial innovation, and Lugano now joins the race to become a hub for blockchain technology development. Above all, the city seeks to give a powerful boost to the adoption of cryptoassets to buy goods and services. Lugano thus aims to become the acknowledged cryptocurrency capital of Europe.\n\nDemonstrating the city's commitment to fostering blockchain technology ideas and startups, Lugano's Plan \u20bf is designed to decentralize the bitcoin network and support sustainable cryptocurrency mining facilities in the region.\n\nTo make this vision a reality, attract talent and encourage networking and knowledge-sharing, the city will actively support R&D and relevant projects at its business hub. The goal is to extend the use of blockchain technology throughout the city to improve all aspects of residents\u2019 day-to-day lives. Announced a few months ago by the mayor of Lugano, Michele Foletti, the pilot program could be key to the ultimate success and further development of bitcoin, as it is the first credible attempt by a city to adopt a digital currency for regular use.\n\nSwitzerland is a country where blockchain technology and banking go hand in hand: the city of Zug is home to the Crypto Valley Association, an independent, government-backed body that seeks to leverage the country's strengths to develop a crypto and blockchain hub for businesses from around the world.\n\nUnlike other countries, where crypto efforts are largely controlled by a central bank, \u200b\u200bSwitzerland operates a system of 11 Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs). This helps ensure a state-of-the-art blockchain ecosystem shaped by clear, efficient and flexible regulation.\n\nGiven this operating framework, BBVA's Swiss unit can offer innovation, security and confidence to customers who would like to explore the world of investing in digital assets. Through its Zurich office, BBVA has added crypto, bitcoin and ethereum to its offering for international private banking customers.\n\nThe cryptocurrency trading and custody service has received several awards as early as this year: at Innovation & Insight Week 2022, Celent, the leading research and technology advisory firm for financial institutions, presented an award in the product and platform category to BBVA Switzerland for the launch of New Gen. The consulting firm emphasized the positive features of the crypto platform\u2019s wealth management model."

        "title": "Bitcoin Lightning Network growth is organic, coming from real-world adoption - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The capacity of Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network (LN) recently surpassed an all-time high of 5,000 Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nThe Lightning Network is a neutral protocol built on top of Bitcoin, and it currently does not have a \u201cnative\u201d token attached to it like many decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.\n\nAlthough the Lightning Network\u2019s total liquidity is less than 0.5% of the Ether (ETH) in DeFi contracts, the uptrend in Bitcoin\u2019s LN capacity versus a downtrend in the amount of ETH locked in smart contracts is encouraging for LN development.\n\nTotal ETH locked in DeFi contracts (top) and total BTC in LN channels (bottom). Source: DefiLlama\n\nWhile the liquidity on the LN has been rising consistently, the number of channels on the peer-to-peer network dropped drastically in November following the FTX collapse. It could be due to an exodus of miners operating LN nodes besides running mining clients.\n\nHowever, the likely end of miner capitulation and the rise of Bitcoin-based applications like nonfungible tokens could mark an end to LN channel capitulation. Since the start of 2023, over 2,000 new channels have been added to the network.\n\nLightning Network number of channels. Source: Glassnode\n\nA Valkyrie Investments report states that LN adoption is picking up speed in emerging markets like South America and Africa, primarily due to efforts of the LN mobile payment application Strike.\n\nIn December 2022, the firm launched an LN-based remittance service in Africa. The service offers no-cost transfers from the United States to Africans in Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya. Later, Strike announced a similar program in the Philippines.\n\nLN capacity and important chronological events. Source: Valkyrie\n\nMore recently, the firm announced dollar payments using LN, where users can potentially send dollars from the Strike\u2019s cash balance to savings and Visa-enabled accounts. The app will convert U.S. dollars to BTC in the background and convert to dollars at the destination. Since LN is fast and cheap, the risk due to Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility is minimal.\n\nThe cost of international payments from the U.S. can reach as high as $45 per transaction, with transfers taking hours or sometimes days. Thus, users may start preferring Strike-based payments over traditional remittance channels.\n\nA recent report from Marty Bent found that the LN payments have risen this year on one of the top Lightning Network wallets, Wallet of Satoshi. Moreover, Podcasting 2.0 \u2014 a podcasting platform that accepts LN payments \u2014 also recorded an uptick in tips sent to creators.\n\nRelated: Retail giant Pick n Pay to accept Bitcoin in 1,628 stores across South Africa\n\nNostr is boosting LN adoption\n\nAnother factor influencing the adoption of LN is the launch of Nostr. According to the protocol\u2019s GitHub page, Nostr is a simple, open protocol that enables global, decentralized, censorship-resistant social media. The protocol allows social media applications to be built on it.\n\nDamus, a Twitter competitor, is built on Nostr and has an iOS and Android application. The idea of an open, free social media network reverberates strongly in the crypto space, with Bitcoin pioneers like Jack Dorsey and Adam Back having strongly endorsed Nostr.\n\nBesides their similarities in ideology, Nostr can boost LN adoption, as Damus has integrated various LN wallets like Wallet of Satoshi, Strike, BlueWallet and others. According to a report from LN analyst Kevin Rooke, over 600,000 users have signed up for Nostr. This could help onboard users to LN, as Nostr supports the Bitcoin payment network through Nostr Zap.\n\nWhile the LN does not have a native token, there is a potential for LN nodes to earn fees for facilitating transactions and providing liquidity. However, in its current state, the earnings are negligible. Hence, the Lightning Network\u2019s growth appears to be organic, and it\u2019s well-positioned to become the leading global payment network \u2014 as prominent personalities in the space have predicted.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nThe price of bitcoin is up roughly 50 per cent since the start of the year, despite the US government signalling a tougher regulatory stance on cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin briefly hit $25,000 this week, having started 2023 below $16,600, taking it back to levels not seen since last August. Other cryptocurrencies have also seen a significant surge in recent days, adding more than $100 billion to the overall market.\n\nThe price recovery surprised some analysts, as it went against an established narrative among several economic experts that bitcoin\u2019s market movements are largely driven by external macroeconomic and monetary news.\n\nSome credited the price surge to reports in China that the country is planning to soften its stance on crypto, having launched a major crackdown against the industry in 2021.\n\nA new study, however, suggests that neither news from China nor the US would have a significant impact on bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nA report from the New York Federal Reserve found that bitcoin\u2019s reaction to this and any other macroeconomic or monetary news will likely be \u201corthogonal\u201d movement.\n\n\u201cUnlike other US asset classes, bitcoin is orthogonal to monetary and macroeconomic news,\u201d the report stated.\n\nThe study used a comprehensive intraday dataset to analyse the effects of the news on the price of bitcoin, which the authors had originally posited was an asset \u201cwith no intrinsic value\u201d for which its current price depends on the discounted value of its future price.\n\n\u201cThe result that bitcoin does not react to monetary news is puzzling as it casts some doubts on the role of discount rates in pricing bitcoin,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nCrypto market correlation with traditional markets was often cited by analysts in 2022 as a way of explaining or predicting bitcoin\u2019s price movements, though the study calls into question such methods of analysis.\n\nSimon Peters, a crypto market analyst at the online trading platform eToro, said the findings could support previous theories that bitcoin acts more like a form of \u2018digital gold\u2019 and a safe-haven asset during times of broader economic turmoil.\n\n\u201cThe report stands in contrast to most mainstream thinking around bitcoin at the moment, where markets did indeed seem to correlate more heavily last year \u2013 although this year that correlation has been less apparent,\u201d Mr Peters said.\n\n\u201cHowever, if bitcoin does indeed move differently to macroeconomic events then it could provide significant support for using it as a hedge against other markets \u2013 akin to gold.\u201d"

        "content": "Most NFTs are created using the Ethereum blockchain through the ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard. ERC 721 is a standard which outlines how an NFT should be created so that it will be properly recognized across the Ethereum ecosystem. When an ERC-721 NFT is created, a file of metadata \u2013 literally data which provides information about other data (hence, \u201cmeta\u201d) \u2013 provides information about the NFT. The easiest way to think of it is that the NFT itself is a contract that proves ownership of another item, which is detailed in that metadata. In the case of the most common NFTs, which are digital art, the actual JPG or file of the art is usually stored off the Ethereum blockchain and the metadata includes a link to that file. This means that the actual file or artwork can be altered since it is not embedded in the blockchain."

However, some analysts argue that not only was this downturn expected, it also illustrates Bitcoin\u2019s continuing potential.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s meltdown in 2022 was influenced by the cryptocurrency\u2019s four-year halving cycle that tends to bring up a period of massive drawdowns. The token showed more resilience than others last year as contagion spread across crypto intermediaries.\n\n\u201cSometimes you need to battle-test, you need to go through crises to see the survivors,\u201d Wood told Bloomberg Television in November.\n\nWood\u2019s prediction could still bear out if certain chart analysis is correct. For example, the DeMark Combo indicator signals an exhaustion of crypto\u2019s bearish trend. Crypto bulls also note that Bitcoin\u2019s dip is similar to the Nasdaq Composite Index dotcom bubble crash, as both found themselves supported at or above the 0.236 absolute retracement level.\n\nThose trend lines have many crypto bulls hopeful for not only a positive recovery but also a higher sustained market value.\n\nTracking\n\nUse Bloomberg\u2019s charting tools to gauge where Bitcoin is headed."

        "content": "The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has long taken a cautious approach to Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies. However, there is no need for caution anymore as the \u201cbattle has been won\u201d between fiat and crypto, according to BIS.\n\nBIS general manager Agust\u00edn Carstens, who made the claim, highlighted that \u201ctechnology doesn\u2019t make for trusted money,\u201d among further criticisms of crypto in an interview with Bloomberg.\n\nCrypto has lost the argument that it's an alternative to fiat currency, the head of the Bank for International Settlements says https://t.co/xZKFHEj3b2 \u2014 Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) February 22, 2023\n\nAs the central bank for central banks, the BIS has emphasized the need for regulation and risk management in the crypto space, but claiming the crypto vs. fiat battle has been won sparked outrage, satire and corrections among the Bitcoin and crypto community.\n\nRay Youssef, CEO of Paxful and vocal Bitcoin maximalist, told Cointelegraph that it\u2019s \u201ceasy to get sucked into these battles but is all a distraction with no ROI.\u201c He continued, \u201cWe must focus on the battles in the global south and fight for every inch and every eyeball. What is happening in Nigeria now is vital for us all.\u201c\n\n\u201cWant to p*ss the clowns off? Ignore their FUD bait and focus all in on the global south and what is happening on the streets of nigeria.\u201c\n\nSaifedean Ammous, the author of The Bitcoin Standard, brought Carsten\u2019s statement to his followers\u2019 attention, provoking condemnation and concern in the comments. Florida-based Bitcoin advocate SVN (not his real name), whose frozen bank account prompted a switch to go all in on Bitcoin, told Cointelegraph, \u201cthese people are clowns.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Lady Anarki, a Bitcoin advocate who recently closed a Bitcoin Security Education company, explained that \u201cfiat and crypto are essentially the same exact scam.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor fiat, it is nefarious elite oligarchs creating a rigged game system to enrich themselves while making everyone else poorer. Bitcoin is a technology designed with incentives and sound economic principles that enriches anyone who brings value to the world.\u201d\n\nBitcoin losing the \u201cwar\u201d for money, as Carstens explained, is another reference to the fact that Bitcoin has been declared dead, dead and dead again. The 2022 and 2023 bear market is no different, and Bitcoin advocates on Twitter seized the opportunity to mock financial experts dancing on the imaginary grave of the decentralized currency.\n\nNonetheless, Bitcoin is up over 40% from its 2022 lows, and Lightning Network adoption flourishes while the community appears increasingly vocal.\n\nWhat Bitcoin Did, the popular podcast hosted by Peter McCormack, tweeted some handy statistics to correct another inflammatory statement published by the BIS this week. Notably, from August 2015 to December 2022, the BIS explained that \u201cnearly all economies made losses on their Bitcoin holdings.\u201d\n\nBIS analysis: Aug \u201815-Dec \u201822 \u201cmajority\u2026in nearly all economies made losses on their #Bitcoin holdings\u201d\n\n\n\nFacts:\n\n-Majority of global fiat lost value to USD since 2015\n\n-USD has lost over 26% of its own value due to inflation#Bitcoin has gone up nearly 8000%\n\n\n\nFacts be sticky pic.twitter.com/mMyBzuVhWz \u2014 What Bitcoin Did (@WhatBitcoinDid) February 21, 2023\n\nAs shown, the Bitcoin price continues to trend higher despite the BIS\u2019 best efforts to the contrary.\n\nThe BIS has been a vocal critic of cryptocurrencies, citing concerns about their volatility, scalability and energy consumption. However, the BIS has researched stablecoins and spearheads the development of central bank digital currencies in partnership with several countries, juxtaposing Carsten\u2019s comment in the Bloomberg interview that tech \u201cdoesn\u2019t make for trusted money.\u201d\n\nRelated: Coinbase staking \u2018fundamentally different\u2019 to Kraken\u2019s \u2014 chief lawyer\n\nWillem Middelkoop, author and Bitcoin advocate, highlighted that the war between fiat and crypto is far from over.

        "content": "Bitcoin's (BTC) 16% price gain between Feb. 13 and Feb. 16 practically extinguished the bears' expectation for a monthly options expiry below $21,500. As a result of the abrupt rally, these bearish bets are unlikely to pay off, especially since the expiry occurs on Feb. 24. However, bulls were not counting on the strong price rejection at $25,200 on Feb. 21, and this reduces their odds of securing a $480 million profit in this month\u2019s BTC options expiry.\n\nBitcoin investors' primary concern is a stricter monetary policy as the U.S. Federal Reserve increases interest rates and reduces its $8 trillion balance sheet. Feb. 22 minutes from the latest Federal Open Market Committee meeting showed that members were in consensus on the most recent 25 basis point rate hike and that the Fed is willing to continue raising rates as long as deemed necessary.\n\nSt. Louis Fed President James Bullard told CNBC on Feb. 22 that a more aggressive interest rate hike would give them a better chance to contain inflation. Bullard said:\n\n\"Let's be sharp now, let's get inflation under control in 2023.\"\n\nIf confirmed, the increased interest rate pace would be negative for risk assets, including Bitcoin, as it draws more profitability for fixed-income investments.\n\nEven if the newsflow remains negative, bulls still can profit up to $480 million in Friday's monthly options expiry. However, bears can still significantly improve their situation by pushing the BTC price below $23,000.\n\nBears were not expecting Bitcoin to hold $22,000\n\nThe open interest for the Feb. 24 monthly options expiry is $1.91 billion, but the actual figure will be lower since bears expected prices below $23,000. Nevertheless, these traders were surprised as Bitcoin gained 13.5% between Feb. 15 and Feb. 16.\n\nBitcoin options aggregate open interest for Feb. 24. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe 1.55 call-to-put ratio reflects the imbalance between the $1.16 billion call (buy) open interest and the $750 million put (sell) options. If Bitcoin's price remains near $24,000 at 8:00 am UTC on Feb. 24, only $125 million worth of these put (sell) options will be available. This difference happens because the right to sell Bitcoin at $22,000 or $23,000 is useless if BTC trades above that level on expiry.\n\nBulls aim for $23,000 to secure a $155 million profit\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on Feb. 17 for call (bull) and put (bear) instruments varies, depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes these theoretical profits:\n\nBetween $22,500 and $23,000: 12,500 calls vs. 10,700 puts.

On the other hand, the bears' best-case scenario requires a 3.5% price dump below $23,000 to minimize their losses.\n\nConsidering the negative pressure from the Fed's desire to weaken the economy and contain inflation, bears have good odds of improving their situation and settling with a $40 million loss on Feb. 24.

        "title": "Fear, uncertainty and doubt: Global regulatory challenges of crypto insolvencies - World Bank",
        "content": "\n\nLegal qualification of a crypto asset can be complicated. Cryptocurrency at its core is cryptographic code, which raises the question of how to legally classify these assets. Is it property, security, currency, or something else? There is no universal consensus on this issue and depending on the jurisdiction and the agreement between the parties, specific classification of this asset might impact the ability to get a freezing injunction against an insolvent company. Classification could raise other insolvency-related questions, such as the ability for a company to use a particular asset as a collateral to obtain rescue financing. Also, individual cryptocurrencies might be classified differently, leading to questions about regulatory jurisdiction, as was pointed out, for example, by the chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which may differentiate Bitcoin from other cryptos.\n\n\n\nAsset-tracing and recovery can be a significant challenge. With anonymity as one of the distinct features of crypto assets, they might not be easily identifiable, and tracing such assets requires special skills and engagement of blockchain analytics companies. An even bigger challenge might be when companies\u2019 assets are stored on private addresses, known in the industry as cold wallets, as opposed to exchange-controlled accounts, or hot wallets. Cold wallets provide the highest decentralized level of security to the cryptocurrency user. They are practically impossible to break without a private key that is usually only known to the owner. This feature of anonymity can potentially provide a value proposition of securing personal funds, especially for the most vulnerable. However, funds on a cold wallet can be a crucial challenge in insolvency proceedings if there is a need to secure the company\u2019s assets. Even if a wallet\u2019s geographic location is identified and it can be physically seized, it would be extremely hard, if not impossible, to recover the funds from such a wallet without the owner\u2019s cooperation. For example, this happened in Quadriga\u2019s insolvency case and the related death of the exchange\u2019s CEO, Gerald Cotton, who owned the cold wallet with the assumed company\u2019s funds, which therefore vanished. The potential solution, in this case, might be a transparent corporate governance regulation where a CEO or company\u2019s officer of a crypto company doesn\u2019t have exclusive access to the company\u2019s crypto funds. For this purpose, using a digital wallet that operates with multi-signature address and requires more than one private key to authorize a transaction could be an option, or using a service of a trusted crypto custodian or some other alternatives that can ensure transparent and secure accessibility of a company\u2019s funds.\n\n\n\nTreatment of creditors poses a separate risk, and depending on the nature of a company, it can influence many individual retail investors and have a more significant systemic effect on an economy. In this respect, the crypto industry is characterized by the lack of any safety nets, such as investor protection funds, that are common in many securities markets. Take the case of Celsius Network, mentioned earlier. According to Celsius\u2019 terms of service, the treatment of customers\u2019 digital assets in the event of an insolvency proceeding is \u201cunsettled\u201d and \u201cnot guaranteed\u201d and may result in clients being classified as an unsecured creditor \u201cand/or the total loss\u201d of the assets. Respective agreements between the parties should also be appropriately interpreted within the insolvency frameworks of specific jurisdictions. In the recent development of the ongoing Celsius insolvency case, a US bankruptcy judge ruled that the deposits in the yield-bearing Earn accounts belong to Celsius, not individual account holders. As with many other crypto-related issues, lack of clarity on this matter, can create procedural challenges and might require appropriate regulatory intervention.\n\n\n\nDistribution to creditors can be especially uncertain. Volatility is a central characterization of cryptocurrencies, a trade-off for its decentralization. As the most used cryptocurrency, Bitcoin can be incredibly volatile. Between April 2022 and January 2023, Bitcoin\u2019s value more than halved, from just over $45,000 to below $20,000. But three years ago, Bitcoin was half the current price and traded at levels below $10,000. Such recurring and unpredictable \u2018booms and busts\u2019 in the crypto industry can be a challenge in insolvency proceedings at the stage of paying proceeds to creditors, if the distribution was to be made in the legal currency of the country, as many insolvency laws currently require, instead of distributing the crypto assets themselves. From the moment of determining the payment amount and actual distribution to the creditor, the cryptocurrency can move substantially.\n\n\n\nAdded to the complexity of the distribution to creditors is the practical challenge of delivering the funds to multiple creditors, possibly residing in different jurisdictions. For example, Celsius reportedly served 40,000 members from over 150 countries. Distributing funds as part of an insolvency process can also be costly, particularly when cross-border bank transfers are necessary. To overcome this challenge, it may be worthwhile to consider distributing the assets in cryptocurrency. This is because, as the Bitcoin community often says, \u201c1 BTC = 1 BTC\u201d, meaning that the value of one Bitcoin is the same, regardless of where it is held in the world.\n\n\n\nDespite the current decline in the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin and other digital assets are likely here to stay for the foreseeable future. While cryptocurrencies have brought certain innovations, they have also introduced new risks, which have created FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) for financial supervisors and regulators in different areas, including insolvency. A practical, comprehensive, and transparent regulatory framework that addresses some critical challenges that have appeared from recent crypto-related insolvencies could help to reduce some of these risks."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) hodlers need to watch the central banks of China and Japan as well as the United States as BTC/USD battles \u201chuge\u201d resistance.\n\nThat was the opinion of trading firm QCP Capital, which in its latest crypto market research piece, \u201cThe Crypto Circular,\u201d warned that Bitcoin faces risks far beyond the Federal Reserve.\n\nBitcoin \u201cmost direct global liquidity proxy\u201d\n\nHaving survived the latest flood of macroeconomic data from the U.S., Bitcoin is nonetheless flagging right below $25,000 as bulls run out of momentum.\n\nFor QCP Capital, there is now reason to believe that risk factors for price performance will come not just from the Fed \u2014 but China and Japan.\n\nMarket participants must now contend with such issues as China\u2019s Consumer Price Index (CPI) as well as the U.S. equivalent, along with Japanese central bank policy changes.\n\n\u201cWhile the jury is out on BTC\u2019s value as an inflation hedge, it cannot be denied that it is the most direct global liquidity proxy, as it is not tied to any one central bank or nation,\u201d the research argues.\n\nBitcoin is sensitive to global liquidity, and when central banks inject it, this marks an incentive for growth in and of itself. That argument is already popular, with others also eyeing how \u201cliquidity junkie\u201d Bitcoin will navigate changes in central bank liquidity this year.\n\n\u201cAnd while we were focused on USD liquidity \u2014 from the Fed\u2019s QT and Reserve balance, we\u2019ve missed the massive liquidity injection by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) and People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) over the past 3 months,\u201d QCP continues.\n\n\u201cContrary to consensus, central banks have net added $1 trillion of liquidity since the market\u2019s bottom in October 2022, with the PBOC and BOJ the largest contributors.\u201d\n\nQCP refers to the dichotomy between U.S. policy and China and Japan \u2014 quantitative tightening (QT) versus quantitative easing (QE). Regardless of what the Fed does, extra liquidity in one place is all but guaranteed to trickle into risk assets such as crypto.\n\n\u201cHence, such a large injection of liquidity will no doubt find its way to crypto, even despite what appears to be the current US administration\u2019s best efforts to prevent that,\u201d it says.\n\nVersus net $1 trillion of liquidity injections, the Fed has reduced its balance sheet to its lowest levels since September 2021.\n\n\u201cWhat this means is that apart from US data and Fed guidance now, which ultimately still holds the highest beta for market moves, we also have to be conscious of BOJ and PBOC liquidity injections,\u201d QCP writes.\n\n\u201cAny reversal of liquidity from these 2 sources would remove the underlying support that BTC has seen this past month.\u201d\n\nFed balance sheet chart (screenshot). Source: Federal Reserve\n\nResearch reiterates \u201cdouble top\u201d warning\n\nGoing forward, however, liquidity fans face formidable resistance when it comes to Bitcoin, with order books showing sellers lying in wait en masse closer to $30,000.\n\nRelated: Can Bitcoin price hold $24K as stocks correlation hits lowest since 2021?\n\n$25,000 is already causing enough problems, QCP warned, acknowledging that rejection at that level would mean that resistance from mid-2022 remains in control.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, that issue is also being watched by popular trader and analyst, Rekt Capital.\n\n#BTC is pulling back in for a retest\n\n\n\nNeeds to hold the confluent area below for the retest to be successful$BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin https://t.co/ISYqnU5bkY pic.twitter.com/Vx2eV3fLDA \u2014 Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) February 22, 2023\n\n\u201cBTC \u2014 A potential double top is forming against the August 2022 correction high, and May 2022 reaction is low at 25,300.

        "title": "How to Short Bitcoin \u2013 A Complete Guide - FX Empire",
        "content": "A CFD is a derivative. This is a frightening word for newcomers, but it simply means that the value of the instrument is determined by the value of something else. In this case, the value of the CFD is determined by the change in the price of Bitcoin. Investors buying a CFD do not actually own Bitcoin. They only own the change in the price of Bitcoin.\n\nJust like the terms of shorting, the terms of a CFD vary by broker. Again, investors need to do some homework and find a broker that meets their needs. This includes the financial requirements for trading. Among these brokers, you can find Plus 500 *(86% of retail CFD accounts lose money), AvaTrade and FXTM. Investors who meet the definition of an accredited investor have access to investment products and strategies that are not available to the general public under US securities law.\n\nFurthermore, there are various brokers that provide CFD\u2019s which allow you to short other cryptocurrencies. See the list below:\n\nShorting Bitcoin via Futures Market (Cboe/CME)\n\nOne the easiest parts of a CFD to understand is that it measures the difference in the price of Bitcoin over a period of time. In this sense, a CFD \u201cbuys\u201d the future price of Bitcoin. This can be done directly through the latest development in Bitcoin trading, futures contracts in Bitcoin.\n\nFutures are easy to understand by beginning with their origins in the agricultural sector. A farmer who plants a corn crop cannot know what price it will bring when the crop is harvested. To eliminate this uncertainty he can buy a futures contract that will give him the right to sell his corn at a started price when it is harvested. The actual price at that time \u2013 the \u201cspot\u201d price \u2013 may be higher or lower, but his price is fixed by the futures contract.\n\nBitcoin futures contracts are available for as few as a single Bitcoin and have expiration dates ranging from one week to three months. One of the benefits of a future is that they can be traded before the contract expires. This means an investor can buy a futures contract and realize some of the value from that contract (presuming it has value) before the expiration date by selling the contract to another investor.\n\nSuggested Articles\n\nBitcoin Short \u2013 Pros and Cons\n\nShorting Bitcoin, or any financial asset for that matter, can get fairly complicated. However, the most important point to remember is that the most basic risk remains the same for the futures buyer as the straight short-seller. The potential loss has no cap, but the potential gain is limited to the current market price.\n\nInvestors use the strategies to short Bitcoin for a more important reason than just an expectation that the price will drop. Keep in mind that every strategy to short Bitcoin can be used to profit from a price increase. The most basic reason investors use margin, derivatives and futures is that these strategies employ leverage in one way or another.\n\nThese strategies allow the investor to own the change in price with a smaller investment than the current price of Bitcoin. In the case of a short, the price is the total transaction fees and interest. Leverage is a powerful financial tool used by every homeowner with a mortgage. Leverage multiplies the return on an investment that performs as expected, but also multiples the loss when it does not pan out.\n\nConclusion\n\nInvestors who have managed to grasp the relationship between blockchain and cryptocurrencies and then built on that to learn how to trade Bitcoin on exchanges have still only scratched the surface of how to profit from their knowledge. Understanding technical analysis \u2013reading the patterns in the ups and downs of the market \u2013 is also only a step on the path to becoming a fully-equipped Bitcoin investor.\n\nGaining an understanding of how to profit from any movement in the price of Bitcoin could be the most important task the serious, savvy investor can undertake. Working through the math of how leverage increases Return on Investment (ROI) is part of understanding why margins, derivatives, and futures are so powerful. Working through the math of these instruments when they move in a bad direction is just as important to understanding the risk of leverage.\n\nThese building blocks are not always easy to acquire, but they are always worthwhile to have, even if the investor chooses not to use them. Understanding and tracking the futures market, for example, gives the investor insight into what other, perhaps more sophisticated investors, think will happen in the future. That knowledge can be power."

        "title": "As Fiat Beats Bitcoin, BIS Head Eyes CBDCs and Tokenized Deposits - PYMNTS.com",
        "content": "The dust has settled. The battlefield is still.\n\nAnd, as has been widely reported this week, Agust\u00edn Carstens, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), has declared crypto the loser.\n\n\u201cA few years ago, crypto assets and cryptocurrencies have been put as an alternative to fiat money,\u201d Carstens told Bloomberg in an interview posted Wednesday (Feb. 22). \u201cThat battle has been won.\u201d\n\nCarstens also said that technology does not pave the way for \u201ctrusted money\u201d \u2014 and it\u2019s the central banks, and their infrastructure, that gives money \u201ccredibility.\u201d\n\nSeparately, in a speech given in Singapore that same day, Carstens noted that distributed ledger technology (DLT) can lead to new payments technologies and use cases. And in a nod to the convergence of bank infrastructure, credibility and technologies, he noted that there\u2019s a place for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and for tokenized deposits.\n\n\u201cCBDCs and tokenized deposits would appear in separate partitions in the unified ledger. Because they share a common ledger, they can be brought together and used in an efficient way, through smart contracts,\u201d said Carstens \u2014 where CBDCs play the same role as central bank money, tokenized deposits are commercial bank money.\n\nReplicating Existing Money\n\nThese offerings are, he said, ways of replicating existing money with technology.\n\n\u201cWhat makes central bank money and commercial bank money indistinguishable today is a complex and well developed network of institutional arrangements, including regulation, supervision, deposit insurance and settlement on the central bank\u2019s book,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe same should be true of CBDC and tokenized deposits.\u201d Stablecoins don\u2019t fit the bill here, he said, because they don\u2019t have the same regulations in place.\n\nThe path toward CBDCs, we note, is becoming increasingly wider. As we reported here, countries spanning China, Singapore, Australia, Japan, Korea and Hong Kong are already piloting CBDCs, or plan to this year. The Bank of England is in the mix, too.\n\nTokenized deposits offer an alternative to the stablecoin model and to cryptos in general as they enable direct bank-to-bank activity. Rob Hunter, deputy general counsel and director of regulatory and legislative affairs at The Clearing House (TCH), told Karen Webster the deposits would be underpinned by blockchain technology. The use of blockchain has become widespread, especially among multinational firms. In our research on blockchain and cross-border payments, we found that 56% of cross-border businesses that use blockchain technology in their operations.\n\nAnd while bitcoin has been used by 47% of businesses, the fact is that regulatory clarity remains at the top of the list when it comes to deciding whether to use cryptos or stablecoins at all (cited by 52% of multinationals). Regulators are cracking down on crypto and stablecoin firms, warning of risks and even curtailing some firms\u2019 issuance of coins. The easiest regulatory \u201cpath\u201d \u2014 especially for using digital payments and deposits \u2014 may be to hew to the monetary system and channels that are already in place. And in that case, the battle against bitcoin \u2014 waged with CBDCs and tokenized deposits \u2014 may indeed be decided."

Prior to joining Bitcoin Depot in 2020, Sacco and Knoll each gained over 15 years of relevant experience with a global cash ATM company, where they orchestrated a number of successful software and hardware conversions.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe streamlined the process to convert Bitcoin Depot\u2019s Bitcoin ATMs to Bitaccess software during a testing phase, which allowed us to reduce the software conversion process in the field,\u201d said Sacco. \u201cBy swapping out the existing hard drive with one preloaded with Bitaccess software we quickly completed the software conversion while avoiding certain technical issues that can happen in field conversion projects. We efficiently converted approximately the first 6,000 of Bitcoin Depot\u2019s Bitcoin ATMs in 10 weeks.\u201d\n\nBitaccess offers software support not only for Bitcoin Depot\u2019s Bitcoin ATMs but can also be deployed in other operators\u2019 Bitcoin ATMs. The feature rich software allows operators white label opportunities and the ability to reduce the number of other software-related vendors needed due to its expanded, built-in functionality relative to other products. Additionally, Bitaccess has historically charged a lower software licensing fee to Bitcoin ATM operators based on transaction volume, compared to other software providers, and offers volume discounts.\n\nThis conversion makes Bitcoin Depot one of the first companies in the industry to complete a full software conversion across more than a few hundred Bitcoin ATMs. Based on industry data only a handful of Bitcoin ATM companies are vertically integrated, meaning they own their own software and operate their own Bitcoin ATMs, but there are over 550 Bitcoin ATM operators worldwide as of February 20, 2023, according to Coinatmradar.com.1 There are currently close to 8,000 total Bitcoin ATMs using Bitaccess software, including those operated by Bitcoin Depot, which gives Bitaccess a market share of approximately 21% worldwide as of February 20, 2023, calculated based on data from Coinatmradar.com.2\n\nAbout Bitcoin Depot\n\nBitcoin Depot was founded in 2016 with the mission to connect those who prefer to use cash to the broader, digital financial system. Bitcoin Depot provides its users with simple, efficient and intuitive means of converting cash into Bitcoin, which users can deploy in the payments, spending and investing space.

        "content": "As some $1.85 billion worth of Bitcoin options contracts are set to expire tomorrow, bearish and bullish traders are almost evenly pitted against each other.\n\nThe tug of war between the optimistic bets \u2013 or calls, and pessimistic ones \u2013 or puts, \u201clooks neutral\u201d as the expiry date of the derivatives nears, Darius Tabatabai, co-founder of decentralised exchange Vertex Protocol and a former Credit Suisse trader, told DL News.\n\nBitcoin options are a type of derivative contract that grant the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy Bitcoin at a predetermined price at a future date.\n\nBitcoin bears have been piling into bets that recent regulatory pitfalls will act as a drag on the crypto\u2019s price. Bulls will win out should that regulatory crackdown look overly pessimistic. Tabatabai explained that because calls and puts are relatively balanced, market makers could keep the top cryptocurrency pinned close to the current $23,500 to $24,500 trading range.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nBTC options open interest by strike price, February 24 expiry. (coinglass)\n\nBitcoin\u2019s put-to-call ratio \u2013 derived by dividing the number of traded put options by the number of traded call options \u2013 sits at 0.67 for the February 24 expiry, indicating only a slight bullish bias. Because traders typically buy more calls than puts, a ratio of less than 0.7 is usually considered bullish, as it means significantly more calls were bought versus puts.\n\nHowever, despite the neutral outlook, bears may try to push Bitcoin\u2019s price toward its \u201cmax pain\u201d level at $22,000.\n\nEach option contract has a strike price. Only when the price of the underlying asset moves above this price for call options or below for puts does the contract make money.\n\nMax pain, or the max pain price, is the strike price at which the largest number of options contracts expire at no profit. It suggests that the price of an underlying asset tends to gravitate towards its max pain strike price as market makers hedge their positions to remain neutral.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin call options skew toward the $26,000 and $28,000 strikes, with another spike at $24,000. While puts are more distributed, there is also a large spike in volume at the $24,000 strike, making it a battleground price."

        "content": "The January launch of Bitcoin Ordinals created a stir within the crypto community about its place within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Users are debating whether they offer new use cases for Bitcoin or if it takes away from BTC\u2019s peer-to-peer cash system vision.\n\nNo matter the community sentiment on the Bitcoin-based nonfungibale token (NFT) issue, this did not stop Bitcoin (BTC) mining firm Luxor Mining from acquiring OrdinalHub, the primary platform for Bitcoin NFTs.\n\nThe announcement came on Feb. 20, with 150,000 inscriptions (Ordinals) already made, a 15000% increase from the beginning of the month.\n\nLuxor highlighted the fact that the current state of Bitcoin Ordinals being minted and \u201cescrowed\u201d through various Discord servers has made it difficult for collectors and creators to keep track of all of the projects. It claims the OrdinalHub will tackle this issue as a \u201ccentral hub\u201d for the community.\n\nNick Hansen, the CEO of Luxor, praised the innovative qualities of Ordinals and how they can create \u201csynergies between the firm\u2019s mining pool and the OridinalHub.\n\n\u201cOrdinals have opened the door for exciting new monetization strategies for Bitcoin miners.\u201c\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin miners have already made around $600,000 from Ordinals\u2019 NFT transactions. Moreover, Bitcoin-based NFT inscriptions now take over 50% of Bitcoin block space.\n\nRelated: Will the Bitcoin mining industry collapse? Analysts explain why crisis is really opportunity\n\nOrdinalHub posted about the acquisition on Twitter on Feb. 22, to which users responded with generally positive sentiments toward the development.\n\nReally excited to see the top notch team at @LuxorTechTeam really lean into the space with this move. I've had a blast helping build parts of @ordinalhub behind the scenes. I'll see you all on the freshly launched OrdinalHub discord https://t.co/paMwrM1DT9 \u2014 cbspears \u26cf\u2699\ufe0f (@cbspears) February 21, 2023\n\nHowever, some users remained skeptical about the acquisition and the Ordinal buzz in general, saying the \u201chype might be over.\u201d\n\nOrdinal punks floor continues to fall precipitously. Arguably the most recognizable ordinals. The ordinals hype phase might be over, reality setting in. Just another 2023 PND \u2014 Doc Crypto (@doccrypto777) February 22, 2023\n\nStandard NFTs have gone through hype cycles, which was at a low by the end of 2022. However, according to a recent DappRadar report, they are slowly making a comeback after a 37% increase in transactions from December 2022 to January 2023."

The Mawson site has a total capacity of 120 MW, which is capable of housing and operating up to 35,280 ASIC miners, with those miners capable of producing up to 4.2 exahashes per second, according to a press release from the company.\n\nThe first stage of 12 MW is scheduled to be energized in the second quarter. The balance of the 120 MW capacity will come online incrementally through 2023 and early 2024.\n\nMawson plans for the Sharon facility to house a split of Mawson Self-Mining and Mawson Hosting operations.\n\nThe Sharon facility will also take part in Mawson\u2019s Energy Markets program, which helps drive curtailment revenue through periods of grid stress, while simultaneously providing power stability to the grid and households throughout the PJM market.\n\nThe completion of the Sharon site, and another one in Midland, Pa.

Former Cohasset assistant facilities director Nadeam Nahas, 39, was due to be arraigned in Quincy District Court Thursday but never showed up, forcing the judge to issue a warrant for his arrest.\n\nCohasset police said another town worker discovered the mining setup in a \"remote crawl space under the school\" in December of 2021. He saw electrical wires and several computers \"that seemed out of place,\" police said.\n\nThe operation was illegally using power from the school's electrical system, police determined after consulting IT professionals. Investigators with the Coast Guard and Homeland Security helped to safely remove the mining equipment and figure out where it came from.\n\nThe equipment used in the alleged cryptocurrency mining operation, and the crawl space in Cohasset. Cohasset Police\n\n\"He was effectively creating money,\" said Larry Glazer, a crypto expert and managing partner at Mayflower Advisors in Boston.\n\nGlazer said the suspect was likely using the crawl space operation to create his own money on the taxpayers' dime.\n\n\"It's something that can't be done efficiently at home in New England because the cost of electricity is so prohibitively expensive,\" he said. \"You had an employee who was effectively stealing electricity from the community from the taxpayers and from the town.\"\n\nAfter a three-month investigation, police charged Nahas with fraudulent use of electricity and vandalizing the school. Nahas resigned from his job in early 2022, police said.\n\nCohasset Public Schools told WBZ-TV in a statement \"we were cooperative in assisting the Cohasset Police throughout the investigation,\" but offered no further comment.\n\nAs CBS News explains, crypto is digital currency that can be made or \"mined\" by using specialized computer processors running on vast amounts of electricity."

In this wide-ranging interview, we discuss the upcoming Bitcoin Ski Summit Amanda is organizing, how Bitcoin can help the United States, whether Bitcoin should be radical or conservative, the importance of values in Bitcoin culture, and the promise of Nostr.\n\n- - - -\n\nAmanda Cavaleri is a long-time friend of the show, and one of the most genuine and hard-working people within Bitcoin. Amanda has numerous interests across Bitcoin, from investments to mining, from advocacy to education. As a veteran Bitcoiner, Amanda is able to have a wider perspective on the important value Bitcoin brings to society beyond its immediate investment potential.\n\nWe discussed the unremitting importance of Bitcoin to privacy, and of privacy to democracy. With the rise of China, having a tool outside of the purview of the state is becoming increasingly important. Furthermore, Bitcoin has the potential to support global economic growth as we transition from the dollar as a reserve currency: Bitcoin has the potential to be neutral global money that can enable efficient cross-border payments in an increasingly multipolar world.\n\nWe talked about despite Bitcoin being an apolitical tool, there is significant work required to get it to resonate within the Washington bubble. Amanda set out the educational work, network building and soft permeation of DC being undertaken by the Bitcoin Today Coalition. This is a slow but vital advocacy process needed to lessen the risk Bitcoin\u2019s development within the United States is kneecapped by ignorant legislators.\n\nFinally, we covered the importance of Bitcoin\u2019s culture. Whilst \u2018number goes up\u2019 worked to gain rapid interest over previous cycles, a values-based ideology is showing itself to be critical in both widening Bitcoin adoption and defending against attacks. But culture obviously affects the internal workings of Bitcoin as much as its presentation externally. Therefore, the current debate around how radical Bitcoin should be may perhaps become a significant area of debate in the next year."

The company acquired a majority equity interest in BitAccess in late 2022, according to a press release.\n\nThe software provides operators with white label opportunities and boasts a smaller licensing fee.\n\n\"This is the one of the first software conversions of this scale in the industry and a major accomplishment for our company,\" Brandon Mintz, CEO and founder of Bitcoin Depot, said in the release. \"Our vertical integration strengthens our market position and fortifies our value proposition to customers and investors. We're thrilled to see the results of this endeavor streamline our operations, reduce costs, and ultimately benefit our customers.\"\n\n\"We streamlined the process to convert Bitcoin Depot's Bitcoin ATMs to BitAccess software during a testing phase, which allowed us to reduce the software conversion process in the field,\" Jason Sacco, VP of BTM operations, Bitcoin Depot, said in the release. \"By swapping out the existing hard drive with one preloaded with BitAccess software we quickly completed the software conversion while avoiding certain technical issues that can happen in field conversion projects. We efficiently converted approximately the first 6,000 of Bitcoin Depot's Bitcoin ATMs in 10 weeks.\""

        "content": "On Feb. 18, an Australian software engineer by the name of Anthony Guerrera posted a repository to GitHub that forked the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol to Litecoin. This allowed for nonfungible token (NFT)-like assets on the Litecoin network in much the same way it had made it to Bitcoin earlier in the year. Although as of now this could only work in LTC apart from bitcoin network as they have its soft forks of the SegWit and Taproot technology, there are possibilities where this could be developed for other blockchains."

        "content": "The Puell Multiple metric was at its highest in 14 months at press time.\n\nOrdinals have also helped the transaction count metric surge in the past weeks.\n\nMany reasons have contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] recent and sustained price increase. First, of course, Ordinals\u2019 development is a factor, but so is miners\u2019 decrease in BTC sales due to increased revenue. Okay, but how does it all fit together?\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThe Ordinals effect\n\nThe utility of the Bitcoin blockchain gained a new level with the introduction of Ordinals and its NFT-like operations. According to the findings of Dune Analytics, over 155,000 Ordinals inscriptions have been completed to date. In addition, the Ordinals\u2019 daily inscription chart revealed that there has been an average of 5,000 new inscriptions per day.\n\nOrdinal contributes to transaction count\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain\u2019s transaction count measure has also been impacted by the increase in the number of Ordinals created, according to a post by Glassnode. Even though the current count has decreased as of this writing, the overall level improved, according to Santiment\u2019s data.\n\nMore than the volume seen since August, the transaction count indicator revealed an upward trend. However, the number was down to about 115,000 as of this writing.\n\nBitcoin miners\u2019 sale drops\n\nOne way to evaluate Bitcoin\u2019s current market value compared to its manufacturing cost in the past is via the Puell Multiple. It considers the current market price of Bitcoin and the \u201cBitcoin Mining Reward,\u201d the rate at which new Bitcoins are created daily.\n\nSince miners are the only entity with a consistent cost, like running energy, this indicator has historically been spot-on for identifying Bitcoin\u2019s bear market periods. The current Puell Multiple value is about 0.9, the highest over a year per CryptoQuant.\n\nAccording to statistics compiled by Blockchain.com, miner profits have risen over the past few weeks. Bitcoin\u2019s price surge to the $24,000 region has boosted miners\u2019 profits. Revenue was over $24,000 as of the writing of this article, down somewhat from the previous month but still at an eight-month high.\n\nWith increased profits, miners are under less pressure to offload their wares to recoup manufacturing expenses. As a result, stability in Bitcoin\u2019s price was inevitable after the sale pressure from miners subsided.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nHow it all ties together\n\nThe stability of Bitcoin can be attributed to the recent uptick in the rate of transactions, which the price of Ordinals\u2019 Inscription has influenced. BTC\u2019s current strength has led to an increase in the Puell Multiple measures, which indicated less selling pressure from miners. As their income is up, the urge to sell eased.\n\nUltimately, these indicators are tied to the fluctuation of BTC\u2019s price."

        "content": "How Bitcoin and crypto could revolutionise the housing market\n\nWhile crypto currency like Bitcoin is too volatile an asset to be presetly useful for completing property transactions, there are myriad ways the technology could be applied to property purchases. Here are some ways crypto could change how he sees the future of property sales and how the blockchain could be at its heart.\n\nDOES CRYPTO HAVE A PLACE IN THE FUTURE OF PROPERTY TRANSACTIONS?\n\nYes, blockchain technology will substantially impact the property market, enabled by blockchain technology, smart contracts and web3 applications. Of course the cryptocurrencies or tokens underlaying such ecosystems will play a pivotal role in the UK property market, as they already do in many markets worldwide.\n\nIS THERE DEMAND FROM BUYERS?\n\nThe space is still in its infancy stage and, due to the lack of regulation does not lend itself to transacting for anyone outside the space. There are virtually no examples of onchain property transactions at this stage outside of the metaverse. Bitcoin is (and certainly will be when fully mined) a storage of value \u2013 like digital gold \u2013 similar to actual gold nowadays. An on-chain property transaction would be like exchanging for another value like company shares or an artwork. These cases exist but are blips and don\u2019t provide a basis for the future vision of on-chain property transactions.\n\nRead more Florian Zeller interview: The Son director on fighting the shame of mental illness\n\nWHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS?\n\nIn the past five years I have seen compelling cases for deeds moving onto the blockchain via a sort of NFT protocol. A regulated crypto space could bring about added security and transparency as well as many efficiencies and cost reductions for the transaction process. The tokenization of assets brings benefits of co and micro-ownership and facilitates access to the property ladder for younger generations. Joint ownership (shared freehold or leasehold) structures could be managed via existing smart contract protocols and web3 ecosystems. This list of possible use cases down the line could be \u2018infinitely\u2019 extended.\n\nWHAT ARE THE DRAWBACKS?\n\nThe current major drawback is the infancy of space, the lack of transparency; volatility and regulation are one element but the complexity of the technology and difficulty to assess merit from fraudulent projects, adds to the current near irrelevance for property transactions in the real world. Blockchain technology can be compared to the internet revolution, the question is, are we in 1990 or 2000?"

        "title": "How to trade bull and bear flag patterns? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "In technical analysis, a flag pattern indicates short-term price movements inside a parallelogram coounter to the previous long-term trend. Traditional analysts view flags as potential trend continuation indicators.\n\nThere are two types of flag patterns: bull flag and bear flag. While their outcomes are different, each flag exhibits five key characteristics, as listed below:\n\nThe strong preceding trend (flagpole or pole) The consolidation channel (the flag itself) The trading volume pattern A breakout A confirmation of the price moving in the direction of its previous trend.\n\nIn this article, we discuss bull and bear flag patterns and how to trade them.\n\nWhat is a bull flag pattern?\n\nA bull flag is a technical pattern that appears when the price consolidates lower inside a downward-sloping channel after a strong uptrend. The said channel comprises two parallel, rising trendlines. Kindly note that the pattern could be a wedge or a pennant if the trendlines converge.\n\nThe volume typically dries up during consolidation, implying that traders associated with the preceding trend have less urgency to buy or sell during the consolidation period.\n\nBull flag illustration\n\nThe urgency to jump in by new and old investors, or \u201cFOMO\u201d (fear of missing out), typically returns when the price breaks above the bull flag\u2019s upper trendline, thus boosting trading volumes.\n\nAs a result, analysts view strong volumes as a sign of a successful bull flag breakout.\n\nOn the other hand, lackluster volumes when the price breaks above the bull flag's upper trendline increase the possibility of a fakeout. In other words, the price risks dropping below the upper trendline, thus invalidating the bullish continuation setup.\n\nTrading a bull flag setup\n\nTraders can enter a long position at the bottom of a bull flag in anticipation that the price\u2019s next run-up toward the pattern\u2019s upper trendline will result in a breakout. The more risk-averse traders can wait for a breakout confirmation before opening a long position.\n\nAs for the upside target, a bull flag breakout typically prompts the price to rise by as much as the flagpole\u2019s size when measured from the flag\u2019s bottom.\n\nThe following Bitcoin (BTC) price pattern between December 2020 and February 2021 shows a successful bull flag breakout setup.\n\nBTC/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nAs a note of caution, traders should maintain their risks by placing a stop loss just below their entry levels. That will enable them to reduce their losses if the bull flag gets invalidated.\n\nWhat is a bear flag pattern\n\nA bear flag pattern is the opposite of a bull flag pattern, exhibiting an initial downside move followed by an upward consolidation inside a parallel channel. The downside move is called the flagpole, and the upward consolidation channel is the bear flag itself.\n\nMeanwhile, the period of bear flag formation tends to coincide with declining trading volumes.\n\nBear flag illustration\n\nTrading a bear flag pattern\n\nThe following is an illustration of how to trade bear flag pattern on crypto charts.\n\nBTC/USD daily price chart featuring a bear flag breakdown. Source: TradingView\n\nIn the Bitcoin chart above, the price has formed a flagpole followed by an upward retracement inside a rising parallel channel. Eventually, BTC price breaks out of the channel range to the downside and drops by as much as the flagpole\u2019s height.\n\nTraders can choose to open a short position on a pullback from the flag\u2019s upper trendline or wait until the price breaks below the lower trendline with rising volumes.\n\nIn either case, the short target is, as a rule, measured by subtracting the flag\u2019s peak from the flagpole size.\n\nRelated: What is a Doji candle pattern and how to trade with it?\n\nMeanwhile, a breakdown below the flag\u2019s lower trendline accompanying lackluster volumes suggests a fakeout, meaning the price may reclaim the lower trendline as support for a potential rebound inside the parallel channel.\n\nTo limit losses in a fakeout scenario, it is important to place a stop loss just above the entry levels.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and readers should conduct their own research when making a decision."

When it comes to real estate and bitcoin in Portugal, most sales take place south of the Tagus, namely in Lisbon and the Algarve, according to data revealed by the Order of Notaries in Portugal.\n\nLast year, according to Expresso, notaries made 13 deeds of purchase and sale of property whose payment was made in the form of digital assets. Bitcoin or ethereum were the two cryptocurrencies used as means of payment in real estate transactions, the publication also indicates.\n\nBut seven deeds were also refused, for various reasons: lack of compliance in the requirements regarding the prevention of money laundering; lack of technological knowledge to carry out the transaction; or doubts about tax rules to be applied.\n\n\"The numbers reflect that there are people willing to conduct business with cryptocurrencies in Portugal, but that there is also a lot of work to be done to have a clearer and more global legislative framework,\" Jorge Batista da Silva, head of the Order of Notaries, tells the Portuguese newspaper Expresso."
