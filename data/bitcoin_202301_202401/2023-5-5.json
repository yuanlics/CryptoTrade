You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin has soared more than 74% to start 2023, but the world's most popular token by market cap could more than double by next year, according to Bob Ras, cofounder of blockchain firm Sologenic.\n\nA key catalyst will be the halving process, which is when the reward for miners is cut in half. It's meant to cut the supply of tokens and historically has sparked price increases.\n\n\"When bitcoin's halving kicks in a year from now, we'll likely be well on our way past the previous all-time high,\" Ras told Insider.\n\nThat would mean bitcoin soars past the $67,000 level reached in November 2021, up from about $29,000 on Friday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin appears to be front-running the belief that looser policy from the Federal Reserve is on the way, Ras explained.\n\nThe Fed on Wednesday hiked rates for the 10th consecutive time, but Wall Street widely expects that to be the last increase of this tightening cycle.\n\nHe thinks the token's rally points to a future that is effectively a return to lower rates and more quantitative easing.\n\nTechnical indicators, such as long-term moving averages, suggest upside and momentum, he said, but it's the broader landscape that will determine its performance the rest of the year. And he wouldn't be surprised if bitcoin hits $40,000 by the end of 2023.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Coupled with signs of slowing [economic] growth, the changing macro picture is pointing towards a Fed that will likely soon have to cut interest rates and inject a lot of liquidity into the market,\" Ras said. \"If the Fed doesn't do this, then we could face a serious contraction, punctuated by a possible credit crunch. Either way, all roads appear to be leading to a loosening of monetary policy sooner rather than later.\"\n\nRas isn't alone in his bullishness. Standard Chartered published a recent note that said bitcoin could soar to $100,000 by the middle of next year, and Matrixport predicted that bitcoin could more than double to about $65,000 by next April.\n\nA hedge against financial turmoil\n\nAs the banking crisis that started with Silicon Valley Bank in March continues to spark contagion fears, more retail and institutional investors have been turning to bitcoin as a hedge, Ras said.\n\nThat turmoil re-emerged over the past week as regulators seized First Republic on Monday and sold the bulk of its assets to JPMorgan, triggered sell-offs at regional banks PacWest Bancorp and Western Alliance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The banking crisis helped to cement the narrative of bitcoin serving as a key store of value that lacks the sort of counterparty risk of holding funds by way of bank deposits,\" Ras said. \"Bitcoin offers protection by way of decentralization, self-custody and a network that has never been hacked.\"\n\nBut a credit crisis poses the biggest downside risk for bitcoin, he said. In such a scenario, bitcoin as well as gold, another traditional safe-haven investment, could see a sharp decline in value.\n\n\"I'm not sure such a scenario would happen,\" Ras said, \"but it's possible and would unleash a tremendous amount of volatility, not only for bitcoin but all markets.\""

        "title": "Bhutan has secretly mined Bitcoin in the Himalayas for years - and it did it sustainably - Euronews",
        "content": "The South Asian kingdom hopes to become the second country in the world to run its state-owned crypto mine.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBhutan, a South Asian kingdom nested in the Himalayan mountains, has recently revealed a secret that stunned the international financial market: the country has been quietly mining crypto for years without telling a soul - including its own citizens.\n\nAn even more stunning revelation was that the country has been able to mine crypto in a sustainable way compared to more commonly used methods which have been widely criticised for the large amounts of electricity required.\n\nBhutan has been able to mine for tokens using its massive stores of hydroelectricity - a renewable source of energy that can be largely considered to be \u201cgreen\u201d.\n\nBhutan has an abundance of hydroelectricity - a form of renewable energy that uses the power of moving water to generate electricity - thanks to the ancient glaciers feeding the many rivers flowing through the country.\n\nEnergy generated by hydroelectricity is currently fuelling the homes of most of the country\u2019s 777,000-strong population, and it represents 30 per cent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nBut Bhutan\u2019s recently revealed secret shows that the country has also been putting this immense resource to work for another purpose that could boost and sustain its economy in the future: the creation of its own crypto mines.\n\nBhutan is not alone in betting on cryptocurrencies for its future. The Central American state of El Salvador is currently the only country in the world to run state-owned crypto mines.\n\nWith its small size and limited resources, green crypto mining could be the solution to Bhutan\u2019s economic independence, a country that has struggled for years to establish its self-sufficiency.\n\nBhutan has the advantage of its resources and environment making the country an ideal space for digital asset mining operations.\n\nHydroelectricity is cheap, and the country\u2019s mountains, being so tall, provide the perfect environment to cool down heated-producing computers that are busy mining for Bitcoin. The country\u2019s crypto mines could, at least on paper, have little to no carbon footprint at all.\n\nWhy was this a secret - and why has it now been revealed?\n\nThe South Asian kingdom has reportedly been mining \u201cfor years,\u201d though it\u2019s not exactly clear for how long, where, or what earnings did it make.\n\nSpeaking to a local newspaper The Bhutanese, a government representative recently said that the country has begun mining \u201ca few years ago as one of the early entrants when the price of Bitcoin was around $5,000 (\u20ac4.548)\u201d.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has since soared to $29,228.12 (\u20ac26.591,74) as of Friday.\n\nThe reason why the country has shared its secret crypto-mining operations might be linked to the fact that the kingdom is now looking for partners to further expand its project.\n\nThe country\u2019s investment arm, state-owned holding company Druk Holding & Investments (DHI), and Nasdaq-listed mining company Bitdeer are reportedly seeking investors for $500 million (\u20ac454.9 million) to be used to develop green crypto mining in the kingdom.\n\nFundraising to create Bhutan\u2019s carbon-free digital mining will begin at the end of May, as reported by Bloomberg.\n\nMeanwhile, Bhutan\u2019s larger neighbours - India and China - remain wary of crypto.\n\nBoth India\u2019s government and central bank have taken a strong stance against it, while China officially banned crypto trading in 2021."

        "content": "A pseudonymous Bitcoin and Lightning Network developer going by the name \u201cSupernestnet\u201d was poking around Ordinal Theory \u2014 Ordinals for short \u2014 on Thursday, when he discovered a bug.\n\nOrdinals are an attempt to make Bitcoin fun again. They allow text, images and code to be \u201cinscribed\u201d on a satoshi \u2014 the smallest denomination of bitcoin. Each satoshi has a unique number between 0 and (eventually) 2,100 trillion, assigned in the order in which they are mined. While usually thought of as fungible, the Ordinals protocol makes them non-fungible, like an NFT.\n\nJust as each satoshi is numbered, each Ordinals inscription has a number \u2014 there are more than 3.7 million of them to date.\n\nSupernestnet found a way to break inscription numbers, by inscribing a satoshi that he didn\u2019t own. Then, just as he inadvertently riffed on the Bhagavad Gita, thinking it was an homage to the film Oppenheimer, he also asked rhetorically whether he had \u201cbroken\u201d Ordinals.\n\nSource: https://github.com/supertestnet/breaker-of-jpegs\n\nNot so much, according to Danny Diekroeger, founder and CEO at Deezy, who works on infrastructure for the Lightning Network.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\n\u201cInscription numbers are just a vanity metric putting an order to which inscriptions came first,\u201d he tweeted. \u201c[S]ome collectors like having the 100,000th inscription, for example\u2026these are all messed up now, because [Supertestnet]\u2019s transaction exposed some logic in the software.\u201d\n\nIt was an \u201cedge case\u201d and only provides a new example of a known issue, according to Ordinals advocate, LeonidasNFT. They said on Twitter, \u201cthere has been debate about inscription numbers being off by a lot more than one for almost three months now.\u201d\n\nPlus, it may all have been a marketing ploy.\n\nIs it funny? A little. Is it important? Not really.\n\nWhat is notable is that mean-average transaction fees have increased by just shy of 300% in the past two weeks, according to a Galaxy Research note on Friday.\n\nIt currently costs between $5 and $6 to get a transaction through the Bitcoin mempool.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the points of Ordinals, as its originator, Casey Rodarmor, noted right off the bat: \u201cSince Bitcoin requires the development of a robust fee market, this is a strong positive of the proposal.\u201d\n\nBut the recent bump in transaction fees likely has more to do with the \u201cDeFi on Bitcoin\u201d efforts around the BRC-20 token standard, which shares a similar technique with Ordinals but is used differently.\n\nGalaxy Research views this as \u201ca notable development for Bitcoin,\u201d but whether it has any long-term significance remains to be seen. It seems rather like trying to fit a diamond peg in a round hole.\n\nBut fine: Experiments are being run on Bitcoin. Some people think it\u2019s fun and good for Bitcoin. Others are mad.\n\nBitcoin continues, as always, just with slightly higher transaction fees.\n\nIn any case, Supertestnet has now changed their story.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin Mixers Are a Double-Edged Sword for Anti-Money Laundering Efforts - Brave New Coin Insights",
        "content": "Why Bitcoin Mixers Are a Double-Edged Sword for Anti-Money Laundering Efforts\n\nAlthough bitcoin mixers are frequently targeted by financial regulators in relation to anti-money laundering efforts, they are also used for a range of legitimate purposes such as protecting financial privacy and avoiding nefarious transaction monitoring.\n\nBitcoin has become one of the world\u2019s most popular forms of payment due to its convenience, speed, and low transaction fees. However, as more and more people use bitcoin for everyday transactions, privacy concerns have arisen. Bitcoin transactions are pseudo-anonymous, meaning that while transactions are recorded on a public blockchain, the identities of the sender and recipient are not necessarily known. This anonymity has made bitcoin a popular choice for those who value their privacy. However, the pseudo-anonymity of bitcoin has also made it attractive to criminals who use it for illegal activities such as money laundering. Since on-chain analytics companies can easily trace any blockchain transaction, more and more crypto users prefer coin-anonymizing services such as bitcoin mixers or bitcoin tumblers.\n\nBitcoin mixers have become a popular tool for those who want to keep their financial transactions private. While the concept of bitcoin mixers may seem innocent enough, they have become a double-edged sword in the fight against money laundering. According to a report by Chainalysis, a blockchain analytics company, the total value of bitcoin transferred through mixers increased from $11 million in 2022 to $67 million in 2023. This represents an increase of 500% in just one year. In this article, we will explore why bitcoin mixers are problematic for anti-money laundering efforts and how they can be used in a positive way.\n\nThe Dark Side of Bitcoin Mixers\n\nBitcoin mixers are online services that allow users to mix their bitcoins with other users\u2019 bitcoins. This process is also known as bitcoin mixing or bitcoin tumbling. The idea behind bitcoin mixing is to make it difficult for anyone to trace a bitcoin transaction back to its original owner.\n\nThis anonymity is a major problem for anti-money laundering efforts. Criminals can use bitcoin mixers to launder money by mixing their illegally obtained bitcoins with legitimate ones. The process of mixing makes it almost impossible to trace the illegal bitcoins back to their original source.\n\nAccording to a report by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental organization that develops anti-money laundering guidelines, bitcoin mixers are one of the biggest threats to anti-money laundering efforts in the cryptocurrency space. The report states that mixers are mostly used by criminals to launder money and avoid detection by law enforcement. Although cryptocurrencies are often singled out by politicians and enforcement agencies when discussing money laundering, the reality is that crypto-related money laundering is a drop in the bucket compared to the global money laundering total.\n\nFor example, in 2021 Chainalysis estimated around US$9 billion was laundered using cryptocurrencies. In the same time period, the United Nations office on Drugs and Crime estimated total global money laundering to be at least $800 billion annually \u2013 and potentially up to $2 trillion. Even more surprising is the number of respected international banks that were fined in 2021 in relation to breaches of anti-money laundering laws and regulations.\n\nThe Positive Side of Bitcoin Mixers\n\nWhile bitcoin mixers are problematic for anti-money laundering efforts, they are also used for legitimate purposes. Many people use bitcoin mixers to protect their financial privacy and avoid potential transaction monitoring. For example, when someone buys something online using bitcoin, they may not want the seller to know their identity. By using a bitcoin mixer, they can ensure that their transaction is anonymous and cannot be traced back to them. Bitcoin mixing can help protect them from potential fraud or identity theft.\n\nBitcoin mixers are also often used by businesses to protect their financial information from competitors. If a company is making a large transaction, it may not want its competitors to know how much money it is moving. By using a bitcoin mixer, they can ensure that their transaction is private and cannot be traced back to them.\n\nAnother reason for seeking transaction privacy is political persecution. Of 205 countries and territories surveyed by Freedom House recently, in terms of their political rights and civil liberties, the NGO found 125 to be either \u2018not free\u2019 or only \u2018partly free\u2019. Political movements are costly to organise, and cutting of access to funding is a common tactic of oppressive governments.\n\nIn terms of personal security, bitcoin mixers can be used by law-abiding citizens to protect themselves from hacking and theft. By mixing their bitcoins with others, users can disguise the origin of their funds, making it more difficult for hackers to target them.\n\nTendencies to Regulate the Use of Bitcoin Mixers\n\nAs bitcoin has grown in popularity, there have been attempts by governments and regulators to bring it under their control. This has led to discussions about the regulation of bitcoin mixers, which are seen by some as only a tool for money laundering. In some countries, bitcoin mixers are currently illegal or operate in a legal gray area.\n\nFor example, in the United States, the use of bitcoin mixers is considered a violation of anti-money laundering laws, while in Japan, bitcoin mixers can only operate if they are licensed by the government. Similarly, in the European Union, bitcoin mixers are subject to anti-money laundering regulations and must comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin mixers are a double-edged sword for anti-money laundering efforts. While they can be used for illicit purposes, they also have legitimate uses in protecting financial privacy and preventing hacking and theft. It is important for governments and regulators to strike a balance between preventing illicit activity and protecting the legitimate uses of bitcoin mixers. Furthermore, the positive aspects of bitcoin mixers should not be overlooked. They are an important tool for individuals and businesses seeking to protect their financial privacy and secure their funds. The use of bitcoin mixers can help increase the adoption and mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies, which can lead to greater financial inclusion and economic empowerment. To fully realize the benefits of bitcoin mixers, it is important to promote transparency and collaboration between governments, regulators, and the cryptocurrency community. By working together, we can ensure that bitcoin mixers are used in a way that is responsible, legal, and beneficial for everyone. Ultimately, bitcoin mixers are an important tool in the cryptocurrency landscape that can be used for both good and bad. By recognizing their potential and working to mitigate their negative effects, we can create a safer and fairer financial system for all."

        "content": "The ongoing trading frenzy of memecoins like Pepe Coin (PEPE) has triggered an unwanted consequence for Bitcoin (BTC) \u2014 driving its transaction costs to multi-year highs.\n\nBitcoin transaction fees surged in early May, reaching their highest point over the past two years, according to data from Crypto Fees.\n\nOn May 3, the total amount of fees paid on the Bitcoin blockchain reached $3.5 million, jumping about 400% from late April. The average Bitcoin transaction fee reached as much as $7.2, according to YCharts.\n\nTotal Bitcoin transaction fees between May 2021 and May 2023. Source: CryptoFees\n\nThe latest increase in BTC transaction fees is primarily attributed to a surge in Bitcoin activity involving BRC-20 transactions. According to data from Galaxy Research, 50% of all Bitcoin transactions on May 2 were related to BRC-20 transactions.\n\nModeled after Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 token standard, BRC-20 is an experimental token standard allowing users to issue and transfer fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. The standard was introduced in March 2023 by a pseudonymous on-chain analyst known as Domo.\n\nThe BRC-20 token standard has quickly become a major trend in the cryptocurrency industry, specifically amid the sharp growth of the PEPE memecoin. The token has rallied more than 600% over the past seven days, reaching its all-time high of $0.00000216 on May 5.\n\nPEPE 30-day price chart. Source: CoinGecko\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain isn\u2019t the only blockchain affected by the ongoing memecoin hype.

The Ethereum blockchain remains the most expensive network in terms of transaction fees at the time of writing.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin miners have earned $50B from BTC block rewards, fees since 2010\n\nDespite the latest spike in Bitcoin transaction fees, the current BTC transaction cost is still far from all-time high levels. The highest Bitcoin transaction fees were recorded in April 2021, when the average BTC transaction cost almost reached $70 amid a major decline in the Bitcoin network hash rate. The previous highest point in BTC transaction fees was in 2017, with transaction costs surging above $60.\n\nMagazine: Asia Express: Justin Sun\u2019s SUI-farming sins, PEPE\u2019s wild run, 3AC\u2019s oyster philosophy"

        "content": "There've been rivers of ink written on all aspects of cryptocurrency ever since that fateful day of the Bitcoin whitepaper publishing. Still, one question that's repeatedly brought to the limelight (and understandably so) surrounds energetic and environmental sustainability. Now, the White House itself is adding fuel to the fire through its DAME Tax proposal, whose aim is, and we quote: \"making cryptominers pay for costs they impose on others.\"\n\nHow, you ask? By phasing in an additional 30% tax penalty for cryptocurrency mining firms on any energy they consume in that process. According to the White House, this is \"an example of the President's commitment to addressing both long-standing national challenges as well as emerging risks \u2013 in this case, the economic and environmental costs of current practices for mining crypto assets.\" The idea is simple: Bitcoin mining consumes a lot of power; this consumption drives electricity prices up; which is bad for everyone unfortunate enough to share a grid with a cryptocurrency mining firm.\n\nIt seems that the White House's hand has been forced by their very own report, which estimates total Bitcoin mining energy consumption in 2022 at an eye-watering 50 billion kilowatt-hours (in fact, the estimate places consumption anywhere between the low of 30 billion kWh and a high of 60 billion kWh). That's greater power consumption than all operating computers in the United States put together - and within the margin of error of the countrywide electrical consumption for as basic a necessity as lighting.\n\nIt's also more energy than Americans consume through their TV sets, and it's right here, in a nice graph:\n\n(Image credit: The White House)\n\nLet's get this straight right off the bat: public and private lighting is definitely (and inarguably) more important than Bitcoin mining.\n\nHowever, some arguments favoring the proposal seem to be mired in inconsistencies. Back when Intel announced its \"Bonanza Mine\" cryptocurrency mining chips, we took a relatively detailed look at Bitcoin's global power consumption and the utility that can already be extracted from it: anyone who has taken profits can attest to its utility; anyone who sold anything to someone and got paid in Bitcoin can attest to its utility; so can anyone who crossed an embattled border while invisibly carrying their wealth, or the citizens of El Salvador, where Bitcoin is legal tender. I'd be interested to know which process the White House used to quantitatively analyze cryptocurrency applications' social benefits before concluding that they \"are yet to materialize.\"\n\nThere's also the question of what amount of Bitcoin's energy consumption actually hails from carbon-intensive sources; according to the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC), a global forum of mining companies that represents 48.4% of the worldwide Bitcoin mining network, it's estimated that in Q4 2022, renewable energy sources accounted for 58.9% of the electricity used to mine bitcoin - against an estimated 36.8% as of Q1 2021.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see what results from this legislative push. For one, a 30% tax for cryptocurrency mining firms would drive most of them out of business, resulting in a concentration of hashing power in the hands of the few firms with strong enough financials to stand above the waterline. That would be terrible for Bitcoin, whose network security assumes that processing power is distributed, not concentrated. We wouldn't go so far as saying that Bitcoin Core devs would be open to changing Bitcoin's security model from Proof of Work (the cause for the monumental energy consumption) to Proof of Stake (Ethereum did this transition through its Merge, basically cutting its energy consumption on transaction validation by over 99%). But Ethereum isn't Bitcoin, and Bitcoin isn't the only Proof of Work cryptocurrency out there."

        "content": "The principal way in which issuers seek to avoid violating securities law is through decentralization. If a cryptocurrency is developed in such a way that a securities regulator could not identify a central, coordinated group responsible for driving up the value of the token, then the asset is less likely to be considered a security. That is one reason why decentralized finance (DeFi) projects take measures to decentralize the development of their projects and split up governance with decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), as well as involve mechanisms like proof-of-stake as a consensus mechanism. The argument being that if people are both investors as well as participate in the growth of the project, either by staking the coin and becoming validators, or voting in DAO decisions, they are no longer solely relying on the \u201cthird party\u201d to produce returns that the Howey test requires."

While observers are unsure about short-term moves, the consensus remains that Bitcoin\u2019s upside mainly lies ahead as the block subsidy halving approaches.\n\nWhen tracking what comes next, however, it may be enough to look at past halving cycles, specifically, volatility.\n\nAs Titan of Crypto notes, Bollinger Bands on monthly timeframes are setting up a repeat of a breakout event that has occurred only once in each cycle.\n\nIn the two previous instances shown on an accompanying chart from 2016 and 2019, BTC/USD broke through into the upper section of the Bollinger Band channel to see significant gains.\n\nBollinger Bands are a key volatility indicator across price timeframes. They revolve around a 20-period simple moving average (SMA) functioning as a midline, with two standard deviations above and below representing the channel.\n\nThese bands expand and contract with volatility and certain events: among them, the price coming into contact with the bands or even breaking beyond them is often considered important by traders.\n\nCurrently, the one-month BTC/USD chart shows the price attempting to break above the SMA line, which, if confirmed, would suggest a classic repeat of past bull runs.\n\nCommenting, Titan of Crypto described it as an \u201cinexorable breakout.\u201c\n\n\u201dBTC is about to break its monthly Bollinger Bands base line. And when that happens 1st target will follow inexorably,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThat would bring Bitcoin to a solid $63,500.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart. Source: Titan of Crypto/ Twitter\n\nWhile not quite enough to match its current all-time high, the price target could come around the point of the halving in one year\u2019s time. How long it will need in reality remains to be seen, Titan of Crypto acknowledged.\n\nBTC price bides its time\n\nLast month, John Bollinger, the band\u2019s creator, himself argued that Bitcoin was at a crucial point on daily timeframes.\n\nRelated: Is Bitcoin overbought or oversold? Use Bollinger Bands to find out!\n\nAt the time, the price was retesting the SMA line as support, breaking through to range around it. Now, however, it is heading higher toward the upper band, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows.\n\nBTC/USD 1-day candle chart (Bitstamp) with Bollinger bands.

        "title": "What is cryptocurrency? Crypto explained simply. - CCN.com",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency, also known as digital or virtual currency, has become a popular form of investment and transaction. However, not all cryptocurrencies are the same.\n\nAt its core, cryptocurrency is a decentralized digital form of currency enabled to process financial transactions on the internet. Bitcoin was the first decentralized cryptocurrency launched in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto through the publication of a white paper called \u201cBitcoin: A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System\u201d.\n\nIn the crypto world, Bitcoin stands out as the leader of cryptocurrency and is widely recognized and highly regarded in this space as being robust and sound money.\n\nFor the last 14 years, Bitcoin and other digital currencies like Ethereum have emerged as alternatives to traditional government-issued fiat currencies. A fiat currency is a currency that is backed by a country and not a commodity like gold or silver, like the United States Dollar (USD).\n\nAt the start of 2023, the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization include: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, Tether, Cardano, Polkadot, Dogecoin, XRP, Uniswap, and Solana. Market capitalization is the total value of the cryptocurrency asset when taking all the supply in circulation multiplied by the price.\n\nThese rankings of largest cryptocurrency coins fluctuate quickly in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies and are likely to change throughout the year due to their speculative nature. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two top competing cryptocurrencies in market capitalisation over the last decade as they have seen their total value grow year on year.\n\nCryptocurrency uses a unique, anonymous, and verifiable approach to making transactions peer-to-peer without using a third party involved, and is not controlled by a central authority.\n\nImagine you have a family member who is abroad and needs money over a weekend when banks are closed. By using crypto you can send money to your family member without the need of a bank. This is what it means to transact peer-to-peer: there is no third party involved.\n\nIt does this through the use of a decentralized open and public ledger, called the blockchain.\n\nA blockchain can be simply defined as a decentralized, digital ledger that records monetary transactions across a network of computers in a secure and transparent manner.\n\nCryptocurrencies will continue to be accepted in society because they address the key characteristics of money:\n\n\u2013 Durability of cryptocurrencies is supported by their decentralized and digital nature, which eliminates the risk of physical damage.\n\n\u2013 Divisibility allows for the creation of smaller units of the currency to facilitate transactions. Crypto enables micro transactions to be made.\n\n\u2013 Portability of cryptocurrencies is greatly enhanced by their digital form, which enables them to be stored and transferred easily through the internet.\n\n\u2013 Scarcity is ensured through the design of cryptocurrencies, with a limited supply of coins, preventing inflation.\n\n\u2013 Acceptability of cryptocurrencies is increasing as more merchants and individuals recognize and begin to accept them as a form of payment.\n\nHow Does Cryptocurrency Work?\n\nCryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum store transactions on a public ledger known as a blockchain. A blockchain can be thought of as a digital ledger available online for anyone to see and review. You can think of it in a similar fashion to a bank statement sent by the bank outlining all transactions you made at the end of each month.\n\nThe difference is that only authorized personnel and the client of the bank can review the transactions on a personal bank statement. Unlike an open-sourced blockchain which allows anybody to review all transactions. This ensures trust as the blockchain is verified by the whole of the network and can not be corrupted.\n\nEvery ten minutes all the Bitcoin transactions made globally are stamped together and put into an individual block or timestamp.\n\nThis ten minute block is then cryptographically chained to the previous block and cannot be changed or altered at any point in the future after it has been chained to the blockchain.\n\nCryptocurrency is created through a process called mining, which involves the use of computing power to solve complex mathematical problems which once solved miners are rewarded with newly minted coins every ten minutes.\n\nIf you are not a miner you can purchase cryptocurrencies from brokers and store them safely on cryptographic wallets which can be defined as hot or cold wallets.\n\nHistory of Cryptocurrencies\n\nDigital cryptography has been studied for decades and Bitcoin is an improvement on many past attempts at \u201cdigital cash\u201d experiments like Hashcash in 1997, which was created by Adam Back who is a developer that is also cited in the Bitcoin white paper.\n\nHashcash was a cryptographic hash-based proof-of-work algorithm, which is a concept adopted by Satoshi in his white paper.\n\nOther cryptographers and pioneers in this space include personalities like David Chaum who was the first person to propose the idea for cryptocurrency in a paper published in 1983, outlining an early form of anonymous cryptographic electronic money.\n\nBitgold, which is often deemed a direct precursor to Bitcoin, was designed in 1998 by Nick Szabo, another cypherpunk and pioneer in the crypto space.\n\nOver the last fourteen years, the crypto space has seen thousands of coins enter the market. Bitcoin and a few others such as Ethereum and Litecoin are withstanding the test of time.\n\nToday the total market cap of the space has grown to $1 trillion USD, hitting highs of $3 trillion in the 2021 bull run. The total market cap has been forecasted by some analysts to touch the market cap of Gold at $8 trillion in mid-long term future and eventually hit $100 trillion once the space matures.\n\nTypes of Cryptocurrencies\n\nThe crypto space has different kinds of coins created for different purposes. Some of these include:\n\nProof-of-work coins that can be used to buy things, store value, or act as a commodity similar to gold and silver. These coins include but are not limited to Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value and are often pegged to a fiat currency such as the US dollar or gold. Some of the most popular stablecoins today are Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), and Binance USD (BUSD). Proof-of-stake coins are cryptocurrencies that adopt a digital voting system where instead of miners using computers to solve complex math problems, a group of individuals are chosen to validate transactions based on the amount of digital coins they hold or \u201cstake\u201d in the network. The benefit of this concept is that there are large energy savings compared to the Proof-of-Work system. Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL) are three popular coins that use proof of stake. Defi coins are cryptocurrencies that were born as applications that use public blockchains and crypto assets to disrupt the traditional finance sector. Uniswap (UNI), Chainlink (LINK), and Aave (AAVE) are three popular coins that serve decentralized finance purposes. NFTs are non-fungible tokens that are unique digital assets that represent ownership or authenticity of a specific item or piece of content. NFTs are secured and backed by blockchain technology and cannot be duplicated. Each NFT is unique and cannot be tampered with. Ethereum, Algorand, and Tezos are some names competing in this space to produce NFTs.\n\nAdvantages of Cryptocurrencies\n\nCryptocurrency offers the alternative of better security using decentralization, faster and cheaper cross-border transactions, anonymity in transactions, and reduced dependence on traditional financial institutions.\n\nIt is an attempt at a modern monetary framework, which works in harmony with the internet, is open 24-7, and ensures freedom and empowerment through the use of true digital scarcity.\n\nIt eliminates the need for intermediaries which significantly lowers transaction costs.\n\nCryptocurrencies can pose as monetary lifeboats against resistance to the degradation of fiat versus inflation.\n\nIronically some consider Bitcoin as one of the hardest money known to man yet cannot even be touched or seen physically, due to its intangible nature.\n\nThis is a benefit because it allows its holder to migrate from country to country and all that individual needs to access the holdings is a seed. This cannot be done with cash or gold as an individual runs the risk to have their physical holdings confiscated when crossing borders.\n\nDisadvantages of Cryptocurrencies\n\nCryptocurrency also has several disadvantages. These include a lack of widespread acceptance to date, high price volatility, the risk of hacking or loss of funds, regulatory uncertainty, and limited consumer protections.\n\nIn addition, its complex background and groundbreaking technology can be confusing for the average person. It has also been associated with illegal activities which could slow down a wider acceptance.\n\nFinally, there is an age-old debate in the crypto space about the overuse of energy consumption concerns related to the process of mining the coins.\n\nCryptocurrency Mining\n\nMining is the application of high-performance computing systems using specialized application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips.\n\nMiners receive new bitcoins as a reward for processing transactions through the reward protocol. The reward is distributed at a rate of 6.25 bitcoins every 10 minutes in a random and fair manner among miners who contribute to securing the network.\n\nThink of mining as an analogy to the process of finding physical gold. There is no guarantee that miners will discover gold, but those with the best resources have a higher likelihood of success. However, the outcome remains random.\n\nMining plays a critical role in securing the Bitcoin network and enables stakeholders to engage in transactions without intermediaries, even though the miners themselves are not intermediaries. Participants can freely join or leave the network at any time, thereby preserving their anonymity.\n\nCrypto Regulation\n\nRegulation has been debated over since cryptocurrency began a decade ago.\n\nToday many crypto enthusiasts and institutional investors are working with regulators to bring in regulation to help mature the industry.\n\nRegulatory uncertainty mainly surrounds crypto exchanges, stablecoins, security tokens, DEFI exchanges and yield products.\n\nThere are also questions about Over-the-counter (OTC) trading, margin loans, tax disclosures, and security disclosures still need to be answered, with the US who will likely set the global standard for regulation.\n\nIn America, the SEC and CFTC have unofficially classified Bitcoin as a commodity. This means that when regulation surfaces it will not be regulated as a security unlike other altcoins.\n\nIn Europe, The EU has voted against the banning of proof-of-work in 2022 which was deemed a positive move for crypto acceptance.\n\nCrypto Security\n\nBlockchain uses advanced security features like hashing, digital signatures, and public-key cryptography to secure transactions.\n\nDespite this, blockchain is not completely secure and can have vulnerabilities that affect its security. Each investor should avoid speculating on risky projects and carry out due diligence.\n\nStoring your wealth in Bitcoin and Ethereum is considered a safer option, while other cryptocurrencies pose a higher level of risk. It is important to do your due diligence before speculating on a cryptocurrency.\n\nCryptocurrency Wallets\n\nOnce cryptocurrency is purchased on an exchange it is recommended that you withdraw the crypto asset from that exchange and deposit it onto a digital wallet. A wallet can come in different formats.\n\nA hot wallet is a wallet that is always connected to the internet. This can be found in an app on your mobile phone.\n\nis a wallet that is always connected to the internet. This can be found in an app on your mobile phone. A cold wallet is a physical USB looking type device that remains offline. Keeping your cryptocurrency offline or in a cold wallet, such as a Ledger Nano device, helps to protect it from hacking.\n\nBy holding your cryptocurrency on a digital wallet, you are sovereign which means you own your own private key and access to your cryptocurrency. The private key provides you access to a secure digital wallet, which is protected by a seed phrase consisting of 12 to 24 words.\n\nIf the cold wallet is lost, the seed phrase can be used to recover the cryptocurrency on another device.\n\nFor added security, it\u2019s recommended to keep a smaller amount in a hot wallet, which is connected to the internet, and store the majority of your cryptocurrency in a cold wallet. Some popular cold wallet brands include Ledger and Trezor.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is cryptocurrency?\n\nCryptocurrency is a unique, anonymous, and verifiable approach to making transactions peer-to-peer without a third party involved.\n\nWhat are the benefits of cryptocurrency?\n\nCryptocurrency offers financial privacy, lower transaction fees and is decentralized. This means that it is not controlled by any single authority or institution. It also offers the potential for more secure and transparent transactions due to the use of blockchain technology.\n\nHow is a cryptocurrency created?\n\nThere are different ways cryptocurrency can be created. When we refer to Bitcoin, new Bitcoin is created through the act of mining. Miners use this technology to account for the transactions on the network and order them into blocks for which they are rewarded every ten minutes. When a block is found new Bitcoin is mined out of the protocol which increases the money supply incrementally every ten minutes.\n\nWhat are the risks of using cryptocurrencies?\n\nIf you hold cryptocurrency on an exchange you are at risk of the exchange running away with your crypto. It is important to get the crypto off the exchange and into your private wallet."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThere\u2019s fresh controversy brewing in the Bitcoin Ordinals community after a developer under the moniker \u201cSupertestnet\u201d initiated a transaction that had no input or output, but is nevertheless seen as valid.\n\nThis resulted in the Ordinals\u2019s inscription numbering system crashing, sparking concerns that the whole protocol may now be broken.\n\nOrdinal inscriptions, also known as \"proof of ownership\" inscriptions, are essentially a way of attaching metadata to a specific Bitcoin transaction.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis metadata can include information about the digital asset being transferred, such as its title, description, and ownership details. So far, it's also been used for a wide array of on-chain media inscriptions including artwork, profile pictures, playable games, and video-based web apps.\n\nUnlike Ethereum-based NFTs, which require the use of a separate token and smart contract to record ownership and transfer of digital assets, Ordinal inscriptions are recorded directly on the Bitcoin blockchain without the need for a sidechain or separate token.\n\nThe transaction in question, which did not include any satoshis (smallest unit of BTC), was found in block 788200.\n\n\u201c[The Ordinals protocol] validated the inscription (3492721) attached to the input, which sounds like a bug,\u201d Ludo Galabru, staff engineer at Hiro Systems commented on the issue on GitHub. \u201cPhilosophically, the satoshi inscribed was transferred to the miner as a transaction fee, but was nevertheless inscribed by its previous owner.\u201d\n\nThe Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor agreed that \u201cit shouldn't be possible to inscribe sats that you don't own,\u201d suggesting the transaction is indeed a bug.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHowever, fixing the bug by making [the Ordinals protocol] ignore this inscription would change inscription numbers after the curious transaction. I'm honestly not sure what to do!\u201d added Rodarmor soon after the issue was found.\n\nBut is there an actual danger for the Ordinals protocol?\n\nBitcoin Ordinals under scrutiny\n\nAccording to Danny Diekroeger, founder of Bitcoin Lightning platform Deezy, the bug doesn\u2019t pose any risk to the Ordinals protocol itself.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I think this is totally fine. In fact, I think inscription numbers were broken already early on anyway,\u201d Diekroeger tweeted on Friday.\n\npersonally, i think this is totally fine. in fact, i think inscription numbers were broken already early on anywayhttps://t.co/sGrldlh8FT \u2014 danny \u26a1\ufe0f deezy (@dannydiekroeger) May 4, 2023\n\nSupertestnet agreed that there\u2019s no immediate danger to the protocol itself, although he is \u201cnot sure not sure what long-term consequences will be.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe short-term consequence was that the guys who were running indexing software had to fix the bug,\u201d Supertestnet told Decrypt.\n\nWhat actually happened and what prompted the Austin-based developer to run such an experiment, which Diekroeger described as \u201cthe first valiant attack on ordinal inscriptions?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to Supertestnet, it all started during a recent conference in Austin, where a hackathon was held and people were supposed to be coming up with projects, and the idea was born to try to make \u201csome weird thing in Bitcoin and create a transaction that sends somebody zero Satoshis.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one at the conference wanted to do that project, so I did something else. But afterward, I tried it and created one of these weird transactions and broadcasted it to a miner who mined it for me,\u201d Supertestnet told Decrypt.\n\nCalling himself the \u201cbreaker of jpegs,\u201d Supertestnet not only inserted this bug into Ordinal explorers but also created a tool that lets other users increase the attack.\n\nWait did I just break ordinals? https://t.co/V41NQt9aQz \u2014 Super Testnet (@super_testnet) May 4, 2023\n\nYet, he also admitted that \u201cit\u2019s not entirely clear to me exactly what's happening right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cNormally, when you create an inscription, you have to create a Bitcoin address that has some satoshis in it. And then you create an image that the software assigns to one of the satoshis in your Bitcoin address. But my Bitcoin address had zero satoshis in it. So it seems that it assigned it a negative number, which is weird by itself,\u201d explained Supertestnet.\n\nDespite that, when the software encountered this negative number it appears to have tried to give this inscription a number.\n\n\u201cIt took that and then either made it the first satoshi in the block, which then belongs to the miner, or it put it in the previous transaction\u2019s transaction fee, which then went to the miner. Either way, it definitely went to the miner like that's the inscription,\" Supertestnet said. \"But that's not supposed to happen. You're not supposed to be able to inscribe somebody else's satoshis without their consent. So that's like a bug.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThings are \u201ca little more complicated\u201d for Ordinals explorers, according to the developer, because all the numbers after his inscription are off by one.\n\n\u201cIf they decide to fix that, they will have to undo all the numbers that have been issued since then, like decrementing them all by one or by however many they're off by one now. But they might not fix it, or they may fix it for the future but all the previous ones are going to remain like they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't know what they'll do, maybe they\u2019ll decide that it\u2019s not important anymore and that it\u2019s not the bug but a feature,\u201d added Supertestnet."

        "content": "The Nasdaq, which plunged in value following both the dotcom bubble and financial crisis, more than doubled in value in the following five years of post-bubble recovery. Like the Nasdaq, bitcoin could recover rapidly in the medium-term, analysis suggests.\n\nWith the 200-day moving average of bitcoin reversing its trend for the first time in 16 months and various technical indicators demonstrating a positive near-term trend for the asset, many industry executives and investment firms like Pantera Capital believe bitcoin has bottomed out.\n\nIf $3,122 Was the Bottom, Bitcoin is En Route to a Strong Recovery\n\nAs suggested by Bloomberg\u2019s emerging markets analyst Michael Patterson, if bitcoin found its bottom at $3,122 in December 2018, the dominant cryptocurrency may be en route to a strong upside price movement in the years to come.\n\n\u201cIf Bitcoin has in fact bottomed out, history suggests there could be further upside. The Nasdaq more than doubled in the five years after its post-bubble low and has since reached record highs that are well above its peak during dot-com mania,\u201d Patterson wrote .\u201d\n\nSince hitting its 12-month low, the bitcoin price has rebounded to $5,000, recording a staggering 60 percent increase in value within less than four months.\n\nPreviously, former International Monetary Fund (IMF) economist Mark Dow said that bitcoin investors should head for the exits if the asset fails to recover to the $5,000 to $6,000 region, as it would lead the asset vulnerable to a potentially large downside movement.\n\nWhat Makes Analysts Confident Bitcoin Found its Bottom?\n\nEarlier this week, economist and global markets analyst Alex Kr\u00fcger said that whether bitcoin has reached its bottom at $3,122 or not is not up for debate.\n\nPurely based on technical indicators and data, Kr\u00fcger emphasized that when the bitcoin price crossed $4,200, it broke out of its 16-month bear trend.\n\nHe said:\n\n\u201cThe crypto bear market has been over for three months now. BTC breaking above $4,200 will mark the end of the bear trend that started in January 2018. Going to miss this big fellow.\u201d \u201cThis is not a call. Not a matter of aging well or not. A break above 4200 technically ends the bear trend that started Jan 2018. Facts don\u2019t care about opinions. If strong selling resumes later on, that would represent a different trend.\u201d\n\nMoreover, fundamental analysts have said that there exist billions of dollars waiting on the sidelines in the cryptocurrency market to be allocated to crypto assets in the future.\n\nNearly $3 billion ready to flow into BTC and alts. https://t.co/kWTNCtbyZM \u2014 Mati Greenspan (@MatiGreenspan) April 5, 2019\n\nThe caution of strategists in the financial sector is that in the 1990s when Japan\u2019s Nikkei plunged during an intense correction, it struggled to recover until 2009.\n\nHowever, it is difficult to compare the price trend of bitcoin and major stock markets because of contrasting environments.\n\nAs seen in previous bull runs of the cryptocurrency market, cryptocurrencies tend to move in cycles. When the market is on an upside trend, parabolic movements are often spotted. When the market initiates a downward movement, it often suffers intensified volatility.\n\nBitcoin Moves in Short Time Frames\n\nThomas Lee, the head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said that bitcoin tends to record its biggest gains in a 10-day time frame of every year.\n\n2/ Reminder that BTC generally generates all of its performance within 10D of any year.\n\n\u2013ex the top 10 days, BTC is down 25% annually since 2013 pic.twitter.com/zoEocEEZvu \u2014 Thomas (Tom) Lee (not the drummer) FSInsight (@fundstrat) April 2, 2019\n\nAs such, the way bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market behave in terms of short-term price movement is drastically different than how major markets such as the stock market of Japan moves.\n\nIndustry executives remain confident that bitcoin has established its bottom because of the level of activity in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry across all leading markets including the U.S., Japan, and South Korea."

        "content": "The proponent of a second cryptocurrency mine in New Brunswick says the project is still alive, despite concerns from both the government and N.B. Power that the industry would put a strain on the provincial power grid.\n\nChief Fuels said in a press release Thursday that its plans are \"proceeding on schedule\" and the facility will open in Grand Falls in early 2024.\n\nThe company said it has hired a contractor to develop the mine's electrical substation to draw energy from N.B. Power's grid, which the utility worries could be overburdened if more cryptocurrency mines were also on the system.\n\nIn March 2022, Premier Blaine Higgs signed a cabinet order endorsing the utility's refusal to service new crypto mines.\n\n\"The benefit you get back from that versus the consumption of energy \u2014 it was just not a project that made sense for the province,\" Higgs said Friday.\n\nPremier Higgs signed a cabinet order last year endorsing the N.B. Power's refusal to service new crypto mines. (Radio-Canada)\n\nBut it appears the utility signed an agreement to power the second Grand Falls plant before the freeze was put in place.\n\nSpokesperson Dominique Couture wouldn't comment on the Chief Fuels proposal by name, but said \"prior to the pause coming into effect in 2021, two customers completed their interconnection agreements.\"\n\nChief Fuels president Michael Scully turned down an interview request from CBC News and did not respond to follow-up questions sent by email.\n\nSuch \"mines\" run thousands of computers around the clock to conduct millions of transactions and earn cryptocurrency, consuming large amounts of electricity.\n\nDemand on the grid is a concern for N.B. Power because several of its generating stations face uncertain futures or reliability issues.\n\nThe utility came close to not being able to meet an all-time peak demand for electricity during a cold snap in February.\n\nOne bitcoin mine owned by Hive Blockchain Technologies is already operating in Grand Falls. It uses 70 megawatts of power a year.\n\nHive Blockchain Technologies in St. Andr\u00e9 has several warehouses of bitcoin miners in operation. (Shane Fowler/CBC News)\n\nChief Fuels said in its release it has scaled back its original plan for a 50-megawatt mine to 26 megawatts \"due to various commercial considerations.\"\n\nIt said it has \"informed\" N.B. Power of that change.\n\nNo comment from Grand Falls\n\nThe mine was announced in November 2021 when Taal Distributed Information Technologies Inc.said it would buy Chief Fuels and set up the mine in a former McCain Foods fertilizer plant in Grand Falls.\n\nThe combined annual electricity consumption of the Hive and Taal mines, 96 megawatts, is close to the yearly generation of the small modular nuclear reactor model being developed by Arc Clean Energy of Saint John.\n\nA Grand Falls town official said last week she was not sure why the Taal-Chief Fuels mine had not opened yet.\n\nEconomic development director France LeMoignan said the town received the Chief Fuels press release on Thursday.\n\n\"We cannot comment on the situation until a permit has been issued by the municipality's planning department,\" she said in an email.\n\nShe said \"discussions\" have taken place with the town \"but no official documentation has yet been issued.\"\n\nChief Fuels describes itself as a majority Indigenous-owned fuel and lubricant company \"affiliated\" with Michaud Petroleum, a Grand Falls company.\n\nOn its website, Chief Fuels lists its address on Waasis Road at Oromocto First Nation.\n\nTaal said in a November 2021 press release it was acquiring all the shares in Chief Fuels, allowing it to open its crypto mine in a 5,600-square-metre warehouse in Grand Falls."

        "content": "On 1 May, 60% of all transactions on Bitcoin used Taproot, hitting an all-time high.\n\nBitcoin network also recorded $3.5 million in transaction fees, reaching a 2-year high.\n\nThe bull market of 2o23 has led to a sharp spike in network activity on the Bitcoin [BTC] chain. The number of daily transactions and unique active addresses have grown steadily over the last four months.\n\nRead Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nBlockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant devised a Bitcoin Network Activity Index to capture the burgeoning activity on the chain. The index takes into consideration key indicators like transactions, addresses and demand for block space.\n\nInterestingly, the primary reason behind the rise in network traffic was transactions driven by Taproot addresses, as underlined by CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nBitcoin reinvents itself\n\nUp until 2023, Bitcoin\u2019s reputation was restricted to being a peer-to-peer (P2P) payments network with not much real-world utility apart from settling transactions on the chain.\n\nHowever, with the Taproot upgrade, Bitcoin started to position itself like other conventional layer-1 blockchains, enabling deployment of smart contracts on the chain and minting of Ordinals NFTs.\n\nAccording to a data scientist from analytics firm Glassnode, Taproot transactions accounted for over 37% of spent outputs on the Bitcoin network. The demand for Taproot was also reflected through the adoption and utilization metrics.\n\nThe data showed that on 1 May, 60% of all transactions on Bitcoin used Taproot, hitting an all-time high.\n\nAnother notable trend which was worthy of attention was the growing dominance of text inscriptions over image inscriptions when it came to Taproot transactions. In fact, text inscriptions propelled more than 50% of all transactions on the Bitcoin network.\n\nTaproot was an upgrade to improve the privacy, scalability, and security of Bitcoin. It introduced new signature schemes and a flexible transaction structure, to make transactions more efficient and cheaper.\n\nMiners rake in the moolah\n\nDue to the rise in network traffic, miners managed to collect huge transaction fees. Users were willing to shell out more to get their transactions validated quickly. On 3 May, Bitcoin network recorded $3.5 million in transaction fees, hitting a 2-year high.\n\nOn expected lines, Ordinals accounted for a significant chunk of the total fees paid to miners, averaging nearly 21% over the past week, data from a Dune dashboard showed.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nThe crypto community has a divided stance on Ordinals, and in general the idea of smart contracts on Bitcoin. The naysayers object to its non-financial use case which would congest the network and drive up fees on the chain.\n\nAt the time of writing, BTC exchanged hands at $29,240, marking a marginal increase of 0.37% in the last 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has shown very bullish trends lately, and investors are super excited as many altcoins, including VeChain (VET) and Collateral Network (COLT), will likely rise in value in alignment with Bitcoin (BTC).\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nAccording to a report by The Crypto Basic, daily Bitcoin trading volume has increased since March 4. This has convinced many market analysts to believe that Bitcoin (BTC) could pass $35,000 in April. If this happens, then the crypto market may kiss the bears goodbye because a major increase in Bitcoin will stir other cryptocurrencies in a positive direction.\n\nBut as of press time, Bitcoin seems to be repressing. Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped by 11% since trading at over $30k last week. The price of Bitcoin, at the time of writing, is $27,506.52.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nVeChain (VET)\n\nVeChain is a Layer-1 smart contract platform aimed at decentralizing the luxury goods industry. With an efficient team and many big names as partners, VeChain continues to gain popularity in the space. VeChain enables businesses to build dApps and conduct secure and transparent transactions.\n\nBased on an analysis report by Changelly, VeChain has been in an upward trend, increasing by 6.33% in the past seven days. Also, the price of VeChain has increased by 22.04% over the last month, adding a colossal average amount of $0.0049 to its current value \u2014 $0.0224. This presents VeChain as a solid asset if it continues to grow. Collateral Network (COLT)\n\nLike VeChain, Collateral Network (COLT) is also designed to help businesses and individuals by easily unlocking liquidity from their physical assets. In other words, existing businesses or start-ups can pledge their assets as collateral to obtain loans. Physical assets currently accepted by the platform include fine wines, art, collectibles, vintage cars, real estate, and watches, among others.\n\nWhen borrowers send their physical assets to the platform, the team at Collateral Network authenticates, values, and stores the assets in its vault for the loan duration. Then, it mints NFTs to represent the value of the assets.\n\nThese NFTs are then fractionalized, allowing multiple lenders to contribute to the loan when they purchase the NFTs. Therefore, individuals or businesses needing loans receive them instantly, while lenders earn significant returns from fixed interest rates.\n\nInterFi Network and SolidProof have both audited Collateral Network, and a 33-year liquidity lock after presale will be performed after the presale ends, cementing Collateral Network as one of the best investment options on the market!\n\nDue to its unique model, experts have identified the Collateral Network (COLT) as the next big thing in crypto, with a 3500% growth prediction. Interested investors can join the ongoing presale to buy the Collateral Network (COLT) token at a discounted price.\n\nIf you wish to purchase the $COLT token for only $0.014, follow the links below and take advantage of this unique opportunity to earn an extra 40% purchase bonus on your investment!\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://app.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Dash (DASH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) & Sparklo (SPRK) - Which One Is A Better Buy? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency investing, staying ahead of the game can mean the difference between making a fortune and missing out on the next big thing.\n\nToday, numerous cryptocurrencies are vying for investors\u2019 attention, but among the top contenders are Dash (DASH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Sparklo (SPRK). Knowing where to place your bets can be challenging with so many options.\n\nHowever, after careful analysis, experts agree that Sparklo (SPRK) is the clear winner regarding potential return on investment. With potential growth up to 4,000 times, it\u2019s no wonder investors are flocking to Sparklo.\n\nSparklo Presale Momentum On The Rise As Bulls Take Control\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to be intrigued by Sparklo (SPRK)\u2019s incredible momentum. Though still in its presale, demand for this cryptocurrency is going through the roof. And it\u2019s easy to see why. On May 4th, the price of Sparklo (SPRK) increased by two cents with a current price of $0.019.\n\nThat\u2019s a significant jump! No wonder investors are rushing in before the second stage of the Sparklo (SPRK) presale. But what\u2019s so special about Sparklo (SPRK)? Well, its use case is simply fascinating.\n\nThrough its clever fractionalization of ownership, Sparklo (SPRK) lets you own a piece of valuable metals like gold, platinum, and silver. And transparency? Sparklo (SPRK) has that in spades.\n\nWith Sparklo\u2019s (SPRK) smart contract being audited by InterFi and locked in a 100-year liquidity lock, you can trust Sparklo\u2019s (SPRK) transparency practices. If Sparklo (SPRK)\u2019s momentum keeps up, some analysts predict it could do 4,000x.\n\nThat\u2019s something worth watching and perfect to include in a portfolio that includes both Dash (DASH) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\n\n>>>> BUY SPARKLO TOKENS <<<\n\nDash Coin (DASH) Bearish As Investors Seek Better Returns Elsewhere\n\nDash (DASH) has been making waves in the crypto world due to its impressive use cases and widespread adoption. Its ability to facilitate private transactions at low fees has made it a highly sought-after crypto for everyday use.\n\nAdopted heavily in South America, Dash (DASH) has a strong foundation that has allowed it to remain in the upper echelon of cryptos. However, with its market cap already being substantial, analysts predict it may underperform the market.\n\nAs new crypto options emerge, analysts are looking towards up-and-coming options like Sparklo (SPRK) to outperform Dash (DASH) soon.\n\nNevertheless, Dash (DASH) remains a powerhouse in the world of cryptocurrencies, with its many benefits making it a top choice for crypto enthusiasts. Dash (DASH) adoption rate means it will remain one of the safest cryptos.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) Growth Prospects As An Investment Weak\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is one of the most used cryptos today for business transactions. Many retailers and businesses that accept crypto do accept Bitcoin Cash (BCH). This gives Bitcoin Cash (BCH) an edge over many other cryptos.\n\nThat being said, analysts are not bullish on Bitcoin Cash (BCH), giving investors a return that they can\u2019t get from any other crypto.\n\nOn the bright side, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) can diversify. While Bitcoin Cash (BCH)\u2019s large market cap suggests a limited potential for exponential growth, plenty of smaller cryptocurrencies \u2013 like Sparklo (SPRK) \u2013 offer an opportunity for significant gains.\n\nA crypto like Sparklo (SPRK) is in so high demand that some analysts expect it to do 4,000X. That\u2019s something you can\u2019t get from Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\n\nBuy Presale: https://invest.sparklo.finance\n\nWebsite: https://sparklo.finance\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sparklo_finance\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/sparklofinance\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Friday, May 5, 2023\n\nMembers of the South African Revenue Service (SARS), jointly with the South African Police Service (SAPS), on Thursday conducted a raid on an unauthorised warehouse in Vryburg, North West and confiscated millions of rands worth of illegally manufactured alcohol and bitcoin mining equipment.\n\nThe warehouse was used to illegally connect the crypto currency mining equipment to the town\u2019s electrical power supply. It was also used to manufacture 14 617 bottles of duty-free liquor and popular local brands.\n\nThe bitcoin mining equipment is valued at around R10 million while the alcohol is estimated at R3.8 million.\n\nThe warehouse was well equipped with state-of-the-art equipment to enable those involved to carry out their criminal activities. One foreign national was arrested. An investigation is underway and more arrests are expected.\n\nSARS Commissioner, Edward Kieswetter, praised the ongoing cooperation between SARS and SAPS in apprehending those who are bent on perpetrating criminality.\n\nHe said the raid formed part of SARS\u2019 decision to act more vigilantly against unregistered taxpayers conducting business and to protect legitimate businesses.\n\n\u201cThe abuse of duty-free labels to circumvent payable duties and other criminal undertakings found at this warehouse undermines our economy and will be confronted and met with the full might of the law,\u201d Kieswetter said. - SAnews.gov.za"

        "title": "Relationship Between Bitcoin NFTs and Mining - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "These days, the fashion for NFTs on the Ordinals protocol and fungible BRC-20 tokens is exploding, and together they are boosting Bitcoin mining activity and making the business more profitable.\n\nWhat does this mean for the Bitcoin network and what are the advantages/disadvantages for the end-user?\n\nLet us analyse the situation in detail.\n\nWhat are Ordinal NFTs and why could they boost bitcoin mining?\n\nThe Taproot update to the Bitcoin protocol, which went live in November 2021, was a complete game-changer for Satoshi Nakamoto\u2018s network, increasing transaction privacy for users and improving scalability and security.\n\nProgress has been made since this implementation two years ago, thanks in part to the introduction of Ordinals, a protocol that allows NFTs and native tokens to be issued directly on the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nAlthough these functionalities are generally feasible through the use of smart contracts, as is the case on the Ethereum network, in this case the conditions are very different.\n\nThe basic idea behind Ordinals, a protocol devised by Casey Rodarmor, the developer of Bitcoin Core, is to allow data such as images, videos and text to be \u2018\u2019inscribed\u2019\u2019 on individual satoshi, making each sat to which this information is added \u2018unique\u2019.\n\nIn this way, the problem of the lack of smart contracts on the Bitcoin network was overcome, prompting many users to create NFT-style digital artefacts and fungible tokens.\n\nThe result was astonishing: millions of pieces of data were transcribed into individual minimum units of BTC (the satoshi), increasing the fees paid to use Bitcoin\u2019s infrastructure and increasing the average block size published on the chain.\n\nMiners are grateful to Casey Rodarmor, as the percentage of income from transaction fees now represents around 12% of the total income earned by those in this business: this is 8 times more than on 23 April, the day the Ordinals trend broke out.\n\nLet us remember that bitcoin mining earns money in two ways: firstly, from block rewards, which are fixed but vary according to predefined mechanisms such as halving or difficulty adjustment, and secondly, from the fees paid by users to have priority in the execution of transactions and to include additional data on each block generated.\n\nWe do not know if the ordinals craze is a passing fad or if the crypto community will continue to modify satoshi by adding data of any kind.\n\nHowever, if this trend continues, it would create a huge incentive for miners to continue their activities and ensure the security of the network by increasing the overall hashrate of the blockchain.\n\nChart showing the percentage of miners\u2019 income from royalties\n\nA look at bitcoin mining revenues: is the advent of NFTs and BRC-20 tokens really a game changer?\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the mining side effects of the advent of Ordinals and the fungible BRC-20 NFTs and tokens that have been created on the Bitcoin blockchain so far.\n\nThe increase in average transaction fees has been a fortuitous event for miners, who need support now more than ever, given the threat of new threats from the US.\n\nTim Frost, CEO of Yield App, said that bitcoin miners could be taxed by the US government because of the energy impact and CO2 emissions generated by the hardware used in the activity.\n\n\u201cBitcoin miners are facing new threats in the US in the form of a new White House proposal to tax the equivalent of 30% of their energy costs to cover the \u201cdamage they inflict on society\u201d.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, with bitcoin\u2019s next halving expected on 27 April 2024 (or rather at the peak of the 840,000 block), miners will soon be earning half the coins currently mined every 10 minutes or so.\n\nThe explosion of the Ordinals trend and the increase in the Fess to enter Satoshi data, which costs around $50 per million bytes added, has been a boon to the mining industry and could greatly increase the earnings of those working in it, if only this craze continues in the coming months.\n\nConsider that since the Ordinals protocol went live, some $9 million in fees have been paid just to create NFTs and BRC-20 tokens, a truly remarkable surplus.\n\nTotale fees paid on Ordinals protocol\n\nThe sheer profitability of the companies in this business has, until recently, depended heavily on the price of bitcoin and the amount of coins issued for each block added to the chain, with transaction fees having little impact on the overall revenue of the miners.\n\nIf registrations continue at this pace, and the price of BTC does not drop significantly, we may finally see a reversal in the coming months of a trend that has seen miners\u2019 revenues remain more or less stable, in the range of 600 to 1200 coins per day.\n\nThe level to watch to see if the advent of NFTs and BRC-20 tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain really is a game changer is the 1200 BTC level: if it is broken, a new era of heavier blocks and richer miners could begin.\n\n\u200b\u200bChart of Bitcoin miners\u2019 profits in BTC\n\nFrom a user experience perspective, however, this trend could be viewed negatively: although miners are making money from this situation, users are seeing their transactions costing more and more and sometimes getting stuck in the mempool as the rest of the world competes to pay higher fees and get priority for execution.\n\nThere are currently around 220,000 transactions stuck in the mempool, waiting to be added to a block and executed once and for all.\n\nWho knows if in the future some other digital artefact will manage to solve this problem, using the philosophy of zkrollups and the scalability achievable with off-chain transaction processing.\n\nFor now, users are really angry at Ordinals and those who speculate on this trend.\n\nBitcoin Mempool Parameters\n\nHow is the price of bitcoin reacting to the Ordinals trend: buying opportunities?\n\nBitcoin does not seem to have reacted particularly well to the explosion in the Ordinals NFT trend and the increase in mining profitability.\n\nThe cryptocurrency is currently trading at around $29,000 on the chart, with a market cap of $563 billion and volume of $16.7 billion over the last 24 hours.\n\nThe bullish price phase started well before the NFT and BRC-20 token craze broke out, in early January 2023, and in recent days we have seen small price gains.\n\nThe result is quite obvious when we consider that only one satoshi, or one hundred millionth of a BITcoin, is used for each token, so the markets are not deprived of large quantities of coins.\n\nThe positive effects on the price could be seen in the future, thanks to the increase in requests to use the network and, more generally, thanks to the increase in the usefulness of the infrastructure.\n\nIndeed, if the blockchain becomes more like Ethereum, as a \u201cglobal computer for the world\u201d, bitcoin will certainly start to benefit from the increased functionality that exists.\n\nFor now, speculative activity is focused elsewhere, mainly on the new BRC-20 fungible tokens, whose market capitalization has exceeded $125 million.\n\nThe buying opportunity here could be in this niche market or, in a more traditional financial view, in the shares of listed companies involved in industrial mining."
