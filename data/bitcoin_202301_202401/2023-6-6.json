        "content": "Cryptocurrency prices rose Tuesday after the Securities and Exchange Commission sued crypto services provider Coinbase.\n\nBitcoin climbed 6.3% to $27,155.16, according to Coin Metrics, recovering its losses from the previous day after the SEC sued Binance. Earlier, it fell as low as $25,368.57, its lowest level since March. Ether gained nearly 5% to trade at $1,896.19.\n\nOn Tuesday, the SEC filed a lawsuit in New York federal court alleging that Coinbase has been acting as an unregistered broker and exchange. The agency demanded that the company be \"permanently restrained and enjoined\" from continuing to do so.\n\n\"If there's a real value in these crypto tokens then compliance will build trust and the business model might change,\" SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in an interview Tuesday with CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\" \"What we're doing at the SEC is pro-innovation because the capital markets really don't work.\"\n\n\"There's a lot of work here for the crypto field but we stand ready to work to get them into compliance,\" he added."

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission is suing Coinbase (COIN) and Binance because it believes many cryptocurrencies traded on those exchanges are securities that should be registered with the US regulator.\n\nThere is one big exception: bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThe SEC has been extremely clear. Bitcoin is not a security,\u201d Steven Lubka, managing director of Swan Bitcoin, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe\u2019re very, very confident that never changes.\u201d\n\nThat belief is encouraging investors to stick with the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency despite the industry turmoil triggered by new SEC lawsuits against the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world and the US.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) was up 5% Wednesday at 9:30 am New York time to $26,759, before settling back to $26,400 by noon. Its market share, a ratio of the coin's market capitalization over the total crypto market capitalization, rose 0.85% over the same period, suggesting crypto investors are seeking it out as a safe bet within the market.\n\nBitcoin is up 58% year to date, while still down by roughly the same amount from its November 2021 peak of $68,790.\n\nSome bitcoin proponents expressed their optimism on social media, suggesting their favorite digital asset could benefit amid the legal battles.\n\nCory Klippsten, an outspoken critic of the larger crypto ecosystem and CEO of bitcoin financial services firm Swan Bitcoin, tweeted a graphic of bitcoin\u2019s recovery this week and added a sarcastic: \u201cOh noes! Whatever is bitcoin going to do???!\u201d\n\nOh noes! The sh*tcoin casinos I mean \"tool manufacturers\" are f***ed whatever is Bitcoin going to do???!\n\n\n\nTick tock, next block. pic.twitter.com/uqnBs6ePfv \u2014 Cory Klippsten \ud83d\udd90\ufe0f Swan.com \ud83e\udda2 #Bitcoin (@coryklippsten) June 7, 2023\n\nPierre Rochard of bitcoin miner Riot Platforms (RIOT) tweeted that Coinbase should \"pivot back to being focused on #Bitcoin.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nTwitter co-founder Jack Dorsey then attached the Rochard comment to his Twitter feed and added a hundred points emoji.\n\nCoinbase does rely on bitcoin for roughly one-third of its trading volume and transaction revenue.\n\nThe Howey test\n\nThe SEC's framework for evaluating digital assets as securities relies on the so-called Howey Test. It can be linked back to a 1946 Supreme Court case dealing with tracts of Florida orange groves sold by W.J. Howey Co. and leased back to the company.\n\nThe Supreme Court labeled these leaseback deals as investment contracts, meaning they needed to be registered with the SEC.\n\nIt also defined what constitutes a security: \"an investment of money in a common enterprise with profits to come solely from the efforts of others.\"\n\nBitcoin, its defenders say, doesn't meet that test. It wasn't created, they say, by entrepreneurs seeking profits via pre-listed private sales to larger institutional investors \u2014 as other digital coins have.\n\nIt was instead created by anonymous software developer Satoshi Nakamoto in January 2009 as an open-source concept.\n\n\"Satoshi never raised a single dollar and because he never raised a single dollar, there were no expectations of future profits in an investment contract,\" Lubka said.\n\nWhile there is no law declaring whether or not bitcoin is a security, SEC Chair Gary Gensler as well as former Chair Jay Clayton have indicated in numerous public comments they do not believe bitcoin is a security. Instead, most investors understand it to be a commodity such as gold or wheat.\n\n\"I\u2019m extremely confident that Bitcoin is going to remain a commodity and will not be labeled a security,\" Grant McCarty, co-executive director of advocacy group Bitcoin Policy Institute, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nAbsolutely hilarious seeing all the shitcoiners and \u201cventure capitalists\u201d trying to crawl their way back to #Bitcoin. \u2014 Magoo PhD (@HodlMagoo) June 6, 2023\n\nThe SEC listed 19 different crypto tokens in its lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance that it considers securities, accounting for roughly 11% of crypto's total market capitalization. Those coins fell Wednesday.\n\nBNB (BNB-USD) was down 7.5%, Cardano's ADA (ADA-USD) was down 7%, Polygon's MATIC (MATIC-USD) token was down 4.8% while Solana's SOL token was down 4.2%.\n\nAfter falling 12% Tuesday, Coinbase's stock rose 2.8% at Wednesday's open.\n\nCustomers withdrew $105 million from Coinbase in the 24 hours after it was sued by the SEC, after losing $1.3 billion in the previous 24 hours, according to crypto data provider Nansen.\n\nBinance customers pulled $492 million and $1.4 billion in the two previous 24-hour periods.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "content": "The prices of Bitcoin, Ether, and other top cryptocurrencies dropped marginally just after the Securities and Exchange Commission sued U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase\u2014just one day after the agency filed another blockbuster lawsuit against Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nBitcoin was immediately down about 1%, Ether 0.7%, and BNB, Binance\u2019s digital currency, dipped to a low of 1%. Bitcoin began the day at $25,700 and dropped to a low of $25,400. The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies sagged about 0.7%.\n\nIn the lawsuit against Coinbase, the SEC specifically detailed \u201ca non-exhaustive list\u201d of 13 cryptocurrencies that it argued were securities, including pages of details outlining these tokens\u2019 releases. The most prominent include Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC). After the SEC\u2019s lawsuit became public, SOL was down approximately 2%, ADA 0.6%, and MATIC 2.6%.\n\n\u201cFrom the time of their first offer or sale, each of these Crypto Asset Securities was\n\noffered and sold, and continues to be offered and sold today, as an investment contract and thus a\n\nsecurity,\u201d wrote the SEC.\n\nThe depression in the market mirrors the price action seen on Monday, when the SEC sued Binance, as both cryptocurrencies and the share prices of publicly traded crypto companies, including Coinbase, took a hit.\n\nIn its suit against the U.S. crypto exchange, the SEC alleges Coinbase was operating as a broker, national securities exchange, and clearing agency without registering with the agency.\n\n\u201cYou simply can\u2019t ignore the rules because you don\u2019t like them or because you\u2019d prefer different ones: The consequences for the investing public are far too great,\u201d Gurbir S. Grewal, director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s reliance on an enforcement-only approach in the absence of clear rules for the digital asset industry is hurting America\u2019s economic competitiveness and companies like Coinbase that have a demonstrated commitment to compliance,\u201d said Paul Grewal, Coinbase\u2019s chief legal officer, in a statement shared with Fortune."

        "content": "Swan Bitcoin appears to have been struggling as the company has moved to transfer all of its assets to two new custodians \u2014 even as its CEO harshly criticized other crypto exchanges in the wake of the SEC\u2019s lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase this week.\n\nUsers of the bitcoin-only trading platform this week have reported significant outages that they say have prevented them from moving assets with ease. Fiat on- and off-ramp services were affected.\n\nThe company said in a statement posted on its website Wednesday that \u201call funds are being transferred\u201d to its qualified custodians, Fortress Trust and BitGo Trust Company. CEO Cory Klippsten confirmed this in an email to Blockworks in which he also noted that the company was migrating from Prime Trust and Fireblocks.\n\nThe US-based company\u2019s site also listed a number of service outages dating back to May 26.\n\nWhether the root cause of Swan\u2019s problems \u2014 which appear to span multiple weeks \u2014 could be attributed entirely to the custodian switch was not immediately clear.\n\nThe company told customers that the transfer of their assets to Fortress and BitGo commenced on May 26, coinciding with the outages. Swan said that the company \u201ccarefully weighed the pros and cons\u201d of moving all assets in one swoop, adding that it had reached a consensus that \u201cmoving at once will create the least amount of disruption for Swan clients.\u201d\n\nSwan\u2019s website on Wednesday separately said its \u201cbitcoin purchasing\u201d and \u201cACH Pull\u201d services were both \u201cunder maintenance.\u201d\n\n\u201cCommunication with clients has been constant and detailed,\u201d Klippsten told Blockworks Wednesday. He added that withdrawals of BTC and USD were available throughout the custodian migration via client service channels. The ability for users to withdraw via the website or app directly resumed Tuesday.\n\n\u2018Degraded performance\u2019 across business lines\n\nAt the same time, Swan\u2019s wire transfers, as well as its custody and trading business lines, were both operating under \u201cdegraded performance.\u201d The company on its website listed a \u201cmajor platform upgrade\u201d as being under way each day since May 30.\n\nSwan attributed its custodial switch to plans the company put in place in January. At the time, Klippsten wrote that his company had 100 full-time employees, or \u201cSwans,\u201d divided across five continents and cited its \u201crapid expansion into new products and markets.\u201d\n\nFrom its roots at a bitcoin (BTC) exchange, Klippsten\u2019s Swan has over the years rolled out a number of new bitcoin-only products.\n\nThose include support for both retail and institutional investors, including an advisory service designed to cater to registered investment advisers (RIAs). Swan has also played up its BTC-based retirement account services, as well as bitcoin maximalist job boards.\n\nBut Swan\u2019s Twitter account, as well as that of Klippsten, has been active this week reacting to the SEC\u2019s allegations against Binance and Coinbase for alleged securities violations and other charges.\n\nThe exchanges have denied wrongdoing.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThe company hosted a Twitter Space about the lawsuits \u2014 which included \u201c#Bitcoin Not Crypto\u201d in the title.\n\nKlippsten called the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Coinbase an outcome that was \u201cobvious, inevitable and entirely self-inflicted\u201d in a Wednesday Twitter thread, calling out Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Balaji Srinivasan, a former chief technology officer at the exchange.\n\nCoinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal said Tuesday that the SEC\u2019s actions amid the lack of US crypto regulations harms companies like Coinbase \u201cthat have a demonstrated commitment to compliance.\u201d\n\nCustodial migration \u201cnot 100% complete\u201d\n\nSome Swan users appeared confused as to the status of their services, Swan on its website site said it had put in place a number of measures to update customers on the status of their assets.\n\nThat included a new \u201csnapshot\u201d feature designed to provide a placeholder update of customer balances \u201cat the time of migration.\u201d The custodial switch was still not \u201c100% complete\u201d through 5 pm ET on Wednesday.\n\nCustomers could not, however, view the balance of their dollar holdings during the move. Swan told customers that the migration ought to be complete by June 11 \u2014 it started on May 26.\n\nOn Wednesday, \u201cself-service Bitcoin withdrawals\u201d remained unaffected by the outages, while \u201cinstant buys,\u201d as well as \u201cautomated savings plans\u201d and \u201cautomated withdrawals\u201d were not operational.\n\nKlippsten said he expected \u201cbuys\u201d to be available on Wednesday night or Thursday, adding that new user sign ups could resume by the weekend.\n\nSwan capped off its post by saying that the company would re-open in Texas in a \u201cplan to return by July or August.\u201d And the firm told customers that it\u2019s \u201cworking on bringing Swan services to New York\u201d within three to six months.\n\n\u201cStay tuned for an email announcement!\u201d Swan said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

On Tuesday, the Bitcoin-backed and A.I.-powered life insurer Meanwhile announced that it had raised $19 million to help deceased Bitcoiners pay out surviving loved ones in crypto.\n\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, and Lachy Groom, one of the original employees at payments giant Stripe, co-led the first round of seed funding. Gradient Ventures, a Google-backed venture capital fund, led a second round. Other participants were Mouro Capital, MS&AD, and Hudson Structured Capital Management.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile is sitting at the confluence of the A.I. and digital assets transformation,\u201d Anna Patterson, managing partner at Gradient Ventures, said in a statement. \u201cThe team has an opportunity to change how consumers use digital money and set a new standard for tech-enabled life insurance providers.\u201d\n\nThe capital raise, which values Meanwhile at $100 million, according to cofounder and CEO Zac Townsend, is just one of Sam Altman\u2019s recent investments at the intersection of crypto and artificial intelligence.

        "title": "IU researchers using Carbonate supercomputer to unveil the mysteries of cryptocurrency trading - IU Newsroom",
        "content": "The introduction of cryptocurrency to the marketplace in 2009 raised many questions for financial analysts, ranging from \u201cWhat is it?\u201d to \u201cHow will it affect the marketplace?\u201d When Bitcoin first became available to buy, sell, and trade on online exchanges the following year, nobody really knew what it would do to asset prices, like housing and stocks, or how to project what it might do in the future. Such projections help inform major decisions in both the micro and macro economies, from whether to buy a home or when to take a company public on the stock market.\n\nWhile crypto has been studied in the years since, analysts relied on observable factors, such as market value and past returns. IU researchers are taking it a step further, using data from the actual blockchain, which is essentially a secure and decentralized ledger of cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nPreetesh Kantak, assistant professor of finance, IU Kelley School of Business\u201cWe actually have the trading data for what we call off-chain activity, which is the trading that\u2019s happening on the exchanges,\u201d said Preetesh Kantak, an assistant professor of finance at the Kelley School of Business. \u201cWe want to see the interaction of the trading activity that\u2019s taking place on these exchanges and compare and contrast their impact on Bitcoin prices with actual blockchain activity.\u201d\n\nPeople trade Bitcoin using various exchanges, like Coinbase. Most people using exchanges are regular people and not large institutional investors, Kantak said. The ultimate holder of the Bitcoin on the blockchain is the exchange, and those exchanges have accounts, or wallets, on the blockchain that are holding coins for all those using the exchange to trade cryptocurrency.\n\nKantak said that preliminary findings from other studies using less precise data and observations seem to indicate that off-chain, or exchange, activity experiences a great deal of mean reversion, meaning price volatility and historical returns eventually revert to their long-term average levels. This is usually indicative of the exchanges managing their inventory risk, he said. By contrast, on-chain activity shows momentum, meaning Bitcoin prices typically go up.\n\nKantak and Xioran Cheng, a former Kelley student who first brought up the project idea as an independent study proposal, needed to be able to segment the activity on the blockchain into its various players to determine who is actually holding these coins. These entities could include an exchange, a mutual fund, or a large holder. By tracking on the blockchain how and when Bitcoin is traded, Cheng and Kantak can then see what these factors might mean for future asset prices. To do this, they needed to use Carbonate, IU\u2019s large-memory computer cluster that was designed to support data-intensive computing.\n\nIU Kelley School of Business student, Xioran Cheng\u201cThe process of downloading and uncompressing these massive files, then opening them, cleaning them up, and segmenting the data is a massive undertaking. The only way to do it is with a supercomputer.\u201d - Xioran Cheng\n\n\u201cThis is every transaction of Bitcoin going back to when Bitcoin started, so it\u2019s a huge amount of data, and it\u2019s all compressed in these files called BLK files,\u201d Kantak said. The BLK files contain numerous complications when it comes to extracting clean data, he said. For example, spoofing, which is when cybersecurity criminals pretend to be someone else for nefarious purposes, muddies the data. Also, a single user or organization can have multiple wallets, and they must look at how transactions are taking place between wallets and amalgamate them to attribute them to a single user. This will allow them to study the transactions and how such transactions affect asset prices going forward.\n\nThe process of downloading and uncompressing these massive files, then opening them, cleaning them up, and segmenting the data is a massive undertaking. The only way to do it is with a supercomputer, Cheng said.\n\nApart from the work of verifying or contradicting the outcomes of earlier studies, which they hope to finish by this summer, Kantak and Cheng are excited to see what else the exchange and blockchain data can tell them.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more we\u2019d like to do between on chain and off chain,\u201d Kantak said. \u201cBut first we need to go through this segmentation process so that we know who is initiating what trading activity. Without Carbonate, we couldn\u2019t do this.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin Is Less Than a Year Away From a Much-Hyped Event That Has Historically Seen Its Price Soar - Nasdaq",
        "content": "***Money is not a client of any investment adviser featured on this page. The information provided on this page is for educational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice. Money does not offer advisory services.***\n\nThe crypto market has been laying somewhat low in 2023 compared to its massive price swings that made constant headlines in recent years.\n\nBut we\u2019re now less than a year out from an event that has historically seen bitcoin\u2019s price rise during the lead-up and aftermath: bitcoin halving, which happens once every four years.\n\nThe regular event limits the amount of new bitcoins that come to the market. Because of the historical gains around bitcoin halving, some investors are hoping that the next halving, expected in April or May of 2024, could spur the start of a crypto bull run (a period of prices going up). That would be welcome news for investors, given thatbitcoin prices\u2014 along with those of other financial assets, like stock prices \u2014 have taken a hit in the last year amid interest rates hikes and recession fears.\n\nBut can we actually expect a price boost as we head towards the next halving? Here\u2019s what crypto investors should know.\n\nWhat is bitcoin halving?\n\nBitcoin halving has everything to do with bitcoin miners, who are involved in the process of creating new bitcoins. That includes everyone from individual hobbyists to corporate enterprises, with anywhere from one to thousands of specialized computers. These computers work constantly at the singular task of solving mathematical problems for the bitcoin network. If a computer solves a problem, it is rewarded with the bitcoin that is minted as a result of its work.\n\nBitcoin halving causes the total reward that miners receive for their work to be slashed in half. Miners currently earn 6.25 bitcoin for solving a problem, but they will begin to receive only 3.125 bitcoin for their efforts after the halving. From its very inception, bitcoin\u2019s creator only ever intended for the supply to reach 21 million coins \u2014 and the goal of the bitcoin halving is to decrease the supply of new bitcoin overtime.\n\nMuch of the rhetoric around halving as a cause for a crypto rally has to do with this tightening of rewards. Many investors see the event as increasing scarcity of bitcoin and say it will inflate the coin\u2019s value because of supply and demand economics.\n\nBitcoin halving has historically come with price gains\n\nSo far, there has been a bitcoin halving in 2012, 2016 and 2020 \u2014 and each one has seen the price of bitcoin rise in the months before and after the event.\n\nFollowing the 2016 halving, for instance, bitcoin\u2019s price jumped to a record of nearly $20,000 per coin in 2017. In the year leading up to the May 2020 halving, bitcoin\u2019s price rose around 20%. Between the halving and the end of the year, bitcoin\u2019s price gained more than 200%.\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of how bitcoin\u2019s price will do in the future, but there\u2019s already chatter about the halving\u2019s potential as fuel for a new price run.\n\nWill there be a crypto bull run?\n\nSome crypto experts are challenging the notion that the bitcoin halving is going to bring on a prolonged bull market. Crypto is still relatively new, so nothing should be taken as a certainty, says Omid Malekan, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School. He adds that when it comes to the bitcoin network, nothing changes for anybody during a halving except for miners: There\u2019s a misconception that the halving reduces the overall supply of bitcoin, but it really just reduces the amount of new bitcoin coming on the market, Malekan says. The plan is that there will still ultimately be 21 million coins, as was always intended. Plus, the halving is no surprise.\n\n\u201cYou would think [halving events] would be priced in long before the actual event and not have any material impact,\u201d Malekan says.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of back and forth about whether or not the halving is baked into bitcoin\u2019s price, and whether the fact that bitcoins are scarce make them more valuable. Morningstar senior research analyst Madeline Hume\u2019s recent analysis of bitcoin scarcity indicates that the argument that increasing the scarcity of new bitcoin pushes up its value is reductive. Hume notes that bitcoin looks on charts like its pricing operates in four-year cycles, which seems to indicate a correlation between scarcity and price increases. But she also notes that, excluding the \u201choneymoon periods\u201d that followed previous halvings, the relationship between the production of new bitcoin and prices is more or less negligible.\n\n\u201c[It could] be pure coincidence that bitcoin\u2019s halving cycles arrived just as narratives around crypto reached their frothy peaks, and the relationship is totally spurious,\u201d Hume says. She goes on to also say that a major flaw in these scarcity-based analyses is that they all predict bitcoin\u2019s price will keep going up, which is impossible to know.\n\nCould the bitcoin halving cause prices to drop?\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the bitcoin halving could actually cause the cryptocurrency\u2019s price to go down, Malekan says. The slashing of miners\u2019 rewards will make the practice less profitable and miners who are already struggling could be forced to shut down when their potential profits are cut in half, Malekan says. This could hurt the network\u2019s security since there would be fewer people monitoring activity.\n\n\u201cA lot of miners are suffering during this bear market and unless prices recover or fees go substantially higher, some will be forced to shut down once the block reward falls,\u201d Malekan says.\n\nIf there are gains, don\u2019t expect them to be long-lived\n\nHanna Halaburda, an associate professor at NYU Stern School of Business, says that post-halving gains are nothing more than hype, and that while prices may go up in the near-term, investors shouldn\u2019t expect a long-lasting bull market thanks to the halving alone.\n\n\u201cThe only real explanation for why the price goes up is that we start talking about bitcoin more,\u201d Halaburda says.\n\nThe halving, like many happenings in the world of crypto, gets a lot of social media chatter in its lead-up. Halaburda points to studies that say there is a relationship between social media posting and crypto price fluctuations. (Nowadays, a tweet from Elon Musk can send dogecoin\u2019s price soaring.) She adds that newer investors learning about the coin\u2019s limited new supply could help along a short-lived speculative rally, since they may have not been aware of the halving before.\n\nHalaburda also says investors need to keep in mind that the halving won\u2019t do anything to improve the use cases for bitcoin, which is ultimately what matters most for ensuring the longevity of the network.\n\nMore from Money:\n\n\u2018Free\u2019 Games Like Candy Crush and Counter-Strike Are Wrecking People\u2019s Finances\n\nCrypto Graveyard: Thousands of Coins Listed in Recent Years Have Already Failed\n\nStock Ownership Is at Its Highest Level Since 2008\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2023 Money Group, LLC.

        "title": "Economics of Bitcoin ATM market could hinder wider adoption - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "As the digital asset market continues to evolve, the use of cryptocurrency ATMs grows with it. Over the past decade, nearly 40,000 cryptocurrency ATMs have popped up worldwide.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) ATM service provider, Bitcoin of America, had carved out a slice of the market but recently closed shop in the United States State of Connecticut due to a lack of proper licensing.\n\nThe Connecticut Department of Banking (DoB) issued a cease and desist order against the company, accusing it of operating unlicensed crypto ATMs in the state. But the allegations didn\u2019t stop there; the firm was also accused of facilitating scams by allowing transactions related to fraudulent activities.\n\nIn response to the challenges, Bitcoin of America released a statement claiming it would immediately halt all of its operations in Connecticut. While the decision marked the end of the company\u2019s presence in the state, it also underscored the regulatory hurdles faced by crypto ATM operators, particularly in the United States.\n\nThe closure also sent ripples across the crypto community, leading many industry observers to question the long-term efficacy and utility of these machines.\n\nConnecticut closure explained\n\nDue to the nascency of the cryptocurrency industry, marrying digital currencies with conventional financial structures \u2014 as in the case of crypto ATMs \u2014 requires intricate regulatory supervision. This is particularly true in Connecticut, where the DoB oversees ATMs under the Money Transmission Act.\n\nThe act requires that any service involving the transfer of money, including the conversion of traditional currency to cryptocurrency, must secure a money transmitter license.\n\nOn May 22, the Connecticut DoB claimed that Bitcoin of America had not secured the necessary license to operate Bitcoin ATMs in the state. It further stated that four Connecticut Bitcoin ATM users were scammed out of tens of thousands of dollars via Bitcoin of America\u2019s kiosks.\n\nRecent: Grinding out a living: Can blockchain games really offer a sustainable income?\n\nThe DoB stated: \u201cBitcoin of America, following the consent order, compensated these consumers with a total of $86,000. After facing criminal charges, Bitcoin of America is in the process of ceasing its operations in Connecticut.\u201d\n\nIn a separate incident in March, state officials in Ohio seized 52 Bitcoin of America ATMs, as authorities suspected scammers were using the kiosks.\n\nOperating crypto ATMs is harder than it looks\n\nJason Grewal, chief legal officer for Web3 security firm Sys Labs, told Cointelegraph that running a crypto ATM involves much more than just acquiring a license.\n\nOperators in the U.S. must adhere to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules set by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, comply with the Bank Secrecy Act\u2019s Know Your Customer (KYC) norms, and conform to the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s requirements for reporting crypto transactions.\n\nIn Grewal\u2019s opinion, such complexities could play a significant role in the waning popularity of these machines. In March alone, a staggering 3,627 cryptocurrency ATMs went offline, marking the most significant monthly decrease in the history of crypto ATMs. He said:\n\n\u201cConsidering the shifting popularity of crypto ATMs, various factors seem to be at play. For one, the transaction fees imposed by these machines often exceed those on online exchanges, posing a deterrent for heavy users. Additionally, the necessity to satisfy complex regulations and licensing requirements can be challenging and potentially overshadow the perceived advantages of in-person crypto transactions.\u201d\n\nFurther tipping the scales away from crypto ATMs are alternatives like decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.\n\nLower transaction costs, universal access, superior privacy and a broader range of supported cryptocurrencies make these projects increasingly compelling to many people. DeFi platforms also offer features such as staking, yield farming and borrowing \u2014 services typically absent from crypto ATMs.\n\nGrewal believes that moving forward, crypto ATM operators will have to innovate and change to better serve the evolving needs of their consumers.\n\nRobert Quartly-Janeiro, chief strategy officer for cryptocurrency exchange Bitrue, told Cointelegraph that four primary companies currently dominate the crypto ATM market, something which needs to change for the market to grow and adoption to increase.\n\nMoreover, he believes that the physical location of crypto ATMs is also a major factor when it comes to engaging customers. He added:\n\n\u201cUltimately, one of the key pillars for the mass adoption of crypto remains the ability to sell crypto for fiat currencies in-country. The landscape has changed slightly, so the need for crypto ATMs has changed economically, geographically, psychologically, as well as from an infrastructural standpoint.\u201d\n\nThe economics of crypto ATMs\n\nMost crypto ATMs in operation today run in collaboration with established companies like ChainBytes, LibertyX, CoinMe and others, which allow independent businesses to become \u201coperators,\u201d \u201cpartners,\u201d or \u201chosts\u201d for these machines.\n\nThe return on investment depends on several factors, including the location of the business (e.g., commercial district, high-traffic area); the number of daily transactions; the average transaction size; the total expected revenue from transaction fees; and the marketing strategy to promote the crypto ATM in question.\n\nAccording to crypto ATM firm Chainbytes, a single Bitcoin ATM can earn up to $3,000 monthly, with gross monthly revenues of $30,000.\n\nOperating a crypto ATM presents several challenges as well. Regulatory complexities require operators to navigate often unclear laws, obtain necessary licenses, and comply with AML and KYC regulations. Security risks, both physical and digital, necessitate robust protective measures, adding to high operational costs that include machine maintenance and cash management.\n\nThe inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies can also impact profitability, with significant value fluctuations potentially leading to financial losses. Operators must also maintain sufficient cryptocurrency and cash reserves to meet customer demand, as shortages could harm their reputation and business.\n\nWho\u2019s leading the global crypto ATM race?\n\nSince the first crypto ATM debuted in a Vancouver coffee shop in 2013, the sector has evolved dramatically. Today, there are around 35,000 machines globally, transforming how people interact with digital currencies.\n\nThe United States has the lion\u2019s share of crypto ATMs globally. Source: Coin ATM Radar\n\nThe U.S. houses roughly 30,000 crypto ATMs, accounting for 86% of all such machines worldwide.\n\nCanada\u2019s crypto ATM scene has also flourished over the last few years. As of Q1 2023, the country hosts 2,744 machines, while its European compatriot Spain boasts around 286 machines.\n\nDown under, Australia has also been making waves. After adding 99 ATMs in late 2022, it leapfrogged El Salvador and Poland to become the fourth-largest crypto ATM hub with around 473 kiosks.\n\nThe future of crypto ATMs\n\nDespite the many hurdles impeding the growth of the crypto ATM market, the space is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. The market \u2014 valued at $71.9 million in 2021 \u2014 is projected to rise to $5.45 billion by 2030.\n\nRecent: Tornado Cash 2.0: The race to build safe and legal coin mixers\n\nHowever, for the sector to thrive, it will be crucial for operating companies to obtain regulatory clarity. Physical and digital security measures must also be enhanced to protect the machines and the transactions they facilitate. This includes robust cybersecurity measures to prevent digital hacks and adequate physical security to deter theft attempts.\n\nFinally, efforts must be made to reduce the operational costs of running these machines. This could involve developing more cost-effective kiosks, optimizing cash management processes and exploring alternative business models. Thus, as we head into a future driven by crypto-enabled tech, it will be interesting to see how the future of the crypto ATM market continues to evolve and grow."

Ether strengthened 3.23%.\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s crackdown on Coinbase signals a shift towards greater regulation of the cryptocurrency industry. This move could have significant implications for the future of cryptocurrency, as it may lead to increased scrutiny and oversight of digital assets,\u201d Kadan Stadelmann, chief technical officer of blockchain infrastructure development firm Komodo, told Forkast in a statement.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that regulatory compliance will become increasingly important for cryptocurrency businesses moving forward, as they seek to navigate an evolving landscape of laws and regulations.\u201d\n\nDogecoin was the day\u2019s biggest gainer, up 4.4% to US$0.06947, followed by Bitcoin.

Gemini, a rival firm based in New York, is seeking a license in the United Arab Emirates.

They are expanding into new markets and weighing the possibility of leaving the country entirely.\n\nThe moves are a response to a growing law enforcement crackdown that has made the United States one of the strictest regulators of crypto in the world. On Tuesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a long-anticipated lawsuit against Coinbase, arguing that the exchange was marketing securities without the proper registration. A day earlier, the S.E.C. sued the international crypto exchange Binance, seeking to bar its founder from the U.S. securities market."

        "content": "Sharing in Climate Chaos: Asset Managers and Banks\u2019 Investment Prop up Climate-Polluting Bitcoin Mining Companies\n\nAsset managers like Fidelity Investments, BlackRock, and Vanguard, and banks like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, and Citigroup, have substantial shares in Bitcoin mining. These companies\u2019 support has thrown a lifeline to the fossil fuel industry and is impeding progress on efforts to curb emissions.\n\nFinancial institutions and the fossil fuel industry endanger our ability to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. The role of big banks and asset managers in driving the climate crisis is well documented, and campaigners have been pushing leaders in the financial services industry to align their portfolios with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway, including by divesting from the fossil fuel industry.\n\nMost of these companies claim to be taking action on climate\u2013but at the same time, they provide financial support to energy-intensive Bitcoin mining companies. Bitcoin mining is keeping coal alive\u2013 it\u2019s responsible for reopening coal plants and uses as much energy as entire countries. And asset managers like Fidelity Investments, BlackRock, and Vanguard, and banks like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and Citigroup, have substantial shares in Bitcoin mining. These companies\u2019 support has thrown a lifeline to the fossil fuel industry and is impeding progress on efforts to curb emissions.\n\nBitcoin mining is the process of verifying and recording transactions on a digital ledger. In this process, mining companies use thousands of specialized computers known as mining rigs that consume country-level amounts of electricity to guess the correct answer to a specific challenge. The first computer to guess correctly gains newly minted Bitcoins as a reward. The system adjusts as network processing power grows, making this number-guessing game more difficult. Miners compete to be the fastest, and those with the most computing power will increase their chances of gaining tokens. Miners are incentivized to keep electricity costs low to increase their profit margin.\n\nToday, miners\u2019 electricity demand rivals that of countries like Sweden. A one-megawatt mine uses more energy daily than a typical U.S. home in two years. According to research by WattTime, 85% of the energy miners use in the U.S. is from coal and natural gas plants, providing a solid lifeline to the fossil fuel economy. Globally, coal power is the number one source for energy hog Bitcoin. This fossil fuel electricity creates enormous climate pollution of nearly 66 MtCO2e per year, equal to Singapore\u2019s emissions. In the U.S. alone, meeting the power demands added by Bitcoin mining emits as much carbon pollution as 3.5 million gas-powered cars.\n\nWhile GHG emissions destroy our climate, communities living near these mining operations suffer immediately from air, water, and noise pollution. A recent New York Times investigation, The Real-World Costs of the Digital Race for Bitcoin, provides an in-depth overview of the environmental and utility ratepayer impact of Bitcoin mining companies, highlighting both the climate and local pollution.\n\nFollowing the investor money trail reveals that some of the largest U.S. asset management companies and banks have substantial shares in publicly-traded Bitcoin mining companies. As of April 2023, a Greenpeace analysis of data from the Bloomberg Terminal based on holdings and share prices reveals that the largest asset managers (BlackRock, Fidelity, and Vanguard) and banks (Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and JP Morgan Chase) control shares across 24 Bitcoin mining companies in excess of $1.35 billion. Vanguard leads with the highest investment of over $615M, followed closely by BlackRock with nearly $600M. Fidelity tops the others with the most widespread shares across 22 mining companies. On the bank front, Goldman Sachs leads with $28M+ in shareholdings, closely followed by JP Morgan Chase with over $26M. JP Morgan Chase has investments across 17 mining operations.\n\nThese companies are blatantly ignoring Bitcoin\u2019s climate impact and air, water, and noise pollution despite having environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment criteria or net-zero climate goals. The pollution affecting people living near the mines is duplicitous to these goals. For example, Stronghold Digital, in which Vanguard, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and Fidelity hold shares, uses toxic coal ash to directly fuel its electricity needs. According to EWG, Stronghold has two waste coal-fueled generating facilities: the 85 MW Scrubgrass Plant in Venango County, Pa., and the 80 MW Panther Creek Plant, in Carbon County, Pa. Before Stronghold\u2019s 2021 purchase of these coal plants, the plants were virtually non-operational with electricity generation and coal consumption reduced by 95 percent between 2014 and 2020. The waste coal that Stronghold burns for electricity is poor-quality coal discarded by previous coal-mining operations. This kind of coal has low energy content and high toxin levels. Burning waste coal is pollution-intensive, including carbon emissions, heavy metals, and air toxics that hurt communities closest to the mining facilities. Under Stronghold\u2019s ownership, the plant has burned 830 percent more waste coal compared to 2020, and in 2022 waste coal consumption was up by about 1,800 percent over 2020 \u2013 the most since 2014.\n\nVanguard, BlackRock, Fidelity, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs Group, and Citigroup have invested over $700M in Riot Blockchain, with Vanguard and BlackRock leading the pack by far. Similar to other Bitcoin miners, Riot causes environmental and economic harm to residents living near the mines. The impacts include massive electricity and water use, utility rate hikes, and water, air, and noise pollution.\n\nA New York Times investigation also found that Riot Platforms is the largest emitter of climate pollution amongst other U.S. mining companies. Riot Platforms\u2019 excessive electricity use in Texas is largely fueled by coal power. Residents in Navarro County, TX, organized against Riot Platforms to stop the miner\u2019s role in consuming massive amounts of electricity, increasing rates for water and electricity for residents, increasing air pollution, and causing excessive noise pollution.\n\nHow can companies such as Vanguard, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, Fidelity, and the others that have invested in Bitcoin mining reconcile that with company climate and ESG goals? Clearly, those in charge of the company\u2019s sustainability commitments cannot. These companies are turning a blind eye to these investments like other fossil fuel investments perpetuating climate chaos.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Asset managers and banks can publicly call for Bitcoin to change its code and reduce its electricity consumption by nearly 100%. These companies can also stop all fossil fuel investments, including those to climate-wrecking Bitcoin mining operations. If they care about keeping our planet livable, that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019ll do."

The BNB token issued by Binance was the biggest loser with a drop of more than 10% in the past 24 hours.\n\nTop 10 cryptos slide\n\nBitcoin dropped 5.66% over the last 24 hours to US$25,730 at 7:10 a.m. in Hong Kong, bringing losses over the past seven days to 7.23%, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nEther fell 4.91% in the same period to US$1,808, and logged a 4.56% weekly loss.\n\nBNB skidded 10.21% to US$275.17 in the last 24 hours, losing 11.61% over the past week.\n\nThe SEC on Monday filed 13 charges against Binance, alleging the exchange made unregistered and unlawful offers and sales of its BNB and BUSD tokens. The SEC also alleged that Binance did not register Binance.com as an exchange or a broker-dealer clearing agency.\n\nIn response to the SEC lawsuit, Binance said in a Tuesday statement that it intends to defend its platform \u201cvigorously.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s refusal to productively engage with us is just another example of the Commission\u2019s misguided and conscious refusal to provide much-needed clarity and guidance to the digital asset industry,\u201d Binance said.\n\nCryptocurrencies traded on the Binance exchange, including BNB, BUSD, Solana, Cardano\u2019s ADA, Polygon\u2019s MATIC, are securities and require registration and regulation, according to the SEC suit.\n\nSolana dropped 9.52% over the past 24 hours, with ADA falling 7.73% and MATIC losing 7.64%.\n\n\u201cThe total crypto market cap is down,\u201d Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of APAC business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock, told Forkast on Tuesday morning in Asia. \u201cThe fact that the news doesn\u2019t come as a shock doesn\u2019t mean that it was priced in, apparently.\u201d\n\nIn a Monday tweet, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said that Zhao and Binance entities engaged in \u201can extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure and calculated evasion of the law.\u201d\n\nIn response, Zhao tweeted: \u201cWonder if he ever reads the comments under his post, from the consumers he is [supposed] to protect.\u201d\n\nWonder if he ever reads the comments under his post, from the consumers he is suppose to protect. https://t.co/xQjC872GsD \u2014 CZ \ud83d\udd36 Binance (@cz_binance) June 5, 2023\n\nAccording to d\u2019Anethan, the SEC\u2019s legal action is not a surprise considering the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission had earlier filed a lawsuit against Binance for alleged violations of trading rules for derivatives.\n\nHowever, traders see the lawsuit as extremely bearish and it\u2019s shaking up the market, he said.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap fell 4.6% to US$1.09 trillion in the 24 hours through to 8:30am Hong Kong, while trading volume surged 118% to more than US$48 billion.\n\nApple headset bumps Binance in NFT market\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index edged down 0.17% to 3,295.91 in the 24 hours to 9:20 a.m. in Hong Kong.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Binance \u201chasn\u2019t had an impact on NFTs yet, but it likely will,\u201d Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News, said on Tuesday. \u201cIt has already impacted crypto, and usually NFTs lag behind just a bit.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S. overnight, Apple Inc. unveiled its highly-anticipated mixed-reality headset Vision Pro. While priced at a hefty US$3,499, the headset has got the NFT industry excited about its potential application in metaverse developments.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s headset is really all the NFT spaces was talking about today and rightfully so,\u201d Petscher said. \u201cReally, it\u2019s the single most important thing to happen to NFTs since CryptoPunks, even though Apple didn\u2019t mention NFTs or the metaverse once in their reveal of the Vision Pro.\u201d\n\nS\u00e9bastien Borget, co-founder and chief operating officer of decentralized gaming giant The Sandbox, said in a Tuesday interview with Forkast that Apple\u2019s headset is \u201copening a big field of opportunity\u201d for metaverse developments.\n\n\u201cThis has the highest chance of becoming a game changer versus everything we\u2019ve seen so far over the past five years in this field \u2026 allowing people to interact with their virtual assets in the physical world.\u201d\n\nNFT sales on Ethereum rose 5.64% over the last 24 hours to US$25.75 million, and gained 90.84% in the past week. Sales on the Bitcoin network climbed 4.17% to US$3.16 million, but recorded a 11.87% weekly decline.\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Azuki remained the two most-sold Ethereum collections. BAYC had the biggest sales in the past 24 hours of US$7.26 million, followed by Azuki\u2019s US$2.65 million.\n\nDMarket, a Mythos blockchain-based collection of gaming NFTs, was the third most-sold collection over the past 24 hours with an 11.49% rise in sales to US$1.52 million.\n\nCoinbase shares hit by Binance\n\nImage: Coinbase\n\nShares of Coinbase, the largest crypto trading platform in the U.S., dropped 9.05% on Monday following the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Binance. Shares of MicroStrategy, the world\u2019s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, fell 8.53%.\n\nU.S. stock futures also moved marginally lower as of 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 0.05%, S&P 500 futures fell 0.04%. Nasdaq Futures fell 0.09%.\n\nCoinbase has its own legal battle with the SEC. In March, the SEC alleged Coinbase violated investor protection laws and threatened enforcement action against the exchange. Coinbase argued back in April that the SEC\u2019s move appeared to be undermining its own role as the monitor of companies registering to sell shares to the public.\n\nCoinbase has also requested a court to compel the SEC to publicly respond to the exchange\u2019s July 2022 petition asking for clearer crypto regulation guidelines.\n\nOn the regulation front, Paul Grewal, chief legal officer of Coinbase, tweeted on Monday that he will testify on Tuesday before the House Committee on Agriculture on the need for clear crypto rules and on the Digital Asset Market Structure discussion draft released Friday.\n\n\u201cThe US is falling behind,\u201d Grewal tweeted. \u201cWe cannot afford to ignore crypto while other markets take advantage of our absence, developing rules and regulations that enable the industry to thrive and risk sending jobs, investment, and technological leadership overseas.\u201d\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

The answer lurks in the word decentralized \u2013 which means that the Bitcoin network is managed by nobody and everybody at the same time.\n\nWho controls Bitcoin?\n\nBy definition, decentralize means \u201c to move the control of an organization or government from a single place to several smaller ones.\u201d\n\nThe same goes for the Bitcoin network, except instead of \u201cseveral smaller places,\u201d the control of the system is delegated to thousands of nodes \u2013 people who choose to run the Bitcoin software on their computers.\n\nNo central authority makes decisions in regards to the Bitcoin network; instead, everyone gets to call the shots. No one owns Bitcoin technology, so there is no hidden mastermind who controls Bitcoin.\n\nThe governance of Bitcoin\n\nIt is users around the world who control Bitcoin. Anyone is free to develop and improve the bitcoin software. Likewise, anyone is free to choose which version of the software they want to run. However, to make it a usable, network, users must come together and run compatible versions of the software. In the end, a strong network requires everyone to operate within the same rules, and that\u2019s how bitcoin consensus is reached \u2013 by the majority vote.\n\nThis is who controls Bitcoin: majority vote. Since all nodes in the network are equal, if the majority decides something, it will happen. And if you do oppose the change, you are free to join other systems (that\u2019s why there are so many bitcoin forks). The strongest network wins, and that\u2019s why most of the users, miners, and developers have an incentive to respect and protect this mutual agreement. It is in everyone\u2019s best interest to keep the network active, secure, and healthy!\n\nInfluence over the bitcoin network\n\nBut who controls the Bitcoin network? One might say that it is developers, who discuss how the system should be developed and improved. Others say it\u2019s the miners, who choose which version of the software they want to run. But again \u2013 it must be the majority who decides on the future of Bitcoin, as there are no nodes, or participants, that get any special or preferential treatment.\n\nSuch is the nature of genuinely decentralized organizations. And apparently, it works!\n\nCheck out our guide on \u201cwhat is bitcoin mining\u201d to learn more about how Bitcoin mining works."

        "content": "On Friday, the Republican chairs of two House committees released a proposed overhaul of crypto regulation in the U.S. It was only a \u201cdiscussion draft\u201d meant to get negotiations going, and widespread support was far from guaranteed. But it was the kind of comprehensive review of crypto rules that the industry has been asking for for years. And then, days later, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) went nuclear on Binance and then Coinbase , suing both of them, essentially on grounds that existing regulations are adequate and strongly suggesting these businesses simply are not allowed in the U.S. The takeaway here sure seems to be that the direction the political winds blow could determine crypto\u2019s viability in the country."

        "content": "By Euronews, AP and AFP\n\nAccording to a lawsuit filed by the US SEC, Binance and its founder have mishandled funds and violated US securities laws.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao have been accused of misusing investor funds, operating as an unregistered exchange, and violating a slew of US securities laws in a lawsuit filed by US regulators.\n\nFiled in a federal court in Washington DC, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit on Monday lists 13 charges against the firm - including commingling and divert customer assets to an entity Zhao owned called Sigma Chain.\n\nThe news caused Bitcoin, the largest crypto in terms of value in circulation - worth over $500 billion (\u20ac468 billion) - to plummet, losing almost 2 per cent in a matter of minutes.\n\nWhy is Binance in the dock?\n\nBinance is a Cayman Islands limited liability company founded by Zhao and the charges are familiar to practices uncovered after the collapse of the second largest cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, last year.\n\nThe lawsuit lays out the extent to which the firm's owners knew of the alleged legal violations, stating \"Binance\u2019s CCO bluntly admitted to another Binance compliance officer in December 2018, 'we are operating as a fking unlicensed securities exchange in the USA bro'\".\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler in a written statement that Zhao and Binance \"engaged in an extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and calculated evasion of the law\".\n\n\"The public should beware of investing any of their hard-earned assets with or on these unlawful platforms,\" Gensler said.\n\nIn a social media post, Binance said that it has been cooperating with the SEC's investigation but said that the agency \"chose to act unilaterally and litigate\".\n\n\"While we take the SEC\u2019s allegations seriously, they should not be the subject of an SEC enforcement action, let alone on an emergency basis. We intend to defend our platform vigorously,\u201d the company said in a Twitter post.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the SEC\u2019s refusal to productively engage with us is just another example of the Commission\u2019s misguided and conscious refusal to provide much-needed clarity and guidance to the digital asset industry\".\n\nNew blow for crypto after FTX collapse\n\nThe lawsuit comes roughly eight months after the collapse of FTX, which was also accused of co-mingling customers' funds and investing the proceeds in high-risk investments that customers were unaware they were participating in.\n\nUS prosecutors and the SEC charged FTX's founder Sam Bankman-Fried with a host of money laundering, fraud, and securities fraud charges in December. His criminal trial is likely to be in the fall.\n\n\"The new complaint from the SEC against Binance is a laundry list of charges laying out exactly the same claims that many in the Bitcoin and crypto communities have made against Changpeng Zhao and his companies for many years,\" said Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, a Bitcoin financial services company.\n\n\"These practices of Binance have essentially been open secrets, so no one who operates in the space will be surprised by any of the charges\".\n\nUS regulators have gone after Binance before.\n\nIn March, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed an enforcement action against Binance and Zhao in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois charging them with numerous CTFC violations.\n\nThe complaint also charges Samuel Lim, Binance\u2019s former chief compliance officer, with aiding and abetting Binance\u2019s violations."

        "content": "Explore the comparative analysis between Bitcoin and Pi Network, two prominent networks shaping the future of decentralized finance. Uncover their differences in mining, scalability, market acceptance, and community dynamics.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nBitcoin and Pi Network are compared in terms of their foundational principles, mining methods, scalability, market acceptance, and community dynamics.\n\nBitcoin operates as a decentralized digital currency, while Pi Network focuses on accessible mining through mobile devices.\n\nBitcoin mining relies on computational power for security, while Pi Network utilizes a mobile mining approach with lower energy consumption.\n\nBitcoin faces scalability challenges, while Pi Network needs to address scalability as it aims for widespread adoption. Market acceptance and value differ between the two networks.\n\nCryptocurrencies have opened new avenues for financial transactions, decentralized networks, and innovative technologies. Bitcoin, the first and most well-known digital asset, has paved the way for a digital revolution.\n\nHowever, newer players like Pi Network are entering the market with unique propositions and aiming to challenge the status quo. This article will conduct a comparative analysis of Pi Network and the Bitcoin network to understand their similarities, differences, and potential implications for the future of Decentralized Finance (DeFi).\n\nFoundational Principles\n\nBitcoin, introduced in 2009 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, was designed to be a decentralized digital currency that operates on a peer-to-peer network. Its foundational principles include security, transparency, and scarcity. Bitcoin's blockchain technology enables secure transactions without intermediaries or central authorities.\n\nPi Network, on the other hand, was founded by a team of Stanford graduates in 2019. It creates a digital currency, $PI, that can be mined using mobile devices, making it accessible to the masses.\n\nMining and Network Security\n\nBoth Pi Network and Bitcoin utilize mining as a fundamental process, but they employ different approaches. Bitcoin mining involves solving complex mathematical problems through computational power to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. This process ensures network security and prevents double-spending.\n\nIn contrast, Pi Network's mobile mining aims to provide an alternative approach that allows users to mine using their smartphones. It utilizes a consensus algorithm that doesn't require massive computational power or energy consumption. However, it's important to note that Pi Network is still in the enclosed mainnet phase, and the security and decentralization of its network are not as established as Bitcoin's.\n\nScalability and Transaction Speed\n\nScalability has been a significant challenge for Bitcoin. The network can handle a limited number of transactions per second, leading to congestion during peak periods and higher transaction fees. Various solutions, such as the Lightning Network, have been proposed to address these scalability issues and enhance transaction speed.\n\nPi Network, a relatively new project, has not yet faced the same scalability challenges as Bitcoin. However, as Pi Network aims to achieve widespread adoption, it must address scalability concerns to support a growing number of transactions and users when the open mainnet goes live.\n\nMarket Acceptance and Value\n\nBitcoin has gained widespread acceptance and recognition as a digital asset and a medium of exchange. It has attracted institutional investors, retail traders, and merchants worldwide. Bitcoin's value is determined by market demand, and its price has experienced significant volatility over the years.\n\nIn comparison, Pi Network\u2019s enclosed mainnet phase means that its native currency has not yet been listed on major exchanges. Its value and market dynamics are not freely tradable or well-established. Pi Network's success in gaining market acceptance and establishing value will depend on user adoption, utility, and listing on reputable exchanges.\n\nCommunity and Ecosystem\n\nBitcoin has a robust and active community of developers, enthusiasts, and supporters. Its open-source nature has allowed for the development of various applications, platforms, and services built on top of the Bitcoin network. The Bitcoin community has played a vital role in its growth and adoption.\n\nPi Network, as a newer project, is also building its community of users and supporters. It has attracted many early adopters enthusiastic about its vision of accessible mining. The Pi Network team actively engages with the community, providing updates and addressing concerns. Building a solid and engaged community will be crucial for Pi Network's success and future development.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe comparative analysis between Pi Network and the Bitcoin network highlights their differences in approach, mining methods, scarcity, scalability, market acceptance, and community dynamics. Bitcoin, as the pioneer in the cryptocurrency space, has established itself as a widely recognized and accepted digital asset. Its decentralized nature, security, and growing ecosystem contribute to its value and market dominance.\n\nPi Network, on the other hand, is a newer project that aims to bring mining to the masses through mobile devices. It introduces a unique consensus algorithm and focuses on accessibility and user-friendliness. However, Pi Network is still in its early stages, and its network security, scalability, and market acceptance are yet to be fully established.\n\nBoth Pi Network and the Bitcoin network contribute to the continuous innovation and evolution of decentralized finance. While Bitcoin remains the leader in market acceptance, value, and ecosystem development, Pi Network's vision of accessible mining and user-friendly approach could have implications for making cryptocurrencies more inclusive and widespread.\n\nWhat is Pi Network?\n\nPi Network is a mobile mining blockchain with an application that lets people earn Pi coins by doing simple tasks on their phones. However, the project remains in its development stage with delivery of an open mainnet still a matter of speculation, with no launch date confirmed.\n\nWith this in mind, the protocol remains in its testnet stage and will apparently go live when many users (Pioneers) complete the mandatory KYC procedure while the core team works on developing its ecosystem.\n\nPi Network is also reported to be under investigation by authorities in Vietnam and users should exercise a high degree of caution when interacting with the project and ensure they have conducted sufficient research before doing so."

        "title": "9 benefits of cryptocurrency in business - TechTarget",
        "content": "It's becoming increasingly clear that cryptocurrency usage is not a short-term fad and is likely to be a technology trend that will continue to provide benefits for business into the future.\n\nFor the uninitiated, cryptocurrency is a form of digital currencies that differs in many ways from the traditional fiat currency individuals worldwide have been using for centuries. Unlike fiat currency, cryptocurrency isn't issued and managed by any one central national government. Cryptocurrency is distributed and runs on blockchain technology that provides an immutable ledger for tracking transactions.\n\nThere are many different cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin perhaps the most well-known, though not the only, cryptocurrency in popular usage. Other commonly used cryptocurrencies used by businesses include Ethereum, which is widely used in support of Web 3.0 applications. Here are some of the many benefits of cryptocurrency for businesses.\n\n2. Access to new liquidity and capital Cryptocurrency has the potential to help a business raise new funds and improve financial liquidity. A business could potentially be loaned cryptocurrency without being subject to the same limitations that might be associated with getting a loan of fiat money from a traditional bank. Cryptocurrency is also often at the center of decentralized finance, which can potentially help a business with financial liquidity. In the early days of cryptocurrency, funds also were often raised via an initial coin offering (ICO). A new cryptocurrency is first minted and offered on an exchange much like an initial public offering when a company offers shares for sale for the first time. But the practical utility of ICOs as a vehicle for fundraising has diminished due to the crypto market's maturation. Companies stand to gain several advantages from cryptocurrency transactions.\n\n3. Expanded payment methods By supporting cryptocurrency, a business can offer consumers and business partners a broader range of payment options, instead of being limited to fiat currency alone.\n\n4. Potential for attracting new customers and demographic groups Every business accepts fiat money, but not every business accepts cryptocurrency. That differentiation can potentially attract new customers and different demographic groups beyond what a business can serve with fiat currency alone. An October 2022 report found that a growing number of businesses in the U.S. and worldwide are accepting cryptocurrency.\n\n5. Entry into the Web 3.0 world Cryptocurrency is a gateway for organizations to enter and be part of the Web 3.0 universe. Web 3.0 technologies rely on blockchain and tend to require cryptocurrency as a method of payment during transactions. There are many different Web 3.0 use cases and examples that can benefit a business. One method is participating in the decentralized applications (dApps) space to build or sell services, though it's not quite as comprehensive as it once was. There's also a market for businesses with nonfungible tokens.\n\n6. Transaction transparency and auditability Cryptocurrency is based on blockchain, which provides an immutable ledger -- a tamperproof, cryptographically assured record of transactions. The ledger's high degree of auditability enables a business to track audit transactions. The ledger also enables transparency to identify if a transaction occurs, potentially boosting accountability as well.\n\n7. Extra layer of customer privacy While the blockchain on which cryptocurrencies exist provides transparency into each transaction, it also helps protect user privacy. Blockchain and cryptocurrency, unlike fiat forms of payment like a credit card or bank account, don't associate with any personally identifiable information. A cryptocurrency transaction relies on public key cryptography that involves a public and private key, which individuals can use and store in a crypto wallet.\n\n8. Cross-border transactions Even in the modern era of technology, businesses often encounter barriers when selling their products globally because of issues related to handling fiat money payments. Cryptocurrency offers an alternative, enabling businesses to buy and sell products without engaging a bank or payment processor that might charge additional fees for an international trade. While the value of cryptocurrency can and does fluctuate, the prevailing value is consistent worldwide. This global consistency for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin eliminates the complexities of currency conversions and associated transaction fees, while the absence of intermediaries can potentially foster faster and more cost-effective transactions."

        "content": "\u201cBitcoin has such a marketing problem.\u201d\n\nAt least, that\u2019s what came to mind for Bitcoin (BTC) advocate and Cointelegraph reporter Joe Hall when he was asked about the weaknesses and strengths of the popular cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile not labeling himself a \u201cBitcoin maximalist,\u201d Hall believes that most people \u2014 including crypto OGs \u2014 are shockingly unaware of what Bitcoin can do; and for this reason, he questions the necessity and future of most altcoin projects.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing it with imperfect solutions that in the long term will rug-pull them or close enough to that. Because, let\u2019s be honest, all of these crypto projects eventually collapse into Bitcoin, or they eventually collapse full stop. I mean, we saw enough of that last year. And, you know, in 10, 15, 20, maybe 40 years\u2019 time, will Bitcoin still be running? 1,000%. Will Ethereum still be running? Question marks. And will the other 20-ish thousand crypto projects still be going strong? I\u2019m pretty confident they won\u2019t be.\u201d\n\nHall proved his point by asking co-hosts Jonathan DeYoung and Ray Salmond to open up their Bitcoin Lightning wallets to accept the equivalent of $5 in satoshis. And after DeYoung downloaded the wallet and received the payment, both co-hosts were astonished at the speed of the transaction.\n\nOn Episode 13 of The Agenda podcast, Salmond and DeYoung spoke with Hall about his views on Bitcoin adoption and its \u201cmarketing problem,\u201d his ultimate vision of how Bitcoin could eventually conquer the financial world, and how his experience as a Bitcoin evangelist has connected him with people all around the world.\n\nIt\u2019s more than just money\n\nHall believes that Bitcoin is more than just money: It\u2019s a revolution, a lifestyle, a binder of people and a builder of community.\n\nHall said:\n\n\u201cBitcoin, to me, in my own words: It\u2019s an expression of how we approach the world, I guess. I mean, it\u2019s had an impact on me, in terms of my approach to people, to different cultures and in the way in which I interact with people \u2014 despite the fact that it is just a bunch of code on a screen. And because it\u2019s rewired the way in which I look at the world and consider things, it\u2019s taught me to be more skeptical and to not take things at face value. But it\u2019s also delivered a lot of hope and a lot of sort of meaning to my existence that perhaps wasn\u2019t there previously.\u201d\n\nHall has elected to only live off Bitcoin for day-to-day expenses, excluding when he has to pay European Union taxes. As to why he is such a strong believer in the digital currency, Hall shared, \u201cWe can\u2019t live in a world that is governed by growth at all costs when we have one finite, very precious planet.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin, for me, it appeals to me because of the way that it flips that all on its head. You know, we have a deflationary currency, there\u2019s only going to be 21 million, and we can rebuild our economic system off that in a way that raises all boats, not just the elite few. And it tackles things like the wealth gap and wealth inequality. It tackles things like the environment and the way in which, you know, Bitcoin mining could be this transition to using more and more renewable energies.\u201d\n\nTo hear more from Hall\u2019s conversation with The Agenda \u2014 including Hall\u2019s future vision for Bitcoin and his fascination with the Lightning Network \u2014 listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph\u2019s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

        "title": "Heilpern loves Bitcoin, hates bullshit\u2026 was a China state media journo: Hall of Flame - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Author of Undressing Bitcoin: A Revealing Guide to the World\u2019s Most Revolutionary Asset and host of The Layah Heilpern Show.\n\nAuthor, podcaster and crypto influencer Layah Heilpern\u2019s unapologetic and sometimes controversial tweets have amassed her an impressive 606,900 Twitter followers.\n\nShe tells Hall of Flame she fearlessly \u201cspeaks the truth about things\u201d and admires others who do likewise.\n\nUnlike many influencers represented by fancy talent agencies, Heilpern decided to keep it all in the family by hiring her brother Gideon as her manager.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one I trust more in this world than my brother. I can rely on him 100%,\u201d Heilpern says.\n\nHeilpern says she has \u201cgreat parents\u201d and isn\u2019t shy about letting the world know her mother is more attractive than Madonna. (Although that\u2019s no longer as impressive as it once was.)\n\nBefore achieving fame in the world of crypto, she had an interesting stint working as a journalist for Chinese state media, when she briefly became a business and finance correspondent for a China Central Television offshoot in 2019.\n\n\n\n\u201cI used to work with China\u2019s Global TV network, so I actually used to be a journalist for the Chinese government,\u201d she reveals, adding that working there took micromanagement on an entirely new level:\n\n\u201cI did one report on Huawei technology. I had all the Chinese people around me checking what I was saying and what I wasn\u2019t saying. So, we\u2019re instructed to make it a fluff piece rather than an actual good report.\u201d\n\nHowever, she threw her career in state-sponsored journalism out the window when she fell down the crypto rabbit hole.\n\nHeilpern became obsessed with the subject and even published a book called Undressing Bitcoin: A Revealing Guide to the World\u2019s Most Revolutionary Asset in 2021 despite admitting she \u201cwas always terrible at English in school.\u201d\n\nAs for her career highlight so far? She says nothing has topped interviewing the big wig of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange. [Hall of Flame interviewed Heilpern prior to the SEC\u2019s recent slew of allegations about CZ and Binance.]\n\n\u201c[A career highlight for me is] interviewing CZ at the Binance blockchain event in Dubai where I was the host and MC for the whole conference. CZ is one of the most powerful people in crypto and one of the greatest innovators. Interviewing him on stage was incredible.\u201d\n\nIt seems that Heilpern made a positive impression on CZ, too, as they often can be seen engaging in banter on Twitter.\n\nWhat led to Layah Heilpern\u2019s Twitter fame?\n\nHeilpern has been on Twitter for over a decade and explains there is no shortcut to growing a fanbase \u2014 other than actually putting in the work.\n\n\u201cWhen you tweet every day, you tend to build a following. I think it\u2019s also because I speak the truth about certain things. I think people are thirsty for the truth\u2026 whatever the truth might be.\u201d\n\nShe explains that the more followers you have, the easier it is to build more followers \u201cbecause you have credibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can gain 50,000 followers in one month, whereas that could take somebody like two years to do. So, it sort of becomes quite rapid growth eventually,\u201d she says.\n\nBut the fame side of things doesn\u2019t really excite Heilpern.\n\nWhat can you expect on Heilpern\u2019s Twitter account?\n\nHeilpern doesn\u2019t want to sugar-coat it: Her content is not for everyone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very much freedom orientated. It\u2019s very much anti-system, Bitcoin-focused, uplifting, and positive, personal responsibility,\u201d she explains.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t feel the need to appeal to everyone either.\n\n\u201cI speak very unapologetically; I think there is just a gap in the market for that. So, people just run to you,\u201d she says.\n\nHeilpern says that, as her audience grows, she does have to be more cautious about the impact of her words and to be more mindful of her safety.\n\n\u201cMy words have more weight, so I can\u2019t make as many jokes anymore. But I still try not to censor myself too much. I also have to be careful about sharing personal information, which I will be doing less of.\u201d\n\nThat being said, Heilpern has no problem taking shots at multibillion-dollar corporations.\n\nWhat Heilpern enjoys on Twitter\n\nHeilpern enjoys like-minded people on Twitter who \u201cspeak the truth about things\u201d whether that is in crypto or politics \u2014 she just craves honesty and hates bullshit.\n\n\u201cI like people who call out the bullshit that we see in the system. I don\u2019t like people who pander to their audience. I like people who are unapologetic and say things how they are.\u201d\n\nLayah Heilpern\u2019s price predictions\n\nHeilpern\u2019s Bitcoin price prediction for the remainder of 2023 isn\u2019t exactly going to have you jumping out of your seat.\n\n\u201cOver the next six months towards the end of 2023, I would say we\u2019re just going to continue to move sideways. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to go any higher than $34,000\u2013$35,000,\u201d she says.\n\nHowever, she is optimistic about Bitcoin over what the next 12\u201324 months can bring.\n\n\u201cI mean, maybe at the end of 2024, we could potentially reach all-time highs, again around $69,000, but that is not financial advice,\u201d she says.\n\nHeilpern says Bitcoin could hit $100,000 in \u201cearly 2025.\u201d\n\nWhile Heilpern can\u2019t remember if it was Bitcoin or XRP that she bought first, she does admit that she \u201csold the XRP immediately.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really have any predictions for the other [cryptocurrencies]. I just think they\u2019re all very unpredictable shitcoins,\u201d she states.\n\nAs for Ethereum, Heilpern doesn\u2019t see the price dropping anytime soon but has no interest in it.\n\n\u201cThe price of Ethereum will continue to rise in my opinion, given how much is being built on it. However, I don\u2019t like Ethereum, as I think it\u2019s controlled by the elites and not decentralized.\u201d"

The term, cryptocurrency derives from the origin of the encryption techniques that are employed to secure the netw Read this Term. The company, listed on both the London Stock Exchange (LSE: ARB) and NASDAQ (ARBK), showcased a significant uptick in its Bitcoin (BTC) mining operations.\n\nArgo Blockchain Reports Higher BTC Production\n\nDuring May, Argo mined a total of 173 BTC, averaging 5.6 BTC per day. This marks a substantial increase of 16% from the preceding month, with an average daily production rate of 4.8 BTC. The swell in BTC production can be attributed to increased uptime and an improvement in the operational efficiency of the company's mining fleet. Moreover, a jump in transaction fees on the Bitcoin network contributed to the overall surge in production.\n\nIn addition, the previous month saw a rise in mining revenue for Argo, reaching $4.75 million. This is a solid leap of 14% from April's earnings which stood at $4.17 million. However, the company observed a decrease in the BTC holdings over the month, with 50 BTC held at the end of May which is down from 83 BTC held at April's end. This decline stems from the company's decision to liquidate certain digital assets with the intent to utilize the proceeds toward debt repayment.\n\n\"I'm pleased by the significant increase in the company's BTC production during the month of May,\" Seif El-Bakly, the Interim CEO of Argo Blockchain, commented. \"This is a testament to the hard work of our mining operations team to optimize performance across our fleet.\"\n\nKeep Reading Nigeria Presses Binance amid Economic Turmoil and Detains Executives\n\nArgo Blockchain's total hash rate capacity remains steady at 2.5 Exahashes per second (EH/s). Nevertheless, the company anticipates a boost in capacity following the introduction of new BlockMiner machines at its Quebec facilities later this year. The additional machinery is projected to elevate the company's total hash rate capacity by 12% to approximately to 2.8 EH/s.\n\nEl-Bakly added: \"Over the long term, I believe increased Bitcoin network activity has the potential to drive demand for block space and increase miner fees.\" His statement reflects a positive outlook on the future prospects of Bitcoin mining operations, signifying Argo's commitment to capitalizing on the promising market dynamics.\n\nArgo Produced 491 BTC in Q1, but Net Result on the Downside\n\nYesterday (Tuesday), Argo published unaudited financial results for Q1 2023, showing a total BTC production of 491 tokens in the reported period and an average mining rate which is similar to May's figures. Although the report showed notable improvements in revenue, cash reserves, and cost reductions, the company could not achieve a positive net result.\n\nArgo Blockchain achieved a surge of 15% in revenue from Q4 2022, amounting to $11.4 million. Despite incurring a net loss of $8.7 million, the company attained an adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 million.\n\nIn its recently published financials for 2022, the publicly-listed miner reported a year-end revenue of $58.6 million, representing a significant decline of 36%. The company faced a net loss of $240.2 million for the year, primarily attributed to the diminishing value of cryptos.\n\nDespite the company reporting net losses, it appears to be on the path to stabilization. However, this stability seemed far from guaranteed toward the end of last year as the bankruptcy Bankruptcy Bankruptcy or insolvency constitutes a legal term and refers to being unable to repay debts.

To start, it makes perfect sense for long-term holders of BTC to invest in life insurance denominated in that asset and to enable a percentage of their BTC holdings to become active,\u201d Townsend said.\n\nMeanwhile also uses artificial intelligence in its underwriting of life insurance policies, with an AI-powered underwriting, claims, and operations system, as it hopes to deliver a more efficient end-to-end insurance experience, while also reducing manual labor and promoting transparency.\n\nThe start-up has raised $19 million across two seed rounds, with Hudson Structured Capital Management (HSCM) a participant, alongside other well-known venture and tech investing, as well as insurtech investing names, such as Sam Altman of OpenAI, former senior Stripe employee Lachy Groom, Gradient Ventures, Mouro Capital, and MS&AD Ventures.\n\nMeanwhile says it is licensed and regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority, although we\u2019re unsure what class of company it is using at this stage. The company does state that its \u201clicensed and regulated Bermuda subsidiary is entirely denominated in BTC, accepting all premiums and paying out all claims in BTC.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeanwhile is sitting at the confluence of the AI and digital assets transformation,\u201d explained Anna Patterson, Managing Partner at Gradient Ventures. \u201cThe team has an opportunity to change how consumers use digital money and set a new standard for tech-enabled life insurance providers. We\u2019re excited to support Zac and Max on their mission.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe insurance sector is often regarded as inefficient and adverse to new technologies, and frankly, that is true in many cases,\u201d added Jon Soberg, Managing Partner of MS&AD Ventures. \u201cMeanwhile flips this perception on its head, uniting both blockchain and AI to create a truly one-of-a-kind, dynamic life insurance program. We are delighted to participate in this funding round and look forward to seeing the unique financial products Meanwhile will unveil.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile is also a tax advantaged way to make bitcoin active, the company states, with users able to access some of the liquidity of their life policies tax-free, while also acting as a way wealth can be passed on in a tax efficient manner."

Efficiency at its finest! Sorting algorithms come to the forefront when order matters. With its mesmerizing dance of comparisons and swaps, Bubble Sort meticulously sorts data from chaos to order. Quick Sort, the agile partitioning maestro, divides and conquers, efficiently arranging elements. And let\u2019s remember Merge Sort, the harmonious symphony of the divide, best, and merge, gracefully placing data elegantly.\n\nGetting Certified as a Blockchain Expert\n\nTo get the best out of your skills and knowledge, you should take a certification like Certified Bitcoin Expert\u2122 that will increase your reliability as a Bitcoin expert and help you to get more opportunities. The goal of this certification course, like ours, is to help you provide a structure that you can follow to focus on skills needed in the industry and keep you updated about the changes that can impact your job role in the future and help you keep upskilling.\n\nBlockchain Council has always tried to provide the best resources to its pupils, and we ensure that you get all the practical knowledge to stand apart in the crowd and achieve your goal of becoming a Bitcoin expert in the most efficient way possible.\n\nWhat are the future aspects of a Bitcoin expert?\n\nGrowth of Bitcoin\n\nCryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin, has experienced significant volatility and market fluctuations. Understanding its history and prospects can provide insights into the potential movement of the crypto economy. While specific and accurate predictions are challenging due to the unpredictable nature of the market, industry professionals have shared their perspectives on Bitcoin\u2019s future. Here are some expert predictions:\n\nBobby Lee: The CEO of BTC China, Bobby Lee, believes Bitcoin can reach $1,000,000 in 20 years. He has made accurate predictions, such as Bitcoin falling to $41,000 in 2023.\n\nMark Yusko: Formerly a Bitcoin skeptic, Mark Yusko now predicts a price of $500,000 for Bitcoin in 2030. He also believes Bitcoin can achieve equivalence with gold in the future.\n\nJohn Pfeffer: Partner at Pfeffer Capital, John Pfeffer, uses mathematical calculations to predict a price of $700,000 for Bitcoin in 2030.\n\nThese predictions may turn true, but the situation is clear that Bitcoin will become one of the essential economic assets to own shortly. With the increasing technology adoption, the need for experts will grow too.\n\nJob and Salary Prospects\n\nThe salary prediction for a Bitcoin expert can vary depending on the experience and skills of the individual. However, according to a recent report by Glassdoor, the average salary for a Bitcoin expert in the United States is $150,000. The report also found that the highest-paying cities for Bitcoin experts are New York City, San Francisco, and Chicago. The salary for a Bitcoin expert can also vary depending on the industry in which they work. For example, Bitcoin experts in the financial sector tend to earn higher salaries than those in the technology industry.\n\nBut, the salary for a Bitcoin expert is expected to grow in the coming years. This is due to the increasing demand for Bitcoin expertise as cryptocurrency becomes more prevalent, as we already discussed, and this is probably the best time to learn about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency-related concepts."

The presidential office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Volcano Energy said the funds would go toward an estimated 241 MW power generation park using solar and wind energy in the northwestern municipality of Metapan, which will eventually power the bitcoin mining farm Bitcoin mining uses high-power computers hooked up to a global network, sucking up massive amounts of electricity in the process. The energy-intensive practice has come under fire from environmentalists who are concerned that it would exacerbate forest loss and climate change.The announcement comes two years after Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele declared his intention to make bitcoin legal tender.A Reuters report found adoption among residents has been shaky, while the International Monetary Fund has cautioned against the embrace due to legal risks, fiscal fragility and the speculative market.Bukele and his bitcoin backers have said the currency can bring jobs, financial inclusion and foreign investment to the country, one of the poorest in the Western Hemisphere.The El Salvador government will have \"a preferred participation equivalent to 23% of the revenues\" in the project, Volcano Energy said, with private investors holding 27%.The remaining 50% will be reinvested back into infrastructure, the statement said, without clarifying the overall ownership structure.Tether, a startup operating a cryptocurrency pegged to the US dollar, participated in the initial investment, it confirmed in a separate statement, without specifying the amount contributed. It listed Josue Lopez, who was involved with a $200 million solar energy plant announced last year, as the CEO of Volcano Energy, and Max Keiser, a bitcoin influencer, as its chairman."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Cryptocurrencies myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nCrypto ownership more than doubled in the UK last year, the Financial Conduct Authority said on Wednesday, as it announced an October start date for its clampdown on mis-selling in a sector often dubbed finance\u2019s \u201cWild West\u201d.\n\nAlmost one in 10 people surveyed by the UK\u2019s top financial regulator owned cryptocurrencies in 2022, more than twice the number a year earlier, despite regulators warning that crypto investors should be prepared to lose their entire outlay.\n\n\u201cIt is up to people to decide whether they buy crypto . . . Our rules give people the time and the right risk warnings to make an informed choice,\u201d said Sheldon Mills, the FCA\u2019s head of consumers and competition. He added that its crackdown on crypto group advertising would begin on October 8.\n\nThe regulator\u2019s update comes in a bruising week for the crypto industry after two of its largest exchanges, Binance and Coinbase, were sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission over alleged securities law violations.\n\nIn recent months, the UK has proposed a sweeping new regulatory regime for crypto where rules governing the industry will be brought more closely into line with those for traditional financial services. A cross-party group of MPs recently criticised the policy, suggesting instead that crypto be overseen as a form of gambling.\n\nSome 36 per cent of 2,000 adults polled by the FCA said they had seen or heard crypto adverts, while 25 per cent of those who had not previously been involved in crypto became \u201ccurious\u201d as a result of being exposed to advertising campaigns.\n\nThe FCA\u2019s crypto marketing regime will require companies to use risk warnings and offer a \u201c24-hour cooling-off period\u201d for customers. Incentives for customers to \u201crefer a friend\u201d will also be banned.\n\nThe regime will apply to all crypto asset businesses marketing to UK customers, regardless of whether they are based in the UK or overseas. \u201cThe crypto industry needs to prepare now for this significant change,\u201d Mills said.\n\nHarry Eddis, a lawyer at Linklaters, said the rules would have a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on the UK market by making it harder for people to buy crypto currency.\n\nThe FCA currently regulates crypto firms for money-laundering compliance only. Its research found that 28 per of those who do not use crypto would be \u201cmore likely\u201d to buy it if the market and activity were regulated to a similar standard as traditional financial services.\n\nThe increase in ownership of crypto assets has come despite a tumultuous period for the market, which suffered a crisis of confidence last year that resulted in the collapse of former industry bellwether FTX.\n\nThe research also showed almost four-fifths of those buying crypto used disposable income to fund the purchases, 6 per cent borrowed money, and the rest used savings or gains from crypto sales.\n\nThe mean value of their investments was put at just under \u00a31,600, with 40 per cent holding less than \u00a3100. The most common reason given for buying crypto, as stated by 40 per cent of respondents, was \u201cas a gamble\u201d.\n\nThe price of the popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin, which peaked at more than $64,000 in November 2022, on Wednesday fell nearly 3 per cent to $26,484.\n\nA renewed crackdown on crypto marketing follows a blitz of American enforcement cases this week.\n\nThe SEC on Monday filed a lawsuit against Binance, alleging the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange mixed billions of dollars of customer cash with a separate trading firm owned by its chief executive Changpeng Zhao.\n\nOn Tuesday, the SEC sued Nasdaq-listed rival exchange Coinbase, alleging it violated US securities law by failing to register as a broker, national securities exchange or clearing agency."

        "content": "Bitcoin price is down 5% and trading below the $26,000 level. BTC is now at risk of a move toward the $25,000 support in the near term.\n\nBitcoin started a sharp decline below the $27,000 level.\n\nThe price is trading below $26,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average.\n\nThere is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $26,100 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).\n\nThe pair could correct higher but upsides might be limited above $26,200 and $26,400.\n\nBitcoin Price Takes Hit\n\nBitcoin price failed to start a fresh increase above the $27,000 resistance. BTC started a fresh decline below the $26,500 support and the 100 hourly Simple moving average.\n\nThe price is down 5% and there was a move below the $26,000 support. It even retested the $25,400 support zone. It is now consolidating below $26,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average.

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price liquidations cross $100 million after the SEC\u2019s recent lawsuit against Binance.\n\nEthereum price could retest the $2,000 psychological level if sidelined buyers join the fray.\n\nRipple price to get boring for a few days before XRP reveals its directional bias.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has suffered a fatal setback after the recent lawsuit that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed against Binance and its founder, Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao. The suit caused the markets to cascade, triggering a massive sell-off and causing roughly $311 million in liquidations across the entire crypto landscape.\n\nBTC Liquidations\n\nOut of the $311 million in liquidations, BTC takes the largest share with $112.27 million in liquidations, Ethereum (ETH) sits at $37.92 million and Ripple (XRP) at $6.72 million. Other altcoins make up roughly $50.16 million.\n\nLiquidations heatmap\n\nAlso read: Binance responds to SEC claims, plans to defend the platform vigorously\n\nBitcoin price remains rational\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price action over the last 50 days has set up four distinctive lower highs and lower lows. Connecting these swing points using trend lines reveals a falling wedge formation. This technical formation is a bullish setup, but considering BTC has breached the lower trend line, investors need to wait for more information.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin price has come close to retesting $25,290, which is the midpoint of the 59% rally witnessed between March 10 and March 27. Hence, the likely direction Bitcoin price will head next is south to find a stable support level. The $25,290 barrier will likely provide some respite from bears.\n\nA recovery inside the falling wedge could see Bitcoin price try and retest the upper limit of the wedge at roughly $27,395. A flip of this hurdle into a support floor could trigger a swift move to $30,048. This uptick is likely going to target the buy-side liquidity resting above this level.\n\nBTC/USD 1-day chart\n\nA bearish case scenario for Bitcoin (BTC) price will include BTC sliding lower to retest the 62% and 70.5% retracement levels of the 59% rally at $23,905 and $22,925, respectively. While in the short-term, this move might seem bearish, a revisit to these levels will be an opportunity for long-term holders to accumulate BTC.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: BTC delays inevitable crash to $25,000\n\nEthereum price could dip lower before a bounce\n\nEthereum (ETH) price currently sits below a critical support level at $1,817, leaving investors guessing where it will head next. A recovery of ETH above the aforementioned level, combined with Bitcoin\u2019s bounce, sounds plausible and could trigger a rebound rally for Ether.\n\nIf successful, Ethereum price could continue its ascent and target the $2,028 hurdle.\n\nETH/USD 12-hour chart\n\nIf the after-effects of the recent sell-off continue to impact the crypto markets, Ethereum (ETH) price could slide lower. In such a case, a retest of the $1,703 support level seems likely. The aforementioned level and the zone, extending from $1,563 to $1,478, are places where long-term holders are likely to accumulate ETH.\n\nRead more: Ethereum exchange supply hits multi-year lows, VanEck analysts predict a rally to $11,800\n\nRipple price to move sideways before revealing its move\n\nRipple (XRP) price has successfully hit targets of the inverse head-and-shoulders, as forecasted in previous publications. The recent sell-off pushed the XRP price into an inefficiency above the $0.483 support level.\n\nGoing forward, Ripple price is likely to consolidate between the $0.483 and $0.515 support levels before making a move to the upside. A successful flip of the $0.515 hurdle is likely to trigger a sweep of the $0.548 hurdle to collect the buy-side liquidity.\n\nXRP/USD 12-hour chart\n\nA failure to move higher after consolidation will signal a waning bullish momentum for Ripple (XRP) price. In such a case, a breakdown of the $0.483 support floor will be the obvious outcome. A further spike in selling pressure could send XRP down to retest the $0.466 barrier.\n\nAlso read: Pro-XRP attorney says Ripple has 25% chance of winning against SEC, Judge could announce verdict by September"

        "title": "Bitcoin Mining: Understanding the Pros and Cons - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Understanding the pros and cons of Bitcoin mining for navigating the opportunities of the crypto space\n\nBitcoin, the world\u2019s first decentralized cryptocurrency, has gained significant popularity since its inception in 2009. As the demand for Bitcoin continues to rise, so does the process of Bitcoin mining. Bitcoin mining is the reason behind Bitcoins being circulated in the market.\n\nBitcoin mining, a subset of the cryptocurrency mining ecosystem focuses solely on the validation and security of Bitcoin transactions. The process of validating and recording transactions on the Bitcoin network, the main purpose of Bitcoin mining is validating transactions to prevent fraud and adding new blocks to the blockchain that results in the decentralized creation of new Bitcoins. As per a recent estimate, the Bitcoin price value is around US$27, 269.78 on the exchange market. Over the years, the Bitcoin currency value has grown with future promises to Bitcoin miners who usually validate transactions. Let\u2019s now delve into Bitcoin Mining: Pros and Cons\n\nPros of Bitcoin Mining\n\n1 Generates Profit:Bitcoin mining can be a lucrative endeavor for those who have access to the necessary hardware and low-cost electricity. Miners are rewarded with newly minted Bitcoins and adding new transactions to the blockchain. In the early years, mining could be done using a regular computer, but as the network has grown, specialized hardware called Application-Specific Integrated Circuits has become necessary. Successful miners can earn a significant amount of Bitcoin if they mine efficiently and at the right time.\n\n2.Energy-intensive Nature: This nature of Bitcoin has drawn attention to the need for renewable energy sources. Miners seeking to maximize profits have shown interest in utilizing clean energy solutions like solar and wind power. This contributes to the growth of renewable energy infrastructure and helps mitigate environmental concerns associated with traditional energy sources.\n\n3.Security and Decentralization: Bitcoin mining plays a crucial role in maintaining the security and decentralization of the network. Miners validate transactions and ensure that they conform to the network\u2019s rules. This process prevents fraud and double-spending, making Bitcoin a secure digital currency. Additionally, the decentralized nature of mining means that no single entity has control over the network, reducing the risk of censorship or manipulation.\n\n4.Technological Innovation: Bitcoin mining has spurred technological innovation in the hardware industry. As the demand for more efficient mining equipment increases, companies invest in research and development to produce better ASICs. This technological progress can have spillover effects, benefiting other industries that require high-performance computing.\n\n5.An alternate income stream: Bitcoin mining offers an alternative income stream for individuals or businesses looking to diversify their financial portfolios. By engaging in mining activities, they can potentially generate revenue from the appreciation of Bitcoin as well as the mining rewards.\n\nCons of Bitcoin Mining\n\n1.Volatility and Market Risk: Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility poses risks to miners. The profitability of mining depends not only on the amount of Bitcoin mined but also on its market value. Fluctuations in Bitcoin\u2019s price can affect mining profitability, potentially rendering some mining operations unprofitable, especially during bear markets. Miners must carefully manage their operational costs and be prepared for market uncertainties.\n\n2.High Energy Consumption: Bitcoin mining is an energy-intensive process, primarily due to the computational power required to solve complex mathematical puzzles. As a result, mining operations consume significant amounts of electricity, contributing to environmental concerns and carbon emissions. Critics argue that the energy consumption associated with mining is unsustainable and exacerbates climate change.\n\n3.Cost of Equipment and Maintenance: Mining Bitcoin requires specialized hardware, such as ASICs, which can be expensive to purchase and maintain. Additionally, as the network difficulty increases, miners need to continually upgrade their equipment to stay competitive. The capital expenditure and ongoing maintenance costs can pose a barrier to entry for aspiring miners.\n\n4.Long-Term Viability: A greater supply of coins result in a decrease in mining rewards through a mechanism called halving. The decreased block rewards combined with the increasing difficulty level can make mining less profitable over time. Miners will need to rely more on transaction fees to sustain their operations with some challenges too regarding profitability.\n\n5.Centralization Concerns: While Bitcoin is designed to be decentralized, the reality is that mining has become increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few large players. Large-scale mining operations have access to more resources, allowing them to dominate the network and potentially control the consensus process. This concentration of power raises concerns about the centralization of Bitcoin mining and the security of the network.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Income tax on Bitcoin And its legality in India - ClearTax",
        "content": "Budget 2022 will be announced on 1st February 2022 addressed by FM Nirmala Sitharaman.\n\nIn this article we cover the following topics:\n\n\n\nLatest updates \u2013 Clarification on proposed Section 115BBH in Budget 2022\n\n\n\n1. Losses incurred from one virtual digital currency cannot be set-off against income from another digital currency.\n\n2. Infrastructure cost incurred on mining crypto assets will not be treated as cost of acquisition.\n\n\n\nUnion Budget 2022 Outcome:\n\n\n\n1. Income from transfer of virtual digital assets such as crypto, NFTs will be taxed at 30%.\n\n2. No deduction, except the cost of acquisition, will be allowed while reporting income from transfer of digital assets.\n\n3. Loss from digital assets cannot be set-off against any other income.\n\n4. Gifting of digital assets will attract tax in the hands of receiver.Losses incurred from one virtual digital currency cannot be set-off against income from another digital currency.\n\nWhat is bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is one of the earliest forms of cryptocurrency, forming part of the worldwide peer-to-peer payment system.\n\nCryptocurrency is digital money. It is considered to be more secure that the real money. Cryptocurrency uses something called cryptography to secure its transactions. Cryptography, to put it in simple words is a method of converting comprehensible data into complicated codes which are tough to crack. Cryptocurrencies are classified as a subset of digital currencies, alternative currencies and virtual currencies.\n\nBitcoin was the first ever cryptocurrency created in the year 2009. Subsequently, there has been a rapid increase in the number of cryptocurrencies that have been created some of which are Litecoin, Ethereum, Zcash, Dash, Ripple etc. Bitcoins, in India, have slowly started gaining popularity, given the efforts of the government to move towards a cashless economy.\n\nHowever, one should know that bitcoins, as of today, are not centrally administered or regulated by any specific body like the RBI which administers physical currency in India. In fact, peer-to-peer transactions with bitcoins are managed using something known as the blockchain technology which serves as a public ledger for all transactions.\n\n\n\nWhere does bitcoin come from or how is it generated?\n\nOne can obtain bitcoins either by :\n\nMining:\n\nMining is an activity where an individual (called the \u201cminer\u201d) uses his computer prowess to crack computationally difficult puzzles. The process of cracking such puzzles which are integral to the blockchain technology, help in maintaining them. As a reward for this, the miner gets new bitcoins which is nothing but creation of a bitcoin or mining.\n\n\n\nPurchasing them from a bitcoin exchange against real currency\n\n\n\nEveryone cannot be a bitcoin miner. Hence, you can consider buying bitcoins from bitcoin exchanges and store them in an online bitcoin wallet in digital form. Unicorn, Bitxoxo, Zebpay, Coinbase etc., are some of the bitcoin exchanges presently in India. Such bitcoins would be purchased in consideration for real currency.\n\nIt would be interesting to note that currently, the value of 1 bitcoin is approximately about INR 31,99,620.\n\n\n\nReceiving bitcoins in consideration of selling goods and services:\n\n\n\nThough this may not be a common phenomenon in India currently, there are few savvy businessmen who accept bitcoins (instead of real currency) on sale of goods or services, they deal in.\n\n\n\nIs bitcoin legal in India?\n\nAs earlier discussed, bitcoin, as a medium of payment, has neither been authorized nor been regulated by any central authority in India. Further, no set rules, regulations or guidelines have been laid down for resolving disputes that could arise while dealing with bitcoins. Hence, bitcoin transactions come with their own set of risks.\n\nHowever, given this background, one cannot conclude that bitcoins are illegal as, so far, there has been no ban on bitcoins in India. The Supreme Court of India has in its ruling pronounced on 25 February 2019 required the Government to come up with Cryptocurrency regulation policies. The matter had been adjourned in the hearing on 29 March 2019 and has been rescheduled for hearing in the second week of July 2019.\n\n\n\nHow are bitcoins taxed in India?\n\nThe concept of bitcoins being quite new to the Indian market, apparently the government has not yet brought taxability of bitcoins into the statute books. At the same time, the levy of tax on bitcoins cannot be ruled out because the Indian income tax laws have always sought to tax income received irrespective of the form in which it is received.\n\nTherefore, the possibility of tax on bitcoins can be looked at under the following circumstances:\n\n\n\nScenario A: Bitcoin Mining\n\nBitcoins created by mining are self-generated capital assets. Subsequent sale of such bitcoins would, in the ordinary course, give rise to capital gains.\n\nHowever, one may note that the cost of acquisition of a bitcoin cannot be determined as it is a self-generated asset. Furthermore, it does not fall under the provisions of Section 55 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 which specifically defines the cost of acquisition of certain self-generated assets.\n\nTherefore, the capital gains computation mechanism fails following the Supreme Court decision in the case of B.C.Srinivasa Shetty. Hence, no capital gains tax would arise on the mining of bitcoins.\n\nThis position would hold till such time the government thinks of coming up with an amendment to Section 55 of the Act.\n\nAt this juncture, given that the Indian tax laws are silent on the taxability of bitcoins completely, we thought it right to comment on a probable contrary view by the income tax authorities. There is a possibility that the department may not consider bitcoins as capital assets at all.\n\nHence, the provisions of capital gains would not apply at all. Accordingly, the income tax authorities may choose to tax the value of bitcoins received from mining under the head \u201cIncome from other sources\u201d\n\n\n\nScenario B: Bitcoins held as an investment being transferred in exchange for real currency\n\nIf bitcoins, which are capital assets, have been held as an investment and are transferred in exchange for real currency, the appreciation in value would give rise to a long term capital gain or a short term capital gain depending on the period of holding of the bitcoin.\n\nFurther, long term gains would be taxed at a flat rate of 20% while short term gains would be taxed at the individual slab rate. The cost of acquisition for arriving at long term capital gains will be determined after giving the benefit of indexation. A simple example is given below to understand this :\n\n\n\nParticulars Value in INR (Only hypothetical) No. of bitcoins purchased\n\n10 INR equivalent of 1 bitcoin at the time of purchase\n\n2.72 Value of bitcoins (A)\n\n27.2 INR equivalent of 1 bitcoin on the date of transfer\n\n8.72 Value of bitcoins (B)\n\n87.2 Capital gains (B - A)\n\n60.00\n\nReiterating the probable contrary view of the income tax authorities discussed under Point 1 above, the IT authorities may not consider Bitcoins as a capital asset and hence the provisions of capital gains would not apply.\n\nAccordingly, the income tax authorities may choose to tax the gains from bitcoins under the head \u201cIncome from other sources\u201d.\n\nFurther, if the income gets taxed under \u201cIncome from other sources\u201d, the taxpayer would have to pay taxes at a rate as applicable to the tax slab he falls under.\n\nFor eg, if his taxable income exceeds Rs 10 lakh, he would be liable to a tax @ 30% as against the flat rate of tax of 20% he would be liable to pay if charged to tax under long-term capital gains. The benefit of indexation as would be available if taxed under capital gains, would also not be available if taxed under Income from other sources.\n\n\n\nScenario C: Bitcoins held as stock-in-trade being transferred in exchange for real currency\n\nThe income arising out of bitcoins trading activity would give rise to income from business and accordingly, the profits arising out of such business would be subject to tax as per the individual slab rates.\n\n\n\nScenario D: Bitcoins being received as consideration on sale of goods and services\n\nBitcoins being received so shall be treated on par with receipt of money. It would constitute income in the hands of the recipient. Further, since the recipient received this income out of a business or profession, he would be taxed, normally, under the head profits or gains from business or profession.\n\nAs regards the disclosure requirement of bitcoins in the income tax return forms, there continues to be a lack of clarity. In the budget 2018, our Finance Minister, Mr Arun Jaitley, has stated in the budget speech, \u201c112. Distributed ledger system or the blockchain technology allows the organisation of any chain of records or transactions without the need for intermediaries. The Government does not consider crypto-currencies legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate use of these crypto assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system. The Government will explore use of blockchain technology proactively for ushering in digital economy.\u201dFurther, the Central Bank also has chosen to reinforce its earlier message to \u201cusers, holders and traders of Virtual Currencies (\u201cVCs\u201d) including bitcoins regarding the potential economic, financial, operational, legal, customer protection and security related risks associated in dealing with such VCs.\u201d\n\nTherefore, considering that bitcoin transactions are gradually picking up in India, while, laws regulating them are significantly absent, we are hopeful that the government will come up with a notification soon to dispel the ambiguity around the legality of bitcoins, their taxability and disclosure requirement of bitcoins.\n\nWhile this article aims at discussing the taxability of Bitcoins only, the tax treatment on transacting with other cryptocurrencies would also be similar to that in the case of Bitcoins.\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nYou Might be Interested in"

        "title": "Top Canadian Bitcoin ETFs - The Motley Fool Canada",
        "content": "When it comes to buying cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Canadian investors usually resort to cryptocurrency exchanges. From there, investors can either hold Bitcoin online in their \u201chot wallet\u201d for easy access or transfer it offline to a \u201ccold wallet\u201d for greater security.1\n\nHowever, this approach cannot be implemented in a TFSA or RRSP as Bitcoin is not considered a \u201cqualified investment\u201d when it comes to the Income Tax Act.2 A potential way to get around this constraint and the need for self-custody of Bitcoin is via a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nBitcoin ETFs are a relatively new type of investment product that debuted in Canada in 2021. These crypto funds provide investors with exposure to Bitcoin while ensuring a high degree of transparency and liquidity via the ETF structure. Here\u2019s all you need to know before you buy your first Bitcoin ETF.\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin ETF?\n\nA Bitcoin ETF works the same as any other ETF, by holding an underlying portfolio of assets in its basket and creating shares which trade on stock exchanges under their own ticker symbol. Unlike Bitcoin, Bitcoin ETFs can be bought and sold via most brokerages.\n\nHow does buying a Bitcoin ETF work?\n\nWhen you buy shares of a Bitcoin ETF, the ETF provider will use your investment to purchase Bitcoin from a cryptocurrency market maker. From there, the ETF provider will store that Bitcoin in secure, offline cold storage to keep it safe.\n\nThe Bitcoin ETF shares you purchase will represent holdings in a specific amount of Bitcoin. Thus, when the price of Bitcoin moves, the price of your Bitcoin ETF shares will as well. Over time, this will help the Bitcoin ETF track the returns of Bitcoin, minus any fees.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Bitcoin ETFs will charge ongoing fees, which include management fees, administrative, operational, and marketing expenses. Together, these comprise the ETF\u2019s management expense ratio, or MER. The MER is an annual percentage fee deducted from your investment. For example, investing $10,000 in a Bitcoin ETF with a 1.00% MER would result in around $100 in annual fees.\n\nFinally, Bitcoin ETFs can come in currency hedged or unhedged versions. Because the price of Bitcoin is tracked in U.S. dollars (USD) but Bitcoin ETFs trade in Canadian dollars (CAD), fluctuations in the USD/CAD exchange rate can add additional volatility.\n\nCurrency unhedged Bitcoin ETFs accept this. When the USD performs well, they gain extra value. When the CAD performs well, they lose extra value. Currency hedged ETFs attempt to mitigate this by using forward derivatives.\n\nTop Canadian Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe following Bitcoin ETFs are listed on Canadian exchanges and have some of the highest assets under management, or AUM.\n\nBitcoin ETF Inception date Highlights Purpose Bitcoin ETF (TSX:BTCC) 2021-02-25 First Bitcoin ETF in Canada. Holds actual Bitcoin in cold storage. 3iQ CoinShares Bitcoin ETF (TSX:BTCQ) 2021-03-21 Tracks the U.S. dollar price of Bitcoin via actual Bitcoin in cold storage. CI Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (TSX:BTCX.B) 2001-03-05 Tracks the U.S. dollar price of Bitcoin via actual Bitcoin in cold storage.\n\nPurpose Bitcoin ETF (TSX:BTCC)\n\nBTCC was the first Bitcoin ETF launched in the world and is one of the most popular. The ETF holds actual Bitcoin in offline cold storage with its cryptocurrency custodian Gemini Trust Company and is currency hedged. BTCC also comes in currency unhedged (BTCC.B), U.S. dollar (BTCC.U), and carbon offset (BTCC.J) versions.\n\n3iQ CoinShares Bitcoin ETF (TSX:BTCQ)\n\nBTCQ tracks the daily price of Bitcoin in U.S. dollars via actual Bitcoin held in trust with custodian Tetra Trust Company, with Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC acting as a sub-custodian. The ETF is managed by 3iQ and CoinShares, which are large digital asset fund managers in Canada and Europe, respectively. The ETF also comes in a USD-denominated version (BTCQ.U).\n\nCI Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (TSX:BTCX.B)\n\nOne of the lowest-priced Bitcoin ETFs on the Canadian market today is BTCX.B. Otherwise, the ETF functions similar to the previous options by holding actual Bitcoin in offline cold storage with its custodian. This ETF is offered by CI, but staffed with a management team from Galaxy Digital Capital Management LP, one of Canada\u2019s larger digital asset managers. The ETF also comes in a USD-denominated version (BTCX.U).\n\nHow to buy Bitcoin ETFs in Canada\n\nThe process of how to buy Bitcoin ETFs mirrors the steps outlined in our guide on how to buy ETFs in Canada, but with a few additional considerations to keep in mind:\n\nExotic ETFs : Some Bitcoin ETFs use derivatives to gain enhanced exposure. These include covered call Bitcoin ETFs, which deliver high yields; and inverse Bitcoin ETFs, which provide the daily opposite return of Bitcoin. These ETFs can be quite complex and risky, so ensure you do your research before buying one.\n\n: Some Bitcoin ETFs use derivatives to gain enhanced exposure.

Therefore, investors should avoid using market orders and instead place limit orders to avoid locking in a poor unanticipated sell or buy price. Redemption: Most Bitcoin ETFs cannot be redeemed for actual Bitcoin. They can only be sold on their own for a capital gain or loss.\n\nAre cryptocurrency ETFs a good investment?\n\nBitcoin ETFs are a risky and speculative investment. Historically, they have been capable of strong gains, but also deep losses. This is because the underlying Bitcoin is highly volatile. Investors who buy Bitcoin ETFs must deal with not only market risk, but also the risk that specific technological or regulatory developments will negatively impact Bitcoin.\n\nIn addition, the MERs charged by these ETFs tend to be many magnitudes higher than regular index ETFs. Over time, the high fees can compound and eat into long-term returns. In contrast, holding Bitcoin in a hot or cold wallet does not incur fees outside of trading commissions and bid-ask spreads. In addition, a Bitcoin ETF does not provide true ownership of the underlying Bitcoin4.\n\nHowever, if you aren\u2019t comfortable with self-custody of Bitcoin or want to hold it in a tax-advantaged account, then a Bitcoin ETF could be a viable alternative to actual Bitcoin. These ETFs are transparent and tightly regulated, publish their holdings frequently, and are subject to strict reporting requirements. If you have a high-risk tolerance and don\u2019t mind a speculative asset, then a Bitcoin ETF might be right for you."

However, investors are seeking to invest in Bitcoin as an investment avenue. We have covered the following in this article:\n\nWhat Exactly are Bitcoins?\n\nBitcoins are the most popular crypto or virtual currency. Bitcoins are a currency similar to any other currency but just that they don\u2019t have any physical form. They are in use since the year 2009. Bitcoins are the pioneer of the decentralised digital currency in the world. No government or regulatory body oversees the circulation of the currency.\n\nHow to Invest in Bitcoins in India?\n\nYou can purchase Bitcoins in India through various online Bitcoin exchanges. You may also see some platforms that allow peer to peer Bitcoin transfer. However, it is advisable to purchase Bitcoins only through Bitcoin exchanges in order to avoid the chances of losing your money.\n\n\n\nBefore you could invest in Bitcoins, you are required to under KYC (know your customer) verification. You have to provide your PAN card, valid address proof and photographs in the prescribed format to complete the process. You may undergo your KYC verification before or after opening a trading account with a Bitcoin exchange.\n\nLegal Status of Bitcoins in India\n\nThere are several questions over the legal status of Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies in India. In 2018, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) restricted commercial banks from facilitating Bitcoin transactions in the country. This was a major jolt to the industry.\n\n\n\nHowever, this order of RBI was rebuked by the apex court in 2020. This gave the crypto exchanges much-needed relief as they could restart their business. One thing to note here is that it was never illegal to hold or transact in Bitcoins in India.\n\nHow Much Can You Invest in Bitcoin?\n\nAs of the 19th of March 2021, the price of one Bitcoin stands at a massive $58,497.30. However, you are allowed to buy partial Bitcoins. Therefore, you need not arrange for a sum touching nearly $60,000 to get started with investing in Bitcoins. You can invest even a sum as low as Rs 100.\n\nConclusion\n\nDespite the fact that investing or trading Bitcoins in India is not illegal, there are not many takers. Investors are still sceptical about the associated risks, and the warning issued by RBI and the government have only added to the woes of Bitcoin exchanges in India.\n\n"

        "title": "Cryptocurrency and FTX, 6 Months On | Financial Services | Bitcoin - Freeths",
        "content": "Never a stranger to volatility, cryptocurrency has seen a number of ups and downs over the years since its inception back in 2009. The last year, however, has been a particularly eventful one.\n\nMay 2023 marked six months following the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX. This proved to be a watershed moment for the industry and which has had substantial implications for both crypto firms and consumers, and has resulted in increased in scrutiny from governments and regulators.\n\nWe have set out below a recap of what happened to FTX, why this occurrence was so significant and what has happened in the crypto world in the six months since.\n\n2022 \u2013 A recap\n\nIn the early months of 2022, there was plenty to be positive about in the crypto world, particularly within the UK. April 2022 saw the end of the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s Temporary Registration Regime, and the full implementation of the legal requirement for all new and existing cryptoasset businesses to register with the FCA for the purposes of anti-money laundering rules before being able to operate. This concluded a two-year implementation process, and was one of the first key steps towards introducing a regulatory framework for crypto, and helped drive efforts to move it away from its perception as a tool for crime and money laundering.\n\nA more significant political development also came in April 2022 with the announcement of the UK government\u2019s plans to make the country a \u201cglobal hub for cryptoasset technology and investment.\u201d These plans were spearheaded by then-Chancellor Rishi Sunak, and comprised an initial package of plans including the planned use of stablecoins as a recognised form of payment, and opened up a call for evidence regarding the use of distributed ledger technology in financial markets. The announcement also included plans for the government to work with the Royal Mail to create its very own non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Sunak\u2019s subsequent elevation to the role of Prime Minister later in the year only served to bolster confidence in these pledges.\n\nIn terms of the markets, summer 2022 saw ongoing fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin \u2013 itself the largest and arguably the most well-known cryptocurrency \u2013 which were indicative of gradual market re-balancing following volatility which had been seen over the year prior.\n\nOn the tech front, progress was made in September 2022 when the Ethereum network successfully migrated its operating systems from a \u2018proof of work\u2019 system to \u2018proof of stake\u2019. This was expected to significantly cut down the amount of work and energy required to enable the network to operate and for transaction validations to occur, which has long been a source of criticism for cryptocurrencies.\n\nDespite this buzz of activity, crypto had its \u201cBlack Friday\u201d moment in November 2022, with the much-publicised collapse of FTX, which looked to undo much of the positivity that had been generated over the course of the year.\n\nWhat was FTX?\n\nFTX (short for \u201cFutures Exchange\u201d) was a Bahamas-based company led by CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, which operated as an exchange for cryptocurrencies and other digital assets.\n\nCrypto exchanges are intended to allow users and investors to store their digital assets online, and allows users to swap, buy, sell, and exchange cryptocurrencies. In practical terms, crypto exchanges operate in a similar way to a traditional exchange platform and can also resemble a type of banking service, and there are a number of potential benefits to customers in using an exchange. They can allow users easy access without the need for self-storage and the risk of the user losing their own wallets or the \u201ckeys\u201d necessary to access these. They also facilitate and enable the purchase and sale of crypto assets, and so can be particularly attractive to investors who are often looking to buy and sell quickly.\n\nLike a bank, however, crypto exchanges are also businesses in their own right and aim to make profits from the services they provide. Crypto exchanges are also susceptible to market pressures and liquidity shortages. In the case of FTX, market speculation arose following a mass-sale of the cryptocurrency FTT (FTX\u2019s own native token), resulting in a classic bank run situation, with customers seeking to withdraw their cryptoassets from the exchange. FTX proved unable to fulfil the volume of customer withdrawal demands, and it quickly ceased processing withdrawals altogether. Shortly afterwards, Bankman-Fried resigned his position and administrators took control of the company\u2019s affairs and conducted an initial investigation into the state of business. The subsequent Bankruptcy filings made for sobering reading. These indicated that the total assets held could not be readily identified by the administrators, though were believed to be worth billions. As for the operation of the business itself, the administrator\u2019s findings were stark:\n\n\u201cMany of the companies in the FTX Group, especially those organized in Antigua and the Bahamas, did not have appropriate corporate governance. I understand that many entities, for example, never had board meetings\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThe FTX Group did not maintain centralized control of its cash. Cash management procedural failures included the absence of an accurate list of bank accounts and account signatories, as well as insufficient attention to the creditworthiness of banking partners around the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the Bahamas, I understand that corporate funds of the FTX Group were used to purchase homes and other personal items for employees and advisors\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Debtors did not have the type of disbursement controls that I believe are appropriate for a business enterprise. For example, employees of the FTX Group submitted payment requests through an on-line \u2018chat\u2019 platform where a disparate group of supervisors approved disbursements by responding with personalized emojis\u2026\u201d\n\nAlmost overnight, FTX went from being the third largest crypto exchange globally to being all but wiped out. Millions of customers were left unable to access their funds, with no indication as to when \u2013 if at all \u2013 they could expect to recover their funds. On the back of this, Bankman-Fried was arrested and charged in the US for various counts of fraud and other activities, with a trial expected to take place in late 2023.\n\nThe impact of FTX\n\nIt is hard to understate the significance of the FTX collapse on the cryptocurrency industry. Some may ask how the failure of a single business can have such a significant impact on an industry in the way FTX has.\n\nThe answer to this perhaps lies in the fact that cryptocurrency remains a relatively new and emerging technology, with public knowledge and understanding being relatively limited, meaning that overall confidence and trust in the technology is not yet established. Furthermore, whilst there are a significant number of cryptocurrencies and business operating within the industry, public knowledge is typically limited to just a small number of these entities, which gives those particular businesses and assets a large amount of power within the industry. So, when one of these key market players fail, this alone can be significant in shaping opinions. Cryptocurrency also has an ongoing battle in fighting against a reputation as being a tool mainly used for illegal purposes, and so the initial findings published about the management of FTX inevitably adds fuel to this fire.\n\nIt is important to note at this stage that cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency exchanges are not one and the same \u2013 an exchange is an institution designed to enable the storage and exchange of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. It is not of itself an asset, although may issue its own forms of currency and digital tokens. In practical terms, however, the two are often grouped together within a wider concept of \u2018crypto\u2019, and so the failure of an exchange may often be perceived as an indictment of cryptocurrencies themselves.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the FTX collapse, other crypto exchanges began damage-control exercises to try and reassure their customers and re-establish market confidence. Some exchanges went to the extent of publishing their own accounts and proof of reserves, in order to convince customers that their assets were safe.\n\nThe fallout from FTX unsurprisingly caught the eye of governments and regulators. Less than two weeks following the collapse, the Deputy Governor for Financial Stability at the Bank of England, Sir Jon Cunliffe, publicly spoke about FTX and the problems with cryptocurrencies as he saw them:\n\n\u201c\u2018Crypto\u2019 was born in unregulated space: indeed, part of the objectives of its early developers was to create a financial system outside regulation. While not yet of systemic scale, the crypto ecosystem has grown very rapidly in recent years and broadened to encompass a range of financial services.\n\nMoreover, it is not clear to what extent to which these platforms are truly decentralised. Behind these protocols typically sit firms and stakeholders who derive revenue from their operations. Moreover it is often unclear who, in practice, controls the governance of the protocols.\n\nMore generally, as with driverless cars, they are only as good as the rules, programmes and sensors which organise their operations.\u201d\n\nCritically, he also indicated that whilst the failure of a crypto exchange such as FTX was not presently enough to threaten wider financial markets, he did not wish to see a situation where such a scenario could happen, and so expressed support for an effective and robust regulatory framework for crypto.\n\nAs the year drew to a close, it seemed that fortunes had taken a significant downturn for cryptocurrency. The positivity surrounding the industry from earlier in the year and the UK\u2019s plan to build a \u201cglobal hub\u201d was in significant doubt.\n\n2023 onwards\n\nAs the dust has begun to settle following the events of FTX, 2023 has seen a number of developments take place which suggest crypto is on a gradual \u2013 if unsteady \u2013 road to recovery.\n\nFebruary 2023\n\nAt the start of February, the UK Government released the details of its plans to formally regulate cryptocurrency and digital assets, declaring \u201cwe remain steadfast in our commitment to grow the economy and enable technological change and innovation \u2013 and this includes cryptoasset technology.\u201d\n\nAs part of the announcement, the government opened up a public consultation and call for evidence in respect of its plans, which include proposals to categorise the acts of arranging and advising on crypto investments as regulated activities for the purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Act (Regulated Activities) Order 2001, as well as bringing the marketing of cryptoassets and associated investments into the remit of the existing regulations on financial promotions.\n\nThe re-pledging of commitment towards cryptoassets was a welcome move for the industry, which had been left in a state of uncertainty following the FTX collapse and the criticisms raised by regulators in the aftermath.\n\nMarch 2023\n\nAs the public consultation for crypto regulation began, the FCA remained diligent in monitoring potentially illegal crypto activity, and issued details of recent crackdown operations it had overseen across the country in conjunction with the Metropolitan Police in respect of \u201cCrypto ATMs\u201d, which are machines allowing people to acquire crypto assets by depositing cash. The FCA has issued reminders that, at the time of writing, no businesses were registered or authorised to operate such machines.\n\nThis same month saw another significant development which may have inadvertently served to bolster crypto\u2019s fortunes. This was the collapse of the US-based Silicon Valley Bank (\u201cSVB\u201d). This was a bank which had typically focused on the technology sector, but which faced growing market uncertainty owing to various concerns about its investment strategy and liquidity, which culminated in another \u2018bank run\u2019 situation with customers seeking to withdraw their funds en masse, which the bank struggled to fulfil. UK customers were luckily safeguarded following action by the FCA which oversaw and approved the purchase of the bank\u2019s UK arm by HSBC. This prevented the need for any government bailouts, and helped to ensure UK customers were able to go about business as normal.\n\nNonetheless, the situation with SVB often looked to be comparable to what had been seen with FTX mere months earlier. This served as a reminder that even traditional financial institutions such as banks are not immune to financial pressures and can ultimately fail, resulting in potentially significant impacts on consumers. It showed that the issues which were seen with FTX were perhaps not down to any inherent risks or failures of cryptocurrency itself.\n\nMay 2023\n\nOn 17 May, the UK\u2019s Treasury Committee released a report setting outs its analysis of the crypto-asset industry and its views as to how future regulation should work. Whilst the Committee welcomed the government\u2019s proposals from earlier in the year for regulating the industry, it also made it clear that it considered unbacked cryptoassets such as Bitcoin to have no intrinsic value and serve \u201cno useful social purpose\u201d. It further expressed concerns that if the government regulated cryptoassets as a form of financial service, this risked giving consumers a false sense of security about the assets and could lead them to believe investments are safer than they are.\n\nThe Committee summarised its findings by saying it must \u201cstrongly recommend that the Government regulates retail trading and investment activity in unbacked cryptoassets as gambling rather than as a financial service.\u201d\n\nIn response, the trade association, CryptoUK, published a statement saying that it \u201cstrongly disagreed\u201d with the Committee\u2019s findings and considered them \u201cunhelpful, false, fundamentally flawed and unsubstantiated\u201d as a whole, and that it failed to \u201creflect the true nature, purpose and potential of the crypto industry\u201d. It did, however, confirm its willingness to work with and support the government\u2019s moves towards regulation and to engage with the FCA and Treasury to work to find solutions to some of the problems presented. These statements perhaps signify a potential for greater collaboration and communication between the industry and regulators in the future.\n\nJune 2023\n\nAt the start of June, the UK\u2019s All-Party Parliamentary Group for Crypto and Digital Assets issued its initial report following its inquiry into the topic of crypto regulation, which contained details of the submissions it had heard during the course of its investigations, along with making a series of recommendations for policymakers. In a stark contrast to the Treasury Committee\u2019s report from the previous month, this latest report talked about the practical benefits of crypto and made particular reference to how cryptocurrencies had been used by Ukranians to allow them to continue to buy goods and services even after infrastructures and ATMs were damaged due to the ongoing conflict. The report went on to talk about how the Government should aim to \u201charness the significant opportunities\u201d for economic growth arising from crypto, and emphasised the need to ensure regulators were given sufficient resources and skills to be able to properly understand the industry and to effectively regulate it.\n\nConclusions\n\nAs the events of the past year have shown, cryptocurrency remains incredibly unpredictable and it is in often hard to predict from one month to the next what developments will be seen.\n\n2022 was, in many respects, a positive year for the industry, particularly within the UK, thanks to the government\u2019s declarations of its ambitions for the use of digital assets. Whilst, it cannot be denied that the failure of FTX also caused the industry and its reputation to suffer significant damage, it does seem that this was also one of the key moments which served to spur governments and regulators to really move forward with their plans for regulation and the introduction of a proper legal framework for the industry, which can only prove beneficial in the long run and help the industry move it away from its \u201cWild West\u201d image.\n\nOverall, from the events of 2023 it does appear that crypto is on a gradual road to recovery following the events of FTX, and the UK in particular is clearly driving towards bringing about a full and robust regulatory framework for these assets. Whilst there will inevitably be further challenges on the way, the moves towards a proper regulatory framework may go a significant way to showing that crypto is here to stay and that the industry can learn the lessons it needs to from FTX, and allow cryptocurrency to continue to innovate and challenge financial norms in a way which will support individuals and investors alike.\n\nOur Financial Services team have expertise in Cryptocurrency and FTX, click through to find out how we can help your business.\n\nThe content of this page is a summary of the law in force at the date of publication and is not exhaustive, nor does it contain definitive advice.
