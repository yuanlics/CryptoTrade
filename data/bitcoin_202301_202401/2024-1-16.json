        "title": "How a 27-Year-Old Codebreaker Busted the Myth of Bitcoin's Anonymity - WIRED",
        "content": "When Meiklejohn started college at Brown in 2004, she discovered cryptography. This branch of computer science appealed directly to her puzzle addiction\u2014what was an encryption system, after all, but another secret language demanding to be deciphered?\n\nThere was a maxim in cryptography, often referred to as Schneier\u2019s law after the cryptographer Bruce Schneier. It asserted that anyone can develop an encryption system clever enough that they can\u2019t themselves think of a way to break it. Yet, like all the best conundrums and mysteries that had fascinated Meiklejohn since childhood, another person with a different way of approaching a cipher could look at that \u201cunbreakable\u201d system and see a way to crack it and unspool a whole world of decrypted revelations.\n\nStudying the science of ciphers, Meiklejohn began to recognize the importance of privacy and the need for surveillance-resistant communications. She was not quite a cypherpunk: The intellectual appeal of building and breaking codes drove her more than any ideological drive to defeat surveillance. But like many cryptographers, she nonetheless came to believe in the need for truly unbreakable encryption, technologies that could carve out a space for sensitive communications\u2014whether dissidents organizing against a repressive government or whistleblowers sharing secrets with journalists\u2014where no snoop could reach. She credited her intuitive acceptance of that principle to her years as a teenager who kept to herself, trying to maintain her own privacy in a Manhattan apartment, with a federal prosecutor for a mother.\n\nMeiklejohn showed real talent as a cryptographer and soon became an undergraduate teaching assistant to Anna Lysyanskaya, a brilliant and highly accomplished computer scientist. Lysyanskaya had herself studied under the legendary Ron Rivest, whose name was represented by the R in the RSA algorithm that formed the basis for most modern encryption, used everywhere from web browsers to encrypted email to instant messaging protocols. RSA was one of the few fundamental encryption protocols that had not succumbed to Schneier\u2019s law in more than 30 years.\n\nLysyanskaya was at the time working on a pre-Bitcoin cryptocurrency called eCash, first developed in the 1990s by David Chaum, a cryptographer whose groundbreaking work on anonymity systems had made possible technologies from VPNs to Tor. After finishing her undergraduate degree, Meiklejohn began a master\u2019s degree at Brown under Lysyanskaya\u2019s wing, researching methods to make Chaum\u2019s eCash, a truly anonymous payment system, more scalable and efficient.\n\nThe cryptocurrency scheme they were laboring to optimize was, Meiklejohn admits in hindsight, difficult to imagine working in practice. Unlike Bitcoin, it had a serious problem: An anonymous spender of eCash could essentially forge a coin and pass it off to an unsuspecting recipient. When that recipient deposited the coin at a kind of eCash bank, the bank could perform a check that would reveal the coin to be a forgery and the fraudster\u2019s anonymity protections could be stripped away to reveal the identity of the bad actor. But by then, the fraudster might have already run off with their ill-gotten goods.\n\nStill, eCash had a unique advantage that made it a fascinating system to work on: The anonymity it offered was truly uncrackable. In fact, eCash was based on a mathematical technique called zero-knowledge proofs, which could establish the validity of a payment without the bank or recipient learning anything else at all about the spender or their money. That mathematical sleight of hand meant that eCash was provably secure. Schneier\u2019s law did not apply: No amount of cleverness or computing power would ever be able to undo its anonymity.\n\n\u201cYou could never prove anything about the privacy properties of this system,\u201d Meiklejohn remembers thinking. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get privacy, what do you get?\u201d\n\nWhen Meiklejohn first heard about Bitcoin in 2011, she had started her PhD studies at UCSD but was spending the summer as a researcher at Microsoft. A friend at the University of Washington had mentioned to her that there was a new digital payment system that people were using to buy drugs on sites like the Silk Road. Meiklejohn had moved on from her eCash studies by then; she was busy with other research\u2014systems that would allow people to pay road tolls without revealing their personal movements, for instance, and a thermal camera technique that revealed PIN codes typed into an ATM by looking for heat remnants on the keypad. So, with heads-down focus, she filed Bitcoin\u2019s existence away in her brain, barely considering it again for the next year.\n\nThen, one day on a UCSD computer science department group hike in late 2012, a young UCSD research scientist named Kirill Levchenko suggested to Meiklejohn that perhaps they should start looking into this burgeoning Bitcoin phenomenon. Levchenko was fascinated, he explained as they trekked around the jagged landscape of the Anza Borrego Desert State Park, by Bitcoin\u2019s unique proof-of-work system. That system demanded that anyone who wanted to mine the currency expend enormous computing resources performing calculations\u2014 essentially a vast, automated puzzle-solving competition\u2014whose results were then copied into transactions on the blockchain. By then, ambitious bitcoiners were already developing custom mining microprocessors just for generating this strange new form of money, and Bitcoin\u2019s ingenious system meant that any single bad actor who might want to write a false transaction into the blockchain would have to use a collection of computers that possessed more computational power than all those many thousands of miners. It was a brilliant approach that added up to a secure currency with no central authority."

        "title": "New bitcoin ETFs are a 'key milestone,' says investing expert\u2014what they mean for your money - CNBC",
        "content": "As of Thursday, the Securities and Exchange Commission has approved a batch of 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds for trading in the U.S. Cryptocurrency investors had been eagerly awaiting this moment. In anticipation of the ruling, traders bid up the price of bitcoin 155% in calendar year 2023, to more than $42,000. On the first day of trading, $4.6 billion worth of shares of the new ETFs changed hands, according to investing research firm CFRA. \"This is a key milestone in the ETF industry,\" says Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFI. \"For a generation of investors who have been embracing ETFs as their go-to investment vehicle, this opens the door for them to get exposure to this emerging asset class.\" In other words, these funds are a big deal. Here's why, and what you should know about them.\n\nBitcoin ETFs aren't new, but these are different\n\nIf you thought you'd seen a bitcoin ETF before Thursday's announcement, you're right \u2014 kind of. The previous generation of ETFs were designed to track the price of bitcoin by holding bitcoin derivatives. In general, the managers of these ETFs continuously bought and sold bitcoin futures contracts to try to replicate movements in bitcoin's value. This imperfect process often resulted in investment returns that didn't accurately track fluctuations in bitcoin's price. \"It was a broken product that never really worked,\" says Stephane Ouellette, founder and CEO of FRNT Financial. \"Buying bitcoin products in most retail accounts was very difficult.\" The new slate of ETFs clears up that problem. So-called spot ETFs track the price of bitcoin by actually owning bitcoin. \"It's perhaps a cleaner way of getting exposure to the asset,\" Rosenbluth says.\n\nETFs are a convenient way to get crypto exposure\n\nUnlike many popular ETFs, which track the performance of a diverse array of investments, the new bitcoin funds track one thing: the price of bitcoin. Which raises the question: Why not just own bitcoin? The answer, for many retail investors, will be convenience. Bitcoin ETFs can be purchased directly through your brokerage account and can live on your portfolio dashboard right next to all of your other investments. \"The investor that's likely to find this appealing is the one who has already bought other ETFs, whether it's tied to the S&P 500 or emerging markets or bonds or what have you,\" says Rosenbluth. \"This is going to work just like any other ETF of yours. You buy and sell it on the market during trading hours, you get exposure to the underlying investment and you can sell whatever it is you want in a tax-efficient way.\" One drawback of owning an ETF rather than owning bitcoin directly in a separate account is that an ETF charges an annual management fee. Expense ratios on the 11 new funds range from 0.2% of your assets in the fund to 1.5%, though several firms are temporarily waiving or lowering their fees to get customers in the door. Notably, some popular crypto exchanges, such as Coinbase, charge investors fees for trading bitcoin and other digital currencies.\n\nMore ETFs are likely coming"

        "title": "What is Bitcoin? Bitcoin Explained for Beginners (Updated 2024) - 99Bitcoins",
        "content": "What is Bitcoin? A Complete Beginner\u2019s Guide\n\nBy: Ofir Beigel | Last updated: 1/16/24\n\nWant to know all there is to know about Bitcoin? Here at 99Bitcoins, we translate Bitcoin into plain English, so even if you have no technical background, you\u2019ll be able to understand everything!\n\nIn today\u2019s post, I\u2019m going to give you a simple, plain English explanation about what Bitcoin is and why it\u2019s so revolutionary.\n\nDon\u2019t like to read? Watch our video guide instead!\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Summary\n\nBitcoin is the first decentralized digital currency. All Bitcoin transactions are documented on a virtual ledger called the blockchain, which is accessible for everyone to see. Bitcoin gives you complete control over your money, unlike other assets you own, which are regulated by banks and governments. As Bitcoin gains more popularity, more and more places accept it as a payment method.\n\nIf you want a more detailed explanation of Bitcoin, keep on reading. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll cover:\n\n1. What is Money?\n\nBefore we talk about Bitcoin, I need to take a moment and talk about money. What is money exactly?\n\nAt its core, money represents value. If I do some work for you, you give me money in exchange for the value I gave you. I can then use that money to get something of value from someone else in the future.\n\nThroughout history, value has taken many forms, and people used a lot of different materials to represent money. Salt, wheat, shells, and, of course, gold have all been used as a medium of exchange.\n\nHowever, in order for something to represent value, people have to trust that it is indeed valuable and will stay valuable long enough for them to redeem that value in the future.\n\nPaper Money\n\nUp until a hundred years ago or so, we always trusted in someTHING to represent money. However, something happened along the way, and we\u2019ve changed our trust model from trusting someTHING to trusting in someONE.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nOver time, people found it too cumbersome to walk around the world carrying bars of gold or other forms of money, so paper money was invented.\n\nHere\u2019s how it worked: a bank or government would offer to take possession of your bar of gold, let\u2019s say, worth $1,000, and in return, that bank would give you receipt certificates, which we call bills, amounting to $1,000.\n\nNot only were these pieces of paper much easier to carry, but you could spend a dollar on a cup of coffee and not have to cut your gold bar into a thousand pieces. And if you wanted your gold back, you simply took $1,000 in bills back to the bank to redeem them for the actual form of money, in this case, that gold bar, whenever you needed\u2026\n\nAnd so, paper began its use as money as an instrument of practicality and convenience.\n\nHowever, as time progressed, and due to macroeconomic changes, this bond between the paper receipt and the gold it stands for was broken.\n\nNow, the path that led us away from the gold standard is extremely complex, but suffice it to say that governments told their people that the government itself would be liable for the value of that paper money. Basically, we all said, \u201cLet\u2019s just forget about gold and trade paper instead.\u201d\n\nSo, people continued to trade with receipts that were backed by nothing but the government\u2019s promise.\n\nAnd why did it continue to work? Well, because of trust. Even though there is no actual commodity backing paper money, people trusted the government, and that\u2019s how fiat money was created.\n\nFiat Money\n\nFiat is a Latin word that means \u201cby decree.\u201d This means that the dollars, or euros or any other currency for that matter, have value because the government orders it to. It\u2019s what is known as \u201clegal tender\u201d \u2013 coins or banknotes that must be accepted if offered as payment.\n\nSo, the value of today\u2019s money actually comes from a legal status given to it by a central authority, in this case, the government. And so the trust model has changed, from trusting someTHING to trusting someONE (in this case, the government).\n\nFiat money has two main drawbacks:\n\nIt is centralized \u2013 You have a central authority that controls and issues it. In this case, the government or central bank. It is not limited by quantity \u2013 The government or central bank can print as much as they want whenever needed and inflate the money supply on the market. The problem with printing money is that because you\u2019re flooding the market with more money, the value of each dollar drops, so your own money is worth less. When you see prices rising throughout the years, it\u2019s not necessarily that prices are rising as much as the purchasing power of your money is dropping. You need more dollars to buy something that used to \u201ccost less.\u201d\n\n2. Transitioning to Digital Money\n\nOnce fiat money was in place, the move to digital money was pretty simple. We already have a central authority that issues money, so why not make money mostly digital and let that authority keep track of who owns what?\n\nToday, we mainly use credit cards, wire transfers, PayPal, and other forms of digital money. The amount of physical money in the world is almost negligible and is getting smaller with each year that passes.\n\nSo, if money today is digital, how does that even work? I mean, if I have a file that represents a dollar, what\u2019s to stop me from copying it a million times and having a million dollars? This is called the \u201cdouble spend problem.\u201d\n\nThe solution that banks use today is a \u201ccentralized\u201d solution \u2013 they keep a ledger on their computer, which keeps track of who owns what. Everyone has an account, and this ledger keeps a tally for each account. We all trust the bank, and the bank trusts their computer, so the solution is centralized on this ledger in this computer.\n\nYou may not know this, but there were many attempts to create alternative forms of digital currencies. However, none were successful in solving the double spending problem without a central authority.\n\n3. Centralized Money\n\nWhenever you give anyone control over the money supply, you\u2019re giving them enormous power, and this creates three major issues:\n\nCorruption\n\nPower corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. When banks have a mandate to create money or value, they basically control the flow of value in the world, which gives them almost unlimited power.\n\nA small example of how power corrupts can be seen in Wells Fargo\u2019s scandal, where employees secretly created millions of unauthorized bank and credit card accounts in order to inflate the bank\u2019s revenue stream without their customers knowing about it for years.\n\nMismanagement\n\nIf the central authority\u2019s interest isn\u2019t aligned with the people it controls, there may be a case of mismanagement of the money. For example, printing a lot of money in order to save a certain bank or institution from collapsing, as what happened in 2008.\n\nThe problem with printing too much money is that it causes inflation and basically erodes the value of the citizen\u2019s money.\n\nOne extreme example of this is Venezuela, where the government has printed so much money, and the value of it has dropped so much that people are no longer counting money but are weighing it instead.\n\nControl\n\nYou are basically giving away all control of your money to the government or bank. At any point in time, the government can decide to freeze your account and deny you access to your funds. Even if you use only cold hard cash, the government can cancel the legal status of your currency, as was done in India a few years back.\n\nThis was the state of things until 2009. Creating an alternative to the current monetary system seemed like a lost cause. But then everything changed\u2026\n\n4. What is Bitcoin?\n\nIn October 2008, a document was published online by someone calling themself Satoshi Nakamoto. The document, also called a whitepaper, suggested a way of creating a system for a decentralized currency called Bitcoin.\n\nThis system claimed to create digital money that solved the double spending problem without the need for a central authority.\n\nAt its core, Bitcoin is a transparent ledger without a central authority, but what does this confusing phrase even mean?\n\nWell, let\u2019s compare Bitcoin to the bank. Since most money today is already digital, the bank basically manages its own ledger of balances and transactions. However, the bank\u2019s ledger is not transparent, and it is stored on the bank\u2019s main computer. You can\u2019t sneak a peek into the bank\u2019s ledger, and only the bank has complete control over it.\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, is a transparent ledger. At any point in time, I can sneak a peek into the ledger and see all of the transactions and balances that are taking place. The only thing you can\u2019t figure out is who owns these balances and who is behind each transaction.\n\nThis means Bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous \u2013 everything is open, transparent, and trackable, but you still can\u2019t tell who is sending what to whom.\n\nLet\u2019s explain this with an example. Below, you can see certain rows from Bitcoin\u2019s ledger. We can see that a certain Bitcoin address sent 10,000 Bitcoins to another Bitcoin address in May of 2010.\n\nThis specific transaction is the first purchase that was ever made with Bitcoin, and it was used to buy two pizzas by a guy named Laszlo. Laszlo published a post back in 2010 asking for someone to sell him two pizzas in exchange for 10,000 Bitcoins. Well, someone did, and now the price of these two pizzas is worth well over 270 million dollars today.\n\nBitcoin is decentralized\n\nThere\u2019s no one computer that holds the ledger. With Bitcoin, every computer that participates in the system is also keeping a copy of the ledger, also known as the blockchain. So, if you want to take down the system or hack the ledger, you\u2019ll have to take down thousands of computers that are keeping a copy of it and constantly updating it.\n\nBitcoin is digital\n\nThis means there\u2019s nothing physical that you can touch in Bitcoin. There are no actual coins; there are only rows of transactions and balances. When you \u201cown\u201d Bitcoin, it means you own the right to access a specific Bitcoin address record in the ledger and send funds from it to a different address.\n\nWhy is Bitcoin such big news?\n\nWell, for the first time since digital money came into existence, we now have an alternative to the current system. Bitcoin is a form of money that no government or bank can control.\n\nThink about the time before the internet and how centralized the flow of information was. Basically, if you wanted information, you could get it from a few major players like the New York Times, The Washington Post, and others like them.\n\nToday, thanks to the internet, information is decentralized, and you can communicate and consume knowledge from around the world with the click of a button. Bitcoin is the internet of money \u2013 it\u2019s offering a decentralized solution to money.\n\n5. Bitcoin Compared to Banks\n\nHere is why Bitcoin is different than the current banking system.\n\nComplete control over your money\n\nWith Bitcoin, you and you alone can access your funds (how you actually do this will be explained in a later video). No government or bank can decide to freeze your account or confiscate your holdings.\n\nCutting the middlemen\n\nThis means that in many cases, Bitcoin is cheaper to use than traditional wire transfers or money orders. Also, unlike fiat currencies, Bitcoin was designed to be digital by nature. This means you can add additional layers of programming on top of it and turn it into \u201csmart money,\u201d but more on that in later videos.\n\nFree for all\n\nBitcoin opens up digital commerce to over a billion people around the world who don\u2019t have access to the current banking system. These people are unbanked or underbanked because of where they live and where they were born.\n\nHowever, today, with a mobile phone and a click of a button, they can start trading using Bitcoin, no permission needed.\n\n6. Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWho accepts Bitcoin?\n\nToday, there are several merchants online and offline that accept Bitcoin. You can order a flight or book a hotel with Bitcoin if you like. There are even Bitcoin debit cards that allow you to pay at almost any store with your Bitcoin balance. However, the road toward acceptance by the majority of the public is still a long one.\n\nHow does Bitcoin work?\n\nIn a nutshell, Bitcoin works by updating a ledger of transactions (aka the blockchain). Each computer that participates in the Bitcoin network holds a copy of this ledger and verifies every transaction going through it.\n\nIt\u2019s like we\u2019re keeping tabs on each other, and each new transaction is announced to everyone so they can update their own copy of the ledger. If you want a detailed explanation with examples of how Bitcoin works under the hood, check out my post about Bitcoin mining.\n\nWhy does Bitcoin have value, and how is it determined?\n\nBitcoin has value simply because people are willing to trade money for it. This means somebody finds it valuable and decides to buy it from someone else. At that exact moment, Bitcoin gained value.\n\nWhenever people refer to Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cprice,\u201d they are actually referring to the price of the last trade conducted on a specific trading platform (e.g., Bitstamp, Binance, Coinbase).\n\nUnlike US dollars, for example, there is no single, global Bitcoin price that everyone follows. For instance, Bitcoin\u2019s price in certain countries can be different from its price in the US since the major exchanges in these countries include different trades.\n\nGenerally speaking, as more people want to buy Bitcoin (i.e., demand rises), then the value of Bitcoin rises.\n\nIf fewer people want to buy Bitcoin (i.e., demand falls), then they won\u2019t be willing to pay as much. In that case, Bitcoin\u2019s value will drop.\n\nCan Bitcoin be converted to cash?\n\nYes. Several sites like HodlHodl will allow you to find sellers of Bitcoin who accept cash. Additionally, there are Bitcoin ATMs that accept bills and dispense Bitcoin in return.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to convert Bitcoin to fiat currency but not necessarily cash (i.e., coins and bills), you can find a variety of trustworthy Bitcoin exchanges online.\n\nHow do I purchase Bitcoin?\n\nGet a Bitcoin wallet Find a Bitcoin exchange Sign up and verify your identity Deposit money to the exchange Trade your funds for Bitcoin Withdraw the Bitcoin to your wallet\n\nThat\u2019s it! If you want a detailed guide about the process, check out my guide on buying Bitcoin.\n\n7. Conclusion\n\nCongratulations, you now know more about Bitcoin than 99% of the people around you! That wasn\u2019t so hard, was it? As you can see, above all, Bitcoin was designed with one thing in mind: To provide you with a secure and private way to gain back control over your money.\n\nIf you want to dig even deeper into how Bitcoin works, we have additional posts about Bitcoin mining, Bitcoin wallets, how to buy Bitcoin, and more. The revolution of money began in 2009, and these days, we are seeing it change money as we know it.\n\nIf you have any additional questions or comments, just leave them in the comment section below."

        "content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is done talking about Bitcoin\u2014again.\n\nIn a CNBC interview from Davos, a visibly amused Dimon declared he was swearing off opining about the crypto currency. When asked about the new Bitcoin ETF the Securities and Exchange Commission approved last week, Dimon interrupted CNBC host Andrew Ross Sorkin, also of The New York Times, to say:\n\n\u201cSo this is an important thing, this is the last time I\u2019m ever going to talk about this on CNBC\u2014so help me God,\u201d Dimon said to laughs from studio hosts Sorkin, Joe Kernen, and Becky Quick.\n\nThat sort of exasperation has become a Dimon staple when discussing Bitcoin. He\u2019s been saying he\u2019ll never talk about Bitcoin again since as far back as 2017.\n\nDimon continued his criticism of Bitcoin, saying \u201cit does nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI call it the pet rock,\u201d he said.\n\nDimon then corrected himself to say he did think Bitcoin did actually have some uses. They just all happened to be illegal such as money laundering, fraud, tax avoidance, or as payment for sex trafficking, he said.\n\nThere is evidence to support Dimon\u2019s claim. The Government Accountability Office found that 15 of the 27 online commercial sex websites it examined in a June 2021 report accepted digital currencies. While the U.N. issued warnings that cryptocurrency platforms are often used for money laundering by criminal groups in Southeast Asia.\n\nDespite these concerns, the market for cryptocurrencies has been exceptionally strong in recent years after a near-death experience during 2022\u2019s \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d In 2023, the market capitalization for the entire crypto industry grew 95%, although it\u2019s still down 35% from its all-time high during the pandemic. Also, the SEC\u2019s recent ETF approval is a signal that crypto is becoming a legitimate financial asset. And despite Dimon\u2019s objections to owning cryptocurrency himself, many retail investors do. A study from 2022 found that 36% of millennials and 20% of total adults own cryptocurrencies.\n\nDimon\u2019s history of Bitcoin talk\n\nOver the years, Dimon has been open about his dislike for cryptocurrencies, calling people who invest in Bitcoin \u201cstupid,\u201d and once threatening to fire any employee caught investing in it. Meanwhile, he called the asset itself a \u201chyped-up fraud\u201d and a \u201cwaste of time.\u201d At a Senate hearing in December, Dimon said if it were up to him he\u2019d \u201cclose it down,\u201d earning a surprised reaction from crypto hawk Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)\n\nOther major financial firms like BlackRock and Goldman Sachs had similar positions before changing their minds as crypto became more popular and lucrative. In 2020, Goldman Sachs published an analyst note explaining why it didn\u2019t consider Bitcoin an asset class that was widely shared in both Wall Street and crypto circles. And while its investment chief is still wary of Bitcoin, CEO David Solomon signaled Goldman Sachs would be interested in acquiring bargain crypto companies.\n\nWhen CNBC asked Dimon about companies that offer crypto products to their clients, he replied with the same dismissiveness he reserved for the asset itself.\n\n\u201cNumber one I don\u2019t care,\u201d he told Sorkin. \u201cSo just please stop talking about this shit.\u201d\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink was once in Dimon\u2019s camp as a staunch Bitcoin critic, concerned it had limited use beyond criminal activity. In 2017, Fink famously called Bitcoin the \u201cindex of money laundering\u201d and that the only it was good for was illustrating how much demand there was for that specific financial crime. Fink would eventually change his tune, though. By 2020, he believed it could grow into a global market. Fast forward to this month, when Bitcoin got the stamp of approval to become a spot ETF and BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, owns the third most Bitcoins of any public company.\n\nFellow asset manager Fidelity was early to embrace Bitcoin. It began mining the cryptocurrency in 2014, before launching its first trading platform in 2018. While BlackRock\u2019s other competitors, State Street and Vanguard, the world\u2019s second and third largest asset managers respectively, have opted to stay away from Bitcoin altogether.\n\n\u201cThe investment case for cryptocurrencies is weak,\u201d Vanguard told Bloomberg in December. \u201cUnlike stocks and bonds, most crypto assets lack intrinsic economic value and generate no cash flows.\n\nThat line of thinking was similar to Dimon\u2019s, who in his CNBC interview raised repeated concerns over Bitcoin\u2019s ultimate function\u2014aside from, as he said, aiding and abetting crime. Instead, Dimon sought to differentiate between Bitcoin and blockchain, the technology which allows Bitcoin to be traded without the approval of a centralized agency. Bitcoin\u2019s defenders tout the ability to trade the asset without having to rely on a bank or clearing authority as the core benefit that makes it unlike any other currency or asset. Blockchain, according to Dimon, was useful for exchanging assets or data. Although he thought even on that topic enough ink had been spilled.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very small,\u201d he said of blockchain. \u201cI think we\u2019ve wasted too many words on that.\u201d"

        "content": "DAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 Bitcoin does nothing, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Wednesday on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum.\n\n\"I call it the pet rock,\" he added.\n\nDimon is a long-time bitcoin critic. The bank chief said in 2021 at peak crypto valuations that bitcoin was \"worthless,\" and he doubled down on that sentiment last year in Davos, Switzerland, when he told CNBC that the digital currency was a \"hyped-up fraud.\"\n\nBitcoin is trading just above $42,700, up more than 100% in the past year.\n\n\"This is the last time I'm talking about this with CNBC, so help me God,\" Dimon said. \"Blockchain is real. It's a technology. We use it. It's going to move money, it's going to move data. It's efficient. We've been talking about that for 12 years, too, and it's very small.\"\n\n\"I think we waste too many words on that,\" Dimon added.\n\nThe bank chief went on to distinguish bitcoin from the other class of cryptocurrencies, the ones by which blockchain has enabled the use of smart contracts. Smart contracts are a programmable piece of code written on a public blockchain, such as ethereum , which executes when certain conditions are met, negating the need for a central intermediary.\n\n\"There's a cryptocurrency which might actually do something,\" Dimon said of smart chain-enriched blockchains. \"You can use it to buy and sell real estate and move data \u2014 tokenizing things that you do something with.\"\n\n\"And then there's one which does nothing,\" Dimon said of bitcoin, though he added that there were real use cases for the virtual coin, which included upward of $100 billion a year caught up in fraud, tax avoidance and sex trafficking. \"I defend your right to do bitcoin,\" Dimon added, saying, \"I don't want to tell you what to do. So my personal advice would be don't get involved. \u2026 But it's a free country.\"\n\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of more than $830 billion, was cemented as an asset class last week when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the creation of bitcoin exchange-traded funds.\n\nSome of the biggest names in asset management, including BlackRock , Franklin Templeton and WisdomTree, have launched their own spot bitcoin ETFs last week. For the $30 trillion advised wealth management industry, the floodgates could be about to open. Analysts at Standard Chartered anticipate fund inflows in the range of $50 billion to $100 billion in 2024.\n\nWhen asked what he made of Larry Fink changing his view on bitcoin as BlackRock jumped into the spot ETF business, Dimon said, \"I don't care. So just please stop talking about this s***.\"\n\n\"I don't know what he would say about blockchain versus currencies that do something versus bitcoin that does nothing,\" Dimon added. \"But you know this is what makes a market. People have opinions, and this is the last time I'm ever going to state my opinion.\""

        "content": "Print this page\n\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\n\nBitcoin exchange traded funds have pulled in just under $900mn in the first three days of trading, as investors cautiously welcome the new stock market vehicles that track the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe new funds, which include those from BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and Invesco, have had net inflows of $871mn, according to data from CoinShares, a digital asset manager.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, led the way with $723mn of inflows, followed by Fidelity with $545mn. The inflows were offset by $1.18bn of outflows at Grayscale, which converted its existing $28bn bitcoin fund into an ETF alongside the new launches.\n\nAnalysts believe the bulk of the outflows is likely to be investors moving to one of the new funds, which all charge lower fees than Grayscale. Excluding the outflows at Grayscale, the 10 new ETFs have drawn in just over $2bn.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts celebrated the approval of the funds by the US Securities and Exchange Commission last week after more than a decade of rejections. Supporters hope it will attract new investors to the token and boost its price in the long term.\n\nGrowing speculation that the SEC would approve so-called spot bitcoin ETFs had pushed the price of bitcoin up more than 70 per cent since October. However, bitcoin has fallen roughly 6 per cent since their approval.\n\n\u201cBy no means was this launch a mass success,\u201d said Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions. \u201cBitcoin\u2019s latest price action shows that this has so far been an underwhelming launch for products that were so highly anticipated.\u201d\n\nThe funds\u2019 collective performance also fell short of the $1bn that ProShares pulled in on its first two days after launching a bitcoin futures ETF in October 2021.\n\nGrayscale, which has run a bitcoin trust since 2013, helped open the door to regulatory approval for bitcoin ETFs after winning a court victory against the SEC last year. But analysts said its conversion last week offered investors an opportunity to exit their holdings.\n\nPreviously, investors had been able to sell their holdings only in the over-the-counter market, and they often traded at a large discount to the price of bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of shuffling around of deck chairs . . . because Grayscale was trading as a closed-end fund for so long, but as soon as it became an ETF it became liquid, so it\u2019s not surprising to see selling pressure coming from Grayscale,\u201d said James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares.\n\nAnalysts also pointed out that Grayscale charged a 1.5 per cent fee, which is more than a percentage point higher than new market entrants.\n\n\u201cFollowing a sharp run-up in valuations, it\u2019s natural to see some profit-taking from the investment community,\u201d said Zach Pandl, Grayscale\u2019s managing director for research.\n\nSome brokers have declined to offer trading in the new bitcoin ETFs. Vanguard, the world\u2019s second-largest asset manager, said the new products \u201cdid not align with its offer of a well-balanced, long-term investment portfolio\u201d.\n\nAnalysts said flows into bitcoin ETFs would take time to materialise as advisers became comfortable enough with the products to recommend them as additions to client portfolios.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about day one. This is new for a lot of clients,\u201d said an executive at one of the issuers who declined to be identified. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time to have a full education and understand its role in a portfolio and ultimately choose to make an allocation to a product. What I\u2019m most excited about is the long-term prospects. We are giving access to an entirely new market.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting from Steve Johnson in London"

        "content": "Bitcoin ETFs haven\u2019t yet summoned a tidal wave of fresh capital to crypto markets, but fret not. The next supposed price catalyst, the bitcoin halving, is right around the corner.\n\nLegend has it that bitcoin halvings are monstrously bullish. After all, the last three bull markets each began roaring only a few months after each event.\n\nThere have only been three halvings in Bitcoin\u2019s history, in 2012, 2016 and 2020, and three is far too small a sample size from which to draw any meaningful conclusion.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin halvings are bull market things \u2014 Will this time be different?\n\nStill, fewer bitcoins released each day will lead to a supply crunch, believers would say, inevitably pushing bitcoin (BTC) skyhigh.\n\nTruth is, nobody really knows what will happen around the halving, but it\u2019s the bitcoin miners who will feel its immediate effects.\n\nBitcoin distributes all new bitcoins directly to miners, who in about three months (around April 19) will suddenly earn 50% fewer block rewards: 3.125 BTC ($135,000) per block down from 6.25 BTC ($270,000).\n\nBitcoin self-regulates the time between blocks, keeping it around 10 minutes on average.\n\nMiners usually solve 144 blocks in a 24-hour period, which won\u2019t change after the halving.\n\nBlock rewards currently add up to 900 BTC ($38.9 million) each day.\n\nMiners can sell the bitcoin they earn to cover overheads (mostly electricity and in some cases debt). Bitcoin users also pad out block rewards with transaction fees, and thanks to the popularity of Ordinals inscriptions, they\u2019re forking out more than ever to use the network.\n\nUsers altogether paid about $500,000 per day in October but as much as $24 million in December, although miners have earned under $10 million per day in January so far.\n\nTransaction fees could bridge the revenue gap after the halving\n\nThat still works out to be about half the block rewards up for grabs after April 19. But bitcoin\u2019s price would need to stay about the same until then, alongside consistent demand for inscriptions.\n\nBitcoin staying up would solve halving concerns\n\nAll this makes bitcoin\u2019s price a very sensitive issue for the network.\n\nIt\u2019s always possible that the price of bitcoin could drop so low that it would force miners to switch off their rigs lest they run at a loss \u2014 a common occurrence throughout the last two bear markets, leading to debt raises and a string of bankruptcies.\n\nRead more: Compute North\u2019s business goes south\n\nOne estimate from Glassnode last September suggested that bitcoin dropping to $30,200 would \u201clikely put the majority of the mining market into severe income stress.\u201d Bitcoin trades for $43,000 right now, which would mean bitcoin miners could hypothetically withstand a 30% drop in bitcoin\u2019s price around the next halving.\n\nGlassnode\u2019s calculation was done weeks before Ordinals inspired a gigantic boom in fees, so it\u2019s likely miners will have more breathing room than first anticipated.\n\n(There\u2019s also far more hashrate on the Bitcoin network than ever before and its overall security is unlikely to be significantly impacted even if a large percentage of miners were to be switched off for any reason.)\n\nBlock rewards are paid in bitcoin and are unaffected by its US dollar value. So, the opposite scenario, in which the price of bitcoin pumps significantly around the halving is, of course, much better for miners and everyone else.\n\nThere\u2019s no real price pattern around bitcoin\u2019s halvings. Except it generally goes up\n\nAny concerns over whether block rewards will be enough to keep miners afloat after the halving could be properly put to bed if bitcoin\u2019s price were to simply double.\n\nSo far, so good. Tracking prices 200 days out from the past three bitcoin halvings shows BTC already rallying by 50% until now, largely propelled by buzz around BlackRock and others\u2019 bitcoin ETF bids.\n\nThat\u2019s better than the lead up to the past two halvings. Bitcoin had jumped by less than one third by this point before the 2020 halving, and in 2016, bitcoin had fallen 3%.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s performance around the first halving in 2012 blows the others out of the water. BTC rallied nearly 150% in the 200 days leading up to the event. Including the 200 days after stretches that number up to 4,500%.\n\nBitcoin is just as likely to map how its biggest fork, bitcoin cash (BCH), performed around its own halving.\n\nBCH tripled in the 200 days leading up to it and tripled again in the month after \u2014 but would go on to collapse by two-thirds over the following weeks.\n\nUpdated Feb. 5, 2024 at 4:21 am ET: Fixed scale on chart\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nUS asset managers are vying to launch exchange traded funds with leveraged bitcoin exposure and expand into bitcoin-based options and other cryptocurrencies after last week\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission approval of 11 spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nProShares this week disclosed plans to launch five ETFs, including one that would offer twice the daily exposure to a bitcoin-tracking index and others to provide inverse bitcoin returns, paying out up to double any decline in an underlying index, according to filings with the SEC. The extra leverage in the ETFs \u2014 which are not designed to be long-term investments \u2014 would amplify swings experienced by the already volatile bitcoin price.\n\nProShares, which declined to comment on the filings, is working in the newly unencumbered part of the market alongside firms such as Grayscale Investments, which last week filed to launch a product that will sell options on its $26bn bitcoin ETF. So are asset managers including BlackRock, which is looking to widen its massive ETF line-up to include exposure to other cryptocurrencies \u2014 foreshadowing future clashes with wary regulators.\n\n\u201cI see value in having an ethereum ETF,\u201d BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink told CNBC last week. Ethereum is a widely used blockchain with its own cryptocurrency (ether, or ETH, the second-largest token behind bitcoin). The SEC in October allowed a number of ether futures ETFs to launch.\n\nAny such strategy will need to pass muster with the SEC, which approved spot bitcoin ETFs after years of reluctance and with serious reservations.\n\nSEC chair Gary Gensler cautioned in his statement about the spot bitcoin ETF approvals that they did not \u201csignal anything about the commission\u2019s views as to the status of other crypto assets under the federal securities laws or about the current state of non-compliance of certain crypto asset market participants with the federal securities laws\u201d.\n\nEther ETFs were likely to face \u201csignificant hurdles to overcome, but if the SEC denies it, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the end of the story,\u201d Chris Brodersen, a managing director specialising in blockchain and digital assets at accounting firm EisnerAmper. \u201cI think these companies will do exactly what they did with bitcoin, which is go back and look for more clarity if necessary or look to the courts for some relief and try again.\u201d\n\nThe SEC\u2019s loss in a legal battle with Grayscale last year is widely seen as a turning point away from nearly a decade of denial, allowing bitcoin ETFs to pull in nearly $900mn in their first three days of trading earlier this month despite more than $1bn of outflows from Grayscale\u2019s ETF.\n\nVarious US issuers have previously secured approval for double-leveraged and inverse ETFs. Covered call ETFs, which sell options on underlying holdings to generate income, have boomed in popularity in recent years.\n\nJoe Hall, an attorney at Davis Polk, which advised Grayscale on its recent bitcoin ETF conversion, described the proposed leveraged and options-based bitcoin strategies as natural extensions.\n\n\u201cHow long that takes, I couldn\u2019t tell you, but if there\u2019s already analogues in ETF land or financial derivatives on the basic product, I suspect that those all end up being approved one way or the other,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s a very different question once you get outside of bitcoin.\u201d"

        "content": "Late last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission somewhat begrudgingly approved a spot bitcoin ETFs. If you\u2019re not up on your finance acronyms, that stands for exchange traded fund \u2014 you can think of it as a very easy way to invest in bitcoin from your brokerage account, no blockchain required. A \u201cspot\u201d fund invests in the asset directly, as opposed to making bets on futures contracts.\n\nWhenever I write about bitcoin, I usually mention the price \u2014 about $42,000 right now for one \u2014 and then say something like \u201cplease consult your financial adviser\u201d right afterward.\n\nSo in light of the news of this new route for bitcoin investment, I consulted with some financial advisers about what they\u2019re telling their clients.\n\nI asked certified financial planner Paul Brahim how frequently his clients ask about bitcoin.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s easier to ask if there are any clients who haven\u2019t asked about bitcoin, right?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been an ongoing dialogue since bitcoin emerged, how many years ago?\u201d\n\nBrahim is a managing director at Wealth Enhancement Group. Before the spot ETFs, Brahim could kind of brush off bitcoin. He would tell clients it\u2019s risky and unregulated, and if you lose the keys to your crypto wallet, you\u2019ve just lost all your money.\n\nNow he will tell clients something like, \u201cIf you want some bitcoin in your portfolio, that\u2019s fine, let\u2019s just make sure it\u2019s an amount of money more appropriate for roulette than retirement.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s put this in the casino capital category as opposed to core,\u201d he said.\n\nMatt Hougan at Bitwise Asset Management said he\u2019s been getting lots of calls from financial advisers about the spot bitcoin ETF his firm launched last week. But he doesn\u2019t expect to win over the crypto-skeptical overnight.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re gonna study it for months and months and months before they tiptoe into the waters,\u201d he said.\n\nHougan said he expects adviser attitudes toward bitcoin to follow a similar trajectory to when gold first got an ETF in 2003.\n\n\u201cWe called people who invested in gold \u2018goldbugs.\u2019 We talked about tin foil hats. They gathered in dusty convention halls off the Strip in Las Vegas to talk about this barbarous relic,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the ETF moved that mainstream.\u201d\n\nHougan said bitcoin ETFs aren\u2019t for everybody. That may include many ESG investors \u2014 people who want to deploy capital with environmental, social and governance goals in mind.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the Boulder, Colorado, area, so of course almost everybody is ESG investment interested,\u201d said Dan Yerger, president of MY Wealth Planners. \u201cThat is actually a big hindrance for it.\u201d\n\nAs of 2022, over 50% of bitcoin mining was powered by coal and gas."

        "title": "Decisions, Decisions: Discover the 3 Spot Bitcoin ETFs I'd Consider Buying - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "In a historic decision, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 applications to create a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Jan. 10. Sponsored by high-profile investment firms including BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco, Ark Invest, and several others, these ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without having to directly buy and hold the cryptocurrency.\n\nAll of the ETFs accomplish the same goal, but they do so with some minor -- yet important -- differences. For investors looking to add some Bitcoin (BTC -6.67%) exposure to portfolios, here are the ones I'd consider.\n\n1. Bitwise\n\nNo. 1 on the list of candidates is Bitwise. Known for offering innovative crypto-related financial products like its Web3 Index Fund and Bitwise 10 Crypto Fund, Bitwise has become a leader in blending cryptocurrencies with traditional finance.\n\nAlready well-versed in the crypto world, Bitwise naturally jumped at the opportunity to join the spot Bitcoin ETF race, and it might be winning. Bitwise's Bitcoin ETF (BITB -5.80%) offers the cheapest exposure to Bitcoin since it has waived all management fees. This does come with a stipulation, however.\n\nOnce the ETF has reached $1 billion in assets under management or six months have passed, a 0.2% fee will be tacked on. Even once this waiver passes, Bitwise will still have the lowest fees on the market.\n\nFurthermore, Bitwise gets some kudos because it plans on donating 10% of profits to fund the development of Bitcoin. Given its roots in crypto, low fees, and dedication to Bitcoin philanthropy, Bitwise should be the top choice for investors.\n\n2. Fidelity\n\nComing in at No. 2 on the list is Fidelity with its Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC -5.85%). As one of the first asset managers to test the crypto waters, Fidelity boasts a proven track record in traditional finance and experience with digital assets.\n\nAs a testament to its embrace of crypto, the company began mining Bitcoin in 2014. By 2018, it launched its own institutional crypto-custody service. And in March 2023, Fidelity unveiled a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nBeing the third-largest asset manager in the world and with more than 80 years of experience in the finance sector, Fidelity's familiarity with crypto is rare. With this knowledge, Fidelity crafted a one-of-a-kind Bitcoin ETF. Rather than opting to outsource custodial responsibilities to another company, Fidelity will serve as the sponsor and the custodian for the ETF. Beyond managing the fund and its records, in other words, Fidelity also handles the actual trading and safekeeping of Bitcoin assets while most of the new ETFs outsource that function.\n\nBy overseeing the management of the underlying Bitcoin assets, Fidelity can maintain control over the security infrastructure, operational processes, and risk management related to its Bitcoin holdings. While it doesn't offer a grace period during which fees are waived, the slightly higher fee of 0.25% seems worth it, knowing that the firm directly manages its Bitcoin.\n\n3. VanEck\n\nRounding out the list is VanEck's Bitcoin Trust (HODL -5.85%). Similar to Fidelity, the firm has proven experience in the crypto world. In 2021, it launched a Bitcoin Strategy ETF (a fund that tracks futures contracts and is less accurate than the new spot ETFs) as well as its Digital Transformation ETF, which holds dozens of companies at the forefront of crypto innovation.\n\nVanEck stands out among the 11 approved spot ETFs for three reasons. First, it boasts one of the lowest-cost structures at just 0.25%. Second, before launch, the firm raised $72.5 million in initial capital, the most of any ETF issuer. With greater amounts of capital from the onset, this signals confidence from institutional investors in the ETF's investment strategy and potential. Not to mention, with more funds in the ETF, it could lead to lower fees in the future.\n\nLast but not least, VanEck is promising 5% of the profits it makes to fund Bitcoin development. The company has been adamant that it is devoted to expanding Bitcoin's potential to become \"the most important financial freedom technology of the internet age.\" A round of applause to VanEck.\n\nA final note\n\nBefore buying any of these ETFs, I would implore readers to consider the differences between achieving Bitcoin exposure via the stock market versus actually owning Bitcoin itself. To own the actual Bitcoin, investors must purchase it off a cryptocurrency exchange like Coinbase Global.\n\nIn doing so, investors have direct ownership and control over their holdings, thereby increasing security as the Bitcoin can be sent to cold storage wallets. When choosing the ETF route, you entrust a third party to manage the underlying Bitcoin. Make sure that's what you want before making this leap."

Data tracked by Paris-based Kaiko shows the selling pressure has been concentrated on Binance, the leading crypto exchange by trading volumes, OKX, and Upbit. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, changed hands at $42,700 at press time, representing a 12% drop from the high of $48,975 reached Thursday. The price drop seems to have stemmed from traders taking profits on long (buy) positions initiated in anticipation of ETFs\u2019 debut. An indicator called the cumulative volume delta (CVD) shows traders from Binance led the so-called \u201csell-the-fact\u201d pullback in bitcoin. The CVD tracks the net difference between buying and selling volumes over time, offering a total of net bullish/bearish pressures in the market. Positive values indicate excess purchase volume, while negative values suggest otherwise."

        "content": "Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally granted a long-standing wish of cryptocurrency market participants and exchange traded funds (ETFs) user by approving spot bitcoin ETFs. To be precise, the commission approved 11 such products.\n\nThe news has been a good news/bad news scenario. Last year, bitcoin more than doubled in anticipation that related spot bitcoin ETFs would finally come to life in the U.S. That set the stage for a \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened. However, much of the digital currency\u2019s retrenchment in recent days is believed to be attributable to investors selling the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which was converted from an index fund to an ETF.\n\nOn the other hand, the good news is that spot bitcoin ETFs are finally here and these products could expand the universe of advisors and investors accessing cryptocurrency.\n\nOne caveat: With rookie ETFs with the same investment objective coming to market at the same time, end users have some homework to do to determine which spot bitcoin is best for them. I\u2019ll help with some of that homework here.\n\nVanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL)\n\nThe VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL) likely takes the take for best ticker among the new spot bitcoin ETFs as it adopts the acronym for \u201chold on for dear life,\u201d which is often used in crypto parlance. HODL was seeded with more than $72 million, good for one of the largest tallies among the 11 spotcoin funds. While an ETF\u2019s seed capital is just a small part of its story, that sturdy sum highlights VanEck\u2019s commitment to this product.\n\nThat figure has since grown to $81.74 million, indicating HODL is off to a solid start and could soon surpass the $100 million assets under management range that is often important in the ETF space. Each 1,000 shares of HODL represents 1.132 bitcoin and its 0.25% annual expense ratio is the second-lowest among the 11 spot bitcoin ETFs. Plus, HODL has enviable DNA.\n\n\u201cVanEck was the first established ETF issuer to prioritize this type of product. And it has taken more than six years to get to this launch today. As an experienced asset manager with significant crypto expertise, we\u2019re in a unique position to help investors who have been waiting for this kind of vehicle to begin their own bitcoin journey,\u201d said VanEck CEO Jan van Eck in a statement.\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR)\n\nThe Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR) is sponsored by Valkyrie Digital Assets and comes with an expense ratio of 0.25% per year and that\u2019s being waived for the first three months. That could be an attractive proposition for cost-conscious investors that are taking a long-term view of bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThe investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the value of a bitcoin as represented by the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate - New York Variant (the \u201cIndex\u201d), less the Trust\u2019s liabilities and expenses. The Shares are designed to provide investors with a cost-effective and convenient way to invest in bitcoin,\u201d according to the issuer.\n\nValkyrie offers several other crypto-related ETFs that preceded BRRR and that competency, along with the debut of BRRR, could have been a factor in CoinShares\u2019 recent decision to move forward with an acquisition of Tennessee-based Valkyrie. With that, BRRR and the other Valkyrie ETFs could, at some point, bear the CoinShares name.\n\nFidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (FBTC)\n\nThe Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (FBTC) also charges 0.25% annually, but that fee is being waived until July. Additionally, Fidelity is one of the most recognizable brands in the spot bitcoin ETF arena and its distribution capabilities and advisor platforms could propel FBTC to rapid adoption among the registered investment advisor (RIA)/wealth management community.\n\nThat\u2019s the opposite approach of rival Vanguard, which is barring clients from transacting in the new spot bitcoin ETFs. This isn\u2019t a new approach for Fidelity. The fund giant has been involved with crypto for a decade and last year, its Wealthscape platform used by wealth managers added Fidelity Crypto. In fact, the issuer is framing FBTC as the go-to spot bitcoin ETF for RIAs.\n\n\u201cFBTC offers a familiar investment structure, standard reporting, and transparent pricing for easy incorporation into client portfolio,\u201d notes Fidelity.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

The SEC's move will give regular investors more access to cryptocurrency \u2014 a notoriously erratic asset \u2014 and may help to carve out its place in mainstream finance.\n\nCramer stressed that the SEC's approval does not mean the organization endorses these products. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has spoken out against crypto in the past and the agency disapproved more than 20 filings for spot Bitcoin ETPs from 2018-2023.\n\n\"Now, that said, I'm not as stridently against these new investment vehicles as Gary Gensler is,\" Cramer said. \"At this point, Bitcoin's been around for 15 years, it's fairly well-established, and I don't want to try to stop anyone from speculating in this stuff, as long as they do their research. Of course, I'm not totally sure what your research would be, but that's not my problem.\""

        "title": "Despite SEC's novel alignment on bitcoin ETF vote, it's regulatory politics as usual - InvestmentNews",
        "content": "A recent SEC vote to approve a spot bitcoin ETF was both typical \u2013 in that the agency split, 3-2, on a controversial decision, and extraordinary \u2013 in that the three \u201cyeas\u201d consisted of SEC Chair Gary Gensler and the two Republican commissioners.\n\nBut rather than representing a tectonic shift in the politics of regulation, the alignment of the five-member SEC on the bitcoin decision signals that the stark divisions that have characterized major rulemaking under Gensler will continue as the Securities and Exchange Commission wrestles with explosive pending regulations. That effort will unfold, however, with the looming threat of lawsuits by opponents and court decisions like the one that drove the bitcoin ETF outcome.\n\nSEC proposals on financial advisors\u2019 conflicts related to artificial intelligence and predictive data analytics, advisor custody of client funds, swing pricing for mutual funds and climate disclosure are among major pending regulations that have drawn widespread resistance.\n\nUsually, opponents of SEC proposals can find allies in the two SEC Republican commissioners, Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda. In the 3-2 votes cast so far on proposals and final rules, it\u2019s been Gensler and the two Democratic commissioners, Caroline Crenshaw and Jaime Lizarraga, as \u201cyeas\u201d and Peirce and Uyeda as \u201cnays.\u201d\n\nThe bitcoin vote was different. For the first time in his nearly three-year tenure, Gensler sided with the two Republicans to approve 11 spot bitcoin ETFs. The alignment was startling but not a harbinger of Gensler\u2019s shifting to the right in oversight.\n\n\u201cThis vote is not going to usher in a new era of strange alliances on votes on rulemakings or other applications to list and trade products,\u201d said Kurt Wolfe, counsel at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan.\n\nGensler\u2019s statement seems to indicate that he was at best reluctant \u2013 perhaps dragged kicking and screaming \u2013 to cast his vote in favor of the bitcoin ETF. He felt constrained by a Washington, D.C., federal appeals court ruling that the SEC had failed to explain its reasoning adequately in a prior rejection of a Grayscale bitcoin ETF.\n\n\u201cI feel the most sustainable path forward is to approve the listing and trading of these spot bitcoin ETP shares,\u201d Gensler said in a statement. He went on to say that the SEC\u2019s approval comes with several investor protections and reiterated the risks associated with crypto assets, a view shared by many financial advisors.\n\n\u201cMaybe it was better to capitulate now than to wage a losing war,\u201d Wolfe said.\n\nWill the threat of legal challenges affect rulemaking on some of the major controversial potential final rules ahead? It\u2019s hard to say for certain. What we can see is that Gensler\u2019s ambitious regulatory agenda hasn\u2019t changed in any significant way despite growing pressure from financial industry detractors who are poised to file lawsuits against final rules.\n\nIn addition to the stability of Gensler\u2019s agenda, there has been a lack of exemptive orders or no-action letters that signal a significant shift in the SEC\u2019s direction on significant policy matters.\n\n\u201cAll signs indicate it will be business as usual,\u201d said Val Dahiya, a partner at Morrison Foerster and a former branch chief for the SEC\u2019s division of trading and markets. Gensler \u201cis proceeding with his vision. They\u2019re going to let this play out in the courts.\u201d\n\nAs Grayscale\u2019s successful challenge of the SEC\u2019s previous disapproval of a bitcoin ETF illustrates, courts could be inclined to side with the SEC\u2019s industry opponents.\n\n\u201cThe theoretical check and balance seems to be becoming a more practical check and balance on the authority of the SEC,\u201d said Brian McCabe, partner at Ropes & Gray. \u201cI suspect the Democratic commissioners are going to be a little more cautious about making sure they have built the best record in support of the conclusions they reach\u201d on rulemakings.\n\nInvestor protection advocates question whether Gensler needed to abandon his opposition to a bitcoin ETF. They suggest that there was a path for him to continue the SEC\u2019s ban on the products, as Crenshaw and Lizarraga voted to do.\n\n\u201cIn this case, the agency may have blinked in the face of a legal threat,\u201d said Mark Hays, senior policy analyst at Americans for Financial Reform. \u201cWe believe they still had options. The agency always has to decide which hills are worth dying on when it come to their legal strategy.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the atmosphere that will surround Gensler and his colleagues in the coming months as they shape many controversial proposals into final rules. He\u2019s a savvy regulator who knows how to navigate political and legal minefields.\n\n\u201cYou have to look hard at the rules and determine if there\u2019s a version of the proposal that either will not get challenged or if challenged will survive,\u201d Wolfe said.\n\nGensler was forced into a position he didn\u2019t like on the bitcoin ETF. He\u2019ll likely figure out how to land in a place where he\u2019s more comfortable next time."

The regulator approved the ETFs from Ark Invest and 21 Shares, Bitwise, BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, Hashdex, Invesco, Valkyrie, VanEck and WisdomTree.\n\nBut Vanguard wants no part of the spot bitcoin ETF hype, for now.\n\n\u201cWhile we continuously evaluate our brokerage offer and evaluate new product entries to the market, spot bitcoin ETFs will not be available for purchase on the Vanguard platform,\u201d Vanguard said.\n\nThis article was previously published by Ignites, a title owned by the FT Group.\n\nThe company also doesn\u2019t plan to offer Vanguard bitcoin ETFs or other cryptocurrency-related products.\n\n\u201cOur perspective is that these products do not align with our offer focused on asset classes, such as equities, bonds, and cash, which Vanguard views as the building blocks of a well-balanced, long-term investment portfolio,\u201d the company said.\n\nVanguard\u2019s decision to shun spot bitcoin ETFs \u201cis very much on brand for Vanguard,\u201d Jeff DeMaso, editor of The Independent Vanguard Advisor, wrote to his readers.\n\n\u201cThe firm has long tried to \u2018look out\u2019 for smaller investors,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cFor example, the firm kicked leveraged ETFs off its platform several years ago. Vanguard also hasn\u2019t touched crypto with a 10-foot pole,\u201d DeMaso wrote.\n\nHowever, he said he had bought a futures-based bitcoin ETF in his personal Vanguard account: the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF.\n\n\u201cSimply put, this is contradictory. Bitcoin futures are meant to [and generally have] track bitcoin\u2019s price,\u201d DeMaso said. \u201cIf Bitcoin is too volatile or doesn\u2019t have a place in a long-term portfolio [the reasons Vanguard has said it\u2019s not allowing purchases of the new spot ETFs], well, the same should apply to the futures-based bitcoin ETFs.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s decision not to include spot bitcoin ETFs on its own platform has caused some Vanguard customers to do business with other companies.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs will be available on Schwab, Fidelity, SoFi and Wells Fargo\u2019s platforms.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m working on transferring assets out of there, and then I will close my Vanguard account,\u201d Neil Jacobs posted on X. \u201cTerrible business decision by Vanguard.\u201d\n\nJacobs describes himself as a \u201cBitcoiner\u201d on X and is the co-founder of FOMO21, a bitcoin apparel and merchandise shop.\n\nIt is common for new ETFs to only be available for trading on self-directed platforms, such as Fidelity and Schwab, because there are fewer restrictions than on other wealth management platforms, said Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi.\n\nIt is unclear if other wealth management platforms will add spot bitcoin ETFs to their platforms.\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit the ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools helping you to understand everything from performance to ESG ratings\n\nRepresentatives from Citi, Edward Jones, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and UBS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect firms that already did not allow crypto-adjacent products on their platforms to suddenly allow any of the spot bitcoin ETFs, just because they were approved to launch,\u201d Matt Apkarian, associate director of product development at Cerulli Associates, said.\n\n\u201cThe firms have a stance on whether they believe digital asset-focused investments are suitable for their clients and whether allowing their advisers to invest in them on behalf of their clients would expose their firm to risk, and they are likely to stick to that until some significant regulation is passed governing the digital asset market.\u201d\n\nMany firms don\u2019t think offering these products on their platforms is a \u201cmake or break decision with current and potential clients,\u201d Apkarian said.\n\n*Ignites is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

        "content": "Depiction of bitcoin. (Photo Courtesy of The Economic Times)\n\nThe financial system and retail investing market landscape have undergone many changes throughout the years. Innovation continues to create new opportunities for institutional and retail investors in the progressing integration of technology and finance. Now, we may be seeing monumental changes to the asset class of cryptocurrencies, a security that has faced mixed sentiments since its inception.\n\nThe spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is an investment vehicle that allows ordinary investors exposure to the price moves of bitcoin in regular brokerage accounts. BlackRock, Fidelity and Bitwise are among the 11 money managers granted to release the product on their platform, according to CNBC.\n\nThese spot bitcoin ETFs provide cheaper access to investing in bitcoin by purchasing through the asset manager\u2019s platforms versus purchasing them directly through a crypto exchange. Another benefit is that it eliminates the process of maintaining a cryptocurrency wallet and offline cryptocurrency storage to protect the investment.\n\nOn January 10, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the listing and trading of a number of spot bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) shares. This decision came after countless filings were disapproved by the commission, due to the SEC\u2019s belief that the products would be exposed to market manipulation. However, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia stated that the SEC failed to adequately explain its reasoning for disapproving Grayscale\u2019s application for its spot bitcoin ETF in June 2022. The argument in this case was that the proposal did not meet anti-fraud and investor protection standards.\n\nBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency. It was launched in 2009 by a group of computer programmers under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. By the end of 2011, the price had grown past $1, peaking at $29.6 by mid-year. Fast-forward a decade to January 2021, and the price had surpassed its subsequent record price, peaking at $63,558 later that April.\n\nAn increasing number of institutions, platforms and countries have accepted bitcoin as a form of currency. The adoption of bitcoin has benefited nations such as Ukraine and Iran. On the other hand, countries like China and Saudi Arabia have made it illegal to use Bitcoin because of the fear of its volatility, decentralized nature and threat to monetary systems.\n\nIn the release, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said, \u201cIf the issuer of a security and the listing exchange comply with the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Commission\u2019s rules, that issuer must be provided the same access to our regulated markets as anyone else.\u201d However, bitcoin has continued to receive pushback and warning from Gensler.\n\nAdvertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\u201cInvestors should be aware that the underlying asset is a highly speculative, volatile asset and amongst its use cases is really for illicit activity\u2026 Money laundering, sanctions, ransomware, and alike,\u201d he said.\n\nThese issues can pose a major risk to the legitimacy of the markets and the safety of others.\n\nAn example can be found in the United States Department of Justice (DOJ)\u2019s investigation of Iranian firms bypassing US sanctions by processing billions worth of transactions through the crypto exchange Binance.\n\nLarry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, was originally not a supporter until a couple of years ago and is now a big believer in the movement. When asked about the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin, Fink supported that it would be an asset class that protects investors.\n\nAn asset like bitcoin has seen drastic price increases and decreases, but if volatility remains down over time and the value rises, investors will see it as a much more attractive asset to maintain.\n\n\u201cIf people are fearful of geopolitical risk or their own risk, it is no different than what gold has represented for thousands of years,\u201d Fink said. \u201cWhat we are trying to do is offer an instrument that can store wealth.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\nIf the value of Bitcoin itself surges, investors buying into these newly released ETFs could come out as big winners moving forward. Ark Invest CEO & CIO Cathie Wood is confident that the asset will have a major price increase within the next few years.\n\n\u201cOur base case is in the $600,000 range and our bull case is $1.5 million dollars by 2030,\u201d she said.\n\nCopy edited by Jalyn Lovelady"

        "content": "ETF capture of asset classes expanded notably last week with the launch of 10 spot bitcoin ETFs. Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, discussed the launch of the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), with BlackRock\u2019s Jay Jacobs. Rosenbluth and Jacobs also talked about the benefits of ETF bitcoin exposure for investors, and about blockchain technology at the Crypto Symposium hosted on the VettaFi platform.\n\n\u201cThis is a culmination of a multiyear journey to bring out a bitcoin ETF,\u201d Jay Jacobs, U.S. head of thematics and Active Equity ETFs at BlackRock, explained. \u201cThis was really driven by the investors themselves.\u201d\n\nThreefold Benefit of Spot Bitcoin ETFs for Investors\n\nETFs remain a popular vehicle with investors. Demand continues to grow for more asset classes offered in an ETF wrapper. The approval by the SEC and subsequent launch of spot bitcoin ETFs provide investors with a number of benefits.\n\nThe iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) allows investors to gain access to bitcoin through their traditional brokerages. \u201cThe ability to see bitcoin alongside traditional investments like stocks and bonds is a key piece of why an ETF provides value to investors,\u201d said Jacobs.\n\nAs well as ease of access, spot bitcoin ETFs provide convenience for investors. Cryptocurrency is an asset class that requires custodians, storage, and additional tax considerations when invested in directly. An ETF helps remove much of the legwork and complexities from bitcoin investing.\n\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s really about quality,\u201d Jacobs explained of the launch of IBIT. \u201cIt\u2019s about looking at what BlackRock has done across 1,300 ETFs globally and trillions of dollars in assets over the last 20 years and really applying that quality to a bitcoin ETF.\u201d\n\nHe went on to discuss the increased need for granularity by investors in an environment of ongoing risk and uncertainty. The addition of bitcoin ETFs gives investors even more choice, particularly when increasingly more portfolios look beyond traditional asset classes.\n\nOpportunity to Invest in Blockchain\u2019s Nascent Potential\n\nBlackRock also offers the iShares Blockchain and Tech (IBLC) that launched in April 2022. Blockchain is a decentralized ledger maintained in a peer-to-peer network.\n\n\u201cHistorically, a lot of data entry has been centralized and when it is centralized, that means it is controlled by one or only a few people,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cThat can be really powerful for doing things quickly. But that\u2019s not necessarily very powerful for doing things in a secure way, or an immutable way.\u201d\n\nBecause blockchain is decentralized, it provides security and an immutability that centralized systems cannot. Jacobs still considers blockchain technology to be in the nascent stage of development, but with much promise. As increasingly more companies begin to adopt the technology, and its use case is better defined, broad uptake will likely follow."

        "content": "Index investing is a great approach, but you can do even better with specific stocks or cryptocurrencies from time to time.\n\nLet's say you invested $1,000 in an index fund tracking the S&P 500 (^GSPC -0.29%) index 5 years ago. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY -0.20%) is one popular option with minimal management fees and a stellar history of reflecting its chosen index.\n\nIf you reinvested dividends into more shares of the exchange-traded fund (ETF) over time, you would have doubled your money by now. That's an average annual return of 15% -- well above the 10-year average at 12% or the 10% annual returns since the ETF was introduced 41 years ago.\n\nIt's easy to see why The Motley Fool recommends holding a diversified stock portfolio for a long time, in the spirit of index-fund pioneer John Bogle and master investor Warren Buffett. I mean, good luck finding a savings account with a stable 10% interest rate, not to mention the higher gains in recent years. Diversified investing is a proven strategy for building and protecting your wealth in the long run.\n\nBut what if you picked up $1,000 of Bitcoin (BTC -6.67%) tokens five years ago? The largest cryptocurrency was in the middle of another crypto winter back then, hampered by hacking scandals and regulatory crackdowns with no support to speak of from large banks and other financial institutions. The $19,345 record price of the Bitcoin boom in 2017 felt like a distant memory, melted down to $3,644 per token.\n\nBitcoin's rocky five-year gains\n\nAs it turns out, that was a solid buying window for investors looking to commit their funds over a five-year span. A $1,000 Bitcoin investment on Jan. 15, 2019, was worth $11,540 at the time of writing exactly five years later:\n\nIt hasn't been a smooth ride, but there's no denying the general upswing over five years. In this period, Bitcoin investors faced more crypto-exchange hacks, the coronavirus health crisis, a global inflation surge, and other challenges. Bitcoin prices fell more than 10% in August 2023, not to mention six single-month drops of that magnitude in 2022. The preceding chart includes all of these headwinds and crashes.\n\nThe road ahead: Bumpy but hopeful\n\nStill, Bitcoin is back on its digital feet with more gains than losses in recent months and a robust slate of upcoming catalysts for further gains.\n\nThe next Bitcoin halving -- a regularly scheduled increase of the computing power required to mine new Bitcoins -- is scheduled in April 2024. These events are typically followed by a strong bull run in Bitcoin prices over the next couple of years.\n\nAmerican regulators recently approved 11 applications for ETFs based on spot-market Bitcoin prices. The approval did not result in a sharp price boost, but having easy access to Bitcoin-based investment vehicles such as the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ARKB -5.69% ) iShares Bitcoin Trust IBIT -5.82% )\n\nThe regulatory picture is starting to clear up, driven by renewed public interest in the crypto space and progress in important legal cases such as the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission vs. Ripple XRP -7.28% )\n\nThe general long-term trend tends to leave traditional stock market indices like the S&P 500 far behind. Furthermore, that bullish market tenor should continue over the next couple of years due to the technology, market, and regulation events listed above -- with the caveat that there may be dramatic price drops along the way for a myriad unforeseen reasons.\n\nSo Bitcoin isn't a magic ticket to automatic investment gains, with a significant risk of sudden downswings and long periods of stalled or negative returns. Sticking with a market tracker like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF may be a better choice if you're not ready for the volatility and technical quirks of Bitcoin investing.\n\nStill, it's a robust digital currency with an unpredictable yet promising future, and I think a modest position in Bitcoin (or one of the Bitcoin-based ETFs) would be a healthy addition to a diversified portfolio."

The end of the crypto winter came in large part because of anticipation that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might finally grant approval to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) seeking to own Bitcoin directly.\n\nIndeed, that optimistic scenario came to pass earlier this month. The SEC approved 11 different spot Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 10, opening the door to a flood of new interest from investors who were wary about investing directly in the cryptocurrency themselves.\n\nThat was particularly important for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC -5.76%). The Grayscale Bitcoin investment vehicle had been in place for years as an unregistered fund for accredited and institutional investors through private placements.\n\nWith the SEC's move, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust became a true ETF. And as it happens, what is now the world's largest Bitcoin ETF has scored an even bigger win simply by virtue of its having retained its leadership status amid a flood of new rivals.

Its shares were listed on the over-the-counter market, and it had offered shares directly to those investors who were eligible to make purchases without Grayscale having to register its shares as securities with the SEC. After a holding period, initial purchasers could turn around and sell their shares over the counter to whoever wanted to buy them.\n\nThere were a couple of problems with Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, however. First, it carried a high expense ratio of 2% per year. Even worse, Grayscale didn't offer any redemption rights, so unlike with an ETF, even large institutional shareholders had no ability to exchange shares for the Bitcoin that the trust held.\n\nAs a consequence, shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust plunged far below the value of the underlying Bitcoin that the fund owned. Lacking a redemption mechanism, there was no way for arbitrage-minded investors to capitalize on the disparity in the short run.\n\nIndeed, when Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's discounts to net asset value were at their highest, many investors believed that the crypto investment vehicle could suffer significant outflows if the SEC approved its ETF conversion.\n\nMoreover, with alternatives offering Bitcoin exposure at much lower expense ratios -- despite a post-conversion cut from 2% to 1.5% -- it seemed that Grayscale might lose its crypto dominance. Instead, the discount disappeared, giving extra returns to those who invested in the Grayscale vehicle when discounts were at their highest.\n\nGrayscale is holding its own\n\nAs a result, at least in its early days, no exodus from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF has happened. The ETF reported 690 million shares outstanding as of Jan. 12, with a total value of $26.9 billion and each share representing roughly 0.000894 underlying Bitcoin. That's consistent with where asset levels were prior to the SEC approval.\n\nDeeper analysis suggests relatively small movements of actual Bitcoin from the Grayscale ETF. One report from Arkham Intelligence noted a movement of nearly 900 Bitcoin on Jan. 12, worth roughly $41 million. Even if that represented redemptions, though, it was inconsequential compared to the size of the fund.\n\nWill Grayscale lose its leadership?\n\nFor cost-conscious investors, Grayscale has a disadvantage. Every single one of its 10 competitors offers a lower expense ratio. Early favorite iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT -5.82%) charges just 0.25% per year in fees.\n\nThat could eventually spur investors to move their assets away from Grayscale. Yet for those who have invested in Bitcoin long enough to have sizable gains, the capital-gains tax liability that would come from switching from Grayscale to a rival Bitcoin ETF would be a deterrent.\n\nAt least in the opening days, Grayscale has done well to hold on to its assets. But investors shouldn't be surprised if that story changes in the months to come -- particularly as other Bitcoin ETFs show their ability to track the value of the cryptocurrency."

        "content": "Bitcoin spot ETFs are creating new market inefficiencies.\n\nCrypto native traders can therefore take advantage of new arbitrage opportunities.\n\nBitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes explained a few of them in his latest blog post.\n\nThe launch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US is giving professional traders new arbitrage opportunities, according to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes.\n\nNo Binance? No problem\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF is good news for sophisticated traders, Hayes wrote in a recent blog.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in a long time, the Bitcoin markets will have a predictable and long-lasting arbitrage opportunity,\u201d he said.\n\nHayes pointed out that the ETF\u2019s net asset value \u2014 or NAV \u2014 is determined each day by a CF Benchmarks index price of Bitcoin at 4pm Eastern US time.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nThe index receives prices from six approved exchanges: Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, iBit, LMAX Digital, and Bitstamp.\n\nETF managers in the US will only be able to trade Bitcoin on these exchanges, Hayes said.\n\nBut Binance, with its roughly $4 billion in daily Bitcoin spot trading volume, remains the most liquid crypto exchange and a primary driver of price discovery.\n\nYet, Binance is excluded from the index.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nIn other words, fund managers won\u2019t be able to trade Bitcoin at the best available price \u2014 only the price quoted on those six exchanges.\n\n\u201cThis unnatural state of play only serves to create more market inefficiencies from which we, as arbitrageurs, can profit,\u201d said Hayes.\n\nArbitrage galore\n\nHayes offered a simple arbitrage scenario.\n\nTraders can bet whether fund managers will seek to create or redeem new ETF shares based on whether the ETF trades higher or lower than its intraday net asset value, Hayes said.\n\nIf it trades higher, they\u2019ll need to create more shares, adding supply to the market and lowering the price. If it trades lower, then managers will redeem shares, lifting shares from the market and reducing supply.\n\nAnd because of the regulatory limitations imposed on them, ETF managers are forced to use CF Benchmark exchanges, pushing prices up or down on these venues depending on whether they\u2019re buying or selling Bitcoin.\n\nThe trade: Traders can simply choose the least liquid exchange on the CF Benchmarks index and compare the price of Bitcoin on the platform against the price of Bitcoin on Binance.\n\nThen, they can buy Bitcoin on the cheapest exchange of the two and sell it on the more expensive one.\n\nPut another way, traders can now frontrun the funds creating or redeeming ETF shares by keeping track of Bitcoin prices on CF Benchmark exchanges.\n\n\u201cHopefully, billions of dollars of flow will be concentrated in an hour-long period on exchanges that are less-liquid and price followers of their larger Eastern competitors,\u201d Hayes said.\n\nHayes also predicted that listed options will soon appear on US options exchanges, using ETF shares as the underlying asset.\n\nNot only will options give traders a liquid way to place leveraged bets on Bitcoin, they will also open up new ETF-specific strategies, such as forward arbitrage \u2014 arbitrage between Bitcoin perpetuals on centralised exchanges and options on US options exchanges.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange filed on Tuesday to list options on spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\u201cOptions will likely be a big hit on these given the volatility,\u201d according to Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.\n\n\u201cFor these trading opportunities to last a long time and allow arbitrageurs to execute them in sufficient size, the Bitcoin spot ETF complex must trade billions of dollars-worth of shares each day,\u201d warned Hayes.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin is down 0.79% on the day, trading at just above $42,780.\n\nEthereum fell 1.49% on the day, trading at just over $2,540.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nUpdate: This story was corrected to reflect that CF Benchmarks is the name of the indices provider, not the index itself.\n\nTom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

        "content": "VanEck said in a Wednesday news release it plans to close its Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF). The fund intends to stop trading on Jan. 30.\n\nXBTF was one of several ETFs holding bitcoin futures contracts that began trading in late 2021. The fund has about $53 million assets under management, according to VanEck\u2019s website.\n\nThe decision to liquidate the fund was due to factors including performance, liquidity assets under management and investor interest \u2014 as well as \u201cother operational considerations\u201d VanEck said in a statement.\n\nThe fund launched in November 2021, about a month after the first bitcoin futures ETF \u2014 the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) \u2014 hit the market.\n\nBITO benefitted from launching first, as that fund\u2019s assets quickly grew above $1 billion and have peaked at more than $2 billion.\n\nRead more: The biggest bitcoin futures ETF hits $2B AUM ahead of spot BTC fund decision\n\nVanEck\u2019s decision to shutter its bitcoin futures ETF comes at a time when the market is seeing significant developments in bitcoin-related financial products. The company was among the issuers who launched the first US spot bitcoin ETFs last week; a major milestone in the cryptocurrency investment space.\n\nSome industry watchers have said they expected interest in bitcoin futures ETFs to dwindle as funds holding BTC became available.\n\nBITO has seen roughly $280 million of net outflows during the last two trading days, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data \u2014 while new spot funds by BlackRock and Fidelity have seen a combined $1.2 billion in net inflows since hitting the market.\n\nOthers continuing to offer bitcoin futures ETFs, for now, include Ark Invest and 21Shares, as well as Bitwise. Valkyrie in October converted its bitcoin futures ETF into one that also holds ether futures contracts.\n\nHashdex is in the process of converting its bitcoin futures ETF into one that offers spot BTC exposure \u2014 a change that is still under review by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s still a role for futures products to play in this market,\u201d 21Shares President Ophelia Snyder said during a November interview on Bloomberg TV. \u201cI think that is a smaller role than what spot will play.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

So just please stop talking about this shit,\" he said.\n\nHe went on to say \u201cI don\u2019t know what [Fink] would say about blockchain versus currencies that do something versus bitcoin that does nothing,\u201d Dimon added.\n\nFinding common ground\n\nWhile Dimon decried bitcoin, he expressed more support for smart contract-enabled blockchains. He gave the example of tokenization \u2014 a potential area of agreement relating to the wider crypto space with Fink.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nLast week, Fink said bitcoin ETFs \"are just stepping stones towards tokenization and I really do believe this is where we're going to be going.\"\n\nBut, unlike Dimon, Fink was positive on both crypto and bitcoin. He compared bitcoin's trajectory to gold's history. \"It\u2019s no different than what gold represented over thousands of years,\" he said.\n\nIn 2022, Fink also called cryptocurrency potentially transcendent. \"It's an international asset,\" he said in a July interview with CNBC, referring to crypto broadly. \"It has a differentiating value versus other asset classes, but more importantly, because it's so international, it's going to transcend any one currency.\"\n\nSo far, BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF is one of the most popular in terms of trading activity and has generated nearly $2 billion worth of volume through three days of trading, according to data from Yahoo Finance compiled by The Block."

        "content": "With the SEC opening the floodgates to spot bitcoin ETFs last week, VanEck\u2019s Director of Digital Assets Product Kyle DaCruz thinks that interest in cryptocurrency products and bitcoin ETFs is \u201conly going to spike.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think from here on out, it\u2019s going to just be continued interest and demand,\u201d he said during a panel on VettaFi\u2019s Cryptocurrency Symposium on Friday.\n\nDaCruz said that after a few issues in the market, including cases of fraud, interest in bitcoin \u201chad been muted,\u201d and \u201crightly so.\u201d But \u201cnow that these regulated products have come to market, interest is only going to spike.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs time goes on and as platforms continue to add access\u2026we\u2019ll start to see greater availability,\u201d he noted. \u201cThere is some oversight and regulation in place.\u201d\n\nSee more: \u201cVanEck Asserts Itself in Spot Bitcoin ETF Fray With HODL\u201d\n\nBlockchain: A Transformative Technology\n\nWhile many investors think of crypto and blockchain as potentially \u201cdangerous,\u201d DaCruz argued that \u201cif used properly, it\u2019s a technology that can keep us all honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlockchain can potentially be a transformative technology that solves a lot of the issues we\u2019ve had in this space,\u201d he commented. \u201cIt\u2019s an educational barrier to overcome.\u201d\n\nAnd based on the results of a poll conducted by VettaFi, advisors are most worried about volatility when investing in crypto, with 33% of respondents citing that as their top concern. Meanwhile, 27% of respondents cited crypto\u2019s difficulty to value as their top concern.\n\nDaCruz thinks that bitcoin fits into a portfolio\u2019s real-assets bucket. He cited research showing that a 1% \u201callocation to bitcoin in a 60/40 portfolio can actually improve not just the returns but the overall risk-adjusted Sharpe ratio.\u201d\n\nThe Launch of HODL\n\nThe VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL) was one of the 10 spot bitcoin ETFs that launched last week. HODL came to market with $72.5 million in seed capital.\n\nHODL joins the issuer\u2019s crypto funds including the crypto-correlated, equity-based VanEck Digital Transformation ETF (DAPP) and the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT).\n\nDaCruz said that what sets VanEck apart is that the issuer has \u201cbeen in crypto since 2017,\u201d which provides \u201cnative experience\u201d and can educate investors \u201con this emerging technology.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin is making headlines, as the regulators have finally approved a way to \u201cinvest\u201d that doesn\u2019t require a crypto wallet, an unregulated \u201cexchange\u201d intermediary and a \u201ccrypto key\u201d that might be easily lost or stolen. In short, Bitcoin has joined the league of major asset classes now that Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) will be available to the general public through stellar names like Fidelity, Invesco, Wisdom Tree and more.\n\nThese ETFs will trade based on the \u201cspot\u201d (immediate) price of Bitcoin. Notably, Bitcoin futures have been trading on the CME Group platform since December 2017. (Full disclosure: I serve on the Board of Directors of CME Group.)\n\nSecurities regulators delayed implementing actual \u201ccash\u201d price trading on regulated securities exchanges in an effort to protect investors. In hindsight, the many and well-publicized issues with \u201cBitcoin exchanges\u201d validated their concerns.\n\nBut now the time has come for regulated, public trading of Bitcoin. So, for my readers, the big question is: Does Bitcoin belong in your portfolio?\n\nAnd the simple answer is that it depends on who you are and how you view your own risk tolerance. Are you an investor, a speculator, a gambler? Are you looking for thrills, or trading profits, or long-term gains? Do you even understand what Bitcoin is, or does, or can do in the future?\n\nThe attraction of Bitcoin\n\nWhen I first wrote about Bitcoin several years ago (search my columns at TerrySavage.com for \u201cBitcoin Basics\u201d), I explained that this was a form of electronic currency, similar to alternatives to paper money that have been used throughout the centuries.\n\nPaper money was always easy to create, eventually diminishing the value of the currency. In ancient times, Roman emperors made ridges on the edges of gold and silver coins, to keep holders from shaving off the edges. In fact, historically, gold has always been the best hedge against debasement of the currency (inflation). The simple fact is that gold cannot be created or destroyed, despite centuries of efforts by alchemists.\n\nSupporters view Bitcoin as the \u201cmodern gold\u201d because of its limited availability. According to a recent article on Investopedia, the total number of Bitcoins that can ever exist is 21 million. As of December 18, 2023, there were 19,573,975 Bitcoins in existence. This means that there are 1,426,025 Bitcoins left to be \u201cmined.\u201d\n\nNot only is the supply limited but, like gold, the Bitcoin itself cannot be changed because of the blockchain technology used to create it. (And I\u2019ll let you delve deeper into this process on your own.)\n\nBut with a limited supply of Bitcoins, and now more access to trading/investing in it, the price has shot up dramatically in recent weeks. It is still below its all-time high of about $69,000 during the peak of the crypto rally in November 2021 but well above its recent lows of around $16,000 at end of 2022.\n\nBitcoin in your portfolio\n\nThe headline prices and coming advertisements for owning Bitcoin are sure to make you wonder whether you should be a buyer now, or maybe wait until the price drops, or get in and out for a quick trade. You can be sure that your broker or investment adviser will be making suggestions, now that the access to Bitcoin pricing is more secure and regulated \u2014 and now that these purchases create commissions!\n\nBefore taking action, you must understand your own emotional risk tolerance. Are you ready to accept the volatility \u2014 and potential losses as Bitcoin prices fluctuate based on emotions of traders? After all, Bitcoin is just a commodity, with no intrinsic use. Even gold has actual uses in jewelry and in industry.\n\nPrices of commodities fluctuate based on supply and demand realities \u2014 the impact of weather on agricultural commodities, the impact of central banks on interest rates, the impact of government policies on the value of a currency. But Bitcoin has no such basic commodity determinants; it is purely a speculation.\n\nIf you\u2019re a speculator or gambler, Bitcoin will likely be the focal point of a lot of attention in coming years \u2014 a great place to get some \u201caction.\u201d That volatility will attract traders who seek volatility, timing their moves in a disciplined manner.\n\nBut if you\u2019re a long-term investor, creating a retirement fund that will carry you through your final years, please limit your exposure to just enough to give you something to talk about at parties. It is very unlikely that Bitcoin \u2014 or any cryptocurrency \u2014 will replace the dollar in your lifetime. It\u2019s pure speculation. And that\u2019s The Savage Truth.\n\n(Terry Savage is a registered investment adviser and the author of four best-selling books, including \u201cThe Savage Truth on Money.\u201d Terry responds to questions on her blog at TerrySavage.com.)\n\n(c)2024 Terry Savage.

        "content": "Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan, took aim at Bitcoin once again during an interview with CNBC at Davos 2024 on Jan. 17.\n\nDimon expressed an unusual theory in which he suggested that Bitcoin (BTC) could be eliminated once its maximum supply is issued. He said:\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a good chance that \u2026 when we get to that 21 million Bitcoins, [Satoshi Nakamato] is going to come on there, laugh hysterically, go quiet, and all Bitcoin is going to be erased.\u201d\n\nDimon also suggested that, contrary to this, there is no guarantee that Bitcoin issuance will end once the circulating supply reaches 21 million BTC. He said:\n\n\u201cHow the hell do you know that it\u2019s going to stop at 21 [million]? I\u2019ve never met one person who told me that they know for a fact.\u201d\n\nOne of Dimon\u2019s co-panellists, CNBC Squawk Box host Joe Kernen, noted that the last Bitcoin will not be mined until about 2140 due to increasing mining difficulty. Kernen added that Bitcoin shares many economic properties with gold, to which Dimon replied, \u201cYou may be right \u2026 [but] I don\u2019t own gold either.\u201d\n\nDimon\u2019s latest statements have attracted massive backlash on social media, both due to the general inaccuracy of his theories and due to the fact that he mispronounced the first half of Satoshi Nakamoto as \u201cSatashi.\u201d\n\nBitcoin mining rules are unlikely to change\n\nDimon\u2019s theories are unfounded because Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin but does not have control over the blockchain or its miners.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 21 million maximum supply is currently hard-coded into its source code. Any change to that rule requires agreement among miners, who are unlikely to adjust the rule due to their vested interest in the current model.\n\nFurthermore, any change with less than unanimous support would cause the Bitcoin blockchain to split into two chains. To replace the main Bitcoin network and not merely create a minority chain, majority support among miners would be necessary. Bitcoin Cash (BCH), notably, was created with minority support in 2017 and remains separate from Bitcoin.\n\nFinally, the Bitcoin supply could only be destroyed if all BTC holders decided to send their funds to an irretrievable address or \u201cburn\u201d address. Though a substantial portion of the Bitcoin supply has already been sent to such addresses, partial burning only increases the value of BTC still in circulation.\n\nMentioned in this article"

However, Gautam Chhugani, lead crypto analyst at Bernstein, said the firm is still optimistic on high-quality miners, calling out Riot Platforms and CleanSpark . \"We feel confident about inflection in miner cashflows for the best-in-class miners that are consolidating capacity and seeing strong traction in revenues from higher bitcoin price and transaction fees,\" he said. \"Thus, miners would continue to offer higher beta trade to the next bitcoin inflection \u2014 in our view, post halving.\" RIOT YTD mountain Riot Platforms is down 25% this year Since spot bitcoin ETFs began trading in the U.S. last week, Riot and CleanSpark have each declined more than 20%. Marathon Digital has declined nearly 30%. Iris Energy and Cipher Mining are each lower more than 21%. The bitcoin halving \u2014 the event in which the reward for mining the cryptocurrency is cut in half \u2014 is approaching in the spring of this year. The halving also eats into bitcoin miners' revenues. Investors are watching the price of bitcoin, which was expected by some to rally after the Securities and Exchange Commission's decision to allow spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., but instead played out as a sell-the-news event. If bitcoin doesn't rise to the $50,000 to $55,000 range, less efficient, higher-cost miners may not have sufficient capital to grow and may have difficulty maintaining their operations. \"Just like bitcoin, the next two months offer dip buying opportunity in bitcoin miners,\" Chhugani said. \"To be cautious during [the] halving, some higher cost miners may struggle if bitcoin price remains flattish from here \u2014 hence, best to be exposed to low cost miners.\" Bitcoin miners were top performers in 2023, outperforming even bitcoin. Riot and CleanSpark gained 356% and 440%, respectively. Marathon swelled by 586%. Flagship crypto bitcoin finished up 157%."

        "content": "VanEck Shutters Bitcoin Futures ETF\n\nVanEck is closing its bitcoin futures ETF, barely a week after the launch of its spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund and following millions in outflows in the runup to the launch of the spot fund.\n\nThe VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF) will stop trading on Jan. 30, according to a company press release. New York-based VanEck, which manages $66.4 billion in 69 ETFs, said in the statement it\u2019s closing the fund based on an analysis of its performance, investor interest, liquidity, assets under management and other factors.\n\nThe futures fund is up 97% over the past year and has $69 million under management according to etf.com data. Yet investors pulled $14.8 million from the fund since Dec. 1 as federal regulators\u2019 deadline to approve a spot bitcoin ETF approached. Investors drained $10 million from the ETF in a single day on December 26 and drew down another $2 million on Jan. 15.\n\nThe arrival of spot bitcoin ETFs had sparked speculation about whether or not futures-based bitcoin ETFs, which have about $2 billion in assets, will survive. VanEck suggested that it had anticipated investors' preferences would transition to the spot funds.\n\n\"We believe investor appetite would switch from products offering bitcoin futures exposure to direct bitcoin exposure (such as HODL),\" VanEck director of digital assets product Kyle DaCruz wrote in an email. \"VanEck spot products should more closely track the price of bitcoin, as they don\u2019t incur the costs associated with rolling futures contracts.\"\n\nFutures ETFs also were expected to face competition from the lower fees spot funds charged.\n\n\u201cThough they\u2019ve delivered strong returns over the past year, bitcoin futures ETFs suffer from higher costs than their spot bitcoin ETF counterparts,\u201d said etf.com analyst Sumit Roy. \u201cIn particular, roll costs\u2014or the cost of rolling from one futures contract to another\u2014have dampened the ETFs\u2019 returns.\u201d\n\nWhile ETFs that track bitcoin futures have been trading since 2021, the Securities and Exchange Commission only last week approved the novel spot bitcoin ETF, which is physically backed by bitcoin and more closely tracks the asset. 11 funds were approved by the SEC, including ETFs from traditional players such as Fidelity and BlackRock. The VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL) started trading last Thursday, Jan 11.\n\nStory continues\n\nBITO\u2019s First Mover Advantage\n\nThe largest bitcoin futures ETF is the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which saw huge first mover advantage from being the first futures product to hit the market.\n\n\u201cWhile most bitcoin futures ETF will likely shutter, BITO has been remarkably resilient so far and still boats nearly $2 billion in assets under management, a reflection of its strong liquidity and first-mover advantage,\u201d said Roy.\n\nContact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com.

After gaining approval, the new instruments began trading last week.\n\nAs Tuesday trading came to a close, the three top funds had generated about $1.6 billion of the $1.8 billion of total trading volume, according to data from Yahoo Finance compiled by The Block.\n\nThe third day of trading finished well below the $3.1 billion seen on Friday. On last Thursday, the first day of trading, the total volume came in at $4.6 billion.\n\nBlackRock may become 'Liquidity King'\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nWhile Grayscale has been the clear leader in terms of volume among the new crypto-based instruments, the firm's ETF, which is a conversion of its flagship flagship GBTC fund, has experienced considerable outflows, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.\n\nGrayscale's spot bitcoin ETF has shed more than $500 million since it started trading last week, according to Balchunas, who posted data to the social media platform X on Tuesday. BlackRock's ETF is the \"most likely to overtake\" Grayscale as \"Liquidity King,\" he also said.\n\nThe funds offered by BlackRock and Fidelity have, in comparison, seen inflows over $400 million since they began trading.\n\nOverall, Balchunas said trading activity for the new funds was healthy. Cumulative volume over the first three days is now over $9.5 billion.\n\n\n\n\"About the same pattern dropoff rate as $BITO (which again was the most successful organic launch in ETF history),\" Balchunas added.\n\n(Updates with figures from market closing.)"

        "content": "Kraken, one of the world's largest crypto exchanges, saw investors convert over $1 billion in Bitcoin to cash before a recent SEC Ruling on Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nCrypto investors withdrew over $1 billion worth of Bitcoin and converted it to cash on the Kraken exchange shortly before the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) recent ruling allowing spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nThe withdrawals/conversions were conducted throughout more than three dozen transactions between Jan. 7 and Jan. 9. The moves were first reported on the blockchain monitor Whale Alert. The transaction amounts were between 400 and 1,000 Bitcoins.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nMassive cryptocurrency withdrawals are not always breaking news, but several aspects of these trades stand out. First, they all came within a short timeframe. Second, these transactions were all closed in the waning hours before a major SEC ruling regarding Bitcoin. It has led some to wonder whether these crypto investors knew something other people didn't, or if they were hedging bets by taking profits while they still could.\n\nWhy Is The SEC Ruling Important?\n\nThe SEC allowing spot Bitcoin ETF trading marks a major expansion in the way people can invest in Bitcoin. The traditional model of buying, trading or selling Bitcoin required traders to have a crypto wallet, which was held on a crypto exchange such as Kraken. These exchanges, which are not regulated by the SEC, operate on blockchain technology to secure investor deposits.\n\nHowever, some exchanges were better than others, and if an investor\u2019s crypto wallet was on an exchange that failed, they could lose all their funds and have little recourse. This kind of volatility and risk was an obvious deterrent to many potential cryptocurrency investors. The new SEC ruling means investors can purchase cryptocurrency without being part of a cryptocurrency exchange because they can buy cryptocurrency ETFs through traditional brokerages.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhere Can Investors Buy Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nBitcoin ETFs will be listed on the following exchanges:\n\nNYSE Arca: Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF (DEFI)\n\nCboe BZX Exchange Inc.: ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO), VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL), WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC)\n\nNasdaq Stock Exchange: iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR)\n\nCould This Lead To A New High For Bitcoin?\n\nMany observers are expecting a multibillion-dollar cash infusion into the various Bitcoin ETFs now that investors can invest in Bitcoin by simply calling their broker. This could lead to an explosion in Bitcoin value, which has rallied strongly from the low $20,000 range last January to roughly $45,000. Although the current price is still lower than the all-time high, the influx of investor capital could surpass that mark.\n\nThe War For Investors Is Afoot\n\nNow that Bitcoin ETFs are authorized to trade, it would appear as if the cryptocurrency is here to stay. It also means that the various funds are in a knock-down, drag-out fight for the biggest share of new investors jumping into the pool. Even before the SEC approved them to operate, the soon-to-be-approved funds were in a race to the bottom in terms of fees.\n\nOn top of that, they are also whale hunting. The real honey for many of these funds will be the institutional investors, who can pledge hundreds of millions (or more) all at the same time. This may be a great opportunity for interested investors to consider Bitcoin ETFs while the fees are still low, which certainly won't last.\n\nIs Now The Time To Jump In On Bitcoin?\n\nThe important thing to keep in mind is that even with SEC approval, a Bitcoin ETF is a basket full of cryptocurrencies. So, while the potential exists for cryptocurrency to rocket to all-time highs, getting caught on the downside of that wave cresting can be devastating. For example, if you bought Bitcoin at $65,000, you're still waiting to make a profit despite the massive rally in 2023.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Investors In Kraken Crypto Exchange Converted Over $1 Billion In Bitcoin To Cash Before SEC Ruling On Spot Bitcoin ETFs originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Bitcoin's network hashrate declined by approximately 25% over the past few days amid curtailment requests from the Texas grid regulator following a recent cold snap, with the U.S. state now established as a global hub for the industry.\n\nData from MiningPoolStats and Blockchain.com show global hashrate estimates fell from around 600 EH/s on Friday to 450 EH/s by Tuesday, coinciding with a weather warning for Jan. 14 to 17 issued by ERCOT due to extreme cold weather across the region. ERCOT, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, operates as the grid regulator for most of the state.\n\nERCOT\u2019s warning was followed by official conservation appeals on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. \"Operating reserves are expected to be low tomorrow morning due to continued freezing temperatures, record-breaking demand and unseasonably low wind. We request Texas businesses and residents conserve electricity use, if safe to do so,\" ERCOT said. Yesterday\u2019s most recent curtailment request ended at 9 a.m. CT.\n\nThe hashrate reduction implies more than four gigawatts of power capacity was curtailed during the period, TheMinerMag previously reported.\n\nMiners pointing toward Foundry USA Pool \u2014 one of the largest mining pool operators by hashrate \u2014 appeared to be responsible for around half of the decline, dropping from an estimated 155 EH/s on Friday to 77 EH/s yesterday, before recovering, according to MiningPoolStats.\n\nLuxor Mining Pool\u2019s users were also impacted by the cold snap, as was the Bitcoin mining firm Marathon Digital. \"Luxor mining partners have significantly curtailed their operations, shutting down machines to give back power allocation to the grid over the last few days,\" Luxor Technology Chief Operating Officer Ethan Vera told The Block.\n\n\"Many Bitcoin miners in Texas, Marathon included, have curtailed operations over the past few days to support the Texas grid and the state's citizens during the current cold outbreak, and that's exactly how this should be working,\" Marathon VP of Corporate Communications Charlie Schumacher added. \"Bitcoin miners are, among other things, a technology solution for the energy sector. In Texas, they serve as baseload that can be curtailed in minutes to free up energy for others in a time of crisis. That's exactly what we've seen play out over the past few days.\"\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nTexas emerges as Bitcoin mining hub following China\u2019s crackdown\n\nChina-based Bitcoin miners previously led the world in terms of total hashrate. That dominance plummeted in 2021 following shutdown orders from regulators as the country launched a crackdown against the industry.\n\nTexas emerged as an alternative hub, with miners arguing at the time that mining is just as good for Texas as Texas is for miners since the flexibility of the industry's electricity use can strengthen the state\u2019s power grid, curtailing demand during peaks and injecting it during troughs.\n\nFirms including Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms and Iris Energy are among those who have added to the concentration of Bitcoin mining facilities in Texas over recent years, attracted by cheap electricity, grid incentives and the state's deregulated energy market. A report by Foundry in September said U.S.-based Bitcoin miners using its pool in Texas accounted for 28.5% of its hashrate in the country, the largest share among states by some margin and up more than two times from 8.4% in 2021.\n\nTexas Bitcoin miners are no strangers to curtailment requests in the state either. In August, Riot Platforms received a new monthly record $31.7 million worth of power and demand response credits, administered by ERCOT, after cutting its power usage by over 95% during the summer heatwave. Iris Energy also received $2.3 million in energy credits in the same month, primarily driven by voluntary curtailment at its Childress site in Texas.\n\nUpdated with additional comment from Marathon Digital."

        "content": "It finally happened. After years of refusing the approve spot bitcoin ETFs, the SEC finally approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nTo me, it made no sense that the SEC previously allowed futures-based bitcoin ETFs but not ETFs that actually owned the bitcoin. Futures-based bitcoin ETFs must roll futures contracts monthly. In a previous interview two years ago, Bitwise chief investment officer, Matthew Hougan, told me they faced a 10% annualized head wind due to the futures churning that would be necessary had they issued a futures-based bitcoin ETF. The expense ratio of the previous futures-based bitcoin ETF is only the tip of the iceberg.\n\nOn January 10th, the SEC issued its approval. Investors poured $4.7 billion in the first day. The new ETFs are as follows:\n\nHougan wrote on X, formerly Twitter, \u201cThe lowest-cost Bitcoin ETF in America: BITB. 0.20% expense ratio, waived to 0.00% for the first six months.\n\nAllan Roth's Bitcoin POV\n\nIt often surprises people when I tell them I\u2019ve owned a tiny bit of bitcoin for over six years. When it surges, my brain on bitcoin goes wild and tells me to buy more. My logical side of the brain stops me. As of now, I\u2019ve had roughly a 1,000% return\u2014far more than my equity ETFs.\n\nHow much will bitcoin be worth in a decade? Will it become the new digital gold or go the way of the tulips during the famed Dutch Tulip bubble of the 1600s? I readily admit that don\u2019t know, but a couple years ago Hougan told me:\n\nThere\u2019s a good likelihood bitcoin will emerge as a significant non-sovereign digital store of value, akin to or in rivalry with gold.\n\nThere\u2019s a small likelihood (like a cheap, out-of-the-money call option) that it becomes the transactional backbone for Finance 2.0.\n\nThere\u2019s a low or zero likelihood that it will be used as a currency to buy things like coffee or lunch.\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has been slamming bitcoin for years as a fraud saying, \u201cIt\u2019s just not a real thing; eventually it will be closed.\u201d\n\nSince, as I mentioned, I don\u2019t know what will happen, I advise clients to invest a small portion, no more than 2% of their portfolio, in crypto but they have to request it and commit to staying in it for the long-haul. If it surges in the long run, they can feel great about it. If it plunges, they can be glad they invested 2% or less.\n\nShould You Buy a Spot Bitcoin ETF?\n\nI think the spot bitcoin ETFs are so much better than the futures-based ETFs and applaud Bitwise for both not pursuing a futures-based ETF and launching what is currently the lowest cost spot ETF. If I were going to buy a bitcoin ETF, BITB would be my choice.\n\nBut, since I believe any allocation to bitcoin should be long-term, I wonder why one would pay the expense ratio at all and instead just buy bitcoin directly. I\u2019m also not a fan of buying gold but have written that it\u2019s better to buy gold coins than pay an expense ratio for decades. The same logic goes for bitcoin.\n\nThe one difference between buying gold and bitcoin directly is the security aspect. If you lose your key to the bank safe deposit box, you can pay to get a new one to get the gold coins you stored. If you lose your private key to your bitcoin wallet, it\u2019s gone permanently. And, of course, any digital asset can be stolen by cyber criminals.\n\nMy Conclusion\n\nBecause the new spot bitcoin fees can be fairly low, I\u2019m softening my views on bitcoin ETFs. For someone who wants both a little bit of bitcoin and simplicity, I\u2019d tell them to go ahead and buy the lowest cost reputable spot bitcoin ETF, with the caveat that they should hold it for the long-run."

        "title": "SEC Approves Exchange Listing Applications for Spot Bitcoin ETPs - JD Supra",
        "content": "On January 10, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) issued an order approving the applications of 11 different spot Bitcoin exchange\u2011traded products (the \u201cApproved ETPs\u201d) to each list and trade their shares on a national securities exchange.[1] As a result, each Approved ETP is expected to commence trading on either the NYSE Arca, Inc., The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, or Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. The SEC Order represents the first time that the SEC has permitted the listing of an exchange\u2011traded product (\u201cETP\u201d) that invests directly in a cryptocurrency \u2014 here, Bitcoin (\u201cspot crypto ETPs\u201d).\n\nBackground\n\nThe order is an important development for both asset managers and the crypto industry. Before the SEC Order, the only cryptocurrency\u2011related ETPs that the SEC had permitted to trade on national securities exchanges were those that invested primarily in cryptocurrency\u2011derived futures (\u201ccrypto futures ETPs\u201d), rather than cryptocurrencies acquired directly on the spot market. Mutual funds and exchange\u2011traded funds (\u201cETFs\u201d) have been (and remain) similarly limited.[2]\n\nIn rejecting prior listing applications for spot crypto ETPs, the SEC cited concerns regarding whether the rules of the exchanges on which such ETPs were proposed to be listed were adequately \u201cdesigned to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices\u201d as is required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). Spot crypto ETPs have attempted to satisfy this requirement by asserting that the exchange in question had a comprehensive surveillance\u2011sharing agreement with a \u201cregulated market of significant size\u201d related to the underlying cryptocurrency assets (most typically for spot Bitcoin ETPs, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange\u2019s (\u201cCME\u201d) Bitcoin futures market). The SEC rejected these arguments on the basis that applicants failed to demonstrate that the CME constitutes a regulated market of sufficient size for these purposes (the so\u2011called \u201csignificant market test\u201d).\n\nIn August 2023, the U.S. District of Columbia Court of Appeals (\u201cDC Circuit\u201d) issued an order vacating the SEC\u2019s rejection of the listing application for Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (\u201cGBTC\u201d) and remanded the matter to the SEC for further consideration.[3] The Court held that the SEC\u2019s rejection of spot Bitcoin ETP applications such as GBTC\u2019s was arbitrary and capricious in view of the fact that the SEC had permitted Bitcoin futures ETPs to be listed, that such Bitcoin futures ETPs functioned similarly enough to spot Bitcoin ETPs that they appeared to be entitled to similar regulatory treatment, and that the SEC had failed to provide a reasonable and coherent explanation of the difference in its treatment of spot Bitcoin ETPs compared to Bitcoin futures ETPs.\n\nIt is fair to surmise, however, that the SEC\u2019s failure to approve spot crypto ETPs\u2019 listing applications was not capricious, but instead evidenced a policy determination to prevent the widespread exposure of retail investors to cryptocurrencies that the public trading of spot crypto ETPs would facilitate. The SEC had already effectively limited registered funds to obtaining exposure to cryptocurrencies through the futures market[4] and appears to have sought to extend this limitation to unregistered spot crypto ETPs by refusing to permit exchanges to list them. The line drawn by the SEC for ETPs that seemed rational under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d) given the investor protection issues in play (custody, liquidity, pricing, etc.) may not appear rational under the exchange listing standards applicable under the Exchange Act.\n\nThe SEC Order\n\nLast week, almost five months after the DC Circuit issued its opinion, the SEC changed its mind and approved the listing orders. The Commission, on a 3\u20112 vote, concluded that there was a sufficient correlation between prices on the spot Bitcoin market and those of Bitcoin futures traded on the CME that the CME could reasonably be able to surveil for market manipulation and fraud. The SEC Order also noted that existing regulation under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the \u201cAdvisers Act\u201d) and Regulation BI under the Exchange Act, will apply to market intermediaries that recommend investments in spot crypto ETPs, which will further protect retail investors from the risks associated with Bitcoin.\n\nCommissioner Crenshaw dissented, agreeing with the DC Circuit that the SEC, like other administrative agencies, must treat like cases alike, but arguing that there were important differences between direct investments in Bitcoin on the spot market and Bitcoin\u2011derived futures that implicated investor protections. She asserted that investments in futures contracts have a primary regulator, unlike the spot market for Bitcoin, which she described as an \u201cunregulated, fragmented, continuously traded, global free\u2011for\u2011all. . . much [of which] could be beyond the reach of U.S. regulation.\u201d She pointed out that even if the CME could detect fraud or manipulation in the spot Bitcoin market, neither it nor the SEC may have authority to do anything about it. She expressed particular concern that shares of spot Bitcoin ETPs will find their way into IRAs and other retirement plans.\n\nChair Gensler, in his statement supporting the order, pointed out that retail investors could already invest directly in Bitcoin on the spot market in various ways, including through payment apps, without any investor protections. Investors in spot Bitcoin ETPs, he asserted, would have better access to disclosure about the risks of their investments and the protections of the securities laws regulating broker\u2011dealers and investment advisers, which address conflicts of interest.\n\nImpact on Investment Managers\n\nThe SEC Order is significant for sponsors of registered investment companies, which will be able to offer spot Bitcoin ETPs side\u2011by\u2011side with their registered exchange\u2011traded funds. The ETPs will provide retail investors a more convenient way to access the cryptocurrency market and are anticipated to broaden investor participation in these markets. Because there is a fixed amount of Bitcoin available, any appreciable increase in demand should translate to an increase in valuation of Bitcoin. Indeed, the market for Bitcoin began to appreciate in anticipation of the SEC Order.\n\nThere are still issues left unaddressed by the SEC Order that will confront spot crypto ETP sponsors, including:\n\nWill the SEC issue orders approving the listing of spot crypto ETPs that invest in Ethereum or other cryptocurrencies? Critical to the SEC\u2019s decision would seem to be whether the agency will want to conclude, as it has with respect to Bitcoin, that a particular cryptocurrency is not a security and thus would also not be subject to the Investment Company Act. To date, it has been reluctant to do so, and we expect that reticence to continue. If it does not approve the use of other cryptocurrencies, it may provide Bitcoin with a monopoly on access to a large part of the retail market that seeks exposure to cryptocurrencies.\n\nWill registered funds, which largely have been limited to obtaining exposure to Bitcoin through futures, begin investing in shares of spot Bitcoin ETPs, subject to Investment Company Act ownership limitations and sorting out any relevant tax issues?\n\nWill advisers, trust departments and other fiduciaries get comfortable recommending individual clients allocate a portion of their portfolios in spot Bitcoin ETPs?\n\nWhat amount of management fees and expenses can be charged to investors, and will sponsorship of spot Bitcoin ETPs be profitable? Almost immediately after the SEC Order was issued, some sponsors began promoting a temporary waiver of all fees for at least a limited period.\n\nGiven their greater liquidity and lower fees, will institutional investors gravitate to the spot Bitcoin ETP and away from existing private crypto fund structures and will those private crypto fund managers likely focus on other cryptocurrencies or a portfolio of multiple cryptocurrencies?\n\nWhile the SEC will not have examination authority of Bitcoin ETPs (they are not investment companies), the agency will have authority to examine the ETPs\u2019 advisers, which are all likely to be registered under the Advisers Act. What will examiners of spot Bitcoin ETPs expect of their advisers as well as those advisers that recommend clients invest in such ETPs? These advisers should anticipate that compliance matters relating to investments in or the management of spot Bitcoin ETPs will likely be subject to heightened SEC scrutiny for at least the near future.\n\n________________\n\n[1] See Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Changes, as Modified by Amendments Thereto, to List and Trade Bitcoin\u2011Based Commodity\u2011Based Trust Shares and Trust Units, Release Nos. 34\u201199306, SR\u2011NYSEARCA\u20112021\u201190; SR\u2011NYSEARCA\u20112023\u201144; SR\u2011NYSEARCA\u20112023\u201158; SR\u2011NASDAQ\u20112023\u2011016; SR\u2011NASDAQ\u20112023\u2011019; SR\u2011CboeBZX\u20112023\u2011028; SR\u2011CboeBZX\u20112023\u2011038; SR\u2011CboeBZX\u20112023\u2011040; SR\u2011CboeBZX\u20112023\u2011042; SR\u2011CboeBZX\u20112023\u2011044; SR\u2011CboeBZX\u20112023\u2011072 (January 10, 2024) (the \u201cSEC Order\u201d).\n\nThe Approved ETPs are: (1) ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, (2) Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, (3) Franklin Bitcoin ETF, (4) Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, (5) Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, (6) Hashdex Bitcoin ETF, (7) Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, (8) iShares Bitcoin Trust, (9) Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund, (10) VanEck Bitcoin Trust, and (11) WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund.\n\n[2] Staff Statement on Funds Registered Under the Investment Company Act Investing in the Bitcoin Futures Market, Division of investment Management Staff, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (May 11, 2021) (the \u201c2021 Staff Letter\u201d).\n\n[3] Grayscale Investments, LLC v.

        "content": "Which spot bitcoin ETF is best? Are bitcoin investments right for your portfolio? While all the new bitcoin funds track the same benchmark asset, there are several key aspects, such as expense ratios and liquidity, for investors to know and understand before buying shares.\n\nWhat Is a Spot Bitcoin ETF?\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF, which first began trading on U.S. exchanges Jan. 11, 2024, is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of bitcoin by directly holding the cryptocurrency itself, unlike futures-based bitcoin ETFs that had already been trading on exchanges since 2021.\n\nWhen an investor buys shares of a spot bitcoin ETF, they are buying a portion of the bitcoin held by the fund. Thus, a spot bitcoin fund works in a similar way as a physically backed gold ETF.\n\nHow to Choose the Best Spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nChoosing the best spot bitcoin ETF involves several factors related to the fund\u2019s expenses, assets under management, liquidity and other factors. Here are some key steps to help you select the right bitcoin spot ETF:\n\nExpense ratio: Compare the expense ratios of different spot bitcoin ETFs. Lower expenses are generally more favorable for investors, as they directly affect the overall return, and they are especially relevant for comparing ETFs that track the same benchmark asset.\n\nCompare the expense ratios of different spot bitcoin ETFs. Lower expenses are generally more favorable for investors, as they directly affect the overall return, and they are especially relevant for comparing ETFs that track the same benchmark asset. Size of the fund (AUM): Higher assets under management, or AUM, may indicate greater investor confidence and acceptance of the ETF, and higher assets generally translate to greater liquidity and higher trading volume.\n\nHigher assets under management, or AUM, may indicate greater investor confidence and acceptance of the ETF, and higher assets generally translate to greater liquidity and higher trading volume. Liquidity: Higher liquidity typically results in narrower bid-ask spreads, reducing trading costs for investors.\n\nHigher liquidity typically results in narrower bid-ask spreads, reducing trading costs for investors. Issuer reputation: Choose a spot bitcoin ETF from a reputable issuer with a track record of managing exchange-traded funds, specifically crypto-related ETFs and spot commodity funds. Well-established issuers often have the expertise and infrastructure to manage assets effectively and have demonstrated their ability to track benchmark assets and indexes tightly.\n\nList of Spot Bitcoin ETFs Available to Investors\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nHow Can Investors Buy Spot Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nLike buying other types of ETFs, investors need an investment account to buy spot bitcoin ETFs. However, unlike traditional ETFs, spot bitcoin funds are not available at all brokerage firms, so you\u2019ll need to verify that your broker offers these funds on their platform. Like investing in stocks or mutual funds, the investment account may be an individual brokerage account, a joint brokerage account, or any variety of individual retirement account (IRA).\n\nOnce you have the investment account open, you will need to fund it with cash, and you\u2019ll be ready to invest in a spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe basic steps to invest in ETFs are:\n\nOpen an investment account. Fund the investment account with cash. Select the ETF(s) to purchase. Execute the trade(s) to buy shares.\n\nAre Spot Bitcoin ETFs Better Than Futures-Based Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs will likely provide tighter tracking of bitcoin's price with potentially less volatility compared to futures-based funds. For reference, in 2023, the largest bitcoin futures ETF, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) gained 137% while bitcoin's price rose 160%.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that neither fund type is suitable for an investor\u2019s portfolio. Both types of them have significant inherent risks. As always, choosing an investment depends on an investor\u2019s individual goals and risk tolerance.\n\nFor more details, see our article, Spot Bitcoin ETFs vs Bitcoin Futures ETFs.\n\nIs a Spot Bitcoin ETF a Good Investment?\n\nWhether a spot bitcoin ETF is a good investment depends heavily on an individual's financial situation, risk tolerance and investment goals. For example, the volatile nature of bitcoin\u2019s price generally makes a spot bitcoin fund unsuitable for a risk-averse investor with short-term investment goals, whereas an aggressive investor with high risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon may choose to add a spot bitcoin ETF to their portfolio.\n\nNo matter the investor\u2019s degree of risk tolerance, financial advisors generally recommend no more than 5% portfolio allocation to high-risk investment types, such as technology sector funds and crypto-related securities.\n\nAlways conduct thorough research, and if needed, consult with a financial advisor to ensure that the chosen spot bitcoin ETF aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, stay updated on market conditions and the performance of the ETF over time."

He said that while listings from investment providers such as BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale were approved, \"investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with Bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto\".\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is the world's oldest and best-known cryptocurrency.\n\nIt is a digital token that was launched in 2008 by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, explained BBC News, and \"remains the most valuable and famous\".\n\nThe price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is very volatile though, depending on supply, demand and sentiment. The Bitcoin price hit $70,000 or \u00a350,000 in 2021, before falling to $16,000 in 2022 \"as scandals shook the industry\", but in recent months it has risen \"steadily\" to around $44,000.\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin ETF?\n\nAn ETF aims to replicate the performance of a broad index such as the FTSE 100 or individual assets such as shares or bonds.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF gives investors a \"regulated way to gain exposure without needing to hold it directly\", said The Times.\n\nCryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are unregulated, so there is no investor protection if a trading platform collapses or your money is stolen.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF gives you exposure to the cryptocurrency's \"huge swings in value\", added The Times, but in theory you are still protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme if the investment firm behind the ETF were to fail.\n\nThe SEC approval doesn't remove the volatility of Bitcoin though, added MoneyWeek, as the price is \"still subject to wild price swings depending on sentiment and there are risks of big losses\".\n\nWho can invest in a Bitcoin ETF?\n\nThe latest Bitcoin ETFs are only available to US investors.\n\nThere would be \"regulatory hurdles\" to selling a Bitcoin ETF to UK investors, said Financial News. US-based ETFS are \"not permitted\" to be sold to UK investors, so asset managers would have to launch \"specifically tailored\" products for the UK or European market.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has already \"cracked down\" on crypto marketing and banned the sale of crypto-backed exchange traded products to UK investors, added ThisIsMoney, and has \"made it clear\" that it thinks there are risks that come with cryptocurrency investing. This makes the path to any UK approval \"a long one\".\n\nThere are other ways for UK crypto fans to get exposure to Bitcoin.\n\nOne option is to invest directly in Bitcoin through an FCA-regulated platform, said Morningstar, or \"for those feeling somewhat more cautious\", you could buy shares of companies involved or exposed to cryptocurrency mining or blockchain.\n\nExisting crypto investors may also benefit from more money going into Bitcoin, added MoneyWeek, \"but it also risks making the value more volatile\"."

        "content": "The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) transferred 8,730 Bitcoin (BTC), worth over $376 million, to Coinbase Prime deposit addresses on Jan. 16, according to data from blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence.\n\nThe transfers imply that the fund may have been forced to sell some of its Bitcoin as its share price declined.\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust outflows on Jan. 16. Source: Arkham Intelligence\n\nSome analysts have argued that outflows from the trust are weighing on Bitcoin\u2019s price and are partially responsible for its decline over the past few days. Despite the outflows, the price of Bitcoin appears to have stabilized during mid-day United States trading hours on Jan. 16.\n\nBitcoin one-day price chart. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is one of the world's largest single holders of BTC. Prior to Jan. 11, most investors in the fund could not redeem their shares for Bitcoin or a cash equivalent. But beginning on Jan. 11, the trust was converted into an exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nSince then, authorized participants have been allowed to buy up shares from investors and redeem them for the cash equivalent of the Bitcoin these shares represent. When they do so, the trust is required to sell off BTC to pay these recipients. This process generally only occurs when the price of GBTC is lower than the value of the BTC it represents.\n\nAccording to Arkham data, on Jan. 12 the trust transferred $41 million to a Coinbase Prime wallet, implying that the trust may have sold BTC. Some traders speculated that this outflow may have caused Bitcoin\u2019s sharp price decline that day.\n\nAlso on Jan. 12, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas claimed in a post to X (formerly Twitter) that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust experienced a total of $95.1 million of outflows on Jan. 11 and $484.1 million on Jan. 12 by the close of trading. Balchunas cited Bloomberg Terminal as his source.\n\nRelated: Grayscale was key to BTC ETF approval \u2014 Crypto Mom\n\nBalchunas also claimed that other Bitcoin ETFs, such as the iShares Bitcoin Trust and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, received inflows of nearly $1.4 billion over the course of these two days. After accounting for GBTC\u2019s outflows, this implies that the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market experienced net inflows of more than $818 million over the first two days of its trading despite the broader Bitcoin market facing losses during the same period.\n\nOn Jan. 16, Arkham data showed further outflows of $376 million BTC from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust by 7:17 pm UTC. The U.S. stock market closes at 9:00 pm UTC.\n\nSome traders blame the higher GBTC fees for the outflows. GBTC charges a 1.5% management fee, which critics say is higher than most of its competitors."

        "content": "A \u201cparadigm shift\u201d in the perception and use of digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could threaten the dominance of the United States dollar as a global currency, warns Wall Street investment bank Morgan Stanley.\n\nWhile the U.S. dollar makes up roughly 60% of global foreign exchange reserves, a \u201cparadigm shift in the global perception and use of digital assets\u201d could challenge the dollar\u2019s leadership, wrote Morgan Stanley\u2019s head of digital assets, Andrew Peel, in a Jan. 12 investment note.\n\nPeel said the shift has now been significantly accelerated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange\u2019s approval of several spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S., with weekly inflows into the new products topping $1.18 billion.\n\nAdditionally, Peel looked to Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cremarkable\u201d global adoption over the past 15 years as evidence for its continual growth, noting that 106 million people around the world currently hold the cryptocurrency and added that there are now Bitcoin ATMs in more than 80 countries.\n\nMeanwhile, other countries\u2019 CBDCs could also impact the dollar\u2019s dominance, which would enable speedy cross-border payments without the need for a common currency.\n\n\u201c[CBDCs] hold the potential to establish a unified standard for cross-border payments, which could diminish the reliance on traditional intermediaries like SWIFT and the use of dominant currencies such as the dollar.\u201d\n\nAccording to data from the Atlantic Council CBDC Tracker, 130 countries \u2014 representing over 98% of global gross domestic product \u2014 are exploring or developing CBDCs, marking an outsized increase from just a few years ago.\n\n130 countries are currently in the process of exploring a CBDC.
