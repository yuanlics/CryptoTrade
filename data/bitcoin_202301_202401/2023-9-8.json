        "title": "Texas Paid a Bitcoin Miner $31.7 Million to Use Less Electricity - Texas Monthly",
        "content": "After the deadly statewide power outage in 2021, academics, experts, and politicians floated a lot of blue-sky ideas about how to keep the Texas power grid running in all kinds of weather. Some were practical, such as increasing transmission capacity to use all of the solar and wind energy the state is capable of producing, while others were downright fanciful: what if, Ted Cruz posited, we relied on Bitcoin miners to help save the grid?\n\nTexas is, of course, a fanciful place, and while we\u2019ve yet to substantially scale up transmission, that Bitcoin idea won the support of Governor Greg Abbott\u2014and the Texas Legislature, which passed two mining-friendly bills in the last session\u2014and has gone from a bizarre idea to, essentially, plan A for preventing blackouts. Here\u2019s what the junior senator had to say about it back in 2021: \u201cBecause of the ability of Bitcoin mining to turn on or off instantaneously, if you have a moment where there\u2019s a power shortage in a power crisis, whether it is a freeze or some other natural disaster where power-generation capacity goes down . . . they become excess reserves that can strengthen the grid\u2019s resilience by providing a significant capacity of additional power to be available for critical services if and when it\u2019s needed.\u201d\n\nAccording to a press release issued Wednesday from large-scale Bitcoin mining operation Riot, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, a state entity that manages the grid, paid Colorado-based Riot $31.7 million in energy credits to power down its computers during peak demand in August. On the bright side: the grid held, and we didn\u2019t experience rolling blackouts (to say nothing of the sort of huge failure we saw in 2021). On the other hand: that\u2019s $31.7 million handed over to just one Bitcoin miner, which we all pay for through our electric bills. And Riot is but one of several big Bitcoin miners operating in the state\u2014not to mention the smaller operations\u2014though we won\u2019t know how much those companies have been paid until they make announcements of their own. On Wednesday, Riot CEO Jason Les boasted about the company\u2019s \u201cunique power strategy.\u201d During the rest of the month, when Riot was performing its core operation\u2014mining Bitcoin\u2014it created $8.59 million worth of the cryptocurrency.\n\nPopular Videos Previous Next more\n\n\u201cBitcoin mining\u201d obfuscates what\u2019s actually happening here. Bitcoin \u201cmines\u201d are actually math problems that escalate in complexity as more coins enter circulation, and which require immense amounts of computing power to solve. That work takes place in expensively air-conditioned data centers the size of large warehouses. As the equations are solved, new bitcoins are minted, and they become the property of the person or entity whose computers found the solution.\n\nBitcoin mining is a significant driver of energy demand in the state, accounting for as much as two gigawatts of power\u2014or enough to power about 200 million LED lightbulbs. Using large amounts of electricity, and then agreeing to turn off that electricity when the state\u2019s total demand exceeds supply in exchange for millions of ratepayer dollars in payouts, doesn\u2019t seem fair to the rest of us, who just want to keep the lights on and the AC blowing.\n\nRiot operates two Bitcoin-mining facilities: one in Rockdale, between Austin and College Station, and one in Corsicana, between Dallas and Waco. On the one hand, the strategy of paying Bitcoin miners such as Riot to turn off their computers when Texas needs the electricity for other businesses and homes appears to be helping to prevent rolling blackouts. On the other hand, the resulting situation, in which it\u2019s vastly more profitable for Bitcoin miners to turn off their business than to actually operate that business, creates some curious incentives.\n\nAccording to Riot, the company mined 333 bitcoins in August. Bitcoin prices fluctuate. In the past month, its value has ranged from around $25,000 per coin to $30,000 (at press time, a single bitcoin was worth $25,757). At its 2021 peak, a single bitcoin was worth nearly $69,000, more than double today\u2019s price. Because the complexity of the problems that Bitcoin miners must solve keeps increasing, back in 2021 it was less energy-intensive to mine a coin. Now it requires more energy to produce something less valuable.\n\nIn July, when the grid was under less-severe strain, Riot mined 410 bitcoins, worth around $10.5 million, and the company received an additional $7.8 million from ERCOT. When things started to heat up in August, though, and the ERCOT power credits really started flowing, Riot lucked out\u2014it became significantly more lucrative to power down than to mine Bitcoin, and the number it produced dropped by nearly 20 percent. In a traditional situation, that sort of drop in productivity, along with the dip in market value Bitcoin experienced in August, would mean a company in the Bitcoin business was having a bad month. Instead, Riot sent out press releases touting the rewards it received for unplugging its machines for a while. While the press release doesn\u2019t attribute the difference in the number of bitcoins produced to Riot\u2019s participation in ERCOT\u2019s \u201cdemand response\u201d program or the power credits it received, the correlation seems clear: for Riot, Bitcoin in August was literally not worth the energy used to produce it."

This bitcoin miner posted record profit, apparently all due to the heat.\n\nGetting paid to power down. This bitcoin miner posted record profit, apparently all due to the heat.\n\nA Bitcoin mining company with operations in Texas earned a record profit of $31.7 million in energy credits for reducing its power usage during the continuously high temperatures in August.\n\nJason Les, CEO of Riots Platforms, Inc. called August a \"landmark month\" after being paid through the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT's, demand response program.\n\nERCOT, who runs the state's power grid and has come under fire since the electricity failure during 2021's winter freeze, will pay entities, or in this case, miners like Riot who use a lot of power, to cut back during periods of peak demand, and hopefully, ease stress on the grid.\n\nRiot said in a release that it curbed its power usage by more than 95% during those peak periods, \"forgoing revenue from its Bitcoin mining operations to instead provide energy resources to ERCOT.\"\n\n\"The Company's curtailment of operations meaningfully contributed to reducing overall power demand in ERCOT, helping to ensure that consumers did not experience interruptions in service,\" the release said.\n\nTexans were asked to conserve many times last month, but as one energy expert explained it, ERCOT will call on large load carriers that have a contract with them to turn off at strategic times to help with generation.\n\n\"A normal conservation is hey can you turn up your A/C bit, try not to use your dryer, turn off the oven. An EEA2 action is they went and took an action and said, 'Hey, we're going to go and have these loads turn off to free up the grid,\" said David Kinchen, CEO of Energy Ogre.\n\nAs our partners at chron.com point out, Texas had made itself a welcome place for bitcoin miners, so much so that mining accounts for a large chunk of the state's consumption. For example, in 2022, bitcoin projects accounted for 33 gigawatts of energy compared to all Houston households combined using an estimated six gigawatts per year.\n\nCNBC did an even deeper dive into the payout and Riot's operations, noting that Riot has been powering down at its mine an hour north of Austin to help lessen the burden on the grid.\n\nThe boost from ERCOT also helped Riot at a time when it's been facing millions of dollars in losses."

        "content": "Alexander Spatari | Moment | Getty Images\n\nLISBON, PORTUGAL \u2014 Matadors and bitcoin maximalists are regulars at Campo Pequeno, a neo-Moorish bullring in the northernmost reaches of the Portuguese capital city. The two aren't all that different. Both are typically defiant and stubborn, engaged in a seemingly hopeless battle that pits man against beast, where the goal isn't just survival but total domination. Each fights against the status quo \u2014 one against the laws of nature, the other against the financial establishment. In the case of the maxis, these rebels don cryptographic code instead of capes, pinning their revolution on the decentralized ledger technology they believe will change the world as we know it. Every month, bitcoin's biggest fans in Lisbon \u2014 an eclectic bunch of mostly expat digital nomads \u2014 descend on this 19th century arena to sip Licor Beir\u00e3o, talk shop and extol the virtues of a world run on bitcoin. The storied venue is also a fitting metaphor for the bull run that many of these bitcoiners hold out hope for during crypto winter, the name given to the period of prolonged, depressed pricing in digital assets that can last for years.\n\nSoftware engineer Lorenzo Primiterra has been living mostly in Lisbon for the past two years. CNBC\n\nSoftware engineer Lorenzo Primiterra has been going to the gatherings since they began. He's a Peter Pan-type with black chipped nail polish and small black hoop earrings complimenting the tattoo on his right inner forearm that reads, in all caps, 'WHAT'S MY AGE AGAIN?\" Primiterra hails from Italy but has spent two of his last seven years on the road in Portugal. Sitting at a picnic table adjacent to the 10,000-person capacity arena, he tells CNBC that the inaugural bitcoin gathering took place in this same venue in spring 2022, the weekend after the collapse of Terra Luna \u2014 a popular U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin project that imploded overnight, erasing half a trillion dollars from the sector's market cap in the process. \"A lot of people got burned in that,\" Primiterra said of the stablecoin's failure. \"I guess a lot of people became bitcoiners from that event. They understood the importance of self custody of bitcoin, bitcoin on bitcoin blockchain, not on other chains.\" The cascade of crypto bankruptcies, failed tokens and the revelation that some of the titans of the industry were running allegedly criminal enterprises laid bare to many that bitcoin is king. But Lisbon as a city remains largely blockchain agnostic. Every night of the week, there is some sort of industry gathering \u2014 recurring events like Web3 Wednesdays and Crypto Fridays at The Block, a popular clubhouse where industry enthusiasts can rent out co-working space. The city also plays host to major industry conferences like Web Summit and NearCon. \"I remember, two years ago, there was supposed to be an ethereum event here, and then solana organized another event and then they said, 'Well, let's do a blockchain week,' and then it became a blockchain month,\" said Primiterra. \"I went to the other blockchain events during the bull market, because every blockchain was offering drinks, and I'm like, 'Why not?'\" he said.\n\nAerial view shot of the April 25th Bridge and the Tagus River at sunset, Almada, Lisboa Region, Portugal Simonskafar | E+ | Getty Images\n\nCrypto investment firm Greenfield recently named Lisbon the most important crypto hub on the planet, outranking New York, Berlin and Singapore. In the recently released State of European Crypto Report, researchers point to its \"profound DeFi scene\" and the country's tax breaks as two big reasons for its top status. Even as the government looks to roll back aggressive incentives for foreigners, the tax regime is still a lot more favorable than elsewhere on the continent \u2014 especially as the collective crypto market cap is nearly 60% off its all-time high. Add perks like the newly launched digital nomad visa and the fact that the city offers lower prices than other Western European hubs, and Lisbon has all the fixings of an ideal expatriate enclave for tech enthusiasts looking to save cash while they talk code. This is a big part of why Primiterra, who has been in roughly 50 countries in seven years, is staying put in Portugal. He bought an apartment during the pandemic in an up-and-coming neighborhood outside the main city center \u2014 and has no plans to uproot anytime soon. Another big draw? A community of like-minded people. \"I like tech in general, so even if I know that a project is terribly coded tech wise \u2014 I'm like, 'OK, tell me how you plan to solve that double-spend problem,'\" he said. \"I can listen to it, I can counter-argue some of the stuff.\" \"I have friends in the ethereum community, and it's totally fine for me,\" added Primiterra, though he noted that one of his big side projects of the moment is looking to launch a co-working space dedicated to bitcoin.\n\nSunrise over Lisbon, Portugal Alexander Spatari | Moment | Getty Images\n\nThe San Francisco of Europe\n\nA walk through Portugal's capital feels eerily similar to a stroll in San Francisco. Both boast a cityscape defined by steep streets and sudden vistas; hilly terrain sloping down to beaches dotted by kite surfers and sailboats; red, dual-towered suspension bridges marking the edge of the city bounds; and brightly colored old-fashioned trams snaking through narrow streets. The two coastal cities are also honey pots for techies. Jemson Chan is a software tester from Singapore who has been living in Portugal for nine months. Chan is currently working for a company that is not crypto related, but he says his passion firmly lies in bitcoin and decentralized tech. \"I came to Lisbon for the quality of life, the number of tech startups and the very burgeoning tech scene,\" said Chan.\n\nJemson Chan is a software tester from Singapore who has been living in Portugal for nine months. CNBC\n\nGuy Young, the CEO and founder of crypto startup Ethena Labs, says the ambience drew him to Lisbon, calling it one of those ideal cities that strikes a good balance between picturesque architecture, a rich history, top-notch restaurants, great weather \u2014 and a solid community of crypto people. Young's anecdotal take on the Iberian Peninsula reflects a common sentiment. In 2022, Portugal ranked sixth on the Global Peace Index, and it tops the list of best countries for expats. The number of foreign residents in Portugal has been on the rise for seven straight years, increasing by more than 40% in the past decade. It also helps that there are clear ground rules on crypto in Europe, thanks to a law known as Markets in Crypto-Assets, or MiCA. While the guidelines aren't Portugal-specific, the comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets makes it easier to navigate operating a crypto business or investing in virtual tokens in the eurozone. Chan, who has a side hustle hosting his own educational podcast on bitcoin called Orange Pill Uncensored, says Portugal is a far more hospitable backdrop than the U.S. with its regulation-by-enforcement tactics deployed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Ever since the FTX collapse and the current ongoing attacks by especially the U.S. government on centralized exchanges, there have been efforts from the grassroots level to create more decentralized platforms that deal with the on- and off-ramps to fiat,\" added Chan, pointing to decentralized marketplaces like Pocket Bitcoin, RoboSats, Bisque and Peach that allow users to buy and sell bitcoin. Primiterra used to spend his days working to measure global internet censorship as part of his work with a sub-project of the dark web browser, Tor. But nowadays, he volunteers his coding skills to Bitcoin Map, an open-source tool that lets you search for merchants that accept bitcoin anywhere in the world. Lisbon may be crypto-friendly, but businesses don't appear to be all that interested in accepting bitcoin as a form of currency. Primiterra says the list includes a handful of merchants including a ramen place and a dentist.\n\nSeb True is a full-stack engineer who made the move to Lisbon over the summer. CNBC\n\nSeb True is a full-stack engineer who made the move to Lisbon over the summer. The British national initially traveled to Portugal on what was meant to be a short trip to make a presentation at the monthly bitcoin gathering. Soon after his arrival, he was hooked and committed to a three-month sublet. True quit his full-time job so he could focus on traveling the world and teaching people about bitcoin from the perspective of sound money and the philosophy of libertarianism. He has dubbed his educational modules The Bitcoin Student, and he's looking to expand the brand by capitalizing on his engineering background. Lisbon has been a relief for True, who previously ran underground workshops in Egypt where bitcoin is illegal. \"Apparently they throw people in jail for talking about it and just working on it or doing anything with it,\" he said. \"That's actually the first place I started giving presentations on bitcoin.\" He says he knew the risks but ultimately ignored warnings about his safety, because he felt the population could greatly benefit from learning more about decentralized virtual money that existed outside the reach of governments or central banks. \"It's a country that has experienced over 50% inflation just this year, people are suffering, they don't understand why and they don't know who to blame,\" continued True. \"Their view was, 'Oh, bitcoin, someone controls that, too, surely, so it's not going to be any better,'\" he said, adding that it didn't take long to \"orange pill\" them, a phrase used by bitcoiners to describe the process of indoctrinating someone in the ways of bitcoin. True has now shifted his focus to Portugal, describing Lisbon, in particular, as the ideal base to grow his enterprise. \"The people here that I'm meeting are doing things, actually creating content, they're active about making a difference, and they are interested in collaborating,\" True told CNBC. \"I've already had people contacting me asking to make content for me or for my project, not for any money, not for any fame ... but just because they're passionate, because they believe in the mission,\" continued True. \"They believe in the idea, and that's really what's made me think, 'Wow, I should really stay here. This is where the community clearly is.'\"\n\nLisbon's skyline, showing the city's Ponte 25 de Abril spanning the river Tagus. Stephen Knowles Photography | Moment | Getty Images\n\nTax breaks on bitcoin\n\nBefore making the move from Asia to Europe, Chan pored over tax law in the European Union, narrowing down the ideal jurisdiction to either Switzerland or Portugal. \"If you know anything about Switzerland, it's a millionaires' and billionaires' paradise,\" said Chan. \"Looking at me, I don't think I've achieved that level of success yet, so I chose the poor man's Switzerland.\" The tax perks in Portugal are certainly a big draw. The resident-non-habitual (NHR) status is a fiscal regime that in some cases grants expats living in Portugal total exemption from paying taxes on their income for a period of up to 10 years. In addition, unlike the U.S., which treats virtual currency as property, taxing it in a manner similar to stocks or real property, Portugal views cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. That distinction is a game-changer with respect to taxes. Up until the end of 2022, capital gains resulting from crypto transactions, such as cashing out and crypto-to-crypto trades, were not subject to personal income taxes. The government has since added more caveats to its crypto tax breaks, including a requirement that an investor hold a digital asset for more than a year before selling in order to avoid paying taxes on the sale. This means that gains from buying or selling cryptocurrency, as with other fiat currencies, are not taxed if the trader holds on to their coins for at least 12 months. Meanwhile, profits made on crypto held for less than a year is taxed at a rate of 28%. \"This makes Portugal a really attractive place for crypto users to live,\" explained Shehan Chandrasekera, a CPA and head of tax strategy at crypto tax software company CoinTracker.io. The only exception to the country's generous crypto scheme relates to companies registered in Portugal that deal in crypto. These businesses face some taxes under certain circumstances, like if they earn cryptocurrency by providing services in Portugal.\n\nCyclists photographed in Lisbon, Portugal, in October 2018. Kamisoka | Istock Unreleased | Getty Images\n\nExpats tell CNBC the process of establishing residency is relatively smooth. It doesn't require owning any property, and unlike other crypto tax havens, such as Puerto Rico, foreigners aren't required to spend a certain number of days in the country. Citizens of the European Union have the right to permanent residence in Portugal, and for non-EU citizens, it offers expats a few paths to residency, including the golden visa and the D7 Visa (also known as the retirement visa or passive income visa), both of which tend to attract wealthy foreigners. The Portuguese golden visa is given to those who buy property, or invest a certain amount of money in the country. There are also steps that involve getting a tax identification number, opening a bank account and formally applying for residency. Companies such as Plan B Passport streamline the application process for expats. Plan B CEO Katie Ananina tells CNBC the company has helped hundreds of people from countries such as the U.S., the U.K., Australia and Canada obtain a second passport in one of seven countries, including Portugal. Plan B works in tandem with each government's residence- or citizenship-by-investment programs. One drawback to Lisbon's burgeoning popularity: As more crypto fans flood the city, some of the longtime natives are complaining about rising prices, similar to other tech hubs around the world. \"There's been quite a sort of influx of foreigners that have come in recently,\" says Ethena's Young. \"And there's been a bit of pushback around property prices, what's going on with sort of the prices in some of the restaurants and stuff like that. But as a foreigner who's come here, I have no complaints.\"\n\n'It's just paradise'\n\nWout Deley \u2014 who has been researching cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology since 2013 \u2014 was working as an international sales manager for a galvanization company in Ghent, Belgium, when he decided to sell his house, invest in tokens and hit the road. After a few months traveling through Europe during the early days of the Covid pandemic, he ultimately settled in Portugal. Deley invested two-thirds of the house-sale proceeds in cryptocurrency and then lived off the final third. \"At any given time, I have maybe \u2014 at a maximum \u2014 10,000 euros ($11,450) in my bank account,\" said Deley. \"All the rest is always in crypto.\" For Deley, establishing residency in Portugal was a no-brainer. \"Cryptocurrencies in Belgium are massively taxed, and I was looking at seven figures of profit,\" said Deley, who said that he would have faced a tax obligation of close to 40% had he remained in Belgium. \"You want to double your profit? Just move to Portugal,\" he said.\n\nPra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio is a popular tourist destination in Lisbon's city center. Imazins | Image Bank Film | Getty Images\n\nDeley lives in Lagos in the southwest tip of Portugal. He says that he found a villa available as a long-term rental which was \"very cheap\" and that was enough to establish residency. The living is easy in Portugal, according to Deley, who says the southern coastline of the Algarve offers the perks of Los Angeles \u2014 a warm climate and great surf \u2014 but without the traffic jams. And there is a solid social scene. \"It's full of expats. It's just paradise,\" continued Deley. He says that he knows of at least three bitcoin billionaires who live nearby \u2014 plus another 12 people at least, mostly from the U.K., who are moving to Portugal in the next few months for the crypto tax benefits. Deley doesn't speak Portuguese, but he says that's not a problem because everyone speaks English. He is also surrounded by a lot of like-minded crypto investors. \"Everyone has cryptocurrency here. Everyone knows bitcoin. Everyone has it,\" he said. Deley says the crypto investor migration is good for Portugal, too. \"They have a huge brain drain. Younger people are leaving. So they're trying to be more open to people with capital, digital nomads,\" said Deley. Meanwhile, Didi Taihuttu of the 'Bitcoin Family' wants to disrupt the typical expat experience in Portugal by building a crypto village. The family is currently shopping for real estate. They've narrowed their options down to three different plots of land, one as big as 250,000 acres, in the Algarve. The plan is to run the community in a decentralized fashion, in which the land is divvied up by the square meter and sold as non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, in order to signify ownership. Taihuttu also wants to mine for bitcoin with solar and wind power and then use the heat produced by the rigs to warm houses in the winter, in a sort of closed-loop system. The working plan, for now, is to use a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, to govern the community. DAOs run on blockchain technology. \"We want to build a decentralized lifestyle, which is the future,\" he said. In the meantime, the Taihuttus found an abandoned inn and are retrofitting it to be the first web3 hotel in the Algarve that is financed and owned by the community."

Even crypto natives, dismayed by depressed markets and a decade of rejections by the Securities and Exchange Commission, are somehow brushing off the current state of affairs.\n\nBitcoin exchange-traded funds have been highly sought after since 2013 when the first application was submitted to the SEC and subsequently rejected. Over the past 10 years, the SEC has denied each of the several dozen ensuing proposals, including over 30 just since 2021. There are currently 10 active applications from major institutions. An uninformed observer may expect more of the same rejection, but this would be naive.\n\nTwo substantial developments in the past three months have drastically improved the prospects of an approval. Let\u2019s take a look at these developments and consider whether or not a spot ETF could revitalize Bitcoin and lift crypto out of its bear market.\n\nDevelopment 1: BlackRock\u2018s ETF bid\n\nMomentum kicked off on June 15 this year when BlackRock made waves by unexpectedly submitting a Bitcoin ETF application.\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink has spoken favorably about Bitcoin since then. Bitcoin \u201chas a differentiating value versus other asset classes, but more importantly, because it\u2019s so international it\u2019s going to transcend any one currency,\u201d Fink said. His change of tune is remarkable as he previously denounced Bitcoin as an \u201cindex of money laundering\u201d back in 2017.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s track record of ETF application approvals is nothing short of superb. The asset management giant has submitted 576 applications and all but one have been approved. Have the Bitcoin ETF tea leaves adjusted, and BlackRock taken note? BlackRock\u2019s 99.8% approval rate suggests so.\n\nSeveral other high-profile institutions including Fidelity and Ark Invest have followed suit with pending applications under review. Their filing dates and decision deadlines are largely identical. There are four deadlines during the review process in which the commission may, and often does, opt for delay and further review.\n\nWhether the SEC decision arrives early or not until final deadlines, the caliber of the institutions currently applying and their optimism are signaling one result: approval.\n\nDevelopment 2: Grayscale\u2018s court win\n\nA separate but equally significant development in the direction of ETF approval is the Aug. 29 federal court ruling that the SEC was wrong to deny Grayscale Investments\u2019 filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Grayscale previously applied to convert their Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF. The SEC denied this application, and Grayscale responded with a lawsuit arguing that the decision was incorrect. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia sided with Grayscale in its decision stating \u201cIn the absence of a coherent explanation, this unlike regulatory treatment of like products is unlawful.\u201d The court also ruled that the SEC\u2019s \u201cdenial of Grayscale\u2019s proposal was arbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\nThe court ordered the SEC to once again review Grayscale\u2019s application, effectively reversing the previous rejection.\n\nWhile the ruling does not equate to automatic approval, it strengthens the odds that approval is on the horizon. The SEC would need to provide strong support for further rejection. This begs the question: If such support exists, would it not have been included in their original rejection?\n\nOdds of approval\n\nWhile the SEC recently delayed all ETF applications on Sept. 1, as most applicants\u2019 first deadline for review was on Sept. 2, the delays were largely expected. The market responded accordingly with Bitcoin dropping about 5% from the delay announcement to around US$25,700 at the time of this writing. Despite the delays, the path to a spot ETF approval is much clearer after Grayscale\u2019s win in court. JPMorgan analysts believe this, as well as former SEC Chair Jay Clayton who says approval is \u201cinevitable.\u201d\n\nIt is reasonable to expect the SEC to approve several or even all of the filings at once. The applications are structured very similarly, and it may be considered unfair to grant any of the applicants a head start. Cathie Wood, the CEO of Ark Invest, told Bloomberg: \u201cI think the SEC, if it\u2019s going to approve a Bitcoin ETF, will approve more than one at once.\u201d Ark Invest has the earliest \u201cfinal deadline\u201d for its filing, which is slated for Jan. 10, 2024.\n\nEric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, believes there is a 75% chance of a spot Bitcoin ETF getting SEC approval this year. He ups the odds to 95% by the end of 2024.\n\nIf SEC approval is inevitable, how might we expect markets to respond?\n\nWhat crypto markets will do, post-ETF\n\nBitcoin ETFs already exist in the European Union, Canada, Brazil and Dubai. But as the U.S. is the center of world financial markets, including crypto markets, approval by its government would undeniably be a major event.\n\nAn ETF would shuttle new money into Bitcoin. While crypto exchanges such as Coinbase are the primary avenue for entering crypto today, the average American understandably has trust issues with them. KYC (know-your-customer) procedures and having to transfer funds to purchase crypto are also onerous as opposed to simply buying an ETF share. Crypto wallets, private keys and self-custody complicate matters further.\n\nThe institutions applying for a Bitcoin ETF deeply understand these hurdles. They know an ETF is an opportunity for a large segment of the population, who have thus far remained sidelined, to comfortably begin adding crypto exposure to their portfolio.\n\nBitcoin spot ETFs, in contrast to futures ETFs \u2014 which have traded in the U.S. since 2021 \u2014 may be particularly constructive to crypto markets. Spot ETFs, the type that all current applicants are applying for, would require the offering institutions to back the ETF with real Bitcoin. This differs from futures ETFs, which merely enable investors to trade an indexed derivative. In the case of futures ETFs, Bitcoin does not actually change hands. A new buyer of a spot ETF has a genuine positive impact on the price of the underlying asset.\n\nAnother way of thinking about a futures-based ETF is like two people betting on how the price of something will change. It\u2019s more akin to a side bet on what will happen. Their bet has no direct effect on the price of the asset they are betting on.\n\nA Bitcoin spot ETF issuer such as BlackRock or Fidelity must buy bona fide Bitcoin to back the shares of the fund that their customers hold. A Bitcoin spot ETF buy or sell will actually change the price of BTC.\n\nThe new source of fund flows into the space may provide the spark the industry needs to recover from a series of blows in 2022. The news itself will almost certainly cause a rush of buying in the short term. The volatility will breathe new life into the markets which have largely been subdued throughout this summer. The Grayscale decision on Aug. 29 produced a near immediate 6% Bitcoin price increase from US$26,100 to US$27,700. This increase fully re-traced on news of the SEC\u2019s choice to delay all of the outstanding applications on Aug. 31 as the first decision deadline for most filings approached.\n\nIf the ETF is approved, it is possible that market gains will extend longer than only in the short term.\n\nIn the short to medium term, a reflexivity loop may be created whereby:\n\nBitcoin price increases on ETF approval news.\n\n\u2b07\n\nInvestors desire Bitcoin allocation due to price increases.\n\n\u2939 \u2934\n\nInvestors purchase shares in a spot ETF, which drives Bitcoin prices up further.\n\nIn the long term, we will see BlackRock et al shepherding clients to diversify part of their portfolio into Bitcoin. Passive investors will buy and hold for the long term. As Bitcoin\u2019s supply is finite, the price is bound to be driven upward.\n\nGold appreciated eight years in a row after the initial spot Gold ETF was approved back in 2004. For all proclamations of Bitcoin as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d it would be fitting for Bitcoin\u2019s next upward cycle to similarly commence following ETF approval.\n\nThe world is not paying attention to Bitcoin at the moment. That will change before the year ends."

In August alone, Riot made $31.7 million dollars in energy credits for cutting back its energy use.\n\nWashington, DC (September 7, 2023)\u2014While Texans suffered from record-breaking extreme heat this summer and sky-high electricity bills, Riot Platforms, a Bitcoin mining company, was getting paid by Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) for simply shutting down. In August alone, Riot made $31.7 million dollars in energy credits for cutting back its energy use. That was nearly four times what the company made mining Bitcoin. Meanwhile the climate change fueled heatwave threatened people\u2019s lives who struggled in triple digit temperatures and damaged infrastructure.\n\nJoshua Archer, Lead Bitcoin Campaigner, said: \u201cWhile Texans suffer from extreme heat, Riot boasts about its record-breaking earnings of energy credits and their controversial arrangement with ERCOT. Talk about a bad deal for Texans. Riot claims that it is stabilizing the grid by shutting down during heat waves, but how can paying Riot be justified while Texans have to pay exorbitant prices just to keep the lights on? This deal only benefits one party\u2014Riot Platforms. This is why we are campaigning to innovate Bitcoin away from proof-of-work mining and rein in its excessive energy consumption.

Photo: Getty Images (Yuichiro Chino via Getty Images)\n\nBitcoin has jumped back above the $26,000 mark, after languishing in $25,000 territory for over one week.\n\nThe world's largest digital asset by market capitalisation (BTC-USD) has increased in value by almost 2% in the past 24 hours. It's now changing hands for $26,246, according to CoinGecko.\n\nBitcoin's liquid supply is shrinking as investors are removing their coins from exchanges and stowing them away in cold storage wallets.\n\nThese long-term investor wallets have a history of holding and accumulating bitcoin. Recent data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode showed that 95% of the existing supply of bitcoin has not moved in the past 30 days.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead more: Crypto live prices\n\nCoupled with this, CryptoQuant data showed that 29,300 bitcoin have been removed from cryptocurrency exchanges in the past month. The number of bitcoin in ready, liquid, supply has fallen from 2,082,763 to 2,053,460, a fall of over 1.4%.\n\nThis shrinking supply could coincide with a sudden increase in demand in the form of \"big money buyers\", according to one analyst.\n\n\"95% of all bitcoin has not moved in the last 30 days. Despite the weak market, only 5% is moving around.\n\n\"Imagine there\u2019s a catalyst and imagine big money wants to jump in and buy a truckload of bitcoin? The price will just go parabolic. When the big institutions come, they will be fighting over that 5%,\" an analyst at Invest Answers said.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETF decision deadlines in October\n\nOctober is expected to witness increased market volatility, primarily due to key events occurring in the middle of the month.\n\nThe US Securities Exchange Commission's (SEC) 45-day window is set to expire for reviewing the Grayscale spot bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) application.\n\nSlightly later in the month, on October 16, is the second deadline of the BTC ETP Trust Bitwise.

The fund would trade under the ticker ARKE.\n\nSpeaking to Bloomberg, the Ark Invest CEO said: \u201cThere\u2019s been so much regulatory controversy about a bitcoin spot ETF that I guess many people thought it was a step too far, but we don\u2019t, and it\u2019s always nice to be first.\u201d\n\nEthereum climbed almost 1% in the past 24 hours, now changing hands for $1,643, according to CoinGecko.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is about to test hodlers with a \u201cmid cycle lull\u201d before starting a bull run in late 2024, a new BTC price model states.\n\nAccording to its creator, popular analyst CryptoCon, the \u201cNovember 28th Cycles Theory\u201d demands the BTC price all-time high in 2025.\n\nCountdown to BTC price \u201cbull run launch\u201d\n\nAmid debate over the nature of the current Bitcoin four-year price cycle, CryptoCon believes that all may be simpler than many imagine when it comes to how BTC/USD behaves at a given time.\n\nUnveiling the \u201cNovember 28th\u201d chart on X (formerly Twitter), he delineated the date as a key pivot point in the year, along with a three-week period on either side.\n\n\u201cUsing 4-year time cycles against my Theory, produces Bitcoins exact behavior in time since its inception. Cycles are centered around the date of the first halving Nov 28th,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cBitcoin price action began at the first bottom October 8th, 2010. This is where cycle curves peak, every 4 years. Tops and bottoms come +/- 21 days from Nov 28th at their appropriate times on the curve. Tops on the upswing, bottoms on the pinnacle.\u201d\n\nThe chart describes November 28 as the date Bitcoin sees a \u201cbull run launch\u201d every four years. The last was in 2020 when BTC/USD broke beyond its prior all-time high (ATH) to hit its current $69,000 record a year later.\n\nThe next point of interest is thus November 2024. Until then, BTC price action will spend its time in a \u201cmid cycle lull.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter Bitcoin bottoms, price makes an early first cycle move (orange) and enters into a mid-cycle lull,\u201d CryptoCon continued.\n\n\u201cThis is the longest part of the cycle, where Bitcoin spends time around the median price (half of previous ATH), until the curve bottoms.\u201d\n\nBitcoin November 28th theory chart. Source: CryptoCon/X\n\nHe added that Bitcoin had \u201calmost certainly\u201d seen its early top, referencing the $31,800 local highs from July.\n\nA Bitcoin \u201cbull market fakeout\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, opinions on where BTC price action will go into the 2024 block subsidy halving differ.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin halving can take BTC price to $148K by July 2025 \u2014 Pantera Capital\n\nSome argue that modest gains will be all that hodlers will see before the event, scheduled for April next year.\n\nIn an interview with Cointelegraph this week, Filbfilb, co-founder of trading suite DecenTrader, nonetheless delivered a $46,000 target for the halving, with $35,000 slated for year-end.\n\nIn his latest newsletter published on Sept. 5, meanwhile, CryptoCon summarized 2023 BTC price behavior as a \u201cbull market fakeout.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis makes it appear as if the bull market has begun with the trigger of many signals, but then at some point, price fails to continue,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cThis is the most convincing example we\u2019ve seen of this yet. Personally, I think there is still some time to go for that and I am patiently awaiting its completion.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD 1-day chart.

        "content": "Bitcoin rose 1.1% from Sept. 1 to Sept. 8 to US$26,267 as of 3:30 p.m. Friday in Hong Kong. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been trading below US$30,000 since Aug. 9, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nAfter falling to a weekly low of US$25,413 last Friday, Bitcoin briefly rose above US$26,000 on Sunday and Monday before regaining the support level on Friday.\n\n\u201cDespite Grayscale\u2019s recent court win, investor confidence in Bitcoin remains subdued. The court victory failed to boost the Bitcoin price,\u201d Lucas Kiely, the chief investment officer of digital asset platform Yield App, told Forkast.\n\n\u201cThe lackluster response indicates generally bearish sentiment in the crypto sector. Investors are increasingly diversifying their portfolios with assets other than Bitcoin, such as stocks or real estate. While the crypto markets have been relatively quiet in recent months, the stock market offers them more volatility and therefore opportunity.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, asset manager Grayscale\u2019s lawyers sent a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requesting a meeting with the agency about the path to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Grayscale\u2019s lawyers said that there are no grounds for the SEC to continue to block the conversion.\n\nThis pivotal ruling is not only a beacon of optimism for Grayscale but may also pave the way for other financial heavyweights, such as BlackRock and Fidelity, waiting for the SEC\u2019s decision on their own spot Bitcoin ETF applications. Image: Grayscale/SEC\n\nOn Wednesday, asset manager Ark Invest filed for a spot Ether ETF in the U.S., naming Coinbase as a custodian. If accepted, this would be the first publicly traded Ether ETF in the U.S. Despite the positive development, Ether, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, inched up 0.16% over the week to US$1,647.\n\nOn the same day, Bitcoin received institutional fair value accounting approval from the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The long-awaited rules will kick in in 2025, allowing companies with large Bitcoin holdings to report their assets at fair value, capturing the most up-to-date value of the asset and making it easier for companies to hold Bitcoin.\n\nStory continues\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price action may also be affected by the September effect, which refers to the phenomenon where traditional equity performance is historically weaker during the month, according to Jonas Betz, crypto market analyst and founder of consultancy firm Betz Crypto.\n\n\u201cWhile there is some statistical evidence from the last century supporting its existence, many economists and market professionals dismiss it as a reliable predictor. If one accepts the September effect as true for equity markets and given that correlations between Bitcoin and traditional markets are currently positive, it\u2019s conceivable that a weak September in the stock market could also influence Bitcoin prices negatively,\u201d Betz told Forkast.\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.05 trillion on Friday at 3:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, maintaining the same value from a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. With a market cap of US$511 billion, Bitcoin represented 48.5% of the market while Ether, valued at US$198 billion, accounted for 18.8%.\n\nNotable movers: SNX, IOTA\n\nThe native cryptocurrency of decentralized finance protocol Synthetix (SNX) was this week\u2019s biggest gainer in the top 100, rallying 17.07% to US$2.26. The coin started gaining on Monday, shortly after the protocol announced details about the upcoming perpetual futures V3 testnet, including a trading competition on the new testnet with a US$5,000 reward for first place.\n\nThe utility token of the IOTA protocol (MIOTA), a blockchain designed for value and data transfers on the Internet of Things, was this week\u2019s second-biggest gainer, rising 14.57% to US$0.1791. The token started picking up momentum on Wednesday after the protocol announced that the victims of the 2018 online seed generation scam will have their losses refunded.\n\nNext week: Could Bitcoin fall to US$20,300?\n\n\u201cTechnical analysis of Bitcoin\u2019s price charts reveals concerning patterns. The formation of lower highs, price reversals to the downside, and failure to breach key resistance levels indicate a potential continuation of the ongoing downward trend,\u201d wrote Yield App\u2019s Kiely.\n\n\u201cWhile trend lines suggest Bitcoin could fall below US$20,000, it could also revisit US$23,000 in a Fibonacci retrace.\u201d\n\nArk Invest\u2019s The Bitcoin Monthly report also noted that Bitcoin has a downside risk of US$20,300, which is the market\u2019s average cost basis.\n\nNext week, investors will be looking forward to the release of the U.S. core consumer price index, which measures the inflation of goods and services, excluding foods and energy.\n\nOver in Europe, the European Central Bank\u2019s next interest rate decision is scheduled for next Thursday.\n\nSee related article: N.

A decade has passed since that initial application, and the Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected more than a dozen additional applications and repeatedly punted the date for deciding on others.\n\nThe ETF saga\u2019s latest iteration saw Bitcoin (BTC) jump more than 6% as industry advocates celebrated a court ruling that affirmed what we already knew \u2014 that the SEC\u2019s rejection of Grayscale\u2019s ETF application was \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d This was, of course, followed by the SEC delaying its decision on all seven pending Bitcoin ETFs, and a subsequent price drop.\n\nNow we wait as the SEC deliberates on its next move and Grayscale pleads for approval.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETFs: Even worse for crypto than central exchanges\n\nTo a degree, the case for a Bitcoin ETF makes sense in the spirit of adoption. The $7 trillion ETF industry is ripe with investors still on the crypto sidelines, awaiting a product that would grant them Bitcoin exposure without having to buy BTC directly and set up a wallet. Plus, as a community that\u2019s fought long and hard to have digital assets taken seriously, the crypto world is inclined to welcome the validation that a United States spot ETF would signal.\n\nBut crypto, Bitcoin especially, is predicated on the need for an alternative financial system \u2014 one that enables the financial sovereignty, transparency and consensus that traditional finance (TradFi) so glaringly lacks. The crypto industry\u2019s eagerness for an SEC ETF approval feels like a step backward, akin to American revolutionaries begging Parliament to intermediate colonial tax collection after rejecting its imperial rule.\n\nMainstream adoption is a ubiquitous goal among crypto champions, and an SEC sign-off on a BTC vehicle that resonates with TradFi is ostensibly a fast track to it. But fighting for approval from an opaque centralized agency for an intermediated investment product belies our industry\u2019s purpose. And frankly, it\u2019s unnecessary.\n\nThe irony of cautious investors waiting to buy Bitcoin ETF shares rather than taking the safer route of buying BTC directly is palpable. ETFs bear many layers of counterparty risk, including the sponsor, custodian and other partners. We saw how catastrophic this type of risk can be in crypto during the latest contagion, when customers lost more than $10 billion within months because they trusted third parties. Though the contagion appears to have dwindled, the major takeaway remains: If you don\u2019t have the private keys to your Bitcoin, your assets aren\u2019t in your control, and they may not even exist.\n\nThose of us who witnessed the fallout up close know this. But investors who\u2019ve been waiting on the sidelines for an ETF likely do not. It\u2019s our job as industry builders and veterans to help newcomers understand the new degree of security and risk aversion that Bitcoin\u2019s technology enables.\n\nThe downside of a spot Bitcoin ETF runs deeper than the conceptual contradiction and the unknowing purchases of a riskier investment. The potential cost for the crypto movement is immense.\n\nTake, for example, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust, the announcement of which drove Bitcoin\u2019s price to a one-year high in June. However, perhaps blinded by the prospect of monumental institutional inflows, much of the Bitcoin community, myself included, has thrown its support behind BlackRock\u2019s iteration of TradFi 2.0, haphazardly disguised as Bitcoin conviction.\n\nRelated: An ETF will bring a revolution for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies\n\nBuried within BlackRock\u2019s submission is a clause on hard forks. It states:\n\nThe Sponsor will [\u2026] use its discretion to determine which network should be considered the appropriate network for the Trust\u2019s purposes, and in doing so may adversely affect the value of the Shares. [...] There is no guarantee that the Sponsor will choose the digital asset that is ultimately the most valuable fork. [\u2026] The Sponsor may also disagree with Shareholders, the Bitcoin Custodian, other service providers, the Index Administrator, cryptocurrency exchanges, or other market participants on what is generally accepted as Bitcoin and should therefore be considered \u2018bitcoin\u2019 for the Trust\u2019s purposes, which may also adversely affect the value of the Shares as a result.\n\nThat clause basically introduces ambiguity around the consensus mechanism for a protocol that already has a very well-defined and battle-tested mechanism.\n\nOn a broader level, BlackRock will undoubtedly amass an enormous Bitcoin supply, while its iShares ETF may be subject to opacity and possible rehypothecation. This puts shareholders at risk of having only a paper claim to Bitcoin that\u2019s been lent out, instead of the asset itself. It\u2019s one thing to have accepted this scenario pre-Bitcoin, but it\u2019s deeply unsettling to imagine this becoming the norm in a world where we have the opportunity to own Bitcoin on a transparent and immutable ledger.\n\nAs the coexistence of decentralized finance and TradFi becomes more of a reality, it is inevitable that the SEC will, at some point, approve a spot Bitcoin ETF. While this isn\u2019t innately bad, it\u2019s critical for the Bitcoin community to remain cognizant and committed to the reasons we\u2019re building a new financial system.\n\nWe can and should embrace legacy institutions\u2019 adoption of Bitcoin and the undoubted intertwining of traditional investment vehicles and Bitcoin. But we also need to remain vigilant about the implications of developments like spot ETFs, help market newcomers understand the novelty of Bitcoin\u2019s technology, and keep moving forward.\n\nJoseph Kelly is the CEO of Unchained, a Bitcoin financial services company he co-founded in 2016.

The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) also hit its highest point this month, rising over 2% before retreating. Bitcoin has mostly languished below $26,000 this month as traders awaited clarity around the big regulatory hotspots, such as the SEC\u2019s decision on the listing of a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. September is a difficult month for bitcoin, which has posted negative returns every year since 2016.

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Lingers Below $26K as Interest Rates 'Could Stay High' For Some Time: Analyst - CoinDesk",
        "content": "Risk assets including crypto seem to be kind of going boring. Is kind of is the way I would describe it is going nowhere for a little while. Uh That's uh that's happening as new research from Chicago Fed economists suggests that the central bank has raised rates, interest, particularly fed funds rates enough to take care of that 2% inflation target without having a recession. Well, that's just one that's just one fed's opinion. What about everything else? Joining us now to discuss the e to us investment analyst, Callie Cox. Welcome back, Callie. Hey, happy to be back. Happy Friday. Oh yeah, you said it. Thank you. So I I let let, let's talk here economists here because and also fed fed presidents and, and the like because we kind of hear a lot of mixed messages. On the one hand here, we have a Chicago Fed economist saying uh yeah, this is enough. On the other hand, you hear from others like man, this there might be some room here, but it looks like the market kind of is betting and for the time being that September, no rate hike. First of all, I wanna get is it enough? Who, who do you think is right here? Second of all, will there be a hike? Are you gonna be an outlier here for September? Yeah. Two very good questions. So, let's start with the first one. Who's right. I don't, I don't know if the fed even knows what, what, uh, they're going to do in September. And I say this, uh, with a very serious undertone because, you know, the fed has said over and over again that they're data dependent. And yes, we do get mixed messages from fed speakers. I think that's one of the cons of, you know, having greater transparency from the FED these days. Um, you know, different fed members have different fed opinions. There are research teams at different fed banks, um, and I can say different things and I think the, the underlying, you know, motto that you need to grab from that is, you know, just be careful with what you listen to, um, on, you know, the rates part, you know, if we could see a rate hike in July, uh, excuse me, September, where are we, um, if we see a rate hike in September, you know, i it's plausible we could see it happen. But right now we're telling customers to focus on the fact that rates could stay high for a while because a 25 basis point rate hike if it happens, uh, is just a blip on the radar when you consider that rates have already been hiked 5% and there's already a lot of pressure on the economy. Yeah, I, you know, a couple of things on that point. First of all, I, I, you kind of almost missed the days when the only signals you got were like what briefcase, um, Callen Greenspan was holding. Uh, you're too young to remember that. But I, I remember that it was like different types of briefcases told us what could be happening like it became, it was like kind of a form of kremlinology. Another term you probably are too young to understand. Uh but it was a um and nonetheless that that's kind of like something that happened. And as you pointed out, it is maybe the fact that there is all this transparency particularly under Powell a problem, I mean, like is it, is it actually making things worse for the economy because people can't uh particularly the bond markets can't quite judge what's going to happen even more. So, I mean, it's sort of a is it, is it a, is it too much of a good thing? I actually think it's an effective tool from the Fed's point of view because the Fed can test out different policy stances and different, you know, ideas and see how investors and consumers react to them. Of course, that makes it more confusing for investors because you get more signals and people like to hang on to FED speakers every word these days. So I think it just depends on where you're sitting. And I, I also see some pros for investors too, you know, especially if you like trading volatility. Uh But, you know, it, it does require you to change your, you know, almost change your strategy when it comes to, you know, trying to read the Feds tea leaves. If you're a long-term investor and 99% of what the fed says doesn't really matter to you. And you need to focus on, you know, what you're seeing from the economy and earnings. Speaking of reading the tea leaves, it seems that economists are also divided on if a recession is looming in the US. What are your thoughts there? Yeah. So there's certainly a lot of pressure on the economy right now and we've been one of the more optimistic firms out there, you know, saying that the job market is strong, consumers are spending. It's really hard to be in a recession when consumer spending is 70% of the economy. And those two conditions are in place. Uh, obviously we're seeing the job market weakening. Uh, you know, I'm a little concerned about the pressure valves we're seeing in higher oil prices and a stronger dollar. I mean, both of those can drain the global economy and put a lot more pressure on consumers' wallets. So, you know, I see the, you know, bias towards cyclicals out there. I see the fact that speculative coins are picking up and, you know, we're just warning customers to be cautious here, you know, don't fully step out of risk. Um, but just be, be careful about the risks. You take, look for that quality risks or, you know, companies and protocols that could survive a recession if it happens. I getting back to this whole idea of risk, you know, here we are, we have the, uh, we have the fed funds rate at 5% probably headed north to, you know, further north. Um, what, uh, it doesn't that kind of create a, a hurdle rate for, uh, taking on that extra risk that, uh, some of these, these outliers, these alt coins just can't match, uh, given the cost of borrowing I, I, is, it, it, is there a long term problem uh ahead for alt coins? Uh, and, and by all coins, I don't just mean, uh, you know, kind of like the, the bottom of the barrel. I'm talking about some of the top, top twenties. Is there, is there something to be, um, I don't know, just kind of like, er, maybe that's just a risk too far. Yeah, Lawrence, I think you hit the nail on the head there when rates are high, investors have to be more skeptical about where they put their money because that hurdle rate is higher. I mean, we've seen that since the beginning of 2022 when the FED started raising rates and if rates remain at 5% or even higher than 5% for a bit, that hurdle rate is 5%. And investors are faced with this choice of, you know, putting money into a money market fund, getting 5% or a little bit more and, or, you know, taking the risk at higher rates and stepping into an all coin that's a little more speculative. Um, and that is essentially a projection of the future. Um And we all know the time value of money, you know, when rates are high, the future of a value dollar, uh the value of future dollar decreases. So take that all into consideration, there's less money out there, less appetite to take on risk. And you know, when there's a finite amount of money, a finite amount of funding, it may flow to more quality sources. And that's the base of our opinion here. I mean, look all coins are exciting. Um I understand the, you know, the reasoning and investing behind them and I think, you know, the types of investors who invest in them like to learn more and they like a little bit of action. Uh But at the same time, you know, if you're a long-term investor, you have to realize that all coins are a little behind the eight ball here. Um And they're at a disadvantage because they don't have that utility yet. They don't have, you know, those cash flows that people will, you know, search for in a high rate environment. All right, we got to get Bitcoin into the fold here before we go, you have a few encouraging storylines about Bitcoin, talk to us about what those are. Yeah. So speaking of utility, I mean, I think it's very encouraging for crypto ambassadors that we keep seeing headlines about how Bitcoin is finding its way into the mainstream market. I mean, yesterday we saw the news that JP Morgan was considering um decentralized tokens for, you know, showing different securities. Um Of course, we got the gray scale ruling last week. I mean, all of these are evidence that, you know, institutions are looking into Bitcoin. You know, we're taking it steps further and I'm not a Bitcoin Maxi, like let me be clear here. But when you look at crypto as a whole, you need to understand that there are different levels of risk there. Um And you know, I've been saying for a while, you know, crypto needs to prove its utility. I think it's happening in certain spaces and we're seeing that most prominently with Bitcoin and Ethereum and, you know, specifically Bitcoin over the past few weeks. All right, Kelly, thanks for joining us. It's always a pleasure having you on. I hope you have a good weekend. Yeah. Thank you y'all too. That was it to us investment analyst, Kelly Cox."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price is trading in a frustratingly tight range between $25,500 and $26,500, leaving traders unsure of the next direction that the asset could take.\n\nHowever, Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, believes that Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) current price presents a low-risk long-term buying opportunity. Edwards\u2019 view is based on Bitcoin\u2019s production cost and energy value.\n\nCapriole Investments energy value theory gives a fair value price of $47,200, and Edwards reiterated his bullish stance by saying that Bitcoin\u2019s production cost gives a floor price estimation of around $23,000 with a 100% hit ratio.\n\nThe trade has a risk-reward ratio of 1:5, with the potential for even higher price targets, but Edwards added it is based on the assumption that the rally price \"would stop at fair value, which it never has.\u201d\n\nMy favorite Bitcoin chart right now.

According to the theory, the fair value of Bitcoin can be estimated by the amount of energy it takes to produce it.\n\nThe model assumes that the more work that has been put into something, the more valuable it is.\n\nIn 2023, the amount of energy spent in Bitcoin mining has been on the rise as mining companies increased their capacity and share of hash rate with the installation of new ASICs and by preparing for the halving in April 2024.\n\nBitcoin price chart with energy value indicator. Source: TradingView\n\nAccording to Edwards, the Bitcoin energy value reflects its fair value.\n\nBitcoin's energy value has shown a strong correlation with Bitcoin\u2019s spot price and this suggests that the theory is at least somewhat valid. However, there are some caveats to the theory.\n\nOne limitation is that Bitcoin\u2019s energy value is not always accurate. This is because the mining energy efficiency can vary over time.\n\nRelated: Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index updated to reflect hardware distribution and hash rate increases\n\nAdditionally, the theory does not take into account other factors that can affect the price of Bitcoin, such as the market\u2019s current demand and supply and the steps taken by miners ahead of the halving next year.\n\nBitcoin looks primed for further downside\n\nBitcoin\u2019s spot liquidity data on Binance indicates that buyers are looking at the $24,600 level for support. However, the bullish momentum appears to be fading as most traders are crowding around the yearly low levels and hoping that these hold.\n\nThe liquidation levels of futures orders from CoinGlass show that buyers are expecting downside to $24,600, with smaller liquidations extending toward $23,000.\n\nNotably, the price range between $25,000 and $25,500 has the most leveraged orders in significantly high volumes, making them hot targets for traders.\n\nBitcoin futures liquidation heatmap.

A drop below $23,000 would target the $21,451 and $19,549 levels from 2022.\n\nBitcoin support and resistance levels.

        "content": "On this week's episode of \u201cMacro Markets,\u201d Cointelegraph analyst Marcel Pechman delves into a thought-provoking discussion on the United States Federal Reserve\u2019s financial woes. Pechman opens by highlighting how the Fed is grappling with staggering losses and emphasizes a fundamental macroeconomic principle: that overall wealth cannot be universally enhanced as demand for goods and services grows.\n\nThis discrepancy underscores the challenges posed by inflation, real estate prices and the consequences of the Fed\u2019s policies. Pechman concludes that the Fed is now paying the price for its loose monetary approach during the pandemic, prompting a grim outlook for the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s finances.\n\nShifting gears, Pechman moves on to discuss European markets, with a spotlight on Novo Nordisk\u2019s remarkable ascent. The Danish pharmaceutical company has momentarily overtaken luxury goods giant LVMH as Europe\u2019s most valuable company. Pechman notes that the astonishing success of Novo Nordisk, particularly its weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, caused Denmark\u2019s gross domestic product growth forecast to be revised upward.\n\nIn a final intriguing twist, Pechman touches upon the intersection of traditional companies and cryptocurrencies as he speculates on the potential for traditional companies to adopt cryptocurrency-based revenue distribution methods through smart contracts. While he acknowledges the promise of this concept, Pechman underscores the current immaturity and complexity surrounding such endeavors, emphasizing that the sector is still in its infancy.\n\nFor additional details and the complete analysis, check out the new Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Gold\u2019s exchange-traded fund moment back in 2004 offers lessons for Bitcoin investors.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF now looks more likely than ever. Approvals and subsequent launches may share similarities with the launch of the first gold ETF, according to experts.\n\nHistory doesn\u2019t repeat but it rhymes, Joseph Hickey, founder at IntegraCess with previous experience in US ETF market making at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, told DL News.\n\nThe gold listing, almost 20 years ago, was advantageously timed as central banks had just finished selling their gold at the time, Hickey said, adding that prices had bottomed and people started buying it as a hedge against policy failure.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nNow read: Larry Fink says Bitcoin is \u2018digitalising gold\u2019 in another sign BlackRock is all-in on crypto\n\nThe launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF could make the digital asset a better tool for lending or financing collateral, Hickey said, adding that it could also become more liquid and less expensive to transact.\n\n\u201cAll good things for the asset class,\u201d he said.\n\nGoing for gold\n\nThe launch of the first gold ETF provides an example of how spot ETFs can \u201cdemocratise\u201d an asset, said Jennifer Murphy, CEO and founder at Runa Digital.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nGold price after ETF launch (Runa Digital/TradingView)\n\nFollowing its launch, the first gold ETF reached more than $1 billion in assets in three days, she said, which was \u201cthe fastest ever to do so, a record it held for 18 years, and gold prices broke out and sustained a multi-year bull run.\u201d\n\nGold prices eventually doubled after its ETF launch; it took about four years.\n\nNow read: Coinbase\u2019s inscrutable fee model may backfire as Wall Street giants gun for Bitcoin ETF\n\nThe only ETF to hit that number in a shorter period of time was ProShares Bitcoin futures ETF in 2021. It attracted $1 billion in investment in just two days. The price impact on Bitcoin was negligible.\n\nBig events in crypto have been associated with peaks in crypto prices, Hickey told DL News, adding that this could play out similarly.\n\nBitcoin traded at about $60,000 when ProShares launched the first Bitcoin futures ETF in the US, reaching a record high just short of $69,000 a few days later. It\u2019s down almost 60% since.\n\nEric Balchunas and James Seyffart, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts, said Thursday that the SEC will probably want to avoid being a \u201ckingmaker\u201d again by approving one fund first. Cathie Wood also expects the commission to accept multiple applications at once.\n\nLong game\n\nThe crypto market hasn\u2019t properly valued Grayscale\u2019s win versus the US Securities and Exchange Commission last week, according to some analysts.\n\nInvestors may be dramatically underestimating the impact of US Bitcoin ETFs, Vetle Lund, a research analyst at K33 Research, formerly Arcane, said in a report Tuesday.\n\nOdds for US approval have \u201cnever been higher,\u201d Lund said, and in spite of this, Bitcoin continues to trade around or below its price when BlackRock joined the race in June.\n\nIf a spot ETF is approved, Lund expects large inflows into Bitcoin due to \u201ccompetition and simultaneous launches.\u201d Inflows into Bitcoin investment vehicles have had a strong relationship with Bitcoin price increases over the past four years, he added.\n\nStill, the expectation of big inflows may be exaggerated \u2014 it could take much longer for prices to soar.\n\nThe level of competition for spot Bitcoin ETFs may also impact inflows.\n\nProShares has the majority of the volume in the Bitcoin futures ETF market, with about $1.1 billion in assets under management. Other funds pale in comparison. VanEck and Valkyrie\u2019s products manage just $45 million and $29 million, respectively.\n\nAdam Morgan McCarthy is DL News\u2019 London-based Markets Correspondent.

        "title": "Environmental Concerns and Bitcoin: Exploring Eco-Friendly Solutions - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "The meteoric rise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has fascinated the financial world and beyond. However, as cryptocurrencies' popularity has grown, so have concerns about their environmental impact. The energy-intensive process of Bitcoin mining has sparked concerns about its impact on carbon emissions and environmental deterioration.\n\nIn this in-depth article, we look at the environmental concerns surrounding Bitcoin, the variables that contribute to its carbon footprint, and the inventive solutions being pursued to make cryptocurrency mining more environmentally friendly.\n\nCryptocurrency Mining's Carbon Footprint\n\nCryptocurrency mining, the process of creating new coins and verifying transactions, is based on sophisticated mathematical calculations performed by powerful computers. This method necessitates a significant amount of computer power, resulting in high energy usage. As a result, the carbon footprint of cryptocurrency mining has been scrutinized.\n\nFactors Influencing Energy Consumption\n\nSeveral factors contribute to cryptocurrency mining's high energy consumption:\n\nPoW (Proof-of-Work) Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies use the PoW consensus method, in which miners compete to solve complicated mathematical puzzles. This necessitates massive amounts of computer power, which consumes enormous amounts of energy.\n\nMining Hardware: Using specialized hardware, such as Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), consumes more energy. These machines are geared for mining, but they also consume a lot of power.\n\nMining Pools: To boost their chances of successfully mining a block, miners frequently join forces in mining pools. While this improves efficiency, the combined computational power increases energy consumption.\n\nGeographical Distribution: The location of mining operations is important. Cheap electricity, frequently produced from nonrenewable sources, attracts miners but contributes to a larger carbon footprint.\n\nIntegration of Renewable Energy\n\nThe use of renewable energy sources has gained traction as a solution to the environmental challenges related with bitcoin mining. Renewable energy, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, provides a more environmentally friendly way to power mining operations. Some cryptocurrency miners are shifting their operations to places with ample renewable energy in order to lessen their carbon impact while retaining profitability.\n\nProof-of-Stake (PoS) Innovations\n\nPoS, an alternate consensus process, has developed as a more environmentally friendly choice than PoW. Unlike PoW, PoS does not necessitate miners solving complicated riddles. Instead, validators are chosen based on the number of coins they own and are ready to \"stake\" as collateral. Because it eliminates the need for resource-intensive computations, this method dramatically reduces energy use.\n\nMining Equipment that Saves Energy\n\nEfforts are being made to create more energy-efficient mining equipment. Some businesses are looking at using graphics processing units (GPUs) instead of power-hungry ASICs. GPUs, which are widely used in gaming and have a lower energy footprint, have the potential to make mining more sustainable.\n\nInitiatives for Carbon Offset and Sustainability\n\nSome cryptocurrency initiatives are taking proactive measures to reduce their carbon footprint. They accomplish this by investing in environmental projects or acquiring carbon credits equal to their emissions. These initiatives seek to mitigate the negative environmental impact of their operations.\n\nInitiatives Led by the Community\n\nThe cryptocurrency community is also pushing for environmentally friendly alternatives. Discussions regarding lowering energy consumption and shifting to PoS techniques are becoming more popular. Miners and fans can exchange ideas and work on sustainable mining techniques through online forums and social media platforms.\n\nAccountability and Regulations by the Government\n\nGrowing environmental concerns have generated ideas about governmental measures to ensure responsible cryptocurrency mining. Governments are looking for measures to encourage miners to use renewable energy sources or to impose energy usage caps.\n\nBalancing Responsibility and Innovation\n\nAs the bitcoin landscape evolves, it is critical to strike a balance between innovation and environmental responsibility. While cryptocurrencies have the potential to change economics and encourage technological growth, they must not come at the expense of the well-being of the world. The pursuit of environmentally friendly solutions is an important step toward ensuring that the benefits of cryptocurrencies do not jeopardize environmental sustainability.\n\nEthereum's Energy-Efficient Upgrade: A Game Changer for Blockchain\n\nAfter much anticipation, Ethereum, a leading cryptocurrency, has successfully implemented a groundbreaking network upgrade, transitioning from a proof-of-work system to proof-of-stake. This transformation has had a significant environmental impact, reducing Ethereum's energy consumption by over 99%.\n\nThe move towards a proof-of-stake model is in response to growing criticism of the cryptocurrency industry's substantial energy usage. In contrast, Bitcoin, Ethereum's counterpart, is maintaining its proof-of-work system. In this system, highly specialized computers engage in a competitive process to validate transactions and generate new coins, a process commonly known as mining.\n\nNotably, the energy-intensive process of mining Bitcoin consumed 75.4 terawatt hours in 2020, surpassing the electricity consumption of entire countries like Austria or Portugal. Ethereum's shift from mining to validation represents a significant shift in its energy consumption model. Validators, responsible for verifying transactions, are rewarded with ether coins for their efforts.\n\nTo ensure the integrity of the validation process, validators are required to make a security deposit by staking a specified quantity of ether coins within the network. If a validator attempts to compromise the network's security, they risk losing their stake. Ethereum proponents argue that this penalty mechanism enhances the network's security.\n\nBitcoin enthusiasts, however, continue to support the proof-of-work system, viewing it as a tried-and-tested approach to securing the network. Nonetheless, Bitcoin faces mounting scrutiny due to its energy consumption, particularly amidst global climate concerns. Consequently, some prominent Bitcoin miners are turning to renewable energy sources for their operations and attempting to reframe Bitcoin's energy use as a positive force, attracting investments to the aging national power grid.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe environmental concerns raised by Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining highlight the complicated relationship between technology, economics, and the environment. As cryptocurrencies become more widely accepted, the sector is being forced to find innovative and long-term solutions to lessen its carbon footprint.\n\nVarious paths are being studied, ranging from renewable energy integration to consensus process advances. In a world increasingly concerned with environmental well-being, the convergence of technological ingenuity with environmental consciousness will be critical in determining the future of cryptocurrencies."

        "title": "Aussie fintech prays for crypto clarity as it launches Bitcoin-backed loans - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Australian fintech firm Block Earner is charging ahead with plans to launch a crypto-backed loans product, despite staring down an upcoming court date with the financial regulator for allegedly offering financial products without a license.\n\nThe new crypto loan product allows Australian crypto investors to use crypto as collateral to borrow cash. Similarly, a Colorado-based lending platform called SALT offers crypto-backed loans to U.S. clients. The major cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase once offered a similar service to its U.S. customers but shuttered it in May this year.\n\nThe initial rollout from Block Earner is expected at the end of September and will initially only allow loans using Bitcoin as collateral.\n\nBlock Earner co-founder Charlie Karaboga told Cointelegraph that the new loan products have been designed in a \u201cvery conservative way\u201d in a bid to fit neatly into an existing licensing model.\n\nAustralia's 1st Crypto-Backed Loans\n\n\n\nBorrow Australian dollars without selling your crypto, using your #Bitcoin or Ethereum as security\n\n\n\nThe first 1000 waitlist sign ups enjoy their first 30 days interest free*\n\n\n\nJoin the Waitlist https://t.co/cfbRiiuSwr\n\n\n\nThread \u2b07\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/V55z5BXfOa \u2014 Block Earner (@blockearner) September 7, 2023\n\nKaraboga\u2019s firm was burned in last November when it was sued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission for allegedly offering crypto-linked fixed-yield earning products without an Australian Financial Services (AFS) license.\n\nAt the time, Karaboga lashed out against the regulator for its lack of clarity, claiming that his firm had spent considerable time and resources building out products he believed were compliant with ASIC\u2019s existing guidelines.\n\n\u201cOur position remains the same. There is no clear regulation in Australia.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike any company in the fintech ecosystem, before we launched the product we got legal opinions. We think that there was no sufficient regulation, or sufficient licenses for us to apply,\u201d Karaboga added.\n\nHowever, Charlie said that the regulatory moves against Block Earner and competitor crypto company Finder were largely reactive and likely due to the collapse of FTX in November.\n\n\"ASIC has commenced civil penalty proceedings in the Federal Court against fintech company Block Earner alleging it provided unlicensed financial services in relation to its crypto-asset based products...\" https://t.co/MpgKojxRRG #cryptolaw \u2014 Aaron Lane (@AMLane_au) November 23, 2022\n\n\u201cWe were impacted, unfortunately, most likely probably because we were more visible with our product compared to others, because they were using as an ancillary product, whereas we were using a core product.\u201d\n\nDespite being unaffected by the fallout of FTX, in the wake of ASIC\u2019s legal action, Karaboga said he closed the company\u2019s \u201cearn\u201d products and paid back all users.\n\nThe company appears to have learned its lesson. James Coombes, head of business at Block Earner, said the new launch wouldn\u2019t see the same fate as their Earn product, as it already fits within the rules of an Australian credit license.\n\n\u201cThere is a core difference,\u201d said Coombes. \u201cThe Earn product \u2014 there was no clear guidance on whether or not a license was required, and that\u2019s why we hold a conflicting view. Whereas this one, the clear guidance is that a license is required to provide consumer credit. So we went and got the license.\u201d\n\nHopes for clarity\n\nLooking forward, Karaboga said that faster regulatory progression in jurisdictions such as Singapore, Hong Kong and the United Kingdom will pressure the Australian government to catch up, or risk losing market share of crypto enterprises.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m expecting within 12 to 18 months, we\u2019ll see some more clarity.\u201d\n\nKaraboga explained that because Australia is one of the wealthiest countries by way of per-capita GDP and because Australians were \u201cearly starters\u201d in the crypto industry, its citizens had become prime targets for scammers.\n\nUltimately, Karaboga asserted that domestic regulators are firmly pro-crypto and want to \u201cpush that innovation\u201d moving forward.\n\nThis is a view that was shared by Binance Australia General Manager Ben Rose, who recently told Cointelegraph he was confident that Aussie regulators would side with crypto in the long term.\n\nAs recently as Sept. 6, Coinbase listed Australia as one of its primary locations for expansion outside of the U.S.\n\nBlock Earner\u2019s Federal Court hearing is scheduled for November this year, with a decision to be handed down by January.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: How to protect your crypto in a volatile market \u2014 Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in"

        "title": "ChatGPT breaks down 9 factors that can end Bitcoin as we know it - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Proponents of Bitcoin (BTC) argue that its decentralized nature offers protection against threats encountered by traditional financial systems. Nevertheless, like any other financial or investment product, Bitcoin is not immune to various threats that could potentially affect its existence.\n\nIn this context, Finbold sought insights from the artificial intelligence platform ChatGPT developed by OpenAI to understand the factors that could potentially bring about the end of Bitcoin as we know it. We posed the question, \u2018What can end Bitcoin as we know it?\u2019 to the most advanced ChatGPT-4 premium AI version. Through this analysis, it became apparent that the pioneering cryptocurrency faces a spectrum of challenges, both external and internal, which are highlighted below:\n\n#1. Technical vulnerabilities\n\nThe tool suggested that one of the most discussed vulnerabilities is the dreaded 51% attack. If a single entity gains control of over 50% of the Bitcoin network\u2019s computational power, it could potentially wreak havoc. Such an entity could double-spend coins or halt transactions. ChatGPT acknowledged that although this type of attack is expensive and unlikely to be financially practical, stating that at the moment, it remains a theoretical threat.\n\nAnother technical vulnerability is quantum computing. ChatGPT states that if quantum computers become powerful enough, they could break Bitcoin\u2019s cryptographic security measures. It is worth noting that the crypto community has since identified this risk with plans to quell it.\n\n#2. Regulatory and legal challenges\n\nBitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature has made it an attractive option for those looking to circumvent traditional financial systems. However, this very characteristic puts it in the crosshairs of governments worldwide. As per ChatGPT, regulatory crackdowns and bans on Bitcoin could significantly impact its adoption and drive users toward other digital assets or traditional currencies. In general, regulatory uncertainty is a constant shadow that the cryptocurrency world must navigate, making it a persistent concern for the future of Bitcoin.\n\n#3. Economic factors\n\nBitcoin\u2019s value and adoption have been intricately tied to economic factors for years. Therefore, ChatGPT pointed out that a significant loss of confidence in Bitcoin due to major financial losses, large-scale fraud, or other scandals could lead to reduced adoption and value. At the same time, it cited threats such as a newer cryptocurrency or technology emerging with vastly superior features, which might overshadow Bitcoin\u2019s first-mover advantage.\n\n#4. Environmental concerns\n\nThe viability of Bitcoin has been questioned over the cryptocurrency\u2019s Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus. Against this backdrop, the AI tool pointed out that critics argue that its energy consumption is unsustainable and harmful to the planet. Therefore, if concerns about its energy consumption continue to grow, there may be a substantial shift towards more eco-friendly cryptocurrencies or consensus mechanisms, potentially eroding Bitcoin\u2019s dominance. As the world becomes increasingly conscious of environmental issues, Bitcoin\u2019s environmental footprint remains a point of contention. However, it is worth noting that major miners are trying to turn to renewable energy sources for Bitcoin mining.\n\n#5. Scaling issues\n\nChatGPT acknowledged that Bitcoin has faced persistent challenges in terms of transaction speed and costs, especially during heightened demand. While initiatives such as the Lightning Network have been introduced to tackle these issues, the risk of an inadequate scaling solution could potentially hinder Bitcoin\u2019s ability to achieve wider adoption. The ongoing challenge of scaling is a critical issue that the Bitcoin community must continue to tackle to uphold its status as a viable digital currency.\n\n#6. Internal conflicts\n\nInternal disputes within the Bitcoin community have sporadically arisen, particularly concerning its development trajectory. ChatGPT warns that should these disagreements escalate, they have the potential to result in additional forks, similar to the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) split, which could ultimately erode the community\u2019s cohesion. The tool notes that sustaining a unified vision for Bitcoin\u2019s future is imperative for its enduring success in the long run.\n\n#7. Catastrophic events\n\nThe AI tool suggests that the Bitcoin network is not immune to global disruptions. Natural disasters, widespread infrastructure failures, or global-scale cyber-attacks could disrupt the Bitcoin network, causing temporary or long-term damage. The resilience of the Bitcoin network in the face of unforeseen events remains an ongoing concern.\n\n#8. Mass Adoption of CBDCs\n\nGovernments such as the United States and China are actively exploring the potential of digital currencies, which could lead to the introduction of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) as potential substitutes for cryptocurrencies. In this case, ChatGPT opines that if prominent nations successfully deploy and endorse their CBDCs, these could present a more secure and regulated option compared to Bitcoin for everyday transactions, potentially diminishing Bitcoin\u2019s attractiveness. The advent of CBDCs poses a notable competitive challenge to Bitcoin.\n\n#9. Loss of key infrastructure\n\nIt is worth noting that the cryptocurrency ecosystem relies heavily on exchanges and wallet providers. Therefore, ChatGPT suggested that if a major exchange or wallet provider collapses or faces severe security issues, it could undermine confidence in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem and impact Bitcoin. Therefore, safeguarding the infrastructure of the cryptocurrency world is essential to maintaining trust and stability.\n\nIn conclusion, while Bitcoin has withstood numerous challenges and has a resilient community of users and developers, it remains vulnerable to various internal and external factors. Staying abreast of these potential threats and actively addressing them will be crucial for the continued success and relevance of Bitcoin as a global digital currency."

There are no substantial changes to the price of any of the top thirty cryptocurrencies by market capitalization from last weekend, except Stellar (XLM).\n\nXLM holders saw their stash grow 10% over the week, and the token now trades for $0.124846. The rally appears to have been caused by a tweet from the Stellar team, posted on Saturday, that says, \u201cSomething cool is dropping in 10 days.\u201d\n\nIn the news\u2026\n\nAfter the slow news cycles of the last fortnight, this week saw a return to the usual slew of adoption announcements, although any indication of political breakthroughs for crypto over in Washington was pretty thin on the ground.\n\nOn Monday, the London Stock Exchange Group announced that it is using blockchain technology to build an exchange offering tokenized versions of traditional financial assets. LSEG is currently in talks with multiple regulatory bodies about it, including the UK government and HM Treasury.\n\nThat day, European Central Bank executive board member Fabio Panetta took aim at stablecoins issued by private companies like PayPal, which launched its own dollar-pegged PayPal USD (PYUSD) last month.\n\nSpeaking at the European Parliament\u2019s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs meeting on Monday, Panetta said his main criticism of PYUSD and similar coins is that \u201cprivate providers of payment services, including PayPal, have no incentive to limit the take-up of their stablecoins or the range of services they provide. Quite the opposite: their objective is to expand their customer base and gain market share.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn the other hand, Panetta thinks the proposed European central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital euro, \u201cwould pay due attention to orderly adjustments in the financial sector while offering payment service providers a platform for innovations with pan-euro area reach,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, top-five South Korean financial conglomerate Hana Financial Group announced a partnership between its KEB Hana Bank and crypto custodian BitGo for late 2024.\n\nThe new deal ties a major domestic financial player to the crypto industry, although KEB Hana Bank has already taken steps into blockchain when it opened a digital branch in metaverse platform The Sandbox.\n\nCrypto-friendly payments giant Visa said on Tuesday that it has now expanded its settlement options to include USDC on the Solana blockchain. The company also announced that it was working with merchant acquirers Worldpay and Nuvei to allow them to settle using USDC instead of fiat.\n\nOn Wednesday, The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)\u2014recognized by the SEC as the designated accounting standard setter for public companies\u2014voted unanimously to change how companies disclose crypto holdings in order to give greater transparency to the trade. The new rules take effect in 2025.\n\nTwo global financial regulators, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the G20\u2019s risk watchdog, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), on Thursday released a white paper outlining their plans for coordinated action to ensure that there is a \u201ccomprehensive policy and regulatory response for crypto-assets [as it] is necessary to address the risks of crypto-assets to macroeconomic and financial stability.\u201d\n\nWhile the paper\u2019s authors acknowledge that crypto doesn\u2019t currently pose a risk to the financial system, they argue that widespread adoption would undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy.\n\nThe paper recommends constituencies \u201csafeguard monetary sovereignty and strengthen monetary policy frameworks, guard against excessive capital flow volatility and adopt unambiguous tax treatment of crypto-assets\u201d to protect themselves from risks.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Sustainable bitcoin miner Iris Energy reported receiving $2.3 million in power credits last month, primarily driven by voluntary curtailment at its Childress site in Texas during peak demand.\n\nThe company mined 410 bitcoin, creating a revenue of $11.4 million, according to its latest investor update for August. It spent $6.6 million on electricity, which was reduced to $4.3 million due to the credits.\n\nThis resulted in a profit of $7.1 million, averaging out at $17,300 profit per bitcoin.\n\nMining bitcoin with renewable energy\n\nAround 97% of the power used for its mining operations come directly from renewable energy sources, while the remaining 3% come via renewable energy credits.\n\nIris Energy situates its mining operations near renewable energy sources, such as hydro power stations. In the case of its Canal Flats operation, it absorbs some of the power station's excess capacity.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\n\"Energy market volatility (e.g. lots of wind, solar, weather events) and our tech stack then dynamically trading bitcoin mining profitability against electricity market pricing. I.e. automatically pivoting between highest and best use of our power,\" said Iris Energy co-founder and co-CEO Daniel Roberts, in response to a query about the energy costs on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nThe power credits were received as part of a state program in Texas that offers energy credits to bitcoin miners to lower their energy use during periods of congestion on the grid. Rival bitcoin mining firm Riot Platforms received $31.7 million for similarly lowerering its usage in August.\n\nLast month, Iris Energy also announced an initial purchase of 248 NVIDIA artificial intelligence H100 GPUs for around $10 million. While bitcoin mining remains its core operation, the company said next-generation data centers serving burgeoning computing markets like generative AI represent an additional opportunity.\n\nAverage bitcoin miner revenue per TH/s has fallen 40% since May, according to The Block's data dashboard \u2014 coinciding with a fall in the price of bitcoin and the increasing total hashrate on the network."

Discover SCENE\n\nThe Texas Bitcoin mining industry is lucky to have the backing of Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nCruz, who announced his withdrawal from the Republican presidential race in February, was on Fox News Radio this week touting the benefits Bitcoin mining is bringing to the lone star state.\n\nReferring to how Bitcoin can help energy grids during batches of extreme weather, Cruz stated \u201cI am a big believer in Bitcoin mining and cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBitcoin mining can enhance the resiliency of the grid,\u201d the senator continued, explaining how machines can easily power down in \u201ctimes of crisis,\u201d becoming \u201cemergency reservoirs of power.\u201d\n\nTexas is going through a bout of inclement weather at the moment. Recording its second hottest summer on record, the state\u2019s local grid\u2014which supplies power to 25 million Texans, roughly 90% of the state\u2014was forced to implement emergency measures.\n\nThese measures meant Bitcoin miners needed to curtail their energy consumption, generating millions of dollars in revenue to some mining companies due to how their power purchase agreements with the utility function.\n\nCruz added that while Bitcoin mining itself creates a lot of value, in times of dire weather conditions, these machines can be shut off \u201cin seconds.\u201d He said that this can \u201cfree up energy for hospitals and to heat people\u2019s homes,\u201d staunchly defending the industry.\n\nHe went on to tweet: \u201cTexas is a hub for jobs, innovation, and freedom,\u201d concluding that the state is \u201ca natural oasis for Bitcoin mining.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSenator Cruz is very on point with Bitcoin,\u201d said Dennis Porter, co-founder and CEO of the Satoshi Act Fund, a non-profit that advocates for positive policymaking with regards to Bitcoin mining.\n\nPorter told Decrypt that although he doesn\u2019t always agree with Cruz, nor do many of his pro-Bitcoin circle on the left, they \u201clike his stance on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nA Texas senator since 2013, Cruz has announced he will be running for senatorial re-election next year.\n\nPoliticians from both sides of the U.S. aisle have been slowly warming up to Bitcoin and digital assets.\n\nSeveral Republican presidential hopefuls have openly endorsed some form of cryptocurrency, whether through legislative processes or by calling out SEC chairman Gary Gensler. These include Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, and Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina.\n\nDemocrats might be a bit leery when it comes to openly expressing support for crypto, but there are some notable backers. One example is the Senator from New York, Kirsten Gillibrand, who co-sponsored a bill with Republican Senator Cynthis Lummis that would establish clear-cut crypto regulations.\n\nPorter explained that he is \u201cexcited to see the number of pro-BTC presidential candidates because it shows just how much the space has grown.\u201d\n\nThe policy advocate told Decrypt that \u201csmart politicians have noticed that Bitcoin is a winning issue,\u201d concluding that these politicians \u201ccan attract a new type of voter and donor by aligning with Bitcoin and ensuring the USA leads on this technology.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere are staunch detractors in Washington D.C., however. Notably, Senator Elizabeth Warren leads the charge, along with Senator Brad Sherman from California, both Democrats. Republican Senator Roger Marshall has also been tagged as a member of the \u201cAnti-Crypto Army,\u201d calling it a \u201cnational security threat.\u201d"

The outlook leaves investors cautious and the circumspect could extend into the weekend, which is known for low trading volume.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: BTC could revisit $21,000 as sell signals multiply ahead of US CPI.\n\nBitcoin price lacks directional bias, make-or-break support nearby\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is moving west, consolidating within a narrow range after breaking below a crucial support level during the August 17 crash. With weekends known to be rather lulled, the odds of a move north are slim unless large holders act.\n\nThe $24,995 support level is a \u2018make-or-break\u2019 for Bitcoin price. A decisive break below would send BTC to the psychological $24,000 and mark a bearish shift in trend. In the dire case, seller momentum could see the king of crypto hit $21,915, levels last seen around mid-March.\n\nBoth the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator and the RSI recently gave buy signals. The RSI rose out of oversold territory at the end of August and the MACD line crossed above its signal line in negative territory at the same time. Despite these signals only reflecting a brief dead-cat bounce in price that quickly fell back at the start of September, there is still a possibility of a recovery evolving.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nA resurgence by the bulls could provide such an impetus for Bitcoin price, fueling a recovery to the upside. Such a move could send BTC above the 200-, 50-, and eventually the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $27,066, $27,414, and $27,763 levels before ultimately restoring above the support offered by the ascending trendline at $29,692.\n\nIn a highly ambitious case, Bitcoin price could foray into the zone above the psychological $30,000 before tagging $31,518. While the possibility for a northbound move remains bleak in the near term, it would constitute a 20% climb above current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin all-time high in 2025? BTC price idea reveals 'bull run launch\u2019\n\nEthereum price tests the $1,621 support\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is testing the $1,621 support level, which is shaky ground, considering momentum is fading.\n\nA drop below this buyer congestion level with a lot of uncollected liquidity hanging beneath could see ETH test the $1,529 support level.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, revitalized momentum among bulls could see Ethereum price pivot at $1,621 before forging north to the 50-day EMA at $1,734. The ascension could extend, possibly reaching the area where the 200- and 100-day EMAs appear to converge at $1,762 and $1,773, respectively.\n\nWith the right momentum, inspired by a strong move by Bitcoin, the price could see Ethereum price hit $1,841, an area last tested on August 15.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum whales accumulate ETH as researchers explore scaling beyond EIP-4844.\n\nRipple price breaks out from a bearish trend, decisive?\n\nRipple (XRP) price has broken out from a descending parallel channel after the exhaustion blow-off move lower on August 17. These are both bullish signs that the downtrend has finished. Further confirmation would be provided should the remittance token record a daily candlestick close above the 200-day EMA at $0.5233.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nIf sidelined investors or late buyers come in, the increased buying momentum could see Ripple price tag, or in a highly bullish case, overcome the resistance presented by the confluence resistance area between the 100-day and 50-day EMAs at $0.5547 and $0.5580 levels respectively.\n\nOvercoming these hurdles could clear the way for Ripple price to reach the psychological $0.7000 level. This would indicate a 15% drop.\n\nFrom a bearish perspective, there is still a risk Ripple price could slip back below the upper boundary of the descending channel and potentially extend to the July 13 lows around $0.4600. This would represent an 8% fall. In a dire case, Ripple price could extend to the midline of the bearish technical formation at $0.4191.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price likely to slump as pro-XRP attorney Deaton analyzes the Howey memo and Hinman speech"

        "title": "Ordinals upgrade to 'complete' core features, Bitcoin NFT 'Provenance' to launch this month - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Nonprofit Open Ordinals Institute CEO Erin Redwing joined Albert Liang on the Bitcoin Startup Lab podcast recently as the project seeks to advance the development of the Ordinals protocol, the NFT, and a digital collectibles platform built on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nRedwing said a highly anticipated feature called provenance which establishes authorship and ownership of inscribed data. For example, an artist can create a \u201cparent\u201d inscription representing themselves as the author. When they inscribe each NFT in a collection, that transaction also includes the parent inscription, proving the relationship between the author and the individual NFT inscription.\n\nThis creates a hierarchical tree structure, allowing collections to be organized under authors and even sub-collections. The tree structure also enables proving when a collection is complete. For example, an artist can send the parent inscription to an unspendable address like Satoshi\u2019s wallet to show no more NFTs can be added to that collection. According to Redwing, provenance provides the core features enabling digital ownership. Artists should prepare by thinking about their hierarchy of parent and child inscriptions before it launches.\n\n\u201cOnce we get provenance, the core features of the protocol will be out,\u201d Redwing said. She believes it will accelerate adoption from artists and collectors who want to leverage Bitcoin\u2019s immutability for establishing scarcity.\n\nThe nonprofit was formed to fund open-source protocol improvements neutrally. Redwing said the community\u2019s investment via donations creates incentives to keep development unbiased toward any specific group\u2019s interests.\n\nThe protocol\u2019s development was kickstarted by the sudden popularity after the release of the inscribing tool in January. Letting people inscribe data into Bitcoin transactions immediately caught attention across the ecosystem.\n\nRedwing explained paying for data inscription is part of what gives the NFTs value as exclusive digital art. However, the nonprofit is considering grants to help onboard artists who want to create collections.\n\nOther improvements aim to optimize data usage. For example, \u201crecursion\u201d reuses previously inscribed data to reduce fees. Artists are also getting creative with compact representations.\n\nDonations fund the core developer Raph\u2019s full-time work and other improvements planned through community input. Redwing said the nonprofit provides transparency on how funds are used to support the protocol directly.\n\nThe Open Ordinals Institute believes the technology has potential far beyond generative art and collecting. Redwing said the right innovations combine Bitcoin\u2019s resilience with creative vision to drive utility. But provenance is the milestone that will push the Ordinals into its full potential."

        "content": "Bitcoin was struggling to hold some gains on Friday. All eyes are set on India's G-20 presidency, where crypto regulations are likely to be discussed. Just banning cryptocurrency won't eliminate its risks, a joint policy roadmap published by global standard setters Thursday said.\n\n\n\nA joint policy paper on crypto published by the IMF and FSB warned jurisdictions against implementing blanket bans to mitigate risks associated with the sector, and recommended targeted restrictions and sound monetary policy instead. Targeted restrictions might come in handy for emerging economies in particular, it said.\n\n\n\nBitcoin posted smart gains on Friday as the largest crypto token rose more than 2 per cent to regain $26,300-levels. Its largest peer, Ethereum, also moved about a per cent up to hover around $1,650-mark. Price action in the altcoins remained on the positive lines with mild gains.\n\n\n\nBitcoin's value is currently trading around the $26,200 level. This positive price movement might be because of a paper that came out yesterday from the IMF and the G20\u2019s Financial Stability Board, said Edul Patel, CEO & Co-Founder at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"The paper said that banning all cryptocurrencies wouldn't work well in the long term and suggested using targeted restrictions and a comprehensive monetary strategy instead. Ethereum, on the other hand, is trading above the $1600 level,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring a few exceptions, all top crypto tokens were trading slightly higher on Friday. However, the gains were capped. Other than Bitcoin, Solana gained about 2 per cent. BNB, Polkadot and Litecoin added about a per cent each. Among the losers, Toncoin and Polygon shed about 2 per cent.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly higher, rising to $1.05 trillion-mark, as it gained more than one per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes dropped as much as 7 per cent to $24.98 billion.\n\n\n\nThe crypto market has picked up for the second consecutive day. The fear and greed index also jumped 5 points since yesterday and is currently in the fear zone with a score of 46/100. Most of the top 10 cryptos by market capitalization are trading in the green, said Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead at CoinSwitch Ventures.\n\n\n\n\"The investor sentiment seems to have been slightly boosted after news about JPMorgan exploring a blockchain-based payment and settlement system,\" he added. \"The much-awaited synthesis paper that has been jointly prepared by FSB and IMF was published for the public yesterday, which underlines the importance of a global regulatory framework.\"\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nEthereum is currently attempting a rebound after failing to break the $1,675 resistance level.After recording short-term gains last month, the asset has declined 9.2% since mid-August.The price action has been registering short line candles in the daily chart, indicating that ETH will continue moving sideways in medium term.\n\n\n\nImage: Chart-ETH\n\n\n\nThe asset is currently trading below its 20-day moving average of $1,670 which acts as an immediate resistance level.Its RSI reading is currently at 40, slightly in oversold territory.If ETH is unable to break through the $1,700 barrier this week, the price may consolidate around $1,650 levels for a while.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $1,625,$1,585\n\nResistance: $1,670, $1,700, $1,735\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

Discover SCENE\n\nExactly two years after establishing Bitcoin as legal tender, El Salvador\u2019s Ministry of Education began its pilot program on Thursday to bring Bitcoin education to the nation\u2019s public schools.\n\nThe program, launched in partnership with native Bitcoin projects Bitcoin Beach and My First Bitcoin, will teach 150 public school teachers about Bitcoin, before the educators return to their own classrooms in their local schools.\n\nAs early as 2018, crypto had already penetrated the world of higher education. A Coinbase report that year found that 42 of the world\u2019s top 50 universities had at least one course on crypto and blockchain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nClasses have begun! Instructors from @MyfirstBitcoin_ & @Bitcoinbeach are teaching public school teachers how to send and receive #Bitcoin Next week they will spread across the country to their local schools to do the same with their own students LFG! pic.twitter.com/WHF6auDraU \u2014 Mi Primer Bitcoin (@MyfirstBitcoin_) September 7, 2023\n\n\u201cOur teachers are ready\u2014they've been training, teaching, even themselves improving our own Bitcoin diploma for over a year,\u201d said John Dennehy, founder of My First Bitcoin, to Decrypt via DM. \u201cThe public school teachers are\u2014literally right now\u2014being trained.\u201d\n\nEl Salvador adopted Bitcoin as an official currency two years ago, garnering major attention for being the first country to run the experiment on a national scale. It has had some technical issues along the way, and on-the-ground adoption has been limited\u2014but tourism in the country has surged in response.\n\nSince launching in 2021, My First Bitcoin has already taught 25,000 in-person Salvadoran students. Last year, the non-profit developed a 10-week Bitcoin Diploma that is \u201copen-source\u201d\u2014meaning its contents are fully available and viewable online. Not unlike what colleges and universities have done with massive open online courses, or MOOCs.\n\nHaving already been used to help educate students across the nation, the Bitcoin Diploma was later used to teach staff from the Ministry of Education about Bitcoin and is now being used to train teachers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe 187-page student workbook features economic education, touching on subjects like the role of money, its evolution, and the \u201cdark side of fiat.\u201d It includes English, German, Korean, and Spanish translations.\n\nThe workbook\u2019s contents echo themes from the famous Bitcoin book \"The Bitcoin Standard,\" whose author Saifedean Ammous now advises El Salvador President Nayib Bukele. \u201cDebasement of currency occurs when the government reduces the value of its currency by increasing the money supply or decreasing the quality of the currency,\u201d reads a passage in chapter 3.\n\nDennehy clarified that Ammous made no direct contributions to the course material, which was devised by a \u201csmall team of teachers\u201d in El Salvador and the United States. However, a version of the Diploma was once reviewed by popular Bitcoin and Lightning developer Giacomo Zucco.\n\n\u201cIt's been a bumpy road to get there but throughout the past two years the students have been extremely receptive,\u201d wrote Dennehy.\n\nMy First Bitcoin currently works with grassroots education initiatives in over 20 countries, including multiple states in the US, Canada, the UK, Hong Kong, Guatemala, Cuba, and others.\n\nRegarding state education, Dennehy said that two additional Latin American governments have already reached out to My First Bitcoin over the past month for potential collaboration on Bitcoin education.\n\nFurthermore, the non-profit is in early-stage collaboration with a state government in Mexico for a pilot teaching 250 students about Bitcoin, with help from Bitcoin-supportive senator Indria Kempis Martinez.\n\n\u201cWe expect to continue to expand at a rapid pace,\u201d said Dennehy. \u201cEl Salvador is the focus, but the mission is the world.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "MicroStrategy to avoid reporting massive Bitcoin loss\n\nMicroStrategy (MSTR) is set to change how it reports its bitcoin (BTC) holdings each quarter, as the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has voted to alter the crypto reporting rules.\n\nOverall, the move is seen as a positive step for the crypto market and will provide investors with more transparency. Currently, cryptocurrencies are treated as intangible assets, resulting in conservative accounting that dings company earnings when crypto prices drop.\n\nThe new changes will allow MicroStrategy to avoid recognizing impairment losses if the price of bitcoin drops during a quarter. Since initiating its bitcoin acquisition strategy in August 2020, the Virginia-based business intelligence firm has reported $2.23 billion in cumulative impairment losses. The largest impairment loss of $917.8 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2022.\n\nThese losses have sometimes given the impression that the company\u2019s inherent value was negatively affected, even when it wasn\u2019t.\n\nThe move comes after the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has voted to allow companies to use fair-value accounting, enabling them to immediately show gains and losses on their income statements. This means that businesses can recognize recoveries in value after price declines, which is an improvement over the current practice.\n\nThe FASB is expected to formally approve the final language of this change later this year, and companies can then adopt the new standards.\n\nMichael Saylor, Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, tweeted that this rule update eliminates a major impediment to corporate adoption of bitcoin as a treasury asset. While the FASB has stated that the new rules will take effect as soon as 2025, companies will have the option to apply them earlier, and MicroStrategy is expected to do so.\n\nMicroStrategy has long urged that US accounting standards should be reconsidered to accommodate companies that hold cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets. Currently, MicroStrategy reports its cryptocurrency holdings as intangible assets, which are then impaired if the value dips. However, the value can never be revised upward if the crypto price increases.\n\nThe analytics software maker, led by bitcoin bull Michael Saylor, has taken advantage of any price drop in Bitcoin to continue beefing up its investment in the world\u2019s most-traded cryptocurrency.\n\nThis strategy, however, turned out to be a risky gamble. By the end of Q1 2022, MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin holdings were valued at approximately $5.9 billion. However, since then, the value has declined by around 22%. Throughout its venture into Bitcoin starting in 2020, MicroStrategy\u2019s stock price has frequently mirrored the fluctuations in Bitcoin\u2019s price."

        "content": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ethereum (ETH) have been caught in a whirlwind of changes, and there's a new contender that's making waves: Everlodge. Let's delve into the recent movements of these cryptocurrencies, and explore how they are shaping the future of digital finance.\n\nJoin the Everlodge\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) Price Soars After Grayscale Wins the SEC Case\n\nRecently, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has become popular because Grayscale won a case against the SEC. The cryptocurrency market went up after this news, and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was one of the coins that experienced maximum surge. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is now trading at around $220, which is the highest price it has been in a week.\n\nBut, these kinds of big changes are not always permanent. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is still 95.65% lower than its all-time high price. In the past week, the price has gone up by 12.96%, but in the last 24 hours, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has only gone up by 1.63%.\n\nHowever, the future of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is uncertain. While some analysts believe that Bitcoin Cash (BCH) could go up in price, others have a bearish outlook about it.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Releases New Guide to Replace Outdated Yellow Paper\n\nEthereum (ETH) has created a new guide, called Ethereum EELS. It is replacing the old Yellow Paper, which is not up-to-date. The EELS is easy to use, and has all the latest information about Ethereum (ETH).\n\nThe EELS provides a complete guide to how Ethereum (ETH) works at every stage. This is important because previous Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) only suggested changes, without explaining how they would fit into the existing Ethereum (ETH) framework.\n\nAs of now, Ethereum's (ETH) price is $1,646.42. While Ethereum (ETH) has grown by 2.98% in the past week, it has declined by 1.13% in the past 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH) is still 66.34% below its all-time high of $4,891.70.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG)\n\nThe average vacation rental owner earns $24,000 per year. But what if you could start earning passive income from vacation rentals without having to own, or manage a property? With Everlodge, you can do just that.\n\nEverlodge is a new platform that makes it easy to invest in vacation rentals. It is like Airbnb, but instead of renting out your own home, you can buy a share of a vacation rental for just $100, using Web3. The platform has already sold over 27 million tokens, and is valued at $0.012.\n\nELDG uses blockchain technology to make the process secure, and transparent. Each vacation rental is represented by a non-fungible token (NFT). NFTs are special digital items that you can buy and sell. When you buy an NFT, you are buying a share of the vacation rental.\n\nAdditionally, the marketplace will let you buy, sell, and invest in small parts of real estate properties, like villas, homes, and hotels. You can browse listings, purchase your vacation home, and start generating income, all in one place.\n\nThe platform will also have a launchpad where developers can raise money from the ELDG community.

        "content": "And while Canadian authorities moved against this funding source with the same alacrity and hammer-like intensity they displayed with the dollar-denominated fundraising sites, St. Louis was far more successful in distributing the money he raised to its intended recipients. According to the Rouleau Report, he managed to distribute 14.6 Bitcoin, or approximately $800,000, to the truckers. The remaining 6.7 Bitcoin, or less than $300,000, was eventually seized by police. (Note how the bulk of the left-hand orange line flows into the blue \u201cAvailable to protestors\u201d line on the chart\u2019s right side.)\n\nAs a recent documentary by the Reason Foundation explains, \u201cFinancial censorship, or cutting off access to the global banking system, is one of the most powerful tools that governments have for punishing people.\u201d The actions of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau government\u2019s during the convoy certainly meet the definition of financial censorship. Virtually anyone who tried to make a donation in Canadian legal tender via electronic means found their efforts ultimately stymied. At the same time, St. Louis\u2019 experience with Bitcoin suggests that cryptocurrencies may offer far greater personal privacy and, accordingly, stronger resistance to interference by third parties \u2013 including governments intent on exercising politically motivated financial censorship.\n\nHere is what you need to know about how it happened. And why Ottawa wants to make sure it never happens again.\n\nBitcoin for Beginners\n\nThe world\u2019s first cryptocurrency was created by an unknown person or group under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. \u201cWhat is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party,\u201d Satoshi wrote in the seminal document Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.\n\nBitcoin and newer cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Litecoin or Dogecoin rely on a foundational technology called blockchain. This is effectively a digital ledger, similar to the records of a banking statement, that allows a digital currency to fulfill the role of traditional money by acting as a unit of exchange. The necessary security is provided through advanced encryption \u2013 conversion of all data from a readable into an encoded form \u2013 hence the \u201ccrypto\u201d in cryptocurrencies.\n\nBlockchain has two key features. First, unlike traditional centralized databases, it exists on many computers, or nodes, around the globe. In this way it cannot be shut down; no single entity has control over it. Second, it is immutable. Every time a transaction occurs, it is recorded in an ever-lengthening chain of information blocks that cannot be tampered with. This chaining is done through a \u201cconsensus mechanism,\u201d which verifies the validity and security of any transaction. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments, the consensus mechanism operates without the need for a trusted intermediary, such as a bank, to oversee the process.\n\nSince Bitcoins are electronic, they can reside in a trading platform similar to how stocks and bonds are bought and sold. They can also be held in a crypto \u201cwallet.\u201d A crypto wallet is simply a place that holds the private digital key (similar to a login ID and password) necessary to access and manage a user\u2019s cryptocurrency. While this wallet can be digital, it can also be as rudimentary as a piece of paper printed with the key, or a \u201cseed phrase\u201d \u2013 25 random words that can be used to recover the key. A wallet can also be a special physical device with sophisticated tamper-proof security features, or a digital application (either online or locally installed) that holds the key and is used to interact with the cryptocurrency.\n\nAnother important aspect of cryptocurrencies is how they are created. Bitcoins are \u201cmined\u201d rather than minted or printed. Bitcoin miners compete with each other to solve the complex cryptography problems required to maintain the consensus mechanism, and are rewarded for their effort with new Bitcoin. Anyone can become a miner, as long as he or she has the necessary computer hardware and a data centre with a sufficiently robust air conditioning system to deal with the heat generated by all that computing effort. Financial success in mining thus becomes a race between the Bitcoin the miner earns and their electricity bill.\n\nHow to Seize Crypto \u2013 Simple and Advanced Techniques\n\nIf you hold your Bitcoin in a trading platform or online application wallet, your wallet is technically controlled by the third party that manages that platform or app. This unfortunately means a government can issue an order that the funds be blocked or transferred to another, government-controlled wallet address. In this sense, Bitcoin is no different from funds held in ordinary bank accounts or on the crowdfunding platforms Ottawa froze during last year\u2019s imposition of the Emergencies Act."

        "title": "Bitcoin price forecast: top in November 2025 - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Yesterday, a Bitcoin price prediction was published that reasons on the long term, i.e. on BTC cycles.\n\nIt was posted on X (formerly Twittter) by the crypto analyst who goes by the name CryptoCon.\n\nMaybe, I have finally cracked the #Bitcoin code.\n\n\n\nThe November 28th Cycles Theory has held the key.\n\n\n\nUsing 4-year time cycles against my Theory, produces Bitcoins exact behavior in time since its inception.\n\n\n\nCycles are centered around the\u2026 pic.twitter.com/EI8BUk285I \u2014 CryptoCon (@CryptoCon_) September 7, 2023\n\nBitcoin\u2019s cycles\n\nBitcoin has a definite cycle that lasts on average about three years and ten months.\n\nThis is the cycle interrupted by the halving of miners\u2019 rewards, which is Bitcoin\u2019s only monetary policy measure, and it is quite predictable.\n\nIn fact, a halving always occurs exactly every 210,000 blocks, and it typically takes about 10 minutes to mine a block.\n\nIn theory, therefore, a halving should occur every 4 years or so, but so far the actual average block time has always been slightly less than 10 minutes.\n\nThis means that, on average, a halving has occurred every three years and ten months.\n\nThe first block of the Bitcoin blockchain was mined on 3 January 2009, and the first halving took place in November 2012.\n\nThere have been three halving events to date (2012, 2016 and 2020), and in all three cases the following year triggered a major bull run (2013, 2017 and 2021), followed by a bear market the following year (2014, 2018 and 2022).\n\nThe halving is thought to reduce the supply of BTCs on the market, as miners are forced to sell the BTCs they receive on the market to finance the high costs of mining (especially electricity).\n\nIf they collect less, they have less to sell and this reduces supply, although not immediately.\n\nThe next cycle\n\nBitcoin\u2019s next cycle will begin with the fourth halving, which will occur exactly at the 840,000 block that is expected to be mined in April 2024, or May at the latest.\n\nCryptoCon\u2019s forecast shows that the bottom of every bear market has marked a reversal in bitcoin\u2019s price trend, and this seems to have happened even after last November\u2019s bang.\n\nWe are now effectively in the fourth phase of the fourth cycle, although the first cycle is somewhat different from the others, so it is often not included in comparisons.\n\nThe next halving will start the first phase of the fifth cycle, which in all three previous cases has been characterised by a period of rising BTC prices.\n\nThis has always been followed by a second phase, the speculative bubble, which in turn is followed by the third phase, the bear market.\n\nCryptoCon\u2019s Bitcoin Price Forecast\n\nAccording to CryptoCon, the next bull run should start on the 28th of November 2024, with the next all-time high expected in a timeframe between the beginning of November and the end of December the following year.\n\nThe next bear market low should be recorded in a timeframe between the beginning of November and the end of December 2026.\n\nCryptoCon does not make any price predictions here, only about the course of the next price cycle.\n\nIn fact, although in theory there should be no certainty about Bitcoin\u2019s price trend, there is certainty about the halving cycle, i.e. the fact that BTC\u2019s monetary policy is updated every approximately three years and ten months.\n\nCryptoCon calls this prediction \u201cThe November 28th Cycles Theory\u201d, as the start of the bull run, the peak of the bubble and the trough of the bear market have historically occurred around this date. The 28th of November is also the date of the first halving, that of 2012.\n\nWe would then be in the pause phase of the fourth cycle, which should last until the next halving. This is historically the longest phase of the cycle, during which the price of bitcoin hovers around half of its all-time high ($69,000 in November 2021).\n\nHalving and price: The long-term forecast for Bitcoin\n\nAlthough it is clear from the chart published by CryptoCon that the price of bitcoin has so far slavishly followed the halving cycle, it is important to distinguish between the two.\n\nThe fact is that the halving is a safe and predictable technical process, whereas the price trend is not, as it also depends on external factors.\n\nWhat is surprising, however, is that in all these years, with very different macroeconomic conditions, the price cycle of bitcoin has continued to follow exactly the rhythm outlined by the 28 November theory, as if the halving cycle, fixed and certain, had managed to prevail over the uncertain and fickle external conditions.\n\nIt is possible that such an ironclad monetary policy does in fact produce relatively constant and predictable effects, with external conditions mainly conditioning its extremes and the magnitude of the rises and falls.\n\nOn the other hand, CryptoCon does not say in this forecast what prices bitcoin might reach in the future, but only when the various up and down phases will begin and when future peaks are likely to be recorded."

        "title": "Bitcoin MVRV Ratio At Impressive Levels; Hints Buyers at Profits - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) price has been trading in the range of $31,000 to $25,000 for the past several months. Mostly, BTC sustained below $30,000 and it stayed even below $27,000 for the majority of the last month. Despite the trading price of crypto assets signaling the bearish sentiment, some crucial indicators are in favor.\n\nCrypto analytics platform IntoTheBlock brought crucial insights related to the MVRV ratio of Bitcoin. It noted that the MVRV ratio for Bitcoin is at 1.27, which is considered to be a significant level in comparison to the past levels. The ratio is treated as an important indicator that helps in identifying the highs and lows of an asset\u2019s price.\n\nMVRV can help pinpoint potential bottoms. When the value is <1, it signals that most people are at a loss. Historically, this has indicated the best buying opportunities. The current value for BTC is 1.27\n\n\ud83d\udd17https://t.co/K9v9RhiYXG pic.twitter.com/dFdeAYJKhe \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) September 6, 2023\n\n\u201cWhen the value is <1, it signals that most people are at a loss. Historically, this has indicated the best buying opportunities,\u201d it noted.\n\nTo define the MVRV ratio, the market capitalization of any asset is divided by the realized capitalization. It can also be considered as the proportion of the current price of an asset to its average price at the time of purchase.\n\nAs the analytics platform put it, the value of a ratio below 1 suggests the buyers\u2019 loss. But this is also interpreted as a signal to buy the asset. On the flip side, the increasing ratio suggests the buyers sit at considerable profits and it is usually followed by a sell-off in the efforts of profit bookings.\n\nCurrent MVRV Level Crucial for Bitcoin\n\nAccording to CryptoQuant data, the level of 1.2 has consistently served as a critical support level. Historical data shows that when this level was attained, Bitcoin prices tended to rise. While when it was breached, prices typically declined further.\n\nThe value of 1.27 at the time was somewhat uncertain, resembling a 50:50 situation. Bullish traders using leverage were looking for a significant rebound from this level, while bearish leveraged traders were anticipating the opposite outcome.\n\nDuring the period when Bitcoin\u2019s short-term movement was closely tied to the mentioned support line, there was a notable increase in activity from whale investors, particularly in terms of their interactions with cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $26,216 according to CoinMarketCap. In addition to the heightened whale activity, the overall market sentiment for the leading cryptocurrency appeared to have shifted positively, as indicated by the positive values of the weighted sentiment indicator."
