        "content": "What Is a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP)?\n\nBy Lipsa Das\n\nRead 5 min Beginner\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS: \u2014 Bitcoin Improvement Proposals, or BIPs, propose changes to how the core Bitcoin blockchain or associated communication protocols work.\n\n\n\n\u2014 There are three types of BIPs: Standards Track (for network changes), Informational (for general knowledge), and Process BIPs (for procedural changes).\n\n\n\n\u2014 BIPs have helped implement some of the most famous Bitcoin upgrades, like Segwit & Taproot.\n\nBitcoin \u2014 the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency \u2014 is entirely decentralized and autonomous. The entire network runs on miners and nodes: computers that run Bitcoin software and work to keep the network secure.\n\nThese miners and nodes decide on any upgrades to the network by a vote, completely free of any third party. These upgrades can range from bug fixes or feature changes to even hard forks, where the entire network splits!\n\nHowever, coordinating upgrades and achieving community consensus across a big blockchain network like Bitcoin takes work. That\u2019s where Bitcoin improvement proposals or BIPs come in.\n\nBitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIPs) allow community members to vote on protocol decisions in an organized way, even without centralized leadership.\n\nBut what are Bitcoin improvement proposals, and how do they work? If you want to understand the Bitcoin protocol, understanding the role of BIPs in the Bitcoin community is crucial. Let\u2019s dive in!\n\nWhat Is a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP)?\n\nA Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, or BIP, is a technical document that proposes changes, ideas, or enhancements to the core Bitcoin blockchain. These BIPs can range from general community guidelines to major changes to the protocol. However, each BIP usually focuses on making one key change to the blockchain. If you want to know how Ethereum processes similar changes, check out our article on what an EIP is.\n\nHow Do Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) Work?\n\nBIPs are the driving force behind the continuous evolution of the Bitcoin protocol, shaping the chain\u2019s future. Let\u2019s look at the creation and approval process.\n\nHow are Bitcoin Improvement Proposals Created?\n\nSince Bitcoin is an open-source protocol, anyone can propose a BIP by submitting an informal proposal to the Bitcoin developers\u2019 mailing list.\n\nSo how does that work?\n\nWell, firstly, Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) authors collect initial community feedback and vet the idea. Then, once the author has reasonable confidence in the idea\u2019s potential, they send a draft BIP to the mailing list.\n\nHere, the community discusses the idea and fleshes out the core points for and against the proposal. Proposal rejections are common at this stage, especially if there are obvious conflicts or duplicate BIPs. However, some proposals can also stay in the discussion stage for years if there is no consensus, for example, the Block size debate.\n\nIf the community agrees that the idea holds merit, the proposal gets a BIP number and becomes a BIP document. Then, BIP editors take up the task of making sure everything is accurate. The BIP moves from the \u201cinformal\u201d stage to the \u201cofficial\u201d proposal at this stage.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the BIP is not yet approved for development. Think of this as the filing and pre-trial stage of a lawsuit in court, when all of the details are written up, and the community feels the idea needs to be discussed more.\n\nThe community also publishes it to the Bitcoin Core Github repository of BIPs \u2014 a collection of all Bitcoin Proposals proposed so far.\n\nHow Are BIPs Approved?\n\nTo become part of the Bitcoin protocol, the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) must achieve consensus among the community. To do that, it undergoes thorough review and analysis by the developers and the broader Bitcoin community. This includes the potential benefits and drawbacks, pros and cons, and the overall time investment.\n\nIf there are any necessary code changes, developers also start testing and implementing the code. This process can be long and complicated.\n\nThe community rejects the BIP if the developers find the code is bad or introduces challenges that can\u2019t be resolved. Or, if everything looks okay, the community will begin implementing and activating it.\n\nTypes of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs)\n\nBIP approval process depends majorly on its type. There are three types of BIPs: Standards Track, Informational, or Process BIPs. Let\u2019s look at each of them and what they entail.\n\nStandards Track BIPs\n\nStandards Track BIPs are proposals that change the aspects of the protocol \u2014 transaction or block validation or encoding schemes. In the case of hard forks when the chain splits into two, Standard BIPs ensure interoperability between the legacy Bitcoin chains and the new ones. Since these BIPs involve significant code changes, they require community consensus.\n\nInformational BIPs\n\nInformational BIPs share knowledge and insight into Bitcoin\u2019s upcoming plans. These documents provide general guidelines, design issues, or information relevant to the Bitcoin community. Since they are more informational, they do not require community consensus.\n\nProcess BIPs\n\nProcess BIPs, or consensus BIPs, outline procedural aspects, guidelines, or changes to the decision-making process of Bitcoin or consensus mechanism. While they are similar to informational BIPs, they require consensus (a clear miner majority of 90%).\n\nConsensus BIPs are for changes outside the Bitcoin protocol, meaning they don\u2019t affect Bitcoin\u2019s codebase. For example, implementing a soft fork and updating old miner software across the network requires a Process BIP.\n\nFamous Bitcoin Improvement Proposals You Should Know About\n\nBitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) are key to the advancement of Bitcoin. In the last decade, BIPs have shaped the Bitcoin network, addressing critical issues and enhancing block capabilities.\n\nLet\u2019s look at some historic BIPs, their significance in Bitcoin development, and their ripple effect on the community.\n\nBIP 001 and 002\n\nThe first-ever BIP created by Amir Taaki, BIP 001 was essentially a proposal on what a BIP should be. In other words, it explains the process of submitting and discussing a BIP, going into detail about the types of BIPs, workflow, submission formats, and more.\n\nBIP 002, on the other hand, amends some of these guidelines, elaborates on key approval processes, and answers common questions about BIPs. It also adds BIP licensing, comments, and formatting guidelines.\n\nBoth of these BIPs were Process BIPs, which required the community to agree on them. Together, these two BIPs set the stage for the ongoing evolution of Bitcoin.\n\nBIP 8 & 9\n\nBIP 8 and BIP 9 are both consensus (process) BIPs that enable soft forks, backward-compatible changes to the Bitcoin protocol. Every soft fork is a major protocol change that the majority of the network participants agree with, so miners can just upgrade their software to remain in sync with the network.\n\nBIP 8 and 9 provide mechanisms for signaling and activating these soft fork changes.\n\nSegWit\n\nOne of the most popular Bitcoin upgrades, Segwit, was the result of a series of BIPs, namely BIP-91, BIP-141, and BIP-148. BIP-141 introduced the SegWit upgrade, while BIP-148 activated the soft fork to implement it. BIP-91, on the other hand, reduced the consensus threshold to 80%, for Segwit to pass successfully.\n\nSegwit made the Bitcoin network scalable by reducing the size of transaction data. With less metadata, Bitcoin blocks can fit more transactions, increasing overall speed after the Segwit upgrade. Segwit was also key for developing popular Bitcoin Layer 2 networks, such as Lightning.\n\nTaproot\n\nTaproot, the most recent upgrade to the Bitcoin protocol, consisting of three BIPs: BIP 340 (Schnorr signatures), BIP 341 (Taproot), and BIP 342 (Tapscript). With Taproot, the Bitcoin protocol is more privacy-friendly and can also support innovations like Ordinals.\n\nTaproot\u2019s initial idea proposal was in January 2018 by software developer Greg Maxwell. Post that, Bitcoin developers Pieter Wuille, Tim Ruffing, A.J. Townes, and Jonas Nick worked on implementing it. Almost four years after the initial proposal, Taproot was finally integrated in November 2021.\n\nNavigating The Bitcoin Network\n\nWhile the Bitcoin network evolves and changes with BIPs, Ledger has your back. Ledger Live adapts to all major Bitcoin changes quickly. For instance, Ledger Live supports both Segwit and Native Segwit accounts, ensuring inter-compatibility across the ecosystem.\n\nPlus, the Ledger ecosystem also allows you to run a full Bitcoin node yourself. As an advanced crypto user, you can take full advantage of Ledger Live while running your own Bitcoin node via Ledger SatStack. In short, you can become a part of the consensus process, and earn rewards for doing so. To learn more, make sure to check out the support article on how to run a bitcoin node.\n\nInteracting with the Bitcoin network safely is easy, if you take the right precautions that is. To stay safe while exploring the Bitcoin Ecosystem, consider protecting your assets with a hardware wallet. After all, not your keys, not your coins. Ledger devices offer you asset protection, but they also allow you full control over your assets and how you manage them."

        "title": "Analysis | Why the Frog Memecoin Craze Is a Stress Test for Bitcoin - The Washington Post",
        "content": "Bitcoin may be the most widely recognized name in crypto, but its chief rival Ethereum has cornered a bigger share of the recent innovation in digital assets, whether it\u2019s nonfungible tokens or decentralized finance apps. That\u2019s because Ethereum\u2019s underlying software is seen as more versatile and better able to handle bursts of activity without getting clogged up and slowing down. Now Bitcoin finds itself playing host to crypto\u2019s latest speculative frenzy, a frog-branded \u201cmemecoin\u201d called Pepe, putting the original crypto network\u2019s technology under strain.\n\n1. What are memecoins?\n\nMemecoins are digital tokens depicted with an image \u2014 often an animated character or animal \u2014 that can quickly gain notoriety and soar in value. Although they have little practical use, they can draw an exuberant community of followers who hoard or trade them. (The name takes its cue from so-called meme stocks, such as Gamestop Corp., that were seized upon by retail traders during the pandemic and driven to stratospheric valuations based on social media chatter.) There are hundreds of memecoins, some worth almost nothing, others with market values of $100 million or more. Investors often leap upon a newly minted memecoin when it starts trading on a digital exchange such as Coinbase or Robinhood. Others pile in after them for fear of missing out. One famous memecoin, Dogecoin, ascended to stardom when Elon Musk tweeted memes based on the coin, which inspired a number of dog-themed memecoins such as Shiba Inu.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. What happened this time?\n\nMore than 420 trillion frog-themed memecoins known as Pepe were created in little more than a month. The token was obsessively promoted on Twitter before and after its launch in April and soared to a market value of more than $1 billion in May before reversing course and plummeting more than 60% in the following days, according to data tracker CoinMarketCap.\n\n3. So another memecoin roller-coaster \u2014 what\u2019s new?\n\nShare this article Share\n\nMost memecoins were created and trade on Ethereum. Pepe is one of several that were minted not just on Ethereum but also on the Bitcoin system, using something known as the Ordinals protocol. Launched in January, Ordinals is effectively a new layer on top of the Bitcoin digital ledger, or blockchain, that allows users to attach data such as a serial number or an image to a satoshi \u2014 the smallest denomination of Bitcoin \u2014 allowing people to create Bitcoin NFTs. Subsequently, someone found a way to use Ordinals to mint tokens that are \u201cfungible,\u201d meaning others can be minted with the same characteristics and publicized on the Bitcoin network. At that point, Bitcoin memecoin mania took off in earnest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Why is that significant?\n\nThe Bitcoin community has traditionally been reluctant to allow such experimentation with its code for fear of overwhelming the network, so the latest development represents something of a leap into the unknown. It\u2019s also a delicate time for the biggest brand in the crypto world, which is bracing for a regulatory crackdown after a market rout in 2022 killed off several big industry names.\n\n5. Who gains and who loses?\n\nThe memecoin frenzy drove transaction fees on Bitcoin blockchain to their highest in almost two years. This brought a windfall to the \u201cminers\u201d who generate new Bitcoin by solving complex mathematical puzzles using banks of powerful computers. If memecoins and similar innovations propel ever more activity on the Bitcoin network, that could inflate the cost of using it and diminish its appeal as a virtual alternative to traditional currencies \u2014 its original purpose.\n\n--With assistance from Olga Kharif.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com"

        "title": "The geopolitics of Bitcoin: Exploring the implications for global power dynamics - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The geopolitics of Bitcoin refers to the political, economic and strategic ramifications of Bitcoin\u2019s rise and its impact on global power dynamics. The study of how geography, power and politics interact on a global scale is known as geopolitics.\n\nIt looks at how geographic elements like land, resources and boundaries affect politics, international relations and how power is distributed among countries. Geopolitical analysis helps people understand the complexities of international relations and the motivations and behaviors of countries in their quest for dominance and influence on the world.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) raises economic sovereignty concerns linked to national governments\u2019 authority over their currencies. It also affects the dynamics of financial power, possibly transferring influence from established financial hubs to up-and-coming ones that support cryptocurrencies.\n\nDue to the decentralized nature of Bitcoin, regulatory challenges arise that call for diverse approaches worldwide. Bitcoin is linked to geopolitical threats and potential tensions since it can be used for economic warfare or illegal operations while also giving countries a technological edge. Understanding Bitcoin\u2019s geopolitics is essential to understanding how it affects international relations, economic systems and global power dynamics.\n\nThe rise of Bitcoin: Disrupting traditional financial systems\n\nThe emergence of a peer-to-peer (P2P), decentralized digital currency like Bitcoin has upended established financial structures. Bitcoin runs on the blockchain, a decentralized network that is not governed by banks or governments the way centralized financial systems are. As a result, there is no longer a need for middlemen in financial transactions, enabling global, direct P2P transactions. By giving people access to the global economy, BTC has the ability to empower the unbanked and underbanked masses.\n\nTo avoid fraud and guarantee integrity, Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger that is both transparent and secure. Additionally, Bitcoin offers people more control over their funds by challenging the function of conventional financial intermediaries. Bitcoin offers a different store of value that appeals to those looking for stability thanks to its limited supply and resilience to inflation.\n\nThe emergence of cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based applications has been fueled by the ascent of Bitcoin, which has also sparked innovation in financial technology. That said, the disruptive nature of Bitcoin has changed how people think about and interact with money, providing a decentralized and effective alternative to established financial systems.\n\nGeopolitical implications of Bitcoin adoption: Shifting power dynamics\n\nBitcoin\u2019s global reach has significant geopolitical implications, as it challenges traditional notions of economic control and national borders, as explained below.\n\nEconomic sovereignty and control\n\nFrom a geopolitical standpoint, Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized structure calls into question national governments\u2019 control over monetary systems and economic sovereignty. A country\u2019s capacity to manage and decide on its own economic systems, resources and policies without undue influence or intervention from outside forces is referred to as economic sovereignty.\n\nGovernments may see Bitcoin as a possible challenge to their ability to manage and regulate the economy because they are used to doing so. They must figure out how to adjust to this new paradigm and create regulatory frameworks that strike a balance between innovation and control.\n\nEconomic power redistribution\n\nThe worldwide expansion of Bitcoin also affects the dynamics of financial power. As Bitcoin gains popularity, the long-dominant traditional financial centers might have to compete. For instance, the emergence of cryptocurrency exchanges led to the rise of new financial centers that support cryptocurrencies, which pose a threat to the supremacy of established financial centers like London and New York.\n\nThat said, it is possible that new financial power centers will appear, changing the balance of world economic dominance. Geopolitical relationships may reshape as a result of this dynamic, since governments that adopt cryptocurrency may enjoy a tactical edge in some economic sectors and pose a threat to the traditional financial centers\u2019 supremacy.\n\nRegulatory inequality and geopolitical tensions\n\nThe regulation of Bitcoin also presents a challenging geopolitical issue. Regulatory inequalities can cause tension between countries because different governments pursue various strategies, such as regulation, acceptance or outright bans. In order to resolve potential problems resulting from contrasting views on the use of Bitcoin and its effects on global financial stability, cooperation and harmonization of rules become crucial.\n\nGeopolitical opportunities and risks\n\nBitcoin\u2019s global nature also brings with it geopolitical opportunities and risks. On the one hand, it can be seen as a tool for economic warfare, enabling people and organizations to evade sanctions or take part in illegal operations. Governments can be worried about money laundering, funding for terrorism and possible effects on their national security.\n\nHowever, there is potential for countries to use Bitcoin\u2019s technology and incorporate it into their economic plans, as accepting Bitcoin can boost a country\u2019s competitiveness in the digital economy, encourage investment and promote innovation. Moreover, governments may need to address these concerns and create legal frameworks.\n\nFor instance, the Silk Road case, where Bitcoin was used for nefarious activities, brought attention to the risks of unrestrained cryptocurrencies. However, some countries, like El Salvador, perceive an opportunity to expand their economies and encourage financial inclusion by accepting Bitcoin as legal tender.\n\nFinancial inclusion and empowerment\n\nAdoption of Bitcoin can empower people in underdeveloped areas by giving them access to a global financial network. For instance, Bitcoin has been utilized by residents of Venezuela, a country with hyperinflation and stringent financial controls, as a way to protect their wealth and gain access to global markets.\n\nBy promoting financial inclusion and reducing reliance on conventional banking systems, these actions may change the balance of power in favor of people and communities.\n\nTechnological competition and innovation\n\nCountries fight to use Bitcoin\u2019s core technology \u2014 blockchain \u2014 for purposes other than cryptocurrency. The dynamics of geopolitical power and economic advantages in the digital age may be affected by this fight for technical leadership.\n\nEnergy dependence and resource competition\n\nWhile there are advantages to mining Bitcoin, there are also geopolitical risks involved. Bitcoin mining uses significant processing power, which in turn uses a lot of energy. This has caused mining operations to concentrate in areas with affordable electricity, which frequently leads to a significant dependence on specific energy sources or providers, which has occasionally resulted in competition over resources and geopolitical issues.\n\nFor instance, areas with an abundance of fossil fuel resources can attract mining activities, which could exacerbate environmental worries about carbon emissions and climate change. Due to the dependence on energy and the struggle for resources, there may be geopolitical issues, such as possible conflicts over the distribution, control and access to energy.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin miners as energy buyers, explained\n\nEconomic warfare and sanctions evasion\n\nBitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature raises concerns about its potential use in evading economic sanctions or conducting economic warfare, influencing geopolitical strategies and impacting relationships between countries.\n\nInfluence on international aid and remittances\n\nThe use of Bitcoin may have an impact on the flow of remittances and international aid. Bitcoin has the potential to upend established remittance systems and alter the dynamics of global financial flows by offering a more effective and affordable means of cross-border transactions.\n\nBitcoin and economic sovereignty: Challenges for nation-states\n\nBitcoin poses problems for states regarding economic sovereignty due to the following factors:\n\nDecentralization: Because Bitcoin runs on a decentralized network, no government or central organization has full control over Bitcoin transactions and the broader Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nLack of power over monetary policy: To manage their economies, nation-states frequently have the power to conduct monetary policies, such as changing interest rates or creating money. Bitcoin, however, operates on a fixed supply schedule and is not subject to government intervention, making it impossible to dictate monetary policy. The use of monetary policy as a tool for managing the economy by nation-states is constrained due to this lack of control.\n\nPossibility for capital flight: Bitcoin enables people to send money internationally without the aid of middlemen or conventional financial systems. This may raise worries about capital flight, where people or companies transfer their money outside of the borders of a country, potentially affecting that area\u2019s economic stability and ability to regulate capital flows.\n\nRegulatory challenges: Nation-states must contend with regulatory obstacles when dealing with Bitcoin. Governments struggle to properly enforce laws and monitor transactions due to Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized and international character. A complicated regulatory environment has resulted from the disparate responses taken by many countries, from embracing Bitcoin to enacting limits or outright bans.\n\nMoney laundering and illicit activities: Because of its anonymity and simplicity in transmitting money, Bitcoin has drawn attention for its potential use in money laundering, terrorism financing and other illegal acts. Governments face the difficult task of combating illegal financial activity without obstructing Bitcoin\u2019s lawful uses.\n\nImpact on domestic monetary systems: The acceptance and use of Bitcoin can have an impact on a nation-state\u2019s domestic financial systems. There may be a decrease in reliance on traditional financial institutions and fiat currencies as more people and businesses use BTC. This change might make domestic monetary policy less successful and make it harder for the government to maintain control over the country\u2019s monetary system.\n\nHow cybersecurity intersects with geopolitical risks\n\nIn today\u2019s interconnected digital environment, cybersecurity is essential for tackling geopolitical issues. State-sponsored cyber attacks are one way that geopolitical tensions between countries might escalate. To gain a tactical edge or disrupt their rivals, governments may target one another's vital infrastructure, such as their financial systems, electricity grids or communication networks.\n\nSuch cyberattacks may have important geopolitical ramifications, including conflict escalation, strained diplomatic ties and severe economic fallout. To identify, stop and mitigate these attacks and safeguard a country's most important assets, robust cybersecurity measures must be implemented.\n\nMoreover, cybersecurity is essential for preventing unwanted access to and manipulation of sensitive government data, intellectual property and vital infrastructure. To protect their resources and uphold their sovereignty in the face of potential cyber threats, countries should make significant investments in cybersecurity.\n\nCyberattacks against vital infrastructure \u2014 such as power grids, transportation networks and healthcare networks \u2014 can potentially result in geopolitical risks. Essential infrastructure can be disrupted or disabled, which can have far-reaching effects on the economy, the public\u2019s safety and general anarchy. To protect key infrastructure from cyber threats and to uphold the stability and resilience of their countries, governments must prioritize cybersecurity measures.\n\nCBDCs vs. Bitcoin: A clash of monetary ideologies in the geopolitical arena\n\nThe rise of Bitcoin and the emergence of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have sparked a battle of monetary ideas in the geopolitical sphere. While Bitcoin functions as a decentralized digital currency free from any central authority, CBDCs are a digital version of fiat currency that is issued and regulated by central banks.\n\nSeveral factors \u2014 including monetary policy, financial sovereignty, privacy and the dynamics of global power \u2014 are involved in this conflict between CBDCs and Bitcoin, as explained below.\n\nControl and regulation\n\nCBDCs provide central banks with a greater degree of monitoring and control over monetary policy and the financial sector. Governments can use them as a tool to keep an eye on and control transactions, thus enabling policies like negative interest rates and focused economic stimulation.\n\nThe traditional centralized control over monetary systems is challenged by Bitcoin, which runs on a decentralized network. Users have more financial autonomy thanks to its peer-to-peer architecture and cryptographic features, which can worry governments about regulation and financial stability.\n\nFinancial sovereignty\n\nCBDCs are backed by a central bank in an effort to increase national financial sovereignty. Countries can improve their internal economic resilience, lessen their reliance on foreign currencies and improve their standing in the international financial system.\n\nBitcoin challenges the idea of sovereignty related to national currencies by providing an alternative to existing fiat currencies. Due to its worldwide reach and borderless transactions, it may undermine current financial systems and have an impact on how countries balance their geopolitical power.\n\nPrivacy and surveillance\n\nCBDCs raise privacy and surveillance issues since they make it easier for governments to detect and monitor transactions. While supporters claim that this can help stop illegal activity, detractors point out the possibility of abuse and invasion of personal privacy rights.\n\nSince Bitcoin is pseudonymous and gives some level of privacy, it appeals to people who want to be financially independent. However, the public ledger that underpins Bitcoin transactions is publicly accessible for analysis, and privacy issues persist.\n\nGlobal power shifts\n\nThe conflict between CBDCs and Bitcoin has the power to alter the balance of power on the planet. As large economies\u2019 currencies become more accessible and digital, they may become more dominant as a result of CBDCs. This might put smaller economies and their currencies under pressure.\n\nOn the contrary, Bitcoin offers people and countries the opportunity to engage in the global economy without relying on conventional financial intermediaries because it is a decentralized form of money. By empowering areas or people with little access to financial services, it may weaken the influence of existing financial hubs.\n\nThe future of Bitcoin\n\nGlobal power players will face both opportunities and challenges from Bitcoin in the future as the decentralized digital currency continues to disrupt the world\u2019s financial system. Due to its unique features and disruptive qualities, Bitcoin has the ability to upend established power structures and bring about a paradigm shift in how people view and use money.\n\nWhile it promotes financial inclusion, acts as an inflation hedge and allows for frictionless cross-border transactions, it also threatens established power structures, raises regulatory concerns, endangers financial stability and has an impact on the overall global financial system. The role of Bitcoin in the international financial system and its effects on the geopolitical environment will be shaped by how major international parties respond to these opportunities and risks.\n\nSome countries might take a proactive stance by creating regulatory frameworks that strike a balance between consumer protection and innovation. To improve their financial systems, some countries are already experimenting with CBDCs or working with blockchain technology.\n\nOthers might adopt a more circumspect approach, choosing strict rules and possible prohibitions to reduce the alleged risks related to Bitcoin. They might prioritize preserving control over monetary policies and bolstering established financial structures.\n\nHowever, the rising popularity of Bitcoin has the potential to upend the current financial system and challenge traditional currencies and institutions. This might result in a redistribution of economic influence and power, which would have an impact on international trade dynamics and country-to-country geopolitical ties.\n\nWritten by Onkar Singh"

        "title": "Bitcoin Mining Load Flexibility Can 'Significantly Mitigate Power Shortages' in Texas - Blockworks",
        "content": "Can bitcoin mining mitigate power shortages?\n\nA paper published in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers thinks it\u2019s a possibility. The document, which was first published back in April, looks at the use of energy by bitcoin miners in Texas.\n\n\u201cWe show that the flexibility of mining loads can significantly mitigate power shortages and market disruptions that can result from the deployment of mining loads,\u201d the paper said. This could allow policymakers to \u201cfacilitate the participation of large mining facilities in wholesale markets and require them to provide mandatory demand response.\u201d\n\nAccording to a survey from Payless Power, 58% of the 727 Texans surveyed expressed concern about the Texas power grid handling mining.\n\nTexas is home to a number of bitcoin mining companies \u2014 including Marathon and Riot Platforms. In the past, both Governor Greg Abbott and Senator Ted Cruz have expressed their desires to make Texas more bitcoin and crypto friendly.\n\nThe Texas power grid, however, has shown an inability to keep up with surging demand during winter storms and heat waves.\n\nThrough demand response programs, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT, gives financial incentives to miners so that they cut power when the grid is facing \u201chigh system demand.\u201d When the miners shut down, the power gets redirected to the grid.\n\n\u201cConsidering the fast integration of new mining facilities, offering proper financial incentives could potentially encourage the new facilities being built in locations with lower carbon footprint and high societal benefit,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nPayless Power found that 48% of those surveyed are concerned about the strain that crypto mining places on the power grid.\n\nAccording to researchers, the model shows \u201cthat while the reliability of electric systems with higher renewable penetration is more susceptible to the integration of mining loads, full flexibility at all times can significantly avoid the reliability concerns created by the mining loads.\u201d\n\nLegislators in Texas introduced Senate Bill 1751, which could remove tax breaks while also requiring miners using more than 10 megawatts to register as flexible load operators with ERCOT \u2013 the state\u2019s largest energy operator.\n\nAs Blockworks previously reported, ancillary services would be the demand response impacted by the bill \u2014 which is when miners sell the right to ERCOT to balance the grid by curtailing the miner load.\n\nBoth mining companies and blockchain advocates have pushed back against the bill, with the head of development at Texas Blockchain Council saying that bitcoin mining \u201cis uniquely capable of addressing the needs of the grid, unlike any other industry.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Blockworks, Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, said that the council will continue to advocate for mining in the state. While Bratcher does not believe that Senate Bill 1751 will pass, he and the council will continue to push back against the bill.\n\nAccording to the paper, different locations present distinct advantages and disadvantages. It says that financial incentives could \u201cpotentially encourage the new facilities being built in locations with lower carbon footprint and high societal benefit.\u201d\n\nWhen looking to build in Texas, some crypto miners have settled in rural towns, causing economic booms in generally overlooked areas \u2014 an argument used by proponents of mining to advocate for friendly legislation.\n\n\u201cBoth location and flexibility are critical factors that policymakers and grid operators should consider when designing ancillary service programs that take advantage of the unique characteristics of the mining loads and enhance their grid-supporting capabilities,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nA number of states are currently weighing legislation both for and against crypto mining. States including Montana, Arkansas, Missouri and Mississippi have either introduced or passed legislation in favor of miners. New York, on the other hand, paused all proof-of-work crypto mining operations last November.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Ron DeSantis, the current governor of Florida, has officially thrown his hat in the 2024 United States presidential ring and has notably promised to \u201cprotect\u201d Bitcoin (BTC) if he gets the job.\n\nOn May 24, Twitter boss Elon Musk joined DeSantis and around 520,000 live listeners in the Twitter broadcast of his announcement, which was moderated by venture capitalist David Sacks.\n\n\u201cAs president, we\u2019ll protect the ability to do things like Bitcoin,\u201d said DeSantis. He added \u201cthere\u2019s risks involved with it,\u201d but the people interested in the cryptocurrency \u201care sophisticated\u201d and \u201ccan make decisions.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have every right to do Bitcoin. The only reason these people in Washington don\u2019t like it, is because they don\u2019t control it.\u201d\n\nDeSantis called those on Capitol Hill \u201ccentral planners\u201d who \u201cwant to have control over society.\u201d\n\n\"Bitcoin represents a threat to them, so they\u2019re trying to regulate it out of existence,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Florida governor also hinted at the jurisdictional battle being waged by the Securities and Exchange Commission over cryptocurrencies.\n\nGary Gensler, the current chair of the securities regulator, has long claimed his agency has authority over the crypto space.\n\nRelated: President Biden announces nominations for key positions at Federal Reserve\n\nDeSantis said as Congress had \u201cnever addressed\u201d cryptocurrencies, \u201cthe bureaucracy\u201d \u2014 likely referencing the SEC \u2014 had \u201cto just do it on their own\u201d and made it so \u201cthat people can not operate in that space.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t have an itch to have to control everything that people may be doing in this space, and I think that the current regime \u2014 clearly they have it out for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHe added if President Joe Biden is re-elected for another four years in 2024, the regulatory regime for crypto under his administration will \u201cprobably end up killing it.\u201d\n\nEarlier in May, DeSantis passed an anti-central bank digital currency (CBDC) bill in Florida that prohibits the use of a federal CBDC as money, along with banning the use of foreign CBDCs.\n\nThere\u2019s still a way to go before the United States heads to the polls in November 2024.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is at 10-week lows, but one longtime analyst is telling investors to ignore the \u201cpanic.\u201d\n\nIn a Twitter update on May 25, Philip Swift, creator of data resource LookIntoBitcoin and co-founder of trading suite DecenTrader, eyed a BTC price breakout still in progress.\n\nSwift: \"Bitcoin performing well and as expected\"\n\nBitcoin has not traded this low since mid-March, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows \u2014 and despite residing in a range just $4,000 wide since, cold feet are everywhere.\n\n\u201cA lot of panic in the market today,\u201d Swift summarized.\n\nBTC/USD is currently testing the mettle of key moving averages, as Cointelegraph reported, against a backdrop of traders\u2019 downside targets extending to $25,000 and below.\n\nEven Swift believes that Bitcoin could still return to as low as $20,000 in the coming months, despite remaining bullish on higher timeframes.\n\nBTC/USD 1-day candle chart on Bitstamp.

        "content": "A bearish technical formation has driven down the total crypto market capitalization over the past seven weeks. Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) 2% decline \u2014 and a 1.7% and 2.5% decline from BNB (BNB) and XRP (XRP), respectively \u2014 were the main drivers of the most recent 1.3% correction between May 18 and May 25.\n\nTotal crypto market cap in dollars, 12-hour. Source: TradingView\n\nThe descending wedge formation initiated in April indicates a possible breakout near $1 trillion by late July. For bulls, the bearish structure that drove the total capitalization to $1.11 trillion on May 25 means that an eventual break to the upside would require extra effort.\n\nBitcoin and Ether falter due to weak macroeconomic data\n\nSticky inflation continues to worry investors, who price in higher odds of further interest rate increases by the United States Federal Reserve. The country\u2019s latest personal consumption expenditure indicator displayed a 5% increase, which is noticeably higher than the 2% inflation target.\n\nMoreover, data from Germany\u2019s statistics office on May 25 showed a downward revision to the country\u2019s gross domestic product from 0% to -0.3% for the first quarter of 2023 versus the previous quarter, marking the second consecutive decline. Furthermore, there\u2019s the impending U.S. debt ceiling standoff and the fact that the U.S. Treasury is quickly running out of cash.\n\nThere are also a series of regulatory risks at the forefront due to various governments aiming to tighten their grip on crypto assets. The latest event involved an oversight body within the European Central Bank called the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), which recommended special attention to bank run risks on stablecoins. The ESRB mentioned the lack of transparency regarding stablecoins, providing the example of Tether (USDT).\n\nDerivatives hint that bears are unwilling to short\n\nPerpetual contracts, also known as inverse swaps, have an embedded rate that is usually charged every eight hours.\n\nA positive funding rate indicates that longs (buyers) demand more leverage. Still, the opposite situation occurs when shorts (sellers) require additional leverage, causing the funding rate to turn negative.\n\nPerpetual futures accumulated 7-day funding rate on May 25. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe seven-day funding rate for BTC and Ether (ETH) was neutral, indicating balanced demand from leveraged longs (buyers) and shorts (sellers) using perpetual futures contracts.\n\nTo exclude externalities that might have solely impacted futures markets, traders can gauge the market\u2019s sentiment by measuring whether more activity is going through call (buy) options or put (sell) options.\n\nA 0.70 put-to-call ratio indicates that put option open interest lags the more bullish calls and is, therefore, bullish. In contrast, a 1.40 indicator favors put options, which can be deemed bearish.\n\nBTC options volume put-to-call ratio. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe put-to-call ratio for Bitcoin options volume has been below 1.0 for the past couple of weeks, indicating a higher preference for neutral-to-bullish call options. More importantly, even as Bitcoin briefly corrected down to $25,900 on May 25, there was no significant surge in demand for the protective put options.\n\nRelated: Ripe for the squeeze? Bitcoin mining stocks remain under attack from short sellers\n\nMultiple factors will continue to pressure Bitcoin\u2019s price\n\nGiven the balanced demand on futures markets, traders seem hesitant to place additional bets until there\u2019s more clarity on the U.S. debt standoff. It is unclear whether the crypto market will be able to break out of the descending wedge formation.\n\nEven if professional traders are not using derivatives to bet on a catastrophic scenario for Bitcoin\u2019s price, there is presently a lack of triggers for a bull run given the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. So, ultimately, bears are in control as the descending wedge makes its way to another 10% correction until July.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin fell 1.40% from May 19 to May 26 to trade at US$26,451 at 7:00 p.m. Friday in Hong Kong. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been trading under US$30,000 since April 19. Ether rose 0.34% over the week to US$1,813 recapturing US$1,800 on Thursday.\n\nThe lack of progress in U.S. debt ceiling negotiations continued to erode risk appetite as the June 1 deadline neared. On Wednesday, Fitch Ratings placed the U.S.\u2019 AAA rating on a negative rating watch, saying that debt ceiling negotiations raised the risks of the government missing payments on some of its obligations.\n\n\u201cBitcoin and Ether have shrugged off the U.S. debt ceiling negotiations and the potential ripple effects for crypto. President Biden has already declared the country will not default on its debt,\u201d Lucas Kiely, the chief investment officer of digital asset platform Yield App, said. \u201cWith liquidity tight, the crypto market doesn\u2019t seem to be too concerned over these macro events. It will take something much more substantial to move these markets.\u201d\n\nJohnny Louey, a crypto research analyst at trading platform LiquidityTech Protocol, disagreed, saying that the debt ceiling negotiations are the main factors weighing down Bitcoin price.\n\n\u201cAlthough the debt ceiling has been raised and revised 78 times since 1960, investors are aware of the default risk if negotiations fail. This is the first time Bitcoin encountered such an economic incident and it\u2019s reasonable to assume a risk-off approach would be appropriate,\u201d said Louey.\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.11 trillion on Friday at 7:00 p.m. in Hong Kong, down 0.89% from US$1.12 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. With a market cap of US$512 billion, Bitcoin represented 46.1% of the market, while Ether, valued at US$218 billion, accounted for 19.6%.\n\n\u201cThe entire market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has essentially remained unchanged for a year,\u201d said Kiely. \u201cTether\u2019s plan to expand its Bitcoin holdings may temporarily boost prices but is overall not likely to have a large impact. Bitcoin\u2019s 2024 halving could lead to a price boost, however, we\u2019ve yet to start seeing the effects thereof.\u201d\n\nOn May 17, Tether, the company behind the world\u2019s largest stablecoin USDT, revealed its plans to \u201cregularly allocate\u201d as much as 15% of its net operational profits to buy Bitcoin, aiming to boost its reserves portfolio. Tether held approximately US$1.5 billion in Bitcoin reserves, at the time of the announcement.\n\nDormant Bitcoin hits all-time high\n\nThe amount of Bitcoin that has been inactive for at least a year rose to an all-time high of 68.46% on Wednesday, according to data aggregator MacroMicro.\n\n\u201cIt could mean short-term selling pressure decreases if the Bitcoin holdings in short-term holdings shift to longer-term holders. However, we will not be able to tell whether the addresses belong to institutional investors or not,\u201d Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co, the parent company of 21Shares, an issuer of crypto exchange-traded products, said.\n\nAccording to Yield App\u2019s Kiely, this suggests that increasingly more investors worldwide intend to hold their Bitcoin for the long term.\n\n\u201cThis trend is likely to continue and even quicken \u2014 even potentially to the point of hyperbitcoinization \u2014 given the uncertainty related to an evolving regulatory landscape and growing recognition of Bitcoin as a store of value,\u201d said Kiely.\n\n\u201cHyperbitcoinization\u201d is a concept speculating on Bitcoin\u2019s eventual rise to become the world\u2019s ubiquitous form of money.\n\nNotable movers: RNDR & KAVA\n\nThe Render Network\u2019s native cryptocurrency was this week\u2019s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap, rallying 16.55% to US$2.83. The token started picking up momentum last Saturday, after the announcement of the new Render Foundation website. This is Render\u2019s second consecutive week as the biggest gainer in the top 100 cryptos.\n\nThe Render Network leverages idle graphics processing units for digital rendering purposes, catering to areas such as 3D modeling, gaming imagery, and virtual reality.\n\nKava, the governance token of a layer-1 blockchain of the same name, was this week\u2019s second-biggest gainer, rising 10.70% to US$1.09. The coin started picking up momentum on Monday, following the launch of the Kava mainnet last week.\n\nNext Week: Could a debt ceiling deal break Bitcoin\u2019s crab walk?\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy are reportedly closing in on a deal that would raise the government\u2019s debt ceiling for two years while capping spending on most items. Yet, the June 1 deadline is fast approaching, causing investor concerns about a potential default.\n\nAccording to WuuTrade\u2019s Kenjaev, the uncertainty around the debt ceiling negotiations will keep weighing down the crypto market until a deal is reached.\n\n\u201cThe sideways [movement] of Bitcoin is very much related to the current market risks and the fear. Investors\u2019 activity during any economic risk talks is rather cautious. Hence the sideways in US$26,000 \u2013 US$30,000,\u201d wrote Kenjaev, adding that positive news surrounding the U.S. economy will break the crab walk.\n\nInvestors are awaiting next week\u2019s release of the U.S. jobs report for May, which includes the crucial nonfarm payrolls data. This information often serves as a barometer for predicting the Federal Reserve\u2019s next steps regarding interest rate adjustments. ING Economics has projected an increase of 195,000 in nonfarm payrolls for May. Additionally, they anticipate a slight uptick in the unemployment rate to 3.5% for May, compared to 3.4% in the preceding month.\n\nIn the crypto space, Optimism, an Ethereum layer-2 network, is planning to increase the circulating supply of its governance token (OP) next Wednesday, a year into the coin\u2019s launch. The expansion is part of Optimism\u2019s strategy to augment the pool of votable tokens within the Token House, its group of OP holders responsible for proposing and voting on governance issues.\n\nSee related article: Big buys fail to lift NFT markets as regulatory uncertainty weighs heavy on crypto"

        "title": "Why have Bitcoin and crypto lost 60% of their market cap since their all-time highs? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Macro Markets, hosted by crypto analyst Marcel Pechman, airs every Friday on the Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel and explains complex concepts in layperson\u2019s terms, focusing on the cause and effect of traditional financial events on day-to-day crypto activity.\n\nThe latest Macro Markets show begins by exploring why the crypto market capitalization is some 60% below its all-time high, while the S&P 500 is less than 15% away from its peak. For Pechman, the sector is suffering from a huge problem, as it doesn\u2019t fit a commodity nor does it fit a foreign exchange currency. Moreover, not every mutual fund can hold crypto.\n\nThe lesson? If Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) are mostly understood as alternative risk assets, that\u2019s how they\u2019ll trade. Consequently, one should not waste time looking for theories explaining why crypto has been unable to break new highs.\n\nOn to the next topic, according to Pechman, NVidia\u2019s $2.3-billion short seller losses don\u2019t provide the real picture. That\u2019s because a short seller can endure pain if they don\u2019t close the borrowing \u2014 so, as long as they have enough collateral deposits, those losses are still open.\n\nThat\u2019s similar to what a buyer who paid a much higher price for their crypto is experiencing. Until this person makes the sale, the losses are not concrete. The difference is that the short seller needs to find someone willing to lend those shares to keep the trade open.\n\nA Bloomberg article mentioned that Nvidia is the fourth-most shorted stock in the United States, behind Apple, Tesla and Microsoft. According to Pechman, the four most shorted stocks also happen to be top 10 S&P 500 components, which leads to an issue: Those short sellers may have been market neutral the whole time, buying index futures and selling individual stocks.\n\nLastly, the show debates China\u2019s 5% growth, disappointing investors, and its consequences for the markets. For Pechman, the most important news is China\u2019s reluctance to issue new stimulus packages, which could be a strategy to further weaken the remaining global economies.\n\nThe Bloomberg article shows how China is a key player in global commodities. If commodity prices and the global trade balance continue to weaken, that means less tax revenue for those other governments. Pechman highlights that Germany has just entered a technical recession, and the U.S. is right behind.\n\nPechman believes the outcome for crypto is initially negative, as it drains liquidity from markets, and investors will further reach for short-term government bonds and cash. But if the U.S. dollar loses strength, that\u2019s positive for crypto in the medium term.\n\nIf you are looking for exclusive and valuable content provided by leading crypto analysts and experts, make sure to subscribe to the Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel.

        "title": "Ripe for the squeeze? Bitcoin mining stocks remain under attack from short sellers - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Driven by heightened demand for Bitcoin (BTC) block space, fueled by Ordinals inscriptions and the PEPE-fueled BRC-20 memecoin mania, miners have become direct beneficiaries of a sudden boom in transaction fees, increasing their bottom lines.\n\nThis surge has resulted in an unprecedented increase in the average number of transactions, and consequently revenue per BTC block mined.\n\nData from a recent Glassnode report sheds light on the revenue increase for miners in May, as they raked in a total of 12.9 BTC in mining rewards per block, with fee revenue surpassing subsidies for only the fifth time in Bitcoin\u2019s history.\n\nBitcoin average fee paid per block. Source: Glassnode\n\nCoin Metrics data underscores this phenomenon further, revealing that on May 8, miners generated a staggering $41.16 million in daily revenue, a level unseen since late April 2022, when Bitcoin was trading in the $40,000 zone.\n\nAnd though their daily revenue has tapered off since that peak, adding up the cumulative totals from the past 30 days shows that Bitcoin miners have earned a cumulative total of nearly $1 billion worth of BTC, which is not bad for a bear market!\n\nDaily Revenue of Bitcoin Miners. Source: Coin Metrics\n\nHowever, despite this revenue revival, Bitcoin\u2019s two largest publicly traded miners by market cap, Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), have dipped significantly over the past month.\n\nAs of May 23, RIOT and MARA were 16.16% and 21.33% below their respective April highs.\n\nRIOT and MARA price charts. Source: TradingView\n\nThis price action has raised concerns among investors, which is reflected in the large amount of short positions currently opened on both stocks.\n\nLet\u2019s dive into the specifics of market sentiment captured by short interest, and the potential for a technical breakout in Bitcoin mining stocks.\n\nLegacy markets remains skeptical of BTC miners\n\nWhen comparing the year-to-date returns of RIOT and MARA to BTC, it is evident that both have benefited from what\u2019s known as a leveraged beta effect. Leveraged beta, in this instance, suggests that when Bitcoin\u2019s value appreciates, these stocks outperform. Conversely, when Bitcoin slumps, they face deeper downside risk.\n\nYear-to-date returns of RIOT, MARA and BTC. Source: TradingView\n\nThe intriguing aspect here is that despite the impressive returns of RIOT and MARA year-to-date, and their increased revenues over the past month, the short interest percentages on each remain alarmingly high.\n\nThis is proven by dividing the total number of shares sold short by the total float (amount of shares available for public trading).\n\nFor example, if a company had 10 million shares available for public trading (the float), and there were 1 million shares sold short, the short interest % float would be 10%.\n\nSpecifics vary but generally speaking, amounts below 5% are considered low and amounts over 10% are considered high, and thus vulnerable to short squeezes.\n\nAs per Nasdaq data, MARA currently has 25.68% of its float shorted:\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings short interest data. Source: Fintel\n\nWhile RIOT has at 13.48%:\n\nRiot Platforms short interest data. Source: Fintel\n\nThis indicates that Wall Street and the broader legacy financial sector remain unimpressed by the strength Bitcoin and its miners have shown in the first half of 2023 and are expecting some reversion back to the lows in the near future.\n\nGranted there are plenty of valid narratives for this bearish thesis:\n\nRIOT is already up 234% and MARA 174% year-to-date; how much higher from here is realistic?\n\nLooming regulatory hostility such as a White House proposal for a 30% Bitcoin mining tax and the SEC\u2019s probe into MARA.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding the U.S. debt ceiling debate and its implications for equity markets.\n\nAnd, the list goes on.\n\nBut while skepticism prevails among speculators, technical analysis offers a contrarian perspective on the potential for further upside from here in miner stocks. Let\u2019s analyze the technical signal that suggests this selling might be overdone and whether it is a good time for offside shorts to consider heading for cover.\n\nShort squeeze stars are aligning\n\nWhat\u2019s most remarkable about the stellar starts both RIOT and MARA have had in 2023, is that despite being up multiples from January, neither appears to be overstretched from a technical standpoint. A sign of just how beaten down their stock prices were in 2022.\n\nThis is underscored by the fact that though they're up 242% (RIOT) and 183% (MARA) year-to-date both are still 80%+ removed from their 2021 all-time highs, and are only just now re-crossing their 200-day moving averages (red line on the chart).\n\nAs shown below, April was the first time MARA traded above all of its moving averages since late December 2021, when it was trading in the high $30 range. More encouraging is the fact that throughout May, it has been back-testing and, so far, holding this breakout.\n\nMARA price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nAs the arrow above shows, the last time previous to this that MARA broke above its 200-day moving average after being held below it was July 2020, when its stock price was trading around $1.30.\n\nFollowing that 200-day breakout, it held the trendline throughout the next eighteen months and rode it to an all-time high of over $76 by November 2021.\n\nThat\u2019s not a bad return on investment.\n\nSimilar behavior is also being shown by RIOT, which last broke above its 200-day MA (red line) when it was around $2 in May 2020 before making highs above $71 just eight months later, in February 2021.\n\nRIOT price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nA bullish pre-cursor indeed.\n\nIf Bitcoin is able to regain the momentum it lost in May, regain the $30,000 mark, and begin a leg higher in June, analysts should be on the lookout for BTC mining stocks to continue their out-performance due to the leveraged beta effect and excessive short interest that may be forced to cover which would push prices higher.\n\nAlternatively, if Bitcoin continues its downward trend into the summer then these stocks will almost certainly fall further than the price of BTC on a percentage basis.\n\nIn any event, it will be an interesting niche of the market to keep an eye on as things develop into the monthly close.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Discover SCENE\n\nThe United States is barreling toward a date that could have historic consequences for global markets, running the risk of its first-ever debt default. It's a potential black swan event that could have an outsized impact on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the rest of the crypto market.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned weeks ago that the government would soon run out of funds if the debt ceiling isn\u2019t suspended or raised\u2014possibly as early as June 1. If lawmakers remain deadlocked and can\u2019t come to an agreement on spending, Washington won\u2019t be able to pay its bills, she said.\n\nSimilar standoffs over the debt ceiling have rattled markets in the past, like a prolonged disagreement over the debt ceiling that sent the S&P 500 tumbling 16% in 2011, startling investors before a resolution was reached.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis time around, Wall Street has yawned. The S&P 500 is down less than 1% since Yellen issued her sobering remarks on May 1. However, Bitcoin has fallen more than 7% and Ethereum is down nearly 3% during the same period, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAmerica's \u201cX-date\u201d\n\nTypically, debt ceiling debacles create more noise than market-moving news, Amberdata\u2019s Director of Derivatives Greg Magadini told Decrypt\u2014but he acknowledged that a U.S. debt default is far from off the table.\n\n\u201cIt feels like a pretty intense game of chicken right now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd given how crazy things have gone in the past couple of years, I think anything is possible.\u201d\n\nIn the event that the government defaults on its debts, risk assets like stocks and crypto would face short-term pain, Magadini said. He explained that\u2019s because a drop in the quality of government-backed debt would likely raise borrowing costs, counterintuitively increasing its yield and strengthening the dollar compared to other assets.\n\nSimilarly, the dollar could strengthen during a U.S. default as American traders tend to onshore their dollars\u2014swapping foreign currencies and assets for the greenback\u2014during risk-off events, CoinShares\u2019 Head of Research James Butterfill told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTechnically speaking, the dollar should sell off in the event of a default, but it won't because people tend to onshore their dollars in periods of market stress,\u201d he said. \u201cThe dollar might actually strengthen, perversely, because people are getting worried, and that actually won\u2019t be so great for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nButterfill envisions the dollar will strengthen and Bitcoin will slide as the U.S. approaches what the White House has described as America's \u201cX-date,\u201d the official date at which the government can no longer pay its bills.\n\n\u201cThis is a really complicated scenario,\u201d Butterfill said, noting he doesn\u2019t think a default is likely. \u201cIt\u2019s not that obvious what exactly will happen.\u201d\n\nBitcoin May Bounce\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum could react differently in the event of a default, Amberdata\u2019s Magadini said. Bitcoin may bounce alongside gold after an initial slide\u2014as a check on government-issued currency\u2014while Ethereum would likely remain depressed alongside tech stocks, he said.\n\nThe sentiment was echoed by Genesis\u2019 Co-Head of Trading Gordon Grant, who told Decrypt that Bitcoin has more upside than Ethereum if the government can no longer meet its debt obligations, but both coins would face pressure initially.\n\n\u201cMaybe there's an initial wick down, as risk assets get absolutely trounced, because the stock market is going to get decimated,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Bitcoin is probably going higher.\u201d\n\nFor Ethereum, Grant said that the second largest crypto by market cap is often tied to indexes tracking tech stocks like the NASDAQ, making it likely to underperform compared to Bitcoin if a default takes place.\n\n\u201cIt doesn't matter whether I think that that's a fair comparison,\u201d he said, noting that that\u2019s how certain models trade the relationship between things like the NASDAQ and Ethereum. \u201cSo, we would tend to expect underperformance of Ethereum.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSVB and Sausage\n\nAs an example of how crypto has performed during recent risk-off events, Grant pointed to Bitcoin\u2019s outsized gains compared to Ethereum in the wake of several bank collapses in March, including Silicon Valley Bank. However, he noted that there\u2019s zero data to suggest how cryptocurrencies could react if the government defaults for the first time in history.\n\nBoth Grant and Magadini highlighted increased activity in the options market for Bitcoin as a potential default draws closer, saying it suggests that traders\u2014mostly institutional ones\u2014are betting the coin will see increased volatility.\n\nAt the end of the day, Grant said he\u2019s confident that lawmakers will exhaust their differences on Capitol Hill and reach an agreement like they always have. But, pointing to the logic of Bloomberg\u2019s Tom Keene, Grant said the bigger question is whether events like these become more common in an ever-more-polarized political climate, and if they\u2019ll ever go away.\n\n\u201cWe can ruminate and pontificate, but the real story is this phenomenon of the US government, as a debtor nation, bumping up against a debt ceiling,\u201d Grant said, adding it\u2019s become \u201chow the sausage gets made in the 21st century.\u201d"

        "content": "On the evening of May 24, Salvatore Leggiero, developer of the forthcoming Bitcoin Tower, officially launched the project at an exclusive architecture-focused event by designer Simone Micheli. The private event was held at the Bella Restaurant Lounge in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.\n\nDuring the event, Leggiero and Micheli presented their collaboration for the Bitcoin Tower, which will have a version in the metaverse and a physical building.\n\nSalvatore Leggiero unveiled the initial design draft for the Bitcoin Tower. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nIn an interview, Leggiero told Cointelegraph that the project combined two of his passions. The executive has years of experience in real estate development and acquired a passion for Web3 during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cI spoke with many crypto experts, but with all due respect, they don\u2019t understand so much regarding real estate. And, I spoke with many, many important developers also in the city but with all due respect, they don\u2019t understand crypto,\u201d he explained.\n\nSalvatore Leggiero presented the target land plot for the construction. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nThe developer said that because of this experience, he imagined a project that would match his expertise in real estate and his passion for crypto \u2014 and the idea for the Bitcoin Tower in Dubai was born.\n\nLeggiero also told Cointelegraph that he wants the project to be an open project, mentioning the possibility of creating a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for the project. He explained:\n\n\u201cWe will receive many, many inputs from the community because Bitcoin Tower must be an open project, like what Satoshi Nakamoto teaches to us.\u201d\n\nHe added that having a DAO seemed very natural for the project because decentralizing decision-making contributes to making an \u201ceclectic experience for the future.\u201c\n\nDesigner Simone Micheli presented his design for the metaverse version of the Bitcoin Tower. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nThe tower will have a virtual version, which will be launched in the metaverse, and a physical version, which will be built in Dubai. While the location is not yet final, Leggiero hopes to get the approval to build the tower near Sheikh Zayed Road, where the famous Dubai skyline resides.\n\nRelated: UAE infrastructure for crypto is more \u2018business-friendly\u2019 than the US, says exec\n\nLeggiero also told Cointelegraph that having a symbol like the Bitcoin Tower would benefit the region. The developer believes the project could solidify the UAE leadership\u2019s position on cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn addition, the developer highlighted it could provide a hub for the crypto community; for those who live in Dubai and those who are visiting for the many crypto events in the region.\n\n\u201cI have something that I think gives the idea of this evolution of real estate and revolution of the market of hospitality. Bitcoin Tower will be the first of a chain. This is what I dream,\u201d he added.\n\nMagazine: Crypto City: Guide to Dubai"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe controversial BRC-20 standard and Ordinals protocol that made it possible keeps growing its footprint in the Bitcoin ecosystem. The latest: Stably USD, which is being billed as the first BRC-20 stablecoin.\n\nAfter all, two of the largest stablecoins\u2014Tether (USDT) and USDCoin (USDC)\u2014originated on the Ethereum network as ERC-20 tokens. Although now both tokens are available on a handful of other networks like Solana, Avalanche, and TRON.\n\nLike ERC-20 tokens, BRC-20s are a lot like NFTs. They allow for arbitrary, non-financial information to be added to the Bitcoin blockchain without the need for a sidechain or additional token. BRC-20 tokens have been at the center of an intense debate within the Bitcoin community, with important figures taking favorable and unfavorable positions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNow U.S.-based Stably, which calls itself a fiat onramp for crypto trading, has announced its BRC-20 U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin on Twitter. But there are a few red flags.\n\nFor starters, the total supply: $69.420 trillion, according to the company\u2019s website. That\u2019s more than double the U.S. national debt and likely a nod to meme culture. And things seem to be off to a slow start. Their documentation links to a reserve wallet with a $220 balance at the time of writing.\n\nWhile Stably claims its subsidiary, Stably Trading LLC, is a registered money transmitter, the registration number and address on their website don\u2019t match what\u2019s listed on the FinCEN website under \u201cStably Trading, LLC.\u201d\n\nThe company tweeted that \u201c#USD is backed and redeemable 1-to-1 for USD collateral managed by our regulated custodian\u201d adding that a third party firm will be conducting monthly attestations to ensure the collateral always matches what\u2019s been issued.\n\nStablyUSD isn\u2019t technically a new stablecoin. It\u2019s been around since 2019 and only recently got converted into a BRC-20 token on Bitcoin. The latest attestation report shows it\u2019s got a market capitalization of $7 million across 11 different blockchains, including Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Arbitrum.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nScreenshot of Stably USD April attestation report. Source: Stably\n\nThe USDS listing on CoinGecko shows that its price hit an all-time high of $9.89 on November 30, then crashed days later to $0.05 on December 9, 2022. The token has about $5,000 worth of liquidity on decentralized exchange UniSwap split between two trading pairs.\n\nAccording to Stably\u2019s website, its regulated custodian\u2013Prime Trust\u2013holds the reserves for Stably USD. But it seems more likely that Prime Trust doesn\u2019t hold the reserves directly, as it explains on its website that it isn\u2019t FDIC-insured and uses accounts at a handful of banks that are.\n\nThat said, Stably said it will enforce a know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering process (AML) for users who want to redeem stablecoins for actual dollars.\n\nNeither Stably nor Prime Trust immediately responded to a request for comment from Decrypt.\n\nAlthough Stably has been quick to claim they were the first USD stablecoin on the Bitcoin network, USDT was initially launched on OMNI, a Bitcoin sidechain, in 2014. There are also several U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins, such as DoC on Rootstock, currently available on the network.\n\nThe new stablecoin, however, appears to be the first of its kind using the BRC-20 standard.\n\nWhether this is another BRC-20 fad to quickly fade away, or a new era of stablecoins ushered in by the contentious Ordinals protocol remains to be seen. As always, do your own research.\n\nEditor's Note: This article was updated to note that USDT and USDC originated on the Ethereum network, but don't both do the majority of their volume on the network.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Bitcoin Core version 25.0 has been released, bringing new features, bug fixes and performance improvements to the software. Users can download the latest version from the official Bitcoin Core website or update their existing installations. The release notes outline the changes and provide instructions on how to upgrade.\n\nOne notable change is the allowance of transactions of non-witness size 65 bytes and above, which opens up new use cases and enhances protections against vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-12842. Another addition is the scanblocks RPC, which allows for fast wallet rescans by returning relevant blockhashes from a set of descriptors.\n\nIn terms of RPC updates, all JSON-RPC methods now accept a new named parameter called \"args\" for passing positional parameter values conveniently. Additionally, the verifychain RPC will now return false if checks couldn't be completed at the desired depth and level, providing more accurate feedback.\n\nThe release also includes changes to the build system, updated settings and new features. For instance, the shutdownnotify option allows users to specify a command to execute before Bitcoin Core begins its shutdown sequence. In the wallet section, new options like minconf and maxconf have been added to various RPCs, providing greater control over UTXO confirmations.\n\nBitcoin Core 25.0 introduces several improvements and optimizations, enhancing the user experience and security of the software. As with any release, users are encouraged to report any bugs they encounter to the official GitHub issue tracker.\n\nBitcoin Core is widely supported and tested on major operating systems such as Linux, macOS, and Windows. However, it is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems. Users should ensure they are running a compatible operating system before upgrading to the latest version. In addition, users are encouraged to review the release notes for a detailed understanding of the improvements in this version if upgrading.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Home loans using crypto as collateral: Do the risks outweigh the reward? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "\u201cI\u2019m never gonna bother with that bullshit again,\u201d says Bitcoin OG Michael Tozoni about getting a crypto home loan to invest in property.\n\n\n\nAfter becoming wealthy-ish with Bitcoin investments, Tozoni sensibly decided to diversify. Not wanting to sell off his crypto, he had grand plans to borrow to buy investment properties and use the rental income to pay off the loan.\n\n\n\nThe only trouble was that banks aren\u2019t the slightest bit interested in wealthy Bitcoiners, preferring poor wage slaves instead.\n\nMichael Tozoni took out a Bitcoin-backed loan hoping to diversify into property. (Supplied)\n\n\u201cIf you are broke and you have no money, but you have a job and a constant income, banks will be very happy to give you money,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you have a lot of money and a lot of investments, but no income, banks do not want to give you money.\u201d\n\nWhile Tozoni eventually found some traditional lenders willing to provide him cash, he crunched the numbers and realized that the interest on a Bitcoin-backed loan was cheaper, at least in his particular circumstances. Looking back, this was probably a mistake.\n\nTozoni is the poster boy for the typical Bitcoin-backed loan customer, according to Adam Reeds, CEO of Toronto-based crypto lending firm Ledn.\n\n\u201cBitcoin-wealthy clients that have been turned down from services at legacy financial institutions\u201d is how Reeds describes the cohort.\n\nThe idea of putting Bitcoin up as collateral for properties intrigued Tozoni, as he\u2019d be able to purchase investment properties and keep his Bitcoin.\n\nThe only trouble is: It\u2019s risky as shit.\n\nHow crypto home loans work\n\nHere\u2019s the lowdown: Instead of selling your Bitcoin for cold hard cash to buy your dream home or investment property outright, you can stash it away as collateral with a lender.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty much an agreement with the lender that says if things go south, worst case, they keep your Bitcoin.\n\nIf and when you pay your loan off, you get your Bitcoin back.\n\n\n\nSo far, so good, but the loans come with a massive catch \u2014 if the value of your Bitcoin collateral goes down too far, it gets liquidated.\n\nThat means Bitcoin\u2019s wild and unpredictable price swings make this a high-risk, some-reward-style scenario compared to traditional mortgages.\n\nWhile mortgages backed by banks only require a 10%\u201320% cash down payment, most crypto collateral loans start at 100% of the loan value, and some require 200%.\n\nMeaning, at the minimum, you are going one-to-one with the loan, so if you have your sights set on a $600,000 loan, be prepared to lock up at least $600,000 of your precious Bitcoin.\n\nIf the price of Bitcoin decides to take a nosedive, while you\u2019re conveniently out of phone reception, you might miss the margin call urging you to top up your collateral. Or you might not have enough extra funds to cover it.\n\nIf that nosedive turns into a full-blown swan dive, then bam, your Bitcoin collateral disappears as quickly as a magic trick, otherwise known as liquidation.\n\nSo, how did it work out for Tozoni?\n\n\n\nHe says, \u201cIt started out kind of okay,\u201d as the first properties \u201cmade a grand here and there, but then it just went downhill\u201d as the COVID-19 pandemic kicked off.\n\nHe selected a 200% collateral ratio, meaning his lender held the power to instantly liquidate the collateral if its value dropped below \u201c115%\u2013120%.\u201d\n\n\n\nTozoni says it required constant monitoring of Bitcoin\u2019s price, from breakfast to dinner.\n\n\u201cIf it gets down to 170%, you get a margin call where you have to deposit more money. If it gets down to 115% or 120%, it\u2019s instant liquidation. So, they just dump it right away in order to be able to cover their amounts.\u201d\n\nRisks of crypto home loans\n\nReeds explains that this is the biggest concern that Ledn\u2019s new clients have before signing up for a Bitcoin-backed loan: What happens in the event that Bitcoin\u2019s price drops, and how much time will they have to come up with the additional collateral?\n\n\u201cIf the price of Bitcoin drops by more than 50% from the time they took the loan, the client must top up the Bitcoin collateral to maintain the loan in a healthy status,\u201d he says.\n\nWhile Ledn\u2019s Bitcoin mortgage product allows two weeks to post additional collateral, the \u201cstandard Bitcoin-backed loans are programmatic, and margin calls need to be met before reaching the liquidation threshold,\u201d Reeds explains.\n\nAdam Reeds, CEO of Ledn. (Laura Proctor)\n\nUnfortunately for memecoin hodlers, the only digital asset that Ledn accepts as collateral is Bitcoin, with the collateral ratio \u201cset at 100% of the value of the property being mortgaged.\u201d Its home loans are currently only available in Ontario, Canada, but it plans to expand to other provinces and some U.S. states later this year. Mortgages are also only for two years before being assessed and renewed.\n\nJarrad Parke, chief operating officer of Australian firm Black Tie Digital, says that collateralization is the No. 1 topic new customers want to try to understand. \u201cWhat surety they have that their digital assets will be returned to them,\u201d Parke says. The firm acts as a broker for those looking to get a crypto-backed loan.\n\nIn Tozoni\u2019s case, he opted for a \u201ctwo-to-one collateral\u201d strategy, aka 200% collateral, meaning he had to deposit twice the amount of Bitcoin he wanted in the equivalent value of traditional fiat cash.\n\nJarrad Parke from Black Tie Digital. (LinkedIn)\n\n\u201cIf I wanted to borrow $100,000 [in cash], I had to put down $200,000 in Bitcoin,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\nParke says that people who have Bitcoin should understand that \u201cif you\u2019re holding digital assets, you\u2019re holding assets \u2013 full stop.\u201d\n\nHe emphasizes that one of the biggest barriers to entry for most people is the ability to save the deposit. It is pointed out that \u201ccrypto has allowed an ever-increasing number of people\u201d to short-cut through this process.\n\nLike any investment lending decision, it all comes down to risk.\n\nParke says the collateralization rate \u201cis primarily driven by the size of the loan and the length of the term.\u201d\n\nAlthough its lending partners are the ones who decide what digital assets are able to be collateralized, Parke explains that \u201cgenerally, low market cap tokens, highly volatile tokens and the like aren\u2019t accepted.\u201d\n\n\u201cBTC and ETH represent almost 2/3 of the total market cap. We generally find most significant holders of digital assets are covered.\u201d\n\nAdvantages of a crypto home loan\n\nSome people have had good experiences with Bitcoin-backed home loans. Max (not his real name) tells Magazine he\u2019s happy with his crypto mortgage organized through Ledn for a \u201cvery unique property\u201d as an investment.\n\nMax took the Ledn option as legacy banks are \u201creally bad at taking digital assets as collateral.\u201d The crypto mortgage means he\u2019s been able to hang onto his Bitcoin in expectation of future price gains. He also avoided a nasty capital gains tax bill that would have resulted from selling off Bitcoin to buy a property outright with the profits.\n\n\u201cI want to take advantage of fiat debasement. I don\u2019t want to realize capital gains, and I believe Bitcoin will continue to average 50% YOY.\u201d\n\nMax warns anyone considering this loan option to conduct their own due diligence and \u201ccalculate risk correctly,\u201d as price drops can lead to a dreaded margin call. He says he is yet to experience one.\n\nMax sees a bright future for crypto-backed loans, believing that Bitcoin hodlers will especially find value in the product.\n\n\u201cBitcoiners are very capitalized and will start to want to take advantage of it without selling,\u201d he says.\n\n30-year crypto mortgages with Milo\n\nThere\u2019s no official history of crypto-backed mortgages to rely on, but it seems as if Nexo was the first platform to offer large crypto-backed loans back in April 2018, providing enough funds to buy a house.\n\nSince then, a small number of specific crypto collateral home loan providers have appeared, including fintech companies Milo and Figure in 2022 \u2014 though Figure seems to have been telling prospective customers to join the waitlist for over a year now.\n\nMilo\u2019s announced its world\u2019s first 30-year crypto mortgage product in January 2022.\n\n\u201cClients will be able to finance 100% of their purchase with no dollar down payments required and do this faster than a conventional mortgage,\u201d it said at the time.\n\n\n\nMortgages are available to purchase property worth up to $5 million at a 9.95% rate, collateralized with ETH, BTC and USDC. The product is only available for properties in the United States.\n\nWithin three months, Milo announced that it had closed a \u201crecord $10 million in crypto mortgages.\u201d\n\nMilo CEO Josip Rupena spruiks the crypto-backed 30-year mortgages on CNBC. (CNBC)\n\nIn comments to Cointelegraph in 2022, Milo said that its customer base was mainly Bitcoin and Ether hodlers who wanted to get a loan, while they kept on hodling.\n\nIt said the market turmoil had made potential clients more wary.\n\n\u201cWe have definitely seen that consumers are requiring more transparency from the companies that they engage with. This has given us an opportunity to see how we improve our solution even more in this period of time. We are still seeing demand from consumers that want our unique solution.\u201d\n\n\n\nJosip Rupena, CEO of Milo, updates Magazine via email for this story, saying the total value of crypto-backed loans written has now risen to \u201caround $17 million,\u201d and the firm has yet to liquidate a client\u2019s cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cWe have not issued any margin calls, and all of the clients that have worked with Milo have made $ on the appreciation of their Bitcoin or Ethereum.\u201d\n\nWhich raises an interesting point. While a crypto price plunge could see users wiped out, a crypto price rise could see the loan progressively more and more overcollateralized.\n\nWill the big banks offer crypto mortgages?\n\nCrypto winter has taken a lot of the heat out of the products this year. Investment bank Citi released a report in June 2022 saying that crypto mortgages were gaining prominence, despite it being \u201crare to find new types\u201d of mortgages in the post-GFC U.S. finance market.\n\nCrypto-backed mortgages have been around since 2018. (Pexels)\n\nThe report notes that crypto mortgages offer tax and liquidity benefits for both customers and borrowers.\n\n\u201cThe core idea of protecting from capital gains tax and a more liquid reserve account for credit exposure can potentially be mutually beneficial to both originators and borrowers if the financial assets in question were stable and liquid.\u201d\n\n\u201cAllowing crypto investors to utilize their investment gains to secure a loan without incurring the tax event and loss of further upside if they were to liquidate said cryptocurrency into cash,\u201d it says.\n\nHowever, due to the highly volatile nature of crypto, it notes that this loan might not be a viable option for everyone.\n\n\u201cThis issue may be compounded if the payment rises in the event of a downturn in cryptocurrency prices,\u201d it states.\n\nGuy Dickinson, former treasurer of HSBC Australia and now the CEO of blockchain carbon trading platform BetaCarbon, is skeptical of the idea that major financial institutions will adopt crypto collateral loans any time soon.\n\n\u201cThere will be a handful of pilots at best until there is an established multi-year risk model,\u201d he says.\n\nEven though Dickinson has transitioned into the Web3 world himself and left behind the traditional finance industry, he reckons TradFi institutions won\u2019t take on crypto-collateral loans until protection is available to cover itself.\n\n\u201cBased on my experience as the treasurer of HSBC and the recent experience of how loan providers are proceeding with extreme caution with traditional lending criteria, it is highly unlikely that crypto as collateral would be a scalable, commercially viable option until someone is willing to \u2018insure\u2019 the collateral.\u201d\n\nYou can buy your dream home with a crypto-backed loan\u2026 but it might turn into a nightmare. (Pexels)\n\nDickinson says the \u201ccrypto asset class is poorly understood\u201d and holds vast complexities for lenders to navigate.\n\nHe points out that the \u201crecent debacles with FTX\u201d encourages bankers to stay away from crypto and \u201cstay in their wheelhouse.\u201d\n\nHowever, he notes that the concept of using different securities or commodities as collateral is not new.\n\n\u201cIf we replaced the word crypto with shares or precious metals, we would be able to move forward under the well-established Lombard lending frameworks commonly used in private banking circles,\u201d he explains.\n\nWhy a crypto home loan went south for Tozoni\n\nMichael Tozoni\u2019s plans to diversify out of crypto into property went south. (Supplied)\n\nTozoni says that trying to keep afloat with a Bitcoin-backed loan was incredibly stressful.\n\n\u201cBitcoin continued to decline, and I would keep getting margin calls. So, it\u2019s just many stressful months of having to add more and more Bitcoin and not to lose my other Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nFew assets you could put up for collateral have the potential to plummet in price quite as quickly as Bitcoin, which Tozoni discovered during the COVID-19 pandemic price plunge when the world\u2019s markets started to panic about a potential depression.\n\nMarch 12, 2020 \u2013 aka \u201cCrypto Black Thursday\u201d \u2013 saw the price of Bitcoin drop from $8,000 to $3,600, in a matter of minutes.\n\n\u201cThere was a short flash crash [March 12, 2020] where Bitcoin crashed,\u201d he says, explaining that it was a \u201cvery short-term crash, where it dove down, and then two or three days later came back up.\u201d\n\nTry and avoid Bitcoin price action like this if you have a crypto-backed home loan.\n\nBut there was no grace period built into the loan, so everybody\u2019s collateral who went below the margin was liquidated, including Tozoni.\n\nTozoni is understandably grumpy with the lender, as he believes if they had exercised some patience and \u201cwaited three days\u201d until it came back up, he would still be the proud owner of his Bitcoin.\n\nAdding insult to injury, Parke warns that borrowers can run into more problems than just losing their crypto assets if a margin call is made. They can also face tax consequences if their Bitcoin was worth more than they bought it for.\n\nCrypto-backed loans are inherently risky due to volatility. (Pexels)\n\nHe says that while some \u201clenders offer non-recourse products,\u201d liquidation will likely still trigger a capital gains event while \u201ccosting the borrower any future gains.\u201d\n\nTalk about a rough day in the trenches, getting slapped with a big tax bill after losing your Bitcoin collateral.\n\nAfter Tozoni\u2019s Bitcoin disappeared quickly, he was \u201cstuck with just real estate.\u201d\n\nThis might not seem so bad since he at least had something, but it proved to be an extended nightmare for him when his tenants became tight-fisted during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cA lot of tenants did not pay during COVID-19,\u201d he says, explaining that he was trying to liquidate the properties because he was moving but found it impossible to sell a property where \u201cthere are tenants unwilling to pay.\u201d\n\nThe values of the properties were diminishing because of it, according to Tozoni.\n\nSome tenants \u201cjust disappeared and messed up the property,\u201d so he had additional costs to get things fixed while still hurting from all the lost Bitcoin.\n\nCrypto home loans: The higher the collateral, the better\n\nIn hindsight, Tozoni believes he probably should have opted for a higher collateral ratio, to protect himself against a sudden flash crash.\n\n\u201cThree to one, even a four to one [collateral ratio] if you want to be safe,\u201d Tozoni says, as he believes \u201cthe worst case scenario\u201d happened to him where his Bitcoin was liquidated at the lowest price before the price shot up again.\n\n\u201cSo, even if I were to sell my properties, it [Bitcoin] was already higher than that,\u201d he says.\n\nHowever, looking back at the whole ordeal, Tozoni has reached a level of peace with the whole situation but still regrets how it played out.\n\n\u201cI was thinking, \u2018Finally, this nightmare is over.\u2019 I ended up giving more and more and more and then most of it ended up gone. But then on the other hand, it\u2019s been like a year and a half of just stress, of constantly being drained.\u201d"

        "content": "MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--US Data Mining Group Inc. dba US Bitcoin Corp (\u201cUSBTC\u201d), which announced an all-stock merger of equals with Hut 8 Mining Corp. (NASDAQ: HUT) on February 7, 2023, today announced that it has been selected after multiple rounds of bidding in a competitive auction process to manage the restructured mining division of Celsius Network LLC (\u201cCelsius\u201d), which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 2022. USBTC submitted the winning bid as part of the Fahrenheit, LLC (\u201cFahrenheit\u201d) coalition.\n\nThe Fahrenheit coalition includes crypto industry pioneers USBTC, Arrington Capital, Proof Group Capital Management, Steven Kokinos, and Ravi Kaza. Upon restructuring, Fahrenheit will serve as the management company of the broader Celsius entity. Fahrenheit will receive a management fee of $20 million per year as part of a five-year agreement with Celsius.\n\n\u201cOur specialized expertise and track record of execution ultimately secured Fahrenheit\u2019s successful bid to restructure Celsius,\u201d said Michael Ho, CEO of USBTC. \u201cEach member of the coalition brings extensive experience operating, optimizing, and scaling high-potential assets across web3 markets.\u201d\n\nUnder the proposed restructuring, USBTC will enter into one or more operating and services agreements with the restructured company to become the exclusive operator of all mining assets formerly owned by Celsius. In addition to a portion of the management fee, USBTC will also receive from Fahrenheit a fee of $15 million per year net of operating expenses to manage the mining division of the restructured company. USBTC expects to increase its total installed hashrate under management by approximately 12.2 EH/s upon full energization of the Celsius fleet of 121,800 machines.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply committed to building value for the creditors of Celsius,\u201d said Asher Genoot, President of USBTC. \u201cJust as we did with Generate Capital and NextEra Energy in the Compute North bankruptcy, we will help another deserving partner emerge from bankruptcy stronger than ever. We\u2019re incredibly excited to get to work and show the world what we can achieve together.\u201d The consummation of Celsius\u2019 restructuring transaction is subject to approval of the Bankruptcy Court.\n\nAbout US Bitcoin Corp (USBTC)\n\nUSBTC is a leading industrial-scale operator of bitcoin mining sites, specializing in the design, construction, and management of sites with access to low-cost and sustainable sources of energy.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nElon Musk\u2019s heart-to-heart with Republican presidential nominee and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis culminated with a focus on digital assets\u2014touching on Bitcoin and the digital dollar, with a Dogecoin reference thrown in for good measure.\n\nThe conversation between Musk and DeSantis, which was moderated by entrepreneur David Sacks, didn\u2019t achieve liftoff until more than thirty minutes after its scheduled start time, with hundreds of thousands of Twitter users finding their apps crashing and the audio stream glitching. But the chat eventually got underway, and toward the talk\u2019s tail end, DeSantis leaned into his position as an advocate of crypto\u2019s largest coin.\n\nThe Florida governor portrayed his support of Bitcoin as a matter of civil liberties, and attempts to restrict crypto by his opponents as government overreach.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou have every right to do Bitcoin,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cThe only reason these people in Washington don\u2019t like it is because they don\u2019t control it.\u201d\n\nAs the 2024 election season gets underway, DeSantis\u2019 remarks mirror those of Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who heralded Bitcoin last week as an example of democracy and anathema to authoritarians.\n\nOn Wednesday, DeSantis touched on the uptick in regulatory enforcement actions that the digital assets industry has confronted so far this year, accusing the government of trying to purge digital assets to preserve the reign of those in power.\n\n\u201cBitcoin represents a threat to them,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to regulate it out of existence.\u201d\n\nDeSantis pledged that if Congress ever tried to institute a ban on \u201cthings like Bitcoin\u201d by passing new legislation, that he would vehemently oppose it. He also said that the current administration could snuff out Bitcoin if Biden is reelected.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe current regime, clearly, they have it out for Bitcoin,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cAnd if it continues for another four years, they\u2019ll probably end up killing it.\u201d\n\nAddressing the political conversation\u2019s shift toward a focus on crypto, David Sacks noted there\u2019s a big crypto audience on Twitter. Musk interjected to say there\u2019s one for \u201cDogecoin too.\u201d\n\nDeSantis has incorporated remarks against central bank digital currency into his platform over time, echoing statements made by representatives like Tom Emmer and pursuing a ban against government-backed cryptocurrencies in Florida.\n\nCentral bank digital currencies (CBDC) are similar to assets like stablecoins that are pegged to the price of a sovereign currency like the greenback. But instead of being issued by private companies on public networks, they are managed by their respective governments or central banks.\n\nIn the case of the Federal Reserve, Chairman Jerome Powell has said a CBDC would \u201cideally\u201d receive written approval from Congress. But DeSantis said there\u2019s no wiggle room in terms of that, and it won\u2019t happen on his watch.\n\n\u201cYou must get authorization from Congress,\u201d DeSantis said of a CBDC. \u201cI can tell you, if I\u2019m president, we are not doing a central bank digital currency.\u201d\n\nDeSantis underscored his message that a CBDC could be used to curtail purchases deemed politically unfavorable in the eyes of those who control the tech, possibly pushing environmental issues or preventing firearm sales.\n\n\u201cI see it as a massive transfer of power from individual consumers to a central authority, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s good for a free society,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a \u2018no\u2019 on [a] central bank digital currency.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD"

The Render Network is a decentralized platform that enables users to contribute their unused GPU power to render motion graphics and VFX.\n\nRNDR has been trending on Twitter this week thanks to its recent partnership with Apple and its integration with Solana.

Last week, Pudgy Penguins CEO Luca Netz celebrated the project's toy line launch on Amazon, saying \"I want Pudgy Penguins to be the face of NFTs.\"\n\nThe Sandbox game (SAND), a popular immersive Gamefi platform, commanded second place over the past 24 hours, gaining 5.4% and currently changing hands at $0.51.

When at 1.0, it corresponds to the STH realized price, which is the aggregate price at which STH coins last moved \u2014 their breakeven point.\n\nSTH-MVRV is currently at 1.022, making a 1.0 reading equate to a BTC spot price of around $26,500.\n\n\u201cIn bull markets, this level ($26.5k) should offer sound psychological support. We can trade below it, but a swift recovery would be necessary to justify upwards continuation,\u201d Checkmate commented.\n\nSTH market value to realized value (STH-MVRV) chart. Source: Checkmate/ Twitter\n\nShort-term holder spent output profit ratio (STH-SOPR)\n\nSTH-SOPR, as Glassnode describes it, is a \u201cprice sold versus price paid\u201d metric that gauges the profitability of spent outputs.\n\nCurrently below the 1.0 line, it suggests \u201closs dominance\u201d among STHs and demands that dip buyers step in next. SOPR does not differentiate between large and small transactions, focusing purely on the number of spent outputs.\n\n\u201cLosses by STH can ONLY be sourced from local top buyers, and counter-intuitively, we want to see top buyers selling the local bottom. This is what creates the FOMO bounce reaction,\u201d Checkmate explains.\n\nLikewise, the short-term holder realized profit/loss ratio \u2014 the version of SOPR which takes volume into account \u2014 is in danger of flipping bearish. For this to happen, however, it would need to spend a \u201csustained\u201d amount of time below 1.0.\n\nBitcoin STH-SOPR chart. Source: Checkmate/ Twitter\n\nShort-term holder realized profit/loss ratio momentum\n\nFinally, the trend back to \u201cneutral\u201d territory is also visible in the metric, which alerts observers to sudden changes in trend when it comes to STH profitability.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin holds $20K realized price as analyst eyes \u2018big moves coming\u2019\n\nMomentum is retreating from its \u201cgreen\u201d phase, which has been in place since January 2023, the start of Bitcoin\u2019s price recovery.\n\n\u201cSTH Profit/Loss momentum is a tool designed to spot rapid changes in market regime and trend. It is extremely responsive, and has returned to neutral gear,\u201d the post added.\n\n\u201cIf this thing starts to go red, that would be an early signal that a deeper correction is in play. It has consistently signalled the reversal of trends, often before the first break even happens.\u201d\n\nBitcoin short-term holder realized profit/loss ratio momentum chart.

        "title": "RGB protocol may offer solution to Bitcoin's Ordinals jam, proponent claims - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Gideon Nweze, the founder and CEO of the newly launched Digital Bitcoin Art and Assets (DIBA) nonfungible token (NFT) marketplace, believes there\u2019s an alternative way to bring NFTs to Bitcoin that doesn\u2019t impact block space and transaction fees.\n\nNweze recently put this belief to the test, launching a beta version of his NFT marketplace on May 19. Rather than using Ordinals, it leverages the RGB Smart Contract Protocol to mint NFTs on top of the Bitcoin (BTC) network.\n\nSince the introduction of Ordinals Protocol in January, Bitcoin-based NFTs and tokens have exploded in popularity, with more than 9 million total \u201cinscriptions,\u201d according to data from Dune Analytics. However, the rise of Ordinals has also invited its fair share of controversy, including its purported impact on block space and transaction fees.\n\nThe total number of Ordinals inscriptions since inception. Source: Dune Analytics.\n\nOn the other hand, the RGB Smart Contract Protocol comes from 2016, initially introduced as the \u201cBHB Network\u201d by Bitcoin developer Giacomo Zucco and then relaunched in 2019. It enables encrypted transactions with Lightning Network functionality, allowing users to mint NFTs without taking up huge amounts of space on the network.\n\nNweze told Cointelegraph that it is \u201cextremely complex\u201d but essentially works the same as a layer-2 scaling solution on Ethereum, and claims it could solve Bitcoin\u2019s newfound blockspace problems.\n\nAssets minted by way of the newly-introduced Ordinals Protocol have attracted widespread criticism for being inefficient and \u201cclunky.\u201d Nweze says this is because Ordinals inscribe assets directly \u201cinto\u201d the Bitcoin blockchain, whereas RGB layers the transactions on top of the network.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m building a house, I don\u2019t put all the storage inside the foundation. I build the rooms and the storage in layers on top of it. Ordinals are like trying to cram everything into the foundation, whereas smart contracts put everything in the floors above it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the RGB Protocol is only capable of minting NFTs, not BRC-20 tokens.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s another protocol called Trustless Computer, which leverages smart contracts to mint BRC-20 tokens. As reported by Cointelegraph Magazine, the project is not a layer 2, instead, it\u2019s a \u201cprotocol within a layer 1\u201d that uses smart contracts to reduce token bandwidth by 80% to 90%.\n\nBitcoin NFT marketplace DIBA\u2019s home page. Source: DIBA\n\nNweze\u2019s statements fall in line with those of Muneeb Ali, the CEO of Trust Machines, who explained in an interview with Cointelegraph how the Ordinals hype could support Bitcoin in attracting more developers and capital to layer-2 solutions.\n\nAli claimed that in the absence of scaling solutions, high fees and a congested network could slow down widespread Bitcoin adoption in the long term.\n\nRelated: 13 years after first Bitcoin purchase, layer-2 solutions struggle to gain traction\n\nWhile a number of major Bitcoin advocates, including Jan3 founder Samson Mow, have claimed that the Ordinals and BRC-20 hype will blow over in \u201ca matter of months.\u201d\n\nHowever, Nweze is convinced of the longevity of protocols and assets being created on the Bitcoin network, due in large part to developers beginning to leverage the full potential of the Taproot upgrade.\n\nFor DIBA's RGB21 UDAs, where contract data is kept off-chain, we think https://t.co/dGSwshhcw5 is a perfect fit for storing not only contracts but also high definition content-addressable media.\n\n\n\nWe expect to solve for data permanence in three ways:\n\n\n\n1) Storage debt markets,\u2026 \u2014 Hunter \u20bfea\u1e69t (@cryptoquick) May 22, 2023\n\n\u201cEverything we [DIBA] do, uses Taproot. Because Taproot was designed to reduce block space, everything we do takes up minimum block space, because the size of a Taproot transaction is far, far smaller than a normal Bitcoin transaction,\u201d he explained.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just pure development and code that has Nweze excited about NFTs on Bitcoin, it also comes down largely to culture and shared human experience. \u201cArt and music is what makes the human heart sing, so if we can use this to introduce more people to Bitcoin, and to Lightning, then we\u2019re winning,\u201d he said.\n\nMagazine: Ordinals turned Bitcoin into a worse version of Ethereum \u2014 Can we fix it?"

        "title": "Bitcoin miner Canaan's net loss slightly improved in Q1 amid market turbulence - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Chinese Bitcoin mining company Canaan reported slight improvements in some of its financial metrics in the first quarter of 2023. The progress, however, is still far behind where it was last year in this period.\n\nAccording to an unaudited report posted on its investor relations page, Canaan\u2019s net loss was $84.4 million in Q1, lower than its $91.6 million net loss in the previous quarter. The net loss represents a major reversal compared to the same period in 2022, when the firm reported a net income of $65.1 million.\n\nDiluted net loss per American depositary share (ADS) in the first quarter of 2023 was $0.51, down from $0.55 in the previous quarter, while diluted net earnings per ADS in the same period of 2022 stood at $0.38. According to Investopedia, an ADS is an equity share in a non-U.S. company held by a United States depositary bank and available for purchase by investors.\n\nThe company claims to be expanding operations despite the ongoing bear market and associated drop in earnings.\n\nThe quarterly results were impacted by several factors, including low market demand that hindered product revenue, the ongoing crisis in the banking system and the slow recovery of Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price. Revenue in Q1 totaled $55.1 million, against $58.3 million last quarter and $201.8 million in the same period of 2022.\n\n\u201cIn the first quarter of 2023, we experienced a further contraction in our sales revenue, due to the industry-wide reduction in selling prices, and unforeseen delays in payment and shipment following a series of U.S. bank failures. In addition, our mining business encountered difficulties that postponed the increase of our installed hash rates,\" said Canaan\u2019s chief financial officer James Cheng in the report, claiming the revenue results \u201cfell short\u201d of expectations.\n\nRelated: Ripe for the squeeze? Bitcoin mining stocks remain under attack from short sellers\n\nA revenue breakdown shows $44.1 million coming from products revenue and $11.1 million from mining activities, as well as $300,000 in other revenues. Income generated from mining activities rose 3.3% from $10.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and represents a 130.2% increase from $4.8 million during the same period of 2022.\n\nCosts linked to mining operations include electricity and hosting, as well as equipment depreciation and amortization.\n\nThe total operating expenses in the first quarter of 2023 were $38.1 million, compared to $60.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and nearly equal to the same period last year, when it stood at $38 million. \u201cWe managed to narrow our operating loss by 31.4% from the last quarter,\" noted Cheng.\n\nThe report shows a decrease in investment in research and development. Canaan spent $19.1 million in the first quarter, compared to $33.4 million in the previous period. The decline was due to one-off expenditures of $14.3 million for research and development for the A13 series products. In the same period of 2022, the company committed $15.1 million in R&D.\n\nCryptocurrency assets held by Canaan as of March 31, 2023 totaled 623 BTC, worth $13.4 million, according to the report. Cash and cash equivalents were at $72 million, compared to $101.6 million as of Dec. 31, 2022.\n\nMagazine: $3.4B of Bitcoin in a popcorn tin \u2014 The Silk Road hacker\u2019s story"

        "content": "Renton, United States --News Direct-- Chainwire\n\nStably, a leading Stablecoin-as-a-Service (SCaaS) and fiat on/off-ramp infrastructure provider for Web3 projects, is aiming to revolutionize the nascent Bitcoin ordinals market by launching its US Dollar (USD)-backed stablecoin, Stably USD, as a natively-issued BRC20 token under the symbol #USD. This groundbreaking development marks a critical milestone in the exponentially growing Bitcoin ordinals ecosystem that is now reaching half a billion dollars in total market capitalization in less than six months.\n\n#USD is a BRC20 standard stablecoin created via the Bitcoin ordinals protocol which was introduced in January 2023 after the recent Taproot upgrade. BRC20 tokens use a technique called ordinal inscriptions to attach data to individual satoshis, the smallest unit of a bitcoin. These satoshis can then represent anything from digital art ownership to \u201cmeme coins\u201d and even stablecoins.\n\nAccording to Stably, every #USD token is backed 1-to-1 with USD held by a US-regulated custodian in a collateral account for the benefit of KYC/AML-verified token holders. Monthly reports for the account are also conducted by a third-party stablecoin attestor to ensure #USD tokens are always fully collateralized with USD.\n\n\"When I met Domo, the creator of the BRC20 standard, at the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami, I told him about our upcoming plans for #USD,\" said Kory Hoang, Stably\u2019s CEO and Co-Founder. \u201cHe thought it was great and funny how we are creating a stablecoin on Bitcoin to enable Bitcoin trading on-chain\u2026 With a stablecoin built on Bitcoin. I\u2019m still chuckling about it to this day, actually. In just one week after that, however, we made it happen!\u201d\n\nThe integration of BRC20 #USD into the Bitcoin network is part of Stably\u2019s mission to power the next billion Web3 users with a seamless fiat-to-crypto and stablecoin onramp to all popular and emerging blockchain networks. The company\u2019s upcoming collaborations with prominent ordinals and BRC20 projects, including UniSat\u2013the world\u2019s largest decentralized wallet/marketplace for ordinals\u2013and Ordzaar\u2013Asia\u2019s first decentralized ordinals marketplace project, reflect Stably's aspiration to drive global innovation and adoption toward decentralized finance on the Bitcoin network, or \u201cBitFi.\u201d Additionally, Stably\u2019s engineers are now exploring the new ORC20 standard for Bitcoin ordinals, which could significantly enhance the token properties of #USD once implemented.\n\nStory continues\n\n#USD can be issued/redeemed with Fedwire, SWIFT, USDC, and USDT by KYC-verified users across 200+ countries/regions currently, including up to 44 US states. Stably states that it is employing a manual process of issuance/redemption for #USD\u2019s initial launch but plans to release support for automatic issuance/redemption through its Stably Ramp widget during Q3 2023. By then, users of #USD will be able to on/off-ramp via more traditional payment methods like ACH, instant ACH, and credit/debit cards, in addition to bank wires.\n\nFounded in 2018, the 20+ team member Seattle FinTech is backed by leading institutional and angel investors in the crypto space, such as Morgan Creek Capital, BEENEXT, 500 Startups, Hard Yaka, CREAM Labs, Sunny Lu of VeChain, and Paul Stahura of Donuts, Inc. The company has raised over $7.5-million in total funding to-date, $5-million of which was collected during its last Pre-Series A round in December 2021. Stably has also expanded its fiat on/off-ramp and stablecoin natively to more than 10 emerging networks, including Arbitrum, XRP Ledger, Stellar, Tezos, VeChainThor, Harmony, Polymesh, Coreum, ICON, and Chia Network.\n\nAbout Stably\n\nStably is a Web3 payment infrastructure provider and FinCEN-registered MSB from Seattle. The company specializes in providing stablecoins and fiat <> crypto on and off-ramps to users of Web3 applications. Stably\u2019s mission is to power this decade\u2019s next billion Web3 users with regulatory-compliant payment infrastructure across both developed and emerging blockchain ecosystems.\n\nVisit stably.io to learn more.\n\nRisk Disclaimer: Digital assets involve significant risks, including (but not limited to) market volatility, cybercrime, regulatory changes, and technological challenges.

The company stated that all accounts will be closed, and users are urged to withdraw their funds either as Bitcoin or fiat currency (GBP/EUR) from the Bottlepay app before the closure date.\n\nFailure to withdraw funds by the closure date will result in Bitcoin being converted to fiat currency and returned to the nominated bank account, while any fiat left in the account will be returned to the nominated bank account as well.\n\nIn a statement, Bottlepay advised users to utilize the app's downloads feature to save transaction statements before the closure date. The company emphasized that Bitcoin transactions can have tax implications, making the downloaded information valuable for future reference. As the closure date approaches, Bottlepay may contact users who still have Bitcoin or fiat currency in their accounts, either through the app or via email. However, the company cautioned users to be aware of potential scams and never initiate an offboarding process outside of the app.\n\nRegarding the next steps, users are advised to download their transaction history and close their Bottlepay accounts. Instructions on how to withdraw funds from Bitcoin and fiat accounts, as well as how to download transaction history and close accounts, can be found on the app.\n\nIn a closing note, Bottlepay expressed gratitude to its customers and apologized for the inconvenience caused by the closure. While the company refrained from making specific recommendations about what to do with Bitcoin funds, users were encouraged to exercise due diligence when selecting alternative custodial wallets or converting Bitcoin to fiat currency.

The stacked balance metric from Glassnode, which shows the individual balance on each exchange, confirms that a significant portion of the decline came from FTX.\n\nAn exodus followed shortly across other major exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, and Coinbase likely due to the contagion fears that spread across the market. This was also seen in the steep spike in sales for hardware wallet providers such as Ledger and Trezor.\n\nThe latest decline in Ethereum balances on exchanges in May also coincides with a rise in staking. The amount of staked ETH surged from 19.3 million before the Shapella upgrade to 21.2 million, rising vertically since the start of May, per Nansen data.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin\u2019s exchange balance did not decline alongside ETH during the same period, further suggesting that staking played a role in exchange withdrawals."

A post on Binance Feed explains the blending of the worlds of hospitality and cryptocurrency, the hotel will offer guests exclusive non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as rewards.\n\nImage by Cointelegraph\n\nThe rental price for a stay at the Bitcoin Tower is not just a payment but also an investment opportunity. Guests will effectively stake cryptocurrency, generating an annual percentage yield (APY) that the guests can claim.\n\nSalvatore Liggiero claimed the hotel will be the first of its kind and will give back the money. This concept aims not only to educate the general public about cryptocurrencies but also to encourage active participation in the digital economy.\n\nAlso read: Binance to celebrate 13 years of 'Bitcoin Pizza Day' with global events\n\nDecentralizing the Development of Bitcoin Tower\n\nThe developer invites artists, architects, creatives, and crypto enthusiasts to contribute their works to the project. These creations will form an exclusive NFT collection dedicated to the Bitcoin Tower's design and interior spaces.\n\nThe Bitcoin Tower aims to pay homage to the cryptocurrency and its mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Additionally, a Cointelegraph report claims that Liggiero intends to showcase Dubai's efforts to bridge the gap between digital and physical assets.\n\nLiggiero envisions the project as an open endeavor, considering the creation of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to govern the project. He believes that community input is essential and aligns with the principles espoused by Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThe Bitcoin Tower will have both a physical version to be built in Dubai and a virtual version to be launched in the metaverse. The location of the new building is yet to be finalized. However, the designer hopes to secure approval for constructing the tower near Sheikh Zayed Road, a part of the Dubai skyline.\n\nAlso read: Dubai-bound IndiGo flight suffers bird-hit on Mangaluru International Airport, over 160 passengers deplaned"

        "title": "JPMorgan Predicts Bitcoin (BTC) To Revisit $45,000, Here\u2019s Why - NewsBTC",
        "content": "In a recent note, JPMorgan strategists have made a prediction, suggesting that Bitcoin (BTC) could soar and revisit its former trading price of $45,000 due to the rising price of gold. This prediction comes amid Bitcoin\u2019s price action of a blend of bulls and bears in the past week.\n\nMeanwhile, over the past 24 hours, BTC has seen a 2.1% gain with a current trading price above $26,000. The current surge comes after Bitcoin previously fall that dropped its price below its previously ranging market price of $28,000.\n\nBitcoin And Gold: A Correlation\n\nBitcoin and gold have often been regarded as alternative investments by investors, and their prices have displayed a tendency to move in tandem.\n\nGiven this, JPMorgan analysts note that the current gold price, hovering near $2,000 per ounce, implies a Bitcoin price of $45,000. This assumption is based on the idea that BTC will reach a similar standing as gold in the portfolios of private investors.\n\nJP Morgan wrote in a note:\n\nWith the gold price rising above $2,000, the value of gold held for investment purposes outside central banks is currently valued at around [$3 trillion]. In turn, this implies a $45,000 price for bitcoin under the assumption that bitcoin equalizes gold in private investors\u2019 portfolios in risk capital or [volume]-adjusted terms.\n\nOne key factor contributing to JPMorgan\u2019s optimistic prediction is the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, scheduled to take place between April and May 2024. The halving mechanism reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins are produced, effectively doubling the production cost.\n\nThe JPMorgan strategists believe this event will push Bitcoin\u2019s production cost to approximately $40,000, acting as a lower bound and potentially driving the price upward.\n\nDrawing from historical data, JPMorgan highlights the bullish trajectory observed during previous halving events in 2016 and 2020. These events were accompanied by significant surges in Bitcoin prices, indicating the potential for a similar outcome following the next halving.\n\nAs a result, JPMorgan sets an upper limit of $45,000 for BTC, indicating limited potential beyond the increase driven by the doubling of production costs.\n\nReflecting On Ethereum (ETH)\n\nWhile Bitcoin takes the spotlight in JPMorgan\u2019s prediction, the bank suggests that Ethereum (ETH) may face some selling pressure in the near term, extending beyond the Shanghai upgrade until mid-year. JPMorgan expects Ethereum to \u201csomewhat underperform\u201d BTC during this period.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s essential to note that Ethereum\u2019s performance is subject to a range of factors, including market dynamics and technological developments.\n\nMeanwhile, regardless of JPMorgan\u2019s prediction, BTC is currently in a bullish trend recording an uptick. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has seen more than a 2% gain, while the past seven days have seen a dip of 1.2%.\n\nAt the time of writing, the top crypto currently trades at $26,823. Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume has, however, ranged around $20 billion in the past 7 days, indicating a possible accumulation. Bitcoin currently has a trading volume of $13.1 billion in the past 24 hours.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Traders are meticulously analyzing various indicators, carefully studying technical analysis (TA) patterns, and closely monitoring Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price action, all in search of potential signals for an impending surge.\n\nRenowned crypto trading expert Michael van de Poppe took to Twitter on May 26 to share his analysis, shedding light on the current market conditions and potential price movements that could ignite a surge in Bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\nVan de Poppe\u2019s tweet emphasized the significance of the $26,600 level, stating that if this crucial resistance is breached, it could mark a significant deviation from recent support levels. Such a breakthrough, he suggested, could potentially propel Bitcoin towards new range highs, igniting \u2018fireworks towards range highs.\u2019\n\nIn terms of specific price levels, van de Poppe pointed out that a sweep of $25,800 would provide a logical consolidation point, offering ample liquidity for a potential reversal. However, the real excitement lies in the acceleration that could occur \u2018if\u2019 Bitcoin reclaims the $26,600 level. This development, according to van de Poppe, could set the stage for a swift move toward $27,500.\n\nBitcoin price chart. Source: Michael van de Poppe\n\nThe experienced trading expert further added that once Bitcoin surpasses the $27,450 threshold, \u2018the sky is the limit.\u2019\n\nBitcoin chart analysis\n\nAs the crypto community collectively holds its breath, the anticipation builds. The outcome of Bitcoin\u2019s battle with resistance will undoubtedly have far-reaching implications for the market. Whether it will break free from its consolidation phase and soar to new heights or face further resistance remains to be seen.\n\nIt is important to note that Bitcoin\u2019s future remains unpredictable. However, the insightful observations provided by industry experts such as Michael van de Poppe offer valuable guidance to traders navigating the intricate cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin is trading at $26,438, reflecting a modest increase of 0.70% within the last 24 hours. However, over the course of the previous week, Bitcoin has seen a decline of 1.49%.\n\nBitcoin 1-day price chart.

        "title": "Take a look at Wolf\u2019s first cohort of Bitcoin-driven startups - TechCrunch",
        "content": "Historically, startups have built their products on blockchains outside of the Bitcoin network to avoid its slow transaction speeds, high fees and inability to communicate cross-chain.\n\nBut thanks to efforts like the Lightning Network and Taproot Assets (formerly Taro), which have improved the Bitcoin network\u2019s accessibility, speed and scalability, a number of enthusiasts are building on top of Bitcoin.\n\nFor reference, the Lightning Network is a layer-2 payment system that aims to enable faster transactions at a nominal cost for the blockchain. Separately, Taproot, which launched in April 2022, aims to help issue digital assets on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain that can then be transferred to Lightning Network instantly in low-fee transactions.\n\nIn Wolf\u2019s Clothing (Wolf), a startup accelerator launched by asset management firm Stone Ridge, is a similar effort that wants to bolster Bitcoin-focused applications and use cases. Over 100 teams from 36 different countries applied to be a part of the flagship, exclusively nonremote cohort, based in New York City.\n\nIts first cohort, Wolfpack 1, consisted of eight teams and 23 founders from 10 countries, and they presented their ideas on Wednesday during a demo day, exclusively covered by TechCrunch+.\n\nAll teams were provided seed capital by Wolf, the accelerator\u2019s CEO, Kelly Brewster, said. NYDIG, a subsidiary of Stone Ridge, is also supporting the program, alongside mentorship and investments from Bitcoin-centric VC firms and operating companies.\n\nMany of the startups presented real-world use cases that weren\u2019t about improving the bitcoin ecosystem but rather were products and services people can use everyday, only powered by faster payment rails. The majority of the startups integrated the Lightning Network into their tech.\n\nThe program featured 30 guest speakers from Stone Ridge and NYDIG, among others, including Lightning Labs co-founder and CEO Elizabeth Stark; Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer at the Human Rights Foundation; and Lyn Alden, who founded Lyn Alden Investment Strategy.\n\nCompany: 10101\n\nWhat it does: Decentralized trading on Bitcoin\n\nFounders: Philipp Hoenisch, Richard Holzeis, Lucas Soriano del Pino, Mariusz Klochowicz, Daniel Karzel\n\nThe pitch: 10101 (Ten Ten One) provides decentralized finance and bitcoin trading through its mobile application. The company is a self-custodial, on- and off-chain wallet that lets users trade perpetual futures without counterparty risks or third-party middlemen, like exchanges.\n\nThe application is fully open source and powered by the Bitcoin Dev Kit and the Lightning Dev Kit. The company plans to add synthetic stablecoins and other products like binary options, futures, structured products and prediction markets to its application in the long term, co-founder Philipp Hoenisch said during his pitch.\n\nIt is raising a $2.7 million seed round and plans to launch publicly in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nCompany: Arcade\n\nWhat it does: Global peer-to-peer marketplace built on Nostr\n\nFounders: Christopher David, Erik Aronesty\n\nThe pitch: Arcade is building a decentralized global marketplace for peer-to-peer commerce with an initial focus on expanding in the Nigerian market. It wants to build a global order book that allows people to buy any product or service globally. Peer-to-peer Bitcoin onramps have to be uncensorable, global, mobile and extensible, \u201cso that\u2019s what we\u2019re building,\u201d said co-founder and CEO Christopher David.\n\nThe marketplace hopes to claim the market share freed up by the recent closure of P2P marketplaces like LocalBitcoins. It builds on censorship-resistant open networks for payments like Bitcoin, Lightning and the data network Nostr. The application is live in beta mode with about 500 test users.\n\nArcade is currently raising $2 million in seed funding via YC SAFE.\n\nCompany: Agora\n\nWhat it does: Social debate platform\n\nFounders: James Pierog, Ruban Sundara Raj T\n\nThe Pitch: Agora is a gamified social debate platform where people can post ideas, argue their points in the comments and vote with satoshis, the smallest denomination of bitcoin, to determine which side wins. When the debate is over, the funds are split by those who voted for the winning side. The business takes about 5% of each prize pool. It has seen about 140,000 satoshis \u2014 or $36.98 \u2014 in payment volume across 1,085 transactions and 30 debates in the past two weeks, co-founder and CEO James Pierog said.\n\nThe platform plans to launch a mobile app by the end of 2023.\n\nCompany: Dustup\n\nWhat is does: Streamlined tournament tools\n\nFounders: Neil Woodfine, Richard Bensberg, Adam Woodfine\n\nThe Pitch: Dustup aims to improve the e-sports competition space through its streamlined tournament tools that integrate bitcoin payments, giving players the ability to pay entry fees and collect prize payouts quickly. The typical registration process for e-sports tournaments is extremely slow and requires a bunch of rerouting, said CEO and co-founder Neil Woodfine, but through the company\u2019s tool, players can register directly in a Discord in less than 30 seconds. The startup also provides automated results and custom scoring, as well as a bot that can help manage battle royale tournaments.\n\nIt\u2019s raising a pre-seed extension round of $350,000.\n\nCompany: ShockNet\n\nWhat it does: Lightning-focused web infrastructure\n\nFounders: Justin Hilton, Hatim Boufnichel\n\nThe Pitch: ShockNet provides infrastructure and tools to bridge web applications with the Lightning Network for quick payments. Its infrastructure connects Lightning micropayments to any app, so people can deliver content and have a means for monetization. The startup is also building its platform, Lightning.video, which uses its technology stack to give creators an opportunity to earn by publishing and monetizing their own content without having to post on platforms like YouTube.\n\nCompany: Route Finance\n\nWhat it does: Corporate treasury operating system\n\nFounders: Nate Castillo, Ramin Keene\n\nThe Pitch: Route is building an operating system for corporate treasuries that lets businesses automate cash management, analysis, forecasting, reconciliation and integrate payments directly into treasury workflows by pulling data from over 170 different integrations. The service provides a programmable financial data platform \u2014 with AI, ML and Bitcoin support \u2014 that will tailor support for advanced treasury workflows.\n\nOver time, the startup wants to power payments through Lightning and Taproot technologies, and \u201cessentially replace Swift\u201d and \u201cbecome the Stripe for treasury,\u201d said Nate Castillo, the company\u2019s co-founder. It has four customers \u2014 Amboss, StackHawk, Denali and Teachable \u2014 in its pilot program. However, after this story published, Amboss\u2019s CFO, Asher Hopp, reached out to TechCrunch+ to clarify that Route pitched Amboss, but there is no formal agreement between them.\n\nLikewise, StackHawk SVP Holly Hamann told us that StackHawk is not one of Route\u2019s customers, either, and is not involved with its program.\n\nWhen reached for comment, Route co-founder Nate Castillo replied, \u201cNone of the companies listed are Route customers, and we are working through the process to formalize our pilot program.\u201d\n\nCompany: Zawda\n\nWhat it does: Preserving paychecks\n\nFounders: Oday Kamal, Javier Vargas\n\nThe Pitch: The Zawda platform helps employees in MENA, Lebanon, Turkey and Pakistan allocate portions of their paychecks to bitcoin and stablecoins directly through their employers to preserve the monetary value.\n\nCountries in the Middle East face high inflation and rising costs, and people in those regions are seeing their local currencies and purchasing power diminish dramatically, said company co-founder Oday Kamal. Its platform requires no tech integration and aims to work with people to improve their ability to maintain currency and offer them a way to receive a small portion of their paycheck in bitcoin to preserve their funds.\n\nIt is starting its pilot phase with the United Arab Emirates and plans to finalize licenses with regulators in the country by the third quarter of 2023; it anticipates exiting that phase by end of year. It also wants to expand paycheck offerings into stablecoins, via Taproot Assets. It later plans to launch in Lebanon, Turkey, Pakistan, as well as add services like remittances, staking and lending.\n\nCompany: Zeus\n\nWhat it does: Bitcoin wallet, node management\n\nFounder: Evan Kaloudis\n\nThe Pitch: Zeus is an open source, noncustodial Bitcoin wallet and node management client that aims to provide a better option for lightning interfaces and node costs. The entire process to set up its wallet takes less than 30 seconds, founder Evan Kaloudis showed during his presentation. The wallet currently has about 10,000 users, making up over 10% of all Lightning Network users. It is also building Olympus by Zeus, a lightning service provider, that aims to offer easier connectivity to the lightning network. The wallet is supported by Eclair, LND and Core Lightning and is integrated by companies like BTC Pay, MyNode and Nodl, among others. It\u2019s looking to raise $2 million to $3 million.\n\nThe TC+ takeaway\n\nAll in all, this demo day was unlike any other crypto demo day I\u2019ve covered. Yes, I said crypto, which Bitcoin maximalists would argue the blockchain is not a part of. However, most crypto-focused demo days have startups that are aiming to grow the crypto ecosystem.\n\nWolf\u2019s demo day was a refreshing change of pace given that a fair amount of the startups were looking to solve real-world problems that exist today. Instead of creating a project that only benefits the Bitcoin network, founders were launching innovations that integrated Bitcoin as a payment solution for something outside of the industry.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an explosion of creativity happening in Bitcoin today,\u201d Wolf\u2019s Kelly Brewster said. \u201cPeople in crypto are building for crypto, but these [Bitcoin-focused] projects aim to build something faster and cheaper for the general public.\u201d\n\nWith all this said, it\u2019s still important for Bitcoin developers and founders alike to grow the ecosystem. As other blockchains progress further with subsectors like NFTs and gaming, Bitcoin is lagging behind.\n\nBut in recent months, the Bitcoin ecosystem has seen some renewed interest, with new initiatives like the launch of Ordinals, a Bitcoin-based NFT-like project. To date, over 9 million Bitcoin Ordinals have been inscribed \u2014 jargon for created (or minted) \u2014 according to Dune Analytics data. That amount is up 7,280% from 122,500 in mid-February, signaling explosive growth and demand for Bitcoin-based NFTs.\n\nI\u2019m curious to see whether Bitcoin-focused demo days moving forward will continue to be a mix of real-world projects building with Bitcoin, or if we\u2019ll see an influx of new projects centered around growing the ecosystem, taking a page out of the Ethereum, Solana and Polygon playbooks.\n\nUpdate: This story was updated on May 25 to clarify that Amboss is not one of Route\u2019s current customers. This story was updated again to clarify that StackHawk is not one of Route\u2019s current customers. This story was updated again on May 26 to include Nate Castillo\u2019s comment."

        "content": "Bitcoin NFTs Surpass Solana but Ethereum Retains Top Spot\n\nBitcoin NFTs monthly trading volume exceeded Solana this month, despite Ethereum still holding the top spot with an NFT volume of $393 million (double Bitcoin\u2019s 30-day volume starting April 23). Nevertheless, Bitcoin now overrides notable blockchains like Solana, Polygon, ImmutableX and BNB Chain \u2014 a remarkable achievement for these recently launched collectibles.\n\nOver recent months, the NFT market observed a shift in media-based Bitcoin ordinals, otherwise known as Bitcoin NFTs. Following this success, the popular Bitcoin NFT marketplace, Magic Eden, is competing with UniSat\u2019s volume, the world\u2019s first open-source browser extension wallet for Bitcoin NFTs.\n\nThe implementation of #Bitcoin ordinals spurred NFT activity on $BTC. Over the past 30 days #Bitcoin has seen the second most NFT sales volume among all blockchains: h/t @cryptoslamio pic.twitter.com/q8qnHCcLfD \u2014 Osprey Funds (@OspreyFunds) May 23, 2023\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin\n\nOn the flip side, Bitcoin Frogs has been boosting Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume. For example, Bitcoin Frog #2276 sold for 0.2 BTC ($5388.72) on Magic Eden on May 19. Significant sales like this one have led to the \u201ccrypto amphibians\u201d overriding Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), which only recorded $40 million in trading volume from April 23 to May 23. Regardless, the Bitcoin NFT ecosystem continues to lag behind Ethereum.\n\nOne of the critical reasons Ethereum remains at the peak for monthly trading volume includes holding numerous notable NFT projects: BAYC, Azuki, CryptoPunks and Milady Maker. BAYC and Azuki are NFTs associated with popular metaverse projects, whereas CryptoPunks and Miladys are in high demand due to having limited availability and early market entry. In addition, the blockchain network also supports numerous DAOs and integration benefits, stimulating the decentralized finance ecosystem to be worth $27.5 billion.\n\nDespite Milady already having a name for itself in the NFT realm, this month, the NFT collectibles noticed a rapid surge due to Elon Musk tweeting one of the customized PFPs, assisting Ethereum to continue claiming the prime position.\n\nAs the exciting NFT space continues to shift, progressing developments represent the unpredictability and potential of this blockchain-driven creative space.\n\nWant more?

        "content": "Bitcoin is the world\u2019s first and most popular cryptocurrency. However, like all other cryptos, it has had its ups and downs. Over the years, several issues have hampered the user experience of Bitcoin holders, and an upgrade was the need of the hour.\n\nThus, on 14 November 2021, the Taproot upgrade was implemented on block 709,632 of the Bitcoin network.\n\nHere\u2019s more on the Taproot upgrade.\n\nWhat is Taproot?\n\nTaproot is the most significant Bitcoin upgrade after its 2017 SegWit upgrade. It aims to solve the problems of privacy, slow transaction speed, and security of the Bitcoin network.\n\nAs Bitcoin is a public blockchain, all its transactions are publicly visible. Anyone on this blockchain who knows your Bitcoin address can view your transaction history. While you can try to increase your anonymity on this network by using CoinJoins and coin mixing, it does not make Bitcoin a private currency. Taproot aims to make your transactions anonymous on this ecosystem, thereby increasing your privacy and security.\n\nAnother major issue with this cryptocurrency was its speed. Initially, Bitcoin had the speed to carry out seven transactions per second. But, as its popularity grew, so did its users, and its transaction speed slowed. Transaction fees also increased, with a surge in the value of the digital currency.\n\nWith high fees and low transaction speed degrading the user experience of Bitcoin users, the Segregated Witness (SegWit) upgrade was implemented in 2017. It aimed to fit more transactions in one block and speed up Bitcoin\u2019s transaction process. However, its high transaction fees still prevailed. Taproot aimed to solve these problems by implementing several measures in its upgrade.\n\n\n\nFeatures of Taproot\n\nThe Taproot upgrade implements three major Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) that aim to give its users the benefit of lower transaction fees, improved speeds, and higher security.\n\nIts features are:\n\nSchnorr Signatures (BIP340)\n\nSchnorr Signatures increase the speed and security of validating transactions on the Bitcoin network. Primarily known for its simplicity and efficiency in generating short signatures, its key benefit lies in taking multiple keys inside a complex Bitcoin transaction and producing a single unique signature. This means that a single Schnorr signature can aggregate signatures from multiple parties. This will help significantly reduce transaction time on the Bitcoin network.\n\nDue to a unique feature of the Taproot upgrade, it also enables your transactions to stay anonymous to a certain degree.\n\nIf you are using Taproot, you can transact using a Lightning Network channel, a sophisticated smart contract or a peer-to-peer transaction. A person monitoring your transactions will appear to them only as a peer-to-peer transaction.\n\nHowever, the wallet addresses of both the initial sender and the recipient will be visible.\n\nTapscript (BIP342)\n\nTapscript is a coding language upgrade to the Bitcoin script that helps the other BIPs of this upgrade to function. The opcode OP_CHECKSIGADD takes advantage of the aggregation feature of Schnorr Signatures and thus allows more space in the blocks. This coding language will bring more flexibility to this ecosystem. It can add new features like creating and supporting smart contracts on the Bitcoin network.\n\nTaproot (BIP341)\n\nUsing the Merkelized Alternative Script Tree (MAST), the BIP341 increases the amount of transaction data stored on a Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nPreviously, to conduct a transaction, you had to provide a signature. This helped prove that you are the actual owner of your crypto asset. Investors could also use features like timelock releases, multisignature (multisig), and many more.\n\nThese features made transactions complex and hence more difficult to track. However, these processes required multiple inputs and signatures to verify. Hence, a large amount of your transaction information is automatically revealed on the blockchain. This caused a security risk, and the huge amount of data on the blockchain triggered a lag. Hence, transaction speeds dropped as the volume of data increased.\n\nWith MAST, the amount of verification and scripts can be reduced as one MAST transaction would be able to represent multiple scripts. When a complex Bitcoin transaction goes to MAST, it only allows the implementation of the executed conditions on the blockchain. This process reduces the volume of data stored on the blockchain and, as a result, increases transaction speed and enhances users\u2019 privacy.\n\n\n\nHow will Taproot benefit Bitcoin?\n\nThe Taproot upgrade will have the following benefits for Bitcoin users:\n\nLower transaction fees\n\nIncreased transaction speed\n\nLower risk of transaction data exposure\n\nImplementation of Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR)\n\nPossibility of Bitcoin covering Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Decentralised Finance (DeFi) markets in the future due to its upgraded script\n\nThe Taproot upgrade can potentially change the course of Bitcoin in future. Whether or not you are an investor of Bitcoin, staying informed of these upgrades can help shape your future crypto investment strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "After a disastrous 2022, this year was supposed to be the year of recovery for the crypto market. The combined market cap of all tokens rose above $1 trillion for the first time in almost a year and the entire sector was pumping, entering a decisive bullish phase.\n\nHowever, some experts claim that the crypto market rally is over. One of the most renowned crypto analysts and investors, going by the name @CryptoCapo_ on Twitter, stated that he expects Bitcoin to drop to $12k. The recent price movement seems to confirm this theory, as BTC fell more than 10% in the last 10 days. Ethereum also suffered losses in this period, but less dire than Bitcoin\n\nWhether this is the beginning of a bearish run for Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies remains to be seen. It is worth noting that some tokens seem unaffected by this slump. New generation cryptos like AiDoge (AIDOGE), EccoTera (ECOTERRA), (YPRED), (LPX), DeeLance(DLANCE), and SpongeBob (SPONGE) are steadily pumping and seem like a sure bet for 2023.

In times like this one, stability is at a premium, which is why we can see XRP gaining in 2023.\n\nConclusion\n\nHopes of a full recovery of the crypto market have been somewhat dashed by yet another slump. Despite the grim Bitcoin prognosis, there are some tokens that seem immune to this.
