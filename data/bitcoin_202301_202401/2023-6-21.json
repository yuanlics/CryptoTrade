        "content": "Alyssa Blackburn, a data scientist at Rice University and Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, has spent several years performing digital detective work with her trusty lab assistant, Hail Mary, a shiny black computer with orange trim. She has been collecting and analyzing leaks from the Bitcoin blockchain, the immutable public ledger that has recorded all transactions since the cryptocurrency\u2019s launch in January 2009.\n\nBitcoin represents a techno-utopian dream. Satoshi Nakamoto, its pseudonymous inventor, proposed that the world run not on centralized financial institutions but on an egalitarian, math-based electronic money system distributed through a computer network. And the system would be \u201ctrustless\u201d \u2014 that is, it would not rely on a trusted party, such as a bank or government, to arbitrate transactions. Rather, as Satoshi Nakamoto wrote in a 2008 white paper, the system would be anchored in \u201ccryptographic proof instead of trust.\u201d Or, as T-shirts proclaim: \u201cIn Code We Trust.\u201d\n\nThe practicalities have proved complicated. Price turbulence is enough to induce the Bitcoin bends, and the system is environmentally destructive, since the computational network uses exorbitant amounts of electricity.\n\nMs. Blackburn said her project was agnostic to Bitcoin\u2019s pros and cons. Her goal was to pierce the scrim of anonymity, track the transaction flow from Day 1 and study how the world\u2019s largest cryptoeconomy emerged."

        "title": "Almost no one uses Bitcoin as currency, new data proves. It's actually more like gambling - The Conversation",
        "content": "Bitcoin boosters like to claim Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, are becoming mainstream. There\u2019s a good reason to want people to believe this.\n\nThe only way the average punter will profit from crypto is to sell it for more than they bought it. So it\u2019s important to talk up the prospects to build a \u201cfear of missing out\u201d.\n\nThere are loose claims that a large proportion of the population \u2013 generally in the range of 10% to 20% \u2013 now hold crypto. Sometimes these numbers are based on counting crypto wallets, or on surveying wealthy people.\n\nBut the hard data on Bitcoin use shows it is rarely bought for the purpose it ostensibly exists: to buy things.\n\nLittle use for payments\n\nThe whole point of Bitcoin, as its creator \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto\u201d stated in the opening sentence of the 2008 white paper outlining the concept, was that:\n\nA purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.\n\nThe latest data demolishing this idea comes from Australia\u2019s central bank.\n\nEvery three years the Reserve Bank of Australia surveys a representative sample of 1,000 adults about how they pay for things. As the following graph shows, cryptocurrency is making almost no impression as a payments instrument, being used by no more than 2% of adults.\n\nPayment methods being used by Australians\n\nReserve Bank calculations of Australians' awareness vs use of different payment methods, based on Ipsos data.\n\nBy contrast more recent innovations, such as \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d services and PayID, are being used by around a third of consumers.\n\nThese findings confirm 2022 data from the US Federal Reserve, showing just 2% of the adult US population made a payment using a cryptocurrrency, and Sweden\u2019s Riksbank, showing less than 1% of Swedes made payments using crypto.\n\nThe problem of price volatility\n\nOne reason for this, and why prices for goods and services are virtually never expressed in crypto, is that most fluctuate wildly in value. A shop or cafe with price labels or a blackboard list of their prices set in Bitcoin could be having to change them every hour.\n\nThe following graph from the Bank of International Settlements shows changes in the exchange rate of ten major cryptocurrencies against the US dollar, compared with the Euro and Japan\u2019s Yen, over the past five years. Such volatility negates cryptocurrency\u2019s value as a currency.\n\nCryptocurrency\u2019s volatile ways\n\nThere have been attempts to solve this problem with so-called \u201cstablecoins\u201d. These promise to maintain steady value (usually against the US dollar).\n\nBut the spectacular collapse of one of these ventures, Terra, once one of the largest cryptocurrencies, showed the vulnerability of their mechanisms. Even a company with the enormous resources of Facebook owner Meta has given up on its stablecoin venture, Libra/Diem.\n\nThis helps explain the failed experiments with making Bitcoin legal tender in the two countries that have tried it: El Salvador and the Central African Republic. The Central African Republic has already revoked Bitcoin\u2019s status. In El Salvador only a fifth of firms accept Bitcoin, despite the law saying they must, and only 5% of sales are paid in it.\n\nRead more: One year on, El Salvador's Bitcoin experiment has proven a spectacular failure\n\nStoring value, hedging against inflation\n\nIf Bitcoin\u2019s isn\u2019t used for payments, what use does it have?\n\nThe major attraction \u2013 one endorsed by mainstream financial publications \u2013 is as a store of value, particularly in times of inflation, because Bitcoin has a hard cap on the number of coins that will ever be \u201cmined\u201d.\n\nAs Forbes writers argued a few weeks ago:\n\nIn terms of quantity, there are only 21 million Bitcoins released as specified by the ASCII computer file. Therefore, because of an increase in demand, the value will rise which might keep up with the market and prevent inflation in the long run.\n\nThe only problem with this argument is recent history. Over the course of 2022 the purchasing power of major currencies (US, the euro and the pound) dropped by about 7-10%. The purchasing power of a Bitcoin dropped by about 65%.\n\nSpeculation or gambling?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price has always been volatile, and always will be. If its price were to stabilise somehow, those holding it as a speculative punt would soon sell it, which would drive down the price.\n\nBut most people buying Bitcoin essentially as a speculative token, hoping its price will go up, are likely to be disappointed. A BIS study has found the majority of Bitcoin buyers globally between August 2015 and December 2022 have made losses.\n\nThe \u201cmarket value\u201d of all cryptocurrencies peaked at US$3 trillion in November 2021. It is now about US$1 trillion.\n\nBitcoins\u2019s highest price in 2021 was about US$60,000; in 2022 US$40,000 and so far in 2023 only US$30,000. Google searches show that public interest in Bitcoin also peaked in 2021. In the US, the proportion of adults with internet access holding cryptocurrencies fell from 11% in 2021 to 8% in 2022.\n\nRead more: What is Bitcoin's fundamental value? That's a good question\n\nUK government research published in 2022 found that 52% of British crypto holders owned it as a \u201cfun investment\u201d, which sounds like a euphemism for gambling. Another 8% explicitly said it was for gambling.\n\nThe UK parliament\u2019s Treasury Committee, a group of MPs who examine economics and financial issues, has strongly recommended regulating cryptocurrency as form of gambling rather than as a financial product. They argue that continuing to treat \u201cunbacked crypto assets as a financial service will create a \u2018halo\u2019 effect that leads consumers to believe that this activity is safer than it is, or protected when it is not\u201d.\n\nRead more: Crypto trading: politicians who say it should be treated like gambling are completely wrong\n\nWhatever the merits of this proposal, the UK committtee\u2019s underlying point is solid. Buying crypto does have more in common with gambling than investing. Proceed at your own risk, and and don\u2019t \u201cinvest\u201d what you can\u2019t afford to lose."

        "content": "Interest in Central Bank Digital Currencies Picks Up in Latin America and the Caribbean While Crypto Use Varies\n\nCBDCs\u2014if well designed\u2014could lower remittances\u2019 costs and improve financial inclusion. But for crypto assets to safely remain part of the payment system, they need to be regulated.\n\nLatin America and the Caribbean (LAC) are at the forefront of digital money adoption, offering valuable lessons for the rest of the world. While El Salvador has made headlines by granting legal tender status to Bitcoin, other LAC countries have made significant strides in the introduction of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to either enhance financial inclusion and payment systems\u2019 resilience or lower cross-border remittances\u2019 costs, as our recent research shows.\n\nThe Bahamas pioneered the introduction of a CBDC with the Sand Dollar in 2020, and the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) and Jamaica have followed suit. Brazil\u2019s CBDC project is also in the advanced Proof-of-Concept stage, seeking to enhance \u201casset tokenization\u201d by turning assets, such real estate, stocks, and commodities, into digital representations to facilitate their transfer and increase their liquidity.\n\nNotably, four Latin American countries\u2014Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Ecuador\u2014ranked in 2022 among the top 20 in global adoption of crypto assets. They seek the benefits that digital assets claim to offer, including protection against uncertain domestic macroeconomic conditions, circumvention of capital controls, improved financial inclusion for unbanked populations, cheaper and faster payments, and stronger competition.\n\nHowever, crypto asset adoption also presents numerous challenges and risks, particularly for vulnerable LAC countries with a history of macroeconomic instability, low institutional credibility, substantial capital flows, corruption, and extensive informal sectors. Twelve out of nineteen jurisdictions in the region surveyed for our paper in mid-2022 either already have a special regulatory framework in place or are in the process of creating one.\n\nAdopting crypto\n\nRegulation of crypto assets varies across LAC countries. While El Salvador has made Bitcoin legal tender\u2014declared by law to be a valid payment instrument to settle transactions and financial obligations\u2014other countries like Argentina and the Dominican Republic have prohibited the use of crypto assets due to concerns about their impact on financial stability, currency and asset substitution, tax evasion, corruption, and money laundering.\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s experience with Bitcoin suggests there are risks to adopting unbacked crypto assets\u2014those that rely on supply and demand rather than on any asset for value and that are subject to significant price volatility\u2014even when explicitly supported by the government. A 2022 national survey suggests that Bitcoin is still not a widely accepted medium of exchange in El Salvador, despite its legal tender status and substantial government incentives.\n\nEffective adoption of stablecoins\u2014crypto assets that aim to have a stable price relative to a specified asset\u2014can also pose challenges, as demonstrated by Meta\u2019s pilot project. It would have allowed users in the US and Guatemala to make domestic and cross-border payments without fees through its digital wallet, the Novi. While potentially reducing costs of cross-border payments, the project also posed the risk of domestic currency substitution in Guatemala. It was wound down in 2022 amid Western regulatory pushback against Meta\u2019s expansion into cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe promise of CBDCs\n\nMost central banks in LAC are analyzing the potential introduction of CBDCs, with some island nations having already issued their own. According to our survey with government officials in the region, half of the respondents were considering both retail (i.e., designed for the general public) and wholesale (i.e., intended for use by financial institutions) CBDC options.\n\nMost survey participants viewed CBDCs as a means to enhance their payment systems and broaden their access. They deemed financial inclusion and monetary sovereignty as crucial factors in favor of retail CBDC issuance by facilitating the integration of unbanked individuals and curbing currency substitution towards stablecoins or crypto assets.\n\nOn top of these objectives, the central banks of the ECCU and the Bahamas have issued their own CBDCs to boost financial inclusion for communities in remote islands and to strengthen the resilience of the payments system to natural disasters and pandemics. A slow take-up and disruptions in access to CBDCs in these countries highlight the importance of investing in public awareness and robust infrastructure to promote the adoption of CBDCs.\n\nManaging risks\n\nCrypto assets present risks that vary by country circumstances. The IMF has provided guidance on key elements of an appropriate policy response to mitigate the risks while also harnessing the potential benefits of the technological innovation associated with crypto assets.\n\nIf well designed, CBDCs can strengthen the usability, resilience, and efficiency of payment systems and increase financial inclusion in LAC.\n\nWhile a few countries have completely banned crypto assets given their risks, this approach may not be effective in the long run. The region should instead focus on addressing the drivers of crypto demand, including citizens\u2019 unmet digital payment needs, and on improving transparency, by recording crypto asset transactions in national statistics.\n\n****\n\nRina Bhattacharya is a senior economist, Dmitry Vasilyev is an economist, and Mauricio Villafuerte is a division chief in the IMF\u2019s Western Hemisphere Department."

        "title": "A Bitcoin Renaissance: It's Not All About the Price - Nasdaq",
        "content": "To say OG blockchain Bitcoin has proven impervious to assassination attempts would be a stretch, but it\u2019s certainly shown itself to be robust and resilient since Satoshi Nakamoto bequeathed it to the world nearly 15 years ago. Despite numerous attempts to undermine, ban, burn and bury it, it continues to operate as a highly efficient, highly secure settlement network and a beacon of hope for those who've become disillusioned by the traditional financial system.\n\nObsessively tracking the price movements of bitcoin (BTC) has turned into a favorite pastime of many, with detractors delighting in announcing Bitcoin\u2019s demise only to crawl back under a rock when it inevitably rides out the rough spells. But continually sweating the value of one\u2019s stack does a disservice to the slow, steady and unsexy work that continues to go into finessing Bitcoin\u2019s operation. That said, a lot of developments have been happening at the blockchain level in recent months, to the extent that the price of bitcoin, for once, has become almost an afterthought.\n\nEven if the BTC price goes down \u2013 and it may well notch its first month of losses in 2023 \u2013 it\u2019s possible that Bitcoin may, as a consequence of such developments, cement its status as the preeminent layer-1 chain by claiming its rightful place above a sea of imitators and competitors.\n\nFrom Ordinals to Mintlayer: Bitcoin\u2019s Roaring 2023\n\nThese developments cannot have escaped your attention. Propelled by surging activity on Ordinals, the protocol that belatedly brought NFTs to Bitcoin, Satoshi\u2019s network became the second biggest NFT blockchain in May. A fact made all the more staggering given Bitcoin NFTs didn\u2019t exist prior to January.\n\nNFT sales on Bitcoin blew other blockchains out of the water as users started obsessively inscribing satoshis with data including Jpegs and text. The hype, for once, was real \u2013 even if many hardline Bitcoiners view Ordinals and the so-called BRC-20 token standard as a distraction. Indeed, Samson Mow told Cointelegraph that he expects the \u2018unsustainable' hype around Ordinals and BRC20 tokens to fade away within a matter of months.\n\nThe success of Ordinals, not to mention subsequent bitcoin NFT support from the likes of Binance, can be set to one side: the blockchain\u2019s 2023 renaissance is about more than just non-fungible tokens. We see it with Babylon, a project that wants to leverage the security of Bitcoin to augment and enhance the security of other chains, specifically those in the Cosmos ecosystem.\n\nEffectively, Babylon boosts the appeal of Bitcoin by functioning as a go-between between chains that need extra security and the gold-standard network. The project has ambitions to eventually get hundreds of chains using its service, since almost all will benefit from an extra layer of security. Just announced by its lead researcher, David Tse of Stanford University, a BTC staking protocol \u2013 the first of its kind, that allows BTC holders to participate in staking of other PoS networks. This new mechanism finally lends the famed security of the bitcoin blockchain for other, less secure PoS smart contract blockchain protocols.\n\nAnother project extending Bitcoin\u2019s function and enhancing its reputation is a collaboration between Swiss non-profit ZeroSync Association and infrastructure firm Blockstream. The partners are planning to broadcast Bitcoin zero-knowledge proofs from Blockstream\u2019s satellite, enabling the network\u2019s nodes to sync quickly from anywhere on Earth.\n\nGiven that one weapon of FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) aimed at Bitcoin suggests an internet blackout could destroy it, this seems like a worthwhile endeavor. Favoring ZK-proofs frees nodes from the need to download Bitcoin\u2019s 500GB of data and ensures expeditious syncing rather than a slow, methodical grind. The partnership has earmarked late 2023 for the first experimental broadcast from Blockstream\u2019s satellite network.\n\nThe DeFi boom of a few years back, followed by the arrival of GameFi and NFTs, may have created the impression that Bitcoin was being left behind. Or perhaps left to its devices, the better to focus on its original raison d\u2019etre as a store of value. Yet that impression is changing, and there is a growing sense that the single-function decentralized garden is opening up and coming into bloom. Forget the price of bitcoin for a second; the recent mood music may represent a new ascent of Bitcoin as a chain for all seasons.\n\nCan DeFi live on Bitcoin? It\u2019s a question many have mulled since DeFi Summer began in earnest three years ago. Now that we have Bitcoin-based NFTs, as well as layer-2 solutions like Mintlayer which let users build a DeFi ecosystem rooted in Bitcoin, it\u2019s no longer in the realms of the hypothetical.\n\nAs a Bitcoin sidechain supported by the Lightning Network, Mintlayer dispenses with the need for wrapped tokens or blockchain bridges (as well as their smart contract vulnerabilities), enabling users to directly exchange BTC using atomic swaps. Mintlayer can be used to create DEXs, lending platforms, marketplaces and much else besides, and the project counts Bitcoin Foundation founder Charlie Shrem as an advisor.\n\nAlthough launched in 2020, Mintlayer has found traction this year perhaps as a consequence of last year\u2019s many bridge exploits, not to mention a growing desire among bitcoiners to use BTC directly for DeFi plays. In April, the project announced a $4 million grants initiative to aid the development of Bitcoin-centric DeFi tools and resources.\n\nWhile Mintlayer has grand visions of bringing DeFi to Bitcoin, EVM rollup platform Rollux is leveraging Bitcoin\u2019s unrivaled security to facilitate fast, cheap, and secure transactions at scale. The brainchild of SYS Labs, Rollux\u2019s mainnet is set to launch on June 28 with the goal of bridging the gap \u201cbetween the existing capabilities of blockchain and the needs of users, developers, and enterprises,\u201d to quote SYS Labs\u2019 CEO Jagdeep Sidhu. It\u2019s yet another example of a project distinct from Bitcoin tapping into its fundamental strengths.\n\nWhat Next?\n\nAt the time of writing, the SEC is cracking down on exchanges with both Coinbase and Binance in its crosshairs. And with regulatory concerns swirling (aren\u2019t they ever?) talk has once again turned to the potential impact on bitcoin\u2019s price. The more things change, the more they stay the same.\n\nAway from price chatter, the picks-and-forks work continues without the same fanfare (or doomsaying) that greets every price swing, and somewhere on the horizon, the fourth Bitcoin halving looms. The ramifications of the halving can be debated another day. For now, let\u2019s raise a glass to the builders and believers, the passionate army quietly but very noticeably powering Bitcoin\u2019s latest renaissance.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "DeFi has long been at home on smart contract-capable virtual machine protocols like Ethereum and Solana. Bitcoin has generally been perceived as a tool for storing value, at least until the recent Ordinals craze got people thinking about what it could become.\n\nThe DeFi realm that once existed outside of the Bitcoin domain has been made available through solutions that operate on top of the protocol, with the advantages of security and liquidity built into the Bitcoin network.\n\nRetro-fitting modern scaling mechanisms to the slow-moving \u201cdigital gold\u201d blockchain has proven technically challenging. But do people really want DeFi on Bitcoin?\n\nDeFi apps with slick interfaces and robust smart contract options are commonplace elsewhere. But, according to Muneeb Ali, the most popular will inevitably find themselves on Bitcoin.\n\nThe co-creator of Stacks and CEO of Trust Machines spoke to Blockworks on the 0xResearch podcast (Spotify / Apple) about the \u201cBitcoin thesis\u201d \u2014 the long-standing argument among loyalists that says any useful application on another chain will eventually come to Bitcoin.\n\nAnd any app or asset that makes its way to the network will also be more valuable, he says, \u201cbecause they will benefit from the security of Bitcoin, the durability of Bitcoin, but above all the liquidity of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m very confident in the \u2018yet\u2019\n\nAli says market data previously demonstrated a lack of interest in building for such use-cases on Bitcoin, but that\u2019s changing. \u201cThis year, with Ordinals and more recently with BRC-20, part of the thesis is actually coming true.\u201d\n\nThis is \u201cliterally the case\u201d with NFTs, he says. Once inscribed on Bitcoin, the market assessed some previously Ethereum-based tokens with hefty prices earlier this year.\n\nTrailing Ethereum alone, \u201cBitcoin is now number two in terms of trading volumes of NFTs. And Solana is number three,\u201d he says. \u201cSix months ago, this would be unimaginable. Bitcoin was not even on the map.\u201d\n\nIt hasn\u2019t played out in DeFi \u2014 yet. \u201cI\u2019m very confident in the \u2018yet\u2019,\u201d Ali says.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is the more pristine capital,\u201d Ali says. More people have bought into the idea of bitcoin as money or as a potential reserve currency, he says.\n\nBut not for much else.\n\nThat\u2019s not the fault of Bitcoin, according to Ali. It\u2019s mostly due to lack of infrastructure \u2014 tooling, wallets, and the developer community around Bitcoin \u2014 as opposed to a lack of interest, he says.\n\nPeople will use Bitcoin\n\nAli argues there\u2019s plenty of demand for smart contract solutions on Bitcoin. He gives the example of RSK, or Rootstock, a smart contract competitor to Stacks that\u2019s been building on the network for years. \u201cThey did their fundraising in Bitcoin and I think 25,000 BTC came into that raise.\u201d\n\nStacks differs from RSK in a few key ways, with its \u201cnovel consensus mechanism, ambitious plans for subnets,\u201d and in particular, its \u201cunique BTC bridge\u201d that does not rely on \u201ca trusted set of signers,\u201d according to Blockworks Research.\n\nAli mentions examples of applications like privacy tumblers that have seen large volumes of bitcoin being used, despite them being \u201creally clunky.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best you can do on [layer-1],\u201d he says, \u201cbut it\u2019s nothing close to a zero-knowledge-based solution that has great UX\u201d \u2014 something that is more likely to be found on Ethereum or Solana. For now, anyway.\n\n\u201cIf you start bringing those use cases,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s as obvious as putting two and two together that people will use Bitcoin.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe challenge really is in the infrastructure tooling, devs, and UX wallets,\u201d he says. \u201cI think that needs to be much more mature than the state we are in today.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The most dominant cryptocurrency on the market is authoring a dramatic comeback.\n\nAfter a large dip last Thursday, when Bitcoin dropped below $25,000 in response to the U.S. central bank\u2019s hawkish tone during an announced pause on interest rate increases, the cryptocurrency crossed the $30,000 mark on Wednesday.\n\nIn one day, the price of one Bitcoin increased more than 12%, rising from just above $27,000 to almost $30,700, the highest mark in over a year. The cryptocurrency had previously passed the $30,000 threshold in April at about $30,400, which was then the highest peak it had summited since it dropped to almost $16,000 just months earlier.\n\nThe crypto market has echoed the sudden surge, with Ether, the native token for the Ethereum blockchain, up 8.5% to about $1,900. And unsurprisingly, given Bitcoin\u2019s dominance, the total market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies has jumped to approximately $1.17 trillion, a more than 8% increase over the past day. Bitcoin\u2019s price rally is out of step with the broader stock market, as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are slightly down in the past 24 hours.\n\nThe surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price follows a rush of recent interest from institutional investors in Bitcoin and the crypto market.\n\n\u201cInvestors are starting to see the massive scale of institutional and professional capital that\u2019s going to enter the market over the next few years,\u201d Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, told Fortune. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to get in early.\u201d\n\nShortly after the Federal Reserve\u2019s announcement last Thursday, BlackRock filed an application for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund that, if approved, would be the first of its kind in the U.S. and expose the cryptocurrency to potentially trillions of dollars from retail investors and pension funds. The price of Bitcoin jumped after the news and stayed steady at around $27,000.\n\nOn Tuesday, further news of institutional investment buoyed the crypto market. EDX Markets, an exchange backed by TradFi titans Citadel, Charles Schwab, and Fidelity, announced its launch. Then two other asset managers joined the ETF application fray, as WisdomTree and Invesco filed separate applications for Bitcoin spot ETFs. \u201cThere is a greater recognition in the market that Bitcoin is becoming a mainstream asset class,\u201d Paolo Ardoino, CTO of crypto exchange Bitfinex, told Fortune. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing some of the biggest investment funds becoming interested once more in the asset.\u201d\n\nSome analysts, however, are striking a more measured tone.\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting to see if this new wave of institutional buying is sustainable,\u201d Michael Safai, managing partner at crypto trading firm Dexterity Capital, told Fortune in an email, \u201cand whether these firms will join their hedge fund peers in looking beyond just the top two or three coins.\u201d\n\nUpdate, June 21, 2023: This article has been updated with a comment from Bitwise and Dexterity Capital."

This recovery is noteworthy because it follows extensive reports of two top crypto liquidity providers curtailing their U.S. trading activity, which would, all else equal, imply a deterioration of order book depth instead of the improvement we have seen.Among non-BTC and non-ETH assets, the market's focus on liquidity is related to the impact on some of the assets mentioned in the SEC charges against Coinbase and Binance. Two weeks since the news broke, trading volumes in the five most prominent assets by market capitalization (SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, and ATOM) have not changed significantly. The most notable shift in these assets has been how trading activity seems to have moved from the U.S. to international markets since the beginning of the year, as the chart below shows."

        "content": "Bitcoin Surges Past $30,000 \u2013 5 Reasons To Buy BTC Now\n\nAfter a 3-month downtrend, Bitcoin has roared back into life - surging past 30k. Against the backdrop of a worsening global economic crisis, are there still good reasons to buy Bitcoin? Is a new bull run just getting started?\n\nIs now a good time to buy Bitcoin? Over the last 18 months, Bitcoin and the wider crypto market have endured a torrid bear market that saw prices plummet following the collapse of industry stalwarts such as Celsius, BlockFi, Three Arrows Capital, and FTX.\n\nHowever, after dropping as low as $16,000 in November, BTC has staged an impressive recovery to begin 2023. With BTC up 83% year-to-date and blasting through $30,000, many technical analysts are now suggesting that the bottom is not only in, but a new uptrend is underway.\n\nFor new investors exploring Bitcoin for the first time, the landscape can be confusing, even intimidating. Perspectives on Bitcoin vary wildly from bullish zealots on the one hand to those who dismiss it as a worthless ponzi scheme on the other. If you\u2019re asking yourself \u2018should I buy Bitcoin now\u2019, here are five macro trends and data points to consider.\n\n1. The next Bitcoin Halving is Approaching\n\nThe Bitcoin halving, also known as the \"Bitcoin block reward halving,\" is a predetermined event that occurs approximately every four years in the Bitcoin network. It refers to the reduction in the rate at which new Bitcoins are created and awarded to miners for validating transactions and securing the network.\n\nThe next Bitcoin halving is approximately 300 days away. In trading markets, a lower supply with the same demand will lead to higher prices. Since the halving reduces the supply of new Bitcoins, and demand usually remains the same, the halving has preceded some of Bitcoin\u2019s largest bull runs.\n\nIn the Bitcoin protocol, there is a limited supply of 21 million Bitcoins that can ever exist. The issuance of new Bitcoins is programmed to gradually decrease over time. Initially, when Bitcoin was created in 2009, the block reward was set at 50 Bitcoins per block. However, as part of the network\u2019s design, this reward is cut in half roughly every 210,000 blocks, or about every four years.\n\nIn the 2024 halving, the reward will drop from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC.\n\nThe importance of the Bitcoin halving stems from its impact on the supply and inflation rate of Bitcoin. With each halving event, the rate at which new Bitcoins are produced is reduced by 50%. This reduction has significant implications for the Bitcoin ecosystem:\n\nScarcity: The halving is designed to gradually reduce the supply of new Bitcoins entering circulation, making Bitcoin increasingly scarce over time. This scarcity aspect is often cited as one of the reasons for Bitcoin\u2019s potential to store value and act as \"digital gold.\"\n\nInflation control: By reducing the rate of new coin issuance, the halving acts as a mechanism to control Bitcoin\u2019s inflation. As the supply growth slows down, it can potentially lead to increased demand, which may drive up the price of Bitcoin.\n\nMarket dynamics: The halving can have a profound impact on market dynamics, as it affects the incentives for miners. Miners, who validate transactions and maintain the network, receive newly minted Bitcoins as a reward. When the block reward is halved, miners receive fewer Bitcoins, which can influence their profitability and operational decisions. This can impact the overall network hashrate, mining difficulty, and potentially even the security of the network.\n\nMarket speculation: The anticipation and occurrence of the halving event often generates significant interest and speculation within the cryptocurrency community and beyond. Some believe that the reduction in the supply rate could lead to upward price pressure, as historical data has shown that previous halvings have been associated with bull markets.\n\nEvery Bitcoin halving has been followed by a new all time high.\n\n2. Bitcoin\u2019s value proposition is perfectly suited to the macro climate\n\nBitcoin was born out of the Global Financial Crisis of 2009. Against a backdrop of bank failures, government bailouts, and quantitative easing, Bitcoin was quietly deployed into the wild where it was ignored by everyone except for a small but growing group of idealists.\n\nA decade and a half later, and we are seeing a new financial crisis with more bailouts, more wobbly banks, and a monetary establishment trapped between interest rate hikes, runaway inflation, and the siren song of money printing.\n\nAs Brave New Coin founder Fran Strajnar explained in a recent editorial, \u201cthe current banking crisis is a result of the \u2018transitory\u2019 lie. The Fed should have reacted to inflation six months earlier, and raised rates more gradually. Instead, they slammed on the brakes and now we have a car crash.\u201d\n\nWith the Fed itself originally forecasting no major rate hikes as recently as 12 months ago, many banks parked huge sums in \"the world\u2019s safest asset\" \u2013 US Treasuries.\n\nThis of course turned into sharp pain on the balance sheets of various mid-sized banks in particular, as they purchased multi-year Treasuries thinking they were stable and predictable (and the Fed was shouting from the rooftops assuring no major rate hikes not long ago).\n\nFormer Chief Technology Officer of Coinbase, and former general partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, Balaji Srinivasan goes further in stating the seriousness of the current banking crisis.\n\nHe wrote on Twitter, \u201cJust as in 2008, the bankers lied. This time, the central bankers, the banks, and the bank regulators have lied to all dollar holders and depositors. This isn\u2019t your typical fractional reserve situation. The problem is that there isn\u2019t enough in the banks on a mark-to-market basis to cover withdrawals.\u201d\n\nThey knew this throughout all of last year and communicated it internally in their coded language. The central banks, the banks, and the banking regulators all knew a huge crash was coming \u2014 the phrase is \"unrealized losses\". But they never notified you, the depositor.\n\nWith the Fed likely to continue to print money to ensure deposit liquidity can be met in the event of a bank-run crisis, Balaji says hyperinflation is a real possibility. The solution? Bitcoin of course.\n\n\u201cThis is the clearest way to see what\u2019s happening,\u201d writes Balaji. \u201cThey\u2019ve decided to monetize the debt in the messiest way possible by printing $150B+ for insolvent banks to cover an orgy of bank runs. The dollar supply is now going vertical and so is the demand for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto appears to have designed Bitcoin as a possible solution to this exact scenario. In 2009, shortly after the release of the Bitcoin white paper, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin posted to an internet forum.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that\u2019s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal says that as central banks again consider quantitative easing, the stage is set for hard assets such as Bitcoin and gold to perform well. \u201cHuge quantitative easing of fiat meets the hardest money that automatically quantitatively tightens. Bitcoin wins.\u201d\n\nThe contrast between central bank quantitative easing and an ever-expanding money supply against the quantitative tightening of Bitcoin\u2019s third halving is stark. Fiat currency supply is growing quickly, while the scarcity narrative of Bitcoin is growing in importance.\n\nMoney printing looks set to again find its way into asset prices, including gold and Bitcoin. A small reallocation of even 1% from other asset classes to Bitcoin would represent capital inflows greater than Bitcoin\u2019s current market cap.\n\n3. Bitcoin is still in the buy zone\n\nDave The Wave is a pseudo-anonymous investor, trader, and technical analyst. A contrarian, Dave has a unique insight into Bitcoin, its chart history, and its potential chart future.\n\nDave is the author of the Bitcoin Logarithmic Growth Curve chart, one of the few accurate predictive models of Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nBitcoin is still in the buy zone (the shaded area on the charts below) of the LGC. Historically, buying Bitcoin in the \u2018buy zone\u2019 has proved profitable over the long term, and is certainly preferable to buying at the top of the channel when Bitcoin is overheated and in danger of crashing. Bitcoin has been in the buy zone (some might call it the accumulation zone) for almost 16 months now, and while Bitcoin is in the buy zone, the risk/reward for buyers/investors remains favorable. As Dave says \u201cbuy the dip, not the top\u201d.\n\nAs Dave\u2019s next chart below shows \u2013 when Bitcoin moves it can move quickly. While Bitcoin is still in the buy zone, a potential target for the next bull run is $150,000.\n\n4. On a long timeframe Bitcoin is the best performing asset on the planet\n\nOn a 3-year time horizon or more, Bitcoin is one of the best-performing assets on the planet as the chart below shows.\n\nSource: https://casebitcoin.com/charts\n\nBitcoin\u2019s strong performance has not escaped the notice of Wall Street analysts, investors and companies.\n\nIt\u2019s exactly this long term performance that reflects MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor\u2019s belief that \"Bitcoin, as the world\u2019s most widely-adopted cryptocurrency, is a dependable store of value and an attractive investment asset with more long-term appreciation potential than holding cash. MicroStrategy has recognized Bitcoin as a legitimate investment asset that can be superior to cash and accordingly has made Bitcoin the principal holding in its treasury reserve strategy.\"\n\nFollowing MicroStrategy\u2019s lead, in October 2020, payment platform Square announced that it had invested $50 million in Bitcoin, buying a total of 4,709 Bitcoins. Square said the investment represents about 1 percent of its total assets. Square said it was making the purchase because \u201cBitcoin has the potential to be a more ubiquitous currency in the future and an instrument of economic empowerment that provides a way for the world to participate in a global monetary system.\u201d\n\nJack Dorsey, the CEO of Square is a long-time Bitcoin evangelist and investor. Square has previously invested in bitcoin from a product, leadership, and legal innovation perspective, and today adds this financial investment. The company launched bitcoin trading in 2018 with Cash App, which enables the buying and selling of bitcoin. In 2019, the company formed Square Crypto, an independent team solely focused on contributing to bitcoin open-source work for the benefit of all, and also recently launched the Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance (COPA), a non-profit organization encouraging crypto innovation and opening access to patented crypto inventions.\n\nWhile the 2022 bear market crash and crypto company blow-up has deterred any other public companies from following MicroStrategy and Square\u2019s lead, that might be about to change.\n\nBack in 2021 Jack Dorsey tweeted that hyperinflation is coming.\n\nAs reported above, Balaji Srinivasan is now making the case that hyperinflation is imminent. The Fed is devaluing the dollar. This is what Ray Dalio predicted: the monetization of the debt.\n\nIf this trend continues, and any bank runs begin, that could turn into a positive feedback loop for Bitcoin. First individuals will rush to protect their wealth by buying Bitcoin, then companies, the institutions, and then small nation states. Will this scenario actually happen this year? It seems far-fetched, but the one lesson we can learn from history is that when hyperinflation happens, it happens fast.\n\nIn 1923, at the worst time of German hyperinflation, the exchange rate between the dollar and the Mark was one trillion Marks to one dollar, and a wheelbarrow full of money would not even buy a newspaper. Most Germans were taken completely by surprise by the speed of the financial tornado. In today\u2019s digital world, it\u2019s likely that hyperinflation happens even faster.\n\nSource: Twitter\n\n5. A Bitcoin Spot ETF may finally be approved\n\nFor ten years, countless crypto exchanges, startups and institutions have tried and failed to win SEC approval for a U.S. Bitcoin Spot ETF.\n\nThe launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF would be a significant step in the legitimization of the crypto asset industry. It would open the door to an eventual pathway for the wider American investment community to invest in Bitcoin. It would mean investors don\u2019t have to custody Bitcoin themselves and should attract significant new inflows.\n\nThis month, asset giant BlackRock, which manages $9.5 trillion in assets, surprised the crypto world when it applied to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Though the product is technically a trust, it is the same as a spot ETF, analysts say.\n\nIt is thought that Blackrock\u2019s (BLK) iShares Bitcoin Trust application has a better chance of approval by the SEC than all other applications to date. That\u2019s because of a \u201csurveillance-sharing agreement\u201d between exchanges.\n\nOn page 36 of the 19b-4 filing, it says that to avoid market manipulation, the Nasdaq will enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement with an operator of a spot trading platform for Bitcoin.\n\nThis could finally satisfy the SEC, that the ETF can function without market manipulation, a charge it has used to deny previous Bitcoin Spot ETF proposals.\n\nIs BlackRock going to succeed where all others have failed? The current regulatory environment remains uncertain but the Wall Street giant has the best shot yet.\n\nWe\u2019ll know early next year, about one month before the halving. If they succeed, expect Bitcoin fireworks.\n\nThe application can be read here.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs the below chart from Rekt Capital indicates, the downward resistance trendline from the most recent all time high has been broken. This suggests that we are at the very beginning of a new uptrend that will eventually blossom into a full blown bull market.\n\nHistorical price data suggests that Bitcoin will eventually exceed its most recent all-time high of $69,000. Whether or not it happens this year, or next year, the risk-reward continues to favor those investors who buy when Bitcoin is in the lower part of the LGC channel and hold for the long term.\n\nBitcoin appears to be an asymmetric bet. If one only invests what one can afford to lose, there is a limited risk of loss with the benefit of substantial upside. Based on Bitcoin\u2019s network effects, growing adoption, the supply shock following next year\u2019s halving, and the volatile macro backdrop, Bitcoin appears set to outperform in the years ahead. How long will you stay on the sidelines?"

Read preview\n\nThere are exceptional and very ordinary aspects of the application BlackRock filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission last week to launch a exchange-traded fund that would track the price of bitcoin.\n\nBlackRock is a fund manager. It creates, manages, and distributes funds. It has 1,300 ETFs! This is literally what it does! And investors knew about the partnership BlackRock struck last year with Coinbase, the crypto exchange BlackRock said it would use as a bitcoin custodian on behalf of the iShares Bitcoin Trust if regulators approve it.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nThe effort to launch a spot bitcoin ETF, though, is a meaningful development in cryptoland. \"The future of crypto is more BlackRock and less Binance,\" Matt Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise Asset Management, tweeted, and Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz tweeted that BlackRock launching a bitcoin ETF \"would be the best thing that could happen\" to bitcoin.\n\nWall Street's top regulator has so far rejected other, smaller asset managers' applications to launch similar vehicles. The crypto money manager Grayscale even sued the SEC last year after it tossed out Grayscale's application to turn a bitcoin trust into a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd a renewed commitment between the world's largest asset manager and Coinbase, which the SEC accused of violating securities laws earlier this month, may give the crypto company a reputational boost. (Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said in a tweet on June 6 that \"the complaint filed against us is exclusively focused on what is or is not a security,\" and that \"we are confident in our facts and the law.\")\n\nI've covered BlackRock's path to embracing crypto. Here's part of my inside story with Morgan Chittum from last fall, below, and here's a separate rundown of the BlackRock employees involved in crypto initiatives at the firm.\n\nBut even as crypto enthusiasts found advocates internally, people left. There was a \"line in BlackRock to do the fun work\" of working on digital assets or blockchain research full time, another former employee said.\n\nIt \"looked impossible for BlackRock to do anything\" significant in the space in the near term, the person said. \"That's why I think many of us left.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlackRock is now working on its partnerships with Coinbase and Circle and focusing on the four parts of its crypto strategy: stablecoins, tokenization, permissioned blockchains, and crypto assets.\n\nBlackRock leadership is highlighting those efforts. While acknowledging the \"steep downturn\" in crypto assets, Fink said on an earnings conference call this summer that the firm was still seeing \"more interest from institutional clients about how to efficiently access these assets.\"\n\nThe price of bitcoin has rallied near its highest level of 2023 in the days since BlackRock filed its application, eclipsing $30,000 on Wednesday. Potential implications for the wider digital assets ecosystem aside, it's worth examining other reactions to the application.\n\nCrypto influencers have seized on BlackRock's new crypto efforts, underscoring the relatively new scrutiny BlackRock faces from the everyday investors and the general public. Enter the outlandish comments about BlackRock's position in the crypto market, another front in the scrutiny around the firm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"So BlackRock, Citadel, Deutsche Bank and NASDAQ have all started to enter the crypto space in the last week. They've bullied out participants so they can scoop up cheap coins. The trajectory for crypto has never been more clear,\" one venture capitalist wrote to his 197,000 followers.\n\nA business podcast host tweeted to his 903,000 followers: \"They're not trying to kill crypto. They're trying to kill the current crypto industry and then hand it over to their cronies. Citadel, BlackRock, Schwab JPMorgan\u2026\" (These tweets refer to Citadel, the hedge fund founded and led by billionaire Ken Griffin. But it is market maker Citadel Securities, also founded by Griffin, that backed a recently launched crypto exchange called EDX.)\n\nA BlackRock spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nOf course, the firm's sheer size has long been the subject of criticism from regulators and officials who take issue with its dominance in the ETF market. But the ESG investing-related scrutiny that ramped up last year has brought a new awareness of BlackRock to the mainstream. That's pushed BlackRock to get ahead of theories and videos that spread widely online; I spoke with Rich Latour, the firm's global head of content and media about that a year ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We've certainly done research, and we know that there's a perception that a lot is going on in BlackRock that people don't necessarily understand,\" Latour said last June."

        "content": "Those scanning through the latest pile of proposed spot bitcoin ETF filings have likely seen a term come up again and again: surveillance-sharing agreement.\n\nMentions are plastered all over the proposal by asset management giant BlackRock, as well more recent filers, such as Valkyrie, Bitwise, WisdomTree and Invesco.\n\nWhen considering proposed bitcoin ETFs, the SEC weighs whether the intended listing exchange \u2014 Nasdaq, NYSE or another entity \u2014 can meet certain obligations under the Exchange Act to prevent fraud and manipulation.\n\nThe exchange can do this by demonstrating it has \u201ca comprehensive surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size related to the underlying or reference bitcoin assets,\u201d according to a June 2022 SEC order rejecting Bitwise\u2019s bid for a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe size of such a market is not quantified numerically.\n\nThe metric rather refers to a market in which there is \u201ca reasonable likelihood\u201d a would-be manipulator would have to trade on that market to do so \u2014 \u201cso that a surveillance-sharing agreement would assist in detecting and deterring misconduct,\u201d the document states.\n\nA market of significant size would also be one in which trading in the ETP would not be the predominant influence on pricing.\n\nSurveillance-sharing agreements are not the only way exchanges seeking to list a bitcoin ETF can meet Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, the SEC notes in the Bitwise order.\n\nBut, the securities regulator says, \u201csuch agreements have previously provided the basis for the exchanges that list commodity-trust ETPs to meet those obligations, and the commission has historically recognized their importance.\u201d\n\nThey allow for information sharing about market trading activity, clearing activity and customer identity, the SEC has said.\n\nDavid Hirsch, chief of the crypto asset and cyber unit within the SEC\u2019s division of enforcement, said last week prospective spot bitcoin ETF issuers have not established there is \u201can adequate system of surveillance\u201d comparable to trading on a registered exchange.\n\nEnter BlackRock, a fund giant with roughly $9 trillion assets under management \u2014 which last week, for the first time, filed for a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nRead more: Is BlackRock\u2019s clout enough to get its spot bitcoin ETF past the SEC?\n\nThe June 15 filing by Nasdaq, the exchange on which its ETF would be listed, points out the SEC\u2019s approval of ETFs that hold bitcoin futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).\n\n\u201cIf CME\u2019s surveillance is sufficient to mitigate concerns related to trading in bitcoin futures for which the pricing is based directly on pricing from spot bitcoin markets, it\u2019s not clear how such a conclusion could apply only to ETPs based on bitcoin futures and not extend to spot bitcoin ETPs,\u201d it states.\n\nNasdaq expects to enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement with \u201can operator of a US-based spot trading platform for bitcoin,\u201d which is not named in the filing.\n\nSumit Roy, a senior analyst at ETF.com, told Blockworks earlier this week that the additional agreement might not be enough for approval, particularly if the platform operator is Coinbase \u2014 a company the SEC sued earlier this month.\n\n\u201cBut because BlackRock is involved, there is hope that they have the inside scoop and will get this done,\u201d Roy said.\n\nProposals feature different exchanges\n\nInvestment firm Valkyrie on Wednesday became the latest to re-join the spot bitcoin ETF race.\n\nThe company\u2019s last attempt to launch a spot bitcoin ETF ended in December 2021 when the SEC failed to give it the go-ahead.\n\nThe Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund, according to the new filing, would trade under the ticker BRRR \u2014 seemingly a reference to the sound of a money printer.\n\nThe firm, like BlackRock, named Nasdaq as its listing exchange, which Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart said in a tweet could give it an edge over others.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nValkyrie\u2019s new bid followed a filing by Bitwise, as well as those by more traditional finance players WisdomTree and Invesco. It was not their first attempt.\n\nBitwise\u2019s proposed spot bitcoin ETF would be listed on NYSE Arca, while the planned products by WisdomTree and Invesco would trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange.\n\nA prospective spot bitcoin ETF by Ark Invest and 21Shares, re-filed for in April, would also trade on Cboe.\n\n\u201cIt depends on when [and] if the SEC approves the 19b-4 applications for the other exchanges,\u201d Seyffart told Blockworks in an email. \u201cIf there are multiple days between approval of Nasdaq\u2019s application and NYSE/Cboe, then that would be a theoretical window for Valkyrie to slip their fund in before the [others].\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

The rally follows news of more major financial institutions venturing into crypto after BlackRock announced a Bitcoin ETF application last week. In addition, the U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in congressional testimony on Wednesday that Bitcoin has \u201cstaying power.\u201d\n\nCrypto\n\nBitcoin surged 6.72% over the last 24 hours to US$30,118.51 at 7:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, up 20.33% for the past week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency broke through the US$30,000 resistance line early morning on Thursday for the first time since April.\n\nEther also rose 6.04% to US$1,893, gaining 14.79% for the week.\n\n\u201cMarket confidence has recently been buoyed by BlackRock\u2019s BTC ETF application as they\u2019ve successfully attained 575 ETF applications with only one denial, while Fidelity is rumored to be following right behind with a BTC ETF application too,\u201d said Nick Ruck, the chief operating officer of blockchain venture studio ContentFi Labs, in an emailed statement.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager with US$8.59 trillion under management as of the end of 2022, filed an application on June 15 for the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Other leading financial institutions followed, despite U.S. regulators this month filing lawsuits against crypto exchanges, alleging they illegally trade many tokens that should have been registered as financial securities.\n\nIn a related bullish development, EDX Markets, the New Jersey-based digital asset exchange backed by Wall Street firms, such as Citadel Securities, Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab Corp., opened for business in the U.S. on Tuesday.

He also said that the central bank should have a stronger role in regulating stablecoins.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies gained in the past 24 hours. Cardano\u2019s ADA jumped 7.02% to US$0.287 for a weekly increase of 9.61%, helped by news of network improvements. Litecoin rose 6.56% to US$85.28, up 16.87% in the past seven days.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP token jumped 5.10% to US$0.5217 Thursday morning after San Francisco-based Ripple Labs said it received in-principle approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore to offer digital payment services in the city-state.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market capitalization rose 4.96% to US$1.17 trillion in the last 24 hours, while trading volume surged 59.05% to US$60.3 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nNFT little changed\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.43% to 2,910.36 in the 24 hours to 8:45 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index is down 0.50% for the week.\n\nTotal NFT transactions rose 1.15% to US$53.4 million, while transactions on Ethereum rose 81% to US$15.3 million.\n\n\u201cOverall kind of a boring day in NFTs,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. \u201cThere is some excitement about all of the news in crypto, but that\u2019s not impacting NFTs yet, other than helping us stay even instead of maintaining that decline we were in.\u201d\n\nEthereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT transactions surged 95.51% to US$1.9 million. Transactions in Mutant Ape Yacht Club, another collection from Yuga Labs, grew 44.93% to exceed US$1 million. Yuga Labs said Wednesday it is launching a new game on June 29 based on its Bored Ape-related HV-MTL NFT collection.\n\nU.S. futures dip following Powell speech\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell | Image: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded lower as of 11:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures and the S&P 500 futures both inched down 0.11%, while Nasdaq futures dipped 0.19%.\n\nThe three major U.S. stock indexes closed lower on Wednesday after Fed chair Powell told a U.S. Congress committee that interest rate will need to go higher to tame inflation, which is now at around 4.05% or on a declining trend, but still more than double the Fed\u2019s target of 2%.\n\nWhile the Fed left rates unchanged at its meeting on June 14, it does project rates to reach 5.6% in 2023, indicating two more rate hikes within the year.\n\n\u201cInflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent,\u201d Powell said. \u201cNearly all FOMC participants expect that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year.\u201d\n\nPowell is scheduled to speak again on Thursday before the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nU.S. interest rates are now between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The Federal Reserve\u2019s next meeting on rates is July 26. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 28.1% chance the Fed will keep rates unchanged in July, and a 71.9% chance for another 25-basis-point rate hike, down from 76.9% on Wednesday.\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"

        "content": "Investment firms Invesco and WisdomTree are making more attempts to secure approval to launch spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) following initial rejections.\n\nTheir renewed efforts come just days after the world\u2019s largest asset manager BlackRock made its own bid to launch such a fund.\n\nIn its Tuesday filing, Invesco contends that the lack of a spot bitcoin ETF puts US investors at considerable risk, as they may resort to utilizing unreliable digital asset accounts, like many did with FTX, Celsius, BlockFi and Voyager.\n\nAvailability of a spot bitcoin ETP could have resulted in billions of dollars remaining invested in a regulated and well-understood structure, rather than being tied up in proceedings, it added. Invesco, one of the largest ETF issuers in the world, had $1.4 trillion assets under management as of April.\n\nInvesco is pursuing approval to list the \u201cInvesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF\u201d on the Cboe BZX exchange, while WisdomTree is seeking to list the \u201cWisdomTree Bitcoin Trust\u201d on the same platform.\n\nInvesco previously filed for an ETF in partnership with Galaxy in 2021 but abandoned the endeavor a few months later.\n\nThe new applications come at a time of heightened scrutiny by US regulators regarding potential violations of securities laws within the crypto industry.\n\nWisdomTree confident in maturing bitcoin market\n\nWisdomTree said in its own Tuesday filing that \u201cthe bitcoin market has matured such that it is operating at a level of efficiency and scale similar in material respects to established global equity, fixed income and commodity markets.\u201d\n\nWisdomTree had $90.7 billion in assets under management as of April. The SEC turned down WisdomTree\u2019s first spot bitcoin ETF application in Dec. 2021 and rejected its second application in Oct. 2022, as it has done with mountains of bids over the years.\n\nThe SEC has previously dismissed such submissions on grounds that the issuer (in this case Fidelity) had not demonstrated the proposed fund is \u201cdesigned to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts\u201d and to \u201cprotect investors and the public interest.\u201d\n\nA futures-based bitcoin ETF is already approved in the US, mainly due to their reliance on futures contracts traded on the regulated Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nBut while the approval of those products indicates progress and a growing acceptance of bitcoin-related investment products, each type of ETF is subject to its own set of regulatory considerations.\n\nA futures-based ETF derives its value from futures contracts, while a spot bitcoin ETF directly holds and tracks the price of physical bitcoin in the spot market.\n\nNot just Invesco: Loads more spot bitcoin ETFs filings\n\nBitwise also submitted a filing to offer a spot bitcoin ETF last week. According to Bitwise CEO Matt Hougan, BlackRock\u2019s filing can be seen as the start of the mainstream era for crypto.\n\nIn April, Ark Invest and 21Shares also re-submitted their application for a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nAnalysts from Bloomberg Intelligence mentioned that other potential issuers like VanEck, Valkyrie, WisdomTree, Global X, and Invesco might follow suit.\n\nSome observers predict that even more players will now jump back into the spot bitcoin ETF race.\n\nMeanwhile, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) persists as the largest BTC exchange-traded product, with 635,236 BTC ($18.4 billion) under management \u2014 nearly 3.3% of the circulating supply.\n\nBitcoin locked in GBTC is non-redeemable, as opposed to the recently proposed spot ETFs, which would be fully redeemable. GBTC\u2019s closed-ended structure has led to a steep discount on its shares compared to its net asset value, at times around 50%.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s application to convert GBTC into an ETF was denied last year, for which the DCG-owned firm sued the SEC in response. Still, markets have repaired the GBTC discount somewhat following the recent wave of ETF applications from Wall Street heavyweights, now at 33% compared to 42% at the start of June.\n\nDavid Canellis contributed reporting\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Bitcoin surged over 5% in Wednesday morning trading in Asia to breach the US$28,000 resistance level, leading a rally of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies except XRP. Bitcoin\u2019s jump followed the Tuesday evening launch of EDX Markets, a cryptocurrency exchange backed by major Wall Street players such as Citadel Securities, Fidelity and Charles Schwab. Meanwhile, the U.S. equity futures edged lower as investors waited for the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s Wednesday testimony to Congress, with economic data on Tuesday pointing to a recovery in the U.S. housing market.\n\nBitcoin leads crypto rally\n\nBitcoin jumped 5.65% over the last 24 hours to US$28,285 at 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, moving up 9.36% for the past seven days, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency breached the US$28,000 mark early Wednesday for the first time since May 30.\n\nEther also gained 2.94% to US$1,788 and added 3% for the week. Most top 10 non-stablecoin tokens traded higher in the past 24 hours as Bitcoin spearheaded the rally, with the exception of XRP, which dipped 0.34% over the same period.\n\nEDX Markets, a New Jersey-based crypto exchange, officially launched on Tuesday. Its investors include Fidelity Investment, an asset manager overseeing more than US$4 trillion in assets, and will offer Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and Litecoin trading services.\n\nThe launch of EDX Markets echoes BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund filing last week, which indicates institutional interest in cryptocurrencies despite the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s crackdown on the industry.\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s probability of approving the Blackrock Bitcoin ETF is high,\u201d said Markus Thielen, head of crypto research at digital asset service platform Matrixport, in an email. \u201cThe ETF might be approved by September/October 2023 and will attract US$10 billion within three months and US$20 billion within six months \u2014 materially supporting Bitcoin prices.\u201d\n\nAdding to the signals of institutional adoption, German investment bank Deutsche Bank has reportedly applied for a license from German regulators to offer custody services for digital assets including cryptocurrencies, according to Bloomberg on Tuesday.\n\nOn the regulatory front, the U.K.\u2019s Financial Services and Markets Bill, which proposes cryptocurrency regulation in the country, was approved by the Parliament\u2019s upper house on Sunday, signaling that the bill is now in its final stage before being enacted into law.\n\n\u201c[The bill] could essentially recognize cryptocurrencies as a regulated activity and stablecoins as a means of payment,\u201d said investment fund Ark36 Chief Executive Officer Anto Paroian in an email. \u201cIf the bill is accepted and put into law, this could propel the cryptocurrency industry as a whole into a more mature and respected position within the global financial landscape while putting Britain on the map as a potential global hub for crypto.\u201d\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap rose 3.70% to US$1.11 trillion in the last 24 hours, while crypto trading volume rose 47.78% to US$38.63 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nNFT transactions rise across markets\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index rose 1.34% in the 24 hours to 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong but was still down 1.10% for the week.\n\nNFT transactions on Ethereum dipped 0.81% in the past 24 hours to US$13.84 million, according to CryptoSlam data. Transactions on the Bitcoin, Solana and Polygon blockchains also logged gains for the past 24 hours.\n\nAzuki topped the 24-hour transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, which rose 3.33% to 1.21 million, while Bored Ape Yacht Clubs (BAYC) transactions gained 37.05% to US$1.15 million.\n\n\u201c[The launch of EDX markets and Deutsche Bank applying for digital asset custody service license indicate] the future of crypto is beginning to take shape. This has implications for the NFT markets, though in the short term, not enough to reverse the recent market trends,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\nThe collaboration between Nike\u2019s Web3 platform .SWOOSH and the online video game Fortnite was unveiled on Tuesday. The partnership introduced \u201cAirphoria\u201d, a Nike-themed game world, into Fortnite, where players can play to earn digital sneakers and outfits as in-game accessories. However, the collaboration did not introduce NFTs to Fortnite as some had expected.\n\n\u201cWhile many were hopeful that NFTs would arrive in Fortnite directly, there are some NFT tie-ins, as gamers who link their Nike account to their Fortnite account will receive an NFT that provides access to a future .SWOOSH NFT drop, along with an achievement on Nike\u2019s .SWOOSH platform,\u201d said Petscher.\n\n\u201cA secondary market for these digital collectible shoes still isn\u2019t live, but it\u2019s expected to launch at any time, and we\u2019ll get to see how sales compare to other web2 facing mediums like Reddit Avatars,\u201d Petscher added.\n\nYuga Labs, the developer of BAYC, announced on Wednesday that HV-MTL Forge, a game based on the BAYC-related HV-MTL NFT collection, would be launched on June 29, triggering a surge of HV-MTL transactions, which rose 287.07% in the past 24 hours to US$360,129, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nMeanwhile, in Asia, a group of Rohingya photographers issued an NFT collection \u201cRohingyatographer\u201d on the Ethereum blockchain on Tuesday. The collection features 50 photographs of Rohingya people\u2019s life to commemorate Refugee Week, which will be open for auction on OpenSea from June 20 to June 27.\n\nU.S. futures flat\n\nU.S. stock futures traded flat to lower as of 11:15 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures and the S&P 500 futures both inched 0.01% lower, while Nasdaq futures dipped 0.03%.\n\nThe three major U.S. stock indexes closed lower on Tuesday as investors wait for the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s semi-annual report to the U.S. Congress on Wednesday, which will provide further insights into the Fed\u2019s next move on interest rates.\n\nAlthough the Fed paused the interest rate hikes on June 14, it projects the interest rate to reach 5.6% in 2023, indicating two more rate hikes within the year.\n\nAdding to investors\u2019 caution, the U.S. transportation giant FedEx Corp. provided a worse-than-expected outlook in its fourth quarter report released Tuesday, citing \u201ccontinued demand weakness,\u201d according to Bloomberg.\n\nOn the economic data front, the U.S. housing starts \u2014 which measures new home constructions \u2014 reached 1.63 million in May, an increase of over 20% from April, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The data is well beyond the analysts\u2019 expectation of a 0.1% decrease, according to CNN on Tuesday, and points to strong demand in the U.S. housing market.\n\nU.S. interest rates are now between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The Federal Reserve\u2019s next meeting on rates is July 26. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 23.1% chance the Fed will keep rates unchanged in July, and a 76.9% chance for another 25-basis-point rate hike, up from 74.4% on Tuesday.\n\n(Updates with NFT and Equities section.)"

        "title": "US Government Uses Coinbase to Sell Confiscated Bitcoin Despite SEC Charges Against the Exchange - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nSEC used Coinbase to sell seized cryptocurrency worth millions of Dollars\n\nSEC files a lawsuit against Coinbase for operating illegally as an unregistered trader\n\nCoinbase\u2019s IPO was approved by the SEC in 2021\n\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong holds a strong stance in favor of legal crypto trading\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a lawsuit against Coinbase, a major crypto trading platform, claiming an unregistered trader while listing registered securities, weeks after the second anniversary of Coinbase\u2019s IPO being accepted by the SEC. Just two months prior, the US government used Coinbase to sell seized cryptocurrency tokens.\n\nSEC Vs Coinbase\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission, chaired by Gary Gensler filed a lawsuit against Coinbase, pivoting their case on what is considered a security and what is not. SEC\u2019s case against Coinbase states that the crypto trader is operating unlawfully while trading in registered securities. This raises a legal paradox as the SEC, back in 2021, had approved the crypto trader\u2019s IPO (COIN). Now, two years later, the SEC attempts to flag the trading platform as unlawful while it struggles to define whether cryptocurrencies are considered securities.\n\nIn a tweet by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, he addresses the lawsuit by mentioning that \u201cThe SEC reviewed our business and allowed us to become a public company in 2021.\u201d He also added that \u201cThe SEC and CFTC have made conflicting statements, and don\u2019t even agree on what is a security and what is a commodity.\u201d\n\nRegarding the SEC complaint against us today, we\u2019re proud to represent the industry in court to finally get some clarity around crypto rules. Remember:\n\n1. The SEC reviewed our business and allowed us to become a public company in 2021.\n\n2. There is no path to \u201ccome in and\u2026 \u2014 Brian Armstrong \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f (@brian_armstrong) June 6, 2023\n\nA Friend In Need\n\nAdding to the mystery of the case is the fact that the US government had actually used Coinbase as a platform to sell off cryptocurrency tokens it had seized during a bust. The sale of sold 9,861.17 Bitcoin (BTC) took place on March 14th, 2023, and amounted to $216 million. These tokens were part of 50,000 bitcoins that were seized in what is known as the Silk Road bust. Silk Road was a black market that facilitated the sale of illegal substances over the internet using Bitcoin.\n\nThe listing, at the time, struck fear in the hearts of many crypto investors as they saw it as an omen that might lead to a drop in the value of Bitcoin. However, Bitcoin maintained its value and continued to rise. The government, in its filing, also mentioned that the remainder of the seized Bitcoin will be liquidated over time through public listings.\n\nConsidering that the US government has already utilized Coinbase as a trustworthy platform to sell cryptocurrencies for profit, it poses a dilemma when it comes to identifying the crypto trader as an illegal operator, questioning its own course of action.\n\nFriendly Fire\n\nSEC\u2019s motion to sue Coinbase has not been popular among other governmental entities, unlike the case with Binance\u2019s lawsuits. In the SEC vs Binance case, there has been no governmental pushback against addressing the alleged issue of commingling customer funds and defrauding US regulators. However, when it comes to Coinbase\u2019s case, members of the US Congress have expressed their dismay at the SEC\u2019s decision to sue Coinbase, claiming an unregistered trader 2 years after approving their IPO themselves.\n\nUS Senator Bill Hagerty tweeted \u201cThe SEC is weaponizing their role to kill an industry. Allowing a company to list publicly and then stonewalling their attempts to register is indefensible.\u201d\n\nThe @SECGov is weaponizing their role to kill an industry. Allowing a company to list publicly and then stonewalling their attempts to register is indefensible. @GaryGensler , expect to hear from Congress.https://t.co/GdprSW1Yns \u2014 Senator Bill Hagerty (@SenatorHagerty) June 6, 2023\n\nIn a tweet by US Senator Cynthia Lummis, she stated that \u201cThe SEC has failed to provide a path for digital asset exchanges to register, and even worse has failed to provide adequate legal guidance on what differentiates a security from a commodity\u201d.\n\nMy statement on the SEC suing Coinbase, inc. https://t.co/5KNEM0IPSV pic.twitter.com/EgRIxrIcjj \u2014 Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) June 6, 2023\n\nCoinbase CEO Armstrong chooses to separate his company\u2019s case from other battles SEC wages against crypto trading platforms such as Binance by stating that \u201cthe Coinbase suit is very different from others out there \u2013 the complaint filed against us is exclusively focused on what is or is not a security. And we are confident in our facts and the law.\u201d"

        "content": "Among the more memorable displays at Bitcoin 2023 is a real-life toilet with the logos of various non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies. It\u2019s an ad for a booth selling \u201cbuttwipes\u201d that are \u201cmoistened with the tears of no-coiners.\u201d The marketing message is clear: Bitcoin is the real thing \u2014 everything else is a shitcoin that belongs in the toilet.\n\nBut only a few steps away is another booth selling trading solutions for BRC-20 tokens, which some have labeled shitcoins for Bitcoin. Across the walkway are more booths slinging NFT minting software \u2014 also on Bitcoin. The conference even hosts a Bitcoin NFT art gallery.\n\nAs Miami hosts the largest Bitcoin conference for the third year in a row in May, the air feels markedly different. Though there are only 15,000 attendees compared to last year\u2019s 35,000, the atmosphere has an energy and freshness that\u2019s a world away from the gloom and bear-market blues that one might expect after the massive drops from the 2021 highs.\n\nBitcoin is the real thing \u2014 everything else belongs in the toilet (Elias Ahonen)\n\nWhat\u2019s changed this year is the ordinal renaissance, brought on by the recent reality of not only NFTs but tokens being issued on the Bitcoin blockchain. There are certainly haters \u2014 with some calling for a fork to undo the Taproot updates that made \u201cspam\u201d possible on the chain.\n\nBut despite the Bitcoin community\u2019s traditional hatred for NFTs, tokens and DeFi, however, things are surprisingly quiet. Despite the blowback online, almost no one Magazine encounters at Bitcoin 2023 has anything particularly bad to say about Ordinals \u2014 and some did not even realize they are related to Bitcoin.\n\nAmong old-school Bitcoiners \u2014 in circles where the cryptocurrency that starts with \u201cE\u201d can barely be mentioned without drawing comments of derision regarding \u201cmonkey pictures\u201d and scam coins \u2014 the Ordinal NFT phenomenon is decisively met with a quiet acceptance or shrug. Most old-timers aren\u2019t interested but appear to accept that this is what the \u201cyoung people\u201d want today \u2014 that Bitcoin needs to change with the times.\n\nAre Bitcoiners quietly accepting a new era where the network takes on a radically new role in the Web3 ecosystem, or is this the calm before the Bitcoin purist storm?\n\nBitcoin Ordinals: A new era\n\nWith the exception of the Lightning Network, which made fast and cheap Bitcoin payments possible so as to make mass payment feasible, the Bitcoin ecosystem has been relatively unchanging over the years from an outside perspective.\n\nMining, halvings every four years, the 21 million supply, hardware storage \u2014 beyond these core concepts, Bitcoin has lacked a certain dynamism that has placed it largely outside of the more colorful Web3 space of competing protocols, smart contracts, ICOs, NFTs, DAOs, stablecoins and myriad different tokens.\n\nIndeed, the Bitcoin community has so ardently held on to its core tenets \u2014 rejecting new iterations, interpretations and innovations \u2014 that it is unironically considered by some as a religion, and semi-ironically as such by multitudes more.\n\nBut is a reformation \u2014 or even renaissance \u2014 in the works?\n\nAuthor Elias Ahonen at Bitcoin 2023 (Elias Ahonen)\n\nA stroll through Bitcoin 2023 \u2014 the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin conference held in May in Miami \u2014 suggests so. This is because in addition to the yearly fare of booths related to mining, physical art, exchanges, wallet solutions and various hardware, a new entrant is out in force: NFTs.\n\nWell, no \u2014 not NFTs. Bitcoiners call them \u201cOrdinals.\u201d\n\nThe word \u201cordinal\u201d simply means a number used to put things in order: 5th, 6th, 7th, etc. Due to the November 2021 Taproot Bitcoin upgrade, individual satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin, can now be individually numbered and thus made permanently identifiable.\n\nUniquely numbered satoshis \u2014 Ordinals \u2014 are nonfungible, meaning that they can no longer be substituted for another. Being (1) nonfungible and (2) tokens, they are NFTs by definition.\n\nIn Miami, perhaps the most visible landmark to this new phenomenon is Ordinal Alley, \u201cthe very first art gallery dedicated to Ordinal inscriptions\u201d where various Bitcoin NFTs can be viewed.\n\nSubhan Syed, co-founder of YourFund Coin, tells Magazine that \u201cOrdinal art \u2014 whether a JPEG or MP3 \u2014 may seem irrelevant today, but as time goes on, collectors will look towards unique pieces that have truly been immortalized on the blockchain.\u201d\n\nThe system is new and experimental, with Syed explaining that \u201cthe way inscription works today might be completely different a few years from now,\u201d adding that it\u2019s feasible that one day, there might not be enough satoshis to fill everyone\u2019s inscribing needs.\n\n\u201cWe might need a more robust solution in the long term that does not carry a load on the blockchain timestamp.\u201d\n\nNFTs and shitcoins \u2014 Now on BTC\n\nIn March 2023, an anonymous developer named \u201cdomo\u201d introduced the BRC-20 system, which uses Ordinals to enable users to mint and transfer tokens on Bitcoin, in a simplistic take on Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 standard.\n\nThere were plenty of merchants at Bitcoin 2023 (Elias Ahonen)\n\nAccording to BRC-20.io, at one point, the market cap exceeded $1 billion, although after the initial hype died down, the 187 tracked tokens fell to half a billion, and in the midst of the SEC-derived bear market, they\u2019re worth around $132 million with a daily volume around $47 million (although the site is offline at the time of writing).\n\nWhile the conference has several booths related to Ordinals \u2014 mainly services for minting or \u201cinscribing\u201d them \u2014 few openly promote BRC-20 tokens beyond offering functionality to hold or trade them. While Ordinal NFT images appear to have become accepted by the mainstream Bitcoin community, it appears that BRC-20 tokens \u2014 viewed by many as shitcoins on Bitcoin \u2014 have not yet received quite the same level of acceptance.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how this changes next year when the conference moves to Nashville.\n\nWizards vs. laser-eyes\n\nAt a talk titled \u201cThe Great Ordinal Debate,\u201d Bitcoin experts Udi Wertheimer and Eric Wall appeared in Taproot Wizard costumes as they made a dancing entrance. The Ordinals project celebrates the Magic Internet Money meme from the early Bitcoin days and welcomes the return of innovations being built on top of the protocol.\n\nThe Magic Internet Money meme\n\nCertain Bitcoin maximalists hate them and the \u201cspam\u201d of Ordinals, believing it undermines the true purpose of Bitcoin.\n\nWertheimer reported that \u201cfriends reached out and implored me to reconsider going to Bitcoin Miami, due to many public violent threats\u201d from \u201claser eye podcasters\u201d who believe NFTs have no place in the Bitcoin community.\n\nThe rift that Ordinals has caused in the Bitcoin community may well be summed as a conflict between the wizards and the laser-eyes \u2014 the former representing the experimental and fun-loving early ethos of Bitcoin, while the latter conveys intensity, seriousness and an unyielding focus on their vision for the greatest form of money known to man.\n\nEric Wall is a professional crypto investor (Twitter)\n\nAfter the conference, I connect with Logan Golema, who is firmly on the wizard side and has deployed a BRC-20 token for his project Galaxer, which is building a \u201cspace-based AR capture-the-flag\u201d game to work on Apple\u2019s Vision Pro artificial reality goggles.\n\nBelieving that Bitcoin and its Ordinals will exist \u201cfor eons\u201d into humanity\u2019s future, he argues that \u201cOrdinals \u2014 whether art or money \u2014 will be important much further into the future than the deployer today may intend.\u201d\n\nIf you could take the DeLorean back in time to buy cheap Bitcoin \u2014 or prevent the Taproot upgrade \u2014 would you? (Elias Ahonen)\n\nWhile some in the laser-eyes camp have raised the possibility of a fork to roll back the Taproot upgrade that enables Ordinals, Golema thinks it\u2019s unlikely. Recalling the block-size wars that were a key driver in the Bitcoin Cash fork led by \u201cBitcoin Jesus\u201d Roger Ver, Golema explains that while disagreement certainly exists, \u201cit would take a lot for a chain fork to happen\u201d again.\n\nAlthough various ways to remove what some core developers consider \u201cspam\u201d have been discussed, Golema believes the innovations will be broadly accepted and integrated \u2014 even if only begrudgingly because doing away with them may bring even more trouble.\n\nBut Ordinals come with benefits, too, says Golema, helping to ensure Bitcoin\u2019s transaction fees can sustain the network after the block reward halves away to nothing in the future.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen for one of the first times that the fee reward was bigger than the block reward \u2014 that\u2019s very important for the future of Bitcoin\u2019s security.\u201d\n\nFor Bitcoin miners, the new age means more BTC coming into their collective coffers because the minting, deploying and transfer of Ordinals and Bitcoin-based tokens all require paying miners fees. This could help solve the issue of what happens when there\u2019s no more BTC left to mine. \u201cDirect mining rewards will end in the year 2140, so fees will be all that\u2019s left to incentivize miners,\u201d Golema notes.\n\nSimilar benefits may exist for BTC hodlers \u2014 the long-term Bitcoin faithful. It is easy to imagine that as Bitcoin gains Ethereum-like capabilities, it will gain market share in NFTs and tokens, which will translate to demand not only in absolute terms but relative to competitors.\n\nPerhaps by bringing NFTs and tokens to Bitcoin, the wizards can even prevent the flippening, the potential ascent of Etereum to the top market cap position, which until now has been theorized to happen one day as a result of Bitcoin falling behind technologically while Ethereum innovates.\n\nMajor crypto assets by percentage of total market cap. (CMC)\n\nBitcoin dominance is a metric that shows the relative values of various cryptocurrencies and is followed by many Bitcoiners. Starting the year at 40%, BTC has climbed to 48.1% of the market as of writing. Can JPEGs push Bitcoin back into the 60% range and herald a new bull market?\n\nThe Ordinals wizards\n\nSome Bitcoiners are starting to rationalize Ordinals into their worldviews.\n\nAccording to Aravind Sathyanandham, chief strategy officer at Bitcoin DeFi platform Velar, the Ordinals community is markedly different from the primarily Ethereum \u201cape\u201d community, which has a bad reputation among the Bitcoin crowd.\n\n\u201cThese are Bitcoin guys \u2014 these are people who had to figure out how to run an entire node to \u2018inscribe\u2019 stuff on Bitcoin, the mother chain.\u201d\n\nHe is referring to a kind of do-it-yourself hardiness \u2014 a rugged individualism emblematic of the money and tech conservatism of older stereotypical Bitcoiners as opposed to the also -stereotypical imagining of a more communal, liberal and younger Ethereum community.\n\n\n\nFrom this Bitcoiner perspective, Ethereum is viewed as little more than a sandbox for children, while Bitcoin is eternal. Ethereum, Sathyanandham says, is a \u201cgreat experiment for NFTs and DeFi to take their first form,\u201d and now it\u2019s Bitcoin\u2019s turn.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese Bitcoin wizards understood early on that the block space on Bitcoin is prime real estate \u2014 it\u2019s forever immutable and censorship-resistant data,\u201d he adds, not forgetting to add that Ethereum is \u201csemi-centralized.\u201d\n\nElias was invited to sign the Bitcoin Car, first auctioned for 1,000 BTC in 2013 (Elias Ahonen)\n\nThe phenomenon also appears to be growing the Bitcoin user base.\n\n\u201cOrdinals have on-boarded so many individuals onto Bitcoin \u2014 new Bitcoin wallets like Hiro and Xverse that are akin to MetaMask have made it simple,\u201d Sathyanandham explains, referring to the wider ecosystem being built entirely for Ordinals that mirrors Ethereum\u2019s in many ways. He notes that \u201cthe Ethereum NFT community\u2019s bleeding into the Bitcoin community is very evident on Crypto Twitter.\u201d\n\nWhile Syed agrees with Ordinalist exceptionalism, he sees them more as technologists than strict Bitcoiners. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that BRC-20 and Ordinals early adopters are individuals who are slightly more tech-savvy digital collectible fans \u2014 it\u2019s not like some virtual flood gates opened up to bring in loads of Bitcoin maxis,\u201d he observes.\n\nSyed notes that \u201ccurrently it\u2019s the same people who collect ETH, Solana or BNB digital collectibles jumping in early. Early adopters always win and the bottom line is: We are all early.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the next bull run comes, perhaps correlated with the BTC halving, we might see everyone rush over the BRC-20 and Ordinal narrative.\u201d\n\nIt certainly feels like magic internet money once again."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nLaunched in 2009, Bitcoin is the first and remains the most successful blockchain-based cryptocurrency globally.\n\nThe creator of Bitcoin under the alias Satoshi Nakamoto is thought to be the largest Bitcoin holder.\n\nThe Winklevoss twins, institutional investors like MicroStrategy, and governments like the United States and China are just a few examples of other well-known Bitcoin millionaires.\n\nAs of June 6, 2023, Bitcoin (BTC) had a market capitalization of $498,85 billion, making it the largest cryptocurrency but who are the biggest Bitcoin holders and how much are they worth \u2013 was always interesting to the public.\n\nAt the height of the crypto boom in April 2021, there were more than 1.3 million active BTC-holding addresses, up from around 1,000 in July 2010. By 14 March 2023, there were more than one million BTC holders. However, it\u2019s not only individuals who are hoarding Bitcoin for their private reserves.\n\nFor a long time, the notion that publicly traded firms would purchase Bitcoin for their reserves was ridiculed. The most popular cryptocurrency was viewed as being too unstable and fringe for any major firm to use.\n\nThe purchase of Bitcoin over the past two years by a number of significant institutional investors has effectively ended that taboo.\n\nSince 2009, Bitcoin\u2019s meteoric rise has produced a surprise and diverse group of millionaires (and billionaires). Who, however, are the biggest Bitcoin holders? Since wallet addresses are anonymous in the sense that they are not linked to the name of the account owner, it is difficult to say with certainty who has the most Bitcoin. The only way to know is if the owner has made their assets known.\n\nIndividuals With the Largest Bitcoin Holdings (in no particular order):\n\nWinklevoss twins\n\nCameron and Tyler Winklevoss, also known as the Winklevoss twins, co-founded Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange back in 2014. The exchange currently handles roughly $40 million in trades each day.\n\nTyler, who works as Gemini\u2019s CEO, and Cameron, who works as its president, are famous for claiming that Mark Zuckerberg had stolen their concept for a social network.\n\nThey started hoarding Bitcoin using a portion of the $65 million court settlement they had with the Facebook CEO. Back in 2013, the twins stated that they had purchased 1% of the whole Bitcoin supply. The failure of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange in November 2022, however, caused the Winklevoss twins to lose more than 60% of their Bitcoin wealth.\n\nMichael Saylor\n\nMichael Saylor is the founder of business analytics software company MicroStrategy, and has served as its CEO until early August 2022 before becoming its chairman. Saylor, one of the most well-known Internet bubble executives, became a multibillionaire in the late 1990s as a result of his ownership of MicroStrategy. The SEC then filed accounting allegations against Saylor\u2019s company, and fined it with $11 million in penalties. The company\u2019s stock value crashed as a result of reissuing the accurate financial data, and Saylor\u2019s net worth decreased by $6 billion.\n\n\n\nSaylor is a huge Bitcoin advocate calling it \u201ca bank in cyberspace, run by incorruptible software, offering a global, affordable, simple, & secure savings account to billions of people that don\u2019t have the option or desire to run their own hedge fund.\u201d Recently he has become one of the few Bitcoin maximalists to publicly embrace Ordinals. Both, Saylor and MicroStrategy are huge Bitcoin investors.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto is the name of the person or organization who was credited with creating Bitcoin. The whole creator\u2019s history is obscured by mystery as his identity has never been made public. However, information on a profile with The P2P Foundation indicates that they turned 48 on April 5.\n\n\n\nBefore the first Bitcoin was mined, Satoshi Nakamoto posted a white paper titled \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\u201d to a cryptography mailing group. The article, which was released on October 31, 2008, described a decentralized peer-to-peer protocol that was secure in terms of cryptography. Satoshi Nakamoto, referred to Bitcoin as a \u201cpurely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash\u201d that \u201cwould allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution or any intermediary.\u201d He is said to be the largest individual Bitcoin holder and was purportedly the first miner of the currency.\n\nTim Draper\n\nAmerican venture capitalist and founder of many companies under his name, Timothy Cook Draper, is known as a huge Bitcoin proponent. His most well-known investments are in FinTech firms like Twitter, DocuSign, Coinbase, Robinhood, Tesla, Hotmail, Skype, etc. He paid $18.7 million, or approximately $632 per coin, in 2014 to purchase 29,656 Bitcoins that U.S. Marshals had seized from the shuttered Silk Road black market. Draper supports decentralization and is against Government control.\n\n\n\nPublicly Traded Companies With the Largest Bitcoin Holdings (in no particular order):\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nAmerican multinational automotive and clean energy company Tesla , headed by multibillionaire Elon Musk, bought its first batch of Bitcoin back in February 2021. The company explained it bought the Bitcoin for \u201cmore flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on cash.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfterward, Tesla started accepting payments in Bitcoin in exchange for its products, becoming the first major automaker to do so. Nowadays, Tesla is investing in other cryptocurrencies as well, including Dogecoin.\n\nMicroStrategy (MSTR)\n\nIn August 2020, MicroStrategy purchased its first batch of Bitcoin, citing concerns that the epidemic, global financial stimulus programs, and political unpredictability would cause the U.S. currency to depreciate. In a statement , CEO Michael Saylor then said, \u201cThis investment reflects our belief that Bitcoin, as the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency, is a dependable store of value and an attractive investment asset with more long-term appreciation potential than holding cash.\u201d\n\n\n\nHut 8 Mining Corp (HUT)\n\nAn infrastructure firm for mining digital assets, Hut 8 Mining Corp (HUT) is situated in North America. The business runs cloud and colocation data center facilities in Canada and caters to business clients looking for computing services. Hut 8 Mining announced in February 2023 that it would join forces with US Bitcoin to become Hut 8 Corp., also known as \u201cNew Hut.\u201d Following the acquisition, six facilities totaling about 825 megawatts will purportedly be available to the New Hut company for use in crypto mining and other operations. One of the biggest Bitcoin holders will have a self-mining capability of 5.6 exahashes per second (EH/s), and, therefore, encompass five sites in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, New York, and Texas.\n\n\n\nPrivate Companies With the Largest Bitcoin Holdings (in no particular order):\n\nBlock.one\n\nBlock.one is a software company that focuses on high-performance blockchain solutions. Following its launch in May 2017, its flagship project, EOSIO, an open-source blockchain technology created to facilitate secure data transfer and high-performance decentralized apps, has gained acclaim as the first effective blockchain platform for developers.\n\n\n\nIn 2018, Block.one carried out an ICO for EOS, its native cryptocurrency token, and raised a record of $4 billion.\n\nThe Tezos Foundation\n\nThe Tezos Foundation is a nonprofit organization that supports the growth and promotion of the Tezos (XTZ) blockchain network. It was established in 2018. The foundation, among other things, is in charge of managing and allocating the money acquired during the ICO to help the Tezos ecosystem continue to grow and be sustainable.\n\n\n\nIts CFO, Roman Schnider is a huge Bitcoin proponent and considers Bitcoin to be a \u201ckey store of value.\u201d\n\nTether Holdings\n\nTether Holdings has a tight connection to the development and administration of the Tether (USDT) stablecoin. Tether Holdings conducts business by creating and administering Tether tokens that are based on several blockchain technologies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others. One U.S. dollar is supposed to be represented by each Tether token.\n\n\n\nCountries With the Largest Bitcoin Holdings (in no particular order):\n\nUkraine\n\nThe amount of Bitcoin managed by the Ukrainian government has been collected mostly from donations from individuals and companies. The nation has benefited greatly from financial assistance in the form of cryptocurrencies throughout the conflict with Russia that began last year. Ukraine was quite open to the blockchain industry even before the war, establishing helpful crypto rules and making it simpler for crypto companies to conduct business there and, therefore is one of the biggest Bitcoin holders among countries.\n\n\n\nThe United States\n\nThe United States is the largest holder of Bitcoin among countries. Most of its Bitcoin holdings was seized in three cases \u2013 Silk Road, Bitfinex, and the seizure of James Zhong\u2019s BTC. Bitcoin has been seized by numerous government organizations throughout the years. For the whole Bitcoin ecosystem, the lack of traceability for the government\u2019s cache of bitcoins has major ramifications because it makes it challenging to determine and establish ownership of the cryptocurrency, which is predicated on principles of transparency.\n\n\n\nEl Salvador\n\nMost people are probably most familiar with El Salvador as a Bitcoin-owning nation. The nation of Central America, however, went above and above by adopting Bitcoin as legal cash in 2021, making it the first nation in the world to do so.\n\nWho Is the Biggest Bitcoin Holder?\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto \u2013 1 million BTC\n\nBy being the first miner to produce blocks of transactions, Satoshi Nakamoto not only invented but also launched Bitcoin. On January 3rd 2009, Satoshi is thought to have mined over 22,000 blocks and earned a total of over one million Bitcoin in block rewards. As a result, Satoshi is thought to be the owner of the largest Bitcoin cache , which currently stands at more than 1 million BTC, or almost $23 billion making him one of the biggest Bitcoin holders. This Bitcoin is dispersed among 22,000 addresses rather than being kept in a single address. With the exception of a few test transactions, none of it was ever used. Since his departure from the project in 2010, Satoshi has gone silent.\n\nHowever, a year ago, over 100 BTC were moved from two dormant Bitcoin wallets from Satoshi era. Because the account had previously been dormant for more than ten years, it has stirred up controversy in the cryptocurrency world. Both addresses have earned 50 BTC for mining blocks back in June 2010. For several years, there was essentially no activity. There were two microtransactions that entered the wallet in the previous six months for the modest amount of 0.00000547 BTC. Due to the combination of two mining address outputs, it is believed that the coins that were moved belonged to the same owner just might be Satoshi himself.\n\nThe other 9 Biggest Bitcoin holders in order are:\n\nUnited States 205,515 BTC $5,566,414,878 Government Block.one 164,000 BTC $4,445,941,600 Private Company Microstrategy 140,000 BTC $3,795,316,000 Public Company Winklevoss Twins 70,000 BTC $1,897,658,000 Individual Tether Holdings 52,673 BTC $1,427,933,426 Private Company Ukraine 46,351 BTC $1,256,547,799 Government Tim Draper 29,656 BTC $803,956,366 Individual The Tezos Foundation 24,808 BTC $672,529,995 Private Company Michael Saylor 17,732 BTC $480,703,881 Individual\n\nWho is the largest Individual Bitcoin investor?\n\nMichael Saylor (MicroStrategy) \u2013 ~ $481 million\n\nOver time, Bitcoin has drawn a large number of unusual investors. But nobody embodies fire and enthusiasm like MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR) CEO Michael Saylor who is definitely one of the biggest Bitcoin holders.\n\nBy purchasing $250 million worth of Bitcoin in August 2020, the company started accumulating cryptocurrencies. The company claimed at the time that it was purchasing the cryptocurrency in order to make better use of the cash it had on hand.\n\nSaylor has grown to be a fervent proponent of Bitcoin over time and has spoken at conferences for news and cryptocurrencies to promote its advantages and applications. MicroStrategy boosted its Bitcoin holdings to $3.5 billion by December 2021, jumping in to purchase the digital currency as its price fell.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of Bitcoin, MicroStrategy\u2019s stock price soared by more than 337% (as of December 2021). As a result of his wager on Bitcoin, Forbes pegged Saylor\u2019s net worth at $1.6 billion. Microstrategy bought 2,500 more Bitcoins in December 2022, increasing its holdings once more. Microstrategy had roughly 132,500 Bitcoin, or about $3.2 billion, as of February 2023.\n\nAccording to the latest data, MicroStrategy sits on a $3.8 billion BTC stash while Saylor holds $480 million worth of BTC in a personal capacity.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe number of people generating billions off the new asset class surged as cryptocurrency gained popularity. Cryptocurrency millionaires are a diverse group; some have made their billions by offering goods and services to the developing ecosystem, while others have done so by profiting from the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. It should be noted that the BTC is distributed more evenly than other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Economic Research , the Bitcoin ecosystem \u201cis still dominated by large and concentrated players, be they large miners, bitcoin holders, or exchanges,\u201d The majority of the profits from increased adoption are expected to fall disproportionately to a small number of players because of bitcoin\u2019s intrinsic concentration, which makes it prone to systemic risk. Keep in mind that there is a risk of loss in every trading. Before trading, always do your own research, taking a look at the most recent news, fundamental and technical analysis, and analyst opinion."

        "title": "Bitcoin gains to hold above US$30,000; Ether little changed with top 10 crypto mixed - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin rose and held above US$30,000 in Friday morning trading in Asia, holding onto the strong gains made this week on the back of growing institutional interest in the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Ether was little changed. Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed, with Cardano\u2019s ADA token gaining and Binance\u2019s BNB losing ground. Overall, most tokens were holding weekly gains spurred by Bitcoin\u2019s rally.\n\nCrypto\n\nBitcoin rose 0.33% over the last 24 hours to US$30,056.27 at 6:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, up 17.52% for the past week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency broke through resistance at US$30,000 early morning on Thursday for the first time since April, reaching a high of US$30,737.33.\n\nEther was little changed, rising 0.02% to US$1,879.66 to gain 12.87% for the week.\n\nBlackRock Inc.,the world\u2019s largest asset manager with US$8.59 trillion under management at the end of 2022, filed an application on June 15 for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Two more U.S.-based asset managers \u2014 WisdomTree and Invesco \u2014 also filed Bitcoin ETF applications this week.\n\n\u201cMajor cryptocurrencies were seeing strong performances this week \u2014 Traders reacted positively to the possibility of seeing a Bitcoin ETF come to market,\u201d Denys Peleshok, head of Asia at Belize-based financial brokerage CPT Markets, in email comments.\n\n\u201cA successful launch of a bitcoin ETF could open the way for more inflows from individuals and professional investors alike,\u201d Peleshok added. \u201cThe investment vehicle could lower the barrier of entry into the market and attract significant volumes of investment into bitcoin in particular.\u201d\n\nBoston-based Fidelity Investments, another major financial services company that managed US$4.2 trillion as of the first quarter of 2023, is also said to be preparing to file a Bitcoin ETF application.\n\nIn another encouraging move for institutional adoption of crypto, EDX Markets opened for business on Tuesday as a New Jersey-based digital asset exchange backed by Wall Street firms such as Citadel Securities, Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab Corp. EDX said U.S. regulatory compliance is a core feature of its operations.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese moves by traditional finance follow the crackdown on the U.S. crypto sector this month by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which filed lawsuits against the Binance.US and Coinbase exchanges. The SEC alleges they illegally traded cryptocurrencies that should have been registered as financial securities, among other charges.\n\n\u201c[Bitcoin could] continue benefiting from its status as a quasi-commodity when most other digital assets are considered securities by regulators. As a result, Bitcoin could emerge as a winner from the SEC\u2019s legal efforts,\u201d said Peleshok of CPT Markets.\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell commented on Bitcoin during a monetary policy hearing on Capitol Hill this week, describing the token as having \u201cstaying power\u201d as an asset class.\n\nMeanwhile, Mastercard Inc., the world\u2019s second largest payment processor, announced Thursday that it will expand its Engage network to embrace more blockchain and digital asset partners. Mastercard Engage connects businesses with qualified technology partners.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were mixed, although making weekly gains spearheaded by Bitcoin. Binance\u2019s BNB token lost 2.53% to US$242.49 while gaining 2.36% in the past seven days.\n\nCardano\u2019s ADA rose 2.21% to US$0.2922, adding 10.90% in the last week.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market capitalization rose 0.14% to US$1.17 trillion in the last 24 hours, while trading volume fell 25.24% to US$45.06 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nNFT looking up\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.78% to 2,930.17 in the 24 hours to 8:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index gained 1.3% for the week.\n\nTotal NFT transactions rose 0.64% to US$23.9 million, while transactions on Ethereum dipped 3.70% to US$15.56 million. Bitcoin was the second largest blockchain by NFT transactions, rising 8.56% to US$2.74 million.\n\nYuga Labs\u2019 Bored and Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFTs were the top selling collections in the last 24 hours. Bored Ape trades rose 1.12% to US$3.07 million, while Mutant Ape surged 23.92% to US$1.05 million.\n\n\u201cNFT traders are optimistic about the future, and clearly willing to spend as we see from multiple $145k Bored Ape Yacht Club sales, along with a $286k sale, but still the index is just above its all-time low point,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\nThat indicates investors remain hesitant as a whole, apart from some whales, said Petscher, adding that may be because of a lack of a track record for some projects holding value over time.\n\nThe Gods Unchained Cards NFT collection from ImmutableX was the third most traded collection, even as transactions fell 8.75% to US$754,805. Immutable announced Wednesday that its NFT trading card game Gods Unchained is now listed on game distribution platform Epic Games Store, which has over 230 million customers.\n\n\u201cLots of eyes on Azuki tomorrow as they have a big event in Las Vegas,\u201d Petscher said. Azuki, the Japanese anime-inspired NFT collection of 10,000 generative avatars, became one of the most popular collections since its debut in January 2022 and still holds an active community.\n\nAzuki is the eighth most traded collection according to Cryptoslam data, with US$537,366 worth of transactions over the past day. \u201cWe\u2019re watching to see what big announcements they may have \u2013 a new token, or possibly a game? Azuki has a track record of delivering on hype,\u201d Petscher said.\n\nElsewhere, Swiss-based multinational food manufacturer Nestl\u00e9 S.A. and U.S.-based snack brand Slim Jim both announced the launch of NFT collections, signaling continued mainstream interest in the blockchain-powered technology.\n\nEquity futures edge down\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell | Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded lower as of 9:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, following a mixed regular trading session on Thursday.\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average futures slipped 0.06%, S&P 500 futures lost 0.11%, while Nasdaq futures inched down 0.084%.\n\nTech stocks gained in the Thursday session performed well with Apple Inc. setting a new record high of US$187, while Amazon.com Inc. and Tesla Inc. also rising.\n\nOn the U.S. battlefront against inflation, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told the U.S. Congress on Tuesday and Thursday this week that the central bank is in consensus that more interest rate increases are likely this year to control high price pressure. The U.S. inflation rate is currently at around 4.05%, down from last month\u2019s 4.93% but still far from Fed\u2019s target of 2%.\n\nU.S. interest rates are now between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The Fed paused rate hikes at the last meeting on June 14, but indicated two more hikes this year to bring rates to around 5.6%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s next meeting on interest rates is July 26 and the majority view is they will raise. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 76.9% chance for another 25-basis-point rate hike, up from 71.9% on Thursday, and a 23.1% chance the Fed will leave rates unchanged.\n\n(Updates to add equities section)"

        "title": "Bitcoin and correlations \u2014 Examining the relationship between BTC, gold and the Nasdaq - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Some news sources have been fond of comparing Bitcoin (BTC) price action and other assets. In particular, the two most commonly compared asset classes are gold and tech stocks.\n\nWhile a correlation holds, it tends to be a big news story. Throughout much of 2022 and early 2023, for example, the \u201cBitcoin trades in tandem with tech stocks\u201d narrative was prevalent. Since that correlation has broken down, however, there doesn\u2019t seem to be much related news coverage.\n\nNow a new narrative has taken the spotlight: Bitcoin\u2019s correlation to gold. Ever since the failures of Silvergate Bank, Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank in March, both assets have rallied. Both narratives make sense on the surface. If Bitcoin is to be seen as a speculative asset, then it might trade similarly to a tech stock. And if Bitcoin is more of a safe-haven asset, a correlation to gold seems reasonable.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that correlations can come and go. Just because two assets share a correlation for a time doesn\u2019t always mean they share a place in the market long-term. And when zooming out to larger timeframes, it might be possible to rule out correlations.\n\nLet\u2019s examine both of these correlations on a one-year basis and see if they have any merit.\n\nBitcoin, gold and NASDAQ: one-year correlation analysis\n\nYear-to-date, Bitcoin has gained roughly 58%, rising from $16,600 at the start of the year to over $26,000 at the time of writing. In the same timeframe, the Nasdaq has gained about 36%, rising from 11,000 to just shy of over 15,000.\n\nMeanwhile, gold has risen by just over 7% year-to-date.\n\nYear-to-date chart of BTC/USD, Nasdaq and gold with 90-day correlation coefficient. Source: TradingView\n\nAccording to the 90-day correlation coefficient, BTC is presently positively correlated to gold (0.58) and negatively correlated to tech stocks (-0.65). For most of this year, BTC has been highly correlated to both assets. At the beginning of the year, the correlation to gold was deeply negative, while the correlation to tech stocks was just below neutral.\n\nSo then, which is it? Safe-haven correlation or risk asset correlation? Or does the presence of multiple correlations point to no correlation at all? Does similar price action on a yearly basis constitute a significant relationship between two assets in the first place?\n\nSuch a discussion could get quite lengthy. These questions are best interpreted on a rhetorical basis, i.e., they imply that there could be any number of assets that share similar patterns of price action on a one-year chart.\n\nWhen looking at the question in terms of percentage gains, things look more different still: gold is up 9%, while Bitcoin is up 18% and the Nasdaq is up 30%.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning the significance of the fact that Bitcoin tends to be correlated with equities for a time now and then. But so far this year, the relationship between the two remained constant throughout the banking crisis that began in March and led to an extensive rally for BTC. Since then, the relationship has disappeared; the Nasdaq has rallied to year-to-date highs, with BTC mostly trading sideways.\n\nOn a long enough timeline, everything breaks down\n\nOver the past 14 years, Bitcoin has risen against the U.S. dollar by tens of millions of percentage points. Few asset classes can boast similar returns. Other assets don\u2019t carry the same degree of volatility either, making a long-standing correlation even less likely.\n\nAll-time BTC/USD chart. Source: TradingView\n\nTo date, gold has risen from $800 in early 2009 to $1,945 today \u2014 a gain of almost 150%.\n\nAll time gold/USD chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe Nasdaq is up more than 10x since early 2009, with returns in excess of 1,000%. While these are not insignificant gains, they are a far cry from the 52,000,000% that Bitcoin returned from July 2010 to the present.\n\nAll-time chart of Nasdaq. Source: TradingView\n\nIn summary, the key takeaways here are:\n\nAn asset that rises by more than 50,000,000% over the course of its lifetime might not be correlated to much else.\n\nThe correlations between Bitcoin, gold and tech stocks often can\u2019t be seen on timeframes in excess of a year or two.\n\nDue in large part to the previous two points, the correlations don\u2019t hold much significance.\n\nInvestors would do well to keep this in mind when interpreting markets. Banking on any specific correlation as part of a strategy could be risky, as that correlation could break at any moment.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and readers should conduct their own research when making a decision.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "Bitcoin DeFi: A Brief Introduction - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) built on Ethereum and other networks has grown tremendously over the years. However, a new, growing DeFi market has emerged on Bitcoin, powered by numerous second-layer solutions and the recent Taproot update, which has opened the door for more use cases on Bitcoin.\n\nRead on to learn more about Bitcoin DeFi, how it is made possible on Bitcoin, and what Bitcoin DeFi applications already exist.\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin DeFi?\n\nTo understand Bitcoin DeFi, we first need to understand what DeFi is.\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) is a peer-to-peer financial system that eliminates (financial) intermediaries, allowing you to utilize Internet-native financial products and services powered by smart contracts from anywhere in the world. All you need is Internet connectivity and a crypto wallet.\n\nBitcoin DeFi refers to decentralized finance applications and protocols built on Bitcoin, whether on-chain or on second-layer solutions.\n\nWhy Are More DeFi Protocols Being Built on Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is the largest and most secure cryptocurrency network in the world. Moreover, it\u2019s also the most decentralized, providing the ideal infrastructure for decentralized finance that is highly decentralized.\n\nThe downtimes of popular DeFi chains like Solana and even Ethereum highlight the need for DeFi to be built on a robust foundation to fulfill its full potential of providing crypto-native financial services to the world.\n\nThat\u2019s where Bitcoin could come in.\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin DeFi enables the digital currency bitcoin to become a productive asset, allowing BTC holders to earn a yield on their holdings in a decentralized, permissionless manner. Given the large number of BTC holders, there is ample demand for income-generating protocols that allow Bitcoiners to earn a yield on the asset they are HODLing.\n\nHow Is DeFi Made Possible on Bitcoin?\n\nDeFi on Bitcoin is primarily enabled by layer-2 solutions that provide smart contract functionalities to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Listed below are some current solutions set to unlock Bitcoin\u2019s true potential.\n\nLiquid Network\n\nLiquid Network\n\nis a layer-2 sidechain that brings asset issuance to Bitcoin and improves security and scalability on the network. Liquid Network operates on top of Bitcoin but doesn\u2019t alter its base layer, acting independently with its own ledger and consensus mechanism. It increases transaction settlement speed and confidentiality.\n\nMintlayer\n\nMintlayer\n\nis a layer-2 solution built on the Bitcoin network that brings tokenization and value transfer without compromising security. It unlocks opportunities for Bitcoin users to access all types of DeFi applications with real-life value without wrapped tokes or token bridges.\n\nRootstock\n\nRootstock (RSK) is a sidechain that adds smart contract functionality to Bitcoin through the use of a two-way peg, enabling BTC to be turned into rBTC and used in a range of DeFi applications built on RSK.\n\nStacks\n\nStacks\n\nis a layer-2 smart contract platform that enhances the functionality of Bitcoin through contracts and decentralized applications. Stacks may add new functionalities to Bitcoin without compromising security.\n\nTaproot Assets\n\nTaproot Assets\n\nis a layer-3 protocol allowing users to issue fungible and non-fungible digital assets on the Bitcoin blockchain, which can also be transferred over to the Lightning Network.

        "content": "00:00\n\nFirst, our huge vote of confidence. When you look at Black Rock and its ability to try to do this after dozens of companies have come forward and tried to create a Bitcoin ETF with no avail from the S.E.C. in an approval for the process, we know grayscale has sued in this regard, trying to get. Conversion of BTC into an ETF. So what's different when it comes to BlackRock? One thing is a surveillance sharing agreement when it comes to NASDAQ and the ability to really monitor what's going on with this ETF in real time. Another thing that is really interesting is the custodians themselves, because not only do you have Bank of New York Mellon that you're looking at as one of the custodians here when you think about the cash holdings, but Coinbase as well when it comes to the Bitcoin holdings. So you have another vote of confidence, not just in Bitcoin, but in Coinbase. Also, Matt, really, just days after you saw the S.E.C. see Coinbase for another matter when it comes to the crypto world and the listing of certain assets. So this would be large for Bitcoin given how many people are on the sidelines that would want a spot Bitcoin ETF to gain exposure with the confidence of the likes of the NY Mellon and BlackRock behind it. Will the S.E.C. have more faith in a giant like BlackRock when you look at what Bloomberg intelligence is estimating, they expect? Kind of a 50/50 chance of approval by the end of the year and even more so when you think beyond this year alone. And then what would the implications for price prices actually be Chanel? Should we see this happen, which, of course, is no guarantee. Yeah. No guarantee at all given the stance the S.E.C. has had so far when it comes to Bitcoin ETF. But again, BlackRock is another game in town. So do they change the equation here with how many advisor assets are on the sidelines here? You would imagine that it could really encourage a lot more people to get in with a trusted really retirement provider, an ETF provider here like BlackRock. There's a sense that it will encourage more people to come in. But with the uncertainty, you don't see that massive price movement right now. And again, we're still talking about bitcoin here. We're not talking about all these other types of crypto assets that are still out there that are drawing more scrutiny from the S.E.C., of course. And I am sure you'll talk about it a lot. There's ether that there is a large question around as well when the S.E.C. will handle how they treat either and Bitcoin as assets relative to a lot of the other things we're seeing out there."

The original cryptocurrency has gained around 36% since the Chinese government stated it would become worthless in 2022.\n\nAmid the bear market, China attempted to capitalize on a massive market decline, warning crypto investors that Bitcoin prices were \u201cheading to zero.\u201d\n\nIn June 2022, the Chinese national news media agency, Economic Daily, issued a warning about Bitcoin to assure citizens the asset was a worthless \u201cstring of digital codes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the future, once investors\u2019 confidence collapses or when sovereign countries declare Bitcoin illegal, it will return to its original value, which is utterly worthless,\u201d the article read.\n\nWhile it\u2019s yet to be seen whether Bitcoin is heading to zero one day, it has not lost any value since the Chinese government issued the warning. On the contrary, Bitcoin has significantly increased since the article was published.\n\nAccording to data from CoinGecko, Bitcoin traded at around $20,000 when the Economic Daily released the article in June 2022. Twelve months later, at the time of writing, BTC is trading at $28,852, up around 36%.\n\nBitcoin one-year price chart. Source: CoinGecko\n\nDespite posting notable gains, Bitcoin has seen its ups and downs over the past year. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap dropped to as low as $15,700 in November 2022. Then, in April 2023, Bitcoin briefly crossed the $30,000 price mark.\n\nRelated: Hong Kong\u2019s regulatory lead sets it up to be major crypto hub\n\nChina was one of the first countries in the world to take regulatory action against crypto. In 2017, Chinese regulators banned cryptocurrency exchanges from providing services in the country. Despite the ban, Bitcoin continued to hit its all-time highs, surging 1,900% all the way up to $20,000 by the end of 2017.\n\nIn 2021, China\u2019s central bank announced a new ban on crypto, uniting forces with various Chinese authorities to crack down on local crypto activity. Just a few months after the ban was announced, Bitcoin hit its all-time high at around $68,000 in November 2021.\n\nDespite \u201cbanning\u201d crypto in 2021, China has remained the second-largest Bitcoin miner in the world.

        "title": "'Bitcoin-only' buy-and-hold investing outperforms altcoins over long term, analysis shows - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Altcoins offer diverse, innovative features, promising technological advancements and potentially lucrative investment opportunities.\n\nVarious altcoins can post handsome gains that surpass those of Bitcoin (BTC), particularly during times of increased popularity, known as altcoin seasons. However, analysis from K33 Research shows that over the long term, a \u201cBitcoin-only\u201d investment strategy has been more profitable than an altcoin portfolio.\n\nAltcoin portfolio underperformed Bitcoin over the long run\n\nBitcoin has had three consecutive bull and bear market cycles since 2013, with the latest coming in 2021. In each cycle, Bitcoin\u2019s price rose parabolically in a concise span, usually a few months, after surpassing the peak of its previous cycle.\n\nIn 2013, BTC peaked at around $1,175, followed by a downtrend for two years. At the time, the altcoin market was in its nascent stage. The fiat on-ramps to Bitcoin were limited, and exchanges on which investors could convert to altcoins were rare.\n\nHowever, by the end of 2015, a number of altcoins had arrived, including the launch of Ethereum and its native Ether (ETH) coin. A few exchanges had also been formed that supported the conversion of Bitcoin to other cryptocurrencies, paving the way for an altcoin market.\n\nIt was not until April 2017, when Bitcoin\u2019s price broke above its 2013 top, that a bullish run occurred among altcoins. During the second half of 2017, the initial coin offering boom on Ethereum and retail investment hype around Ripple\u2019s XRP (XRP) led to an altcoin season, with many tokens outperforming Bitcoin until January 2018.\n\nNevertheless, in the aftermath of the bull market, altcoins generally suffered greater losses than Bitcoin, suggesting the surge resulted from users buying them during Bitcoin bull markets with the hope of capturing higher returns.\n\nThe chart below shows that Bitcoin found support around $6,500 during the bear market of 2018 to 2019 after recovering from lows of $3,250 in late 2018. However, the total market capitalization of altcoins continued to hover around its lows for most of the duration of the bear market, only reversing the trend after Bitcoin broke above its previous peak of $20,000.\n\nBitcoin price (top) and altcoin market capitalization (bottom). Source: TradingView\n\nK33 Research calculated the performance of investing $1 each in 1,009 altcoins since 2015 as they entered the top 100 by market capitalization on CoinMarketCap versus the same amount invested in Bitcoin simultaneously.\n\nThe altcoin portfolio would be worth approximately $7,000 today, compared with $50,000 from the Bitcoin-only strategy.\n\nAltcoins vs. Bitcoin performance since 2015. Source: K33 Research\n\nAltcoins are usually narrative-driven, and many narratives die with the evolution of the market. For instance, privacy-based tokens were quite popular in 2017, but many have dropped out of the top 100 due to regulatory scrutiny.\n\nSimilarly, many of the decentralized finance tokens that populated the market in 2020 \u2014 such as Compound\u2019s COMP (COMP) and THORChain's RUNE (RUNE) \u2014 have dropped out of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap due to declining DeFi usage and demand for holding non-yielding governance tokens.\n\nAltcoins are also subject to volatility and unpredictable shifts, with regulatory uncertainty hovering over most. They may experience their individual altcoin seasons at different times, and the duration can vary significantly, requiring investors to have perfect timing to churn a profit.\n\nK33\u2019s analysts found that since 2015, over two-thirds of the 1,009 altcoin projects that managed to creep into the top 100 have become inactive. Only 9.11% of these altcoins yielded positive returns, with only around 1.5% outpacing Bitcoin\u2019s 50x returns.\n\nPerformance of 1,009 altcoins that entered the top 100 since 2015. Source: K33 Research\n\nThe report adds that altcoin investments were only profitable two times since 2015: in 2017, when Ether and XRP were outperforming, and in 2021, during the hype surrounding Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB).\n\nNotably, during the second half of 2021, when Bitcoin made new all-time highs at $69,000, altcoins posted relatively dull gains, with the exception of ETH.\n\nPositive breakout in Bitcoin\u2019s dominance\n\nBesides a breakout in Bitcoin\u2019s all-time high, breakouts from crucial levels in Bitcoin\u2019s dominance levels are another potent indicator that helps identify long-term trend reversals in altcoins.\n\nAltcoin seasons during the previous two cycles were marked by Bitcoin\u2019s dominance breaking below 60%. After the bullish trend reversal, the bottom in Bitcoin\u2019s dominance also coincided with the top in the total market capitalization of altcoins.\n\nThe total market capitalization of crypto excluding Bitcoin (top) and BTC dominance over the crypto market (below). Source: TradingView\n\nIf history repeats itself, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance could rise further while altcoin performance remains subdued.\n\nA breakout in Bitcoin\u2019s dominance above the 50% level on June 19 \u2014 thanks to BlackRock filing for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund \u2014 has opened room for further altcoin losses, as it marked a crucial historical resistance point.\n\nIn the latter half of the 2008\u20132022 bear market, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance increased to over 70%. On the other hand, it performed relatively better, holding its price above the 2018 lows of around $3,250. K33 Research also shows that this period marked significantly poor altcoin performances, making new lows toward the end.\n\nRelated: Crypto industry \u2018destined\u2019 to be BTC-focused due to regulators: Michael Saylor\n\nThe K33 Research analysts added that while altcoin portfolios have shown the potential for greater profits than Bitcoin, they require \u201ctiming the market or picking the altcoin winners.\u201d Anders Helseth, vice president of research at K33 Research, told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cYou can create higher returns by trading market sentiment more aggressively, but it requires a lot of attention, and it is obviously more risky.\"\n\nGiven that Bitcoin has outperformed altcoins over the long run, dollar-cost averaging (DCAing) into Bitcoin can be an effective investment strategy for crypto investors.\n\nTo DCA means to regularly invest a fixed amount of money into a particular asset over a specific period, regardless of the investment\u2019s price, to average the principal amount and remove the need to time the markets. Helseth told Cointelegraph that DCAing is \u201ca sensible, quite safe, simple crypto investment strategy.\u201d\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Its first application was rejected by the SEC in December 2021. Its second application was rejected once again in October 2022, with the financial regulator citing similar concerns of fraud and market manipulation. At the time of publication, WisdomTree oversees approximately $83 billion in assets.\n\nOne of the key differences with BlackRock\u2019s recent filing to the SEC is that it intends to enter into a \u201csurveillance sharing agreement\u201d with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures markets.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s proposal cites the SEC\u2019s approval of a Bitcoin futures fund by investment advisory firm Teucrium. That ruling noted that the CME \u201ccomprehensively surveils futures market conditions and price movements on a real time and ongoing basis in order to detect and prevent price distortions, including price distortions caused by manipulative efforts.\u201d\n\nThis has been echoed in WisdomTree\u2019s filing as well, which states that it too is willing to enter into such a surveillance agreement with \u201can operator of a US-based spot trading platform for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nLess than four hours after WisdomTree filed its application, global investment manager Invesco \u201creactivated\u201d its application for a similar product.\n\nAnd now Invesco has reactivated their 19b-4 for their spot ETF https://t.co/D2zTpqrqJH \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 20, 2023\n\nAccording to the 19b-4 document \u2014 which informs the SEC of a proposed rule change \u2014 Invesco requested that the financial regulator allow its \u201cInvesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF\u201d product to be listed on the Cboe BZX exchange.\n\nThe filing notes that a spot Bitcoin ETF which uses \u201cprofessional custodians and other service providers,\u201d removes the need for investors to rely on \u201cloosely regulated offshore vehicles\u201d in turn, allowing for investors to more readily \u201cprotect their principal investments in Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWhile the SEC is yet to approve a single spot Bitcoin ETF product, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said that \u201cBlackRock breathed new life into the race\u201d in response to his own tweet concerning the WisdomTree filing.\n\nFun fact: BlackRock's record of getting ETFs approved by the SEC is 575-1. That's another reason this is so big, they don't play around. https://t.co/f7YIhGRmLf \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 16, 2023\n\nAdditionally, Balchunas said that crypto investors may have good reason to be optimistic when it comes to BlackRock\u2019s move, sharing that the investment firm has a \u201c575-1\u201d record of getting ETFs approved by the regulator.\n\nRelated: BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF \u2018is the best thing to happen\u2019 to BTC, or is it?\n\nIn addition to the recent activity from WisdomTree and Invesco, rumors have begun circulating that the multi-trillion-dollar fund manager Fidelity Investments may also be looking to capitalize on the newfound frenzy for spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAccording to a June 19 tweet from Arch Public co-founder AP_Abacus, Fidelity Investments \u2014 which manages some $4.9 trillion in assets \u2014 may look to file for its own spot Bitcoin ETF. Alternatively, Abacus notes that the investment firm could make an offer on Grasyscale\u2019s GBTC ETF product.\n\nCointelegraph reached out to Fidelity for confirmation but did not receive an immediate response.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with \u2018Net Zero\u2019 promises"

        "content": "The world\u2019s largest Bitcoin (BTC) conference, Bitcoin 2023, in Miami, Florida, passed without major fanfare this year. Past conferences announced nation-state adoption, massive crypto integrations in the United States, and islands and territories worldwide embracing Bitcoin.\n\nNonetheless, at Bitcoin 2023, one partnership with a potentially significant impact on the world\u2019s 15th-largest economy flew under the radar.\n\nWe're thrilled to announce our partnership with Grupo Salinas. Looking forward to seeing the positive impact this collaboration will have.\u26a1\ufe0f #Bitcoin #bitcoiconference2023 https://t.co/rkAjWnmKsK pic.twitter.com/yWIWc6751B \u2014 IBEX \u26a1\ufe0f (@PoweredbyIBEX) May 18, 2023\n\nJos\u00e9 Lemus, the CEO of Ibex Mercado, closed out the Bitcoin 2023 Industry Day. He announced a partnership with Grupo Salinas, one of Mexico\u2019s largest corporate conglomerates. In brief, the collaboration would allow millions of Mexicans to pay their internet bills at popular telecoms company Total Play using the Bitcoin Lightning Network.\n\nCrucially, the Salinas Group owns tens of businesses across Mexico. Its billionaire founder, Ricardo Salinas Pliego, is the third-richest person in the country and a well-known Bitcoin maximalist.\n\nNot only does the Bitcoin Lightning payments integration already deliver Bitcoin adoption to millions of Mexicans, but as Lemus explained to Cointelegraph, Total Play is one small retailer that\u2019s part of the vast Salinas conglomerate:\n\n\u201cImagine if Best Buy, Bank of America, Fox News and an NFL team were all owned by the same individual. All of them will have Lightning capabilities in the future.\u201d\n\nLemus explained it\u2019s just the \u201ctip of the iceberg of what will go on in Mexico,\u201d as more Bitcoin and Lightning integrations, and on and off-ramps attract more Bitcoin business. Speaking via video link, Lemus explained that fiat and Bitcoin can interact more freely in Mexico:\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you have a wallet and you want to make Mexican pesos available in Mexico, or you have an exchange and you want to make the balances for your customers in Mexico. You can do that through CoinPro or through Grupo Salinas.\u201d\n\nThe partnership is the beginning of Lightning functionality across Grupo Salinas. There will be a Lightning app \u201cfor employees, a super app for soccer teams to do something similar to what we have with the Perth Heat where we drive fan engagement with innovative ways.\u201d\n\nThe Australian baseball team, Perth Heat, adopted a Bitcoin standard in 2021, with players earning salaries in Bitcoin and \u201cSats4Stats\u201d, where players receive Bitcoin for hitting home runs. Plus, fan engagement activities use the Lightning Network. For example, during baseball games, \u201cWhen a player steals a base, a QR flashes on screen and the first people that scan it get satoshis,\u201d Lemus explained.\n\nPlayers can send satoshis to players directly during Perth Heat baseball games. Source: PerthHeat.com.au\n\nIn the first year of operation, the Perth Heat players earned an extra 1% through Bitcoin, Lemus said on stage at Bitcoin 2023. \u201cIt\u2019s still early\u201d for such a technology, but an extra 1% is already encouraging.\n\nGrupo Salinas owns the Mexican football clubs, Mazatl\u00e1n and Club Puebla. Fans could soon get their hands on free money \u2014 in the form of Bitcoin or satoshis \u2014 for simply scanning the QR code on the stadium screen when a player scores, just like with Perth Heat.\n\nA snapshot of some of the Grupo Salinas brands spanning retail, banking, sports and advertising. Source: GrupoSalinas.com\n\nIbex Mercado understands the massive opportunity for financial inclusion offered by the Lightning Network. Lemus founded Ibex in neighboring Guatemala, and the company delivered the Lightning Network integration for El Salvador\u2019s Chivo Wallet \u2014 which effectively banked millions of Salvadorans \u2014 two years prior.\n\nLemus explained that more Bitcoin adoption could improve the lives of unbanked and underserved populations. Moreover, financial inclusion goes beyond banking the unbanked:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the ability to raise funds for your company. It\u2019s the ability to open yourself to a broader market. And that is what, for me, true financial inclusion is.\u201d\n\nFinally, Lemus highlighted the potential of Mexico as a Bitcoin destination: \u201cI think that Mexico is going to be the place where this is going to take off.\u201c More broadly, 2022 was a promising year for Bitcoin and crypto adoption in the country, from crypto remittance companies establishing in Mexico to crypto exchange expansion.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin adoption of Guatemalan merchants grows one BTC tattoo at a time\n\nDoes this mean that crypto enthusiasts may soon be able to live on Bitcoin like they can in El Salvador? Lemus replied:\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you conduct most of your life in Bitcoin, I think 18 months is a reasonable target where you can do most of your life. But obviously, things like taxes and maybe rent will not run on Bitcoin yet.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the partnership with Grupo Salinas took 18 months of work and preparation, Lemus said. More partnerships and projects are on the horizon in Mexico, although it\u2019s too early to share details, Lemus concluded.\n\nMagazine: Peter McCormack\u2019s Real Bedford Football Club puts Bitcoin on the map"

As for balances on trading platforms, they have reached a bottom since early 2018. This figure stands at 2.3 million BTC at the time of writing.\n\nA divergence can be observed between exchange balances, and the volume of coins held in illiquid wallets, being those with little to no history of spending.\n\n\n\nIlliquid supply reached a new ATH of 15.2M BTC this week, whilst exchange balances have fallen to the lowest levels since\u2026 pic.twitter.com/qLW1Wto21t \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) June 21, 2023\n\nHodlers accumulating Bitcoin fast and steadily\n\nGlassnode also wrote that BTC hodlers are buying Bitcoin by approximately 42,200 coins per month: \"the price insensitive class are absorbing a non-trivial portion of the currently available supply.\"\n\nThis process of active gradual buying started around two years ago, and Glassnode believes that investors may continue to buy BTC for another six months or even a year.\n\n\"Big players are jumping in\"\n\nProminent crypto trader and analyst Michael van de Poppe has reminded his followers that \"the big players are jumping in\" to buy Bitcoin.\n\nRecently, BlackRock fund management company submitted an application for a Bitcoin ETF, and Fidelity was rumored to do that soon too. Invesco and WisdomTree have both applied for a Bitcoin ETF as well. Deutsche Bank is striving to gain a license to provide crypto custodial services.\n\nBesides, Fidelity, Citadel and Schwab have joined forces to launch cryptocurrency exchange EDX. All this has pushed Bitcoin up over $28,000, and it is trading close to the $29,000 level now.\n\nPoppe added, \"The big players are jumping in, so should you.\""

        "content": "U.S.-based investment manager Invesco re-filed its spot Bitcoin ETF application with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 20.\n\nIn conjunction with Galaxy Digital, the firm had previously filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF in September 2021. It also applied for a futures ETF product, named \u201cThe Invesco Bitcoin Strategy ETF,\u201d in August 2021 \u2013 later dropping the application in October 2021, giving no specific reason for the turnaround.\n\nInvesco\u2019s re-filing comes in quick succession to WisdomTree and BlackRock\u2019s spot ETF applications. The BlackRock filing was made on June 15, when market sentiment was low due to heightened regulatory hostility.\n\nAlex Adelma, the chief executive of Bitcoin rewards app Lolli, said that as the world\u2019s largest investment manager, BlackRock had reinvigorated institutional interest in Bitcoin \u2013 likely triggering a wave of institutional Bitcoin-related financial products to come.\n\nIn its current filing, Invesco pointed out that prior ETF approvals were made based on the listing exchange having a \u201csurveillance sharing agreement\u201d and not on the regulation covering the spot market \u2013 citing examples such as the existence of spot gold products when the spot gold market is \u201clargely unregulated.\u201d\n\nIt added that its product offers investor protection over and above buying Bitcoin directly, including protection against insolvency and cyber attacks. Also, hinting at investor harm caused by numerous CeFi bankruptcies last year, it stated that if a spot Bitcoin ETF were approved, U.S. investors would not use \u201cloosely regulated offshore vehicles.\u201d\n\nThe SEC has repeatedly rejected spot Bitcoin ETF applications, raising concerns about cryptocurrency volatility and market manipulation.\n\nGiven BlackRock\u2019s standing and track record in ETF approvals, some hope this wave of applications will yield an alternative response from the regulator.\n\nMentioned in this article"

The plan was negotiated with key stakeholders, and according to the filing, the firm is \u201cseeking to build as much consensus as possible\u201d about how a new Core Scientific would look after emerging from its bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nThe company said it had seen a boost in liquidity since filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and is focused on revamping its business plan to make a successful comeback. The company attributed its improved financial performance to higher Bitcoin prices, increased network hash rate and reduced energy costs.\n\nA Chapter 11 bankruptcy allows a firm to continue operating until stakeholders agree on a restructuring plan, which could involve measures such as downsizing business operations to reduce debt or liquidating assets to repay creditors. The Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan refers to the formal document that outlines how the company intends to reorganize itself and repay its creditors.\n\nThe bankruptcy plan explained that, on the effective date of the bankruptcy plan, holders of allowed debtor-in-possession (DIP) claims would receive full and final satisfaction of their claims. They will either receive full payment in cash or agreed-upon alternative treatment. Any liens granted to secure the DIP claims will also be terminated, removing the secured interest over the company\u2019s assets.\n\nRelated: \u2018Unjustly enriched\u2019 \u2014 Core Scientific knocks back $4.7M claim from Celsius\n\nCore Scientific had received permission from the bankruptcy court to take out a loan of up to $70 million from investment bank B. Riley, one of the company\u2019s biggest creditors. The loan would be used to pay off the bankrupt Bitcoin miner\u2019s existing debtor-in-possession financing loan, which also came from B. Riley.\n\nCore Scientific filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 21, 2022, due to falling revenue amid low BTC prices. The filing came just after a creditor offered to help Core Scientific avoid possible bankruptcy.\n\nMagazine: Inside the Iranian Bitcoin mining industry"

Discover SCENE\n\nA New York City bathhouse and spa sparked a bit of controversy when they revealed that they were operating a small-scale bitcoin mining operation that also heated their pools. The business, named Bathouse, posted yesterday on Instagram they are operating on a Bitcoin Standard.\n\nBathhouse is located in Brooklyn and accepts Bitcoin payments. The company took to social media yesterday to explain how the process actually works.\n\nThe heat generated by their mining heats their pools, with the water returning later in the process to cool the hardware. Their post read, \u201cEnjoy a hot pool while supporting the Bitcoin network.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA Bitcoin mining rig is the physical infrastructure of the computers that execute the network\u2019s computational process. These use a fair amount of electricity\u2014regardless of source\u2014as well as produce a lot of noise and heat. Mining also requires cooling methods, such as Bathhouse\u2019s process, to not overheat and run efficiently.\n\nImage: Bathhouse on Instagram\n\nImplementing their unique heating process in March 2022, their founders \u201cwere interested in what this technology can do for humanity.\u201d Bathhouse told Decrypt they were looking for an efficient engineering solution, and trying to find ways to conserve energy.\n\nAccording to the business, they have now \u201cproven to themselves Bitcoin mining is a viable option.\u201d\n\nBathhouse also explained that it \u201ccan see this being implemented into a lot of building solutions for creating heat, domestic hot water, et cetera,\u201d and that they are \u201chappy to share what they have learned with anyone interested.\u201d\n\nBitcoin mining is the process in which specialized computers, known as ASICs, compete to find a specific number, which is found on average every ten minutes. Known as proof of work, the miner that finds the solution to the algorithm\u2013known as SHA256\u2013receives bitcoin as a reward for the energy spent in the process. At the moment, the reward is 6.25 BTC per block, although it is meant to be cut in half next year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMining is a controversial subject, as was made clear by some of the replies on the social media post.\n\n\u201cThis makes me like Bathhouse less,\u201d said one user. \u201cNow I'm concerned about who is mining this cryptocurrency, who is profiting from it, and whether I support that. We\u2019re gonna need some transparency.\u201d\n\nOthers had similar thoughts, one commenter adding, \u201cIn the year of our lord 2023\u2026 thinking bitcoin mining gives you cachet? Praying this is a poorly-conceived joke.\u201d\n\nThe post, however, did gather steam\u2013pun intended\u2013among bitcoiners, with Bradley Rettler (commonly known as one of the \u201cbitcoin philosophers\u201d from the group Resistance Money) writing on Instagram: \u201cThank you for securing the network, helping resist authoritarianism, and bringing financial freedom to people while you heat your pools!\u201d"

Powell also remarked that cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, have \"staying power.\"\n\nHis comments came on Capitol Hill during a semiannual hearing on monetary policy held by the Republican-led House Financial Services Committee and led by Patrick McHenry (R-NC).\n\nResponding to a question posed by Maxine Waters (D-CA) on stablecoins, Powell said the technology\u2014where tokens pegged to the price of a sovereign currency like the dollar and issued by private companies\u2014should have strong federal oversight.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe do see payments stablecoins as a form of money, and in all advanced economies, the ultimate source of credibility in money is the central bank,\u201d Powell said. \u201cWe believe that it would be appropriate to have quite a robust federal role in what happens in stable coins going forward.\u201d\n\nWaters raised concerns that the Fed would be \u201chamstrung\u201d to do anything if stablecoin issuers could register directly with states\u2014an option currently included in the draft legislation on stablecoins.\n\nPowell signaled the Fed thinks it\u2019s an important part of the regulatory landscape for tokens collateralized by dollars and said, \u201cleaving [the Fed] with a weak role and allowing a lot of private money creation at the state level would be a mistake.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, Powell said before Congress that stablecoins could be a worthy part of the \u201cpayments universe,\u201d as opposed to any other type of crypto asset. He went on to say that stablecoins should be regulated in a way that mirrors money market mutual funds and bank deposits.\n\nSince then, several bills that would address stablecoin regulation have stalled out. But after holding a session where lawmakers can iron out proposed changes in July, McHenry said the current stablecoin bill that\u2019s in the works will be advanced to the Senate if a positive consensus is reached.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "In the latest episode of The Market Report, Cointelegraph analyst and writer Marcel Pechman explains what\u2019s behind Bitcoin (BTC) reaching 50% crypto market dominance for the first time in two years amid Blackrock\u2019s spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) filing, and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s crackdown on altcoins.\n\nAccording to Pechman, it must be admitted that no one expected Bitcoin to become the second-largest nonfungible token blockchain. Analysis from CryptoSlam shows that the 30-day adjusted data \u2014 excluding wash trades \u2014 was $380 million for Ether (ETH) versus $104 million on Bitcoin and $40 million on Solana (SOL).\n\nTherefore, Michael Saylor\u2019s call for 80% market dominance depends on decentralized finance moving to the Bitcoin network. While it might sound impossible right now, that\u2019s because there is no infrastructure for smart contracts on Bitcoin, regardless of a second layer.\n\nNext, Pechman raises an issue with Glassnode\u2019s recent \u201cThe Week On-Chain\u201d report. Using data from previous halving cycles, analysts ascertain that Bitcoin sideways price action may last 18 months, which \u201csuggests that another 6 to 12 months may be ahead of us.\u201c\n\nPechman reminds us that, in real life, if the Bitcoin price spikes from $25,000 to $70,000 and corrects to $40,000, for example, that\u2019s life or death for most traders \u2014 figuratively speaking. Calling the pre-halving period \u201csideways boredom\u201d just because Bitcoin eventually reaches $150,000 after the halving does not make sense.\n\nIn the final segment, Pechman discusses Deutsche Bank\u2019s digital asset custody license application. A digital asset custody service means holding client assets, not investing the bank\u2019s money or integrating cryptocurrency services. When it comes to accepting Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) deposits as collateral for international shipping or originating loans, Pechman believes we\u2019re still some way from seeing this.\n\nDon\u2019t miss The Market Report, which airs exclusively on the new Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel."

Discover SCENE\n\nTwo more U.S.-based asset managers moved to file for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the wake of the investment giant BlackRock making a similar application last week.\n\nBitcoin ETFs are investment vehicles that track the price of the leading cryptocurrency, aiming to provide investors with exposure to the price movements of Bitcoin without requiring them to directly own and store the underlying asset. Instead of purchasing and holding Bitcoin themselves, investors can buy shares of the ETF, which represents ownership of a pool of Bitcoin held by the fund.\n\nETF provider WisdomTree re-submitted an application requesting regulatory approval for the launch of the WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust on Tuesday, June 20. The trust is intended to be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange under the ticker symbol \u201cBTCW.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs stated in its filing, WisdomTree's primary investment objective is to achieve exposure to the price movements of Bitcoin while taking into account the expenses and obligations associated with operating the ETF. The trust plans to determine the daily value of the shares based on the CF Bitcoin US Settlement Price, which consolidates trading data from major Bitcoin spot exchanges.\n\nNew York-based WisdomTree, which currently holds around $93 billion in assets under management, has made two previous attempts to secure approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Both applications were rejected by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in December 2021 and October 2022, respectively.\n\nInvesco joins the race\n\nInvesco, another major investment company with as much as $1.49 trillion under its management as of May 2023, followed with its own application for a spot Bitcoin ETF later on Tuesday. Invesco initially teamed up with Mike Novogratz\u2019s Galaxy Digital to file for the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF in September 2021, and now seeks to reintroduce the instrument.\n\nIn its filing, the Atlanta-based firm argues that the lack of a spot Bitcoin ETF \u201cexposes U.S. investor assets to significant risk\u201d as they \u201care forced to find alternative exposure through generally riskier means.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor instance, many U.S. investors that held their digital assets in accounts at FTX, Celsius Network LLC, BlockFi Inc. and Voyager Digital Holdings, Inc. have become unsecured creditors in the insolvencies of those entities,\u201d reads the filing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo that end, approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, according to Invesco, \u201cwould represent a major win for the protection of U.S. investors\u201d seeking exposure to crypto assets.\n\nIn the past, the company also filed for a Bitcoin futures ETF, but pulled the plug on the effort in October 2021 after a futures ETF by ProShares was approved and began trading first.\n\nThe SEC has repeatedly denied or postponed decisions on a physical Bitcoin ETF, raising concerns over the cryptocurrency\u2019s volatility and risk of market manipulation. The new wave of applications, spurred by BlackRock\u2019s filing last week, can be seen as a sign of asset management giants acknowledging the growing demand for regulated investment vehicles in the crypto space.\n\nWhether this changes the regulator\u2019s stance on the matter remains to be seen, though.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin continued its upward trajectory following the news, approaching $29,000 after breaking $28,000 for the first time since May 8."

Narrowing down the trigger for the rally is complicated, but some analysts point to the potential inflow of institutional investors if BlackRock\u2019s exchange-traded fund (ETF) application gets regulatory approval.\n\nBlackRock just filed with the SEC to create a spot #Bitcoin ETF.\n\n\n\nGiven their reputation, this has the highest likelihood of happening out of all the attempts at a spot ETF so far.\n\n\n\nThe institutional liquidity floodgates may finally open https://t.co/c9g2Ten1h8 pic.twitter.com/L2NmXq11gL \u2014 Joe Consorti \u26a1 (@JoeConsorti) June 15, 2023\n\nARK Invest CEO and chief investment officer Cathie Wood explained the rationale for the firm\u2019s bullishness on the Bitcoin (BTC) price, specifically its $1 million target. According to Wood, even in a deflationary environment, Bitcoin can still outperform by offering a solution to the traditional financial system\u2019s counterparty risk.\n\nFurthermore, the negative regulatory pressure eased on June 16 after Binance was able to strike a temporary agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to avoid a potential asset freeze. The event further cemented Bitcoin bears\u2019 opportunity to profit on the $715 million weekly BTC options expiry.\n\nBears made a mistake when BTC\u2019s price dropped below $25,000\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price dropped below $26,300 on June 10, fueling bearish bets by traders using options contracts. Such a level was only recouped on June 16, which explains why bears have concentrated their bets on Bitcoin trading below $27,000.\n\nDeribit Bitcoin options aggregate open interest for June 23. Source: Deribit\n\nThe 0.82 put-to-call ratio reflects the difference in open interest between the $415 million call (buy) options and the $300 million put (sell) options. However, the outcome will be lower, as bears were caught by surprise as Bitcoin gained 10% in two days.\n\nFor instance, if Bitcoin\u2019s price remains near $29,800 at 8:00 am UTC on June 23, there will be only $5 million in put options. This distinction arises since the right to sell Bitcoin at $28,000 or $29,000 is rendered void if BTC trades above that on the expiry.\n\nBulls are in a good position to capture a $250 million profit\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on June 23 for call (buy) and put (sell) instruments varies depending on the expiration price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $27,000 and $28,000: 3,500 calls vs. 1,200 puts. The net result favors the call (buy) instruments by $60 million.\n\n3,500 calls vs. 1,200 puts. The net result favors the call (buy) instruments by $60 million.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin Cash and Shares of CleanSpark and Hut 8 Mining Are Rising Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nCryptocurrencies and crypto-related stocks moved higher on Wednesday as more traditional financial companies are jumping into the space. The price of the world's largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, had blasted over $30,600 as of this writing.\n\nSince late afternoon yesterday, the price of Bitcoin Cash (or BCH, a cryptocurrency created in August 2017 in a hard-fork blockchain split from Bitcoin) was more than 21% higher as of 12:35 p.m. ET today. Meanwhile, shares of the Bitcoin-mining companies CleanSpark (CLSK 3.76%) and Hut 8 Mining (HUT) were up more than 13% and roughly 10.5%, respectively, on the day.\n\nSo what\n\nIn recent weeks, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has come down hard on the crypto industry, first suing Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, and then Coinbase Global (COIN -1.72%). This comes after two crypto banks have gone down since the latter part of 2022.\n\nBut the scrutiny seems to have opened the door for more traditional financial firms to enter the fray. Yesterday, news outlets reported that a crypto exchange called EDX Markets, which is backed by Fidelity, Charles Schwab, and Citadel, is now up and running.\n\nAlso yesterday, news outlets reported that Deutsche Bank (DB -0.20%) is now seeking to become a crypto custodian in Germany. In the past, the bank has expressed interest in being a custodian so it could provide clients with \"institutional-grade hot/cold storage solution with insurance-grade protection.\"\n\nBitbank analyst Yuya Hasegawa wrote in a research note today, \"Expectations for the approval of BlackRock's [Bitcoin] Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) and rumors that Fidelity is preparing to apply for a similar ETF have led [Bitcoin] to move steadily since the beginning of the week.\"\n\nBitcoin Cash is leading cryptocurrencies in gains today, likely due to the fact that it is one of the select tokens EDX will offer on its platform to start.\n\nIn other news, CleanSpark announced in a press release today that it will purchase two turnkey Bitcoin mining campuses in Dalton, Georgia, with more than 6,000 mining machines for $9.3 million. The purchase is expected to boost the company's exahash-per-second (EH/S) rate by just under 1 EH/S.\n\nCEO Zach Bradford was quoted as saying: \"This acquisition ensures that we have more than enough infrastructure to reach our year-end target of 16 EH/S. It also continues to position us as one of the most power-efficient miners on an energy-per-hashrate basis.\"\n\nChief financial officer Gary Vecchiarelli said that the company continues to improve its operations in preparation for next year's Bitcoin halving, which many investors view as a catalyst.\n\n\"Importantly, this acquisition is fully paid for from our existing cash reserves, and we expect it to almost immediately start driving revenue to our bottom line,\" Vecchiarelli said.\n\nNow what\n\nThe crypto sector largely seems to be benefiting today from excitement over increased institutional interest in digital assets, which seems like it will be needed given the increased regulatory scrutiny.\n\nCleanSpark is certainly benefiting from its acquisition announcement today, but Bitcoin miners tend to do well when the price of the crypto rises because that is the asset they mine and hold.\n\nUltimately, I prefer to hold the largest, most established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin over other plays in the space, like Bitcoin miners or altcoins. But I do think CleanSpark is well positioned among its peer group."

Previously, Valkyrie proposed its fund be listed on NYSE Arca, but now it\u2019s looking at the Nasdaq.\n\nIn past iterations, Valkyrie listed Coinbase Custody Trust Company as the custodian of Bitcoin associated with the fund. But Coinbase\u2019s custody firm is no longer included in the updated prospectus.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf approved, Valkyrie would be able to issue an unlimited number of shares for the fund, which would have its price updated daily between 4:00 and 4:30 pm ET, when trading on Wall Street comes to a daily close. The fund notes, however, that its ability to gather Bitcoin is limited by the network\u2019s cap of 21 million than can ever be mined.\n\nValkyrie Digital Assets did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt."

The crypto buzz comes after the launch of EDX markets, a crypto exchange backed by Wall Street firms including Charles Schwab and Citadel Securities. Investors are feeling confident about the institutional interest in the crypto sector which could secure its future in US crypto stocks, some of which have been under pressure since the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Coinbase and its rival Binance for allegedly selling unregistered securities. Still, some investors worry that the crypto buzz might not last given the regulatory pressures that shape the industry."

BTC has risen more than 12% since Tuesday when U.S. markets reopened after a long holiday weekend. Spot bitcoin ETF filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by three financial services giants, including BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, have buoyed investors who had had been reeling earlier this month when the SEC filed lawsuits against exchange powerhouses Binance and Coinbase.\n\nThose suits continue to cloud crypto's future in the U.S., and the agency has yet to approve any of the more than half-dozen ETF applications presented in recent years, or indicate that it is ready to change its mind.\n\n\"This is truly welcome news for the market, but perhaps not quite the beginning of the end of the bear market,\" Tim Frost, CEO of digital wealth platform Yield App, noted cautiously in an email to CoinDesk. \"This pump is likely down to a lot of institutional buying on BlackRock and other institutions\u2019 applications for a Bitcoin spot ETF, which have not been approved. And, if these get rejected by the US SEC like all the others, this may well lead to another tumble.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nEther, the second largest crypto in market value, was recently changing hands at $1,880, down about 1.8% from Wednesday, same time. ETH had been holding steady above $1,900 after regaining this level the previous days for the first time since the start of the month.\n\nOther major cryptos were mixed with a few, including ADA, the token of smart contracts platform Cardano, and Litecoin up more than 2%, but others, including MATIC, the native crypto of the Polygon blockchain, off about the same. Increasingly popular memecoin PEPE was up 11%, although it had been up 70% earlier in the day. After spending most of the day in the green, the CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, sank into negative territory and was recently down 0.9%.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 closed up 0.8% and 0.2%, respectively, shrugging off a reiteration of hawkish remarks by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The U.S. central bank said last week that it likely would resume interest rate hikes later this year after ending a more than year-long diet of increases.\n\nYield App's Frost wrote that the most recent surge would \"not be particularly welcome news as this pump is entirely due to centralized institutions in traditional finance becoming more interested (in crypto).\"\n\nBut he added: \"These detractors should really think about the future. Cryptocurrency cannot stay in its own echo chamber forever and it must be accepted and bought by institutions if it is to truly grow and expand.\"\n\nBiggest Gainers\n\nAsset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Shiba Inu SHIB +2.3% Currency Terra LUNA +0.3% Smart Contract Platform\n\nBiggest Losers\n\nInsights\n\nWhat Is BlackRock's Motivation?\n\nThe institutions are taking a fresh look at crypto and they\u2019re flooding in.\n\nLast week, BlackRock (BLK) applied for a spot bitcoin exchange-trade fund (ETF). This week, another comically large asset manager in Invesco (IVZ) reapplied for approval to offer a spot bitcoin ETF. The less-comically large ETF-sponsor WisdomTree also refiled for a spot bitcoin product yesterday (WisdomTree\u2019s filing was initially rejected by the SEC in 2022).\n\nElsewhere in non-bitcoin crypto, a crypto exchange backed by Fidelity, Schwab and Citadel Securities launched in the United States and Deutsche Bank applied for a digital asset license in Germany.\n\nSo yes, the institutions are back. But why did $10 trillion asset manager BlackRock and $1.5 trillion asset manager Invesco decide it was time for the spot bitcoin ETF again? Many have offered convoluted and tinfoil-hat theories (some which I quite like).\n\nTheories like BlackRock is scrambling to backstop Coinbase for some reason or the big firms are acting on behalf of three letter agencies to keep self-custodied bitcoin away from everyday people or that Wall Street can\u2019t let the crypto crowd get too far ahead of them.\n\nThere are more theories out there, but here\u2019s a much simpler one: Financial institutions like making money and offering a spot bitcoin ETF is a way to make money.\n\nRead the full story here:\n\nImportant events.\n\nETHGlobal (Toronto)\n\n8:17 a.m. HKT/SGT(12:17 a.m. UTC): Jibun Bank Manufacturing/Services PMIs (June preliminary)\n\n5:15 p.m. HKT/SGT(9:15 a.m. UTC): St. Louis Fed President James Bullard speech\n\nCoinDesk TV\n\nIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of \"First Mover\" on CoinDesk TV:\n\nBitcoin Crosses $30K; Crypto Exchange Backed by Fidelity, Schwab Launches With Additional Investors\n\nBitcoin (BTC) extended its rally after surpassing the $30,000 mark for the second time this year the day before.

        "content": "Update (June 22 at 14:27 UTC): This article has been updated to clarify that CleanSpark purchased the facilities for proprietary mining only.\n\nCrypto mining firm CleanSpark is moving forward with its aggressive infrastructure expansion in the United States by acquiring two Bitcoin (BTC) mining facilities in a $9.3 million cash deal.\n\nAccording to a June 21 announcement, the two facilities CleanSpark will purchase are turnkey Bitcoin mining campuses in Dalton, Georgia. The facilities will house 6,000 Antminer S19 XPs and S19J Pro+s, which are expected to add about 1 exahash per second (EH/s) to CleanSpark\u2019s hash rate following the deal\u2019s completion. According to Zach Bradford, CEO of CleanSpark, the newly acquired infrastructure will enable the company to reach its target of 16 EH/s by the end of the year.\n\nThe purchase follows several other acquisitions by CleanSpark in recent months, despite a slump in BTC mining profitability during the bear market. In April, the company announced the purchase of 45,000 Antminer S19 XP rigs for $144.9 million, which is expected to add 6.4 EH/s of mining power.\n\nIn February, CleanSpark added 20,000 new Antminer S19j Pro+ units to its portfolio for $43.6 million, expected to bring an additional 2.44 EH/s to its computing power. A few weeks earlier, the company announced a $16 million expansion at its Georgia facility, with 15,000 new rigs.\n\nThe profitability of Bitcoin mining has dropped to $0.066 per TH/s per day at the time of writing, down from its $0.40 peak in June 2019, according to data from Hashrate Index.\n\nBitcoin Hashprice over the past 5 years. Source: Hashrate Index\n\nWith the fast-paced miner expansion, CleanSpark said it anticipates being well-positioned for next year\u2019s Bitcoin halving, expected between April and May 2024. The next halving will reduce Bitcoin block rewards to 3.125 BTC.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price has historically spiked post-halvings, as they reduce the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply while demand generally remains steady. \u201cWe continue to make use of opportunities created by current market conditions to prepare for next year\u2019s bitcoin halving,\u201d CleanSpark chief financial officer Gary Vecchiarelli said.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with \u2018Net Zero\u2019 promises"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitcoin has been shielded from the SEC\u2019s crusade\n\nWhy the SEC considers Bitcoin a commodity, unlike altcoins\n\nBitcoin, the last coin standing\n\nEver since the creation of Bitcoin in 2009, it has been the hallmark name for cryptocurrencies, rendering itself permanently present in any discussion. Bitcoin has also somehow avoided scrutiny throughout the regulatory debacle created by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. All factors considered, could Bitcoin emerge victorious following the SEC war against cryptocurrencies?\n\n\u201cBitcoin Is A Commodity\u201d\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, SEC Chair Gary Gensler declared that Bitcoin, unlike Altcoins considered by previous SEC leaders, is a commodity. Gensler reported that \u201cSome, like bitcoin, and that\u2019s the only one, Jim, I\u2019m going to say because I\u2019m not going to talk about any one of these tokens [that] my predecessors and others have said [are] a commodity.\u201d This could be in reference to previous SEC Director William Hinman\u2019s speech that based his argument regarding the securities vs commodities argument on Ether.\n\nThere\u2019s also a pattern worth noting; throughout the current war the SEC is waging against the crypto trading industry, the commission has mainly focused on altcoins, such as XRP, which is the central argument point in their case against US-based crypto exchange Ripple.\n\nMoreover, another major international crypto exchange, Binance, was also on the receiving end of the SEC\u2019s attack on crypto. While the legal battle marginally influenced the price of Bitcoin, it took a much heavier toll on Binance\u2019s own token, BNB.\n\nEven before being positioned as Chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler was seen in a presentation mentioning a handful of cryptocurrencies that he declared as \u201cnot securities\u201d. Two of the four cryptocurrencies mentioned by Gensler during his presentation were Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Perhaps the SEC Chair is regularly creating stricter rules on crypto trade, but Bitcoin has somewhat, so far, emerged virtually unscathed by the crossfire between crypto exchanges and their assigned regulating commission.\n\nWhy Bitcoin Specifically Though?\n\nCould it be that Bitcoin simply holds the First Mover advantage on the market? Being the first proof of concept, Bitcoin, created by Satoshi Nakamoto, showed what a truly decentralized currency would look like. And, although the currency has fluctuated in price over the years, it has maintained a much higher value than that of any altcoins in testimony to its popularity among any of its counterparts.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg, Business-intelligence firm MicroStrategy\u2019s (MSTR) Founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor pointed out the struggles Altcoins deal with when it comes to SEC regulations, as opposed to Bitcoin. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty clear that the regulators don\u2019t see a legitimate path forward for cryptocurrencies like the stablecoins, crypto securities, like the tokens mentioned. They don\u2019t have any love for crypto derivatives. They don\u2019t have any love for crypto tokens.\u201d He also added, \u201cI mean their view is crypto exchanges should changes should trade and hold pure digital commodities like Bitcoin and so the entire industry is kind of destined to be rationalized down to a Bitcoin-focused industry with maybe a half a dozen to a dozen other proof of work tokens.\u201d\n\nSaylor\u2019s view summarizes the current situation with the SEC, which is adamant about combating crypto exchanges on any cryptocurrency besides Bitcoin. Proof of such a view can be seen when the government itself was seen selling Bitcoins on one of the crypto exchange platforms it\u2019s currently in legal arms with, Coinbase. Whether this view would change with the potential leadership change at the SEC is something only time will tell."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s share of the total crypto market has risen alongside its price this year to date.\n\nThe cryptocurrency\u2019s dominance and on-chain metrics are showing positive signals according to experts.\n\nInvestors are flocking to Bitcoin.\n\nThe top cryptocurrency has soared about 60% this year, fuelled in part by a flurry of big finance moves into crypto, most notably BlackRock\u2019s plan to launch a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\n\nThat has led Bitcoin, or BTC, to strengthen its dominance in crypto markets. Bitcoin\u2019s dominance, the market capitalisation of Bitcoin relative to the total crypto market cap, jumped past 50% this week, for the first time since 2018.\n\nNormally, this is a sign of a \u201cweak market,\u201d said macro analyst Noelle Acheson on Twitter, as investors pull out of riskier tokens leaving Bitcoin as the relatively safer dominant trade.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nIndeed, K33 research said that since the US Securities and Exchange Commission slapped lawsuits against exchanges Binance and Coinbase earlier this month, a shift to Bitcoin and stablecoins \u201chas been a key trend\u201d as investors scramble to relative safety.\n\nNOW READ: Bitcoin\u2019s \u2018digital gold\u2019 narrative sees renaissance \u2014 even as pro traders balk\n\nBut this time, Acheson said of the Bitcoin dominance: \u201cIt signals the consolidation of an inflection point, with BTC leading the beginning of a rally as the main \u2018onramp\u2019 into the crypto-asset investing world.\u201d\n\nShe noted, citing data firm Paradigm, that traders are piling into bullish June 30 call options that pay off when Bitcoin rallies.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nAnd holders are putting their Bitcoin into wallets and keeping it there. Such \u201cilliquid supply\u201d reached a record 15.2 million Bitcoin this week. Around 146,000 Bitcoin a month is flowing into wallets with very little history of spending. Glassnode says that signals a steady and gradual accumulation by long-term holders.\n\nBitcoin \u201cliveliness,\u201d which shows the propensity of Bitcoin holders to spend or hold their coins, is currently at a multi-year macro downtrend. It peaked in May 2021 when the bear market first set in, Glassnode said.\n\nThe data analytics firm notes this is a trend that typically acts as a precursor to a bull cycle.\n\nBitcoin has been a bright spot in an otherwise grim year for crypto traders.\n\nWhat started with scandals and lawsuits after the collapse of FTX in November has snowballed. Trading volume hit a three-year low in May. The SEC\u2019s crypto crackdown has led exchanges to de-list tokens.\n\nBitcoin users are looking to April when Bitcoin\u2019s \u201chalving\u201d is expected to boost its price even further. The halving refers to when the reward for securing the Bitcoin blockchain will fall to 3.125 Bitcoin from 6.25. As a result, the amount of new Bitcoin being created every day will fall.\n\nCurrently around 144 blocks are mined a day, at 6.25 Bitcoin per block which equates to 900 new Bitcoin a day on average. Coinbase Institutional\u2019s head of research, David Duong, said in a recent report that the halving could have a positive impact.\n\nJPMorgan analysts argue the halving could see Bitcoin\u2019s price jump to between $40,000 and $45,000 given the cost of production\u2019s tendency to act as a price floor for the asset. The cost of production for miners will increase as the reward drops, rising to around $40,000.\n\nBitcoin market price and average cost of production (JPMorgan)\n\nPaul Howard, head of sales at Standard Chartered\u2019s Zodia Markets, and a former trading executive at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, told DL News that he expects crypto prices to trade in a range between $22,000 and $32,000 leading up to the halving.\n\nNOW READ: Deutsche Bank, Citadel Securities signal the crypto land grab is accelerating\n\nInvestors in other crypto assets are bracing for the rest of 2023 as Bitcoin users look ahead. What\u2019s not helping: the Fed signalled two more interest rate hikes before the year is out. That spooked investors in riskier assets among broader financial markets.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to push again his higher-for-longer message on Wednesday in his two days of congressional testimony on monetary policy.\n\nNo sure bet\n\nBitcoin\u2019s halving is no sure bet. Bitcoin\u2019s big supply-side event next year might not be the panacea crypto natives hope for.\n\nFor one, Duong questioned the speculative nature of the halving.\n\n\u201cWith only three halving events historically, we have yet to see a clear pattern fully emerge, particularly as previous events were contaminated by factors like global liquidity measures,\u201d he said.\n\nThis time around it looks like global liquidity has peaked in the near term, Duong said, and with another nine months or so until the halving it is \u201cunclear what the net effect on Bitcoin\u2019s price behaviour might be.\u201d\n\nOther alternatives\n\nStill, investors seeking Bitcoin alternatives are running out of options. Howard said that 98% of what he called \u201cjunk coins, are just that,\u201d and \u201cprobably mostly worthless\u201d by 2024.\n\nTether has gained, and its total circulating supply reached a record recently.\n\nTether circulating supply grows versus competitors\n\nThe stablecoin, which comes with its own potential problems, benefited from investors selling Circle\u2019s USDC after it depegged in March and Binance USD slowly being removed from circulation.\n\nThe rotation into these cryptocurrencies leaves altcoins thin on liquidity \u2014 traders dumped Polygon, Cardano, and Solana because they were named in the SEC\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nCelsius could allow creditors to swap their altcoins into BTC and ETH starting on July 1 \u2014 creating around $218 million in sell-side pressure.\n\nDuong said decisions like this have impacted altcoin liquidity. Meanwhile, big financial firms are piling into both the infrastructure and Bitcoin offerings. WisdomTree, Deutsche Bank and Citadel Securities all made big moves in the crypto space this week.\n\nNOW READ: BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF surprise sets up battle with Gensler\u2019s SEC\n\nThe overall ecosystem, with Bitcoin at the helm, is in uncharted territory, noted Bernstein analysts this week:\n\n\u201dMultiple traditional institutions have remained engaged in their crypto strategy and build-out through this winter, which is unlike any other crypto bear market in the past.\u201d\n\nTo share tips or information about Bitcoin or another story please contact the author at adam@dlnews.com."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitcoin has gained sudden popularity due to corporate emergence in the industry\n\nTechnological advances are speeding up the process\n\nPrices are expected to soar and supply is expected to shrink in the upcoming period\n\nThe Bitcoin market has been hit with a staggering amount of news in June. It\u2019s interesting to see how the news affected Bitcoin prices in real-time.\n\nAt first, Bitcoin, during the first two weeks of June, saw a slight drop due to the news regarding Binance, the world\u2019s biggest exchange, facing lawsuits filed by the SEC. The second biggest exchange, Coinbase, was also on the receiving end of the SEC\u2019s wrath against the crypto market.\n\nHowever, in the third week, the tides went the other way. It all started when Blackrock, the world\u2019s biggest asset management firm, officially applied for a spot Bitcoin trading ETF, signaling big money entering the market.\n\nSimultaneously, Binance, the same exchange mentioned above, announced integrating the Bitcoin Lightning Network, a technology that promises faster and cheaper transactions. Less than two days later, a new crypto exchange emerged under the name of EDX Markets. The news of its emergence would\u2019ve gone by unnoticed hadn\u2019t its backing come from some of the world\u2019s biggest corporations.\n\nThe logical question is: Why Bitcoin especially? And how long should we expect this rising interest in Bitcoin to continue?\n\nBitcoin Go Brrr\n\nFollowing the negative news above, Bitcoin saw a slight drop from ~$26,000 to ~$25,000 in the first couple of weeks.\n\nUnderstandably, the market reacted negatively to the news of the world\u2019s biggest exchange potentially going under due to legal challenges, with its first alternative possibly facing the same fate. Binance even had to halt all USD transactions as a result of the SEC\u2019s attack, along with a suspension of all Over The Counter trades.\n\nThen, the news broke out about Blackrock applying for that ETF. To put things into perspective, Blackrock manages assets worth over $9 trillion with a portfolio that includes shares in companies such as Spotify and Uber.\n\nEver since, several investment and asset management companies expressed interest in the Bitcoin market. Fidelity, the world\u2019s third-largest asset management firm was rumored to either apply for its own ETF and/or takeover a digital management firm called Grayscale.\n\nFidelity was instead brought up in the announcement regarding the launch of EDX Markets, the new crypto exchange to look out for. Fidelity is joined by Charles Schwab and Citadel Securities in backing the new crypto exchange.\n\nEDXM, however, is planning on only allowing trades of Bitcoin, LiteCoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum, which are the only cryptocurrencies the SEC doesn\u2019t mind being traded by these companies.\n\nEven more interestingly, Valkyrie, a financial services company with assets managed worth over $80 billion, has filed for Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR) with the SEC. The idea is to bridge the old financial system, Traditional Finance (TradFi), and the new one, Decentralized Finance (DeFi). As a result, by investing money into Valkyrie, investors are staking their funds on Bitcoin managed by the financial institution.\n\nHigher Demand, Lower Supply\n\nKnowing that Bitcoin is bound to increase in value following all the news above, the demand for its purchase caused a higher-than-usual outflow. Some trading prices spotted included $30,000, $31,000, $32,000, and even $40,000.\n\nA similar outflow occurred during the first couple of weeks in June, but that\u2019s because some hodlers were panic selling, fearing a slump in value.\n\nWhether this rising value trend will continue is technically anyone\u2019s guess. However, all signs show a consistently increasing interest in the market, especially from the corporate side.\n\nCorporations such as Blackrock, Fidelity, and Valkyrie would naturally want to get their hands on the biggest sum of Bitcoin possible, enabling themselves to control market prices and flow.\n\nWith only a limited amount of Bitcoin available, the supply of the cryptocurrency is bound to shrink significantly in the upcoming period, causing its price to soar."

        "content": "Illustration by TradingView\n\nAfter facing some headwinds since April this year at around the $30,000 mark, Bitcoin has been making a bit of a comeback this week. Since the week began, BTC has logged a more than 14% gain in a positive sign for the space. BTC is now sitting at a price of around $30,000, with some analysts suggesting that the cryptocurrency could soon cross back over the $30,400 mark, and if it were to break through $31,035 \u2013 it would be the highest BTC price seen since June 2022.\n\nThe cause of the optimism lies in the recent spot Bitcoin ETF filings, which have been made by major institutional players such as BlackRock. Whether those ETFs will be approved however, is a different story. Firstly because they would be the first of their kind and secondly because the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) (which would be responsible for approving them) has been taking a decidedly anti-crypto stance recently with its latest enforcement actions against major crypto exchanges such as Binance.\n\n(About Bitcoin)\n\nBitcoin is the original decentralized digital currency that was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It operates on a decentralized peer-to-peer network, meaning that transactions can occur directly between users without the need for intermediaries like banks. Bitcoin uses cryptography to secure transactions and to control the creation of new units of the currency. Transactions are recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain, which allows anyone to verify the validity of a transaction and the ownership of bitcoins. The total supply of bitcoins is limited to 21 million, which is expected to be reached around the year 2140. Bitcoin's price is highly volatile, and it has experienced numerous boom and bust cycles over the years."

This is in keeping with its cautious approach to the crypto market. In fact, last week the SEC sued two crypto exchanges, Coinbase and Binance, on the basis that they have failed to register as a securities trading venue.\n\nThe SEC maintains that digital assets should be treated the same way as conventional securities and subject to the same rules.\n\nThe likes of Binance and Coinbase have pressed for a new regulatory framework that caters specifically for digital or crypto assets.\n\nThe licence applications have led to speculation that the SEC might approve its first crypto ETF which in turn has seen a bump in the price of bitcoin which rose from less than $25,000 to more than $26,000 in the immediate aftermath of the BlackRock application.\n\nBitcoin has since surged beyond $30,000 for the first time since April and only the second time in 2023.\n\nIt is not the first time that asset managers have made such an application to the SEC. WisdomTree has seen its application rejected twice (in December 2021 and October 2022) due to concerns about fraud and market manipulation.\n\nBlackRock has attempted to assuage these fears by entering into a \u201csurveillance sharing agreement\u201d with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange futures markets.\n\nAnd WisdomTree has adopted a similar strategy, stating that it is willing to also enter a surveillance agreement with the operator of a US-based spot trading platform for Bitcoin."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe rest of the market has caught the wave as Bitcoin today broke above $29,000\u2014the first time since May\u2014following a number of high-profile exchange-traded fund (ETF) filings in the States.\n\nThat means a couple of usually sleepy altcoins are surging.\n\nBitcoin Cash, a Bitcoin spin-off which has struggled to find a market since launching in 2017, is the third-best performing cryptocurrency in the past day: It's up 26% in 24 hours, trading for over $130, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency, is only up by about 10% in the past day.\n\nBitcoin Cash's price surge might have something to do with it being one of the assets offered by EDX Markets\u2014a new exchange backed by Fidelity, Charles Schwab and Citadel Securities which launched yesterday.\n\nThe exchange is aiming to draw in institutional clients by \"bringing the best of traditional finance to cryptocurrency markets,\" in the words of its CEO Jamil Nazarali.\n\nAccording to CoinGecko data, a third of the Bitcoin Cash trading is taking place on the world's biggest crypto exchange, Binance, with investors primarily executing their BCH trades with stablecoin Tether.\n\nOther altcoins jumping in price include Stacks (STX), the native token powering the Bitcoin-adjacent Stacks blockchain, which is up more than 19%, trading for around $0.75.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd recent degen darling Pepe, a meme coin which launched in April and experienced an explosion in price, is also one of the best performing cryptocurrencies: It's up more than 18% in 24 hours.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap today is $1.19 Trillion, a 6.5% increase in 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.\n\nBitcoin surged past $30,000 per coin in April\u2014the first time it had done so in 10 months. But it struggled to maintain its momentum as regulatory headwinds frightened away investors. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has hit a number of major crypto companies with lawsuits this year, including Binance and Coinbase.\n\nBut the asset is now fast closing in on the $30,000 mark again, and was trading for $29,473 at the time of writing."

        "content": "Bitcoin price jumped to a six-week high as sentiment in the crypto market improved after interest from major players from the traditional financial sector.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest digital asset gained over 7% to above $28,850.

        "content": "Good morning. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening:\n\nPrices: Bitcoin surged over $30.7K before settling nearer to $30K as investors savored news of multiple spot bitcoin ETF filings.\n\nInsights: Crypto has been \"going through a crisis of confidence, but recent filings for spot bitcoin ETFs have helped energize crypto markets, says eToro U.S. investment analyst Callie Cox.\n\nPrices\n\nCoinDesk Market Index (CMI)\n\n1,235\n\n+53.7 \u25b2 4.5%\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\n$30,139\n\n+1368.5 \u25b2 4.8%\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\n$1,916\n\n+108.3 \u25b2 6.0%\n\nS&P 500\n\n4,365.69\n\n\u221223.0 \u25bc 0.5%\n\nGold\n\n$1,944\n\n+8.3 \u25b2 0.4%\n\nNikkei 225\n\n33,575.14\n\n+186.2 \u25b2 0.6%\n\nBTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)\n\nBitcoin Returns to Its Perch Above $30K\n\nAfter weeks of gloom, bitcoin surged for a second consecutive day as investors drew confidence from spot BTC ETF applications by BlackRock and other large asset management firms.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $30,140, up nearly 5% over the past 24 hours. BTC last cracked the $30,000 threshold in April.\n\nBitcoin began rising Tuesday after the long, U.S. Juneteenth holiday weekend as markets more fully digested the impact of the BlackRock filing. Later in the day, spot bitcoin re-filings by Invesco and WisdomTree brightened the mood further, offering the latest evidence of institutional investors' growing interest in the crypto space even as markets have struggled amid an uncertain regulatory environment, pesky inflation and other macroeconomic woes.\n\nRead More: Invesco Reapplies for Bitcoin ETF, Advocates for More Crypto Investment Products\n\n\u201cThere is a wave of optimism in the crypto market now that big institutional players are working to take part in the industry in a big way,\" Nihar Neelakanti, the CEO and co-founder of carbon-backed digital collectibles Ecosapiens, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.\n\nStory continues\n\nNeelakanti also also noted \"rumors\" that Fidelity might also apply for an ETF. On Tuesday, a Fidelity spokesperson told CoinDesk that the firm had not publicly announced any plans to file. Invesco, which has $1.4 trillion in assets under management, filed its application in conjunction with digital asset manager Galaxy Digital. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected WisdomTree's first spot bitcoin ETF application in 2022.\n\n\"These players, among other big names, are obviously going to add a lot of liquidity to the market and make investors more confident to buy bitcoin again,\" Neelakanti wrote. \"And big institutions partnering with crypto are going to continue to be a catalyst for bitcoin for the foreseeable future, even as the U.S. regulatory situation continues to cause some hardship for the industry.\"\n\nEther enjoyed a similarly upbeat Wednesday to continue its momentum. The second largest crypto in market value was recently changing hands above $1,900 for the first time in three weeks, up more than 6% from Tuesday, same time. Other large cryptos spent the day in deep green territory with ADA and MATIC, the native cryptos of smart contract platforms Cardano and Polygon, each up more than 7%, along with popular memecoin DOGE. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, was recently up more than 5%.\n\nU.S. stocks veered from their weeks-long winning ways to tick down with tech stocks leading the decline. The technology heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500, closed off 1.2% and 0.5%, respectively. Asia markets opened on a sour note with the Hang Seng and Shanghai indexes recently falling about 2% and 1.3%, respectively\n\nEcosapiens' Neelakanti believes that TradFi will take advantage of \"regulatory pressure on crypto\" to unveil new digital asset initiatives, although he is uncertain of these partnerships long-term benefit. He added, however that every crypto \"wave\" has drawn new participants.\n\n\"The last wave was a lot of retail speculators, and this fits a pattern of how new asset classes develop over time,\" he wrote. \"You have early believers, then more retail people, and then the third wave of more institutions getting into the fold. We\u2019re starting to see the beginnings of the third wave now. And this wave will include the big institutions, but also 401Ks and other major types of funds like pension funds and university endowments.\u201d\n\nBiggest Gainers\n\nBiggest Losers\n\nThere are no losers in CoinDesk 20 today.\n\nInsights\n\nCrypto's \"Crisis of Confidence\" and the Rush of Spot Bitcoin ETF Filings\n\nCryptos have been \"going through a crisis of confidence,\" yet the past week's \"rush of filings for spot bitcoin ETFs has returned \"some excitement\" into the markets, especially into \"well-known,\" quality coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum,\" Callie Cox, U.S. investment analyst for social investing platform eToro, told CoinDesk TV's \"First Mover\" program on Wednesday.\n\n\"Institutional lenders, where this industry grows, whether you like it or not, that's the history for many emerging markets,\" Cox said. \"And the fact that some of the largest issuers in the world are stepping in and saying, 'we want to offer this product,' tells you something about pent-up demand, or demand from investors who might not be comfortable trading spot crypto.\"\n\nLast Thursday, the iShares unit of fund management giant BlackRock (BLK) filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the formation of a spot bitcoin (BTC) ETF. Earlier this week, investment management companies Invesco (IVZ) and WisdomTree refiled for spot ETFs.\n\nIVZ, which has $1.4 trillion assets under management, is working in conjunction with digital asset manager Galaxy Digital. It first filed for a spot bitcoin ETF in 2021. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) denied WisdomTree's first application 2022, amid a flurry of rejections.\n\nThe surge in institutional interest followed closely after ongoing U.S. regulatory scrutiny seemed to reach new heights earlier this month with SEC lawsuits against exchanges Binance and Coinbase, leaving markets in a funk.\n\nAfter rising strongly over the first four months of the year, bitcoin, ether and most other major assets inched downward with BTC recently dropping below $25,000 for the first time since mid March as investors contemplated the SEC's increasing scrutiny, inflation and other macroeconomic uncertainties. But even as the wider environment clouded over, institutional interest has continued to percolate.\n\nCox views the ETFs as \"a positive sign,\" and believes the market is as well. \"It shows that Wall Street still believes in certain parts of crypto and that it's not like the price of Bitcoin is going to zero. We need to understand what the value is. There is value.\"\n\nImportant events.\n\n3:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(7:30 UTC) Swiss National Bank Interest Rate Decision\n\n7:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(11:00 UTC) England Monetary Policy Summary\n\n7:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(23:30 UTC) Japan National CPI ex-Fresh Food (YoY/May)\n\nCoinDesk TV\n\nIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of \"First Mover\" on CoinDesk TV:\n\nBitcoin Briefly Tops $29K as Invesco Reapplies for Bitcoin ETF; Jack Dorsey\u2019s Block Bitcoin Wallet Plans\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market value, rallied over the past 24 hours after various traditional finance firms announced moves into the crypto market, indicating bullish sentiment. eToro US investment analyst Callie Cox shared her crypto markets analysis. Plus, Lindsey Grossman, the business lead at Bitkey, Block's bitcoin wallet, joined \"First Mover\" to discuss teaming up with Coinbase and Cash App, along with the launch of Bitkey\u2019s external beta sign-ups.
