        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), sought comments on a rule change that will allow it to decide the fate of spot Bitcoin (BTCUSD) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), effectively delaying the call on approving Ark Invest's Ark21Shares Bitcoin ETF.\n\nKey Takeaways The SEC has delayed a decision on the Ark21 Shares Bitcoin ETF, as the regulatory agency gathers more public comments regarding one of the amendments in the application.\n\nThis delay could push a decision on the Bitcoin spot ETF into 2024.\n\nWhile a number of bitcoin ETFs based around futures products already exist, a large number of spot-based bitcoin ETF applications were recently submitted following a new proposal from BlackRock.\n\nThe SEC's Decision to Delay\n\nThe SEC has invited public comments on the Ark21 Shares Bitcoin ETF proposal, a joint project from ARK Invest and 21 Shares. Specifically, the SEC would like interested parties to share their views on whether a spot bitcoin ETF may be susceptible to manipulation and whether the levels of liquidity and transparency in the bitcoin market are sufficient to avoid potential manipulation.\n\nThe SEC's original deadline for a decision on the spot bitcoin ETF application was August 13. Now, a final decision may get kicked into 2024. The SEC has previously rejected several spot Bitcoin ETF applications; however, several bitcoin ETFs based on futures contracts already exist.\n\n\n\nThe Ark21Shares Bitcoin ETF would track the performance of bitcoin as measured by the S&P Bitcoin Index, which uses data from several crypto exchanges. The fund would hold bitcoin directly and be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange.\n\nEarlier this month, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood predicted that her firm and 21 Shares's proposal would be delayed by the SEC in an interview with Bloomberg. Additionally, Wood predicted several spot bitcoin ETFs would eventually be approved simultaneously.\n\nAll Eyes on Blackrock's Bitcoin ETF Application\n\nA slew of spot bitcoin ETF proposals were made in June after Blackrock (BLK) entered the fray for the first time with their proposal. Many market commentators saw BlackRock's entry into the spot bitcoin ETF market as a sign that approval from the SEC could be around the corner due to their pivotal role in the U.S. financial system.\n\nEarlier this week, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz claimed his contacts at BlackRock indicated they expected approval on their spot bitcoin ETF proposal within six months.\n\nWhile the SEC has taken a more critical approach to the crypto industry this year, bitcoin has mostly remained immune to the crackdown, as it is the only crypto asset that current chair Gary Gensler has clearly stated is not a security."

        "content": "SEC Chair Gary Gensler participates in a meeting of the Financial Stability Oversight Council at the U.S. Treasury in Washington, D.C., July 28, 2023.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has delayed a decision on the Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, the latest roadblock in a years-long fight to trade crypto assets directly on traditional U.S. financial exchanges.\n\nThe deadline for the SEC to make some sort of decision on the fund was Aug. 13. The regulator said in a filing Friday that it is seeking public comment on one of the amendments in the application for the exchange-traded fund, effectively pushing out the date a decision is needed for approval. The process may now stretch into 2024.\n\nThe Ark 21Shares fund is seen as the first in line for a potential bitcoin ETF launch, though the SEC could choose to approve many funds at roughly the same time if it does decide to allow them. Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood told Bloomberg News earlier this week that she expected the SEC to make a decision on multiple funds at once.\n\nApplications from other major organizations, including BlackRock and WisdomTree, have already been filed. Crypto investment firm Grayscale is still awaiting a court decision after the SEC repeatedly rejected its proposal to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF.\n\nThe Cboe BZX exchange filed with the SEC for a rule change in April that would allow the listing of the Ark21 spot bitcoin fund. The filing has since been amended several times and now includes a surveillance-sharing provision that was introduced in BlackRock's filing for a bitcoin fund.\n\nThe SEC has rejected dozens of prior applications to create a spot bitcoin ETF, and SEC Chair Gary Gensler appeared to be leading a crackdown against the crypto industry earlier this year.\n\nBut there are signs that momentum is shifting toward the crypto industry, including a partial legal victory for Ripple that cast doubt on the SEC's efforts to classify most crypto assets as securities.\n\nThe SEC has already allowed the launch of several bitcoin futures ETFs.\n\nThe price of bitcoin was little changed Friday, trading above $29,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "When cryptomining comes to town: High electricity use spillovers to the local economy - CEPR",
        "content": "High energy use is increasingly a feature of many technology processing industries, including quantum computing, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and cryptocurrency mining (\u2018cryptomining\u2019). Estimates suggest that technology processing passed the milestone of consuming 1% of world energy in 2010 and is on trajectory to increase to 6% by 2030 (Masanet et al. 2020, Andrae and Edler 2015). In recent years, data centres and Bitcoin mining alone consumed 0.9% and 0.5% of global electricity, respectively (Andrae 2017, Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance).\n\nThis intensive electricity consumption results in two negative externalities. The first is the carbon emissions resulting from electricity production of cryptomining, with the website Digiconomist estimating that the global CO2 emissions from Bitcoin mining alone are equivalent to those of Libya (see also De Vries 2018, Blandin et al. 2020).\n\nOur work concerns a second, unstudied externality \u2013 the real effects of technology processing on local economies (Benetton et al. 2023). What, for example, are the spillovers from cryptomining on households and small businesses? How does the interaction of supply and demand impact prices and delivery of electricity to homes and small businesses? As we shall see below, cryptomining also has positive externalities in that cryptomines produce local tax revenues, raising questions about net costs and benefits.\n\nBefore describing our methodology and findings, a brief note about cryptomining, which is the clearing of payment transactions for decentralised blockchain-based cryptocurrencies that rely on the \u2018proof-of-work\u2019 protocol. Any person or firm can become a cryptominer, which involves solving increasingly complex computational puzzles to verify the validity of transactions. This has led to an arms race among firms who run large cryptomines, essentially warehouses full of specialized computers, crunching numbers across the world. And the key point here is that these cryptomines need lots of electricity, while employing very few people.\n\nA tale of two channels\n\nWe analyse the negative externalities of the high electricity use of cryptomining through two channels: prices and quantity rationing.\n\nChannel #1: Analysing negative externalities via prices\n\nIn the first case, we study New York State, specifically Upstate NY, excluding New York City and Long Island, which was an early market for cryptomining in the US due to its cold climate, cheap electricity, and proximity to large hydropower sources (see Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Bitcoin prices and electricity consumption\n\nNote: This Figure shows monthly electricity consumption for businesses in the town of Plattsburgh, NY, and the neighbouring town of Peru. Before the end of 2017, Plattsburgh and Peru experienced a similar pattern in electricity consumption for businesses. However, in January 2018, when the Bitcoin price peaked, electricity consumption by Plattsburgh businesses increased by almost 150%, whereas almost no change to the seasonal pattern occurred in Peru. The blue line shows the average price of Bitcoin each month. The red dash-dot line and the green dash line show total electricity consumption by small and industrial businesses in Plattsburgh and Peru, respectively. We normalise electricity consumption in each town to 100 in December 2017, which is the month in which Bitcoin prices reached their maximum of around $15,000. Gray areas denote December, January and February of 2016-2017 and 2017-2018.\n\nThe region\u2019s grid operator employs a marginal supply pricing algorithm, whereby upward pressure on prices from demand gets passed to all users, including households and small businesses. We combine detailed data on these local electricity prices, electricity usage, and other economic outcomes with hand-collected data on the likely location of cryptominers, to analyse whether and how the use of electricity by cryptominers affects local communities.\n\nOur findings include the following:\n\nWhen Bitcoin prices are high, the returns from cryptomining are higher in expectation since the reward to miners is paid in Bitcoins. Thus, a higher Bitcoin price increases the demand for electricity by cryptominers.\n\nThere is a statistically significant, negative price elasticity of demand for electricity by the local communities, meaning that as the price of electricity rises, demand falls. These higher prices also lead to larger surpluses for electricity producers.\n\nThere is a positive and significant effect of cryptomining on tax generation. Treated communities experience a relative increase in taxes per capita by $6 compared to control communities when the price of Bitcoin increases by 100%. To put these numbers in perspective, the price of Bitcoin increased from about $600 in 2016 to $7,500 in 2018, which could have led to higher taxes per capita in cryptomining communities by about $70, or 14% of the average tax revenue per capita.\n\nCryptomining leads the average household and small business in New York to pay an extra $88 and $168 in their electricity bills per year, respectively. In aggregate, Upstate NY households and small businesses pay $204 million and $92 million more annually, respectively.\n\nWhen accounting for the differential increase in government revenues, cryptomining towns in Upstate NY generate almost $40 million in additional government revenues, thus recovering about 14% of the losses. As a result, we estimate a net consumer surplus loss of $257 million in Upstate NY.\n\nChannel #2: Analysing negative externalities via quantity rationing\n\nWe now turn to China, a country that employed a quantity rationing system for electricity, and which hosted 65\u201382% of the world\u2019s cryptomining during the last decade before a ban in 2021. In a quantity rationing system, when total demand increases, prices do not adjust; rather, the electricity supply is rationed among locations to align with physical infrastructure. To explore possible externalities associated with the rationing of electricity in local economies, we exploit an annual panel of statistics at the city level for China (cities in the data include the surrounding areas). We focus on the 218 inland China city-areas, which have a mean population of 355,000, and do not include the large coastal metropolitan areas. There is evidence of cryptomining in 52 of these inland city-areas, of which we find the following:\n\nAfter cryptomining enters a city, local fixed asset investments decline annually by 19%, and wage levels decline by 10%, suggesting that cryptomining tends to crowd out other business uses of electricity.\n\nThese results also suggest that the crowded-out industrial uses of electricity would have led to larger investments in the physical and human capital of the local economy in the years following the entry of cryptomining. To put a number on it, cryptomining entry is associated with a statistically significant drop in local GDP of 8.2%.\n\nTaken together, these findings suggest that local economies could suffer as a result of crowding out in the electricity market.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe present novel empirical evidence of the real effects of cryptomining on local economies.\n\nFirst, we focus on a setting in Upstate New York, where cryptomining led to an increase in electricity prices and a resultant consumer surplus loss. On the other hand, local governments saw an increase in tax revenues, although this only offsets a fraction of the consumer surplus loss through higher electricity prices. We then turn to China, where we reveal a negative impact on the labor market as well as fixed asset investments.\n\nWhat does this mean for policymakers? Though likely tempting for some, the optimal response is likely not to ban cryptomining, which would only shift the problem to a more permissive jurisdiction and restrict any possible tax revenue gains. Rather, a better response would be to introduce electricity pricing schemes or dynamic quotas that minimise the adverse impact on the local community. In addition, the effects on local communities we document should be weighed against any other costs (notably, from pollution) and potential benefits arising from the growth of proof-of-work cryptocurrencies.\n\nReferences\n\nAndrae, A (2017), \u201cTotal consumer power consumption forecast\u201d, Nordic Digital Business Summit 10.\n\nAndrae, A S G and T Edler (2015), \u201cOn Global Electricity Usage of Communication Technology: Trends to 2030\u201d, Challenges 6(1): 117-157.\n\nBenetton, M, G Compiani and A Morse (2023), \u201cWhen Cryptomining Comes to Town: High Electricity-use Spillovers to the Local Economy\u201d, NBER Working Paper 31312.\n\nBlandin, A, G Pieters, Y Wu, T Eisermann, A Dek, S Taylor and D Njoki (2020), \u201cThird global cryptoasset benchmarking study\u201d, Technical report, Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, University of Cambridge, Judge Business School.\n\nDe Vries, A (2018), \u201cBitcoin's growing energy problem\u201d, Joule 2(5): 801-805.\n\nMasanet, E, A Shehabi, N Lei, S Smith, and J Koomey (2020), \u201cRecalibrating global data center energy-use estimates\u201d, Science 367(6481): 984-986."

        "content": "Bitcoin rose 0.79% from Aug. 4 to Aug. 11 to US$29,362 as of 7:20 p.m. Friday in Hong Kong. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization briefly rose above US$30,000 twice this week, before falling below the support level. Ether rgained 0.72% over the week to US$1,846, remaining below the US$1,900 support level since July 23.\n\n\u201cBitcoin began the week quietly. In recent months, crypto volatility has somewhat lessened as investors view the stock market as a better trading vehicle due to the fact that there has been better price action on the stock market,\u201d Lucas Kiely, chief investment officer of digital asset platform Yield App, told Forkast.\n\nMonday brought some much-needed excitement to the crypto space after California-based payments giant PayPal announced the launch of its U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The company said that PayPal USD (PYUSD) aims to bridge the gap between fiat currencies and the blockchain for consumers and merchants.\n\n\u201cPaypal has joined an impressive list of major financial institutions which are entering the crypto market,\u201d Alex Konanykhin, the chief executive officer and founder of Unicoin, an equity-backed crypto that pays dividends, told Forkast.\n\n\u201cThis trend is a major distinction of the current crypto rally from the previous ones, which were fueled by individual crypto enthusiasts.\u201d\n\nBitcoin briefly rose to a weekly high of US$30,144 on Wednesday, two days after PayPal\u2019s announcement, but fell below US$30,000 later that day.\n\nPayPal\u2019s new stablecoin will make it easier for the masses to gain exposure to Bitcoin, according to Phillip Lord, president of crypto payment app Oobit.\n\n\u201cPayPal\u2019s stablecoin is massive news. It will bring a lot more American users into the market for payments and day-to-day use, which will filter into the rest of the [crypto] ecosystem,\u201c said Lord, in a statement shared with Forkast.\n\nOn Wednesday, Coinbase Global announced the public launch of its Ethereum layer-2 blockchain Base.\n\nThe U.S. consumer price index (CPI) report released on Thursday showed that inflation rose 3.2% from a year ago in July, with core CPI excluding food and energy prices also increasing 0.2% for the month, matching preliminary estimates.\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.17 trillion on Friday at 7:20 p.m. in Hong Kong, up 0.86% from US$1.16 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. With a market cap of US$571 billion, Bitcoin represented 48.8% of the market while Ether, valued at US$221 billion, accounted for 18.9%.\n\nNotable Movers: SHIB, RUNE\n\nThe Shiba Inu memecoin was this week\u2019s biggest gainer in the top 100, rising 16.75% to US$$0.00001002. The memecoin started picking up momentum last Friday, as investors anticipated the launch of Shibarium, an Ethereum layer-2 blockchain, scheduled for the Blockchain Futurist Conference in Toronto Aug. 13-17.\n\nRune, the native governance token of the ThorChain network, was this week\u2019s second-biggest gainer, rising 15.95% to US$1.08. Rune started its price rally on Tuesday, after ThorWallet announced the introduction of Visa Cards and Swiss bank accounts for users.\n\nAs for the week\u2019s biggest losers, XDC Network\u2019s (XDC) token fell 19.32% to US$0.06616, followed by GMX decentralized exchange\u2019s (GMX) token that declined 12.91% to US$45.11.\n\nSee related article: USDT\u2019s goal is to be the dollar, not beat it, says Tether CTO\n\nNext Week: Can Bitcoin close the week above US$29,300?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s major weekly support lies at US$29,300, according to Aziz Kenjaev, financial analyst and director of business development at cross-chain liquidity protocol Entangle.\n\n\u201cAs for the technical analysis, there\u2019s still room for the continuation of a correction down to US$28,600 if Bitcoin closes below US$29,300,\u201d Kenjaev told Forkast, referencing the below chart.\n\nNext week, investors await the release of the minutes of July\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee meeting, for insight on the U.S. Fed\u2019s interest rate decisions.\n\nThe Fed meets on Sep. 19 to make its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5.25% to 5.5%, the highest in 22 years. Analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predict a 89% chance of no interest rate hike in September, up from 87% on Thursday.\n\nIn the crypto space, Canada\u2019s ETH Toronto hackathon will open its gates on Tuesday, with notable speakers like Cosmos co-founder Ethan Buchman and pseudonymous Shiba Inu founder Shytoshi Kusama.\n\nSee related article: Hackers hit Curve, China announces blockchain link & is FTX back?"

        "content": "Consumer bitcoin provider Azteco recently announced a $6 million seed funding round at an $84M valuation led by Jack Dorsey as the company introduces bitcoin gift cards to enhance the cryptocurrency\u2019s spending power near the level of the U.S. dollar.\n\nAmid persistent inflationary pressures in the U.S., many investors are looking into digital assets as a hedge against the weakened dollar. At the same time, changing views on bitcoin are establishing the currency as a player in the American economy.\n\n\"My contribution to Azteco comes out of a deep respect for their mission. The unbanked population is immense,\" Jack Dorsey said after the funding announcement.\n\nBITCOIN ON ROAD TO $120,000 BY END OF 2024\n\n\"We have the technology and resources to close this gap, but until now, no one has taken that important next step,\" he added. \"Azteco is providing so much more than just access to a secure financial system; it is building an ecosystem of financial self-determination that is secure and supported by local communities. I am honored to support them.\"\n\nSHORT SELLER ACCUSES JACK DORSEY'S BLOCK OF FACILITATING FRAUD\n\nAlso designed to bridge geographical boundaries in the retail industry, bitcoin gift cards, or vouchers, provide in-person storefronts and e-commerce platforms around the globe while democratizing access to financial services and reshaping consumer-retailer interactions in an increasingly interconnected digital economy, according to Azteco.\n\n\"Trusting a third party as the issuer of money can result in that third party becoming a single point of failure. As the Federal Reserve and every other Fiat currency that has ever existed has proven, the incentive to cheat is irresistible. By removing this incentive through the issuer and replacing him with a computer program, bitcoin can run a politically and financially neutral, global synthetic money for people everywhere,\" Azteco CEO and founder Akin Fernandez told FOX Business.\n\nBITCOIN ON TRACK TO CHALLENGE U.S. DOLLAR?\n\nThe U.S. economy has been mired in inflation and a devalued currency, leading to a banking crisis and a raised investor interest in not only material wealth like gold and silver, but in digital assets like cryptocurrency.\n\nCentral banks and the Fed are already discussing the implementation of a digital dollar. Meanwhile, BlackRock filed for a bitcoin ETF with the Securities and Exchange Commission in June.\n\n\"The fundamental problem with the U.S. dollar is that its supply is controlled by a small committee of private bankers focused solely on the shareholders\u2019 interests. America\u2019s Constitution considers only gold and silver money, which was arguably done deliberately to remove the inevitable corruption that follows when people are in control of the money supply,\" Fernandez said.\n\nBITCOIN BONNIE AND CLYDE' PLEAD GUILTY TO MONEY LAUNDERING HACKED CRYPTO\n\n\"Bitcoin solves this problem by replacing a committee of men with an infallible computer program.\"\n\nAlready, Azteco has over 590,000 payment locations in more than 190 countries on the ground floor facilitating development.\n\nBITCOIN ON ROAD TO $120,000 BY END OF 2024\n\n\"In the U.S., an estimated 4.5% of households were \u2018unbanked\u2019 in 2021 with no access to eCommerce, meaning they couldn\u2019t buy from Amazon, get a bank loan, send money or receive it electronically. Bitcoin fixes this by giving them around-the-clock global access to a frictionless financial rail using instant transactions that are guaranteed free of payer fraud,\" Fernandez said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\"There are 2 billion people unbanked on Earth, and the country that becomes the center of this new financial system will be raking in taxes from 2 billion people,\" he continued. \"A move to bitcoin will greatly enhance the U.S. economy. America\u2019s most prosperous era was when it was on the gold standard and the money supply was strictly constrained. Strong economies are built on saving, not spending.\""

        "title": "Dogecoin Founder Calls Bitcoin Maximalists 'Mentally Ill' - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBilly Markus, a co-founder of Dogecoin, has criticized Bitcoin fans\u2019 marketing strategies, calling them \u2018mentally ill\u2019\n\nHe said there are plenty of ideological divisions within the cryptocurrency industry\n\nMarkus said he stopped investing in crypto nine years ago, right after the DOGE launch\n\nUnsurprisingly, conflicts and heated arguments frequently arise in the volatile and unpredictable world of cryptocurrency \u2013 this time between Dogecoin founder and Bitcoin maximalists. These arguments often show the variety of viewpoints within the crypto community since fervent believers drive them on all sides.\n\nDogecoin founder, who isn\u2019t one to hold back when airing his opinions, has once again criticized the advertising tactics and overarching stories that Bitcoin advocates champion.\n\nIn the brief video , Robert Breedlove, a BTC maximalist, was seen speaking with Jason Lowery, who continued praising Bitcoin. According to Lowery, BTC is not a coin; rather, it is the future of conflict, security, and those who want to protect their data.\n\nMaximalists of Bitcoin: A Better Attitude Toward Other Cryptos\n\nBitcoin (BTC) maximalists, often known as \u201cBitcoin Maxis,\u201d are ardent proponents of the cryptocurrency and firmly think that it is superior to all others. They frequently minimize or even reject the worth and potential of other tokens in the wide crypto ecosystem because of their steadfast faith in Bitcoin.\n\nMarkus cited an occasion where a BTC enthusiast was advocating the cryptocurrency in an effort to shed insight on the thinking of these Bitcoiners.\n\nThe enthusiast extended an invitation to others to join the \u201cmentally ill group of insecure losers.\u201d Such utterances offer a window into the frequently divisive opinions of some inside the crypto community.\n\nBitcoin maximalists frequently disparage competing cryptocurrencies using the nickname \u201cs-coins.\u201d The person who most exemplifies this approach is Max Keiser, a well-known member of the Bitcoin community.\n\nHe once requested that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) order major cryptocurrency exchanges to cease operations, referring to them as little more than casinos. Keiser\u2019s ideas, which are similar to those of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, extend to classifying all altcoins as securities.\n\nNotably, Keiser had vehemently asserted that XRP was bound for failure and that it was Gensler\u2019s obligation to ensure its demise before Judge Analisa Torres determined that XRP was not a security in July. These stories have influenced the SEC\u2019s recent activities as the organization has increased its examination of the top cryptocurrencies.\n\nMarkus Questions the Future of Bitcoin\n\nThe most recent criticism from Markus was in response to a video published by Udi Wertheimer, a crypto Twitter user. Interviewing Jason Lowery was Bitcoin maximalist Robert Breedlove in the video. Lowery complimented Bitcoin and emphasized its unmatched potential throughout the interview.\n\nHe continued by saying that Bitcoin is more than just a coin. Instead, he characterized it as security, the future of warfare, and a guarantee for people who want to keep their data private.\n\nman bitcoiners are the literal worst at marketing \u201ccome join our clearly mentally ill group of insecure losers!\u201d \u2014 Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) August 12, 2023\n\nMarkus, though, appears to have a strong problem with the content of the video based on his comments. Dogecoin founder\u2019s answer, therefore, supports the idea that innovation is not just restricted to Bitcoin. In the cryptocurrency sector, several additional coins and protocols provide distinctive solutions and show great promise.\n\nNot the First Time Markus Takes a Jab on BTC\n\nIn April this year, Markus criticized Bitcoin as a currency, claiming there isn\u2019t enough for everyone.\n\nThe inventor of the most well-known memecoin on the market recently took to Twitter to criticize cryptocurrency and non-fungible token (NFT) investors, claiming that doing so amounts to investing in mental illness.\n\ninvesting in crypto is literally just investing in mental illness which i suppose is on the rise, so\u2026 \u2014 Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) April 22, 2023\n\nThe world is getting dumber and sadder by the day, said Markus, adding that \u201cinvesting in cryptocurrencies is literally investing in a mental illness, which I assume is on the rise.\u201d\n\nMarkus then claimed that since non-fungible tokens (NFT) are a derivative of cryptocurrencies, investing in them causes people to become \u201ceven more mentally ill\u201d when challenged about doing so.\n\nMarkus responded to criticism of his restrictions by saying he was disgusted by the investors who, in his view, quarrel, behave erratically, and make poor choices as a result of an issue with the brain.\n\nAllegedly Owns Very Little DOGE\n\nThe Dogecoin creator\u2019s remarks have been provoking a flood of criticism from irate investors, who claimed that Markus was merely venting his rage at not being able to become wealthy with cryptocurrencies despite having knowledge of the sector for almost a decade.\n\nShortly after Dogecoin\u2019s debut, the project\u2019s inventor said he quit investing in cryptocurrencies nine years ago. because he thinks investing in digital currency is just another form of gambling for people. Additionally, he rejects Bitcoin as a kind of money.\n\nOn Reddit, he revealed he no longer represents the Dogecoin Foundation and owns very little Dogecoin.\n\nFor his criticism of Dogecoin supporter and billionaire Elon Musk, Jackson Palmer was blocked by Markus last year on Twitter. Palmer slammed Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, for his coding abilities and said he used cryptocurrency to inflate his ego.\n\nThe majority of cryptocurrency investors, who think that digital currencies are the future of banking and investing, hold the opposite perspective to Markus\u2019 criticism of cryptocurrency investing.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough Bitcoin continues to lead the way in the cryptocurrency world, many different types exist. Billy Markus reminds the public that creativity is not limited to a certain token or protocol. Understanding and appreciating the numerous prospects and potentials presented by different cryptocurrencies is crucial as the cryptosphere continues to develop. The continuous arguments and conflicts, like the one between Markus and Bitcoin maximalists, show stakeholders\u2019 passion and commitment to their individual coins."

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) delay in deciding whether to approve a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States is fueling expectations that a final verdict will come in a batch that includes key players on Wall Street, including BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of pressure on the SEC to approve a number of these ETFs, particularly because the approved Futures backed products are lagging spot performance substantially, harming investors,\u201d markets veteran and co-founder of CoinRoutes Dave Weisberger told Cointelegraph, adding that all pending applications will likely be included in a final decision.\n\nThe SEC is analyzing a total of eight applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF, following past delays and denials of the crypto product in recent years. Companies up for a decision are ARK Invest and 21Shares, Bitwise, BlackRock, VanEck, WisdomTree, Invesco and Galaxy Digital, Fidelity, and Valkyrie. Together, the firms manage over $15 trillion in global assets.\n\nOn Aug. 11, the U.S. markets regulator opened a 21-day comment period for the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF. As per the filing, the SEC is seeking answers on whether ARK 21Shares\u2019 proposal is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, as well as whether the Bitcoin (BTC) market is susceptible to manipulation.\n\nFurthermore, the regulator raised concerns about Coinbase\u2019s surveillance-sharing agreement, asking commenters to examine whether Coinbase\u2019s participation in the ETF's surveillance would, in fact, help to detect, investigate and deter fraud and manipulation in Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s main concern about spot crypto ETFs is about the potential market manipulation by a big whale. Theoretically, it can happen if the SEC approves the ETFs of one or two investment funds. But if it decides to register all 8 ETFs, it will sharply mitigate the probability of manipulation, because these firms will be able to trade with each other frequently, taking opposite sides,\" explained Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler.\n\nSEC application timeline for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Source: Bloomberg Intelligence/James Seyffart\n\nThe delay had a lesser impact on Bitcoin\u2019s price, hovering around the $30,000 mark at the time of writing. According to Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of crypto lending platform Ledn, traders and investors are \u201cexpecting [the SEC] to take all the time they could,\" with today\u2019s decision having a low impact \u201cin terms of market expectations.\"\n\nThe SEC still has two deadlines before a final decision is made. The third deadline for the ARK 21Shares application is due by January 2024. Valkyrie has the latest application in line, with two upcoming deadlines in January and March next year.\n\nThe BTC ETF outcome could reshape the crypto investment landscape. According to Lienkha, an approval could potentially bring over $70 billion in liquidity to the Bitcoin market. \u201cThe opportunity to invest in Bitcoin through ETFs will give regular investors more confidence, as with professional help, they don\u2019t have to dive into all the technical details and analyze potential risks by themselves,\" he noted.\n\nMagazine: Should you \u2018orange pill\u2019 children?

        "content": "The producer price index rose 0.3% in July which was hotter than expected. Joining us now to discuss how the crypto markets are reacting is innovating capital, general partner, Anthony Georgia. Welcome to the show. Anthony, thanks for having me. Great to be here. Awesome to have you here. I just said we're going to take a look at how the crypto markets are reacting, but we took a look at a few charts at the beginning of the show and it looks like they are relatively unmoved. Are you surprised to see that this morning? Uh It is a little bit interesting, you know, when you look at futures right now in the equities market, you know, NASDAQ looks like it's down almost, you know, 70 basis points S and P is down about 25 30 basis points. And, you know, I think the data between yesterday and today um starts to really kind of signal fears that, you know, there might not necessarily be so much of a soft economic landing here and that, you know, potentially the guidance and certainty in terms of where terminal rates will shake out on a monetary policy perspective is a little uneasy now. Um Just given the fact that it does seem that costs more than anything are going to stay where they are for quite some time on the digital asset side. It's fascinating to see that the markets are relatively unchanged and, and haven't necessarily responded to this as negatively. I think that has to do more with the fact that the digital asset market has largely priced in a lot of the monetary policy, fears and uncertainty in terminal rates and we probably would have saw much more of a movement upwards. Um Given where data came in. Do you think we're going to see? Um another rate hike? I do think that the guidance from terminal rates in the range of, you know, 500 to 600 basis points will stay where it is. And I think the bigger fear of what we saw today is there's still more work to do. Um these are not data points that suggests by any means that we are at the point in time where both the current environment um in terms of interest rates as well as the duration in which rates have been hiked has been enough to bring costs down. Um Economics are starting to caution that housing costs are unlikely to help drop dramatically moving forward. You see certain depressed prices in areas. Um but those aren't necessarily expected to keep dropping if you look at things like medical care or airline fares or things like that. So, while future pricing, you know, may suggest that we won't necessarily see a raise in interest rates. It isn't necessarily suggesting the converse might be true in which we would see maybe a cut in rates either. And I think that's what the market is actually more so ascertaining right now. All right, let's transition back to the crypto markets and talk about matrix ports, Bitcoin, greed and Fear Index. It's suggesting that there could be a bull revival in Bitcoin. Uh What's your short term outlook on Bitcoin? What might we see it do? Uh leading up? Well, in the second half of the year, there's really three large catalysts that we're mindful to as it pertains to the Bitcoin price, as well as the broader digital asset pricing in the market, first and foremost monetary policy, which we just touched on. Um Second to that really has to do with some of the broader global currency risk and fears hyper inflation continuing to spiral out of control some of the de dollarization that we saw over the last several months and earlier this year with the banking debacle that's really played a significant role and revitalizing this sort of thesis around Bitcoin and certain digital assets behaving more like a safe haven commodity and overall idiosyncratic asset to acquire that doesn't necessarily have those same features as monetary policy based currencies around the world. The third is really on a regulator side obviously a bill that's going through Congress right now, that really sets the stage to eliminate what we've seen as enforcement centric regulation by certain legislators in the US. And moving more towards having clear cut guidelines that will pave the way for both institutional adoption, retail adoption, day to day consumption and activity of digital assets, as well as really propelling some of the innovation into the markets. We're starting to see big players, you know, Schwab Black Rock, you name it that are starting to really jump into the space with some of that clear guideline that's been established. Yes. Speaking of catalysts and hype matrix report also predicts that the SEC is going to approve several spot. Bitcoin ETF s, what's your take on on the hype around these? Do you think we're going to see several approvals before the end of the year? You know, it's, it's always tough to really rationalize how much of certain of this activity is, is adequately priced into the market and what the incremental impact would be, you know, in terms of pricing in the news versus the actual reality of things. I think generally speaking, setting up for spot based assets and derivatives versus ones in the past that were purely cash settled is extremely important just in terms of the overall demand and really sets the stage for global adoption of Bitcoin at scale to the extent that we're already seeing in certain emerging economies and established economies across the world, whether it's Argentina or Turkey. And really quickly, I want to get your thoughts here on alt coins. Uh We had a report on coin desk that says a bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern is forming. What do you, what do you think about alt coins? Do you think we're gonna see them break out? I don't necessarily always, you know, suggest that um users trade off of pure technical patterns particularly in a market that has only been around for a decade. And how many, you know, technical patterns are we able to really leverage and, and that sort of analysis and speculation, I would say from the al coin perspective, overall, there are a ton of fundamentals. Um And I think that what we've seen is, you know, the baby has really gotten thrown out with the bath water over the last couple of years and it's led to a lot of suppression and pricing. Um And I do think that there are certain coins out there that will really be fundamental players in the broader web, three ecosystem over the next few years that do have some intrinsic value behind them. Um So, you know, I wouldn't necessarily be surprised if the market, especially as those catalysts that we talked about, start to really play out, starts to really reprice certain of these assets. And, you know, of course, you'll see overall systematic movement in the market. Um But I do think certain key players will really be large beneficiaries of that. All right, Anthony, we're gonna have to leave it there. Thanks for joining the show and I hope you have a great weekend. You as well. Thank you. That was innovating capital, general partner, Anthony Georgia."

This includes the Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) of the United States. This time around, the NFP data is expected to cause a dip in the value of BTC.\n\nUS NFP: Forecasting an increase\n\nThe forecasts regarding the November figures of the Nonfarm Payrolls are currently at 180,000, marking an increase from October\u2019s 150,000. This would mean that the unemployment rate would remain unchanged at 3.9%.\n\nThe NFP report has proven to have a considerable impact on the crypto prices, just as it has on other investment classes. Strong jobs reports, i.e. increase in jobs, tend to strengthen the dollar as the increase is a sign of a stronger economy. This has a negative impact on stocks, commodities, etc, and since crypto happens to share a positive correlation with the share market, particularly BTC, it faces correction.\n\nConversely, a weak NFP report proves to provide a bullish outlook for crypto since a lower-than-expected increase in jobs weakens the US Dollar, causing a rally for stock and other markets.\n\nFurthermore, in the event the NFP figures are stronger than expected, the Federal Reserve tends to keep the interest rates high. This is done in order to tighten the monetary policy to control inflation. Thus, even if the Fed doesn't increase the rates in the next meeting, they might keep it stable at 5.25% to 5.50%.\n\nConsequently, Bitcoin price will most likely face correction; however, given the bullish developments in the stock markets, including the potential spot BTC ETF approvals coming soon, the decline may not be excessive.\n\nBitcoin price to note a dip\n\nBitcoin price is presently trading at $43,241 after failing to breach $44,500, resulting in minor corrections. While at the time of writing, the broader market outlook is bullish, the short-term picture is slightly leaning toward bearish.\n\nThis is evinced by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator. The receding green bars suggest waning bullishness, which means that Bitcoin price is susceptible to a decline.\n\nHowever, BTC will, at most, fall back to $42,000 or $40,000 if the former support level is lost. This is the short-term scenario considering a stronger-than-expected NFP report.\n\nBTC/USD 12-hour chart\n\nBut if the report is weaker or the broader market cues switch to bullish, a bounce back from $42,000 is likely. This would boost the price rise, pushing Bitcoin price beyond $44,500 and invalidating the bearish thesis."

During a hearing on Aug. 11, Judge Lewis Kaplan revoked Bankman-Fried\u2019s bail and remanded him to custody, likely at the Putnam County Correctional Facility. Once his October trial begins, he could be moved to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. Bankman-Fried was reportedly led out of the courtroom in handcuffs. In Kaplan\u2019s view, Bankman-Fried\u2019s interviews with NYT reporters resulted in sharing information with the likely intention \u201cto hurt and frighten\u201d former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, his former colleague and girlfriend.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed a decision on whether to approve or disapprove the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposed by ARK Investment Management and 21Shares.

In a letter to Judge Analisa Torres \u2014 the presiding judge in the case \u2014 the SEC said it believed her decision warrants a fresh look by an appellate court. The commission asked Judge Torres to put the case on hold during the appeal, saying there are multiple other pending court cases that could be affected, depending on the appeal\u2019s outcome. The SEC is currently in a legal battle with a number of crypto firms, including Binance and Coinbase, over alleged securities violations. Judge Torres ruled, in July, that Ripple\u2019s native token, XRP, is not a security when sold to retail investors. Torres plans to schedule the jury trial for the second quarter of 2024.\n\nPayPal launches PYUSD stablecoin for payment\n\nPayPal launched a new U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin called PayPal USD (PYUSD).

The policies apply to both insured and uninsured U.S. banks supervised by the Fed. Activities regulated under the program include the custody, lending, trading, issuance or distribution of crypto including stablecoins.\n\nSEC announces $24M settlement for case against Bittrex and its former CEO\n\nThe U.S. SEC announced an agreement with crypto trading platform Bittrex and its co-founder and former CEO, William Shihara, for operating an unregistered exchange.Bittrex and Bittrex Global agreed to pay $14.4 million in disgorgement (the repayment of ill-gotten gains), $4 million in prejudgment interest, and $5.6 million in civil penalties to settle the legal dispute with the federal regulator.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitcoin spot volume is the lowest since 2021\n\nNVTS signals an extremely overvalued zone\n\nChart analysis indicates the start of a downtrend\n\nTwo scenarios ahead\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has declined from its July 13 spike of $31,800, falling to $28,477 at its lowest point today, August 1 which is a decrease of 10.65%.\n\nWith its volume sitting at its lowest since late 2020 \u2013 early 2021, and its price struggling to maintain an uptrend are we in for the start of a major downtrend?\n\nBitcoin Fundamental Analysis\n\nAs per Messari data , the Real Volume, which attempts to deduct an estimated \u201cwash trading\u201d volume from the exchange reported volume, we actually haven\u2019t seen these low levels since February 2019.\n\nWith low volume the trading price becomes uncertain or in other words, it is questionable. If the volume is high that means that more investors are participating in the assets value determination consensus \u2013 the price. And, with it being in an uptrend, it could prove to be based on weak hands.\n\nFrom July 17, we have seen an increase in Bitcoin held in exchange reserves per Cryptoquant . Although compared to the longevity of the previous downtrend, this isn\u2019t a significant rise, it could prove to be an early indication that the coin holders are starting to deposit BTC to sell.\n\nAccording to Woobull Network Valut to Transactions Signal (NVTS), we could have reached the overvalued zone.\n\nThis metric is calculated as Network Value / 90d MA of Daily Transaction Value and serves as the market top and bottom signal. Its value reached the highest level of 2.23, last seen in November 2013 when the second-ever Bitcoin bear market started.\n\nCompared to the usual high level with the price chart, we can clearly see that this metric has provided an indication of market tops and proved to foresee price drops.\n\nDoes this extreme value mean the next price drop will be even more dramatic?\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nAs the price of Bitcoin reached the ending point of an uptrend that started on November 21, 2022, two different scenarios can play out moving forward.\n\nBullish Scenario\n\nSince the November 21, 2022 low of $15,457 was a lower low compared to the June 18 same year, this would be the only point from which we can count the start of the bull cycle.\n\nNovember 21, 2022, low market, the completion of the previous downtrend from November 9, 2021, counted as a five-wave impulse of the lower degree, and the C wave from the ABC correction that started on April 13, 2021, when the price of Bitcoin was $64,227.\n\nAccording to this count, we have now seen the completion of the first bull market wave and are now waiting for the same degree correction for wave 2. Typically, wave 2 ends around the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level of wave 1, which now comes at the target of $20,340. Wave 2 can, in theory, retrace the price by 100% and still be valid, so a deeper price target could be seen.\n\nAfter the completion of this retracement which would establish the first higher low, we can potentially see the start of wave 3 and the price of Bitcoin headed into another multi-year bull cycle.\n\nBearish Scenario\n\nIn the bearish scenario, the waves are counted a bit differently, namely in the degrees and sub-degrees.\n\nIn contrast to the bullish count where the rise from November 21, 2022, is a first five-wave impulse, in a bearish scenario, it still is a five-wave impulse but of a lower degree count, which in conjunction with the recovery we have seen from June 18 \u2013 August 14 the same year, makes an ABC correction.\n\nThis ABC correction is wave 4 of the higher degree count from the five-wave impulse that started on November 9, 2021, when the price of Bitcoin reached its peak of $68,715. If this scenario is in play that would mean that the price is now headed for the starting wave 5 which is set to make a lower low compared to June 18 last year.\n\nSince the most significant support zone to the downside is around $11,000 that would be the projected target for the end of the bear market.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith low volatility, weak fundamentals, and the price chart pointing out the completion of its 232 days uptrend (November 21, 2022 \u2013 July 13, 2023), we are now going to see the start of the large descending move.\n\nAccording to the bullish count, the price of Bitcoin could fall to the $20,300 area, while in a bearish one, it could see a further low of even $11,000. It is still early to say which one is more likely, but since in the mid-term, we are expecting the move in the same direction, from its momentum and character we are going to evaluate these possibilities.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "title": "Bitcoin Just Flashed A Rare Bull Signal - $135,00 BTC Price in sight? - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nIt\u2019s the first time in history this indicator appeared\n\nMore validating will come shortly\n\nThe price target of $135,461 could be modest.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has been moving sideways since July 24, when it fell from $30,292 to $28,900. However, we saw a significant upward price spike of 4.3% on August 1, but it quickly came back inside of its sideways range.\n\nThere is now a rare indicator flashing a bull signal, it could be an early indication that a move to the upside would be expected.\n\nGolden Cross\n\nThe golden cross is not a rare indicator of itself. It is a common indicator that means that the faster (lower length) moving average is crossing, the slower (higher length) moving average from the upside. This indicates that the price has started to trend upward. If the opposite happens, it is called a death cross, which indicates the starting downtrend. Higher length values and broader time frames bring more validity to the cross strategy.\n\nOn the weekly chart above, we can see that the golden cross is starting to show. The 20-day moving average is going above the 200-day moving average, which has never occurred in this fashion.\n\nIn the history of Bitcoin, we have only seen two occasions when a similar indication was made, and they were both around bear market bottoms \u2013 September 28, 2015, and April 1, 2019. In September 2015, we saw the 20 SMA going briefly below 200 SMA and then back above it, while in April 2019, an interaction was made but not the cross.\n\nFor this third time, the 20 SMA went below the 200 SMA in September 2020, and stayed there for 336 days before now making it back above.\n\nCan this signal the starting bull market with the price of Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs?\n\nPrice prediction\n\nDrawing a curved channel in which the price of Bitcoin has been trading since the beginning of price history, we can see that all of the highs and lows are perfectly respected. Out of those, the June 18, 2022, low was yet another retest of the channel\u2019s support.\n\n\n\nAs a bounce was made from the support level and the price recovered by 110%, there is a strong possibility that we have seen the start of a bull cycle from there. If this is the case, and based on the golden cross chart, the price of Bitcoin could be headed toward a new all-time high.\n\nIt is still very early to discuss these targets, but the curved channel we have drawn gives us a target of $135,461.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nOn June 18 last year, we saw the price of Bitcoin falling to $15,240 at its lowest point. In Bitcoin\u2019s history, the bear market bottoms were usually higher than their previous bull market tops.\n\n\n\nThis cycle was the first time in the history of Bitcoin that the price fell below the previous bull cycle top, which correlates with what we have seen on the Golden Cross chart \u2013 the 20 SMA moving 336 days below the 200 SMA for the first time in history. You can see by the white rectangle\u2019s that this distance is getting shorter with each cycle and has now gotten negative in this one.\n\nIt could have meant that the price of Bitcoin below $20,000 was extremely undervalued. With only the first wave seen \u2013 from June 18, 2022, until now, it is still not clear whether or not the price is in a bull cycle or in the mid-bear market correction.\n\nAnother low to $11,000 is still on the table, so a stronger confirmation will be received on the next descending move. Namely, we need to see the first higher low compared to June 18, 2022.\n\nBut if we are in a starting bull cycle, the $135,461 could be a modest one with only 320% more to go, measured to the current level of $29,200.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "title": "Bitcoin ETF momentum runs out as crypto market enters summer slump: Report - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "After June gave Bitcoin (BTC) a boost with BlackRock\u2019s application for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), July sent its price into a summer slump. Only some altcoins managed to perform well in response to Ripple Labs\u2019 partial victory against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. XRP (XRP), the most obvious beneficiary, posted a monthly close of +49%.\n\nThe overall response of markets to the result of the lawsuit was much more muted than many anticipated, as a ruling on XRP\u2019s sales does not easily generalize to other coins and tokens. The SEC is now firmly expected to appeal, and market activity has been generally waning over the summer months.\n\nExploring how the various sectors of the digital asset space have performed in this environment, Cointelegraph Research\u2019s \u201cInvestor Insights Report\u201d offers a concise monthly round-up of everything going on in crypto. It dives into venture capital, derivatives, decentralized finance (DeFi), regulation, mining and much more.\n\nThe report is available for free on the Cointelegraph Research Terminal.\n\nNFTs and DeFi take a hit\n\nNonfungible tokens (NFTs) have suffered throughout the bear market. However, in July, interest in NFTs waned so much that even classic collections fell to price levels as low as before the craze of 2021. The floor price of Bored Ape Yacht Club fell below 30 Ether (ETH), and the top five NFT collections in terms of lifetime earnings collected only $800,000 in monthly royalties.\n\nThe weak numbers were accompanied by negative news surrounding Azuki, a well-known blue-chip NFT project. The AzukiDAO filed a proposal to sue Azuki\u2019s founder and win back 20,000 ETH lost to alleged rug pulls.\n\nThe DeFi sector has been plagued by similar woes, with an unprecedented security vulnerability discovered and exploited. Vulnerabilities in DeFi typically stem from poorly implemented smart contracts, but this time, the Vyper programming language \u2014 an alternative to Solidity \u2014 was subject to a vulnerability that resulted in Curve Finance being exploited for over $61 million in a reentrancy hack.\n\nWith the Curve liquidity pools compromised, the price of CRV crashed. The exploited funds were returned several days later, with the hacker accepting a 10% bounty. These and other developments, such as recent news surrounding ZK-rollups, can be found in the DeFi section of Cointelegraph Research\u2019s monthly trends report.\n\nCrypto stocks retain strength\n\nCrypto stocks have shown unusual strength in recent months, most notably the top mining stocks, which have consistently outperformed BTC. The Cointelegraph Research Investor Insights Report has been tracking the performance of these stocks since their rally started earlier this year.\n\nIn July, too, the market prices for tokens and coins lagged behind the performance of crypto stocks. Publicly traded crypto companies gained an average of 23.9% in their stock price by month-end. Coinbase shares skyrocketed in mid-July in response to the outcome of the Ripple lawsuit and stayed above $100 per share for a week, closing out the month at +32.19%.\n\nMicroStrategy posted a similarly bullish monthly close at +27.25%. However, mining companies once again stood out as the top performers, with Stronghold Digital Mining shares increasing almost 75% while TeraWulf and Riot Platforms saw gains of over 50% from their early July levels.\n\nThe Cointelegraph Research team\n\nCointelegraph\u2019s Research department comprises some of the best talents in the blockchain industry. Bringing together academic rigor and filtered through practical, hard-won experience, the researchers on the team are committed to bringing the most accurate, insightful content available on the market.\n\nWith decades of combined experience in traditional finance, business, engineering, technology and research, the Cointelegraph Research team is perfectly positioned to put its combined talents to proper use with the latest Investor Insights Report.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this article are for general informational purposes only and are not intended to provide specific advice or recommendations for any individual or on any specific security or investment product."

        "title": "How to Invest in Cryptocurrency | Investing | U.S. News - U.S News & World Report Money",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have enjoyed a strong resurgence in 2023. Bitcoin (BTC) is up by about 78% as of Aug. 10, and Ethereum (ETH) has rewarded investors with a year-to-date gain of about 55%. Renewed interest in the alternative asset and institutional investors pouring into crypto have contributed to the rally.\n\nBitcoin grabbed the spotlight in 2017 when the coin surged by roughly 2,000% in one year. Bitcoin, like other cryptocurrencies, has always been more volatile than most assets. However, the general trend has been upward. Bitcoin gains have exceeded 376% over the five years preceding Aug. 10, and Ethereum has done even better, with a 454% gain.\n\n\n\nThose types of long-term returns tend to attract investors who want to maximize their profits. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have outperformed so-called FAANG stocks (Amazon.com Inc. (ticker: AMZN), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and other tech leaders) over the past five years, but there's more to crypto than Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nInvestors can choose from thousands of altcoins to diversify their crypto portfolios. Cardano (ADA), XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are some of the top altcoins by market cap.\n\nCryptocurrencies can continue to rally and generate long-term gains as more businesses use blockchain technology and institutional investors accumulate crypto. Here's what you need to know about how to invest in cryptocurrency:\n\nWhat Is Cryptocurrency?\n\nCryptocurrency is a digital asset that operates on a blockchain. This blockchain is a peer-to-peer medium of exchange without a central authority. Pavel Matveev, CEO and co-founder of Wirex, says the decentralized nature of crypto gives it several advantages over fiat currencies.\n\n\"By eliminating the reliance on a central authority and operating through a network of distributed nodes, blockchain started a new era of security and transparency,\" Matveev says. \"This design makes it more resilient against cyberattacks, system crashes and human errors compared to centralized systems.\"\n\nCrypto transactions get recorded in a public blockchain. A digital asset like Bitcoin can act as a storage of value, similar to gold. The Ethereum blockchain allows smart contracts to execute secure financial transactions. But any cryptocurrency's value depends on how others perceive the asset. If more businesses enable crypto payments, the alternative asset can see more use for its intended purpose. At the moment, many investors have been accumulating crypto because of how it has rewarded long-term investors over the past few years.\n\nCrypto Exchanges and Crypto Wallets\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum's coin Ether are the two most popular cryptocurrencies, but investors can choose from thousands of cryptos. Deviating away from the two top cryptos can increase your potential returns but can also significantly increase your risk.\n\nSome cryptocurrencies ride a short-term wave of momentum before fading off into the sunset. A crypto investment can become worthless, but this fate is less likely for cryptocurrencies with large market caps.\n\nBeginner investors may benefit from using a crypto exchange to facilitate their transactions. Some brokerage firms, such as Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) and Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD), let you buy crypto without creating your own wallet. These firms store crypto for you, but you still get to harvest long-term gains.\n\nAs you get more comfortable with crypto, setting up a crypto wallet can give you true ownership of your assets without relying on a centralized entity. Just make sure you keep your private key somewhere you can easily find it. That private key is your crypto wallet's password, and you cannot get a new passcode or access the wallet if you forget your private key.\n\nRegardless of how investors trade crypto, they should watch out for fees and spreads. Looking at crypto transaction fees can help you gauge which brokerage firms offer better deals. Lowering your transaction fees will protect more of your capital, which can then go into new investments.\n\n\n\nRisks of Investing in Cryptocurrency\n\nEvery investment has risks, and crypto is no exception to the rule. The asset is speculative and has produced millionaires, but getting in at the wrong time can lead to significant losses.\n\nBitcoin has performed well year to date and over the past five years. However, the cryptocurrency has fallen 57% from its all-time high of $68,789.63. The big drop, compared with strong year-to-date gains, highlights how unstable these assets can be. Jatali Bellanton, CEO of BMU Meta crypto hedge fund, encourages investors to look at the big picture instead of at the sharp volatility.\n\n\"Even though people discuss its volatility, the returns are high for the right pick. Imagine if a company is up by 300%, and then it drops by 50%,\" she says. \"In the end, it is still up 100%. Be sure to bank some profits and not get too greedy.\"\n\nRegulation has always been a central focus for the crypto investment thesis. While many countries have lightened up on the adoption of cryptocurrencies, other countries are still placing restrictions on cryptocurrencies or banning them outright.\n\nYou should do your due diligence before committing to a crypto brokerage, and even then, a crypto wallet may be the better choice. Investors who put their crypto into FTX saw their assets evaporate and become inaccessible after founder Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested on charges that he mismanaged funds and defrauded investors. The FTX fiasco demonstrates the worst of what can happen to crypto investors. Keeping your coins in a crypto wallet reduces this concern, since you own your crypto and can access it at any time.\n\nIt may take a while for cryptocurrencies to fulfill their original mission as units of exchange. More businesses would have to enable crypto as a payment method, and even then, investors may be more inclined to hold onto an asset that has outpaced the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 over the past five years.\n\nHow to Make Money with Cryptocurrency\n\nCryptocurrencies offer several paths to monetization for investors. You can buy cryptocurrencies and hold them over the long run, hoping these assets will gain in value. Investors can also trade crypto and capitalize on price fluctuations.\n\nSome traders monitor price fluctuations throughout the day, while others set \"good 'til canceled\" orders to have trades executed once crypto reaches the set limit price. These types of orders minimize the amount of time traders spend in their portfolios and looking at crypto price charts.\n\nCrypto staking is another way to earn money with \"proof of stake\" cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Cardano. It's similar to lending crypto to other investors that you can reclaim at any time. Staking allows crypto investors to participate in the validation of transactions on the blockchain.\n\nMatveev explains how crypto staking is similar to collecting dividends from your favorite stocks: \"Crypto staking refers to the process of earning passive income by holding coins in a wallet. This concept bears some resemblance to a traditional bank deposit, though the crucial distinction lies in the utilization of the deposited funds. Rather than being used for investments and loans, staking employs these funds to facilitate the smooth functioning of the underlying blockchain network.\"\n\nThe yield you earn from crypto staking depends on the type of crypto you use. Less risky cryptocurrencies like Ethereum command lower yields, while you can earn more cash flow with altcoins like Cardano, Solana and Dogecoin. Crypto staking can generate 5% to 10% yields for some tokens.\n\nTakeaway"

Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nLeading cryptocurrencies finally broke a six-week spell of poor price performance or inertia this week.\n\nMarket leader Bitcoin (BTC) added a modest 1.5% to its market value over the seven days to trade at $29,408 on Saturday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to the latest weekly report by CoinShares, last week was a strong indicator that institutional investors have stopped shorting the leading currency for the first time in fourteen weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest coin by market capitalization, appeared to match the top coin\u2019s pace, adding 1.3% to enter the weekend at $1,851.\n\nThere were no significant price drops among the top thirty cryptocurrencies. However, three altcoins posted notable gains.\n\nSolana (SOL) grew 8.5% to its current price of $24.55; Toncoin (TON) added 10.1% to hit $1.32, and Shiba Inu (SHIB) blew up 17.8% to trade at $0.00001108.\n\nShiba Inu appears to have kept up the momentum of last week\u2019s rally that commenced on news that the coin\u2019s makers are shedding their memecoin reputation and introducing a new identity protocol to all apps on the ecosystem for increased security and privacy.\n\nAltogether the market made small gains this week, as July\u2019s U.S. inflation readings indicated a continued cooling off.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the news...\n\nThis week brought a fairly busy and diverse news cycle, with institutional and global adoption stories commanding attention alongside the Fed\u2019s new stablecoin note and the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission\u2019s face-saving tactics in its failing war on crypto.\n\nOn Monday, payments giant PayPal announced it would be releasing an Ethereum-based dollar-pegged stablecoin called PayPal USD (PYUSD).\n\nThe currency will be issued by Paxos and is expected to become \"a part of the overall payments infrastructure,\" according to a media quote by PayPal CEO Dan Schulman.\n\nStarting next month, Paxos will be publishing monthly reserve reports and third-party attestations of PYUSD\u2019s reserves, enabling the public to keep track of the credibility and value of the assets underpinning the stablecoin\u2019s value.\n\nDemocratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) aired her concerns in a written statement: \u201cI am deeply concerned that PayPal has chosen to launch its own stablecoin while there is still no Federal framework for regulation, oversight and enforcement of these assets. [...] Given PayPal\u2019s size and reach, Federal oversight and enforcement of its stablecoin operations is essential.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Brazil announced the name of its new central bank digital currency (CBDC): DREX, or the \u201cdigital real\u201d\u2014 the name being a near-acronym for \u201cdigital real electronic transaction.\u201d\n\nThe digital real is a centrally-issued tokenized real that utilizes distributed ledger technology similar to blockchain, but it\u2019s not without controversy.\n\nEarly last month, the Brazilian Central Bank published the code of the pilot project on its GitHub profile. Developers thus discovered several problematic functions within the smart contract.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe capabilities given to the Central Bank include the ability to freeze users' accounts, decrease target balances, confiscate, and mint new units of the digital currency. This, in turn, has attracted criticism that the project enforces exactly the kind of centralization crypto was created to avoid.\n\nThat day, Binance announced it had secured licenses to operate in El Salvador, a country where Bitcoin is legal tender. Binance has been feeling the heat of the SEC\u2019s spotlight in the U.S. after the federal securities regulator sued it for breaching securities laws, alleging further still that Binance execs are involved in commingling customer funds and market manipulation.\n\nAlso that day, the Federal Reserve issued a statement announcing incoming guidance for chartered banks dealing with dollar-pegged stablecoins. It also said it was stepping up its \u201cnovel activities supervision program\u201d for banks dealing with crypto or crypto companies in its jurisdiction.\n\nIn particular, the Fed is looking to monitor the transaction validation process, including the \u201ctiming and finality of settlement of transactions, potential irreversibility of transactions, and the central authority of transaction records.\u201d\n\nThe statement hints that the Fed will implement know-your-client (KYC) measures and ensure that nationally-chartered banks demonstrate appropriate risk-mitigation strategies.\n\nOn Friday, the SEC announced it plans to appeal Judge Torres\u2019s landmark ruling in the agency\u2019s ongoing lawsuit against Ripple for\u2014you guessed it\u2014breaching securities laws.\n\nTorres ruled that Ripple\u2019s XRP was not a security by definition but could be presented as one depending on how it\u2019s sold. Her verdict essentially contradicted the SEC\u2019s claim that offerings to retail customers via exchanges constitute securities offerings.\n\nThe following day, the SEC once more played for time and delayed its decision to approve or reject a high-profile spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund application from ARK 21Shares.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFinally, on Saturday payments giant Visa announced an experimental solution on the Ethereum blockchain that enables users to pay gas fees using Visa credit or debit cards."

        "title": "Bitcoin Lightning Network: Crypto's Flashy Scaling Solution - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network is gaining serious traction as the leading solution to BTC\u2019s scalability concerns. With industry heavyweights like Binance setting up Lightning Nodes and nations like El Salvador rolling out support for the scaling solution, the Bitcoin Lightning Network is primed for mass adoption.\n\nNew Bitcoin Lightning Wallets and channels are being created daily, demonstrating the demand for instant payments and low transaction fees.\n\nIn this guide, we\u2019ll look into the Layer-2 network designed to improve upon Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s iconic crypto asset and explore how it works. Can this Bitcoin (BTC) scaling solution take on Web2 leaders like Visa? Or are Lightning Payments just a flash in the pan?\n\nWhat Is the Bitcoin Lightning Network?\n\nThe Bitcoin Lightning Network is a \u201cLayer-2\u201d payment protocol that operates on top of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. Think of it like a high-speed expressway that runs parallel to the main network that processes fast and affordable payments.\n\nDespite being a technical revolution in its own right, the Bitcoin network is ill-suited for mass adoption. Unlike modern blockchains, Bitcoin transactions are painfully slow and often charge high transaction fees.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network aims to maintain the crypto asset\u2019s status as a store of value, like digital gold, while creating a scalable and secure payment system that rivals existing platforms.\n\nHow is this possible?\n\nHow Does the Lightning Network Work?\n\nThe mechanics of the Lightning Network are as fascinating as they are innovative. Imagine a bustling network of tunnels, each connecting two individuals who wish to transact with each other. These tunnels, or \u2018payment channels,\u2019 are the core of the Lightning Network.\n\nWhen two people decide to transfer BTC using the Lightning Network, they establish a payment channel that runs parallel to the Bitcoin blockchain. Imagine this channel as a private highway allowing them to exchange unlimited transactions without congesting the main blockchain.\n\nThese off-chain transactions are not immediately broadcasted to the Bitcoin network. Instead, they are held within the channel, away from the prying eyes of the public ledger.\n\nWhen the channel is closed, The final balance of transactions is settled as a single transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain. Like Ethereum (ETH) Rollups, this method allows large groups of transactions to occur off-chain, with only the opening and closing of the channel being recorded on-chain.\n\nOn top of that, the Lightning Network has an ace up its sleeve. Thanks to smart contract technology, it doesn\u2019t require a direct channel between all users. For example, if Vitalik has a channel with CZ, and CZ has a channel with SBF, Vitalik can transact with SBF through CZ, creating a network of interconnected channels.\n\nIf you want to set up a Lightning Wallet and transfer digital assets, don\u2019t miss our helpful step-by-step guide on Lightning Payments.\n\nWhy Do We Need the Bitcoin Lightning Network?\n\nAs the popularity of Bitcoin soars, so does the strain on its network. The Bitcoin blockchain, while revolutionary, was not designed to handle a high volume of transactions simultaneously. The rise of Ordinal NFTs and BRC-20 tokens has proven this, with Bitcoin gas fees exploding to all-time highs in 2023.\n\nThis limitation led to slower transaction times and higher fees, making Bitcoin payments a poor way of exchanging funds. Think of it this way; you won\u2019t use BTC to pay for a coffee if the transaction fee costs more than the coffee itself!\n\nThe Bitcoin Lightning Network is designed to address these very challenges. By moving transactions off the main blockchain, the Lightning Network significantly increases Bitcoin\u2019s scalability, enabling it to handle millions of transactions per second. This starkly contrasts the Bitcoin network\u2019s capacity, which can handle fewer than ten transactions per second.\n\nMoreover, the Lightning Network drastically reduces transaction costs, making micropayments possible and economically viable. This opens up many new use cases, from tipping content creators fractions of a cent to paying per article read or video watched.\n\nLightning Network History\n\nThe concept of the Lightning Network was first introduced in a white paper by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja in 2015. They envisioned a second-layer solution that could solve the scalability issues plaguing Bitcoin.\n\nSince then, the development of the Lightning Network has been a collaborative effort, with several teams working on different protocol implementations. These include Blockstream, Lightning Labs, and ACINQ, each contributing to the evolution of Bitcoin\u2019s most popular scaling solution.\n\nThe first successful transaction on the Lightning Network took place in 2017, marking a significant milestone in its development. Since then, the network has grown exponentially, with thousands of active nodes and channels.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for Lightning Network?\n\nThe future of the Lightning Network looks bright. While the network is still in its early stages, there\u2019s a flurry of ongoing development to enhance its capabilities and user experience. These include toolkits that help developers build DeFi applications and NFT functionality within the Lightning Ecosystem.\n\nOne of the key areas of focus is improving the network\u2019s routing capabilities to ensure transactions find the most efficient path across the network. As the network grows, seamless channel routing will be crucial for maintaining the speed and low cost of transactions.\n\nThere\u2019s also a growing interest in integrating the Lightning Network with other cryptocurrencies. This could enable instant, low-cost transactions across blockchains, further expanding the network\u2019s utility.\n\nThe Lightning Network is also expected to play a significant role in developing decentralized applications (dApps). Its ability to handle micropayments efficiently could pave the way for new types of dApps, from pay-per-use services to decentralized streaming platforms.\n\nBitcoin Lightning Network Alternatives\n\nWhile the Lightning Network aims to resolve Bitcoin\u2019s scalability problems, it\u2019s not the first payment system to threaten Bitcoin\u2019s crown.\n\nAlternative decentralized payment networks like Ripple (XRP) and Bitcoin forks like Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) also provide fast and affordable solutions. However, the key difference between these platforms is that the Lightning Network still takes advantage of Bitcoin\u2019s unmatched security and decentralization.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough, BTC is considered a \u2018safe haven\u2019 by cryptocurrency standards. BTC\u2019s price is far less volatile than its competitors, making it a more stable network for frequent transactions.\n\nPros and Cons of Bitcoin Lightning Network\n\nAs we delve deeper into the Bitcoin Lightning Network, it\u2019s crucial to weigh the advantages and potential drawbacks of this innovative Layer-2 solution. Like any technology, the Lightning Network has its pros and cons that shape its utility and adoption.\n\nPros\n\nFast \u2013 As the name suggests, The Lightning Network offers lightning-fast transactions. Payments are processed in milliseconds to seconds, significantly improving over the ten-minute block time of the Bitcoin network.\n\n\u2013 As the name suggests, The Lightning Network offers lightning-fast transactions.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDoes Bitcoin mining help or hurt the environment? Blockchain experts sought an answer to that question in a newly released, first-of-its-kind academic paper on the matter. Their conclusion: It could help, with some key changes.\n\n\u201cOur findings show that renewable-based mining could potentially drive a net-decarbonizing effect on energy grids, although key adaptations in mining practices are needed to fully realize this potential,\u201d reads the abstract of the paper, written by blockchain researchers Juan Ignacio Ibanez and Dr. Alexander Freier.\n\nPublished earlier this week, their analysis examined the realities of the mining industry\u2019s carbon footprint and its potential to expand renewable energy capacity, providing a \u201cbalanced\u201d perspective between both sides of the Bitcoin environmental debate. After just two days, the paper has amassed more views than 95% of the 24 million papers ever published on Altmetric.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBIG UPDATE: In it\u2019s first 48 hours the #Bitcoin mining research paper is now #1 in views (6 months) and has an altmetric score of 344. This paper is now in the top 5% of all papers ever tracked (24+ million) by altmetric \ud83d\udc40 Read & share the paper: https://t.co/ZkTx7bSbDB pic.twitter.com/Yt9ae4Q6Hb \u2014 Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) August 10, 2023\n\nThe analysis states that a series of \u201cunique characteristics\u201d set miners apart from other energy buyers, helping provide \u201cadditional income and ancillary services\u201d to renewable energy grids. Some of these characteristics include flexibility of load, interruptibility, portability, and waste heat utilization.\n\nFor example, miners can help absorb excess power generated by wind and solar facilities, helping those firms become more profitable. They also could be used to monetize stranded natural gas and landfill gas that would otherwise be flared into the atmosphere as highly pollutive methane, using containerized mining and generator solutions.\n\nThough mining\u2019s impact on grid management and renewable power generation is already \u201cvisible,\" the paper notes that it still isn\u2019t large enough to impact the sector at large. \u201cShould the adoption of PoW mining intensify, this scale could change,\u201d it stated.\n\nSome challenges on the industry\u2019s road to decarbonization include the short-term price volatility of BTC itself \u2013which directly impacts mining profitability \u2013 alongside external regulatory challenges. Furthermore, alternative technologies may \u201csupplement Bitcoin mining in the process of grid decarbonization,\u201d such as water desalination, CO2 removal, and batteries.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo far, estimates of Bitcoin\u2019s CO2 emissions vary widely, depending on the measurements and sources used. On Wednesday, the Bitcoin Mining Council\u2019s survey data suggested that the sector\u2019s sustainable power mix is roughly 59.9%.\n\nBut there are issues with studies that ask miners to self report, because most overestimate how green their operation is.\n\n\"There may be a selection bias in the sample,\" study author Ibanez told Decrypt. \"Forty-three percent of the miners report their energy mix to the Bitcoin Mining Council, but probably the greener miners are the most willing to report.\"\n\nEven if the methods for measuring industry greenness at the moment leave some room for improvement, Ibanez said he's sure of one thing: The industry will become more green over time.\n\n\"The competition within the Bitcoin mining market is becoming increasingly fierce, making cheap energy a key differentiator in the business,\" he said. \"Renewable penetration is growing, and there are increasing periods of energy 'excess supply' where energy is very cheap or even negatively priced\u2014making flexible buyers like Bitcoin miners key for financial sustainability.\"\n\nEditor's Note: This post was updated to add comments from author Juan Ibanez."

        "content": "Hacker was held in 2020\n\nBengaluru: Central Crime Branch (CCB) sleuths, who investigated the infamous bitcoin case in 2020, tampered with and destroyed the evidence in gadgets like mobile phones and computers seized from the accused persons, a Special Investigation Team ( SIT ) has alleged.An FIR has been filed by K Ravishankar, deputy superintendent of police, SIT, against then CCB investigating officer of the case, KG Nagar police and others.The FIR has been registered with Cottonpet police under IPC sections 120B (hatching criminal conspiracy), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or banker, merchant or agent), 204 (destruction of document or electronic record to prevent its production as evidence) and 426 (punishment for mischief).The SIT was formed to investigate the irregularities in CCB probe in the bitcoin case. \u201cThen CCB officials had seized gadgets like mobile phones, hard disks, laptops and other materials from the accused. They were sent to Forensic Science Laboratory for getting mirror images of the deleted data and further opinion. For the purpose our investigation, we received those gadgets and reports from FSL. Shockingly, the FSL reports say more files were created in those gadgets during the period of the seizure,\u201d the complaint read.According to FSL reports, additional files were created in two pen drives, a hard disk and two Apple MacBook laptops. \u201cThe addition of more files in these gadgets was done inside the CCB office. Prima facie, it shows that then CCB IO and others, with vested interest and ulterior motives, added more files to the gadgets during the investigation,\u201d according to the complainant.In November 2020, when the BJP government was in power, KG Nagar police had arrested an accused, M Sujay, 30, of Sadashivnagar, on drug-peddling charges. During investigation, police found that drugs were purchased through the darknet by paying in bitcoins. Later, police arrested Srikrishna alias Sriki, a hacker who had studied in the Netherlands, for his alleged role in dealing with bitcoins in the case. Sriki was accused of hacking into government portals too.Later, it was alleged that there were irregularities in the investigation by CCB, and names of many bureaucrats, politicians and cops, as beneficiaries of the irregularities, surfaced. In July,the Congress government formed the SIT to probe the allegations."

        "content": "El Salvador \u2014 a 21.041 km\u00b2 republic in Central America \u2014 made history by being the first country to officially adopt Bitcoin (BTC) as a legal tender currency in 2021.\n\nOn September 6 of the same year, Nayib Bukele, president of El Salvador, announced the Salvadoran treasury bought 400 BTC at an average price of $46,811.00. Following that, there were nine new purchase announcements on different days, until June 30, 2022 \u2014 all done on Bukele\u2019s official Twitter (X) account.\n\nBesides Nayib Bukele\u2019s own statements, there is no evidence that the country has ever bought one single Bitcoin, but \u2014 for this report \u2014 we are assuming that all his words are truthful and accurate.\n\nEl Salvador bought today 80 #BTC at $19,000 each!#Bitcoin is the future!\n\n\n\nThank you for selling cheap \ud83d\ude09 pic.twitter.com/ZHwr0Ln1Ze \u2014 Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) July 1, 2022\n\nWith a total investment of around $103.23 million for 2,381 BTC (at an average price of $43,357.14/btc), the country\u2019s wallet is now down around $33 million (-32%), considering Bitcoin\u2019s spot price of $29,400, by press time.\n\nBitcoin is the leading cryptocurrency by market cap, highly promoted as \u2018sound money\u2019; followed by Ethereum (ETH), promoted as \u2018ultra-sound money\u2019.\n\nThis makes Finbold wonder: What if El Salvador had bought Ethereum over Bitcoin?\n\nWhat if El Salvador had bought Ethereum?\n\nAccording to data collected by Finbold\u2019s team \u2014 considering only the purchases from September 6, 2021 to June 30, 2022 \u2014 Nayib Bukele made the least worse investment decision with BTC than with ETH.\n\nIf El Salvador had used the same amount in US Dollars to buy Ethereum, on each of the same days Bukele announced the Bitcoin\u2019s purchases, according to historical price data by Coingecko, the country would be losing $15 million more than the current losses.\n\nThese investments would now be worth around $55.60 million, holding 30,053.12 ETH, for a 46.14% loss.\n\nEl Salvador purchases simulation with Ethereum (Vinicius Barbosa / Finbold)\n\nIf El Salvador had staked all these Ethereum\u2019s on July 1, 2022, considering an average yield of 3.29% annually, the country\u2019s treasury would have earned around $1.83 million by now, still worse than by simply holding Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin daily purchases by El Salvador\n\nOn November 17, 2022, the president once again talked about Bitcoin purchases, declaring that he would be buying 1 BTC per day starting on November 18 within El Salvador\u2019s treasury. Since then, there have been no related updates made publicly, which keeps the promise alive.\n\nWe are buying one #Bitcoin every day starting tomorrow. \u2014 Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) November 17, 2022\n\nFinbold also collected historical price data from Coingecko for a raw simulation on the possible outcome if (A) Nayib Bukele kept his promises of buying 1 BTC per day since November 18, 2022; and (B) El Salvador had made daily ETH purchases with the same amount in USD.\n\nThere would have been a total of 267 Bitcoin purchases, at an average price of $24,692.13 per BTC, resulting in a current position of $7.85 million, profiting around $1.25 million (+19.07%) for these 267 days only. This would have reduced El Salvador\u2019s total losses to around $31.85 million.\n\nEl Salvador purchases simulation with Ethereum (Vinicius Barbosa / Finbold)\n\nThe daily performance for Ethereum purchases would also have been worse than Bitcoin\u2019s. Sitting in a current amount of around $7.27 million, for an estimated profit of $0.67 million (+10.38%), making a meaningless impact on the bigger outcome.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "In a groundbreaking move, June witnessed leading financial powerhouse BlackRock, along with five other traditional financial (TradFi) institutions, submitting applications to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the launch of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nThis significant development has rekindled hope within the cryptocurrency community regarding the potential institutional acceptance of Bitcoin (BTC). Following swiftly, in July, the SEC took a pivotal stride by accepting all six proposals for review, initiating the initial phase of its deliberation to determine the fate of the eagerly anticipated spot BTC ETF.\n\nWhile the securities regulator refrained from offering a precise timeline for its final decision, there is a decent possibility that the agency might unveil its verdict on one of the applications as early as today, August 11th.\n\nThree possible scenarios\n\nNotably, the deadline for the SEC to decide on ARKInvest\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF is on Sunday, August 13, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart revealed on August 10.\n\nSEC deadline dates for spot Bitcoin ETF applications. Source: Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart\n\nHowever, given that it is the last day before the weekend, Seyffart said he expects the SEC to deliver the announcement today after the market close.\n\nAccording to crypto expert Jelle, there are three possible scenarios regarding the SEC\u2019s expected August 11 announcement. He said the securities watchdog \u201ccan either postpone their decision, approve the ETF, or deny it.\u201d\n\nSeyffart, meanwhile, said he is \u2018fully expecting a delay\u201d from the SEC.\n\nWhat does this mean for Bitcoin?\n\nThe impending announcement from the SEC regarding ARKInvest\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application has the potential to trigger varied impacts on BTC\u2019s price trajectory.\n\nShould the regulatory body grant approval, it could serve as a significant catalyst propelling the leading crypto coin\u2019s price higher. This favorable decision would not only instill optimism regarding other institutional applications but also bolster the overall prospects of Bitcoin\u2019s adoption within the mainstream finance space.\n\nConversely, the prospect of an outright denial, although least likely according to expert opinions, could exert some bearish pressure on BTC. Nevertheless, any downward movement is anticipated to be limited, considering there are five other pending applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAlternatively, the SEC might choose to defer its decision, leading to a relatively muted influence on BTC\u2019s price. This scenario aligns with the most probable outcome given historical regulatory tendencies.\n\nIn any case, the forthcoming SEC decision holds considerable potential to reshape BTC\u2019s price dynamics and its trajectory toward mainstream institutional adoption."
