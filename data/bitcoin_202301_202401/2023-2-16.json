Jakub Porzycki | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nCrypto markets rose on Thursday, shrugging off a tougher regulatory stance from the U.S. government. Bitcoin gained 2.06% to $24,500.00 at around 4:04 p.m. ET while ether was up 1.21% at $1,679.31, according to Coin Metrics. There are \" increasing signs that the market bottomed last November and has turned bullish,\" Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno, told CNBC. \"We are gaining in momentum here and any bad news is being shrugged off, typical signs that the market believes the worst is over.\"\n\nCrypto markets were on edge earlier this week following increased regulatory scrutiny from U.S. authorities on digital currencies. On Monday, the New York State Department of Financial Services told Paxos to stop minting new Binance USD, or BUSD, stablecoins. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency pegged to a real-world asset and some are backed by assets such as bonds or cash. BUSD is pegged one-to-one to the U.S. dollar. Paxos also confirmed that the Securities and Exchange Commission has notified the company that the agency could recommend an action that alleges BUSD is a security. The SEC has not yet formally levelled any charges against Paxos.\n\nFlows into bitcoin"

        "title": "Who Are the Top Bitcoin Millionaires? - Cryptocurrency - Investopedia",
        "content": "Bitcoin is a digital asset and payment system with a market capitalization of around $452.1 billion as of Feb 4, 2023. It is considered by many to be one of the most successful digital currencies ever created. The first-ever bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) was launched in October 2021, pushing the cryptocurrency to new all-time highs.\n\nBitcoin's stratospheric rise since 2009 has created a surprising and diverse set of millionaires (and billionaires). But who owns the most bitcoin? It is tough to say for sure who owns the most bitcoin, as wallet addresses are anonymous in that they are not associated with the account owner's name. The only way to tell is if the owner has publicized their holdings.\n\nMany bitcoin holders have made their wealth by creating products to grow Bitcoin's still-nascent ecosystem. For example, some have created exchanges for trading cryptocurrency and the derivatives that have emerged from it.\n\n\n\nOf course, Bitcoin was\u2014and still is\u2014a risky asset class. The absence of regulatory guardrails and the cryptocurrency's price volatility have attracted criminals and investors alike. But those drawbacks only serve to highlight the achievements of Bitcoin millionaires because they not only were early adopters but also predicted its economic opportunity.\n\nKey Takeaways Launched in 2009, Bitcoin is the first and remains the most successful blockchain-based cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin is volatile, ranging from under $10 in 2010 to $65,000 in November 2021 and back down to less than $16,000 in November 2022.\n\nMost top Bitcoin billionaires became rich by creating products and services to grow the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nThis overall price increase has also created millions for people that bought and held their bitcoins. These early adopters hoped for a lucrative opportunity, started accumulating or mining in the early days, and held on.\n\nChangpeng Zhao (CZ)\n\nHoracia Villaobos / Getty Images\n\nChangpeng Zhao is the founder of Binance, the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. According to Forbes, Zhao's net worth was $4.5 billion in February 2023.\n\nZhao, who immigrated to Canada at the age of 13 from China, came to Bitcoin via a poker game with friends. He went all-in on cryptocurrencies thereafter and even sold his apartment for Bitcoin in 2014. Binance, which was started in 2017, handles transactions that run into billions of dollars on a daily basis. While it may not be as well-known as Coinbase to U.S. customers, Binance is bigger and offers more coins and derivatives to customers than its main competitor.\n\nThe exchange's nimble ascent has taken a toll on its regulatory standing. It is under regulatory scrutiny in some financial jurisdictions and has been forced to operate without a headquarters.\n\n\n\nSong Chi-hyung\n\nSong Chi-hyung is the founder of Dunamu, the parent company of the leading cryptocurrency exchange Upbit in South Korea. Chi-hyung launched Upbit in 2017\u2014within three months it was South Korea's top crypto exchange. According to its third-quarter report, the exchange netted \u20a9219.3 billion (won), or $175 million in income. In 2021, it had a total comprehensive income of \u20a92.15 trillion (won), or $1.73 trillion.\n\nAccording to the Forbes Real-Time Billionaire list, Chi-hyung is worth more than $3.7 billion.\n\nBrian Armstrong\n\nSteven Ferdman / Getty Images\n\nBrian Armstrong is the founder of Coinbase, North America's biggest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. He co-founded the exchange in 2012 after quitting his job as a software engineer at Airbnb. Armstrong has a 19% stake in Coinbase and is estimated to be worth $2.7 billion by Forbes in February 2023.\n\nDue to its easy-to-use interface and credibility, Coinbase is considered the gateway for retail investors to join the crypto ecosystem. The exchange has suffered many hiccups, such as halts in trading while attempting to scale operations amid crypto volatility. The exchange went public in April 2021 and had a total market capitalization of $17.08 billion at the close of trading on Feb. 17, 2023. Armstrong said he started Coinbase because he wanted the world to have a \"global, open financial system that drove innovation and freedom.\"\n\nJed McCaleb\n\nJed McCaleb is a well-known figure in cryptocurrency, as he was the founder of the notorious exchange Mt. Gox. He sold the exchange in 2013, one year before hackers stole nearly $460 million worth of cryptocurrency.\n\nMcCaleb went on to assist in launching the cryptocurrencies and blockchains Ripple and Stellar. He still holds about 3.4 billion XRP, which at February 2023 prices, sets him at close to $2.4 billion in total worth.\n\nAfter launching Stellar in 2014, McCaleb founded the Astera Institute, a 503(c)(3) non-profit for developing technology for human advancement, and Vast, a company reportedly working on artificial gravity technology.\n\nChris Larsen\n\nCris Larsen is another well-known figure in the cryptocurrency arena, having co-founded Ripple alongside Jed McCaleb. He is still the executive chairman of the company. Before cryptocurrency emerged, Larsen co-founded the online mortgage lender e-Loan, which was later sold to Yahoo.\n\nLarsen, referring to cryptocurrency and blockchain, told Forbes, \"The internet of value is more than just laying out a new way of doing finance. I think, fundamentally, this represents the final step in globalization.\"\n\nForbes placed Larsen's worth at $2.2 billion in February 2023.\n\n\n\nTyler and Cameron Winklevoss\n\nTyler and Cameron Winklevoss parlayed the millions they earned from their lawsuit against Facebook into cryptocurrencies. They became the first billionaires in the crypto ecosystem after the late 2017 surge in Bitcoin prices. Forbes estimates their net worth at $1.1 billion each.\n\nWhile most of their estimated wealth comes from investments in cryptocurrencies, the Winklevoss twins are also entrepreneurs who started the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange. The exchange was valued at $7.1 billion after its $400 million fundraising in November 2021. They also own Nifty Gateway, a platform to buy and sell non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nMichael Saylor\n\nJoe Raedle / Getty Images\n\nBitcoin has attracted numerous unconventional investors over the years. None, however, has the zeal and enthusiasm of Michael Saylor, CEO of software firm MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR). The firm began acquiring the cryptocurrency in August 2020 by snapping up $250 million of bitcoin. At that time, the firm said it was buying the cryptocurrency to better use the cash holdings on its balance sheet.\n\nOver time, Saylor has become a fierce supporter of Bitcoin and appeared at news and cryptocurrency conferences to evangelize its benefits and use cases. By December 2021, MicroStrategy had increased its holdings in Bitcoin to $3.5 billion, swooping in to buy the cryptocurrency during price dips.\n\nMicroStrategy's stock price skyrocketed by more than 337% (as of December 2021) after it announced the Bitcoin acquisition. Meanwhile, Forbes estimates Saylor's net worth to be $1.6 billion as a result of his bet on Bitcoin. In December 2022, Microstrategy again made a bitcoin purchase, adding 2,500 more to its holdings. As of February 2023, Microstrategy holds about 132,500 bitcoin\u2014close to $3.2 billion.\n\nWho Is the Wealthiest Person in Cryptocurrency? According to the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List, Changpeng Zhao, founder of cryptocurrency exchange Binance\u2014is estimated to be worth $4.5 billion, making him the wealthiest person in cryptocurrencies.\n\nWho Owns the Most Bitcoins? The anonymous developer of Bitcoin Satoshi Nakamoto is rumored to hold more than 1 million bitcoins. However, due to the nature of cryptocurrency, this cannot be proven. The address that holds the most bitcoin is 34xp4vRoCGJym3xR7yCVPFHoCNxv4Twseo, with more than 248,597 BTC. At February 2023 prices, that's close to $6.1 billion.\n\n\n\nHow Many Crypto Billionaires Are There in the Forbes Billionaires Index? There are eight cryptocurrency billionaires in Forbes' ranking of billionaires, subtracting Sam Bankman-Fried, who was the ninth.\n\nHow Can You Earn Billions From Cryptocurrencies? Contrary to the popular perception of cryptocurrencies, the wealthiest people in its ecosystem have not generated their wealth through bitcoin investments. Instead, they have minted profits by identifying existing gaps in the crypto ecosystem and starting products or services to plug that gap.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAs cryptocurrencies became popular, the number of people making billions off the new asset class increased. Crypto billionaires are a motley bunch\u2014some have made their billions by providing products and services to the emerging ecosystem, while others have generated profits by taking advantage of crypto volatility.\n\n\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other initial coin offerings (ICOs) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

        "content": "A similar issue was front and center on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, when the Senate Banking Committee held a hearing to discuss new safeguards for crypto investors, a possible first step toward legislation. \u201cIt\u2019s time now to consider how to protect consumers from unregulated digital assets, and ultimately, who we want our financial system to serve,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio and the committee chairman.\n\nOn Monday, New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services ordered Paxos, a crypto firm, to cease creating BUSD, a so-called stablecoin, because of \u201cunresolved issues\u201d over its relationship with the crypto exchange Binance, which carried the coin\u2019s branding.\n\nLast week, the S.E.C. charged the crypto exchange Kraken with securities violations, arguing its \u201cstaking\u201d practice \u2014 in which users pledge crypto holdings to companies in exchange for hefty returns \u2014 was akin to selling an unregistered investment contract.\n\nAnd then there is the shadow of the spectacular implosion of FTX, which left investigators on a global hunt to recover billions in missing assets. Amid attempts to claw back funds to repay FTX\u2019s customers, attention has recently turned to $400 million that\u2019s sitting in an interest-bearing bank account.\n\nSo what\u2019s behind the Bitcoin rally? Some say that it\u2019s a so-called short squeeze, in which those who have bet against Bitcoin have to cover their positions by buying more. Another explanation is tax-loss harvesting, in which investors sell at a loss at the end of the year to reduce their tax hit, and then add to their holdings again when the calendar flips. A third potential factor: Crypto investors appear to be selling their holdings in so-called altcoins and putting that money into the relatively more established Bitcoin."

        "content": "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a last-man-standing situation,\u201d says Fred Thiel, CEO of US-based Marathon Digital Holdings. His crypto-mining company, among the largest in the world, has found itself\u2014like the rest of the industry\u2014in the path of a perfect storm.\n\nOver the past year, the sector has been battered by a slump in the price of bitcoin, combined with a spike in the cost of energy and an increase in mining difficulty\u2014a reflection of the amount of computing power directed at the bitcoin network, which dictates the proportion of coins miners are able to win.\n\nAt the height of the 2021 boom, profit margins in the mining business rose as high as 90 percent, says Thiel. But now, they have \u201ctotally collapsed.\u201d If the price of bitcoin does not rally, he says, there will be \u201ca lot more pain,\u201d and firms that are only marginally profitable today will find themselves \u201cvery underwater.\u201d\n\nAs they scramble to cut costs, miners are playing a high-stakes game of chicken. In spring 2024, the halving, a mechanism baked into the bitcoin system that periodically cuts the number of coins awarded in half, will slash mining profits. The goal for miners is to ensure they are in a strong enough financial position to survive the fall in profits longer than anyone else; as miners give in and drop from the network, the share of coins won by the rest will increase.\n\n\u201cAny miners that are struggling now will not be able to survive the halving,\u201d says Jeff Burkey, VP of business development at Foundry, which operates its own mining facilities, a large-scale mining pool, and a marketplace for mining hardware. The dynamic will create a rush among miners to get their houses in order, he explains.\n\nMiners will look to eke out additional profit margin wherever they can, whether by deploying superior hardware and cooling techniques, developing software to closely monitor the performance of machines, relocating to territories with cheaper power, or renegotiating the terms of their loans.\n\nOthers, like Geosyn Mining, are aiming at vertical integration\u2014all the way down to the energy powering the facilities. The company, says CEO Caleb Ward, wants to construct its own solar farm to power its machines, thereby eliminating a major cost. \u201cWe need to be more thoughtful as an industry about how we protect against risk,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not all about shooting for the moon.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the miners whose financial predicaments prevent them from fine-tuning their operations are playing a dangerous waiting game, gambling on an increase in the price of bitcoin that may never come.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of halving cycles is that the industry [is forced] to become more efficient\u2014a lot of weaker players will have to exit the business,\u201d says Jeff Lucas, CFO of mining company Bitfarms, which has worked to restructure its finances in the downturn. \u201cThe devil is in the details.\u201d\n\nAlready on the back foot, mining companies are beginning to fold. Compute North, which owned multiple large-scale mining facilities, filed for bankruptcy in September, and Core Scientific, a publicly traded miner, did the same in December. Others are having to maneuver. Argo Blockchain, also a public company, was forced to sell off mining equipment and its state-of-the-art mining center, while Stronghold Digital Mining has negotiated a debt repayment holiday. Neither company responded to interview requests."

        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rose 8.86% in the week from Feb. 10 to Feb. 17, trading at US$23,764 at 7 p.m. on Friday in Hong Kong. Ether strengthened 7.86% in the same period to change hands at US$1,665.\n\nBitcoin saw this week\u2019s second-biggest gains among the 10 largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, followed by Polygon\u2019s Matic that rose 13.33% to US$1.44.\n\n\u201cI am expecting a slightly sideways move. The market has to calm a little before any further impulses,\u201d wrote Aziz Kenjaev, head of partnerships at decentralized crypto derivatives exchange GammaX, in a LinkedIn response to Forkast.\n\n\u201cThere is massive support and a strong buy orders wall which might push Bitcoin further towards US$29,000-30,000 in early March. However, there also is a strong support zone at US$22,250. If that support withholds, we might see another impulse toward US$25,300,\u201d wrote Kenjaev, adding that \u201cthere will be more speculations over the SEC and Paxos, so keep your newsfeed open.\u201d\n\nKenjaev sees less correlation between traditional and crypto markets, as prices are mainly driven by industry developments.\n\n\u201cThe cryptocurrency market is more focused on developments inside its own ecosystem and the connectivity of this decentralized ecosystem to the centralized one. Hence, every development related to the regulators vs crypto companies, especially U.S. regulators, does and will affect the crypto market,\u201d wrote Kenjaev.\n\n\u201cBe mindful of the release, testing, deployment and adoption of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The major macroeconomic data I would like to see is the national debt. There has been a lot of money spent in recent years and governments will be looking to recover it,\u201d wrote Kanjaev, adding that \u201cthe government knows that there is a good portion of funds floating in Web3.\u201d\n\nThe global crypto market cap stood at US$1.09 trillion on Friday at 7 p.m. in Hong Kong, up 6.86% from US$1.02 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin\u2019s US$458 billion market cap represented 42.2% of the market, while Ether accounted for 18.7%.\n\nSee related article: JPMorgan report shows institutional trader interest shifting to AI from blockchain after crypto slump\n\nBiggest gainers\n\nAstar Network\u2019s Astr token was this week\u2019s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap. Astar Network is a multi-chain smart contract network focused on Web3 innovation.\n\nAstr rallied 51.72% this past week to change hands at US$0.1099 after the announcement of its partnership with Sony to launch a Web3 incubation program to support developers building Web3 projects.\n\nDecentralized gaming developer Treasure\u2019s Magic token was the second biggest gainer, up 44.94% to trade at US$2.18. The token started its rally on Feb. 13, after the company launched a new Game Builders Program supported by Arbitrum to incentivize high-potential games building on Treasure, by offering developers access to open-source code as well as advisory and marketing support.\n\nSee related article: Be careful what you wish for? Regulators pick up pace in the crypto industry crackdown\n\nNext week?\n\nFor the first time in Bitcoin\u2019s history, a \u201cdeath cross\u201d appeared on its weekly chart. This meant that the 50-week small moving average (SMA), a key technical indicator, stood below the 200-week SMA for the first time.\n\nKasper Vandeloock, chief executive officer of quantitative trading firm Musca Capital, said that the death cross \u201cgives very little input,\u201d since it only shows that Bitcoin price performed better in the last 50 weeks compared to the last 200 weeks.\n\nBitcoin prices charted another significant formation, with its first \u201cgolden cross\u201d on the daily timeframe since the beginning of the crypto bear market in November 2021. A golden cross means that the 50-day SMA is above the 200-day SMA. Historically, Bitcoin has charted multiple golden crosses in previous cycles before a sustained rally.\n\n\u201cA record high 66.9% of circulating BTC has not moved in over a year,\u201d tweeted Joe Burnett, head analyst at Blockware Solutions, adding that \u201cBitcoin bear markets end when there are no sellers remaining, the price slowly starts drifting up due to (any) marginal buyer, and the next wave of adopters learn BTC is the least uncertain money.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kenjaev, this suggests that Bitcoin holders were more conservative. \u201cThey are waiting for the right time to sell and are hedging over the upcoming recession. The state of the global economic conditions now leads to more uncertainty than during the Covid-19 pandemic. The reason why the situation is not changing with current global developments is that investors do not see the same scenario happening. Current market conditions look risk-attractive and favorable, although it\u2019s very early to call it the next bull run. We shall at the very least wait for improvements from regulatory bodies globally.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome patterns suggest that an ideal scenario for Bitcoin would be to drop near US$19,500-19,300,\u201d he added, hoping for \u201ca decline to US$19,500 and a jump to US$30,000.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 12, Blockstream chief executive officer Adam Back predicted that Bitcoin would exceed US$200 million in market cap, bringing BTC prices to US$10 million by 2032.\n\nSee related article: Go ahead and ban staking.

(WJHL) \u2014 Washington County\u2019s legal effort to shut down a Bitcoin mine that has been a source of controversy in Limestone since May 2021 won\u2019t go to trial for another year.\n\nCounty commissioners rejected a final settlement proposal from defendants BrightRidge and Red Dog Technologies in November. County Attorney Allyson Wilkinson told them last month she expected the case to go to trial before the fall.\n\nInstead, Chancellor John Rambo has set a trial for Feb. 5-7, 2024. Pre-trial briefs from each side are due by Jan. 4, 2024.\n\n\u201cI know we\u2019re all disappointed that this isn\u2019t moving at a faster pace,\u201d Commission Chairman Greg Matherly said Friday. \u201cWe anticipated it would be much sooner, possibly summer. We all want resolution.\u201d\n\nThe trial date is nearly three years after neighbors began complaining about noise at the facility, where high-powered computers solve complex algorithms to \u201cmine\u201d the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Fans used to cool the computers are the source of the noise.\n\nCommissioners learned in September 2021 that Planning Director Angie Charles and Wilkinson had determined the mine violated zoning regulations and ordered BrightRidge \u2014 which had successfully sought a rezoning in 2020 for a \u201cblockchain data center\u201d \u2014 to shut it down.\n\nBrightRidge leases land adjacent to the Bailey Bridge Road substation and sells Red Dog massive amounts of power for its operation.\n\nBrightRidge responded by saying the county\u2019s issue was with Red Dog, even though Bitcoin mining had never been mentioned prior to startup. (Technically, a Bitcoin mine is a type of blockchain data center).\n\nThe county sued BrightRidge in November 2021 and Red Dog was quickly added as a defendant. Rambo set a trial for July 2022 but then the sides nearly settled with a deal that would have allowed Red Dog to replace the Limestone facility with one in the Washington County Industrial Park.\n\nCommissioners ultimately rejected that settlement three months ago in a 13-2 vote.\n\nLike Matherly, Freddie Malone voted against the settlement.\n\nHe said he fears another delay could come before the currently set date arrives.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for us to assume that this matter will be heard in court on that date. I think there\u2019s a good chance it will be delayed and extended far past that date.\u201d\n\nMalone said he was frustrated at the time, legal expense and effort spent since county commissioners first ordered the site shut down in October 2021.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any of the commissioners then or now expected that it would take this long,\u201d Malone said.\n\nHe said the continued delays work in Red Dog and BrightRidge\u2019s favor, allowing the company to continue operating and making money while BrightRidge continues to sell electricity to what CEO Jeff Dykes confirmed is its largest customer.\n\n\u201cThey would prefer there never had been any conflict, but in light of the conflict I think their position has likely been delay, stall, drag it out \u2013 run out the clock essentially,\u201d Malone said.\n\n\u201cAnd we have to remember that is not just Red Dog and GRIID (Red Dog\u2019s parent company), that is our community partner BrightRidge.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin bull Mike Novogratz is dialing it back.\n\nIn January 2021, the founder and CEO of crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital said he would get a tattoo to commemorate Bitcoin reaching $500,000, which he expected to happen in 2024. On Wednesday, he said he\u2019d be happy if Bitcoin merely traded at $30,000 by the end of this year.\n\nNovogratz, an early investor in Bitcoin, made the comments at a Bank of America conference on Wednesday, as Bloomberg reported.\n\nBitcoin lost nearly 65% of its value over 2022, ending the year at about $16,500. It\u2019s up about 50% year to date to $24,792. But that\u2019s well below its peak of nearly $69,000 in November 2021.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at the price action, when I look at the excitement of the customers calling, the FOMO [fear of missing out] building up, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we were at $30,000 by the end of the quarter,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I would\u2019ve given both my shoes for that to be true just six weeks ago. Like if we end the year $30,000, I will be the happiest guy.\u201d\n\nAt a Bitcoin conference in Miami in April last year, Novogratz reiterated his prediction the cryptocurrency would hit $500,000, adding he also believed it would eventually reach $1 million. Bitcoin was then trading at around $44,300.\n\nHe said at the time that Bitcoin\u2019s price would soar once the Fed stepped back from raising interest rates.\n\nOn Wednesday, he predicted that the $500,000 mark would eventually be reached, but not in the next five years, and he again pointed to Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s interest rate decisions.\n\n\u201cWhat makes me skeptical that we can have the explosive, back-to-the-old highs this year is Chairman Powell,\u201d Novogratz said. \u201cHe\u2019s really doing what he says he\u2019s going to do, and I don\u2019t see the Fed pivoting and cutting anytime soon.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not the only crypto investor remaining bullish on Bitcoin in the long term. Earlier this month, ARK Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood, long a Bitcoin believer, said that while 2022 was a \u201cterrible year for everything crypto,\u201d her firm predicts Bitcoin will hit \u201croughly $670,000\u201d in five years then could pass $1 million by 2030.\n\nOf course, many top business thinkers disagree with such predictions\u2014or discredit Bitcoin and other crypto entirely. Mark Mobius, the billionaire cofounder of Mobius Capital Partners, predicted in December that Bitcoin would fall to $10,000 at some point this year.\n\nAnd Warren Buffett\u2019s right-hand man Charlie Munger argued in a Wall Street Journal op-ed this month that the U.S. should follow China\u2019s lead and pass laws that prevent both crypto trading and the formation of new cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn January last year, Novogratz tweeted a photo of a new tattoo on his shoulder. Reading \u201cLuna\u201d and showing a wolf howling at the moon, it indicated his enthusiasm for the cryptocurrency Luna, which later lost all its value after the wipeout of the so-called stablecoin TerraUSD, a sister token.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good reminder that you are not always right,\u201d Novogratz said last summer.\n\nNote: \u201cBitcoin maximalist,\u201d used to describe Novogratz in an earlier version of this story, has been replaced with \u201cBitcoin bull.\u201d Bitcoin maximalists\u2014pointing to Novogratz\u2019s Luna investment\u2014would argue that he is not one of them since they \u201cstrive to stay clear\u201d of the \u201cscam-ridden crypto industry\u201d and \u201cdo not even consider Bitcoin to be the same thing as \u2018crypto,\u2019\u201d as one reader wrote to us."

        "content": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has reached a new 2023 high of $25,000 after surging over much of January.\n\nThe last time Bitcoin\u2019s price was around $25,000 was around mid-June, on its way down to between $19,000 and $21,000, where it then hovered for several months, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nThe price of BTC has increased double digits over the last 24 hours to reach the $25,000 milestone.\n\nThe price of BTC then took a big dip in November following the FTX crisis, which saw BTC drop to a 2022 low of $15,742 on Nov. 10.\n\nIts price began to surge in early January, increasing over 14 consecutive days from Jan. 4-17.\n\nThat daily green candle streak was its second longest in the cryptocurrency\u2019s 14-year history \u2014 having fallen one day short of its 15-day record set in November 2013.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price correction was overdue \u2014 analysts outline why the end of 2023 will be bullish\n\nWhile BTC has had an impressive start to 2023, it is still down 63% from its all-time-high of $69,044, reached on Nov. 10, 2021.\n\nSome economists such as Lyn Alden believe that BTC\u2019s current price surge may be relatively short-lived. The Bitcoin bull believes actions from the U.S. Federal Reserve will likely impose \u201cconsiderable danger ahead\u201d for BTC in the second half of 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, Galaxy Digital Holdings CEO Mike Novogratz is more bullish over the short term.\n\nSpeaking at a Bank of America conference on Feb. 15, Novogratz reportedly said that there\u2019s a chance BTC could hit $30,000 by the end of March."

It's just ridiculous that anybody would buy this stuff,\" Munger, 99, told CNBC's Becky Quick during a livestream of the event, adding: \"It's totally absolutely crazy, stupid gambling.\"\n\nCryptocurrency's advocates maintain that digital assets offer privacy, security, better transaction speeds and lower costs than traditional financial institutions.\n\nBut Munger, a longtime stock investor with a net worth of $2.3 billion, doesn't buy it. \"I think the people who oppose my position are idiots, so I don't think there is a rational argument against my position,\" he said.\n\nMunger's comments come amid an avalanche of problems for crypto investors over the past year.\n\nThe crypto market lost roughly $2 trillion last year. Bitcoin, one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, lost more than 60% of its value in 2022. And the implosion of FTX, a now-bankrupt crypto trading platform once valued at $32 billion, has shaken investors' confidence as the industry feels the ripple effects of the company's collapse.\n\n\"Many Americans are coming to realize that cryptocurrency is just a speculative mania and the industry is rife with crooks,\" James Royal, a principal reporter at Bankrate, tells CNBC Make It. Indeed, just 8% of Americans have a positive view of cryptocurrency as of November, according to the CNBC All-America Economic Survey.\n\nOn Wednesday, Munger said he's not proud of his country \"for allowing this crap.\" He's previously urged the U.S. government to ban cryptocurrencies, and may partially get his wish as the crypto industry faces rising regulatory crackdowns.\n\nIncreased scrutiny of crypto-trading firms and investment advisors are among the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's top priorities this year, as outlined in the agency's \"2023 Examination Priorities Report.\"\n\nThe SEC's examinations will focus on the \"offer, sale, recommendation of or advice regarding trading in crypto or crypto-related assets,\" the report says.\n\nThe agency voted Wednesday to expand federal rules that, if passed into law, could require crypto exchanges to hold their assets with a federal- or state-chartered bank to act as a custodian over customers' virtual currency.\n\nThe proposal puts crypto firms in a \"no-win\" scenario, SEC commissioner Mark Uyeda wrote in a statement on Wednesday. U.S. regulators have already warned banks that dealing with crypto exposes them to an array of risks, including fraud and scam.\n\n\"In other words, an adviser may custody crypto assets at a bank, but banks are cautioned by their regulators not to custody crypto assets,\" Uyeda wrote.\n\nGet CNBC's free Warren Buffett Guide to Investing, which distills the billionaire's No. 1 best piece of advice for regular investors, do's and don'ts, and three key investing principles into a clear and simple guidebook.\n\nSign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletter"

        "title": "What Are Consensus Mechanisms in Blockchain and Cryptocurrency? - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is a Consensus Mechanism?\n\nA consensus mechanism is a program used in blockchain systems to achieve distributed agreement about the ledger's state. Generally, it is implemented in a network with many processes and users. Cryptocurrencies, blockchains, and distributed ledgers benefit from their use because the consensus mechanism replaces much slower human verifiers and auditing.\n\nFor instance, the Bitcoin blockchain uses a mechanism called Proof-of-Work (PoW), which requires computational power to solve an encrypted puzzle, called the hash. After the hash is solved by one miner (or a group working together), Bitcoin's PoW requires that every node on the network verifies the data that has been changed by checking:\n\nThe data structure\n\nThe block header hash\n\nThe block timestamp\n\nThe block size\n\nThe first transaction\n\nIt then completes a long transaction verification checklist. This verification takes much less time than the process of solving the hash, which is called mining, and is orders of magnitude less time-consuming than human verification.\n\nKey Takeaways A consensus mechanism is any method used to achieve agreement, trust, and security across a decentralized computer network.\n\nIn the context of blockchains and cryptocurrencies, proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) are two of the most prevalent consensus mechanisms.\n\nConsensus mechanisms play an essential part of securing information by encrypting it and using automated group verification.\n\nHistory of Consensus Mechanisms\n\nWhen computers and networks began gaining popularity in the 1980s and 90s, shared databases were created so that multiple users could access the information they stored. Most had a centralized database with permissions that users accessed from different stations. This setup evolved into centralized networks with administrators who granted user rights and maintained the integrity of the data.\n\nThese shared databases became known as distributed ledgers because they recorded information and were networked for many users in different locations to access. One of the most significant issues that needed addressing was that of preventing data tampering and unauthorized access, whether it was malicious or not. A method to automate distributed database management was required to ensure data was not changed.\n\nThis need led to the creation of distributed autonomous consensus, where programs on a network agreed on a database's state using cryptographic techniques. Agreement was designed to be reached using encryption algorithms to create long strings of alphanumeric numbers\u2014called a hash\u2014which were then verified by programs running on the network. A hash only changes if the information input into the hashing algorithm is changed, so the programs were designed to compare hashes to ensure they matched.\n\nWhen each program running on the network created a matching alphanumeric string, the data was said to be agreed upon by consensus of the network. Thus, consensus mechanisms were made, with credit generally given to Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous Bitcoin creator. However, many people worked on consensus mechanisms for years before Nakamoto released the whitepaper that made Bitcoin famous.\n\nData and computer scientists such as Moni Naor, Cynthia Dwork, Adam Beck, Nick Szabo, and many others worked on and contributed to developing networked consensus mechanisms.\n\nTypes of Consensus Mechanisms\n\nThere are different kinds of consensus mechanism algorithms, each of which works on different principles.\n\nThe proof of work (PoW) is a common consensus algorithm used by the most popular cryptocurrency networks like Bitcoin and Litecoin. It requires a participant node to prove that the work done and submitted by them qualifies them to receive the right to add new transactions to the blockchain. However, the bitcoin mining mechanism requires high energy consumption and long processing times.\n\nThe proof of stake (PoS) is another common consensus algorithm that evolved as a low-cost, low-energy consuming alternative to the PoW algorithm. It involves allocating responsibility in maintaining the public ledger to a participant node in proportion to the number of virtual currency tokens held. However, this has the drawback that it incentivizes hoarding instead of spending.\n\nProof of History (PoH) was developed by the Solana Project. It is similar to Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET), which encodes the passage of time itself cryptographically to achieve consensus without expending many resources.\n\nWhile PoW and PoS are by far the most prevalent in the blockchain space, there are other consensus algorithms like Proof of Capacity (PoC) which allow sharing of memory space of the contributing nodes on the blockchain network. The more memory or hard disk space a node has, the more rights it is granted for maintaining the public ledger. Proof of Activity (PoA), used on the Decred blockchain, is a hybrid that makes use of aspects of both PoW and PoS. Proof of Burn (PoB) requires transactors to send small amounts of cryptocurrency to inaccessible wallet addresses, in effect \"burning\" them out of existence.\n\nFuture of Consensus Mechanisms\n\nWhile used by all cryptocurrencies, consensus mechanisms are just as important in distributed ledger networks used by enterprises. Platforms have been created for business and government use, allowing each entity to choose from modules created for their needs, backed by consensus mechanisms. Hyperledger Fabric, one of the more well-known distributed ledger platforms, provides different consensus mechanisms. For example, one entity might not need proof-of-work, considered byzantine fault tolerant, whereas another might not need that level of consensus.\n\nCryptocurrency's future may be unknown and volatile, but consensus mechanisms remain an essential part of emerging technology. They ensure data safety and integrity and keep those with nefarious intentions locked out of distributed ledgers.\n\nWhich Consensus Mechanism Is Best? The best consensus mechanism is one that fits the needs of the users. Proof of work is thought to be best for Bitcoin, while proof of stake was adopted by Ethereum and is believed to be best by its community. Other mechanisms might work better for enterprises, businesses, or personal uses.\n\nWhat Is an Example of a Consensus Mechanism? Proof of stake is one example. In this mechanism, users \"stake\" their tokens to be given the privilege of conducting work on the blockchain for rewards like transaction fees.\n\nWhat Are the Types of Consensus Mechanisms? Several have been created, but only a few have been implemented. Some types besides proof of work and proof of stake are delegated proof of stake, proof of importance, proof of elapsed time, proof of authority, and proof of capacity. Each uses different concepts to validate data changes.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nConsensus mechanisms have become an essential aspect of distributed ledgers, databases, and blockchains because much of the world is becoming more digital. Ownership of physical assets is being tokenized on ledgers and blockchains, people without access to financial services have access through blockchains, and businesses need data security more than ever.\n\nConsensus mechanisms verify data inputs and outputs, which translates to automatically auditing the digital transactions that are common today\u2014without human oversight or intervention. They create an environment where you don't need to trust that the other party in a transaction is honest because they ensure the information is unalterable and secure.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (\u201cICOs\u201d) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

        "title": "Crypto is here to save the grid. Or crash it. - E&E News by POLITICO",
        "content": "Like energy, cryptocurrency is subject to booms and busts \u2014 and last year was definitely a bust.\n\nBut with the value of bitcoin and other digital currencies beginning to rebound after plummeting in 2022, there are renewed concerns that cryptominers could wreak havoc on the electric grid and U.S. carbon-cutting plans.\n\nThat has prompted crypto companies to reframe their role on the grid, eyeing ways to both minimize power demand and boost ties to renewable energy. The industry is aware that a possible regulatory crackdown could halt the days of unfettered electricity use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is an industry with a lot of ethical holes in it, and one of the biggest is the impact on the environment,\u201d Erran Carmel, a technology professor at American University, said of cryptocurrency.\n\nCryptocurrency has long been branded a climate villain. Companies acquire virtual coins by solving a series of computational puzzles in a \u201cmining\u201d process that essentially requires a fleet of computers to be running for long hours. Depending on where those computers are located, the load may be met by natural gas or coal plants, delaying a transition to renewable energy and generating more climate-warming emissions.\n\nAccording to a report from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, as of August 2022, total global electricity use for crypto was as high as 240 billion kilowatt-hours per year, more than the total electricity used in a year by Argentina.\n\nIn the United States \u2014 which hosts about a third of the world\u2019s crypto operations \u2014 the industry accounted for between 0.9 percent to 1.7 percent of the country\u2019s total electricity usage, higher than all residential lighting, the White House office found.\n\nThat sort of energy pull prompted New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) to sign legislation imposing a moratorium on new crypto mining in the state last year. Other state and local governments have placed their own restrictions on new crypto mining or imposed requirements that it run on renewable energy.\n\nRestrictions that go too far could hurt the industry at a time when it is looking to reshape its energy story, said John Olsen, New York state lead for the Blockchain Association.\n\n\u201cOther areas of the country have embraced this technology and enabled the kind of out-of-the-box thinking where we don\u2019t just rely on hydro or wind or solar, but have ways of curtailing emissions, capturing waste and even contributing to the overall health of the economy,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cA moratorium puts us a few steps back.\u201d\n\nFor example, he said, some crypto mines have taken root in areas where renewable energy might go to waste, offering a load that can support large-scale projects. In Texas, bitcoin companies have shown that toggling their demand up and down can help stabilize prices on the grid.\n\nThe strategy isn\u2019t just a regulatory dodge or good spin, said Joe Burnett, a mining analyst for bitcoin company Blockware Solutions. It\u2019s also good business.\n\n\u201cIf bitcoin miners are inefficient and nonprofitable, governments should let them fail,\u201d Burnett said. \u201cThis industry has the potential to balance energy grids and help supply. And I think that\u2019s a viable future for mining companies.\u201d\n\nThe power dilemma\n\nCrypto mining dipped throughout 2022, with the website digiconomist.net estimating the industry\u2019s energy use dropped more than 60 percent between January and December.\n\nThat reflects 2022\u2019s so-called \u201ccrypto winter,\u201d when prices crashed as a number of companies failed and investors pulled out of the volatile and still risky market.\n\nThe collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX Trading Ltd. in November 2022 after a liquidity crisis and allegations of fraud against CEO Sam Bankman-Fried marked a thud near the end of the year that further drove prices down and increased regulatory scrutiny.\n\nWith little reward, mining naturally went down. But activity was also dented by rising electricity and natural gas prices, said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas, Austin, who has consulted for crypto companies.\n\n\u201cThe main cost of these systems is electricity. It\u2019s basically a bunch of computers guessing at a particular number for trillions of guesses, which takes a lot of energy,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cSo as bitcoin prices fell, electricity prices went up. You\u2019re getting squeezed from both sides.\u201d\n\nAccording to a study by analytics firm Hashrate Index \u2014 backed by mining company Luxor Technologies \u2014 10 of the most popular states for cryptocurrency mines saw electricity prices rise between 2021 and 2022, led by a 43 percent increase in Georgia. That trend, the report says, likely contributed to the bankruptcy of Core Scientific and other cryptomining companies.\n\nThe report found that crypto companies in states with abundant hydropower and less natural gas saw the smallest price increases and had more market stability.\n\n\u201cMany miners learned a painful but important lesson in 2022: securing a low, long-term electricity price is vital to the mining business,\u201d Hashrate Index said.\n\nAs bitcoin prices have ticked up from a low point in 2022, Hashrate Index found that the computing power behind bitcoin has also risen, hitting a record peak on Jan. 20.\n\nThat has coincided with increased regulatory attention from some states and countries.\n\nOregon lawmakers have proposed a bill that would require crypto miners and data centers to meet the state\u2019s greenhouse gas reduction goals, including a 100 percent reduction by 2040. In Washington state, a new bill would require large loads served by municipal and public utilities to meet clean energy standards that currently apply to customers of investor-owned utilities.\n\nBoth states have seen an influx of crypto companies seeking low-cost, reliable hydropower. British Columbia and Manitoba in Canada have also implemented moratoria on new crypto connections.\n\nWhether renewable requirements make a difference remains to be seen.\n\nTake Missoula County in Montana, which in 2021 adopted new zoning rules mandating that crypto miners be powered with new renewable energy, either generated on site or purchased elsewhere. The rules came after the county saw a power drain and residential complaints from expanding operations by miner HyperBlock Inc., which set up shop there seeking out Montana\u2019s relatively cheap power prices.\n\nHyperBlock filed for bankruptcy in 2020 during a dip in bitcoin prices.\n\nSince the rules went into effect, no new crypto companies have applied to come to Missoula County, said Jennie Dixon of the county\u2019s Department of Planning, Development and Sustainability.\n\nIn a September report, the Office of Science and Technology Policy recommended that any policy on cryptocurrency consider its environmental and electricity impact and called for federal agencies to conduct reliability assessments for crypto mining and explore environmental standards.\n\nThe report also said that regulators could work with Congress on possible energy conservation standards for the industry.\n\nThe Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Department of Energy did not respond to requests for comment from E&E News about future regulations.\n\nEnvironmental regulations have chased crypto miners around the globe. A large share of the industry was housed in China until 2021, when the country\u2019s government cracked down on mining and cryptocurrency transactions in part because of environmental concerns.\n\nMany companies relocated to coal-heavy Kazakhstan and the United States. A study published in the journal Joule found that, on the whole, the global industry used less renewable energy after that shift because of the power mix in the new locations.\n\nAmerican University\u2019s Carmel said that as governments come to grips with the environmental impact of the industry, bitcoin miners are \u201cdrifting from country to country to find an unregulated environment.\u201d Right now, he said, the United States offers a balance of unregulated sites and the potential for cheap power.\n\nA path forward\n\nOn the other hand, some states are instead encouraging cryptocurrency miners to move in, eager to have an emerging technology take root there. And the miners say that despite the concerns elsewhere, they can be responsible \u2014 and beneficial \u2014 grid participants.\n\nWyoming lawmakers have considered legislation that would create deregulated power zones for large industrial customers, allowing them to operate off the regulated grid and get massive quantities of power at low prices. Supporters say that could further enable renewables to be built to support those operations, while detractors have warned it could weaken the business model for existing utilities.\n\nTexas has actively recruited cryptocurrency miners, with at least 30 companies building operations there.\n\nAccording to data from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) \u2014 the grid operator covering about 90 percent of the state\u2019s power load \u2014 cryptocurrency miners consumed about 477 megawatts of continuous consumption per day over a 291-day period in 2022. ERCOT estimates that 1 MW can power 200 homes during times of peak demand.\n\nFor a grid that saw widespread blackouts in 2021, adding a load of that size has raised reliability questions.\n\nIn December, ERCOT announced a voluntary program that would allow bitcoin miners to reduce power during high demand periods, building on a pilot launched last summer. That can reduce the grid\u2019s demand during winter storms and heat waves, while also offering crypto mines a potential source of income by selling back power when prices are higher.\n\nRhodes, the Texas researcher, said his research shows that under certain conditions a flexible cryptocurrency industry could result in more renewables being added to the grid because they offer a low-cost source of power that would not need to run continuously.\n\nBut, he added, matching \u201ccontrollable load with uncontrollable generation\u201d would require companies to \u201cbe economically flexible.\u201d\n\nBlockware\u2019s Burnett said that similar demand response programs could offer a responsible path forward for the mining industry, soaking up excess power from renewables and selling it during peak times.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in demand response mode, you enable consumers to have power without paying these ridiculous prices,\u201d Burnett said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about energy that would already be wasted during normal times that can be used to mine.\u201d\n\nOn the flip side, University of Houston energy fellow Ed Hirs wrote in a Barron\u2019s editorial that allowing large users to sell back to the grid amounted to \u201ccronyism\u201d that would drive up prices for other consumers.\n\nEven with demand response, critics say that adding significant load to a national grid in the midst of an energy transition is likely to keep fossil fuel plants online longer.\n\nSustainable Bitcoin Protocol, a new company backed by major bitcoin miners, is seeking to put heft behind the environmental promise by offering transferrable assets representing coins mined with 100 percent clean power.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure there\u2019s no greenwashing in bitcoin,\u201d said Elliot David, Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol\u2019s head of climate strategy and partnerships, alluding to the practice of making something appear more environmentally friendly than it is.\n\nThe company will use third-party platforms to track the energy sources going into a mining company, then offer a separate certificate similar to a renewable energy certificate to that company, which can be sold on the market.\n\nDavid said the company doesn\u2019t just want to push existing miners to use renewables, but will eventually make the full industry climate positive as it expands.\n\n\u201cBitcoin basically converts and monetizes electricity into a globally liquid currency,\u201d he said. \u201cSo a place with high energy costs could use it to enable and unleash clean energy development. That\u2019s why we want to maximize green sources.\u201d\n\nBut those efforts can only be considered successful if you think that cryptocurrency mining is a necessity, said Carmel, the technology professor.\n\n\u201cOn a micro level, crypto mining companies may use alternative energy sources \u2026 and may work on a dynamic basis on the grid, which is good. But on a macro level, we have a responsibility to reduce the environmental impact of any industry and of course any pollution,\u201d Carmel said. \u201cThat forces you to consider the main question: Is there a higher purpose to crypto, or is this just a Las Vegas casino?\u201d"

        "title": "Explained: Bitcoin Ordinals and how they compare to traditional NFTs - CNBCTV18",
        "content": "For the longest time, the utility of Bitcoin was limited to storing and transferring value. As such, developer activity on the world\u2019s oldest blockchain network was minimal, to say the least. Fortunately, this began to change with the emergence of Bitcoin DeFi protocols such as Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Stacks (STX), Rootstock (RBTC), etc.\n\nThese platforms brought the world of crypto borrowing and lending to the Bitcoin network and created new use cases for the big daddy of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnd now, the utility of the Bitcoin network has been expanded even further, thanks to the arrival of the Ordinals Protocol. This latest innovation allows developers and artists to create and store digital artefacts directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. The protocol has been a massive hit, with more than 100,000 ordinals minted so far.\n\nThe introduction of this technology has also sent Bitcoin metrics skyrocketing. For instance, the number of non-zero Bitcoin addresses hit a record of 44 million following the introduction of ordinals. In addition, Bitcoin\u2019s block sizes have also increased after ordinals were launched, even touching an all-time high of 2.5MB on Feb 12.\n\nBut what are Bitcoin Ordinals, why are they causing such a stir, and how do they compare to traditional NFTs? Tag along to find out.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals: What are they?\n\nAs you may know, the smallest denomination of BTC is known as a satoshi or a Sat - one BTC is equal to 100,000,0000 sats. The Ordinals Protocol allows users to send and receive sats that carry optional extra data. This data can be text, JPEGs, audio or videos.\n\nAdding such kinds of data to a satoshi is known as inscription and the end result can be considered as a Bitcoin NFT or an ordinal. Since the launch of the Ordinals Protocol on Jan 21, nearly 100,000 inscribed satoshis have been minted, including a collection of Ordinal Punks and Ordinal Penguins. For the unacquainted, these are Bitcoin offshoots of popular NFT collections.\n\nIt is important to note that ordinals are only possible thanks to the \u201cwitness section\u201d of Bitcoin transactions that was introduced after the Taproot soft fork in 2021. This is where the JPEGs, audio files or videos are inscribed into the individual sats. These digital artefacts are also made possible through the 2017 Segwit update, a soft fork that increased block sizes from 1MB to 4MB.\n\nAre ordinals NFTs?\n\nBitcoin Ordinals can be considered NFTs, but they have a few differences. To begin with, most NFTs are created and tracked through a smart contract. However, the assets that these smart contracts represent are often hosted elsewhere.\n\nFor example, some NFT platforms make use of the decentralised storage system, IPFS, to store the NFT artworks/audio files/videos. However, ordinals are inscribed into the satoshi and therefore, these Bitcoin-NFTs are stored on-chain. They are validated in blocks along with other transactions and stored in the network\u2019s distributed ledger.\n\nMoreover, traditional NFTs usually have metadata that allows creators to change the appearance and characteristics of an NFT. For instance, some NFT projects will ask users to refresh their metadata to update their NFTs with higher-resolution images.\n\nHowever, since ordinals are stored on-chain, their data is immutable and cannot be changed. Also, unlike NFTs, ordinals do not provide creators with the option to receive royalties on subsequent sales.\n\nIn a nutshell, ordinals are immutable and complete digital artefacts. Unlike traditional NFTs, they cannot be tampered with and they reside completely on-chain. For these reasons, the creator of the Ordinals Protocol, Casey Rodarmor, believes that these digital artefacts are \u201cintended to reflect what NFTs should be.\u201d\n\nOrdinals break records but also receive flak\n\nSince their introduction, Ordinals have been a huge hit. They have brought thousands of new users to the Bitcoin blockchain. Evidence of this is in the fact that non-zero Bitcoin addresses touched a record 44 million on Feb 14.\n\nMoreover, since these satoshis carry extra on-chain data, Bitcoin block sizes have also increased over the last couple of weeks. Recently, Bitcoin registered its largest-ever block, coming in at a massive 2.52MB. In comparison, the average Bitcoin block size before the introduction of ordinals was around 0.7 MB to 1.5 MB.\n\nPreviously, miners only received network fees for monetary transactions. However, with the introduction of ordinals, the network will be used for non-monetary purposes for the first time in its history. This will increase the transaction volumes and bring more revenue for miners.\n\nAs such, data from Glassnode indicates that miners have collected nearly $600,000 in transaction fees from ordinals in the last two months alone. Such an additional revenue stream could be extremely important when block rewards dwindle or no longer exist in the future.\n\nHowever, not everyone is on board with these digital artefacts. For instance, in a recent tweet, Adam Black, the CEO of Blockstream, referred to ordinals as a frivolous waster of block space. Others highlighted the increase in transaction fees thanks to ordinals.\n\n\u201cMarginalized peoples in developing countries will have to pay more to run their Bitcoin nodes and send transactions because privileged wealthy whites want to put JPEG drawings on the blockchain as status symbols,\u201d read a tweet from the popular crypto Twitter handle, Bitcoin is Saving.\n\nThen there\u2019s also the issue of power consumption. Bitcoin is known for its astronomical energy usage and the influx of ordinals is not helping this in any way.\n\n\u201cThe carbon footprint of NFTs on Ethereum wasn\u2019t looking great before The Merge, but it was nothing compared to the latest hype: on-chain Bitcoin NFTs,\u201d said Alex de Vries, a prominent data scientist, in a LinkedIn post.\n\nConclusion\n\nLove it or hate it, ordinals are transforming the Bitcoin blockchain. They bring added utility and could expand the user base of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency. Moreover, they could lead to further innovation and more practical use cases in the future. As such, most Bitcoiners are welcoming these digital artefacts with open arms.\n\nAlso read: Crypto market reacts to BUSD shutdown and experts predict the fate of stablecoins"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) hit a six-month high of $24,800 on Feb. 16, registering a double-digit surge of 15%.\n\nThe single-day Bitcoin price surge took many by surprise, given February has been historically bearish for the top cryptocurrency. BTC\u2019s price rose by $1,820 in a single day, making it the biggest green day for the top cryptocurrency in six months.\n\nOne-day Bitcoin price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nMany people attributed the BTC price surge to several factors, including a rise in dollar value and declining inflation. On-chain data indicates the current price momentum can be traced back to a mysterious fund that started pouring money into the crypto market on Feb. 10.\n\nAccording to data from Lookonchain, nearly $1.6 billion in institutional funds have flowed into the crypto market over the past six days. Most of the $1.6 billion flowed from stablecoins, especially Circle-issued USD Coin (USDC). The owner of the funds first withdrew their USDC from Circle and then sent it to various exchanges.\n\nUSDC withdrawal from Circle. Source: Lookonchain\n\nThere were three notable wallets whose funds were traced from Circle to various exchanges. First, a wallet address starting with \u201c0x308F\u201d withdrew 155 million USDC from Circle and transferred to exchanges since Feb. 10. The second wallet address starting with \u201c0xad6e\u201d withdrew 397 million USDC from Circle and sent it to various exchanges, and a third wallet starting with \u201c0x3356\u201d withdrew 953.6 million USDC from Circle and transferred to exchanges around the same time.\n\nWallets moving funds from Circle to exchanges. Source: Lookonchain\n\nThe Bitcoin price surge comes just days after the top cryptocurrency hit its first-ever weekly death cross. The death cross appears on a chart when an asset\u2019s short-term moving average, usually the 50-day, crosses below its long-term moving average, usually the 200-day. Despite the bearish nature of the pattern, the death cross has been followed by above-average short-term returns in recent years.\n\nThe crypto community reacted differently, with Bitcoin proponents calling it the start of another bull run. Samson Mow commented on the price surge, \u201cBTC price is still below the 200 WMA, which is 25k. Bitcoin trading below the 200 WMA is an anomaly.\u201d In each of its major market cycles, Bitcoin\u2019s price historically bottoms out around the 200-week moving average. Others called the recent price surge a bear trap while warning that large players are cashing out."

On the other hand, Bitcoin borrowers can only bet against (short) the cryptocurrency. Unlike futures contracts, the balance between margin longs and shorts isn\u2019t always matched.\n\nOKX stablecoin/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nThe above chart shows that OKX traders\u2019 margin lending ratio increased between Jan. 13 and Jan. 15, signaling that professional traders added leverage long positions as Bitcoin price broke above the $23,500 resistance.\n\nOne might argue that the demand for borrowing stablecoins for bullish positioning is excessive as a stablecoin/BTC margin lending ratio above 30 is unusual. However, traders tend to deposit more collateral after a few days or weeks, causing the indicator to exit the FOMO level.\n\nOptions traders remain skeptical of a sustained rally\n\nTraders should also analyze options markets to understand whether the recent rally has caused investors to become more risk-averse. The 25% delta skew is a telling sign whenever arbitrage desks and market makers are overcharging for upside or downside protection.\n\nThe indicator compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options and will turn positive when fear is prevalent because the protective put options premium is higher than risk call options.\n\nIn short, the skew metric will move above 10% if traders fear a Bitcoin price crash. On the other hand, generalized excitement reflects a negative 10% skew.\n\nRelated: $24K Bitcoin \u2014 Is it time to buy BTC and altcoins? Watch Market Talks live\n\nBitcoin 60-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas\n\nNotice that the 25% delta skew has been neutral for the past two weeks, signaling equal pricing for bullish and bearish strategies. This reading is highly unusual considering Bitcoin gained 16.2% from Jan. 13 to Jan. 16 and typically, one would expect excessive bullishness causing the skew to move below negative 10.\n\nOne thing is for sure, a lack of bearish sentiment is present in futures and options markets. Still, there are some concerning data on excessive margin demand for leverage buying, although it is too soon to call it worrisome.\n\nThe longer Bitcoin remains above $24,000, the more comfortable those pro traders become with the current rally. Moreover, bears using futures markets had $235 million liquidated between Jan. 15 and Jan. 16, resulting in a decreasing appetite for bearish bets. Hence, the derivatives markets continue to favor bullish momentum.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "What Is Wrapped Crypto?\n\nBy Mohammad Musharraf\n\nRead 6 min Medium\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS \u2014 A wrapped crypto token is a tokenized representation of a particular cryptocurrency, with the exact same value, that is operable on another blockchain.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Wrapped tokens make it easy to transfer value across blockchains, which otherwise lack interoperability, and power a cross-chain decentralized finance ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Some of the most popular wrapped tokens are WBTC, WETH, WMATIC, and renBTC.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges facing the blockchain and crypto space is the lack of interoperability of different blockchains and their respective assets.\n\nThat means you cannot directly transfer a cryptocurrency based on chain X to chain Y and use it there. Blockchains, by design, cannot enable such cross-chain digital asset support.\n\nWith decentralized finance (DeFi) predominantly on Ethereum, but coins and tokens existing across multiple other blockchains, supporting assets cross-chain has become crucial for cryptocurrencies and DeFi.\n\nThis is where wrapped crypto tokens come into the picture. You might have heard people mention \u201cwrapped Bitcoin\u201d or \u201cwrapped Ether\u201d. But what are they exactly?\n\nWhat Is Wrapped Crypto?\n\nWrapped crypto or wrapped tokens are digital assets that; represent the exact value of an original cryptocurrency from a different blockchain or follow a different token standard to the chain its on. WBTC and WETH are good examples of the former and latter respectively.\n\nWrapping original tokens to mint new tokens compliant with another blockchain allows users to use assets from one chain on another chain entirely.\n\nFor instance, let\u2019s use Bitcoin (BTC) as an example. By design, bitcoin can originally only function inside the Bitcoin ecosystem. But what if you want to use the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency on the world\u2019s largest dApp blockchain Ethereum?\n\nIn short, there\u2019s a way to deposit your BTC from your Bitcoin wallet and receive wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) \u2014 an ERC-20 token \u2014 in your Ethereum wallet.\n\nThe WBTC you receive will be a wrapped crypto token. In short, it represents the original value of the BTC that you deposited. Owning that wrapped Bitcoin then means you can use Ethereum-based decentralized application that support wrapped bitcoin transactions. Put simply, you can transfer the value of bitcoin while using Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nAs mentioned, \u201cwrapping\u201d is a just figurative term used to describe the minting or creation of a new token that derives its value from an underlying digital asset.\n\nTo understand this better, let\u2019s take a look at how wrapped crypto actually works.\n\nHow Do Wrapped Crypto Tokens Work?\n\nSo far, you know that a wrapped token is an equivalent representation of a cryptocurrency based on a different blockchain. Or, in some cases, it is a representation of an asset based on the same chain, but having a different token standard.\n\nBut how do we exactly \u201cwrap\u201d these tokens?\n\nLet\u2019s go back to wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) for a moment.\n\nFor starters, there are three types of entities involved in the wrapping of BTC to create an equivalent amount of WBTC on Ethereum:\n\n1. Merchants: Entities that lock their BTC to mint new WBTC on Ethereum or, conversely, burn WBTC to free up the locked BTC.\n\n2. Custodians: Organizations responsible for securing the BTC reserves on the Bitcoin network.\n\n3: Wrapped Tokens DAO: A set of organizations that constitute a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and collectively decide what custodians and merchants to add or remove to WBTC Network. The organizations in the DAO use a multi-sig wallet to make these decisions.\n\nNow that you understand the three key players in WBTC, let\u2019s look at a simple step-by-step process of token wrapping:\n\nStep 1: A merchant sends 10 Bitcoin (BTC) to the custodian.\n\nStep 2: The custodian adds it to a reserve (a crypto wallet) whose proof is published on-chain.\n\nStep 3: An equal amount of ERC-20 compatible WBTC is minted on Ethereum.\n\nMerchants can follow a similar process to request to burn WBTC on the Ethereum blockchain and free an equal number of BTC on the Bitcoin network.\n\nWhile WBTC relies on a DAO model to ensure security and decentralization, wrapped tokens are issued either by centralized entities or smart contracts.\n\nHowever, most DeFi proponents advise against using a wrapped token managed by a centralized entity. This is because a central entity may, at any point, defraud its users by tampering with the asset reserves. These reserves determine a wrapped token\u2019s value. Thus, in situations like these, a wrapped token can lose significant value in a short time.\n\nApart from WBTC, there are several other wrapped tokens such as WETH, WMATIC, renBTC, WFTM. Across the DeFi space, there are multiple wrapper platforms issuing such tokens.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve understood how wrapped tokens work, let\u2019s check out what benefits they offer.\n\nBenefits of Wrapped Crypto Tokens\n\nThere are 197 countries in the world using around 180 different currencies. These countries have a combined total of thousands of banks.\n\nImagine a world where you were not able to send money from one bank to the other. Further still, imagine you visited a country that didn\u2019t allow you to exchange your currency for its own. That would make for a terrible financial ecosystem, where people would fail to experience anything beyond the limits of their own country or bank.\n\nCurrently, the same would be the case with users of different blockchains if not for wrapped tokens.\n\nAt the time of writing, BTC makes up over 40% of the crypto market\u2019s value. Following BTC is ETH, making up almost 20% of the market capitalization.\n\nThanks to WBTC and other wrapped representatives of BTC, Bitcoin users no more need to stay cut off from Ethereum, which boasts the largest DeFi ecosystem. They can simply go to a decentralized exchange and purchase WBTC. That way, the user gets the same exposure to BTC, but on Ethereum.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just about Bitcoin and Ethereum. In fact, there are a wide variety of wrapped tokens for transferring value between popular chains, such as Polygon, Solana and Avalanche.\n\nWith the help of wrapped tokens, users don\u2019t need to transfer their assets on one chain to a centralized exchange, convert it to another asset, and send it to another compatible chain. Instead, they can get their hands on a wrapped token representing their original asset.\n\nWhat Is Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)?\n\nWrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) is a joint initiative run by three Web3 entities: Kyber, Ren, and BitGo. These are three of the 15 entities in total that make up the Wrapped Tokens DAO. Collectively, they are responsible for minting and burning wrapped bitcoin. They also manage, i.e. add or remove, merchants and custodians.\n\nA total of 65 projects, protocols, and companies currently make up the Wrapped Bitcoin Network. These include lending and borrowing platforms, decentralized exchanges, centralized custodians. Wrapped Bitcoin is a now an integral part of many leading platforms and apps; from DeFi to much more.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s really easy to get started. Users can directly exchange their existing ERC-20 tokens to wrapped Bitcoin and back as it behaves just like any other fungible Ethereum token.\n\nWrapped Tokens on Ethereum\n\nAt the time of writing, the total value locked in DeFi is over $42 billion. More than $25 billion of that is on Ethereum, making it the single largest DeFi ecosystem. That only makes it practical for almost every project to make its token compatible with Ethereum token standard ERC-20.\n\nWrapped crypto comes to the rescue for projects building on different blockchains. Wrapping tokens, therefore making them ERC-20 compliant, enables a project\u2019s users to experience the speed and scalability of other chains. Plus, all of this is possible without missing out on Ethereum\u2019s large user base and liquidity.\n\nIn fact, since ETH was created before the ERC-20 standard was established, it does not comply with ERC-20. Hence, we use a wrapped version of ETH called \u2018wrapped ether\u2019 (WETH) across DeFi protocols on Ethereum.\n\nHow To Secure Wrapped Crypto Tokens\n\nWrapped tokens, or crypto tokens or any kind for that matter, are a form of digital value. And much like physical assets in the real world, protecting your digital assets (such as wrapped tokens) is imperative.\n\nSpeaking of security, nothing comes close to hardware wallets such as Ledger Nano S Plus, Nano X, and Stax in terms of securing your assets.\n\nLedger wallets keep your private keys and seed phrase offline at all times, ensuring no one can virtually tamper with or access your wrapped tokens. Despite your keys being offline, you can still access a wide range of DeFi protocols online through Ledger Live \u2014 a mobile and desktop application that connects with your Ledger wallet.\n\nThis brings maximum security to your wrapped tokens without compromising on your flexibility to use them across DeFi platforms.\n\nKnowledge is power"

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Prediction, 4 Altcoins to Buy Now: Crypto Chartmaster - Business Insider",
        "content": "Bitcoin can continue its impressive rally, but will eventually retest its lows and could potentially lose half its value, according to a self-described cryptocurrency evangelist.\n\nThe price of the world's biggest crypto has risen 48% year-to-date to an eight-month-high of $25,000 during a broader rebound for cryptos and other risk assets. Ether, the second-largest digital asset, has also roared back to life and is up 44% in 2023 to its highest level since mid-September.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nBut while both tokens appear to have upside ahead, ether currently looks like a better bet from a risk-reward standpoint, said Forrest Przybysz, the founder and CEO of crypto-focused firm Sistine Research, in a recent interview with Insider.\n\nWhat's next for bitcoin and ether?\n\nBitcoin is approaching a key technical resistance range of $28,000 to $32,000, according to Przybysz's charts. While the token could climb another 28% if investors continue to embrace risk during a wider market rally, Przybysz told Insider that bitcoin is likely to give up its gains.\n\nBitcoin will run into technical resistance in the high $20,000s and low $30,000s, which could send it back under $20,000. Forrest Przybysz, Sistine Research\n\nIf bitcoin's rally stalls, Przybysz's charts show that it would likely fall up to 24% to its nearest support level of $19,000, though a 50% decline to $12,700 is possible if the token can't hold that crucial mark. And in a worst-case scenario, bitcoin could slide to levels last seen in late 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, ether has solid support in the mid-$1,300s and could reach $2,000 or even $2,700 by the late first quarter or early second quarter, Przybysz said. In other words, while Przybysz's charts also indicate that ether could fall 20%, the token's potential upside of 57% is double that of bitcoin.\n\nEther is trading above technical support but could rise substantially. Forrest Przybysz, Sistine Research\n\nDespite their strong showings so far this year, bitcoin and ether are still about 64% below their all-time highs. And although Przybysz doesn't see bitcoin or ether breaking their price records before late 2024, he said what has broken is the bear market's structure, which is a solid start.\n\n\"I do think that there's potentially another leg up in crypto and then probably followed by a return to some of the lows that we've seen,\" Przybysz told Insider. \"And then once we get closer to the end of 2023 \u2014 maybe it's 2024 \u2014 we could start to see some buying behavior come in.\"\n\n4 tokens to target instead of bitcoin\n\nWhile bitcoin looks like a risky bet at current levels, Przybysz said that four smaller cryptos look attractive: ether (ETH), polygon (MATIC), quant (QNT), and chainlink (LINK). These altcoins have upside despite the brutal crypto winter of this past year, he said.\n\n\"There will be a lot of lower-cap cryptocurrencies \u2014 altcoins \u2014 that probably do put in all-time highs, just one-offs that decide to deviate and decouple,\" Przybysz said. \"We've already had some that are performing decently, potentially putting in new highs already. But those are pretty sparse \u2014 far and few between.\"\n\nBelow are the four cryptocurrencies that the chartmaster and research firm head is most bullish about right now, along with the symbol, market capitalization, and thesis for each."

Still, the tech titans aren\u2019t the only ones bringing innovation to the sector.\n\nIn an effort to highlight up-and-coming tech companies, Built In launched The Future 5 across seven major U.S. tech hubs. Each quarter, we will feature five early-stage tech companies, nonprofits or entrepreneurs in each of these hubs who just might be working on the next big thing. Read our round-up of Austin\u2019s rising companies from last quarter here.\n\n* * *\n\nOver the last few years, several tech companies \u2014 including many based in Chicago \u2014 have released new products that disrupted the music industry. Now, Wavlake is looking to make its mark on the industry after raising pre-seed funding and announcing plans to grow its artist streaming payment platform.\n\nWavlake was co-founded by musicians and producers Michael Rhee and Sam Means. Through the use of blockchain and Web3 tools, their platform helps support artists financially. Wavlake is a music and podcast streaming platform that allows artists to receive Bitcoin payments from their fans.\n\n\u201cI had been frustrated with music recommendation algorithms on streaming platforms for a long time. Then I learned about Lightning Network and how it enabled people to transmit Bitcoin to each other almost instantly around the world. The technology seemed like a great way to build a new kind of music streaming service that better-connected artists and fans,\u201d Rhee told Built In via email.\n\nIn December, Wavlake closed a pre-seed round led by Trammell Venture Partners, an Austin-based VC firm focused on backing early-stage Bitcoin-native startups. Wavlake did not disclose the amount of capital it raised; however, it said the funding would be put toward growing the company and its products.\n\nWe\u2019re hoping this helps inspire other companies and developers to make new and interesting music applications that are both fairer to artists and more enjoyable for fans.\u201d\n\nWith the new capital, Wavlake plans to onboard more artists and creators onto its platform. Over the next year, Rhee and Means said they will also build out the Wavlake team and improve the platform\u2019s foundation to better accommodate its growing artist base.\n\nBy continuing to build blockchain-enabled tools for creators, Wavlake hopes it can inspire others to create new technologies to support artists and their work.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t building any custom blockchain technology or issuing any kind of special token,\u201d Rhee said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping this helps inspire other companies and developers to make new and interesting music applications that are both fairer to artists and more enjoyable for fans.\u201d\n\nMore Chicago Future 5 CoverageThe Dibz Aims to Combat Clothing Waste With Online Shopping Platform"

        "title": "Crypto failed Black investors \u2014 and so has banking - Vox.com",
        "content": "Crypto was sold as a sort of lifeline to Black communities, as a way to build wealth outside of the mainstream financial system that many people, understandably, mistrust. The crypto complex told the story of a potential for riches, a way for people left out of more traditional financial apparatuses to get in, bombarding the Black population with marketing and ads featuring celebrities such as LeBron James and Spike Lee. The industry made it clear: If you didn\u2019t get in, well, you might just be missing out. Many Black investors picked up what marketers were putting down, investing in cryptocurrency at higher rates than their white counterparts \u2014 especially Black investors under 40.\n\nNow, cryptocurrencies are trading well below their 2021 highs. Many NFTs have plummeted in value and are essentially worthless. Some high-profile projects and companies in the space have imploded, and it\u2019s not clear what, if anything, customers who put their money into those entities will get back. All is not totally lost. Investors who got into cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum in the early days are still ahead (assuming they haven\u2019t lost the coins or had them scammed away). Crypto often goes through boom and bust cycles, and it\u2019s unlikely the ecosystem is dead.\n\nStill, Black investors were not generally among that early group to dive into crypto, as the Atlantic\u2019s Annie Lowrey notes. Instead, many of them got in late, and some appear to have bought high and sold low. According to a recent LendingTree survey, Black crypto investors were likelier than white crypto investors to say that they had borrowed money to make their investment and that they had sold their crypto for less than it was worth. In other words, some Black investors have been left holding the bag.\n\n\u201cThe idea that crypto is somehow providing an avenue that\u2019s easier than other forms doesn\u2019t pan out. It\u2019s not as democratizing and welcoming as suggested,\u201d said Algernon Austin, director of race and economic justice at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, who has spoken out in the past about the risks of crypto to Black communities. \u201cThe crypto industry is concerned about the crypto industry, it\u2019s not concerned about Black wealth.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a familiar tale throughout America\u2019s history, explained Mehrsa Baradaran, a law professor at the University of California Irvine and author of multiple books on financial inequality and the racial wealth gap. She drew parallels to housing contract sales offered to Black communities in the wake of the New Deal in the 1950s and \u201960s and to subprime home loans prior to the global financial crisis disproportionately made to communities of color. In both instances, Black consumers were targeted with predatory financial products existing somewhat on the margins.\n\nMost notably, she pointed to the Freedman\u2019s Savings and Trust Company, more colloquially known as the Freedman\u2019s Bank, a private savings bank established by Congress in the wake of the Civil War meant to help formerly enslaved people establish financial stability. The endeavor lasted for nine years and ended in disaster \u2014 its funds were mishandled, and eventually, the bank collapsed. Many depositors never saw their money again.\n\n\u201cYou have the perfect conditions that led to the Freedman\u2019s Bank, that led to the subprime crisis, that led to the contract sales after the New Deal, which is that capitalism is undergoing some shift and something is wrong and the government needs to handle it, but instead, they leave out certain people and then some terrible, exploitative incentive gets born, and someone is always going to step into that,\u201d Baradaran said.\n\n\u201cIt is a looting of people\u2019s money\u201d\n\nIn the 19th century, that took the shape of a bank that squandered Black people\u2019s money and sowed skepticism of the financial system that persists today. In the 21st century, it was a pitch to build wealth through a new, largely unregulated technology that would later see the bottom substantially fall out. \u201cIt is a looting of people\u2019s money,\u201d Baradaran said.\n\nTo back up a bit \u2014 or, rather, a lot, to after the Civil War \u2014 the US Congress established the Freedman\u2019s Bank in 1865. It was meant to serve as a savings institution for formerly enslaved people and their families, and deposits were supposed to be invested in \u201cstocks, bonds, Treasury notes, or other securities of the United States.\u201d Other loans weren\u2019t initially intended to be made.\n\nAs Baradaran explained in her 2017 book, The Color of Money: Black Banks and the Racial Wealth Gap, a bank wasn\u2019t exactly an ideal solution \u2014 giving formerly enslaved people land would have been better. \u201cBlacks had not asked for the bank, but land grants having been foreclosed on by violence and southern retrenchment, the bank was a stand-in,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe reformers promised the Black community that the bank was the preferred and proper means by which they would achieve land ownership on their own.\u201d\n\nThe Freedman\u2019s Bank opened in New York in April of 1865 and over the course of a few years built up 19 branches. Eventually, the bank hit 37 branches and had tens of thousands of depositors. People were allowed to open accounts with as little as 5 cents, and most deposits were under $60. The bank struggled financially, and in 1867, its headquarters were moved to Washington, DC, and a new group of bankers, politicians, and businessmen took the wheel. Congress changed the bank\u2019s charter to let the people now running the show invest in real estate and railroads, and they started to make risky bets. When financial panic hit in 1873, it took an enormous toll on the Freedman\u2019s Bank, and the value of its investments plunged. There was a run on several branches, meaning many depositors tried to get their money out all at once, and by the time Congress sent regulators to take a look under the hood at what was going on, it was largely too late.\n\nIn 1874, abolitionist and writer Frederick Douglass was brought in to run the bank, but he quickly realized it was \u201cthe black man\u2019s cow, but the white man\u2019s milk.\u201d Less than two months later, he described the situation as being \u201cmarried to a corpse\u201d and recommended Congress shutter the bank, which it did in June of that year. The bank\u2019s assets were not backed by the federal government \u2014 a fact many customers had not realized \u2014 and many customers\u2019 deposits were gone.\n\nIn The Souls of Black Folk, W.E.B. Du Bois wrote that \u201cnot even ten additional years of slavery could have done so much to throttle the thrift of the freedmen as the mismanagement and bankruptcy of the series of savings banks chartered by the Nation for their special aid.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat should have happened in 1865 is that the treasonous Southerners should have lost their land because they had fought for the right to maintain slavery, and the people who for hundreds of years had grown the land should have gotten it,\u201d Baradaran said in an interview. Instead, they got a poorly run bank, their money was squandered on irresponsible investments, and they were left with nothing.\n\nWhen the mainstream system doesn\u2019t work \u2014 and it really doesn\u2019t for many Black Americans \u2014 it\u2019s natural to look elsewhere for something that does\n\nThe incident contributed to an ongoing mistrust of banks among Black communities. And in the modern day, it\u2019s also hard not to see the parallels between the Freedman\u2019s Bank and the most recent crypto implosion, where once again upstart institutions meant to be a new avenue for people to build wealth have gone bottoms-up or, at the very least, are teetering. \u201cThis is what you see with bitcoin, you get the scammers and the hucksters and the fraud, people who come in and say, \u2018Look, we\u2019re going to exploit people\u2019s genuine desire to build wealth in a fucked-up system,\u2019\u201d Baradaran said.\n\nWhen the mainstream system doesn\u2019t work \u2014 and it really doesn\u2019t for many Black Americans \u2014 it\u2019s natural to look elsewhere for something that does. That\u2019s where the appeal of something like crypto resides. People are told it\u2019s a way to establish financial independence and freedom and get away from the institutions that have wronged them in the past. It\u2019s a prospect that\u2019s easy to want to believe in.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to recognize that the Black population has more economic hardship and economic insecurity than the white population or the US population overall on average. You have more poverty, higher rates of debt, higher rates of insecurity, unstable work hours, unaffordable housing, there are a number of financial stresses in the lives of many African Americans,\u201d Austin said. \u201cSo when you\u2019re worrying how you\u2019re going to pay your bills regularly and how you\u2019re going to get ahead and someone shows up and says, \u2018I have the solution, and this will help you pay all your bills and help you pay your kids\u2019 college and the house that you\u2019ve always dreamed about,\u2019 that\u2019s pretty enticing.\u201d\n\nCharlotte Principato, financial services analyst at polling firm Morning Consult, said Black Americans \u201cshow through their higher ownership of cryptocurrency than adults of other races or ethnicities that they are open to alternative forms of payment and investment outside the sphere of traditional finance\u201d and that it\u2019s \u201cnot surprising\u201d that they\u2019re interested in alternative assets given that the mainstream system has not served them well. \u201cIt makes sense that they would try to stake their claim and find success,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is unfortunate that it is that way with such a speculative asset.\u201d\n\nIn conversations with crypto proponents over the years, I\u2019ve heard time and time again that it is specifically good for communities of color, that it\u2019s solving a problem for the unbanked, meaning people without banking access, and the underbanked, people who have banking accounts but often rely on other financial services, such as payday loans and check-cashing services, in the day to day.\n\nIt\u2019s an argument that\u2019s nice to believe. It\u2019s also one that often falls apart: With potential upside risk comes a lot of the downside risk we\u2019re seeing today.\n\nFor one thing, it\u2019s rare to hear people who work on financial inclusion more broadly offer up crypto as a solution. They\u2019re much likelier to push for postal banking and public banking and advocate for more credit unions. It\u2019s hard to see how a hyper-capitalist, unregulated system would avoid the mistakes our already-capitalist, sometimes lightly regulated system already entails. And to state the obvious here, the crypto industry is here to make money. Businesses in the space aren\u2019t generally doing business out of the goodness of their hearts.\n\n\u201cThe marketing campaign is not out of generosity or philanthropy, that\u2019s the business model, the business model requires getting as many people as possible so then prices go up,\u201d Austin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an investment that\u2019s built on providing any goods or service, so once you understand that, you understand you\u2019re really resting on herd mentality, only then you have to go with the herd and then make sure to jump away before it goes off the cliff.\u201d\n\nMany investors \u2014 including many Black investors \u2014 did not jump away soon enough.\n\nTo be sure, the crypto industry has not completely imploded, though many big names in the arena have. There are plenty of people who still say they believe it is an avenue for building wealth. Charlene Fadirepo, a regulator turned bitcoin activist, told me she thinks the 2022 market crash was an \u201cincredible teachable moment\u201d for crypto investors to become safe, smart, and confident. \u201cTo be honest, traditional banking doesn\u2019t have a great track record dealing with Black consumers,\u201d she said, an assertion that is hard to dispute. She still believes bitcoin, specifically, has an appeal in offering \u201cfinancial autonomy,\u201d though she\u2019s somewhat dubious of other cryptocurrencies. \u201cThere are fundamentals that promote bitcoin as a long-term investment ... that is not the case for all cryptocurrencies,\u201d she said.\n\nFadirepo recalled a recent class she was teaching on crypto in South Carolina where a Black woman in the class said she had lost $3,000 when Celsius, a now-bankrupt crypto lender, failed. The woman didn\u2019t want people to feel bad for her, Fadirepo said, but wanted people to realize they need to protect their crypto by storing it in a \u201ccold storage wallet,\u201d meaning not on a third-party platform and not connected to the internet. \u201cI could have talked for hours, but that one anecdote shifted the conversation in the room,\u201d she said. \u201cI see a bright side here, and that bright side is just encouraging a level of investor discipline and a real need to be informed.\u201d\n\nThat people sometimes just need to learn lessons from their mistakes is something you hear often in investing; there\u2019s a line of thought that loss is sometimes just an opportunity to do better moving forward. While often delivered with the best of intentions, the sentiment can feel hollow. Many times, investors aren\u2019t clear on the rules of the game they\u2019re playing, and the people they\u2019re playing against \u2014 or the people who are running the game \u2014 aren\u2019t forthcoming about what\u2019s going on in the background. Placing the blame on the losers, especially when they\u2019re set up to lose, happens time and time again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the double whammy of not only is your money stolen, but as far as anyone knows, it\u2019s your fault, you should have known better,\u201d Baradaran said. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking how similar those arguments end up.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the system\u2019s broken, let\u2019s fix it\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no denying the American financial system is in many ways stacked against Black investors and consumers. And the best way to address that might be to try to fix the system instead of creating new avenues or endeavors, whether the Freedman\u2019s Bank or some crypto project, which have many of the same failings but without the guardrails.\n\n\u201cIf the system\u2019s broken, let\u2019s fix it, instead of saying, \u2018Look, the system\u2019s broken, let\u2019s create this other system,\u2019\u201d Baradaran said, comparing it to deciding to go live on Mars because Earth is too screwed up. \u201cIt\u2019s losing all the lessons that we had to learn the hard way in this financial system, which is that you need trust, you have to have trust. And if we allow fraud without regulation, there will always be fraud.\u201d\n\nFraud and mistrust are what have led many Black consumers to faulty offers and products over and over again. The latest iteration is crypto, but it probably won\u2019t be the last."

        "content": "SAN ANTONIO \u2013 When kindergarten teacher Beth Hutchinson met \u201cRobert\u201d on the Bumble dating app, he seemed like a potential match.\n\n\u201cHe was saying that he was adopted, grew up in Switzerland, moved to the U.S. about three or four years ago,\u201d she recalled.\n\nHe suggested they move their conversations off the platform and to the private messaging app, WhatsApp.\n\nAfter a couple of weeks of messaging, including heart emojis, she said he offered to teach her about trading and investing.\n\n\u201cHe showed me how to take money from my account, turn it into Bitcoin and then be able to start using it to trade and whatnot on the New York Stock Exchange,\u201d Hutchinson said.\n\nShe started with $1,000. Within a few weeks, she\u2019d turned $6,500 into cryptocurrency and invested it on a website \u201cRobert\u201d said was the New York Stock Exchange. It looked promising.\n\n\u201cEvery time I did it, I was always gaining money up to a point where it was a couple hundred at a time,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought I was putting my money in the New York Stock Exchange.\u201d\n\nBut when \u201cRobert\u201d became aggressive and threatening, she felt something was wrong and called the real New York Stock Exchange.\n\n\u201cI gave them the web address, and they said, \u2018That\u2019s not one of ours,\u2019\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cMy heart just dropped into my stomach.\u201d\n\nThe website was bogus, but the money she\u2019d invested was real. It was also gone.\n\nIt\u2019s hardly the first time an online flirt turned out to be a fake. Last year, crypto romance scammers duped people out of some $139 million dollars, according to the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nIt\u2019s a highly lucrative scam they preys on emotions and human nature.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a genuine fear of missing out of missing out on the next best investing opportunity,\u201d said Jason Meza with the Better Business Bureau.\n\nWarning signs that Romeo or Juliet may be a scammer include moving the conversation off the original platform and to a private messaging app that\u2019s encrypted.\n\nOther red flags are turning the conversation to money and never being able to actually meet in person.\n\nHutchinson said the fact that he never actually asked for her accounts probably gave her a false sense of security. \u201cRobert\u201d also said he lived in Chicago, and when he called to video chat, it was always while she was at work and couldn\u2019t answer.\n\nShe knows she\u2019s highly unlikely to get recover her money. She has filed reports with the FBI and BBB. Now, she wants to warn others about sweet talkers who are out to steal hearts and money.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s like, \u2018Well, I\u2019d be smarter than that,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWell most people view me as a pretty intelligent person, but it still happened to me, too.\u201d\n\nAlso on KSAT.com:"

        "title": "Four Reasons Why Bitcoin (BTC) is Driving Higher - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Bitcoin's (BTC) price movement is on fire, and it is now testing a significant level of resistance that may open the floodgates for bulls and propel the BTC price far higher. Some traders may be perplexed, and are attempting to determine the true cause of the recent surge and if it will endure. Bitcoin's price has increased by more than 50 percent so far this year, and it has hit a price level of 24,900, a level not seen in almost six months. The crypto market lost around $1.4 trillion last year due to the industry's extreme instability.\n\nWe'll go over four different reasons behind Bitcoin's recent rise, and whether this surge is sustainable.\n\nReason number one\n\nWhenever Bitcoin's price shoots up, there is almost always a high sense of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) among traders and investors. Investors are aware that despite all the criticism, major frauds in the cryptocurrency field, and regulatory issues, bitcoin is a beast capable of leaving all these concerns in the dust and rallying like there's no tomorrow.\n\nThe instant bitcoin's price seems to be moving somewhat, it draws attention to itself, causing people to get anxious and believe they cannot afford to miss the chance again. Fear of missing out is one of the primary causes for the present action.\n\nReason number two\n\nA recent regulatory crackdown by U.S. regulators on the Kraken and Paxos exchanges had traders on edge from a fundamental perspective. The New York State Department of Financial Services instructed Paxos to cease the minting of BUSD, Binance's stablecoin. Stablecoins are generally understood to be a kind of cryptocurrency that is partly backed by real assets and partially backed by cash, bonds, or other comparable assets. The risk is that BUSD might be classed as a security by the SEC, and if that occurs, Paxos and Binance could face much larger problems.\n\nThe SEC earlier had sent a strong message to the industry when it penalized Kraken for their staking operation. The whole exchange-operated crypto staking industry is still at risk, since Coinbase's CEO has expressed similar worries. Investors must bear these risks in mind.\n\nNotwithstanding these regulatory requirements, the SEC continues to assert that Bitcoin is a commodity and not a security. Because of the imminent danger of being branded as a security, more investors feel comfortable placing their money in Bitcoin since it has already passed the SEC's labelling test, which was the greatest threat to Bitcoin's survival except its widespread adoption.\n\nReason number three\n\nIn terms of technical price movement, the BTC price continues to retain a strong correlation with equities, particularly the Nasdaq index. The index has increased by more than 16% so far this year as investors continue to purchase bargains after the technology sector saw a big sell-off in 2022. Bitcoin has outperformed the Nasdaq by more than three times year to date.\n\nAs a result of the improbable occurrence of a severe recession in the U.S. economy, the stock markets are expected to see more upward movement. If the risk rally gains further momentum and the connection holds, a robust bull trend might emerge.\n\nReason number four\n\nThe BTC price has been consolidating for an extended period of time, and only yesterday, with its new six-month high, did it break out of this consolidation zone. Now, all eyes will be on the next significant resistance level, which is the $30,000 mark. A breach of this resistance will allow the price to attack its next significant price level, which will be the psychologically significant 50K price level.\n\nAll four elements are contributing to the recent surge in the price of BTC.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Bitcoin broke through the US$24,000 price ceiling for the first time in two weeks to reach its highest price since mid-August in Thursday morning trading in Asia, as investors liquidated almost US$70 million of mostly short-position bets, according to data aggregator GlassNode. The short positions, or bets the price of Bitcoin would fall, had grown following a series of U.S. regulatory crackdowns this month on crypto services. Ether rose with the rest of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, with Solana leading the gains.\n\nSee related article: Sam Bankman-Fried banned from using VPNs while on bail: Bloomberg\n\nFast facts\n\nBitcoin rose 9.4% in the last 24 hours to trade at US$24,318 as of 8 a.m. in Hong Kong, bringing its gains over the past seven days to 6%, according to CoinMarketCap data. Ethereum rose 7.5% to US$1,674, a total gain of 1.4% for the week.\n\nSolana jumped 9.4% to US$23.88, up 2.9% for the past seven days. Cardano added 8.3% to US$0.41, a weekly gain of 6.1% following the successful deployment of the network\u2019s Valentine upgrade yesterday. The upgrade aims to make it easier for developers to build cross-chain applications on the Cardano blockchain.\n\nBNB rose 7.1% to US$317.39. The token is still down 3.2% after the New York Department of Financial Services told Paxos Trust Co. to stop issuing the U.S. dollar-pegged Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin. BUSD is issued through a collaboration with Paxos and BNB\u2019s issuer Binance Global Inc., which runs the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization in the 24 hours rose 6.9% to US$1.10 trillion, the highest since mid-August, with total trading volume up 7.9% to US$63.61 billion.\n\nU.S. equities rose on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1%, the S&P 500 Index added 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite Index finished the day up 0.9%.\n\nWednesday\u2019s gains follow the release the day before of January\u2019s Consumer Price Index that showed prices rose 0.5% for the month and 6.4% year-on-year. While these figures were slightly higher than the expected monthly increase of 0.4% and annual 6.2%, they do show that inflation has followed a downward trajectory for the past several months in the world\u2019s largest economy.\n\nThe year-on-year CPI in December came in at 6.5% from the 7.1% recorded in November, which in turn declined from October\u2019s 7.7% and 8.2% in September.\n\nThe Fed, which has said it wants inflation back in the 2% range, has raised interest rates multiple times since last March to reverse the inflation surge.\n\nAnalysts at the CME Group predict a more than 90% chance that the Fed will raise rates by a further 25 basis points at its meeting next month. U.S. interest rates are currently at 4.5% to 4.75%, the highest in 15 years, and Fed officials have repeatedly indicated they could raise rates to as high as 5% to get inflation back to the central bank\u2019s target range.\n\nSee related article: Be careful what you wish for?

        "title": "Bitcoin's Correlation To Risk Assets - Nasdaq",
        "content": "While many bitcoin investors look for the asset to behave as a safe haven, bitcoin typically has ultimately acted as the riskiest of all risk allocations.\n\nThe below is an excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine PRO, Bitcoin Magazine's premium markets newsletter. To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now.\n\nShort-Term Price Versus Long-Term Thesis\n\nHow bitcoin, the asset, will behave in the future versus how it currently trades in the market have proven to be drastically different from our long-term thesis. In this piece, we\u2019re taking a deeper look into those risk-on correlations, and comparing the returns and correlations across bitcoin and other asset classes.\n\nConsistently, tracking and analyzing these correlations can give us a better understanding if and when bitcoin has a real decoupling moment from its current trend. We don\u2019t believe we are in that period today, but expect that decoupling to be more likely over the next five years.\n\nMacro Drives Correlations\n\nFor starters, we\u2019re looking at the correlations of one-day returns for bitcoin and many other assets. Ultimately we want to know how bitcoin moves relative to other major asset classes. There\u2019s a lot of narratives on what bitcoin is and what it could be, but that\u2019s different from how the market trades it.\n\nCorrelations range from negative one to one and indicate how strong of a relationship there is between two variables, or asset returns in our case. Typically, a strong correlation is above 0.75 and a moderate correlation is above 0.5. Higher correlations show that assets are moving in the same direction with the opposite being true for negative or inverse correlations. Correlations of 0 indicate a neutral position or no real relationship. Looking at longer windows of time gives a better indication on the strength of a relationship because this removes short-term, volatile changes.\n\nWhat\u2019s been the most watched correlation with bitcoin over the last two years is its correlation with \u201crisk-on\u201d assets. Comparing bitcoin to traditional asset classes and indexes over the last year or 252 trading days, bitcoin is most correlated with many benchmarks of risk: S&P 500 Index, Russel 2000 (small cap stocks), QQQ ETF, HYG High Yield Corporate Bond ETF and the FANG Index (high-growth tech). In fact, many of these indexes have a strong correlation to each other and goes to show just how strongly correlated all assets are in this current macroeconomic regime.\n\nThe table below compare bitcoin to some key asset-class benchmarks across high beta, equities, oil and bonds.\n\nNote, you can find any of these indexes/assets on Google Finance with the tickers above. For 60/40, we\u2019re using BIGPX Blackrock 60/40 Target Allocation Fund, GSG is the S&P GSCI Commodity ETF, and BSV is the Vanguard Short-Term Bond Index Fund ETF.\n\nAnother important note is that spot bitcoin trades in a 24/7 market while these other assets and indexes do not. Correlations are likely understated here as bitcoin has proven to lead broader risk-on or liquidity market moves in the past because bitcoin can be traded at any time. As bitcoin\u2019s CME futures market has grown, using this futures data produces a less volatile view of correlation changes over time as it trades within the same time limitations as traditional assets.\n\nLooking at the rolling 3-month correlations of bitcoin CME futures versus a few of the risk-on indexes mentioned above, they all track nearly the same.\n\nBitcoin CME futures correlated with risk-on assets.\n\nAlthough bitcoin has had its own, industry-wide capitulation and deleveraging event that rival many historical bottoming events we\u2019ve seen in the past, these relationships to traditional risk haven\u2019t changed much.\n\nBitcoin has ultimately acted as the riskiest of all risk allocations and as a liquidity sponge, performing well at any hints of expanding liquidity coming back into the market. It reverses with the slightest sign of rising equities volatility in this current market regime.\n\nWe do expect this dynamic to substantially change over time as the understanding and adoption of Bitcoin accelerates. This adoption is what we view as the asymmetric upside to how bitcoin trades today versus how it will trade 5-10 years from now. Until then, bitcoin\u2019s risk-on correlations remain the dominant market force in the short-term and are key to understanding its potential trajectory over the next few months.\n\nRead the full article here.\n\nLike this content?

        "content": "Despite the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s recent crackdown on crypto, Bitcoin is up, and up big: From Tuesday to Thursday, the price rose almost 14%, peaking just above $25,000, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nPinpointing exactly why the price of the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency rises and falls isn\u2019t an exact science, but reports of a recent short squeeze\u2014investors who\u2019d bet the price of Bitcoin would decrease sold holdings\u2014is one explanation for Bitcoin\u2019s sudden rally.\n\nAlso driving up Bitcoin\u2019s value are ordinals, according to a report from blockchain data company Glassnode. But what are they, and how are they contributing to Bitcoin\u2019s latest price surge?\n\nOrdinals\u2019 origins\n\nAn ordinal is essentially a non-fungible token, a digital asset most famously used to prove that only one person owns, for example, a $69 million piece of digital art sold in March 2021.\n\nNFTs are most famously used on blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. The computing capabilities of these digital ledgers extend far beyond Bitcoin\u2019s, whose blockchain is primarily designed to record transactions between owners of the digital currency.\n\nHowever, in December, Casey Rodarmor, a Bitcoin engineer, designed a method to allow NFTs to exist on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, as opposed to earlier efforts to add NFTs to Bitcoin\u2019s ledger that were hosted \u201coff-chain,\u201d or not in the same database that records daily transactions. Rodarmor called these \u201cdigital artifacts\u201d ordinals.\n\nCumulative fees spent minting Ordinals approaching $1M and looking exponential.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd17 https://t.co/kD6KnYFd8f pic.twitter.com/BjvotTwnpc \u2014 Ben DiFrancesco (@BenDiFrancesco) February 16, 2023\n\nHow do ordinals work?\n\nFirst, Rodarmor invented an algorithm to create a serial number for each and every satoshi, the name for the smallest subdivision of a Bitcoin (there are 100 million satoshis per Bitcoin), based on when the satoshi was first generated.\n\nThen, he created a method for \u201cinscribing\u201d data on a satoshi, exploiting recent updates to Bitcoin\u2019s code in 2017 and 2021, which expanded the capacity for the blockchain to store data beyond transaction records.\n\n\u201cImagine the one-cent piece you have in your pocket, and I can put a piece of data on it,\u201d Daniel Peter, cofounder and CEO of CapsuleNFT, a blockchain infrastructure company that recently announced its work with ordinals, told Fortune. \u201cInstead of that being a cent, now I\u2019ve attached a picture of Benjamin Franklin to that cent.\u201d\n\nLike NFTs on other blockchains, ordinals are \u201cnon-fungible.\u201d In other words, there is a unique record on Bitcoin\u2019s ledger that says that the slight sliver of Bitcoin with, say, Benjamin Franklin\u2019s image on it belongs to one owner and one owner only.\n\nBut, as opposed to the NFTs on blockchains like Ethereum and Solana, the data piggybacking on top of a satoshi is not a link to where the actual file resides (often on decentralized file storage systems). The data is stored, or \u201cinscribed,\u201d on the ordinal itself.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Ethereum and Solana also allow users to store large data files on an NFT; however, pushing this data \u201con chain,\u201d or having it reside on the blockchain itself, is more computationally intensive and therefore expensive, Jon Wong, technical lead on the NFT team at the Solana Foundation, told Fortune.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s decidedly an anti-scale model,\u201d Austin Federa, head of strategy and communications at the Solana Foundation, said of ordinals. He added: \u201cHere\u2019s a version of something that sort of, if you squint, resembles fine art, in terms of its ability to create value through scarcity.\u201d However, he noted, its uses are otherwise limited.\n\nStaying power?\n\nSince ordinals became hot in early February, the number of \u201cmints,\u201d or creations, of Bitcoin NFTs have soared, according to data from Dune Analytics. The majority of data \u201cinscribed\u201d or stored on ordinals are images, including reprints of Bored Apes illustrations and a space turtle GIF. But people have also attached other media, including a clip of amateur Spanish rap. Almost 130,000 ordinals have been minted so far, per Dune.\n\nAs ordinal mints have increased, the minters have been willing to pay the miners, the computers that run and secure Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, more and more in transaction fees. The increased frenzy is one of the reasons behind Bitcoin\u2019s recent price increase, says Wong of the Solana Foundation.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether ordinals, which are only about two months old, have staying power. But, in the meantime, Bitcoiners are cheering on the rally."

        "title": "What Is Bitcoin Mining? - Ledger",
        "content": "What Is Bitcoin Mining?\n\nBy Lipsa Das\n\nRead 6 min Medium\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS \u2014 Bitcoin mining is how Bitcoin\u2019s proof of work consensus mechanism confirms and validates transactions through network participants such as miners and nodes.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Miner nodes compete against each other to solve mathematical problems, and the winner of this competition validates the new block and receives block rewards.\n\n\n\n\u2014 You need specialized mining hardware for Bitcoin mining. Beginners can use mining pools (group mining) or cloud mining (renting hardware) to reduce upfront investment.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Mining?\n\nBitcoin mining is the process of adding new transaction blocks to the Bitcoin ledger by miner nodes that solve complex hashing problems and claim newly minted Bitcoins as mining rewards.\n\nHow does Bitcoin Mining work?\n\nBitcoin mining is a central concept of Bitcoin\u2019s proof of work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which helps \u201cmine\u201d new bitcoins to the system while validating transactions.\n\nAs its name suggests, PoW literally translates to proof of \u201cwork being done\u201d. In this case, that translates to powerful computers crunching the numbers required through sheer computational brute force to validate transactions and produce new bitcoins.\n\nCore to the PoW consensus protocol are two main network participants: miners and nodes. A node is a network computer that provides the first layer of checks to determine whether a transaction is valid. Valid transactions are then added to a memory pool or, in other words, a queue of transactions that don\u2019t have any blocks assigned to them. That\u2019s where miners come in.\n\nMiners compete against each other to find a secret phrase, called \u201cnonce\u201d, which, when combined with the transaction data, grants them the right to validate blocks. The winning miner determines which transactions need to be prioritized for the next block, put them together in a block and add it to the blockchain.\n\nMiners can also function as a node, because they have a copy of all transactions. However, nodes cannot operate as miners.\n\nSince miners need to have a copy of all transactions to do this, they can, by default, operate as a node, but vice versa is not necessary.\n\nWhich Miner Gets To Decide the Next Block?\n\nAs of writing, Bitcoin has over 14,000 miner nodes who compete with each other for the right to add to blocks to the chain, therefore earning the block reward.\n\nThis competition is where things get interesting.\n\nThink of the proof-of-work problems as the combination of a complex safe. You know some of the access codes for the safe, but you have to guess the rest of the digits. And you\u2019ve to do it faster than other people.\n\nIn bitcoin terms, the miner\u2019s computing equipment competes with other miners on the network to guess the nonce. Since there are billions of permutations, it\u2019s a matter of trial and error until a miner guesses the correct one.\n\nThe nonce combines the transaction information in the block to produce an encrypted series of alphanumeric characters, or the \u201chash\u201d. The miner that provides this hash to the Bitcoin network can add the new block to the network. They get rewarded a fixed amount of Bitcoins generated by the system (the block reward).\n\nHow To Be the Miner That Decides the Next Block?\n\nThe quality of your mining hardware makes a huge difference to your effectiveness as a miner. The better the hashrate (computing speed) of your hardware, the more guesses it can compute per second and eliminate incorrect answers quickly.\n\nTherefore, miners who invest in advanced hardware or pool their resources together have a higher chance of guessing the correct nonce faster.\n\nStatistically, though, the probability of the same miner getting it right every time is pretty low, which is good for the network. The more miners the network has, the more decentralized and secure the Bitcoin blockchain is.\n\nWhy Does Bitcoin Need Miners?\n\nBitcoin miners ensure the safety of the network by addressing a problem unique to crypto \u2014 double-spending. Double spending refers to trying to use the same currency more than once.\n\nIn a traditional financial system, this isn\u2019t possible. In the cash economy, you can\u2019t spend the same $100 bill at two places: Simply, once you spend it, since you don\u2019t possess it any longer. With digital transactions too, banks can easily track the flow of funds, since they have a centralized database. In other words, you will never be able to spend the same money twice.\n\nHowever, since Bitcoin is a digital currency with no central authority verifying transactions, the process for tracking your spending (and maintaining accurate records) is distributed across the network.\n\nMiners act as decentralized \u201cbankers\u201d of the Bitcoin network and play a key role in preventing double-spending of Bitcoin.\n\nWhen unconfirmed transactions are pulled out of the memory pool for validation, the transaction with the most confirmations gets added to the block. Accordingly, any other transactions will fail. Typically, if a block gets over six node confirmations, it is valid.\n\nMeanwhile, individual miners themselves are incentivized to confirm transactions accurately and, honestly, the block reward is only valuable as long as the Bitcoin network remains accurate and trustworthy.\n\nWhy Mine Bitcoin?\n\n1. Financial Incentive\n\nAs of 2020, for each block a miner solves, they receive 6.25 Bitcoins as mining rewards. So while mining is not as profitable as it used to be a decade ago, Bitcoin mining is still lucrative.\n\nBitcoin mining profitability, though, depends on various other factors \u2014 electricity bills, the price of Bitcoin, mining competition, etc.\n\n2. Autonomy\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are about autonomy \u2013 they allow you to be your own bank, storing value and transacting independently of a central authority.\n\nMining takes this to the next level. As a miner, you maintain a copy of Bitcoin\u2019s entire transaction history on your computer, so you become your own source of truth.\n\nFurther, mining bitcoin also grants you \u201cvoting power\u201d proportional to the hash rate you commit to the network. Therefore, you can influence fundamental network changes such as forks to the Bitcoin network.\n\n3. Maintaining the Bitcoin Network\n\nBecoming a Bitcoin miner means the satisfaction of knowing you\u2019re preventing manipulation of the Bitcoin network. For those who are enthusiastic about a decentralized monetary system, contributing to its function has a lot of appeal.\n\nHow To Start Mining Bitcoin?\n\nTechnically, anyone can start mining Bitcoin. However, over the years of Bitcoin evolution, the sophistication of bitcoin mining has significantly increased \u2014 going from GPUs (the ones you find in gaming laptops) to mining rigs.\n\nIt\u2019s still possible to mine with a GPU, but you\u2019ll likely earn in pennies even if your hardware runs for months straight. And that is if you\u2019re able to join a mining pool that accepts a low hash rate.\n\nIf you\u2019re going the independent miner route, you\u2019ll need specialized mining hardware, preferably ASICs (application-specific integrated circuit). ASICs are specialized hardware components with fast processing power, ranging from $500 to thousands of dollars.\n\nYou\u2019ll also need to handle technical details yourself \u2014 for instance, deciding whether to purchase a secondhand machine, configuring the software that will run your miner, etc.\n\nThis process can quickly become complicated. Two of the simplest ways for beginners to start mining Bitcoin are; mining pools and cloud mining.\n\nWhat Are Mining Pools?\n\nMining pools are groups of cryptocurrency miners who pool their computational resources to solve the proof of work problems and share the rewards of the mined bitcoin. This tackles two problems.\n\nIndependent miners can be up against entire mining farms, which makes your chances of success relatively low as an individual. So pooling your resources with a mining group gives the whole group a better chance of collecting the block reward.\n\nFurther, investing in mining hardware is expensive and has a sunk cost due to hardware deterioration at high temperatures. Mining pools allow you to hack your way into mining success by utilizing the power of the group to solve problems faster.\n\nWith mining pools, miners have a higher probability of securing the prize with lower costs. Of course, in doing so, they have to sacrifice some of the autonomy with respect to mining strategies and a portion of the rewards. But hey \u2014 it\u2019s better than being empty-handed, right?\n\nMining pools come in three types:\n\n1. Proportional Mining Pools\n\nIn proportional mining pools, each miner receives a share proportional to their hardware\u2019s computing power to the entire pool. Once a block is found, the miner receives their payout.\n\n2. Pay-per-share Mining Pools\n\nIn pay-per-share mining pools, each miner receives an instant payout based on the hardware power they have committed to the pool. Here, the pool owner takes on the risk of providing a steady stream of income to miners, even if they do not find a block.\n\n3. Peer-to-peer Mining Pools\n\nPeer-to-peer mining pools take a decentralized approach to mining, where pool decisions are made on the blockchain.\n\nWhat Is Cloud Mining?\n\nCloud Mining extends the concept of cloud computing by allowing users to rent computing power from companies that mine Bitcoin on their behalf.\n\nIt\u2019s similar to how cloud services like Google Drive store and share your files instead of running your own storage server. In cloud mining, you pay the company a fee, they allocate hash power proportional to that fee, and you\u2019re free to use that power to mine your Bitcoins.\n\nThe direct benefit of cloud mining is that you don\u2019t have to worry about buying or maintaining hardware and dealing with storage, electricity, or cooling costs. You also need little to no technical know-how while using cloud computing.\n\nCloud mining is also highly flexible. Depending on the market conditions and your mining strategies, you can scale up or down with a few clicks. Further, since most of these cloud mining companies run large-scale mining operations in inexpensive countries, you typically have access to state-of-the-art equipment at a fraction of the cost.\n\nHowever, involving a third party in mining operations always comes with a risk. It\u2019s important to choose a reliable and transparent cloud mining supplier \u2014 since you don\u2019t own any hardware and are entirely dependent on the mining company.\n\nBitcoin Mining Vs Energy Consumption\n\nThe proof-of-work consensus mechanism uses energy as the key resource for securing itself.\n\nAll miners use energy as they compete to solve the hash puzzle, but only one miner gets to add each new block; thus, energy expenditure by other miners serves purely to prevent a bad actor from manipulating the validation process, which in turn preserves the value of Bitcoin.\n\nAs a result, Bitcoin energy consumption is one of the core debates in the crypto space. But to fully grasp the \u201ccost/benefit analysis\u201d of Proof of Work, the facts must also be considered in context.\n\nYes, Bitcoin does consume significant energy; but doing so guarantees the security of the system and, therefore the value of the currency as a whole. This is what allows it to pose an alternative to centralized banking, something that brings enormous possibilities in itself.\n\nEnergy consumption remains a hotly-debated issue. However, as long as Bitcoin continues to function effectively and securely as a decentralized ledger, there\u2019s a valid argument to be made in favor of Proof of Work.\n\nReady to Start Mining Bitcoin?\n\nMining bitcoin is a lucrative option for many people, but it takes some planning to make it a success.\n\nFor instance, you should do a cost-benefit analysis of mining Bitcoin relative to its price. Take into account the full stack infrastructure needed to run your mining operations profitably\u2014 mining hardware, energy costs, book-keeping, tax implications, accounting, etc.\n\nIf you\u2019re new to Bitcoin and mining, starting with a lower-end investment like cloud mining or mining pools would make sense. Test the waters before you go all in.\n\nLet\u2019s get mining!\n\nKnowledge is power"

An algorithm would convert LUNA to UST or UST to LUNA to manage supply and keep the peg intact.\n\n\"The Terraform ecosystem was neither decentralized, nor finance,\u201d said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement. \u201cIt was simply a fraud propped up by a so-called algorithmic 'stablecoin'\u2014the price of which was controlled by the defendants, not any code.\u201d\n\nTerraform and Kwon Illegally Sold Securities\n\nThe SEC\u2019s suit reiterated the regulator\u2019s stance that stablecoins are securities and their sale, if not registered with the SEC, violates federal securities laws. It also took aim at Kwon for moving large amounts of bitcoin from the Terra ecosystem into a cold wallet as UST collapsed. Finally, the SEC said Terraform and Kwon misled investors with false promises of high returns.\n\nTerraform and Kwon \u201coffered and sold crypto asset securities in unregistered transactions and perpetrated a fraudulent scheme that led to the loss of at least $40 billion of market value, including devastating losses for U.S. retail and institutional investors,\u201d the SEC said. That includes the sale of crypto securities called \u2018mAssets,\u2019 which were swaps that mirrored the price of stocks of U.S. companies.\n\nTerraform and Kwon Removed 10,000 Bitcoin\n\nTerraform and Kwon removed 10,000 bitcoin from the Terra and Luna ecosystem, according to the SEC, and ultimately moved them to a bank in Switzerland. Since June, about $100 million has been withdrawn, the regulator alleged.\n\nKwon\u2019s whereabouts are unknown, as the SEC noted, and the suit could present a renewed effort to bring the Terraform founder to justice. South Korean authorities are conducting their own investigations.\n\nTerraform Misled Investors with False Promises\n\nThe SEC alleges that the CEO and the company advertised returns as high as 20% for investors who deposited their UST using what Terra and Kwon called the Anchor Protocol.\n\n\"We allege that Terraform and Do Kwon failed to provide the public with full, fair, and truthful disclosure as required for a host of crypto asset securities, most notably for LUNA and Terra USD. We also allege that they committed fraud by repeating false and misleading statements to build trust before causing devastating losses for investors,\" said SEC chair Gary Gensler.\n\nWhat SEC's Focus on Crypto Means for Stablecoins?\n\nThe suit is the latest effort by regulators to scrutinize cryptocurrency. The SEC won a $30 million settlement from crypto exchange Kraken that forced the company to shutter its U.S. staking business last week.\n\nThe SEC also sued Ripple, in a move that could determine whether cryptocurrencies are securities. The regulator is maintaining Gensler\u2019s stance that most cryptocurrencies are securities until that case is decided.\n\nFormer CFTC employee and now Web3 lawyer Mike Selig tweeted that an SEC decision to categorize UST as a stablecoin could set a precedent for anything to be considered a security."

        "title": "Everything you need to know about filing crypto taxes \u2014 especially if your exchange went bankrupt - CNBC",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency is classified as property by the IRS. That means crypto income and capital gains are taxable and crypto losses may be tax deductible. Last year, many cryptocurrencies lost more than half their value and major crypto exchanges \u2014 like FTX \u2014 collapsed. The silver lining is you may be able to reduce your 2022 tax burden if you lost money in crypto. CNBC Select talked with Shehan Chandrasekera, head of tax strategy at CoinTracker, a crypto tax software company, about how cryptocurrency is taxed and what you need to know if your crypto exchange declared bankruptcy.\n\nHow cryptocurrency is taxed\n\nMany of cryptocurrency's most passionate advocates emphasize the decentralization of the blockchain, but it's important to remember that the federal government is keeping tabs on who is earning how much when it comes to crypto and taxes. \"The biggest misconception in this space in general is that people think that crypto is invisible to the regulators. But that's not the case,\" says Chandrasekera. There's a permanent record of all your activity on the blockchain and many crypto exchanges report to the IRS. For the most part, the IRS treats crypto as an asset subject to its rules on capital gains and losses, similar to stocks. When you buy cryptocurrency or stocks, the original purchase price of the asset becomes its cost basis. When you sell that asset, you're taxed based on the difference between the cost basis and the sale price. Capital gains and capital losses are based on the net total of all transactions that year. If you sold five different assets for a total gain of $10,000 and three other assets at a total loss of $15,000, then you have $5,000 in capital losses. You can deduct up to $3,000 a year in capital losses from your taxable income and can carry over losses exceeding that annual limit to future years. For example, if you had $5,000 in capital losses in 2022, you can reduce your taxable income by $3,000 in 2022 and apply the remaining $2,000 in losses to 2023. Capital gains are taxed differently based on how long you hold an asset before selling. Short-term capital gains taxes apply to assets you've held for one year or less and long-term capital gains taxes are assessed when you sell an asset after owning it for more than one year. Your exact capital gains rate depends on several factors, but long-term capital gains are typically taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains. And you may not have to pay any capital gains tax at all, depending on your filing status and taxable income.

However, there are instances where cryptocurrency is taxed as income, in which case it's subject to a marginal tax rate of up to 37% depending on your income level and filing status. Below we examine how each type of crypto transaction is classified for tax purposes: 1. Selling cryptocurrency (capital gains) Anytime you sell cryptocurrency the gain or loss in value has tax implications. This type of transaction tends to be straightforward, especially if you aren't frequently buying and selling crypto, and is classified under capital gains. 2. Exchanging one cryptocurrency for another (capital gains) A crypto swap is when you directly trade one cryptocurrency for another without exchanging your crypto for cash. Chandrasekera points out that many people mistakenly overlook this type of transaction when it comes to taxes because no cash was realized. But if you exchange Bitcoin for Litecoin or Ethereum for Bitcoin, it's a taxable event. 3. Spending crypto for goods or services (capital gains) Using crypto to buy goods or services has the same tax implications as selling it. \"It could be as little as you're going to Starbucks and spending a fraction of a Bitcoin to buy something and that could result in a taxable gain,\" Chandrasekera says. When you're buying anything with crypto, the taxable gain or loss is based on what you paid for the cryptocurrency and its value at the time of the transaction. 4. When you earn cryptocurrency (income) When you earn cryptocurrency it is considered taxable income based on the value of the coins at the time of receipt. This includes crypto earned from activities such as: Mining cryptocurrencies\n\nCrypto staking income\n\nYields on crypto accounts\n\nCrypto earned as regular pay or bonuses 5. Anytime you receive free coins (income) There are instances where you may receive free crypto and the value of the digital coins you receive is considered income. Two common scenarios where you may receive free crypto are airdrops and hard forks. An airdrop is when cryptocurrencies are given away for free and it's typically used as a marketing tool for new cryptocurrencies. A hard fork is a bit more complicated but to simplify it, it's essentially when a cryptocurrency splits into two types of tokens or coins. When this happens, you'll have your original coin and a new coin, with a separate value. The value of the cryptocurrency you receive from a hard fork is taxable income.\n\nWhat to do if your crypto exchange went bankrupt in 2022\n\nLast year, a crash in the crypto markets led to a string of crypto firms declaring bankruptcy \u2014 most notably FTX, which at its peak was valued at $32 billion. If you had crypto assets tied up in a company that's filed for bankruptcy, unfortunately, there isn't anything you can do for the 2022 tax year. \"When those bankruptcies get finalized in 2023, we will have more clarity on the amount of loss, the type of deduction you can get depending on the findings of the bankruptcies,\" Chandrasekera says. The bankruptcies could be the result of fraud or simply bad business decisions and, \"all those things affect the amount of the deduction, the type of the deduction and even when you can take the deduction,\" Chandrasekera says. It's also possible that you may get (some of) your money back, he says.\n\nSubscribe to the Select Newsletter! Our best selections directly into your inbox.

Any time you sell or exchange crypto, it's a taxable event. This includes using crypto used to pay for goods or services. In most cases, the IRS taxes cryptocurrencies as an asset and subjects them to long-term or short-term capital gains taxes. However, sometimes cryptocurrency is treated as income.

        "title": "Bitcoin bulls aim to hold this week's BTC gains leading into Friday's $675M options expiry - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC) gained 6.3% just two days after reaching $21,370 on Feb. 13, which was the lowest level seen in more than three weeks. The price recovery can be partially explained by the Feb. 14 U.S. Consumer Price Index data displaying a 6.4% increase in year-over-year inflation in January.\n\nWhile the U.S. Federal Reserve continues to monitor the overheated economy, the most likely scenario is further interest rate hikes to curb inflation. The unintended consequence is the heightened government debt cost, creating a bullish environment for scarce assets such as commodities, stock market and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe price gain of Bitcoin practically extinguished bears\u2019 expectation for a sub-$21,500 options expiry on Feb. 17, so their bets are unlikely to pay off as the deadline approaches.\n\nBitcoin investors\u2019 primary concern is the possibility of further impacts from regulators following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ordering Kraken to halt its staking rewards program on Feb. 9 and the crackdown on Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin issuing on Feb. 13.\n\nEven if the newsflow remains negative, bulls still can profit from Feb. 17\u2019s options expiry by keeping the BTC price above $22,500, but the situation can easily flip and favor bears.\n\nBears were not expecting the $22,000 level to hold\n\nThe open interest for the Feb. 17 options expiry is $675 million, but the actual figure will be lower since bears were expecting sub-$22,000 price levels. These traders became overconfident after Bitcoin traded below $21,500 on Feb. 13.\n\nBitcoin options aggregate open interest for Feb. 17. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe 1.12 call-to-put ratio reflects the imbalance between the $355 million call (buy) open interest and the $320 million put (sell) options. If Bitcoin\u2019s price remains near $22,700 at 8:00 am UTC on Feb. 17, only $24 million worth of these put (sell) options will be available. This difference happens because the right to sell Bitcoin at $21,000 or $22,000 is useless if BTC trades above that level on expiry.\n\nBulls aim for $23,000 to secure a $155 million profit\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on Feb. 17 for call (bull) and put (bear) instruments varies, depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $21,000 and $22,000: 700 calls vs. 5,500 puts. The net result favors the put (bear) instruments by $100 million.\n\n700 calls vs. 5,500 puts. The net result favors the put (bear) instruments by $100 million. Between $22,000 and $22,500: 1,800 calls vs. 1,500 puts. The net result is balanced between bears and bulls.\n\n1,800 calls vs. 1,500 puts. The net result is balanced between bears and bulls. Between $22,500 and $23,000: 3,800 calls vs. 1,100 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $60 million.\n\n3,800 calls vs. 1,100 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $60 million. Between $23,000 and $24,000: 6,900 calls vs. 200 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $155 million.\n\nThis crude estimate considers the call options used in bullish bets and the put options exclusively in neutral-to-bearish trades. Even so, this oversimplification disregards more complex investment strategies.\n\nFor example, a trader could have sold a call option, effectively gaining negative exposure to Bitcoin above a specific price, but unfortunately, there\u2019s no easy way to estimate this effect.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price eyes $23K despite US dollar strength hitting 6-week high\n\nBears might benefit from the impact of regulation\n\nBitcoin bulls need to push the price above $23,000 on Feb. 17 to secure a potential $155 million profit. On the other hand, the bears\u2019 best-case scenario requires a 3.5% dump below $22,000 to maximize their gains.\n\nConsidering the negative pressure from regulators, bears have good odds of flipping the table and avoiding a loss of $60 million or larger on Feb. 17.\n\nMore importantly, looking at a broader time frame, there is little room for the Fed to slow down the economy without spiraling the debt interest repayments out of control.\n\nFeb. 17 will be an interesting display of strength between the short-term impact of a hostile crypto regulation environment versus Bitcoin\u2019s long-term scarcity and censorship-resistance benefits.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price gained 6.3% just two days after reaching $21,370 on Feb. 13, which was the lowest level seen in more than three weeks. The price recovery can be partially explained by the Feb. 14 U.S. Consumer price index data displaying a 6.4% increase in year-over-year inflation in January.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Texas is host to major Bitcoin mining operations.\n\nEl Salvador legalized Bitcoin for tender in September 2021 and now seems to be taking on the role of nation-state evangelist for the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency, contrasting with regulatory crackdowns on crypto in other countries.\n\nThe Central American country established a \u201cBitcoin office\u201d in Lugano, Switzerland in October 2022 to support \u201cinitiatives to drive the adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies across their respective regions\u201d and foster \u201cthe exchange of students and talents between El Salvador and Lugano,\u201d the countries said at the time.\n\nEl Salvador, a country of just over 6 million people, currently holds 2,381 Bitcoin, the third most of any country after the U.S. and Ukraine, according to BitcoinTreasuries.\n\nEl Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has faced criticism for the Bitcoin plan from the International Monetary Fund and other financial authorities.

        "content": "The total crypto market capitalization rejected at $1.13 trillion on Feb. 16, but there was no change in the month-long ascending channel structure. More importantly, this level represents a 43% gain in 2023, which is far from the $3 trillion level achieved in November 2021. Still, the current recovery is notable.\n\nTotal crypto market cap in U.S. dollars, 1-day. Source: TradingView\n\nAs shown above, the ascending channel initiated in mid-January has left some room for a 10% correction down to $1 trillion without breaking the bullish formation.\n\nInvestors reacted positively to the 5.6% year-on-year U.S. Consumer Price Index inflation increase on Feb. 14 and the 3% retail sales monthly growth on Feb. 15. Bitcoin (BTC) had the biggest positive impact on the total crypto capitalization as its price gained 12.5% on the week.\n\nOne area of concern is a Feb. 16 story on Binance.US financial transactions to Merit Peak, a trading firm managed by CEO Changpeng Zhao. Interestingly, Reuters reported that a Binance.US spokesperson said Merit Peak was \u201cneither trading nor providing any kind of services on the Binance.US platform.\u201d\n\nThe 10.1% weekly increase in total market capitalization was held back by the modest 1.8% gains from BNB (BNB) and the XRP (XRP) 2.5% price increase. On the other hand, only three out of the top 80 cryptocurrencies finished the week with negative performances.\n\nWeekly winners and losers among the top 80 coins. Source: Messari\n\nDecentralized storage solution Filecoin (FIL) gained 59% and Internet Computer (ICP) soared 52% as Bitcoin blockchain demand for nonfungible token (NFT) inscription vastly increased the block space.\n\nGMX rallied 34% as the protocol received $5 million in transaction fees on a single day.\n\nLido DAO\u2019s LDO gained 34% as stakers evaluated proposals to manage the 20,300 Ether (ETH) held by the corporate treasury.\n\nLeverage demand is balanced despite the generalized rally\n\nPerpetual contracts, also known as inverse swaps, have an embedded rate that is usually charged every eight hours. Exchanges use this fee to avoid exchange risk imbalances.\n\nA positive funding rate indicates that longs (buyers) demand more leverage. However, the opposite situation occurs when shorts (sellers) require additional leverage, causing the funding rate to turn negative.\n\nPerpetual futures accumulated 7-day funding rate on Feb. 17. Source: Coinglass\n\nThe seven-day funding rate was close to zero for Bitcoin and Ether, meaning the data points to a balanced demand between leverage longs (buyers) and shorts (sellers).\n\nInterestingly, BNB is no longer a top six cryptocurrency ranked by futures open interest, as investors\u2019 demand for Polygon\u2019s MATIC (MATIC) markets increased by 70% in February.\n\nThe options put/call ratio remains optimistic\n\nTraders can gauge the market\u2019s overall sentiment by measuring whether more activity is going through call (buy) options or put (sell) options. Generally speaking, call options are used for bullish strategies, whereas put options are for bearish ones.\n\nA 0.70 put-to-call ratio indicates that put options open interest lag the more bullish calls by 30% and is therefore bullish. In contrast, a 1.40 indicator favors put options by 40%, which can be deemed bearish.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price derivatives look a bit overheated, but data suggests bears are outnumbered\n\nBTC options volume put-to-call ratio. Source: Laevitas\n\nEven though Bitcoin\u2019s price failed to break the $25,000 resistance, the demand for bullish call options has exceeded the neutral-to-bearish puts since Feb. 14.\n\nPresently, the put-to-call volume ratio nears 0.40 as the options market is more strongly populated by neutral-to-bullish strategies, favoring call (buy) options by 2x.\n\nFrom a derivatives market perspective, there are no signs of demand from short sellers, while leverage indicators show bulls are not using excessive leverage. Ultimately, the odds favor those betting that the $1.13 trillion total market cap resistance will break, opening room for further gains.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "To get a roundup of TechCrunch\u2019s biggest and most important crypto stories delivered to your inbox every Thursday at 12 p.m. PT, subscribe here.\n\nWelcome back to Chain Reaction.\n\nThe past few weeks in crypto land have been focused on the latest craze: Ordinals.\n\nWhat are Ordinals, you might ask? They\u2019re NFT-like Bitcoin digital artifacts that are on the blockchain.\n\nWhile the project isn\u2019t the first to try to bring NFTs onto the Bitcoin blockchain, it\u2019s definitely gaining the most traction today.\n\nAbout 122,500 Ordinals have been inscribed, which is jargon for created (or minted), to date, according to Dune Analytics data. The number of total inscriptions is up 40% from about 88,000 on Tuesday. On February 8, the number of Ordinals inscribed peaked over 21,000, and Wednesday was the second highest day with over 17,7000, the data showed.\n\n\u201cIt has really escaped, it\u2019s gone nuclear,\u201d Casey Rodarmor, the creator of Ordinals, shared with TechCrunch. \u201cThere are people building things that I don\u2019t even hear about until they\u2019ve launched. So it\u2019s really about where people want to take this.\u201d\n\nAlthough things have started off strong, time will tell on whether or not the project will continue to grow and compete with major NFT ecosystems on chains like Ethereum and Solana.\n\nMore below.\n\nThis week in web3\n\nOrdinals creator views his Bitcoin-centric creation as digital artifacts, not just NFTs (TC+)\n\nTechCrunch sat down with the Ordinals creator to discuss the inspiration for the NFT-like Bitcoin project that is expanding rapidly. \u201cI thought I was building something good and I thought I was meeting an unmet market demand that NFT collectors had expressed a desire for,\u201d Rodarmor said. And by the current market\u2019s response, his creation did in fact meet that demand.\n\nCrypto exchange Binance expects to pay penalties to settle US investigations\n\nBinance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, expects to pay monetary penalties to settle probes into its business in the U.S., a top executive said, in a major about-face after publicly disputing the idea that it was under any investigation and mocking media outlets that reported otherwise. In an apparent admission of breaking laws, Binance chief strategy officer Patrick Hillmann told the WSJ that the company\u2019s executives were unfamiliar with laws and rules written surrounding bribery, corruption and money laundering.\n\nBitcoin NFTs are growing quickly as community sees long-term potential (TC+)\n\nFollowing the theme of Ordinals, TechCrunch also spoke to a handful of experts on what Ordinals\u2019 growth means for the Bitcoin ecosystem. Even though Ordinals and Bitcoin NFTs in general are exploding, it\u2019s still in very early stages, especially when compared to behemoths like Ethereum and Solana. \u201cIf Bitcoin wants to stay the most decentralized, widespread and prolific cryptocurrency, it needs something like [Bitcoin NFTs] to push it forward,\u201d Alex Adelman, co-founder and CEO of Bitcoin-rewards platform Lolli, said.\n\nSEC\u2019s proposal could affect which crypto companies can manage assets (TC+)\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission proposed a new rule on Wednesday that may back crypto companies further into a corner as regulators continue to crack down on the space. The SEC voted 4-1 for a proposal that would direct registered investment advisers (RIAs) \u2014 like wealth managers or hedge funds \u2014 to keep customers\u2019 money and securities with qualified custodians like a bank, broker-dealer or trust company when storing digital assets, mainly leaving crypto companies on the outskirts.\n\nWant to buy an NFT with your credit card? Magic Eden lets you do just that (TC+)\n\nOne of the biggest complaints in the crypto world is that using the technology is, you know, kind of difficult. But as the ecosystem evolves, many big players are trying to alleviate the issue through new on-ramps or payment solutions. MoonPay, a web3 infrastructure company, has joined forces with Magic Eden, one of the biggest NFT marketplaces, to help make NFTs more accessible through old-school tricks, the companies announced on Monday.\n\nThe latest pod\n\nWe released a fun bonus episode this week, which dives into TechCrunch\u2019s newest podcast: Inside Startup Battlefield, which is a four-part series that takes you behind the Startup Battlefield competition.\n\nFor last week\u2019s episode, Jacquelyn talked to Gwendolyn Regina, investment director at layer-1 blockchain BNB Chain. Prior to her current role, Gwen worked at Facebook, or as some call it now, Meta, building up a new business unit for venture capital partnerships and startup growth. She\u2019s also a founder of a few different businesses and a founding team member for early-stage tech investment firm Thymos Capital.\n\nBNB Chain was launched in 2020 and initially kicked off by Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange by trading volume. Since then, BNB Chain aims to be a decentralized, community-owned separate entity from Binance with a focus on three audiences: retail markets, builders and developers, and bridging Web 2.0 businesses to web3, Regina shared.\n\nGaming on BNB Chain also has grown \u201corganically through robustness and cheaper fees,\u201d but the blockchain\u2019s team is now \u201cdoubling down\u201d in that sector to encourage more gamers and developers to play and build on its chain, Regina added.\n\nWe also discussed:\n\nThe dApps developers are building on-chain\n\nBNB\u2019s investing strategy\n\nWhat investors look for in founders\n\nAdvice to startups launching in a bear market\n\nSubscribe to Chain Reaction on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or your favorite pod platform to keep up with the latest episodes, and please leave us a review if you like what you hear!\n\nFollow the money\n\nStelo Labs raises $6 million in a16z-led round to help crypto wallet users protect themselves Crypto index platform Alongside raises $11 million led by a16z Monad Labs raises $19 million to grow its smart contract platform and improve the Ethereum space Caldera raises $9 million from two rounds led by Sequoia and Dragonfly Capital Ironblocks raises $7 million to protect decentralized finance and web3 from threats and theft\n\nThis list was compiled with information from Messari as well as TechCrunch\u2019s own reporting."

        "title": "Ordinals creator views his Bitcoin-centric creation as \u2018digital artifacts,\u2019 not just NFTs - TechCrunch",
        "content": "Ordinals, a Bitcoin-based NFT-like project, has expanded significantly over the past two weeks, but its creator, Casey Rodarmor, said he had no idea it would explode.\n\n\u201cI thought I was building something good and I thought I was meeting an unmet market demand that NFT collectors had expressed a desire for,\u201d Rodarmor told TechCrunch.\n\nBy the current market\u2019s response, his creation did in fact meet that demand.\n\nAbout 122,500 Ordinals have been inscribed, which is jargon for created (or minted), to date, according to Dune Analytics data. The number of total inscriptions is up 40% from about 88,000 on Tuesday. On February 8, the number of Ordinals inscribed peaked over 21,000, and Wednesday was the second highest day with over 17,7000, the data showed.\n\nThe Bitcoin community has been somewhat divided on whether NFTs on its blockchain are a good thing. While many see them as a positive, fun way to further grow its ecosystem, some \u201cBitcoin maximalists\u201d oppose them for taking up block space on the network and making transaction fees more expensive, among other things.\n\n\u201cMy theory on why this blew up is that [the community] saw this controversy, but then they saw exactly what they wanted \u2014 on-chain, immutable NFTs that are there forever. Like, fuck yeah, sign me up,\u201d Rodarmor said.\n\nRodarmor\u2019s Genesis inscription, which is the first Ordinal inscription \u2014 or inscription 0 \u2014 was some \u201ctiny pixel art\u201d of a skull that marked the beginning of it all, he said. The image was timestamped on December 14, according to the Ordinals website. It pays homage to the first block to be mined on the Bitcoin blockchain, which is commonly known as the Genesis Block. \u201cIt\u2019s really simple, but I\u2019m proud of it,\u201d he added.\n\nThe second inscription, inscription 1, was made three days later. It an image of the infamous CryptoDickbutts NFT. No, that\u2019s not a typo.\n\nRodarmor is a long-time Bitcoiner and programmer artist. He said he\u2019s made art using code in the past, but it was always a hobby before he created Ordinals. In 2021, when NFTs started gaining interest, he saw the space as something he wanted to dive into, \u201ceven as a hardcore Bitcoiner who saw altcoins as uninteresting,\u201d he joked.\n\nIn early 2022, Rodarmor decided he would figure out a way to create NFTs on top of Bitcoin\u2019s chain. \u201cSo I came up with Ordinals, or Ordinal theory, when I\u2019m being tongue-in-cheek.\u201d\n\nWhile the project isn\u2019t the first to try to bring NFTs onto the Bitcoin blockchain, it\u2019s definitely gaining the most traction today. Counterparty, for instance, was the first platform to inscribe NFTs on Bitcoin\u2019s network with the Rare Pepe collection in 2014. Although Rare Pepe didn\u2019t do much to boost mass demand, one of its NFTs from 2016 sold for $3.6 million at a Sotheby\u2019s auction about a year ago.\n\nOrdinals are a \u201csimple concept\u201d that essentially gives individual satoshis, the smallest denomination of bitcoin (equivalent to 100 millionth of a bitcoin), an identity and allows them to be tracked across transactions. The name derives from ordinal numbers, a common term in mathematics, he said.\n\nAnd what\u2019s the identity? These Bitcoin NFTs \u2014 or digital artifacts (as he prefers to call them) \u2014 live on-chain forever.\n\nRodarmor shared that he got the name inspiration for digital artifacts from ChatGPT when he couldn\u2019t figure out what to call them. \u201cI was sitting there asking ChatGPT what word would you call an NFT, digital collectible, that could also be a trading card or a 15th-century digital equivalent of a Chinese silk fan.\u201d\n\nChatGPT replied with \u201cdigital artifact,\u201d he said. \u201cI was like, fuck yes, that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nWhile inscriptions are technically NFTs, Rodarmor prefers the term digital artifacts \u201cbecause there\u2019s a broader category of NFTs, but inscriptions are a subset of NFTs that don\u2019t do certain things,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s like all inscriptions are digital artifacts and also NFTs, but not all NFTs are digital artifacts.\u201d\n\nWhat makes inscriptions stand out from NFTs? Security, immutability, decentralization and homogeneity, among other subtle characteristics, Rodarmor said.\n\n\u201cOrdinal theory is like a lens that you can view the Bitcoin blockchain through, and when you view it through that lens, these trackable satoshis pop into view like Pok\u00e9mon in the tall grass,\u201d Rodarmor said. \u201cThat was what I needed, because I needed something where content could live as an artist.\n\n\u201cI wanted to make digital artifacts and then the inscriptions came as a way to add content to those trackable sets,\u201d Rodarmor said. \u201cThen that is what inscriptions became; that\u2019s the story.\u201d\n\nBut Rodarmor said the story isn\u2019t fully formed.\n\n\u201cThe short-term goal is to protect users and draw the line in the sand,\u201d Rodarmor said. \u201cI think that it\u2019s very important to protect against scams.\u201d\n\nThe project is currently fully open sourced, so in order for it to continue to scale, there need to be more developers, Rodarmor noted. \u201cI have not taken any outside investment or made any promises, but I\u2019m trying to scale an open source development organization to shepherd the technology and protocol.\u201d\n\nDown the line, there\u2019s a chance that Ordinals could become a for-profit corporation, he said. \u201cI need a corporation to serve as a legal liability shield for the website. So I don\u2019t want anybody to be surprised if there\u2019s going to be a corporation \u2014 and that corporation may grow in scope as appropriate.\u201d\n\nBut for the foreseeable future, scaling Ordinals will be all about improving its technology, education and helping others learn about it. \u201cThat\u2019s really going to drive the growth,\u201d Rodarmor said.\n\nOther community members have spoken out about the importance of infrastructure being built around the project, too. Many inscriptions are being completed manually rather than through a service like an NFT marketplace. Although some services have popped up in response to the sudden demand, the infrastructure is still extremely nascent and not bulletproof.\n\nAccessibility is the \u201cnorth star for all of this right now,\u201d Nick Hansen, CEO and co-founder of Luxor, previously told TechCrunch. Over time, there will be more users and more products focused on expanding the Bitcoin NFT \u2014 or digital artifact \u2014 ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIt has really escaped; it\u2019s gone nuclear,\u201d Rodarmor said. \u201cThere are people building things that I don\u2019t even hear about until they\u2019ve launched. So it\u2019s really about where people want to take this.\u201d\n\nRodarmor said he sees it as a \u201ccredibly neutral social layer\u201d for the world. \u201cYou can put data on there, and it might not be to some people\u2019s taste, but it\u2019s pretty hard to censor it. People can use it as a sort of distributed publishing platform in addition to this with content you can own.\u201d\n\nWhile Rodarmor shared that he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s in store for the long run, he believes that it will continue to grow as a \u201cvery powerful concept.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the sky\u2019s the limit,\u201d he added. \u201cCome use bitcoin. The water is warm.\u201d"

        "content": "The average Bitcoin block size has reached record highs after Bitcoin NFT Ordinals protocol launched.\n\nBecause to the introduction of the nonfungible tokens (NFTs) protocol Ordinals in January 2023, the average size of a Bitcoin block has surpassed 2.5 megabytes (MB) for the first time since the cryptocurrency's foundation in 2009. This marks a new all-time high for the cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to statistics obtained from Blockchain.com, the size of Bitcoin blocks increased by more than 2 MB in the weeks after the debut of the Ordinals Protocol. This surge in block size can be traced back to the beginning of February 2023.\n\nSoftware developer Casey Rodarmor introduced the Ordinals protocol in the month of January. This protocol makes it possible for users of the Bitcoin network to create \"digital artifacts.\" These may include JPEG photographs, PDF documents, as well as audio and video files.\n\nIn the documentation for Ordinals, Rodarmor explains that each of these digital objects may be inscribed to a single satoshi, which is one of the component parts of a Bitcoin. The value of one bitcoin is equal to 100,000,000 satoshis.\n\nIndividual satoshis have the ability to be imprinted with any kind of data, allowing for the creation of one-of-a-kind digital artifacts that are original to Bitcoin. These artifacts may be stored in bitcoin wallets and moved via bitcoin transactions. The permanence, immutability, security, and decentralization of inscriptions are on par with those of Bitcoin itself.\n\nThe Bitcoin community is split on the issue of whether or not it should be possible to engrave digital items into the blockchain , and the reasons both for and against the proposal provide plenty of material for reflection. The greater use of block space for the inscription of several Ordinals has emerged as one of the primary topics of discussion.\n\nSince July 2021 and continuing until February 2023, the typical size of a Bitcoin block has ranged between 0.7 and 1.5 megabytes. The average size of a Bitcoin block topped 2 megabytes for the first time on February 5, and it is now hovering at around 2.2 megabytes at the time of this writing.\n\nAccording to statistics obtained by Glassnode, the introduction of Bitcoin Ordinals has also resulted in the network reaching a new high of 44 million non-zero addresses.\n\nThe most recent issue of Glassnode's newsletter mentions that Ordinals compete for block space demand despite the fact that they have not yet materially influenced network pricing.\n\nThe introduction of Ordinals was referred to as a \"new and unique point in the history of Bitcoin\" by Glassnode. This is because innovation may promote network activity even without the \"classical transfer of currency volume for monetary objectives.\""

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin today broke above $25,000 for the first time since June last year.\n\nIt has since dropped slightly: right now, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap is trading hands for $24,914, according to CoinGecko data. That\u2019s a 9.2% 24-hour jump.\n\nThe asset took the rest of the market with it\u2014seemingly unfazed by a U.S. regulatory crackdown. The total market capitalization for all crypto assets has jumped by roughly $100 billion over the last day.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum, the second largest digital asset, is up 8.4% in the past day, priced in at $1,717. Dogecoin, the 10th biggest, jumped 4.6% and is now valued at $0.09.\n\nBut why is this happening? It\u2019s hard to say but experts who spoke with Decrypt said the regulatory crackdown might actually be playing a part.\n\nLast week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission hit American crypto exchange Kraken with a $30 million fine, and reports emerged this week that the regulator was also preparing to sue stablecoin provider Paxos.\n\nMeanwhile, the world\u2019s biggest digital asset exchange Binance said yesterday it would likely pay fines to settle SEC investigations.\n\nWhite Lion Capital CIO John Nance told Decrypt that although it was hard to be certain, with \u201ccrypto getting attacked from all angles,\u201d investors may be selling alt-coins and increasing Bitcoin holdings because it is \u201cbecoming more clear that the safest place in crypto is pure BTC.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill added that Hong Kong\u2019s plans to become an Asian crypto hub might be contributing to the price rise as Asian investors plug money into the space.\n\nBitcoin is still well below its November 2021 all-time high of $69,044\u201463% lower. The cryptocurrency has typically been correlated with the U.S. stock market as investors have lumped it into the \u201crisk-on\u201d asset class.\n\nAs the U.S. Federal Reserve has continually raised interest rates to get sky-high inflation under control, the cryptocurrency market\u2014and tech stocks\u2014have experienced a brutal sell-off. Sentiment on this front may be beginning to shift, however, as the Fed eases off from its aggressive posture."

        "content": "El Salvador is one of the most extreme examples of how the world\u2019s riskiest government bonds have recovered after being over-sold last year\n\nBloomberg \u2014 For most of the four years since taking office, El Salvador\u2019s President Nayib Bukele has relished his role as an anti-establishment warrior.\n\nHe sacked judges, exited a regional anti-corruption pact, spurned the International Monetary Fund and adopted Bitcoin as legal tender. All the while, he seemed wholly indifferent to what foreign investors thought of him.\n\nIt turns out, the brash, ball-cap-backwards 41-year-old president is a hit with Wall Street.\n\nSalvadoran debt is the best performer in emerging markets this year after Lebanon. Even after a pullback this week, the notes have returned 19%, compared to a 2.3% average for other developing nations, according to a Bloomberg sovereign bond index.\n\nPUBLICIDAD\n\nVIEW + Nayib Bukele Says El Salvador Paid Full $800 Million of Maturing Foreign Bond El Salvador\u2019s foreign bonds rallied an average of 24% this month as the maturity date approached, according to data compiled by Bloomberg\n\nEl Salvador is one of the most extreme examples of how the world\u2019s riskiest government bonds have recovered after being over-sold last year by money managers who expected a wave of defaults. But it\u2019s also a sign of how investors have warmed to Bukele. Instead of concerns about him running the economy into the ground, they are gushing about his embrace of fiscal prudence and largely looking beyond his autocratic tendencies.\n\nRally in El Salvador's Dollar Bonds | Investors are warming to the country's debt after Bukele paid back a bond in Jan.\n\nThe change in tone started when El Salvador repaid $800 million of bonds that matured last month and repurchased US$452 million of debt due in 2025, making good on repeated promises that the nation would meet its obligations. While there\u2019s still some skepticism on where Bukele will take the country of 6 million, for now, he\u2019s no longer the risk he once was.\n\n\u201cWe went from skepticism, from looking at the numbers and hearing his announcement of paying down the bond, to basically being surprised in a good way by his very strong willingness to pay,\u201d said Federico Kaune, head of emerging-markets fixed income at UBS Asset Management in New York.\n\nPUBLICIDAD\n\nFor the last seven months bonds have been reversing a drop that began when El Salvador adopted Bitcoin alongside the US dollar as its currencies. Bukele has continued to ride the cyrptocurrency, even as its value plummeted more than 40% over the past year. This week, his government said it would open its second \u201cBitcoin embassy,\u201d this one in Texas.\n\nVIEW + True or False: Is Crypto Collapse a Real Risk for El Salvador\u2019s Economy? As cryptocurrencies are falling triggered by interest rates, Bloomberg L\u00ednea explains what is true and what is unclear about how it affects El Salvador\n\nBukele managed to spark a bond rally in July when he announced the buyback even as Bitcoin plunged. The remainder of the notes maturing in 2025 have surged to 74 cents on the dollar after trading as low as 28 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cWe love his willingness to pay back,\u201d said Christine Reed, Latin America regional specialist at asset management firm Ninety One in New York.\n\nThere are plenty of potential pitfalls ahead. Reed says El Salvador is unlikely to be able to generate enough reserves to carry out more buy backs in the future, while Kaune calls it a risky investment, troubled by a high debt load and questions over its fiscal outlook.\n\nPUBLICIDAD\n\nAnother source of concern is Bukele\u2019s hard-line approach to crime. Organizations including Human Rights Watch and the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights have criticized his policies as authoritarian and dehumanizing. He has also tangled with the US, which has sanctioned some former government officials and condemned a decision to remove the attorney general and five top judges.\n\nVIEW + El Salvador\u2019s Bukele to Seek Reelection in 2024 Despite Second-Term Prohibition The country\u2019s Constitution prohibits a second term, but the current president could stand in 2024 by taking advantage of a loophole in the law and resigning six months before the elections\n\nThe government did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment. On Twitter, Bukele has taken note of how he defied widespread expectations that El Salvador wouldn\u2019t pay the bonds, saying international news outlets had written hundreds of articles predicting the nation would default in January.\n\nFor now, investors have largely shrugged off concerns about Bukele\u2019s policies \u2014 his hard-handed approach to crime has actually helped the economic outlook. Gross domestic product grew at a robust pace in 2022 due to the \u201cunprecedented reduction in crime, and strong remittances and tourism revenues,\u201d according to a statement by the IMF after an official staff visit Feb. 8.\n\nPUBLICIDAD\n\nThe fiscal deficit is narrowing as well, closing last year at 4.6% of GDP, down from from 5.6% in 2021, according to Fitch Ratings data.\n\n\u201cYou can see that they\u2019ve already tightened the belt with the fiscal spending,\u201d said Oren Barack, managing director of fixed income at New York-based AGP Alliance Global Partners. \u201cIt was never about willingness to pay it was about ability to pay. Now the two have converged.\u201d\n\nVIEW + El Salvador\u2019s Bukele Has Mixed Track Record Midway Through His Mandate Three years into a presidency marked by the Covid-19 pandemic, Nayib Bukele has brought change to the Central American country, but also faces many challenges\n\nRead more at Bloomberg.com"

The financial regulator said that the Terra co-founder and his company might have access to more than $100 million in cash since withdrawals started in June 2022.\n\nIn addition to identifying the stockpile of Bitcoin, the SEC said Kwon and Terra artificially restored TerraUSD\u2019s (UST) dollar peg \u2014 the stablecoin had been one of the largest by market capitalization at the time the platform collapsed.

According to the SEC, these tokens included UST, LUNA and wrapped LUNA, as well as MIR tokens and mAssets developed under Terra\u2019s Mirror Protocol.\n\n\u201cDefendants solicited investors for these crypto assets by touting their profit potential,\u201d said the SEC. \u201cDefendants repeatedly stated that the crypto assets would increase in value based on Terraform\u2019s development, maintenance, and promotion of its blockchain, protocols, and the entire Terraform ecosystem.\u201d\n\nTerra\u2019s business connections were also a target of the financial regulator, as the SEC reported Chai \u2014 a South Korean payment app linked to Terra at the time \u2014 \u201cdid not process or settle transactions on the Terraform blockchain.\u201d Rather, Terra allegedly reported transactions \u201cthat had already happened in the real world using Korean Won\u201d while claiming to the public that Chai transacted on the blockchain.\n\n\u201cIn at least five instances between October 2021 and March 2022, there were one or more days when no transactions whatsoever were confirmed on the Terraform blockchain,\u201d said the SEC. \u201cYet, there is no evidence that the Chai payment application was not functioning during those periods.\u201d\n\nThe SEC has charged Do Kwon with fraud - and their charges include how he lied about the Terra-Chai relationship.\n\n\n\nIn October, I grilled him on faking the Chai transaction data as well.\n\n\n\nFull interview here: https://t.co/xZyRGFBYnh pic.twitter.com/iQ4XT8q7X7 \u2014 Laura Shin (@laurashin) February 17, 2023\n\nRelated: \u2018Wild\u2019 \u2014 SEC going after Terra sparks responses from crypto lawyers\n\nKwon has continued to be active on his Twitter account following the collapse of Terra despite many crypto users blaming him for their loss of funds and the seeming \u201cripple event\u201d leading to multiple bankruptcies amid the crypto crash of 2022.

        "title": "Mt. Gox's leading creditors opt for Bitcoin payment that guarantees 90% of funds owed - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The two largest creditors of Mt. Gox, the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange that got hacked in 2014 \u2014 leading to the loss of 850,000 BTC \u2014 have chosen an early lump sum payment option that will not require a selloff of their Bitcoin holdings.\n\nThe payment is scheduled for September 2023, CoinDesk reported Feb. 16.\n\nWhile the option to wait for all Mt. Gox litigation to settle may offer higher payouts, it could take another 5-9 years, as per sources. Opting for the early payout will allow the creditors to receive their payments sooner and avoid any potential market impact that could result from a large-scale Bitcoin sell-off.\n\nAccording to sources, the two largest creditors of Mt. Gox, the cryptocurrency exchange that collapsed due to a hack nearly a decade ago, have chosen to receive their bankruptcy recovery in mostly bitcoin (BTC).\n\nThese creditors, Bitcoinica, a now-defunct New Zealand-based crypto exchange, and MtGox Investment Funds (MGIF), which collectively account for about one-fifth of all Mt. Gox claims, will receive 90% of their recoverable funds, which are estimated to be around 21% of their original holdings on the platform at the time of the hack.\n\nIn 2014, hackers stole 850,000 BTC, valued at $460 million at the time. Following the hack, Mt. Gox was left with roughly 142,000 BTC, 143,000 bitcoin cash (BCH), and 69 billion Japanese yen.\n\nAccording to CoinDesk sources, creditors who choose the lump sum option can elect to receive their payment in a mix of BTC, BCH, and yen, or they can ask for the entire amount to be given in fiat. By selecting the early payment, Bitcoinica and MGIF have also decided to receive the crypto option, which means that the majority of their payout will be in BTC.\n\nIf creditors decline the early lump sum payout, their only other recourse is to wait for the conclusion of civil rehabilitation litigation, which includes a lawsuit by CoinLab against Mt. Gox\u2019s estate. While this option may yield a slightly higher recovery, creditors have no guarantee that it won\u2019t be potentially lower than the 90% of recoverable holdings guaranteed by the lump sum payout.\n\nAdditionally, a legal analysis by a Japanese law firm indicated that holdouts could wait many years for their money to be returned.\n\nCreditors must decide by March 10, 2023, whether to accept the offered early lump sum or continue to wait for a potentially larger payout at an unspecified time in the future.\n\nWith the expected reimbursement now likely only months away, analysts worry that a major sell-off of Bitcoin could follow."

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nWelcome to our article, where we take a deep dive into the pre-history of Bitcoin, the revolutionary digital currency that has disrupted the traditional monetary system. In this piece, we explore the key events and individuals who laid the foundation for the creation of the world\u2019s first decentralized digital currency.\n\nBy understanding the origins of this technology, we can gain valuable insights into how it has transformed the way we think about money and financial transactions.\n\nJoin us on a fascinating 40 years journey through the early days of Bitcoin and discover how it all began.\n\nBut before we explore its growth and adoption, let\u2019s first understand the loopholes in traditional money. As the renowned economist, Friedrich Hayek once said,\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe we shall ever have good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of the government.\u201d\n\nThe traditional monetary system is controlled by central authorities and is susceptible to inflation, corruption, and manipulation. This led to a growing need for a decentralized and transparent alternative.\n\nIn 2008, an unknown individual or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto introduced a revolutionary idea \u2013 a peer-to-peer digital currency that operates without a central authority. This invention marked the beginning of a new era in the world of money \u2013 Bitcoin.\n\nOver the years, Bitcoin has grown to become a global phenomenon, with more and more people recognizing its potential as a store of value and a medium of exchange.\n\nThe adoption of digital currency has grown exponentially, with major companies such as Tesla and Square investing in it. Payment companies like PayPal and Visa are also integrating Bitcoin into their systems, and regulations have been put in place to ensure digital currency\u2019s safe and legal use.\n\nBut as the famous quote goes, \u201cBe patient, Empires are not built in a day\u201c. It took 40 years of discoveries and inventions for bitcoin org bitcoin org Event OrganiserTechnologyPayment solution to become a reality. And as we continue to see its growth and adoption, it\u2019s clear that the future of money may just be digital.\n\nLet\u2019s begin our journey into the World of Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Prehistory\n\nThe period of time before the creation of the Bitcoin network in January 2009. This prehistory is a complex and fascinating story that involves various individuals and events that contributed to the development of the digital currency.\n\nOne of the major events in Bitcoin\u2019s prehistory is the development of digital currencies that preceded it. One of the earliest examples is Ecash, created by David Chaum in 1982. Ecash was a digital currency that used encryption to ensure anonymity and security for transactions.\n\nAnother important precursor to Bitcoin is E-gold, created by Douglas Jackson and Barry Downey in 1996. E-gold was an online payment system that was based on the gold standard. It allowed users to make instant, low-cost transactions in gold.\n\nIn 1997, Adam Back developed hashcash, a proof-of-work system that was designed to prevent email spam. This system was later adapted and used in the Bitcoin network as a mechanism to secure transactions.\n\nAnother prominent figure in Bitcoin\u2019s prehistory is Nick Szabo, who created Bit gold in 1998. Bit gold was a decentralized digital currency that used a proof-of-work system similar to Hashcash.\n\nWei Dai, another computer scientist, and cryptographer created B-money in 1998. B-Money was a proposed electronic cash system that would use a distributed network to prevent double-spending.\n\nNow Finally, Hal Finney was an American computer scientist who developed Reusable Proof of Work (RPOW) in 2004. RPOW was a proposed system for creating digital tokens that could be traded on a peer-to-peer network, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nAll of these early digital currencies and projects laid the foundation for the creation of Bitcoin.\n\nWe have just learned about the prehistory of Bitcoin and the various individuals and projects that laid the foundation for its creation. Now, let\u2019s introduce the man behind the curtain, satoshi nakamoto satoshi nakamoto satoshi nakamoto Developer/Programmer .\n\nEntry of Satoshi Nakamoto\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym of the individual or group who created Bitcoin, entered the scene in 2008 with the publication of a white paper outlining a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. This system, known as Bitcoin, aimed to address the existing loopholes in traditional money that we discussed earlier.\n\nSatoshi identified that traditional money was controlled by central authorities and was susceptible to inflation, corruption, and manipulation. He also recognized that earlier digital currencies, such as Ecash and E-gold, faced issues of scalability and centralization, which led to their eventual demise.\n\nWith the launch of Bitcoin, Satoshi proposed a solution \u2013 a decentralized digital currency that operates on a peer-to-peer network. This network is secured by cryptography and operates without a central authority, making it resistant to manipulation and fraud.\n\nBefore the launch of Bitcoin, it was not possible to have a decentralized and transparent digital currency that operates on a peer-to-peer network. Satoshi\u2019s creation of Bitcoin made it possible for individuals to have direct control over their money, without the need for intermediaries.\n\nAlso Read: Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?The Ultimate Quest for Bitcoin\u2019s Creator\n\nSatoshi\u2019s Goal of Building Decentralization\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto was successful in building decentralization in Bitcoin by designing the network to operate on a peer-to-peer basis. In a peer-to-peer network, there is no central authority or intermediary controlling the network. Instead, all participants in the network are equal and have the same authority to validate transactions and create new blocks.\n\nTo achieve this, Satoshi implemented several key features in the Bitcoin network. One of the most important features is the blockchain. The blockchain is a decentralized, digital ledger that records all transactions on the network. It is maintained by a network of participants called nodes, who work together to validate transactions and create new blocks.\n\nAnother key feature that enables decentralization in Bitcoin is the consensus mechanism known as Proof of Work (PoW). PoW is a system that requires nodes to solve complex mathematical problems in order to add new blocks to the blockchain. This process is called mining, and it ensures that no single node can control the network.\n\nSatoshi also implemented a decentralized system for the distribution of new Bitcoins, which is known as the mining reward. In this system, new Bitcoins are created and distributed to nodes who successfully mine new blocks. This ensures that new Bitcoins are distributed fairly among all participants in the network.\n\nAdditionally, Satoshi designed Bitcoin to be open-source software, which means that anyone can access and modify the source code. This ensures that the network is transparent and allows the community to contribute to its development.\n\nOverall, Satoshi\u2019s design of a peer-to-peer network, the use of blockchain technology, the consensus mechanism of proof of work, the decentralized distribution of new Bitcoins, and the open-source nature of the software all contribute to the decentralization of the Bitcoin network.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, we have just seen how Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s vision of a decentralized digital currency led to the launch of Bitcoin. By designing a peer-to-peer network, implementing blockchain technology, using the consensus mechanism of Proof of Work and the open-source nature of the software, Satoshi was able to achieve decentralization in the Bitcoin network.\n\nThis decentralization has opened up new possibilities for the future of money, giving individuals direct control over their funds without the need for intermediaries. The rise of decentralization has also led to the launch of blockchain technology, which is now being used in various industries beyond just digital currency.\n\nAs we have seen, the growth of Bitcoin has been nothing short of remarkable. From its humble beginnings in 2008, it has grown to become a global phenomenon. Adoption of the digital currency has grown exponentially, with more and more people recognizing its potential as a store of value and a medium of exchange.\n\nIn the next article, let\u2019s dive deeper into the world of blockchain and bitcoin and see how decentralization has led to their launch and their potential for revolutionizing various industries. Thank you for reading and stay tuned for more updates on the world of decentralization and blockchain technology."

        "content": "Play-to-earn retro games with Bitcoin (BTC) payouts may soon be making their way to a bar, conference or meetup near you, according to a Feb. 12 tweet by Zebedee founder Christian Moss. The software is tentatively called \u201cBit-tendo.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Pay to Play & Play to Earn in Super Mario 3 on the original NES! #bitcoin #retrogames #lightningnetwork powered by @zebedeeio and @lnbits\n\n\n\n200 retweets and i'll integrate SONIC\n\n\n\n\"Bit-tendo\" will be a free retro game bitcoin infuser for bars, conferences, meet ups etc pic.twitter.com/4GBuXX9pN2 \u2014 Christian Moss (@MandelDuck) February 12, 2023\n\nThe tweet includes a video of someone playing Super Mario Bros. 3 on a small old-school tube television. The TV displays a QR code at startup and asks for a Bitcoin payment. The game only starts running once the payment is sent.\n\nDuring gameplay, a \u201csats\u201d counter is displayed that apparently counts the number of satoshis the player has won as a reward so far. Satoshis, or sats, are Bitcoin\u2019s smallest divisible unit, representing 0.00000001 BTC each. The display also shows a timer that counts down from 90 seconds to zero. When the timer goes to zero, the game ends, and a new QR code is displayed. A statement at the bottom and top of the image implies that the player can use the QR code to withdraw their sats.\n\nIn the post, Moss said that the software will eventually \u201cbe a free retro game bitcoin infuser for bars, conferences, meet ups etc.\u201d\n\nCointelegraph reached out to Moss for an explanation of how the software works. He said that it runs on a PC or other device that is able to accept a video feed. The game itself is produced by a real Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) console, but the video is altered en route to show the sats counter and timer. The software tracks movements in the video feed to determine if the player has collected a coin and updates the sats counter each time a coin is collected.\n\nMoss said that in order to fund the payout wallet, the bar or club needs to sign up for a custodial wallet with Zebedee or LNbits. The wallet is connected to the Lightning Network in order to enable low transaction fees and fast payments.\n\nRelated: Nigerian innovator launches first active Bitcoin Lightning node in the country\n\nThe Zebedee app is available on the Google Play Store and Apple\u2019s App Store. Screenshots reveal that it has a \u201ctop up\u201d (deposit) and \u201ccash out\u201d (withdrawal) function that can be accessed after the user completes a Know Your Customer verification process.\n\nMoss also explained how he came up with the idea for \u201cBit-tendo.\u201d He said that he tried to get people interested in Bitcoin play-to-earn games at Bitcoin conferences but found that participants preferred to play games they already knew rather than \u201cin-house\u201d designed games. Moss said he hopes to make the software work with any game, not just Super Mario Bros. 3:\n\n\u201cI want to also let the user be able to train the software to recognize events in any game they may have, ultimately making it game-agnostic.\u201d\n\nIn his tweet showing off the software, Moss states that he would integrate Sonic The Hedgehog 2 with it if the post got 200 retweets, which it has since received.\n\nMoss has been an innovator in the blockchain gaming space since its inception. In 2014, he created Sarutobi, a game that allowed players to collect Bitcoin by controlling a monkey that swung across a jungle landscape. Because it predated the release of EverdreamSoft\u2019s Spells of Genesis beta by approximately one year, Moss\u2019 Sarutobi is considered by some to have been the first blockchain game."

        "title": "How Many Bitcoins Does Satoshi Nakamoto Have? - Bankless Times",
        "content": "Satoshi Nakamoto is the creator and the biggest name in Bitcoin, but do we know just how many Bitcoins does Satoshi Nakamoto have, and what are they actually worth?\n\nFirst, it\u2019s worth noting this question is difficult to answer, as we still don\u2019t know for certain whether Satoshi is a single person, a group of individuals, or an entity. Satoshi Nakamoto is simply a pseudonym used to refer to the people, or person who helped develop the software for Bitcoin.\n\nCurrently, Nakamoto is considered to have the most Bitcoins of any cryptocurrency holder. Read on to learn all about the Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin wallet.\n\nHow Many Bitcoins Does Satoshi Nakamoto Have?\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto is believed to have approximately 1.1 million Bitcoin. However, it\u2019s worth noting this number is only an estimate. It\u2019s difficult to track the Bitcoin owned by Satoshi, because the public wallet addresses belonging to the entity haven\u2019t been fully identified.\n\nThe 1.1 million Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin wallet value comes from a pattern identified in the first two years of the Bitcoin mining trend. The pattern was detected by a chain analyst named Sergio Demian Lerner, the Chief Scientist for RSK Labs, and is best-known as the Patoshi pattern.\n\nIn 2013, Lerner released a study which indicates the vast majority of the initial BTC released was mined by a single individual. According to Lerner\u2019s estimates, a single miner may have processed around 22,000 blocks in the first year of Bitcoin, and may have gathered 1.8 million Bitcoin in total, 1.1 million of which has not been spent.\n\n(Bitslog)\n\nThe Bitcoins Owned by Satoshi Nakamoto\n\nExperts believe the sheer volume of Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin holdings attributed to the entity today are a result of a low hash rate for the cryptocurrency during 2009. Much of the mining which took place in the early days of Bitcoin was likely to be done by Satoshi himself, as many people still weren\u2019t aware of the currency, or how to correctly mine it.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto is widely considered to hold the most Bitcoin in the world.\n\nWith more than 1 million Bitcoins attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto today, the entity is considered the largest holder of BTC in the world. Although the number might not seem particularly large at first glance, the Satoshi Nakamoto wallets holding over 1 million Bitcoin account for around 5% of the total number of Bitcoins which can ever be generated.\n\nOnly 21 million Bitcoins can ever be created and mined, meaning Satoshi retains a massive stake in the overall Bitcoin cryptocurrency.\n\n(Coin Telegraph)\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence Satoshi Nakamoto sold Bitcoin.\n\nThough people claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto have announced they plan on selling some of their BTC to the public, there\u2019s no evidence that this has taken place as of yet. Despite sitting on billions of dollars\u2019 worth of Bitcoin, the Satoshi Nakamoto wallet value hasn\u2019t dropped in recent years.\n\nInterestingly, however, a Satoshi-era wallet did become active and move during 2022, holding around 500 BTC. However, there\u2019s no evidence this wallet actually belongs to the Bitcoin creator.\n\n(Pyments)\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto is the most productive Bitcoin miner in the world.\n\nAn analysis by Whale Alert, one of the biggest blockchain tracking and analytics companies in the world, found Satoshi may have been one of the most prolific Bitcoin miners of all time. According to the report, a single address (believed to belong to Satoshi) may have mined up to 1,125,150 tokens up to block 54,316 in the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n(Whale Alert)\n\nWhat Is Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s Net Worth?\n\nThough we have very little information about any official Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin wallet, we can make assumptions about the entity\u2019s net worth, based on the studies into the market.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto may be worth around $42 billion.\n\nCurrently, estimates suggest the net worth of Satoshi Nakamoto may be around $42 billion. This is based on an analysis of the early Bitcoin wallets which are believed to belong to the person or group. These wallets currently hold around 980,000 bitcoins, although it\u2019s believed Satoshi Nakamoto owns more than 1 million BTC in total.\n\nBased on the current value of Bitcoin, the value of around 980,000 BTC would equate to around $43 billion in today\u2019s market.\n\n(Bitslog)\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto is the 15th wealthiest person in the world.\n\nAs of 2021, Satoshi Nakamoto was also identified as the fifteenth wealthiest person in the world, according to an analysis by the Independent. At the time, the publication valued Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s net worth as being somewhere around $73 billion.\n\n(Independent)\n\nConclusion\n\nUltimately, any estimates we have of a Satoshi Nakamoto net worth or wallet value are based on speculation and cryptocurrency analysis. We can\u2019t know for certain how much this entity is truly worth without getting a clear view of which Bitcoin wallets they hold.\n\nHowever, most experts agree Satoshi Nakamoto is still the largest Bitcoin whale in the industry.\n\nSources:"

        "content": "Dubai, UAE, Feb. 17, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Over the past couple of weeks the original BAYC monkeys have marked themselves as the second most popular selling NFT collection worth $1.3M. The offspin of the ultimate NFT collection has now been released on the ultimate blockchain of Bitcoin.\n\nThe Ordinals protocol, which has been originally introduced to crypto in 2014, has gained momentum along with the market interest two weeks ago when the option of creating NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain was revealed. The main idea of such NFTs is that they are completely stored on the blockchain, which is possible thanks to the updates of SegWit (2017) and Taproot (2021). Ordinals was also the first protocol to create a Bitcoin NFT. The latest & hottest NFT collection named the Ordinal Punks - inspired by the legendary CryptoPunks - has already appeared on the marketplace, with the Ordinal Punk NFT #620 being sold for 9.5 BTC (~$215,000).\n\nThe next one to have their say within the rapid bloom of Bitcoin NFTs is BAYC Bitcoin NFT, a which is extremely popular with celebrities and brands - Eminem for example has recently joined the list of BAYC holders, he purchased his monkey for the staggering 123.4 ETH (~$380,000) and made it his avatar on Instagram, other celebrity owners being Justin Bieber, Snoop Dogg, and Jimmy Faloon.\n\nBAYC BITCOIN NFT is a collection of 10,000 original monkeys with unique Bitcoin traits, as well as 10 ultra rare signature NFT monkeys in Satoshi masks. The mint of the collection is set to kick off on February, 17 at 11:00 UTC. The users who are lucky enough to secure a mint will become the owners of a BAYC NFT for a flat price of 0.01 BTC. Given the success of the previous BAYC collections, there is good evidence that BAYC BITCOIN NFT will perform just as well.\n\nTo make it even more compelling, as soon as the BAYC Bitcoin NFT collection is 100% minted, the user to have minted the BTC BAYC #910 will receive a 1 BTC offer from the team in exchange for it.\n\n\n\n\u201dThis is an exciting time for the world of bitcoin and NFTs, the potential of this and other similar projects designed and implemented via the Bitcoin blockchain is huge. The level of interest in the Bitcoin NFTs continues its exponential growth despite the current fees, proving that there is a huge demand for reunion with the technological roots of the blockchain technology\u201d, says Mike Fritz, CTO at Baycbitcoin. - \u201cThe NFT market is booming again, and this immense interest might be the best indicator of the hatching bull market\u201d.\n\nOfficial BAYC Bitcoin NFT Twitter: https://twitter.com/baycbitcoincom\n\nOfficial BAYC Bitcoin NFT Telegram: https://t.me/Baycbitcoin\n\n"

The SEC then allege Kwon has been transferring bitcoin from this wallet to a bank in Switzerland, converting it all into cash.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the complaint did not name which bank the Terraform Labs founder was using, Kwon has withdrawn more than $100 million in fiat currency from June of last year to now, according to the SEC\u2019s complaint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the time just before the crypto collapse in May of last year, the price of bitcoin was hovering around $30,000, which means the 10,000 bitcoin could have been worth $300 million if Kwon tried to immediately convert it into fiat currency.\n\nThe SEC wants Kwon and Terraform Labs to be barred from dealing in crypto, and for them to pay penalties for illegally dealing in securities. SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a press release \u201cThis case demonstrates the lengths to which some crypto firms will go to avoid complying with the securities laws, but it also demonstrates the strength and commitment of the SEC\u2019s dedicated public servants.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe SEC also alleged Kwon misled investors about the stability of its UST stablecoin. According to the complaint, the company also lied to investors that the Terraform blockchain was being used by a popular Korean mobile payment app called \u201cChai.\u201d Instead, the SEC said Terraform Labs \u201creplicated Chai payments on the Terraform blockchain\u201d to make it seem like there was far more adoption for the tech than there really was.\n\nThe complaint references a presentation aired on CNBC Africa that the company posted on YouTube back in 2019, where Kwon said \u201cwe have had 430,000 shoppers over the Chai gateway, and most of them coming in the last month. And we\u2019ve processed nearly 2 [million] transactions up to date.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo Kwon has been avoiding international law enforcement for months now after South Korean prosecutors issued a warrant for his arrest. He was last traced to Dubai and then Serbia, but the failed crypto founder has repeatedly maintained he is not on the run, and has further called the allegations against him \u201cpolitically motivated.\u201d Still, the man who is definitely not running from prosecution has kept uncharacteristically quiet on his once-prolific Twitter account since the start of 2023.\n\nThroughout the SEC\u2019s complaint, it routinely argues that Terraform Lab\u2019s promotion and transactions of its Terra, Luna, and wrapped Luna tokens all counted as securities in some way, shape, or form, meaning the majority of the crypto buying and selling was using unregistered assets. The SEC has stepped up its attempts to control crypto markets, reportedly taking on other stablecoins like the BUSD token issued by Paxos."

        "title": "The 10 Biggest Crypto Whales in the Market - Bankless Times",
        "content": "Who are the biggest crypto whales in the market today, and what kind of impact do they have on the investment landscape? In the cryptocurrency space, \u201cwhale\u201d is the term given to an investor who holds a huge amount of coins or tokens of a particular cryptocurrency.\n\nCrypto whales are important to the cryptocurrency investment space because they can create a ripple effect in the market, generating changes in token valuation.\n\nIf you know where the whales are swimming, you can often gain a better idea of how the markets they\u2019re involved in might be influenced going forward.\n\nWho Are the Biggest Cryptocurrency Whales Right Now?\n\nDefining the biggest whales in crypto can be difficult. While some of the biggest investors in cryptocurrency are very open about how many tokens they hold, others are less straightforward. Cryptocurrency can be a highly anonymized area, so it\u2019s difficult to know for certain which big wallets belong to which people.\n\nSome of the biggest cryptocurrency whales are actually major companies responsible for trading or managing large amounts of tokens.\n\nHowever, this list focuses on individuals known to us by name (or pseudonym), and these are some of the biggest crypto whales we\u2019re aware of right now based on estimates by experts.\n\n1. Satoshi Nakamoto\n\nUndoubtedly the biggest cryptocurrency whale in the world, Satoshi Nakamoto is the pseudonym for the inventor of Bitcoin. We\u2019re not sure for certain whether this is a person or a group of people, but we do know they continue to hold ownership of around 1 million BTC.\n\nIn today\u2019s market, 1 million BTC equates to around 19.2 billion US dollars. If Nakamoto is a single person, this would make them the biggest crypto whale of all time.\n\n2. Brian Armstrong\n\nBrian Armstrong is the CEO of Coinbase, one of the largest crypto exchanges on the market. The website handles billions of trades every day, and Brian has a significant amount of crypto contributing to his own net worth.\n\nEstimates suggest the CEO has a crypto fortune worth of around $6.5 billion. However, it\u2019s difficult to know what kind of crypto whale Armstrong is and which currencies he holds.\n\n3. Michael Saylor\n\nMichael Saylor is an American entrepreneur and businessman, as well as one of the biggest Bitcoin whales of all time. Experts even believe he might have been responsible for some major movements in the Bitcoin landscape, and he currently owns more than 17,732 bitcoins, worth over $1.14 billion.\n\nSaylor\u2019s company, MicroStrategy, also began accumulating bitcoins in 2020. While we don\u2019t know exactly how many Bitcoins Michael holds today, some experts say the BTC bank for the company is worth billions.\n\n4. Chris Larsen\n\nOne of the co-founders of the credit lending company Eloan, and peer-to-peer lending site Prosper, Chris Larsen helped to launch the Ripple cryptocurrency in 2012. Ripple is a blockchain network that has grown popular in the crypto whales list over the years.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no direct information on how much crypto Larsen holds overall, Larsen does have at least 5.19 billion XRP, creating a net holding worth of around $37.3 billion.\n\n5. Changpeng Zhao\n\nThe CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, is considered to be one of the biggest Bitcoin whales on the market, though he hasn\u2019t released a lot of information about his holdings. Unsurprisingly, Zhao\u2019s crypto holdings fall into both Binance coin and Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to reports, Zhao\u2019s net worth is around $96 billion, but this doesn\u2019t take into account his cryptocurrency holdings, which he says he plans on donating to charity.\n\n6. Vitalik Buterin\n\nVitalik Buterin is considered to be one of the biggest Ethereum whales on the market, though his holdings in ETH remain unknown at this time. As the co-creator of Ethereum, Buterin was once said to hold around 355,000 Ethereum, as well as various whale-sized quantities of other coins, like SHIB, Akita, and Dogecoin.\n\nIn 2022, Vitalik announced he was no longer a crypto whale following the collapse of various coin investments. However, we don\u2019t know for certain how much he holds today.\n\n7. Tim Draper\n\nWell-known venture capitalist, tech billionaire, and entrepreneur Tim Draper is considered to be one of the biggest players on the Bitcoin whales list after he purchased 30,000 bitcoins for a bargain price when they were seized by Silk Road.\n\nThough Draper won\u2019t reveal how many bitcoins he currently owns today, he also has wallets in various other cryptocurrencies, such as Aragon\u2019s \u201cANT\u201d tokens. The tech expert is expected to be worth a little over $1 billion.\n\n8. The Winklevoss Twins\n\nThe Winklevoss twins are perhaps best known for accusing Mark Zuckerberg for stealing their idea for a social network. In a 2012 settlement, they won around $65 million in court and invested it in a stack of Bitcoin. At the time, the twins were said to purchase about 1% of all the BTC in existence.\n\nThe twins are still considered to be some of the biggest Bitcoin whales around, with around 70,000 bitcoins in their portfolio, as well as a variety of other cryptocurrencies.\n\n9. Barry Silbert\n\nBarry Silbert acquired Digital Currency Group with funds from the sale of Second-Market, an equity trading platform acquired by Nasdaq in 2015.\n\nThis conglomerate consists of five companies, one of which is Grayscale, a digital asset management company.\n\nGrayscale manages a portfolio of assets worth over $28 billion (\u00a320.6 billion), including Bitcoin and Ether. It was the first application approved to trade securities backed by Bitcoin and raised about \u00a3434 million annually.\n\n10. Jed McCaleb\n\nJed McCaleb was one of the co-founders of Ripple and is, therefore, one of the biggest XRP whales in the market today. Although McCaleb left the company following a disagreement with his other founders, he\u2019s still said to own around 3.4 billion XRP.\n\nBy today\u2019s standards, this gives McCaleb\u2019s wallet a net worth of around $1.6 billion, which makes up a significant portion of his overall wealth. Apparently, Jed also has investments in other crypto markets, though he hasn\u2019t revealed the details of his portfolio.\n\nThe Biggest Crypto Whales Today\n\nCrypto whales\u2019 fortunes can be difficult to estimate because not everyone is open about their cryptocurrency holdings. The information we have about the current crypto whales is based on the news reports issued by major crypto purchases over the years. However, the volatility of the crypto market means many new whales could emerge in the future.\n\nFAQ\n\nWho are the biggest crypto whales? The biggest crypto whales are people with the largest numbers of tokens in a specific cryptocurrency. For instance, one of the top crypto whales in Bitcoin is Satoshi Nakamoto, the individual responsible for initially creating BTC. How many crypto whales are there? While we do have some information about the largest crypto whales to hit the market throughout the years, many of these people and entities remain anonymous. As such, it\u2019s difficult to determine how many crypto whales there really are. How much money do you need to be a crypto whale? Being a crypto whale isn\u2019t about the amount of money you have as much as it is about the number of tokens or coins you own in a specific currency. Crypto whales usually have around at least $10 million worth of a specific coin.\n\nHere Are More Crypto Guides"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency continued its recovery rally on Thursday. Bitcoin price went on to surge by a whopping 10% over the past 24 hours, breaking the crucial $24k price level. However, this major price spike has left every investor hoping for Bitcoin to breach the $25k level but experts have some different ideas about this move.\n\nBitcoin Price On The Surge\n\nBitcoin price is up by 16% over the past 30 days as its dominant level in the digital asset market nears to 50%. BTC is trading at an average price of $24,560, at the press time. Meanwhile, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, a crypto expert speculated that this can be the biggest bull trap he has ever seen.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHe added that this can be a lesson that is determined in one direction of the market. This can trick you into giant losses and kill many portfolios. Read More Bitcoin News Here\u2026\n\nHowever, the analyst mentioned that the corrections are proportionately short lived in an upward trending market. Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe suggested that higher timeframe levels get one test. After this move markets start to shoot upward. Meanwhile, if Bitcoin price breaks $25k then it might march towards the $30-35K price level.\n\nBTC Liquidation Breaches $81 Million\n\nAs per data, an unknown whale address went on to buy $24.2 million worth of 984 Bitcoin in a single scoop. The crypto whale bought this BTC from Coinbase. Meanwhile, a few whales went to send $55 million worth 2270 BTC to different crypto exchanges in multiple transactions amid the recent price surge.\n\nThe largest transaction recorded by the tracker has been of moving 1299 Bitcoin (approx worth $31.3 million) to the Huobi crypto exchange. However, Bitcoin\u2019s 24 hour trading volume has spiked by 33% to stand at $35.7 billion.\n\nCoinglass data depicts that more than $81 million have been liquidated from Bitcoin over the past 24 hours.

        "content": "\u201cWith my podcast and Bitcoin, I suddenly have access to two important things: sponsors who will invest the money to allow us to do everything we\u2019ve done here and then followers who follow my podcast who will support it.\u201d\n\nBiography:\n\nPeter McCormack is a storyteller, commentator and host of What Bitcoin Did, one of the most listened to and viewed Web3 and crypto podcasts. McCormack also hosts the Defiance podcast and has over 500,000 followers on Twitter alone. What Bitcoin Did started in 2017 and has aired over 500 episodes, with three new shows typically published every week. Having chatted with many Web3 trailblazers, the podcast covers topics on Bitcoin, the Lightning Network, libertarianism, censorship and more. McCormack attended Buckinghamshire New University in 1997 to pursue a degree in music industry management but dropped out to found his own startup in 2000.\n\nMcCormack is famously known for calling Craig Wright a fraud when Wright claimed to be Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto \u2014 which sparked a subsequent legal battle. McCormack is also the chairman of the Real Bedford football club. Before launching What Bitcoin Did and Defiance, McCormack co-founded a marketing agency after gaining experience in journalism through his various senior roles at Evolving Media Network, Rapier UK and Bantr.tv, an online social network for soccer fans.\n\nMcCormack\u2019s 2022:\n\nMcCormack often discussed the technology and fundamentals of Bitcoin and hosted guests who criticized government policies and proclaimed the need for Bitcoin as a store of value. He also interviewed United States Senator Ted Cruz and discussed the importance of Bitcoin in the state of Texas. In late 2022, McCormack released his film Follow The Money #2 - Inflation, The Hidden Tax, in which he visits Bedford and Harlow to document the impact of inflation on families and businesses.\n\nApart from these projects, he often raised topics surrounding the economic purity of Bitcoin and options for carbon neutrality for blockchain. He criticized traditional capital markets during the Credit Suisse crisis and said FTX\u2019s collapse highlighted the failures of the centralized system. In October, he released an episode of What Bitcoin Did featuring Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, in which he said the U.S. Federal Reserve was missing all signs of deflation and argued it was critical to invest in disruptive technology innovation. In December, McCormack\u2019s battle with Wright reached a key milestone when the U.K.\u2019s High Court ruled that McCormack should pay Wright over $1 million to cover his legal costs.\n\nMcCormack\u2019s 2023:\n\nMcCormack\u2019s 2023 looks to be business as usual for him as a content creator, with the only thorn in his side being the Wright legal case. The year began with a hearing on Jan. 12, and a substantive hearing has been scheduled for April.\n\nAt Real Bedford, though, it has been an eventful start. The club found itself amid controversy when an opposing player, who is Sikh, received a red card for getting angry after his patka (a religious head covering) was pulled off by a Real Bedford player. However, the team was sitting at the top of the table at the start of the year, and it looks set for a successful campaign.\n\nMcCormack\u2019s work behind the microphone as a podcaster continues, and he has already spoken about Grayscale Bitcoin Trust with Steven McClurg, Bitcoin security with Jameson Lopp, and the macro outlook for the economy and Bitcoin with Lyn Alden Schwartzer. McCormack and his storytelling will likely continue as an ever-present element of the crypto ecosystem while the market hopefully recovers from the abyss of 2022."

        "title": "Craig Wright on the very start of Bitcoin - CoinGeek",
        "content": "width=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nDr. Craig Wright is looking at a screenshot of the early Bitcoin website which someone has posted on Twitter. It\u2019s from January 3, 2009. He remembers what was going on at that time: \u201cFirst launch of the code, making sure everything ran. The first set of problems shortly after that week, when it needed to be restarted.\u201d\n\nDr. Wright, who signed himself \u201caka Satoshi Nakamoto\u201d on the previous week\u2019s CoinGeek Conversations, this week reminisces about how it all began. He was testing his systems, with the transaction in question being one he was sending to himself between two of his own computers.\n\nHe is happy to admit that the Bitcoin website \u201cdemonstrates my lack of design skills.\u201d There were other features he would have liked to have added but it was early days and \u201cyou can forgive me for not having everything perfect.\u201d\n\nHe says he would probably have been making this particular transaction in the computer room he\u2019d constructed in one of the outbuildings of his Australian farm, some hours\u2019 drive from Sydney. It would have been a very techy scene: \u201cComputers, printers, more computers, screens everywhere. And me in the middle with roller-type chairs so I could get back and forth between the sites.\u201d\n\nSo it must have been a big moment when the Bitcoin software was finally working? \u201cHaving it actually run, yes, it was good,\u201d he says, adding with a smile, \u201chaving it crash shortly afterwards wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nA Eureka moment in fact? \u201cYeah, I\u2019d say that would be the way you would look at it. I mean, I had been working on trying to find a solution to micropayment problems since 1997. So yeah, it was nice to finally have something that worked.\u201d\n\nTo devise Bitcoin as a technical and economic system, Dr. Wright had studied in a wide variety of fields: \u201cBitcoin is really a combination of computer science and economics and game theory and by having a background on all of these topics it makes it much easier.\u201d\n\nOn the question of who knew that he was Satoshi Nakamoto back then, Dr. Wright says that it was more widely known than he realised at DeMorgan, the business he founded to exploit blockchain opportunities. He didn\u2019t tell his staff that he had invented Bitcoin \u201cbut I found out later that they all knew anyway.\u201d\n\nIt seems that the staff were keeping a secret from him, rather than the other way round, as he discovered when he questioned a colleague: \u201c\u2018So you guys know that I\u2019m Satoshi?\u2019 He went, \u2019well, yes.\u2019 \u2018All right, so why didn\u2019t you talk to me about this earlier?\u2019 He went \u2018well, we didn\u2019t think you wanted to. Obviously you wanted to be private, so we just didn\u2019t tell.\u2019\u201d As to why he hadn\u2019t told them himself, Dr. Wright just says, \u201cI didn\u2019t think there was a reason.\u201d\n\nThere may be a chance to hear from some of those who knew Dr. Wright at this time when he calls witnesses to the appeal hearing in Oslo later this year in the case which he is defending against Magnus \u201cHodlonaut\u201d Granath. The appeal follows the original case heard in September 2022 at which several character witnesses gave evidence on his behalf. In the re-run, Dr. Wright promises there will be \u201cmore\u201d such witnesses talking about his work on Bitcoin.\n\nHear the whole of Dr. Craig Wright\u2019s interview in this week\u2019s CoinGeek Conversations podcast or catch up with other recent episodes:\n\nYou can also watch the podcast video on YouTube.\n\nPlease subscribe to CoinGeek Conversations \u2013 this is part of the podcast\u2019s new series.

        "content": "Mt. Gox biggest creditors to receive 90% of their payout in Bitcoin\n\nThe two largest creditors of infamous defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox, Bitcoinica and MtGox Investment Funds (MGIF), have chosen to get their bankruptcy recovery funds paid out in bitcoin.\n\nAlongside other claimants, who have been waiting for a payout since Mt. Gox shuttered a decade ago, will receive 90% of what they are owed under a proposal by the trust managing the exchange\u2019s liabilities.\n\nRather than waiting another 3 to 5 years, the Early Lum-Sum Repayment will enable creditors to recover somewhere between 15%-25% of what they actually held on to the exchange. The liquidity option also allows them to choose which assets would like to be paid back in BTC and/or BCH or cash.\n\nMtGox Investment Funds (MGIF) and Bitcoinica, a New Zealand-based crypto exchange, collectively represent about 20 percent of all Mt. Gox claims, which are estimated at $3.4 billion.\n\nAlmost a decade after an attack forced the platform to shut down, Mt. Gox creditors were given the option to choose between bitcoin, cash or Bitcoin Cash to receive repayment. The process could make the frozen crypto assets liquid again, depending on the entitled users\u2019 choices.\n\nThose who chose to receive their repayment in bitcoin are reportedly posing a new selling threat to an already battered market. Even those who opt to get paid in fiat money are risking pressuring the market further as the trustee would supposedly liquidate an equivalent amount of bitcoin to pay out those interested in receiving cash.\n\nHowever, Eric Wall, a Mt. Gox creditor, dismissed the rumors that all of the roughly 150,000 BTC sent to creditors would soon be offloaded into an already stressed bear market.\n\nInterestingly, crypto exchange Bitstamp was appointed by Mt. Gox trustee as one of the designated crypto exchanges to assist in the repayment procedures to creditors. Bitstamp has released a complete description of how those affected can register to reclaim their digital assets through the exchange.\n\nBitstamp was approved, along with three other cryptocurrency exchanges, to assist creditors in receiving their assets. A creditor of Mt. Gox can choose their preferred cryptocurrency exchange and register as a user for the receipt of the relevant assets according to the repayment procedures under the rehabilitation plan."

He has also been in controversy for his misogynist comments on feminism.\n\nHowever, after winning the championship in kickboxing, he is now running a crypto trading school, Hustler\u2019s University.

It looks more a case of blockchain \u2018Yes\u2019, bitcoin \u2018No\u2019.\n\n2 minutes\n\nMatthew Allen\n\nWhen not covering fintech, cryptocurrencies, blockchain, banks and trade, swissinfo.ch's business correspondent can be found playing cricket on various grounds in Switzerland - including the frozen lake of St Moritz.\n\nSwitzerland\u2019s second largest bank is the lead investor in a $65 million (CHF60 million) series B round in Taurus, which specialises in crypto finance.\n\nExternal Content Your subscription could not be saved.

Subscribe\n\nThe Geneva-based Taurus provides services to store and manage cryptocurrencies and to issue stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency backed by more traditional assets.\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t mean that Credit Suisse is primed to dive into bitcoin. The bank is more interested in Taurus\u2019s other business \u2013 creating blockchain compliant versions of company shares and other securities.\n\nThis means creating digital versions of securities that are stored and transferred on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) systems. The hope is that DLT will make it faster, more cost-effective and transparent to create and trade stocks and bonds.\n\nDLT interest spreading\n\nCredit Suisse is following a path already trodden by other traditional financial players, such as the Swiss stock exchange and other banks.\n\nTaurus has a proven track record of tokenising company shares. It recently helped the Swiss private bank Cit\u00e9 Gestion achieve this feat with its own shares.\n\nSwiss companies Metaco, Daura and Aktionariat are also very much in the same game.\n\nThe term digital assets can these days encompass a whole range of items: from cryptocurrencies to digital securities and DLT tokens representing art and real estate.\n\nDecentralised vs centralised\n\nCredit Suisse\u2019s foray into digital assets is a far cry from the libertarian values of bitcoin and other public blockchains that are striving to move away from centralised gatekeepers, such as banks.\n\nVery few Swiss banks are willing to jump on the bitcoin bandwagon, particularly after the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX last year. \u201cLike many banks, we are still conservative,\u201d Credit Suisse Switzerland CEO Andr\u00e9 Helfenstein told the Handelszeitung newspaper.\n\nThe centralised and decentralised pathways for digital assets are locked in an arm wrestle for the future of finance.\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly possible that both systems could prevail, running in parallel, depending on consumer demand and the exact goal of their operations."

        "title": "Bitcoin [BTC] breaks past $24k after CPI report: A rally in the making? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price hit the $24,000 price range for the first time in six months.\n\nNet position change showed short positions dominating trade.\n\nThe initial reactions to 13 February\u2019s release of the Consumer Price Index data on Bitcoin [BTC] were divided. Recent pricing activity, however, suggested it had weathered the storm reasonably with a return to a range seen months ago. So, is this a temporary upswing or the beginning of a new trend?\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nUpswing into the $24,000\n\nBitcoin entered the $24,000 price level for the first time since August at the close of trading on 15 February. A daily timeframe analysis of the price movement revealed that it had increased in value by the end of trading by 9.47%. It was trading at about $24,500 as of this writing and had reached $24,800 in the same time, with over a 1% gain already registered.\n\nThere was a correlation between the price movement and the volume, as seen by a check at the On Balance Volume (OBV). This points to a positive price movement for BTC. A good price move was also indicated by a movement above the long and short Moving Averages (blue and yellow lines).\n\nAccording to the Relative Strength Index (RSI), the asset was in a strong bull trend. The RSI line was above the neutral region and appeared to be moving toward the overbought territory.\n\nLong vs. short\n\nDespite this surge, most traders continued to take short positions against Bitcoin. Most exchanges were dominated by short holdings, as indicated by the Net Position shift seen on Glassnode. This was a sign that the asset\u2019s price might decline.\n\nAdditionally, a glance at Coinglass\u2019s BTC Long/Short Ratio revealed a constant battle between long and short takers across exchanges. But as of this writing, the longs were edging, standing at around 59%, while the shorts were at about 40%.\n\nWhales\u2019 activities increase\n\nOn the other hand, whales appear content to continue acquiring Bitcoin while the long and short positions are battling it out. A glance at the Whale transaction metric proved that it has started, as suggested in a post by Santiment, that whale activities might increase.\n\nWhale transactions increased on 15 February, according to the measured metrics of above 100,000 and 1 million. Except for two spikes in January, Bitcoin transactions exceeding 100,000 increased to a level last seen in October. According to the data, transactions of over one million have also increased recently.\n\nLiquidations if\u2026\n\nConsistent buying by market heavyweights indicates they are comfortable with the market\u2019s direction. If the price of Bitcoin keeps rising, many traders will move to cover their short positions. The move might spark a new wave of buying across the board. CoinMarketCap estimated that the total value of all cryptocurrencies was roughly $1.12 trillion, an increase of over 8% as of this writing.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nMoreover, on 15 February, Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville announced his intention to reintroduce the Financial Freedom Act. According to the Senator, the Financial Freedom Act overturned a Department of Labor guideline, restricting crypto investments in 401(k) plans.\n\nIn addition, the senator claims that this legislation will prevent the DOL from taking legal action against anyone who uses brokerage windows to invest in cryptocurrencies. Although the bill has not been considered on the House floor, it may have generated positive sentiments in the crypto community."

        "title": "Iris Energy to triple Bitcoin mining capacity with purchase of thousands of new rigs - Forbes India",
        "content": "\n\n\n\nIris Energy, a BTC mining company based in Australia, has announced that it will significantly increase its mining capacity by adding thousands of new mining rigs.\n\n\n\nSpecifically, the company has purchased a large number of Bitmain Antminer S19j Pro ASIC miners, which will add 4.4 exahashes per second (EH/s) to its existing capacity. With this addition, Iris Energy's total self-mining capacity will increase to 5.5 EH/s from its previous capacity of 2.0 EH/s.\n\nThe newly purchased Bitmain Antminer S19j Pro ASIC miners have a maximum hash rate of 100 terahashes per second (TH/s), so Iris Energy has effectively added around 44,000 miners to its mining fleet.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis purchase is a major achievement for the company, according to Daniel Roberts, one of its co-founders and co-CEOs. He also noted that the recent period has been difficult for the industry and the market as a whole.\n\n\n\n\n\nIris Energy has not specified where the new miners will be installed in its centres, but it has four facilities located in British Columbia, Canada, and Texas, United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo fund the purchase of the new rigs, the company used $67 million of the remaining prepayments it had made to ASIC miner manufacturer Bitmain without any additional cash payments.\n\n\n\n\n\nIris Energy had a contract with Bitmain for 10 EH/s which it has now fully resolved with no remaining obligations. Additionally, the company has stated that it is currently debt-free.\n\n\n\n\n\nIris Energy has mentioned that it is exploring the possibility of selling any surplus miners that are above its current 5.5 EH/s of mining capacity in order to reinvest the funds. It is not clear how many excess miners the company may have at this time.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn November of last year, Iris Energy was forced to disconnect some of its miners, which were used as collateral for a loan of $107.8 million. This was due to the miners producing insufficient cash flow to cover their respective debt financing obligations.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent months, crypto miners have faced multiple challenges, such as low Bitcoin prices, high hash rates, great mining difficulty, and high energy prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, publicly listed Bitcoin mining companies have been under significant pressure, leading them to sell off almost all of the BTC they mined in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to blockchain research firm Messari, Iris Energy sold approximately 100 percent of the nearly 2,500 BTC it mined in that year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe writer is the founder at yMedia. He ventured into crypto in 2013 and is an ETH maximalist. Twitter: @bhardwajshash"

        "title": "What does Warren Buffett thinks of cryptocurrency? All you need to know - MintGenie",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have fallen to their lowest since November 2021 with many personal financial experts even comparing the unbridled fall to a pack of cards.\n\nAs opposed to 2021 when many new investors bet their earnings in Bitcoin, Ether and other cryptocurrency forms following multiple crypto success stories, many people have been reduced to penury owing to billions of dollars being wiped out of the crypto space.\n\nFor example, in November 2021 the value of Bitcoin had risen to $ 67,566.83. The latest price of Bitcoin is somewhere around $ $24,307.84. Similarly, Ethereum is today priced at $ 1,673.75 compared to the high of $ 4,812.09 in November 2021.\n\nInvestor confidence is at an all-time low considering how many had put in their lifetime earnings and savings. Amidst all the cacophony in favour of cryptocurrencies and the world\u2019s largest crypto coin Bitcoin hitting the mainstream in 2021, the Chief Executive Officer of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett continued to be sceptical about its growth and continuity.\n\nDismissing bitcoin as \u201crat poison squared\u201d Explaining why he does not find Bitcoin investable, Buffett cited, \u201cIf you told me you own all of the bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything,\u201d adding, \u201cWhether it goes up or down in the next year, or five or 10 years, I don\u2019t know. But the one thing I\u2019m pretty sure of is that it doesn\u2019t produce anything. It\u2019s got a magic to it and people have attached magic to lots of things.\u201d\n\nIronically, many crypto investors have found innovative ways to use these coins productively, for example, through lending or using them as collateral to take loans from banks and financial institutions. Backed by inexplicable speculation, crypto coins were once the most sought-after investment options that people looked for to add to their investment portfolios till all hell broke loose and new-age investors realized them as nothing short of risky and worthless delusion.\n\nAnticipating a bad ending to cryptos While crypto fans brushed off all warning signs by conservative investors worldwide, Buffett labelled these coins as liabilities and a by-product of craze and misconceptions surrounding how one must evaluate investments in the long run.\n\nBuffett shared with CNBC in 2018, \u201cIf you and I buy various cryptocurrencies, they're not going to multiply. There are not going to be a bunch of rabbits sitting there in front of us. They're just gonna sit there. And I gotta hope next time you get more excited after I've bought it from you and then I'll get more excited and buy it from you. We could sit in the house by ourselves and we could keep running up the price between us. But at the end of the time, there's one bitcoin sitting there and now we've gotta find somebody else. They come to an end.\u201d\n\nThe famous billionaire also added, \u201cIn terms of cryptocurrencies generally, I can say almost with certainty that they will come to a bad ending. If I could buy a five-year put on every one of the cryptocurrencies, I'd be glad to do it, but I would never short a dime's worth.\u201d, thus, putting to rest his thoughts about such phoney investments.\n\nThe total number of bitcoins"
